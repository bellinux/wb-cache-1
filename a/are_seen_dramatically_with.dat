40|$|A {{critical}} factor in visual function is {{the speed with which}} photoreceptors (PRs) return to the resting state when light intensity dims. Several elements subserve this process, many of which promote the termination of the phototransduction cascade. Although the known elements are intrinsic to PRs, we have found that prompt restoration to the resting state of the Drosophila electroretinogram can require effective communication between the retina and the underlying brain. The requirement <b>is</b> <b>seen</b> more <b>dramatically</b> <b>with</b> long than with short light pulses, distinguishing the phenomenon from gross disruption of the termination machinery. The speed of recovery is affected by mutations (in the Hdc and ort genes) that prevent PRs from transmitting visual information to the brain. It is also affected by manipulation (using either drugs like neostigmine or genetic tools to inactivate neurotransmitter release) of cholinergic signals that arise in the brain. Intracellular recordings support the hypothesis that PRs are the target of this communication. We infer that signaling from the retina to the optic lobe prompts a feedback signal to retinal PRs. Although the mechanism of this retrograde signaling remains to be discerned, the phenomenon establishes a previously unappreciated mode of control of the temporal responsiveness of a primary sensory neuron...|$|R
40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of this study}} were to perform a quantitative comparison of proteins released from cartilage explants in response to treatment with IL- 1 β, TNF-α, or mechanical compression injury in vitro and to interpret this release in the context of anabolic-catabolic shifts known to occur in cartilage in response to these insults in vitro and their implications in vivo. Bovine calf cartilage explants from 6 – 12 animals were subjected to injurious compression, TNF-α (100 ng/ml), IL- 1 β (10 ng/ml), or no treatment and cultured for 5 days in equal volumes of medium. The pooled medium from each of these four conditions was labeled with one of four iTRAQ labels and subjected to nano- 2 D-LC/MS/MS on a quadrupole time-of-flight instrument. Data were analysed by ProQuant for peptide identification and quantitation. k-means clustering and biological pathways analysis were used to identify proteins that may correlate with known cartilage phenotypic responses to such treatments. IL- 1 β and TNF-α treatment caused a decrease in the synthesis of collagen subunits (p < 0. 05) as well as increased release of aggrecan G 2 and G 3 domains to the medium (p < 0. 05). MMP- 1, MMP- 3, MMP- 9, and MMP- 13 were significantly increased by all treatments compared with untreated samples (p < 0. 10). Increased release of proteins involved in innate immunity and immune cell recruitment were noted following IL- 1 β and TNF-α treatment, whereas increased release of intracellular proteins <b>was</b> <b>seen</b> most <b>dramatically</b> <b>with</b> mechanical compression injury. Proteins involved in insulin-like growth factor and TGF-β superfamily pathway modulation showed changes in pro-anabolic pathways that may represent early repair signals. At the systems level, two principal components were sufficient to describe 97 % of the covariance in the data. A strong correlation was noted between the proteins released in response to IL- 1 β and TNF-α; in contrast, mechanical injury resulted in both similarities and unique differences in the groups of proteins released compared with cytokine treatment...|$|R
40|$|The lymphatic {{metastasis}} of tumours to {{lymph nodes}} (LN) {{is a frequent}} event in many cancers and heralds a poor clinical outcome. Comparison of lymphatic endothelial cells (LECS) from metastasizing murine T- 241 /VEGF-C fibrosarcomas and normal dermis revealed a tumour-specific LEC profile, characterized by the elevated expression of functionally significant molecules such as endothelial specific adhesion molecule (ESAM) and the TGF-~ coreceptor endoglin (CD 105). Moreover, similar induction of ESAM and endoglin by human tumour Iymphatics <b>was</b> <b>seen</b> to <b>dramatically</b> correlate <b>with</b> LN metastasis. To further investigate interactions between tumour cells and Iymphatics, the role of lymphatic endothelial hyaluronan receptor LYVE- 1 in LN metastasis was investigated. Using LYVE- 1 mAbs and LYVE- 1 - 1 - mice, it was shown that a deficiency or perturbation of LYVE- 1 expressed by tumour Iymphatics potentiated the lymphatic spread of spontaneously metastasizing T- 241 /VEGF-C fibrosarcomas and induced de novo metastasis by indolent parental T- 241 tumours. Subsequent in vitro experiments using mAbs suggested that LYVE- 1 exerts a blocking or 'gatekeeper' function, preventing pro-metastatic tumour cell-LEC interactions. Although largely restricted to the Iymphatics, LYVE- 1 is also expressed in murine lung by type I alveolar epithelial cells (AECs). Using a bleomycin model of lung inflammation it was shown that LYVE- 1 - 1 - mice are unable to clear infiltrating leukocytes following acute lung injury. Furthermore, in vivo and in vitro experiments using blocking mAb reveal a critical role for LYVE- 1 in the transepithelial migration of leukocytes across the alveolar epithelium, an essential step in the resolution of acute lung inflammation. These findings identify a specific role for LYVE- 1 in cancer metastasis and the resolution of acute inflammation in the lung. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R

40|$|Osteoarthritis is {{characterized}} by synovial joint degeneration, and its cardinal pathological feature is degeneration and loss of the articular cartilage joint surface. While the aetiology of osteoarthritis is unknown, risk factors include gender, age, obesity, and prior joint injury. Joint injuries, including tears of the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) and meniscus, increase the risk {{for the development of}} OA and involve both mechanical damage to cartilage, meniscus and synovial tissues, and tissue degradation associated with cytokine-induced inflammation. While the role of inflammatory cytokines in OA is still controversial, their role in rheumatoid arthritis is evidenced by the successful use of anti-TNF-ca and anti-IL- 1 therapies to abrogate disease symptoms and progression. In vitro, both IL- 13 and TNF-ca promote chondrocyte-mediated matrix degradation and inhibit cartilage matrix synthesis, while mechanical damage causes cell death, matrix damage, and decreased cell biosynthesis. Understanding the similarities and differences in cartilage responses to inflammatory cytokines and mechanical injury is important in understanding the catabolic-anabolic shifts that typify OA progression. Therefore, the objectives of this thesis were (1) to identify the role of TNF-a and IL- 1 induced nitric oxide (NO) as a mediator of cartilage tissue damage;(cont.) (2) to characterize and compare the regulation by IL- 1 P, TNF-cc, and mechanical injury of secreted factors, matrix degradation, and mechanisms of chondrocyte cell death using an SDS-PAGE-LC/MS/MS protein profiling approach; and (3) to further quantify the effects of IL- 1 3, TNF-ca and injury using an isobaric isotope labeling (iTRAQ) based 2 D-LC/MS/MS approach. Together these studies were designed to provide better understanding of matrix degradation, cell death, immune response, and evidence of cell-mediated repair processes. NO is produced by chondrocytes in response to inflammatory cytokines TNF-a, IL- 1 3 and IL- 17, and can mediate cellular and extracellular events through cGMP signaling, protein modifications (e. g., S-nitrosation or tyrosine nitration), altered transcript stability, and altered sugar and lipid chemistry. Cartilage was treated with IL- 13 or TNF-ca left untreated in {{the presence or absence of}} the NO synthase inhibitor, L-N-methylarginine (L-NMA), and changes in gene expression and matrix breakdown were measured. We found that L-NMA treatment partially inhibited TNF-a-induced, aggrecanase-mediated aggrecan degradation as indicated by a decrease in sGAG loss to the medium and by an increase in the generation of aggrecanase-specific aggrecan fragments. (cont.) No change was observed upon addition of L-NMA to IL- 1 P treated explants, but addition of L-NMA to combined IL- 1 3 and TNF-a treated explants increased sGAG loss, suggesting that the effects of NO may be contextual. We hypothesized that this might be due to differences in aggrecanase expression (ADAMTS 4 vs. ADAMTS 5) or post-translational modification, but no aggrecanase was consistently identified in the samples. No difference in MMP expression or activation was noted following addition of L-NMA, and no change in NO chemistry between IL- 1 3 and TNF-a treatment was evident by nitrate and nitrite production. Gene expression analysis was conducted on a battery of 32 genes, including matrix proteins, inflammatory mediators, proteases, cytokines and growth factors, and housekeeping proteins. While IL- 113 and TNF-a both increased the expression of proteases and inflammatory mediators, addition of L-NMA did not significantly affect expression of the genes tested. We concluded that the effects of TNF-a and IL- 1 p-induced NO production may depend on differences in cellular responses to each of these cytokines and possibly to differences in signaling or aggrecanase expression. (cont.) In the second study, newborn bovine calf cartilage explants were treated with 10 ng/ml IL- 1 p, 100 ng/ml TNF-a, radially-unconfined injurious compression (strain: 50 %; strain rate 1000 /o/sec), or no treatment, and cultured for five days. Pooled medium was subjected to SDS-PAGE-LC/MS/MS, and data were analyzed by Spectrum Mill proteomics software, focusing on protein identification, differences between treatments and matrix protein proteolysis. Over 250 proteins were identified among the four protein groups including CD 109, platelet derived growth factor like protein, and scrapie responsive protein, which have not been previously identified in cartilage. IL- 13 and TNF-a caused an increase in YKL 39, YKL 40, complement factor B, MMP- 3, ECM- 1, haptoglobin, serum amyloid A 3, and clusterin. Injurious compression caused the release of intracellular proteins including GRP 58, GRP 78, alpha 4 actinin, pyruvate kinase, and vimentin, suggesting a loss of membrane integrity in a population of chondrocytes. Data on actin release within the first 24 hours suggested that this loss of membrane integrity occurred by mechanical cell disruption. Injurious compression also caused proteolysis of collagen type VI subunits, collagen type II, and COMP. Thrombospondin 1 fragments <b>were</b> <b>seen</b> in all treatment groups, and aggrecan proteolysis was predominant with cytokine treatment. (cont.) Cartilage explants subjected to injurious compression released intracellular proteins and showed enhanced degradation of matrix proteins, while explants subjected to IL- 13 or TNF-ct released proteins involved in innate immunity and stress response. In the third study, cartilage explants were subjected to injurious compression, TNF-a (100 ng/ml) or IL- 13 (10 ng/ml), or no treatment, cultured in equal volumes of medium, and the medium was collected, pooled and the proteins deglycosylated by treatment with chondroitinase ABC. The proteins were subjected to trypsinization, and the peptides were labeled with one of four iTRAQ labels each containing a unique signature ion. The labeled peptides were subjected to nano- 2 D-LC/MS/MS on a QStar, quadrupole time of flight instrument. The study was done in analytical replicate on a pooled sample of greater than 70 explants from a total of 6 - 12 different animals. Data were analyzed by ProQuant to obtain a ProGroup peptide report containing identified spectra, which were combined to achieve a peptide, and then a protein level output of mean ratios, standard deviations of those ratios, and significance based on either Wilcoxan sign rank or Student's t-test both corrected for multiple comparisons. (cont.) Because of our interest in catabolic and anabolic shifts, a targeted data analysis approach was taken in addition to a systems level PCA and K-means clustering approach. By focusing on particular protein domains, we identified a decrease in the synthesis of most fibrillar collagen subunits (p< 0. 05), and an increase in the release of the aggrecan G 2 and G 3 domains with IL- 13 and TNF-ta treatment (p< 0. 05). We also noted a significant increase in MMP- 1, MMP- 3, MMP- 9, and MMP- 13 in at least one condition and, in most cases, all conditions compared to the untreated sample. Increases in proteins involved in innate immunity and immune cell recruitment were noted with IL- 1 [3 and TNF-a treatment, while an increase in intracellular protein release <b>was</b> <b>seen</b> most <b>dramatically</b> <b>with</b> mechanical compression injury. Since anabolic effects are often driven by the insulin-like growth factor family and the TGF-[3 superfamily, we specifically identified members of these pathways to understand which factors may mediate early repair processes. (cont.) At the systems level, 2 principal components were sufficient to describe 97 % of the covariance in the data. IL- 1 and TNF-a caused a similar response in proteins identified; in contrast, a 'Y'-shaped distribution was observed upon projection of proteins based on their response injury vs. cytokine treatment. K-means clustering revealed six main clusters to further characterize the biology of mechanical injury versus cytokine effects on cartilage. by Anna L. Stevens. Thesis (Ph. D.)

The prevention of such impurities from entering the weld region and surrounding heat affected zones is critical for engineering applications as these species <b>are</b> <b>seen</b> to <b>dramatically</b> alter the microstructure and so mechanical properties of the material. Of greatest concern is embrittlement of the weld region. During this study, the influence of inert shielding gas on atmospheric contamination by interstitial species, namely hydrogen, carbon, nitrogen and oxygen, was investigated {{as a function of}} post-weld gas shielding temperature. Gas tungsten arc welding (GTAW) was used to compare samples of commercially pure (CP) titanium and Ti- 6 Al- 4 V alloy formed by conventional manufacturing methods. The influence of post-weld gas shielding on mechanical properties was quantified ex-situ through microhardness testing with observations of microstructure also made.

Oncolytic viruses {{have shown}} promise as anticancer agents, but {{their access to}} metastatic sites {{following}} systemic delivery is low. Because systemic delivery of small molecule chemotherapy is enhanced by prior treatment with anti-angiogenic agents due to changes in intravascular-to-tumor interstitial pressure, we sought to determine if anti-angiogenic pretreatment increases antitumor efficacy of systemic virotherapy by increasing virus uptake into tumor. Virus biodistribution and anti-tumor effects were monitored in tumor-bearing mice given anti-human VEGF or anti-mouse VEGFR 2 before or after an intravenous injection of virus. Without pretreatment, the average virus titers in the tumor samples amplified 1700 -fold over 48 hours but were undetectable in other organs.

No such particle inversion was observed for ionic surfactants that bind to the EHEC backbone.

40|$|Spatial {{maps of the}} high-pass {{frequency}} filtered time-averaged root-mean-squared (RMS) Doppler velocities tend to show substantial decrements within {{regions of}} strong field and curiously, randomly distributed patches of enhancement in the vicinity. We propose that these haloes or enhancements are a consequence of magnetic-field-induced mode mixing (scattering), resulting in the preferential powering of waves that possess strong surface velocity signatures (i. e. scattering from low to high wavenumbers). Evidently, this process can occur in the reverse, and therefore {{in order to determine}} if the haloes are indeed caused by mode mixing, we must answer the question: how are acoustic waves scattered by magnetic fields? Through simulations of the interactions between waves and sunspots and models of plage, we demonstrate that the high to low modal order scattering channels are favoured. With increasing frequency and consequently, decreasing wavelength, a growing number of modes are scattered by the sunspot, thereby rendering the enhancements most visible around the high-frequency parts of the spectrum. The haloes obtained from the simulations are on the same order of magnitude but weaker than those observed. We also present observational evidence to support this theory: observations of active region AR 9787 are firstly frequency filtered to isolate the 5 - 6 mHz signals and secondly, decomposed into three wavenumber bandpasses, l - [0, 400], [400, 800], [800, 2222].

High time resolution observations from Dynamic Explorer 1 are used to investigate these processes. It is shown that in the spacecraft frame the injection is modulated or pulsating with a period of approximately 18 - 30 s with the injection duration possibly being as short as 6 s. This modulation indicates that there may be fast time scale and/or short scale length processes modulating the injection of the magnetosheath plasma across the magnetopause. In addition, the pulsating injection <b>is</b> <b>seen</b> to modulate the outflow of upwelling ionospheric ions to the magnetosphere. These upwelling ions <b>are</b> <b>seen</b> prior to the magnetosheath ion injection and therefore are not directly created by the injection.

On two occasions during the encounter, the particle fluxes are sufficiently high that enhanced downward flows of perpendicularly heated ions, of presumably ionospheric origin, are observed in association with a reduction in the intensity of the upwelling ions. These observations are probably the first detection of downward conics and suggest that there is momentum transfer between the magnetosheath and ionospheric ions.

This motif can <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> most <b>dramatically</b> in bars and taverns, where gypsy musicians lead their Serbian customers in veritable celebrations of unreason. "This is real," Serbs say about these gatherings where the canons of propriety and civilized behavior are overthrown with obvious relish. "This is life. "The author, who spent several months in Serbia investigating these wild meetings, relates the 'unreason' of the behaviour in these bars to the atrocities committed during the war which broke out during his stay. Highlighting how the program of civilization brings with it the need to construct an image of humankind more compatible with the lessons of history, Gypsies, Wars and Other Instances of the Wild may be read as a case-study of how war-infested societies cope with wartime traumas...|$|R

X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis confirms phase pure compounds in an orthorhombic structure for both these methods. However, microstructural images show polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) assisted SG method aids colloidal growth giving evenly distributed microparticles while SS method tend to an agglomeration during high-temperature processing. The electrochemical properties for SG <b>are</b> <b>seen</b> to <b>be</b> <b>dramatically</b> superior {{to those of}} SS. The galvanostatic analysis of the SG shows improved specific capacity over the initial cycles (45 mAh/g and 60 mAh/g for the 1 st and 20 th cycles) and stabilized upon cycling. This unique capability {{is due to the}} trapped organic products from the thermal decomposition of PVP that facilitates Li+ transfer. The trapped organic coating on the cathode surface without affecting the bulk olivine is evidenced by XRD, FTIR and XPS spectroscopic techniques...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: Cables, such as {{are used}} in {{cable-stayed}} bridges and other cable structures, are prone to vibration due to their low inherent damping characteristics. Transversely-attached passive viscous dampers have been implemented on some cables to dampen vibration. However, only minimal damping can be added if the damper attachment point {{is close to the}} end of the cable. For long cables, passive dampers may provide insufficient supplemental damping to eliminate vibration problems. A recent study by the authors demonstrated that “smart ” semiactive damping can provide significantly superior supplemental damping for a cable modeled as a taut string. This paper extends the previous work by adding sag, inclination, and axial flexibility to the cable model. The equations of motion are given. A new control-oriented model is developed for cables with sag. Passive, active, and smart (semiactive) dampers are incorporated into the model. Cable response <b>is</b> <b>seen</b> to <b>be</b> <b>dramatically</b> reduced by semiactive dampers for a wide range of cable sag and damper location. ...|$|R
40|$|We {{apply the}} self-interaction {{corrected}} local spin density %(SIC-LSD) approximation {{to study the}} electronic structure and magnetic properties of the spinel ferrites MnFe$_{ 2 }$O$_{ 4 }$, Fe$_{ 3 }$O$_{ 4 }$, CoFe$_{ 2 }$O$_{ 4 }$, and NiFe$_{ 2 }$O$_{ 4 }$. We concentrate on establishing the nominal valence of the transition metal elements and the ground state structure, based {{on the study of}} various valence scenarios for both the inverse and normal spinel structures for all the systems. For both structures we find all the studied compounds to be insulating, but with smaller gaps in the normal spinel scenario. On the contrary, the calculated spin magnetic moments and the exchange splitting of the conduction bands <b>are</b> <b>seen</b> to increase <b>dramatically</b> when moving from the inverse spinel structure to the normal spinel kind. We find substantial orbital moments for NiFe$_{ 2 }$O$_{ 4 }$ and CoFe$_{ 2 }$O$_{ 4 }$. Comment: 12 pages, 4 figures and 11 table...|$|R
40|$|The NA 60 {{experiment}} {{studies the}} production of open charm and prompt dimuons in proton-nucleus and nucleus-nucleus collisions at the CERN SPS. To access the kinematics of charged particles already at the vertex level, a radiation tolerant silicon pixel detector has been placed in a 2. 5 T magnetic field near the target. This vertex spectrometer was built from 96 ALICE 1 LHCB pixel chips arranged in 12 tracking planes. The vertex spectrometer was successfully operated in a run with a 158 GeV/nucleon indium ion beam incident on indium targets in October-November 2003. During the five-week-long run it was exposed {{to high levels of}} radiation distributed inhomogeneously over the detector. The most exposed regions of the silicon sensors underwent type inversion.

40|$|The {{structure}} of CdTe/ZnTe superlattices has been analyzed through θ/ 2 θ x‐ray diffraction, photoluminescence, and in situ reflection high‐energy electron diffraction (RHEED) measurements. Samples {{are found to}} break away from Cd_(x) Zn_(1 −x) Te buffer layers {{as a consequence of the}} 6 % lattice mismatch in this system. However, defect densities in these superlattices <b>are</b> <b>seen</b> to drop <b>dramatically</b> away from the buffer layer interface, accounting for the intense photoluminescence and high‐average strain fields seen in each of our samples. Observed variations in residual strains suggest that growth conditions play a role in forming misfit defects. This could explain discrepancies with calculated values of critical thickness based on models which neglect growth conditions. Photoluminescence spectra reveal that layer‐to‐layer growth proceeded with single monolayer uniformity, suggesting highly reproducible growth. Our results give hope for relatively defect‐free Cd_(x) Zn_(1 −x) Te/Cd_(y) Zn_(1 −y) Te superlattices with the potential for applications to optoelectronics offered by intense visible light emitters...|$|R

40|$|We {{present the}} first {{measurements}} of ion rotational distributions for photoionization {{over an extended}} range [0 ≤ E_K ≤ 200 eV for N_ 2 (2 σ^(− 1) _u) and 3 ≤ E_K ≤ 125 eV for CO (4 σ^(− 1)) ]. The N_ 2 ion rotational distributions <b>are</b> <b>seen</b> to change <b>dramatically</b> over this energy range, indicating that characteristically molecular behavior of the photoelectron persists far from ionization threshold. In addition, the N_ 2 and CO results show a strikingly different dependence on energy. Although differences are expected due {{to the absence of}} a center of symmetry in CO, detailed calculations reveal that this behavior arises from the presence of Cooper minima in the 2 σ_u →kσ_g continuum in the case of N_ 2 and from an f‐wave shape resonance in the 4 σ→kσ channel in CO. Agreement between measured and calculated ion rotational distributions is excellent. The N_ 2 results are also compared with electron bombardment ionization data. This comparison demonstrates that previous interpretations of electron bombardment data are prone to errors...|$|R
40|$|International audienceAlthough it {{has been}} {{reported}} in a few instances that the spectroscopic properties of cyanine dyes were strongly dependent {{on the nature of the}} chemical substitution of their central carbon atom, there has not been to date any systematic study specifically aimed at rationalizing this behavior. In this article, such a systematic study is carried out on an extended family of 17 polymethine dyes carrying different substituents on their central carbon, some of those being specifically synthesized for this study, some of those similar to previously reported compounds, for the sake of comparison. Their absorption properties, which spread over the whole visible to near-infrared spectral range, <b>are</b> <b>seen</b> to <b>be</b> <b>dramatically</b> dependent on the electron-donating character of this central substituent. By correlating this behavior to NMR spectroscopy and (vibronic) TD-DFT calculations, we show that it results from a profound modification of the ground state electronic configuration, namely, a progressive localization of the cationic charge on the central carbon as the electron-donating nature of the central substituent is increased...|$|R
