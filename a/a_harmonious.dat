5|$|Built between 1093 and 1537, Chester Cathedral {{includes}} {{a set of}} medieval choir stalls dating from 1380, with exquisite figurative carving. An unusual feature is the very large south transept. The Early English Lady Chapel is <b>a</b> <b>harmonious</b> composition in Lancet Gothic. It retains substantial monastic buildings including a large refectory.|$|E
5|$|Mahayana Buddhism, Theravada Buddhism and {{traditional}} Chinese rituals blend into <b>a</b> <b>harmonious</b> whole, {{both in the}} temple architecture and artwork {{as well as in}} the daily activities of worshippers. The temple is heavily commercialised with shops at every level and inside the main temple complexes selling all religious paraphernalia.|$|E
5|$|The cathedral's {{architecture}} presents <b>a</b> <b>harmonious</b> whole {{which is}} entirely Gothic and {{mostly in the}} Early English style of the late 12th and early 13th centuries. In this respect Wells differs from most other English medieval cathedrals, which have parts in the earlier Romanesque style introduced to Britain by the Normans in the 11th century.|$|E

5|$|Although {{dating from}} 1195 to about 1400, Lichfield Cathedral has an {{interior}} which presents <b>a</b> <b>harmonious</b> appearance, {{much of which}} is due to its having undergone extensive restoration and refurnishing in the 19th century. The nave is very fine and the Lady Chapel is apsidal with very tall windows, giving a rather French impression. Lichfield {{is the only one of}} the cathedrals to have retained three spires.|$|E
5|$|Cosimo did {{not enjoy}} <b>a</b> <b>harmonious</b> {{relationship}} with his elder son, Ferdinando. They disagreed about Cosimo's bigoted ideology and his monthly allowance. Cosimo married him to a Bavarian princess, Violante Beatrice. This union was exceedingly discontent, and produced no offspring. Anna Maria Luisa was the Grand Duke's favourite child. She married Johann Wilhelm, Elector Palatine, and like her brother, had no issue. Gian Gastone, Cosimo's eventual successor, despised {{his father and his}} court. Anna Maria Luisa arranged for him to marry Anna Maria Franziska of Saxe-Lauenburg, a union that produced no children.|$|E
5|$|Anna Maria Luisa and Johann Wilhelm, notwithstanding, shared <b>a</b> <b>harmonious</b> marriage. The Electress {{spent her}} time enjoying balls, musical {{performances}} and other festivities. He commissioned a theatre for her where the comedies of French playwright Molière were performed. Because Anna Maria Luisa patronised many musicians, the contemporary Palatine court enjoyed regard {{as an international}} centre of music. She invited Fortunato Chelleri to court and appointed him maestro di cappella ("music teacher"). Agostino Steffani, a polymath, {{was sponsored by the}} Electress from his arrival in Düsseldorf, in 1703, until her return to Tuscany; the Conservatorio library in Florence houses two editions of his chamber duets.|$|E

5|$|Despite {{the fact}} that Louis Stanislas was not {{infatuated}} with his wife, he boasted that the two enjoyed vigorous conjugal relations– but such declarations were held in low esteem by courtiers at Versailles. He also proclaimed his wife to be pregnant merely to spite Louis Auguste and his wife Marie Antoinette, {{who had not yet}} consummated their marriage. The Dauphin and Louis Stanislas did not enjoy <b>a</b> <b>harmonious</b> relationship and often quarrelled, as did their wives. Louis Stanislas did impregnate his wife in 1774, having conquered his aversion. However, the pregnancy ended in a miscarriage. A second pregnancy in 1781 also miscarried, and the marriage remained childless.|$|E
5|$|Galileo made {{original}} {{contributions to}} the science of motion through an innovative combination of experiment and mathematics. More typical of science {{at the time were}} the qualitative studies of William Gilbert, on magnetism and electricity. Galileo's father, Vincenzo Galilei, a lutenist and music theorist, had performed experiments establishing perhaps the oldest known non-linear relation in physics: for a stretched string, the pitch varies as the square root of the tension. These observations lay {{within the framework of the}} Pythagorean tradition of music, well-known to instrument makers, which included the fact that subdividing a string by a whole number produces <b>a</b> <b>harmonious</b> scale. Thus, a limited amount of mathematics had long related music and physical science, and young Galileo could see his own father's observations expand on that tradition.|$|E
5|$|Seneb is {{depicted}} {{with his wife}} and children in a painted sculpture from his tomb, rediscovered in 1926, that is a famous example of Old Kingdom art. It shows him sitting cross-legged on a block of stone with his wife embracing him and his children standing below him where the legs of a full-size person would ordinarily have been. The composition of the scene thus achieves <b>a</b> <b>harmonious</b> symmetry. It depicts Seneb realistically with the facial features and shortened limbs of an individual with achondroplasia, a common form of dwarfism. Paintings and carvings in the tomb give his titles and depict various scenes from his life, such as carrying out inspections of his estate and holding symbols of his office.|$|E

5|$|The sculpture's roughly cubical {{arrangement}} cleverly {{ensures that}} the overall composition retains <b>a</b> <b>harmonious</b> equilibrium. It is lightened by the artist dispensing with a back slab and incorporating negative space into the piece. By putting {{the children in the}} place of Seneb's legs, the artist adds to the sense of symmetry. He creates the same impression that would have been made by an ordinary seated figure, preserving an appearance of normality without disguising Seneb's unusual physique. The family's names and titles are given in inscriptions placed {{on either side of the}} children and on the horizontal face of the base.|$|E
5|$|The text {{presents}} Cyrus as entering Babylon peacefully {{and being}} welcomed by {{the population as}} a liberator. This presents an implicit contrast with previous conquerors, notably the Assyrian rulers Tukulti-Ninurta I, who invaded and plundered Babylon in the 12th century BC, and Sennacherib, who did the same thing 150 years before Cyrus conquered the region. The massacre and enslavement of conquered people was common practice and was explicitly highlighted by conquerors in victory statements. The Cyrus Cylinder presents a very different message; Johannes Haubold notes that it portrays Cyrus's takeover as <b>a</b> <b>harmonious</b> moment of convergence between Babylonian and Persian history, not a natural disaster but the salvation of Babylonia.|$|E
5|$|A {{supporter}} of the evangelical wing of the Church of England, Wilberforce believed that the revitalisation of the Church and individual Christian observance would lead to <b>a</b> <b>harmonious,</b> moral society. He sought to elevate the status of religion {{in public and private}} life, making piety fashionable in both the upper- and middle-classes of society. To this end, in April 1797, Wilberforce published , on which he had been working since 1793. This was an exposition of New Testament doctrine and teachings and a call for a revival of Christianity, {{as a response to the}} moral decline of the nation, illustrating his own personal testimony and the views which inspired him. The book proved to be influential and a best-seller by the standards of the day; 7,500copies were sold within six months, and it was translated into several languages.|$|E

5|$|Landscape was a {{secondary}} concern to Netherlandish painters before the mid 1460s. Geographical settings were rare {{and when they}} did appear usually consisted of glimpses through open windows or arcades. They were rarely based on actual locations; the settings tended to be largely imagined, designed to suit the thematic thrust of the panel. Because most of the works were donor portraits, very often the landscapes were tame, controlled and served merely to provide <b>a</b> <b>harmonious</b> setting for the idealised interior space. In this, the northern artists lagged behind their Italian counterparts who were already placing their sitters within geographically identifiable and closely described landscapes. Some of the northern landscapes are highly detailed and notable in their own right, including van Eyck's unsentimental c.1430 Crucifixion and Last Judgement diptych and van der Weyden's widely copied 1435–40 Saint Luke Drawing the Virgin.|$|E
5|$|Most historians sharply criticize Davis for his flawed {{military}} strategy, {{his selection}} of friends for military commands, and his neglect of homefront crises. Until {{late in the}} war, he resisted efforts to appoint a general-in-chief, essentially handling those duties himself. On January 31, 1865, Lee assumed this role, but it was far too late. Davis insisted on a strategy of trying to defend all Southern territory with ostensibly equal effort. This diluted the limited resources of the South and made it vulnerable to coordinated strategic thrusts by the Union into the vital Western Theater (e.g., the capture of New Orleans in early 1862). He made other controversial strategic choices, such as allowing Lee to invade the North in 1862 and 1863 while the Western armies were under very heavy pressure. When Lee lost at Gettysburg, Vicksburg simultaneously fell, and the Union {{took control of the}} Mississippi River, splitting the Confederacy. At Vicksburg, the failure to coordinate multiple forces {{on both sides of the}} Mississippi River rested primarily on Davis's inability to create <b>a</b> <b>harmonious</b> departmental arrangement or to force such generals as Edmund Kirby Smith, Earl Van Dorn, and Theophilus H. Holmes to work together.|$|E
5|$|To achieve <b>a</b> <b>harmonious</b> visual look, {{producer}} designer Hans Bacher and {{art director}} Ric Sluiter, along with Robert Walker and Head of Backgrounds Robert Stanton collaborated {{to establish a}} proper chronological location for the film in Chinese history. Since there was no general consensus {{on the time of}} Mulan's existence, they based on the visual design on the Ming and Qing dynasties. An important element of Bacher's design was to turn the art style closer to Chinese painting, with watercolor and simpler design, as opposed to the details of The Lion King and The Hunchback of Notre Dame. Bacher further studied more than thirty-five film directors ranging from the silent era German Expressionism, British and American epics of the 1950s and 60s, and the spaghetti westerns for inspiration for composition, lighting, and staging that would establish settings that enhanced the characters, and additional inspiration was found in the earlier Disney animated films such as Bambi, Pinocchio, and Dumbo to establish a sense of staging.|$|E
