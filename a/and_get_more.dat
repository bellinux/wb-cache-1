25|$|Along {{with the}} split between {{northern}} and southern Vietnam in geographical territory came the divergence in their distinctive choices for institutional political structure. Northern Vietnam (Dai Viet) opted for a centralized bureaucratic regime while the southern {{is based on a}} patron-client mechanism heavily relied on personalized rule. During this period, due to this structural difference, the north and south revealed different patterns in their economic activities, the long-term effect of which still persist up to today.

25|$|On 26 September 2016, the U.S. Army {{placed an}} order for another 130 JLTVs and 748 kits valued at $42 million; this was the third JLTV order since {{contract}} award.

The Army received its first seven JLTVs for test {{at the end of}} September 2016 according to Colonel Shane Fullmer, JLTV project manager stated at an AUSA 2016 media briefing. He said test vehicles would be sent to Yuma, Arizona, for automotive and mobility testing; to Ft Huachuca, Arizona, for cyber, electronic warfare, and C4 testing; Aberdeen Proving Ground, Maryland, for reliability and automotive testing; and to Alaska for automotive and environmental testing. Some JLTV testing was deferred during the EMD phase, as the government did not want to pay for testing with three suppliers, and it is now set for testing with a fleet of 100 JLTVs. By April 2017 30 JLTVs had been delivered, testing expected to continue through the first quarter of FY19. Also at an AUSA 2016 media briefing, Scott Davis, program executive officer for Combat Support & Combat Service Support, stated that Overall the JLTV programme expects to cut about five years off of the total program and save about US$5.9 billion, as Oshkosh's final competitive bid was low enough so the army decided to 'buy to budget' <b>and</b> <b>get</b> <b>more</b> platforms each year, which shrunk the total length of the contract and increased cost avoidances accrued each year. At AUSA 2016, Oshkosh displayed a JLTV General Purpose variant equipped with an EOS R-400S-MK2 remote weapon system integrated with Orbital ATK's M230 LF 30mm lightweight automatic chain gun.|$|E
500|$|Travis Fickett of IGN {{disliked the}} episode, criticizing it as [...] "sloppy," [...] the science as [...] "repeating itself," [...] and the fringe element [...] as [...] "especially goofy"; he rated the episode 6.0/10. Writing for Mania.com, critic Stephen Lackey thought Anna Torv's {{performance}} [...] "felt forced", but heaped praise on John Noble. Lackey believes Torv and Joshua Jackson have good chemistry, and consequently partly disliked the episode {{because they had}} few scenes together. He also thought {{the case of the}} week was [...] "fairly entertaining," [...] but the storyline was [...] "just...passable", as he wanted the show [...] "to be done with all of the introductions <b>and</b> <b>get</b> <b>more</b> into the mystery of the pattern". He concluded his review, [...] "Hopefully, next week the story will be just a little more concise, Olivia and Peter back working together and maybe at some point Astrid will actually have something important to do". The Los Angeles Times thought the episode was [...] "solid if unexceptional", as he liked Walter but disliked the [...] "vacuum of personality" [...] that is Astrid.|$|E

500|$|A then-record 3,000-plus {{special effects}} shots would {{ultimately}} {{be required for}} the film. The shoot utilized on-set, in-camera special effects more often than computer-generated effects {{in an effort to}} save money <b>and</b> <b>get</b> <b>more</b> authentic pyrotechnic results. Many of these shots were accomplished at Hughes Aircraft in Culver City, California, where the film's art department, motion control photography teams, pyrotechnics team, and model shop were headquartered. The production's model-making department built {{more than twice as many}} miniatures for the production than had ever been built for any film before by creating miniatures for buildings, city streets, aircraft, landmarks, and monuments. The crew also built miniatures for several of the spaceships featured in the film, including a 30-foot (9.1 m) destroyer model and a version of the mother ship spanning [...] City streets were recreated, then tilted upright beneath a high-speed camera mounted on a scaffolding filming downwards. An explosion would be ignited below the model, and flames would rise towards the camera, engulfing the tilted model and creating the rolling [...] "wall of destruction" [...] look seen in the film. A model of the White House was also created, covering [...] by , and was used in forced-perspective shots before being destroyed in a similar fashion for its destruction scene.

2500|$|Chamberlain {{learned about}} his role in the Yankees {{rotation}} in November, and stated that knowing about the team's plans to use him as a starter rather than as a reliever who would move into a starting role {{at some point in the}} middle of the season (as was the case in 2008) changes his mental approach to preparing for the season, and makes things easier on him. [...] During the All-Star break, Chamberlain went back home to Lincoln, Nebraska to get his mind off things by playing with his son so he could [...] "be himself" [...] <b>and</b> <b>get</b> <b>more</b> confidence on the mound. [...] Chamberlain continued to struggle in the second half of the season. The Yankees considered demoting him to the minor leagues and leaving him off of the postseason roster, but the Yankees kept Chamberlain on the roster in a set-up role as the Yankees went with a three-man starting rotation en route to winning the 2009 World Series.|$|E
2500|$|According to Vikernes, the {{anonymous}} interview was planned {{by himself and}} Euronymous. The goal, he says, was to scare people, promote black metal <b>and</b> <b>get</b> <b>more</b> customers for Helvete. At the time, Burzum was about to release the Aske mini-album. Vikernes said of the interview: [...] "I exaggerated a lot and when the journalist left we [...] had a good laugh, because he didn't seem to understand that I was pulling his leg". He added that the interview revealed nothing that could prove his involvement in any crime. Vikernes claims that, after he was arrested, [...] "the journalist edited the interview and [...] published an insane version of it the following day, without even letting me read through it." [...] Some of the other scene members were also arrested and questioned, but all were released for lack of evidence. JÃ¸rn Inge Tunsberg of Hades said that the interview had [...] "grave consequences" [...] {{for the rest of}} the scene and that they did not know he was going to talk to the press, as [...] "he had said nothing". He added that they became [...] "bloody angry" [...] and he, Tunsberg, was [...] "pissed off".|$|E
2500|$|Mad Men {{featured}} {{a significant number}} of products and brands that existed both in the 1960s and at the time of airing, many of them shown as advertising clients, including Lucky Strike, Bethlehem Steel, Heineken, Volkswagen, Cadillac, Playtex, Chanel, Spam, Utz potato chips, Maidenform, Gillette, American Airlines and Clearasil. This led to widespread speculation that many or all of the products and brands on the show are the result of paid product placement. In fact, nearly all real products featured were included solely for purposes of realism, with no product placement deals behind them. Showrunner Matthew Weiner said in an interview: [...] "There is very little , and it is an illusion that is propagated by the network to try <b>and</b> <b>get</b> <b>more</b> business. It never works out... Literally I've named four [...] in four seasons and there have probably been a hundred products on the show. Half of them are made up, no one's paying to be on the show." [...] According to Weiner, the companies that did pay for product placement are Jack Daniel's, Heineken, Unilever and Hilton, though the last was only a payment of gratitude after a storyline involving Hilton had already aired.|$|E
