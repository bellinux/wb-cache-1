5|$|Eliot {{believed}} that Burnt Norton could benefit society. The poem's narration reflects on how humankind {{is affected by}} Original Sin, that they can follow the paths of either good or evil, {{and that they can}} <b>atone</b> <b>for</b> their sins.

5|$|The {{continued}} imprisonment of French soldiers was a {{major theme}} in the Vichy propaganda. Prisoners of war featured in the programme of moral rejuvenation promised {{as part of the}} Révolution nationale (National Revolution).

The period of detainment was therefore depicted as a form of purification which would overcome internal divides within France and <b>atone</b> <b>for</b> the defeat of 1940.|$|E

5|$|On 9th Dhu al-Hijjah before noon, pilgrims {{arrive at}} Arafat, a barren and plain land some 20 {{kilometers}} east of Mecca, {{where they stand}} in contemplative vigil: they offer supplications, repent on and <b>atone</b> <b>for</b> their past sins, and seek mercy of God, and listen to sermon from the Islamic scholars who deliver it from near Jabal al-Rahmah (The Mount of Mercy) from where Muhammad {{is said to have}} delivered his last sermon.

5|$|The {{premise of}} a repentant murderer seeking to <b>atone</b> <b>for</b> their actions {{appears to have}} been based on the real-life case of Albert Fish, who practised severe self-harm after killing twelve-year-old Grace Budd. Fish would insert needles into his {{perineum}} and force rose stems along his urethra to be forcibly pulled out. However, the actual murders may have been inspired by the case of Susan Smith, a mother of two who drowned her children by sinking her car in a lake. Mention is also made in the episode of Arthur Shawcross, whose recidivism is cited by Garry's prosecutors as an example of why murder should warrant a death penalty. Shawcross was released from prison after serving a sentence for killing two children, only to kill eleven women while on parole.|$|E

Victoria, now a widow, is once again able to marry Victor.|$|E
5|$|After this event, Vanille remains with Fang {{in crystal}} stasis within the pillar: from there, the two end up seeing {{everything}} that is going on, remaining unaffected by {{the changes in the}} timeline.

At the end of the game, they are rescued from the collapsing pillar. In Lightning Returns, Vanille has awoken from crystal stasis with Fang, gaining the ability to hear the voices of the dead. She is dubbed a saint and lives in the city of Luxerion in the protective care of the Order, a religious organization devoted to the deity Bhunivelze. Because of her ability, Vanille is key to a ritual to destroy the dead that will kill her in the process: not knowing the truth about the ritual, she decides to go through with it to <b>atone</b> <b>for</b> her past actions.
