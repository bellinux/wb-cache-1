40|$|IntroductionData on {{diabetes}} {{morbidity and}} mortality {{and the quality of}} care among U. S. minority populations are necessary to assess progress toward eliminating racial/ethnic disparities and to design and implement effective interventions. This paper summarizes the discussions and recommendations of an expert panel to address the use of survey data for diabetes surveillance among minority populations. MethodsThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Division of Diabetes Translation convened an expert panel of persons with survey experience and awareness of the problems in conducting health-related surveys among minority populations. Panel members were asked to 1) determine ways to enhance the ability of existing survey systems to <b>address</b> diabetes <b>surveillance</b> among minority populations; 2) identify survey systems {{that could be used to}} <b>address</b> <b>surveillance</b> needs; and 3) determine whether new minority-specific survey systems need to be developed. ResultsPanel members concluded that, although no existing survey system is completely adequate for diabetes surveillance among minority populations, new systems should not be developed. They recommended 1) investigating the use of community-based surveys; 2) exploring the ability of national surveys to increase sample sizes and produce state-level estimates; and 3) encouraging government agencies and public health programs to coordinate and integrate diabetes-related survey data and share analytic methodology. ConclusionNo existing survey is suitable for conducting minority-specific diabetes surveillance. Modifying and expanding existing surveys to establish a diabetes surveillance system of sentinel minority populations would be more feasible than developing a new one.

40|$|Streptococcus pneumoniae is {{a leading}} cause of {{morbidity}} and mortality in the United States, resulting each year in an estimated 3, 000 cases of meningitis, 50, 000 cases of bacteremia, 500, 000 cases of pneumonia, and 7, 000, 000 cases of otitis media. As with most respiratory pathogens, rapid, sensitive, and specific diagnostic tests are not available; thus, early in the course of illness, diagnosis of S. pneumoniae infection is usually presumptive, and the choice of antimicrobial therapy is nearly always empiric. In the past, isolates of S. pneumoniae were uniformly susceptible to penicillin; however, penicillin-resistant and multidrug-resistant strains have begin to emerge in the United States and are widespread in some communities. The full impact of the problem is unknown because infection with drug-resistant S. pneumoniae (DRSP) is not a reportable condition for most of the United States. To develop a strategy for minimizing the impact of DRSP, in June 1994, CDC convened a working group of public health practitioners, clinical laboratorians, health-care providers, and representatives of key professional societies.

Only in 1998 with the HRA did Article 8 become part of domestic law, so that “a general right to respect for private and family life [...] . was established in the UK ” (30).

40|$|The revelations by NSA {{whistleblower}} Edward Snowden have {{illustrated the}} scale and extent of digital surveillance carried out by different security and intelligence agencies. The publications {{have led to a}} variety of concerns, public debate, and some diplomatic fallout regarding the legality of the surveillance, the extent of state interference in civic life, and the protection of civil rights in the context of security. Debates about the policy environment of surveillance emerged quickly after the leaks began, but actual policy change is only starting. In the UK, a draft law (Investigatory Powers Bill) has been proposed and is currently discussed. In this paper, we will trace the forces and dynamics that have shaped this particular policy response. <b>Addressing</b> <b>surveillance</b> policy as a site of struggle between different social forces and drawing on different fields across communication policy research, we suggest eight dynamics that, often in conflicting ways, have shaped the regulatory framework of surveillance policy in the UK since the Snowden leaks. These include the governmental context; national and international norms; court rulings; civil society advocacy; technical standards; private sector interventions; media coverage; and public opinion. We investigate how state surveillance has been met with criticism by parts of the technology industry and civil society, and that policy change was required as a result of legal challenges, review commissions and normative interventions. However a combination of specific government compositions, the strong role of security agendas and discourses, media justification and a muted reaction by the public have hindered a more fundamental review of surveillance practices so far and have moved policy debate towards the expansion, rather than the restriction, of surveillance in the aftermath of Snowden...|$|R

Participants completed self-report measures of demographic information, body shame, body surveillance, body self-consciousness during sexual activity, and sexual satisfaction. Bivariate correlations suggested that body surveillance, body shame, and body self-consciousness during sexual activity were negatively correlated with sexual satisfaction.

40|$|In the {{framework}} of the CIRAD REVASIA research program, aimed at the improvement of methods for the evaluation of animal health surveillance systems, a interdisciplinary approach has been designed for <b>addressing</b> <b>surveillance‘s</b> social factors at local level. To that purpose, methodological inputs from epidemiology, economics and anthropology have been merged together in order to provide an innovative methodological pathway for the assessment and quantification of these factors at community level. Regarding the onset of the desired interdisciplinary approach, the first step was to bring the researchers into several brainstorming sessions aimed at defining a shared scientific and operational objective for this study. It was decided to settle two field sites in two different political, economical and social contexts: one in Vietnam and one in Thailand. Then, {{the next step was to}} bring all the concerned researchers into a common workshop dealing with participatory approaches applied to epidemiology. One of the main outcomes was to allow for the handling by the investigators of basic participatory investigation and visualization tools (mapping, diagrams, proportional piling, etc.) and qualitative data gathering. Then, the two field inquiry’s protocols were designed on the economical process at play in the field of livestock and animal health and the social and socio-­‐political dynamics at the community level. This communication will focus on the Thailand study, showing how an anthropology-­‐based study of the social, economical and political process in the community can highlight behavior rules in the context of animal diseases reporting. Indeed, the decision-­‐making process for reporting or not reporting a disease has been considered beyond the individual, as the result of a body of community influences referring to social factors. Thus, we have gone through a better understanding of (1) the community’s functioning patterns, (2) power relationships at play and social stakeholders’ networks and interactions (economical stakes, land tenure issues, political control etc.). In parallel, we showed some trends for health management practices and knowledge. The outputs of this study were an analysis of the social pressure that the stakeholders are subjected to in {{the framework}} of animal health management, a better understanding of the animal health information spreading scheme, and a typology of social stakeholders regarding surveillance. The research process, even if focusing on social and anthropological dynamics at play was interdisciplinary from the very beginning, merging together qualitative participatory investigation methods from sociology and economics, modeling and computer sciences, and epidemiology. Thus, pathways of individual motivation for reporting, based on social types, have been provided in order to highlight behavior rules associated to animal health surveillance systems.

This snapshot shows recent accomplishments and upcoming work. What are our priorities? The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) Musculoskeletal Disorders Prevention Program works with partners in industry, labor, trade associations, professional organizations, and academia to prevent work-related musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs). MSDs are soft-tissue injuries caused by sudden or sustained exposure to repetitive motion, force, vibration, and awkward positions. What do we do? 1. Surveillance: Locate and use unique sources of surveillance data (including surveys, insurance and workers compensation data), to identify and prioritize areas of needed MSD research for underserved worker populations. 2. Intervention Effectiveness: Develop and evaluate cost-effective interventions to prevent or minimize MSDs in the work-place. Many jobs with {{a high rate of}} MSDs (e. g., manual material handlers, nursing assistants, and hotel housekeepers) do not have effective programs, technologies, and strategies available to prevent MSDs. 3. Communication: Share new information, control technologies, and prevention methods through a variety of formats tailored to the needs of specific worker and employer populations. What have we accomplished? 1. Awarded funding to eight projects through an internal NIOSH competition that will <b>address</b> <b>surveillance,</b> intervention development, and communication needs. 2. Responded to an ergonomic and MSD-focused Health Hazard Evaluation request at a poultry processing plant. The NIOSH evaluation revealed that 81 % of the jobs involved levels of hand repetition and force that were above the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists Hand Action Limit. Also, 1 in 3 workers (34 %) had evidence of carpal tunnel syndrome. 3. Published the guidance document "Observation-based Posture Assessment: Review of Current Practice and Recommendations for Improvement," which helps practitioners assess working posture and prevent MSDs. What's next? 1. Administer a survey to three global professional ergonomist associations to study how NIOSH risk assessment tools are being used. 2. Evaluate workplace interventions for return on investment and for the effectiveness of reducing MSDs in collaboration with the Ohio Bureau of Worker's Compensation and other programs. 3. Complete a study on lower extremity MSDs in construction workers. 4. Use data from the National Health Interview Survey to study how often MSDs occur. 5.
