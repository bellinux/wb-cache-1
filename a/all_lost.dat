5|$|The {{prolonged}} and escalating ByzantineSassanid {{wars of the}} 6th and 7th {{centuries and}} the recurring outbreaks of bubonic plague (Plague of Justinian) left both empires exhausted and vulnerable {{in the face of}} the sudden emergence and expansion of the Arabs. The last of these wars ended with victory for the Byzantines: Emperor Heraclius regained <b>all</b> <b>lost</b> territories, and restored the True Cross to Jerusalem in 629.|$|E
5|$|From {{the early}} 12th century, French {{builders}} developed the Gothic style, {{marked by the}} use of rib vaults, pointed arches, flying buttresses, and large stained glass windows. It was used mainly in churches and cathedrals, and continued in use until the 16th century in much of Europe. Classic examples of Gothic architecture include Chartres Cathedral and Reims Cathedral in France as well as Salisbury Cathedral in England. Stained glass became a crucial element in the design of churches, which continued to use extensive wall-paintings, now almost <b>all</b> <b>lost.</b>|$|E
5|$|Several windows {{maintain}} their original shape and size. The original stained-glass decorations were almost <b>all</b> <b>lost</b> in the 1702 fire and were simply replaced by normal glass. The current stained-glass designs were added during the renovation {{at the end}} of the 19th century, most of them by the Gothenburg firm, Svenska Glasmåleri. The large windows above the portals depict the Trinity: God the Father over the west door, God the Son above the south door (the largest in the church), and God the Holy Spirit above the north door. Crafted in limestone, the rose window at the north portal is the oldest, unchanged since the 13th century.|$|E

5|$|When the Test {{team was}} announced, Tallon was {{overlooked}} as the selectors persisted with Oldfield. Tallon remained consistent for Queensland, making 22 dismissals in total for the season. With the bat, he once again topped his state's averages, scoring 434runs at 36.16. He scored 101 against South Australia and 96 against Victoria, but both matches were lost.

5|$|Apart {{from a few}} {{inscriptions}} and fragments, texts {{written by}} people who actually knew Alexander or who gathered information from men who served with Alexander were <b>all</b> <b>lost.</b> Contemporaries who wrote accounts of his life included Alexander's campaign historian Callisthenes; Alexander's generals Ptolemy and Nearchus; Aristobulus, a junior officer on the campaigns; and Onesicritus, Alexander's chief helmsman. Their works are lost, but later works based on these original sources have survived. The earliest of these is Diodorus Siculus (1st century BC), followed by Quintus Curtius Rufus (mid-to-late 1st century AD), Arrian (1st to 2nd century AD), the biographer Plutarch (1st to 2nd century AD), and finally Justin, whose work dated {{as late as the}} 4th century. Of these, Arrian is generally considered the most reliable, given that he used Ptolemy and Aristobulus as his sources, closely followed by Diodorus.|$|E

5|$|In 1970, {{ten years}} {{prior to the start of}} the game, {{suspected}} serial killer Yō Haibara kidnapped five girls from their rooms in a sanatorium on Rougetsu, an island south of Honshu. The girls were rescued from a cavern beneath the sanatorium by detective Chōshirō Kirishima, who had been pursuing Haibara, but they had <b>all</b> <b>lost</b> their memories. Two years later, a catastrophe strikes Rougetsu Island which kills off the inhabitants. Eight years later, in the present, two of the rescued girls have died in mysterious circumstances and two of the survivors, Misaki Asō and Madoka Tsukimori, return to discover the truth about their pasts. Despite being warned by her mother not to return to the island, fellow survivor Ruka Minazuki goes there to find Misaki and Madoka. Shortly before Ruka's arrival, Madoka is killed by hostile spirits. Chōshirō, the detective who rescued them, also returns to the island to both find Ruka and continue his pursuit of Haibara. During her exploration, Ruka learns that she and Misaki are suffering from a malady known as the Hidden Moon Disease, which affects their memories and identity and is spread by touch and vision. Each character also collects pieces of a mask used in a local ritual dance to ease the passing of souls into the afterlife. During the course of the story, it is revealed that Misaki arranged their return to the island so their illness might be cured, and that Chōshirō himself died ten years before, and is now helping the girls guided by the benevolent spirit of Ruka's mother Sayaka.|$|E
5|$|On 1 May 1669 Morgan and his {{flotilla}} {{attacked the}} Spanish squadron. The fire ship plan worked, and Magdalen was shortly aflame; Espinosa abandoned his flagship {{and made his}} way to the fort, where he continued to direct events. The second-largest Spanish ship, Soledad, tried to move away from the burning vessel, but a problem with the rigging meant they drifted aimlessly; privateers boarded the ship, fixed the rigging and claimed the craft as plunder. The third Spanish vessel was also sunk by the privateers. Morgan still needed to pass the San Carlos de la Barra Fortress, but was still out-gunned by the stronghold, which had the ability to destroy the privateer fleet if it tried to pass. The privateer decided to negotiate, and threatened to sack and burn Maracaibo if he was not allowed to pass. Although Espinosa refused to negotiate, the citizens of Maracaibo entered into talks with Morgan, and agreed to pay him 20,000 pesos and 500 head of cattle if he agreed to leave the city intact. During the course of the negotiations with the Maracaibos, Morgan had undertaken salvage operations on Magdalen, and secured 15,000 pesos from the wreck. Before taking any action, Morgan tallied his takings and divided it equally between his ships, to ensure that it was not <b>all</b> <b>lost</b> if one ship was sunk; it totalled 250,000 pesos, and a huge quantity of merchandise and a number of local slaves.|$|E

Abdelmoneim had been the 2010 African champion and had qualified for the Olympics by winning the African and Oceania qualification tournament. In London he lost to Georgia's Revaz Lashkhi and Russia's Zaur Kuramagomedov, eventual silver and bronze medalists respectively. El-Trabely was the 2011 African runner-up and was second in the African and Oceania qualification tournament behind Tunisia's Radhouane Chebbi. At the Games he lost against 2008 and 2012 Olympic champion Mijaín López of Cuba and Guram Pherselidze of Georgia. Mohamed Abouhalima, Islam Tolba, and Mohamed Abdelfatah <b>all</b> <b>lost</b> their opening bouts and were eliminated without appearing in the repechage.

In London he competed in the 96 kg class and qualified by coming in fifth at the 2011 World Championships.|$|E
50|$|Rowley's {{reputation}} as an author is grounded on his comedies; <b>All's</b> <b>Lost</b> by Lust is his only surviving tragedy.
