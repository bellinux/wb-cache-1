5|$|Recognizing {{that the}} men in {{leadership}} positions {{were likely to be}} wounded or killed, soldiers learned the jobs of those beside and above them. At the British First Army headquarters, a large-scale plasticine model of the Vimy sector was constructed and used to show commissioned and senior non-commissioned officers the topographical features of the battlefield and details of the German trench system. In addition, upwards of 40,000 topographical trench maps were printed and distributed to ensure that even platoon sergeants and section commanders possessed a wider awareness of the battlefield. These measures gave each platoon <b>a</b> <b>clearer</b> <b>picture</b> of how it fitted into the greater battle plan and in so doing, reduced the command and control problems that plagued First World War combat.|$|E

25|$|A very {{effective}} measure of both protection {{to both the}} staff and the patient of course is applying less radiation. There is always a trade-off between radiation dose and image quality. A higher x-ray dose leads to <b>a</b> <b>clearer</b> <b>picture.</b> Modern software technology can improve image quality during post-processing, such that the same image quality is reached with a lower dose. Image quality thereby is described by contrast, noise, resolution and artifacts. In general, the ALARA principle (as low as reasonably achievable) should be followed. Dose should be as low as possible, but image quality can only be reduced to the level that the diagnostic benefit of the examination is still higher than the potential harm to the patient.|$|E

The team wanted to go deeper and explore the possibility of there being a palace beneath the one Kempinski found. They managed to get <b>a</b> <b>clearer</b> <b>picture</b> of the entire MB palatial area up to the 1600s BC destruction, and recovered further wall plaster fragments. The structure underneath the MB II palace was determined most likely to be a palace itself, and further fragments of Aegean wall frescos and imported pottery were found, allowing the excavators to push back the time for contact with the Aegean and Cyprus to the MB I period. At the close of the dig season, the site was covered up to preserve it in the off-season.|$|E

[...] During Waddle's periscope search, Seacrest was busy operating other control room instruments and did not actively monitor his fire control displays. [...] After the periscope search was over, and hearing Waddle's report of no visual contacts, Seacrest decided that his information for S-13 was incorrect and manually respotted the S-13 contact on his screen to a distance of [...] away.|$|E

These texts contain descriptions of the culture and daily life of ancient India which can be corroborated from the Jain scriptures, and make the Buddha's time the earliest period in Indian history for which significant accounts exist. British author Karen Armstrong writes that although {{there is very little}} information that can be considered historically sound, we can be reasonably confident that Siddhārtha Gautama did exist as a historical figure.

2500|$|The 13th {{and early}} 14th centuries are {{generally}} regarded as the high period of scholasticism.

[...] Scholars such as Adelard of Bath travelled to Sicily and the Arab world, translating works on astronomy and mathematics, including the first complete translation of Euclid’s Elements. Powerful Norman kings gathered men of knowledge from Italy and other areas into their courts as a sign of their prestige. William of Moerbeke's translations and editions of Greek philosophical texts in the middle half of the thirteenth century helped in forming <b>a</b> <b>clearer</b> <b>picture</b> of Greek philosophy, and in particular of Aristotle, than was given by the Arabic versions they had previously relied on, which had distorted or obscured the relation between Platonic and Aristotelian systems of philosophy.

[...] At the same time, an experiment gone awry gave birth to Michiko, a digital life form that assumed control of Coil Domain—referred to in rumors as [...] "the other side". [...] Due to their inability to erase Coil Domain, Megamass opted to instead create a new layer of augmented reality space on top of Coil Domain, where the influence of Michiko and Imago was lessened in order to minimize the occurrence of dennō coil.

2500|$|Presently, {{there is}} no [...] "Somali" [...] option amongst the tick-box answers to the {{ethnicity}} question in the UK Census. Respondents who identify as Somali can, however, indicate this through a write-in response option. Following lobbying from Somali and other groups, a new [...] "Arab" [...] tick-box {{was introduced in the}} 2011 Census. According to sociologists Peter J. Aspinall and Martha Judith Chinouya, qualitative findings indicate that [...] "groups from northern Africa, the Horn of Africa, and some parts of the eastern coastline and islands of Africa may not identify themselves as black African. It was felt that they don't see themselves as black or African and might describe themselves by nationality specifically (eg, Somali or Sudanese), perhaps Afro-Arabs, or Arab-African". Aspinall and Lavinia Mitton note that [...] "those from Somalia may consider themselves to be Arab-African rather than Black African because of their religion and physical features". The Policy Research Centre argued that [...] "the inclusion of Arab will help refine the British Muslim picture as many Arabic speaking British citizens who are Muslim, as well as many who are not, could not find an appropriate category, and selecting from 3 or 4 near matches". However, it cautioned that [...] "the new Arab ethnic category will give us <b>a</b> <b>clearer</b> <b>picture,</b> but could confuse the Somali ethnic count this may lead to challenges in accurately sizing citizens of Somali heritage. Such respondents will have to choose between Arab as a linguistic choice and Black African as a geographical and/or racial choice. Moreover, because of such community drives to get Somalis more noticed, it is likely Somali responses under the Black section will be split between African and Other Black". Question testing with Somalis in Wales {{in the run-up to the}} census revealed inconsistent answering of the ethnicity question. Some Somali participants in the test ticked the [...] "African" [...] box, others wrote in [...] "Somali", and one person ticked both [...] "African" [...] and [...] "Arab". Some Somali participants in both Wales and England believed that there was a need for a Somali tick-box, whereas others felt that the African option was sufficient. No Somali, Egyptian, Berber, Kurdish or Iranian respondents chose to identify solely as Arab. Similarly, question testing with Somalis in Scotland found that [...] "Somalian" [...] was the most frequent write-in response under [...] "African", with few respondents choosing to write-in [...] "Black". [...] "Somalian" [...] was also the most common write-in response under [...] "Other ethnic group".|$|E
