5|$|Even {{before the}} {{appearance}} of Barber's sketches, other designs were being considered for the half dollar. In early August, artist Frank Millet proposed to the fair's Director of Decorations, Olin Warner, that Warner design the coin. Warner modeled one depicting <b>a</b> <b>profile</b> <b>of</b> Columbus, not based on the Lotto portrait. His reverse showed a caravel ship, symbolizing the Santa María, Columbus's flagship, above two globes representing the hemispheres, though they lacked the continental outlines. Warner's proposal was praised by artists working on their sculptures at the fairgrounds. Leech also weighed in once he returned from vacation on August 26, sending fair organizers a woodcut engraving based on the official Spanish medal for the 400th anniversary of Columbus' first voyage, and arranging with the State Department for the American Embassy in Madrid to get one. A medal was duly obtained and was subsequently placed in the Mint's collection.|$|E

40|$|Concerning the {{strategic}} manipulability of the stable matching {{produced by the}} Gale–Shapley algorithm, Kobayashi and Matsui recently considered the existence problem <b>of</b> <b>a</b> preference <b>profile</b> <b>of</b> women, that is, given <b>a</b> preference <b>profile</b> <b>of</b> men, find <b>a</b> preference <b>profile</b> <b>of</b> women that makes the Gale–Shapley algorithm produce the prescribed complete matching of men and women. Reformulating this problem by introducing the set of proposals to be made through {{the execution of the}} algorithm, and switching the roles of men and women, we consider the existence problem <b>of</b> <b>a</b> preference <b>profile</b> <b>of</b> men and show that the problem is reduced to a problem of checking if a directed graph is a rooted tree and it is solvable in polynomial time. We also show that the existence problem <b>of</b> preference <b>profiles</b> <b>of</b> both sexes when a set of proposals is given is solvable in polynomial time...|$|R
