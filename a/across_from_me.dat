Oh, I know it was whisky and rum and youth that made the heat of me; but there, in that moment, the mad mind of me resolved, if she spoke to him and yielded to dance with him first, that I would put both my hands around his throat and throw him down and under the wahine surf there beside us, and drown and choke out his life and the obstacle of him that stood between me and her.

60|$|We sat {{at table}} on the lotus-eating veranda, served by the {{butterfly}} maids, and ate strange foods and partook of a nectar called poi. But the dream threatened to dissolve. It shimmered and trembled like an iridescent bubble about to break. I was just glancing out at the green grass and stately trees and blossoms of hibiscus, when suddenly I felt the table move. The table, and the Madonna <b>across</b> <b>from</b> <b>me,</b> and the veranda of the lotus-eaters, the scarlet hibiscus, the greensward and the trees--all lifted and tilted before my eyes, and heaved and sank down into the trough of a monstrous sea. I gripped my chair convulsively and held on. I {{had a feeling that}} I was holding on to the dream as well as the chair. I should not have been surprised had the sea rushed in and drowned all that fairyland and had I found myself at the wheel of the Snark just looking up casually from the study of logarithms. But the dream persisted. I looked covertly at the Madonna and her husband. They evidenced no perturbation. The dishes had not moved upon the table. The hibiscus and trees and grass were still there. Nothing had changed. I partook of more nectar, and the dream was more real than ever.|$|E

He was desperately in earnest and I felt more wretched than I ever did in my life. I couldn't promise him that--why, even if there was no {{question}} of Ken, I don't care for Fred that way and never could--but it seemed so cruel and heartless to send him away to the front without any hope of comfort. I cried like a baby; and yet--oh, I am afraid that there must be something incurably frivolous about me, because, {{right in the middle of}} it all, with me crying and Fred looking so wild and tragic, the thought popped into my head that it would be an unendurable thing to see that nose <b>across</b> <b>from</b> <b>me</b> at the breakfast table every morning of my life. There, that is one of the entries I wouldn't want my descendants to read in this journal. But it is the humiliating truth; and perhaps it's just as well that thought did come or I might have been tricked by pity and remorse into giving him some rash assurance. If Fred's nose were as handsome as his eyes and mouth some such thing might have happened. And then what an unthinkable predicament I should have been in! ...|$|E
60|$|Something {{broke the}} perfect {{stillness of the}} pool near the {{opposite}} shore. A fish had leaped at some unseasonable insect on the surface, {{or one of the}} overhanging trees had dropped a dead twig upon it, and in the lazy doubt which it might be, I lay and watched the ever-widening circle fade out into fainter and fainter ripples toward the shore, till it weakened to nothing in the eye, and, so far as the senses were concerned, actually ceased to be. The want of visible agency in it made me feel it all the more a providential illustration; and because the thing itself was so pretty, and because it was so apt as a case in point, I pleased myself a great deal with it. Suddenly it repeated itself; but this time I grew a little impatient of it, before the circle died out in the wider circle of the pool. I said whimsically to myself that this was rubbing it in; that I was convinced already, and needed no further proof; and at the same moment the thing happened a third time. Then I saw that there was a man standing {{at the top of the}} amphitheatre just <b>across</b> <b>from</b> <b>me,</b> who was throwing stones into the water. He cast a fourth pebble into the centre of the pool, and then a fifth and a sixth; I began to wonder what he was throwing at; I thought it too childish for him to be amusing himself with the circle that dispersed itself to naught, after it had done so several times already. I was sure that he saw something in the pool, and was trying to hit it, or frighten it. His figure showed black against the sunset light, and I could not make it out very well, but it held itself something like that of a workman, and yet with a difference, with an effect as of some sort of discipline; and I thought of an ex-recruit, returning to civil life, after serving his five years in the army; though I do not know why I should have gone so far afield for this notion; I certainly had never seen an ex-recruit, and I did not really know how one would look. I rose up, and we both stood still, as if he were abashed in his sport by my presence. The man made a little cast forward with his hand, and I heard the rattle as of pebbles dropped among the dead leaves.|$|E

It's hard to remember what sort of effect this movie might have had on you when you were six or seven. But try to remember.

5000|$|During {{his service}} with Jasta 15, Udet later wrote he had {{encountered}} Georges Guynemer, a notable French ace, in single combat at 5000 m. Guynemer, who preferred to hunt enemy planes alone, {{by this time}} was the leading French ace with more than 30 victories. Udet saw Guynemer and they circled each other, looking for an opening and testing each other's turning abilities. They were close enough for Udet to read the [...] "Vieux" [...] of [...] "Vieux Charles" [...] written on Guynemer's Spad S.VII. The opponents tried every aerobatic trick they knew and Guynemer fired a burst through Udet's upper wing, however maneuvered for advantage. Once Udet had Guynemer in his sights, his machine guns jammed and while pretending to dogfight he pounded on them with his fists, desperate to unjam them. Guynemer realized his predicament and instead of taking advantage of it, simply waved a farewell and flew away. Udet wrote of the fight, [...] "For seconds, I forgot that the man <b>across</b> <b>from</b> <b>me</b> was Guynemer, my enemy. It seems as though I were sparring with an older comrade over our own airfield." [...] Udet felt that Guynemer had spared him because he wanted a fair fight, while others {{have suggested that the}} French ace was impressed with Udet's skills and hoped they might meet again on equal terms.|$|E

As to how his mortal character would interact with an Amazon, Pine stated [...] "When I first read the script, it had elements of Romancing the Stone, kind of a very classic fish out of water.

50|$|At {{the time}} I joined they were {{meeting at the}} Lambs Club in New York. It was an actor's club, which was {{actually}} a copy of an actor's club in London. When the NCS started, Rube Goldberg, Russell Patterson and Bob Dunn had become very friendly {{with a lot of}} actors. Goldberg had even done a couple of movies and Dunn was on early TV doing a program called Quick on the Draw. They had gotten the club to allow them to use the premises as a meeting place for cartoonists. When I joined, they had what they called a Shepherd - after all, the meetings were at the Lambs Club - who was the president, Billy Gaxton. The meetings were monthly, and there would be a dinner afterwards. There was always a lot of drinking going on. For Pete's sake, there was a bar right there in the meeting room. In order to get the meeting going, they would always have to pry the guys away from the bar. The first guy I met, sitting right <b>across</b> <b>from</b> <b>me</b> at my first dinner, was Raeburn Van Buren. He was the creator of Abbie an' Slats, and this was always a strip I liked. What was so nice was that even though he was much older, he just talked to me like a fellow professional. At that first meeting there was Al Capp, Walt Kelly, Alex Raymond, Ernie Bushmiller, Milton Caniff, all of them just sitting there, big as life. As I went to more meetings, I got to talk to a few of them. To me, it was unreal that so many legends were just standing around talking shop and gossip with each other. They were all, so, let's just say, normal. These were guys I had idolized for years.|$|E

40|$|The {{electronic}} structure of Me[N(CN) $_ 2 $]$_ 2 $ (Me=Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu) molecular magnets {{has been investigated}} using x-ray emission spectroscopy (XES) and x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) as well as theoretical density-functional-based methods. Both theory and experiments show that {{the top of the}} valence band is dominated by Me 3 d bands, while a strong hybridization between C 2 p and N 2 p states determines the valence band {{electronic structure}} away from the top. The 2 p contributions from non-equivalent nitrogen sites have been identified using resonant inelastic x-ray scattering spectroscopy with the excitation energy tuned near the N 1 s threshold. The binding energy of the Me 3 d bands and the hybridization between N 2 p and Me 3 d states both increase in going <b>across</b> the row <b>from</b> <b>Me</b> = Mn to Me = Cu. Localization of the Cu 3 d states also leads to weak screening of Cu 2 p and 3 s states, which accounts for shifts in the core 2 p and 3 s spectra of the transition metal atoms. Calculations indicate that the ground-state magnetic ordering, which varies across the series is largely dependent on the occupation of the metal 3 d shell and that structural differences in the superexchange pathways for different compounds play a secondary role.

Unfortunately for the Signatures Of the Rome Statute United Nations member states instituting the ICC 2 ̆ 6 ICTY housed at the Hague, insofar as the, Radovan Karadzic, as with the other Hague cases awaiting trial there, I personally witnessed these United Nations member states having a substantial conversations, and, openly speaking about trading judicial appointments and verdicts for financial funding when I attended the 2001 ICC Preparatory Meetings at the UN in Manhattan making the iCTY and ICC morally incapable trying Radovan Karazdic and others. I witnessed with my own eyes and ears when attending the 2001 Preparatory Meetings to establish an newly emergent International Criminal Court, the exact caliber of criminal corruption running so very deeply at the Hague, that it was a perfectly viable topic of legitimate conversation in those meetings I attended to debate trading verdicts AND judicial appointments, for monetary funding. Jilly wrote:*The rep from Spain became distraught and when her country’s proposal was not taken to well by the chair of the meeting, then Spain argued in a particularly loud and noticably strongly vocal manner, “Spain (my country) strongly believes if we contribute most financial support to the Hague’s highest court, that ought to give us and other countries feeding it financially MORE direct power over its decisions. ” ((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((Instead of censoring the country representative from Spain for even bringing up this unjust, illegal and unfair judicial idea of bribery for international judicial verdicts and judicial appointments, all country representatives present in the meeting that day all treated the Spain proposition as a ”totally legitimate topic” discussed and debated it between each other for some time. I was quite shocked! The idea was “let’s discuss it. ” "It’s a great topic to discuss. " Some countries agreed with Spain’s propositions while others did not. The point here is, bribery for judicial verdicts and judicial appointments was treated as a totally legitimate topic instead of an illegitimate topic which it is in the meeting that I attended in 2001 that day to establish the ground work for a newly emergent international criminal court.)))))))))))))))))))))))))))) In particular., since “Spain” was so overtly unafraid in bringing up this topic of trading financial funding the ICC for influence over its future judicial appointments and verdicts in front of every other UN member state present that day at the UN, “Spain” must have already known by previous experience the topic of bribery was “socially acceptable” for conversation that day. They must have previously spoke about bribing the ICTY and ICC before in meetings; this is my take an international sociological honor student. SPAIN’s diplomatic gesture of international justice insofar as, Serbia, in all of this is, disgusting morally!SPAIN HAS TAUGHT THE WORLD THE TRUE DEFINITION OF AN “INTERNATIONAL CRIMINAL COURT. ” I represented the state interests’ of the Former Yugoslavia, in Diplomat Darko Trifunovic’s absence in those meetings and I am proud to undertake this effort on Serbia’s behalf.
