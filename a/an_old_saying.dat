500|$|Milk's {{reception}} by the gay {{political establishment}} in San Francisco was icy. Jim Foster, who had by then {{been active in}} gay politics for 10 years, resented the newcomer's asking for his endorsement for a position as prestigious as city supervisor. Foster told Milk, [...] "There's <b>an</b> <b>old</b> <b>saying</b> in the Democratic Party. You don't get to dance unless you put up the chairs. I've never seen you put up the chairs." [...] Milk was furious at the patronizing snub, and the conversation {{marked the beginning of}} an antagonistic relationship between the [...] "Alice" [...] Club and Harvey Milk. Some gay bar owners, still battling police harassment and unhappy with what they saw as a timid approach by Alice to established authority in the city, decided to endorse him.|$|E
500|$|Nelson's fleet reached Syracuse in Sicily on 19 July {{and took}} on {{essential}} supplies. There the admiral wrote letters describing {{the events of}} the previous months: [...] "It is <b>an</b> <b>old</b> <b>saying,</b> 'the Devil's children have the Devil's luck.' I cannot find, or at this moment learn, beyond vague conjecture where the French fleet are gone to. All my ill fortune, hitherto, has proceeded from want of frigates." [...] Meanwhile, the French were securing Egypt by the Battle of the Pyramids. By 24 July, the British fleet was resupplied and, having determined that the French must be somewhere in the Eastern Mediterranean, Nelson sailed again {{in the direction of the}} Morea. [...] On 28 July, at Coron, Nelson finally obtained intelligence describing the French attack on Egypt and turned south across the Mediterranean. His scouts, HMS Alexander and HMS Swiftsure, sighted the French transport fleet at Alexandria on the afternoon of 1 August.|$|E
500|$|Food was eaten from wooden or pewter trenchers with two-tined forks, large spoons, {{and hunting}} knives. Dishware was not popular {{since it was}} easily {{breakable}} and tended to dull knives quickly. Unlike the Quakers and Puritans, feasting {{with an abundance of}} food and drink was never discouraged and practiced as often as was feasible. Generally, backcountry cuisine did not share the religious austerity of the North nor the refinement of the South and was therefore denigrated by outsiders. An apparent lack of fastidiousness in preparing the food provoked further criticism from many sources. The Anglican Woodmason characterized backcountry cooking as [...] "exceedingly filthy and most execrable". Others told of matrons washing their feet in the cook pot, that it was considered unlucky to wash a milk churn and that human hairs in butter were considered a sign of quality. [...] These descriptions seem to be confirmed by <b>an</b> <b>old</b> <b>saying</b> attributed to Appalachian housewives: [...] "The mair [...] dirt the less hurt". Another expression of backcountry hardiness was the lack of appreciation of coffee and tea. Both were described as mere [...] "slops" [...] and were deemed appropriate only for those who were sick or unfit for labor.|$|E

2500|$|Some data {{indicates}} that the castes among Muslims have never been as rigid as that among Hindus. <b>An</b> <b>old</b> <b>saying</b> also goes in Bangladesh [...] "Last year I was a Julaha (weaver); this year a Shaikh; and next year if the harvest be good, I shall be a Sayyid.". However, other scholars, such as Ambedkar, disagreed with this thesis.|$|E
2500|$|The failed {{invasion}} severely embarrassed the Kennedy administration, {{and made}} Castro wary of future US intervention in Cuba. On 21 April, in a State Department press conference, President Kennedy said: [...] "There's <b>an</b> <b>old</b> <b>saying</b> that victory has a hundred fathers and defeat is an orphan... Further statements, detailed discussions, {{are not to}} conceal responsibility because I'm the responsible officer of the Government..." ...|$|E
2500|$|Most of the {{residents}} are Sunni Muslims, although some districts of the city are exclusively Christian. Hama is reputed {{to be the most}} conservative Sunni Muslim city in Syria since French Mandate times. During that period there was <b>an</b> <b>old</b> <b>saying</b> reflecting this characteristic: [...] "In Damascus, it takes only three men to make a political demonstration, while in Hama it takes only three men to get the town to pray." [...] The Christian population mostly adheres to the Greek Orthodox Church or the Syriac Orthodox Church.|$|E

2500|$|As one of {{the most}} {{polluted}} cities in China, Chongqing, with over 100 days of fog per year, is also known as the [...] "Fog City" [...] (...) , and a thick layer of fog shrouds it for 68 days per year during the spring and autumn. [...] "There is <b>an</b> <b>old</b> <b>saying</b> in China, probably two thousand years old, that 'a Szechuen dog barks at a sun,' because the sun so seldom appears," [...] During the Second Sino-Japanese War, this special weather possibly played a role in protecting the city from being overrun by the Imperial Japanese Army.|$|E
2500|$|Ranges {{of hills}} {{in the north}} and south are {{separated}} by a central valley. The northern plain, by contrast, is relatively flat, consisting mainly of deposits from glacial advances from western Scotland during colder times. There are more recently deposited shingle beaches at the northernmost point, the Point of Ayre. The island has one mountain higher than , Snaefell, with a height of [...] According to <b>an</b> <b>old</b> <b>saying,</b> from the summit one can see six kingdoms: those of Mann, Scotland, England, Ireland, Wales, and Heaven.

[...] The world was at peace again and everyone thought, [...] "Ah, the Berlin Wall's come down and it's all gonna be fun and games, a party every night," [...] and you can see now that it's not that way. [...] It's just our way of saying the world's not perfect and never will be.|$|E

2500|$|In {{fact the}} group of 50 were volunteers on Terminus whose role was to be {{captured}} and give that impression, so that the Seldon Plan {{would be able to}} continue unimpeded. The Second Foundation itself is finally revealed to be located on the former Imperial Homeworld of Trantor itself. The clue [...] "at Star's End" [...] was not a physical clue, but instead based on <b>an</b> <b>old</b> <b>saying,</b> [...] "All roads lead to Trantor, and that is where all stars end". Seldon, being a social scientist and not a physical one, placed the two Foundations at [...] "opposite ends" [...] of the galaxy, but in a sociological rather than physical sense – the first Foundation was located in the Periphery of the galaxy where the Empire's influence was minimal, while the Second Foundation was on Trantor itself, where, even in its dying days, the Empire's power and culture was strongest.|$|E
2500|$|The car was badged {{and sold}} {{as both a}} Dodge and a Plymouth in the United States and Canada; in Mexico was sold as Dodge and Chrysler, and in Europe, Australia and other export markets it was sold as the Chrysler Neon. At the Neon's release, then {{president}} of Chrysler Corporation Bob Lutz said, [...] "There's <b>an</b> <b>old</b> <b>saying</b> in Detroit: 'Good, fast, or cheap. Pick any two.' We refuse to accept that." [...] The Japanese press touted the Neon as the [...] "Japanese car killer", due to a spiralling Yen and the lower production cost of the Neon. The Neon received praise for its appearance, price, and power when compared to competing cars such as the Honda Civic DX at , the Civic EX at , the Nissan Sentra at , the Ford Escort ZX2 at , the Toyota Corolla at , the Saturn S-Series at [...] for SOHC variants and [...] for DOHC variants, and the Chevrolet Cavalier Base and LS models at , among others. Car and Driver tested the DOHC 5-speed equipped Neon R/T and reported that it could run 0-60 in 7.6 seconds and 15.9 seconds in the quarter mile. First-generation Neons were competitive in SCCA Solo autocross and showroom-stock road racing.|$|E

Yet {{there is}} <b>an</b> <b>old</b> <b>saying</b> about turning the other cheek, <b>an</b> <b>old</b> <b>saying,</b> a saying so {{impossible}} {{that the world}} has never been able {{to get it out of}} its mind.
