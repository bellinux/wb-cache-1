And as to you and Amelia, if you would send any of your young men to try, there couldn't be anything more of that kind, could there?

40|$|Independet {{silent reading}} - Out of old habit or a lesson with purpose?  The {{aim of this}} study was to examine whether {{teachers}} use the method of independent silent reading purposefully or if they do it out of old habit. The research focuses on what purpose the teachers have and which working methods they use when working with silent reading. I investigated who it is that chooses the books to be read and what factors are determining this choise. Finally, I wanted to find out how the silent reading time is used by the pupils and the teachers. In order to investigate this, observations were made in classes during silent reading time and semistructured interviews were conducted with teachers and students. The results show that most teachers have a clear purpose with silent reading and that they work with different reading strategies to teach the children to become independent silent readers. However, an important part of succeeding in silent reading is that it happens on a regular basis, preferably every day.     Finally, I would like to thank my supervisor Yvonne Knospe, university lecturer at the Department of Language Studies, Umeå University for all the feedback and guidence during the work process. It has been <b>a</b> <b>pleasure</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>you</b> as a supervisor. Thank you...|$|E
