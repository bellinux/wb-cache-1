500|$|In March, 2015 the Nuclear Waste Administration Act of 2015 (S854) was {{introduced}} in the U.S. Senate. Its was intended establish a fully independent Nuclear Waste Administration (NWA) which would develop nuclear waste storage and disposal facilities. Construction of such facilities would require the consent of the state, local,and tribal governments which would be affected. The NWA would be required to complete a mission plan to open a pilot storage facility by 2021 for nuclear waste from non-operating reactors and other [...] "emergency" [...] deliveries (called “priority waste”). The goal would be to have a storage facility for waste from operating reactors or other “non-priority waste” available by 2025, and an actual permanent repository by the end of 2048. The current disposal limit of 70,000 metric tons for the nation’s initial permanent repository would be repealed. Any nuclear waste fees collected after S854 was enacted would be held in a newly established Working Capital Fund. The Nuclear Waste Administration would be allowed to draw from that fund any amounts needed to carry out S.854, unless limited by <b>annual</b> <b>appropriations</b> or authorizations.|$|E
500|$|Under the Morrill Act, {{states were}} obligated {{to fund the}} {{maintenance}} of land grant college facilities, but were not obligated to fund operations. [...] Subsequent laws required states to match federal funds for agricultural research stations and cooperative extension. [...] In his inaugural address as Cornell's third president on November 11, 1892, Jacob Gould Schurman announced his intention to enlist the financial support of the state. [...] Until that point, Cornell's relationship with the state was a net economic loss. Cornell was offering full scholarships to four students in each New York assembly district every year and was spending funds {{to serve as the}} state's land-grant university. It determined to convince the state to become a benefactor of the university, instead. [...] In 1894, the state legislature voted to give financial support for the establishment of the New York State College of Veterinary Medicine and to make <b>annual</b> <b>appropriations</b> for the college. [...] This set the precedents of privately controlled, state-supported statutory colleges and cooperation between Cornell and the state. The annual state appropriations were later extended to agriculture, home economics, and following World War II, industrial and labor relations.|$|E

2500|$|Reconciliation is a {{procedure}} created in 1974 {{as part of}} the congressional budget process.

[...] The Senate may then consider a budget reconciliation bill, not subject to filibuster, that reconciles funding amounts in any <b>annual</b> <b>appropriations</b> bills with the amounts specified in the budget resolution. [...] However, under the [...] Byrd rule no non-budgetary [...] "extraneous matter" [...] may be considered in a reconciliation bill.

2500|$|In {{its early}} years, the college {{was at least}} {{nominally}} public—the college's founders had envisaged it as the Western Shore branch of a proposed University of Maryland but a lack of enthusiasm from the Maryland General Assembly and its Eastern Shore counterpart, Washington College, made this largely a paper institution. After years of inconsistent funding and litigation, the College accepted a smaller annual grant in lieu of being funded through the state's <b>annual</b> <b>appropriations</b> process.

2500|$|The United States Department of Energy (USDOE) has {{announced}} {{the selection of}} Navistar Corporation for a cost-shared award of up to $10 million to develop, test, and deploy plug-in hybrid electric (PHEV) school buses. The project aims to deploy 60 vehicles for a three-year period in school bus fleets across the nation. The vehicles will be capable of running in either electric-only or hybrid modes and will be recharged from a standard electrical outlet. Because electricity will be their primary fuel, they will consume less petroleum than standard vehicles. To develop the PHEV school bus, Navistar will examine a range of hybrid architectures and evaluate advanced energy storage devices, {{with the goal of}} developing a vehicle with a [...] electric range. Travel beyond the [...] range will be facilitated by a clean Diesel engine capable of running on renewable fuels.
