5|$|By 11 May 1942, the Red Army {{was able}} to {{allocate}} six armies under two fronts, amongst other units. The Soviet Southwestern Front had the 21st Army, 28th Army, 38th Army and the 6th Army. By 11 May, the 21st Tank Corps had been moved into the region with the 23rd Tank Corps, with another 269 tanks. There were also three independent rifle divisions and <b>a</b> <b>rifle</b> regiment from the 270th Rifle Division, concentrated in the area, supported by the 2nd Cavalry Corps in Bogdanovka.

50|$|Another {{option is}} to use <b>a</b> <b>rifled</b> choke in <b>a</b> smooth-bore barrel, at least for {{shotguns}} having a removable choke tube. Rifled chokes are considerably less expensive than <b>a</b> <b>rifled</b> shotgun barrel, and a smooth-bore barrel paired with <b>a</b> <b>rifled</b> choke is often nearly as accurate as <b>a</b> <b>rifled</b> shotgun barrel dedicated for use with slugs. There are many options in selecting shotguns for use with slugs.|$|R

In contrast, <b>a</b> fully automatic <b>rifle</b> continuously fires rounds {{as long as the}} trigger is pressed and there is ammunition left.|$|R

Two of her crew were killed, and more were wounded. One of the wounded was Captain Buchanan, whose left thigh was pierced by <b>a</b> <b>rifle</b> shot.|$|E

50|$|This {{weapon is}} often {{referred}} to as a musketoon but due to it having <b>a</b> <b>rifled</b> barrel is more accurately <b>a</b> short <b>rifle.</b> This mistake is prevalent in the popular literature probably due to the misnomer being applied to a Parker Hale reproduction.|$|R

5|$|A set of {{fourteen}} redesigned Major Arcana tarot cards, {{based on the}} Rider-Waite deck, were commissioned by the singer for the album's artwork.

The cover itself represents The Hanged Man.|$|E
