Incidentally, the earliest appearance of the signature Lissitzky (...) emerged in the handmade UNOVIS Miscellany, issued in two copies in March–April 1920, and containing his manifesto on book art: [...] "the book enters the skull through the eye not the ear therefore the pathways the waves move at much greater speed and with more intensity. if i (sic) can only sing through my mouth with <b>a</b> <b>book</b> <b>i</b> (sic) can show myself in various guises." ...|$|E
500|$|Entertainment Weekly {{in their}} review said that [...] "uneven pacing and tone mar an {{intriguing}} cautionary tale. This collaboration, completed before Clarke's death last March, would've made a better solo project for either author." [...] The Washington Post said that [...] "The Last Theorem {{reads like a}} dog-eared album of favorite themes from yesteryear", referring to Clarke and Pohl topics from the authors' earlier works. Thomas M. Wagner at SF Reviews wrote that [...] "The Last Theorem is <b>a</b> <b>book</b> <b>I</b> really resent not liking, because there's so much about it that deserves to be liked." [...] He said that the first two-thirds is [...] "so good ... it almost, but doesn't quite, {{make up for the}} nonsense that overtakes the whole affair at the climax." [...] Wagner felt that the meeting of [...] "two disparate storytelling sensibilities" [...] was [...] "far less harmonious and compatible" [...] than Clarke and Pohl may have imagined. Wagner summed up by saying that [...] "The Last Theorem is not simply an uneven novel. It's a deeply disjointed one, a book that introduces a host of wonderful ideas and sympathetic, believable characters, only to decide it doesn't trust them to carry off the story in the end, ultimately falling back – disastrously – on dated and dubious formula." [...] Sheila Merritt at SciFi Dimensions said that while it should have been [...] "a fine tribute and a fitting farewell to this master of science fiction", {{it turned out to be}} an [...] "easy book to put down." [...] She said that the plot [...] "meanders in fits and starts" [...] and that the book is too long for the story it tells. Ed Park of the Los Angeles Times enjoyed the first third of the book, but said that for the rest, its [...] "winning and winking self-consciousness evaporates." [...] He wondered how stable the manuscript was when it was published, and added that it does nothing to [...] "burnish the legacy of either of its authors." ...|$|E

2500|$|Fan {{reaction}} to leaked news that Spock {{would be killed}} was overwhelmingly negative, and one fan paid for advertisements urging Paramount to abandon the plan.

But now that I've seen how it was accomplished, I {{think it was a}} very good idea." [...] Some fans even went so far as to issue death threats against Leonard Nimoy's family. Bennett explained, [...] "For some reason fans got the impression that [...] wanted Spock dead. He'd written <b>a</b> <b>book</b> <b>I</b> Am Not Spock, and that gave people the idea. Anyway, when a fringe group of Trekkies learned that we were going to kill the Spock character, it was like we'd taken a child of theirs onto the Brooklyn Bridge with the intention of throwing it off. And their reaction was, 'Let's get Leonard.'" ...|$|E

2500|$|Australia {{proceeded}} to the 1953 Ashes tour, travelling to England aboard the Orcades after leaving Australia in late March. They almost {{did so with}} their three main bowlers marooned in an Italian jail. During a stopover at Naples on the sea voyage to England, Miller had taken Lindwall and Johnston to watch a rehearsal of La Boheme at the Teatro di San Carlo. The trio ignored the doorkeeper's attempt to stop them attending what {{was meant to be}} a private rehearsal, and proceeded inside to the auditorium. When they attempted to return to the boat, they found that the doorkeeper had locked them inside and called the police. Lindwall broke the door's lock and the pacemen ran back to the dock just before the gangplank was being pulled away. The Australians arrived at Southampton after four weeks at sea. He was embroiled in further controversy when Bumper, a book that he had produced with his ghost-writer Dick Whitington, criticised his captain Hassett as being too cautious. The book commented that [...] "Hassett deals, or fails to deal with things as they occur". Early on the tour, the Evening News ran the headline [...] "Keith Miller Criticises his Captain". The poker-faced Hassett kept his cool at a welcome reception hosted by the Journalists' Association, introducing Miller to the guests by saying [...] "There is Keith Miller, whom you all know well.
