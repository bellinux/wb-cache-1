At 0000UTC on 2 <b>April,</b> <b>the</b> Bureau of Meteorology (BOM) warning centre in Perth classified the low as Tropical Cyclone Inigo. The storm quickly intensified as it tracked southwestward, aided by low wind shear and strong divergence. An eye featured gradually organised, and early on 3 <b>April</b> <b>the</b> BOM classified Inigo as a severe tropical cyclone with winds of 80mph (130km/h). Later that day, the cyclone underwent rapid intensification {{as the eye}} became increasingly better defined. On 4 April, Inigo attained Category5 status on the Australian cyclone scale, and at 0600UTC it reached peak winds of 240km/h (150mph) and an estimated minimum pressure of 900hPa (mbar) while located about 950km (590mi) north of Onslow, Western Australia. Around the same time, the JTWC assessed Inigo as a powerful cyclone with 1-min winds of 260km/h (160mph). With a minimum pressure of 900hPa, Inigo tied Cyclone Gwenda of the 1998–99 season as the most intense tropical cyclone on record in the Australian cyclone region.|$|E
