40|$|Here we {{describe}} the identification and preliminary characterization of {{a new class of}} pyrrolo(imidazo) quinoxaline hydrazones as flurescent probes for Aβ 1 - 42 fibrils. All the newly developed compounds were able to bind amyloid fibrils formed in vitro and some of them displayed an increase of their fluorescence upon binding. When tested on brain tissue preparations presenting Aβ deposits, the described hydrazones selectively stained amyloid structures and did not display <b>aspecific</b> <b>binding.</b> The hydrazones did not show antifibrillogenic activity and electron microscopy analysis revealed that they do not interfere with fibrils structure. The described pyrrolo(imidazo) quinoxalines could be useful for studying amyloid structures in vitro. Moreover, their experimentally proven ability to cross the blood-brain barrier in mouse opens the possibility of developing these compounds as potential amyloid imaging agents for in vivo applications...|$|E
40|$|The {{aminoglycoside}} antibiotics bind to the 16 S bacterial rRNA and {{disturb the}} protein synthesis. One to four hydroxyl {{functions of the}} small aminoglycoside neamine were capped with phenyl, naphthyl, pyridyl, or quinolyl rings. The 3 ', 4 - (6), 3 ', 6 - (7 a), and the 3 ', 4 ', 6 - (10 a) 2 -naphthylmethylene derivatives appeared to be active against sensitive and resistant Staphylococcus aureus strains. 10 a also showed marked antibacterial activities against Gram (-) bacteria, including strains expressing enzymes modifying aminoglycosides, efflux pumps, or rRNA methylases. 7 a and 10 a revealed a weak and <b>aspecific</b> <b>binding</b> to a model bacterial 16 S rRNA. Moreover, its compared to neomycin B, 10 a showed a lower ability to decrease H- 3 leucine incorporation into proteins in Pseudomonas aeruginosa. All together, out, {{results suggest that the}} 3 ', 4, 6 -tri- 2 -naphthylmethylene neamine derivative 10 a should act against Gram (-) bacteria through it mechanism different from inhibition of protein synthesis, probably by membrane destabilization...|$|E
40|$|Investigations of {{molecular}} bonds between single molecules and molecular complexes by {{the dynamic force}} spectroscopy are subject to large fluctuations at nanoscale and possible other <b>aspecific</b> <b>binding,</b> which mask the experimental output. Big efforts are devoted to develop methods for effective selection of the relevant experimental data, before taking the quantitative analysis of bond parameters. Here we present a methodology {{which is based on}} the application of graph theory. The force-distance curves corresponding to repeated pulling events are mapped onto their correlation network (mathematical graph). On these graphs the groups of similar curves appear as topological modules, which are identified using the spectral analysis of graphs. We demonstrate the approach by analyzing a large ensemble of the force-distance curves measured on: ssDNA-ssDNA, peptide-RNA (system from HIV 1), and peptide-Au surface. Within our data sets the methodology systematically separates subgroups of curves which are related to different intermolecular interactions and to spatial arrangements in which the molecules are brought together and/or pulling speeds. This demonstrates the sensitivity of the method to the spatial degrees of freedom, suggesting potential applications in the case of large molecular complexes and situations with multiple binding sites...|$|E
40|$|Rheumatoid {{factors are}} {{antibodies}} directed against IgG that may confound immunogenicity testing for therapeutic monoclonal antibodies. We developed antigen-binding assays to monitor anti-drug-antibody (ADA) responses against infliximab and adalimumab using F(ab') 2 {{fragments of the}} drug. This avoids possible detection of rheumatoid factor activity. During development of these assays, a number of sera from patients before treatment {{as well as several}} healthy control sera were tested positive. None of these sera contained antibodies specific for the therapeutic mAb. Instead, they were found to contain anti-hinge antibodies. We demonstrate that this <b>aspecific</b> antibody <b>binding</b> can be inhibited by adding F(ab') 2 of intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG), which consists of pooled polyclonal IgG derived from plasma. Using this protocol, anti-infliximab antibodies can be measured specifically without interference by anti-hinge antibodies. (C) 2011 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserve...|$|R
40|$|Stable isotope {{labeling}} is {{at present}} {{one of the}} most powerful methods in quantitative proteomics. Stable isotope labeling has been performed at both the protein as well as the peptide level using either metabolic or chemical labeling. Here, we present a straightforward and cost-effective triplex quantification method that is based on stable isotope dimethyl labeling at the peptide level. Herein, all proteolytic peptides are chemically labeled at their alpha- and epsilon-amino groups. We use three different isotopomers of formaldehyde to enable the parallel analysis of three different samples. These labels provide a minimum of 4 Da mass difference between peaks in the generated peptide triplets. The method was evaluated based on the quantitative analysis of a cell lysate, using a typical "shotgun" proteomics experiment. While peptide complexity was increased by introducing three labels, still more than 1300 proteins could be identified using 60 microg of starting material, whereby more than 600 proteins could be quantified using at least four peptides per protein. The triplex labeling was further utilized to distinguish specific from <b>aspecific</b> cAMP <b>binding</b> proteins in a chemical proteomics experiment using immobilized cAMP. Thereby, differences in abundance ratio of more than two orders of magnitude could be quantified...|$|R
40|$|The {{ability of}} drugs to cause uroporphyria in hepatocytes from 17 -day-old chick embryos has been {{investigated}} and {{the response of the}} cells in culture compared with that of the intact liver of the embryos in ovo. In this chick-embryo system, drugs that cause accumulation of uroporphyrin within 19 - 24 h can only do so in culture; in contrast, 2 -allyl- 2 -isopropylacetamide and 3, 5 -diethoxycarbonyl- 1, 4 -dihydrocollidine, which stimulate production of protoporphyrin, are effective both in culture and in ovo. A role of exogenous iron in worsening drug-induced uroporphyria was demonstrated in cultures of hepatocytes; iron also caused preferential accumulation of uroporphyrin from added 5 -aminolaevulinate {{in the absence of a}} porphyrogenic chemical. Uroporphyria was induced in cultures of hepatocytes by drugs of widely different structures, suggesting that the primary molecular target with which they interact may be relatively <b>aspecific</b> in its <b>binding</b> characteristics. These results are briefly discussed, and two alternative hypotheses for the drug-induced effect in uroporphyrinogen metabolism are considered...|$|R
40|$|Integration of retro viral DNA Into {{the host}} {{chromosome}} requires the integrase protein (IN). We overexpressed the IN proteins of human immunodeficiency viruses types 1 and 2 (HIV- 1 and HIV- 2) in E. coll and purified them. Both proteins {{were found to}} specifically cut two nucleotides off the ends of linear viral DNA, and to integrate viral DNA into target DNA. This demonstrates that HIV IN is the only protein required for integration of HIV DNA. Although {{the two types of}} IN proteins have only 53 % amino acid sequence similarity, they act with equal efficiency on both type 1 and type 2 viral DNA. Binding of IN to DNA was tested: purified IN does not bind very specifically to viral DNA ends. Nevertheless, only viral DNA ends are cleaved and integrated. We interpret this as follows: in vitro quick <b>aspecific</b> <b>binding</b> to DNA is followed by slow specific cutting and integration. IN can not find viral DNA ends in the presence of an excess of aspecific DNA; in vivo this is not required since the IN protein is in constant proximity of viral DNA in the viral core particle...|$|E

Therefore, it is of utmost importance to lower the limit of detection (LOD) of the method used and to obtain the results within hours to few days. Biosensor methods exploit the available technologies to individuate and provide an approximate quantification of the bacteria present in a sample. The main bottleneck of these methods depends on the <b>aspecific</b> <b>binding</b> to the surfaces and on a change in sensitivity when bacteria are in a complex food matrix with respect to bacteria in a liquid food sample. In this review, we introduce surface plasmon resonance (SPR), new advancements in SPR techniques, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), as fluorescence-free biosensing technologies for detection of L. monocytogenes in foods. The application of the two methods has facilitated L. monocytogenes detection with LOD of 1 log CFU/mL. Further advancements are envisaged through the combination of biosensor methods with immunoseparation of bacteria from larger volumes, application of lab-on-chip technologies, and EIS sensing methods for multiplex pathogen detection. Validation efforts are being conducted to demonstrate the robustness of detection, reproducibility and variability in multi-site installations...|$|E
40|$|AbstractMolecular {{imprinting}} is {{a technique}} {{that is used to}} create artificial receptors by the formation of a polymer network around a template molecule. This technique has proven to be particularly effective for molecules with low molecular weight (< 1500  Da), and {{during the past five years}} the number of research articles on the imprinting of larger (bio) templates is increasing considerably. However, expanding the methodology toward imprinted materials for selective recognition of proteins, DNA, viruses and bacteria appears to be extremely challenging. This paper presents a critical analysis of data presented by several authors and our own experiments, showing that the molecular imprinting of proteins still faces some fundamental challenges. The main topics of concern are proper monomer selection, washing method/template removal, quantification of the rebinding and reproducibility. Use of charged monomers can lead to strong electrostatic interactions between monomers and template but also to undesired high <b>aspecific</b> <b>binding.</b> Up till now, it has not been convincingly shown that electrostatic interactions lead to better imprinting results. The combination of a detergent (SDS) and AcOH, commonly used for template removal, can lead to experimental artifacts, and should ideally be avoided. In many cases template rebinding is unreliably quantified, results are not evaluated critically and lack statistical analysis. Therefore, it can be argued that presently, in numerous publications the scientific evidence of molecular imprinting of proteins is not convincing...|$|E
40|$|International audienceIn situ {{hybridization}} is {{a widely}} employed technique allowing spatial visualization of gene expression in fixed specimens. It has greatly advanced our understanding of biological processes, including developmental regulation. In situ protocols are today routinely followed in numerous laboratories, and although details might change, they all include a hybridization step, where specific antisense RNA or DNA probes anneal to the target nucleic acid sequence. This step is generally carried out at high temperatures and in a denaturing solution, called hybridization buffer, commonly containing 50 % (v/v) formamide – a hazardous chemical. When applied to the soft-bodied hydrozoan medusa Clytia hemisphaerica, we found that this traditional hybridization approach was not fully satisfactory, causing extensive deterioration of morphology and tissue texture which compromised our observation and interpretation of results. We thus tested alternative solutions for in situ detection of gene expression and, inspired by optimized protocols for Northern and Southern blot analysis, we substituted the 50 % formamide with an equal volume of 8 M urea solution in the hybridization buffer. Our new protocol not only yielded better morphologies and tissue consistency, but also notably improved {{the resolution of the}} signal, allowing more precise localization of gene expression and reducing aspecific staining associated with problematic areas. Given the improved results and reduced manipulation risks, we tested the urea protocol on other metazoans, two brachiopod species (Novocrania anomala and Terebratalia transversa) and the priapulid worm Priapulus caudatus, obtaining a similar reduction of <b>aspecific</b> probe <b>binding.</b> Overall, substitution of formamide by urea during in situ hybridization offers a safer alternative, potentially of widespread use in research, medical and teaching contexts. We encourage other workers to test this approach on their study organisms, and hope that they will also obtain better sample preservation, more precise expression patterns and fewer problems due to aspecific staining, as we report here for Clytia medusae and Novocrania and Terebratalia developing larva...|$|R
40|$|Bacterial viruses or ‘bacteriophages’, {{the natural}} enemies of bacteria, {{have long since}} been {{considered}} an alternative to antibiotics to treat bacterial infections. This {{has led to the}} characterization of a high number of phages, which genomes contain a high number of genes with unknown functions. During millions of years of co-evolution a fraction of these genes have evolved to inhibit, activate and redirect the host towards efficient phage production, often through protein-protein interactions. As such, these newly characterized genomes provide a rich source of potentially interesting biotechnological and antibacterial proteins. To investigate this, a set of Pseudomonas phages were characterized and their early genes cloned in the bacterial genome by our research group. The goal of this dissertation was to identify early phage proteins that impact relevant bacterial processes for the development of phage-derived applications and to better understand the underlying biology. As an opportunistic human pathogen, known for its high and still increasing antibiotic resistance, there is a dire need for novel antibacterials against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. To this end, three previously identified toxic proteins were investigated in terms of understanding the mode of action for their toxicity and their potential in the development of novel small-molecule antibiotics. The most promising protein was LUZ 24 gp 9, which interacts with the gyrase B subunit and inhibits gyrase activity. Although {{we were not able to}} determine its 3 D-structure, we could identify two amino acids, essential for the interaction. Our results enable the use of an interaction-based screen to identify lead molecules for the development of novel antibacterials. Next, we determined the 3 D-structure of LUZ 7 gp 14, which shares homology to the OB-fold found in ssDNA binding proteins. Indeed, LUZ 7 gp 14 displayed an <b>aspecific</b> DNA <b>binding</b> capacity with a preference for ssDNA. We now propose that LUZ 7 gp 14 is a functional homologue of a previous identified aspecific ssDNA-binding protein in N 4. The final protein, LUZ 7 gp 8, seems to have no bacterial interaction partner. Despite this it is an interesting protein for antibacterial development, as it is bacteriolytic and triggers cell wall permeabilisation. Thanks to the small size (8 kDa), a peptidomimetic might be the road to take with this protein to turn it into a phage-derived antibacterial. Biofilms are complex surface-attached multicellular structures, which protect the bacteria against predation and other environmental stresses. Hence, they have a detrimental impact in industrial systems (e. g. water systems) and also enable environmental bacteria (e. g. Pseudomonas) to successfully infiltrate our health care. Since P. aeruginosa is often used as model organism for Gram-negative biofilm formation, we set out to investigate if its phages encode proteins that might help us to combat these biofilms. Screening our library of 180 early phage genes for altered biofilm formation and excluding proteins previously found as antibacterial, identified a total of 35 proteins that significantly increased (15) or decreased (17) biofilm formation. To our knowledge, this is the first large-scale screen to identify early phage genes specifically targeting biofilm formation. Four phage proteins cause a > 30 % decrease in biofilm mass and of LUZ 7 gp 33 the 3 D structure is known, making it the top priority for the development of a novel antibiofilm peptide or small molecule if an interaction is required. Intriguingly, the Pbunalikevirus LMA 2 encodes the other three proteins, which indicates variability between phages in their impact on biofilm formation. We also identified four phage proteins that influence c-di-GMP signaling. YuA gp 44, a predicted diguanylate cyclace (DGC) with the active site GGDEF, triggers wrinkled colony morphology. While 14 - 1 gp 11, interacts with the membrane-bound DGC YfiN (PA 1120) and has two close homologues (LMA 2 gp 11. 1 & LBL 3 gp 11. 1). Bacteria expressing these genes lose their motility, constistent with an increased activity of YfiN, and the deletion of YfiN abolishes 14 - 1 gp 11 activity. Our hypothesis is that the interaction with 14 - 1 gp 11 causes conformational changes in YfiN to activate its DGC domain. The resulting spike of c-di-GMP can trigger dispersion, to allow phage progeny to escape the biofilm matrix and maximize its chances to encounter new hosts. As an application, 14 - 1 gp 11 could be a novel motility inhibitor to prevent establishment and spread of infections in fast-flow areas, e. g. bladder. In a third part, we wanted to investigate the uncharted territory of host metabolism take-over to identify novel tools for metabolic engineers to overcome bottlenecks in the host metabolism during the optimization of the production of a desired endproduct. In a way, phages do exactly the same to optimize viral replication and encode their own genetic toolbox for this. For this we first looked at the changing metabolic content of phage-infected P. aeruginosa cells, within a single infection cycle, for six phages and found phage-specific alterations of the host metabolism. A clear distinction can be made between ‘leeching’ phages, which take all existing resources for viral replication (e. g YuA), and phages that actively modulate the metabolism, by redirecting the cell’s metabolism to produce new resources required for phage production (e. g. phiKZ). We could show that metabolic pathways, targeted by phage-encoded auxiliary metabolic genes (AMGs), are statistically enriched in the set of metabolites changing upon infection. Hence, each specific set of AMGs will result in a unique metabolic phenotype. Thus not only the occurrence of phage infection but also the diversity of the phages present will impact the net metabolic effect of phage infections in complex bacterial populations. In the future, high-throughput metabolomics could identify novel ‘metabolic modulators’, which also enable linking the observed metabolic effects during infection to these encoded AMGs. Finally, we describe for the first time two phage-encoded acetyltransferases (LUZ 19 gp 13 & gp 28) that use reversible lysine acetylation to alter host protein function during infection, which adds a, never before reported, layer of complexity to phage-host interactions. LUZ 19 gp 13 strongly acetylates two lysines in MetE and, to a lesser extent, two lysines in MetK. Upon expression of LUZ 19 gp 13, a rapid increase in the level of 5 ’-methylthioadenosine (MTA) and adenine was observed via metabolome analysis. While MetE and MetK are involved in the synthesis of S-adenosylmethionine (SAM), essential for polyamine biosynthesis, MTA and adenine are by-products of polyamine biosynthesis. We hypothesize that acetylation by gp 13 activates MetE or/and MetK to increase SAM production and polyamine biosynthesis, which can be used as counter-ion for DNA packaging. From a biotechnological point of view, LUZ 19 gp 13 might be an interesting metabolic modulator to construct a superior strain for the production of SAM, a frequently used supplement in the US and Canada. LUZ 19 gp 28 triggers the cleavage of the α subunit from the RNAP complex, between Gln 244 -Glu 245 in the flexible linker domain. This physical disconnection of the αCTD from the RNAP complex during late infection does not resemble any known mechanism of viral transcriptional shutdown. While acetylation was suspected to alter the substrate specificity of a host cytoplasmic protease, we could not identify large differences in the acetylation level of a single protease. In contrast, acetylation seemed to target two proteins of fatty acid biosynthesis (DesA and PA 5174). We now propose that Gp 28 shuts down de novo fatty acid biosynthesis, leading to oxidative stress that triggers an ‘emergency break’ of transcription by αRNAP cleavage. Once the bacterium has coped with the stress, normal transcription is restored. Preliminary data fits this hypothesis, however more research is required. Our broad approach to mine the enormous biotechnological potential embedded in the sequences of phage genomes, resulted in the find of some promising leads for phage-derived applications, e. g. the gyrase-binding LUZ 24 gp 9 as antibacterial, LUZ 7 gp 33 as novel biofilm inhibitor and LUZ 19 gp 13 as metabolic modulator. As these results originate from a library of a mere 150 early phage genes, the potential present in the virome might be an endless source for phage-based applications. Especially for antibacterial development, a bacteriophage-based platform for new target discovery and drug development could offer a solution to stay ahead of the inevitable development of microbial resistance. Aside from these potential applications, we managed to get a wealth of insights into phage biology. In the future, one of our leads will have to be developed to a finished application, proving the potential for the development of phage-derived applications towards industry. This could then hopefully trigger a shift in the focus of the bacteriophage research field from its current genome-orientation, towards the molecular investigation of these intracellular phage-host interactions during infection. From a more fundamental view, these increased efforts will also help to fill the gap between functional analyses of bacteriophage genes and the booming number of uncharacterized novel phage genome sequences. These will be exciting times as we will get a better understanding and appreciation for the complexity of viral replication at the system’s level. nrpages: 199 status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|When {{incubated}} with 3 H-astemizole, {{a potent}} antagonist of H 1 receptor, cultured rat hepatocytes, {{which do not}} express specific receptors for this ligand, avidly take up 3 H-label proportionally to the drug concentration. HPLC analysis indicates that at 10 ng 3 H-astemizole/ml, cells almost entirely deplete the culture medium of the drug within 4 hr of incubation. At 37 degrees, astemizole is metabolized and released into the culture medium mainly under the form of glucuronoconjugated metabolites. Differential centrifugation of homogenates from hepatocytes incubated with 3 H-astemizole indicates that astemizole and unconjugated metabolites {{are found in the}} particulate fraction, whereas astemizole and conjugated metabolites are present in the cytosol. Isopycnic centrifugation on sucrose gradient shows that the major part of the 3 H-label in the particulate fraction distributes like phospholipids and NADPH cytochrome c reductase, suggesting an association with membranes and, in particular, with the endoplasmic reticulum. Chloroquine, a drug accumulating within lysosomes and acidic endosomes, decreases the uptake of 3 H-astemizole by hepatocytes and induces, during isopycnic centrifugation of a particulate fraction, a shift of the 3 H-label towards lower densities where it closely accompanies cathepsin B. This suggests that a minor part of astemizole accumulated in the hepatocytes could be trapped within lysosomes. These results could support the hypothesis that <b>aspecific</b> <b>binding</b> of astemizole to cellular membranes and, to a lesser extent, trapping in lysosomes could {{play a role in the}} pharmacokinetics of the drug...|$|E
40|$|Cell wall invertases (cwINVs), {{with a high}} {{affinity}} for the cell wall, are fundamental enzymes in the control of plant growth, development and carbon partitioning. Most interestingly, defective cwINVs have been described in several plant species. Their highly attenuated sucrose hydrolyzing capacity {{is due to the}} absence of Asp 239 and Trp 47 homologues, crucial players for stable binding in the active site and subsequent hydrolysis. However, so far the precise roles of such defective cwINVs remain unclear. In this manuscript, we report on the functional characterization of tobacco Nin 88, a presumed fully active cwINV playing a crucial role during pollen development. It is demonstrated here that Nin 88, lacking both Asp 239 and Trp 47 homologues, has no invertase activity. This was further supported by modeling studies and site-directed mutagenesis experiments, introducing both Asp 239 and Trp 47 homologues, leading to an enzyme with a distinct sucrose hydrolyzing capacity. In vitro experiments suggest that addition of Nin 88 counteracts the unproductive and rather <b>aspecific</b> <b>binding</b> of tobacco cwINV 1 (NtcwINV 1) to the wall, leading to higher activities in the presence of sucrose and a more efficient interaction with its invertase inhibitor CIF. A working model is presented based on these findings, allowing speculation on the putative role of Nin 88 in muro. The results presented in this work are an important first step towards unraveling the specific roles of plant defective cwINVs. status: publishe...|$|E
30|$|While {{keeping in}} mind that the aim of {{predicting}} ftb is to improve decision making in the selection of PET-tracer candidates, a discussion is warranted on the agreement between predicted and observed ftb at a quantitative level. The deviation from perfect agreement, which is seen as scatter around the line of identity in Figure 3, is not marginal and represents a combined `error' from several sources. Obviously, the simple model used for ftb (Eq. 3) may not always be sufficient to describe the full complexity of non-specific and specific binding as they occur in vivo. There is also considerable measurement-related error that is invariably associated with the approach taken in this study: to combine experimental data for typically three independent measurements/reports (Bmax, Kd, and Vu,brain) and compare with a PET-derived value of ftb, also carrying a measurement error. Considering that the accuracy of experimental methods such as those relating to Bmax, Kd and Vu,brain are sometimes regarded as `within 3 -fold'; {{it would seem that the}} predictions are no worse than should be expected from experimental error alone. An illuminating example is [11 C]DASB for which the reported Kd values ranged between 0.2 and 3.5 nM, corresponding to predicted ftb values between 0.86 to 0.26. In this instance, the extreme value of 3.5 nM was used for Kd because it was the first encountered human value, despite the resulting in miss-classification as non-functioning. Another noteworthy example from this dataset is PK 11195, which was misclassified by the model as non-functioning. Despite being a widely used marker for neuroinflammation, PK 11195 binding in the brain has a relatively high non-specific component and was even designated as a non-functioning tracer by Zhang et al. in a recent publication [10]. In favor of the discriminating ability of the current model, the second generation TSPO radioligand PBR 28 was ranked higher than PK 11195. Nevertheless, PK 11195 has some clinical utility, partly associated with its genotype <b>aspecific</b> <b>binding,</b> which should not be disregarded in this context.|$|E
40|$|Molecular {{imprinting}} is {{a technique}} to create template-shaped cavities in polymer matrices with memory of the template molecules, {{to be used in}} molecular recognition. Molecular imprinting of low molecular weight compounds is a well established technique used to create high affinity materials. On the other hand, molecular imprinting of high molecular weight compounds such as proteins is not nearly as successful for various reasons. Nevertheless, the use of hydrogels has led to some encouraging protein imprinting results. A hydrogel consists of a three dimensional polymer network that is able to retain large amounts of water with conservation of the network structure. As a result of the high water content, hydrogels are generally considered as biocompatible materials, which makes them particularly interesting for biomedical and pharmaceutical applications. In this thesis, an innovative method to prepare hydrogel nanoparticles with protein imprints on their surface is proposed. Polyacrylamide nanoparticles were prepared inside the internal aqueous compartment of liposomes, prepared by detergent removal. Macroscopic hydrogel formation due to polymerization of the monomers outside the liposomes was prevented by inhibition of free-radical polymerization of non-encapsulated monomers by addition of ascorbic acid. This method offers straightforward control over the shape and size of the particles. Moreover, the liposomal bilayer offers the possibility to incorporate membrane proteins, which can then be used as templates for surface imprinting. It is shown that SN/GpA is successfully incorporated in the liposomal bilayer. Importantly, the hydrophilic domain of SN/GpA was oriented towards the internal compartment of the liposome, and therefore would be available for the formation of imprints. However, despite many attempts towards the synthesis of PINAPLES, a proof of concept was not obtained. This is partially due to {{the current state of the}} art of protein imprinting. Protein imprinting is still a relatively new scientific field. Although the number of research papers that describe protein imprinting is increasing, the actual scientific proof of the feasibility of selective recognition of proteins by molecular imprinted polymers in aqueous environment is not convincing. Electrostatic interaction between protein and hydrogel network can cause high <b>aspecific</b> <b>binding,</b> and may therefore not be suited for molecular imprinting. However, this strong interaction may be useful as a tool for controlled release of therapeutic proteins from pharmaceutical formulations. Charged hydrogels were obtained by copolymerization of methacrylated dextran (Dex-MA) with either methacrylic acid (MA) or 2 -N,N-dimethylaminoethyl methacrylate (DMAEMA). The effect of incorporation of the charged monomers on hydrogel charge, equilibrium swelling and release of model proteins was assessed both at low (10 mM HEPES) and physiological ionic strength (HEPES buffered saline, HBS). It was concluded that incorporation of charge in a hydrogel network can be used for the immobilization of proteins and triggered release by increasing ionic strength. Next, it was shown that these reversible charge interactions can be exploited for efficient post-loading and release of proteins that are negative, positive or neutral at physiological pH. Importantly, as opposed to conventional loading during preparation of the hydrogel, no chemical modification to the protein occurred using this loading method...|$|E
