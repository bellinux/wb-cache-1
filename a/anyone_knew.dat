25|$|In August 1997, Bruce {{received}} {{a telephone call}} from friends Rob Van Dam and Sabu. They asked if he and Utsler could appear on Extreme Championship Wrestling (ECW)'s second pay-per-view (PPV) program, Hardcore Heaven. Bruce and Utsler were already fans of ECW, as Van Dam had been sending videotapes of the show to them since its first airing. They agreed to appear and went to Florida to discuss the ECW program's content with Van Dam, Sabu, and Paul Heyman. Heyman was pleased that Bruce and Utsler were former wrestlers, which meant that they could surprise the crowd by taking bumps. Heyman also favored the idea of using Insane Clown Posse, because it was unlikely that <b>anyone</b> <b>knew</b> of the relationship the group had with Van Dam and Sabu. Heyman presented his idea to Bruce and Utsler, who agreed to participate. Insane Clown Posse opened the ECW program by performing songs and exciting the crowd. Then Van Dam and Sabu, the main villains at the time, attacked Bruce and Utsler. The top fan favorite, The Sandman, came in and saved them by chasing away Van Dam and Sabu with his signature Singapore cane.|$|E
500|$|DAAS employ an aggressive, confrontational style, which {{author and}} {{journalist}} Geoff Bartlett describes as [...] " [...] {{the boundaries of}} humour and good taste to their absolute limits". They frequently delve into topical and taboo subject matter with songs such as [...] "Commies for Christ" [...] and [...] "I Fuck Dogs". [...] "Long before <b>anyone</b> <b>knew</b> the term, one of our greatest driving forces was to be politically incorrect," [...] said Ferguson. Each band member developed distinctive onstage characters, with McDermott adopting a nasty, mean persona, while Ferguson played a narcissistic character who was [...] "gorgeous but stupid". Fidler initially played the straight man, but as the group became more aggressive he developed into a character who was naturally happy and caring but frequently victimised by his fellow band members.|$|E
500|$|The Sonics from Tacoma had a raunchy, hard-driving {{sound that}} {{influenced}} later acts such as Nirvana and the White Stripes. According to Peter Blecha, they [...] "were the unholy practitioners of punk rock long before <b>anyone</b> <b>knew</b> {{what to call}} it". [...] Founded in 1960, they eventually enlisted the services of vocalist Gerry Rosalie and saxophonist Rob Lind and proceeded to cut their first single," [...] The Witch" [...] in 1964. [...] The song was re-issued again in 1965, {{this time with the}} even more intense [...] "Psycho" [...] on the flip side. [...] They released several albums and are also known for other [...] "high-octane" [...] rockers such as [...] "Cinderella" [...] and [...] "He's Waitin. Prompted by the Sonics, the Wailers entered the mid-1960s with a harder-edged sound in the fuzz-driven [...] "Hang Up" [...] and [...] "Out of Our Tree".|$|E

500|$|On May 17, blogger Saundra Mitchell posted {{an entry}} to her blog mocking people who faked {{illnesses}} on the internet. Though {{she did not}} initially name Kaycee Nicole, {{the next day she}} published another commentary which did explicitly name her and suggested that in fact, Kaycee Nicole had never existed. She cited the nearly impossible haste with which Kaycee had been interred, noting that even if Kaycee had not been autopsied – which was dependent upon the manner of her death and whether there was a doctor attending – the two days that Debbie claimed that gathering of mourners, memorial service, and cremation had been accomplished in was unlikely; [...] Mitchell also noted a number of inconsistencies in the backstory about Kaycee's cancer. Mitchell, working off Kaycee's [...] "internet address", traced the girl's location to Peabody, Kansas. She called around the town, asking if <b>anyone</b> <b>knew</b> of someone of Kaycee's description who had died recently. No one did.|$|E
500|$|The game's title {{stems from}} Sumerian mythology, {{particularly}} {{the myth of}} the ocean goddess Tiamat and the fresh water god Abzu uniting to form all life: a reason this was chosen was that myths surrounding land-based life and their supposed origins in a cosmic ocean were a recurring theme in multiple world mythologies. The title is made up of the words [...] "Ab" [...] (water) and [...] "Zû" [...] (to know), translated by the developers as [...] "Ocean of Wisdom". The word provided difficulties early on, as the Sumerian spelling [...] "Abzu" [...] differed from the Akkadian spelling [...] "Apsû". As a compromise, the team merged the two spellings into the game's title. The circumflex over the letter [...] "u" [...] caused problems for the team as hardly <b>anyone</b> <b>knew</b> how to type it and the computer programs had trouble handling it as part of the coding. The use of the word played into the game's focus on the ocean due to its mythic connections. The Middle Eastern influences extended to the game's architecture, and incorporated Nava's wish for structures to have meaning beyond being simple scenery or tools for player progression.|$|E
500|$|The band made {{an attempt}} to begin writing for a {{follow-up}} and had written and began recording one song titled [...] "Circle of the Noose", {{but it was never}} completed or officially released. The song, which is the last to feature guitar work from Navarro prior to his departure, was a tribute to the late qawwali-devotional singer Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan. Navarro described the song as totally pop, dirge-like and said the song was one of the favorite songs he had done with the band. He said [...] "The best way I can describe it is it's like pepped- up '60s folk with '90s ideals, but I would hate to label it as folk because it's not, it moves." [...] On June 7, 2011, Navarro was asked by a Chili Peppers fan on his blog about [...] "Circle of the Noose" [...] and said he didn't have the recordings but would love to hear them. Flea was also asked in 2011 through his Twitter page about the song and was shocked that <b>anyone</b> <b>knew</b> about it. He responded by saying [...] "Holy cow! how in the hell do you know about that? It had a sample of nusrat fateh Ali khan in it...never was finished". On February 3, 2016, a rough mix of [...] "Circle of the Noose", which had been recorded on March 16, 1998, was leaked to the internet. Dave Navarro tweeted [...] "WOW what a trip down memory lane" [...] in response to the leak.|$|E

2500|$|Despite having Kevin Harvick {{filling his}} {{rearview}} mirror, Dale Earnhardt, Jr. {{was able to}} maintain the lead to complete the first Pocono sweep since Denny Hamlin did it in 2006. [...] "We definitely went home from the last race and made our car better," [...] Earnhardt Jr. said [...] "That's what I'm proud of this team for. It takes a really, really smart guy to understand {{what to do to}} take those gambles. Sometimes they pay off, sometimes they don't." [...] "This hasn't been one of my better race tracks and the cars have been fast both races here," [...] Harvick said after finishing runner-up.

2500|$|It's {{doubtful}} that <b>anyone</b> <b>knew</b> {{it would become}} the most popular rock song of all time. After all, it's eight minutes long and was never released as a single. Even [...] "Hey Jude" [...] was shorter, was a 45, and enjoyed the benefits of comprehensible words and a sing-along chorus. But [...] "Hey Jude" [...] isn't the most requested song of all time on FM rock stations. Nobody ever had a [...] "Hey Jude" [...] theme prom or played the song at weddings and funerals like [...] "Stairway". [...] "Stairway" [...] couldn't succeed today. Back in 1971, FM deejays prided themselves on digging deep into albums {{to come up with}} oddball, cultish favorites. With its near-oppressive length, erratic changes, and woo-woo lyrics, the quasi-medieval anthem was a perfect choice. It continues to be a favorite among music listeners who are younger than the song itself, listeners who, in some cases, were no doubt conceived while the tune blasted from car speakers.|$|E
2500|$|In September 2016, {{during the}} first presidential debate, Trump said he doubted whether <b>anyone</b> <b>knew</b> who hacked the DNC, and disputed Russian interference. During the second debate, Trump said there {{might not have been}} hacking at all, and {{questioned}} why accountability was placed on Russia. During the third debate, Trump rejected Clinton's claim that Putin favored Trump. After the election, Trump rejected the CIA analysis and asserted that the reports were politically motivated to deflect from the Democrats' electoral defeat. Trump's transition team said in a brief statement: [...] "These are the same people that said Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction." [...] However, the intelligence analysts involved in monitoring Russian activities are different from those who assessed that Iraq had stockpiles of weapons of mass destruction, while post–Iraq War reforms have made it less likely for similar errors to reach {{the highest levels of the}} U.S. intelligence community. Trump dismissed reports of Russia's interference, calling them [...] "ridiculous"; he placed blame on Democrats upset over election results for publicizing these reports, and cited Julian Assange's statement that [...] "a 14-year-old kid could have hacked Podesta." [...] After Obama expelled 35 Russian diplomats and announced further sanctions on Russia, Trump commended Putin for refraining from retaliatory measures against the United States until the Trump administration would lay out its policy towards Russia.|$|E

2500|$|The band's debut single [...] "Queen of the Troubled Teens" [...] was {{released}} on 17 March 1997, and built upon the chaotic reputation of their shows. Along with 'Self Healer', 'Satan Polaroid' and 'A Film For The Future', the song was included in a live session on Jeff Cooper's show 'XS' (now Radio2XS) on Sheffield's Hallam FM. It was also supported by BBC Radio Scotland DJ Peter Easton, and influential Radio One DJ Steve Lamacq. Lamacq was particularly impressed with the track [...] "Self Healer" [...] and asked, on the air, that if <b>anyone</b> <b>knew</b> anything about the band, they should contact him. In the summer of 1997, Idlewild played their first London shows which were attended {{by the likes of}} Lamacq, and representatives from Deceptive Records. Reviews at this time, in the pages of NME and Melody Maker compared their live gigs to [...] "a flight of stairs falling down a flight of stairs". The band were soon asked to record a single for Fierce Panda and to record an EP/mini-album with Deceptive Records. In October 1997, the band spent six days with producer Paul Tipler in South London. The result was Captain, which the band describes as [...] "an innocent, frank nugget of noise pop magic". After the release of the [...] "Chandelier" [...] single, the band signed a deal with Food Records/EMI in December. Following the record deal, the members quit their respective jobs or university courses.|$|E
