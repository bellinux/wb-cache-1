The background of this research is the trend of more stringent environmental regulation regarding <b>air</b> <b>emission</b> from coal-fired power plants (CFPPs) in Indonesia. One consequence of stringent <b>air</b> <b>emission</b> regulation is the increase of air pollution control costs. This research provides recommendations for PLN, the state electricity company in Indonesia regarding the cost-effectiveness of reducing <b>air</b> <b>emission</b> from CFPPs in order to comply with an upcoming stringent environmental regulation. Four CFPPs were selected as research units of which two units represent large-scale CFPPs while the other two units represent small-scale CFPPs. A cost-engineering model i. e.

A use approach is presented as a more suitable tool. The difference between the two approaches is determined by a better grasp of international trade, which can lead to environmental leakage when a country specialises in the production of environmentally friendly products and has the environmentally unfriendly products which it consumes produced abroad. We show that in the period 1995 - 2002 Belgium was on average a provider of <b>air</b> <b>emission</b> intensive products {{for the rest of the}} world. Environmental leakage was mostly negative. However, the evolution of the Belgian environmental terms of trade shows that by 2002 its imports had become considerably more <b>air</b> <b>emission</b> intensive with respect to its exports than in 1995. There are indications that this evolution is due to a considerable increase of extra-EU imports of <b>air</b> <b>emission</b> intensive products. This in turn could point to environmentally inspired offshoring. However, the currently available data do not allow us to test this hypothesis.

40|$|This paper {{considers}} {{the issue of}} <b>air</b> pollutants <b>emission</b> for the optimal and sustainable determination of cordon location, toll level, and price of park and ride (P&R). Although <b>air</b> pollutants <b>emission</b> decreases within the cordon by the implementation of cordon pricing scheme, it may increase outside the cordon and the whole network. Hence, <b>air</b> pollutants <b>emission</b> may only transfer from inside of the cordon to its outside. Therefore, in this paper, a multi-objective bi-level optimization model is developed. A solution algorithm is also presented based on the second version of strength Pareto evolutionary algorithm (SPEA 2). The results reveal that this multi-objective model can be {{a useful tool for}} the sustainable and optimal design of the cordon and P&R scheme. In addition, cordon pricing is a multi-objective problem. Therefore, it is necessary to consider <b>air</b> pollutants <b>emission.</b> By choosing another non-dominated result in the solution space, <b>air</b> pollutants <b>emission</b> outside the cordon and the whole network can be reduced without a significant reduction in social welfare...|$|R

MÉTODOS: Foram analisados os achados do teste de emissão de ar nasal e nasofaringoscopia em 21 indivíduos operados de fissura pós-forame e transforame incisivo, de ambos os gêneros, com idade {{superior}} a oito anos. A correlação foi feita observando se, diante de um gap velofaríngeo (espaço entre as estruturas da região velofaríngea) visualizado na nasofaringoscopia, notava-se embaçamento do espelho de Glatzel no teste de emissão de ar nasal. Os dados foram analisados estatisticamente pelo índice de Kappa. RESULTADOS: Notou-se concordância entre os testes (p OBJECTIVE: To verify {{whether the}} information {{collected in the}} nasal <b>air</b> <b>emission</b> test are compatible to the nasopharyngoscopy findings, helping {{the assessment of the}} velopharyngeal mechanism functionality. METHODS: The findings of nasal <b>air</b> <b>emission</b> test and nasopharyngoscopy were analyzed in 21 individuals of both genders, over the age of 8 years, operated for post-foramen and transincisive foramen fissure. The correlation was carried out observing whether or not, {{in the face of a}} velopharyngeal gap visualized in the nasopharyngoscopy, misting of the Glatzel mirror was noted in the nasal <b>air</b> <b>emission</b> test. Data were statistically analyzed using the Kappa index. RESULTS: An agreement was observed between the tests (p< 0, 05), and it was considered higher during blowing, emission of isolated stops and fricatives in words and phrases (Kappa: 0, 897; 0, 887; 0, 774 and 0, 774, respectively), than for emission of stops in words, isolated fricatives and stops in phrases (Kappa: 0, 691; 0, 640 and 0, 488, respectively). Incompatibility occurred in a few cases, in the presence of a small gap, complete closing and complete closing with bubbling. Regarding the tendency of velopharyngeal closing, it was found a predominance of the coronal type (48 %), and improvement was noted in 62 % of the subjects with the use of therapeutic test. CONCLUSION: The validity of the nasal <b>air</b> <b>emission</b> test when compared with nasopharyngoscopy was observed. It is, however, important to emphasize that the nasal <b>air</b> <b>emission</b> test must be carefully applied and it shouldn't replace the nasopharyngoscopy, which is conclusive for surgical and therapeutic planning...|$|R
