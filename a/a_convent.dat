5|$|I Bonaparte {{chose to}} ride across the alps on a mule (obtained at <b>a</b> <b>convent</b> at Martigny) {{rather than a}} steed, the typical gentleman's mount at the time, because the mule was {{considered}} to be more sure-footed on the slippery slopes and narrow passes of the Alps, and to be more sturdy and hardy while making such a perilous journey on such volatile terrain.|$|E

5|$|Rev. John Nepomucene Jaeger, {{the first}} Bohemian abbot in the United States, was urged to {{establish}} a monastic community to teach at parochial schools in Bohemian as well as English. He founded St. Procopius priory in 1885. The priory took control of St. Procopius parish in January 1886, and Jaeger became the pastor. Jaeger also founded <b>a</b> <b>convent</b> in 1895, consisting of nuns brought from St. Mary's Convent in Pittsburgh and headed by Jaeger's biological sister, Mother Mary Nepomucene Jaeger. The Czech-American media had pushed for <b>a</b> <b>convent</b> to prepare Czech-speaking nuns for teaching positions in Czech parochial schools, which had previously hired mostly lay teachers trained in Austrian normal schools. The nuns were transferred from Pittsburgh to St. Scholastica's Convent on Chicago's north side, but later that same year moved to an old parish building at Ashland and 19th Streets, where they would remain until 1912. A section of the convent was converted into a music school. Graduates taught in parishes throughout the nation.|$|E

In 1872 he moved to a monastery at Poitiers in France, where Pope Pius {{regularly}} corresponded with the bishop about the young man. After a year, Pio Edgardo Mortara was ordained as a priest—with special dispensation as at 21 he was technically too young.

A marginal note on the deed, in the Constable's own handwriting, records that he had obtained {{the permission of the}} Archbishop of Toledo, Bernardo de Sandoval y Rojas, for {{the cup to}} be used as a ciborium, or container for consecrated hosts. By this period a rule of the church normally forbade the use of vessels decorated on their inner surface as ciboria.|$|E

Many Spaniards lost their lives, and artist Francisco Goya, who witnessed the aftermath of the executions, painted his famous painting The Third of May 1808 to commemorate this event. The fighting and executions claimed at least 154 French and 409 Spanish lives and inspired resistance to the French across the country, signalling the start of the Spanish War of Independence. After Doaiz's death his wife entered <b>a</b> <b>convent</b> in Seville.|$|E
5|$|Pope John Paul II celebrated mass {{over the}} train tracks leading to the camp on 7 June 1979.

Protesters objected to {{what they saw as}} Christianization of the site, while others argued that the cross's presence effectively recognized the camp's Catholic victims.|$|E
5|$|Rodin's sister Maria, {{two years}} his senior, died of {{peritonitis}} in <b>a</b> <b>convent</b> in 1862. Rodin was anguished and felt guilty {{because he had}} introduced Maria to an unfaithful suitor. Turning away from art, he briefly joined a Catholic order, the Congregation of the Blessed Sacrament. Saint Peter Julian Eymard, founder {{and head of the}} congregation, recognized Rodin's talent and, sensing his lack of suitability for the order, encouraged Rodin to continue with his sculpture. He returned to work as a decorator, while taking classes with animal sculptor Antoine-Louis Barye. The teacher's attention to detail– his finely rendered musculature of animals in motion– significantly influenced Rodin.|$|E

In college, she learned Spanish, music, the feminine crafts and social graces. She spent her girlhood partly in their hometown and partly in the convent. Accordingly, Agoncillo was skilled in needlework.|$|E
5|$|The Turin {{painting}} was acquired in 1866 {{from the mayor}} of a nearby town. Previously it was owned by a professor living {{in the province of}} Alessandria; he bought it from a former nun in that province. The documentation is sketchy, but suggests the nun possessed it early in the 19th century during the dissolution of convents in the area under Napoleon. That a nun owned the painting three centuries after Adornes purportedly bequeathed a van Eyck St Francis to his daughter in <b>a</b> <b>convent,</b> and that the Adornes family owned property in Alessandria, is suggestive, but no evidence exists to confirm a connection.|$|E
