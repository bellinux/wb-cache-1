5|$|The Penokean Mountain Range {{formed in}} the Penokean orogeny 1880 to 1830 million years ago, when an oceanic island arc called the Pembine–Wausau terrane {{collided}} with the southern margin of the Superior craton. From 1880 to 1850 million years ago, the region was volcanically active. This volcanism ceased 1850 million years <b>ago</b> <b>when</b> <b>a</b> fragment of Archean crust arrived from the South at the subduction zone. Collision of this Archean crust in the south with the Superior craton in the North caused a period of intense crustal shortening. Rocks of the Pembine–Wassau terrane were thrust up over and onto the Superior craton, forming a mountain range that covered all but the northernmost portion of Lake Superior, crossed parts of three US states (south-central Minnesota, northern Wisconsin, and the Upper Peninsula of Michigan), and continued to the southernmost tip of Ontario, Canada. Loading of the lithosphere by these thrust sheets caused it to flex downwards, forming a foreland basin at around 1850 million {{years ago in the}} south and 1835 million years ago in the north. The Rove Formation was deposited in the northern basin. In the southern basin, crustal thickening caused high-grade metamorphism of the sedimentary fill by 1830 million years ago. A series of post-orogenic plutons intruded into the overlying rocks 1830 million years ago,; these plutons mark the end of the Penokean orogeny.|$|E
25|$|Long Valley {{was formed}} 760,000 years <b>ago</b> <b>when</b> <b>a</b> supervolcanic {{eruption}} released very hot ash that later cooled {{to form the}} Bishop tuff that is common to the area.

Ash from this eruption blanketed much of the western part of what is now the United States.|$|E
25|$|The {{national}} park lies atop an underground evaporite layer or salt bed, {{which is the}} main cause of the formation of the arches, spires, balanced rocks, sandstone fins, and eroded monoliths in the area. This salt bed is thousands of feet thick in places, and was deposited in the Paradox Basin of the Colorado Plateau some 300 million years <b>ago</b> <b>when</b> <b>a</b> sea flowed into the region and eventually evaporated. Over millions of years, the salt bed was covered with debris eroded from the Uncompahgre Uplift to the northeast. During the Early Jurassic (about 210 Ma) desert conditions prevailed in the region and the vast Navajo Sandstone was deposited. An additional sequence of stream laid and windblown sediments, the Entrada Sandstone (about 140 Ma), was deposited on top of the Navajo. Over 5,000 feet (1,500 m) of younger sediments were deposited and have been mostly eroded away. Remnants of the cover exist in the area including exposures of the Cretaceous Mancos Shale. The arches of the area are developed mostly within the Entrada formation.|$|E

25|$|Tiên Sơn cave {{is located}} in Phong Nha-Kẻ Bàng National Park. The cave was {{discovered}} by a local inhabitant by accident in 1935. It {{is located in}} Sơn Trach Commune in Bố Trạch. The entry mouth of Tiên Sơn is 1km from Phong Nha cave, {{at an altitude of}} 200 m. This cave is 980 m in length. A 10 m deep hole is situated 400 m from the entry mouth, then a 500 m long underground cave, dangerous for tourists and open to professional expeditionists only. Like Phong Nha cave, this cave features spectacular stalactites and stalagmites shaped like several fairy-tales. Stalactite and stalagmite columns and walls here create strange sounds like that of gong and drum if they are knocked with the hand. According to British cave scientists, Tiên Sơn cave was created tens of million years <b>ago</b> <b>when</b> <b>a</b> water current holed this limestone mount in Kẻ Bàng. Following a series of landforms and movement of rocks, this mass was levered or lowered, blocking the current and creating what is now Tiên Sơn cave while the underground river redirected its current to Phong Nha cave. Although Phong Nha and Tiên Sơn caves are located next to each other, there are no linking grottos between them.|$|E
