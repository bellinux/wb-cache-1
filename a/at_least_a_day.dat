5|$|The men at Boulogne {{formed the}} core for what Napoleon would later call La Grande Armée. At the start, this French army had about 200,000 men {{organized}} into seven corps, which were large field units that contained 36 to 40 cannon each and {{were capable of}} independent action until other corps could come to the rescue. A single corps (properly situated in a strong defensive position) could survive <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>a</b> <b>day</b> without support, giving the Grande Armée countless strategic and tactical options on every campaign.|$|E
5|$|In Coffee County, local {{officials}} reported wind gusts had blown a carport {{into a wall}} of a house. Marengo County received moderate damage, mostly limited to power outages and minor roof and structural damage caused by fallen trees and powerlines. Many customers were without electric power for <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>a</b> <b>day,</b> and numerous county roads were covered with debris. A person was injured in Dallas County when a tree landed on their car. Five homes and one business were damaged due to high winds, {{and thousands of people}} county-wide experienced power outages. Greene County reported hundreds of downed trees and powerlines causing County Roads 148 and 20 and State Highways 11, 43 and 14 to be temporarily closed. In Forkland, a mobile home caught fire when a powerline fell on the home. A motorist ran into a fallen tree in Boligee although did not sustain injuries. In Perry County, 2,200homes were without electric power for several hours, and several vehicles and homes were damaged. A structural fire occurred in Russell County and was believed to be ignited by downed powerlines.|$|E
25|$|When the {{inclination}} of the moon's orbit to the Earth's equator {{is at its}} minimum of 18°20′, {{the centre of the}} moon's disk will be above the horizon every day as far north and as far south as 90°−18°20' or 71°40' latitude, whereas when {{the inclination}} is at its maximum of 28°36' the centre of the moon's disk will only be above the horizon every day for latitudes less than 90°−28°36' or 61°24'. At higher latitudes there will be a period of <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>a</b> <b>day</b> each month when the moon does not rise, but there will also be a period of <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>a</b> <b>day</b> each month during which the moon does not set. This is similar to the behaviour of the sun, but with a period of 27.3 days instead of 365 days. Note that a point on the moon can actually be visible when it is below the horizon by about 34 arc minutes, due to refraction (see Sunrise).|$|E

25|$|Oocysts in cat feces take <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>a</b> <b>day</b> to sporulate {{and become}} {{infectious}} {{after they are}} shed, so disposing of cat litter daily greatly reduces the chances of infectious oocysts being present in litter. As infectious oocysts from cat feces can spread and survive in the environment for months, humans should wear gloves when gardening or working with soil, and should wash their hands promptly after disposing of cat litter. The same precautions apply to outdoor sandboxes, which should be covered when not in use.|$|E
25|$|Once again, the way {{was open}} to Rimini. Kesselring's forces had taken heavy losses, and three {{divisions}} of reinforcements ordered to the Adriatic front would not be available for <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>a</b> <b>day.</b> Now, the weather intervened: torrential rain turned the rivers into torrents and halted air support operations. Once again movement ground to a crawl, and the German defenders {{had the opportunity to}} reorganise and reinforce their positions on the Marano river, and the salient to the Lombardy plain closed. Once more, the Eighth Army was confronted by an organised line of defence, the Rimini Line.|$|E

Additionally, flight rules which required a 72-hour separation between dockings at the International Space Station threatened to delay the launch by <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>a</b> <b>day</b> due to the delayed launch of the ESA's unmanned Johannes Kepler ATV supply craft. Managers instead decided to press ahead with the countdown allowing for a possible standdown; had docking issues arisen with the ATV, STS-133 would have stood down for 48 hours.

25|$|In June 2008, {{researchers}} at the Radboud University in Nijmegen, the Netherlands, who had previously succeeded in hacking the OV-chipkaart (the Dutch public transport chip card), hacked an Oyster card, which is also based on the MIFARE Classic chip. They scanned a card reader to obtain its cryptographic key, then used a wireless antenna attached to a laptop computer to brush up against passengers on the London Underground and extract the information from their cards.

25|$|As Grant's plan {{became clear}} to Lee on May 4, Lee {{knew that it was}} {{imperative}} to fight in the Wilderness for the same reason as the year before: his army was massively outnumbered, with approximately 65,000 men to Grant's 120,000, and his artillery's guns were fewer than and inferior to those of Grant's. Fighting in the tangled woods would eliminate Grant's advantage in artillery, and the close quarters and ensuing confusion there could give Lee's outnumbered force better odds. He therefore ordered his army to intercept the advancing Federals in the Wilderness. Ewell marched east on the Orange Court House Turnpike, reaching Robertson's Tavern, where they camped about 3–5 miles from the unsuspecting soldiers in Warren's corps. Hill used the Orange Plank Road and stopped at the hamlet of New Verdiersville. These two corps could pin the Union troops in place (they had been ordered to avoid a general engagement until the entire army could be united), fighting outnumbered for <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>a</b> <b>day</b> while Longstreet approached from the southwest for a blow against the enemy's flank, similar to Jackson's at Chancellorsville.|$|E

500|$|The Royal Navy search became frantic, {{as many of}} the British {{ships were}} low on fuel.

The signals were intercepted by the British, from which bearings were determined. They were wrongly plotted on board King George V, leading Tovey to believe that Bismarck was heading back to Germany through the Iceland-Faeroe gap, which kept his fleet on the wrong course for seven hours. By the time the mistake had been discovered, Bismarck had put a sizeable gap between herself and the British ships.|$|E

500|$|Despite their {{sometimes}} differing viewpoints, {{these experts}} generally agree that Bismarck would have eventually foundered if the Germans had not scuttled her first. Ballard estimated that Bismarck could still have floated for <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>a</b> <b>day</b> when the British vessels ceased fire {{and could have}} been captured by the Royal Navy, a position supported by the historian Ludovic Kennedy (who was serving [...] on the destroyer [...] at the time). Kennedy stated, [...] "That she would have foundered eventually {{there can be little}} doubt; but the scuttling ensured that it was sooner rather than later." [...] When asked whether Bismarck would have sunk if the Germans had not scuttled the ship, Cameron replied [...] "Sure. But it might have taken half a day." [...] In Mearns' subsequent book Hood and Bismarck, he conceded that scuttling [...] "may have hastened the inevitable, but only by a matter of minutes."
