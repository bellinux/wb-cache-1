500|$|Before the album's release, {{the song}} [...] "Digging the Grave" [...] was {{released}} {{as a single}} on February28, 1995. That March, the band appeared on the British television program Top of the Pops to promote the single, later performing it on MTV Europe, Canal+'s Nulle Part <b>Ailleurs</b> and The Jon Stewart Show. The single reached number 16 on the UK Singles Chart, and number 12 on the Australian ARIA Charts. It featured on an episode of Beavis and Butt-head in August 1995, and was included on the soundtrack of the 1996 Italian film Jack Frusciante è uscito dal gruppo. A video for the song was recorded, directed by Marcus Raboy, and filmed in San Francisco. and was later included on the collection [...]|$|E

2500|$|Eventually, Schultzberg {{did indeed}} leave the band in September 1996, on a United States tour. Before going on stage {{for their first}} show {{in the state of}} New York, Olsdal {{informed}} Schultzberg that he wasn't going on the tour in Germany that was following the US one. At the manager's request, Schultzberg did two more shows with the band in Paris after the US tour, the last of which was a performance on the French TV series Nulle part <b>ailleurs.</b> According to Schultzberg [...] "Molko said that he was 'tired of being the focus of Robert's rages against the world', and quite frankly, I was tired of being his". While Schultzberg was with the band, several early works were recorded, including their first 7" [...] single [...] "Bruise Pristine", the [...] "Come Home" [...] EP, the single version of [...] "Nancy Boy" [...] (with B-sides [...] "Slackerbitch", [...] "Miss Moneypenny" [...] and the Smiths cover [...] "Bigmouth Strikes Again") and their eponymous debut album. On the track [...] "I Know", Schultzberg played didgeridoo as well as drums. Hewitt eventually joined Placebo as a full-time member at Molko's request.|$|E
2500|$|In {{order to}} promote Music and [...] "Don't Tell Me", Madonna {{appeared}} on The Late Show with David Letterman in November 2000, being {{the first time since}} her controversial appearance in 1994, where she performed a slower, acoustic version of the song, accompanying herself on guitar along with co-writer Joe Henry. It the first time Madonna performed guitar herself in public. She later went to Europe to promote the single on German game-show Wetten, dass..?, and later performed [...] "Don't Tell Me" [...] on British television program Top of The Pops, along with previous single [...] "Music". She also performed the latter songs live on French television program Nulle Part <b>Ailleurs,</b> and sang only [...] "Don't Tell Me" [...] on Carràmba! Che fortuna in Italy. The song was also part of the promotional shows for Music. The first of these, was on November 5, 2000, at Roseland Ballroom in New York City, and the other on November 29, 2000, at Brixton Academy in London. During the performance of New York, she wore a black tank top with [...] "Britney Spears" [...] written on it, along with cowboy hats and boots. Roseland's secondary stage was used for the performance and was decked as a neo-Western wonderland. Madonna performed the song sitting on a bale of hay while Mirwais Ahmadzaï played the acoustic guitar.|$|E
2500|$|On November 24, 2000, Madonna {{performed}} the latter songs live on French television program Nulle Part <b>Ailleurs.</b> Madonna then played another concert on November 29, 2000, at Brixton Academy in London. It was shown {{via the internet}} to an estimated record-breaking 9 million viewers across the world. The setlist was the same from the Roseland Ballroom's concert, with the song [...] "Holiday" [...] being added to the setlist. The singer Richard Ashcroft and the Scottish band Texas opened the concert. Madonna then performed [...] "Don't Tell Me" [...] on Carràmba! Che fortuna in Italy, on December 2, 2000. On February 21, 2001, she performed [...] "Music" [...] at the 43rd Grammy Awards. For the performance, the stage had five giant video screens, which showed images from her career. Madonna entered onto the stage in a classic Cadillac driven by rapper Bow Wow. The singer emerged {{from the back seat}} of the car in a full-length fur coat and a hat, quickly removing the clothes to reveal a tight leather jacket and jeans. She removed her jacket to reveal a black tank top with the words [...] "Material Girl" [...] printed on it. Host Jon Stewart commented right after, talking about how he was getting older and commenting, [...] "As I was watching Madonna writhing around on the hood of the car, all I could think was — that’s really gonna drive up her insurance premiums".|$|E
2500|$|The first live {{performance}} of [...] "Music" [...] {{was during the}} promotional show for Music, held on November 5, 2000, at Roseland Ballroom in New York City. Accompanying musicians performing with Madonna were; Mirwais Ahmadzaï on guitar and longtime backing singers Niki Haris and Donna DeLory. During the performance of New York, she wore a black tank top with [...] "Britney Spears" [...] written on it, along with cowboy hats and boots. Before performing [...] "Music" [...] Madonna recalled; [...] "The last time I played Roseland was 18 years ago, I was the opening act for New Edition". On November 16, 2000 Madonna performed [...] "Music" [...] during the MTV Europe Music Awards 2000 at the Ericsson Globe, in Stockholm, Sweden. After being introduced by Ali G as [...] "Maradona", Madonna performed the song wearing a T-shirt {{with the name of}} Australian recording artist Kylie Minogue printed on it. She later performed [...] "Music" [...] and [...] "Don't Tell Me" [...] on British television program Top of The Pops, in an appearance aired on November 17. On November 24, 2000, Madonna performed the latter songs live on French television program Nulle Part <b>Ailleurs.</b> It was also performed during the promotional show for Music at Brixton Academy in London. Around 3,000fans attended the concert, which was streamed over the internet. More than nine million people watched the concert according to Nicky Price, a representative for Microsoft's MSN, the webcast's producer. It became the most-viewed webcast of all time, beating Paul McCartney's performance of [...] "50s rock and roll classics" [...] at Liverpool's The Cavern Club in December 1999, which was viewed by an audience of about three million.|$|E

C'est là uniquement qu'on doit chercher à [...] connaître avec précision la méthode générale que l'esprit humain [...] emploie {{constamment}} dans toutes ses recherches positives, parce [...] que nulle part <b>ailleurs</b> les questions ne sont résolues d'une [...] manière aussi complète et les déductions prolongées aussi loin avec [...] une sévérité rigoureuse.

[...] "Conçu logiquement, l'ordre suivant lequel nos principales théories accomplissent l'évolution fondamentale résulte nécessairement de leur dépendence mutuelle. Toutes les sciences peuvent, sans doute, être ébauchées à la fois: leur usage pratique exige même cette culture simultanée. Mais elle ne peut concerner que les inductions propres à chaque classe de spéculations. Or cet essor inductif ne saurait fournir des principes suffisants qu'envers les plus simples études. Partout <b>ailleurs,</b> ils ne peuvent être établis qu'en subordonnant chaque genre d'inductions scientifiques à l'ensemble des déductions emanées des domaines moins compliqués, et dès-lors moins dépendants. Ainsi nos diverses théories reposent dogmatiquement les unes sur les autres, suivant un ordre invariable, qui doit régler historiquement leur avénement décisif, les plus indépendantes ayant toujours dû se développer plus tôt." ...|$|E
6000|$|There are {{literary}} reputations in France and England which seem, {{like the}} fairies, {{to be unable}} to cross running water. Dean Swift, according to M. Paul de Saint-Victor, is a great man at Dover, a pigmy at Calais--"Son talent, qui enthousiasme l'Angleterre, n'inspire <b>ailleurs</b> qu'un morne etonnement." [...] M. Paul De Saint-Victor was a fair example of the French critic, and what he says about Swift was possibly true,--for him. There is not much resemblance between the Dean and M. Theodore de Banville, except that the latter too is a poet who has little honour {{out of his own}} country. He is a charming singer at Calais; at Dover he inspires un morne etonnement (a bleak perplexity). One has never seen an English attempt to describe or estimate his genius. His unpopularity in England is illustrated {{by the fact that the}} London Library, that respectable institution, does not, or did not, possess a single copy of any one of his books. He is but feebly represented even in the collection of the British Museum. It is not hard to account for our indifference to M. De Banville. He is a poet not only intensely French, but intensely Parisian. He is careful of form, rather than abundant in manner. He has no story to tell, and his sketches in prose, his attempts at criticism, are not very weighty or instructive. With all his limitations, however, he represents, in company with M. Leconte de Lisle, the second of the three generations of poets over whom Victor Hugo reigned.|$|E
