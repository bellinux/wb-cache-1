Restricting to Gaussian fluctuations around equilibrium, and assuming a power law type of relation between the black hole mass, charge and horizon area, characterized by two real positive indices, the grand canonical entropy is shown to acquire a logarithmic correction with a positive coefficient proportional to {{the sum of the}} indices. However, the root mean squared fluctuations of mass and charge relative to the mean values of these quantities turn out to be independent of the details of the assumed mass-area relation.

40|$|The tensile {{properties}} of natural plant fibres are commonly determined by single fibre testing. The cross- sectional area {{used to determine}} the modulus and strength is usually obtained by measuring the fibre width and using this as the fibre diameter {{on the assumption that the}} fibres are circular in section.

40|$|An {{elementary}} introduction {{is given}} to the problem of black hole entropy as formulated by Bekenstein and Hawking, based on the so-called Laws of Black Hole Mechanics. Wheeler's `It from Bit' picture is presented as an explanation of plausibility of the Bekenstein-Hawking Area Law. A variant of this picture that takes better account of the symmetries of general relativity is shown to yield <b>corrections</b> to the <b>Area</b> Law that are logarithmic in the horizon area, with a finite, fixed coefficient. The Holographic hypothesis, tacitly assumed in the above considerations, is briefly described and the beginnings of a general proof of the hypothesis is sketched, within an approach to quantum gravitation which is non-perturbative in nature, namely Non-perturbative Quantum General Relativity (also known as Quantum Geometry). The holographic entropy bound is shown to be somewhat tightened due to the corrections obtained earlier.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the development of}} an autonomous obstacle-avoidance method that operates in conjunction with groping locomotion on the humanoid robot Bonten-Maru II. Present studies on groping locomotion consist of basic research in which humanoid robot recognizes its surroundings by touching and groping with its arm on the flat surface of a wall. The robot responds to the surroundings by performing corrections to its orientation and locomotion direction. During groping locomotion, however, the existence of obstacles within the <b>correction</b> <b>area</b> creates the possibility of collisions. The objective {{of this paper is to}} develop an autonomous method to avoid obstacles in the <b>correction</b> <b>area</b> by applying suitable algorithms to the humanoid robot's control system. In order to recognize its surroundings, six-axis force sensors were attached to both robotic arms as end effectors for force control. The proposed algorithm refers to the rotation angle of the humanoid robot's leg joints due to trajectory generation. The algorithm relates to the groping locomotion via the measured groping angle and motions of arms. Using Bonten-Maru II, groping experiments were conducted on a wall's surface to obtain wall orientation data. By employing these data, the humanoid robot performed the proposed method autonomously to avoid an obstacle present in the <b>correction</b> <b>area.</b> Results indicate that the humanoid robot can recognize the existence of an obstacle and avoid it by generating suitable trajectories in its legs...|$|R

Based on {{accurately}} located 23 very shallow earthquakes (h = 1 - 14 km) {{in northern}} and central Greece by portable networks of seismic stations {{and by the}} joint epicentre method, the travel times of the P,-waves from the foci of these earthquakes to the sites of 54 permanent stations in the Balkan region have been determined. The travel times of P,-waves in the central and {{eastern part of the}} area (eastern Greece, south-eastern Yugoslavia, the Aegean Sea, Bulgaria, southern Romania, western Turkey) fit a straight line very well with the P,, velocity equal to 7. 9 f 0. 1 km s-'. On the contrary, the travel times of P,,-waves to stations {{in the western part of}} the area (Albania, western Greece) do not fit this curve because the P,,-waves travelling to these stations are delayed by more than 1 s due to the thicker crust under the Dinarides-Hellenides mountain range.

Membrane penetration resulted only in an average of 0.36  % decrease in void ratio during isotropic consolidation and undrained shear tests as the fine gradation of the tested sand limited the amount of membrane penetration into the surface irregularities of the specimen. The bedding errors due to the application of lubricated ends led to a maximum increase in volumetric strain of 1.7  % during isotropic compression and an additional 0.38  mm or 2.5  % increase in the measured axial strain during shearing. The corrected results are presented to compare the responses for different specimen sizes during isotropic compression and shearing in the following paragraphs.|$|E
