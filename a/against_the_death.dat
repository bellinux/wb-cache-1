5|$|In {{the late}} 1950s, Dunstan became {{well known for}} his {{campaign}} <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>death</b> penalty being imposed on Max Stuart, {{who was convicted of}} rape and murder of a small girl. He harried Playford aggressively over the matter, creating an uproar over what he saw as an unfair process. Playford eventually relented, and appeared shaken thereafter; the event was seen as {{a turning point in the}} LCL's decline, and Labor gained momentum. During Labor's time in opposition, Dunstan was prominent in securing some reforms in Aboriginal rights, and was at the forefront of Labor abandoning the White Australia Policy.|$|E

25|$|In {{my career}} when I prosecute {{the worst of}} the worst like people who kill children, I believe the only {{appropriate}} punishment is the death penalty. Tom Brinkman is <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>death</b> penalty even for those vicious killers who prey on our kids, and he's even <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>death</b> penalty for terrorists who kill Americans. Our next congressman must go to Washington and fight to remove these murderers from society. Tom Brinkman will work to stop the death penalty just as he's done in Columbus. Pat DeWine believes these people should go. And that's one more reason I support Pat DeWine for Congress.|$|E

25|$|The Globe {{has a long}} {{tradition}} of being a progressive institution, and especially on social issues. We are pro-choice; we're <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>death</b> penalty; we're for gay rights.

We are a lot more nuanced and subtle than that liberal stereotype does justice to.|$|E

25|$|He {{joined the}} Australian {{campaign}} <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>death</b> penalty. Prompted by the impending hanging of Ronald Ryan in 1967, Tatchell went round his local area painting slogans against the hanging, a fact {{he did not}} reveal until nearly 30 years later. Ryan was accused of killing a prison warder while escaping from Pentridge Prison in Coburg, Victoria. Tatchell claimed, unsuccessfully, that the trajectory of the bullet through the warder's body probably made it impossible that Ryan could have fired the fatal shot.|$|E

25|$|Reviews {{note the}} theme of violence. The novel {{examines}} some of the social causes for the violence depicted. The Guardian pointed out the irony {{that the state is}} working to execute Granville Oliver against Washingtonians' consensus when so many other African American men die on the street. and called this an original argument <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>death</b> penalty. The New York Times compared the depiction of violence growing from smaller actions to the work of Richard Price. Pelecanos has described the book as an anti-detective novel because no case is solved by the private investigators and they are constantly a step behind the police.|$|E
