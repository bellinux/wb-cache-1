5|$|Everyone in {{the office}} {{complains}} about Dwight Schrute's (Rainn Wilson) building standards, such as un-plying toilet paper, adding motion sensors to the lights, and placing a roach billboard over the windows to the office. Pam Halpert (Jenna Fischer), as office administrator, threatens to move everyone to a different building if nothing is done. She leaves <b>and</b> <b>comes</b> <b>back</b> with pictures of a newer office space and says they can move in three months. Dwight investigates and finds that the office building does not exist. When Dwight plays coy around Pam, she admits to Jim Halpert (John Krasinski) that she lied about the office building and that she is afraid of failing again after failing {{as an artist and}} a salesperson. Jim tries in vain to reassure her, and she breaks down in tears. Later Nate (Mark Proksch), Dwight's building assistant, discreetly gives Pam a book on the state building regulations. Pam shows Dwight that his policies are in violation of the laws written in the book, so Dwight puts everything back to normal. The camera crew confronts Dwight with footage showing that he overheard Pam's conversation with Jim and instructed Nate to give her the book on the building regulations. Dwight admits that he allowed her to win, but mocks the idea that he did so out of compassion.|$|E

500|$|In 2007, Fiasco {{announced}} his second album, Lupe Fiasco's The Cool, a concept album that expands {{on the story}} of the track of the same name on his first album. While recording this album, Fiasco's father died of type II diabetes and his business partner, Charles [...] "Chilly" [...] Patton, was convicted of attempting to supply heroin to a drug ring and was eventually sentenced to 44 years in a correctional facility. These events greatly affected Fiasco and the subsequent themes discussed on the record. [...] The disc was released in December 2007 in United States while the first single and video from the album, [...] "Superstar" [...] featuring Matthew Santos was released the first week of November 2007. [...] Lupe Fiasco's The Cool, a concept album that expanded upon recurring themes in Food & Liquor, is about [...] "a hustler who dies <b>and</b> <b>comes</b> <b>back</b> to life, only to get robbed by two little kids with the same gun that killed him." [...] For the record, Fiasco decided not to work with well-known producers as he considered it to be [...] "too expensive", noting the commercial failure of his Pharrell collaboration, [...] "I Gotcha".|$|E
500|$|Nageswara Rao {{played the}} role of a 90-year-old man. His {{character}} enters the film just before the interval and remains until {{the very end of the}} film. All the members of the principal cast except Nageswara Rao played dual roles in the film. Nagarjuna said in an interview that he would be seen in the 1920s, 1980s and 2013 and would play a zamindar in 1920. Saran revealed that every character in the film would have a specific aspect; Nagarjuna's character loves cars. Regarding her role, Saran said that she would be seen as a poor but content farmer in the flashback sequences and a doctor in the present day. She added [...] "My character goes back to 1930s <b>and</b> <b>comes</b> <b>back</b> in the present era. I can't tell how it happens though. It's a fun character and you will find me stammering a lot. Suddenly, I'm talking normally and suddenly I start stammering, that's how you understand my character." [...] She added that apart from Nagarjuna, she has more scenes with Nageswara Rao and only a couple of scenes with Chaitanya in the film.|$|E

He had been studying abroad in Germany for a time, <b>and</b> <b>comes</b> <b>back</b> to where Efs story takes place. Shuichi is a neighbor of Renji's and is good friends with him despite the age difference. Shuichi knows Yu Himura and Chihiro as well, but she forgets Shuichi due to her condition. He meets the main heroine from the fourth chapter of the story named [...] after being introduced by Renji's mother. She goes to an affiliated school and admires Kei greatly {{as someone who is}} older than she is; in fact, Mizuki is also on her school's girls' basketball team. She greatly enjoys reading shōjo manga. She has a straightforward attitude and likes to be frank towards others, especially to Kei. She initially comes to Otowa to visit her older cousin Renji, and this is when she meets Shuichi. Shuichi keeps to himself that he is dying of a special case of neurosis, of which Mizuki is aware of, but even though she tries to get closer to him, he forcibly pushes her away and rejects her affections. Mizuki becomes depressed and obtains Chihiro's diary. Casually reading it, she finds Yu's name which she recognizes from her past. Mizuki goes to the church to find Yu, but the chapter ends shortly after.|$|E
500|$|Another {{established}} literary trope {{found in}} the plot of Conan the Barbarian {{is the concept of}} death, followed by a journey into the underworld, and rebirth. [...] Donald E. Palumbo, the Language and Humanities Chair at Lorain County Community College, noted that like most other sword and sorcery films, Conan used the motif of underground journeys to reinforce the themes of death and rebirth. [...] According to him, the first scene to involve all three is after Conan's liberation: his flight from wild dogs sends him tumbling into a tomb where he finds a sword that lets him cut off his chains and stand with newfound power. [...] In the later parts of the film, Conan experiences two underground journeys where death abounds: {{in the bowels of the}} Tower of Serpents where he has to fight a giant snake and in the depths of the Temple of Set where the cultists feast on human flesh while Doom transforms himself into a large serpent. [...] Whereas Valeria dies <b>and</b> <b>comes</b> <b>back</b> from the dead (albeit briefly), Conan's ordeal from his crucifixion was symbolic. [...] Although the barbarian's crucifixion might evoke Christian imagery, associations of the film with the religion are roundly rejected. [...] Milius stated his film is full of pagan ideas, a sentiment supported by film critics such as Elley and Jack Kroll. [...] George Aichele, Professor Emeritus of Philosophy and Religion at Adrian College, suggested the filmmaker's intent with the crucifixion scene was pure marketing: to tease the audience with religious connotations. [...] He, however, suggested that Conan's story can be viewed as an analogy of Christ's life and vice versa. [...] Nigel Andrews, a film critic, saw any connections to Christianity related more to the making of the film. The crucifixion is also reminiscent of Odin being nailed to Yggdrasil.|$|E

After further confusions, he goes out <b>and</b> <b>comes</b> <b>back</b> in again, and this time introduces himself, tells Rosie {{that she is the}} most beautiful woman he has ever seen, and asks to take her out for dinner. Rosie, having already warmed to his magic tricks and stories of visiting sick children in hospital, accepts immediately. The only problem is that Sam assumes that Rosie is Joanna Rupelford.|$|E

2500|$|On May 9, 2013, NBC renewed Parks and Recreation for a sixth season. The season debuted on September 26, 2013 with {{an hour-long}} episode set in London.

Diane announces she's pregnant as the season begins; Ron proposes to her, she accepts, and they get married. It is also revealed that Ann is pregnant with Chris' child. Andy takes a temporary job in London. The town of Eagleton goes into bankruptcy and is absorbed by Pawnee, an effort spearheaded by Leslie after she sees {{no other way to}} save the town. As the governments merge, several Eagleton staffers briefly join the Pawnee parks department, with only Craig (Billy Eichner) remaining long-term. Leslie loses the recall vote and returns to the parks department full-time, but remains devoted to assuring the merger is successful. Tom sells Rent-A-Swag in a cash settlement. Ben is fired from Sweetum's <b>and</b> <b>comes</b> <b>back</b> to work at the local accounting firm, but quits promptly (again) after Chris tells him that he has been voted in as the next City Manager. April buys Ron's cabin in the woods. It is later revealed that Chris and Ann are having a boy. Leslie starts breaking ground on Pawnee Commons. Ann and Chris leave town for Michigan. Beginning with [...] "Anniversaries," [...] Jim O'Heir and Retta get a spot in the opening theme, replacing Rashida Jones and Rob Lowe. As a way to garner public support for the unpopular merger of Pawnee and Eagleton, the parks department begins work on the Pawnee/Eagleton Unity Concert. In [...] "The Wall", it is revealed that Ron and Diane have had their baby, John Swanson, without informing anyone in the office. Afterward, Ron single-handedly renovates the third floor of City Hall. In [...] "Galentine's Day", Ann and Chris have their baby, Oliver Perkins-Traeger. In [...] "Flu Season 2" [...] Leslie reveals that she is pregnant. Leslie and Ben also find out that they are having triplets. In the finale, Tom's Bistro opens to a terrible start with the investor pulling out, but becomes a hotspot when it plays host to the after party for the highly successful Unity Concert. Leslie takes the job as Regional Director for the National Park Service in Chicago, immediately submitting a proposal to bring the job to Pawnee. The finale ends three years in the future, where Leslie has had her triplets and is competently running the Midwest Regional office of the National Park Service from the third floor of Pawnee City Hall.|$|E
