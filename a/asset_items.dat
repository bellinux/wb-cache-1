Despite, or because of, the great amount of research on this topic, significant new determinants for electoral participation have not been recently forthcoming. Here we offer a significant new determinant – patrimony. For theoretical reasons, we expect a voter’s wealth portfolio to influence their turnout. We test these ideas using a battery of <b>asset</b> <b>items</b> asked in French election surveys. Our finding is that voters who possess more patrimony {{are more likely to}} vote. The strength of this patrimonial effect rivals the influence of the strongest traditional predictors, such as political interest. Finally, patrimonial effects seem able to subsume, even replace, the traditional class effects from income, occupation, and education. This pivotal empirical, as well as theoretical, role of patrimony suggests serious revision in the explanation of how socioeconomic forces shape electoral participation...|$|E

Several approaches are proposed in the past, most of which focused on quality analysis of firm's knowledge assets in firm value. This paper tries to make a breakthrough on this topic by applying fuzzy set theory and fuzzy AHP method to construct a quantified model to measure the contribution value of knowledge <b>assets</b> <b>items.</b> Furthermore, by applying this model to study two cases. The results of two cases about value creation of knowledge assets show that this evaluation model is applicable {{to appraise}} the quality and the value creation contribution of knowledge assets in corporations. Moreover, using this model, managers can determine the level of assets matching, identify which specific knowledge <b>assets</b> <b>item</b> needs new investment, and so on.

Quantitatively, we found that proportional development took place, in both liabilities and <b>asset</b> <b>items</b> of the banks under different capital adequacy ratio values. Evidences did show that banks reorganised their assets and liabilities to achieve higher capital adequacy ratios, but such reorganisation did not result from a planned action of the banks, except in certain isolated cases. We also found that the assets reorganisation was more pronounced than the reorganisation of the liabilities.

40|$|The {{adoption}} of the international accounting standards in Brazil allowed the companies to value fixed <b>asset</b> <b>items</b> at their fair value, using the deemed cost as an authorized procedure to lend a new monetary translation to these items, with the net equity and possible reflections in the liabilities serving as the counterparts. This permission was restricted to {{the year of the}} initial {{adoption of}} the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), while its use was prohibited for subsequent periods. As the monetary update {{of the cost of the}} companies non-monetary assets had been revoked more than a decade earlier, the {{adoption of the}} deemed cost would signal a possibility of value recomposition and that this possibility could alter the magnitude of the structural indicators of the companies’ equity status. In this context, the objective of the article is to investigate and evidence whether the use of the deemed cost by the Brazilian companies listed on BM&F, in the initial adoption of the IFRS standard in 2009 significantly altered the quantum of the structural indicators Indebtedness Level (IL) and Return on Assets (ROA). To obtain the results, quantitative models were used, based on the variance analysis through the test of means, Pearson’s correlation matrix and descriptive statistics. The results, with a 95 % confidence level, suggest that, in statistical terms, the use of the deemed cost in Brazil was not attractive for the companies, did not produce significant alterations in the Indebtedness Level (IL) and Return on Assets (ROA) and did not reveal any significant undervaluation of the corporate fixed assets...|$|E
40|$|In {{some of the}} {{continental}} European countries (e. g. France), there is a necessity to make {{a clear distinction between}} the legal issue of commerce fund (fonds de commerce, in French language), and the related accounting concept represented by goodwill. Fonds de commerce represents a set of movable and immovable goods with a common destination, therefore having a unique legal status. Goodwill is an intangible asset item that is placed within the Balance Sheet. It holds together all the fonds de commerce elements which finally form a subset containing the following: (i) intangible assets; (ii) not evaluated, nor separately recorded; (iii) purchased, but not internally created; (iv) which compete for the maintenance and further development of the company’s activity potential. The goodwill issue appears very often within the consolidated accounts. A commercial relationship between the parent of a group and one of its subsidiaries may appear either through {{the creation of a new}} enterprise (initiated by the group leader), or by acquisition of already existent business. In this second case, we are talking about a business combination. The acquired goodwill is mentioned in the Balance Sheet, amongst non-current intangible <b>asset</b> <b>items.</b> The internally generated goodwill is not recognised within the Balance Sheet. Goodwill may be stated as the difference between the acquisition cost and the percentage belonging to the buyer within the fair value of the assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities identifiable acquired. In the advanced accounting systems, goodwill is no longer amortized. His useful life is undefined, but not unlimited. The fact that is no longer amortized determines an annual depreciation test. Such a depreciation test is meant to evaluate the goodwill on the basis of present cash flows...|$|E

40|$|Why {{monetary}} control in capitalist economies fails? Endogenous money approach, according to Wray and taking Keynes's nominalist view into consideration, could answer this. Money is a balance sheet's script in transferring purchasing power, a term in which debt positions are described, and its <b>asset</b> <b>item</b> thus financed on demand by banking system. Historically and institutionally, endogenous {{money is a}} nominal asset that circulates in every sort of giro systems. Wallerstein's World-System might be reinterpreted in view of its wobbly circulation towards the World- (Giro) -System. Money supply cannot be controlled exogenously since it is determined by private decisions to enter into debt commitments for spending. Liabilities are contractually fixed but assets are indeterminate thus cyclically could fall. This nominalistic nature of monetary contracts {{is based on the}} characteristics discussed bellow. Such uncertainties in turn make liquidity preference volatile, whose constraints will emerge, as it were, quasi-exogenously. The latter is no way identified with the demande for money, nor met with the money supply. Financial instability in capitalism is therefore due to a dynamics between the endogeneity of money supply and the "quasi-ex-ogeneity" of liquidity preference. This view on monetary theory provides a compelling critique of financial liberalization...|$|R

40|$|The {{issue of}} value {{relevance}} of intangible non-current assets (NCA) {{is important in}} the financial reporting literature due to the ever increasing interest in the components of intangible <b>assets</b> <b>items</b> including goodwill and intellectual capital. This study examines the value relevance of reported intangible NCA among firms listed on the main board of Bursa Malaysia throughout a 12 -year period from 1990 until 2001. During this time period, Malaysia went through three different economic and accounting environmental conditions. Early 1990 s saw an excellent economic condition but with less stringent accounting regulatory period. However, 1997 and 1998 were the financial crisis period. In 1997, the Malaysian Accounting Standards Board (MASB) was established by the Malaysia government. From 1999 until 2001, Malaysia went through a recovery economic period plus a more stringent accounting regulatory framework. Based on the value relevance model, we find evidence that intangible NCA continuously show a negative association with firms’ share market price throughout the three different economic periods and accounting environments among our sample firms. However, as expected the association was not significant before the establishment of MASB compared to after. Our finding is consistent with extant studies on the issue of value relevance of intangible NCA during poor economic condition. However, our finding is not consistent with prior studies concerning value relevance of intangible assets during stable economic condition. Nevertheless, our finding is consistent with the on-going argument and theory of capitalized intangible assets more likely to reflect uncertain expected future cash flows, hence value relevance is perceived by investors to be biased...|$|R

40|$|Background: In Bangladesh DOTS {{has been}} {{provided}} free of charge since 1993, yet information on access to TB services by different population group is not well documented. The objective {{of this study was}} to assess and compare the socio economic position (SEP) of actively detected cases from the community and the cases being routinely detected under National Tuberculosis Control Programme (NTP) in Bangladesh. Methods and Findings: SEP was assessed by validated <b>asset</b> <b>item</b> for each of the 21, 427 households included in the national tuberculosis prevalence survey 2007 - 2009. A principal component analysis generated household scores and categorized in quartiles. The distribution of 33 actively identified cases was compared with the 240 NTP cases over the identical SEP quartiles to evaluate access to TB services by different groups of the population. The population prevalence of tuberculosis was 5 times higher in the lowest quartiles of population (95. 4, 95 % CI: 48. 0 - 189. 7) to highest quartile population (19. 5, 95 % CI: 6. 9 - 55. 0). Among the 33 cases detected during survey, 25 (75. 8 %) were from lower two quartiles, and the rest 8 (24. 3 %) were from upper two quartiles. Among TB cases detected passively under NTP, more than half of them 137 (57. 1 %) were from uppermost two quartiles, 98 (41 %) from the second quartile, and 5 (2 %) in the lowest quartile of the population. This distribution is not affected when adjusted for other factors or interactions among them. Conclusions: The findings indicate that despite availability free of charge, DOTS is not equally accessed by the poorer sections of the population. However, these figures should be interpreted with caution since there is a need for additional studies that assess in-depth poverty indicators and its determinants in relation to access of the TB services provided in Banglades...|$|R
