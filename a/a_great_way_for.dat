They {{downloaded}} a portion of 'Music' before I'd even mixed it. It was astonishing. I {{have no idea how}} they got it. It was still in such a beginning stage. And it freaked me out, because I suddenly thought, 'Oh, my God. If they got that, then they have other things on my record that aren't finished.' And that's really scary. So, basically, I made — well, my manager made — a public statement [...] Simple as that. And then suddenly it was in every headline: 'Madonna is against Napster.' I mean ... I don't take that sort of a stance. I feel covetous about my work, and I don't want people to hear it until it's finished. At the same time, I think, to a certain extent, the trading of information is inevitable. And, on the other hand, Napster could be <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>way</b> <b>for</b> people to hear your music who wouldn't have the chance to hear it on the radio. So that's what I have to say about that. Really, I want to strangle the person who got ahold of it. I don't know — I can't control everybody [...] ".|$|E

As soon as it was concluded of, all the rum that was in the Towns was all staved and spilled, belonging both to Indians and white people, which in quantity consisted of about forty gallons, that was thrown in the street, and we have appointed four men to stave all the rum or strong liquors that is brought to the Towns hereafter, either by Indians or white men, during the four years. We would be glad if our brothers would send strict orders that we might prevent the rum coming to the hunting cabins or to the neighboring towns. We have sent wampum to the French, to the Five Nations, to the Delaware...to tell them not to bring any rum to our towns, for we want none...so we would be glad if our brothers would inform the traders not bring any for we are sorry, after they have brought it <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>way,</b> <b>for</b> them to have it broke, and when they're once warned they will take care." ...|$|E

6000|$|... {{it was not}} {{so easily}} got ready as some people may imagine. First of all, it was {{necessary}} to awaken the girl, who had fallen asleep with her face on the kitchen table; this took a little time, and, even when she did answer the bell, another quarter of an hour was consumed in fruitless endeavours to impart to her a faint and distant glimmering of reason. The man to whom the order for the oysters had been sent, had not been told to open them; it is a very difficult thing to open an oyster with a limp knife and a two-pronged fork; and very little was done in this way. Very little of the beef was done either; and the ham (which was also from the German-sausage shop round the corner) was in a similar predicament. However, there was plenty of porter in a tin can; and the cheese went <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>way,</b> <b>for</b> it was very strong.

60|$|Time went by in {{the house}} after that without much change; only they were now three instead of four, which was a {{perpetual}} reminder of their loss. Miss Alison's money, you are to bear in mind, was highly needful for the estates; and the one brother being dead, my old lord soon set his heart upon her marrying the other. Day in, day out, he would work upon her, sitting by the chimney-side with his finger in his Latin book, and his eyes set upon her face {{with a kind of}} pleasant intentness that became the old gentleman very well. If she wept, he would condole with her like an ancient man that has seen worse times and begins to think lightly even of sorrow; if she raged, he would fall to reading again in his Latin book, but always with some civil excuse; if she offered, as she often did, to let them have her money in a gift, he would show her how little it consisted with his honour, and remind her, even if he should consent, that Mr. Henry would certainly refuse. Non vi sed sæpe cadendo was a favourite word of his; and no doubt this quiet persecution wore away much of her resolve; no doubt, besides, he had a great influence on the girl, having stood in the place of both her parents; and, for that matter, she was herself filled with the spirit of the Duries, and would have gone <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>way</b> <b>for</b> the glory of Durrisdeer; but not so far, I think, as to marry my poor patron, had it not been--strangely enough--for the circumstance of his extreme unpopularity.|$|E

When I started working as a Family Dispute Resolution Practitioner (‘FDRP’) in 2007, a solo mediation method was the standard practice in my workplace, and comediation was an option only where the practitioner assessed that there was a need for two mediators.

30|$|The {{architecture}} {{has been}} tested in different FPGAs by using the RAPTOR [11] module platform as base. This platform allows the adaptation of different reconfigurable modules that consist of Xilinx FPGAs. The tests were performed with the following FPGAs: Spartan- 3 A, Spartan- 6, Virtex- 4, and Virtex- 5. Several combinations were analyzed {{in order to find}} possible optimizations in the communication. As a result, the authors demonstrate a comparative table between combinations used, highlighting the relative optimization after the addition of chAdapt module architecture. The tests performed with the communication between Virtex- 4 and Spartan- 6 are noteworthy. A significant improvement in communication was observed after the introduction of chAdapt in these scenarios.

40|$|Great Britain {{has proved}} herself {{sufficient}} to counteract Russia in her Balkan enterprises {{on more than}} one occasion. In mentioning the War for Greek Independence, we must remember that political aspirations of the Tsars and a series of wars had made the Russians and the Turks traditional enemies and that Great Britain entered the war in order that Russia might not unduly profit {{at the expense of the}} Turks. In 1841, Great Britain was in <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>way</b> responsible <b>for</b> the Treaty of the Straits which closed the Dardanelles in time of war. In 1853, Turkey and Russia again went to war, and the following year Great Britain and France formally joined Turkey, Sardinia joining the Allies in 1855. They met with rather unexpected resistance, and it was not until 1856 that Russia was forced to submit. At the meeting of the Congress of Berlin in 1878, the Tsar, quite naturally, was afraid that a congress of such jealous diplomats would re-examine and reconstruct the very satisfactory treaty of San Stefano, so as to rob him of the spoils of conquest. Lord Beaconsfield, by threatening Russia with war, succeeded in persuading the reluctant Tsar to submit the entire question to the conference, and he had the good fortune to turn the tables to the interests of Great Britain and Austria-Hungary...|$|R

60|$|My boy and {{his brother}} made a fine {{distinction}} between turtle-doves and wild pigeons; they would have killed wild pigeons if they had got a chance, though you could not tell them from turtle-doves except by their size and the sound they made with their wings. But there were not many pigeons in the woods around the Boy's Town, {{and they were very}} shy. There were snipe along the river, and flocks of kildees on the Commons, but the bird that was mostly killed by these boys was the yellowhammer. They distinguished, again, in its case; and decided {{that it was not a}} woodpecker, and might be killed; sometimes they thought that woodpeckers were so nearly yellowhammers that they might be killed, but they had never heard of any one's eating a woodpecker, and so they could not quite bring themselves to it. There were said to be squirrels in the hickory woods near the Poor-House, but that was <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>way</b> off <b>for</b> my boy; besides the squirrels, there was a cross bull in those woods, and sometimes Solomon Whistler passed through them on his way to or from the Poor-House; so my boy never hunted squirrels. Sometimes he went with his brother for rabbits, which you could track through the corn-fields in a light snow, and sometimes, if they did not turn out to be cats, you could get a shot at them. Now and then there were quail in the wheat-stubble, and there were meadow-larks in the pastures, but they were very wild.|$|R
6000|$|And {{now there}} {{came upon the}} scene a new character, and one that played his part, too, in the story; I mean the present lord, Alexander, whose birth (17th July 1757) filled the cup of my poor master's happiness. There was nothing then left him to wish for; nor yet leisure for him to wish for it. Indeed, {{there never was a}} parent so fond and doting as he showed himself. He was {{continually}} uneasy in his son's absence. Was the child abroad? the father would be watching the clouds in case it rained. Was it night? he would rise out of his bed to observe its slumbers. His conversation grew even wearyful to strangers, since he talked of little but his son. In matters relating to the estate, all was designed with a particular eye to Alexander; and it would be:--"Let us put it in hand at once, that the wood may be grown against Alexander's majority"; or, [...] "This will fall in again handsomely for Alexander's marriage." [...] Every day this absorption of the man's nature became more observable, with many touching and some very blameworthy particulars. Soon the child could walk abroad with him, at first on the terrace, hand in hand, and afterward at large about the policies; and this grew to be my lord's chief occupation. The sound of their two voices (audible <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>way</b> off, <b>for</b> they spoke loud) became familiar in the neighbourhood; and for my part I found it more agreeable than the sound of birds. It was pretty to see the pair returning full of briers, and the father as flushed and sometimes as bemuddied as the child, for they were equal sharers in all sorts of boyish entertainment, digging in the beach, damming of streams, and what not; and I have seen them gaze through a fence at cattle with the same childish contemplation.|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{collective}} case {{study was to explore}} four instructors' beliefs and actual teaching practice of social media in their STARTALK teacher programs. Based on individual case and cross-case analysis, overall, all participants identified many affordances and challenges regarding the integration of social media and foreign language teacher education. Moreover, a majority of participants' beliefs aligned well with their practices about integrating social media and foreign language teacher education while one participant's beliefs conflicted with her teaching practices. The mixed findings regarding the beliefs and practices of using social media in STARTALK teacher programs suggest that teacher beliefs needs further exploration as a construct. Future research is needed in identifying best practices of various social media in foreign language teacher education and explaining complicated teacher beliefs about the effectiveness of social media in foreign language teaching and teacher education. Regarding implications for practice, foreign language teacher educators may consider more explicit approach and step-by-step guidance when introducing and integrating social media in preparing foreign language teachers. This study is significant for not only filling in the gap in the literature by connecting teacher beliefs, social media, and foreign language teacher education, but also show-casing <b>a</b> <b>great</b> deal of <b>ways</b> <b>for</b> foreign language teacher educators to incorporate social media in their training programs...|$|R
