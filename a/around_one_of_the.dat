25|$|Initially, {{after the}} Second World War, BSA {{motorcycles}} were not generally seen as racing machines, {{compared to the}} likes of Norton.

In 1947 there were but a couple of BSA mounted riders, but by 1952 BSA were in the majority and in 1956 the makeup was 53 BSA, 1 Norton and 1 Velocette.|$|E

500|$|The second {{match of}} the show {{centered}} <b>around</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> classic tropes in Lucha Libre in which one or more young wrestlers tried to earn the respect of veteran wrestlers, often with the veteran wrestlers portraying the rudo role and putting the rookies [...] "in their place". In this case, the [...] "veteran" [...] was Fuerza Guerrera, who felt that the 19-year-old Rey Misterio Jr. had not earned his sport, pushing for his own son, Juventud Guerrera, as the future superstar of Lucha Libre. The Guerreras were also involved in a long-running storyline against the then-reigning Mexican National Tag Team Champions Heavy Metal and Latin Lover over the championship. The Guerreras had aligned themselves with Psicosis, a peer of Juventud Guerrera, who fought Rey Misterio Jr. on several occasions before {{the two of them}} joined AAA. For unexplained reasons, Fuerza Guerrera and Psicosis were not teamed up with Juventud Guerrera for the show but instead were teamed with Gringo Loco member Madonna's Boyfriend for the match against Heavy Metal, Latin Lover, and Rey Misterio Jr.|$|E
500|$|Not all {{fans were}} {{happy with the}} {{direction}} the Fallout series was taken in since its acquisition by Bethesda Softworks. Notorious for their support of the series' first two games, Fallout and Fallout 2, members centered <b>around</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> oldest Fallout fansites, No Mutants Allowed, have criticized departures from the original games' stories, gameplay mechanics and setting. Criticisms include the prevalence of unspoiled food after 200 years, the survival of wood-framed dwellings following a nuclear blast, and the ubiquity of Super Mutants at early levels in the game. Also criticized are {{the quality of the}} game's writing, its level of verisimilitude, the switch to a first-person action game format, and the level of reactiveness of the surrounding game world to player actions. In response, Jim Sterling of Destructoid has called fan groups like No Mutants Allowed [...] "selfish" [...] and [...] "arrogant"; stating that a new audience deserves a chance to play a Fallout game; and that if the series had stayed the way it was back in 1997, new titles would never have been made and brought to market. Luke Winkie of Kotaku tempers these sentiments, saying that {{it is a matter of}} ownership; and that in the case of Fallout 3, hardcore fans of the original series witnessed their favorite games become transformed into something else.|$|E

2500|$|In the 1880s, Cleveland {{was hired}} by the Minneapolis Board of Park Commissioners to create a series of parks and {{interconnected}} parkways to connect and preserve existing natural features in and near the city. The parkways along the Mississippi River gorge were his main interest, but his plan also showed parkway boulevards across town and <b>around</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> lakes in South Minneapolis, Lake Harriet. These grand parkways would increase property values, connect larger parks, drive up the desire for private development, and hopefully increase general revenues in the city over time. [...] This vision was expanded by subsequent park commissioners and superintendents to encircle a series of lakes, now known as the Chain of Lakes, and to follow Minnehaha Creek to Minnehaha Falls. The result of Cleveland’s vision is the famous “Grand Rounds,” an interconnected series of parkways, and parks, centered on the Mississippi River. The official title “Grand Rounds,” came much later, but Cleveland’s vision for the scenic byway is timeless, and the Minneapolis Grand Rounds are known today {{as one of the best}} urban park systems in the world. Plans for a similar system in St. Paul, would have connected it to the Minneapolis system, but they were never completed, with the exception of the parkways along the Mississippi River. In 2017, the City of St. Paul began a several year project to complete its Grand Rounds system.|$|E
2500|$|Tilburg grew <b>around</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{so-called}} [...] "herd places" [...] or [...] "Frankish triangles", triangular plots where {{a number}} of roads (usually sand roads) met. These herd places were collective pasturelands for flocks of sheep. Their shape is still reflected in the layout of many places in Tilburg. Many districts, including Korvel, Oerle, Broekhoven, Hasselt, Heikant, De Schans, and Heuvel, bear the names of these old hamlets. The poor farmers living in these hamlets soon decided not to sell the wool from their sheep but to weave it themselves, {{and for a long}} time, much of the space inside their small houses was occupied by a loom—by the 17th century these numbered about 300. Enterprising people saw their chance. As so-called [...] "drapers" [...] they supplied the weavers with the raw materials for their [...] "home working", and the first Tilburg [...] "mill houses" [...] came into existence. From then on, the wool industry underwent rapid growth, and in 1881 Tilburg had as many as 145 woollen mills. Home weaving continued, however, until the early 20th century. Woollen textiles from Tilburg were known far and wide. After World WarII Tilburg retained its place as wool capital of the Netherlands, but in the 1960s the industry collapsed and by the 1980s the number of wool mills could be counted on the fingers of one hand. Present-day Tilburg industry consists {{of a wide variety of}} enterprises. The main economic sector has become transport and logistics with a variety of industry as a close second.|$|E
