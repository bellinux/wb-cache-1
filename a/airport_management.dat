25|$|A similar {{organization}} {{took place}} from 1945 to 1956, {{where the government}} appointed an accident investigation commission for each accident and incident. These commissions had no permanent organization or members and were appointed for each accident on an ad hoc basis.

In addition it had representatives from the Norwegian Police Service and the Norwegian Prosecuting Authority.|$|E

In 1958, the Civil Aviation Administration—now the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA)—announced the inclusion of Detroit-Wayne in the first group of American airports to receive new long-range radar equipment, enabling the airport to become the first inland airport in the United States certified for jet airliners.

After the consultation, and study of consultant reports, City staff recommended in a report to delay acting on the proposal until 2015. Concerns about the required infrastructure, public health concerns and the lack of an airport master plan were cited by staff. The TPA was also seeking an extension of the <b>airport</b> <b>management</b> agreement as a condition of the proposal. City Council's Executive Committee on December 5 voted to delay consideration of the proposal until 2014.|$|E

40|$|The {{socio-economic}} {{development of}} countries {{is a key}} factor {{for the growth of}} people mobility, bringing an increase of inter and extra continental air passengers flows. On the other side, the leading model business of low cost companies is decreasing the revenues of airports coming from the avio operations. The two effects are increasing the awareness of <b>airports</b> <b>management,</b> historically focused on the avio operations, towards the mix of avio and commercial revenues. AIRBench is a DEA-based benchmark model developed by the ORO Group of Poltecnico di Torino and BDS, a consulting company specialized in the sector of <b>airports</b> <b>management.</b> Differently from other works in the literature, AIRBench uses data that can be obtained by publicly available documents and databases (consolidated balance sheets, web sites, and ENAC data) in order to link both avio and commercial revenues to the airports performances. The DEA-based method is applied to a panel of 21 airports (both Italian and European airports) in order to build a comparison of airports performances and to obtain a panel of reference management practices to evaluate additional airports. Moreover, given the airports considered efficient by the DEA models, a detailed analysis of causes, opportunities and threads for non-efficient airports is presente...|$|R

In doing so, we directly assess the impact of the quality of services delivered by an airport on its productive performance. The study shows that, while Italian airports possess an acceptable level of quality in terms of their infrastructure, their managerial/administrative procedures must be strengthened in order to better deal with both technological modernization and passenger waiting time at the airports...|$|R
500|$|The 1990s {{brought an}} {{opportunity}} to expand operations in the <b>airport</b> <b>management</b> sector, as many countries privatised their airports. When Warsaw Frederic Chopin Airport needed upgrading in the early 1990s, LOT Polish Airlines was unable to afford the cost, so a complex financing arrangement was established whereby a bank would pay Hochtief {{two thirds of the}} costs to upgrade the airport, while the airline assigned to the bank the revenues from aircraft using Polish airspace for a period. The company began to take responsibility for more operational aspects of projects, including service provision, financing, facility management and software development, following a concept of being a [...] "system leader", as set out by CEO Hans-Peter Keitel. These tasks were felt to be higher up the value chain, and would help the firm shake off the slowdown that had followed the initial boom of German reunification. These concepts were notably put into action during the construction of the new Athens International Airport in the late 1990s.|$|E

25|$|<b>Airport</b> <b>management's</b> {{proposal}} for a second runway (south of the existing runway and airport boundary) were unveiled in July 2013.

Another proposal would extend the North Terminal south, with a passenger bridge in the area currently occupied by aircraft stands without jet bridges. Gatwick's draft master plan (released for consultation on 13 October 2011) apparently dropped the passenger-bridge plan in favour of a mid-field satellite (next to the control tower) linking to the North Terminal {{as part of an}} expanded 2030 single-runway, two-terminal airport.|$|R
