There was no hydrolysis {{of any of}} the herbicides in buffer solutions at pH 3 or pH 7; however, slow hydrolysis occurred at pH 9. Estimated half-lives for the three herbicides in solution in the dark were 6. 5, 9. 2 and 9. 6 months for imazaquin, imazethapyr and imazapyr, respectively. Degradation of the herbicides in the light was considerably more rapid than in the dark with half lives for the three herbicides of 1. 8, 9. 8 and 9. 1 days for imazaquin, imazethapyr and imazapyr, respectively. The presence of humic acids in the solution reduced the rate of photodegradation for all three herbicides, with higher concentrations of humic acids generally having greater effect. Photodegradation of imazethapyr was the least sensitive to humic acids. The enantioselectivity of photodegradation was investigated using imazaquin, with photodegradation occurring at the same rate for both enantiomers. <b>Abiotic</b> <b>degradation</b> of {{imidazolinone herbicides}} on the soil surface only occurred in the presence of light.

The {{study shows that}} compound-specific isotope analysis (CSIA) identified an alternative 1, 1, 1 -TCA degradation pathway that cannot be explained by assuming biotic reductive dechlorination. In all biotic microcosms 1, 1, 1 -TCA was degraded with no apparent increase in the biotic degradation product 1, 1 -DCA. 1, 1, 1 -TCA degradation was documented by a clear enrichment in 13 C in all biotic microcosms, {{but not in the}} abiotic control, which suggests biotic or biotically mediated degradation. Biotic degradation by reductive dechlorination of 1, 1 -DCA to CA only occurred in bioaugmented microcosms and in donor stimulated microcosms with low initial 1, 1, 1 -TCA or after significant decrease in 1, 1, 1 -TCA concentration (after ˜day 200). Hence, the primary degradation pathway for 1, 1, 1 -TCA {{does not appear to be}} reductive dechlorination via 1, 1 -DCA. In the biotic microcosms, the degradation of 1, 1, 1 -TCA occurred under iron and sulfate reducing conditions.

40|$|Thermal {{tetrachloroethene}} (PCE) remediation by {{steam injection}} in a sandy aquifer {{led to the}} release of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) from aquifer sediments resulting in more reduced redox conditions, accelerated PCE biodegradation, and changes in microbial populations. These changes were documented by comparing data collected prior to the remediation event and eight years later. Based on the premise that dual C-Cl isotope slopes reflect ongoing degradation pathways, the slopes associated with PCE and TCE suggest the predominance of biotic reductive dechlorination near the source area. PCEwas the predominant chlorinated ethene near the source area prior to thermal treatment. After thermal treatment, c DCE became predominant. The biotic contribution to these changes was supported by the presence of Dehalococcoides sp. DNA (Dhc) and Dhc targeted rRNA close to the source area. In contrast, dual C-Cl isotope analysis together with the almost absent VC 13 C depletion in comparison to c DCE 13 C depletion suggested that c DCE was subject to <b>abiotic</b> <b>degradation</b> due to the presence of pyrite, possible surface-bound iron (II) or reduced iron sulphides in the downgradient part of the plume. This interpretation is supported by the relative lack of Dhc in the downgradient part of the plume.

This, in turn, results in more reduced redox conditions which favor active reductive dechlorination and/or may lead to a series of redox reactions which may consecutively trigger biotically induced <b>abiotic</b> <b>degradation.</b> Finally, this study illustrates the valuable complementary application of compound-specific isotopic analysis combined with molecular biology tools to evaluate which biogeochemical processes are taking place in an aquifer contaminated with chlorinated ethenes...|$|R

The present study assesses the contribution of alkaline hydrolysis into the natural attenuation of RDX and HMX in coastal waters. Alkaline hydrolysis rates were shown to be unaffected by the presence of sodium chloride, the most common component in marine waters. Kinetic parameters (E(a), ln A, k(2)) quantified for the alkaline hydrolysis of RDX and HMX in deionized water (30 - 50 degrees C, pH 10 - 12) agreed relatively well with <b>abiotic</b> <b>degradation</b> rates determined in sterilized natural coastal waters (50 and 60 degrees C, variable salinity) even if the latter were generally slightly faster than the former. Furthermore, similar products (HCHO, NO(2) (-), O(2) NNHCH(2) NHCHO) were obtained on alkaline hydrolysis in deionized water and <b>abiotic</b> <b>degradation</b> in coastal waters. These two findings suggested that degradation of nitramines in sterilized natural coastal waters, away from light, was mainly governed by alkaline hydrolysis.

40|$|International {{audience}} 1. Introduction Glyphosate is {{the principal}} active substance of a weed-killer used worldwide. Its use and migration towards groundwater is of real concern. Both glyphosate and the aminomethyl phosphonic acid (AMPA), one of its degradation product, are among the 10 -most observed pesticides or metabolites in France (SOeS, 2009), usually leading to the classification of the corresponding groundwater as having a bad quality status (in regard to the Water Framework Directive). Moreover, the glyphosate and AMPA can have multiple origins. Glyphosate is used as pesticide in agricultural or non-agricultural contexts, and can be synthesized by different manufacturers. AMPA is either a glyphosate metabolite or is formed by the <b>abiotic</b> <b>degradation</b> of certain phosphonates (present in particular in detergents; Jaworska et al., 2002; Nowack, 2003). Our project aims at showing that the carbon isotope composition ( 13 C) of these two molecules could be of great help for identifying their respective sources, and to assess and characterize potential biodegradation processes that would link AMPA to either its parent pesticide glyphosate or phosphonate molecules. 2. Methodology-Results The {{first step is to}} understand the carbon isotopes behavior and potential isotope fractionation during infiltration and degradation of glyphosate during its transfer in the unsaturated zone of aquifers. With that aim, we designed a lab experiment, in which degradation of glyphosate is tested and isotopically monitored (over a period of 100 days) in various types of soils (covering both biotic and <b>abiotic</b> <b>degradation</b> pathways). After quantification of glyphosate and AMPA concentrations in the studied soils, corresponding  13 C of both glyphosate and AMPA are measured by LC-CFIRMS.

The presence of oxygen groups on the imidazolium cation reduces the toxicity of ionic liquids 1 -alkyl- 3 -methylimidazolium with bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl) imide or octylsulfate anions and simultaneously decreases the value of their octanol-water partition coefficient. The presence of ester functions renders the ionic liquids more easily biodegradable, especially for long alkyl side-chains in the cation but leads to hydrolysis with the formation of reaction products that accumulate. The imidazolium ring is resistant to biodegradability and to <b>abiotic</b> <b>degradation.</b> The oxygen functionalised ionic liquids are more soluble in water and, diffuse more slowly in this medium...|$|R
40|$|Permeable {{reactive}} barriers (PRBs) are innovative {{technologies for}} the in situ remediation of contaminated groundwater. The technology involves the emplacement, into an excavated {{zone of the}} aquifer across the flow path of the contaminated groundwater, of a "reactive" filling material permeable to groundwater to intercept and treat the contaminants as the plume flows through {{under the influence of}} the natural hydraulic gradient. A wide range of materials are currently available. Some of them remove contaminants through non-destructive mechanisms, such as precipitation, sorption or cation exchange (also promoted by geochemistry modifications in the treatment zone), other through destructive mechanisms, such as <b>abiotic</b> <b>degradation</b> or biological degradation (in biobarriers). The choice among these is primarily based on the contaminant to remove and the abatement required, but the hydrogeological and the biogeochemical conditions of the aquifer may have great influence as well. Sometimes, concurrently mechanisms acts in removing the pollutants. Multilayer barrier systems can be developed in order to treat groundwater affected by different kinds of pollutants...|$|R
40|$|Nitrosomonas europaea {{carries out}} {{the first step in}} the {{biological}} nitrogen removal process in wastewater treatment by oxidizing ammonia to nitrite. It has been shown to be sensitive to a wide range of contaminants. The antibiotic oxytetracycline and the heavy metals chromium and silver have been found in wastewater influent. The physiological effects of these compounds on N. europaea have been examined in batch reactors. Select genomic responses of N. europaea after 60 minutes of silver exposure were also examined to identify potential sentinel genes for early contaminant identification. Oxytetracycline undergoes many <b>abiotic</b> <b>degradation</b> reactions, and was not found to cause a significant inhibitory effect on ammonia oxidation at expected environmental concentrations. Trivalent chromium did not significantly affect the nitrification process at environmentally relevant concentrations. Hexavalent chromium slightly inhibited nitrification at concentrations near the high end of the range of industrial effluent concentrations. Silver nitrate significantly inhibited nitrification at concentrations within the range seen in wastewater treatment plants receiving industrial inputs. This inhibition was irreversible and time-dependent...|$|R
40|$|Autoxidation is {{a complex}} <b>abiotic</b> <b>degradation</b> process, and while {{it has long been}} known and well studied in {{biological}} compounds, it has been widely overlooked in environmental samples and as a part of environmental processes. With recent observations showing the magnitude of the involvement of autoxidation in coastal environments, it has become critical to better understand how and why this degradative process takes place. At the riverine/marine interface, recent findings evidenced a spike in autoxidation rates upon the arrival of suspended particulate matter in seawater. In this study, we aimed at identifying autoxidation-favoring factors in vitro by analyzing suspended particulate matter incubated under different conditions. If metal ions have long been known to induce autoxidation in biological systems, we show that they indeed induce autoxidation in particulate matter incubated in water, but also that the content in photochemically-produced hydroperoxides in suspended particulate matter is crucial to the induction of its autoxidation in water...|$|R
40|$|Sulfolane, a {{water-soluble}} organosulfur compound, is used industrially {{worldwide and}} {{is associated with}} one of the largest contaminated groundwater plumes in the state of Alaska. Despite being widely used, little is understood about the degradation of sulfolane in the environment, especially in cold regions. We conducted aerobic and anaerobic microcosm studies to assess the biological and <b>abiotic</b> sulfolane <b>degradation</b> potential of contaminated subarctic aquifer groundwater and sediment from Interior Alaska. We also investigated the impacts of nutrient limitations and hydrocarbon co-contamination on sulfolane degradation. We found that sulfolane underwent biodegradation aerobically but not anaerobically under nitrate, sulfate, or iron-reducing conditions. No <b>abiotic</b> <b>degradation</b> activity was detectable under either oxic or anoxic conditions. Nutrient addition stimulated sulfolane biodegradation in sediment slurries at high sulfolane concentrations (100 mg L- 1), but not at low sulfolane concentrations (500 μg L- 1), and nutrient amendments were necessary to stimulate sulfolane biodegradation in incubations containing groundwater only. Hydrocarbon co-contamination retarded aerobic sulfolane biodegradation rates by ~ 30 %. Our study is the first to investigate the sulfolane biodegradation potential of subarctic aquifer substrate and identifies several important factors limiting biodegradation rates. We concluded that oxygen is an important factor limiting natural attenuation of this sulfolane plume, and that nutrient amendments are unlikely to accelerate biodegradation within in the plume, although they may biostimulate degradation in ex situ groundwater treatment applications. Future work should be directed at elucidating the identity of indigenous sulfolane-degrading microorganisms and determining their distribution and potential activity in the environment...|$|R
30|$|Due to the {{stability}} of PFOA it is, in general, challenging or even impossible to measure its half-life. Nevertheless, some studies are available showing that no <b>abiotic</b> or biotic <b>degradation</b> was observed [74 – 78]. The atmospheric half-life of PFOA derived by analogy from short-chain perfluorinated carboxylic acids is 130 [*]days [90]. For hydrolysis a half-life greater than 92 [*]years is reported based on observations of the APFO concentration in buffered aqueous solutions [32]. Taking all the information together, PFOA does not undergo <b>abiotic</b> or biotic <b>degradation</b> under environmental conditions. Therefore, PFOA is considered to fullfil the persistence criteria of REACH.|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe {{effect of}} {{positional}} isomerism on chemical and photochemical degradations of the Imazamethabenz-methyl (IMBM), a pesticide of the imidazolinone family, has been studied. IMBM is {{proposed in the}} form of a mixture of the two positional isomers: meta and para. The development of an effective HPLC method (resolution factor R = 1. 3) allows us to follow either the abiotic disappearance of the meta and para IMBM and the formation of their breakdown products. The <b>abiotic</b> <b>degradation</b> studies include the chemical hydrolysis, as well as the direct and the indirect photodecomposition. We used TiO 2, a well-known initiator of hydroxyl radicals, to highlight the role of. OH in the indirect photodegradation. This work confirms the different behaviours of positional isomers in the environment. Indeed the chemical or direct photochemical degradation is faster for the meta isomer than for the para. Whereas, concerning IMBM, there is not any prevalent influence of this type of isomerism on the indirect photochemical degradation. The degradation products were tentatively identified by LC-MS, NMR and IR and a degradation pathway was proposed...|$|R
