Very recently, Cooke and Michie (2001) proposed a three-factor solution that divided the core personality features into two dimensions while eliminating antisocial behavior. This study of male, mentally disordered offenders (N = 96) directly compared factor models via confirmatory factor analysis (CFA). When using testlets to combine theoretically similar items into single ratings, the nested three-factor model was <b>an</b> <b>excellent</b> <b>fit.</b> Of importance, {{the development of a}} four-factor model with the inclusion of antisocial items also produced <b>an</b> <b>excellent</b> <b>fit.</b> Combined with recent research, these findings have important ramifications for the construct validity of the PCL-R...|$|R

In our experience, a matrix exponential representation of an empirical distribution produces random variates with <b>an</b> <b>excellent</b> <b>fit</b> with the empirical distribution. This technique is particularly important when the empirical data is very bursty, i. e., has a high variance. In this paper we discuss {{how to find the}} matrix exponential representation of an empirical distribution and we present our technique for generating random variates from the empirical distribution using its matrix exponential representation.

40|$|Recently SO(10) {{models with}} type-II see-saw {{dominance}} {{have been proposed}} as a promising framework for obtaining Grand Unification theories with approximate Tri-bimaximal (TB) mixing in the neutrino sector. We make a general study of SO(10) models with type-II see-saw dominance and show that <b>an</b> <b>excellent</b> <b>fit</b> can be obtained for fermion masses and mixings, also including the neutrino sector. To make this statement more significant we compare the performance of type-II see-saw dominance models in fitting the fermion masses and mixings with more conventional models which have no built-in TB mixing in the neutrino sector. For a fair comparison the same input data and fitting procedure is adopted for all different theories. We find that the type-II dominance models lead to <b>an</b> <b>excellent</b> <b>fit,</b> comparable with the best among the available models, but the tight structure of this framework implies a significantly larger amount of fine tuning with respect to other approaches.

40|$|Buffalograss (Buchloe dactyloides) {{has been}} {{described}} as <b>an</b> <b>excellent</b> <b>fit</b> for Janzen’s ‘‘Foliage is the Fruit’’ (FF) hypothesis, which suggests that large grazing animals ingest and later disperse seeds of some herbs when consuming their foliage. We tested this hypothesis by feeding buffalograss burs and legume seeds to ruminally fistulated beef steers. Our objectives were to determine (1) rumen residence times of buffalograss burs, free buffalograss caryopses and legume seeds; (2) total tract residence times for the three types of propagules; (3) percentage propagule survival after passage and (4) germinability of fed and unfed burs and caryopses. Bur survival (3 %) and germination percentage were lower than previously reported, but this can be explained by differences in feeding and germination procedures. Significant numbers of free caryopses recovered from the feces also germinated. Previously undescribed hairs on the burs’ awn-like projections delayed passage through the animals and assured that many burs were broken during rumination. We concur that buffalograss is <b>an</b> <b>excellent</b> <b>fit</b> for the FF hypothesis, but our results and observations suggest that the buffalograss/grazing-animal interaction is more complex than it initially appeared...|$|R
