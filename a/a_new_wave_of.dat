5|$|The 1991 {{release of}} Forest of Equilibrium, the debut album by UK band Cathedral, helped spark <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>wave</b> <b>of</b> doom metal. During the same period, the doom-death fusion style of British bands Paradise Lost, My Dying Bride, and Anathema {{gave rise to}} European gothic metal, with its {{signature}} dual-vocalist arrangements, exemplified by Norway's Theatre of Tragedy and Tristania. New York's Type O Negative introduced an American take on the style.|$|E
5|$|The raid was {{considered}} successful—489 POWs were liberated, along with 33 civilians. The total included 492Americans, 23British, threeDutch, twoNorwegians, oneCanadian, and oneFilipino. The rescue, {{along with the}} liberation of Camp O'Donnell the same day, allowed the prisoners to tell of the Bataan and Corregidor atrocities, which sparked <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>wave</b> <b>of</b> resolve for the war against Japan.|$|E

5|$|The {{strengthening}} of Germany's {{military presence in}} Serbia resulted in <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>wave</b> <b>of</b> mass executions and war crimes. The commanders who bore the most responsibility for these atrocities were primarily of Austrian origin and {{had served in the}} Austro-Hungarian Army during World War I. Most were ardently anti-Serb, a prejudice that the historian Stevan K. Pavlowitch links to the Nazis' wider anti-Slavic racism.|$|E
5|$|<b>A</b> <b>new</b> <b>wave</b> <b>of</b> Armenian {{immigrants}} {{moved in}} the late 1940s, including Soviet Armenian prisoners of war {{who were able to}} make their way westward after being freed from Nazi camps. The Displaced Persons Act of 1948 allowed people displaced during the World War II to immigrate to the US. From 1944 to 1952, 4,739 Armenians migrated to the US, many with the help of George Mardikian's American National Committee to Aid Homeless Armenians (ANCHA).|$|E
5|$|After the Mongol withdrawal, Béla IV {{abandoned}} his policy of recovering former crown lands. Instead, he granted large estates to his supporters, and {{urged them to}} construct stone-and-mortar castles. He initiated <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>wave</b> <b>of</b> colonization {{that resulted in the}} arrival of a number of Germans, Moravians, Poles, and Romanians. The king re-invited the Cumans and settled them in the plains along the Danube and the Tisza. A group of Alans, the ancestors of the Jassic people, seems to have settled in the kingdom around the same time.|$|E
50|$|Surf {{culture is}} {{reflected}} in surf music, with subgenres such as surf rock and surf pop. This includes works from such artists as Jan and Dean, The Beach Boys, The Surfaris ("Wipe Out!"), Dick Dale, The Shadows, and The Ventures. The music inspired dance crazes such as The Stomp, The Frug, and The Watusi. While the category surf music helped popularize surfing, most surfers at the time, such as Miki Dora, preferred R&B and blues. <b>A</b> <b>newer</b> <b>wave</b> <b>of</b> surf music has started in the acoustic riffs of artists such as Jack Johnson and Donavon Frankenreiter, who are both former professional surfers.|$|R

5|$|After {{the fall}} of the Kingdom of Bosnia into the Ottoman hands in 1463, the {{southern}} and central parts of the Kingdom of Croatia remained unprotected, the defense of which was left to Croatian gentry who kept smaller troops in the fortified border areas at their own expense. Decisive Ottoman victory at the Battle of Krbava field in 1493, shook all of Croatia. However, it did not dissuade the Croats from making more decisive and persistent attempts at defending themselves against the attacks of the much larger enemy. <b>A</b> <b>new</b> <b>wave</b> <b>of</b> Ottoman conquest began in 1521, after which a good portion of Croatia was conquered or pillaged.|$|E
5|$|Another {{division}} among Christians occurred, when Leo III {{ordered the}} destruction of icons throughout the Empire. This led to a significant religious crisis, which ended in mid-9th century with the restoration of icons. During the same period, <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>wave</b> <b>of</b> pagans emerged in the Balkans, originating mainly from Slavic people. These were gradually Christianised, and by Byzantium's late stages, Eastern Orthodoxy represented most Christians and, in general, most people in {{what remained of the}} Empire.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the rise}} of {{classical}} genetics, many biologists—including <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>wave</b> <b>of</b> physical scientists in biology—pursued {{the question of the}} gene and its physical nature. Warren Weaver—head of the science division of the Rockefeller Foundation—issued grants to promote research that applied the methods of physics and chemistry to basic biological problems, coining the term molecular biology for this approach in 1938; many of the significant biological breakthroughs of the 1930s and 1940s were funded by the Rockefeller Foundation.|$|E
50|$|By {{the early}} 1970s, {{there was a}} growing {{conflict}} between the original activists of the Family Squatting Movement and <b>a</b> <b>newer</b> <b>wave</b> <b>of</b> squatters who simply rejected the right of landlords to charge rent and who believed (or claimed to) that seizing property and living rent-free was a revolutionary political act or more practically decided {{it was a good}} way to save money. These new-wave squatters (often young and single rather than homeless families) were a mixture of anarchists, Trotskyists—the International Marxist Group (IMG) being especially prominent—and self-proclaimed hippie dropouts, and they denounced the idea that squatters should seek to make agreements with local Councils to use empty property and that Squatting Associations should then become landlords (or Self Help Housing Associations as they were sometimes styled) in their own right and charge rent.|$|R
50|$|In July 1979 British {{band the}} Flying Lizards {{released}} <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>wave</b> version <b>of</b> the song, {{as a single}} and on their eponymous first album.

5000|$|In mid-2005, Verona {{went back}} to the studio to record demos that in the end became an album.

5|$|Having been raided twice by the Mongols {{within a}} single year, Transylvania felt the {{consequences}} of the invasion of 12411242 for more than two decades. The administrative centers of the province, such as Alba Iulia and Cetatea de Baltă, had been destroyed. Due to the severe depopulation, a process of organized colonization commenced that lasted for several decades. For example, <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>wave</b> <b>of</b> colonization resulted in the establishment of the Saxon seats of Sighişoara and Mediaş; and the lord of Ilia received, in 1292, royal permission to settle Romanians in the lands he owned.|$|E
5|$|In {{paintings}} and engravings of the 18th and 19th centuries, Pugs usually appear with longer legs and noses than today, and sometimes with cropped ears. The modern Pug's appearance probably changed after 1860 when <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>wave</b> <b>of</b> Pugs were imported directly from China. These Pugs had shorter {{legs and the}} modern-style Pug nose. The British aristocrat Lady Brassey is credited with making black Pugs fashionable after she brought some back from China in 1886. Ear cropping was made illegal in 1895.|$|E
5|$|In the mid-1920s, New York's {{metropolitan}} area surpassed London's as the world's most populous {{metropolitan area}}. New York City's metropolitan area exceeded ten {{million by the}} early 1930s. The economic boom of the 1920s and the great speculation {{of the real estate}} market fostered <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>wave</b> <b>of</b> skyscraper projects in the city. The 1916 Zoning Resolution restricted the height that the street-side exterior walls of New York City buildings could rise before they needed to incorporate setbacks that recessed the buildings' exterior walls away from the streets. This led to the construction of Art Deco structures in New York City with significant setbacks, large volumes, and striking silhouettes that were often decorated elaborately.|$|E
5000|$|The {{ferocity of}} the Nagorno-Karabakh War was {{revealed}} to the viewers across Russia and CIS countries after the infamous evening prime-time TV show [...] "600 Seconds" [...] aired investigative journalist Alexander Nevzorov's shocking reportage directly {{from one of the}} battles of Operation Goranboy. After that display the Nagorno-Karabakh War gained <b>a</b> whole <b>new</b> <b>wave</b> <b>of</b> coverage and debate within Russian mass-media.|$|R
50|$|In the {{following}} two hundred years the iron industry would wane, but the agricultural heritage within Penns Valley would continue, and {{with the growth of}} a small land grant university just to the east in State College, The Pennsylvania State University would give the region <b>a</b> <b>new</b> academic <b>wave</b> <b>of</b> prosperity for the 21st century.|$|R
50|$|At that time, many favored Isaac Newton's corpuscular {{theory of}} light, {{among them the}} {{theoretician}} Siméon Denis Poisson. In 1818 the French Academy of Sciences launched a competition to explain the properties of light, where Poisson {{was one of the}} members of the judging committee. The civil engineer Augustin-Jean Fresnel entered this competition by submitting <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>wave</b> theory <b>of</b> light.|$|R
5|$|The bridge {{opened in}} 1921 and spurred <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>wave</b> <b>of</b> {{development}} in South Jacksonville. New subdivisions were platted in Oklahoma and Villa Alexandria, including South Shores, Alexandria Place, River Oaks, {{and the original}} San Marco development, while the old Red Bank plantation became South Riverside and Colonial Manor. The 1857 the Red Bank Plantation House became a residence in the Colonial Manor neighborhood that grew around it; it is Jacksonville's second oldest residential building still in use. The bridge triggered economic development in South Jacksonville as well, though it greatly reduced the ferry business, which disappeared entirely within twenty years.|$|E
5|$|The mid-1970s saw the {{beginning}} of <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>wave</b> <b>of</b> Canadian comics, {{one in which the}} creators chose to remain in Canada, rather than seeking their fortunes south of the border. Richard Comely's Captain Canuck appeared in July 1975, the first appearance of a non-satirical superhero in Canada since the 1940s. During the 1950s and 1960s, the idea of native comics seemed unattainable to Canadian kids, and the appearance of Captain Canuck gave these kids the optimism to make their own. This was followed up with James Waley's more professional, newsstand-distributed Orb, which featured a number of talents that would later take part in the North American comics scene.|$|E
5|$|A new offer {{had arrived}} for Pei from the Chinese {{government}} in 1982. With {{an eye toward}} the transfer of sovereignty of Hong Kong from the British in 1997, authorities in China sought Pei's aid on a new tower for the local branch of the Bank of China. The Chinese government was preparing for <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>wave</b> <b>of</b> engagement {{with the outside world}} and sought a tower to represent modernity and economic strength. Given the elder Pei's history with the bank before the Communist takeover, government officials visited the 89-year-old man in New York to gain approval for his son's involvement. Pei then spoke with his father at length about the proposal. Although the architect remained pained by his experience with Fragrant Hill, he agreed to accept the commission.|$|E

5000|$|In {{the late}} 19th and early 20th centuries, <b>a</b> <b>new</b> large <b>wave</b> <b>of</b> {{immigrants}} from Portugal arrived. From 1881 to 1991, over 1.5 million Portuguese immigrated to Brazil. In 1906, for example, there were 133,393 Portuguese-born {{people living in}} Rio de Janeiro, comprising 16% of the city's population. Rio is still today considered the largest [...] "Portuguese city" [...] outside of Portugal itself.|$|R
50|$|The Commonwealth {{was forced}} to cede the Duchy of Livonia north of the Daugava River to Sweden, and {{retained}} only a nominal control over the south-eastern territories near Riga {{as well as the}} Duchy of Courland. The truce lasted till March 1625, when <b>a</b> <b>new</b> war <b>wave</b> <b>of</b> hostilities erupted in Lithuania. It was soon followed by the Polish-Swedish War (1625-1629).|$|R
5|$|<b>A</b> <b>new</b> <b>wave</b> <b>of</b> reforms {{supported}} by progressive magnates {{such as the}} Czartoryski family and King Stanisław August were introduced at the Partition Sejm. The most important included the 1773 establishment of the Commission of National Education (Komisja Edukacji Narodowej)the first ministry {{of education in the}} world. New schools were opened, uniform textbooks were printed, teachers received better education and poor students were provided with scholarships. The Commonwealth's military was to be modernized and funding to create a larger standing army was agreed. Economic and commercial reformsincluding some intended to cover the increased military budget previously shunned as unimportant by the szlachtawere introduced. A new executive assembly, the 36-strong Permanent Council comprising five ministries with limited legislative powers, was established, giving the Commonwealth a governing body in constant session between Sejms and therefore immune to their liberum veto disruptions.|$|E
5|$|In 1920, the women's rights {{movement}} won {{passage of a}} constitutional amendment granting women's suffrage. The 1920s and 1930s saw the rise of radio for mass communication and the invention of early television. The prosperity of the Roaring Twenties ended with the Wall Street Crash of 1929 and {{the onset of the}} Great Depression. After his election as president in 1932, Franklin D. Roosevelt responded with the New Deal, which included the establishment of the Social Security system. The Great Migration of millions of African Americans out of the American South began before World War I and extended through the 1960s; whereas the Dust Bowl of the mid-1930s impoverished many farming communities and spurred <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>wave</b> <b>of</b> western migration.|$|E
5|$|In the 1960s, Feynman began {{thinking}} of writing an autobiography, {{and he began}} granting interviews to historians. In the 1980s, working with Ralph Leighton (Robert Leighton's son), he recorded chapters on audio tape that Robert transcribed. The book was published in 1985 as Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman! and became a best-seller. The publication of the book brought <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>wave</b> <b>of</b> protest about Feynman's attitude toward women. There had been protests over his alleged sexism in 1968, and again in 1972. It did not help that Jenijoy La Belle, who had been hired as Caltech's first female professor in 1969, was refused tenure in 1974. She filed suit with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, which ruled against Caltech in 1977, adding {{that she had been}} paid less than male colleagues. La Belle finally received tenure in 1979. Many of Feynman's colleagues were surprised that he took her side. He had gotten to know her, and both liked and admired her.|$|E
2500|$|The sudden {{growth of}} the Klan in the 1920s in Maine {{followed}} national trends, but was particularly strong in comparison to Klan activity elsewhere in the Northeast. Partly it revived much older Protestant/Irish-Catholic divisions, {{but it was also}} fueled by <b>a</b> <b>newer</b> <b>wave</b> <b>of</b> Catholic French-Canadian immigrants who worked mainly in Maine’s textile mill cities, such as Lewiston, Saco, Biddeford, Brunswick, etc., and Italian, Polish, Lithuanians, and other mostly Catholic immigrants who went to work in paper mills in northern Maine cities like Millinocket and Rumford. Irish-Catholics had also made gains in municipal politics, along with a small urban Jewish community, while rural areas had declined at the expense of a few cities such as Portland, Bangor, and Lewiston. Maine's small African-American communities in Portland and Bangor had formed NAACP chapters in 1920, and the one in Bangor had protested against the third local showing of the Klan-themed movie Birth of a Nation, successfully negotiating with a local theatre-owner to edit out the most provocative scene.|$|R

Most of them were doctors, lawyers, architects and artists (such as composers, writers, and stage and film directors).|$|R
