500|$|Ice-T {{introduced}} the band at Lollapalooza in 1991, devoting {{half of his}} set to his hip hop songs, and half to Body Count songs, increasing his appeal with both alternative rock fans and middle-class teenagers. Many considered the Body Count performances to be {{the highlight of the}} tour. The group made its first album appearance on Ice-T's 1991 solo album O.G. Original Gangster. The song [...] "Body Count" [...] was preceded by a staged interview in which the performer referred to the group as a [...] "black hardcore band," [...] stating that [...] "as far as I'm concerned, music is music. I don't look at it as rock, R & B, or all that kind of stuff. I just look at it as music. [...] I do what I like <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>happen</b> to like rock 'n' roll, and I feel sorry for anybody who only listens to one form of music." ...|$|E
2500|$|I {{heard that}} if a tree follows a rope it will be straight, and if an empress {{followed}} suggestions she would be holy. [...] Therefore, the ancient holy rulers always had seven advisors {{who were willing to}} speak honestly and willing to die if their suggestions were not followed. [...] Your Imperial Majesty is willing to receive our weed-like suggestions, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>happen</b> to be serving here in an administration that has no taboos. [...] I am willing to offer my wild words.|$|E
6000|$|... "But {{they will}} engage you, lad, {{for they are}} hard up for an {{assistant}} blacksmith just now, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>happen</b> to be hand-and-glove with some o' the chief men of the yard, who'll be happy to take anyone recommended by me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I came to {{take him}} along with me, if he hadn't gone yet. Harry said he {{expected}} him up {{to spend the day}} or maybe a week, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>happened</b> to be in the city since yesterday." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "He was sailing his boat, {{and it got}} stuck, and {{he threw}} in some stones to get it off; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> helped him, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>happened</b> to hit the mast of his beastly boat, and then he flew at me like a tiger, and that's all." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The {{other three}} have gone," [...] <b>I</b> said, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>happened</b> {{to be looking}} at Johnson as I spoke. Was it the shadow of a {{satisfied}} smile that crossed his thin lips? I do not know; but at least he did not weep.|$|R
6000|$|... "Possibly," [...] replied Ashe. [...] "It {{would be}} a long {{business}} to stop the next man in the street and ask him what crimes he never committed and why not. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>happen</b> to be busy, so you'll excuse me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "True, Gertie," [...] said Hans, {{using the}} only name {{which he had}} yet heard applied to the girl; [...] "true, we Cape-Dutchmen are big fellows as a race, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>happen</b> to be {{somewhat}} longer than my fellows. I hope you don't object to me on that account?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Lor', no, sir; under thirty, I should say. He {{is a free}} handed sort of chap, {{and though}} he aint {{particular}} about his eating, he likes a bottle of good wine, the old woman says, {{even if it is}} only with a chop. He never rides past here <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>happen</b> to be outside without tossing me a shilling to drink his health." ...|$|E
5000|$|... "In 1920, I {{spent six}} weeks {{with my father}} whose office {{at the time was}} in Aurora, Illinois, not far from Chicago. Dad <b>and</b> <b>I</b> spent a few {{week-ends}} with the Johnsons. Once when Bessie <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>happened</b> to be alone, she said to me with some feeling, 'I almost feel like you were my own son.'" [...] Mat Thompson ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That's so," [...] Mr. Coulson admitted. [...] "I know he {{deposited}} a pocketbook {{with the}} purser, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>happened</b> {{to be standing}} by when he received it back. I noticed that he had three or four thousand-dollar bills, and there didn't seem to be anything of the sort upon {{him when he was}} found." ...|$|R
6000|$|I slept badly on {{our first}} night at Rome; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>happened</b> to be awake while the man was talking of us confidentially in the {{courtyard}} of the hotel--just under my bedroom window. Here, {{to the best of my}} recollection, is a faithful report of what he said to some friend among the servants who understood English: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That piano," [...] Gaites {{went on with}} {{unabated}} violence, [...] "started from Boston at {{the beginning}} of the week; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>happen</b> to know that it's been lying two or three days at Burymouth, instead of going on to Lower Merritt, as it ought to have done at once. It ought to have been in Lower Merritt Wednesday afternoon at the latest, and here it is at Kent Harbor Saturday morning!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, mother, I cannot, {{for they}} are far worse off than these. Having been reared in affluence, with {{tenderer}} feelings and weaker muscles, {{as well as more}} delicate health, they are much less able to fight the battle of adversity than the lower poor, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>happen</b> to know that the dear Misses Seaward are reduced just now to the very last extreme of poverty. But you have relieved them, mother." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Rot. It's {{been done}} before, and nobody said anything. A chap in Seymour's who left last Easter sold all his stock lines by auction {{on the last}} day of term. They were Virgil mostly and Greek numerals. They sold like hot cakes. There were about five hundred of them altogether. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>happen</b> to know that every word of them has been given up and passed all right." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Surely, sir,' said Psmith, 'you are wrong? Surely your {{jurisdiction}} ceases after office hours? Any little misunderstanding we {{may have}} {{at the close of}} the day's work cannot affect you officially. You could not, for instance, dismiss me from the service of the bank if we were partners at bridge at the club <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>happened</b> to revoke.' ...|$|R
60|$|I do {{not believe}} this. I used to sit up with Pansay {{sometimes}} when Heatherlegh was called out to patients, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>happened</b> to be within claim. The man would make me most unhappy by describing in a low, even voice, the procession that was always passing {{at the bottom of}} his bed. He had a sick man's command of language.|$|R
6000|$|When the Doctor {{had made}} his examination, {{he told us that}} there was {{seemingly}} no change. He added that nevertheless he would like to stay in the house that night is he might. Miss Trelawny looked glad, and sent word to Mrs. Grant to get a room ready for him. Later in the day, when he <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>happened</b> to be alone together, he said suddenly: ...|$|R
60|$|Of course, Mr. Bunter, {{the mate}} of the Sapphire, was not black. He {{was no more}} black than you or I, and {{certainly}} as white as any chief mate of a ship {{in the whole of}} the Port of London. His complexion was of the sort that did not take the tan easily; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>happen</b> to know that the poor fellow had had a month's illness just before he joined the Sapphire.|$|E
60|$|ATTEN. But pray, {{if you can}} {{remember}} them, tell me of some places of scripture that speak against pride. I the rather desire this because that pride is now a reigning sin, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>happen</b> sometimes {{to fall into the}} company of them that in my conscience are proud, very much, and I have a mind also to tell them of their sin, now when I tell them of it, unless I bring God's Word too, I doubt they will laugh me to scorn.|$|E
6000|$|... 'He {{looked a}} bit green at that,' said Dallas. 'Said the row didn't {{interfere}} with him. [...] "Does with us," [...] I said. [...] "It's all very well for you. You aren't doing a stroke of work. No amount of row matters to a chap who's only delivering a rotten sermon on scholarship. Vaughan <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>happen</b> {{to be trying to}} do some work." [...] "All right," [...] he said, [...] "if you want the row stopped, why don't you go and stop it? What's it got to do with me?"' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Anyhow, his keenness isn't {{enough to}} make him turn out for house-fielding. If you really want to know, that's why you've got your first instead of him. You sweated away, and {{improved}} your fielding twenty per cent.; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>happened</b> to be talking to Firby-Smith and found that young Mike had been shirking his, so out he went. A bad field's bad enough, but a slack field wants skinning." ...|$|R
5000|$|In July 2012, {{during an}} {{interview}} with MTV, Jay Sean revealed about the collaboration with Afrojack. He said [...] "Afrojack {{was working in the}} same studio that I was in when I was recording the album, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>happened</b> to bump into him. We recognized each other, so we checked out. He played me a couple of his songs; I played him a couple of my songs. We were like, 'Yo, let's do something together.'" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Heaven forbid! It {{would be}} an {{impertinence}} in me to praise a work of his--to pronounce on its quality; <b>and</b> that <b>I</b> <b>happen</b> to like it can be of no consequence to him." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{never can}} tell," [...] said Judson. [...] "My {{impression}} is that Freddie did. It's my belief that there's something on his mind these days. Before he went to London with his lordship the other day he was behaving very strange. And since he came back it's my belief {{that he has been}} brooding. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>happen</b> to know he followed the affair of Lord Stockheath pretty closely, for he clipped the clippings out of the paper. I found them myself one day when I happened to be going through his things." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Then, Mrs. Malory, {{as it is}} {{awkward to}} discuss these {{intimate}} matters with me, might I {{suggest that you should}} have an interview with Mrs. Brown-Smith herself? I assure you that you can trust her, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>happen</b> to know that her view of the man about whom we are talking is exactly your own. More I could say as to her reasons and motives, but we entirely decline to touch on the past or to offer any opinion about the characters of our patients--the persons about whose engagements we are consulted. He might have murdered his grandmother or robbed a church, but my lips would be sealed.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, Judge, that isn't Emerson," [...] he answered. [...] "It's just common sense, only {{it sounds}} to you like drivel. I'm going now,--unless {{you want to hear}} some more about the plots I've been getting into. But I want to say this. I ask you to {{remember}} that you're my father, and that--I'm fond of you. And that, if you <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>happen</b> to be on opposite sides, it won't make any difference as far as my feelings are concerned. I'm always ready to tell you frankly what I'm doing, if you wish to know. Good-by. I suppose I'll see you in Ripton {{at the end of the}} week." [...] And he pressed his father's shoulder.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, she {{has always}} refused, but I have been very persistent. I just {{thought that she was}} perhaps a little shy, or found it {{difficult}} to break through her retirement--people get like that, you know, when they live alone. So this morning I really went for her, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>happened</b> to be looking, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> saw something in her face which puzzled me. It stopped my asking her any more. There is something underneath her quiet manner and self-devotion. She has had trouble of some sort." ...|$|R
60|$|To {{tell the}} truth, though, about the pin, {{although}} I mentioned it almost {{the last thing}} in the previous chapter, I assure you it was by no means {{the last thing in}} my thoughts. It had come home from Mr. Polonius's, as I said, on Saturday night; <b>and</b> Gus <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>happened</b> to be out enjoying ourselves, half-price, at Sadler's Wells; and perhaps we took a little refreshment on our way back: but {{that has nothing to do}} with my story.|$|R
6000|$|... "I know {{it would}} be very American, and all that, but <b>I</b> <b>happen</b> to be an American, and it wouldn't be out of {{character}} for me. I suppose," [...] he appealed to Mrs. March, [...] "that it's something I might offer to do if it were from New York to Florida--and <b>I</b> <b>happened</b> to be going there? <b>And</b> <b>I</b> did <b>happen</b> to be going to Holland." ...|$|R
6000|$|... “And how the devil—I {{beg your}} pardon, Mr. Grant,” {{interrupted}} Richard: “but {{how is the}} poor devil to get his logs to the Philadelphia market, pray? put them in his pocket, ha! {{as you would a}} handful of chestnuts, or a bunch of chicker-berries? I should like to see you walking up High Street, with a pine log in each pocket!— Poh! poh! Cousin ‘Duke, there are trees enough for us all, and some to spare. Why, I can hardly tell which way the wind blows, when I’m out in the clearings, they are so thick and so tall; I couldn’t at all, if it wasn’t for the clouds, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>happen</b> to know all the points of the compass, as it were, by heart.” ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It's a darned shame," [...] said Billie indignantly. [...] "Babe {{is only a}} kid. This is {{the first}} show she's been in. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>happen</b> to know there's an awfully nice boy over in New York crazy to marry her. And I'm certain this gink is giving her a raw deal. He tried {{to get hold of}} me about a week ago, but I turned him down hard; and I suppose he thinks Babe is easier. And it's no good talking to her; she thinks he's wonderful. That's another kick I have against the show business. It seems to make girls such darned chumps. Well, I wonder how much longer Mr. Arbuckle is going to be {{retrieving}} my mail. What ho, within there, Fatty!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Will {{you think}} it very rude of me if I ask you to let me be one of [...] your party on your {{expedition}} up the river to-morrow? I heard of it [...] from your son Algernon {{last night at the}} Balfours', <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>happen</b> to [...] be very anxious to meet one of the ladies you have invited. Now, [...] I know you're kindness itself to all your young friends in all [...] these little matters, and I'm sure you won't be angry with me for [...] so coolly inviting myself. If I hadn't felt perfect confidence in [...] your invariable goodness, I wouldn't have ventured to do so. Please [...] don't answer unless you've no room for me, but expect me to turn up [...] at half-past two.|$|E
6000|$|... "Hello? Professor Frazer?... This {{is one of}} your {{students}} in modern drama. I've just learned--I happened to be up in the Academic Building <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>happened</b> {{to find out that}} Professor Drood is making a report to the faculty--special meeting!--about your last lecture. I've got a hunch he's going to slam you. I don't want to butt in, but I'm awfully worried; I thought perhaps you ought to know.... Who? Oh, I'm just one of {{your students}}.... You're welcome. Oh, say, Professor, g-good luck. G'-by." ...|$|R
6000|$|Lucilla <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>happened,</b> on that evening, to be {{guests at}} the rectory table. It {{was one of the}} regular {{occasions}} on which we left our own side of the house, and joined the family at (what Mr. Finch called) [...] "the pastor's evening meal." [...] He had got his wife; he had got his eldest daughter; he had got your humble servant. A horrid smile of enjoyment overspread the reverend gentleman's face, as he surveyed us from {{the opposite end of the}} room, and opened his vocal fire on his audience of three.|$|R
6000|$|... "What is it, you silly girl?" [...] said Mowbray, gently {{disengaging}} {{himself from}} her hold.--"What {{is it you}} can have to ask that needs such a solemn preface?--Remember, <b>I</b> hate prefaces; <b>and</b> when <b>I</b> <b>happen</b> to open a book, always skip them." ...|$|R
