DCV operates at reduced <b>air</b> <b>flow</b> <b>rates</b> during {{a large amount of}} the operation time. Due to this decrease, less energy is needed for fan operation and heating/cooling the supply air. However, uncertainty still exists about the IAQ performance and ventilation efficiency in the room, especially at lower <b>air</b> <b>flow</b> <b>rates.</b> Aim {{of this paper is to}} evaluate the IAQ performance, ventilation efficiency, operation and energy efficiency of DCV in school and office buildings based on measurement results. This research was done in cooperation with Flemish manufacturers of ventilation components, engineering offices designing HVAC and industrial federations. Four case studies with large and varying occupancy and with different use and ventilation systems are selected. First case study is a school building with natural air supply and mechanical extraction controlled by measured indoor CO 2 concentration. Second study consist of an educational building with lecture rooms. In this building balanced mechanical ventilation is controlled by CO 2 and temperature measured at the extract air grill. Finally, in two different office buildings, three landscaped offices are evaluated. Here the balanced mechanical ventilation is controlled by CO 2 concentration and temperature. To evaluate IAQ, ventilation efficiency and the energy savings of the system, the following parameters are monitored: CO 2 concentrations and air? temperatures at different positions in the room and at the extract air grill, position of the variable air volume (VAV) boxes, supply and extract <b>air</b> <b>flow</b> <b>rates</b> and the occupancy of the room. Measurements lasted for at least two typical weeks in autumn and winter 2015 - 2016.

Moreover, during the measurement period, the reduction of the fan energy ranges from 25 - 55 % compared to a constant air volume system (CAV). For the heat losses, the reduction was 25 - 32 % compared to a CAV during the measurement period. Energy reductions of both the fan and heat losses are calculated according to a design airflow rate of 29 m 3 /h. pers, i. e., IDA 3 in EN 13779.
