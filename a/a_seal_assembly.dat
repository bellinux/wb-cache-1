50|$|A typical {{nuclear reactor}} {{prevents}} the coolant medium from directly contacting the fuel pellets either by cladding the fuel pellets, sealing the fuel pellets inside a fuel rod or running the coolant through separate piping.

Some of these products poison the reaction ultimately leading to poor efficiency well before {{a significant portion of}} the fuel is used up. At this time the reactor requires re-fueling. Keeping the fuel and coolant separate can present significant design challenges as well. For example, the metal tubing required to do so cannot be operated at temperatures above its melting point which is generally significantly lower than the fuel pellet.

As a consequence of certain disadvantages which accompany dynamic unloading and numerous difficulties encountered {{in the use of}} <b>a</b> rotating <b>seal,</b> the possibility of employing simpler, seal-less zonal rotors to effect similar quantitative biological separations was investigated. Three seal-less zonal rotors were tested which were loaded either statically or dynamically but were always statically unloaded. The rotors were designed so that the liquid density gradient underwent a stable reorientation between a vertical and radial array during acceleration and deceleration. Rotor performance was evaluated using variety of techniques and the rotors then applied to a series of quantitative tissue fractionations. These included: (l) the separation of whole homogenates of liver into fractions containing nuclei, mitochondria, lysosomes, rnicrosomes and soluble constituents; (2) the separation of discrete populations of liver nuclei on the basis of size differences; (3) the separation of lysosomes and peroxisomes using a replenished gradient technique; (4) the isolation of protein bodies from seeds and (5) the separation of intact and broken chloroplasts from plant leaves. In addition to providing a simpler means for separating cellular components by zonal centrifugation, the reorienting gradient rotors were found to provide a number of interesting and important advantages over zonal rotors with rotating seals...|$|R

At the interface between two pressurized modules, each with {{a version of the}} LIDS attached, <b>a</b> composite elastomer-metal <b>seal</b> <b>assembly</b> prevents the breathable air from escaping into the vacuum of space. Attached to the active LIDS, this seal mates against the passive LIDS during docking operation. The main interface <b>seal</b> <b>assembly</b> must exhibit low leak and outgas values, must be able to withstand various harsh space environments, must remain operational over a range of temperatures from - 50 C to 75 C, and perform after numerous docking cycles. This paper presents results from a comprehensive study of the mechanical performance of four candidate subscale <b>seal</b> <b>assembly</b> designs at - 50, 23, 50, and 75 C test temperatures. In particular, the force required to fully compress the seal during docking, and that which is required for separation during the undocking operation were measured. The height of subscale main interface seal bulbs, as well as the test temperature, were shown to {{have a significant effect on}} the forces the main interface seal of the LIDS may experience during docking and undocking operations. The average force values required to fully compress each of the <b>seal</b> <b>assemblies</b> were shown to increase with test temperature by approximately 50 % from - 50 to 75 C. Also, the required compression forces were shown to increase as the height of the seal bulb was increased. The seal design with the tallest elastomer seal bulb, which was 31 % taller than that with the shortest bulb, required force values approximately 45 % higher than those for the shortest bulb, independent of the test temperature. The force required to separate the seal was shown to increase with decreasing temperature after 15 hours of simulated docking. No adhesion force was observed at 75 C, while magnitudes of up to 235 lbf were recorded at the refrigerated temperature. In addition, the adhesion force was observed to increase with bulb height. When compared with the LIDS program requirements, the measured compression force values were found to be below the maximum allowable load allotted to the main interface seal.

40|$|Abstract: A {{small-scale}} scroll expander {{was developed}} and tested. The expander {{was based on a}} compliant scroll compressor having a displacement of ∼ 6. 8 cm 3. A test loop was also developed for determining expander performance parameters. The loop employed a compressor to pressur-ize the working fluid up to 2758 kPa and a heat exchanger to create the expander inlet conditions that would characterize an operating power cycle. The expander was tested with R 134 a as the working fluid. For power output measurements, a dynamometer was used where torque and rotational rate weremeasured. An important feature in adapting a scroll compressor to expander duty was the lubrication of the scroll wraps during operation and the lubrication required by the journal bearings within the expander housing. The approach used in this study was to dissolve a compatible oil into the circulating working fluid to lubricate the wraps, while a pump was employed to deliver pressurized oil to the bearings. The pressurized oil supply was also used to generate a controlled force to the upper stationary scroll wrap through <b>a</b> <b>sealed</b> piston <b>assembly.</b> This force maintained axial contact between the upper and lower scroll wraps during operation. After expansion, the R 134 a vapour passed through an orifice flow meter and then to a liquid-cooled heat exchanger. It then enters a compressor and heat exchanger to complete the flow loop. A series of performance tests were conducted on the expander at various expander rota-tional speeds, inlet and outlet pressures, and scroll sealing pressures. Test results show consistent isentropic efficiencies of over 70 per cent for the expander at its maximum efficiency operating points. The expander performance, however, is a function of speed, pressure ratio, and scroll sealing pressure...|$|R
