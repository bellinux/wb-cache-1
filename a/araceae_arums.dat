50|$|Cryptocoryne is a genus {{of aquatic}} monocot plants {{from the family}} <b>Araceae</b> (<b>arums).</b> The genus is {{naturally}} distributed in tropical regions of Asia and New Guinea.|$|E
50|$|Fruits {{of plants}} of the <b>Araceae</b> (<b>Arum</b> family) often contain Raphides and Trichosclereids - {{needle-like}} structures of calcium oxalate. In M. deliciosa, unripe fruit containing these needle-like crystalline structures can cause irritation of the mouth.|$|R
50|$|The {{poisonous}} plant dumb cane (Dieffenbachia) contains the substance and on ingestion can prevent speech and be suffocating. It {{is also found}} in rhubarb (in large quantities in the leaves), cinnamon, turmeric and in species of Oxalis, <b>Araceae,</b> <b>Arum</b> Italicum, taro, kiwifruit, tea leaves, agaves, Virginia creeper (Parthenocissus quinquefolia), and Alocasia and in spinach in varying amounts. Plants of the Philodendron genus contain enough calcium oxalate that consumption of parts of the plant can result in uncomfortable symptoms. Insoluble calcium oxalate crystals are found in plant stems, roots, and leaves and produced in idioblasts.|$|R

5000|$|In botany, a spadix (pronounced , [...] ""; plural spadices , [...] "") {{is a type}} of spike {{inflorescence}} having small flowers borne on a fleshy stem. Spadices {{are typical}} of the family <b>Araceae,</b> the <b>arums</b> or aroids. The spadix is typically surrounded by a leaf-like curved bract known as a spathe. For example, the [...] "flower" [...] of the well known Anthurium spp. is a typical spadix with a large colorful spathe.|$|R
50|$|A spathe {{is a large}} bract or pair of bracts {{forming a}} sheath to enclose the flower cluster of such plants as palms, arums, Irises, Crocuses, and dayflowers. In many <b>arums</b> (<b>Araceae</b> family), the spathe is petal-like, {{attracting}} pollinators to the flowers arranged on a type of spike called a spadix.|$|R
40|$|To date, limited {{numbers of}} dental {{calculus}} samples have been analyzed by researchers in diverse {{parts of the}} world. The combined analyses of these have provided some general guidelines {{for the analysis of}} calculus that is non-destructive to archaeological teeth. There is still a need for a quantitative study of large numbers of calculus samples to establish protocols, assess the level of contamination, evaluate the quantity of microfossils in dental calculus, and to compare analysis results with the literature concerning the biology of calculus formation. We analyzed dental calculus from 53 teeth from four Brazilian sambaquis. Sambaquis are the shell-mounds that were established prehistorically along the Brazilian coast. The analysis of sambaqui dental calculi shows that there are relatively high concentrations of microfossils (phytoliths and starch), mineral fragments, and charcoal in dental calculus. Mineral fragments and charcoal are possibly contaminants. The largest dental calculi have the lowest concentrations of microfossils. Biologically, this is explained by individual variation in calculus formation between people. Importantly, starch is ubiquitous in dental calculus. The starch and phytoliths show that certainly Dioscorea (yam) and Araucaria angustifolia (Parana pine) were eaten by sambaqui people. <b>Araceae</b> (<b>arum</b> family), Ipomoea batatas (sweet potato) and Zea mays (maize) were probably in their diet.

40|$|The Titan <b>arum</b> (<b>Araceae)</b> {{produces}} the largest bloom of all flowering plants. Its flowering period of two days {{is divided into}} a female flowering phase in the first night and a male flowering phase in the second night. Recently, we have documented thermogenesis in the spadix of the Titan arum during the female flowering phase. Here, we document a second thermogenic phase in which the male florets are heated during the male flowering phase. Obviously the two nocturnal thermogenic phases are linked with the two flowering periods. These observations now allow a more detailed understanding of the flowering behavior of the Titan arum...|$|R
40|$|We {{illustrate}} {{and discuss}} fossil pollen evidence for two mostly tropical extant plant {{families in the}} Tamar Valley, north of Launceston, northern Tasmania, and the Macquarie Harbour Graben {{on the west coast}} of Tasmania. These are palms (Arecaceae) producing disulcate pollen (Dicolpopollis spp.) and an incompletely zonisulcate pollen (Proxapertites cf. operculatus) identified as a fossil <b>arum</b> (<b>Araceae).</b> Both fossil pollen types add to the growing body of evidence that warm to hot conditions allowed tropical monocots belonging to these two families to grow at high palaeolatitudes (c. 65 °S) during the Late Paleocene and/or Early Eocene in Tasmania and even closer to the pole (c. 70 °S) during the Late Cretaceous in central and southern mainland Australia...|$|R
40|$|The heat- and odour-producing genus <b>Arum</b> (<b>Araceae)</b> has {{interested}} scientists for centuries. This {{long-term interest}} has allowed a deep knowledge of some complex processes, {{such as the}} physiology and dynamics of its characteristic lure-and-trap pollination system, to be built up. However, mainly because of its large distributional range and high degree of morphological variation, species' limits and relationships are still under discussion. Today, the genus comprises 28 species subdivided into two subgenera, two sections and six subsections. In this study, the phylogeny of the genus is inferred {{on the basis of}} four plastid regions, and the evolution of several morphological characters is investigated. Our phylogenetic hypothesis is not in agreement with the current infrageneric classification of the genus and challenges the monophyly of several species. This demonstrates the need for a new infrageneric classification based on characters reflecting the evolution of this enigmatic genus. To investigate the biogeography of Arum deeply, further spatiotemporal analyses were performed, addressing the importance of the Mediterranean basin in the diversification of Arum. Our results suggest that its centre of origin was the European–Aegean region, and that major diversification happened during the last 10 Myr...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe {{pollination}} of {{the genus}} <b>Arum</b> (<b>Araceae)</b> is mainly achieved by deception, the floral odour mimicking the pollinator ovipositing site. In order to discover the sensory organs involved in this attraction, we have studied the antennae of five species of psychodine moth-flies (former Psychoda sensu lato=Psychodini), pollinators of Arum spp. The antennae of the five Psychodini reveal seven types of sensilla: multiporous tribranched sensilla basiconica (sensilla ascoidea), multiporous sensilla basiconica, multiporous sensilla coeloconica, multiporous sensilla auricillica, uniporous sensilla basiconica, aporous sensilla chaetica, aporous Böhm’s sensilla. Each species possesses three, five or six of these sensillum types. All the multiporous sensilla are probably olfactory receptors while the uniporous sensilla basiconica must possess a contact chemoreceptive function. The multiporous tribranched sensilla basiconica (s. ascoidea), present in all the species, are the best candidates for the reception of the odours given off by the ovipositing sites and the inflorescences of Arum. The multiporous sensilla basiconica and the multiporous sensilla coeloconica may be involved respectively as CO 2 receptors or thermoreceptors. Psychoda phalaenoides, which is the main pollinator of A. maculatum, is the species which possesses {{the largest number of}} antennal sensilla. The sexual dimorphism, studied only in Psycha grisescens, as concerns the number of sensilla and the absence of a sensillum type which differ according to sex, is difficult to interpret...|$|R
40|$|The size-advantage model (SAM) {{explains}} the temporal variation of energetic investment on reproductive structures (i. e. {{male and female}} gametes and reproductive organs) in long-lived hermaphroditic plants and animals. It proposes that {{an increase in the}} resources available to an organism induces a higher relative investment on the most energetically costly sexual structures. In plants, pollination interactions are known {{to play an important role}} in the evolution of floral features. Because the SAM directly concerns flower characters, pollinators are expected to have a strong influence on the application of the model. This hypothesis, however, has never been tested. Here, we investigate whether the identity and diversity of pollinators can be used as a proxy to predict the application of the SAM in exclusive zoophilous plants. We present a new approach to unravel the dynamics of the model and test it on several widespread <b>Arum</b> (<b>Araceae)</b> species. By identifying the species composition, abundance and spatial variation of arthropods trapped in inflorescences, we show that some species (i. e. A. cylindraceum and A. italicum) display a generalist reproductive strategy, relying on the exploitation of a low number of dipterans, in contrast to the pattern seen in the specialist A. maculatum (pollinated specifically by two fly species only). Based on the model presented here, the application of the SAM is predicted for the first two and not expected in the latter species, those predictions being further confirmed by allometric measures. We here demonstrate that while an increase in the female zone occurs in larger inflorescences of generalist species, this does not happen in species demonstrating specific pollinators. This is the first time that this theory is both proposed and empirically tested in zoophilous plants. Its overall biological importance is discussed through its application in other non-Arum systems...|$|R
