5|$|Croatia is {{traditionally}} divided into numerous, often overlapping geographic regions, whose borders {{are not always}} clearly defined. The largest and most readily recognizable ones throughout the country are Central Croatia (also described as the Zagreb macro-region), Eastern Croatia (largely corresponding with Slavonia), and Mountainous Croatia (Lika and Gorski Kotar; {{to the west of}} Central Croatia). These three comprise the inland or continental part of Croatia. Coastal Croatia consists of a further two regions: Dalmatia or the southern littoral, between the general area of the city of Zadar and the southernmost tip of the country; and the northern littoral located north of Dalmatia, encompassing the Croatian Littoral and Istria. The geographical regions generally do not conform to county boundaries or other administrative divisions, <b>and</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> encompass further, more specific, geographic regions.|$|E

5|$|Gens and the Judenrat in {{the larger}} ghetto {{were aware of the}} executions in Ponary by the end of September 1941, when {{survivors}} began returning to the ghetto. The survivors, some of them wounded <b>and</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> female, were mostly brought to Gens, and perhaps to the Judenrat, to whom they relayed their stories. Gens urged them to keep quiet, and some of the wounded were kept in the hospital to prevent them from repeating their stories. Knowledge of the massacres at Ponary became common in the ghetto by late December 1941 or early January 1942.|$|E
5|$|In November 1907 {{six more}} {{families}} consisting of 27 individuals from Mingulay squatted on Sandray, {{which has a}} sheltered beach. Meanwhile, {{the plight of the}} Vatersay raiders had been raised at Westminster. Despite considerable public sympathy they were eventually sentenced to two months in prison. Shortly thereafter the Congested Districts Board purchased the entire island of Vatersay with the aim of providing new crofts. By the next summer there were 14 Mingulay families living there. Only six families remained on Mingulay itself, <b>and</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> planned to leave.|$|E
5|$|In Serbia, Zaharije {{was persuaded}} by the Byzantines to revolt against Simeon. Zaharije was {{supported}} by many Bulgarians exhausted from Simeon's endless campaigns against Byzantium. The Bulgarian emperor sent his troops under Sigrica and Marmais, but they were routed and the two commanders beheaded, which forced Simeon to conclude an armistice with Byzantium in order {{to concentrate on the}} suppression of the uprising. Simeon sent an army led by Časlav Klonimirović in 924 to depose Zaharije. He was successful, as Zaharije fled to Croatia. After this victory, the Serbian nobility was invited to come to Bulgaria and bow to the new Prince. However, he did not appear at the supposed meeting <b>and</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> were beheaded. Bulgaria annexed Serbia directly.|$|E

5|$|Marasmius sasicola is {{a species}} of Marasmiaceae fungus known from Kanagawa Prefecture, Japan. First {{collected}} in 2000, it was described in 2002 by Haruki Takahashi. The species produces small mushrooms with white caps and very short, very thin black stems. Unlike in other, similar species, the stems enter the plant matter on which the mushroom grows. The six to eight white gills are spread out around the cap, <b>and</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> reach the stem. The flesh has no taste or odour. Found in June, the species grows on dead Sasa leaves, from which it takes its specific epithet.|$|E
5|$|Parts of the Sangam age Tamil {{country were}} ruled over by several {{independent}} chieftains, alongside the three crowned monarchs. Among them, coins {{belonging to the}} chieftains of the Malayaman clan {{have been found in}} Tamil Nadu. Many of them contain a written legend on the obverse <b>and</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> have the image of a flowing river on their obverse. Based on the legends some of these coins have been assigned to specific rulers such as Tirukkannan, also known as Malaiyan Choliya Enadi Tirukkannan, and Tirumudi Kari. A series of coins without a legend but with a horse as the principal motif on the obverse have been assigned to the Malayaman chieftains, because of the river symbol on the obverse. Numismatist R. Krishnamurthy, dates these coins to the period between 100 BCE and 100 CE.|$|E

McCain was showing a resurgence, in particular with renewed strength in New Hampshire– the scene of his 2000 triumph– and was bolstered further by the endorsements of The Boston Globe, the New Hampshire Union Leader, and almost two dozen other state newspapers, as well as from Senator Lieberman (now an Independent Democrat). McCain decided not to campaign significantly in the January 3, 2008, Iowa caucuses, which saw a win by former Governor of Arkansas Mike Huckabee.|$|E

5|$|The {{number of}} Chola coins {{discovered}} {{so far are}} not as many as those of Pandyas; {{most of them have}} been found from archeological excavations at Puhar and Arikamedu, and also beds of rivers Amaravathi near Karur and South Pennar near Tirukkoilur. An early Chola coin has also been found in Thailand. The Chola coins do not contain a portrait or a legend <b>and</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> depict symbols of animals and other inanimate objects like the animal series of the Cheras. But, all of them carry the symbol of a tiger, the Chola emblem, on their reverse. One of the coins has been assigned a date earlier than 200 BCE and some others to about the time of Roman influence, which is around the dawn of the Christian era.|$|E
5|$|Well {{before the}} design was finalised, four ships were ordered in July 1943. Africa was {{originally}} ordered as an unnamed Audacious-class carrier, but {{the order was}} modified to a Malta-class ship on 12 July 1943. Malta, New Zealand and Gibraltar were all ordered three days later. New Zealand was originally ordered from Cammell Laird, but the contract was transferred to Harland and Wolff on 22 July 1944. The Admiralty ordered Vickers not to order any more material on 27 April 1944 and given that final drawings were never issued to the builders, {{it is unlikely that}} any of them actually did more than preliminary work. None of the ships were ever laid down <b>and</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> were cancelled before the end of 1945.|$|E
5|$|Phellinus ellipsoideus {{differs from}} species of Fomitiporia in two key respects. Its spores are less dextrinoid {{than those of}} the genus and their shape is atypical. Other than this, it is typical of the genus, {{according}} to the original description. Five species of Fomitiporia, F.bannaensis, F.pseudopunctata, F.sonorae, F.sublaevigata and F.tenuis, share with P.ellipsoideus the resupinate fruit bodies and the setae in the hymenium. Despite this, all of them but P.ellipsoideus have straight hymenial setae, <b>and</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> have spores that are spherical or almost spherical, which is much more typical of the genus. F.uncinata (formerly Phellinus uncinatus) has hooked hymenial setae, and the spores are, as with P.ellipsoideus, thick-walled and dextrinoid. The species can be differentiated by the fact the spores are spherical or nearly so, and somewhat larger than those of P.ellipsoideus, measuring 5.5 to 7 by 5 to 6.5μm. The species is also known only from tropical America, where it grows on bamboo.|$|E
