In 1984, he {{developed}} the Seasonal Pattern Assessment Questionnaire, a widely-used screening tool for seasonality. As a result of his research and publications, [...] "it is now widely acknowledged that winter depression has a sound medical basis, involving changes in the body's mood centers" [...] associated with exposure to light. Rosenthal later identified a form of reverse SAD which some experience in the summer season.|$|E
500|$|In the {{interest}} of shortening the adaptation, approximately one-third of the story was eventually edited out; entire subplots and characters were removed. Before becoming a screenwriter Hetreed worked as an editor, and credits this experience for knowing [...] "... about structure and {{what you need to}} say <b>and</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> leave out. I am a big enthusiast for leaving things out." [...] She focused the story on the relationship between Griet and Vermeer, deciding what other storylines were [...] "... distracting and had to be jettisoned. Before editing, there was great stuff there, but Peter was fantastically ruthless." [...] Changes from the novel did not bother Chevalier, who felt that as a result the film gained [...] "... a focused, driven plot and a sumptuous visual feast." ...|$|E
2500|$|In a 2013 {{interview}} with Martha Raddatz of ABC News, Greenwald said {{that members of}} Congress are being [...] "blocked" [...] from getting [...] "the most basic information about what NSA is doing... and what the FISA court has been doing....", and specifically referenced Rep. Dutch Ruppersberger (D-MD), a ranking member of the United States House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence ("House Intelligence Committee"). Ruppersberger, who was a guest on the show, responded, [...] "We have rules {{as far as the}} committee <b>and</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> have and what you cannot have. However, based on that, that statement I just made, is that since this incident occurred with Snowden, we've had three different hearings for members of our Democratic Caucus, and the Republican Caucus.... And we will continue to do that because what we're trying to do now is to get the American public to know more about what's going on." [...] Rep. King, who was also a guest on This Week as a ranking member of the House Intelligence Committee, stated: [...] "o me it's unprecedented to have all of these top people from an administration during this time of crisis still come in and answer question after question after question. So anyone who says that Congress is somehow being stonewalled is just wrong and [...] is generally, I think, raised by {{people who are trying to}} make a name for themselves." ...|$|E

60|$|It was a tedious Journey {{to go into}} Scotland by Land, {{otherwise}} I {{was very}} much disposed to see my own Country once more, and apprehending besides, {{there might be some}} Danger upon account of being engaged in the French Service during this late War. I laid these Thoughts aside, and contented my self with making a small Tour Twenty or Thirty Miles distance from London, in which Progrination I saw Windsor, Greenwich, Hampton-Court, and some other Places of Note. But in one of these Jaunts, I had like to have paid very dear for my Curiosity. The Neighbourhood of London is much infested with Highwaymen, and if a Gentleman rides not with Pistols, 'tis very probable he will be attack'd. Unacquainted with these Customs, the Day I went to Windsor, I had in Company with me an Irish Gentleman; we made use of nothing but common Hacks, nor had any other Arms but our Swords; about the middle of Honslow Heath we met two Gentlemen well mounted, who pass'd by us unsuspected, but turning suddenly upon us again, with each of 'em a small Pistol cock'd, they very civilly demanded our Money. Gentlemen, said I, I am a Stranger; no Gentlemen said they, come quickly deliver what you have, we are in a publick Road, and can't stand arguing; but finding us a little Dilatory, they whip'd the Bridles from our Horfes, cut our Garths, and so dismounted us; and so I and my Companion were very dexterously strip'd of what they found in our Pockets, which was all I had about me, but my Friend reserv'd two or three Guineas in his Fob. When they had finish'd their Business, they gallop'd different ways cross the Heath, and left us like a couple of Asses, to drive our Horses to the next Town, and carry the Saddles under our Arms; but by the Invention of our Garters, and some other such like Tackle, we halter'd our Steeds till we cou'd refit our selves better. What we lost was but a Trifle, and 'twas done in so small a space of Time, that appear'd like a Dream or passing Thought. It was happy either for us or them, that this happen'd in the Morning when our Heads were cool, for had they attack'd us when warm'd up with good Liquor, I believe I should have had little regard to those Pop-guns they threatened us with. When we came to the next Town, and gave the People an account of our Disaster; the Landlord of the Inn ask'd us, if we had ever been upon that Road before, and we inform'd him this was the first time, then said I have Authority to enroll you as Freemen upon the small Fee of each a Bottle of Wine, and this I take to be no Imposition, because I am plac'd here in a convenient Part of the Country to advance a small sum to such as are robb'd of all they have, and cannot pursue their Journey; so Gentlemen, if that be your Condition, I have a couple of Guineas ready for you, which I will lend upon Honour, but in Case it be not a clean Robbery, what you have conceal'd from the Diligent Highwaymen is the Landlord's Fee as far as each a Bottle of Wine. This Merry Landlord I thought was very conveniently posted to divert People after their Misfortunes, we never went about to examine him, whether his Demand was customary, or only a Piece of shire Wit, and an extemporary Instance of his prolifick Genius, but sat down, and made our selves most immoderately drunk. The Landlord discanted very copiously upon the ancient and modern Practise of Robbing upon the Road, and seem'd very much inclin'd to lessen the Crime. Formerly, said he, no Body robb'd upon the Road but base scoundrel Fellows; but now 'tis become a Gentleman-like Employment, and young Brothers of very good Families are not asham'd to spend their time that way; besides the Practise is very much refin'd as to the manner, there's no Fighting or Hectoring during the Performance, but these Gentlemen approach you decently and submissive, with their Hat in their Hand to know your Pleasure, <b>and</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> well afford to support them in that Dignity they live in: 'Tis true, says he, they often for Form sake have a Pistol in their Hand, which is part of their riding Furniture; but that is only in the Nature of a Petition, to let you know they are Orphans of Providence just fallen under your Protection. In a Word, demanding Money upon the Road, is now so agreeably perform'd, that 'tis much the same with asking an Alms. The poor Beggar wou'd rob you if he durst, and the Gentleman Beggar will not rob you if you will but give a decent Alms suitable to his Quality. I thought my time so well spent to hear this Landlord plead in favour of Padding, that I told my Companion I had often known the time that I wou'd have willingly have parted with more Money than I was strip'd of upon the Heath, to have some Melancholly Thoughts driven away by such a merry Companion.|$|E
