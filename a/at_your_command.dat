6000|$|... 'I {{have already}} ventured to observe to the lordly Keferinis,' said Fakredeen, 'that every lance in the Lebanon is <b>at</b> <b>your</b> <b>command,</b> gracious Queen.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I shall {{certainly}} be <b>at</b> <b>your</b> <b>command</b> whenever you please; {{the gentleman who}} took your office upon himself is your page there, Callum Beg.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Very good, Mrs. Lydgate, very good. I am <b>at</b> <b>your</b> <b>commands,</b> {{whenever}} you require any service of me," [...] said Mr. Trumbull, who felt pleasure in conjecturing that some new resources had been opened. [...] "Rely on me, I beg. The affair shall go no further." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I shall {{always be}} proud to place the {{portfolio}} <b>at</b> <b>your</b> disposal. <b>Command</b> me <b>at</b> any time," [...] said the Senator, with dignity.|$|R
5000|$|... 9. If you get diseased, report <b>at</b> once to <b>your</b> <b>commanding</b> officer. Time is most important.|$|R
6000|$|... "I am reflecting, Mildred, that, {{with such}} a suite of apartments <b>at</b> <b>your</b> <b>command,</b> it is a sin and a shame not to give a ball." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Because you are {{in great}} grief, in undeserved grief, because--. Lady Mason, my {{services}} are <b>at</b> <b>your</b> <b>command.</b> I will act for you as I would for a--daughter." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You are marvellous, my friend," [...] he declared. [...] "With {{all these}} {{resources}} of science <b>at</b> <b>your</b> <b>command,</b> it seems incredible {{that you should}} be in the position you are." ...|$|E
6000|$|I {{have read}} of Aristotle only his Poetics, his Ethics, {{and his work}} upon Rhetoric, but I mean to take him {{regularly}} into both hands when I finish Plato's last page. Aristophanes I took with me into Devonshire; and after all, I do not know much more of him than {{three or four of}} his plays may stand for. Next week, my very dear friend, I shall be <b>at</b> <b>your</b> <b>commands,</b> and sit in spirit <b>at</b> <b>your</b> footstool, to hear and answer anything you may care to ask me--but oh! what have I done that you should talk to me about 'venturing,' or 'liberty,' or anything of that kind? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "A {{thousand}} thanks, my good Mortémar, {{and to you}} all, gentlemen," [...] he {{now said}} courteously but firmly, [...] "do not, I beseech you, think me churlish if I must momentarily refuse your kind hospitality. One glass of eau-de-vie {{to give me a}} modicum of strength, and I must to my business first. Gentlemen, I see by your coats that most of you serve the King in some capacity or other, {{you know as well as}} I do that the laws which govern the King's commands cannot be broken. I will not be gone long, half an hour at most; after that I am <b>at</b> <b>your</b> <b>commands,</b> and will be the most grateful as well as the most joyous of you all." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "My liege," [...] {{answered}} Richie Moniplies, [...] "the {{owner of}} these monies places them <b>at</b> <b>your</b> Majesty's <b>command,</b> free of all pledge or usage {{as long as}} it is your royal pleasure, providing your Majesty will condescend to show some favour to the noble Lord Glenvarloch, presently prisoner in your royal Tower of London." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You promised, sire," [...] she said, [...] "that {{he would}} not be harmed--you gave your royal word. You can save him. You have an army <b>at</b> <b>your</b> <b>command.</b> Do not forget that he once saved you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'My lord,' {{answered}} {{one of the}} ladies, 'when <b>at</b> <b>your</b> <b>command</b> {{the wall}} was thrown down, the man whom you heard speaking was so frightened at the noise that he caught up the pig and ran away.' ...|$|E
6000|$|Now {{take our}} harp into your hand, The joyful strings, <b>at</b> <b>your</b> <b>command,</b> [...] In doleful sounds no more shall mourn. We, with sincerity of heart, To all your tunes shall bear a part, [...] Unless {{we see the}} tables turn.|$|E
6000|$|... "What needs this violence, Sir Priest?" [...] {{said the}} Sheriff of Cumberland; [...] "I came hither <b>at</b> <b>your</b> Queen's <b>command,</b> {{to do her}} service; and I will depart at her least order, if she rejects such aid as I can offer. No marvel is it if our Queen's wisdom foresaw that such chance as this might happen amidst the turmoils of your {{unsettled}} State; and, while willing to afford fair hospitality to her Royal Sister, deemed it wise to prohibit the entrance of a broken army of her followers into the English frontier." ...|$|R
6000|$|Your {{dispatch}} {{of yesterday}} received. It {{looks to me}} evident the [...] enemy are trying to cross the Cumberland River, and are [...] scattered. Why not attack at once? By all means avoid the [...] contingency of a foot race to see which, you or Hood, can beat [...] to the Ohio. If you think necessary call on the governors of [...] States to send a force into Louisville to meet the enemy if he [...] should cross the river. You clearly never should cross except [...] in rear of the enemy. Now {{is one of the}} finest opportunities [...] ever presented of destroying one of the three armies of the [...] enemy. If destroyed he never can replace it. Use the means <b>at</b> [...] <b>your</b> <b>command,</b> and you can do this and cause a rejoicing that [...] will resound {{from one end of the}} land to the other.|$|R
2500|$|... "I {{answered}} {{him that we}} had taken their fort and killed {{all the people in}} it," [...] wrote Menéndez to the King, [...] "because they had built it there without Your Majesty's permission, and were disseminating the Lutheran religion in these, Your Majesty's provinces. And that I, as Captain-General of these provinces, was waging a war of fire and blood against all who came to settle these parts and plant in them their evil Lutheran sect; for I was come <b>at</b> <b>Your</b> Majesty's <b>command</b> to plant the Gospel in these parts to enlighten the natives in those things which the Holy Mother Church of Rome teaches and believes, for the salvation of their souls. For this reason I would not grant them a safe passage, but would sooner follow them by sea and land until I had taken their lives." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Why, then, do you, {{who have}} now so much <b>at</b> <b>your</b> <b>command,</b> pass {{more than half}} your time between the heated bricks of Wall Street, when you know how happy {{we should all be}} to see you, here, among us, again?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It is pretty," [...] said Rames, {{when she}} had finished, [...] "and reminds me of I know not what. But have you no fuller music <b>at</b> <b>your</b> <b>command?</b> If so, I would listen to it before I bid you good-night." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Believe me, Citizeness," [...] he said, {{addressing}} Candeille {{directly and}} with marked emphasis, [...] "I am entirely <b>at</b> <b>your</b> <b>command,</b> but am I not helpless, seeing {{that those who}} have so grossly insulted you are of your own irresponsible, if charming, sex?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... —“but {{one should}} be at yours, and <b>at</b> <b>your</b> dear man’s <b>command,</b> as long [...] as you should both honour us with your presence. You shall be only [...] the sister, the cousin, the niece—the what you please of my [...] incognito, and I will never address you as other than what you choose [...] to pass for. If you knew, Madam, you would not {{question}} that I am in [...] earnest on this occasion; the less question it, as that at my little [...] habitation near Hammersmith, I have common conveniences, though not [...] splendid ones, to make my offer good.” ...|$|R
50|$|As I had {{the good}} fortune a few years ago to be heard by <b>Your</b> Royal Highness, <b>at</b> <b>Your</b> Highness's <b>commands,</b> and as I noticed then that Your Highness took some {{pleasure}} in the little talents which Heaven has given me for Music, and as in taking Leave of Your Royal Highness, Your Highness designed to honour me with the <b>command</b> to send <b>Your</b> Highness some pieces of my Composition: I have in accordance with Your Highness's most gracious orders taken the liberty of rendering my most humble duty to Your Royal Highness with the present Concertos, which I have adapted to several instruments; begging Your Highness most humbly not to judge their imperfection with the rigor of that discriminating and sensitive taste, which everyone knows Him to have for musical works, but rather to take into benign Consideration the profound respect and the most humble obedience which I thus attempt to show Him.|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{would drop}} unheeded," [...] said Albany. [...] "Let me entreat your Grace to recollect, that you only {{give up a}} royal {{privilege}} which, exercised, would win you no respect, since it would receive no obedience. Were your Majesty to throw down your warder when the war is high, and these men's blood is hot, it would meet no more regard than if a sparrow should drop among a herd of battling wolves the straw which he was carrying to his nest. Nothing will separate them but the exhaustion of slaughter; and better they sustain it {{at the hands of}} each other than from the swords of such troops as might attempt to separate them <b>at</b> <b>your</b> Majesty's <b>commands.</b> An attempt to keep the peace by violence would be construed into an ambush laid for them; both parties would unite to resist it, the slaughter would be the same, and the hoped for results of future peace would be utterly disappointed." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Señor," [...] he said, [...] "since I {{understand}} you {{were determined to}} see me, it is an honor to welcome you, and my house and self are <b>at</b> <b>your</b> <b>command.</b> I imagine, however, that neither of us often wastes much time on compliments." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "My {{advice to}} you," [...] his mentor continued, [...] "would be to enjoy yourself, get value for your money, but--don't give up work altogether. With the capital <b>at</b> <b>your</b> <b>command,</b> you could secure an {{interest}} {{in one of the}} leading firms in the trade." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes. It {{was rather}} sudden--your message coming unexpectedly. Strictly, I {{might have been}} made to finish out the week. But I pleaded urgency and I was let off. I would have deserted any day <b>at</b> <b>your</b> <b>command,</b> dear Sue. I have deserted more than that for you!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And your lordship will excuse my saying, that {{to put the}} cottages {{into the}} state in which your lordship, with your known wish for {{progress}} of all kinds, would wish to see them is a responsibility which I dare not take on myself, as it would involve a present outlay of not less than £450. This sum would be certainly repaid to your Lordship and your tenants, {{in the course of}} the next three years, by the saving in poor-rates; an opinion for which I subjoin my grounds drawn from the books of the medical officer, Mr. Heale: but the responsibility and possible unpopularity, which employing so great a sum would involve, is more than I can, in the present dependent condition of poor-law medical officers, dare to undertake, in justice to Mr. Heale my employer, save <b>at</b> <b>your</b> special <b>command.</b> I am bound, however, to inform your lordship, that this outlay would, I think, perfectly defend the hamlets, not only from that visit of the cholera which we have every reason to expect next summer, but also from those zymotic diseases which (as your lordship will see by my returns) make up more than sixty-five per cent of the aggregate sickness of the estate." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "These were, {{as nearly}} as I can remember, the very {{words of the}} letter, which was written with the King's own hand, and show pretty clearly how hardly he was pressed. It is {{said that when he}} read it, Sir James, forgetting his grievance, was much affected, and, taking paper, wrote hastily as follows, which indeed he {{certainly}} did, for I have seen the letter in the Museum. 'My liege,--Of the past I will not speak. It is past. But since it hath graciously pleased your Majesty to ask mine aid against the rebels who would overthrow your throne, rest assured that all I have is <b>at</b> <b>your</b> Majesty's <b>command,</b> till such time as your enemies are discomfited. It hath pleased Providence to so prosper my fortunes that I have stored away in a safe place, till these times be past, a very great sum in gold, whereof I will at once place ten thousand pieces at the disposal of your Majesty, so soon as a safe means can be provided of conveying the same, seeing that I had sooner die than that these great moneys should {{fall into the hands of}} rebels to the furtherance of a wicked cause.' ...|$|R
60|$|I deeply {{regret that}} your {{commission}} had been forwarded by mail before {{the receipt of}} your letter of acceptance; so we must dispense with the formality of official notification to you by a committee. The President is highly gratified by the noble and patriotic sentiments of your letter, and directs that you proceed <b>at</b> once to <b>your</b> <b>command</b> <b>at</b> Distilleryville, Kentucky, and there report by letter to Major-General Wardorg at Louisville, for orders. It {{is important that the}} strictest secrecy be observed regarding your movements until you have passed Covington, as it is desired to hold the enemy in front of Distilleryville until you are within three days of him. Then if your approach is known it will operate as a demonstration against his right and cause him to strengthen it with his left now at Memphis, Tennessee, which it is desirable to capture first. Go by way of Bluegrass, Opossum Corners and Horsecave. All officers are expected to be in full uniform when en route to the front.|$|R
6000|$|... '--That, {{there is}} nothing in the bonds of spotless honour between myself and my fellow-man to prevent my parting with, if I choose. And that,' said Mr Merdle, now deeply intent upon a dust-cart that was passing the windows, 'shall be <b>at</b> <b>your</b> <b>command</b> {{whenever}} you think proper.' ...|$|E
60|$|They {{are entirely}} <b>at</b> <b>your</b> <b>command</b> and theirs--but don't sell the {{copyright}} to any publisher. Keep {{it in your}} own hands, and after expenses are paid of course any profits {{should go to the}} poor. Please write during this week to me at St. George's Museum, Walkley, Sheffield.|$|E
6000|$|... "Did we {{not come}} from Leyden to be <b>at</b> <b>your</b> <b>command,</b> cousin?" [...] said Foy smiling. Then he added, [...] "But why do you not {{accompany}} us on this adventure? You are in danger here, {{and even if we}} get clear with the treasure, what use is money without life?" ...|$|E
60|$|SIR:--It is made my {{agreeable}} duty {{to enclose}} herewith the joint resolution approved 24th January, 1865, tendering the thanks of Congress to yourself, {{the officers and}} men under <b>your</b> <b>command</b> for their gallantry and good conduct in the capture of Fort Fisher, and through you to all who participated in that brilliant and decisive victory under <b>your</b> <b>command.</b>|$|R
