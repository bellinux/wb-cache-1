In 1972, Don died suddenly {{of a heart attack}} when Penny was 13years old. Following Don's death, Sue began battling depression, requiring Penny to at times care for her mother and her younger brothers. At age 16, Penny wrote a letter to her grandfather, and head of the family business empire, A.N. Pritzker, in which she asked why he talked business with the men in the family and not with her. Finally realizing Penny's interest in business, A.N. provided her with a summer course in accounting.|$|E
5|$|While the Eighth Army was advancing, the PVA 13th Army {{was hiding}} in the {{mountains}} with the 50th and 66th Corps to the west, the 39th and the 40th Corps {{in the center and}} the 38th and 42nd Corps to the east. Anticipating the UN advances, the Chinese planned a series of counterattacks to catch the Eighth Army off guard. Hoping to repeat the success of the earlier First Phase Campaign, the 38th and 42nd Corps would first attack the ROK II Corps and to destroy the UN right flank, then cut behind the UN lines. At the same time, the 39th and 40th Corps would hold the US IX Corps in place while preventing any reinforcements to the ROK II Corps. The 50th and 66th Corps would stay behind <b>and</b> <b>check</b> <b>the</b> advances of the US I Corps.|$|E

Members of the IC must minimally possess professional qualifications or accounting/auditing work experience, and cannot be related to members of the ownership or executive bodies. This ensures impartiality and prevents conflict of interests. However, in SCs, while members of the IC cannot hold any managerial positions in the company, they are allowed to own company shares or be a general employee of the Company.|$|E
25|$|Little {{mention is}} made of the Ammonites through the Persian and early Hellenistic periods. Their name appears, however, {{during the time of}} the Maccabees.

The Hasmonean dynast Hyrcanus founded Qasr Al Abd, and was a descendant of the Seleucid Tobiad dynasty of Tobiah, who is mentioned by Nehemiah as an Ammonite (ii. 19) from the east-Jordanian district.|$|E

If the attacker tries to get his king to his sixth rank by moving his rook to that rank first to block the checks, the defender simply exchanges rooks and has a drawn king and pawn versus king endgame.|$|E

25|$|The damage George Holloway {{was doing}} to the Head and the {{coastline}} became apparent and local opposition grew. There was also some dispute {{as to whether he}} had violated the terms of his lease. Even so, {{by the time he was}} stopped in 1867, a third of the Head had been removed or lost through increased erosion and his mine had almost cut through to the sea beyond. Removal of the ironstone doggers on the sea side of the Head caused the Spit at the Harbour entrance to grow in length, extending to Steamer point by 1890. A long groyne had to be constructed to take the place of the missing doggers <b>and</b> <b>check</b> <b>the</b> erosion. In 1930, after Christchurch Council had refused to meet the asking price, Hengistbury Head (then in private ownership) was sold to Bournemouth for Â£25,000.|$|E

25|$|An {{alternative}} {{which is}} growing in practice {{is the use of}} a hollow piercing needle, as is done in body piercing. The piercer disinfects the earlobe with alcohol and puts a mark on the lobe with a pen. It gives the opportunity to the client to check whether the position is correct or not. Then, the piercer uses a clamp with flat ends and holes at the end to hold the earlobe, with the dot {{in the middle of the}} holes. This device will support the skin during the piercing process. A cork can be placed behind the earlobe to stop the movement of the needle after the piercing process, and protect the tip of the needle for the client's comfort. Then, the piercer places the hollow needle perpendicular to the skin's surface <b>and</b> <b>check</b> <b>the</b> position of the needle, to pierce at the desired place and the right angle. The piercing process consists of pushing the needle through the earlobe, until it gets out in the other side. The client has to remain still during all the process. Then, the clamp can be put off. After that, the piercer puts the jewel in the hollow needle and pushes the needle through until the jewel enters into the lobe. Then, the needle is removed and disposed properly. The jewel is attached to the lobe and the piercer disinfects the lobe again.|$|E
25|$|Rana Prasad Rao of Amarkot duly welcomed Humayun {{into his}} home and {{sheltered}} the refugees for several months. Here, in the household of a Hindu Rajput nobleman, Humayun's wife Hamida Bano, daughter of a Sindhi Shia family, {{gave birth to the}} future Emperor Akbar on 15 October 1542. The date of birth is well established because Humayun consulted his astronomer to utilise the astrolabe <b>and</b> <b>check</b> <b>the</b> location of the planets. The infant was the long-awaited heir-apparent to the 34-year-old Humayun and the answer of many prayers. Shortly after the birth, Humayun and his party left Amarkot for Sindh, leaving Hamida and her child in the custody of their Hindu hosts. A couple of years later, at Humayun's behest, Hamida would leave her infant son in the safety of remote Amarkot and join her husband as he fled into Persia, where her Shia and Persian background would bring influence. The infant Akbar was to live for more than five years, all alone, in the care of a Hindu, Rajput foster-family. This was to have a profound, indelible influence on his views and personality, and a momentous effect on the subsequent history of India. In particular, Akbar developed a strong affinity for the Rajputs, going {{out of his way to}} forge alliances (including marriage alliances) with them, and they would form the bedrock of support for his dynasty for two centuries.|$|E
500|$|Before use {{the user}} should verify the {{contents}} of the cylinder <b>and</b> <b>check</b> <b>the</b> function of the cylinder valve. This is usually done with a regulator connected to control the flow. Pressure and gas mixture are critical information for the diver, and the valve should open freely without sticking or leaking from the spindle seals. Failure to recognize that the cylinder valve was not opened or that a cylinder was empty has been observed in divers conducting a pre-dive check. Breathing gas bled from a cylinder may be checked for smell. If the gas does not smell right it should not be used. Breathing gas should be almost free of smell, though a very slight aroma of the compressor lubricant is fairly common. No smell of combustion products or volatile hydrocarbons should be discernible.|$|E

500|$|The Alliance Fleet soon resumes {{its efforts}} to track down Bosch, and {{discover}} that Bosch had built a device that enables him {{to communicate with the}} Shivans, which was the purpose of ETAK; the Alliance realise the jump gate was activated by Bosch, who had been stealing artefacts from archaeological sites looking into the Ancients, and had been hoping to meet and contact the Shivans. [...] The Shivans respond to his transmission, and in turn board his command frigate, the Iceni, and capture him and fifteen other crewmen before attempting to destroy it. The GTVA manage to save the surviving crew of the Iceni and the ETAK device, but as they try to intercept the Shivan transport carrying Bosch, they discover a second jump gate in the nebula, which the Alliance destroyer, the GVD Psamtik, attempts to secure. However, it is destroyed by another Sathanas juggernaut shortly afterwards, forcing the GTVA to pull out. [...] During this time, the GTVI and SOC launch a secret operation within the nebula, at great risk, to recover an operative <b>and</b> <b>check</b> <b>the</b> other side of the gate, discovering the threat posed to the GTVA by the Shivans is much greater than they had thought.|$|E
