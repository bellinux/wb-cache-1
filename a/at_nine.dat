5|$|In 1990, the eight-team Atlantic Coast Conference added Florida State to the league, {{creating}} a new nine-team ACC. Though Florida State was the only school added to the conference, some league officials discussed offering one or more other schools—Navy, Pittsburgh, Syracuse, South Carolina, Miami, West Virginia, Boston College, Rutgers, or Virginia Tech—an offer to join the league. For various reasons, however, no other team was extended an offer. Throughout the 1990s, the Atlantic Coast Conference remained <b>at</b> <b>nine</b> members. Ironically, South Carolina was a charter member of the ACC that left in 1971.|$|E

5|$|By 1654 a small open-air fruit-and-vegetable {{market had}} {{developed}} {{on the south}} side of the fashionable square. Gradually, both the market and the surrounding area fell into disrepute, as taverns, theatres, coffee-houses and brothels opened up. By the 18th century it had become a well-known red-light district. An Act of Parliament was drawn up to control the area, and Charles Fowler's neo-classical building was erected in 1830 to cover and help organise the market. The market grew and further buildings were added: the Floral Hall, Charter Market, and in 1904 the Jubilee Market. By the end of the 1960s traffic congestion was causing problems, and in 1974 the market relocated to the New Covent Garden Market about three miles (5km) south-west <b>at</b> <b>Nine</b> Elms. The central building re-opened as a shopping centre in 1980 and is now a tourist location containing cafes, pubs, small shops, and a craft market called the Apple Market, along with another market held in the Jubilee Hall.|$|E

5|$|By {{the end of}} the 1960s, traffic {{congestion}} was causing problems for the market, which required increasingly large lorries for deliveries and distribution. Redevelopment was considered, but protests from the Covent Garden Community Association in 1973 prompted the Home Secretary, Robert Carr, to give dozens of buildings around the square listed-building status, preventing redevelopment. The following year the market relocated to its new site, New Covent Garden Market, about three miles (5km) south-west <b>at</b> <b>Nine</b> Elms. The central building re-opened as a shopping centre in 1980, with cafes, pubs, small shops and a craft market called the Apple Market. Among the first shops to relocate here was Benjamin Pollock's Toy Shop. Another market, the Jubilee Market, is held in the Jubilee Hall {{on the south side of}} the square. The market halls and several other buildings in Covent Garden have been owned by the property company Capital & Counties Properties (CapCo) since 2006.|$|E

5|$|Emmerson was {{released}} by the club after failing to make any first-team appearances, while Ferrell joined Gateshead for a £3,500 fee and Jamie Clarke signed having been released by Grimsby Town. Purkiss gave York the lead away to Histon before Bradley Hudson-Odoi scored to equalise as the match finished a 1–1 draw, which ended a club record run of league victories <b>at</b> <b>nine.</b> A 1–0 away win over Kettering came after Rankine scored the only goal with a volley from inside the penalty area. Goalkeeper Simon Miotto joined the club as goalkeeping coach, and later registered as a player.

The trains were initially called the Jubilees, as it was Queen Victoria's Golden Jubilee, but became known as the Subbies. Suburban services were also introduced between Aberdeen and Culter on the Deeside Line in 1894, after the track had been doubled, starting with ten down and nine up trains calling at seven stops in twenty-two minutes. The number of trains was eventually doubled and an additional station provided.|$|E
