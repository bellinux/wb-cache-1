2500|$|The album {{had mixed}} reviews from critics but charted {{higher in the}} US {{than any of his}} albums since Wavelength. It went gold in both the US [...] and UK. [...] Allmusic rated it four stars with {{reviewer}} James Crispell [...] noting: [...] "After so many songs ranging through so many styles, it is <b>a</b> <b>pleasure</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> Van Morrison return to the music that suits him so well. Steeped in blues and R, Back on Top finds Morrison celebrating life and its pleasures to the limit." [...] It was rated 3 stars by Rolling Stone with James Hunter ending his review commenting: [...] "Back on Top is solid, brilliant, silly in sad ways. But it's still one Monet and nine Norman Rockwells." [...] Irish critic George Byrne wrote a negative review in the Irish Independent: [...] "Somewhere in the mid-Eighties the poet/philosopher accolades seem to have seeped into his skull and he began churning out same-sounding albums on an almost annual basis." [...] An opposing viewpoint was expressed by George Graham who commented in his review that [...] "It's one of his best, most tasteful albums in recent years, and Van Morrison has had some very good albums in this period." ...|$|E

6000|$|When they {{returned}} through the Den, there still seemed (to the unpiercing eye) to be {{but two of}} them; nevertheless, Stroke re-entered the Lair to announce to Agnes and the others that he had left Gavinia below in charge of Sir Joseph.

Then he wiped away a tear with the cuff of his coat, touched his hat in the orthodox fashion and departed. Their outfit, I should add, was very simple: some food in bags, a flask of spirits, two double-barrelled guns that would shoot either shot or ball, a bull's-eye lantern, matches and their pistols.|$|E

For the last three days we couldn't get them to look us in the face. Presently I began to talk to the boss quietly, just as I am talking to you now, careless like, and I told him all I had observed.
