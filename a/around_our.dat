500|$|Director Dan Zeff said of {{the tone}} the {{production}} team wished to capture, [...] "Working with an inspirational design team, we wanted to emphasise a melancholy feel, an emptiness in the world <b>around</b> <b>our</b> characters– big urban spaces that once may have been full of life, but now lay abandoned, rusting, decayed. Amidst this, Elton and his fragile group of friends would almost feel cast adrift– increasingly vulnerable as they are led astray by the sinister Victor Kennedy." [...] The episode features the songs [...] "Mr. Blue Sky", [...] "Don't Bring Me Down", and [...] "Turn to Stone" [...] by Electric Light Orchestra (ELO), Elton's favorite band.|$|E
500|$|In early 1962, Chotiner {{managed the}} {{unsuccessful}} primary campaign of conservative California Senate candidate Loyd Wright, who was easily defeated by incumbent Senator Thomas H. Kuchel in the Republican primary. In August 1962, he joined Nixon's campaign for Governor of California against incumbent Democratic Governor Pat Brown as an unpaid volunteer. Chotiner and Nixon {{had a major}} disagreement, with the consultant opposing the candidate's decision to denounce the conservative John Birch Society. In its final weeks, the Brown-Nixon battle became an [...] "alley fight", with legal battles over [...] "smear" [...] pamphlets distributed by each side. Chotiner's involvement and the alleged use of his techniques were issues in the campaign, with one bitter Republican describing him as [...] "a millstone <b>around</b> <b>our</b> neck". Brown defeated Nixon by five percentage points.|$|E

Christopher Misiano directed the installment. According to Fringe co-creator Roberto Orci, series writers often approached episodes' fringe cases by coming up with an idea and then asking science consultants to [...] "justify it scientifically." [...] For [...] "Power Hungry", Cho and others brainstormed the concept of a computer virus being able to spread to humans. She explained, [...] "And through kneading that idea over and over again, we {{came up with the idea}} of a character, Joseph, who would start waking up to this power of his to be able to actually control electronic- or computer-driven devices." [...] New Media consultant and scientist Glen Whitman, who later co-wrote some Fringe episodes, noted that the science depicted in the episode was not totally impossible. [...] "It is true that human beings as a result of the electrical activity in our brains, we do all have a very very weak magnetic field <b>around</b> <b>our</b> heads," [...] he said. [...] "And that's in part what is sensed by an EEG. So the notion was, 'how can you amplify that'"? ...|$|E

500|$|Disasterpieces was {{recorded}} at the now defunct London Dockland Arena in England on February 16, 2002, {{it was one}} of the final dates on the band's European tour which was subsequently their final tour until 2004. The concert was shot with 26 different cameras under the direction of Matthew Amos and documents the show, backstage action and an in-store signing in Paris, France. In addition to operated cameras each band member had an individual camera which was attached to the side of their masks, apart from Mick Thomson whose camera was attached to the headstock of his guitar. The concept behind these cameras was to allow the viewer to see the show from the band member's point of view. However they did cause some discomfort and problems for some band members. Bassist Paul Gray removed his after four songs, explaining that [...] "they gave us this big [...] pack to wear <b>around</b> <b>our</b> waist. So when I was jumping around, the thing started sliding down my leg". Also during the song [...] "Spit It Out" [...] DJ Sid Wilson had his camera stolen when he was in the crowd, however it was returned at the end of the show, all of this is documented on the DVD.|$|E
500|$|Tony! Toni! Toné! {{completed}} recording House of Music in September 1996, and {{the album}} was then mastered by Brian Gardner at Bernie Grundman Mastering in Hollywood. House of Music was named after a record store in the band's native Oakland, which had closed several {{years prior to the}} album's release. In an interview for Billboard, Wiggins said, [...] "We title all our albums {{at the end of the}} project. We sat back and listened to everything, and it reminded us of this mom-and-pop store <b>around</b> <b>our</b> way in Oakland." [...] "We grew up in a house of music," [...] Wiggins continued, remarking how their father was a blue guitarist and music had a unifying effect on people. According to Billboards Shawnee Smith, the album's title described a varied, complete work distinct from a contemporary music market oversaturated by [...] "retro-soul groups". The cover and booklet photos were taken by photographer William Claxton, who captured Tony! Toni! Toné! dressed in casual and formal, retro clothing. This departure from the more outré wardrobe of the band's past was interpreted by journalist Brandon Ousley as an effort to promote [...] "the elegance of 1960s-era Black America and legendary soul acts to a modern generation".|$|E
500|$|Following the break, the Blue Jackets were on {{the road}} playing the Los Angeles Kings, and with the score tied late in the game, Kings' defenseman Drew Doughty scored with just 0.4 seconds {{remaining}} to win the game. Upon review of the goal it, was determined that the clock at Staples Center froze at 1.8 seconds for over a full second, which would have resulted in time expiring prior to the goal being scored. Kings' General Manager Dean Lombardi stated that the clock was correct and no extra time had been added due to the way the clock self-corrects at various times. Howson stated on the team's blog that [...] "It is an amazing coincidence that with the Kings on a power play at Staples Center and with a mad scramble <b>around</b> <b>our</b> net in the dying seconds of the third period of a 2–2 hockey game that the clock stopped for at least one full second," [...] adding that, [...] "Either there was a deliberate stopping of the clock or the clock malfunctioned." [...] NHL Senior Vice President of Hockey Operations Colin Campbell stated that the Blue Jackets were wronged, but that the outcome of the game could not be changed, and that the delay was not noticed by the off-ice officials or the situation room in Toronto. To determine the true cause of the clock pause, the NHL launched an investigation, talking with the clock's manufacturer and interviewing Staples Center staff.|$|E

Alia later recalled that [...] "the aim of the Soviets was to ensure that our Party did not come out against their party and Khrushchev, did not bring the fight out in the open, and speak about Bucharest and the contradictions which existed. To this end, they created <b>around</b> <b>our</b> delegation a harsh and dangerous atmosphere, in which open threats were combined with cunning flattery." [...] Hoxha once again communicated via radiogram, writing to Kapo on October 13 that, [...] "We are not of the same opinion as those {{who are trying to}} smooth out the problems by means of phrases in resolutions or declarations... We are for carrying the matter through to the end. If this is not understood, it means that the danger which the Khrushchev group represents for the world communist movement is not understood. It does not depend on us whether this group should continue in power or not, but it is essential that we, should expose this group with Khrushchev at the head, as they deserve... we shall not allow ourselves to be impressed by those who say: 'How can one attack the glorious Soviet Union or the great Communist Party of Lenin for the faults of a few rascals?' We say: Precisely to defend the Soviet Union and the Party of Lenin, these 'rascals' must be exposed, and there must be no toning down of criticism or covering up of the deviationists." ...|$|E
