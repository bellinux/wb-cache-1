2500|$|Oil and gas E {{is carried}} out by NOC {{subsidiaries}} and IOCs licensed by special participation and PSAs. These activities cover wide areas, both onshore and offshore, through Libya’s territorial waters and continental shelf. NOC has a network of onshore oil, gas and product pipelines, crude oil export facilities and a gas pipeline. The Western Libyan Gas Project (WLGP) is a 50-50 joint venture between NOC and Eni, which came online in October 2004. Since then, WLGP has expanded to Italy and beyond. Currently, [...] per year of natural gas is exported from a processing facility at Melitah, on the Libyan coast, via Greenstream to southeastern Sicily. From Sicily, it flows to the Italian mainland, {{and then to the}} rest of Europe. In 2005, <b>additional</b> <b>gas</b> was supplied to the Greenstream pipeline from the Bahr Essalam Field, located in offshore Block NC-41. Development of the Bahr Essalam, Wafa and Bouri Fields, which are part of WLGP, and the natural gas export pipeline represented a shift in Libyan emphasis from oilfield development to a mix of natural gas and oilfield projects. Previously, natural gas exports were limited to LNG.|$|E

40|$|Blast furnace is {{the heart}} of every steel plant. Steel {{production}} is based on the blast furnace process, as it is where the iron is extracted from the iron ore and turned into liquid iron, which will subsequently be used to make liquid steel. Therefore, without hot iron, steel can not be produced. Blast furnaces in this process are supplied among others with pulverized coal. Raw coal should be prepared for the blast furnaces in the form of fine coal powder. This fine coal powder should then be injected into the blast furnaces in order to continue the production. This process is carried out by the Pulverized Coal Injection System, which changes raw coal into dry fine coal powder. The system consists of a hot gas generator, a coal mill, a bagfilter as well as various valves, fans and piping. The general idea is to burn specific gases with the help of equipments and to use them to dry the coal in the cycle. When the amount of the gases inserted into the system is changed, the dried coal amount is directly affected. Based on this background the following project is carried out, which aims at the investigation of bottlenecks and critical points in the process. The most important bottleneck is the limited possibility of fresh air usage, as the oxygen in fresh air can cause explosions if existent in exceeding amounts in the system and thus, is dangerous. In order to prevent this explosive condition in the system, <b>additional</b> <b>gases</b> need {{to be added to the}} system. The aim of this project is to introduce <b>additional</b> <b>gases</b> to the system in order to increase the upper limit of the fresh air amount. Increasing the amount of fresh air in the recirculation gas should provide more amount of dried coal,hence increasing the drying capacity of the coal grinding plant. To understand the situation better, tests about gas injection are carried out in the system. The results of the tests are analyzed and the performance changes in the system are calculated. For this, programs in Excel and also inLabVIEW are created to interpret the situations easily. As it is understood from the results of the tests, when the amount of the <b>additional</b> <b>gases</b> isincreased, approximately 10 % increase in the amount of dried coal is observed. Subsequently, Pulverized Coal Injection mill productivity isincreased. Additionally, oxygen percentage in the mill circuit will decrease and this is important for the safety conditions. To conclude, this project aims to show the usage and recycling of <b>additional</b> <b>gases</b> in “PulverizedCoal Injection” process by implying various programs and interpretations...|$|R

40|$|By {{separating}} plasma {{production and}} plasma deposition and by {{taking advantage of}} the high specific ionizing power of thermal plasmas, very high deposition rates on large areas of amorphous C-H and Si-H are obtained.

The results indicated that especially in Ar-CO 2 PMITP, decreasing lower current level in a modulation cycle raised the on-delay time which means a recovery time from low temperature state to high temperature one. In addition, the inclusion of CO 2 in Ar PMITP caused lower temperatures just before the on-operation compared with other gases used in the experiment...|$|R
