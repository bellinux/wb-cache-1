5|$|The Woman's Bible is {{a two-part}} non-fiction book, written by Elizabeth Cady Stanton and a {{committee}} of 26 women, published in 1895 and 1898 to challenge the traditional position of religious orthodoxy that woman should be subservient to man. By producing the book, Stanton wished to promote a radical liberating theology, one that stressed self-development. The book attracted {{a great deal of}} controversy <b>and</b> <b>antagonism</b> at its introduction.|$|E
5|$|Once a queen has {{excavated}} a chamber, {{she will}} lay around 20 eggs that develop into larvae {{in less than}} a month. These eggs take 44 to 61 days to fully develop and emerge as adults. Mature nests range in size, from a few hundred to over 300,000 workers. Most colonies are monogyne, meaning it only has a single queen, but some colonies can have as many as four. Oligogynous colonies also exist, in which multiple queens are present, but they are tolerated equally by workers birthed from different mothers <b>and</b> <b>antagonism</b> exists among queens. Brood discrimination is known based on recognition of kin, and queens will look after their own brood and neglect other brood laid by different queens. Queens display intolerance to each other when the first generation of workers is present, and the queens will separate from each other once the colony grows to a certain size.|$|E

25|$|The {{seeds of}} Pop's stage persona were sown {{when he saw}} The Doors perform in 1967 at the University of Michigan and was amazed by the stage antics <b>and</b> <b>antagonism</b> {{displayed}} by singer Jim Morrison. Morrison's extreme behavior, while performing in a popular band, inspired the young Pop to push the boundaries of stage performance. Other influences on Pop's vocals and persona were Mick Jagger and James Brown. Pop was the first performer to do a stage-dive, which he started at a concert in Detroit. Pop, who traditionally performs bare-chested, also performed such stage theatrics as rolling around in broken glass and exposing himself to the crowd.|$|E
25|$|Thematically, moral {{ambiguity}} is {{a prominent}} feature of Brian's work. Extreme cases of loyalty <b>and</b> <b>antagonism</b> are personified in characters such as Noelle Lange and Ivy Slade—to degrees that are sometimes questioned or denounced by the narrator. However, {{it is often}} only after the details of another character's background have been revealed that Brennan can understand what motivates them, which will occasionally leave her conflicted in her judgments. The series has companion works, set {{in the past and}} the future, which are dedicated to further exploring character. These novels include the Private prequel collection, which focuses on various figures, and the spin-off series Privilege, which follows the resourceful but disturbed Ariana Osgood.|$|E
25|$|Group selection. It has {{controversially}} {{been argued}} by some evolutionary scientists such as David Sloan Wilson that natural selection can act {{at the level}} of non-kin groups to produce adaptations that benefit a non-kin group even if these adaptions are detrimental at the individual level. Thus, while altruistic persons may under some circumstances be outcompeted by less altruistic persons at the individual level, according to group selection theory the opposite may occur at the group level where groups consisting of the more altruistic persons may outcompete groups consisting of the less altruistic persons. Such altruism may only extend to ingroup members while there may instead prejudice <b>and</b> <b>antagonism</b> against outgroup members (See also in-group favoritism). Group selection theory has been criticized by many other evolutionary scientists.|$|E

25|$|The {{working men}} have no country. We cannot take from {{them what they}} have not got. Since the proletariat must first of all acquire {{political}} supremacy, must rise to be the leading class of the nation, must constitute itself the nation, it is so far, itself national, though not in the bourgeois sense of the word. National differences <b>and</b> <b>antagonism</b> between peoples are daily more and more vanishing, owing {{to the development of}} the bourgeoisie, to freedom of commerce, to the world market, to uniformity in the mode of production and in the conditions of life corresponding thereto. The supremacy of the proletariat will cause them to vanish still faster. United action, of the leading civilised countries at least, is one of the first conditions for the emancipation of the proletariat.|$|E
25|$|The Christian {{population}} of Smyrna (mainly Greeks and Armenians), according to different sources, either formed a minority or a majority compared to Muslim Turkish {{population of}} the city. The Greek army also consisted of 2,500 Armenian volunteers. The majority of the Greek population residing in the city greeted the Greek troops as liberators. By contrast, {{the majority of the}} Muslim population saw this as an invading force and some Turks resented the Greeks {{as a result of a}} long history of conflict <b>and</b> <b>antagonism.</b> Nevertheless, the Greek landings were received by and large passively, only facing sporadic resistance, mainly by small groups of irregular Turkish troops in the suburbs. The majority of the Turkish forces in the region either surrendered peacefully to the Greek Army, or fled to the countryside.|$|E
25|$|Haloperidol is {{a typical}} {{butyrophenone}} type antipsychotic that exhibits high affinity dopamine D2 receptor antagonism and slow receptor dissociation kinetics. It has effects similar to the phenothiazines. The drug binds preferentially to D2 and α1 receptors at low dose (ED50 = 0.13 and 0.42mg/kg, respectively), and 5-HT2 receptors at a higher dose (ED50 = 2.6mg/kg). Given that antagonism of D2 receptors is more beneficial on the positive symptoms of schizophrenia <b>and</b> <b>antagonism</b> of 5-HT2 receptors on the negative symptoms, this characteristic underlies haloperidol's greater effect on delusions, hallucinations and other manifestations of psychosis. Haloperidol's negligible affinity for histamine H1 receptors and muscarinic M1 acetylcholine receptors yields an antipsychotic with a lower incidence of sedation, weight gain, and orthostatic hypotension though having higher rates of treatment emergent extrapyramidal symptoms.|$|E
40|$|This {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with the dynamics evolution of opinions in the presence of both cooperations <b>and</b> <b>antagonisms.</b> The class of Laplacian flows is addressed through signed digraphs subject to switching topologies. Further, a state transition matrix-based approach is developed for the analysis of opinion dynamics, regardless of any assumptions on connectivity, structural balance or digon sign-symmetry of signed digraphs. It is shown that based on the separation of cooperations <b>and</b> <b>antagonisms,</b> a relationship can be bridged between opinion dynamics under signed digraphs and under conventional digraphs. This helps to solve convergence problems for opinion dynamics. In particular, bipartite consensus (or stability) emerges if and only if the associated switching signed digraph is simultaneously structurally balanced (or unbalanced), which generalizes the use of structural balance theory in opinion dynamics to the case study of changing network topologies.

25|$|The {{overwhelming}} {{amount of}} Bửu Hội's contributions {{are in the}} field of chemical carcinogenesis and the synthesis of related organic chemical compounds. In the late 1940s and early 1950s, he had extensive collaborations with the quantum chemistry personnel of the Radium Institute on various aspects of the electronic theory of carcinogenesis. Bửu Hội was the first to propose the involvement of noncovalent forces. Together with Lacassagne and Rudali, in the 1940s he became the first to describe the phenomena of synergisma <b>and</b> <b>antagonism</b> between carcinogens. He demonstrated this by using hydrocarbons on the skin of mice and later extended this to hepatic and other carcinogens. Starting in 1947, he collaborated with François Zajdela and Lacassagne in exploring the relationships between the structure and carcinogenic activity of polynuclear compounds. The study spanned a groundbreaking scale and depth.|$|E
500|$|In 1836 he {{returned}} home anxious {{to embark on a}} mission of enlightenment. Abovian’s efforts were thwarted as he faced a growing and hostile reaction from the Armenian clergy as well as Tsarist officials, largely stemming from his opposition to dogmatism and formalism in the school system. Abovian was appointed as the supervisor of the Tiflis uyezd school and married a German woman named Emilia Looze (d. 1870) in 1839. In 1840 he was approached by English traveler Anne Lister, who was visiting Tiflis. She hoped that Abovian would guide her on another expedition to Mount Ararat which ultimately did not occur. He was dismissed from the school in 1843 and was transferred to the uyezd [...] school in Yerevan where he encountered apathy <b>and</b> <b>antagonism</b> from his colleagues and the clergy.|$|E
500|$|The {{public was}} {{initially}} {{skeptical of the}} typewriter, and reactions included apathy <b>and</b> <b>antagonism.</b> Outside of large companies, letters generally {{did not need to}} be composed quickly; as the device was reliant upon its operator, it offered no automation. In business settings involving customer interaction, the unfamiliar machines were viewed with suspicion (as there existed the perception that mechanical devices could be rigged by unscrupulous merchants) and the presence of such a large object between the customer and employee [...] "interrupted the 'personal touch. Individuals receiving typewritten letters often found them insulting (as type implied they could not read handwriting) or impersonal, problems exacerbated by the all upper-case writing. The typewriter also precipitated privacy concerns, as recipients of letters of a personal nature believed a third-party operator or typesetter must have been involved in their composition.|$|E

500|$|... "Homecoming" [...] {{serves as}} a heartfelt tribute to West's {{hometown}} of Chicago, Illinois. Using an extended metaphor that personifies {{the city as a}} childhood sweetheart named 'Windy' (a reference to Chicago's nickname of the 'Windy City'), West rhymes about his love for Chicago and his guilt over leaving [...] "her" [...] to pursue his musical dream. The song's opening lines lyrically paraphrase [...] "I Used to Love H.E.R.", a similarly metaphoric hip-hop song made by West's close friend and labelmate Common, who later appeared in the single's music video. West dedicated [...] "Big Brother" [...] to Jay Z, whom he feels so close to that he sees him as a brother. Within the song, West dually details his love and admiration as well as his envy <b>and</b> <b>antagonism</b> towards Jay Z, metaphorically equating their relationship to that of a sibling rivalry. West also uses the song's chorus as a subsidiary dedication to his mentor No I.D., who first taught him how to produce music. Similar to its musicality, the songwriting characteristics of the album-closing track, [...] "Good Night" [...] alludes to West's next musical progression. The majority of song is composed of repetitive recitations of its choruses and bridges by Mos Def and Al Be Back. West melodically raps only one single verse in which he nostalgically reminisces over taking trips to the museum with his grandparents. As his verse draws to a close, West chastises that a person can't dwell on the past, and charges himself with living his life like he has no tomorrow. In retrospect, with the death of his mother Donda West less than two months after the album was released in addition to the dissolution of his engagement with fiancée Alexis Phifer, the trace amounts of melancholy found scattered throughout Graduation would all but envelop West's next studio album, 808s & Heartbreak.|$|E

They were trained by Ed Richman, who had worked with the birds for fifteen years in TV shows such as Magnum, P.I. and Jake and the Fatman. Richman stated that Howarth caught on [...] "real quick" [...] regarding his interaction with Flash and Lucky and said that he was the best actor he had worked with in the industry. [...] The parrots were used for different purposes: for intimidating scenes where it looked like Moose [...] "was going to kill somebody", Richman used Flash, and Lucky was used for the [...] "loving, very caring, physically close" [...] portrayal of Moose. [...] Like other actors, the parrots were able to connect, in character, with their fellow castmembers and achieve comedic timing with them. [...] Voice actor Ron Gallop was hired to deliver Moose's lines, which were crafted to help demonstrate Todd's train of thought, signified Todd and Moose's close bond, and consisted of funny or insulting remarks aimed at anyone causing problems for Todd.|$|E
