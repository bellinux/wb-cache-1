5|$|French breeders of polled Limousins {{claimed that}} the breed {{standard}} that prevented their animals being recorded in the French Herd Book provided <b>an</b> <b>unfair</b> export advantage to foreign countries {{that do not have}} similar restrictions. The French recording ban was removed in July 2007 with the introduction of the Purebred class, but so far no polled Limousin have yet been accepted and registered as Full French.|$|E
5|$|The NLRB {{applied a}} right it had {{recently}} announced in Quality Mfg. Co. and then clarified in Mobil Oil Corp. that employees in unionized workplaces {{had a right}} under Section 7 of the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA) {{to the presence of}} a union representative during any inquiry where the employee's job might be in jeopardy. The NLRB had explained in those decisions that having a union representative present was an exercise of the right to the 'mutual aid and protection' protected by Section 7. Therefore, an employer's refusal of such presence was <b>an</b> <b>unfair</b> labor practice and actionable under the NLRA. As a result, the NLRB found that Weingarten had engaged in <b>an</b> <b>unfair</b> labor practice by refusing Collins a representative and Weingarten appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 1950s, Dunstan became {{well known for}} his {{campaign}} {{against the death penalty}} being imposed on Max Stuart, who was convicted of rape and murder of a small girl. He harried Playford aggressively over the matter, creating an uproar over what he saw as <b>an</b> <b>unfair</b> process. Playford eventually relented, and appeared shaken thereafter; the event was seen as {{a turning point in the}} LCL's decline, and Labor gained momentum. During Labor's time in opposition, Dunstan was prominent in securing some reforms in Aboriginal rights, and was at the forefront of Labor abandoning the White Australia Policy.|$|E

5|$|Industry representatives {{complained that}} the final rule overstated the {{environmental}} effects of corn ethanol, and also criticized the inclusion of ILUC as <b>an</b> <b>unfair</b> penalty to domestic corn ethanol because deforestation {{in the developing world}} was being tied to U.S. ethanol production. The 2011 limit for LCFS means that Mid-west corn ethanol failed, unless current carbon intensity was reduced. Oil industry representatives {{complained that the}} standard left oil refiners with few options, such as Brazilian sugarcane ethanol, with its accompanying tariff. CARB officials and environmentalists counter that time and economic incentives will allow produces to adapt.|$|E
5|$|It was {{announced}} on 22 March 2013 that West Ham {{had signed a}} 99-year lease for the Olympic Stadium after the government agreed to put in an extra million towards the costs of converting the site. The club's plan was {{to move into the}} stadium {{prior to the start of}} the 2016–17 season. Supporters of rival clubs had pressed for an inquiry into the granting of West Ham's tenancy, arguing that West Ham were being given <b>an</b> <b>unfair</b> advantage by the arrangement. In September 2015, however, the government rejected holding such an inquiry.|$|E
5|$|Mansfield's {{judgment}} {{has been}} criticised as being unusually short-sighted because {{he failed to}} see that while his decision was correct for that particular case, the precedent it would set would create <b>an</b> <b>unfair</b> monopoly for the booksellers and publishers. This {{was one of only}} a small number of cases in which Mansfield was overruled; in his entire career only six of his judgments were overturned by a higher court. Mansfield's judgement here has been seen as part of a wider agenda; along with other legal figures such as Sir William Blackstone, he was personally in favour of a perpetual copyright.|$|E
50|$|The National Football League defines {{two types}} of <b>unfair</b> acts, <b>a</b> palpably <b>unfair</b> act and <b>an</b> {{extraordinarily}} <b>unfair</b> act.

5|$|Bose {{commented that}} Ganguly's {{greatest}} legacy {{lay in his}} influence on the younger and budding generation of cricketers. Ganguly felt that every young player should play two years of domestic cricket before being selected for international assignments. He also said that every newcomer should be given at least five games to prove himself. Later he explained that being at {{the receiving end of}} <b>an</b> <b>unfair</b> decision against him, that threatened to ruin his international cricket career, it enabled him to understand the insecurities of other newcomers in the team better than his predecessors. Ganguly had always backed the influence and contribution of younger players of the team.|$|E
5|$|For the 2010 Ski Flying World Cup season, {{beginning}} in Oberstdorf, and from thereon used at all ski flying and ski jumping events, a supplementary points system was introduced. This system {{takes into account}} the wind speed and direction during each jump, as well as mid-round start gate adjustments, in order to enable a more fair contest. If a headwind is present, this is deemed <b>an</b> <b>unfair</b> advantage and points are therefore deducted as 'compensation'; if a tailwind is present, this is deemed to be a disadvantage and additional points are awarded instead. The amount of deduction or addition is calculated via coefficient using complex instrumentation which analyses the wind conditions at the time of a jump, and the value of the points themselves are in minimum increments of 0.1.|$|E
5|$|In 2007 Pistorius {{applied to}} run in non-disabled track meets. He was at first accepted, but {{questions}} quickly arose about whether the blades give him <b>an</b> <b>unfair</b> advantage. After initial research showed the blades did provide an advantage, the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF) changed their rules to ban the use of technical devices that provide an advantage and ruled him ineligible to compete. Pistorius challenged the ruling with additional research and was reinstated by the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) in 2008, meaning that he can continue {{to run in}} non-disabled meets {{as long as he}} uses the equipment that was studied in the research.|$|E

5|$|Mateiu Caragiale had {{his first}} {{thoughts}} on Craii de Curtea-Veche in 1910. Two years later, {{during a trip to}} Iași, he published his first 13 poems in the literary magazine Viața Românească, winning the praise of poet Panait Cerna and the ridicule of writer Tudor Arghezi. Literary critic Șerban Cioculescu stressed that these had been printed following his father's interventions with the magazine's staff, and, according to the contemporary account of Luca's brother-in-law, philosopher Ionel Gherea, Ion Luca admired his son's contributions, his criticism being minimal, constructive, and welcomed by Mateiu. This led Gherea to conclude that, copying in real life a Symbolist cliché, Caragiale-son fabricated <b>an</b> <b>unfair</b> image of his father. In later years, Mateiu continued to write poetry, published by literary promoter Constantin Banu in his magazine, Flacăra.|$|E
5|$|Neal has won {{re-election}} in every term since. Former Springfield mayor Theodore Dimauro, reflecting sentiments that Neal had <b>an</b> <b>unfair</b> {{advantage in the}} previous election, ran as a challenger in the 1990 Democratic primary. Dimauro's campaign was sullied by a false rumor he spread about the Bank of New England's financial situation, and Neal won the primary easily. He was unopposed in the general election, winning 68 percent of the vote. In 1992 his popularity was threatened by the House banking scandal, {{in which he had}} made dozens of unpenalized overdrafts at the House Bank. After narrowly defeating two Democratic opponents, he was challenged by Republican Anthony W. Ravosa, Jr., and Independent Thomas R. Sheehan. Neal won with 53 percent of the vote.|$|E
5|$|The United States, Canada and Germany, {{together}} with two unnamed teams, lodged a protest with officials following Williams' successful {{first day of}} competition. The protest alleged that her helmet was illegal, as ridges in it might give her <b>an</b> <b>unfair</b> aerodynamic advantage. In accordance with competition rules, the jury of officials inspected the helmet, and rejected the protest. Their grounds for doing so were that the ridges in the helmet were not a separate piece affixed to the helmet, expressly banned by FIBT rules, but rather {{an integral part of}} the helmet, which made the helmet legal. A second protest, filed jointly by the US and Canada on the 19th, was also rejected.|$|E

5|$|The {{ethos of}} the {{aristocracy}} as exemplified in the English public school greatly influenced Pierre de Coubertin. The public schools subscribed {{to the belief}} that sport formed an important part of education, an attitude summed up in the saying mens sana in corpore sano, a sound mind in a sound body. In this ethos, a gentleman was one who became an all-rounder, not the best at one specific thing. There was also a prevailing concept of fairness, in which practising or training was considered tantamount to cheating. Those who practised a sport professionally were considered to have <b>an</b> <b>unfair</b> advantage over those who practised it merely as a hobby.|$|E
5|$|Windsor Park is {{the largest}} Association {{football}} stadium in Northern Ireland, with Glentoran's ground, the Oval, being the next largest. The governing body of Northern Irish football, the Irish Football Association, leases the ground {{for use by the}} Northern Ireland national football team. The club currently receives 15% of Northern Ireland international gate receipts as rent. This is controversial as rival Irish League clubs see this as giving Linfield <b>an</b> <b>unfair</b> advantage by allowing them to offer more attractive wages and have a larger squad than all of the other clubs. In 2010, UEFA provided €500,000 towards substantial refurbishment of the stadium, to increase capacity and improve safety.|$|E
5|$|In the Malaysian case Tan Tek Seng v. Suruhanjaya Perkhidmatan Pendidikan (1996), the {{appellant}} had appealed {{against his}} wrongful dismissal from employment {{on the grounds}} of procedural unfairness. One of the issues brought up was whether <b>an</b> <b>unfair</b> procedure meant that he had been deprived of his constitutional right to life or liberty protected by Article 5(1) of the Malaysian Constitution, which is identical to Singapore's Article 9(1). Judge of the Court of Appeal Gopal Sri Ram held that the courts should take into consideration the unique characteristics and situation of the country, and must not be blind to the realities of life. He went on to suggest that a liberal approach be adopted to grasp the intention of the framers of the Constitution by giving life a broad and liberal meaning. He opined that such an interpretation would include elements that form the quality of life, namely the right to seek and be engaged in lawful and gainful employment, and the right to live in a reasonably healthy and pollution-free environment. He also noted that life cannot be extinguished or taken away except according to procedure established by law.|$|E

5|$|Mold {{continued}} to have his supporters. MacLaren later wrote that he believed Mold never intentionally threw; A. N. Hornby consistently defended Mold, partly because, as Mold's captain during the 1890s, {{it would have been}} a slur against his sportsmanship to admit that <b>an</b> <b>unfair</b> bowler had been in his team. Most Lancashire supporters never doubted that Mold's action was fair. Cricket historian Don Ambrose suggests that Mold probably did throw his faster delivery, which may have accounted for the high proportion of his wickets which were bowled. It also explained his ability to produce a delivery that surprised the batsman; W. G. Grace once observed that it was particularly painful to be struck by a delivery from Mold. The lack of action by Phillips' fellow umpires was possibly, according to Ambrose, due to their unwillingness to cause problems for a fellow professional cricketer. However, Ambrose also suggests that in the Somerset match, Phillips was determined to end Mold's career and that not every delivery that he called was actually a throw.|$|E
5|$|Soubise has {{historically}} taken {{the blame for}} the loss, but this may be <b>an</b> <b>unfair</b> assessment. While he did owe his rank to his good relationship with Madame de Pompadour, the mistress of King Louis XV, he was neither blessed with extraordinary military acumen nor with the best troops: he could do nothing about the former, and most of the latter were with Louis Charles César Le Tellier, fighting in the Rhineland. Under Soubise's command, the French had conducted a notorious march across Germany, characterized by persistent pillaging. His army also had approximately 12,000 civilian camp followers. There were chefs, hair dressers, perruquiers, barbers, wives and mistresses, pastry chefs, tailors and clothiers of all kinds, saddle makers, bridle makers, grooms, and servants of all varieties who served the nobility. In addition, the army had its usual motley crew of farriers, grooms, veterinarians, surgeons, and cooks that sustained an army on the march. After the battle, the Comte de Saint Germain, who had commanded the advanced guard and also the rear guard that struggled {{to keep up with the}} fleeing army, complained that the troops in his charge had been defective, a gang of robbers, murders, and cowards who ran at the sound of a gunshot.|$|E
5|$|The initial squad was {{selected}} for the British team on 14 July; however, the final team was not confirmed until {{the outcome of a}} courtcase involving Dwain Chambers. Under the rules of the BOA, Chambers had been banned from future Games after testing positive for the steroid THG in 2003. His appeal to overturn that ban, {{on the grounds that it}} was <b>an</b> <b>unfair</b> restraint of trade, failed and he was omitted from the squad. The team included former Olympic medal winners Marlon Devonish and Kelly Sotherton, as well as former Olympic individual finalists Joanne Pavey, Paula Radcliffe, Helen Clitheroe and Tasha Danvers. Women's marathon world record holder Paula Radcliffe faced a battle to be fit for the Games due to a stress fracture in her left thigh. She eventually proved fit enough to start the race but struggled to finish in 23rd position.|$|E
