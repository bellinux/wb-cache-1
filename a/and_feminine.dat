5|$|The possessive determiners (analogous to English my, his, etc.) {{are used}} to {{indicate}} the possessor of the noun they determine. They mark the person and number of the possessor, and are inflected {{to agree with the}} noun they are attached in number and case. While the English language distinguishes between masculine <b>and</b> <b>feminine</b> singular possessors (his vs. her), late Quenya generally does not.|$|E
5|$|Ardhanarishvara {{represents}} {{the synthesis of}} masculine <b>and</b> <b>feminine</b> energies of the universe (Purusha and Prakriti) and illustrates how Shakti, the female principle of God, is inseparable from (or the same as, according to some interpretations) Shiva, the male principle of God. The union of these principles is exalted as the root and womb of all creation. Another view is that Ardhanarishvara {{is a symbol of}} Shiva's all-pervasive nature.|$|E
5|$|She {{is placed}} {{firmly in the}} imperialist {{literature}} of nineteenth-century England, and inspired by Rider Haggard's experiences of South Africa and British colonialism. The story expresses numerous racial and evolutionary conceptions of the late Victorians, especially notions of degeneration and racial decline prominent during the fin de siècle. In the figure of She, the novel notably explored themes of female authority <b>and</b> <b>feminine</b> behaviour. It has received praise and criticism alike for its representation of womanhood.|$|E

5|$|Agoncillo was a {{daughter}} of a rich family {{in her hometown of}} Taal, Batangas. Finishing her studies at Santa Catalina College, she acquired her learning in music <b>and</b> <b>feminine</b> crafts. At the age of 30, Agoncillo married Filipino lawyer and jurist Don Felipe Agoncillo and bore him six children. Her marriage led to her important role in Philippine history. When her husband was exiled to Hong Kong during the outbreak of the Philippine Revolution, Agoncillo {{and the rest of the}} family joined him and temporarily resided there to avoid the anti-Filipino hostility of some foreign countries. While in Hong Kong, General Emilio Aguinaldo requested her to sew a flag that would represent their country. Agoncillo, her eldest daughter and a friend manually sewed the flag in accordance with General Aguinaldo's design which later became the official flag of the Philippines.|$|E
5|$|Early Old Swedish was {{markedly}} {{different from the}} modern language in {{that it had a}} more complex case structure and also retained the original Germanic three-gender system. Nouns, adjectives, pronouns and certain numerals were inflected in four cases; besides the extant nominative, there were also the genitive (later possessive), dative and accusative. The gender system resembled that of modern German, having masculine, feminine and neuter genders. The masculine <b>and</b> <b>feminine</b> genders were later merged into a common gender with the definite suffix -en and the definite article den, in contrast with the neuter gender equivalents -et and det. The verb system was also more complex: it included subjunctive and imperative moods and verbs were conjugated according to person as well as number. By the 16th century, the case and gender systems of the colloquial spoken language and the profane literature had been largely reduced to the two cases and two genders of modern Swedish.|$|E
5|$|Similarly, in the second-singular, {{inherited}} *-ta -ti {{competed with}} lengthened *-tā -tī for masculine <b>and</b> <b>feminine</b> forms. The expected {{result would be}} -t or -tā for masculine, -t or -tī for feminine, and in fact both variants of both forms {{are found in the}} Bible (with -h marking the long -ā and -y marking the long -ī). The situation appears to have been quite fluid for several centuries, with -t and -tā/tī forms found in competition both in writing and in speech (cf. the Secunda (Hexapla) of Origen, which records both pronunciations, although quite often in disagreement with the written form as passed down to us). Ultimately, writing stabilized on the shorter -t for both genders, while speech choose feminine -t but masculine tā. This is the reason for the unexpected qamatz vowel written under the final letter of such words.|$|E
