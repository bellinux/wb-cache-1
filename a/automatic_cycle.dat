50|$|Denis Papin (22 August 1647 - c. 1712) was a French physicist, {{mathematician}} and inventor, {{best known}} for his pioneering invention of the steam digester, the forerunner of the pressure cooker. In the mid-1670s Papin collaborated with the Dutch physicist Christiaan Huygens on an engine which drove out the air from a cylinder by exploding gunpowder inside it. Realising the incompleteness of the vacuum produced by this means and on moving to England in 1680, Papin devised a version of the same cylinder that obtained a more complete vacuum from boiling water and then allowing the steam to condense; in this way he was able to raise weights by attaching the end of the piston to a rope passing over a pulley. As a demonstration model the system worked, but in order to repeat the process the whole apparatus had to be dismantled and reassembled. Papin quickly saw that to make an <b>automatic</b> <b>cycle</b> the steam would have to be generated separately in a boiler; however, he did not take the project further. Papin also designed a paddle boat driven by a jet playing on a mill-wheel in a combination of Taqi al Din and Savery's conceptions and he is also credited with a number of significant devices such as the safety valve. Papin's years of research into the problems of harnessing steam was to play a key part {{in the development of the}} first successful industrial engines that soon followed his death.|$|E

40|$|Purpose: We {{present a}} novel method to process kinematical data {{typically}} coming from measurements of joints. This method will be illustrated through two examples. Methods: We adopt theoretical kinematics {{together with the}} principle of least action. We use motion and inverse motion for describing the whole experimental situation theoretically. Results: By using the principle of least action, the data contain information about inherent reference points, which we call characteristic points. These points are unique for direct and inverse motion. They {{may be viewed as}} centers of the fixed and moving reference systems. The respective actions of these characteristic points are analytically calculated. The sum of these actions defines the kinematical action. This sum is by design independent of the choice of reference system. The minimality of the kinematical action can be used again to select numerically one representative cycle in empiri-cally given, approximately periodic motions. Finally, we illustrate the theoretical approach making use of two examples worked out, hinge movement and the sagittal component of the movement of a human leg during gait. Conclusions: This approach enables <b>automatic</b> <b>cycle</b> choices for evaluating large databases in order to compare and to distinguish empirically given movements.

To reach these objectives I made plywood using three phenolic adhesives in a split-split plot design, varying assembly time (5, 20, 45 minutes) and species (16 Southeast Asian hardwoods) through four replications. Samples from these panels were subjected to vacuum/ pressure soak (PS 1 - 74); standard boil cycle (PS 1 - 74) for 2, 5, 10, and 25 cycles; <b>automatic</b> boil <b>cycle</b> (ASTM D 3434 - 75) for 20, 40, 100, and 200 cycles; weatherometer (ASTM G 23 - 69) for 2400 hours; and wet/dry cycling for 2400 hours.

The literature in human machine systems suggests that operators develop elaborate mental models that influence all aspects of their interaction with complex manufacturing systems. Research on the human factors issues in manufacturing is in its infancy, and none of this research has focused on operator mental models. Therefore, this research investigates the operator mental models when they control CNC lathe and EDM. The goal of this research is to identify and understand cognitive issues that may be used to improve the design of advanced manufacturing technology (AMT). ^ This research consists of two sequential studies, study 1 on CNC lathe control and study 2 on EDM control. Study 1 required five experienced machinists to verbalize or 2 Ì 2 think aloud 2 Ì 2 while controlling a CNC lathe while study 2 required nine experienced tool makers to verbalize as they created a mold cavity using an EDM. Study 1 examined two VPA methods and found that concurrent VPA was better suited for shop floor activities than retrospective VPA. A hybrid approach with concurrent VPA as the primary method and retrospective VPA as the secondary methods was used in study 2. ^ The verbal data was transcribed, segmented, encoded, and analyzed along with operator control behavior to derive mental models. These mental models for both tasks were compared and contrasted. The verbal protocol data was used to identify similarities and differences in operator control behavior for CNC lathe and EDM. Operators had elaborate mental models of part geometry and the manufacturing processes needed to achieve the desired shape. Operators used exploratory learning as their primary problem-solving strategy. Operators used rough and finish machining strategies to adjust the trade-off between input and output parameter setting in EDM only. During each machine tools <b>automatic</b> <b>cycle,</b> the operators demonstrated elaborate mental models of monitoring and trouble-shooting. This was especially important for EDM, where the operators were continually adjusting process parameters to maintain stable machining conditions.

Consequently, promoting and investing in green travel modes such as cycling is high on the agenda for many transport authorities. In order to target investment in cycling infrastructure and improve the experience of cyclists on the road, {{it is important to}} know where they are. Unfortunately, investment in intelligent transportation systems over the years has mainly focussed on monitoring vehicular traffic, and comparatively little is known about where cyclists are on a day to day basis. In London, for example, there are a limited number of <b>automatic</b> <b>cycle</b> counters installed on the network, which provide only part of the picture. These are supplemented by surveys that are carried out infrequently. Activity tracking apps on smart phones and GPS devices such as Strava have become very popular over recent years. Their intended use is to track physical activity and monitor training. However, many people routinely use such apps to record their daily commutes by bicycle. At the aggregate level, these data provide a potentially rich source of information about the movement and behaviour of cyclists. Before such data can be relied upon, however, it is necessary to examine their representativeness and understand their potential biases. In this study, the flows obtained from Strava Metro (SM) are compared with those obtained during the 2013 London Cycle Census (LCC). A set of linear regression models are constructed to predict LCC flows using SM flows along with a number of dummy variables including road type, hour of day, day of week and presence/absence of cycle lane. Cross-validation is used to test the fitted models on unseen LCC sites. SM flows are found to be a statistically significant (p< 0. 0001) predictor of total flows as measured by the LCC and the models yield R squared statistics of ~ 0. 7 before considering spatio-temporal variation. The initial results indicate that data collected using fitness tracking apps such as Strava are a promising data source for traffic managers. Future work will incorporate the spatio-temporal structure in the data to better account for the spatial and temporal variation in the ratio of SM flows to LCC flows...|$|E

The work has also been chosen as a finalist at the âUrbanPromo 2010 â contest, the urban and territorial marketing event sponsored by the National Institute of Urban Planning and Urbit which was held in Venice in 2010. The project consists in a green mobility proposal, developed with an approach based on {{the integration of the}} environmental redevelopment of a portion of river Solofrana, located in the Salerno Province, and of the renewal of seven local stations of the railway line Mercato San Severino â Nocera Inferiore, including the realization of a cycle-path network for the natural environment fruition. Furthermore the work drew attention to the local and regional administration. The main intent of the project is to integrate sustainable mobility themes with the environment recovery in a territory affected by high environmental troubles. The area includes the municipalities of Nocera Inferiore, Nocera Superiore, Mercato San Severino, Castel San Giorgio and Roccapiemonte, situated in Salernoâs province, with a total population about 114. 000 (font Demo ISTAT 2010). The area extension is about 84, 30 sqkm and it is crossed by river Solofrana that is the central point of the project idea. The intervention strategy is defined in two kinds of actions: internal and external rail station interventions. The external rail station interventions regard the construction of pedestrian-cycle paths with the scope of increasing the spaces dedicated to cyclists and to pedestrians along the river Solofrana sides and to connect the urban areas with the railway station. In this way, itâs also possible to achieve an urban requalification of the interested area. On the other side, the interventions inside the station, according to Transit Oriented Development principles, aim at redeveloping common spaces with the insertion of new activities and at realizing new <b>automatic</b> <b>cycle</b> parks covered by photovoltaic panels. The project proposal consists of the urban regeneration of small railway stations along the route-Nocera-Codola Mercato San Severino in the province of Salerno, through interventions aimed at improving pedestrian accessibility.
