5|$|The Boat Captain– A humorous addition, the Boat Captain {{encountered}} Kratos {{on several}} occasions, although these were always to the Boat Captain's detriment. In God of War, Kratos ignored him {{when in the}} belly of the Hydra and brushed him aside in the Underworld. In God of War II, the Boat Captain fled from Kratos as a spirit even though summoned to fight him, and in God of War III, he left a note of hatred towards Kratos in the Underworld <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>voice</b> was heard in Kratos' psyche. The character was voiced by Keith Ferguson in God of War and God of War II, and Josh Keaton in God of War III during the psyche sequence.|$|E
5|$|The {{fighting}} in Scotland continued {{as a civil}} war. Lord Moray was assassinated on 23 January 1570. The regent who succeeded him, the Earl of Lennox, was also a victim of violence. On 30 April 1571, the controller of Edinburgh Castle, Kirkcaldy of Grange, ordered all enemies of the Queen to leave the city. But for Knox, his former friend and fellow galley-slave, he made an exception. If Knox did not leave, he could stay in Edinburgh, but only if he remained captive in the castle. Knox chose to leave, and on 5 May he left for St Andrews. He continued to preach, spoke to students, and worked on his History. At the end of July 1572, after a truce was called, he returned to Edinburgh. Although by this time exceedingly feeble <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>voice</b> faint, he continued to preach at St Giles'.|$|E

25|$|On November 1, 1928, Alexandru Tzigara-Samurcaș {{provided}} the first-ever Radio Romania broadcast in history, with an art lecture specifically written for this purpose. This, Tzigara recalled, was a pro bono activity to please Radio Romania's president Constantin Angelescu, but made the speaker himself very nervous: Tzigara thought his own text bland <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>voice</b> ill-adapted for the medium, but {{took pains to}} improve them in later broadcasts. In 1929, Tzigara was a first judge at the original Miss Romania beauty contest, in a panel which also included Vaida-Voevod, writers Liviu Rebreanu and Nicolae Constantin Batzaria, woman activist Alexandrina Cantacuzino and other public figures.|$|E

25|$|Caruso's father, Marcellino, was a {{mechanic}} and foundry worker. Initially, Marcellino thought his son should adopt the same trade, {{and at the}} age of 11, the boy was apprenticed to {{a mechanic}}al engineer who constructed public water fountains. (Whenever visiting Naples in future years, Caruso liked to point out a fountain that he had helped to install.) Caruso later worked alongside his father at the Meuricoffre factory in Naples. At his mother's insistence, he also attended school for a time, receiving a basic education under the tutelage of a local priest. He learned to write in a handsome script and studied technical draftsmanship. During this period he sang in his church choir, <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>voice</b> showed enough promise for him to contemplate a possible career in music.|$|E

People cried in the streets. For six weeks, he lay in the hospital as fans awaited each report of his health. He was visited by {{a steady stream of}} commoners and luminaries of film industry, polity and bureaucracy. From his hospital bed, he conducted his campaign for Madras Legislative Assembly. He won twice the number of votes polled by his Congress rival and the largest vote polled by any candidate for the Assembly.|$|E

Lake began with a Fender bass before he switched to a Gibson Ripper. As well as bass, Lake contributed acoustic and electric guitar work to Emerson Lake & Palmer, <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>voice</b> had a wider and more diverse range than anything The Nice had recorded. Emerson, Lake & Palmer {{became one of the}} most successful groups in the 1970s. Lake became known for performing on a Persian carpet on stage, which originally sold for £1,500 and, by 1976, had increased its value to £7,000.

25|$|After {{his return}} to the front, he was wounded in the throat by a sniper's bullet. At 6ft 2 in (1.88 m) Orwell was {{considerably}} taller than the Spanish fighters and had been warned against standing against the trench parapet. Unable to speak, and with blood pouring from his mouth, Orwell was carried on a stretcher to Siétamo, loaded on an ambulance and after a bumpy journey via Barbastro arrived at the hospital at Lérida. He recovered sufficiently to get up and on 27 May 1937 was sent on to Tarragona and two days later to a POUM sanatorium in the suburbs of Barcelona. The bullet had missed his main artery by the barest margin <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>voice</b> was barely audible. It had been such a clean shot that the wound immediately went through the process of cauterisation. He received electrotherapy treatment and was declared medically unfit for service.|$|E
25|$|Aged 20, Ajith was {{selected}} by the Telugu film production company Lakshmi Productions, to star in its film; however, shooting was stalled soon after filming began, {{following the death of}} the film's director. Ajith then started his film career at the age of 21, appearing in the low budget Telugu film Prema Pustakam in 1992, which remains his last direct Telugu film to date. His first Tamil film Amaravathi, directed by then newcomer Selva, was a moderate success <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>voice</b> was rendered by fellow actor Vikram. After the release and while training for an amateur motor race, Ajith suffered a fall, injuring his back and underwent three major surgeries resulting in a bed rest for one and a half years. Following the injury in 1993, Ajith played a small role in the Arvind Swamy starrer Paasamalargal, before appearing in a supporting lead role in the family drama Pavithra, which featured him as an ailing patient shown maternal affection from Raadhika.|$|E

Produced by Martin Terefe, {{the song was}} digitally released as the second single from the album on January 25, 2010. Cullum's version substituted the original's electro-house groove with a [...] "sinuous" [...] acoustic bass and [...] "brushed" [...] drumming.

500|$|Crash {{was created}} by Andy Gavin and Jason Rubin, and was {{originally}} designed by Charles Zembillas. Crash {{was intended to be}} a mascot character for Sony to use to compete against Nintendo's Mario and Sega's Sonic the Hedgehog. Before Crash was given his name (which stems from the visceral reaction to the character's destruction of boxes), he was referred to as [...] "Willie the Wombat" [...] for much of the duration of the first game's production. Crash has drawn comparisons to Mario and Sonic the Hedgehog by reviewers. His animations have been praised, <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>voice</b> has been criticized, while his redesign in the Radical Entertainment games has drawn mixed reactions.|$|E
