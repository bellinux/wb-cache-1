5|$|Low immune {{function}} {{has also been}} implicated in endometrial cancer. High blood pressure is also a risk factor, but {{this may be because}} of its association with obesity.

5|$|As {{measured}} on women undergoing in vitro fertilization, a longer menstrual cycle length is <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> <b>higher</b> pregnancy and delivery rates, even after age adjustment. Delivery rates after IVF have been {{estimated to be}} almost doubled for women with a menstrual cycle length of more than 34 days compared with women with a menstrual cycle length shorter than 26 days. A longer menstrual cycle length is also significantly associated with better ovarian response to gonadotropin stimulation and embryo quality.|$|E

50|$|Limited {{research}} {{exists on}} other psychological constructs to which maximizing is related. However, {{several studies have}} shown maximizing to be <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> perfectionism, and Nenkov et al. (2008) qualified this relationship as being true primarily for the high standards component. Some research has also linked maximizing to high need for cognition, again primarily <b>with</b> the <b>high</b> standards component. Finally, research examining the association between maximizing and personality dimensions of the Big Five personality model have found high standards to be <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> <b>high</b> conscientiousness and decision difficulty with low conscientiousness.

5|$|One {{study found}} that people with or without {{hypertension}} who excreted less than 3 grams of sodium per day in their urine (and therefore were taking in less than 3g/d) had {{a higher risk of}} death, stroke, or heart attack than those excreting 4 to 5 grams per day. Levels of 7g per day or more in people with hypertension were <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> <b>higher</b> mortality and cardiovascular events, but this was not found to be true for people without hypertension. The US FDA states that adults with hypertension and prehypertension should reduce daily intake to 1.5g.|$|E
5|$|The {{effect on}} sexual desire is varied, with {{increase}} or decrease in some but with no effect in most. Combined oral contraceptives {{reduce the risk of}} ovarian cancer and endometrial cancer and do not change the risk of breast cancer. They often reduce menstrual bleeding and painful menstruation cramps. The lower doses of estrogen released from the vaginal ring may reduce the risk of breast tenderness, nausea, and headache <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> <b>higher</b> dose estrogen products.|$|E
5|$|DST has mixed {{effects on}} health. In {{societies}} with fixed work schedules it provides more afternoon sunlight for outdoor exercise. It alters sunlight exposure; {{whether this is}} beneficial depends on one's location and daily schedule, as sunlight triggers vitamin D synthesis in the skin, but overexposure can lead to skin cancer. DST may help in depression by causing individuals to rise earlier, but some argue the reverse. The Retinitis Pigmentosa Foundation Fighting Blindness, chaired by blind sports magnate Gordon Gund, successfully lobbied in 1985 and 2005 for U.S. DST extensions. DST shifts are <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> <b>higher</b> rates of ischemic stroke {{in the first two}} days after the shift, though not in the week thereafter.|$|E

5|$|Decompression {{sickness}} and arterial gas embolism in recreational diving {{are associated with}} certain demographic, environmental, and dive style factors. A statistical study published in 2005 tested potential risk factors: age, gender, body mass index, smoking, asthma, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, previous decompression illness, years since certification, dives in the last year, number of diving days, number of dives in a repetitive series, last dive depth, nitrox use, and drysuit use. No significant associations with risk of decompression sickness or arterial gas embolism were found for asthma, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, smoking, or body mass index. Increased depth, previous DCI, larger number of consecutive days diving, and being male were <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> <b>higher</b> risk for decompression {{sickness and}} arterial gas embolism. Nitrox and drysuit use, greater frequency of diving in the past year, increasing age, and years since certification were associated with lower risk, possibly as indicators of more extensive training and experience.|$|E
5|$|Limousins {{generally}} have {{lower levels of}} intra-muscular fat (marbling) and subcutaneous fat when compared with British breed cattle grown in similar conditions. Marbling, together with tenderness and flavour, {{has been associated with}} eating quality in some countries, and attracts a higher quality grading with associated premiums, although the link between marbling and palatability is not universally supported. In some countries, Limousin's lean, tender meat is considered to be of outstanding quality and marketed through specialist outlets. Beef producers targeting the higher marbling specifications of some markets, but who have concerns over the poorer feed conversion efficiency and yield <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> <b>higher</b> marbling British breed cattle, use Limousin sires over British breed cows, or British breed sires over Limousin cows, in crossbreeding programmes that aim to achieve a balance between the different and conflicting production demands.|$|E
5|$|Most of {{the risk}} factors for endometrial cancer involve high levels of estrogens. An {{estimated}} 40% of cases {{are thought to be}} related to obesity. In obesity, the excess of adipose tissue increases conversion of androstenedione into estrone, an estrogen. Higher levels of estrone in the blood causes less or no ovulation and exposes the endometrium to continuously high levels of estrogens. Obesity also causes less estrogen to be removed from the blood. Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), which also causes irregular or no ovulation, is <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> <b>higher</b> rates of endometrial cancer for the same reasons as obesity. Specifically, obesity, typeII diabetes, and insulin resistance are risk factors for TypeI endometrial cancer. Obesity increases the risk for endometrial cancer by 300â€“400%.|$|E

Nokian Heavy Tyres Ltd is {{a manufacturer of}} special tyres for forestry, industrial machinery, and agriculture. Its products are sold as original equipment as well on the replacement tyre market. Nokian Tyres produces a number of product lines, including the Tractor Industrial 2 and Country King. Nokian Tyres is a world market leader in forestry tyres, which are a key product of the Nokian Heavy Tyres subsidiary. Nokian forestry tyres include the Skidder and Cut-To-Length model lines. The Skidder tyres have a 25 degree bar angle and the Cut-To-Length tyres have a 35 degree bar angle. Bar angle is a tyre tread measurement. Smaller bar angles are <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> <b>higher</b> traction {{at the expense of}} increased mud accumulation.|$|E
5|$|Complaints of {{low back}} pain {{are one of the}} most common reasons people visit doctors. For pain that has lasted only a few weeks, the pain is likely to subside on its own. Thus, if a person's medical history and {{physical}} examination do not suggest a specific disease as the cause, medical societies advise against imaging tests such as X-rays, CT scans, and MRIs. Individuals may want such tests but, unless red flags are present, they are unnecessary health care. Routine imaging increases costs, is <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> <b>higher</b> rates of surgery with no overall benefit, and the radiation used may be harmful to one's health. Fewer than 1% of imaging tests identify the cause of the problem. Imaging may also detect harmless abnormalities, encouraging people to request further unnecessary testing or to worry. Even so, MRI scans of the lumbar region increased by more than 300% among United States Medicare beneficiaries from 1994 to 2006.|$|E
5|$|There are {{a number}} of {{cultural}} factors that reinforce this practice. These include the child's financial future, her dowry, social ties and social status, prevention of premarital sex, extramarital pregnancy and STIs. The arguments against it include interruption of education and loss of employment prospects, and hence economic status, as well as loss of normal childhood and its emotional maturation and social isolation. Child marriage places the girl in a relationship where she is in a major imbalance of power and perpetuates the gender inequality that contributed to the practice in the first place. Also in the case of minors, there are the issues of human rights, non-consensual sexual activity and forced marriage and a 2016 joint report of the WHO and Inter-Parliamentary Union places the two concepts together as Child, Early and Forced Marriage (CEFM), as did the 2014 Girl Summit (see below). In addition the likely pregnancies at a young age are <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> <b>higher</b> medical risks for both mother and child, multiple pregnancies and less access to care with pregnancy being amongst the leading causes of death amongst girls aged 15â€“19. Girls married under age {{are also more likely to}} be the victims of domestic violence.|$|E
