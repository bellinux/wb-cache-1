5|$|When Locke {{leaves the}} island to bring the {{survivors}} back to the island, Ben tracks him down. He gets Locke to reveal what he knows about returning to the island, then kills him and stages it as a suicide. Ben visits Jack in the funeral home housing Locke's body, telling Jack he will help him return to the island, {{but the only way}} to get back is to bring everyone who had left it, including Locke's corpse. Ben boards Ajira Airways Flight 316 with the rest of survivors, which then crashes on the island. Jack, Kate, Hurley, and Sayid are transported to 1977, while Sun and Ben remain in 2007 with a resurrected Locke. The plane crash lands on the Hydra Island, so Ben attempts to take a boat to the main island. Sun strikes him in the back of the head and takes the boat with Frank, so Ben is left in the care of the other survivors, including Locke. After Ben regains consciousness and finds Locke to be alive, he convinces Locke he knew bringing him to the island would resurrect him, and he stopped Locke's suicide attempt merely to gain information. Locke travels with Ben, who is to be judged by the Monster. After they fail to find the Monster at the Barracks, they head to the Temple. As Ben and Locke travel through a series of tunnels beneath the Temple, Ben falls through the floor, so Locke leaves to get something that he can pull him up with. The Monster flows out of a grate below and surrounds Ben, showing flashes of decisions he made in his life involving Alex. The Monster takes the form of Alex and pushes Ben against a wall. She says she knows Ben is planning to kill Locke again, and if he does she will hunt him down and destroy him. She orders him to follow Locke <b>and</b> <b>do</b> <b>whatever</b> he asks, then disappears. They return to the Others' camp, where Locke gathers the group together and announces he is taking them to see Jacob. As they are walking, Ben relates his experience with the Monster and his promise to do whatever Locke asks, so Locke convinces Ben to kill Jacob. Richard leads them to the base of the statue, where Jacob lives. Within, they are met by Jacob (Mark Pellegrino). Jacob greets Locke and observes Locke has found a loophole. It is revealed that Locke was not resurrected, and is instead the Monster taking the form of Locke. Ben confronts Jacob about why he never revealed himself at any time during Ben's tenure as leader, but when Jacob is dismissive towards him, he stabs Jacob twice, killing him - and in doing so, binds his destiny to the island, sealing his own fate.|$|E
25|$|Existential psychotherapies, an {{application}} of humanistic psychology, applies existential philosophy, which emphasizes the idea that humans {{have the freedom to}} make sense of their lives. They are free to define themselves <b>and</b> <b>do</b> <b>whatever</b> it is they want to do. This is a type of humanistic therapy that forces the client to explore the meaning of their life, as well as its purpose. There is a conflict between having freedoms and having limitations. Examples of limitations include genetics, culture, and many other factors. Existential therapy involves trying to resolve this conflict.|$|E
25|$|Tuesday's Task: When Eric was {{nominated}} for Thursday's eviction, his Tuesday night task was to flatter <b>and</b> <b>do</b> <b>whatever</b> {{it takes to make}} sure a specific person did not vote to evict him, and he completed this task if that person voted to evict the other nominee. When Eric was not nominated, then his Tuesday night task was to target one of the two nominees for eviction. Eric automatically voted for the winner of the AP poll, and he completed the task if the majority of HouseGuests voted to evict the same player he had been instructed to target. Eric successfully completed five of the eight tasks involving persuading the house to evict a nominee. The one time Eric was on the block and had to flatter Dick to secure their vote, he chose not to.|$|E

500|$|Due to the erratic {{motion and}} large size of Juan, {{tropical}} cyclone warnings and watches were issued for {{large portions of}} the northern Gulf Coast. Around the time of landfall, hurricane warnings were issued from Port Arthur, Texas to Mobile, Alabama, with gale warnings farther to the east to Apalachicola, Florida and extending to the west to Port O'Connor, Texas. The storm's quick development left people generally unprepared. National Hurricane Center forecaster Neil Frank likened Juan to [...] "a spinning top [...] will spin around unpredictably <b>and</b> <b>do</b> <b>whatever</b> it wants." ...|$|E
500|$|Frazier {{was born}} on November 1, 1990 in Houston, Texas, to Billy and Janice. He started playing {{basketball}} when he was five years old. He would knock down trophies of his sister and challenge his sister Krystal to games. His sister later said, [...] "Most people learn basketball early on with a one-on-one kind of mentality... Tim {{at an early age}} didn't have that. He always wanted to make the team better <b>and</b> <b>do</b> <b>whatever</b> it takes to help team out. He is such a true point guard." [...] In his childhood, he was considered too small for contact sports, but was noted for his quickness, which helped him thrive as a guard on the court.|$|E
500|$|Lyrically, [...] "Beat Goes On" [...] {{encourages}} {{people to}} say whatever they like <b>and</b> <b>do</b> <b>whatever</b> they feel. The song received generally favorable reviews from music critics, who commended the disco environment, while also praising Williams' production. However, some felt that the leaked version {{was better than the}} final version featuring West. [...] "Beat Goes On" [...] was certified platinum in Brazil for selling over 100,000 digital downloads. It also charted inside the top-twenty in Finland and on the Canadian Hot 100 chart. The song was performed live during the Sticky & Sweet Tour, featuring Madonna and her dancers on a 1935 Auburn Speedster, while Williams and West appeared in the video being displayed on [...] backdrops. The live version was also included on the Sticky & Sweet Tour album.|$|E

5000|$|When {{asked about}} his {{portrayal}} of Tommy, Liotta stated that [...] "it was hard work." [...] He said that [...] "you're pretty much putting yourself in game developers' hands <b>and</b> <b>doing</b> <b>whatever</b> they want so there's not much {{for you to do}} creatively." ...|$|R
500|$|... "Beat Goes On" [...] was re-recorded in October 2007 by Spike Spent, Andrew Coleman and Alex Dromgoole at Sarm Studios, London, {{and at the}} Record Plant Studios, California. Spent and Coleman also mixed {{the track}} at the Record Plant. Williams' {{production}} team, The Neptunes, produced the track, with Madonna. The song was written by Madonna and Williams, with rap vocals by West, and the title is a reference to The Whispers' disco track [...] "And the Beat Goes On" [...] (1980). [...] "Beat Goes On" [...] is a disco song, with funk and hip-hop influences, drum beat and bell chimes, as well as Williams' shimmering, thumping production, which according to Bradley Stern from Idolator, [...] "offers Madonna the perfect groove to wax bombastic about the cathartic pleasures of dancing." [...] Lyrically, [...] "Beat Goes On" [...] is a song about the freedom to dance, where people are urged to say whatever they like <b>and</b> <b>do</b> <b>whatever</b> they feel.|$|E
500|$|Balzac {{demonstrated}} {{these beliefs}} through the characters' lives in La Cousine Bette. The conflict between Baron Hulot and the perfumer Crevel mirrors the animosity between the aristocracy of the Ancien Régime {{and the newly}} developed bourgeoisie of traders and industrial entrepreneurs. Although he despised the socialist politics of Eugène Sue, Balzac worried that bourgeois desperation for financial gain drove people from life's important virtues. The characters– especially Bette, Valérie, and Crevel– are fixated on their need for money, <b>and</b> <b>do</b> <b>whatever</b> they must to obtain it. As Crevel explains to Adeline: [...] "Vous vous abusez, cher ange, si vous croyez que c'est le roi Louis-Philippe qui règne... au-dessus de la Charte il y a la sainte, la vénérée, la solide, l'aimable, la gracieuse, la belle, la noble, la jeune, la toute-puissante pièce de cent sous!" [...] ("You are quite mistaken, my angel, if you suppose that King Louis-Philippe rules us... supreme above the Charter reigns the holy, venerated, substantial, delightful, obliging, beautiful, noble, ever-youthful, and all-powerful five-franc piece!") ...|$|E
500|$|The role of {{the player}} {{character}} in the main quest was to be changed as well. In contrast to past games, where the player character would play a type of [...] "chosen one", Oblivion would have the player character [...] "find him, protect him, and help him." [...] Aside from that, {{in the opinion of}} Hines, [...] "the main quest has similar themes and tones as in past Elder Scrolls games", and should still feel [...] "epic", simply {{because of the way the}} gamespace is designed: with openness in mind. Improving that aspect of the experience, said Hines, came mostly in the form of improved information presentation. The system would not intrude on the experience when the player merely wishes to [...] "walk around and explore the world <b>and</b> <b>do</b> <b>whatever</b> he/she wants", but given the scenario where the player asks [...] "'OK, I'm ready to do the next part of the main quest, where do I go?'", the game would provide a ready answer, so as to avoid [...] "confusion" [...] and [...] "downtime".|$|E

500|$|Jack, {{believing that}} Don Geiss {{will give him}} the CEO job, and after {{learning}} about Liz's high school reunion, says [...] "I wish I had a Princeton reunion right now. I'd wipe the smug smile off Michelle Obama's face", a reference to Michelle Obama who graduated from Princeton, and to her husband, Barack Obama, who won the 2008 U.S. Presidential Election. At the reunion, Rob Sussman, a past classmate of Liz's, complains that Liz said he was gayer than the volleyball scene in the 1986 action film Top Gun. During the reunion, Liz's former classmates play Seven minutes in heaven, {{a game in which}} two people are selected to go into a closet or other dark enclosed space <b>and</b> <b>do</b> <b>whatever</b> they like for seven minutes, often kissing. Later, Liz's classmates plan to [...] "Carrie" [...] her on stage as revenge for her being mean to them, but is stopped by Jack saying [...] "we cannot Carrie Liz Lemon". This is a reference to the 1976 horror film Carrie in which the title character is drenched with pig's blood.|$|E
500|$|The game {{is set in}} a near-future, post-apocalyptic world. The team {{wanted to}} try {{something}} different, unwilling to return to a setting that was similar to Resistance 3. Instead of depicting a world with a dark atmosphere and gritty environments, the catastrophe that occurs in the game's story line is referred to as an [...] "awesomepocalypse” that transforms the user's initial view [...] of the game's world as a [...] "playground" [...] for players to explore <b>and</b> <b>do</b> <b>whatever</b> they want – [...] "emphasizing the fun of free [...] during end times." [...] The goal was to make players feel that the post-apocalyptic world in Sunset Overdrive is fun and limitless, delighting and lively, instead of a place that is dreadful and worrying. To achieve this, vibrant and vivid colors were used to create the game's world and the team hoped that by tweaking the nature of the setting, the game would be [...] "self-aware, humorous, and fun". The team also intentionally avoided creating a very serious tone because the final product needed to be entertaining and comparable to games like Crazy Taxi and Jet Grind Radio, instead of something too serious that looked like an interactive movie. The team emphasized [...] "fun trumps realism" [...] and reflected that through the [...] "Next-gen Respawn" [...] system, unrealistic weaponry, and the game's visual style.|$|E
500|$|It took [...] "fifteen man-years" [...] {{and three}} actual {{years to develop}} the game. [...] In a 2006 interview, lead {{designer}} Johnson said, [...] "I had never really designed a game before ... It's funny {{looking back on it}} now—just by happenstance I ended up creating a very open ended system where players could go anywhere <b>and</b> <b>do</b> <b>whatever</b> and a story sort of unfolded." [...] Ybarra stated that the game was almost cancelled more than once, and came out about a year behind schedule. Johnson was guided by Archon designer Paul Reiche III during development. Reiche advised him to draft a [...] "story network" [...] that would highlight all the most important points of the story and list the in-game objects necessary to advance from one to the next. The designers rewrote the script multiple times. The group designed what they called a [...] "fractal generator", which took six man-years to develop and allowed them {{to increase the number of}} planets in the game from 50 to 800. The game was one of the earliest to use procedurally generated content for planets and everything on them. The techniques used created a type of roguelike environment on each planet, with the contents randomly distributed. The story network was also one of the earliest examples of a sandbox game design. They created a separate ecosystem generator over the course of two man-years of work. The alien names were created by randomly combining syllables until they had names they liked, and their code for simulating communications was rewritten four times before completion.|$|E

2500|$|Williams named many singers as heroines: [...] "I love Debbie Harry and Siouxsie Sioux. I grew up {{listening}} to The Distillers [...] Girl groups are really important to me, but the Shangri-Las especially". Williams also explained that bands such as U2, [...] "who are massive, <b>and</b> <b>do</b> <b>whatever</b> they want, write whatever they want and they stand for something," [...] Jimmy Eat World, [...] "who I don’t think ever disappoint their fans," [...] and No Doubt, who [...] "have done amazing things," [...] act as a pattern for the path in which Paramore would like to take their career. In 2012, Williams contributed vocals to MewithoutYou's fifth studio album, Ten Stories.|$|E

From {{his earlier}} {{recordings}} as {{member of the}} Marquees and Harvey and the New Moonglows, and in his first several recordings with Motown, Gaye recorded mainly in the baritone and tenor ranges. He changed his tone to a rasp for his gospel-inspired early hits such as [...] "Stubborn Kind of Fellow" [...] and [...] "Hitch Hike". As writer Eddie Holland explained, [...] "He was the only singer I have ever heard known to take a song of that nature, that was so far removed from his natural voice where he liked singing, <b>and</b> <b>do</b> <b>whatever</b> it took to sell that song." ...|$|E

[...] He also {{suggested}} that power plants could use the dead bodies of Hindus as fuel. [...] "Jews," [...] el-Faisal said, [...] "should be killed ... as by Hitler." [...] He said: [...] "People with British passports, if you fly into Israel, it is easy. Fly into Israel <b>and</b> <b>do</b> <b>whatever</b> you can. If you die, you are up in paradise.
