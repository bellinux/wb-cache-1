25|$|The esonarthex (or inner narthex) {{is similar}} to the exonarthex, running {{parallel}} to it. Like the exonarthex, the esonarthex is 4 m wide, but it is slightly shorter, 18 m long. Its central, eastern door opens into the naos, whilst <b>another</b> <b>door,</b> {{at the southern end of}} the esonarthex opens into the rectangular ante-chamber of the parecclesion. At its northern end, a door from the esonarthex leads into a broad west-east corridor that runs along the northern side of the naos and into the prothesis. The esonarthex has two domes. The smaller is above the entrance to the northern corridor; the larger is midway between the entrances into the naos and the pareclession.|$|E
25|$|The {{very rare}} {{survival}} of a 'Horse mill', engine or 'gin' at Wester Kittochside {{has been professionally}} excavated and restored to working condition. It {{had been used to}} drive farm machinery, such as the winnowing machine in the corn barn which removes the husk from grain, powered via a rotating horizontal axle drive from the gin. As already stated, prior to using horse driven machines a flail was used by the farm workers to separate the grain from the husk. The flail itself being a wood pole with a smaller pole linked at the end via a chain or leather thong. <b>Another</b> <b>door</b> opposite the existing barn door used to provide sufficient wind to separate the grain from the chaff or seed husks.|$|E

25|$|This {{technique}} provides insights {{in other}} situations {{such as the}} Monty Hall problem, a game show scenario in which a car is hidden behind one of three doors, and two goats are hidden as booby prizes behind the others. Once the contestant has chosen a door, the host opens one of the remaining doors to reveal a goat, eliminating that door as an option. With only two doors left (one with the car, the other with another goat), the player must decide to either keep their decision, or switch and select the other door. Intuitively, one might think the player is choosing between two doors with equal probability, and that the opportunity to choose <b>another</b> <b>door</b> makes no difference. But probability spaces reveal that the contestant has received new information, and can increase their chances of winning by changing to the other door.|$|E
500|$|The soundtrack {{is a mix}} of {{rock and}} roll and rhythm and blues with the {{original}} score created by film composer Elmer Bernstein, who had been a Landis family friend since John Landis was a child. Bernstein was easily persuaded to score the film, but was not sure what to make of it. Similar to his preferring dramatic actors for the comedy, Landis asked Bernstein to score it as though it were serious. He adapted the [...] "Faber College Theme" [...] from the Academic Festival Overture by Brahms, and said that the film opened yet <b>another</b> <b>door</b> in his diverse career, to scoring comedies.|$|E
500|$|The {{priest and}} {{antiquarian}} Harry Longueville Jones visited St Michael's in 1845. At that time, {{the church was}} [...] internally; he recorded the north chapel as measuring 12feet 8inches by 17feet (3.9 by 5.2m) and the south chapel, which was separated from {{the main body of}} the church by five rotting wooden columns, as [...] The main entrance was through a porch on the south side of the nave, and there was <b>another</b> <b>door</b> on the north side. A bench under the windows on the north side of the nave was inscribed [...] "T. M. 1684". The southern chapel, he said, had similar windows to those in the north chapel. On the external wall above the east window, he noted a shield topped by a coronet, apparently that of a viscount, and the date 1638. On a step by the altar he noted two gravestones that appeared to be those of priests, given that they had each been inscribed with a cross, and a third gravestone, similarly marked, was in use as the lintel above one of the doorways. A survey in 1937 by the Royal Commission on Ancient and Historical Monuments in Wales and Monmouthshire dated one of the gravestones by the altar to the 11th or 12th century.|$|E

500|$|Writing in {{the journal}} for the Society for Psychical Research, Count Perovsky-Petrovo-Solovovo {{described}} a letter by Dr. Barthez, a physician {{in the court of}} Empress Eugenie, which claimed a sitter Morio de l'lle caught Home using his foot to fake supposed spirit effects during a séance in Biarritz in 1857. Home wore thin shoes, easy to take off and draw on, and also cut socks that left the toes free. [...] "At the appropriate moment he takes off one of his shoes and with his foot pulls a dress here, a dress there, rings a bell, knocks one way and another, and, the thing done, quickly puts his shoe on again." [...] Home positioned himself between the empress and Napoleon III. One of the séance sitters known as General Fleury also suspected that Home was utilizing trickery and asked to leave but returned unobserved to watch from <b>another</b> <b>door</b> behind Home. He saw Home slip his foot from his shoe and touch the arm of the Empress, who believed it to be one of her dead children. The observer stepped forward and revealed the fraud, and Home was conducted out of the country: [...] "The order was to keep the incident secret." [...] The allegations described by Dr. Barthez and General Fleury are second hand and have caused dispute between psychical researchers and skeptics.|$|E

2500|$|Feldhendler {{was among}} those who survived the war, hiding in Lublin until the end of German occupation. The city was taken by the Soviet Red Army on 24 July 1944, and became the {{temporary}} headquarters of the Soviet-controlled communist Polish Committee of National Liberation established by Joseph Stalin.

2500|$|A {{follow up}} report was {{published}} on February 18, 1890 with the title, [...] "A Weird Witch: More Tales of a Mulhattanish Flavor from Adams Station." [...] In the late 19th century, Joseph Mulhattan was a known hoaxer of newspaper articles. The article was republished {{a few days}} later with the subtitle [...] "More Tales of a Fishy Flavor." [...] In the account, the entity was referred to only as the witch. The article reports that a Mr. Johnson was visiting Buck Smith and were discussing a recent visitation of the ghost at his home. They heard a knocking at the door, and when they opened the door, the knocking began at <b>another</b> <b>door.</b> They sat down and the dog began to fight with something invisible. Two minutes later, the door flew open and fire spread across the room blown by a cyclonic wind with the coals disappearing as they tried to put it out. That evening Mr. Johnson started home on his horse and something jumped on the back grabbing his shoulder as he tried to restrain the horse. He felt it jump off as he neared his home and move in the leaves into the woods.|$|E
2500|$|That same year, Charlie Russell {{expressed}} interest in constructing a log cabin studio to work in. There {{was a lack of}} good logs in Great Falls at the time, but telephone service had arrived in 1890. Russell purchased a large number of Western red cedar telephone poles, and constructed the one-room cabin from these materials. He also built a rock fireplace and chimney {{on the east side of}} the structure. The log cabin was [...] north-south by [...] east-west, and had a porch extending across the entire south side, on top of which Russell threw numerous elk antlers. A skylight was built into the gabled roof, and <b>another</b> <b>door</b> cut through the northeast corner of the structure. A small storage shed was attached to the cabin near this door. At some point between 1903 and 1926, Charlie Russell had the roof raised by two logs in order to accommodate a large canvas. The interior was furnished with rough, hand-made stools and benches; carpeted with buffalo and bear skins; and contained hundreds of pieces of Indian and cowboy gear. Russell also built two birdhouses against the exterior of the eastern wall.|$|E
2500|$|In October 2003, Travis {{escaped from}} the Herolds' car and held up traffic at a busy intersection, {{and was on the}} loose for several hours. [...] The {{incident}} began after a pedestrian threw something at the car that went through a partially open window and struck Travis while they were stopped at a traffic light. [...] Startled, Travis unbuckled his seat belt, opened the car door and chased the man, but did not catch him. [...] When police arrived, they lured the chimpanzee into the car several times only to have Travis let himself out of <b>another</b> <b>door</b> and occasionally chase the officers around the car. [...] The 2003 incident led to the passing of a Connecticut law prohibiting people from keeping primates weighing more than 50 pounds as pets and requiring owners of exotic pets to apply for a permit. The new law took effect in 2004, and as of Travis's death, no one in the state had applied to adopt a chimpanzee. The Connecticut Department of Environmental Protection did not enforce the law on the Herolds because they had owned 200-pound Travis for so long and because the DEP did not believe Travis posed a public safety risk.|$|E
