40|$|A {{number of}} {{questions}} will arise as you develop a research question. Has the question you are <b>asking</b> <b>already</b> been answered? Have other attempts been made to answer the question? If so, what techniques have been tried and what problems have arisen? Is there {{work in this area}} that will assist in developing your proposal? To find out you need to review the literature, that is, conduct a literature search. The idea of sitting in a medical library reading a few journal articles sounds interesting and easy. It is, {{but it is not a}} literature search. With so many medical journals published each year it is necessary to conduct a formal search of the published literature and the advent of electronic databases has simplified the process. However, there are a number of traps for beginners. As a beginner and having made most of the mistakes, I have been asked to write this article so that you can avoid the traps...|$|E

Gola had a railway station on the Barcs - Nagykanizsa railway line (opened in 1868) in Hungarian territory. The use of the station for Gola {{district}} citizens was possible and were ruled under a special Hungarian - Yugoslav agreement until World War II. After the Cold War started, the access through the border was prohibited. The last train stopped at Gola station on 18 June 1951 at 3:50 p.m.(1, [...] "...the last train is number 2407.

His heavy lower lip hung stupidly. Sotillo made a sign. Hirsch was jerked up off his feet, and a yell of despair and agony burst out in the room, filled the passage of the great buildings, rent the air outside, caused every soldier of the camp along the shore to look up at the windows, started some of the officers in the hall babbling excitedly, with shining eyes; others, setting their lips, looked gloomily at the floor.|$|R

50|$|In 1990, ASK {{purchased}} the Ingres Corporation, a declining software company that developed the {{database management system}} called Ingres. The deal called for 30 percent of ASK {{to be sold to}} Hewlett-Packard and Electronic Data Systems (EDS) for a total of $60 million, which in turn enabled ASK to pay $110 million for Ingres. ASK's stockholders complained about this strange multi-way financing move. Shareholder James Lennane, who held ten percent of the company's shares, announced he would try to oust the company's board of directors at the next shareholders' meeting. Despite this, Kurtzig's deal proceeded as planned. <b>ASK</b> <b>already</b> made use of Ingres software in its own work, linking the accounting and manufacturing departments of its clients to its own database. Hewlett-Packard made the hardware upon which much of ASK's software ran, and the ASK resold Hewlett-Packard products as part of its software packages. Both Hewlett-Packard and EDS had strong histories of involvement with manufacturing businesses, and this heritage promised to open more potential markets for ASK.|$|R

40|$|Estimation of the {{covariance}} matrix {{has attracted a}} lot of attention of the statistical research community over the years, partially due to important applications such as Principal Component Analysis. However, frequently used empirical covariance estimator (and its modifications) is very sensitive to outliers in the data. As P. J. Huber wrote in 1964, " [...] . This raises a question which could have been <b>asked</b> <b>already</b> by Gauss, but which was, as far as I know, only raised a few years ago (notably by Tukey) : what happens if the true distribution deviates slightly from the assumed normal one? As is now well known, the sample mean then may have a catastrophically bad performance [...] . " Motivated by this question, we develop a new estimator of the (element-wise) mean of a random matrix, which includes covariance estimation problem as a special case. Assuming that the entries of a matrix possess only finite second moment, this new estimator admits sub-Gaussian or sub-exponential concentration around the unknown mean in the operator norm. We will explain the key ideas behind our construction, as well as applications to covariance estimation and matrix completion problems...|$|R

[...] "Srbijašume", which owns the lot but not the complex, claimed that the municipality is mismanaging the complex and asked the Republic's Directory for Properties to alienate the facilities from the municipality and that they offered to do reconstruction with their own funds, but that municipality rejected them. Municipality responded that they have absolutely no intention of giving away the complex they built to [...] "Srbijašume" [...] without any compensation and <b>asked</b> (<b>already</b> in 2002, with a proper offer) to buy the lot, too, {{because they do not}} wish to reconstruct Šuplja Stena so that it could be given to someone else, claiming that after 1997 the complex was left ruined and became a gathering place for drug addicts and vagrants. However, the government in 2006 refused to sell the lot to the municipality. The subject was brought to the public attention by the series of articles in newspapers, and in 2007 Vračar officially took over Šuplja Stena again.In February 2012, the reconstruction of one third of the complex was finished and it was open for children.|$|R
