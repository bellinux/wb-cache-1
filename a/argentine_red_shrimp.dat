40|$|The {{relationship}} between the relative abundance of mature and impregnated females of the <b>Argentine</b> <b>red</b> <b>shrimp</b> Pleoticus muelleri (Bate 1888) and environmental variables was analyzed using statistical methods. Analyzed data carne from the research cruises of the Instituto Nacional de Investigación y Desarrollo Pesquero (INIDEP) carned out durmg January 2000, 2001, 2005, and 2007; March 2006; and November 2004, 2005, and 2006 in San Jorge Gulf (Argentina). The biological variables considered were the relative abundances of mature and impregnated female shrimp, whereas the environmental variables corresponded to depth, bottom water temperature and salinity, {{and the difference between}} surface and bottom water temperature and salinity. Generalized additive models were used as an exploratory tool for the numerical data and the general linear models as a confirmatory tool. The results showed that the distributions and abundances of mature and impregnated females were related to the bottom water temperature and salinity and to depth. The relationship increased along with temperature; with salinity, however, it decreased for mature females and increased for impregnated females.

40|$|This work {{looks into}} the {{conservation}} of South American sea lions (SSL), Otaria byronia 1 by advancing a process of Marine Protected Area (MPA) design targeted for reproductive females during the first weeks of lactation. Focusing on protection of a single species may result {{in the establishment of}} a more comprehensive and ecologically functional system for management. SSL is distributed in the Atlantic and the Pacific coasts of South America. Along the coast of the Argentine Patagonian coast, 73 colonies were described, 42 % of which are reproductive. Breeding females give birth during the austral summer (January) and lactation lasts ca. one year. Critical to the annual cycle are the few weeks after birth, when mothers spend 2 - 3 days nursing and a similar or longer time at sea foraging, while pups remain alone on shore. Satellite tracking and dive recording instruments indicate that females are either coastal or pelagic in their feeding habits, but the latter travel relatively short distances from colony (mean 152 km). SSL are bottom foragers that dive to maximum depths of approximately 80 m. Optimizing travel and foraging time is critical for these animals, as pups left alone fast and are threatened by both starvation and being accidentally crushed by fighting adult males. Foraging areas overlap with fishing grounds, sea lions are caught in fishing gear and competition for food cannot be ignored. Yet, although 20 of the 31 existing breeding colonies are within coastal protected areas, none of the foraging areas have been considered for protection to minimize the consequences of interactions with fisheries. This work draws from very limited data to advance a process of design of Marine Protected Areas that is eminently practical, thus affordable to government wildlife administrators. I selected the most important colonies, based on location and abundance, integrated satellite locations at sea, analyzed potential associations with physical variables, and proposed criteria to decide important marine areas based on distribution at sea. Finally, I estimated the cost for fisheries to comply with the proposed conservation intervention scenarios. Foraging distribution did not follow a pattern consistent with physical oceanographic variables (sea surface temperature, productivity, bathymetry and seafloor composition) to guide conservation intervention. Bathymetry was the best proxy to help in the design of protected areas. Most of the conservation scenarios based on distribution at sea of lactating females did not strongly overlap with fisheries to justify conservation intervention. The colonies that did, however, involved the largest breeding colonies of Argentine Patagonia and Uruguay. In a context of closing the fisheries for the area of overlap and compensate for the loses during one month, I estimate a conservation cost of 2 - 3 million dollars, as the impact is on the most profitable of all Argentine Patagonian fisheries, targeting <b>Argentine</b> <b>red</b> <b>shrimp,</b> Pleoticus muelleri. I conclude that management that includes MPAs for this species requires a priori spatial planning considerations. Once a fishery is operational, the costs for conservation will not be affordable for the administrators.

40|$|The bloody <b>red</b> <b>shrimp</b> {{is a tiny}} {{freshwater}} crustacean in {{the order}} Mysidacea; more {{commonly referred to as}} mysids. Mysids are also sometimes called opossum shrimp because females typically carry their eggs in a pouch. While the effect this shrimp will have on the Great Lakes is unknown, based on its history of invasion across Europe, significant impacts are possible. Species Description These shrimp are very small, with males reaching only 8 - 10 mm and females reaching 11 - 16 mm. They have large, stalked eyes and eight pairs of legs. They are typically red to orange in color due to pigmented cells called chromatophores; however, coloration can be highly variable and change with varying light and temperature conditions. Some individuals lack color completely and are ivory or translucent. Without a microscope, the best way to distinguish the bloody <b>red</b> <b>shrimp</b> from other shrimp is by counting legs — it has eight pairs of legs, while most other larger shrimps and decapods have five pairs.

The dataset covers a span of 15 years (1994 - 2008) and consists of {{a broad spectrum of}} predictors: fleet-dependent (e. g. number of trips performed by vessels and their technical characteristics, such as the gross registered tonnage), temporal (inter- and intra-annual variability), environmental (North Atlantic Oscillation [NAO] index) and economic (<b>red</b> <b>shrimp</b> and fuel prices) variables. All predictors individually have an impact on LPUE, though some of them lose their predictive power when considered jointly. That is the case of the NAO index. Our results show that six variables from the whole set can be incorporated into a global model with a total explained deviance (ED) of 43 %. We found that the most important variables were effort-related predictors (trips, tonnage, and groups) with a total ED of 20. 58 %, followed by temporal variables, with an ED of 13. 12 %, and finally the <b>red</b> <b>shrimp</b> price as an economic predictor with an ED of 9. 30 %. Taken individually, the main contributing variable was the inter-annual variability (ED= 12. 40 %).

This paper {{describes}} the fishery by following the activity of this trawl fleet between 1992 and 1999. Principal Components Analysis (PCA) of specific catch compositions identified five main components that explained 92 % of the variability, and the catches were grouped into three main species: <b>red</b> <b>shrimp,</b> hake and blue whiting. Hierarchical Clustering Grouping of the percentage species catch composition allowed the fleet to be considered as two main groups, according to monthly landings and by differentiating {{the origin of the}} catches (slope or shelf). The species composition of the catch and the <b>red</b> <b>shrimp</b> catch rates (CPUE) differed between the two fleet groups. The application of Generalised Linear Modelling (GLM) to the CPUE series gave consistent indices of abundance. The fleet group, year and season had significant effects on shrimp catch rates, with the fleet group being the most important, and these models explained up to 62 % of the total deviance. The abundance indices showed little variation from 1992, although 1994 had the highest value and 1997 - 1998 the lowest. Comparison with survey indices showed similar trends, while mean uncorrected CPUE differed. Monthly variations of shrimp indices showed a lower abundance in summer, which was attributed to the reproductive patterns of the species.

A good correlation is found between the rises in the surrounding surface vorticity and the drops in the CPUE of the adult <b>red</b> <b>shrimp.</b> This correlation {{could be explained by}} assuming that most of the surface vorticity episodes could reach the bottom, increasing the seabed velocities and producing sediment resuspension, which could affect the near bottom water turbidity. A. antennatus would respond to this increased turbidity disappearing from the fishing grounds, probably moving downwards to the deeper waters. This massive displacement of <b>red</b> <b>shrimp</b> specimens away from the fishing grounds would consequently decrease their accessibility to fishing exploitation. Similar although more intense responses have been observed during the downslope shelf dense water current episodes that occurred in a submarine canyon, northeast of the Iberian peninsula. The proposed mechanism suggesting how the surface vorticity observed can affect the bottom sediments is investigated using a year-long moored near-bottom current meter and a sediment trap moored near the fishing grounds. The relationship between vorticity and catches is also explored for fish species (. Galeus melastomus, Micromesistius poutassou, Phycis blennoides) and other crustacean (. Geryon longipes and Nephrops norvegicus), considered as by-catch of the deep water fishery in the area.
