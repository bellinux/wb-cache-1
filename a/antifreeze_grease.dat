40|$|Creation {{of highly}} {{efficient}} catalytic systems for industrial processes is closely {{connected with the}} active development of modern chemistry. An increase in {{the efficiency of the}} catalysts can be achieved by directional formation of metal particles exhibiting high catalytic activity. In this connection, the problems of obtaining catalytic systems with control over the size of metal-containing particles are topical; stabilization of particles by polymers; studying the physical and chemical properties of such catalysts; studies of the kinetics of the reaction and the establishment of specific features of the mechanisms of the processes of fine organic synthesis on the systems obtained. The use of noble metal catalysts makes it possible to increase the selectivity and speed of industrially significant processes in chemical technology. Among the catalytic processes, {{one of the most important}} in practical and theoretical terms is the conversion of cellulose to glycols. Currently, more attention is being paid in the scientific and industrial fields to work aimed at developing effective methods for converting plant biomass into raw materials for the chemical and fuel industries, in particular ethylene and propylene glycol. These diols are an important raw material, widely used in the manufacture of pharmaceuticals, liquid fuels, emulsifiers, surfactants, <b>antifreeze,</b> <b>grease</b> and solvents, as well as for the synthesis of polyester fibers and resins. Most of the nickel or ruthenium-based catalytic systems used in industry do not provide high selectivity for conversion. Using a catalyst containing Sn and Ni will improve the selectivity of the process and the activity of the catalyst...|$|E
