25|$|In {{the valleys}} and {{lowlands}} the vegetation is dense, {{but the general}} appearance of the plateaus is of a comparatively bare country with trees and bushes thinly scattered over it. The glens and ravines on the hillside are often thickly wooded, and offer <b>a</b> <b>delightful</b> contrast to the open downs.|$|E
25|$|The canal follows <b>a</b> <b>delightful</b> rural {{route through}} {{farmland}} across Cheshire, {{with a short}} urban section near the junction at Middlewich. Many of the structures are original, and consequently, {{most of them are}} grade II listed. There is no commercial traffic on the waterway, but transition to the leisure age has resulted in two marinas being constructed to provide moorings for pleasure craft.|$|E
25|$|The {{most famous}} tomb {{in the church}} is that of Sir Richard Lyster (c.1480–1554). Lyster was Chief Baron and later Lord Chief Justice of the Common pleas. His tomb was erected in 1567. The tomb is {{situated}} in the north-east corner {{of the church and}} is <b>a</b> <b>delightful</b> early-Elizabethan example of the use of fluted columns and other classical details.|$|E

Reviewing the show for cabaretscenes.org, Harold Sanditen said: [...] "Her cabaret shows are always of the more traditional type. She’s had a long and very impressive career, and her show followed its progression, with backstage anecdotes about the people she’s met and worked with along the way. It may not be edgy, but it’s <b>a</b> truly <b>delightful</b> evening, by <b>a</b> truly <b>delightful</b> performer, in <b>a</b> truly <b>delightful</b> venue." ...|$|R

25|$|With {{just four}} minutes left, Coppell took a free-kick which was {{diverted}} into the danger zone by Joe Jordan and swung home by defender Gordon McQueen. Taking heart from this, Manchester United stormed forward {{in search of}} an equaliser and when Arsenal were unable to clear the ball properly, Coppell lifted <b>a</b> <b>delightful</b> chipped pass over the defence for Sammy McIlroy to latch on to and beat two Arsenal players before stroking the ball home.|$|E
25|$|The family {{enjoyed the}} spring weather and liked Dr Gully, and it {{developed}} into <b>a</b> <b>delightful</b> holiday in the festive atmosphere around the spa. His stomach trouble {{was diagnosed as}} nervous in origin, and he was soon free of sickness and walking sevenmiles (11km) a day. Despite his suspicions of quackery, the cure worked, and after staying 16 weeks they returned home, arriving on 30 June with Darwin eager to resume work on his barnacles.|$|E
25|$|On 20 September 2009, against West Ham, Babel {{came off}} the bench for Dirk Kuyt. At this stage the score was 2–2. Babel picked up the ball and did well to beat the full-back and sent in <b>a</b> <b>delightful</b> cross for Fernando Torres to head home the winner. Babel, who has been criticized {{in the past for}} his work rate and attitude, earned praise for his efforts in the West Ham game.|$|E

25|$|Her Recollections of a Literary Life (1852) is {{a series}} of causeries about her {{favourite}} books. Her talk was said by her friends, Elizabeth Browning and Hengist Horne, to have been even more amusing than her books, and five volumes of her Life and Letters, published in 1870 and 1872, show her to have been <b>a</b> <b>delightful</b> letter-writer. The many collections available of her letters provide especially useful commentary and criticism of her Romantic and Victorian literary contemporaries.|$|E
25|$|Her home in Boston, {{after her}} marriage, was <b>a</b> <b>delightful</b> one. Her house was soon a centre of attraction; and, {{surrounded}} by friends, she exercised there a gracious hospitality, and met {{the men and}} women who made the Boston of that epoch famous. Here was born her daughter, Florence, who later married William Sehaefer, of South Carolina. Here her husband died, and here she has remained through the days of her widowhood till the house become historic.|$|E
25|$|Ziegler's {{presence}} allows Kubrick {{to change}} {{the mechanics of the}} story in a few ways. In the film, Bill first meets his piano-playing friend at Ziegler's party, and then while wandering around town, seeks him out at the Sonata Café. In the novella, the café encounter with Nightingale is <b>a</b> <b>delightful</b> coincidence. Similarly, the dead woman whom Bill suspects of being the woman at the party who saved him is a baroness that he was acquainted with earlier, not a hooker at Ziegler's party.|$|E

25|$|It {{is clear}} that Ernest will win the {{election}} which is to follow the coup and become Grand Duke, which troubles Julia Jellicoe, a famous English comedian. As leading lady of the company, she is bound by contract to play the leading female role in any production. If Ernest, the manager, becomes the Grand Duke, she reasons that {{she will have to}} be the Grand Duchess. She says that this is a repugnant prospect to her (though it is <b>a</b> <b>delightful</b> one to Ernest), but that she will play the part in a professional manner.|$|E
25|$|India {{finished}} day 1 on 316/4, {{and accelerated}} their scoring significantly on day 2. Mahendra Singh Dhoni scored 92, {{and was only}} dismissed off the part-time spin of Kevin Pietersen after having hit two massive sixes and attempting a third. Then, veteran spinner Anil Kumble registered his maiden test century in his 118th match, which was <b>a</b> <b>delightful</b> moment for all followers of Indian cricket. Kumble would go unbeaten, finishing on 110 not out, and the lower order all contributed useful runs to help India compile an enormous score of 664. This total pretty much ensured that India could not lose the match, and would therefore win the series.|$|E
25|$|For {{nearly two}} centuries a farming community, San Jose {{produced}} {{a significant amount}} of fruits and vegetables until the 1960s, and many past and current names of teams, streets, buildings, and so on reflect its agricultural beginnings. Prunes, grapes, and apricots were some of the major crops. In 1922, the first commercial farming of broccoli in the U.S. was started in San Jose, by brothers Stephano and Andrea D'Arrigo. The Del Monte cannery in Midtown was the largest employer in the city for many years. There were so many orchards in the Santa Clara Valley, which emitted <b>a</b> <b>delightful</b> smell of ripening fruit, that a common nickname for the Santa Clara Valley was The Valley of Heart's Delight.|$|E

We came last night, {{got up to}} <b>a</b> <b>delightful</b> spring day, {{and we are now}} enjoying the little book room, with the windows open, hearing the birds sing, and the place looking {{beautiful}}. The plants in the passage are just watered: and with the passage door open the room smells like a greenhouse. Pamela has dressed four beautiful flower-pots, and is now working at her frame, while I write to my dearest mother; and upon the two little stands are six pots of fine auriculas, and I am sitting in a bay window with all those pleasant feelings which the fine weather, the pretty place, the singing birds, the pretty wife and Frescati give me.|$|E
25|$|By {{the third}} round things started to get interesting. Amelita, David and Hayley took up the {{challenge}} in the Australian-themed episode. Amelita's signature dish was an organic rib fillet with shaved ham, banana, and hollandaise sauce. Ben's comments were 'You eat with your eyes and that is beating me to death!' Amelita fired back saying 'Your shoes are beating me to death.' It did her no favours. David cooked up <b>a</b> <b>delightful</b> black sesame seed-crusted tuna which was favoured among the judges. Hayley's simple salmon on potato rösti was elegant and delighted the judges who commented on her presentation in particular the height. Despite her good looks and clever articulation it was David who was chosen to go through to the semi finals.|$|E
25|$|By 2001–02, Pirès had fully got {{to grips}} with the English game and had one of his best seasons. Pirès scored superb goals against Middlesbrough and Aston Villa. Against Aston Villa, Pirès chased after a long ball by Freddie Ljungberg, and lobbed the ball over the {{pursuing}} George Boateng, and finished off the move with <b>a</b> <b>delightful</b> lob over Peter Schmeichel. He led the Premier League assist charts and was voted both FWA Footballer of the Year and Arsenal's player of the season, as Arsenal won the league title. This was despite not playing the last two months of the season after suffering a cruciate ligament injury in a FA Cup match against Newcastle United. This also ruled him out of playing in the 2002 World Cup with France.|$|E

25|$|Adventure Park in Asramam is {{a scenic}} {{park in the}} city which attracts so many {{visitors}} everyday, every time. It is along {{the shores of the}} Ashtamudi backwaters and is about 3km away from the city centre. It is a novel experiment in the country. The park is <b>a</b> <b>delightful</b> place for children. District Tourism Promotion Council arranges backwater cruises from here. Close to the park are the Government Guest House and a boat jetty. Different types of boats, including luxury cruise boats, powerboats and motorboats, are available on hire from the boat jetty near to the Adventure Park. 10 fascinating sculptures with distinctive themes are one of the major attractions of Adventure Park. The skillful hands of some of the state's finest sculptors have given a whole new ambience to the pristine beauty of the Adventure Park {{on the banks of the}} Ashtamudi Lake.|$|E
25|$|The {{following}} week, Genoa came to Parma led by ex-Parma manager Alberto Malesani as Parma {{looked to}} put an end to their indifferent early season form and Genoa went in search of a second win at the Tardini on their twentieth visit. They were able to make their good start to the first half pay with a goal from <b>a</b> <b>delightful</b> Giovinco lob on the half-hour mark after a neat Sergio Floccari assist. As the first half drew to a close, Giovinco's mazy dribble was then illegally halted in the penalty area by Juraj Kucka and Parma were awarded a penalty; Giovinco himself converted the resultant spot kick. As Genoa threw more men forward, the chances continued to come for Parma and a fine counter-attack ended with a Stefano Morrone finish from inches out after he had somehow conspired to hit the bar from 6 yards out. The gloss of a fine victory was taken off when Genoa themselves were awarded a penalty for a Gabriel Paletta tug on Rodrigo Palacio in the last minute and the Argentine got up to score the penalty and round off the scoring at 3–1. This lifted Parma out of the relegation zone and Giovinco to the top of the scoring charts, alongside fellow 5-goal frontman Rodrigo Palacio.|$|E
25|$|Parma {{travelled}} to Juventus {{to become}} Old Ladys first competitive {{opponents in the}} brand new Juventus Stadium on 11 September and hoping to win a fourth consecutive match against the Turin side. However, Juventus scored early on through a tidy Stephan Lichtsteiner finish off <b>a</b> <b>delightful</b> Andrea Pirlo pass. This reflected the balance of play and Juventus were unlucky to have Alessandro Matri's effort ruled out just before half-time. Simone Pepe finally doubled the lead on 57 minutes with an accomplished finish, having been put through by Alessandro Del Piero. The chances continued to flow and debutant Arturo Vidal scored a fine volley {{from the edge of}} the box to make it 3–0 with quarter of an hour to go. Pirlo found Claudio Marchisio with ten minutes to go and Marchisio chipped Parma goalkeeper Antonio Mirante to complete Juventus' scoring. A late Sebastian Giovinco run saw him fouled in the box and score the resulting penalty, leaving Parma ahead of only Atalanta who were deducted six points before the season's start. Juventus had emphatically ended Parma's 18-match unbeaten record in season openers with a 4–1 win, the Ducali losing for the first time since 1992, when they succumbed to Atalanta.|$|E
