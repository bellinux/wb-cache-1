5|$|The arm-tefillin is laid on {{the inner}} side of the bare left arm, right arm if one is left handed, two finger breadths above the elbow, so that when the arm is bent the tefillin faces towards the heart. The arm-tefillin is {{tightened}} with the thumb, the blessing is said, and the strap is immediately wrapped around the upper arm in the opposite direction it came from {{in order to keep the}} knot tight without having to hold it. Some wrap it around the upper arm for less than a full revolution (the bare minimum to keep the knot tight) and then wrap it around the forearm seven times, while others wrap it around the upper arm an additional time before wrapping it around the forearm. Many Ashkenazim wear the knot to be tightened (not to be confused with the knot on the base which is permanently tied and always worn on the inside, facing the heart) on the inside <b>and</b> <b>wrap</b> inward, while Nusach Sephard Ashkenazim and all Sephardim wear it on the outside <b>and</b> <b>wrap</b> outward.|$|E

5|$|Kirie and Shuichi {{devise a}} plan to escape Kurōzu-cho, but when they attempt to escape, their efforts are unsuccessful. After {{returning}} to the town, they discover that several {{years have passed since}} they left, as time speeds up away from the spiral. The other citizens have expanded the terraced houses until they connect into a single structure forming a spiral pattern. Kirie and Shuichi decide to search for Kirie's parents, which brings them {{to the center of the}} spiral. At the center, they fall down a pit, within which they discover the corpses of Kirie's parents and an ancient city completely covered with spiral patterns. Shuichi urges Kirie to move forward and find a way to stop the curse, but she replies that she does not have the strength and wishes to stay with him. The two embrace each other, and their bodies twist <b>and</b> <b>wrap</b> together as a result of the curse. As they lie together, Kirie notes that the curse ended at the same time it began, for just as time speeds up away from the center, it freezes at the center, and concludes that the curse is eternal, and all the events will repeat when a new Kurōzu-cho is built where the previous one laid.|$|E

25|$|Although {{not usually}} {{stated in the}} score, timpanists will change sticks to suit {{the nature of the}} music.

25|$|Chewing gum {{can come}} in a variety of formats ranging from 1.4-6.9 grams/piece and {{products}} can be differentiated by the consumers’ intent to form bubbles or the sugar/ sugarless dichotomy. Chewing gum typically comes in three formats: tablets, coated pellets, and sticks/ slabs. Bubble gum typically come in three formats as well: tablets, hollow balls, and cubes or chunks. Stick, slab, and tab gums typically come in packs of about 5-17 sticks and their medium size allows for softer texture. Pellet gums, or dragée gums, are pillow shaped pieces that are almost always coated. Packaging of pellet gums can vary from boxes to bottles to blister packs. The coating of pellet gum allows for the opportunity for multiple flavor sensations, since coating is done in a layering process and different flavor attributes can be added to various layers. Cube or chunk gums, which are typically intended for bubble blowing, are called cut <b>and</b> <b>wrap</b> gums as they are typically severed from continuous strands of extruded gum and packaged directly.|$|E

25|$|First, {{gum base}} is {{previously}} prepared through a melting and straining or filtering process. The formulation for gum base is proprietary information known to few individuals within each gum-producing company. Next, other ingredients such as nutritive and non-nutritive sweeteners and flavors {{are added to}} the gum base until the warm mixture thickens like dough. The gum base mixture is heated during this mixing process in order to increase the entropy of the polymers to achieve a more uniform dispersion of ingredients. Then, extrusion technology is implemented to smooth, form, and shape the gum. Next, the gum goes through a shaping process that is determined by gum type and consumer demand. For example, cut <b>and</b> <b>wrap</b> (chunk or cube) pieces are severed straight out of the extruder using a vertical cutter. Sheeting is a technique often used for stick, slab and tab gums. Next, gum is either conditioned by being sprinkled with a powdered polyol or coated via the application of subsequent layers of coating using temperature controlled coating basins before it is sent to packaging.|$|E

25|$|Nebraska's {{first season}} in the Big Ten Conference was {{moderately}} successful, placing third in the Legends Division and finishing {{the season with a}} 9–4 record. There was more success in 2012 as the Cornhuskers went undefeated at home {{for the first time since}} 2001 and won the Legends Division. However, they lost the Big Ten Championship game to Wisconsin and the Capital One Bowl to #6 Georgia, ending the season with a 10–4 record. 2013 saw Nebraska tie for second place in the Legends Division <b>and</b> <b>wrap</b> up a 9–4 season with a win over #23 Georgia in the Gator Bowl. In 2014, the Cornhuskers put up a regular season record of 9–3, tying for second place in the newly organized West Division. Pelini was fired the day after the regular season ended. At the time he was fired, the university reportedly still owed Pelini $7.65 million according to the terms of his contract. Pelini exited the Nebraska football program with a 67–27 record (.713), winning at least 9 games each season, although the Cornhuskers never won a conference title under Pelini. Shortly thereafter, Nebraska hired Oregon State University coach Mike Riley as the team's new head coach. The Cornhuskers concluded the 2014 season under interim head coach Barney Cotton, losing to #24 USC in the Holiday Bowl and finishing with a 9–4 record, marking Nebraska's seventh consecutive four-loss season.|$|E

25|$|Tabari writes, “God created Adam {{with his}} own hands so that God could say to Iblis (Satan) that he was exalting himself over that which God formed {{with his own}} hands. So God created Adam as a human and his body was from clay. God breathed his spirit into Adam. Then when God’s spirit entered his eyes he saw the fruits of Paradise and when it entered his stomach he was hungry, so before the spirit reached his feet {{he tried to get}} up in haste to have the fruits of Paradise. This is the meaning of God’s word: “Man was created in haste” (21:37) In regards to the testing of Adam and Eve, Ibn Ishaq writes, “Iblis started off by crying for Adam and Eve, and they became sad when they heard him. They asked him why he was crying and he said, “I am crying for you because you will die and be forced to give up the luxury and plenty you are enjoying.” Then Iblis went to them and whispered saying, “Adam, may I lead you to the Tree of Immortality and to a kingdom that does not decline?” (20:120) Meaning that they might become angels or live forever in Paradise. In the Qur'an it states, “When we took from the prophets their {{covenant}} from you, Noah, Abraham, and Jesus son of Mary. We took from them a solemn covenant” (Q 33:7) That covenant was, as quoted by Ibn Abbas “The Prophet Muhammad said, “God took a covenant from the back of Adam on the day of ‘Arafat. He caused all of his offspring to come out of him, and spread them out in front of him. In regards to Adam’s death, Tabari writes, “When Adam died it was Friday. The angels came to him, sent by God from Paradise, to embalm <b>and</b> <b>wrap</b> him, and they honored his son and heir Seth. Ibn Ishaq says: The sun and the moon were eclipsed for seven days and nights.|$|E

500|$|Fronts in {{meteorology}} are {{the leading}} edges of air masses that have a density, air temperature, and humidity different from the air mass it is invading. When an air mass passes over an area, it is marked by changes in temperature, moisture, wind speed and direction, atmospheric pressure, and often {{a change in the}} precipitation pattern. The change is called a front, whether it be warm or cold. Cold fronts develop when cold air masses, usually moving equatorward from the polar region high pressure zones, interact with warm moist air of [...] low pressure systems. The fronts develop at the leading edge of that cold air mass <b>and</b> <b>wrap</b> around (counter-clockwise in the northern hemisphere) about the low pressure zone. [...] A polar front may form approximately along the equatorward edge of the high-level polar jet. Fronts are guided by winds aloft, but they normally move at lesser speeds than those winds. In the northern hemisphere, they usually travel from west to east, although they can move in a north-south direction as well as they may wrap around an associated low pressure zone. Movement is driven by the pressure gradient force (horizontal differences in atmospheric pressure) and the Coriolis force (caused by the Earth's rotation on its axis). Frontal zones can be distorted by such geographic features as mountains and large bodies of water.|$|E
