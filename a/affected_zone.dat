5|$|Argon is also {{commonly}} {{mixed with}} other gases, oxygen, helium, hydrogen and nitrogen. The addition {{of up to}} 5% oxygen (like the higher concentrations of carbon dioxide mentioned above) {{can be helpful in}} welding stainless steel, however, in most applications carbon dioxide is preferred. Increased oxygen makes the shielding gas oxidize the electrode, which can lead to porosity in the deposit if the electrode does not contain sufficient deoxidizers. Excessive oxygen, especially when used in application for which it is not prescribed, can lead to brittleness in the heat <b>affected</b> <b>zone.</b> Argon-helium mixtures are extremely inert, and can be used on nonferrous materials. A helium concentration of 50–75% raises the required voltage and increases the heat in the arc, due to helium's higher ionization temperature. Hydrogen is sometimes added to argon in small concentrations (up to about 5%) for welding nickel and thick stainless steel workpieces. In higher concentrations (up to 25% hydrogen), it may be used for welding conductive materials such as copper. However, it should not be used on steel, aluminum or magnesium because it can cause porosity and hydrogen embrittlement.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this work has been to {{investigate}} the ultimate capacities of aluminium plates. The aluminium plates {{are supposed to be}} part of a marine structure. Their behaviour has been explored by taking advantage of non-linear finite element simulations. The loading conditions included axial compression, transverse compression, pure shear loading, axial compression in combination with transverse compression and axial compression in combination with shear loading. Different patterns of heat <b>affected</b> <b>zones</b> have been studied with particular attention on conventionally welded plates and extruded, welded plates. The plates have been given realistic boundary conditions in addition to boundary conditions believed to represent the extremities in plate collapse behaviour. The initial deflection patterns chosen, were generally conservative, and the variations in collapse capacities for different initial deflection patterns have been investigated. The initial deflection amplitudes were systematically varied to cover all values of the initial deflection amplitudes likely to occur. In addition to studying different patterns of the heat <b>affected</b> <b>zones,</b> systematic variations of the breadths of the heat <b>affected</b> <b>zones</b> have been performed. Systematic variations in the magnitudes of the residual stresses and systematic variations of the reductions of the 0. 2 percent tensile proof stresses in the heat <b>affected</b> <b>zones</b> have also been carried out. Three different aluminium alloys were studied. They were believed to represent a high, medium and low utilised aluminium alloy. The aspect ratio of the plates was varied to cover both plates that were completely square to plates with a length equal to five times the breadth of the plates. It was found that axially loaded plates with heat <b>affected</b> <b>zones</b> along loaded edges had lower ultimate capacities than plates with heat <b>affected</b> <b>zones</b> along unloaded edges, and if the plates had heat <b>affected</b> <b>zones</b> along loaded edges, having additional heat <b>affected</b> <b>zones</b> along unloaded edges did not alter the buckling capacities. The reduction in ultimate capacity could be modelled to vary linearly with the breadth of the heat <b>affected</b> <b>zones,</b> and the reduction in ultimate capacity could be modelled to vary linearly with the relationship between the value of the 0. 2 percent tensile proof stress in the heat <b>affected</b> <b>zones</b> and the 0. 2 percent tensile proof stress of the base material. The ultimate capacities of transversally loaded plates could be found as the sum of a square plate and a plate strip, even if the plates contained heat <b>affected</b> <b>zones.</b> Square plates and plate strips with relevant patterns of heat <b>affected</b> <b>zones</b> had to be employed. Biaxial interaction curves showed a considerable slenderness dependence for all values of the aspect ratio investigated. The biaxial interaction curves were only slightly affected by introduction of different patterns of heat <b>affected</b> <b>zones.</b> The stress corresponding to equal elastic and plastic strain was better suited as the normalising stress than the more commonly used 0. 2 percent tensile proof stress. One design curve could be used to represent all the different aluminium alloys investigated. Changing the aluminium alloy did not change the shape of the biaxial interaction curves. Based on the detailed study of the collapse behaviour of aluminium plates carried out, and established practice, new ULS design formulas for axial compression, transverse compression, pure shear loading, axial compression in combination with transverse compression and axial compression in combination with shear loading were proposed. The new design formulas accounted for reductions in ultimate capacities due to heat <b>affected</b> <b>zones,</b> including heat <b>affected</b> <b>zones</b> along loaded edges. They took full advantage of non-linear residual strength for slender plates; and the slenderness dependence and aspect ratio dependence for biaxial interaction curves were systematically incorporated. dr. ing. dr. ing...|$|R

40|$|Acid resins are {{residues}} characterised by elevated {{concentrations of}} hydrocarbons and heavy metals, which were produced by mineral oil industries in Central Europe {{during the first}} half of the last century. Due to the lack of environmental legislation at that time, these wastes were dumped into excavated ponds in public areas without further protection. In this work, the long-term effects of such resin deposits on soil quality of two forest areas (Bayern, Germany) were assessed. We evaluated the distribution and accumulation of contaminants in the surroundings of the deposits, where the waste was disposed of about 60 years ago. General soil chemical properties such as pH, C, N and P content were also investigated. Chemical analysis of resin waste from the deposits revealed large amounts of potential contaminants such as hydrocarbons (93 g kg- 1), As (63 mg kg- 1), Cd (24 mg kg- 1), Cu (1835 mg kg- 1), Pb (8100 mg kg- 1) and Zn (873 mg kg- 1). Due to the location of the deposits on a hillside and the lack of adequate isolation, contaminants have been released downhill despite the solid nature of the waste. Five zones were investigated in each site: the deposit, three <b>affected</b> <b>zones</b> along the plume of contamination and a control <b>zone.</b> In <b>affected</b> <b>zones,</b> contaminants were 2 to 350 times higher than background levels depending on the site.

This paper overviews the weld corrosion literature that has considered the possible mechanisms involved and the associated material and environmental conditions.

40|$|Abstract. In this work, {{we report}} on the {{friction}} stir weldability of a semi-solid cast ZK 60 alloy modified with 1. 5 wt % mischmetall in the lap-joint configuration using a 120 WV 4 steel tool with concave shoulder and conical pin. The coarser solidification microstructure in the semi-solid cast ZK 60 - 1. 5 %RE alloy requires low strain rates and increased heat input to produce lap-joints without inner defects. This was achieved with 250 rpm tool rotation and 50 mm/min welding speed. Friction stir welding results in a very fine grained microstructure in the stir zone probably due to dynamic recrystallization. In the thermomechanically <b>affected</b> <b>zones</b> dynamic recrystallization seems to occur within the solute enriched intergranular zones.

40|$|The {{relatively}} recent application of laser welding and spot welding to platinum has supplemented the traditional joining techniques of conventional welding and brazing with a gas torch. Several recent publications (1 - 3) have promoted {{the use of}} laser welding, because of the superior strength of the joins {{compared with that of}} joins by conventional welding and brazing. In this paper we compare welds in three different platinum alloys, produced with three different welding techniques: conventional welding, laser welding and spot welding. The welds joining cold-rolled bars were performed by jewellers operating in their own workshops. The extents of the heat <b>affected</b> <b>zones</b> and consequent decrease in hardness were assessed in our laboratory. Laser and spot welding produced very narrow heat <b>affected</b> <b>zones,</b> with correspondingly narrow regions of diminished hardness, while the conventional welding resulted in samples being annealed and softened for their full lengths.
