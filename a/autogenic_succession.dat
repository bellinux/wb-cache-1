40|$|SUMMARY. 1. This review {{considers}} the periodic cycles of species dominance {{in a wide}} selection of temperate lakes. By ascribing individual species to assemblages, a high incidence of similarity among periodic cycles is demonstrated. Reference to lakes at high and low latitudes, as well as to rivers, shows conformity to parts of the same broad patterns. 2. The role of population dynamics in shaping community structure is emphasized. Two types of change are recognized: <b>autogenic,</b> undirectional subsequences (<b>successions),</b> regulated by speeific responses to critically changing resource-ratio gradients; and allogenic changes, regulated by variability in the physical environment. 3. Analysis of the responses of representative species to allogenic change permits further grouping of the assemblages. These groupings coincide with clear morphological distinctions among the same phytoplankton species according to their unit sizes and surface area/volume ratios. 4. It is argued that these properties condition the physiological responses of algae to seasonal variations in temperature, mixing and exposure to the underwater light field. The responses are compounded by relative resistances to loss processes (sinking, grazing), by short-term photosynthetic adaptation and vertical migratory behaviour. 5. Graphical summaries are presented that relate the morphologically-, physiologically- and behaviourally-mediated responses to a hierarchy of physical, chemical and biotie environmental variables. Phytoplankton periodicity is the outcome of these interactions...|$|R

The structure of the plants themselves can also alter the community. For example, when larger species like trees mature, they produce shade on to the developing forest floor that tends to exclude light-requiring species. Shade-tolerant species will invade the area.|$|E
40|$|In general, mires develop by <b>autogenic</b> <b>succession</b> {{from more}} groundwater-fed to more rainwater-fed. This study from a {{calcareous}} mire in the West Carpathians (Slovakia) describes a similar {{development in the}} Early Holocene, followed by a reverse development in the Middle and Late Holocene. Pollen, macrofossil and testate amoeba analyses show that the site started as a minerotrophic open fen woodland. After 10 700 cal a BP <b>autogenic</b> <b>succession</b> led to the accumulation of at least 1 m of Sphagnum fuscum peat. Around 9000 cal a BP, as climate could no longer sustain a stable water regime, the bog desiccated and a fire broke out. The fire removed part of the peat layer {{and as a consequence}} relative water levels rose, leading to the establishment of a wet minerotrophic swamp carr with Thelypteris palustris, Equisetum sp. and Alnus sp. with extremely slow peat accumulation. After 600 cal a BP, rapid peat accumulation with calcareous tufa formation resumed as a result of anthropogenic deforestation and hydrological changes in the catchment and resulting increased groundwater discharge. At present the mire still hosts a wealth of relict and endangered plant and animal species typical of calcareous fens and fen meadows. Copyright (C) 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd...|$|E

40|$|The chronostratigraphy of {{a coastal}} bog was studied {{in order to}} {{distinguish}} the roles of autogenic and allogenic factors in peatland development. Well-dated stratigraphical sequences from a peat cliff were used. The peatland shows three main vegetation phases: rich fen, poor fen and bog. Peat formation started around 9500 yr BP and the first expansion phase of rich fen occurred between 8550 and 7400 yr BP. The rich fen gradually changed to a poor fen through autogenic processes between 7620 and 5500 yr BP. It then became a bog in two major development phases, possibly in response to climate change, around 5250 yr BP (central part) and 2800 yr BP (margins). Expansion resumed after 5500 yr BP and terminated shortly after 2500 yr BP when the peatland had filled the basin. Although <b>autogenic</b> <b>succession</b> is the dominant {{process by which the}} peatland has evolved, climatic variability has also affected peat expansion and vegetation change.

The record spans the last 9000 {{years and we}} test whether peatland development in the Eastern Carpathians is linked to climate change or to <b>autogenic</b> <b>succession.</b> We find that Sphagnum magellanicum was the dominant peat-forming species for ca. 8000 years but we also identify ten phases of increased representation of Eriophorum vaginatum at approximately 8100, 7550, 6850, 6650, 5900, 4650, 3150, 1950, 1450, 750 cal yr. BP. Visual inspection and wavelet analysis show that the episodic increases in the relative abundances of Eriophorum vaginatum were simultaneous with decreased abundances of Sphagnum magellanicum and Sphagnum angustifolium. Comparison with published palaeoclimatic records in this region suggests that these cyclical successions of S. magellanicum and E. vaginatum appear to be primarily a result of climate changes, with E. vaginatum developing mainly during dry phases and S. magellanicum during wetter periods. We therefore suggest {{that the development of}} this peatland was largely influenced by changing climatic conditions, although the role of autogenic plant succession cannot be excluded.

The GH summits have been characterized by constant vegetation patterns during the Holocene, {{except for a few}} sites close to altitudinal ecotones. Here, we report a new pollen record showing two significant vegetation shifts, from Myrica forests to tepuian meadows (5340 cal yr BP) and then to Chimantaea shrublands (2720 cal yr BP). These changes are analyzed in terms of potential forcing factors such as regional climate changes, fire and <b>autogenic</b> <b>succession.</b> The first shift occurred shortly after the Holocene Thermal Maximum and the onset of a cooling/drying trend. A charcoal peak was coeval with this change suggesting some potential influence of fire. Autogenic processes related to lake infilling might have also been involved. The second vegetation shift took place during a phase of increased precipitation variability due to an ENSO intensification. The establishment of Chimantaea shrublands started {{at the end of this}} phase coinciding with another charcoal peak (2300 cal yr BP).

40|$|The Holocene {{developmental}} {{history of}} a small kettle-hole peatland in northern Poland was studied using radiocarbon dating and analyses of pollen, plant macrofossils and testate amoebae {{with the aim of}} sorting out the influences of climate change, <b>autogenic</b> <b>succession</b> and human impact. The mire followed the classical succession from lake to a Sphagnum -dominated peatland, but peat accumulation only started about 3000 cal. BP. A rapid shift to wetter conditions, lower pH and higher peat accumulation rate took place about 110 — 150 years before present, when the vegetation shifted to a Sphagnum -dominated poor fen with some bog plants. While the first shift to a peat-accumulating system was most likely driven by climate, the second one was probably caused by forest clearance around the mire. This shift towards a Sphagnum -dominated vegetation mirrors both in pattern and timing the changes observed in similar situations in North America and New Zealand. While human activities have overall caused the loss of vast expanses of peatlands worldwide in recent centuries, locally they may have also allowed the development of communities that are now ironically considered to have a high conservation value. However, {{in the case of the}} site studied the likely anthropogenic shift to bog vegetation was at the expense of a species-rich poor fen, which today has even higher conservation value than ombrotrophic bogs.

40|$|Abstract The {{peatland}} pole {{forests of}} the Pastaza-Marañón Foreland Basin (PMFB), Peru, are the most carbon-dense ecosystems known in Amazonia once below ground carbon stores are taken into account. Here we present the first multiproxy palaeoenvironmental record including pollen data from one of these peatlands, San Jorge in northern Peru, supported by an age model based on radiocarbon and 210 Pb dating. The pollen data indicate that vegetation changes during the early phases of peat initiation resulted from <b>autogenic</b> <b>succession</b> in combination with fluvial influence. The overall pattern of vegetation change is not straightforward: the record does not reflect a process of unidirectional, progressive terrestrialization, but includes a reversal in the succession and vegetation transitions, which omit predicted successional phases. This complexity {{is similar to that}} seen in the only other existing pollen record from a PMFB peatland, at Quistococha, but contrasts with peat records from Panama and Southeast Asia where successional patterning appears more predictable. Our dating results provide the first evidence from a PMFB peatland that peat accumulation may have been discontinuous, with evidence for reduced rates of peat accumulation, or a possible hiatus, around 1300 – 400 cal yr BP. An ecological shift from open lake to palm swamp occurs at this time, possibly driven by climatic change.

40|$|In the várzea of Amazon River on Marchantaria Island. N₂ {{fixation}} {{was measured}} in the root-periphyton complex of three abundant macrophytes, i. e. Paspalum repens, Echinochloa polystachya and Eichhornia crassipes. The short-term study was set at a period of rising water when the biomass production of macrophytes is high. N₂ fixation was low in a main channel that links the river to the lakes, and it was high in Lakes Camaleão and Novo, the latter being a newly formed lake in the young sedimentation area of Marchantaria Island. The main factor controlling N₂ fixation on Marchantaria Island seemed to be O₂. The highest nitrogen input by N₂ fixation was observed in stands of Paspalum repens followed by Echinochloa polystachya and Eichhornia crassipes. Maximum rate of N₂ fixation reached 821. 3 nmol N g DW⁻¹ h⁻¹ in the root-periphyton complex of Paspalum repens at Lake Camaleão. Under dark conditions {{there was always a}} decline in the rate of N₂ fixation pointing to the predominance of photoautotrophic cyanobacteria. Considering both N₂ fixation in the light and in the dark, related to the biomass of each macrophyte stand, N input in all three macrophyte stands was highest at Lake Novo. Upscaling the rates of N₂ fixation, the input at Lake Novo was 235 kg N ha⁻¹ yr⁻¹, 37 kg N ha⁻¹ yr⁻¹ and 1 kg N ha⁻¹ yr⁻¹ in the stands of Paspalum, Echinochloa and Eichhornia, respectively.

40|$|Phytoplankton mirrors {{changes in}} the {{environment}} and {{plays an important role}} in biogeochemical processes. Phytoplankton dynamics is the outcome of both <b>autogenic</b> <b>succession</b> and external disturbances. This thesis focused on the seasonal variation of water column stability and its effects on phytoplankton, particularly considering the influence of mixing events on phytoplankton development. Lake Erken is a dimictic lake with weak and often interrupted summer stratification, which represents an intermediate case between a polymictic lake and a lake with strong summer stratification. There are two diatom phases annually. The spring bloom is caused by pioneer centric diatoms, and the autumn diatom phase is dominated by meroplanktonic diatoms induced by turnover. A summer Cyanobacteria bloom – mainly Gloeotrichia echinulata, depended on the length and stability of stratification. Winter and spring air temperature is found to play an important role in the annual succession of phytoplankton by initiating changes in ice/snow-cover and lake thermal stability and setting the basic status. Instead of starting from zero, the vernal phytoplankton piles up on the overwintering community, this trans-annual ecological memory influences both the composition and diversity and taxonomic distinctness of spring phytoplankton. Water column stability during summer in Lake Erken is mainly influenced by wind-induced turbulence and internal seiches. As thermal stratification develops from early until late summer, variations in stability and gradual deepening of the thermocline depth influence phytoplankton dynamics directly by changing its distribution, and also indirectly by altering the nutrient and light availability. A new disturbance index (DI) was defined to quantify environmental stability/disturbance and tested well to indicate phytoplankton equilibrium status in two summer stratification periods. The concept of species and functional groups was generally used in this study. However, a next generation sequencing based approach was also tested and proved to provide an excellent candidate for revealing distribution patterns of phytoplankton in inland waters...|$|E
40|$|We reconstructed the Holocene {{developmental}} {{history of}} a kettle-hole peatland in the Tuchola Forest of Northern Poland, using pollen, testat amoebae and plant macrofossil indicators. Our aims were to determine the timing and pattern of <b>autogenic</b> <b>succession</b> and natural and anthropogenic influences on the peatland. Northern Poland is under mixed oceanic and continental climatic influences but {{has so far been}} less studied in a palaeoecological context than more oceanic regions of Europe. In the first terrestrial developmental phase of the mire, the testate amoebae-inferred depth to water table revealed two major dry shifts at ca. 9400 (end of lake phase) and ca. 7100 cal BP (a period of global cooling and dry shift in Western Europe). Conditions became wetter again in two steps at ca. 6700 and ca. 5800 BP after a dry event at ca. 6100 BP. The timing of the wet shift at 5800 BP corresponds to wet periods in Western Europe. Peat accumulation rates were low (0. 1 mm yr − 1) between ca. 5600 and ca. 3000 BP when sedges dominated the peatland. In the last 2500 yrs surface moisture fluctuated with wet events at ca. 2750 – 2400, and 2000 BP, and dry events at ca. 2250 – 2100 and 1450 BP. After 1450 BP a trend towards wetter conditions culminated at ca. 500 cal BP, possibly caused by local deforestation. Over the mire history, pH (inferred from testate amoebae) was mostly low (around 5) with two short-lived shifts to alkaline conditions (7. 5) at ca. 6100 and 1450 BP indicating a minerotrophic influence from surface run-off into the mire. Up to about 1000 BP the ecological shifts inferred from the three proxies agree with palaeoclimatic records from Poland and Western Europe. After this date, however correlation is less clear suggesting an increasing local anthropogenic impact on the mire. This study confirms that kettle-hole peatlands can yield useful palaeoenvironmental data as well as recording land-use change and calls for more comparable studies in regions are the interface between major climate influences...|$|E
40|$|Basiphilous pioneer {{species are}} among the most {{endangered}} plant species in The Netherlands. They find most of their refuges in young coastal dune slacks, especially on the Wadden Sea islands. For the purpose of nature management {{it is important to know}} which processes control the presence of basiphilous pioneer communities, and to learn about the nature of slacks harbouring the concerning successional sequences. In a large dune slack on the Island of Terschelling, we assessed soil nutrient status and tested for nutrient limitation in four chronosequential stages: 2, 6, 37 and ca. 80 yr of age. Stage 2 harboured a basiphilous pioneer vegetation; in the stages 3 and 4 a dense vegetation of dwarf shrubs and grasses occurred. Soil organic matter and nutrient concentrations in each stage were measured in 1991. In 1992 and 1993 fertilizers were applied to all stages to detect nutrient limitation. Rates of accumulation of organic matter, nutrients and above-ground biomass were estimated. When interpreted as successional stages, the different stages represent a sequence as expected on the basis of general successional theory. There was a peak in yearly nutrient accumulation between the 6 - and 37 -yr old stage and a steady state after ca. 80 yr. Between the first two and the latter two stages a shift occurred from allogenic to <b>autogenic</b> <b>succession</b> which correlated with a shift in emphasis from available nutrients to light availability as limiting resources. Basiphilous pioneer species suffered only deficiency of nitrogen, probably because of their low phosphorus requirements. It is concluded that in dune slack habitats, in addition to a low nutrient availability in general, a very low phosphorus availability favours basiphilous pioneer species to species showing co-limitation of nitrogen and phosphorus as found in some grasses and dwarf shrubs. A comparison between the effects of lime addition and the effects of nitrogen and phosphorus additions suggests that, in the early stages, soil buffering increases the availability of nitrogen and inhibits the availability of phosphorus. Sod cutting is an effective technique for restoring basiphilous pioneer vegetation, when slacks are acidified only superficially and buffering-mechanisms can be reactivated. Yearly mowing and removing of standing crop may prolong the lifespan of basiphilous pioneer vegetation, when soil acidification has not yet dropped below pH 6. ...|$|E
40|$|Aim To {{reconstruct}} the historical biogeography of Pinus sylvestris in the Cantabrian Range (Iberian Peninsula) during the Holocene, {{and to consider}} the interactions between vegetation dynamics, climate change {{and the role of}} man in the present-day distribution of the species. Location The study site is a mire (1300 m a. s. l.) at Vega de Viejos, on a south-facing slope of the western Cantabrian Range, Spain. The region’s present-day landscape is almost treeless, with the exception of some patches of Quercus pyrenaica and a few copses of Salix and Betula along stream banks. Methods Tree macrofossils from Vega de Viejos were studied by transmitted light and dark-field reflection microscopy; strobili were subjected to comparative morphological analyses. Two Pinus macrofossils were dated by conventional 14 C methods. Results The taxonomic accuracy achieved in the identification of the macrofossils provided new information regarding the Holocene history of Pinus sylvestris in this territory. Ninety-five cones of this species were identified; in fact, more than 80 % of the 36 identified wood remains were of Pinus gr. sylvestris. Radiocarbon dating revealed that the forest to which the fossils belonged was present until at least 2170 ± 50 yr bp – its disappearance was therefore relatively recent. Main conclusions Pinus sylvestris suffered long-term isolation, and after the Wu¨rm glacial period tended to migrate towards the east. In western Iberia, a temperate climate and <b>autogenic</b> <b>succession</b> favoured broadleaved taxa at the expense of Pinus. Late Holocene human disturbances may have further accelerated the decline of P. sylvestris; in the Cantabrian Range, only a few stands on southern slopes have persisted until the present day. The history of the capercaillie (Tetrao urogallus), a bird characteristic of pure or mixed Palaeartic coniferous forests, was almost certainly affected by the demise of these forests in this area. Cantabrian capercaillies are the only members of this species that live in purely deciduous forests, perhaps a recent adaptation to the regional extinction of pines. Today’s P. sylvestris and capercaillie populations are now highly fragmented and their future, given the predictions of global climate change, is uncertain...|$|E
40|$|Dalby Söderskog is an old-growth {{temperate}} forest dominated by pedunculate oak (Querus robur), wych elm (Ulmus glabra), European ash (Fraxinus excelsior), and beech (Fagus sylvatica). After {{being released from}} a historical management regime of livestock grazing, <b>autogenic</b> <b>succession</b> began in the forest. This allowed for shade tolerant species to prevail. A steady state forest community dominated by elm was affected by Dutch elm disease (DED), while ash dieback negatively impacted on the ash population {{at the end of}} the 20 th century. In this study, we report on 95 years of secondary succession in Dalby Söderskog with emphasis on the effects of DED and ash dieback on forest compositional dynamics. Additionally, future trends in forest succession were discussed in response to changing environmental conditions. In 2012, an inventory of trees > 10 cm in diameter at breast height was carried out. This was done across 74 systematically distributed plots which were reconstructed from a survey of herb layer vegetation conducted in 2010. The results were compared with similar investigations completed in 1909, 1916, 1935 and 1970. The new inventory data representing species composition and forest structure were analyzed and discussed in relation to DED, ash dieback and oak decline. For each sample tree vitality was also recorded in order to explain compositional dynamics and succession trends. The results show that oak has been retreating from the stand for a long time, while elm is declining in abundance only recently after a period of dominance. Ash has become a dominant species in 2012 due to its ability to regenerate vigorously in gaps created where elms have fallen because of DED. However, a large amount of infected ash were observed in 2012. For beech, increased recruitment was found in Dalby Söderskog during the last sampling period. Despite dramatical changes in compositional dynamics, overall structural dynamics look more stable than species level diameter structure indicates. I conclude that oak will disappear in the long run if no actions are taken in the future, as historically its presence was a result of a wood pasture regime in Dalby Söderskog. DED had a significant impact on the tree species composition and will continue to affect young elm trees, resulting in an understory population with high turnover. Ash and beech will probably increase and maintain a dominant position in the canopy. Although, changes in composional dynamics occured, the forest still proved to be relatively resistant as an ecological system as seen in its consistency pertaining to structural dynamics...|$|E
40|$|Background. The {{study of}} {{long-term}} dynamics of reserves vegetation indicates {{the presence of}} the problems with biological diversity conservation in the protected areas. It emerged in the territories violated by the previous economic activity. The losses in the flora of vascular plants of the Voronezh State Reserve for the protected period were estimated, the reasons for the disappearance of species were identified. The aim of the work was to determine the necessity and the possibility of changing management strategies for conserving floristic diversity of the reserve. Materials and methods. The list of flora, created at the stage of nature reserve creation, included 922 species. 13 eco-cenotic groups are identified in the autochthonous flora Voronezh Reserve, all alien species are combined into a group of adventitious plants. To evaluate the floristic losses we made analysis of all floristic and geobotanical materials published and stored in the nature reserve, as well as the article author’s data obtained during the area survey in 1985 – 2016. To identify the factors and processes determining the dynamics of the flora, we used materials on the history of people activity before the reserve and during the protected period, as well as published research on the reserve vegetation dynamics. Results. The disappearance of 55 vascular plants species is established as a result of long-term monitoring of Voronezh State Reserve flora. 23 adventive species and 32 autochthonous species disappeared from the flora composition over 80 years of the Reserve existence. The most vulnerable from a position of floral diversity loss are light-loving species groups associated with waterlogging ecotopes (sphagnum-oligotrophic, swamp-grass and boreal groups), as well as dry pine forests and open habitats (pine forest group, psammophilous, dry-meadow-steppe and wet meadow groups). The reasons of floristic losses are: 1) <b>autogenic</b> <b>succession,</b> leading to the replacement of grass habitats by forest communities, to the increase of the nemoral species abundance and mesophytisation in all vegetation types, to soil fertility increase and to light decrease; 2) cyclic changes in the hydrological regime of the territory, accompanied by droughts; 3) naturalization of adventive plants in the Reserve plant communities. Conclusions. Analysis of the dynamics of Voronezh Reserve vegetation showed that the currently high floristic and cenotic diversity is kept on the landscape units of territory where autogenous succession was interrupted by exogenous influences. It was proposed to carry out grass cutting on the reserve meadows to save the open habitats. Fires and massive windfalls create a mosaic of habitats and favorable conditions for the existence of different types of plant communities, including meadow-pine forest communities with light-loving flora, but fires do not contribute to the conservation of rare species. A serious threat to the autochthonous flora and vegetation are alien species, this problem requires the development of a strategy and a set of measures to prevent the naturalization of alien species in protected areas. In the course of discussion there was made a proposal to modify the category of protected area for the Voronezh Reserve from I to IV (according to the IUCN classification). It will allow us to actively manage the protected forest area to conserve habitats and species...|$|E

The major findings of the study are as follows: • The colour of each reservoir, a surrogate measure of the concentration of dissolved humic substances and the main determinant of light penetration in the reservoirs, was dependent on annual retention time. • Similar to other tropical water bodies, the seasonal pattern of temperature and heat content in the reservoirs was controlled principally by net radiation (mainly short-wave radiation) and evaporative energy fluxes. • In most years, both reservoirs experienced two annual temperature and heat content minima and maxima. A single minimum and maximum was experienced when monsoon weather activity was brief, lasting just a few days or less. This contrasts with temperate water bodies, but is similar to most water {{bodies in the}} wet/dry tropics. • Although subject to the same regional climate, the mixing regimes of the study reservoirs differed. DRR is classified discontinuous polymictic, whilst MRR is classified monomictic. These differences are attributed to the different retention time and wind exposure of the reservoirs, and emphasise the role of local geographic and reservoir specific influences on mixis relative to regional climatic influences. • Both reservoirs experience long periods of thermal stratification with rates of hypolimnnetic deoxygenation greater than those measured in temperate water bodies. Such high rates were attributed principally to each reservoirs&# 039; warm hypolimnetic temperatures, whilst reservoir morphometry and trophic state were considered secondary. The use of hypolimnetic deoxygenation as an index of lake trophic status is not globally applicable due to its temperature dependence. • On an annual time scale, phytoplankton biomass of both reservoirs is phosphorus limited. This conclusion is reached based on an empirical relationship between average total phosphorus and chlorophyll a concentrations, and high total nitrogen to total phosphorus concentration ratios. During the wet season, wash-out in MRR is also likely to limit phytoplankton biomass. • The phosphorus-chlorophyll a relationship for the reservoirs predicted a higher average chlorophyll a concentration, for a total phosphorus concentrations of 10 µg 1 (- 1) &# 039;, compared to predictions based on temperate data sets. This difference was statistically significant for only two of the four temperate predictions. No conclusive evidence of a higher biomass of phytoplankton, per unit of limiting nutrient, was found. • The phytoplankton composition of the two reservoirs was dominated by an assemblage of Peridinium, Botryococcus braunii and Desmidaceae, though the relative dominance of each varied between the reservoirs. These populations were maintained during holomixis, which generally lasted a few days. Some holomictic events favoured the growth of Bacillariophyta (mainly Aulacoserira granulata), which were occasionally dominant in MRR. Unlike many higher latitude and some tropical water bodies, {{there was no evidence of}} an <b>autogenic</b> <b>succession,</b> from r-strategist to K-strategist phytoplankton, during thermal stratification. Both reservoirs were dominated by K-strategist phytoplankton throughout the year. • The study concludes the regional climate of a water body, whilst being an important determinant of reservoir limnology, is not the only influence. Other influences, specific to the water body such as retention time and wind-exposure, also have a profound influence. Such influences are probably more pronounced in the wet/dry tropics, due to the low stability of stratification of tropical water bodies compared with their higher latitude counterparts...|$|E
