With a funding agreement directly from the city, the councils share a pool of funds. The councils have significant land-use control, a voice in guiding development, and they organize residents. The boundaries are adjusted depending on population changes; as such, they sometimes overlap established neighborhoods. Though these neighborhoods changed overtime, preservationists have saved many of their historically significant structures.|$|E

5|$|Ashton town centre, {{which is}} the largest in Tameside, {{developed}} in the Victorian period. Many of the original buildings have survived, and as a result, the town centre is protected by Tameside Council as a conservation area. As well as being populated by leading high-street names, Ashton has an outdoor market which was established in the medieval period. It is made up of about 180stalls, and is open six days a week. The farmers' market, with over 70stalls, is the largest in the region, as is the weekday flea market. Ashton Market Hall underwent a £15M restoration after it was damaged by fire. The Ashton Renewal Area project has attracted investment in the town centre, encouraging conservation <b>and</b> <b>economic</b> <b>development.</b>|$|E
5|$|Besides {{being the}} capital city, Kota Kinabalu {{is also the}} main {{industrial}} and commercial centre for Sabah. The economy {{is dominated by the}} primary sector of industry. Historically, the secondary sector dominated the economy, but due to rapid urbanisation <b>and</b> <b>economic</b> <b>development,</b> this sector of the economy is slowly diminishing. More recently, a move towards a more tertiary-based industry has become more apparent, especially with regards to the boom in the tourism industry. Many state-level, national-level and international commercial banks, as well as some insurance companies have their headquarters or branches here. The overseas Chinese population also contributes to the development of KK since their immigration in the late 19th century. Their original role involved 'coolie' (slavery work) and today many Chinese work as shopowners.|$|E

5|$|People {{who kept}} more {{traditional}} ways had settlements along the Tamiami Trail {{and tended to}} speak the Mikasuki language. They later were federally recognized in 1962 as the Miccosukee Tribe of Indians of Florida. As metropolitan areas in South Florida began to grow, {{the two groups were}} closely associated with the Everglades. They struggled to maintain privacy while serving as tourist attractions. They earned money by wrestling alligators and selling craftworks. As of 2008, the Seminole Tribe of Florida had five reservations, and the lands of the Miccosukee Tribe of Indians were collectively considered a sixth reservation.

5|$|Strandzha Nature Park was {{established}} on 25 January 1995 to protect ecosystems and biodiversity, {{as well as}} the traditional cultural, historical and folklore heritage of the region.

The park is administered by a directorate based in Malko Tarnovo and subordinated to the Executive Forest Agency of the Ministry of Environment and Water of Bulgaria. The directorate implements the state policy for the management and control of the protected area, aiming at the long-term conservation of the unique nature and ensuring the sustainable social <b>and</b> <b>economic</b> <b>development</b> of the region. It monitors the management and conservation of the forests, game, and fish resources while encouraging tourism and environmental protection.|$|E
5|$|The Empathic Civilization: The Race to Global Consciousness in a World in Crisis is a 2010 non-fiction {{book written}} by Jeremy Rifkin. It connects the {{evolution}} of communication and energy development in civilizations with psychological <b>and</b> <b>economic</b> <b>development</b> in humans. Rifkin considers the latest phase of communication and energy regimes—that of electronic telecommunications and fossil fuel extraction—as bringing people together on the nation-state level based on democratic capitalism, {{but at the same}} time creating global problems, like climate change, pandemics, and nuclear proliferation. Rifkin extrapolates the observed trend into the future, predicting that Internet and mobile technology along with small-scale renewable energy commercialization will create an era of distributed capitalism necessary to manage the new energy regime and a heightened global empathy that can help solve global problems.|$|E

Nunn's budget focused on increased funding for education, mental health, <b>and</b> <b>economic</b> <b>development.</b> In the 1970 legislative session, the General Assembly enacted Nunn's proposals to eliminate taxes on prescription drugs and the use fee charged on vehicles transferred within families, but rejected his plans to reduce the income tax for low-income families and increase tax credits for the blind and the elderly.|$|E

5|$|The {{indigenous}} peoples of Taiwan face {{economic and social}} barriers, including a high unemployment rate and substandard education. Since the early 1980s, many aboriginal groups have been actively seeking {{a higher degree of}} political self-determination <b>and</b> <b>economic</b> <b>development.</b> The revival of ethnic pride is expressed in many ways by aborigines, including the incorporation of elements of their culture into commercially successful pop music. Efforts are under way in indigenous communities to revive traditional cultural practices and preserve their traditional languages. The Austronesian Cultural Festival in Taitung City is one means by which community members promote aboriginal culture. In addition, several aboriginal communities have become extensively involved in the tourism and ecotourism industries with the goal of achieving increased economic self-reliance and preserving their culture.|$|E
