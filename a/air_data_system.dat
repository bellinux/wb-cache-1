The aircraft is equipped with AMAGB gearbox, which is designed and produced by CVRDE. The castings are made of magnesium alloy and the gearbox has its own self-contained lubrication system. AMAGB operates in two modes. In the starter mode, it aids in starting the engine through jet fuel starter. In accessory mode, it drives two hydraulic pumps and an integrated drive generator.

40|$|An {{experimental}} multisegmented telescoping nose boom {{has been}} installed on an F- 15 B airplane {{to be tested}} in a flight environment. The experimental nose boom is representative of one {{that could be used}} to tailor the sonic boom signature of an airplane such as a supersonic business jet. The nose boom consists of multiple sections and could be extended during flight to a length of 24 ft. The preliminary analyses indicate that the addition of the experimental nose boom could adversely affect vehicle flight characteristics and <b>air</b> <b>data</b> <b>systems.</b> Before the boom was added, a series of flights was conducted to update the aerodynamic model and characterize the <b>air</b> <b>data</b> <b>systems</b> of the baseline airplane. The baseline results have been used in conjunction with estimates of the nose boom's influence to prepare for a series of research flights conducted with the nose boom installed. Data from these flights indicate that the presence of the experimental boom reduced the static pitch and yaw stability of the airplane. The boom also adversely affected the static-position error of the airplane but did not significantly affect angle-of-attack or angle-of-sideslip measurements.

40|$|Flush <b>air</b> <b>data</b> sensing <b>systems</b> {{have been}} widely applied to large (manned) aircraft, where {{pressure}} orifices are typically located at the nosetip. This paper investigates the feasibility of a flush <b>air</b> <b>data</b> sensing <b>system</b> designed to estimate the <b>air</b> <b>data</b> states of a small unmanned air vehicle flown at speeds as low as Mach 0. 07. Furthermore, due {{to the presence of}} a nose propeller, the pressure orifices are located at the wing leading edge. The motivation behind this project is the fact that traditional <b>air</b> <b>data</b> booms are physically impractical for small unmanned air vehicles. Overall, an 80 and 97 % reduction in instrumentation weight and cost, respectively, were achieved. Both parametric and multilayer perceptron neural network models have been previously applied in the literature to model the aerodynamic relationship between aircraft surface pressure and the <b>air</b> <b>data</b> states. In this paper, an extended minimum resource allocating network radial basis function neural network is used as the flush <b>air</b> <b>data</b> sensing <b>system</b> model, due to its good generalization capabilities and compact structure. Computational fluid dynamic simulations are implemented to identify the ideal pressure port locations, and wind-tunnel tests are carried out to train and test the extended minimum resource allocating network radial basis function neural network...|$|R

40|$|The use of {{computational}} {{fluid dynamics}} simulations for calibrating a flush <b>air</b> <b>data</b> <b>system</b> is described, In particular, the flush <b>air</b> <b>data</b> <b>system</b> of the HYFLEX hypersonic vehicle {{is used as a}} case study. The HYFLEX <b>air</b> <b>data</b> <b>system</b> consists of nine pressure ports located flush with the vehicle nose surface, connected to onboard pressure transducers, After appropriate processing, surface pressure measurements can he converted into useful air data parameters. The processing algorithm requires an accurate pressure model, which relates air data parameters to the measured pressures. In the past, such pressure models have been calibrated using combinations of flight data, ground-based experimental results, and numerical simulation. We perform a calibration of the HYFLEX flush <b>air</b> <b>data</b> <b>system</b> using {{computational fluid dynamics}} simulations exclusively, The simulations are used to build an empirical pressure model that accurately describes the HYFLEX nose pressure distribution ol cr a range of flight conditions. We believe that computational fluid dynamics provides a quick and inexpensive way to calibrate the <b>air</b> <b>data</b> <b>system</b> and is applicable to a broad range of flight conditions, When tested with HYFLEX flight data, the calibrated system is found to work well. It predicts vehicle angle of attack and angle of sideslip to accuracy levels that generally satisfy flight control requirements.
