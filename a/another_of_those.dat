I think he would have been big if he'd been straightened out {{at the beginning of his}} career," [...] comments Phil Solomon about Morrison. [...] "He was on a downer and he was drinking. He wasn't the most bankable of artists. He had been the frontman for <b>another</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> R & B bands that had gone up the Swanee and there were three or four versions of Them touring. It was a joke. He was no gift. There weren't record companies falling over themselves to sign him up." [...] says Phil Coulter in the book.|$|E

500|$|Committee on the Five Civilized Tribes of Indians, Sixty-sixth Congress (1919–1921). [...] The Five Civilized Tribes is a {{term that}} {{historically}} {{was applied to the}} Cherokee, Chickasaw, Choctaw, Creek, and Seminole. [...] All had a significant presence in Oklahoma. [...] Owen was the last chairman of the committee, which was <b>another</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> wound up in 1921. [...] Owen paid consistent attention throughout his time in the Senate to issues that affected Indian groups (both these five tribes and others), and was actively involved in debates over Indian land rights (see Other issues below) and Indian mineral rights cases, as well as disputes over membership in different Indian nations. [...] It is not, however, clear that he made any special use of his chairmanship to promote significant new initiatives.|$|E
500|$|Shortly {{after leaving}} Oxford University in 1995, Beckinsale starred in Cold Comfort Farm as Flora Poste, a newly {{orphaned}} 1930s socialite sent {{to live with}} distant family members in rural England. The John Schlesinger-directed film was an adaptation of Stella Gibbons's novel and also featured Joanna Lumley, Eileen Atkins, Ian McKellen, Rufus Sewell and Stephen Fry. Beckinsale was initially considered too young, but was cast after she wrote a pleading letter to the director. Emanuel Levy of Variety was reminded of [...] "the strength of a young Glenda Jackson and the charm of a young Julie Christie." [...] Kevin Thomas of the Los Angeles Times classed the actress as [...] "yet <b>another</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> effortlessly skilled British beauties who light up the screen." [...] Janet Maslin of The New York Times felt she played the role [...] "with the perfect snippy aplomb." [...] The film grossed over $5 million at the US box office. Also in 1995, she appeared in Haunted, a ghost story in which Derek Elley of Variety felt she [...] "holds the screen, with both physical looks and verbal poise." [...] 1995 also saw Beckinsale's first professional stage appearance as Nina in The Seagull at Theatre Royal, Bath. She became romantically involved with co-star Michael Sheen after meeting during play rehearsals. [...] "He was the young lion of the theatre." [...] "I was all revved up to feel very intimidated. It was my first-ever play and my mother had cut out reviews of him in previous productions. And then he walked in ... It was almost like, 'God, well, I'm finished now. That's it, then.'... He's the most outrageously talented person I've ever met." [...] Irving Wardle of The Independent felt that [...] "the casting, including Michael Sheen's volcanic Kostya and Kate Beckinsale's steadily freezing Nina, is mainly spot-on." [...] In early 1996, she starred in two further plays; Sweetheart at the Royal Court Theatre and Clocks and Whistles at the Bush Theatre.|$|E

Reviewing for The Stage, John Thaxter wrote: [...] "Sumptuously illustrated, at first sight it looks like <b>another</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> photo albums of the stars. But between the pictures there are almost 200 pages of densely printed text, an unusually frank story of her private and professional life, mainly in the theatre, the words clearly Mirren's own, delivered with forthright candour." ...|$|E

Michael Kimmelman of The New York Times saw [...] "one last, pathetic gasp of the sort of self-promoting hype and sensationalism that characterized the worst of the 1980s" [...] and called Koons' work [...] "artificial", [...] "cheap", and [...] "unabashedly cynical".|$|E
2500|$|In March 1975 Helms {{learned the}} Shah alone had {{negotiated}} a major agreement with Saddam Hussein of Iraq while in Algiers at an OPEC meeting. There the Algerian {{head of state}} Houari Boumedienne had translated the Shah's French into Arabic for the negotiation. As part of the deal, the Shah had disowned, quit {{his support for the}} Kurdish struggle in Iraq. The resulting treaty was evidently a surprise to the Shah's own ministers, as well as to Helms and the USG. As a result, the CIA also abandoned the Kurds, whose struggling people became <b>another</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> stateless nations who would remember with [...] "regret and bitterness" [...] their dealings with the Agency.|$|E

Tanner said that at first he had thought Skills would become an {{important}} character, but later had come to doubt it. [...] "My character was originally on the thing as recurring, possible series regular, and I was told that once we got picked up my character would become a series regular", he said. [...] "Then when I didn't and the show went in a different direction, I was kind of like, 'Uh-oh.' I didn't think the fans took to him at first, so I thought maybe that's why the studio did it like that. But now he's doing his thing, so I ain't mad at it. They need to write me in more!" ...|$|E

2500|$|Previous {{military}} operations had been launched from the Kingdom of Laos against the Trail during 1969 and 1970. Operation Maeng Da was <b>another</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> operations designed {{to influence the}} course of the Vietnam War by attacking the crucial North Vietnamese communist supply line. It also served as a test of the Central Intelligence Agency-sponsored Mobile 1 battalion that had been raised for service beyond its parent Military Region 3 (MR 3). Mobile 1 was a new battalion of 550 men. Battalions raised for service within MR3 consisted of 300 soldiers. Other Military Regions in Laos had felt cheated by being reinforced with the understrength battalions. In response, the CIA had reluctantly trained Mobile 1. The CIA trainers were contemptuous of their urban recruits; their disdain was reflected by the fact that a Lao slang meaning of the term [...] "maeng da" [...] is [...] "pimp".|$|E
2500|$|Subsequent reviews, written after Gilbert and Sullivan had {{renamed the}} show and made other changes, were {{generally}} more favourable. [...] A week after the premiere, the Illustrated London News praised the work, the actors and both Gilbert and, especially, Sullivan: [...] "Sir Arthur Sullivan has eminently succeeded alike in the expression of refined sentiment and comic humour. [...] In the former respect, the charm of graceful melody prevails; while, in the latter, {{the music of the}} most grotesque situations is redolent of fun." [...] On 1 February 1887, The Theatre wrote, [...] "There {{can be no doubt that}} by its admirable production of Messrs. Gilbert and Sullivan's latest work the Savoy management has scored <b>another</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> shining and remunerative successes that its enterprise, intelligence, and good taste have repeatedly achieved – and merited." [...] A week later, The Academy reckoned that Ruddygore (as it was still called in the review) was probably not so good as Patience or The Mikado, nor as [...] "fresh" [...] as H.M.S. Pinafore, but [...] "it is better than ... Princess Ida, the Pirates, and Iolanthe". [...] The Musical Times called the work [...] "one of the most brilliant examples which the associated art of Messrs. Gilbert and Sullivan has brought into existence," [...] and said that Sullivan had [...] "written some of his freshest and most delightful melodies." [...] However, in the view of The Manchester Guardian, reviewing the Manchester premiere in March 1887, [...] "The weakness of his central idea has led Mr Gilbert into extravagance without wit and parody without point." ...|$|E
