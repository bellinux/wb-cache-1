40|$|Among the {{two types}} of engine cooling, {{liquid-cooling}} and air-cooling, liquid cooling is widely used due to its capability to reject a larger amount of heat and air-cooling is preferred for small capacity engines in which cooling systems are much simpler in design and low in cost. In practice, piston-seize in air-cooled engines is common during long hours of operation or at higher engine speeds. The current work proposes mist cooling as a way to overcome this problem. A feasibility study is conducted where the temperature distribution in an array of plate fins, similar to fins on an engine cylinder head, is measured. The fins are subjected to constant heat flux at the base and cooled by airflow, simulating actual conditions on a cylinder head. Experiments were conducted for several air velocities ranging from 21. 5 m/s to 40. 4 m/s. The temperature distribution in the fin was measured at several locations simultaneously to calculate the amount of heat being transferred.

40|$|Mixed-mode ” {{refers to}} a hybrid {{approach}} to space conditioning that uses a combination of natural ventilation from operable windows (either manually or automatically controlled), and mechanical systems that provide air distribution and some form of cooling (air-conditioning, radiant cooling, etc.). By utilizing mechanical cooling only when {{and where it is}} necessary to supplement the natural ventilation, a well-designed mixed-mode building offers the potential to improve the indoor environmental quality while minimizing the significant energy and operating costs of air-conditioning. But there is limited information about the performance of mixed-mode buildings, particularly with regard to occupant satisfaction, and this can potentially be a powerful part of the argument to avoid or minimize the use of air-conditioning. This paper describes the results of web-based surveys conducted in 12 mixed-mode buildings, in comparison to our overall benchmarking survey database of 370 buildings, with over 43, 000 individual responses. The survey focuses on seven areas of indoor environmental performance, including thermal comfort, air quality, acoustics, lighting, cleanliness, spatial layout, and office furnishings.

40|$|Paper {{presented}} at the 5 th International Conference on Heat Transfer, Fluid Mechanics and Thermodynamics, South Africa, 1 - 4 July, 2007. In-tube condensation is quite common in refrigeration and air-conditioning applications. It is the binding choice for air-cooled and evaporative condensers. In-tube condensation is often {{thought of as a}} process of film-wise condensation of a vapor inside a tube. Since augmentation can result in smaller and more efficient devices, potential savings are quite substantial. An experimental program designed to investigate potential augmentation techniques has been carried out worldwide as part of a large study of in-tube condensation. Copper circular smooth or enhanced tubes with plate aluminum fins on the air side (fin-and-tube heat Exchangers) are the usual geometry in aircooled condensers. Enhanced tubes such as micro fin tubes are typically made of copper and have an outside diameter from 4 to 15 mm, a single set of 50 - 70 fins with helix angle from 6 to 30 °, fin height from 0. 1 to 0. 25 mm, triangular or trapezoidal fin shapes with an apex angle from 25 to 90 °. Air-cooled condensers operate at a greater condensing temperature than water-cooled condensers; hence the compressor (and the refrigeration system) delivers 15 to 20 % lower capacity. Therefore one has to use a larger compressor. At the same time, the compressor consumes greater power. Hence the <b>air-cooled</b> <b>system</b> has a lower overall energy efficiency. This paper manly emphasis on increase in overall performance of the air-cooled condenser. The objective {{of this study is to}} analyze the theoretical performance of air-cooled condensers using micro-fin tubes.

The overall performance of condenser for different refrigerants has also been studied. The refrigerants used for study are R- 134 a, R- 404 a and R- 22. The performance of condenser is analyzed for 550 C condensing temperature because most of the air cooled condensers in India are working on this condensing temperature. The % saving in fan power is estimated upto 90 %with the use of micro-fin tubes, 29 % reduction in compressor power; and 17 % increase in cooling capacity, on the other hand the % reduction in size of condenser is up to 32 %.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{focuses on}} the feasibility, crystallization issues, and the integration of LiBr-H 2 O air-cooled absorption chillers into Cooling, Heating and Power (CHP) systems. The concept of an <b>air-cooled</b> <b>system</b> is attractive because the cooling tower and the associated installation and maintenance issues can be avoided. However, crystallization of the LiBr-H 2 O solution then becomes the main issue {{in the operation of}} the unit, since the air-cooled absorber tends to operate hotter than the water-cooled absorber due to the relative heat transfer characteristics of the coolant leading to crystallization of the working fluid. Differently from the conventional approaches to air-cooled absorption chillers, novel temperature control strategies in conjunction with a specialized application is proposed. This prevents crystallization but presents unique system integration challenges and opportunities. A model to accurately reflect the thermodynamic characteristics of air-cooled absorption chillers and to facilitate control is developed as part of this research, and field experiments that simulate air-cooled conditions with a water-cooled absorption chiller, which was driven by the waste heat of a microturbine, were conducted to validate the feasibility of the air-cooled concept and the accuracy of computer model. While CHP provides a good opportunity for the application of air-cooled absorption chillers, system integration issues need to be investigated. The capital cost of CHP equipment and the load fluctuation of a commercial building restrict the advantage of designing a unit sized for peak load. Therefore, the conventional Heating Ventilation and Air Conditioning (HVAC) system is needed to pick up the residual loads. Thus, the result of an extensive system integration analysis is that CHP should be arranged in series with the HVAC system to ensure obtaining more operating hours at its full capacity, so that the cost savings achieved through the recovery of waste heat are fully realized to repay its higher initial capital cost. The primary energy savings are presented for all potential configurations. As a part of this research a fully integrated CHP system has been installed and instrumented at the Chesapeake Building. It is a commercial office building on the University of Maryland campus. The experimental setup, data processing, and experience gained are detailed here. Based on the computer simulation, extensive experiments, first hand installation, operation and maintenance experience, valuable guidelines on the integration of an air-cooled absorption chiller in CHP are developed.

Currently, many thermoelectric power plants use wet-cooled condenser technology, which tends to lose water to evaporation or thermally pollute the water such that it is unfit to return to its source. An alternate method for the steam condensation process is to use dry-cooled technologies where air is the cooling fluid. These <b>air-cooled</b> <b>systems</b> are beneficial where water is unavailable or uneconomical. However, dry-cooled systems do not perform as well and are not as economical as wet-cooled systems.
