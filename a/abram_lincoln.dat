5|$|<b>Abram</b> <b>Lincoln</b> Harris, Jr. (January 17, 1899 â€“ November 6, 1963) was an American economist, academic, {{anthropologist}} and {{a social}} critic {{of blacks in the}} United States. Considered by many as the first African American to achieve prominence in the field of economics, Harris was also known for his heavy influence on black radical and neo-conservative thought in the United States. As an economist, Harris is most famous for his 1931 collaboration with political scientist Sterling Spero to produce a study on African-American labor history titled The Black Worker and his 1936 work The Negro as Capitalist, in which he criticized black businessmen for not promoting interracial trade. He headed the economics department at Howard University from 1936 to 1945 and taught at the University of Chicago from then until his death. As a social critic, Harris took an active radical stance on racial relations by examining historical black involvement in the workplace, and suggested that African Americans needed to take more action in race relations.|$|E

5000|$|Settler George Green {{founded the}} town of Lincoln in 1870, naming it after the county. [...] "Center" [...] was added to its name to {{indicate}} its location in {{the central part of}} the county. County residents initially voted to place the county seat in Lincoln Center. However, elections in November 1870 resulted in the seat relocating to nearby Abram, sparking a county seat war. Another vote in February 1872 reversed the switch, and Lincoln Center became the permanent county seat. In addition, residents relocated all the buildings in <b>Abram</b> to <b>Lincoln,</b> merging the two communities. [...] The town was incorporated as the city of Lincoln Center in 1879, and is still officially referred to as such in the United States Census. [...] However, both the city government and local chamber of commerce refer to the city as Lincoln, and it appears as such on state maps and signs.|$|R
