40|$|BACKGROUND: An inverse {{association}} between <b>alcoholic</b> beverage <b>intake</b> {{and risk of}} renal cell cancer has been suggested in recent studies. METHODS: We examined the {{association between}} alcoholic beverages and renal cell cancer risk in a meta-analysis. We identified relevant studies by searching the database of PubMed, EMBASE, and MEDLINE published through August 2011. We combined the study-specific relative risks (RRs) using a random-effects model. RESULTS: A total of 20 case–control studies, 3 cohort studies, and 1 pooled analysis of cohort studies {{were included in the}} meta-analysis. We observed that <b>alcoholic</b> beverage <b>intake</b> was associated with a lower risk of renal cell cancer in combined analysis of case–control and cohort studies; for total <b>alcoholic</b> beverage <b>intake,</b> combined RRs (95 % confidence intervals) comparing top with bottom categories were 0. 76 (0. 68 – 0. 85) in case–control studies, and 0. 71 (0. 63 – 0. 78) in cohort studies (P for difference by study design 0. 02). The inverse associations were observed {{for both men and women}} and for each specific type alcoholic beverage (beer, wine, and liquor). Also, we found that one drink per day of alcoholic beverage conferred the reduction in renal cell cancer risk, but further drinking above that level did not add benefit. CONCLUSION: The findings from our meta-analysis support the hypothesis that <b>alcoholic</b> beverage <b>intake</b> is inversely associated with a lower risk of renal cell cancer, with moderate consumption conferring the protection and higher consumption conferring no additional benefits...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background: Groove {{pancreatitis}} (GP) {{is a rare}} condition {{characterized by}} inflammatory fibrosis of {{the space between the}} dorsal-cranial part of the head of the pancreas, duodenum and common bile duct. Surgery is often the choice of treatment. Case report: A 44 -year-old male patient with a history of a high <b>alcoholic</b> <b>intake</b> came with epigastric pain associated with a weight loss. An abdominal ultrasonography, a computer tomography (CT) and a gastro-duodenoscopy showed a mass of the pancreatic head with duodenal infiltration suggesting for adenocarcinoma of the pancreas. An endoscopic ultrasound- fine needle aspiration (EUS-FNA) did not show any sign of chronic inflammation. The patient underwent Whipple procedure. Histologic examination confirmed chronic inflammation in the groove area with a ruptured pancreatic-type cyst and some pseudocysts in depth of the wall. Conclusion: The diagnosis of GP is challenging. Radiological and endoscopic findings and symptoms are often not specific and they could also be present in patients with adenocarcinoma of the pancreas. The pancreaticoduodenectomy is often the choice of treatment when symptoms do not improve or when there is uncertainty over the diagnosis...|$|E
40|$|The “J shape” curve {{linking the}} risk of poor bone health to alcohol intake is now well {{recognized}} from epidemiological studies. Ethanol and nonethanol components of alcoholic beverages could influence bone remodeling. However, {{in the absence of}} a solid underlying mechanism, the positive association between moderate <b>alcoholic</b> <b>intake</b> and BMD remains questionable because of confounding associated social factors. The objective of this work was to characterize the short-term effects of moderate alcohol consumption on circulating bone markers, especially those involved in bone resorption. Two sequential blood-sampling studies were undertaken in fasted healthy volunteers (age, 20 – 47 yr) over a 6 -h period using beer of different alcohol levels (2 % ethanol; p ≤ 0. 01, RM-ANOVA), 0. 6 liters of beer (6 h). The early effect on bone resorption is well described after the intake of energy, mediated by glucagon-like peptide- 2, but the late effect of moderate alcohol ingestion is novel, seems to be ethanol specific, and is mediated in a non–calcitonin- and a non–PTH-dependent fashion, thus providing a mechanism for the positive association between moderate alcohol ingestion and BMD...|$|E

METHODS: Retrospective {{analysis of the}} patients admitted owing to bleeding peptic ulcers from 1998 to 2001. Vital signs upon admission, associated diseases, endoscopy data, evolution and definitive care were evaluated. Patients who underwent surgery were compared with the others {{in order to identify}} the predictors of the operative treatment. Student's t and chi squared test were employed for statistical analysis, considering p< 0, 05 as significant. RESULTS: Two hundred patients were included in the study group. The age ranged between 17 and 97 years (mean 52 + 18), and 153 patients (76. 5 %) were male. Shock upon admission was present in 27 (13. 5 %). The endoscopic exam performed at admission showed that 101 patients sustained ulcers in the duodenum and 99 in the stomach, which were classified as Forrest Ia in 5 (2. 5 %), Ib in 20 (10 %), IIa in 48 (24 %) and IIb in 48 (24 %). Twenty five (12. 5 %) patients needed operation, and 23 (92 %) were submitted to gastrectomy with Billroth's II reconstruction.

40|$|This paper {{suggests}} {{that each of}} these expectations has played an important role. In the 1990 s, the decline in alcohol consumption across the developed part of the world was outstripped by a rise in total <b>alcoholic</b> <b>intake</b> in most developing nations, to the extent that total world demand increased by over 10 %. Not so for wine consumption which kept falling in the 1990 s, as it had done ever since its peak in the late 1970 s, {{at an annual rate of}} 1. 3 %. The trade numbers suggest, amongst other things, that the EU share of internal trade is diminishing (from 92 % in 1990 - 92 to 85 % in 1995 - 97, in value terms) along with its share of world exports (current EU 15 members would have made up 69 % of the reported value of trade in the early 1990 s and only 63 % five years later), thereby bringing the proportion of world trade imputable to purely internal EU trade to drop from 63 % to 53 % (i. e. some 10 percentage points below levels enjoyed at the beginning of the decade, to represent just over half world exchanges in the mid-to-late 1990 s).

40|$|Animal {{experiments}} {{demonstrate that}} the incidence of nutritional cirrhosis in rats can be reduced by dietary fats of shorter carbon chain length (1). It has been shown that the composition of the liver lipids in rats (2) and in drinking alcoholics is determined in part by the chain length of exogenous fatty acids (3). However, the role of dietary lipids in the pathogenesis of alcoholic cirrhosis is un-known. The present study is designed to evaluate whether or not the fatty acid composition of liver lipids in alcoholic patients without cir-rhosis is different from alcoholics with cirrho-sis, and secondly, to study the effect of me-dium-chain triglycerides (MCT) on liver lipid composition and liver functions in these pa-tients. Material and methods Twenty-nine patients, 4 females and 25 males, were selected for study. All had a history of heavy <b>alcoholic</b> <b>intake</b> for at least 10 years. The subjects were divided into two groups, those with and those without cirrhosis, on the basis of clinical and labo-ratory findings, including liver biopsy. The average patient age for the cirrhotics was 49, whereas the noncirrhotics averaged 45 years. All patients were admitted to the Metabolic Wand and given a standard hospital diet (long-chain triglycerides, LCT diet). Then, within 1 week after alcohol withdrawal, the patients were ran-domly assigned to either continuation of the same (LCT) hospital diet or an MCT diet. Both diets were isocaloric (2, 000 kcal).

40|$|A {{combined}} prospective-retrospective hospital {{study for}} the etiological spectrum of non-hepatomatous liver cirrhosis in the Chinese in Hong Kong was performed on a total of 731 patients. In the prospective part, the three commonest causes of liver cirrhosis in the population {{were found to be}} chronic active type-B hepatitis, alcoholic liver disease and cryptogenic cirrhosis. In the retrospective analysis, before tests for HBsAg were available, the commonest cause was cryptogenic cirrhosis. Of 60 patients who had previously been so diagnosed and were re-studied prospectively later, 50 were found to have chronic active type-B hepatitis. The frequency of this disease showed no sign of falling between the years 1962 and 1976. Alcoholic liver disease was increasingly more common (χn 2 = 14. 3, p, 0. 001). The rising frequency of alcoholic cirrhosis between 1962 and 1976 approximated the average per capita expenditure on alcoholic drink in the community during the same period. Although there was an increasing tendency to take Western liquors, consumers of Chinese wines currently still accounted for 75 % of those who had steady <b>alcoholic</b> <b>intake.</b> Haemochromatosis was the cause of cirrhosis in only one out of the 731 patients. We concluded: (1) that hepatitis B virus infection was the most important cause of liver cirrhosis in the Chinese in Hong Kong, and this importance was undiminished over the last 15 yr, (2) that alcoholism was an increasingly important cause of liver cirrhosis in our increasingly affluent and 'Westernised' society, and (3) that the majority of patients previously labelled as having 'cryptogenic' postnecrotic cirrhosis were suffering from hepatitis B virus infection and, therefore, former metabolic data on liver cirrhosis published from this Department dominantly applied to HBsAg-positive cirrhosis. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E

Methods: A total of 35 healthy controls without alcohol consumption and 94 patients with alcoholic liver disease (17 with alcoholic steatosis, 37 with alcoholic hepatitis, 40 with alcoholic cirrhosis) were included. Their serum IL- 12 levels were measured and followed-up at the 3 rd, 6 th and 9 th months. Data were further analyzed according to abstinence from alcohol or not. Results: Mean serum IL- 12 levels {{were higher in the}} alcoholic hepatitis group (163. 1 ± 57. 8 pg/mL) than in the alcoholic liver cirrhosis group (110. 5 ± 41. 6 pg/mL) and alcoholic steatosis group (74. 4 ± 26. 2 pg/mL). All of these 3 alcoholic groups had higher serum IL- 12 levels than the control group (39. 3 ± 8. 3 pg/mL; p < 0. 02). Among the patients who abstained from alcohol, {{there was no difference in}} serum IL- 12 levels between control and steatosis patients at the 9 th month, but the serum IL- 12 levels of the hepatitis and cirrhosis groups were still higher than in the control group (p < 0. 001 and p = 0. 001, respectively). In addition, the patients who continued to drink alcohol had higher serum IL- 12 levels than those who abstained from alcohol in the steatosis, hepatitis and cirrhosis groups.

40|$|Background: Moderate alcohol {{consumption}} {{has been shown}} to protect against cardiovascular disease. Aortic stiffness can be regarded as a marker of cardiovascular disease risk. Previously we have shown an inverse to J-shaped association between alcohol intake and aortic stiffness in middle-aged and elderly men and postmenopausal women. Objective: In the present study we examined whether a relation between alcohol intake and aortic stiffness is already present at a younger age. Design: Cross-sectional data of a cohort study in men and women aged 28 years were analysed stratified by gender (240 men and 283 women). Measurements: Alcohol intake was derived from a questionnaire and aortic stiffness was assessed by pulse-wave velocity measurement. Results: In women an <b>alcoholic</b> beverage <b>intake</b> of ≥ 1 glass/day is associated with a 0. 36 m/s (95 % confidence interval, - 0. 58 to - 0. 14) lower pulse-wave velocity compared with non-drinkers. In men alcohol intake is also inversely related to pulse-wave velocity, but this was not significant. These findings were independent of age, blood pressure and heart rate. Conclusions: These findings suggest that moderate intake of alcohol may affect vascular stiffness at an early age, notably in women. These findings may be viewed as compatible with a vascular protective effect of alcohol that expresses well before the occurrence of symptomatic cardiovascular disease. © 2005 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins...|$|R

40|$|INTRODUÇÃO: Esteatose ocorre com freqüência na hepatite crônica pelo vírus C (HCV) e parece estar relacionada a fatores clínicos e/ou virológicos. Contudo, a presença de esteato-hepatite, uma condição indutora de fibrose, tem sido pouco estudada. OBJETIVO: Estudar a associação de HCV com esteato-hepatite em {{material}} de biópsia hepática, correlacionando-a com dados clínicos. MÉTODOS: As biópsias hepáticas de pacientes com HCV foram avaliadas quanto a atividade, estádio e presença de alterações morfológicas de esteato-hepatite. Os dados morfológicos foram correlacionados a parâmetros clínicos que incluíam: consumo alcoólico, IMC, colesterol, triglicérides, glicemia, exposição a petroquímicos e genótipo viral. RESULTADOS: Esteato-hepatite foi encontrada em 42 de 252 (16, 6 %) pacientes com HCV. Entre os 42 casos, critérios para obesidade, diabetes e dislipidemia foram encontrados em 16, 7 %; 16, 7 % e 21, 4 %, respectivamente. O genótipo 3 esteve presente em 38, 1 % dos casos. Fatores de risco para esteato-hepatite não-alcoólica (NASH) foram encontrados em 73 % dos casos em genótipos diferentes do 3, enquanto tais fatores foram presentes em 37, 5 % dos casos com genótipo 3 (p = 0, 05). O padrão morfológico mais freqüente foi a esteatose macrovacuolar de moderada intensidade (61, 9 %) com distribuição difusa (64, 3 %). Tanto o padrão de fibrose de NASH quanto o de HCV foram notados: fibrose perissinusoidal (87, 8 %), portal (87, 8 %), septal (69, 0 %) e cirrose (30, 9 %). CONCLUSÕES: Esteato-hepatite é freqüente em pacientes com HCV, apresentando padrão peculiar de distribuição da esteatose e alta freqüência de cirrose. Em genótipos diferentes do 3, a esteato-hepatite parece estar relacionada à sobreposição de fatores de risco para NASH. INTRODUCTION: Steatohepatitis and hepatitis C virus (HCV) {{have been}} related to several clinical and virological factors and fibrosis progression. OBJECTIVE: To describe clinical and morphological aspects of steatohepatitis associated to HCV. METHODS: The study included patients with HCV without treatment.

Clinical parameters included <b>alcoholic</b> <b>intake</b> history and determination of risk factors for non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). RESULTS: Steatohepatitis was observed in 42 out of 252 patients (16. 6 %) with HCV, and 76. 2 % were male. Risk factors for NASH were present in 37. 5 % of the patients with genotype 3 and in 73 % of the patients with other genotypes (p = 0. 05). Obesity was present in 16. 7 %, diabetes in 16. 7 %, hyperlipidemia in 21. 4 %, and genotype 3 in 38. 1 %. Macrovacuolar steatosis presented mild intensity in 61. 9 % and was diffuse in 64. 3 %. Cirrhosis was present in 33. 3 % of the patients. CONCLUSIONS: Diffuse steatosis and ballooning of mild to moderate intensity characterized steatohepatitis related to HCV. Patients with genotype different from genotype 3 presented with known risk factors for NASH, whereas most of the patients with genotype 3 had only viral genotype as risk factor for steatosis. The frequency of cirrhosis was relevant and suggests that the association of steatohepatitis with HCV contribute to fibrosis progression...|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} {{aimed to}} provide the first assessment of the contribution of alcohol to Australian adults’ diets over time and determine if people reporting alcohol had higher total dietary energy intakes. Secondary analyses of cross-sectional national nutrition surveys from 1983, 1995, and 2011 / 12 for adults 18 years (n = 26, 675) and over were conducted. <b>Alcoholic</b> beverage <b>intake</b> and diet were assessed using 24 -h recalls. The proportion of participants reporting alcohol consumption declined over time and in 1983, 1995, and 2011 / 12 was 52. 0 %, 44. 2 %, and 39. 8 %, respectively, for men (p < 0. 001) and 31. 6 %, 25. 7 %, and 25. 7 %, respectively, for women (p < 0. 001). A decline in alcohol intake was seen between 1983 and 2012 for all subpopulations, except for women aged over 45 years, for whom alcohol intake increased. Energy intake was higher for participants reporting alcohol intake and the mean difference (SD) in energy intake for those reporting alcohol versus non-consumers was + 1514 kJ (462) for men and + 1227 kJ (424) for women. Consistent with apparent consumption data, reported alcohol intake for the total population decreased over time. As those reporting alcohol had much higher energy intakes than non-consumers, promoting alcohol intakes consistent with national recommendations may {{have important implications for}} the prevention of obesity, particularly for middle-aged women...|$|R
40|$|This study {{aimed to}} {{determine}} the knowledge and prevalence of obesity among Ghanaian newly diagnosed type 2 diabetics. This cross-sectional study was conducted among diagnosed type 2 diabetics. Structured questionnaire was used to obtain data. Anthropometric measurements and fasting blood sugar levels were also assessed. Participants had adequate knowledge about the general concept of obesity (72. 0 %) and method of weight measurement (98. 6 %) but were less knowledgeable of ideal body weight (4. 2 %). The commonly known cause, complication, and management of obesity were poor diet (76. 9 %), hypertension (81. 8 %), and diet modification (86. 7 %), respectively. The anthropometric measures were higher among females compared to males. Prevalence of obesity was 61. 3 % according to WHR classification, 40. 8 % according to WHtR classification, 26. 1 % according to WC, and 14. 8 % according to BMI classification. Being female {{was significantly associated with}} high prevalence of obesity irrespective of the anthropometric measure used (p< 0. 05). Taking of snacks in meals, eating meals late at night, physical inactivity, excessive fast food <b>intake,</b> and <b>alcoholic</b> beverage <b>intake</b> were associated with increased prevalence of obesity (p< 0. 05).

Drinkers had significantlyhigher intakes of total calories than nondrinkers, but only because of their <b>intakes</b> of <b>alcoholic</b> calories. Among drinkers, the intakes of nonalcoholic calories decreased as alcohol intakes increased, and {{it was estimated that}} between 15 and 41 % of the alcoholic calories replaced nonalcoholic calories. Despite their higher caloric intakes, drinkers were not more obese than nondrinkers, suggesting that alcoholic calories may be lessefficiently utilized than nonalcoholic calories, or may interfere with utilization of nonalcoholic calories. The most salient difference in nutrient intake between drinkers and nondrinkers was the substantially lower carbohydrate intake of drinkers. Am J Clin Nuir l 985; 42 : 289 - 295.

40|$|Fluid and {{electrolyte}} status have {{a significant}} impact on physical performance and health. Pre-exercise recommendations cite the possibility of consuming beverages with high amounts of sodium. In this sense, non-alcoholic beer can be considered an effective pre-exercise hydration beverage. This double-blind, randomized study aimed to compare the effect of beer, non-alcoholic beer and water consumption before exercise on fluid and electrolyte homeostasis. Seven male soccer players performed 45 min of treadmill running at 65 % of the maximal heart rate, 45 min after ingesting 0. 7 L of water (W), beer (AB) or non-alcoholic beer (NAB). Body mass, plasma Na+ and K+ concentrations and urine specific gravity (USG) were assessed before fluid consumption and after exercise. After exercise, body mass decreased (p < 0. 05) in W (− 1. 1 %), AB (− 1. 0 %) and NAB (− 1. 0 %). In the last minutes of exercise, plasma Na+ was reduced (p < 0. 05) in W (− 3. 9 %) and AB (− 3. 7 %), plasma K+ was increased (p < 0. 05) in AB (8. 5 %), and USG was reduced in W (− 0. 9 %) and NAB (− 1. 0 %). Collectively, these results suggest that non-alcoholic beer before exercise could help maintain electrolyte homeostasis during exercise. <b>Alcoholic</b> beer <b>intake</b> reduced plasma Na+ and increased plasma K+ during exercise, which may negatively affect health and physical performance, and finally, the consumption of water before exercise could induce decreases of Na+ in plasma during exercise...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{describe}} {{the prevalence of}} alcohol consumption among Brazilian students and identify the sociodemographic factors associated alcohol consumption in the last 30 days. METHODS: Cross-sectional study with a cluster sample of 109, 104 9 th grade students in Brazilian {{public and private schools}} in 2012. The prevalence and 95 % confidence intervals of the indicators of alcohol consumption were analyzed. RESULTS: Of the students analyzed, 50. 3 % (95 %CI 49. 0 - 51. 6) experimented one dose of alcoholic beverages or more. The consumption of alcohol in the last 30 days was 26. 1 % (95 %CI 24. 5 - 27. 7), and {{there was no difference in}} prevalence between students from public and private schools. Drunkenness episodes were reported by 21. 8 % (95 %CI 21. 1 - 22. 5) of the students. The perception of students about the negative reaction of their family if they came home drunk occurred in 89, 7 % (95 %CI 89, 6 - 89, 9) of cases, and 10 % (95 %CI 8. 9 - 11. 1) of them reported having problems with their families or friends because they had been drinking. Among adolescents aged less than 14 years old, the first <b>alcoholic</b> drink <b>intake</b> was predominantly at 12 to 13 years old. The most common way to get a drink was at parties, with friends, buying in them in supermarkets, stores or bars and at home. The consumption of alcohol in the last 30 days was less frequent among boys, increasing with age. CONCLUSION: The study demonstrates the extension of alcohol as a problem, making it important to advance in measures such as the improvement of protective legislation for children and adolescents and stricter enforcement in alcohol sales...|$|R
40|$|To {{identify}} {{the consumption of}} alcoholic beverage and the relation with hypertension, their prevalence and associated factors, in indigenous Mura, Brazil. A cross-sectional population-based {{study was conducted with}} 455 adult indigenous aged 18 years or more of Mura ethnics in Amazonia, Brazil. Interview was conducted and the alcohol intake was assessed by the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test. Blood pressure was measured in three measurements and the mean of the last two measurements was used. Physical examination included the following data: weight, height, waist and neck circumference, bioimpedance, and capillary measurement of glucose, triglycerides and cholesterol. Through multivariate Logistic regression in stepwise, the odds ratios for alcohol consumption and associated factors were identified. The prevalence of alcoholic beverage was 40. 2 %, with no significant difference for hypertension in those who drink (23. 0 %) {{and those who did not}} drink (29. 0 %). Referred hypertension in indigenous was associated to less use of alcoholic beverages (14. 2 % vs 24. 3 %, P = 0. 009). After an adjusted analysis (Odds Ratio, 95 % CI), there was a positive association between <b>alcoholic</b> drink <b>intake</b> and male sex (10. 27, CI: 5. 76 - 18. 30), smoking (4. 72, CI: 2. 35 - 9. 46) and live in rural areas (9. 77, CI: 5. 08 - 18. 79). On the other hand, age (0. 95, IC: 0. 94 - 0. 97), and absence of dyslipidemia (0. 41, CI: 0. 19 - 0. 89) were associated to lower alcohol consumption. The prevalence of alcoholic beverage was high and associated with referred hypertension, but this association was not maintained after adjusted analysis. Changes to habits and inappropriate lifestyles in indigenous populations and living in urban areas may contribute to increase risk for cardiovascular diseases. Therefore, health policies should be implemented to meet the uniqueness of indigenous people...|$|R
40|$|With ageing, {{there is}} a greater risk of dehydration. This study {{investigated}} the diuretic effect of alcoholic beverages varying in alcohol concentration in elderly men. Three alcoholic beverages (beer (AB), wine (AW), and spirits (S)) and their non-alcoholic counterparts (non-alcoholic beer (NAB), non-alcoholic wine (NAW), and water (W)) were tested in a diet-controlled randomized crossover trial. For the <b>alcoholic</b> beverages, alcohol <b>intake</b> equaled a moderate amount of 30 g. An equal volume of beverage was given for the non-alcoholic counterpart. After consumption, the urine output was collected every hour for 4 h and the total 24 h urine output was measured. AW and S resulted in a higher cumulative urine output compared to NAW and W during the first 4 h (effect size: 0. 25 mL p 0. 40, p > 0. 10). AB and NAB did not differ at any time point (effect size: − 0. 02 mL p > 0. 70). For urine osmolality, and the sodium and potassium concentration, the findings were in line. In conclusion, only moderate amounts of stronger alcoholic beverages, such as wine and spirits, resulted in a short and small diuretic effect in elderly men...|$|R
40|$|Abstract — Aims: The {{inversion}} of melatonin circadian rhythm secretion in some <b>alcoholics</b> during both <b>intake</b> and acute withdrawal {{has been widely}} reported. In the same way, what happens to this inversion when these patients are in long-term withdrawal is not known. To document this abnormality in alcoholics after withdrawal we investigated melatonin secretion observed during chronic alcoholization and after withdrawal. Methods: We measured the urinary 6 -sulfatoxymelatonin (6 SM) (6 SM/creatinine ratio), main metabolite of the hormone, in two fractions, one diurnal and the other nocturnal, in seven alcohol-dependent patients presenting with this abnormality during alcoholization at two times: in acute withdrawal phase (under benzodiazepines) and 15 days after beginning of withdrawal (free of any psychotropic treatment). Results: Our results show that this reversed rhythm of melatonin secretion as seen by the diurnal excretion of 6 SM (6 SM/creatinine ratio) persists during acute withdrawal {{in more than half}} of the patients and is still present 15 days after withdrawal in three patients. Conclusion: It is remarkable that the {{inversion of}} the melatonin rhythms gets corrected in four out of seven patients after withdrawal. But, the circadian disorganization of melatonin secretion in three patients could underline a desynchronization in some alcoholic patients and may indicate more widespread circadian temporal structure disturbances in these patients...|$|R
40|$|Reliance on {{self-reported}} use {{of tobacco}} and intake of ethanol during pregnancy {{is associated with}} a high probability of error. Use of biological markers, or biomarkers, potentially offers a more valid method to assess exposure. Although cotinine is an established biomarker for tobacco use, there is no established biomarker for in utero ethanol exposure. Recent reports suggest that fatty acid ethyl esters (FAEE) could serve this purpose. To assess agreement between maternal self-reported tobacco use and ethanol intake during pregnancy and detection of metabolites associated with tobacco use (cotinine) and ethanol intake (FAEE), the authors studied maternal histories and meconium samples obtained in November–December 1999 from 436 consecutive mother-infant pairs at a large urban regional perinatal center in Honolulu, Hawaii. Cohen’s kappa coefficient and 95 % confidence intervals were calculated. Moderate agreement was found between reported tobacco use during the third trimester and detected cotinine level (kappa = 0. 53, 95 % confidence interval: 0. 39, 0. 68); however, there was no agreement between reported ethanol intake during the third trimester and detected FAEE (kappa = – 0. 02, 95 % confidence interval: – 0. 04, 0. 00). No mother reporting ethanol intake during the third trimester had detectable FAEE. Findings support the need for additional refinement and validation of the use of FAEE as a biomarker for maternal ethanol <b>intake.</b> <b>alcoholic</b> beverages; biological markers; pregnancy; tobacc...|$|R
