In 2014, following an outcry by Florida property owners facing steep flood insurance rate hikes, Nelson supported legislation to provide retroactive refunds for people who have had large flood insurance rate increases due to the sale or purchase of a home, cap average <b>annual</b> <b>premium</b> increases at 15 to 18 percent and allow subsidies for insurance rates that are based on current flood maps.|$|E
25|$|In June 2005, Nova amended its working {{times for}} {{instructors}} and standardized lesson length to 40 minutes, with two minutes either side for lesson planning and student evaluation, {{resulting in a}} total lesson time of 44 minutes. Six to eleven minutes of unpaid time was left between classes. As a result of changes to working hours, regular non-titled teachers whose work weeks were reduced to slightly under 30 hours became ineligible for shakai hoken, giving an estimated savings to the company of over one billion yen in <b>annual</b> <b>premium</b> payments. Such employees can register for National Health Insurance (a different system to Shakai Hoken), although this system does not offer coverage for time taken off work due to illness.

50|$|In the United States, {{there are}} also tax {{advantages}} to perpetual insurance. The deposit premium does not yield any income to the insured. However, {{the expense of the}} <b>annual</b> <b>premium</b> for term homeowners insurance is eliminated. Therefore, the tax-adjusted, equivalent rate of return to the insured homeowner on the deposit premium can be calculated by taking the gross amount of money he or she needs to earn to net the amount of an <b>annual</b> <b>premium</b> for a term policy, divided by the amount of the deposit premium. For example, a house which costs $150,000 may typically be charged an <b>annual</b> <b>premium</b> of $1,000 for a term policy. That same house would likely require a $10,000 single deposit premium for a perpetual insurance policy of equivalent coverage. A person in the 28% Tax bracket would need to earn $1,389 in gross income to pay the <b>annual</b> <b>premium.</b> Since that amount no longer needs to be paid annually, the tax-adjusted, equivalent rate of return to the insured homeowner on the single deposit premium would be $1,389, less the after-tax returns that would have been earned on investing the deposit premium (or $600, assuming a 6% after-tax rate of return) divided by $10,000, in other words, 7.89%.|$|E

Review of 18 major contractors showed that DOE was not consistently following its policy and that contractors using commercial insurance incurred higher costs.
