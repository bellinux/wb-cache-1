Conventional FT catalyst screening consists of comparing the catalytic performance at the same experimental conditions (temperature, pressure, H 2 /CO ratio, and amount of catalyst or active phase).

In this study, density functional calculations have been carried out to investigate the morphology effect of Au NPs using CO as a probe molecule.

CO binding to a multiple twin NP with a size of about 1 nm is stronger than that on a single-crystal NP with the same size. A simple CN explanation cannot be applied to the enhancement of CO binding to the small multiple twin NP.
