5|$|The AirTrain JFK {{portion of}} this station has two tracks and one island {{platform}} on the upper level of the station complex. The eastern end of the AirTrain platform leads to Parking Area C. Unlike the New York City Subway platforms, the AirTrain JFK platforms are entirely enclosed and feature platform screen doors, which help the station maintain a constant temperature and prevent passengers from falling onto the tracks. An array of sensors detect a train's position on the track, <b>and</b> <b>only</b> <b>when</b> it is properly aligned will the train's doors open. This enables the AirTrain to use automatic train operation without drivers.|$|E
5|$|MacLaren {{had many}} jobs as he {{attempted}} {{to find ways to}} support his cricket, family and lifestyle. At various time, he worked as a teacher, a journalist and a cricket coach. For many years, he was employed as Lancashire's assistant secretary but such were his financial worries that he often had to ask for cash advances from the committee, with which he had a stormy relationship. He worked for several years as private secretary to K. S. Ranjitsinhji and he became involved in his employer's financial scandals. Many of MacLaren's later business ventures were failures, <b>and</b> <b>only</b> <b>when</b> his wife came into an inheritance did he and his family live in comfort. Throughout his life, MacLaren was involved in many disagreements and was never popular with teammates. However, he was a hero to the cricket writer Neville Cardus, who wrote prolifically on him. MacLaren died in 1944, aged 72.|$|E

25|$|Sorceries and instants differ only in {{when they}} can be cast. Sorceries may only be cast during the player's own main phase, <b>and</b> <b>only</b> <b>when</b> the stack is empty.

25|$|Meroë's {{succession}} {{system was}} not necessarily hereditary; the matrilineal royal family member deemed most worthy often became king.

25|$|In Pushkin's time, {{the early}} 19th century, duels were very {{strictly}} regulated.

A challenger's second should therefore always ask the challenged party if he wants to apologise for his actions that have led to the challenge.|$|E
25|$|In 1946, Jones married fashion czar Harry Conover, one of {{the first}} model agents. They had three sons, and Jones says she didn't realize Conover was {{bisexual}} until some years into their marriage.

25|$|There {{are three}} main types of monastics. Those {{who live in}} monasteries under a common rule are coenobitic. Each monastery may {{formulate}} its own rule, and {{although there are no}} religious orders in Orthodoxy some respected monastic centers such as Mount Athos are highly influential. Eremitic monks, or hermits, are those who live solitary lives. It is the yearning of many who enter the monastic life to eventually become solitary hermits. This most austere life is only granted to the most advanced monastics <b>and</b> <b>only</b> <b>when</b> their superiors feel they are ready for it.|$|E
25|$|An {{ordinance}} is also extant {{which dates}} from the time called the period of religious persecution ("shemad"). When Hadrian issued his decree forbidding the Jews to observe their religion, the teachers, including R. Akiba, R. Tarfon, and R. Jose the Galilean, met in council and agreed that {{during the time of}} the persecution the Law might be transgressed in all respects, except as regarded the commands relating to idolatry, chastity, and morality, although this regulation was observed only superficially <b>and</b> <b>only</b> <b>when</b> necessary in order to deceive the Roman spies.|$|E

25|$|Furthermore, Andersen {{had changed}} his story several times during interrogation, <b>and</b> <b>only</b> <b>when</b> confronted with {{evidence}} had he admitted to the molesting the girls, as well as covering the bodies with pine branches. He never showed any signs of remorse, seeing himself as another victim of his co-defendant. Court psychiatrists noted his striking tendency to blame {{every aspect of the}} crime on Kristiansen, but could not agree on a definite diagnosis. In the end, it was Andersen's statement which was the main pillar in the verdict against Kristiansen.|$|E
25|$|Lieutenants {{were first}} {{appointed}} {{to a number}} of English counties by King Henry VIII in the 1540s, when the military functions of the sheriff were handed over to him. He raised and was responsible for the efficiency of the local militia units of the county, and afterwards of the yeomanry, and volunteers. He was commander of these forces, whose officers he appointed. These commissions were originally of temporary duration, <b>and</b> <b>only</b> <b>when</b> the situation required the local militia to be specially supervised and well prepared; often where invasion by Scotland or France might be expected.|$|E

He protested strongly to the local authorities, proclaiming his credentials as an archaeologist ought to be above suspicion.

25|$|A rating, {{referring}} to the seaman's rate or task on the ship, was enlisted onto a ship's complement when the ship was commissioned.

25|$|The attackers took {{approximately}} 1,100 hostages. The {{number of}} hostages was initially downplayed {{by the government}} to 200–400, and then for an unknown reason announced to be exactly 354. In 2005, their number was put at 1,128. The militants herded their captives into the school's gym and confiscated all their mobile phones under threat of death, and ordered everyone to speak in Russian <b>and</b> <b>only</b> <b>when</b> spoken to. When a father named Ruslan Betrozov stood to calm people and repeat the rules in the local language, Ossetic, a gunman approached him, asked Betrozov if he was done, and then shot him in the head. Another father named Vadim Bolloyev, who refused to kneel, was also shot by a captor and then bled to death. Their bodies were dragged from the sports hall, leaving a trail of blood later visible in the video made by the hostage-takers.|$|E
25|$|In {{the first}} {{international}} game, Scotland against England on 30 November 1872, England played with seven or eight forwards in a 1–1–8 or 1–2–7 formation, and Scotland with six, in a 2–2–6 formation. For England, one player would remain in defence, picking up loose balls, {{and one or two}} players would hang around midfield and kick the ball upfield for the other players to chase. The English style of play at the time was all about individual excellence and English players were renowned for their dribbling skills. Players would attempt to take the ball forward as far as possible <b>and</b> <b>only</b> <b>when</b> they could proceed no further, would they kick it ahead for someone else to chase. Scotland surprised England by actually passing the ball among players. The Scottish outfield players were organised into pairs and each player would always attempt to pass the ball to his assigned partner. Ironically, with so much attention given to attacking play, the game ended in a 0–0 draw.|$|E
