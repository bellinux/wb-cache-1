40|$|Lecturepg. 69 This paper {{describes}} a unique pumping concept {{based on a}} noncontact mechanism operating solely using the principles of boundary layer and viscous drag. The first section focuses on the pumping technology itself, describing how the pump mechanism operates, while the second section examines how the pump functions in problem applications, such as handling abrasive, viscous, high solids, air-entrained, and shear sensitive fluids. The next section describes the pump operating and design characteristics, including information on the pump?s NPSH requirement and other standard pump performance data. The final section {{describes a}}nd end-user?s experience with the disc pump in an oil refinery application. The disc pump system operates solely using the principles of boundary layer and viscous drag, two phenomena well-known in fluid engineering. Although superficially the disc pump looks like a centrifugal unit, it has no impeller in the traditional sense, and uses instead a series of parallel, rotating discs, referred to in this paper as the ?<b>disc</b> <b>assembly,?</b> to generate the energy necessary to move product. The key difference between the <b>disc</b> <b>assembly</b> and a standard centrifugal pump impeller is that, with the <b>disc</b> <b>assembly,</b> the pumpage does not impinge on the rotating pump mechanism, so that it generates a pulsation-free, laminar flow pattern through the pump. The disc pump can operate effectively in hard-to-pump applications because it lacks an ?impingement? device, which results in minimal contact between the pump and pumpage...|$|R

This paper discusses only the pressure locking phenomenon in a flexible-wedge gate valve; we will publish {{the results of our}} thermal binding research at a later date. Pressure locking can occur when operating sequences or temperature changes cause the pressure of the fluid in the bonnet (and, in most valves, between the discs) to be higher than the pressure on the upstream and downstream sides of the <b>disc</b> <b>assembly.</b> This high fluid pressure presses the discs against both seats, making the <b>disc</b> <b>assembly</b> harder to unseat than anticipated by the typical design calculations, which generally consider friction at only one of the two disc/seat interfaces. The high pressure of the bonnet fluid also changes the pressure distribution around the disc in a way that can further contribute to the unseating load. If the combined loads associated with pressure locking are very high, the actuator might not have the capacity to open the valve. The results of the NRC/INEL research discussed in this paper show that the relationship between bonnet pressure and pressure locking stem loads appears linear. The results also show that for this valve, seat leakage affects the bonnet pressurization rate when the valve is subjected to thermally induced pressure locking conditions...|$|R
