5|$|Anticonvulsants {{suppress}} epileptic seizures, {{but they}} neither cure nor prevent {{the development of}} seizure susceptibility. The development of epilepsy (epileptogenesis) is <b>a</b> <b>process</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> poorly understood. A few anticonvulsants (valproate, levetiracetam and benzodiazepines) have shown antiepileptogenic properties in animal models of epileptogenesis. However, no anticonvulsant has ever achieved this in a clinical trial in humans. The ketogenic diet {{has been found to}} have antiepileptogenic properties in rats.|$|E
5|$|In normal untransformed cells, EFS {{acts as a}} SRC family kinase {{substrate}} in neurite outgrowth, <b>a</b> <b>process</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> {{dependent on}} activity of SRC kinases. Reciprocally, EFS activates SRC signaling through c-CRK and RAP1. Further, SRC directly phosphorylates residues Y576 and Y577 tyrosine sites on the EFS, enhancing targeting FAK, and eventually the solubility and/or stability of the complex. Through SRC, EFS may also negatively regulate expression of E-cadherin at adherens junctions, a function that has been reported for other CAS proteins (NEDD9 and BCAR1); however, this point has not been directly established for EFS.|$|E

5|$|In the liver, the {{carboxylation}} of cytosolic pyruvate into intra-mitochondrial oxaloacetate is {{an early}} step in the gluconeogenic pathway, which converts lactate and de-aminated alanine into glucose, {{under the influence of}} high levels of glucagon and/or epinephrine in the blood. Here, the addition of oxaloacetate to the mitochondrion does not have a net anaplerotic effect, as another citric acid cycle intermediate (malate) is immediately removed from the mitochondrion to be converted into cytosolic oxaloacetate, which is ultimately converted into glucose, in <b>a</b> <b>process</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> almost the reverse of glycolysis.|$|E
5|$|Bacterial infections may {{be treated}} with antibiotics, which are {{classified}} as bacteriocidal if they kill bacteria, or bacteriostatic if they just prevent bacterial growth. There are many types of antibiotics and each class inhibits <b>a</b> <b>process</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> different in the pathogen from that found in the host. An example of how antibiotics produce selective toxicity are chloramphenicol and puromycin, which inhibit the bacterial ribosome, but not the structurally different eukaryotic ribosome. Antibiotics are used both in treating human disease and in intensive farming to promote animal growth, where they may be contributing to the rapid development of antibiotic resistance in bacterial populations. Infections can be prevented by antiseptic measures such as sterilising the skin prior to piercing it with the needle of a syringe, and by proper care of indwelling catheters. Surgical and dental instruments are also sterilised to prevent contamination by bacteria. Disinfectants such as bleach are used to kill bacteria or other pathogens on surfaces to prevent contamination and further {{reduce the risk of}} infection.|$|E
5|$|Selenium is most {{commonly}} produced from selenide in many sulfide ores, {{such as those}} of copper, nickel, or lead. Electrolytic metal refining is particularly productive of selenium as a byproduct, obtained from the anode mud of copper refineries. Another source was the mud from the lead chambers of sulfuric acid plants, <b>a</b> <b>process</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> no longer used. Selenium can be refined from these muds by a number of methods. However, most elemental selenium comes as a byproduct of refining copper or producing sulfuric acid. Since its invention, solvent extraction and electrowinning (SX/EW) production of copper produces an increasing share of the worldwide copper supply. This changes the availability of selenium because only a comparably small part of the selenium in the ore is leached with the copper.|$|E

By 2006 they had been used to give direct distance estimates to the LMC, SMC, Andromeda Galaxy and Triangulum Galaxy. Eclipsing binaries offer a direct method to gauge the distance to galaxies to a new improved 5% level of accuracy.|$|E
25|$|All lens {{constants}} are estimates, {{to begin}} with. To obtain {{the best possible}} results, {{it is imperative that}} these constants be optimized. Optimization is <b>a</b> <b>process</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> user-specific and incorporates the various systematic errors attributable to measurement of ocular parameters. In order to optimize a lens-constant, the user must back calculate the formula so that the actual post-operative refractive error is included. This means that one must calculate the constant so that a recalculation of the formula would predict exactly the same refractive error as actually observed.|$|E
25|$|Hemozoin {{formation}} {{is an excellent}} drug target, since it is <b>a</b> <b>process</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> essential {{to the survival of}} the malaria parasite and absent from the human host. The drug target hematin is host-derived and largely outside the genetic control of the parasite, which makes the development of drug resistance more difficult. Many clinically used drugs are thought to act by inhibiting the formation of hemozoin in the food vacuole. This prevents the detoxification of the heme released in this compartment, and kills the parasite.|$|E

25|$|The {{demolition}} {{of a house}} for military purposes is often undertaken {{in very different ways}} to conventional civilian demolitions. In peacetime situations, demolition is merely the first stage in <b>a</b> <b>process</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> usually intended to clear the ground for subsequent re-use (for instance, replacing an old building with a newer one or decommissioning an old industrial building). It is undertaken with extensive preparations, such as stripping the property of items of value, removing hazardous materials such as glass and asbestos insulation, and preparing the structure by removing features that might impede the demolition (such as internal partitions).|$|E
25|$|To contrast, in <b>a</b> <b>process</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> not a martingale, it {{may still}} {{be the case that}} the {{expected}} value of the process at one time is equal to the expected value of the process at the next time. However, knowledge of the prior outcomes (e.g., all prior cards drawn from a card deck) may be able to reduce the uncertainty of future outcomes. Thus, the expected value of the next outcome given knowledge of the present and all prior outcomes may be higher than the current outcome if a winning strategy is used. Martingales exclude the possibility of winning strategies based on game history, and thus they are a model of fair games.|$|E

25|$|The cobalt-containing Vitamin B12 (also {{known as}} cobalamin) catalyzes the {{transfer}} of methyl (−CH3) groups between two molecules, which involves the breaking of C−C bonds, <b>a</b> <b>process</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> energetically expensive in organic reactions. The metal ion lowers the activation energy for the process by forming a transient Co−CH3 bond. The structure of the coenzyme was famously determined by Dorothy Hodgkin and co-workers, for which she received a Nobel Prize in Chemistry. It consists of a cobalt(II) ion coordinated to four nitrogen atoms of a corrin ring and a fifth nitrogen atom from an imidazole group. In the resting state there is a Co−C sigma bond with the 5′ carbon atom of adenosine. This is a naturally occurring organometallic compound, which explains its function in trans-methylation reactions, such as the reaction carried out by methionine synthase.|$|E
25|$|With the {{increasing}} speed of modern CPUs, parallel flash devices are often much {{slower than the}} memory bus of the computer they are connected to. Conversely, modern SRAM offers access times below 10ns, while DDR2 SDRAM offers access times below 20ns. Because of this, it is often desirable to shadow code stored in flash into RAM; that is, the code is copied from flash into RAM before execution, so that the CPU may access it at full speed. Device firmware may be stored in a serial flash device, and then copied into SDRAM or SRAM when the device is powered-up. Using an external serial flash device rather than on-chip flash removes the need for significant process compromise (<b>a</b> <b>process</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> good for high-speed logic is generally not good for flash and vice versa). Once it is decided to read the firmware in as one big block {{it is common to}} add compression to allow a smaller flash chip to be used. Typical applications for serial flash include storing firmware for hard drives, Ethernet controllers, DSL modems, wireless network devices, etc.|$|E
25|$|Once the {{nucleosynthesis}} process {{arrives at}} iron-56, {{the continuation of}} this process consumes energy (the addition of fragments to nuclei releases less energy than required to break them off the parent nuclei). If {{the mass of the}} core exceeds the Chandrasekhar limit, electron degeneracy pressure will be unable to support its weight against the force of gravity, and the core will undergo sudden, catastrophic collapse to form a neutron star or (in the case of cores that exceed the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff limit), a black hole. Through <b>a</b> <b>process</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> not completely understood, some of the gravitational potential energy released by this core collapse is converted into a Type Ib, Type Ic, or Type II supernova. It is known that the core collapse produces a massive surge of neutrinos, as observed with supernova SN 1987A. The extremely energetic neutrinos fragment some nuclei; some of their energy is consumed in releasing nucleons, including neutrons, and some of their energy is transformed into heat and kinetic energy, thus augmenting the shock wave started by rebound of some of the infalling material from the collapse of the core. Electron capture in very dense parts of the infalling matter may produce additional neutrons. Because some of the rebounding matter is bombarded by the neutrons, some of its nuclei capture them, creating a spectrum of heavier-than-iron material including the radioactive elements up to (and likely beyond) uranium. Although non-exploding red giants can produce significant quantities of elements heavier than iron using neutrons released in side reactions of earlier nuclear reactions, the abundance of elements heavier than iron (and in particular, of certain isotopes of elements that have multiple stable or long-lived isotopes) produced in such reactions is quite different from that produced in a supernova. Neither abundance alone matches that found in the Solar System, so both supernovae and ejection of elements from red giants are required to explain the observed abundance of heavy elements and isotopes thereof.|$|E
