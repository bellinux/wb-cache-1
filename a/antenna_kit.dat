The company was the first organisation to design and produce mobile antennas ready for the UK launch of the UK 900 MHz cellular network on 1 January 1985 and by 1998 had captured 75% {{of the market for}} external aerials used by mobile phone operators. It also became {{a founding member of the}} Federation of Communications Services Ltd. Panorama particularly came to specialize in providing GSM glassmount <b>antennas</b> for car <b>kits</b> and was not only the first company in Europe to sell glassmounts but also developed the first solid state coupling circuit for glassmounts in the world.|$|R
