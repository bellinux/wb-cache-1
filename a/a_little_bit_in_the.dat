25|$|The 1987–88 NBA season saw the Mavericks dip just <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> regular season—finishing 53–29 {{and losing}} their Midwest Division {{title to the}} Denver Nuggets—but it was another {{successful}} year for the team. Mark Aguirre and James Donaldson both played in the 1988 NBA All-Star Game, the Mavericks rattled off a franchise-best 11-game winning streak, and Rolando Blackman scored his 10,000th career point. Aguirre led the team in scoring for the sixth consecutive year with 25.1 points per game, and Roy Tarpley won the NBA Sixth Man Award with averages of 13.5 points and 11.8 rebounds. The season saw the Mavs' deepest playoff run to date. They dispatched the Houston Rockets in four games and the Nuggets in six, leaving only the defending NBA Champion Lakers between them and their first-ever trip to the NBA Finals. The Mavericks gave the Lakers everything they could handle, {{but in the end}} the more experienced Lakers prevailed, defeating Dallas in seven games on the way to eventually winning their second consecutive NBA Championship.|$|E
500|$|It is to {{be noted}} that the riders started in reverse order of the general classification, so Pinot was the last one to start. The riders went off the {{starting}} ramp in two minutes increments. Cancellara got on course early, as he was the seventh man to start. He clocked a time of 48' 55", which would stay a reference for most of the day. He was followed out of the starting area by Matthias Brändle (IAM Cycling) who came in 2' 28" [...] after Cancellara, somewhat surprisingly as he is a time trial specialist too. Malori set the best time at the [...] intermediate point but faded <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> end, coming to the finish line only 15 seconds off Cancellara's time. The Swiss would stay as a reference for a while now that some time trial specialists had finished their effort and failed to beat him. Damien Gaudin (Ag2r-La Mondiale) clocked in a time of 50' 46" [...] which put him in sixth position.|$|E

It's {{going to be more}} suggestive and not so vibrant, in your face like III and IV. It's more neutral and shows natural flesh tones. On Saw V, I pulled back a little bit and on this one, I pulled back even more." [...] He commented that the [...] "steam room" [...] trap was the [...] "best looking" [...] of them all. [...] He went on to say, [...] "It's big and expensive. It's got furnaces, fires and steam. It's multi-leveled. The most complex Saw. We had techno cranes flying through. It was pretty amazing." [...] Commenting on the [...] "carousel room" [...] trap Armstrong said: [...] "It's very carnival, playground-like. It's just nasty. [...] spinning red lights in there. It's really overwhelming to walk in and look at because everything is spinning." [...] Greutert said in an issue of the horror magazine Fangoria that the [...] "carousel room" [...] was, to date, the [...] "longest trap scene ever". He admitted that originally they had ten actors riding the carousel, but it was ultimately scaled down to six, to [...] "tie in to the [...] title".

2500|$|Jeff Cork from Game Informer {{scored the}} game an 8/10, saying: [...] "Creation and {{discovery}} are at Tearaways foundation, and I was still pleasantly {{surprised at the}} steady drip of new abilities, gameplay elements, and other novelties delivered throughout. Not everything lands, but the parts that do are outstanding. One thing did seem {{to get lost in}} the move to PS4, though: Tearaway on Vita was an intimate experience. Holding the device close to my face, it felt as though I was privy to a secret directly from Media Molecule.
