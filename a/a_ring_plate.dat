40|$|Abstract. The {{variable}} cross-section H-type structure, {{which is}} used in the new type of heat exchanger with longitudinal flow of shell side, could reduce the scour action of imports fluid on the tube bundle and prevent vibration of the tube bundle. It could also improve the state of the shell side fluid flow, reducing the flow dead zone, allowing for a more efficient use of the heat transfer area and improving the energy efficiency. The new structure will make the temperature and stress distribution in the heat distribution more complex, so it is necessary to analyze the stress intensity of the variable cross-section H-type structure. A three-dimensional finite element model of the variable cross-section H-type structure is established in this paper, and the surface temperature of the various parts of the heat exchanger are determined through temperature analysis. Using ANSYS Workbench software, thermal-stress analysis of the H-type structure with different structural parameters is tested, and the temperature and stress field are obtained. The results show that <b>a</b> <b>Ring</b> <b>plate</b> of H-type structure has a larger temperature gradient along the thickness direction. The maximum stress of the heat exchanger is 203. 13 MPa, which occurred on the connections of the ring plate and jacket in the lower temperature side. The ring plate thickness of the H-type structure has a significant influence on its maximum stress. Therefore, a reasonable selection of ring plate thickness is important {{for the safety of the}} heat exchanger...|$|E

Two cases of transversely isotropic medium have been considered viz., (i) homogeneous transversely isotropic halfspace and (ii) multilayered transversely isotropic halfspace. The stiffness matrix for the <b>ring</b> <b>plate</b> has been obtained using ring elements (FEM) in an explicit form and the stiffness matrix for the transversely isotropic halfspace models considered here have been obtained using a general analytical solution. The interface of <b>ring</b> <b>plate</b> and halfspace has been considered as smooth. The present approach automatically takes care of the semi-infinite nature of the transversely isotropic medium unlike the total finite element procedure where the halfspace is represented by a large size solid (discretised in to a large number of finite elements, especially in treating a multilayered halfspace) with certain imposed constraints. Results have been presented for the contact pressure distribution, displacement profile and bending moment variation in the <b>ring</b> <b>plate.</b> It is observed that the present approach is computationally efficient, more general and can be applied to different elastic contact problems...|$|R

40|$|A new {{instrumental}} {{method for}} measuring the physical properties of a liquid has been developed. The instrument, called a capacitive drop tensiometer (CDT), {{is based on the}} drop volume principle in combination with a capacitive transducer. A delivery head with a specialized wetting design was constructed for forming drops. The capacitive transducer uses the delivery head as one of its <b>plates</b> and <b>a</b> cylindrical <b>ring</b> <b>plate,</b> which surrounds the delivery head and the space occupied by the drop that is formed, as another. Excellent linearity is achieved by optimizing the design, with an accuracy of drop volume measurement of approximately 2 mu l. The system is suitable for measuring both drops in equilibrium and those in the process of growing. Its capability of real-time measurement makes it particularly useful for volatile liquids, in which instance the measurement of drop volume using a flowmeter or a pump is no longer reliable. The CDT {{can also be used to}} determine concentration. It was found that the concentration curve is linear for aqueous glycerol solutions although not so for aqueous ethanol solutions. The CDT's ability to measure surface tension was also explored and experimental results are presented here...|$|R

50|$|The dairy {{farmhouse}} {{is located}} 350m {{west of the}} settlement area. A large, rendered brick chimney is {{all that remains of}} the farmhouse, a feature that probably survives from sawmill times. The brick chimney is surrounded by a fence that was erected by QPWS to limit access to the chimney by visitors to the Park and for public health and safety. Three concrete steps are associated with the brick chimney that originally led into the house, but now go nowhere. The concrete is very coarse and of a poor quality. There is a garden associated with the farmhouse that contains a number of historic plantings including crepe myrtles, guavas and bougainvillea. Two mango trees were planted in 1924 by Vera Grady (née Crang), whose family owned and worked the property as a dairy. Near the mango trees is the original brick-lined well dating to the sawmill period. John Crang built a wooden cover for the well that was hinged in the middle in the 1920s, this has since been replaced with <b>a</b> metal <b>ring</b> <b>plate</b> and <b>a</b> wooden platform completely enclosing the well. A windmill, also built by John Crang is associated with the well. The four large timber posts around the windmill were erected by Cecil Potts. A plaque erected in 1993 is located at the junction of a walking track from the Elanda Point camping area to the south and tramway formation to the west.|$|R

40|$|Cone-cylinder intersections are {{commonly}} found in pressure vessels and piping. Examples include conical end closures to cylindrical vessels and conical reducers between cylinders of different radii. In {{the case of a}} cone large end-to-cylinder intersection under internal pressure, the intersection is subject to a large circumferential compressive force. Both the cone and the cylinder may be thickened near the intersection to resist this compression, but it is often convenient and necessary to augment further the strength of the intersection using <b>an</b> annular <b>plate</b> <b>ring</b> stiffener. Under this large circumferential compression, the intersection may fail by elastic buckling, plastic buckling or plastic collapse. This paper describes an investigation of the elastic buckling strength of ring-stiffened cone-cylinder intersections. Two buckling modes are identified: a shell mode for thin intersections with a shallow cone (a cone with its apex half angle approaching 90 °) and/or <b>a</b> relatively stocky <b>ring</b> stiffener, and <b>a</b> <b>ring</b> mode for other cases. An existing elastic buckling approximation for annular <b>plate</b> <b>rings</b> in steel silos is found to be applicable to the intersection when it buckles in the ring mode. New approximate design equations are also established for the shell mode. In addition, simple expressions are identified which relate the number of circumferential buckling waves to the geometric parameters of the intersection.

A cam - tappet test stand was available for the experimental investigations. The results from frictional force measurements on the unsteady and steady model systems as well as from measurements of the temperature distribution in the EHD contact have confirmed theoretical considerations on the effect of thermal material properties. In contrast, the low influence of elastic material properties, present in accordance with Hertz's theory, could not be proved in the contact with moving lubricated surfaces. (orig.)

40|$|A unique {{morphological}} {{feature of}} the embryonic avian cornea is the uniformity of its complement of striated collagen fibrils, {{each of which has}} a diameter of 25 nm. We have asked whether this apparent morphological uniformity also reflects an inherent uniformity of the structural and physical properties of these fibrils. For this we have examined the in situ thermal stability of the type I collagen within these fibrils. Corneal tissue sections were reacted at progressively higher temperatures with conformation-dependent monoclonal antibodies directed against the triple-helical domain of the type I collagen molecule. These studies show that the cornea contains layers of collagen fibrils with greater than average stability. The two most prominent of these extend uninterrupted across the entire width of the cornea, and then appear to insert into thick bundles of scleral collagen, which in turn appear to insert into the scleral ossicles, <b>a</b> <b>ring</b> of bony <b>plates</b> which circumscribe the sclera of the avian eye.

40|$|Abstract: The {{mechanical}} {{performance of}} a new proposed type of cross-shaped connection with concrete-filled steel tubular (CFST) column and assembled steel H-beam was investigated. Cyclic loading tests on the cross-shaped connections are carried out by using MTS servo loading system. Comparative analyses are conducted based on the experimental results including hysteretic curves, skeleton curves and stiffness degradation curves as well as ductility coefficients of cyclic loading tests. Furthermore, effects of geometric parameters of ring-stiffened plate, axial compression ratio and backing plate on the deformation performance of cross-shaped connections are analyzed. The {{results show that the}} increase of width of <b>ring</b> <b>plate</b> and the shape change of <b>ring</b> <b>plate</b> from square to circle can both significantly improve the ductility and the hysteretic characteristics of connection. It is emphasized that the specimen with square <b>ring</b> <b>plates</b> is of better deformation performance but lower bearing capacity than the ones with circular <b>ring</b> <b>plates.</b> Besides, the backing plates always have positive effects on the hysteretic characteristics, ductility and energy dissipation of the CFST column connections. Conversely, the increase of axial compression ratio contributes negatively to both the bearing capacity and deformation performance of the connection specimens. It can be concluded that the presented cross-shaped connection is of good deformation performance relating to hysteretic characteristics, energy dissipation and ductility, which can provide reference towards engineering practice with potential perspective application...|$|R
50|$|The {{lightship}} was not {{an ideal}} solution; in particular, {{it had to be}} withdrawn each fall due to ice. Coal traffic was heavy, and it was felt that a permanent fixed light would mark the shoal more effectively. Therefore, in 1936 a lighthouse was set on the spot.

This consisted of a cylindrical house twenty-five feet across and divided into two rooms to provide temporary living quarters for servicing personnel.
