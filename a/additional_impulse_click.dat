Materials: 20 healthy individuals aged 18 - 26 years old have been participated in the investigations. Two groups composed of 10 patients each have been formed. Double increase in heart biopotentials by means of artificial impulse insertion between natural cardiac contractions has been modeled. Artificial impulses have been similar to unaffected ones, produced in a normal heart work. <b>Additional</b> <b>impulses</b> have been generated using external pacemaker and have been linked up with electrodes on the chest. They have been synchronized with the heart rhythm and located in-between R waves. The duration of those impulses has been fully matched to ventricular complex. Their amplitude has been adjusted individually depending on the height of R wave. Nervous system mobility {{has been used as}} the indicator reflecting the central nervous system functioning. Degree of mobility has been defined on the basis of tapping test results. The test has been repeated at specific intervals. Groups have been exposed to two adverse testing modes. <b>Additional</b> <b>impulses</b> have been conducted to the patients of group I within an hour over a period of the first and the third 15 -minute intervals and to the patients of group II over a period of the second and the fourth 15 -minute intervals.

The stimulation has been performed within the 40 -minute course: over a period of the first 20 -minute interval and vice versa. Results: Detailed evaluation has revealed that short-time increase of nervous processes has been checked in combination with decrease in their stability.

Optimal transfers in the system are shown to meet certain conditions placed on the primer vector and its time derivative. A two point boundary value problem containing these necessary conditions is created for use in targeting optimal transfers.

Responses of ganglion cells of the magnocellular (MC) pathway were much more vigorous than those of cells of the parvocellular (PC) pathway. From the variability in the number of impulses in the response as compared with the distribution of impulses in maintained activity, it was possible to generate receiver operating characteristics for cells of the two pathways, and to predict individual cells capability to detect a displacement with 75 probability. On comparing cell sensitivities to human psychophysical thresholds (75 probability of correct identification of displacement direction) at an equivalent retinal eccentricity (-SO), we found that one or two <b>additional</b> <b>impulses</b> in two MC pathway cells would suffice to support an ideal detector underlying psychophysical performance, at all contrast levels.

First, we {{demonstrate that}} uncertainty, {{measured by a}} number of proxies, appears to be strongly countercyclical. When uncertainty is included in a standard vector-autoregression, increases in uncertainty lead to a large drop and rebound in economic activity. Second, we build a dynamic stochastic general equilibrium model that extends the benchmark neoclassical growth model along two dimensions. It allows for the existence of heterogeneous firms with non-convex adjustment costs in both capital and labor and time variation in uncertainty, modelled as a changing variance of innovations to productivity. We find that increases in uncertainty lead to large drops in employment and investment. This occurs because uncertainty makes firms cautious, leading them to pause hiring and investment. This freezing in activity also reduces the reallocation of capital and labor across firms, leading to a large fall in productivity growth. Taken together, the freeze in hiring, investment and productivity growth lead to a business cycle sized drop and rebound in output following a rise in uncertainty...|$|R

40|$|International audienceA {{stand-alone}} {{electronic device}} {{has been developed}} that processes the raw electrical output produced by an electric violin, generating an output signal which, when fed to an amplifier, produces a sound that approximates closely the timbre of an acoustic or wooden instrument. The system comprises a high-impedance preamplifier, a 24 -bit sigma delta codec and a digital signal processor (DSP) operating at 600 million multiplications-accumulations per second (MMACs). The device holds in its memory the far-field impulse response of a wooden instrument; this is convolved in real-time with the input signal to produce the modified output signal. The unprocessed output produced by an electric violin is typically a saw-tooth waveform, which results from the slip-stick regime created under normal bowing. Similarly, such a waveform is also manifest {{on the bridge of}} acoustic violins and for this reason the system may also be used with wooden instruments fitted with pickups mounted on the bridge.

The study enlightens, both theoretically and numerically, that impulsive contributions to the dynamic response appear in the relative displacement formulation at the time instants in which each vehicle enters or exits the bridge. It is demonstrated that such contributions, somehow “hidden” in the absolute displacement formulation, may have a significant influence on the vibration of the moving oscillators, and thus cannot be a priori neglected in the analysis. It is also shown that the analytical and computational difficulties associated with these <b>additional</b> <b>impulses</b> make preferable the use of the absolute displacement formulation.

40|$|The {{transition}} from conventional (fossil fuel based) energy generation methods to renewable energy variants {{is set in}} motion but can certainly use an <b>additional</b> <b>impulse.</b> A good example is the solar energy market which is struggling since industry "gray-current" electricity-prices are low enough to prevent a smooth and effective transition to a photovoltaic-dominated electricity market. One way of breaking the established equilibrium {{is to increase the}} conversion efficiencies of solar panels without inducing skyrocketing prices. Typically, high-energy (ultra-violet) solar photons are inefficiently converted into electricity due to thermalization and front surface recombination. A possible route towards the efficiency increase is to make use of spectral shaper layers, which are add-on devices that can be combined with solar cells in order to transform the solar spectrum into a range optimal for efficient conversion by the cell. This dissertation focuses on the investigation of Si nanocrystals for the purpose of being used in these spectral shapers. The nano-scale dimensions of the Si particles increase their interaction potential with light due to quantum confinement. As a result, changes are induced in (among others) the bandstructure, transition strength and the electron-photon coupling. By making use of the bandgap tunability of Si nanocrystals that arises from quantum confinement, the problem of front surface recombination can be completely surmounted; a result that can in principle also be obtained without the use of nano-materials. In contrast, Si nanocrystals might be able to circumvent the thermalization losses as well, by efficient dipole-dipole interactions between proximal nanocrystals...|$|R
40|$|The main {{aim of the}} {{research}} was to determine how children’s physical fitness development is related to age, gender, and certain environmental factors at the onset of puberty. The research was carried out on a representative sample of 897 children (47. 9 % females and 52. 1 % males) aged eleven and fourteen. Twelve tests were used to assess their physical fitness. Based on the duration of the physical activities, the children were divided into four categories: inactive, occasionally active, active and highly active. In the case of paternal education and maternal education, the children were classified into three categories: low, average and high. Considering their school grades in mathematics, the children were divided into three groups: less successful, successful and very successful. In the case of their place of residence, the children were divided into three groups: urban, suburban and rural. A component model of factor analysis was used to identify their basic coordinate system of physical fitness. To solve the problem of the integration of physical fitness into environmental factors, age and gender, a factorial analysis of variance was used. The results show that most of the differences in physical fitness can mainly be explained through age and gender. We can conclude that the significant factors to physical fitness development are growth, development and the maturation rate of individuals, which are predominantly hereditarily determined. Place of residence, physical activity, school grades and parental education have less influence on physical fitness development and serve only as an <b>additional</b> <b>impulse</b> to further stimulate or inhibit the physical development of children...|$|R

As Frederick Trent himself, utterly regardless of his sister, had this object at heart, only second to the hope of gain, it seemed to him the more likely to be Quilp's main principle of action. Once investing the dwarf with a design of his own in abetting them, which the attainment of their purpose would serve, it was easy to believe him sincere and hearty in the cause; and as there could be no doubt of his proving a powerful and useful auxiliary, Trent determined to accept his invitation and go to his house that night, and if what he said and did confirmed him in the impression he had formed, to let him share the labour of their plan, but not the profit.|$|R

When working as a generator, the linear Faraday MHD converter was efficient enough, due to high electrical conductivity (3000 S/m) to create a front shock wave at the intake of the constant cross-section MHD converter. Accelerations up to 5000 m/s were obtained in 10 cm long channels. This suggested the possibility to achieve complete shock wave and turbulent wake cancellation, through MHD bypass concept. Such work gave publications in peer-reviewed journals and presentation in international MHD meetings (French Academy of Sciences 1970, Moscow 1983, Tsukuba 1986, Beijing 1992). The work was conducted both through computational simulations (based on the method of characteristics) and hydraulic simulation experiments. We present the synthesis of such studies through a project of a hypersonic vehicle based on an MHD bypass concept, landing under its own steam, using classical turbojets. Then, at Mach 3 and high altitude, MHD controlled inlets are opened. A wall converter slows down the hypersonic incoming air flow, without excessive heating, feeding a ramjet system.
