5|$|Cooley {{was born}} in Maryland, but little else is known about his life prior to 1813, {{when he arrived in}} East Florida, a {{province}} of Spanish Florida, as part of a military expedition. He established himself as a farmer {{in the northern part of}} the province before moving south, where he traded with local Indians and continued to farm. During the period in which the region was transferred from Spanish to U.S. governance, he sided with natives in a land dispute against a merchant who had received a large grant from the King of Spain and was evicting the Indians from their lands. Unhappy with the actions of the Spanish, he moved to the New River area in 1826 to get as far <b>as</b> <b>possible</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Spanish influence.|$|E
5|$|With only 4:25 {{remaining}} and a lead well in hand, Stanford {{began running}} down the clock by executing running plays, which keep the game clock running {{as long as the}} ball carrier is downed in the field of play. Three rushes gained Stanford 16yards, but the effectiveness of this strategy was undermined by a 15-yard personal foul penalty against Stanford that prevented the Cardinal from gaining a first down. Stanford also accepted a delay of game penalty in order to squeeze as much time <b>as</b> <b>possible</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> clock before punting back to Virginia Tech. The final drive of the game began from the Tech 11-yard line with 2:10 remaining, and quarterback Taylor controlled the ball on all of its five plays. Taylor completed a five-yard pass to Coale, then ran for 18yards and a first down. He was then sacked for a 15-yard loss, but gained much of that back with an 11-yard run. On the game's final play, Taylor completed a 17-yard first-down pass to Wilson, who was tackled as the last second ticked off the clock and Stanford clinched a 40–12 victory.|$|E

Depending on how much time has elapsed since ingestion of the drug, this may be accomplished through gastric lavage (stomach pumping) or use of activated charcoal. Hemodialysis is effective in removing phenobarbital from the body, and may reduce its half-life by up to 90%. No specific antidote for barbiturate poisoning is available.|$|E

The American-led Northern Combat Area Command, consisting mainly of Chinese troops, would continue its advance to link up with Chinese armies attacking from Yunnan province in south-west China and thus complete the Ledo Road linking China and India.

25|$|Something of Hampden's fame {{no doubt}} is {{owing to the}} {{position}} which he took up as the opponent of ship money.

25|$|Even {{with his}} {{expulsion}} from the Senate, Flamininus remained {{popular with the}} people of Rome. Initially, once news of his removal had gotten around, a contio (public meeting) was held to discuss the matter, where Cato gave a speech, defending his actions in expelling Flamininus. Flamininus refused Cato’s offer to vindicate himself by means of a sponsio. On one occasion, when he attended the theatre, he sat himself as far away <b>as</b> <b>possible</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> seats reserved for the senators.

25|$|After his demise, Sri Lanka {{gradually}} decayed in power. In AD 1215, Kalinga Magha, a South Indian with uncertain origins, {{identified as}} {{the founder of the}} Jaffna kingdom, invaded and captured the Kingdom of Polonnaruwa. He sailed from Kalinga 690 nautical miles on 100 large ships with a 24,000 strong army. Unlike previous invaders, he looted, ransacked, and destroyed everything in the ancient Anuradhapura and Polonnaruwa Kingdoms beyond recovery. His priorities in ruling were to extract as much <b>as</b> <b>possible</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> land and overturn as many of the traditions of Rajarata as possible. His reign saw the massive migration of native Sinhalese people to the south and west of Sri Lanka, and into the mountainous interior, in a bid to escape his power.|$|E

The Graduate College is composed of a large Collegiate Gothic section crowned by Cleveland Tower, a local landmark that also houses a world-class carillon.
