25|$|Several {{streetcar}} {{lines and}} interurban railways interchanged passengers in Georgetown. The station {{was located in}} front of the stone wall on Canal Road (currently occupied by a gas station) adjacent to the Exorcist steps, and the former D.C. Transit car barn {{at the end of the}} Key Bridge. Four suburban Virginia lines, connecting through Rosslyn, Virginia, provided links from the D.C. streetcar network to Mount Vernon, Falls Church, Great Falls, Fairfax, Vienna, Leesburg, and Purcellville. Streetcar operations in Washington, D.C. ended January 28, 1962. The Baltimore and Ohio Railroad built an 11-mile branch line from Silver Spring, Maryland, to Water Street in Georgetown in an abortive attempt to construct a southern connection to Alexandria, Virginia. The line served as an industrial line, shipping coal to a General Services Administration power plant on K Street (now razed) until 1985. The abandoned right-of-way has since been converted into the Capital Crescent Trail – a rails-to-trails route – and the power plant replaced by <b>a</b> <b>condo.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{following}} morning, Kilroy and {{his friends}} had {{more or less a}} daily routine in mind. They went to the beach in the morning and suntanned before lunch. After lunch they went to the beach area behind their hotel for a daily Miss Tanline contest. Once the event was over that afternoon, Kilroy headed to the hotel for a quick nap before planning their trip to Mexico. They left South Padre Island that evening and stopped for dinner at a Sonic Drive-In in Port Isabel, Texas, where they met a group of female students from University of Kansas who were planning to party in Mexico as well. The girls then followed Brent's car from Port Isabel to Brownsville and parked their cars close to the Gateway International Bridge before crossing the U.S.-Mexico border by foot. Kilroy's friends and the Kansas girls spent most of their evening at Sergeant Pepper's night club in Matamoros before the groups went their separate ways. Kilroy {{and his friends}} then returned to South Padre Island early the next morning. On March 13, Kilroy and his friends attended another Miss Tanline contest behind the Sheraton. Early in the evening, Kilroy met with one of his former frat brothers at <b>a</b> <b>condo</b> party. At around 10:30p.m. CT, Kilroy and his friends headed back to Matamoros. They parked on the border and crossed by foot again.|$|E

40|$|A {{woman and}} her son fell into sick house {{syndrome}} following the renovation of their condominium (<b>Condo.</b> <b>A)</b> by repainting of exterior walls and corridors. Since their symptoms became exacerbated in the <b>Condo.</b> <b>A,</b> they moved to the other condominium (Condo. B) where their symptoms were mitigated. We measured the concentrations of indoor air chemicals in each condominium, and compared their concentrations within and between condominiums. The order of places where their symptoms were severely exacerbated was the corridor of <b>Condo.</b> <b>A</b> > {{the living room of}} <b>Condo.</b> <b>A</b> > > the living room of Condo. B (no symptoms). Among 97 chemicals determined, concentrations of 3 chemicals,toluene, xylene and ethylbenzene, were paralleled with the order of places where their symptoms got worse. These 3 chemicals were presumably used as solvents of paint to renovate <b>Condo.</b> <b>A,</b> and supposed to trigger their symptoms. This study shows that even the renovation of exterior walls should be paid more attention to prevent sick house syndrome...|$|R

2500|$|The {{cooperative}} form can be advantageous as {{a building}} mortgage {{can be carried}} by the cooperative corporation, leaving less financing to be obtained by each co-op owner. [...] Under condominium ownership only the separate condo owners provide financing. [...] Particularly when interest rates are high, a conversion sponsor may find unit buyers more easily under the cooperative arrangement as buyers will have less financing to arrange on their own; [...] the apparent purchase price of a unit in a cooperative building holding an underlying mortgage is lower than <b>a</b> <b>condo</b> purchase. [...] Cooperative unit buyers may not accurately weigh {{their share of the}} building's mortgage.|$|E
2500|$|In 1999, Buchanan was {{approached}} {{to help to}} finance the Ritz-Carlton condo-hotel development in Sarasota. Buchanan was cut out of the project. The developers, Robert Buford and Kevin Daves, said he lied about his financial means. Buchanan sued and the parties settled in 2001. Per a structured settlement, Buchanan bought <b>a</b> <b>condo</b> from a nephew of Buford's for $5 million; the nephew had purchased it the day before for $2.368 million. Buchanan owned the unit {{a little more than a}} year and then sold it to another member of Buford's family for $6.35 million. [...] The arrangement resulted in Buchanan paying taxes on his gain at the reduced long-term capital gains rate. Buford benefited from the apartment's increased appraised value and the use of Buchanan's $5 million. In the year he owned the penthouse, Buchanan used it for charity fundraisers.|$|E
