5|$|After {{the decades}} of {{political}} disappointments, the February Revolution offered the Finnish Social Democrats momentum for power; they held the absolute majority in the Parliament. The conservatives were <b>alarmed</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> continuous increase of the socialists' might since 1899, with the climax in 1917 without the offsetting control of Russian administration; the Social Democrats had to be halted before {{they were able to}} markedly alter the power structure.|$|E
5|$|<b>Alarmed</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Georgian successes, Süleymanshah II, the resurgent Seljuqid {{sultan of}} Rûm, rallied his vassal emirs and marched against Georgia, but his camp was {{attacked}} and destroyed by David Soslan at the Battle of Basian in 1203 or 1204. The chronicler of Tamar {{describes how the}} army was assembled at the rock-hewn town of Vardzia before marching on to Basian and how the queen addressed the troops from the balcony of the church.|$|E

5|$|In Great Britain, Lord Hillsborough, who had {{recently}} been appointed to the newly created office of Colonial Secretary, was <b>alarmed</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> actions of the Massachusetts House. In April 1768 he {{sent a letter to}} the colonial governors in America, instructing them to dissolve the colonial assemblies if they responded to the Massachusetts Circular Letter. He also ordered Massachusetts Governor Francis Bernard to direct the Massachusetts House to rescind the letter. The house refused to comply.|$|E
5|$|The Senate, <b>alarmed</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> size of {{the revolt}} and {{the defeat of the}} praetorian armies of Glaber and Varinius, {{dispatched}} a pair of consular legions under the command of Lucius Gellius Publicola and Gnaeus Cornelius Lentulus Clodianus. Initially, the consular armies were successful. Gellius engaged a group of about 30,000 slaves, under the command of Crixus, near Mount Garganus and killed two-thirds of the rebels, including Crixus himself.|$|E
5|$|Though <b>alarmed</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> {{election}} of Abraham Lincoln in the {{election of}} 1860, Hawes was an opponent of secession, supporting instead the idea of armed neutrality. In May 1861, Hawes, Breckinridge, and Kentucky governor Beriah Magoffin represented the Southern Rights viewpoint at a convention to decide Kentucky's course in the Civil War. He attended another such convention in September 1861. Neither convention produced a conclusive decision.|$|E
50|$|It {{began with}} a survey. Through surveys on {{tolerance}} conducted periodically <b>by</b> <b>the</b> LSI, Denny JA noticed a disturbing trend over the previous seven years towards increasing intolerance and willingness of the Indonesian people to use violence to solve issues. This fact was made more <b>alarming</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> growing number of discriminatory state regulations in certain regions of Indonesia.|$|R

50|$|There {{was another}} {{unlikely}} convict—the church bell {{that was used}} to start <b>the</b> <b>alarm.</b> <b>By</b> <b>the</b> order of Catherine II, an executor cut the tang from the bell. For more than thirty years, the silent bell hung on the bell tower. Eventually, in 1803, it was removed and sent to the Arsenal and, in 1821, to the Kremlin Armoury.|$|R
5|$|<b>Alarmed</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> FBI's presence, Zero visits Oswald at {{his home}} that night; a drunk and rowdy Oswald dismisses Zero's worries and summons {{lightning}} to strike down nearby cattle. The lightning strikes him instead, but he appears unharmed. The next day, the agents visit the scene and find a melted shoe print in the ground, linking it to Oswald. Meanwhile, Oswald uses his abilities to manipulate local traffic lights, causing a car accident. The agents visit Oswald's home and find a cut-out picture of Sharon Kiveat, Oswald's former high school teacher, inside a porn magazine.|$|E
5|$|<b>Alarmed</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> {{raids on}} St Nazaire and Dieppe in 1942, Hitler ordered the {{construction}} of fortifications all along the Atlantic coast, from Spain to Norway, to protect against an expected Allied invasion. He envisioned 15,000 emplacements manned by 300,000 troops, but due to shortages, particularly of concrete and manpower, most of the strongpoints were never built. As the expected site of an Allied invasion, Pas de Calais was heavily defended. In the Normandy area the best fortifications were concentrated at the port facilities at Cherbourg and Saint-Malo.|$|E
5|$|<b>Alarmed</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> rapid {{collapse}} of the KPA, China's Chairman Mao Zedong ordered the People's Liberation Army's North East Frontier Force to be reorganized into the People's Volunteer Army (PVA) for the upcoming intervention in Korea. Despite Mao's determination to save North Korea from capitulation, the Chinese military leadership expressed doubts {{on the ability of}} the Chinese army to fight against the more modernized US forces. As a compromise, Mao authorized the First Phase Campaign, a bridgehead building operation with limited offensives against only the South Korean forces while avoiding contacts with the US forces. Under strict secrecy, the PVA entered Korea on 19 October.|$|E

5|$|At {{the same}} time, conservationists became <b>alarmed</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> damage overgrazing, logging, and {{unregulated}} visitation were having on the fragile features of Bryce Canyon. A movement {{to have the}} area protected was soon started, and National Park Service Director Stephen Mather responded by proposing that Bryce Canyon {{be made into a}} state park. The governor of Utah and the Utah State Legislature, however, lobbied for national protection of the area. Mather relented and sent his recommendation to President Warren G. Harding, who on June 8, 1923 declared Bryce Canyon a national monument.|$|E
5|$|The Americans were <b>alarmed</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Japanese buildup, {{which was}} {{accurately}} tracked through Ultra intelligence. Secretary of War Henry L. Stimson was sufficiently concerned about high American estimates of probable casualties to commission his own study by Quincy Wright and William Shockley. Wright and Shockley spoke with Colonels James McCormack and Dean Rusk, and examined casualty forecasts by Michael E. DeBakey and Gilbert Beebe. Wright and Shockley estimated the invading Allies would suffer between 1.7 and 4million casualties {{in such a}} scenario, of whom between 400,000 and 800,000 would be dead, while Japanese fatalities would have been around 5 to 10 million.|$|E
5|$|The {{inhabitants}} of San Salvador, <b>alarmed</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> uprising engulfing the region, responded {{by sending a}} great quantity of weapons, armour, gunpowder, and other supplies to Montejo in Honduras. One hundred Indian auxiliaries were also sent, with one thousand native porters. Further supplies were forthcoming from the embattled residents of San Miguel. By the end of 1538, Lempira's stronghold had been taken by the Spanish, and Montejo crossed from Honduras to San Miguel to assist in putting down continued indigenous resistance in the district.|$|E
50|$|The {{presence}} {{of women in}} Iranian intellectual movements (science, modern literature, cinema, human-rights activism, etc.) has been remarkable {{throughout the history of}} modern Iran. According to the research ministry of Iran, women accounted for 56% of all university students in the natural sciences, including one in five Ph.D. students. Such education and social trends are increasingly viewed with <b>alarm</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Iranian government.|$|R

5000|$|As of 2006, women {{account for}} well {{over half of the}} {{university}} students in Iran and 70% of Iran's science and engineering students. Such education and social trends are increasingly viewed with <b>alarm</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Iranian conservatives groups. [...] A report <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Research Center of <b>the</b> Majlis (controlled <b>by</b> conservatives) warned that the large female enrollment could cause [...] "social disparity and economic and cultural imbalances between men and women." ...|$|R

As it was expected to be the site of the invasion, the Pas de Calais was heavily defended. In the Normandy area, the best fortifications were concentrated at the port facilities at Cherbourg and Saint-Malo. Rommel was assigned to oversee the construction of further fortifications along the expected invasion front, which stretched from the Netherlands to Cherbourg, and was given command of the newly re-formed Army Group B, which included the 7th Army, the 15th Army, and the forces guarding the Netherlands. Reserves for this group included the 2nd, 21st, and 116th Panzer divisions.|$|E
5|$|Argentina {{was highly}} <b>alarmed</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Brazilian move, and they quickly moved to nullify the {{remaining}} {{months of the}} naval-limiting restrictions in the 1902 pact with Chile. In November 1906, Argentina's Minister of Foreign Affairs, , remarked that {{any one of the}} new Brazilian vessels could destroy the entire Argentine and Chilean fleets. Despite the seeming hyperbole, his statement—made before the Brazilian government reordered the ships as dreadnoughts—ended up being close to the truth: in 1910, at least, the new Brazilian warships were seemingly stronger than any other vessel in the world, let alone any one ship in the Argentine or Chilean fleets. With this in mind, the Journal of the American Society of Naval Engineers opined that maintaining the older Libertad class or Capitán Prat (respectively) was now a waste of money.|$|E
5|$|Having seized Emesa, the Muslims {{were just}} a march away from Aleppo, a Byzantine stronghold, and Antioch, where Heraclius resided. Seriously <b>alarmed</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> series of setbacks, Heraclius {{prepared}} for a counterattack to reacquire the lost regions. In 635 Yazdegerd III, the Emperor of Persia, sought an alliance with the Byzantine Emperor. Heraclius married off his daughter (according to traditions, his grand daughter) Manyanh to Yazdegerd III, to cement the alliance. While Heraclius prepared for a major offensive in the Levant, Yazdegerd was to mount a simultaneous counterattack in Iraq, in what {{was meant to be}} a well-coordinated effort. When Heraclius launched his offensive in May 636, Yazdegerd could not coordinate with the maneuver—probably owing to the exhausted condition of his government—and what would have been a decisive plan missed the mark.|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} to this there are several unverifiable legends regarding Scots Dumpies. One of which relates to their use as ambush <b>alarms</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Celts and Picts, and the claim {{that it was the}} bird’s superior hearing that enabled them to hear attackers responses to stepping on thistles, which in turn led to thistles being adopted as a Scottish emblem.

25|$|In Guangxi and Guangdong, the Vietnamese revolutionaries {{arranged}} {{alliances with}} <b>the</b> Kuomintang <b>by</b> marrying Vietnamese women to Chinese officers. Their children were at an advantage since they could speak both languages and they worked as agents for the revolutionaries and spread revolutionary ideologies across borders. This intermarriage between Chinese and Vietnamese was viewed with <b>alarm</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> French. Phan's revolutionary network practiced this extensively; additionally, Chinese merchants also married Vietnamese women, and provided funds and help.|$|R
5|$|He {{returned}} to Romania on an official visit in late 1946-early 1947, {{as part of}} a tour of the emerging Eastern Bloc during which he also stopped in Czechoslovakia, Hungary, and the Federal People's Republic of Yugoslavia. The speeches he and Sașa Pană gave on the occasion, published by Orizont journal, were noted for condoning official positions of the PCF and the Romanian Communist Party, and are credited by Irina Livezeanu with causing a rift between Tzara and young Romanian avant-gardists such as Victor Brauner and Gherasim Luca (who rejected communism and were <b>alarmed</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Iron Curtain having fallen over Europe). In September of the same year, he was present at the conference of the pro-communist International Union of Students (where he was a guest of the French-based Union of Communist Students, and met with similar organizations from Romania and other countries).|$|E
5|$|In Kaga, a {{civil war}} had broken out between Togashi Masachika and Kochiyo Masachika {{for control of the}} {{position}} of shugo over the province. Kochiyo was victorious against his brother and drove him out of Kaga. When the Ōnin War began in 1467, Masachika sided with the Hosokawa clan, while Kochiyo sided with the Yamana. Kochiyo also patronized Takada school of Jōdo Shinshū, a fierce rival of the Hongan-ji school of which Rennyo was head. Masachika, seeking to reclaim his land, reached out to the Ikkō-ikki and asked for their support. In exchange, he promised to end their religious persecution and lift them out of poverty. The priests in Yoshizaki agreed to aid Masachika, and Rennyo, though <b>alarmed</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> rebellious attitude of the rebels, tacitly rendered his support as well. Asakura Toshikage, the ruler of Echizen and ally of the Hosokawa, also lent his support. Kochiyo was defeated, and Masachika restored to power.|$|E
5|$|Lawrence was <b>alarmed</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Soviet Union's first {{nuclear test}} in August 1949. The proper response, he concluded, was an all-out {{effort to build}} a bigger nuclear weapon: the {{hydrogen}} bomb. Lawrence proposed to use accelerators instead of nuclear reactors to produce the neutrons needed to create the tritium the bomb required, as well as plutonium, which was more difficult, as much higher energies would be required. He first proposed the construction of Mark I, a prototype $7 million, 25 MeV linear accelerator, codenamed Materials Test Accelerator (MTA). He was soon talking about a new, even larger MTA known as the Mark II, which could produce tritium or plutonium from depleted uranium-238. Serber and Segré attempted in vain to explain the technical problems that made it impractical, but Lawrence {{felt that they were}} being unpatriotic.|$|E
