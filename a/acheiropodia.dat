50|$|<b>Acheiropodia</b> (ACHP), {{also known}} as Horn-Kolb Syndrome, Acheiropody and Aleijadinhos (Brazilian type), is an {{autosomal}} recessive disorder that results in hemimelia, a lack of formation of the distal extremities.|$|E

40|$|<b>Acheiropodia</b> is an {{autosomal}} recessive disease {{that results in}} hemimelia (lack of formation of the distal extremities). We performed a complete genome screen of seven members of an extended pedigree that included three siblings with <b>acheiropodia.</b> Homozygosity mapping was used to identify regions most likely to harbor the gene for <b>acheiropodia</b> in this pedigree. In these two key regions (14 p and 7 q), further genotyping of one additional affected member of this pedigree plus seven additional unaffected siblings provided evidence, through linkage analysis, that the 7 q 36 region contains the <b>acheiropodia</b> gene. In this region, a maximum two-point LOD score of 3. 81 (4. 2 with multipoint analysis) was achieved, and a homozygous haplotype spanning a region of 11. 7 cM was seen in all affected in this pedigree. Finally, genotypic analysis of two additional cases of <b>acheiropodia</b> with no known relation to the other samples revealed homozygous sharing of {{a portion of the}} same haplotype on 7 q 36, which reduces the chromosomal location of the <b>acheiropodia</b> gene to an 8. 6 -cM region. Localization of this gene, at the screening level, by use of data from only three affected subjects, provides an example of how certain genes may be mapped by use of a minimal number of affected cases...|$|E
40|$|<b>Acheiropodia</b> is an {{autosomal}} recessive developmental disorder presenting with bilateral congenital amputations {{of the upper}} and lower extremities and aplasia of the hands and feet. This severely handicapping condition appears to affect only the extremities, with no other systemic manifestations reported. Recently, a locus for <b>acheiropodia</b> was mapped on chromosome 7 q 36. Herein we report the narrowing of the critical region for the <b>acheiropodia</b> gene and the subsequent identification of a common mutation in C 7 orf 2 -the human orthologue of the mouse Lmbr 1 gene-that is responsible for the disease. Analysis of five families with <b>acheiropodia,</b> by means of 15 polymorphic markers, narrowed the critical region to 1. 3 cM, on the basis of identity by descent, and to < 0. 5 Mb, on the basis of physical mapping. Analysis of C 7 orf 2, the human orthologue of the mouse Lmbr 1 gene, identified a deletion in all five families, thus identifying a common <b>acheiropodia</b> mutation. The deletion was identified at both the genomic-DNA and mRNA level. It leads to the production of a C 7 orf 2 transcript lacking exon 4 and introduces a premature stop codon downstream of exon 3. Given the nature of the <b>acheiropodia</b> phenotype, it appears likely that the Lmbr 1 gene {{plays an important role in}} limb development...|$|E
40|$|Background <b>Acheiropodia</b> {{is a rare}} form of {{skeletal}} dysplasias. It {{is characterized}} by the amputation of the upper and lower extremities and with aplasia of the hands and feet. <b>Acheiropodia</b> formerly was known as a disease affecting only people of Brazilian ancestry. The first case out of Brazil was reported from our clinic in 2012. In the present report, we summarize the second case of <b>acheiropodia,</b> which was diagnosed prenatally in the same patient. Case A 39 years old G 7 P 2 A 4 pregnant woman admitted to our clinic for a regular obstetrics visit at 16 th weeks gestation in May 2013. Her history was significant for early pregnancy oligohydramnios with fetal loss. In the post-abortion examination, the fetus was found to be affected with <b>acheiropodia.</b> Since she had a history of <b>acheiropodia</b> a detailed ultrasound examination was performed. The fetal head and body including the intra-cranial, thoracic and abdominal structures were normal; however, distal long bones of the upper and the lower extremities could not be demonstrated. Three days later she was admitted with vaginal bleeding. Post abortion macroscopic examination revealed the absence of distal parts of the both upper and lower extremities without any other demonstrable anomalies. Conclusion <b>Acheiropodia</b> is a rare disease which may be seen outside of South America. Evaluation of the continuity and normal appearance of the extremities should be integrated to the routine antenatal ultrasound examination...|$|E
40|$|A genetic {{analysis}} is presented {{of data from}} 22 Brazilian sibships with cases of <b>acheiropodia</b> (the handless and footless families of Brazil). Segregation analysis performed using a 16 K CDC 3100 computer showed a segregation frequency of. 245 +/-. 040, which {{is close to the}} expected value of. 25. No sporadic cases were detected. The ascertainment of the probands was through multiple incomplete selection (pi =. 55 +/-. 07). The data are consistent with the hypothesis of an extremely rare autosomal recessive gene as the etiological factor in <b>acheiropodia.</b> Prevalence is estimated as 29 +/- 4, which {{is the same as the}} number of high risk cases; gene frequency equals. 0009 +/-. 0005, and the incidence at birth is 4 times 10 (- 6) by the indirect method or 7 times 10 (- 6) by the direct method. The frequency of heterozygotes at birth is assumed to be 0. 18 % (450 times the frequency of affected). Population size is approximately 10 million, and the number of founders on a unique-mutation hypothesis is estimated as about 500. All these estimates are first approximations and must be accepted with caution...|$|E
40|$|Since {{carriers}} of the <b>acheiropodia</b> gene cannot {{be distinguished from}} noncarriers, parents and normal sibs of affected individuals {{have been used to}} estimate the fitness of heterozygotes. No significant difference in biologic fitness (viability and fertility) between normal sibs and the general population could be detected. A comparison between acheiropods and their normal sibs showed the following: (1) a nonsignificant difference in stillbirth rate; (2) a higher mortality rate of acheiropods in the first 5 years of life; (3) a relative viability not larger than. 7; (4) a relative fertility no greater than. 14, due to "cosmetic effects"; and (5) a fitness of. 10 or lower. The total number of <b>acheiropodia</b> genes in Brazil has been calculated as 25, 000 in the 1970 s. The data are compatible with an extremely low mutation rate and a very stable locus. It is suggested that all Brazilian acheiropods can be traced to a single mutation. A conservative estimate of the number of acheiropods to appear in the future in Brazil is 14, 000 with an extinction time of no less than 2, 300 generations or almost 70, 000 years. A variety of other parameters have been calculated...|$|E
40|$|A {{series of}} {{deformities}} in the rabbit ranging from brachydactylia to <b>acheiropodia</b> have been described. Experimental breeding {{demonstrated that the}} occurrence of the deformities was determined by simple recessive hereditary factors and that the various types were genetically related and were not distinct hereditary entities. Embryological investigation showed the first abnormal change was a dilatation of blood vessels in affected buds. This was followed by hemorrhage and necrosis of the parts involved. Sloughing subsequently occurred, and the deformity was completely expressed by the 25 th day of fetal life...|$|E
