5|$|The {{conflict}} between civilization and barbarism mirrors Latin America's {{difficulties in the}} post-Independence era. Literary critic Sorensen Goodrich argues that although Sarmiento {{was not the first}} to articulate this dichotomy, he forged it into a powerful and prominent theme that would impact Latin American literature. He explores the issue of civilization versus the cruder aspects of a caudillo culture of brutality and absolute power. Facundo set forth an oppositional message that promoted a more beneficial alternative for society at large. Although Sarmiento advocated various changes, such <b>as</b> <b>honest</b> officials who understood enlightenment ideas of European and Classical origin, for him education was the key.|$|E
5|$|In the 20th century, feminist critics {{opened up}} new {{approaches}} to Gertrude and Ophelia. New Historicist and cultural materialist critics examined the play in its historical context, attempting to piece together its original cultural environment. They focused on the gender system of early modern England, pointing to the common trinity of maid, wife, or widow, with whores outside of that stereotype. In this analysis, the essence of Hamlet is the central character's changed perception of his mother as a whore because of her failure to remain faithful to Old Hamlet. In consequence, Hamlet loses his faith in all women, treating Ophelia as if she too were a whore and dishonest with Hamlet. Ophelia, by some critics, can be seen <b>as</b> <b>honest</b> and fair; however, {{it is virtually impossible}} to link these two traits, since 'fairness' is an outward trait, while 'honesty' is an inward trait.|$|E

It won {{many of the}} major {{categories}} in the New Zealand television awards for its first 4 years, with Malcolm's performance warmly recognised by most New Zealand reviewers. Following the show's success, Outrageous Fortune received worldwide interest and in 2008 was adapted for United Kingdom television <b>as</b> <b>Honest</b> and again in 2010 for United States residents as Scoundrels, neither of which were renewed after their debut seasons.|$|E
25|$|Parasitism {{has been}} {{suggested}} {{as part of the}} explanation of the evolution of secondary sex characteristics in breeding male animals, such as the plumage of peacocks and the manes of male lions. The argument is that female hosts select males for breeding based on such characteristics because they act <b>as</b> <b>honest</b> signals of costly handicaps. A possible mechanism for this, suggested by Ivar Folstad and Andrew Karter, is that the male hormone testosterone encourages the growth of secondary sex characteristics such as manes, but at the price of reducing an animal's immune defences.|$|E
25|$|Unfortunately, at the Storybrooke Sheriff station, {{it turns}} out King Arthur is not <b>as</b> <b>honest</b> as he seems; {{he found out that}} the heroes lied to him about Emma was the Dark One when they first entered Camelot and lied about the magic bean. Additionally, he has {{sinister}} plans to turn Storybrooke into the New Camelot, and believes that it is now impossible to return to their former realm. It's also revealed that Grif was a minion of Arthur, and in order to make sure that no one finds out his plans, Arthur convinces the squire to drink a vial of Agrabah Doom Viper poison. Grif does just that and disappears.|$|E

CTO Thuan Pham had knowledge of Susan Fowler's sexual harassment allegation at Uber and her manager's threatened retaliation, and did nothing; Kalanick was also reportedly aware of the harassment issues. Uber hired former attorney general Eric Holder to investigate the claims. Arianna Huffington, a member of Uber's board of directors, also oversaw the investigation. On February 20, 2017, Kalanick led a meeting with employees that was described by the participants <b>as</b> <b>honest</b> and raw.|$|E
25|$|If, therefore, in the {{following}} pages I fall into any errors, I hope they will be dealt with <b>as</b> <b>honest</b> mistakes, and not as indicating that I have forgotten our ancient motto. This event took place {{at a time when}} the Highlanders, according to Macaulay, were much like the Cape Caffres , and any one, it was said, could escape punishment for cattle-stealing by presenting a share of the plunder to his chieftain. Our ancestors were Roman Catholics; they were made Protestants by the laird coming round with a man having a yellow staff, which would seem to have attracted more attention than his teaching, for the new religion went long afterward, perhaps it does so still, by the name of “the religion of the yellow stick”.|$|E
25|$|With a {{political}} marriage arranged by Jessica between Ghanima and Wensicia's son Farad'n, the Corrino heir identifies his mother as the mastermind behind Leto's apparent death. Alia has Wensicia imprisoned, but Ghanima accepts Farad'n's gesture <b>as</b> <b>honest.</b> With Stilgar's forces moving in, {{father and son}} return to {{the capital city of}} Arrakeen, where the Preacher makes a final speech denouncing Alia and his own religion, and is fatally stabbed by a rebel Fremen. Leto confronts Alia at Ghanima's wedding and defeats her. Alia then commits suicide rather than be controlled by the Baron. In the final scene, Ghanima tells Farad'n that while he will not be her husband, they may yet fall in love, and how she pities her brother for the pain and suffering he will endure in the long life he must expect.|$|E

25|$|Nine of {{the sons}} {{returned}} to their father Israel from Egypt, stockpiled with grain on their donkeys. They relayed to their father all that had happened in Egypt. They spoke of being accused of as spies and that their brother Simeon, had been taken prisoner. When Reuben, the eldest, mentioned {{that they needed to}} bring Benjamin to Egypt to prove their word <b>as</b> <b>honest</b> men, their father became furious with them. He couldn't understand how they were put in a position to tell the Egyptians all about their family. When the sons of Israel opened their sacks, they saw their money that they used to pay for the grain. It was still in their possession, and so they all became afraid. Israel then became angry with the loss of Joseph, Simeon, and now possibly Benjamin.|$|E
25|$|England {{aboard the}} Mary and John {{with a party}} of 140 emigrants who had been {{gathered}} chiefly from South West England. It {{was one of many}} Pilgrims of the Puritan movement that fled England to escape religious persecution. After a 70-day journey the party arrived at Massachusetts Bay colony in Nantasket, on May 30, 1630, and soon moved to and settled in Windsor, Connecticut. Matthew, referred to by the town folk <b>as</b> <b>Honest</b> Matthew Grant, was a highly trusted member of the community and became a surveyor and the town clerk. Later generations of the extended Grant family migrated westward into Pennsylvania, Ohio and Kentucky. Jesse's grandfather Noah Grant, and his brother Solomon, fought and died in the French and Indian War, and his son, (Jesse's father) also named Noah, served in the American Revolution, including the Battle of Bunker Hill, soon advancing to the rank of Captain.|$|E
25|$|In 1955 Krätschmer {{published}} the book Rtterkreuzträger der Waffen-SS. Featuring a foreword by Paul Hausser, formerly {{one of the}} highest ranking commanders of the Waffen-SS, Krätschmer's work was one of the earliest attempts to shape a positive image of the Waffen-SS after the war. Historians note that Krätschmer uncitically presented perpetrators like Erich von dem Bach-Zelewski, Oskar Dirlewanger, Theodor Eicke, Curt von Gottberg and Bruno Streckenbach <b>as</b> <b>honest</b> soldiers and claimed that war criminals like Walter Reder, Fritz Knöchlein, Bernhard Siebken and Jochen Peiper were victims of victor's justice. On persons who had been actively and decisively involved in the planning and execution of the Nazi policy of extermination, like Friedrich Jeckeln, Friedrich Wilhelm Krüger, Streckenbach and Dirlewanger, only basic biographical data were given. Jens Westemeier points to erroneous claims by Krätschmer about Jochen Peiper's career, by which Peiper's involvement with Heinrich Himmler was minimized, and to Krätschmer's denial of war crimes.|$|E

500|$|Critics {{at first}} {{compared}} Stelmach to Harry Strom, the last Social Credit premier of the province. [...] Strom was regarded <b>as</b> <b>honest</b> but ineffective and lacking charisma; he survived {{only long enough}} as Premier to lose the 1971 election soundly. Thus ended the last long one-party rule, and observers asked if history would repeat with Stelmach. After Stelmach's landslide win in the 2008 election, however, the comparisons largely ceased.|$|E
500|$|Within a {{few days}} of his victory, Driberg left for the Far East, to report on the {{conditions}} of the allied troops in Burma. The Supreme Allied Commander, Lord Mountbatten, knew him slightly and made him an unofficial temporary special adviser. In this role he met the Patriotic Burmese Forces leader, Aung San, who impressed him <b>as</b> <b>honest</b> and incorruptible, [...] "unlike some of the older Burmese politicians". Later, he visited Saigon and offered to mediate with Ho Chi Minh, who had recently declared an independent [...] Vietnam [...] state. Driberg later maintained that, had his offer been taken up, he might have prevented the Vietnam War.|$|E

[...] Despite this, other interviews with Lennon report him as being loyal to Epstein's memory: [...] "We had complete faith in {{him when he was}} running us. To us, he was the expert". When asked in 1964 about his standing as a manager or businessman, Epstein replied, [...] "Fair, as a businessman, fair. I've got a business background, and probably a reasonable business brain. I'm no, sort of, genius [...]" [...] Asked about his deficiencies, Epstein replied, [...] "I'm probably too conscious of ideas, rather than finance behind ideas." ...|$|E
500|$|By {{the time}} the Democrats had {{assembled}} in Chicago on July 8, 1884 to begin their convention, the Republicans had already picked their nominee: James G. Blaine of Maine. [...] Blaine's nomination turned many reform-minded Republicans (known as Mugwumps) away from their party. [...] Bayard and Cleveland, seen <b>as</b> <b>honest</b> politicians, were the Democrats most favored by the renegade Republican faction. [...] Bayard was optimistic {{at the start of}} the convention, but the results of the first ballot ran heavily against him: 170 votes to Cleveland's 392. [...] The reason was the same as in 1880: as Congressman Robert S. Stevens of New York said, [...] "I believe if he were President his Administration would be one in which every American citizen would take pride. I believe he is a patriot, but it would be a suicidal attempt to nominate him. His [...] Dover speech would be sent into every household in the North." [...] The voting the next day demonstrated the point, as Cleveland was nominated on the second ballot.|$|E
500|$|Hill {{was a man}} of high {{ideals and}} was popular with his fellow players. Pelham Warner commented on his {{pleasant}} nature and Robert Trumble, an author and son of Hugh Trumble, recalled him <b>as</b> <b>honest,</b> direct and without guile. [...] An anecdote told about Hill had him hitting a low shot into shadows where Warren Bardsley was fielding. He completed one run and then asked the umpire if the ball had been caught. [...] The shadow made it impossible for the umpire to see, so Hill then asked Bardsley, [...] "Did you catch it?" [...] When Bardsley replied in the affirmative, Hill immediately walked to the pavilion. When England won four Tests in a row in 1911–12, Hill managed to retain the confidence of his players. [...] Frank Iredale wrote that Hill was a cheery skipper whose men were happy under his leadership. Despite breaking many records, Hill showed little awareness of them. [...] When watching Jack Hobbs break his record for the most runs in Test cricket at Headingley in 1926, it was Hobbs' wife sitting nearby who had to remind Hill that the record was previously his.|$|E
