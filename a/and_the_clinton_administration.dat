500|$|This {{case was}} blunted by a 1995 National Intelligence Estimate (NIE), which stated that no country besides the five major nuclear powers {{was capable of}} {{acquiring}} missiles that could reach Canada or the contiguous United States within the ensuing 15 years. Republican lawmakers intent on funding a defensive shield criticized the report <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Clinton</b> <b>administration</b> for inaccurate assessments and distorted intelligence. [...] Republican Congressman Curt Weldon of Pennsylvania walked out of a CIA briefing on the NIE, and later {{said that it was}} [...] "the most outrageous politicisation of an intelligence document that I've seen in the 10 years I've been in Washington." ...|$|E
2500|$|Crucial to {{the passing}} of this Act was an {{amendment}} made to the GLB, stating that no merger may go ahead {{if any of the}} financial holding institutions, or affiliates thereof, received a [...] "less than satisfactory [...] rating at its most recent CRA exam", essentially meaning that any merger may only go ahead with the strict approval of the regulatory bodies responsible for the Community Reinvestment Act (CRA).

2500|$|In {{the fall}} of 1999, Senators Dodd and Schumer {{prevented}} another impasse by securing a compromise between Sen.

The FDIC related provisions of the new Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, along {{with the addition of}} sub-section [...] directly to Title 12, insured any bank holding institution wishing to be re-designated as a financial holding institution by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System would also have to follow Community Reinvestment Act compliance guidelines before any merger or expansion could take effect.|$|E
2500|$|In the 1980s, theorists outside France {{tended to}} focus on globalization, communication, and {{reflexivity}} in terms of a 'second' phase of modernity, rather than a distinct new era per se. Jürgen Habermas established communicative action as a reaction to postmodern challenges to the discourse of modernity, informed both by critical theory and American pragmatism. Fellow German sociologist, Ulrich Beck, presented The Risk Society (1992) as an account of {{the manner in which the}} modern nation state has become organized. In Britain, Anthony Giddens set out to reconcile recurrent theoretical dichotomies through structuration theory. During the 1990s, Giddens developed work on the challenges of [...] "high modernity", as well as a new 'third way' politics that would greatly influence New Labour in U.K. <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Clinton</b> <b>administration</b> in the U.S. Leading Polish sociologist, Zygmunt Bauman, wrote extensively on the concepts of modernity and postmodernity, particularly with regard to the Holocaust and consumerism as historical phenomena. While Pierre Bourdieu gained significant critical acclaim for his continued work on cultural capital, certain French sociologists, particularly Jean Baudrillard and Michel Maffesoli, were criticised for perceived obfuscation and relativism.|$|E
2500|$|Originally begun as the [...] "Alternative Charlemagne Award," [...] {{the honor}} was {{formed as a}} {{counterpoint}} to the Charlemagne Award given to U.S. President Bill Clinton in 2000. Presented in Aachen, Germany, the Charlemagne Award, or Karlspreis, [...] "honors individuals who promote democracy, {{human rights and the}} common values of Europe." [...] The original title of the Leipzig Human Rights Award was so-named as a way of criticizing the relationship between the Church of Scientology <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Clinton</b> <b>Administration,</b> which granted Scientology tax exemption status during Clinton's term in office. [...] The European-American Citizens Committee for Human Rights and Religious Freedom in the USA was formed in 1997, and includes committee members from Germany, the United States, England, Austria, Russia and Sweden. [...] The Committee opposes [...] "physical and psychological abuse of humans under the pretext of religion." [...] The organization notes that their criticism of the United States for [...] "its failure to confront Scientology’s human rights abuses while promoting the cult around the world" [...] has made the Award controversial, and states that all past recipients of the Award have been targeted by the Church of Scientology as Suppressive persons, and subjected to the Church's Fair Game policy. [...] Award recipients do not receive financial compensation as part of the award.|$|E
40|$|The policymakers most {{responsible}} for shaping policy on the Palestinian-Israeli question in both <b>the</b> Bush <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Clinton</b> <b>administrations,</b> {{a team led by}} special mediator Dennis Ross, came of age politically {{at a time when the}} Palestinian perspective was virtually excluded from American political discourse. These policymakers, by their own testimony emotionally involved in Arab-Israeli issues because of their Jewish roots, are naturally inclined to view the issue from the traditional Israel-centered vantage point despite their occasionally harsh criticism of Israel's right-wing government and their vaunted understanding of Palestinian sensibilities. Part III of this series examines how the old frame of reference still determines policy even in an era when Palestinians are seen as legitimate participants in the peace process...|$|R

40|$|To make prudent {{recommendations}} {{for improving the}} use of benefit-cost analysis in policy settings, some measures of how well it is actually done are essential. This article develops new insights on the potential usefulness of government benefit-cost analysis by examining how it is actually performed in the United States. We assess {{the quality of a}} particularly rich sample of benefit-cost analyses of federal regulations. The data set we use for assessing the quality of regulatory analysis is the largest assembled to date for this purpose. The seventy-four analyses we examine span the Reagan administration, the George H. W. Bush <b>administration,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Clinton</b> <b>administrations.</b> <b>The</b> article is the first to assess systematically how government benefit-cost analysis has changed over time. There are three key findings. First, a significant percentage of the analyses in all three administrations does not provide some very basic economic information, such as information on net benefits and policy alternatives. For example, over 70 percent of the analyses in the sample failed to provide any quantitative information on net benefits. Second, there is no clear trend in the quality of benefit-cost analysis across administrations. Third, {{there is a great deal}} of variation in the quality of individual benefit-cost analyses.
