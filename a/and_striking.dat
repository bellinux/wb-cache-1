5|$|In the mid-1920s, New York's {{metropolitan}} area surpassed London's as the world's most populous {{metropolitan area}}. New York City's metropolitan area exceeded ten {{million by the}} early 1930s. The economic boom of the 1920s and the great speculation {{of the real estate}} market fostered a new wave of skyscraper projects in the city. The 1916 Zoning Resolution restricted the height that the street-side exterior walls of New York City buildings could rise before they needed to incorporate setbacks that recessed the buildings' exterior walls away from the streets. This led to the construction of Art Deco structures in New York City with significant setbacks, large volumes, <b>and</b> <b>striking</b> silhouettes that were often decorated elaborately.|$|E

The second {{catching}} opportunity went in the same direction before traveling through Bradman's hand <b>and</b> <b>striking</b> him in the abdomen. However, Johnston eventually snared Evans, who hit a ball strongly, but straight to short leg where Arthur Morris took the catch close in, as England reached 8/74.|$|E

During Koufax's second MLB start, he pitched a shutout, giving up two hits <b>and</b> <b>striking</b> out 14 batters. However, that success did not prompt {{a lot of opportunities}} for Koufax.

5|$|Some {{species of}} Lepidoptera {{sequester}} or manufacture toxins which {{are stored in}} their body tissue, rendering them poisonous to predators; examples include the monarch butterfly in the Americas and Atrophaneura species in Asia. Predators that eat poisonous lepidopterans may become sick and vomit violently, and so learn to avoid those species. A predator who has previously eaten a poisonous lepidopteran may avoid other species with similar markings in the future, thus saving many other species as well. Toxic butterflies and larvae tend to develop bright colours <b>and</b> <b>striking</b> patterns as an indicator to predators about their toxicity. This phenomenon is known as aposematism.|$|E
