50|$|Resistance to {{amikacin}} and kanamycin in Mycobacterium, the causative {{agent of}} tuberculosis, {{is due to}} a mutation in the rrs gene, which codes for the 16S rRNA. Mutations such as these reduce the binding affinity of amikacin to the bacteria's ribosome. Variations of aminoglycoside acetyltransferase (AAC) and aminoglycoside adenylyltransferase (AAD) also confer resistance: resistance in Pseudomonas aeruginosa is caused by AAC(6')-IV, which also confers resistance to kanamycin, gentamicin, and tobramycin, and resistance in Staphylococcus aureus and S. epidermidis is caused by AAD(4',4), which also confers resistance to kanamycin, tobramycin, and <b>apramycin.</b> Some strains of S. aureus can also inactivate amikacin by phosphorylating it.|$|E
40|$|<b>Apramycin</b> is {{a unique}} {{aminoglycoside}} with a dissociation of antibacterial activity and ototoxicity. We assessed the antibacterial efficacy of <b>apramycin</b> in two murine models of infection, Mycobacterium tuberculosis aerosol infection and Staphylococcus aureus septicemia. In both infection models, the efficacy of <b>apramycin</b> was {{comparable to that of}} amikacin. These results suggest that <b>apramycin</b> has the potential to become a clinically useful agent against drug-resistant pathogens and support further development of this promising unique aminoglycoside...|$|E
40|$|Gentamicin-resistant Escherichia coli {{isolated}} {{at different}} periods from patients in two hospitals were tested for {{resistance to the}} aminoglycoside antibiotic <b>apramycin.</b> Twenty-four of 93 (26 %) gentamicin-resistant isolates collected from the Royal Liverpool Hospital between 1981 and 1990 were resistant to <b>apramycin.</b> Thirteen isolates were highly resistant to <b>apramycin</b> (minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) > or = 1024 micrograms/ml), were also resistant to gentamicin, netilmicin and tobramycin, and hybridized with a DNA probe derived from the aminoglycoside acetyltransferase (3) IV (AAC(3) IV) gene. The proportion of gentamicin-resistant isolates which had high level resistance to <b>apramycin</b> increased from 7 % in 1981 - 5 to 24 % in 1986 - 90. Twelve gentamicin-resistant E. coli from Guy's and St Thomas's Hospital isolated between 1977 and 1980 were also tested for resistance to <b>apramycin.</b> For five of these isolates the MICs of <b>apramycin</b> was 32 - 256 micrograms/ml. None was shown to have a conjugative plasmid carrying resistance to <b>apramycin</b> and only one hybridized with the DNA probe for the AAC(3) IV enzyme...|$|E
40|$|Since the {{aminoglycoside}} antibiotic <b>apramycin</b> was licensed {{for veterinary use}} in 1980, all isolates of Escherichia coli and salmonellas {{received at}} the Central Veterinary Laboratory have been monitored for resistance to <b>apramycin</b> and the related antibiotic gentamicin. During the period 1982 - 4, the incidence of resistance in E. coli to <b>apramycin</b> increased from 0. 6 % in 1982 to 2. 6 % in 1984. In salmonellas the incidence of resistance to <b>apramycin</b> increased from 0. 1 % in 1982 to 1. 4 % in 1984. Resistance to both <b>apramycin</b> and gentamicin was detected in six different salmonella serotypes, although an isolate of Salmonella thompson from poultry was resistant to gentamicin but not <b>apramycin.</b> Most of the cultures were isolated from pigs, although the incidence of <b>apramycin</b> resistance in S. typhimurium (DT 204 C) from calves has shown a recent dramatic increase. All the isolates with one exception produced the enzyme aminoglycoside 3 -N-acetyltransferase IV (ACC(3) IV). The resistance was transferable by conjugation {{in most of the}} strains examined, and the plasmids specifying the resistance have been found to belong to a number of different incompatibility groups. Plasmids from three E. coli strains were compatible with all the reference plasmids and belonged to a previously undescribed group which was investigated further. It is suggested that bacteria from humans should be examined for resistance to <b>apramycin</b> and gentamicin to determine the possibility of the antibiotic-resistance bacteria, and their genes, spreading from animals to humans...|$|E
40|$|A {{total of}} 108 21 -day-old pigs, {{weighing}} less than 10 lb, were utilized in two, 28 -day trials {{to compare the}} effects of feeding high nutrient-density diets with either added <b>apramycin,</b> neomycin, or carbadox on pig performance. In Tria 1, pigs fed the diet containing Apralan® gained slightly faster and were more efficient (P<. 05) than pigs fed neomycin during the first 14 days postweaning. There were no differences in pig performance in Trials I or II for the entire 28 -day period. Two additional 28 -day on-farm studies using a total of 427, 21 -day old pigs were conducted, feeding a high nutrient-density diet medicated with either <b>apramycin</b> or neomycin plus terramycin. In both on-farm trials, pigs fed <b>apramycin</b> gained faster (P<. 05) than pigs fed neomycin plus terramycin for the initial 14 days post weaning. In the second on-farm trial, feed intake was higher (P<. 09) during the first 14 days for pigs fed <b>apramycin.</b> Additionally, pigs fed diets medicated with <b>apramycin</b> were slightly heavier (1. 7 and 1. 5 additional pounds {{for the first and}} second on-farm trials, respectively) at 28 days post weaning compared to pigs fed neomycin plus terramycin. These results indicate that <b>apramycin</b> will improve the performance of early-weaned pigs fed high nutrient-density diets compared to other feed medications...|$|E
40|$|Objective To {{establish}} {{a method for}} the determination of <b>apramycin</b> in animal tissues by LC-MS/MS. Methods The residues of <b>apramycin</b> in the test samples were extracted with 5 % trichloroacetic acid solution. After being cleaned up with SPE column, concentrated and reconstituted, the residues were detected by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry under multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) mode via positive-ion mode. Results The method showed a good linearity over the range of 0 ~ 5 mg/L for <b>apramycin</b> with r> 0. 995. The average recoveries were 80. 9 %~ 101 % at three or four spiked levels in animal tissues, and the relative standard deviations were 1. 17 %~ 12. 6 %. The limit of quantitation was 0. 030 mg/kg. Conclusion This method is highly sensitive, accurate and reproducible, and it is suitable {{for the detection of}} <b>apramycin</b> in animal tissues...|$|E
40|$|Twenty-two gentamicin-resistant urinary {{isolates}} of Escherichia coli {{and five}} gentamicin-resistant urinary isolates of Klebsiella pneumoniae from a Dublin hospital were examined for {{resistance to the}} veterinary aminoglycoside antibiotic <b>apramycin.</b> Five isolates of E. coli and one isolate of K. pneumoniae {{were found to be}} resistant. The apramycin-resistant isolates, which were also resistant to the veterinary anthelmintic agent hygromycin B, hybridized with a DNA probe for the gene encoding the enzyme 3 -N-aminoglycoside acetyltransferase type IV (AAC(3) IV). Resistance to <b>apramycin</b> and hygromycin B was co-transferable in four of the five isolates of E. coli and the isolate of K. pneumoniae. In one isolate of E. coli <b>apramycin</b> resistance was not transferable. On the basis of their restriction enzyme digestion profiles and the antimicrobial resistance traits encoded, the transferable plasmids encoding resistance to <b>apramycin</b> and hygromycin B comprised three distinct types. Genetic linkage between the gene encoding AAC(3) IV and genes encoding resistance to ampicillin and either tetracycline or trimethoprim, means that the relatively widespread use of these antimicrobial agents provides a selective pressure for the persistence of resistance to <b>apramycin</b> and gentamicin {{even in the absence of}} bacterial exposure to aminoglycosides...|$|E
40|$|Summary. Seven (27 %) of 26 gentamicin-resistant human {{clinical}} isolates of Escherichia coli were {{resistant to}} the veterinary aminoglycoside antibiotic <b>apramycin.</b> A gentamicin-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae isolate from a patient infected with gentamicin/apramycin-resistant E. coli was also resistant to <b>apramycin.</b> DNA hybridisation studies showed that all gentamkin/ apramycin-resistant isolates contained a gene encoding the enzyme 3 -N-aminoglycoside acetyltransferase type IV (AAC[3]IV) that mediates resistance to gentamicin and <b>apramycin</b> in bacteria isolated from animals. Seven of the eight gentamicin/apramycin-resistant isolates were also {{resistant to the}} veterinary antihelminthic agent hygromycin B, a phenomenon observed previously in gentamicin/apramycin-resistant Enterobacteriaceae isolated from animals. Resistance to gentamicin/apramycin and hygromycin B was co-transferable in six of the isolates. Restriction enzyme analysis of plasmids in apramycin-resistant transconjugants derived from E. coli and K. pneumoniae isolates from the same patient were virtually identical, suggesting that inter-generic transfer of plasmids encoding <b>apramycin</b> resistance had occurred in vivo. These findings {{support the view that}} resistance to gentamicin and <b>apramycin</b> in clinical isolates of E. coli results from the spread of resistant organisms from animals to man, with subsequent inter-strain or inter-species spread, or both, of resistance genes on transferable plasmids...|$|E
40|$|We have {{explored}} {{the potential of}} using the <b>apramycin</b> resistance gene as a marker in mycobacterial gene transfer studies. Shuttle plasmids available for both electroporation and conjugation studies have been constructed, and we have successfully validated {{the use of the}} <b>apramycin</b> resistance gene as a component of cloning vectors for Mycobacterium smegmatis, M. bovis BCG, and M. tuberculosis...|$|E
40|$|The Salmonella {{isolates}} recovered on 61 Ontario swine farms {{within the}} time period 2001 - 2006 were tested for antimicrobial susceptibility. No resistance was determined to amikacin and ciprofloxacin and only one nalidixic acid resistant isolate was recovered in 2001. Only 1 % of the isolates were resistance against ceftiofur, ceftriaxone, <b>apramycin,</b> <b>apramycin,</b> cephalothin, amoxicillinlclavulanic acid, cefoxitin, and gentamicin...|$|E
40|$|An {{outbreak}} of salmonellosis in calves was monitored for persistence of Salmonella typhimurium excretion in faeces {{and the effect}} of treatment with <b>apramycin.</b> Prior to treatment apramycin-resistant Escherichia coli were present but all S. typhimurium isolates were sensitive. Following the treatment of six calves with <b>apramycin,</b> apramycin-resistant S. typhimurium were isolated from two treated calves and one untreated calf. Plasmid profiles of E. coli and S. typhimurium were compared and plasmids conferring resistance to <b>apramycin</b> and several other antibiotics were transferred by conjugation in vitro from calf E. coli and S. typhimurium isolates to E. coli K- 12 and from E. coli to S. typhimurium. The plasmids conjugated with high frequency in vitro from E. coli to S. typhimurium, and hybridized to a DNA probe specific for the gene encoding aminoglycoside acetyltransferase 3 -IV (AAC(3) -IV) which confers resistance to <b>apramycin,</b> gentamicin, netilmicin and tobramycin...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{validate}} an agar diffusion method through the parameters linearity, precision and accuracy, to quantify <b>apramycin</b> in soluble powder. The calibration curve of <b>apramycin</b> was constructed by plotting log of concentrations (µg ml - 1) versus zone diameter (mm) and shows good linearity in the range of 1. 0 - 4. 0 µg ml - 1. The precision of the assay was determined by assaying samples at the same day (repeatability - R. S. D. = 2. 00 %) and on different days (intermediate precision - R. S. D. = 5. 06 %) and indicate good precision. The accuracy expresses the agreement between the accepted value and the value found. The mean recovery was found to be 100. 49 % for <b>apramycin</b> soluble powder. The results indicated that the microbiological assay proposed in this work hold linearity, precision and accuracy being an acceptable alternative method for routine quality control of <b>apramycin</b> in the pharmaceutical dosage form studied...|$|E
30|$|The gene {{disruption}} plasmid pKCsimR 1 -hyg was conjugally transferred from E. coli into S. antibioticus Tü 6040. Exconjugants {{were selected for}} resistance to <b>apramycin</b> (10 μg ml- 1). To generate S. antibioticus ΔsimReg 1 strain, single-crossover mutants were obtained by cultivation of the respective exconjugants at 39 °C for 3 days with a further screen {{for the loss of}} <b>apramycin</b> resistance as a consequence of a secondary crossover.|$|E
40|$|The {{interaction}} of <b>apramycin</b> with an RNA fragment mimicking the bacterial ribosomal A site was investigated by NMR spectroscopy, mainly {{by using the}} transferred NOE technique. The fact that only the RNA-bound antibiotic shows nonzero NOE effects, allowed us to gain structural details of bound <b>apramycin</b> despite the fast exchange conditions between the free and RNA-bound forms. The dissociation constant of the apramycin–RNA complex was evaluated by CD spectroscopy...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} the prevalence of aminoglycosides antibiotic resistance in Salmonella spp. and E. coli strains. 32 E. coli, and 47 Salmonella spp., isolated from cases of enteritis in growers and fatteners from 1998 to 2002 in Umbria and Marche regions, were tested. Susceptibility to gentamicin, tobramycin and streptomycin was determined by Kirby-Bauer method, <b>apramycin</b> by microdilution method. 92, 4 % of the strains tested were susceptible to <b>apramycin,</b> 77, 2 % to gentamicin, 67, 1 % to tobramycin and 35, 4 % to streptomycin. A positive statistical association between gentamicin and <b>apramycin</b> (RR = 7, 63; p = 0, 014), tobramycin and <b>apramycin</b> (RR = 9, 22; p = 0, 027) was demonstrated. There is no difference between the association apramycin-streptomycin, suggesting a mechanism of resistance related to the presence of the aminoglycoside acetyltranspherase IV enzyme. The trend based on estimated OR from the resistance of the strains for every year considered was significant (p = 0, 00049), showing a progressive decrease from 1998 (OR = 1) to 2002 (OR = 0, 3) ...|$|E
40|$|International audienceAbstractThe {{effect of}} <b>apramycin</b> {{treatment}} on transfer and selection of an Escherichia coli strain (E. coli 912) in the intestine of pigs was analyzed through an in vivo experiment. The strain was sequenced and {{assigned to the}} sequence type ST 101 and serotype O 11. It carried resistance genes to apramycin/gentamicin, sulphonamide, tetracycline, hygromycin B, β-lactams and streptomycin [aac(3) -IV, sul 2, tet(X), aph(4), blaTEM- 1 and strA/B], with all but tet(X) located on the same conjugative plasmid. Nineteen pigs were randomly allocated into two inoculation groups, one treated with <b>apramycin</b> (pen 2) and one non-treated (pen 3), along with a non-inoculated control group (pen 1). Two pigs of pen 2 and 3 were inoculated intragastrically with a rifampicin resistant variant of the strain. <b>Apramycin</b> treatment in pen 2 was initiated immediately after inoculation. Strain colonization was assessed in the feces from all pigs. E. coli 912 was shown to spread to non-inoculated pigs in both groups. The selective effect did not persist beyond 3  days post-treatment, and the strain was not detected from this time point in pen 2. We demonstrated that E. coli 912 was able to spread between pigs in the same pen irrespective of treatment, and <b>apramycin</b> treatment resulted in significantly higher counts compared to the non-treated group. This represents the first demonstration of how antimicrobial treatment affects spread of resistant bacteria in pig production. The use of <b>apramycin</b> may lead to enhanced spread of gentamicin-resistant E. coli. Since gentamicin is a first-choice drug for human bacteremia, this is of concern...|$|E
40|$|A {{method to}} select for transposable {{elements}} from Streptomyces spp. by using insertional inactivation of a repressor gene that functions in Escherichia coli was developed. Plasmid pCZA 126, which can replicate in Streptomyces spp. or E. coli, contains a gene coding for the lambda cI 857 repressor and a gene, under repressor control, coding for <b>apramycin</b> resistance. E. coli cells containing the plasmid are <b>apramycin</b> sensitive but become <b>apramycin</b> resistant if the cI 857 repressor gene is disrupted. Plasmids propagated in Streptomyces spp. can be screened for transposable elements that have disrupted the cI 857 gene by transforming E. coli cells to <b>apramycin</b> resistance. This method {{was used to}} isolate a new 1. 6 -kilobase insertion sequence, IS 493, from Streptomyces lividans CT 2. IS 493 duplicated host DNA at the target site, had inverted repeats at its ends, and contained two tandem open reading frames on each strand. IS 493 was present in three copies in the same genomic locations in several S. lividans strains. Two of the copies appeared {{to be present in}} regions of similar DNA context that extended at least 11. 5 kilobases. Several other Streptomyces spp. did not appear to contain copies of IS 493...|$|E
30|$|The gene {{disruption}} was performed following the protocol of John Innes Centre (Gust et al. 2003). Employing pIJ 773 plasmid as a template, the disruption cassette for a dehydratase domain of module 12 was amplified using forward primer (5 ′-GCCTGCGGGTCGACTGGGAGCGGCTGTTCGCGGGGACCATTCCGGGGATCCGTCGACC- 3 ′) and reverse primer (5 ′-GGTGTTCGAGCTGGGCCGCGGCGAGCATGCCCCGAACGGTGTAGGCTGGAGCTGCTTC- 3 ′), {{and that for}} a FkbH-like protein was also amplified using forward primer (5 ′-AGCGGGCCCGCGTCCGACGAGACGAGGAAGGACGACATGATTCCGGGGATCCGTCGACC- 3 ′) and reverse primer (5 ′-CGGGCCGGAGCCCGGGAGCACCGGCCGCCGCGGCGGTCATGTAGGCTGGAGCTGCTTC- 3 ′). These extended <b>apramycin</b> disruption cassettes were introduced by electroporation into cell suspension of E. coli BW 25113 /pIJ 790 harboring pSGB 20 cosmid, which were grown {{in the presence of}} arabinose. After incubation overnight at 37 °C, a single clone was selected in which the target gene was replaced by the disruption cassette. For conjugal transfer to bafilomycin-producing S. griseus, the PCR-targeted disruption cosmid was purified and transformed in E. coli ET 12567 /pUZ 8002 by electroporation, and then transferred by intergeneric conjugation to wild strain. The conjugation was tried using Streptomyces spores obtained from MS agar plate and then heated at 50 °C for 10 min to induce germination. The mixture of E. coli ET 12567 /pUZ 8002 cells and heated spores were spread on MS agar plate supplemented with 10 mM MgCl 2 and <b>apramycin</b> at 30 °C overnight. One day after, the plates were overlaid with 300 μL of <b>apramycin</b> and nalidixic acid and incubated for 5 days more. For selection of the disrupted colonies, replica-plates with single colonies were made onto a nutrient agar containing nalidixic acid and <b>apramycin</b> for positive selection, and the other onto a nutrient agar containing nalidixic acid, <b>apramycin</b> and kanamycin for negative selection.|$|E
40|$|A novel <b>apramycin</b> {{resistance}} gene, apmA, {{was detected}} on the ca. - 40 -kb resistance plasmid pAFS 11 from bovine methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) of sequence type 398 (ST 398). The apmA gene coded for a protein of 274 amino acids that was related only distantly to acetyltransferases involved in chloramphenicol or streptogramin A resistance. NsiI deletion of apmA {{resulted in a}} 16 - to 32 -fold decrease in the <b>apramycin</b> MICs. An apmA-specific PCR identified this gene in one additional bovine and four porcine MRSA ST 398 isolates...|$|E
40|$|A {{series of}} <b>apramycin</b> {{derivatives}} was prepared and investigated for antibacterial {{activity and the}} ability to inhibit protein synthesis in cell-free translation assays. The effect of various modifications at the 6 '- and N 7 '-positions on antiribosomal activity is discussed in terms of their influence on drug binding to specific residues in the decoding A-site. These studies {{contribute to the development of}} a structure-activity relationship for the antibacterial activity of the <b>apramycin</b> class of aminoglycosides and to the future design and development of more active and less toxic antibiotics...|$|E
40|$|An {{examination}} of salmonella isolates {{collected by the}} Scottish Agricultural College Veterinary Services Division from April 1994 to May 1995 was conducted {{to determine the extent}} to which Salmonella enterica serotype Typhimurium phage type 104 (DT 104) occurred and to investigate the antimicrobial resistance patterns of isolates. Typhimurium DT 104 was the predominant salmonella and was isolated from nine species of animal. All isolates of this phage type possessed resistance to at least one antimicrobial and 98 % of the isolates were resistant to multiple antimicrobials with R-type ACTSp the predominant resistance pattern. Various other resistance patterns were identified and transferable resistance to the veterinary aminoglycoside antimicrobial <b>apramycin</b> was demonstrated in three strains. A retrospective study for gentamicin resistance in isolates from the Scottish Salmonella Reference Laboratory collection revealed a human isolate of Typhimurium DT 104 resistant to gentamicin but sensitive to <b>apramycin</b> and a bovine isolate with <b>apramycin</b> and gentamicin resistance...|$|E
40|$|We {{determined}} the in vitro susceptibility of four aminoglycosides, {{which are not}} of the 4, 6 -disubstituted deoxystreptamine (DOS) subclass against a collection of carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE). CRE clinical strains (n = 134) were collected from multiple hospitals in China and carried blaNDM (blaNDM− 1, blaNDM− 5 or blaNDM− 7; n = 66), blaKPC− 2 (n = 62) or blaIMP− 4 (n = 7; including one carrying blaNDM− 1 and blaIMP− 4). MICs of neomycin, paromomycin, streptomycin and <b>apramycin</b> as well as three 4, 6 -disubstituted DOS aminoglycosides (amikacin, gentamicin and tobramycin) were determined using the broth microdilution with breakpoints defined by the Clinical Laboratory Standards Institute (for amikacin, gentamicin and tobramycin), US Food and Drug Administration (streptomycin), the National Antimicrobial Resistance Monitoring System (<b>apramycin)</b> or la Société Française de Microbiologie (neomycin and paromomycin). Apramycin-resistant strains were subjected to whole genome sequencing using Illumina X 10 platform. Among CRE strains, 65. 7, 64. 9, 79. 1, and 95. 5 % were susceptible to neomycin (MIC 50 /MIC 90, 8 / 256 μg/ml), paromomycin (4 /> 256 μg/ml), streptomycin (16 / 256 μg/ml) and <b>apramycin</b> (4 / 8 μg/ml), respectively, while only 55. 2, 28. 4, and 35. 1 % were susceptible to amikacin (32 /> 256 μg/ml), gentamicin (128 /> 256 μg/ml) and tobramycin (64 /> 256 μg/ml), respectively. Six CRE strains including five Escherichia coli of different sequence types and one Klebsiella pneumoniae were resistant to <b>apramycin</b> and the apramycin-resistant gene aac(3) -IVa was detected {{in all of these}} strains. In conclusion, neomycin, paromomycin, streptomycin and <b>apramycin</b> retain activity against most CRE strains. Although none of these non- 4, 6 -disubstituted DOS aminoglycosides are suitable for intravenous use in human at present, these agents warrant further investigations to be used against CRE infections...|$|E
40|$|The {{study of}} {{antibiotic}} resistance {{has in the}} past focused on organisms that are pathogenic to humans or animals. However, the development of resistance in commensal organisms is of concern because of possible transfer of resistance genes to zoonotic pathogens. Conjugative plasmids are genetic elements capable of such transfer and are traditionally thought to engender a fitness burden on host bacteria. In this study, conjugative <b>apramycin</b> resistance plasmids isolated from newborn calves were characterized. Calves were raised on a farm that had not used <b>apramycin</b> or related aminoglycoside antibiotics for at least 20 months prior to sampling. Of three <b>apramycin</b> resistance plasmids, one was capable of transfer at very high rates and two were found to confer fitness advantages on new Escherichia coli hosts. This is the first identification of natural plasmids isolated from commensal organisms that are able to confer a fitness advantage on a new host. This work indicates that reservoirs of antibiotic resistance genes in commensal organisms might not decrease if antibiotic usage is halted...|$|E
40|$|Campylobacter jejuni genetic {{manipulation}} is restricted by {{the limited number}} of antibiotic resistance cassettes available for use in this diarrheal pathogen. In this study, two antibiotic resistance cassettes were developed, encoding for hygromycin B and <b>apramycin</b> resistance, for use in mutagenesis or for selection of gene expression and complementation constructs in C. jejuni. First, the marker genes were successfully modified to allow for insertional mutagenesis or deletion of a gene-of-interest, and were bracketed with restriction sites for the facilitation of site-specific cloning. These hygromycin B and <b>apramycin</b> markers are encoded by plasmids pAC 1 H and pAC 1 A, respectively. We also modified an insertional gene-delivery vector to create pRRH and pRRA, containing the hygromycin B and <b>apramycin</b> resistance genes, and 3 unique restriction sites for the directional introduction of genes into the conserved multi-copy rRNA gene clusters of the C. jejuni chromosome. We determined the effective antibiotic concentrations required for selection, and established that no harmful effects or fitness costs were associated with carrying hygromycin B or <b>apramycin</b> resistance under standard C. jejuni laboratory conditions. Using these markers, the arylsulfatase reporter gene astA was deleted, and the ability to genetically complement the astA deletion using pRRH and pRRA for astA gene insertion was demonstrated. Furthermore, the relative levels of expression from the endogenous astA promoter were compared to that of polycistronic mRNA expression from the constitutive promoter upstream of the resistance gene. The development of additional antibiotic resistance cassettes for use in Campylobacter will enable multiple gene deletion and expression combinations as well as more in-depth study of multi-gene systems important for the survival and pathogenesis of this important bacterium...|$|E
40|$|In Salmonella typhimurium {{phage type}} 204 c {{isolated}} in Britain, gentamicin resistance is specified by plasmids of the I 1 compatibility group which also confer resistance to <b>apramycin.</b> These plasmids have been subdivided into three types within the I 1 {{group on the}} basis of their antibiotic resistance specificity, their ability to produce colicin Ib and their restriction enzyme digest fragmentation patterns. All three have been identified in strains from cattle, but as yet only two types have been found in strains from humans. It is suggested that the use of <b>apramycin</b> in animal husbandry is responsible for the appearance of gentamicin resistance in multiresistant strains of phage type 204 c, a phage type already epidemic in bovine animals and with an increasing incidence in humans...|$|E
40|$|We studied two {{outbreaks}} of calf salmonellosis caused by <b>apramycin</b> and gentamicin-resistant Salmonella typhimurium strains. In both cases, the responsible strains were resistant to ampicillin, chloramphenicol, kanamycin, streptomycin, tetracycline, and trimethoprim; one strain was also resistant to nalidixic acid in one outbreak. A systematic {{survey of the}} intestinal Escherichia coli strains of calves from the two affected flocks showed that 11 of 24 animals sampled were also colonized by apramycin- and gentamicin-resistant E. coli strains. These isolates belonged to four biotypes and were resistant to ampicillin, chloramphenicol, kanamycin, streptomycin, tetracycline, trimethoprim, and nalidixic acid. All of the strains were resistant {{to high levels of}} <b>apramycin</b> (MICs, 512 to 1, 024 micrograms/ml) and to gentamicin (MICs, 8 to 32 micrograms/ml), and these resistances were always transferred en bloc. In S. typhimurium, this coresistance was borne by plasmids that were approximately 39 kilobases long (outbreak 1) or 90 kilobases long (outbreak 2), whereas in E. coli, the coresistance was due to plasmids that were approximately 110 kilobases long in both outbreaks. The two plasmids of Salmonella and four plasmids of E. coli encoded type IV aminoglycoside 3 -N-acetyltransferases. The intensive use of curative and preventive treatments in calf production could be responsible for the emergence of enzymic resistance to <b>apramycin</b> and gentamicin...|$|E
40|$|PCR {{was used}} to {{identify}} genes encoding aminoglycoside-modifying enzymes in 422 veterinary isolates of Salmonella enterica serotype Typhimurium. The identities of extra-integron genes encoding resistance to streptomycin, gentamicin, kanamycin, and <b>apramycin</b> were evaluated. Gentamicin resistance was conferred by the aadB gene. Kanamycin resistance was encoded by either the aphA 1 -Iab gene or the Kn gene. <b>Apramycin</b> resistance {{was determined by the}} aacC 4 gene. Analysis of gene distribution did not reveal significant differences with regard to phage type, host species, or region except for the Kn gene, which was found mostly in nonclinical isolates. The data from this study indicate that pentaresistant DT 104 does not acquire extra-integron genes in species- or geography-related foci, which supports the hypothesis that clonal expansion is the method of spread of this organism...|$|E
40|$|A {{high-performance}} liquid chromatographic method employing pre-column derivatization with o-phthalaldehyde (OPA) and 2 -mercaptoacetic acid {{was developed}} for the determination of <b>apramycin,</b> an aminoglycoside antibiotic used in veterinary medicine, in the oral soluble powder form. The chromatographic separation was done by ion-pair HPLC using a C 18 reversed-phase column, Synergy Hydro (150 mm x 4. 6 mm x 4 µm) and mobile phase composed of 0. 005 mol/L sodium octanosulfonate {{in a mixture of}} acetonitrile: water: acetic acid (45 : 55 : 2) (v/v/v) with a flow rate of 1. 0 mL/min; the UV detector was operated at 332 nm. The developed method was validated according to official compendia guidelines, having demonstrated robustness, selectivity and linearity for the concentration range of 0. 02 to 0. 05 mg/mL, precision (with RSD < 2. 0 % both for intra and inter-day precision) accuracy (average recuperation of 99. 33 %) and detectivity (quantification and detection limits of 0. 08 and 0. 02 µg/mL, respectively). Three batches of commercial <b>apramycin</b> oral soluble powder were analyzed by both the proposed method and the official microbiological method, where all the results obtained were in the acceptable range (95 % to 105 % of labeled value of <b>apramycin).</b> Both methods were statistically compared by the t test, which yielded no significant differences (&# 945; = 0. 05) thereby confirming the equivalence of the methods...|$|E
40|$|Escherichia coli and Salmonella strains {{resistant}} to gentamicin and <b>apramycin</b> were isolated from cattle in France and Belgium and from patients in hospitals. Homology between plasmids of {{both human and}} animal origins encoding aminoglycoside 3 -N-acetyltransferase was revealed by digestion with several restriction endonucleases and confirmed by hybridization with different replicon-specific probes...|$|E
40|$|The {{presence}} of a sublethal amount of <b>apramycin,</b> the aminoglycoside antibiotic used as a selectable marker in transformations of Saccharopolyspora erythraea with pKC 505 and related plasmids, was found to suppress phenotypically the S. erythraea eryB 25 and eryB 26 mutations blocking erythromycin biosynthesis in this organism, probably by the effect of mistranslation...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study was to follow up the {{erythrocyte}} sedimentation rate (ESR) in healthy female goats during and after 5 -day parenteral treatment with amikacin (10 mg/kg), tobramycin (5 mg/kg), <b>apramycin</b> (20 mg/kg), gentamicin (4 mg/kg), kanamycin (10 mg/kg) and spectinomycin (20 mg/kg). Gentamicin and tobramycin caused an initial increase followed by a significant decrease of ESR on the 5 th day for gentamicin and the 10 th day for tobramycin, respectively, followed by recovery after the treatment. Reversely, amikacin and especially spectinomycin produced an increase of ESR without recovery several days post treatment. Kanamycin caused decrease of ESR on the 5 th day without recovery in the subsequent days. Only <b>apramycin</b> did not give rise to increasing of ESR. In conclusion the aminoglycosides, especially tobramycin and gentamicin, caused more severe alterations of ESR than the aminocyclitols...|$|E

Conditions are given for the chromatography of kanamycin A, netilmicin, neomycin, and <b>apramycin,</b> and their products of reaction, if any, with the three AAC enzymes are listed...|$|E
