The PBMR is {{the first}} High Temperature Reactor being {{designed}} for commercial power generation in South Africa. It makes use of spherical fuel elements, containing coated uranium oxide particles encapsulated in a graphite matrix. The spent fuel generated from the reactor is stored in a storage system before final disposal. Such storage systems are called interim storage facilities, and normally make use of small transportable containers. The PBMR design makes use of bulk storage containers, capable of holding {{more than half a}} million spent fuel spheres. This is a unique concept for nuclear spent fuel storage. Also, most nuclear reactors make use of an intermediate cooling pool before the fuel is transferred to the storage facility. For the PBMR, the spent fuel is discharged directly into the interim storage facility, thus eliminating the intermediate cooling pool. All interim storage facilities have to comply with five basic requirements, namely: fuel sub-criticality; decay heat removal; radioactive material containment; fuel integrity protection; and radiation protection of the workers and the public. The solution for each requirement depends upon the type of fuel, as well as the philosophical criteria of the reactor design. For the PBMR, it involves a storage life of 80 years, passive cooling and bulk storage tanks. In addition to the basic requirements, the PBMR storage facility should also be able to store used fuel during reactor maintenance, and to transfer it back to the reactor or to another storage tank when required. During the four years of the development of the storage system, the design has undergone several changes. These changes were brought on by changes of the reactor design, and also due to developments and improvements on immature areas. The result is an integrated solution, retaining virtually none of the original concept, but still complying with all requirements. The containment design solution is a vertically suspended ASME VIII pressure vessel (or storage tank) with a loading point and an unloading device. All radioactive material is captured inside the pressure boundary, and the tank is completely sealed off when not in use. New devices were developed to systematically load the tank, and to remove the spheres from the tank. Scale tests were done to verify the performance of the new devices and to ensure proper sphere flow inside the tank. Sub-criticality of the fuel volume is achieved by adding hollow tubes to the inside of the storage tank, thereby creating a sub-critical geometry. Bum-up credit is also taken for the fuel at 20 % below the average core bum-up. The fuel is therefore passively safe even if the full contents of the reactor is transferred into a storage tank. In order to ensure that the tank lasts for 80 years in a cost-effective manner, the tanks are cooled in a closed loop system. The closed loop air is continuously dried to a very low relative humidity, which minimises corrosion on even normal carbon steel. Corrosion tests have been performed to investigate the effect of radiolysis products that may build up in the closed loop. These tests are still under way. The decay heat is removed from the fuel spheres by means of air convection around the tank surface. The tubes inside the tank also allow air to pass through, creating a very strong chimney effect. A new method was developed to calculate the fuel temperatures for a given cooling flow. The technique makes use of FEA and analytical equations. Solutions are obtained at a fraction of the time it takes to perform a full CFD analysis, and within 5 % compared to CFD results. Full-scale tests are planned to measure and verify the heat transfer properties of the cooling tubes in order to boost the credibility of the FEA and CFD analyses. The storage tank design is integrated into a storage unit, which performs all the nuclear functions. The storage unit can operate in four different cooling modes, namely closed loop active cooling; open loop passive cooling; open loop active cooling and closed loop conditioning. There is an <b>automatic</b> <b>fallback</b> from the active cooling mode to a passive cooling mode. The active cooling is thus only needed to prevent excessive corrosion of the tanks. A scale model has been built to demonstrate the passive cooling ability of a storage unit, and the results agree well with CFD analyses. Also, a new method was developed to calculate the passive cooling characteristics using pipe network simulation software. This method is significantly faster than CFD analyses, and allows one to easily incorporate fan characteristics and to perform sensitivity studies. Twelve storage units make up the Sphere Storage System of the PBMR. An intricate sphere pipe system allows one to transfer fuel spheres from the reactor to any tank, from any tank back to the reactor or to another tank, or to a decommissioning cask. All maintenance intensive components are placed at accessible areas, thus protecting the workers from the radiation coming from the tanks. Measures are incorporated to detect any contamination leakage, and also to enable the IAEA to verify the nuclear inventory of the storage system. The Sphere Storage System is a fully integrated, yet modular design that complies with all nuclear and process requirements. It presents a unique solution to the interim fuel storage of the PBMR, and is believed to be a cost-effective solution for 80 years of storage. Some future tests and developments are required to finalise immature areas, but overall, the system is sufficiently engineered such that detail design can continue. Doctora...|$|E

In this paper, we introduce a semi-Markovian framework to analyze the performance of two of the most popular rate adaptation algorithms used in wireless LANs, namely <b>Automatic</b> Rate <b>Fallback</b> (ARF) and Adaptive <b>Automatic</b> Rate <b>Fallback</b> (AARF).

40|$|Abstract — This paper {{analyzes}} {{the impact of}} different MAC (Medium Access Control) and transmission rate adaptation schemes on wireless mesh networks. The considered protocols include three different MAC protocols specified in IEEE 802. 11 standards, i. e., 802. 11, 802. 11 e, and 802. 11 n, and three rate adaptation schemes, i. e., ARF (<b>Automatic</b> Rate <b>Fallback),</b> RBAR (Receiver-Based Auto Rate), and 802. 11 n rate adaptation. We also study the interactions of these MAC strategies with the state-of-the-art routing metric ETT (Expected Transmission Time). Through comparative simulation evaluations, we investigate {{the effectiveness of these}} protocols when they coexist on both single-hop and multi-hop wireless mesh network environments. As these MAC strategies are designed for single-hop WLANs, we observed their limitations on multi-hop wireless mesh networks. We analyze their performances and suggest solutions for improvements. Based on our simulation results, we also argue for the need of a new routing metric that takes advantage of the new emerging MAC features. I...|$|R
3000|$|On {{the other}} hand, {{in order to}} improve the network {{performance}} within dynamically changing environments, link adaptation techniques are proposed by adjusting major design parameters according to the channel conditions, for example, based on the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) values. The <b>automatic</b> rate <b>fallback</b> (ARF) algorithm as developed in [20] regulates the packet transmission rate based on the available feedback information from the acknowledgment (ACK) frames. Due to the severe delay problems encountered by the ARF scheme under highly varying channel conditions, cross link adaptation (CLA) algorithms [21 – 23] are proposed to alleviate the degraded network goodput. A mapping table between the SNR value and the modulation and coding scheme (MCS) is pre-established by the CLA algorithms, where an optimal MCS scheme is obtained in order to maximize the saturated network goodput. However, none of the existing link adaptation algorithms is specifically designed under the scenarios with frame aggregation.

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} problem of how to improve TCP {{performance}} in multi-rate Ad-hoc networks with congested links. To improve network performance, different rate adaptation algorithms, such as <b>Automatic</b> Rate <b>Fallback</b> (ARF) and Receiver-Based AutoRate (RBAR), have been proposed to adapt the data rate according to the current channel quality. Opportunistic Auto Rate (OAR) protocol is an optimisation for any existing rate adaptation algorithm which leads to a significant performance gain by providing temporal fairness. We analyze the reasons for the high performance gain obtained using OAR, and show that the OAR protocol does not work well for TCP communications in Ad-hoc networks where nodes use different data rates to communicate with each other (heterogeneous). Based on these analysis, we propose a Congestion Reactive Opportunistic Auto Rate (CROAR) protocol, which is a new rate adaption enhancement tailored to improve TCP performance in heterogeneous multi-hop Ad-hoc networks. Extensive simulations show that CROAR, compared to OAR and RBAR, produces significant throughput and end-to-end transmission latency improvements while only marginally relaxing temporal fairness. 1...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Wireless Internet {{access is}} {{facilitated}} by IEEE 802. 11 WLANs that, {{in addition to}} realizing a specific form of CSMA/CA—distributed coordination function (DCF) — implement a range of performance enhancement features such as multi-rate adaptation that induce cross-layer protocol coupling. Recent works in empirical WLAN performance evaluation have shown that cross-layer interactions can be subtle, sometimes leading to unexpected outcomes. Two such instances are: significant throughput degradation (a bell-shaped throughput curve) resulting from <b>automatic</b> rate <b>fallback</b> (ARF) having difficulty distinguishing collision from channel noise, and scalable TCP performance over DCF that is able to curtail effective multiple access contention {{in the presence of}} many contending stations. The latter also mitigates the negative performance effect of ARF. In this paper, we present station-centric Markov chain models of WLAN cross-layer performance aimed at capturing complex interactions between ARF, DCF, and TCP. Our performance analyses may be viewed as multi-protocol extensions of Bianchi’s IEEE 802. 11 model that, despite significantly increased complexity, lead to tractable and accurate performance predictions due to modular coupling. Our results complement empirical and simulation-based findings, demonstrating the versatility and efficacy of station-centric Markov chain analysis for capturing cross-layer WLAN dynamics...|$|R
40|$|Today’s IEEE 802. 11 WLANs (Wireless LANs) provide {{multiple}} transmission rates so that different rates can be exploited in an adaptive manner {{depending on the}} underlying channel condition {{in order to maximize}} the system performance. Many rate adaptation schemes have been proposed so far while most (if not all) of the commercial devices implement a simple open-loop rate adaptation scheme (i. e., without feedback from the receiver), called ARF (<b>Automatic</b> Rate <b>Fallback)</b> due to its simplicity. A key problem with such open-loop rate adaptation schemes is that they do not consider the collision effect, and hence, malfunction severely when many transmission failures are due to collisions. In this paper, we propose a novel rate-adaptation scheme, called CARA (Collision-Aware Rate Adaptation). The key idea of CARA is that the transmitter station combines adaptively the Request-to-Send/Clear-to-Send (RTS/CTS) exchange with the Clear Channel Assessment (CCA) functionality to differentiate frame collisions from frame transmission failures caused by channel errors. Therefore, compared with other open-loop rate-adaptation schemes, CARA is more likely to make the correct rate adaptation decisions. Through extensive simulation runs, we evaluate our proposed scheme to show that our scheme yields significantly higher throughput performance than the existing schemes in both static and time-varying fading channel environments...|$|R
40|$|In Wireless LANs, users {{may adapt}} their {{transmission}} rates {{depending on the}} observed radio conditions on their links to maximize their throughput. Recently, {{there has been a}} significant research effort in developing distributed rate adaptation schemes offering better performance than that of the current ARF (<b>Automatic</b> Rate <b>Fallback).</b> Unlike previous works, this paper characterizes the optimal reaction of a rate adaptation protocol to the contention information received from the MAC. We formulate this problem analytically. We study both competitive and cooperative user behaviors: In the case of competition, users selfishly adapt their rates so as to maximize their own throughput, whereas in the case of cooperation they aim at adapting their rates to maximize the overall system throughput. We show that the Nash Equilibrium realized in the case of competition can be inefficient (i. e., the price of anarchy is high, up to 50 % of the social optimum), and provide insightful properties of the socially optimal rate adaptation schemes. We also show that RTS/CTS does not make the competitive scenario more efficient. We then apply the same analysis to recently proposed collision-aware rate adaptation algorithms and observe similar conclusions. Finally, we propose a novel collision-aware rate adaptation algorithm that significantly reduces the price of anarchy in many scenarios of interest...|$|R

40|$|The {{performance}} of the IEEE 802. 11 WLAN {{are influenced by the}} wireless channel characteristics that reflect on the Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR), particularly in industrial communication systems, that often operate in harsh environments. In order to cope with SNR reductions, the IEEE 802. 11 WLAN specification suggests to adapt (reduce) the transmission rate, since the modulation techniques employed at the lower rates are more robust. However, the standard does not define any Rate Adaptation (RA) technique, leaving the actual implementation to the device manufacturers choice. In this paper we focus on RA techniques for industrial communication systems that are typically subjected to tight reliability and timing requirements. In detail, we compare the performance figures of a general purpose widespread technique, namely the <b>Automatic</b> Rate <b>Fallback</b> (ARF), with those of the RA techniques actually implemented on two commercially available IEEE 802. 11 devices via a set of practical experiments. The obtained results show that these techniques are characterized by a relevant number of packet retransmissions that may introduce a considerable randomness on the service time, possibly leading to performance degradation. Consequently, we propose two new techniques and evaluate their behavior by means of numerical simulations carried out for typical industrial traffic profiles. The outcomes are encouraging since the proposed RA techniques show in most cases better performance than ARF...|$|R
40|$|The {{majority}} of existing wireless rate controls {{are based on}} the implicit assumption that frames are corrupted due to the random, arbitrary environmental and thermal noises. They generally reduce the channel rate on frame losses, trading lower efficiency in frequency band utilization for more robust modulation so that the current noise level may be concealed. In highly interfered wireless networks where frames are lost mainly due to interference from other wireless transceivers, simply reducing the channel rate prolongs the frame transmission time and therefore aggravates frame loss ratio. This positive feedback in the rate control loop quickly diverges the interfered transceivers into a suboptimal channel rate and drives the network into a state with high interference. In the worst case, interfered transceivers can be starved. In this paper we present RAF, the rate-adaptive framing that jointly controls the channel rate and frame size according to the observed interference patterns and noise level at the receiver. Based on the inputs from physical layer carrier sense, the receiver derives the optimal channel rate and frame size that maximize throughput, and informs the transmitter of such optimal configuration in a few bits in the per-frame acknowledgement. Through intensive simulations we show that RAF consistently outperforms ARF (<b>automatic</b> rate <b>fallback),</b> the de facto rate control in 802. 11 networks, in all our simulated scenarios. In particular, it increases the throughput of interfered transceivers by up to six folds and completely eliminates starvation in large random networks with various traffic matrix and interference levels. 1...|$|R
40|$|Many control schemes {{proposed}} for IEEE 802. 11 wireless LANs (WLANs) behave adaptively to transmission failures, which occur mostly by two causes: collision and channel noise. However, in generic 802. 11 WLANs, a station cannot know {{the cause of}} a transmission failure, and thus the current adaptive schemes assume that all transmission failures occur by one of the causes, which may lead to erroneous behavior in the real world. In this paper, we propose a novel scheme to detect collisions, which can help to differentiate the causes of transmission failures. The proposed scheme conducts accurate collision detection basically in two phases: failure notification (FN) and collision notification (CN). In the FN phase, a station disseminates the information about a failed transmission, i. e., transmission time or RF energy time on the channel, {{and the rest of the}} stations judge the cause by checking the received information against their own transmission history. If a station detects a collision through the FN phase, it starts the CN phase by disseminating the collision information so that the rest of the collision-involved stations self-detect the collision. In addition, the proposed scheme can detect the occurrence of the capture effect as well as the existence of hidden stations. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme, we present four applications and verify the performance improvement in each of these applications through comprehensive computer simulation, i. e., throughput enhancement of ARF (<b>Automatic</b> Rate <b>Fallback)</b> rate adaptation algorithm in various channel environments, efficiency improvement of the backoff mechanism with a few contending stations, fairness improvement against the capture effect and the improvement of the system throughput as well as fairness by the adaptive usage of the Request-to-Send/Clear-to-Send (RTS/ CTS) exchange...|$|R
40|$|Without a doubt, Wireless Local Area Networks (WLANs) {{technology}} has been encountering an explosive growth lately. IEEE 802. 11 is the standard associated with this promising technology, which enures shared access to the wireless medium through the distributed coordination function (DCF). Recently, the IEEE 802. 11 e task group has made extensions to WLANs medium access control (MAC) {{in order to support}} quality of service (QoS) traffic. An inherited problem for WLANs, is the volatility of the propagation medium, which is a challenging issue that affects the system performance significantly. Consequently, enhancing the operation of the DCF in noisy environments is of great interest, and has attracted the attention of many researchers. Our first major contribution in the presented thesis, is an analytical and simulation analysis for the binary exponential backoff (BEB) scheme of the DCF, in the presence of channel noise. We show that following the BEB procedure when a host encounters erroneous transmission is needed only if the channel was highly loaded. However, incrementing the contention window (CW) upon each packet failure, whether caused by instantaneous transmission (i. e. collision) or channel noise, will result in the waste of air time if the channel was lightly loaded. Accordingly, we present a hybrid access method that adapts the CW according to the channel load along with the frame error rate (FER). Other means to overcome the channel noise is the adjustment of the transmission rate. Many rate adaptation (RA) algorithms were introduced in the past few years, including the <b>Automatic</b> Rate <b>Fallback</b> (ARF) which is currently implemented in the wireless cards. Yet, many drawbacks are associated with these RA algorithms; specifically, in regard to the techniques and events that should trigger the rate change. Moreover, the IEEE 802. 11 e QoS flows requirements were not considered with the latter schemes. Accordingly, our next major contribution in this work is the presentation of a novel rate adaptation scheme. The simplicity of the introduced rate adaptation scheme is that it relies on the MAC layer parameters rather than those of the PHY layer when adjusting the rate. Furthermore, our algorithm supports the IEEE 802. 11 e MAC extensions where QoS traffic requirements were integrated in the procedure of adjusting the bit rate. Hence, strict real-time flow parameters such as delay and maximum drop rate are respected. Finally, we enhance the dynamic assignment of transmission opportunities (TXOPs) in order to offer fair air-time for nodes facing high packet loss rat...|$|R
40|$|There is {{a growing}} demand for faster, {{improved}} data and voice services in rural areas without modern telecom infrastructure. A wireless network is often the only feasible solution for providing network access in this environment, due to the sparse populations and difficult natural conditions. A system solution that incorporates the Multipoint Communication System (MCS) algorithm created by TRLabs into the available IEEE 802. 11 b Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN) devices was proposed and studied in this thesis. It combines the advantages of both systems, that is, the MCS’ capability of integrating Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) and data services and the IEEE 802. 11 b standard, currently {{the most widely used}} in WLAN products. A system test bed was set up inside Network Simulator- 2 (NS- 2). The data and VoIP performance was tested. Modifications to the original MCS algorithm to improve system performance were made throughout this thesis. In a constant rate radio channel, data performance (throughput and transmission efficiency) was measured using the original MCS algorithm, which was comparable to the standard Distribution Coordination Function (DCF) operation of IEEE 802. 11 b when both were simulated at similar conditions. On an 802. 11 b platform, the <b>Automatic</b> Rate <b>Fallback</b> (ARF) feature was incorporated into the original MCS algorithm. However, when clients with different data rates were present in the same channel, all the clients involved received unacceptably low and equal data throughput, dragged down by the low rate clients. A modified MCS data polling algorithm was proposed with the capability of repeated polling, which eliminated the negative effect of low rate clients in a multi-rate channel. In addition, the original MCS algorithm was modified to be more efficient in the voice polling process. The voice performance and data throughput were tested at various conditions. However, the one-by-one polling still resulted in very low voice transmission efficiency. The time wasted became more severe with increasing relay distance and channel rate (only 8. 5 % in an 11 Mbps channel at 30 km). A new voice handling process similar to Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA) mode was implemented and simulated. Its voice efficiency can be kept at 25 % at any setting of relay distance and channel rate. Data transmission in the same channel can also benefit from using the new voice scheme. The normalized saturation throughput could be improved by 13. 5 % if there were 40 voice clients involved in an 11 Mbps channel at the relay distance of 15 km, compared to the original MCS algorithm. More improvement in voice efficiency, voice capacity, and data throughput can be achieved at longer relay distance, or with more voice calls set up...|$|R
