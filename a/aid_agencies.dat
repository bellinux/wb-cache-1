5|$|The {{majority}} in the High Court decided that {{although there was no}} right at common law to have publicly provided legal representation in all cases, in some cases representation is appropriate to ensure a fair trial. Although judges no longer have the power to appoint counsel for an accused, since that function has been largely taken over by legal <b>aid</b> <b>agencies,</b> a trial judge should use their power to adjourn a case if it is in the interests of fairness that an accused have representation, which would encourage the legal <b>aid</b> <b>agencies</b> to provide counsel.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, {{we build}} {{a model of}} agrarian economies in which a kleptocratic {{government}} taxes farmers to maximize its life-time utility. The model is a dynamic general equilibrium model in which the subsistence of farmers requires a minimum level of consumption. We analyze the effect that a benevolent food <b>aid</b> <b>agency</b> can have in such an environment. If it expects the food <b>aid</b> <b>agency</b> to intervene, the kleptocratic government will starve its farmers, in a clear case of the Samaritan's dilemma. We show that the likelihood of man-made famines, however, can be greatly reduced if the food <b>aid</b> <b>agency</b> intervenes with probability slightly lower than one. No <b>aid</b> <b>agency</b> devoted to saving lines, however, can commit to such policy. We propose {{a solution to this}} food aid curse...|$|R

5|$|Diem {{appointed}} Bui Van Luong—a {{family friend}} and devout Catholic—as {{the head of}} COMIGAL, the government resettlement agency. COMIGAL worked {{in cooperation with the}} United States Operations Mission, the non-military wing of the American presence and the Military Assistance Advisory Group. Although COMIGAL was purely dedicated to refugee issues, there was a constant turnover of public servants through their staff, and the benefits of continuity did not materialize. After only a few months in the job, Luong was replaced by Pham Van Huyen on December 7, 1954. COMIGAL were supplemented by American Catholic <b>aid</b> <b>agencies</b> and an advisory group from Michigan State University, where Diem had stayed while in self-imposed exile in the early 1950s. There were three phases in the resettlement program. With more than 4,000new arrivals per day, the northerners were housed in Saigon and Vũng Tàu in 42 makeshift reception centers. These consisted of existing schools, vacated French barracks, churches and tent cities on the grounds of Tan Son Nhut Air Base and Phú Thọ Racecourse. These could not be used indefinitely as the grounds needed to be used for their preexisting purpose, and furthermore, such ad hoc areas were vulnerable to outbreaks of fire and disease.|$|E
5|$|Mid-March brought warmer air to {{the country}} which thawed the snow lying on the ground. This {{snowmelt}} rapidly ran off the frozen ground into rivers and caused widespread flooding. More than 100,000 properties were affected, and the British Army and foreign <b>aid</b> <b>agencies</b> were required to provide humanitarian aid. With the cold spell over and the ground thawing, there were no further weather problems. The winter had severe effects on British industries, causing the loss of around 10per cent of the year's industrial production, 10to 20per cent of cereal and potato crops, and a quarter of sheep stocks. The ruling Labour Party began to lose its popularity, which led to them losing many seats to the Conservative Party in the 1950 election. That winter is also cited {{as a factor in}} the devaluation of the pound from $4.03 to $2.80, Britain's decline from being a superpower, and the introduction of the Marshall Plan to aid war-torn Europe. The effects on the rest of Europe were also severe, with 150 deaths from cold and famine in Berlin, civil disorder in the Netherlands and business closures in the Republic of Ireland.|$|E
5|$|During his vice-presidency, Kagame {{controlled}} the national army and maintained law and order, while other officials began rebuilding the country. Many RPF soldiers carried out retribution killings; it is disputed whether Kagame organised these, or was powerless to stop them. It {{is important to}} note that Kagame says he did not support these killings and failed to stop them. These soldiers however, were later put on trial. Hutu refugee camps formed in Zaire and other countries, which were controlled by the genocidaires (participants in the genocide) and threatened Rwanda's security. These camps were given food and medical aid by several western governments and <b>aid</b> <b>agencies.</b> The RPF attacked the camps in 1996, forcing many refugees to return home, but insurgents continued to attack Rwanda. The attack on the refugee camps killed an estimated 200,000 people. As part of the invasion, Kagame sponsored two controversial rebel wars in Zaire. The Rwandan- and Ugandan-backed rebels won the first war (1996–97), installing Laurent-Désiré Kabila as president in place of dictator Mobutu and renaming the country as the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). The second war was launched in 1998 against Kabila, and later his son Joseph, following the DRC government's expulsion of Rwandan and Ugandan military forces from the country. The war escalated into a continent-wide conflict which lasted until a 2003 peace deal and ceasefire.|$|E

The European Commission channeled €2million (US$2.1million) through the European Community Humanitarian Office for use by various relief organizations. Contributions to <b>aid</b> <b>agencies</b> were also made by the British Department for International Development (DFID), with initial contributions made to Christian Aid and CARE totaling £330,000 (US$540,837). DFID's initial emergency assistance was later increased to £3million (US$4.9million) and supplemented by a £25million ($40.9million) contribution {{over the course of}} six months. The Swiss Humanitarian Aid Unit allocated CHF 800,000 (US$779,666) to five Swiss relief organizations operating in India. Food aid worth A$300,000 (US$191,700) was sent by the Australian Government and delivered to approximately 1million people through the World Food Program. Other countries sent aid through their respective International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies branch. Following an initial disaster declaration by United States Ambassador to India Dick Celeste, the United States Agency for International Development contributed US$7,482,000 through Food for Peace and the Office of Foreign Disaster Assistance to complement recovery efforts. The United Nations Children's Fund allocated more than US$100,000to help supply basic health and shelter needs, while the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs made a similar allocation through an emergency grant and with reserves from an earlier grant from Norway.|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} {{aimed to}} develop {{a deeper understanding of}} trust and non-profit agency website design, and specifically focussed on the ‘Donate Now’ button. Two experiments investigated the effects of varying levels of consumer certainty, manipulated by providing varying levels of donation relevant information on the web homepage donation buttons, on <b>aid</b> <b>agency</b> trust and donation compliance. Both experiments were based on Study 1, a preliminary survey of website donation button design. Experiment 1 investigated the effects of iconic manipulation of the ‘Donate Now’ button. Results suggested that varying levels of consumer certainty through iconic manipulation of the website donation button design did not effect <b>aid</b> <b>agency</b> trust and donation compliance. Experiment 2 extended the research of Burt and Dunham (2009) to investigate the effects of varying consumer certainty levels through the provision of crisis/need and response photographs on the donation buttons. Results suggested that whilst there was no effect of level of certainty on donation compliance, there was an effect on <b>aid</b> <b>agency</b> trust. Participants’ rated <b>aid</b> <b>agency</b> trust was increased to the greatest extent in the level of greatest certainty, when the donation button contained photographs of both the crisis/need and agency response. Collectively, these results suggest that <b>aid</b> <b>agency</b> trust can be enhanced through the considered manipulation of donation button design. Subsequently photographic images may be a more effective means with which to portray donation-relevant information and reduce uncertainty. Furthermore, in both experiments results showed that those individuals who reported higher <b>aid</b> <b>agency</b> trust also reported significantly higher donation intention. Thus, the current research has implications for the non-profit sector, suggesting that whilst the internet is a viable fundraising tool, the commercially driven process of online donation generation should not be isolated from the psychological concept of trust...|$|R
