5000|$|GGB Bearing Technology {{was formed}} in 1976 as {{a joint venture between}} Garlock Inc., which was {{established}} after Olin J. Garlock invented a system for sealing piston rods in industrial steam engines in Palmyra, N.Y. in 1886 [...] or 1887, and Glacier <b>Antifriction</b> <b>Metal</b> Company, which had been founded in 1899.. Garlock had been the US distributor for Glacier's bearings from 1958.|$|E

Thus a {{new method}} of shaft necks {{processing}} is suggested for practical application, including application of soft <b>antifriction</b> <b>metal</b> coating, chosen from group: indium, tin, copper, silver, which differs that the coating is applied by electroerosion alloying {{on the shaft}} neck surface with discharge energy 0. 01 - 0. 03 J in the final operation, or the coating of copper or silver is applied with discharge energy 0. 04 - 0. 4 J and subject to post-processing, for example nonabrasive ultrasonic finishing. In such cases the surface layer with the microhardness less that the microhardness of the backing is formed. That promotes the fall of friction assembly normal operation and reduces the possibility of babbit microfractures formation in cubic crystals SnSb, which subsequently become the center of fractions formation in bulk of the layer...|$|E
40|$|Although {{there is}} no {{standardized}} list of alloys, most investigators have, to avoid confusion, concurred in at least grouping the metals under several general heads. Precious metals: gold, silver and the platinum group; the light metals: aluminum and magnesium; the non-ferrous metals (excluding all steels and iron-base alloys); and the <b>antifriction</b> <b>metals...</b>|$|R
40|$|From the {{practical}} point of view, this analysis shows that each problem of friction or wear requires its particular solution. There is no universal solution; one or {{other of the}} factors predominates and defines {{the choice of the}} solution. In certain cases, copper alloys of great thermal conductivity are preferred; in others, plastics abundantly supplied with water. Sometimes, soft <b>antifriction</b> <b>metals</b> are desirable to distribute the load; at other times, hard metals with high resistance to abrasion or heat...|$|R
