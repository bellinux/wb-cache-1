5|$|I've {{always tried}} to insert {{positivity}} into my songs wherever I can, to inspire other people who go through stuff. I mean the stuff they talked about in tabloids {{and the things that}} were so overly exaggerated, that's one aspect. I also went through <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>personal</b> stuff, a lot of family stuff this year. Losing a parent is an intense thing for anybody. It's brought me to another place. People are going to read into it as, 'This is Mariah and her struggle'. But the way I try to word it is, 'It's OK once you say I can make it through the rain.' Not just me going, 'I can make it through the rain,' it's me telling people that if you believe you can get through whatever you're going through, you can get to the other side.|$|E

25|$|In early 1992, prices skyrocketed {{throughout}} Russia, {{and a deep}} {{credit crunch}} shut down many industries and brought about a protracted depression. The reforms devastated the living standards {{of much of the}} population, especially the groups dependent on Soviet-era state subsidies and welfare entitlement programs. Through the 1990s, Russia's GDP fell by 50 percent, vast sectors of the economy were wiped out, inequality and unemployment grew dramatically, while incomes fell. Hyperinflation, caused by the Central Bank of Russia's loose monetary policy, wiped out <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>personal</b> savings, and tens of millions of Russians were plunged into poverty.|$|E
25|$|In the past, social {{networking}} services {{were viewed as}} a distraction and offered no educational benefit. Blocking these social networks {{was a form of}} protection for students against wasting time, bullying, and invasions of privacy. In an educational setting, Facebook, for example, is seen by many instructors and educators as a frivolous, time-wasting distraction from schoolwork, and {{it is not uncommon to}} be banned in junior high or high school computer labs. Cyberbullying has become an issue of concern with {{social networking}} services. According to the UK Children Go Online survey of 9- to 19-year-olds, it was found that a third have received bullying comments online. To avoid this problem, many school districts/boards have blocked access to social networking services such as Facebook, MySpace, and Twitter within the school environment. Social networking services often include <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>personal</b> information posted publicly, and many believe that sharing personal information is a window into privacy theft. Schools have taken action to protect students from this. It is believed that this outpouring of identifiable information and the easy communication vehicle that social networking services opens the door to sexual predators, cyberbullying, and cyberstalking. In contrast, however, 70% of social media using teens and 85% of adults believe that people are mostly kind to one another on social network sites.|$|E
500|$|Kolb {{expressed}} {{his desire to}} be the starting quarterback for the Eagles during the 2010 offseason: [...] "Obviously {{my goal is to}} be the starter and to start for 16 games and to lead this team {{as far as we can}} go. Personally, I don't have <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>personal</b> goals right now, they're more team-oriented, besides me getting on the field and proving I can take over this thing." [...] Kolb gained many comparisons to the situation Aaron Rodgers endured backing up Brett Favre during his first three seasons.

She did not disclose what her vote would be on the Syrian war, but said that it was an important decision and one which she needed to be there for.|$|R
5000|$|Lowery's lyrical content draws {{heavily from}} his Native American heritage. He refers to his style as being [...] "like a spiritual rap".

I went through <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>personal</b> turmoil right around the time Audioslave formed and unfortunately I think that affected the band a little bit in terms of me not really being grounded.... I think there was stuff that could have been resolved, and there was drama that was probably unnecessary, typical rock band stuff. I certainly played a role in it. I definitely feel like I was part of a lot of unnecessary stuff. It didn't need to become what it became. You learn with experience." ...|$|E
500|$|Hetfield {{stated that}} the album was written with [...] "a lot of passion". He said, [...] "There's two years of {{condensed}} emotion in this. We've gone through <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>personal</b> changes, struggles, epiphanies, it's deep. It's so deep lyrically and musically. [...] is just the best {{that it can be}} from us right now." [...] The band purposely wanted a raw sound on the album so that Rock did not polish the sound while mixing. The band desired the raw sound because of the depth of the emotion they felt {{and did not want to}} [...] "mess with it". Rock commented, [...] "I wanted to do something to shake up radio and the way everything else sounds. To me, this album sounds like four guys in a garage getting together and writing rock songs. There was really no time to get amazing performances out of James. We liked the raw performances. And we didn't do what everyone does and what I've been guilty of for a long time, which is tuning vocals. We just did it, boom, and that was it." ...|$|E
500|$|Suganami {{was deeply}} {{invested}} in Alien Soldier and devoted <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>personal</b> time to developing it. He began developing the game {{himself as the}} sole designer and programmer. At the time, Mega Drive games typically required two designers and two programmers, but Suganami wanted to challenge himself {{and see if it}} was possible to create the game himself. He originally had ambitious plans for a large backstory, but in order to make their deadline of 3 January 1995, the majority of it was cut from the game. As the deadline approached, he came to realize {{he would not be able}} to complete Alien Soldier himself, and so additional staff were added to provide him support. He worked overtime during the New Years holidays in order to complete the game while the market for the Mega Drive was quickly shrinking. Only about half of the team's original ideas were completed in time for release. They originally planned to create 100 bosses, but this was cut much shorter due to the time constraints. One of the bosses that was included, [...] "Seven Force", was originally featured in Gunstar Heroes.|$|E
60|$|In this strain General Feraud ran on, {{holding up}} his head with owlish eyes and rapacious beak. A mere fighter all his life, a cavalry man, a sabreur, he {{conceived}} war with the utmost simplicity as in the main <b>a</b> massed <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>personal</b> contests, <b>a</b> sort of gregarious duelling. And here he had on hand a war of his own. He revived. The shadow of peace had passed away from him like the shadow of death.

We want to use these technologies more easily. We thought to use the Windows System which diffused most widely and constructed a distributed environment.

5000|$|Bowie, who {{had written}} five pieces of music for his wedding {{ceremony}} to Iman, put two {{of them on the}} album: [...] "Pallas Athena" [...] and [...] "The Wedding Song / The Wedding". Writing these songs is what triggered Bowie to make the album. He said: Writing music for the wedding brought my mind around to, obviously, what commitment means and why I was getting married at this age and what my intentions were and were they honorable? laughs And what I really wanted from my life from now on. I guess it acted as a watershed to write <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> quite <b>personal</b> things, putting together a collection of songs that illustrated what I'd been going through over the past three or four years.|$|R
500|$|Although he did {{not focus}} less on Christian lyrical {{material}} for Undone, mainstream radio was on Millard's mind when he wrote the lyrics on the album. Millard attempted to write lyrics that, while still focused on God, tapped into the things people deal with every day. Further, he avoided using Christian jargon, as {{people who are not}} churchgoers might not understand what those terms mean; instead, he tried to be [...] "clearer in the things [...] were talking about". Another impact on the songwriting was the band's experiences over the previous year; while working on Undone, Millard and {{the other members of the}} band lost eight people close to them. Millard noted that [...] "There's <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>personal</b> stuff on [...] about the things we've gone through and how Christ has been the solution". One particular song, [...] "Homesick", was written after two incidents. The first incident occurred during the holiday season of 2004; a friend of Millard's lost her twin babies during pregnancy and was so far along in the pregnancy that doctors had to induce labor. After attending the funeral for the two babies, Millard wrote the chorus to the song. However, he didn't write any more to [...] "Homesick" [...] after that as {{he did not}} want to [...] "fake" [...] his way through writing it. Following the death of his brother-in-law Chris, however, Millard finished the song. Although Undone was [...] "essentially complete" [...] at that point, the band recorded and included it on the album.|$|E
500|$|On {{the first}} day in the studio, Garbage {{composed}} a new track, [...] "Right Between the Eyes", in 30 minutes. Other tracks written during the early sessions were [...] "Hangin' with the Bitches" [...] and [...] "Never Be Free" [...] (with John 5). Vig said that the quick start made the band feel optimistic and gave {{the impression that the}} album would be completed as rapidly as in six months, but [...] " [...] took a slow spiral downhill". Recording for the album was halted during the summer when Manson underwent surgery to remove a cyst on her right vocal cord, forcing her to recuperate until August 2003. On September 10, a backhoe careened into the outer walls of Smart Studios, causing extensive damage. Both Garbage and the band Paris, Texas had been working on their albums. The sessions were permeated by passive-aggressive tensions and an overall lack of artistic focus. According to Vig, [...] "there were <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>personal</b> arguments and we couldn't agree on songs". Manson suffered writer's block and had trouble writing lyrics, and Vig did not like the way the songs sounded. The drummer said that the group frequently argued during production, and that the entire band almost quit. Duke Erikson said that nobody could agree about the music's direction, and the band {{was on the verge of}} breaking up. He said, [...] "when you lose that common bond of the music, you've got nothing". Eventually, the group suffered [...] "a complete and utter band meltdown" [...] in October, leading the band members splitting and taking a break from the sessions.|$|E
2500|$|During an {{interview}} with Drowned in Sound in June 2009, Bixler-Zavala stated {{that he had been}} in discussions with the band's former members and suggested that they could get back together after they sorted their financial business out. He added, [...] "I wouldn't mind it. It might happen, we just have to iron out <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>personal</b> things. A lot of it we've dealt with already and I've apologized for a lot of things I've said and the way it ended... we'll see what happens." ...|$|E

5000|$|In an {{interview}} published on May 1, 2008, with the Bay Area Reporter, an LGBT news service, Simon {{was asked about}} the possibility of a performance in the True Colors Tour. She responded, [...] "The part that I could be involved in is the gay and lesbian part. The part that would be hard for me is to commit to a tour, because I'm not very comfortable being onstage. But the part that would be easiest for me would be singing on behalf of all of us. I don't consider myself to be not gay... I've enlarged all of my possibilities. I have <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> extremely <b>personal</b> stories to tell about that, but we won't go into that right now. Let's just say that it just depends upon who I'm with." ...|$|R
2500|$|Joanna Rapf, {{writing about}} the filming of The Verdict, states that Lumet gave <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>personal</b> {{attention}} to his actors, whether listening to them or touching them. She describes how Lumet and star Paul Newman {{sat on a bench}} secluded from the main set, where Newman had taken his shoes off, in order to privately discuss an important scene about to be shot[...] [...] [...] The actors walk through their scenes before the camera rolls. This preparation was done because Lumet likes to shoot a scene in one take, two at the most. Newman liked to call him [...] "Speedy Gonzales," [...] adding that Lumet did not shoot more than he had to. [...] "He doesn't give himself any protection. I know I would," [...] Newman said.|$|E
2500|$|In a September 2013 press release, Herrera Beutler {{announced}} that Abigail was getting healthier.

My driver and I were held separately in two interrogation rooms. I found the whole experience threatening. I was questioned about the contents of my briefcase." [...] Despite initial reports to the contrary, the singer's van, which was full of musical equipment, was not searched. [...] "I was questioned about lyrics of songs and I was asked <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>personal</b> questions about members of {{my family and my}} children and about my home. At no time was I given any explanation as to why I was being held and interrogated in this manner", he added. He said the fact that Irish people are still being treated this way on their way to Britain is very [...] "saddening". [...] "I had hoped to deal with this matter out of the public domain. But seeing as it has become a news item, I feel the need to offer my side of the story. I found the whole affair quite frightening." ...|$|E

Michie told Allison Jones of Inside Soap, [...] "Guy is very vulnerable, like a cornered animal, and he isn't really thinking straight.

5000|$|Minnie {{was known}} as a {{polished}} professional and an independent woman who knew {{how to take care of}} herself. She presented herself to the public as being feminine and ladylike, wearing expensive dresses and jewelry, but she was aggressive when she needed to be and was not shy when it came to fighting. According to the blues musician Johnny Shines, [...] "Any men fool with her she'd go for them right away. She didn't take no foolishness off them. Guitar, pocket knife, pistol, anything she get her hand on she'd use it". According to Homesick James, she chewed tobacco all the time, even while singing or playing the guitar, and always had a cup at hand in case she wanted to spit. Most of the music she made was autobiographical; Minnie expressed <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> her <b>personal</b> life in music.|$|R
