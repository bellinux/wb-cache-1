5|$|At {{the end of}} the Shaft Grave era, <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>and</b> <b>more</b> {{imposing}} type {{of elite}} burial emerged, the Tholos: large circular burial chambers with high vaulted roofs and a straight entry passage lined with stone.|$|E
5|$|In 1938, {{representative}} {{measures for}} embracing the German-Japanese partnership were sought {{and the construction}} of a new Japanese embassy building in Berlin was started. After the preceding embassy had to give way to Hitler's and Albert Speer's plans of re-modeling Berlin to the world capital city of Germania, <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>and</b> <b>more</b> pompous building was erected in a newly established diplomatic district next to the Tiergarten. It was conceived by Ludwig Moshamer under the supervision of Speer and was placed opposite the Italian embassy, thereby bestowing an architectural emphasis on the Rome-Berlin-Tokyo axis.|$|E
5|$|In February 2011, new {{packaging}} of Borjomi water presenting <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>and</b> <b>more</b> sophisticated modern {{look was}} introduced, accentuating relief {{of the deer}} image and sign of the manufacturer on the label. More than 40 countries, including Ukraine, Israel, the United States, Czech Republic, Poland, Bulgaria, Cyprus, Canada, Austria, Turkey, Japan, Spain, Belgium, the Netherlands, Greece, Australia, the United Arab Emirates, the United Kingdom and South Korea, will get Borjomi in newly designed bottles.|$|E

5|$|Knittel {{made many}} errors, {{especially}} in Latin text, {{he also did}} not decipher every word and left several lacunae in the reconstructed text (e.g. Romans 11:35; 12:2; 15:8). Tischendorf made <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>and</b> <b>more</b> accurate collation for the Latin text and edited in 1855. Tischendorf used abbreviations for the nomina sacra, he did not leave any lacunae.|$|E
5|$|While in {{his early}} teens, Tolkien had his first {{encounter}} with a constructed language, Animalic, an invention of his cousins, Mary and Marjorie Incledon. At that time, he was studying Latin and Anglo-Saxon. Their interest in Animalic soon died away, but Mary and others, including Tolkien himself, invented <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>and</b> <b>more</b> complex language called Nevbosh. The next constructed language he came to work with, Naffarin, would be his own creation.|$|E
5|$|Immediately {{after the}} last interment, the local rulers {{abandoned}} the shaft graves in favour of <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>and</b> <b>more</b> imposing form of tomb already developing in Messenia, south Peloponessus, the tholos. Around 1250 BC, when the fortifications of Mycenae were extended, the Grave Circle was included inside the new wall. A double ring peribolos wall was also built around the area. It appears that the site became a temenos (sacred precinct), while a circular construction, possibly an altar was found above one grave. The burial site had been replanned as a monument, {{an attempt by the}} 13th century BC Mycenean rulers to appropriate the possible heroic past of the older ruling dynasty. Under this context, the land surface was built up to make a level precinct for ceremonies, with the stelae over the graves being re-erected. A new entrance, the Lion Gate, was constructed near the site.|$|E

5|$|The {{video was}} quickly pulled after its release because it {{contained}} some technical errors. The clips {{of the people}} on Carey's television had their struggles captioned in dark text on a dark background, making it difficult to read. There were also continuity errors during the rainy balcony scene, as Carey's shirt would alternate between being soaking wet and dry. Consequently, a new music video was completed, which retained the clips of Carey's fans at the beginning but fixed the captions and replaced most of the interior shots of Carey with new footage. Carey, now in <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>and</b> <b>more</b> furnished apartment, does not go out into the rain but instead stays in her living room. She walks over to a large pair of windows aside a mural of large throw pillows and candles, singing and flailing her arms as she completes the song. As with the previous filming of the video, Carey's pain and sadness is resolved with a rainbow, shown {{at the end of the}} video.|$|E
5|$|The {{protagonist of}} Persona 3. He {{moves into the}} Iwatodai dorm, {{learning}} {{of his ability to}} summon the Personas Orpheus and Thanatos of The Death Arcana when the dorm is attacked by Shadows during the Dark Hour. Mitsuru asks him to join SEES and he is later elected the team's leader in combat. The protagonist is unique among his cohorts in that he has the Wild Card ability which enables him to wield multiple Personas and switch between them during battle. Over the course of the game, he also gains Messiah of the Judgement Arcana and Orpheus Telos of the Fool Arcana in Persona 3 FES. With the power of the Wild Card he has access to over 150 different Personas. He is also the only character with access to the Velvet Room, in which the player is able to fuse together multiple Personas together to create <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>and</b> <b>more</b> powerful one. Over the course of the game, the player is challenged to manage the protagonist's day-to-day schedule as he attends school, takes part in extracurricular activities, and spends time with classmates and other characters. Igor, the proprietor of the Velvet Room, encourages the protagonist to form Social Links with people, as they will determine his potential in combat. Social Links with characters in-game are represented by one of the Major Arcana and grants various bonuses during Persona fusion, increasing the player's proficiency in battle.|$|E

50|$|Channel drift or network decay is {{the gradual}} shift of a {{television}} network away from its original programming, to either target <b>a</b> <b>newer</b> <b>and</b> <b>more</b> profitable audience, or to broaden their viewership by including less niche programming. Often, {{this results in a}} shift from informative, quality programming aimed at the high culture and educated viewers, toward sensational, ratings-based, and/or reality-TV programming designed solely for the entertainment of a mass audience. Channel drift frequently features the incorporation of infotainment, reality television, and/or heavy advertising into the channel's lineup.|$|R
25|$|The Billings Bypass is {{a project}} {{designed}} to offer an alternative route into Billings Heights, to create <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>and</b> <b>more</b> direct connection between Billings and Lockwood and to connect I-90 with Montana Highway 87 and Old Highway 312. The study portion of the project is nearing its completion. Right of way acquisition should begin in 2013 along with final design followed by construction.|$|E
25|$|A {{significant}} portion of the Board's business was derived from the evening fares of people going out to social functions or events at places such as cinemas, dance halls, clubs, and the like. The introduction of television in the early 1960s gave people <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>and</b> <b>more</b> convenient way to spend their leisure time, significantly impacting on the popularity of these types of activities. A fall of 19% in the Board's revenue between 1962 and 1968 was largely down to the sale of fewer off-peak fares.|$|E
25|$|However, this {{experience}} {{would prove to}} be profitable for the future Spanish overseas expansion, because as the Spaniards were excluded from the lands discovered or to be discovered from the Canaries southward—and consequently from the road to India around Africa— they sponsored the voyage of Columbus towards the west (1492) in search of Asia to trade in its spices, encountering the Americas instead. Thus, the limitations imposed by the Alcáçovas treaty were overcome and <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>and</b> <b>more</b> balanced world's division would be reached at Tordesillas between both emerging maritime powers.|$|E
50|$|After Archie {{fails to}} make {{payments}} to a furniture leasing company, {{virtually all of the}} furniture in the house is repossessed and Baby Doll threatens to leave. Archie's competitor, Sicilian Silva Vacarro (Eli Wallach), who owns <b>a</b> <b>newer</b> <b>and</b> <b>more</b> modern cotton gin, has taken away all of Archie's business, and Archie retaliates by burning down Vacarro's gin that same night. Suspecting Archie as the arsonist, Vacarro plans a revenge plot and visits the farm the following day with truckloads of cotton, offering to pay Archie Lee to gin for him.|$|R
50|$|For {{long-range}} weapons, the 1860 Henry {{was tested}} against the 1894 Winchester in eliminating four targets at 50 yards and five targets on horseback. In the first test, the 1860 Henry scored a 40% hit ratio and 2 kills in 1:15 but jammed once while the 1894 Winchester scored a 40% hit ratio and 1 kill in 48s. In the second test, both weapons scored a 3/5 hit ratio with 2 kills to the 1860 Henry and 1 kill to the 1894 Winchester. The edge {{was given to}} the 1894 Winchester since it was <b>a</b> <b>newer</b> <b>and</b> <b>more</b> reliable rifle.|$|R
50|$|Coal {{for this}} early {{production}} came from Utah Fuel Company Mine No. 2 at Sunnyside, Utah, and was {{transported to the}} mill via the Union Pacific Railroad. In 1950, Kaiser Steel purchased the entire Sunnyside, Utah facility. In 1955, Kaiser purchased 500000 acre of land near Raton, New Mexico, for future expanded production. The existing mine at this Raton location, named the Koehler Mine, was operated <b>and</b> upgraded until <b>a</b> <b>newer</b> <b>and</b> <b>more</b> modern mine could be completed. This new mine, named York Canyon Mine, served as {{the major source of}} coking coal until the Fontana Mill closed in 1983.|$|R

25|$|In 1987, Levada and {{six other}} bishops were chosen by Cardinal Ratzinger to edit the {{forthcoming}} Catechism of the Catholic Church. When the Catechism was completed in 1993, the first English translation was very loose and used {{a great deal of}} inclusive language. Along with Archbishop Eric D'Arcy of Hobart, Australia and Fr. John Wall, Levada insisted that this be replaced with a more literal translation, and it was <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>and</b> <b>more</b> literal translation that was published in English in 1994. Levada also authored the glossary for the second edition of the Catechism.|$|E
25|$|After the war, the French Navy had {{an urgent}} {{requirement}} for a powerful carrier-born close-air support aircraft to operate from the French Navy's four aircraft carriers that it {{acquired in the}} late 1940s (Two former U.S. Navy and two Royal Navy carriers were transferred). Secondhand US Navy Douglas SBD Dauntless dive-bombers of Flotille 3F and 4F were used to attack enemy targets and support ground forces {{in the north of}} Indo-China. Former US Grumman F6F-5 Hellcats and Curtiss SB2C Helldivers replaced the Dauntless in attacking roads, bridges and providing close air support. <b>A</b> <b>new</b> <b>and</b> <b>more</b> capable aircraft was needed.|$|E
40|$|This work {{presents}} <b>a</b> <b>newer</b> <b>and</b> <b>more</b> complete {{version of}} an educational tool {{to be used in}} signal processing interpolation-related subjects. Besides the consolidation of acquired theoretical knowledge, the tool allows now its users to apply three error geometry patterns, test minimum or maximum dimension signal reconstruction algorithms and problem conditioning through the analysis of the matrix spectral radius or the condition number: these new features gives the possibility to alter the problem definitions to the desired goal before the reconstruction begins. The time unit that measures the algorithms performance is ¶(n log n) thus independent from the machine’s architecture. A video of the developed tool can be seen in: [URL]...|$|R

25|$|In {{southern}} Eritrea, the Aussa Sultanate (Afar Sultanate) succeeded {{the earlier}} Imamate of Aussa. The latter polity {{had come into}} existence in 1577, when Muhammed Jasa moved his capital from Harar to Aussa (Asaita) with the split of the Adal Sultanate into Aussa and the Sultanate of Harar. At some point after 1672, Aussa declined in conjunction with Imam Umar Din bin Adam's recorded ascension to the throne. In 1734, the Afar leader Kedafu, head of the Mudaito clan, seized power and established the Mudaito Dynasty. This marked the start of <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>and</b> <b>more</b> sophisticated polity that would last into the colonial period.|$|E
25|$|On 10 May 1752 Littleton married Frances Horton, {{daughter}} of Christopher Horton of Catton Hall, near Walton-on-Trent, Derbyshire. The Hortons {{had just had}} their medieval manor house demolished {{to make way for}} a large baroque building more in keeping with the times. Pillaton Hall was a 16th-century structure, originally conceived as simply a manor house for the small Littleton estate of Pillaton and Otherton. Littleton soon began work on <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>and</b> <b>more</b> impressive seat for the family. It was said that two large hoards of coins were discovered in 1742 and 1749 behind panels at Pillaton Hall, which raised the sum of £15,000 on sale, and thus defrayed the costs of the new hall.|$|E
25|$|Simons' {{mathematical}} {{work has}} primarily {{focused on the}} geometry and topology of manifolds. His 1962 Berkeley PhD thesis, written {{under the direction of}} Bertram Kostant, gave <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>and</b> <b>more</b> conceptual proof of Berger's classification of the holonomy groups of Riemannian manifolds, which is now a cornerstone of modern geometry. He subsequently began to work with Shing-Shen Chern on the theory of characteristic classes, eventually discovering the Chern–Simons secondary characteristic classes of 3-manifolds, which are deeply related to the Yang-Mills functional on 4-manifolds, and have {{had a profound effect on}} modern physics. These and other contributions to geometry and topology led to Simons becoming the 1976 recipient of the AMS Oswald Veblen Prize in Geometry. In 2014, he was elected to the National Academy of Sciences of the USA.|$|E

25|$|Windows Media Audio (WMA) is {{the name}} of a series of audio codecs and their {{corresponding}} audio coding formats developed by Microsoft. It is a proprietary technology that forms part of the Windows Media framework. WMA consists of four distinct codecs. The original WMA codec, known simply as WMA, was conceived as a competitor to the popular MP3 and RealAudio codecs. WMA Pro, <b>a</b> <b>newer</b> <b>and</b> <b>more</b> advanced codec, supports multichannel and high resolution audio. A lossless codec, WMA Lossless, compresses audio data without loss of audio fidelity (the regular WMA format is lossy). WMA Voice, targeted at voice content, applies compression using a range of low bit rates. Microsoft has also developed a digital container format called Advanced Systems Format to store audio encoded by WMA.|$|R
30|$|While {{we cannot}} change the past, the {{survival}} of the human civilization requires <b>a</b> <b>newer</b> <b>and</b> <b>more</b> “intellectually-evolved” generation—humans who are better equipped at making intelligent decisions by the use of the essential skills of modeling, simulation, and visualization for each outcome rather than first trying everything out in the real world. Such individuals would thus have the ability to understand and find solutions to complex problems -problems that may not have  any easy solution primarily due to their inherent complexity. These individuals would be better equipped to approach these problems by using mechanisms involving advanced techniques such as simplification and abstraction by gradually representing the real-world with less computationally involved models. Learning such abilities is paramount in not only educating future researchers but also for the sustainability of the human civilization.|$|R
