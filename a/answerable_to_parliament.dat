25|$|The Attorney General is a non-cabinet {{minister}} {{who leads the}} Attorney General's Office. The rule that no Attorney General may be a cabinet minister is a political convention rather than a law, and {{for a short time}} the Attorney General did sit in cabinet, starting with Lord Birkenhead in 1915 and ending with Douglas Hogg in 1928. There is nothing that prohibits Attorneys-General from attending meetings of the cabinet, and on occasion they have been asked to attend meetings to advise the government on the best course of action legally. Despite this it is considered preferable to exclude Attorneys General from cabinet meetings so as to draw a distinct line between them and the political decisions on which they are giving legal advice. As a government minister, the Attorney General is directly <b>answerable</b> <b>to</b> <b>Parliament.</b>|$|E
2500|$|The role of {{the member}} of the Parliament of Tuvalu in the {{parliamentary}} democracy by established in the Constitution, {{and the ability of}} a Falekaupule (the traditional assembly of elders of each island) to direct an MP as to their conduct as a member, was considered in Nukufetau v Metia. The Falekaupule of Nukufetau directed Lotoala Metia, the elected member of parliament, as to which group of members he should join and when this directive was not followed the Falekaupule ordered Metia to resign as a member of parliament. When Falekaupule attempted to enforce these directives through legal action, the High Court determined that the Constitution is structured around the concept of a parliamentary democracy; and that “ne of the most fundamental aspects of parliamentary democracy is that, whilst a person is elected to represent the people of the district from which he is elected, he is not bound to act in accordance with the directives of the electorate either individually or as a body. He is elected because a majority of the voters regard him as the candidate best equipped to represent them and their interests in the government of their country. He is bound by the rules of parliament and <b>answerable</b> <b>to</b> <b>parliament</b> for the manner in which he acts. Should he lose the confidence of the electorate, he cannot be obliged to resign and he can only be removed for one of the reasons set out in sections 96 to 99 of the Constitution.” ...|$|E

50|$|Many parliaments {{are part}} of a {{parliamentary}} system of government, in which the executive is constitutionally <b>answerable</b> <b>to</b> the <b>parliament.</b> Some restrict {{the use of the word}} <b>parliament</b> <b>to</b> parliamentary systems, while others use the word for any elected legislative body. Parliaments usually consist of chambers or houses, and are usually either bicameral or unicameral although more complex models exist, or have existed (see Tricameralism).|$|R

No provision existed for a prime minister.|$|R

2500|$|The ECB {{has stated}} that [...] "printing a €1 note is more {{expensive}} (and less durable) than minting a €1 coin". On 18 November 2004 the ECB decided definitively that there was insufficient demand across the Eurozone for very-low-denomination banknotes. On 25 October 2005, however, {{more than half of}} the MEPs supported a motion calling on the European Commission and the European Central Bank to recognise the definite need for the introduction of €1 and €2 banknotes.

50|$|The Prime Ministry {{was founded}} in 1320 in the Ottoman Empire. In the Empire, the prime {{minister}} of the Ottoman sultan held the title of Grand Vizier (Sadrazam). After the Tanzimat period in the 19th century, the grand viziers came to assume a role more like that of the prime ministers of contemporary Western European monarchies. Later, with the Ottoman constitution of 1876, a <b>parliament</b> was established <b>to</b> oversee the prime minister, and the prime minister formed a cabinet. With the amendments to the constitution during the Second Constitutional Era, the prime minister was made <b>answerable</b> <b>to</b> the <b>parliament</b> rather than the sultan. Finally, with the declaration of republic in 1923, the appointer of the prime minister became the president, instead of the sultan.|$|R
50|$|Authority over {{military}} affairs was vested with two {{member of the}} Governor General's Council. One was the Military Member, who supervised all administrative and financial matters through the Army Department based at Government House; {{the other was the}} Commander-in-Chief who was responsible for all operational matters. With the abolishment of the EIC in 1858 the Governor-General was re-designated the Viceroy, overseen by the Secretary of State for India, a cabinet minister in London heading the India Office, who was in turn <b>answerable</b> <b>to</b> the British <b>parliament</b> in Westminster.|$|R

2500|$|The Joint Intelligence Committee (JIC), {{under the}} Cabinet Secretariat, is {{responsible}} for co-ordinating and analysing intelligence activities between R, the Intelligence Bureau and the Defence Intelligence Agency (DIA). In practice, however, {{the effectiveness of the}} JIC has been varied. With the establishment of the National Security Council in 1999, the role of the JIC has been merged with the NSC. R's legal status is unusual, in that it is not an [...] "Agency", but a [...] "Wing" [...] of the Cabinet Secretariat. Hence, R is not <b>answerable</b> <b>to</b> the <b>Parliament</b> of India on any issue, which keeps it out of reach of the Right to Information Act. This exemption was granted through Section 24 read with Schedule II of the act. However, information regarding the allegations of corruption and human rights violations has to be disclosed.|$|R

If the governor general attends a meeting of the council of ministers, he/she shall do so in an advisory capacity.The prime minister and other ministers shall be appointed and dismissed by national ordinance. If a minister no longer enjoys the confidence of the parliament, he/she shall surrender his/her office. The Minister of Plenipotentiary must have the Dutch nationality. This person represents the island in the Kingdom Council of Ministers meetings in The Hague, The Netherlands. The minister also has his/her office in the Netherlands under the banner of the [...] "St. Maarten House."Each minister heads one of seven ministries which are established by national ordinance.|$|R
2500|$|Such {{structures}} {{matched the}} {{theory in the}} British dominions, such as Canada and Australia, where in powers belonged to the governor-general {{and there was no}} normal responsibility <b>to</b> <b>parliament.</b> In reality, governments had long come to be chosen from <b>parliament</b> and <b>to</b> be <b>answerable</b> <b>to</b> it. [...] Prime ministerial offices had come into de facto existence. Such developments were also expected to happen in Northern Ireland and Southern Ireland, but technically were not required under the Act.|$|R
50|$|The {{election}} {{was conducted by}} the Tasmanian Electoral Commission, an independent body <b>answerable</b> <b>to</b> <b>Parliament.</b> As in past Tasmania state elections, the proportional Hare-Clark system was used to allocate the 25 seats in the House.

50|$|The Supreme Court has too {{held that}} if the {{government}} fails to consult UPSC in the matters ascribed under Art 320, does not invalidate {{the decision of the}} government.
