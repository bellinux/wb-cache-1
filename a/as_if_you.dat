5|$|Abbott {{has created}} several games, {{including}} card games, board games, and one equipment game. As a whole, his games {{are not of}} particular fame, although they have some unique elements that set them apart from mainstream games. For instance, the card game Metamorphosis is a complex trick-taking game. As you play the game, the rules change three times, so it is <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> are playing four different games that are threaded together.|$|E

25|$|If I had {{not heard}} long ago from other people {{that you were a}} fool, I might now have known it of myself, since you thought I was sitting in an empty jug, and went to cover it up with your hand, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> had me caught.

Just <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> were to see the lifeless corpse of a man lying far away, it would be fitting to list all the causes of death in order to make sure that the single cause of this death may be stated. For you would not be able to {{establish}} conclusively that he died by the sword or of cold or of illness or perhaps by poison, but we know that there is something of this kind that happened to him.|$|E
500|$|This {{was not to}} be. Nielsen was {{admitted}} to Copenhagen's National Hospital (Rigshospitalet) on 1 October 1931 following a series of heart attacks. He died there at ten minutes past midnight on 3 October, surrounded by his family.

500|$|Dylan {{wrote this}} song on hearing from Suze Rotolo {{that she was}} {{considering}} staying in Italy indefinitely, and he used a melody he adapted from Paul Clayton's song [...] "Who's Gonna Buy You Ribbons (When I'm Gone)". In the Freewheelin sleeve notes, Dylan comments: [...] "It isn't a love song. It's a statement that maybe you can say to make yourself feel better.

500|$|Amy Taubin of Film Comment {{described}} The Hurt Locker as [...] "a structuralist war movie" [...] and [...] "a totally immersive, off-the-charts high-anxiety {{experience from}} beginning to end." [...] Taubin praised Ackroyd's [...] "brilliant" [...] cinematography with multiple viewpoints. She said of the film's editing, [...] "Bob Murawski and Chris Innis's editing is similarly quick and nervous; the rapid changes in POV as they cut from one camera's coverage to another's makes you feel <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>you,</b> like the characters, are under threat from all sides." ...|$|E

500|$|At Game Revolution, Devin Charles wrote a very {{positive}} review, awarding the game a 4.5/5 score. He felt that the game was very replayable, praising the amount of content that the game delivered {{as well as its}} online play. [...] "The game's overall presentation is solid, with the commentary and action cutscenes always making you feel <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> {{are a part of the}} heated battles and help keep the game flowing and relevant," [...] Charles stated in his review. His only criticism was the HUT mode and how little it was altered from the previous year.|$|E
500|$|The 1978 {{release of}} Powerage marked {{the debut of}} bassist Cliff Williams, and with its harder riffs, {{followed}} the blueprint set by Let There Be Rock. Only one single was released from Powerage, [...] "Rock 'n' Roll Damnation/Sin City". An appearance at the Apollo Theatre, Glasgow during the Powerage tour was recorded and released <b>as</b> <b>If</b> <b>You</b> Want Blood You've Got It, featuring such songs as [...] "Whole Lotta Rosie", [...] "Problem Child", and [...] "Let There Be Rock", as well as lesser-known album tracks like [...] "Riff Raff". Powerage was the last album produced by Harry Vanda and George Young that had lead vocals by Bon Scott, and is claimed to be AC/DC's most under-rated album.|$|E
500|$|The Washington Post concurred in this assessment, {{describing}} {{the premise of}} the show as [...] "Hey, what happens if you take the characters from Seinfeld and give them eating disorders?" [...] While crediting Starved for [...] "a few inventive laughs," [...] the language and sexuality of the show are described as [...] "exceptionally coarse" [...] and [...] "outrageous for cable television, even later at night." [...] Worse than these issues, the Post felt that Schaeffer neglected to develop the characters in favor of coming up with contrived situations for them. [...] "his failure to build understanding into the show dooms it to emptiness, with a sour aftertaste. <b>As</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> had just, you know, hurled." ...|$|E

500|$|A {{music video}} {{directed}} by Marc Webb and Rich Lee was filmed in Budapest, Hungary between June 11 and June 14, 2007.

A writer for MTV News found the video to be [...] "dark and cinematic, it's almost <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> swallowed an entire feature length film in 3 minutes." [...] Another {{writer for the}} rock magazine Blender was negative towards the video saying that it [...] "makes singer Amy Lee's soul bearing that much more drawn-out with ill-advised slow motion shots of (yep) decay and destruction. (Oh, {{look at the record}} melt!) Redemption? You got it in the form of CGI tree roots, a breaking sunrise and a sudden wet t-shirt contest.

500|$|The most {{important}} advice he gives aspiring songwriters {{is to write}} what you know or what you've experienced. [...] "Use reality as the springboard to whatever you're writing about", Paul said. Paul also says that being a successful songwriter is like being a journalist who writes about what he sees and knows, the times people are living in and the things people are facing today. [...] "The journalist {{looks out the window}} and writes about what is really happening." [...] "I make sure it's real. [...] I don't want to fictionalize about things I haven't witnessed." [...] Paul states that over the years he's learned the value of simplicity in writing. He's learned that he can say more when he writes more simply and direct. [...] "It's almost <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> can be complex and intricate by adopting a shorter, less complicated structure." [...] "I'm not doing rocket science -- I'm a storyteller", he said. [...] "I hope to inspire people to think and feel and to walk out with more than they came in with." ...|$|E
500|$|In February 2015, Neill Blomkamp posted [...] concept art on his Instagram feed, {{saying in}} an {{interview}} that he had been [...] "wanting to make an Alien film for like years and years" [...] and had developed the story and artwork after working on Chappie with Weaver. Weaver responded that she would be willing to reprise her role as Ripley if Blomkamp was directing. On February 18, 2015, it was confirmed that Blomkamp would direct a new Alien film featuring Weaver. Although no official statement was made, the film was believed to disregard the events of Alien 3 and Resurrection, and instead directly follow Aliens. Blomkamp denied these rumors, saying instead that he simply favored the first two films and wanted his to tie into them. Weaver has specified [...] "it's just <b>as</b> <b>if,</b> <b>you</b> know, the path forks and one direction goes off to Alien 3 and Alien Resurrection and another direction goes off to Neill's movie." [...] In March 2015, Blomkamp reported that the title of the film would not be Alien 5 and further confirmed plans for more than one Alien sequel/prequel.|$|E

500|$|Cuba's burgeoning tourist {{industry}} {{of the late}} 1990s benefited from this rebirth of interest. According to The Economist, [...] "In the tourist quarters of Old Havana it can seem at times as if every Cuban with a guitar has come out to sing the songs that Buena Vista made famous. It's <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> were to go to Liverpool and find bands singing Beatles songs on every street corner." [...] The songs Buena Vista sings are often not their own compositions. Some songs they sing have long been popular in Cuba and people have always performed them in the street. Despite {{the appeal of the}} [...] "Buena Vista" [...] ambience to tourists, Cubans themselves were less aware of the [...] "Buena Vista Social Club" [...] than international music listeners. This was due to the foreign nature of the production, and the dominance of modern Timba, Songo and other musical forms on the island, such as reggaetón by luminaries such as Raul Zeballos, the creator of the genre. Some explain that Buena Vista did not impact the Cuban audience, as they were not creating anything new; they were just playing the same songs that Cubans know and have been playing for many years.|$|E
500|$|Later that year, Padukone {{played the}} part of a businessperson who helps Ranbir Kapoor's {{character}} overcome his conflicts in Imtiaz Ali's romantic drama Tamasha. Despite poor financial returns, Sukanya Verma of Rediff.com named Padukone's performance as the best by an actress that year, writing that she [...] "is so potent in Tamasha, it’s almost <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> can hear her heartbeat across the screen". In her final release of 2015, Padukone reunited with Sanjay Leela Bhansali and Ranveer Singh in Bajirao Mastani, a historical drama about a tragic extramarital affair. Singh was cast as the maratha general Bajirao I, while Priyanka Chopra and Padukone featured as his first and second wife, respectively. In preparation for the role of the warrior-princess Mastani, Padukone learnt sword-fighting, horse-riding and kalaripayattu. [...] With a revenue of over , Bajirao Mastani proved to be the fourth highest-grossing Bollywood film of the year. Anupama Chopra found Padukone [...] "riveting" [...] in the film, but Subhash K. Jha while praising her [...] "grace and dignity" [...] thought that she was [...] "way too subtle and silken, and not steely enough as [...] firebrand warrior-princess". The film was showcased at the International Film Festival of India; at the 61st Filmfare Awards, Bajirao Mastani was named Best Film and Padukone received her second Best Actress nomination in that year.|$|E
500|$|In a Bloomberg West {{interview}} with Emily Chang on August 26, 2015, Andy Cunningham called it [...] "a wonderful film.... It's an incredible character {{study of a}} really complex man. Aaron [...] and Danny Boyle did a fabulous job with it." [...] Her portrayal by Sarah Snook was a [...] "small role but professionally done." [...] The film also portrays Andy as participating in the iMac launch, {{even though she was}} not working with Apple at that time. Journalist Walt Mossberg compared Steve Jobs to the Orson Welles film Citizen Kane, which was loosely based on the life of William Randolph Hearst. Mossberg has stated that while both films are aesthetically well-developed, Welles created a fictional set of characters in order to clarify that his film was a work of fiction. In contrast, according to Mossberg (who knew Jobs for 14 years), Sorkin's decision to use real instead of fictional names detracts from the quality of a film which appears to be a biopic and yet is a work of fiction. Mossberg states that [...] "the Steve Jobs portrayed in Sorkin's film isn't the man I knew. Sorkin chose to cherry-pick and exaggerate some of the worst aspects of Jobs' character, and to focus on a period of his career when he was young and immature [...] It would be <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> made a movie called JFK almost entirely focused on Kennedy's womanizing and political rivalries, and said nothing about civil rights and the Cuban Missile Crisis. Sorkin opts to end his story just as Jobs is poised to both reel off an unprecedented string of world-changing products and to mature into a much broader, kinder manager and person." ...|$|E
