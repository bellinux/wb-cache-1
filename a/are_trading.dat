The map consists of a landlocked sea with several islands, wreckage, sea creatures, enemy ships, ports, and whirlpools. The player can sometimes encounter message bottles that clear away fog of war on the map to reveal hidden ports.Sea creatures and enemy ships appear randomly and challenge the player for gold or commodities in a card minigame. Ports <b>are</b> <b>trading</b> and safe zones where the player can sell commodities, buy upgrades for the ship, and take on sidequests. Whirlpools teleport the player's ship to a random location on the map.|$|E

25|$|Value {{investing}} {{was established}} by Benjamin Graham and David Dodd, both professors at Columbia Business School and teachers of many famous investors. In Graham's book The Intelligent Investor, he advocated the important concept of margin of safety— first introduced in Security Analysis, a 1934 book he co-authored with David Dodd— which calls for an approach to investing that is focused on purchasing equities at prices less than their intrinsic values. In terms of picking or screening stocks, he recommended purchasing firms who have steady profits, <b>are</b> <b>trading</b> at low prices to book value, have low price-to-earnings (P/E) ratios, and who have relatively low debt.|$|E

25|$|EMEA: European, Middle Eastern and African {{issuances}} <b>are</b> <b>trading</b> usually out of Europe, London {{being the}} biggest node followed by Paris {{and to a}} lesser extent Frankfurt and Geneva. It represents about 25% of the global market and shows a greater diversity in terms of structures (e.g. from CoCoCo's to French OCEANE). Because of that lack of standardisation, it is often considered to be more technical and unforgiving than the American market from a trading perspective. A very tiny amount of the volumes is traded on exchange while the vast majority is done OTC without a price reporting system (e.g. like TRACE). Liquidity is significantly lower than on the Northern American market.

[...] Jesus Freak Hideout contends [...] "While all too many rock outfits <b>are</b> <b>trading</b> their chugging riffs for more modest melodies and radio-friendly cuts, it's exciting to hear a band like Disciple continuing on and just being themselves, all the while carrying the flag into battle {{in the name of}} Christ." [...] Christian Music Review suggests [...] "Disciple shares their bold passion for Christ with fast drumming, heavy guitars, strong bass, and intense screaming on their newest album, Attack.

[...] 365 Days of Inspiring Media discerns [...] "Attacks rockers are great, but the lyrics are what sets the album apart." ...|$|E
2500|$|Unlike a stock market, {{the foreign}} {{exchange}} market is divided into levels of access. At the top is the interbank {{foreign exchange market}}, which {{is made up of}} the largest commercial banks and securities dealers. Within the interbank market, spreads, which are the difference between the bid and ask prices, are razor sharp and not known to players outside the inner circle. The difference between the bid and ask prices widens (for example from 0 to 1 pip to 1–2 pips for currencies such as the EUR) as you go down the levels of access. This is due to volume. If a trader can guarantee large numbers of transactions for large amounts, they can demand a smaller difference between the bid and ask price, which is referred to as a better spread. The levels of access that make up the foreign exchange market are determined {{by the size of the}} [...] "line" [...] (the amount of money with which they <b>are</b> <b>trading).</b> The top-tier interbank market accounts for 51% of all transactions. From there, smaller banks, followed by large multi-national corporations (which need to hedge risk and pay employees in different countries), large hedge funds, and even some of the retail market makers. According to Galati and Melvin, “Pension funds, insurance companies, mutual funds, and other institutional investors have played an increasingly important role in financial markets in general, and in FX markets in particular, since the early 2000s.” (2004) In addition, he notes, “Hedge funds have grown markedly over the 2001–2004 period in terms of both number and overall size”. Central banks also participate in the foreign exchange market to align currencies to their economic needs.|$|E
