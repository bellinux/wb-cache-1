25|$|When skeining from wheel spun yarn, the bobbin {{can either}} {{be removed from the}} wheel and placed on a kate, or skeined {{directly}} from the wheel. If the bobbin is left on the wheel the tension on the drive band must be lessened in order to allow the bobbin to turn freely. Yarn spun on spindles {{can either be}} left on the spindle, or slipped onto <b>a</b> <b>dowel</b> for plying. The spindle or dowel is either placed in a lazy kate, or even a bowl to keep the spindle in one place while winding off the yarn.|$|E
2500|$|American Northwest coast {{native peoples}} {{traditionally}} used adzes for both functional construction (from bowls to canoes) and art (from masks to totem poles). [...] Northwest coast adzes take two forms: hafted and D-handle. [...] The hafted form {{is similar in}} form to a European adze with the haft constructed from a natural crooked branch which approximately forms a 60% angle. [...] The thin end is used as the handle and the thick end is flattened and notched such that an adze iron can be lashed to it. Modern hafts are sometimes constructed from a sawed blank with <b>a</b> <b>dowel</b> added for strength at the crook. [...] The second form is the D-handle adze which is basically an adze iron with a directly attached handle. [...] The D-handle therefore provides no mechanical leverage. [...] Northwest coast adzes are often classified by size and iron shape vs. role. [...] As with European adzes, iron shapes include straight, gutter and lipped. [...] Where larger Northwest adzes are similar in size to their European counterparts, the smaller sizes are typically much lighter such {{that they can be}} used for the detailed smoothing, shaping and surface texturing required for figure carving. [...] Final surfacing is sometimes performed with a crooked knife.|$|E

In its original manufactured form, <b>a</b> <b>dowel</b> is called <b>a</b> <b>dowel</b> rod. Dowel rods are often cut into short lengths called dowel pins.

Modern quad guttering has replaced the original ogee profile and acroteria. Timber stumps have been supplanted by concrete and the front fence has been replaced.|$|R
50|$|The {{traditional}} {{tool for}} making dowels is <b>a</b> <b>dowel</b> plate, an iron(or better, hardened tool steel) {{plate with a}} hole {{the size of the}} desired dowel. To make <b>a</b> <b>dowel,</b> a piece of wood is split or whittled to a size slightly bigger than desired and then driven {{through the hole in the}} dowel plate. The sharp edges of the hole shear off the excess wood.|$|E

50|$|<b>A</b> cross <b>dowel</b> is <b>a</b> cylindrically shaped metal nut (i.e., <b>a</b> metal <b>dowel)</b> {{that is used}} to join {{two pieces}} of wood. Like other metal nuts, it has an inside {{threaded}} hole, although the hole is unusual in that it passes through the sides of the dowel. One or both ends of the dowel are slotted, with the slots oriented parallel to the threaded hole through which the bolt will pass.|$|R

50|$|A {{variation}} of the dowel method for reinforcement {{is the use of}} <b>a</b> Miller <b>dowel</b> in place of the usual straight cylindrical dowel. The Miller <b>dowel</b> is <b>a</b> stepped <b>dowel</b> and is drilled with a special stepped drill bit. It is drilled from the outside face of the frame piece to be joined and therefore generally leaves <b>an</b> exposed <b>dowel</b> protruding after glue dries, and the excess dowell head is thus usually flush cut. The advantages of the special dowel are documented in various media promoting the method, but one advantage that should not be overlooked is speed of assembly. The butt joint can often be joined temporarily and sometimes more accurately with simply glue, allowing faster set up than the usual tedious alignment procedures mentioned above. After the glue dries one or more Miller dowels are then used to reinforce the joint. Dowel trimming and sanding of the surface, followed by normal finishing then proceed in the usual manner. The blind alignment problems of floating dowels are virtually eliminated by the use of the Miller dowel. Not all projects are appropriate for the stepped <b>dowel</b> method if <b>an</b> exposed <b>dowel</b> end is not visually acceptable, however.|$|R

50|$|Bolts in a {{bolted joint}} often have an {{important}} function as <b>a</b> <b>dowel,</b> resisting shear forces. For this reason, many bolts have a plain unthreaded section to their shank. This gives a closer fit to the hole and also avoids some problems with fretting wear when a screw thread bears against an unthreaded component.|$|E

50|$|<b>A</b> <b>dowel</b> bar {{retrofit}} (DBR) is {{a method}} of reinforcing cracks in highway pavement by inserting steel dowel bars in slots cut across the cracks. It is a technique several states have successfully used to address faulting in older jointed plain concrete pavements. The typical approach is to saw cut and jackhammer out the slots for the dowels. Following dowel placement the slots are then typically backfilled with a non-shrink concrete mixture (grout) and the pavement is diamond-ground to restore smoothness.|$|E
