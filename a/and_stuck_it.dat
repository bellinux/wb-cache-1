25|$|After a year hiatus, the Greys {{returned}} with a short bench and started the rebuilding process. Not much hope of a competitive season was ever tossed Owen Sound's way. But what makes the return a success isn't the season record—it {{was the lack of}} a mass exodus of players at the Christmas Break. Players bought into the rebuilding process <b>and</b> <b>stuck</b> <b>it</b> out which earned a tremendous amount of respect from around the league and left the Greys in a good position with a solid nucleus to build on for next season.|$|E
25|$|I {{was saved}} {{from the gas}} chambers, saved from Hitler. I spent several years in Nazi death camps. Besides {{the fact that they}} murdered my wife and 11 children, my mother, my sisters and my brother – of my whole family, some 150 people, I {{was the only one who}} survived – I {{witnessed}} their cruelty. I remember as if it were today how they shot me in the arm. I was afraid to go to the Nazi infirmary, though there were doctors there. I knew that if I went in, I'd never come out alive. … Despite my fear of the Nazis, I plucked a leaf from a tree <b>and</b> <b>stuck</b> <b>it</b> to my wound to stanch the bleeding. Then I cut a branch and tied it around the wound to hold it in place. With God's help, it healed in three days. Then I promised myself that if, with God's help, I got well and got out of there, away from those resha'im (wicked people), I would build a hospital in Eretz Yisrael where every human being would be cared for with dignity. And the basis of that hospital would be that the doctors and nurses would believe that there is a God in this world and that when they treat a patient, they are fulfilling the greatest mitzvah in the Torah.|$|E

Not a pleasant sound but it's the noise we had. We pressed it up <b>and</b> <b>stuck</b> <b>it</b> out. A celebration of sorts." [...] Jimmy Cauty defended sampling as an artistic practice: [...] "It's not as if we're taking anything away, just borrowing and making things bigger. If you're creative you aren't going to stop working just because there is a law against what you are doing." ...|$|E

The decision to begin the track with a snippet of [...] "By the Sea" [...] came about due to laziness on the band's part—the track had originally being conceived as a duet but the group [...] "never got around to getting anyone to sing" [...] with them so they [...] "chopped up the Wendy & Bonnie song <b>and</b> <b>stuck</b> <b>it</b> on [...] it's in the same key [...] seemed to make sense".

2500|$|In April 1864, Chamberlain {{returned}} to the Army of the Potomac and was promoted to brigade commander shortly before the Siege of Petersburg and given command of the 1st Brigade, First Division, V Corps. In a major action on June 18, during the Second Battle of Petersburg, Chamberlain was shot through the right hip and groin, the bullet exiting his left hip. Despite the injury, Chamberlain withdrew his sword <b>and</b> <b>stuck</b> <b>it</b> into the ground {{in order to keep}} himself upright to dissuade the growing resolve for retreat. He stood upright for several minutes until he collapsed and lay unconscious from loss of blood. The wound was considered mortal by the division's surgeon, who predicted he would perish; Chamberlain's incorrectly recorded death in battle was reported in the Maine newspapers, and Lt. Gen. Ulysses S. Grant gave Chamberlain a battlefield promotion to the rank of brigadier general after receiving an urgent recommendation on June 19 from corps commander Maj. Gen. Gouverneur K. Warren: [...] "He has been recommended for promotion for gallant and efficient conduct on previous occasion and yesterday led his brigade against the enemy under most destructive fire. He expresses the wish that he may receive the recognition of his services by promotion before he dies for the gratification of his family and friends." [...] Not expected to live, Chamberlain displayed surprising will and courage, and with the support of his brother Tom, was back in command by November.
