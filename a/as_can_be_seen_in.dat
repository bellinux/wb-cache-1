The new features produced a closer juxtaposition of architectural components, visible as a more crowded decoration, <b>as</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>in</b> the Mallikarjuna Temple at Sudi in the Gadag district and the Amrtesvara Temple at Annigeri in the Dharwad district.|$|E

5|$|Neoclassicism or {{increasingly}} Nordic Classicism {{continued to}} thrive {{at the beginning}} of the century until about 1930 <b>as</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>in</b> Kay Fisker's Hornbækhus apartment buildings (1923) and Hack Kampmann's police headquarters (1924). Its development was no isolated phenomenon, drawing on existing classical traditions in the Nordic countries, and from new ideas being pursued in German-speaking cultures. It can thus be characterised as a combination of direct and indirect influences from vernacular architecture (Nordic, Italian and German) and Neoclassicism.|$|E
5|$|Rongorongo glyphs {{were written}} in reverse boustrophedon, left to right and bottom to top. That is, the reader begins at the bottom {{left-hand}} corner of a tablet, reads a line from left to right, then rotates the tablet 180 degrees to continue on the next line. When reading one line, the lines above and below it would appear upside down, <b>as</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>in</b> the image at left.|$|E
5|$|The {{forms of}} the glyphs are {{standardized}} contours of living organisms and geometric designs about one centimeter high. The wooden tablets are irregular in shape and, in many instances, fluted (tablets B, E, G, H, O, Q, and possibly T), with the glyphs carved in shallow channels running {{the length of the}} tablets, <b>as</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>in</b> the image of tablet G at right. It is thought that irregular and often blemished pieces of wood were used in their entirety rather than squared off due to the scarcity of wood on the island.|$|E

5|$|There {{is also a}} great {{difference}} between English and Scottish historiography on King Edward. G. W. S. Barrow, in his biography on Robert the Bruce, accused Edward of ruthlessly exploiting the leaderless state of Scotland to obtain a feudal superiority over the kingdom. This view of Edward is reflected in the popular perception of the King, <b>as</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>in</b> the 1995 movie Bravehearts portrayal of the King as a hard-hearted tyrant.|$|E
5|$|Although ecplised by Scots Baronial and Gothic forms, Neo-classicism {{continued}} to be a major style into the nineteenth century. William Henry Playfair (1790–1857) was the designer of many of Edinburgh's neoclassical landmarks in the New Town. Two of his finest works are the National Gallery of Scotland and the Royal Scottish Academy, which are situated in the centre of Edinburgh. However, the figure most associated with the classical style was Alexander 'Greek' Thomson (1817–75). Working mainly in Glasgow, he turned away from the Gothic style toward that of the ancient Greeks and Egyptians, <b>as</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>in</b> the temple and columns that were part of the Caledonia Road Church (1856).|$|E
5|$|For example, {{take the}} fictitious pair Irma Maes and Jef Jacobs {{as shown in}} the table. The first {{stimulus}} is A and U: the last letter of Irma's first name and a letter not in her name. The next stimulus is M and D: the penultimate letter from Irma's first name and a letter not part of her name. <b>As</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>in</b> the table this is repeated for the remaining letters of Irma's first name. The letters of her last name then also appear in reverse order, and finally the letters of both of Jef's names. The shading in the table reveals the pattern hidden to subjects, who would have been told to circle their preferred letter of each pair as fast as possible without thinking.|$|E

5|$|Of the {{generation}} of painters that followed Raeburn, David Watson (1767–1837) trained with Reynolds in London before returning home {{to become the first}} president of the Scottish Academy in 1826. The influence of both Reynolds and Raeburn can be seen in his work, including A Girl Drawing (1813) and the large group portrait The Children of the Earl of Elgin with their Nurse (c. 1805). He was followed as president of the academy by his nephew John Watson Gordon (1788–1864), who also studied with Raeburn. He painted portraits of leading cultural figures James Hogg and Lady Nairne as part of a series of portraits commissioned by William Blackwood. From the 1840s his work began to be influenced by early photography, with cool light and muted colours, <b>as</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>in</b> his full-length portrait of Principal Lee (1847).|$|E
5|$|Other artists {{influenced}} by modernism included James McIntosh Patrick (1907–98) and Edward Baird (1904–49). Both trained in Glasgow, but {{spent most of}} their careers in and around their respective native cities of Dundee and Montrose. Both were {{influenced by}} surrealism and the work of Bruegel. They focused on landscape, <b>as</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>in</b> McIntosh Patrick's Traquair House (1938) and more overtly Baird's The Birth of Venus (1934). Before his success in painting, McIntosh Patrick gained a reputation as an etcher. Leading figures in the field in the inter-war period included William Wilson (1905–72) and Ian Fleming (1906–94).|$|E

5|$|The Decorated Gothic style, with traceried windows, {{is further}} {{subdivided}} dependent upon whether the tracery is Geometric or Curvilinear. Many cathedrals have important {{parts in the}} Geometric style of the mid 13th to early 14th centuries, including much of Lincoln, Lichfield, the choir of Ely and the chapter houses of Salisbury and Southwell. By the late 13th century the style of tracery evolved to include {{a greater number of}} narrow shapes that adapted easily to Gothic openings in combination with circular shapes <b>as</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>in</b> the windows of the chapter house of York, the Octagon of Ely and the west window of Exeter.|$|E
5|$|The progressions in {{northern}} art developed almost simultaneously {{with the early}} Italian Renaissance. The philosophical and artistic traditions of the Mediterranean were not however part of the northern heritage, {{to the extent that}} many elements of Latin culture were actively disparaged in the north. The role of Renaissance humanism in art, for example, was less pronounced in the Low Countries than in Italy. Local religious trends had a strong influence on early northern art, <b>as</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>in</b> the subject matter, composition and form of many late 13th- and early 14th-century artworks. The northern painters' doctrine was also built on elements of recent Gothic tradition, and less on the classical tradition prevalent in Italy.|$|E
5|$|If {{forced to}} assault a castle, {{there were many}} options {{available}} to the attackers. For wooden structures, such as early motte-and-baileys, fire was a real threat and attempts would be made to set them alight <b>as</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>in</b> the Bayeux Tapestry. Projectile weapons had been used since antiquity and the mangonel and petraria– from Roman and Eastern origins respectively– were the main two that were used into the Middle Ages. The trebuchet, which probably evolved from the petraria in the 13thcentury, was the most effective siege weapon before the development of cannons. These weapons were vulnerable to fire from the castle as they had a short range and were large machines. Conversely, weapons such as trebuchets could be fired from within the castle due to the high trajectory of its projectile, and would be protected from direct fire by the curtain walls.|$|E

5|$|The Gothic style {{developed}} {{fully in}} the later nineteenth century. Important figures included Frederick Thomas Pilkington (1832–98), who adapted the Gothic style {{for the needs of}} the Free Church of Scotland, as at Barclay Viewforth Church, Edinburgh (1862–64). Robert Rowand Anderson (1834–1921), trained in the office of leading Gothic Architect George Gilbert Scott in London before returning to Edinburgh, where he worked on many small churches, including St James the Less in Leith, Christ Church, Falkirk (1862) and the Catholic Apostolic Church in Edinburgh (1876). He also supervised the renovation of Dunblane (1890–93) and Paisley Abbey (1898–1907). Alexander 'Greek' Thomson (1817–75), working mainly in Glasgow, began in the Gothic style, but soon turned toward the ancient Greeks and Egyptians for inspiration, <b>as</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>in</b> the temple and columns that were part of the Caledonia Road Church (1856). Scotland's most influential architect of the late nineteenth century and early twentieth century, Charles Rennie MacKintosh, designed a number of churches, but only one, Queen's Cross Free Church, Glasgow (1898–99) was built. It avoided the characteristic steeple of Glasgow churches in favour of a wide tower, and has a simple, elegant, rectangular structure with a single aisle.|$|E
5|$|Within Presbyterian Church heraldry, a minister's hat is {{represented}} as black {{with a single}} tassel on each side, sometimes blue, though a doctoral bonnet or Geneva cap may replace the brimmed hat. Clergy of the Chapel Royal display red tassels. The office of moderator does not have corporate arms, but for official occasions, a moderator may add tassels to his personal arms to indicate parity with offices of other churches: three for a moderator of a presbytery, and six for a moderator of a regional synod. The moderator of the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland now uses a differenced version of the General Assembly's arms, with a hat having a blue cord and ten tassels on each side, and may also show the moderator's staff, a gold Celtic crosier, behind the shield <b>as</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>in</b> vol 41, p 152 of the Scots Public Register.|$|E
5|$|Although a court roll of 1389 {{mentions}} two gardens, {{there is}} no record of where these were sited, nor is there any record of when the terraces were constructed. The basic layout as known today was certainly in place by about 1730, <b>as</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>in</b> a portrait of the house from that period. Later in the 18th century, the space behind the great pilastered wall was infilled to make the top terrace, which has wide views across the valley to the Mendip Hills beyond. The Octagon, a garden pavilion, was built about the same time, as was the more rustic summer house which faces it down the long grassy walk of the Pretty Terrace. Further modifications involved facing the lower retaining wall with rosy pink bricks, which were also used to build a double flight of steps below the Octagon. The garden is still largely in its 18th-century form, though small ponds and fountains were added in the 19th century and the once open hillside behind is now thickly wooded. A single rose arbour remained from the Edwardian garden but {{was on the verge of}} collapse when it was replaced with a new one in 2009, marking 300 years of the Elton family's presence at Clevedon Court.|$|E
