50|$|By 1950, <b>Saudi</b> <b>Arabia</b> {{had become}} a very {{successful}} producing area, with an even greater undeveloped oil production potential. Because of favorable geological conditions and the close proximity of oil fields to the coast, <b>Saudi</b> <b>Arabia</b> operations were low cost. American companies therefore heavily valued the oil. The joint concessionary company, ARAMCO, agreed to the governmentâ€™s demand to use the introduced posted price {{as a way to}} calculate profits.

50|$|In {{the first}} year of the nationalization, the only foreign sale of Iranian Oil were 300 barrels to an Italian {{merchant}} ship. Foreign oil companies prevented any impacts of the Iranian withdrawal from being felt by consumer countries by increasing output elsewhere. Oil production was expanded by BP and <b>ARAMCO</b> in <b>Saudi</b> <b>Arabia,</b> Kuwait and Iraq. Oil production in the Middle East increased by around 10% annually in 1951, 1952 and 1953.

In a government monopoly, an agency under the direct authority of the government itself holds the monopoly, and the coercive monopoly status is sustained by the enforcement of laws or regulations that ban competition, or reserve exclusive control over factors of production for the government. The state-owned petroleum companies that are common in oil-rich developing countries (such as <b>Aramco</b> in <b>Saudi</b> <b>Arabia</b> or PDVSA in Venezuela) are {{examples of}} government monopolies created through nationalization of resources and existing firms; the United States Postal Service {{is an example of a}} coercive monopoly created through laws that ban potential competitors such as UPS or FedEx from offering competing services (in this case, first-class and standard (formerly called [...] "third-class") mail delivery).1 ...|$|R
5000|$|Emigration from Pakistan was {{relatively}} small between 1947 and 1970. The rapid industrialization process of Pakistan during the 1950s and 1960s {{coupled with the}} introduction of modern agricultural practices pushed out surplus labor leading to mass rural to urban migration, primarily to Karachi. During this time period, the majority of Pakistanis who went abroad considered themselves to be [...] "sojourners", who left to earn money abroad but not to settle, or were students who intended to return to Pakistan when their degree programs were completed. By 1971, no more than 900,000 Pakistanis lived abroad with the majority residing in the United Kingdom and <b>Saudi</b> <b>Arabia.</b> In 1959, small numbers of Pakistanis were found to be working in Bahrain, Kuwait and elsewhere in the Persian Gulf. By 1960, the Pakistani community in Bahrain numbered 2200 while almost half of the population in Kuwait comprised non-nationals, and of them a small number came from Pakistan. Pakistan was already the single most important source of non-Arab expatriate labor in the Kuwait Oil Company (representing about 19% of the workforce) and trailed only Americans among those working for <b>Saudi</b> <b>Aramco</b> in <b>Saudi</b> <b>Arabia,</b> who represented 6% of the workforce.|$|R

In 1976, it was awarded a $5 billion project for <b>ARAMCO</b> in <b>Saudi</b> <b>Arabia,</b> to design facilities that capture sour gas, which is expelled from oil wells as waste, in order to refine it into fuel. That same year a partially completed copper and cobalt mine in Africa was cancelled due to a war in the neighboring region of Angola and declining copper prices.

40|$|Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) strains {{have spread}} in <b>Saudi</b> <b>Arabia,</b> {{increasing}} morbidity, mortality, and financial burdens. Recent {{studies have suggested}} the phenotyping methods typically used to classify MRSA as either health care MRSA (HA-MRSA) or community-associated MRSA (CA-MRSA) cases are unreliable, because they lack concordance {{with the results of}} genotyping. Yet the expense associated with genotyping precludes its use in the <b>Saudi</b> <b>Aramco</b> population in <b>Saudi</b> <b>Arabia.</b> The absence of a standardized and affordable method to classify MRSA into CA-MRSA and HA-MRSA has been a challenge for infection control programs in <b>Saudi</b> <b>Arabia.</b> The objective of this quantitative, secondary data analysis was to determine the most reliable phenotyping approach to strain identification using John Hopkins Aramco hospital data. The ecological and antibiotics selection pressure theories framed this research. The results of concordance, and sensitivity and specificity tests, suggested hospital admission profiles and susceptibility pattern were the most reliable phenotypic predictors of genotype-based classifications. Multiple logistic regression for susceptibility pattern (OR = 15. 47, p 3 Ì†c. 001) and hospital admission profile (OR = 2. 87, p =. 008) confirmed those results, whereas all other variables were not found to be statistically significant. These results can be used to clarify the epidemiological and molecular factors that affect the transition of MRSA from health care facilities to the <b>Saudi</b> <b>Aramco</b> community. Implications for positive social change include faster and more reliable classification of MRSA to aid in disease surveillance and the selection of appropriate treatments to reduce MRSA-related morbidity and mortality...|$|R

50|$|Cave Brown's {{first major}} work to attract {{widespread}} attention was Bodyguard of Lies (1975), which examined the strategical elements of World War II, including codebreaking {{and its effect}} on the war's outcome. He followed up on this theme with a book, The Last Hero: Wild Bill Donovan, about William J. Donovan, the director of the American Office of Strategic Services during World War II; the Office of Strategic Services later evolved into the Central Intelligence Agency. Another espionage-related effort was a 1987 biography of Sir Stewart Menzies, who served as head of British MI6 (Secret Intelligence Service) during World War II. The book was titled C: The Secret Life of Sir Stewart Graham Menzies, Spymaster to Winston Churchill. His book Treason in the Blood: H. St. John Philby, Kim Philby, and the Spy Case of the Century, published in 1994, examined the interconnected lives of the famous British spies Kim Philby and Harry St. John Philby, son and father.
