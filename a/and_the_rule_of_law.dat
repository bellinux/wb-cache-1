5|$|The League and {{the ideas}} of {{collective}} security <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>rule</b> <b>of</b> <b>law</b> were defeated; partly because of indifference and of sympathy with the aggressor, but partly because the League powers were unprepared, preoccupied with other matters, and too slow to perceive the scale of Japanese ambitions.|$|E
5|$|Germany is a federal, parliamentary, {{representative}} democratic republic. The German {{political system}} operates under a framework {{laid out in}} the 1949 constitutional document known as the Grundgesetz (Basic Law). Amendments generally require a two-thirds majority of both chambers of parliament; the fundamental principles of the constitution, as expressed in the articles guaranteeing human dignity, the separation of powers, the federal structure, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>rule</b> <b>of</b> <b>law</b> are valid in perpetuity.|$|E

5|$|Government in Ratanakiri is weak, {{largely due}} to the province's remoteness, ethnic diversity, and recent history of Khmer Rouge dominance. The provincial legal {{framework}} is poor, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>rule</b> <b>of</b> <b>law</b> is even weaker in Ratanakiri than elsewhere in Cambodia. Furthermore, government services are ineffective and insufficient {{to meet the needs of}} the province. The Cambodian government has traditionally accepted substantial support from NGOs in the region.|$|E
5|$|According to {{a decree}} from 1972, the Ministry of Justice {{prepared}} proposals for the codification of law; it carried out methodological management of legal {{work in the}} national economy. The Ministry directed and coordinated the work of state bodies and public organisations to promote legal knowledge and to clarify the law among the population about the judicial agencies, as well as general management of the civil registry, state, and legal profession. The Ministry was liable to the Party, the state, and the people. The Ministry's main goal was to strengthen socialist legality <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>rule</b> <b>of</b> <b>law</b> within Soviet judicial institutions.|$|E
5|$|Michael Shermer {{argued in}} Scientific American in October 2006 that {{evolution}} supports concepts like family values, avoiding lies, fidelity, moral codes <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>rule</b> <b>of</b> <b>law.</b> He {{goes on to}} suggest that evolution gives more support {{to the notion of}} an omnipotent creator, rather than a tinkerer with limitations based on a human model, the more common image subscribed to by creationists. Careful analysis of the creationist charges that evolution has led to moral relativism and the Holocaust yields the conclusion that these charges appear to be highly suspect. Such analyses conclude that the origins of the Holocaust {{are more likely to be}} found in historical Christian anti-Semitism than in evolution.|$|E

5|$|Chng Suan Tze v. Minister for Home Affairs is {{a seminal}} case in {{administrative}} law {{decided by the}} Court of Appeal of Singapore in 1988. The Court decided the appeal in the appellants' favour on a technical ground, but considered obiter dicta the reviewability of government power in preventive detention cases under the Internal Security Act ("ISA"). The case approved the application by the court of an objective test in the review of government discretion under the ISA, stating that all power has legal limits <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>rule</b> <b>of</b> <b>law</b> demands that the courts {{should be able to}} examine the exercise of discretionary power. This was a landmark shift from the position in the 1971 High Court decision Lee Mau Seng v. Minister of Home Affairs, which had been an authority for the application of a subjective test until it was overruled by Chng Suan Tze.|$|E
