5|$|Efforts are {{underway}} {{to determine how}} the extra chromosome 21 material causes Down syndrome, as currently this is unknown, and to develop treatments to improve intelligence in those with the syndrome. One hope is to use stem cells. Other methods being studied include the use of antioxidants, gamma secretase inhibition, <b>adrenergic</b> agonists, and memantine. Research is often carried out on an animal model, the Ts65Dn mouse.|$|E
5|$|Phosphorylation: cTnI was {{the first}} sarcomeric protein {{identified}} to be a substrate of PKA. Phosphorylation of cTnI at Ser23/Ser24 under <b>adrenergic</b> stimulation enhances relaxation of cardiac muscle, which is critical to cardiac function especially at fast heart rate. Whereas PKA phosphorylation of Ser23/Ser24 decreases myofilament Ca2+ sensitivity and increases relaxation, phosphorylation of Ser42/Ser44 by PKC increases Ca2+ sensitivity and decreases cardiac muscle relaxation. Ser5/Ser6, Tyr26, Thr31, Ser39, Thr51, Ser77, Thr78, Thr129, Thr143 and Ser150 are also phosphorylation sites in human cTnI.|$|E
5|$|Bupropion is {{also known}} {{to act as a}} non-competitive {{antagonist}} of the α3β2, α3β4, α4β2, and, very weakly, α7 nACh receptors, and these actions appear to be importantly involved in its beneficial properties not only in smoking cessation, but in depression as well. The metabolites of bupropion also act as non-competitive antagonists of these nACh receptors, and hydroxybupropion is even more potent in comparison. At therapeutically-relevant concentrations bupropion and hydroxybupropion act as negative allosteric modulators of the serotonin 5-HT3A receptor. Pharmacological data on bupropion and its metabolites are shown in the table. Bupropion is known to weakly inhibit the α1 <b>adrenergic</b> receptor, with a 14% potency of its dopamine uptake inhibition, and the H1 receptor, with a 9% potency.|$|E
5|$|Irreversible antagonists covalently bind to the {{receptor}} target and, in general, {{cannot be}} removed; inactivating the receptor {{for the duration}} of the antagonist effects is determined by the rate of receptor turnover, the rate of synthesis of new receptors. Phenoxybenzamine is an example of an irreversible alpha blocker—it permanently binds to α <b>adrenergic</b> receptors, preventing adrenaline and noradrenaline from binding. Inactivation of receptors normally results in a depression of the maximal response of agonist dose-response curves and a right shift in the curve occurs where there is a receptor reserve similar to non-competitive antagonists. A washout step in the assay will usually distinguish between non-competitive and irreversible antagonist drugs, as effects of non-competitive antagonists are reversible and activity of agonist will be restored.|$|E
5|$|Its effects, {{depending}} on dosage, include {{an increase in}} sodium excretion by the kidneys, an increase in urine output, an increase in heart rate, {{and an increase in}} blood pressure. At low doses it acts through the sympathetic nervous system to increase heart muscle contraction force and heart rate, thereby increasing cardiac output and blood pressure. Higher doses also cause vasoconstriction that further increases blood pressure. Older literature also describes very low doses thought to improve kidney function without other consequences, but recent reviews have concluded that doses at such low levels are not effective and may sometimes be harmful. While some effects result from stimulation of dopamine receptors, the prominent cardiovascular effects result from dopamine acting at α1, β1, and β2 <b>adrenergic</b> receptors.|$|E
25|$|Epinephrine: {{imipramine}} antagonizes <b>adrenergic</b> receptors, thus sometimes causing orthostatic hypotension.|$|E
25|$|Alpha α2 <b>adrenergic</b> receptors: Perhaps greater positive, negative, {{affective and}} {{cognitive}} symptom control.|$|E
25|$|There are {{two main}} groups of <b>adrenergic</b> receptors, α and β, with several subtypes.|$|E
25|$|Sympathetic {{nervous system}} activity, which also {{controls}} blood pressure, acting through the beta1 <b>adrenergic</b> receptors.|$|E
25|$|Epinephrine acts by binding to {{a variety}} of <b>adrenergic</b> receptors. Epinephrine is a nonselective agonist of all <b>adrenergic</b> receptors, {{including}} the major subtypes α1, α2, β1, β2, and β3. Epinephrine's binding to these receptors triggers a number of metabolic changes. Binding to α-adrenergic receptors inhibits insulin secretion by the pancreas, stimulates glycogenolysis in the liver and muscle, and stimulates glycolysis and inhibits insulin-mediated glycogenesis in muscle. β <b>adrenergic</b> receptor binding triggers glucagon secretion in the pancreas, increased adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) secretion by the pituitary gland, and increased lipolysis by adipose tissue. Together, these effects lead to increased blood glucose and fatty acids, providing substrates for energy production within cells throughout the body.|$|E
25|$|Endogenous {{sulfur dioxide}} also diminishes {{myocardial}} damage, caused by isoproterenol <b>adrenergic</b> hyperstimulation, and strengthens the myocardial antioxidant defense reserve.|$|E
25|$|Alpha α1 <b>adrenergic</b> receptors: This action {{accounts}} for its orthostatic hypotensive effects {{and perhaps some}} of the sedating effects of risperidone.|$|E
25|$|Males {{typically}} have less body fat than females. Recent results indicate androgens inhibit {{the ability of}} some fat cells to store lipids by blocking a signal transduction pathway that normally supports adipocyte function. Also, androgens, but not estrogens, increase beta <b>adrenergic</b> receptors while decreasing alpha <b>adrenergic</b> receptors- which results in increased levels of epinephrine/ norepinephrine {{due to lack of}} alpha-2 receptor negative feedback and decreased fat accumulation due to epinephrine/ norepinephrine then acting on lipolysis-inducing beta receptors.|$|E
25|$|Racemic {{epinephrine}} {{has historically}} been used {{for the treatment of}} croup. Regular epinephrine however works equally well. Racemic adrenaline is a 1:1 mixture of the dextrorotatory (D) and levorotatory (L) isomers of adrenaline. The L-form is the active component. Racemic adrenaline works by stimulation of the alpha <b>adrenergic</b> receptors in the airway, with resultant mucosal vasoconstriction and decreased subglottic edema, and by stimulation of the β <b>adrenergic</b> receptors, with resultant relaxation of the bronchial smooth muscle.|$|E
25|$|The <b>adrenergic</b> receptors (or adrenoceptors) are a {{class of}} G protein-coupled receptors that are targets of the catecholamines, {{especially}} norepinephrine (noradrenaline) and epinephrine (adrenaline).|$|E
25|$|Pharmacological {{doses of}} {{epinephrine}} stimulate α1, α2, β1, β2, and β3 adrenoceptors of the sympathetic nervous system. Sympathetic nerve receptors {{are classified as}} <b>adrenergic,</b> based on their responsiveness to adrenaline.|$|E
25|$|Benign {{familial}} tremor (BFT) is {{responsive to}} peripheral β <b>adrenergic</b> blockers and β2-stimulation is known to cause tremor. Patients with BFT {{were found to have}} increased plasma epinephrine, but not norepinephrine.|$|E
25|$|Sympatholytic drugs (drugs {{blocking}} {{the effects of}} the sympathetic nervous system): examples included bretylium and <b>adrenergic</b> beta-receptors blocking drugs. This is similar to the modern classification, which focuses on the latter category.|$|E
25|$|Among American health {{professionals}} and scientists, the term epinephrine is used over adrenaline. However, pharmaceuticals that mimic {{the effects of}} epinephrine are often called adrenergics, and receptors for epinephrine are called <b>adrenergic</b> receptors or adrenoceptors.|$|E
25|$|Its {{mechanism}} of action {{in the treatment of}} ADHD is to increase noradrenergic tone in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) directly by binding to postsynaptic α2A <b>adrenergic</b> receptors and indirectly by increasing norepinephrine input from the locus coeruleus.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to blockade of <b>adrenergic</b> receptors, propranolol has very weak inhibitory {{effects on the}} norepinephrine transporter and/or weakly stimulates norepinephrine release (i.e., the concentration of norepinephrine is increased in the synapse). Since propranolol blocks β-adrenoceptors, the increase in synaptic norepinephrine only results in α-adrenoceptor activation, with the α1-adrenoceptor being particularly important for effects observed in animal models. Therefore, it can be looked upon as a weak indirect α1-adrenoceptor agonist in {{addition to}} potent β-adrenoceptor antagonist. In addition to its effects on the <b>adrenergic</b> system, {{there is evidence that}} indicates that propranolol may act as a weak antagonist of certain serotonin receptors, namely the 5-HT1A, 5-HT1B, and 5-HT2B receptors. The latter may be involved in the effectiveness of propranolol in the treatment of migraine at high doses.|$|E
25|$|At doses used {{to treat}} depression, doxepin appears to inhibit the reuptake of {{serotonin}} and norepinephrine and to have antihistamine, <b>adrenergic</b> and serotonin receptor antagonistic, and anticholinergic activities; at low doses {{used to treat}} insomnia {{it appears to be}} selective for the histamine H1 receptor.|$|E
25|$|As a hormone, {{epinephrine}} acts {{on nearly}} all body tissues. Its actions vary by tissue type and tissue expression of <b>adrenergic</b> receptors. For example, {{high levels of}} epinephrine causes smooth muscle relaxation in the airways but causes contraction of the smooth muscle that lines most arterioles.|$|E
25|$|In binding {{experiments}} with central <b>adrenergic</b> receptors, using a preparation from rat cerebral cortex, l-synephrine had pIC50 = 3.35, and d-synephrine had pIC50 = 2.42 in competition against -prazosin (standard α1 ligand); against -yohimbine (standard α2 ligand), l-synephrine showed a pIC50 = 5.01, and d-synephrine showed a pIC50 = 4.17.|$|E
25|$|The binding of racemic synephrine to cloned human <b>adrenergic</b> receptors {{has been}} examined: Ma and {{co-workers}} found that synephrine bound to α1A, α2A and α2C with low affinity (pKi = 4.11 for α1A; 4.44 for α2A; 4.61 for α2C). Synephrine behaved as a partial agonist at α1A receptors, {{but as an}} antagonist at α2A and α2C sub-types.|$|E
25|$|Common {{side effects}} include shakiness, headache, fast heart rate, dizziness, and feeling anxious. Serious side effects may include {{worsening}} bronchospasm, irregular heartbeat, and low blood potassium levels. It {{can be used}} during pregnancy and breastfeeding, but safety is not entirely clear. It is a short-acting β2 <b>adrenergic</b> receptor agonist which works by causing airway smooth muscles to relax.|$|E
25|$|In {{response}} to rising or falling levels of glucose, {{cells in the}} hypothalamus polarize or depolarize. Among the neuroendocrine reactions of {{the central nervous system}} to hypoglycemia is activation of the <b>adrenergic</b> responses of the autonomic nervous system. Glucokinase likely serves as a glucose signal here as well. Glucokinase has also been found in cells of the anterior pituitary.|$|E
25|$|An α2A <b>adrenergic</b> {{receptor}} agonist {{has also been}} approved in the US. Clonidine was initially developed {{as a treatment for}} high blood pressure. Low doses in evenings and/or afternoons are sometimes used in conjunction with stimulants to help with sleep and because clonidine sometimes helps moderate impulsive and oppositional behavior and may reduce tics. It may be more useful for comorbid Tourette syndrome.|$|E
25|$|Sertraline {{does not}} have {{significant}} affinity for the norepinephrine transporter (NET) or the serotonin, dopamine, <b>adrenergic,</b> histamine, or acetylcholine receptors. On the other hand, it does show high affinity for the dopamine transporter (DAT) and the sigma σ1 receptor (but not the σ2 receptor). However, its affinities for these sites are around 100-fold or more lower than for the SERT.|$|E
25|$|The drug {{acts as an}} {{antagonist}} {{of certain}} <b>adrenergic</b> and serotonin receptors, and is also a strong antihistamine. It is sometimes described as a noradrenergic and specific serotonergic antidepressant (NaSSA), although the actual {{evidence in support of}} this label has been regarded as poor. Chemically, mirtazapine is a tetracyclic antidepressant (TeCA), with four interconnected rings of atoms, and is a relative of the TeCA mianserin (Tolvon).|$|E
25|$|Due to its {{action on}} both the serotoninergic and <b>adrenergic</b> systems, {{venlafaxine}} is also used as a treatment to reduce episodes of cataplexy, a form of muscle weakness, in patients with the sleep disorder narcolepsy. Some open-label and three double-blind studies have suggested the efficacy of venlafaxine {{in the treatment of}} attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Clinical trials have found possible efficacy in those with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).|$|E
25|$|In general, {{increased}} levels of the thyroid hormones (thyroxine(T4) and triiodothyronine (T3)), increase the heart rate; excessive levels can trigger tachycardia. The impact of thyroid hormones is typically of a much longer duration {{than that of the}} catecholamines. The physiologically active form of triiodothyronine, has been shown to directly enter cardiomyocytes and alter activity {{at the level of the}} genome. It also impacts the beta <b>adrenergic</b> response similar to epinephrine and norepinephrine.|$|E
25|$|The {{progress}} in β-blocker development {{led to the}} introduction of drugs with variety of properties. β-blockers were developed having a relative selectivity for cardiac β1-receptors (for example metoprolol and atenolol), partial <b>adrenergic</b> agonist activity (pindolol), concomitant α-adrenergic blocking activity (for example labetalol and carvedilol) and additional direct vasodilator activity (nebivolol). In addition, long-acting and ultra-short formulations of β-blockers were developed. In 1988, Sir James Black was awarded the Nobel Prize in Medicine for his work on drug development.|$|E
25|$|Alarm pheromone-induced {{anxiety in}} rats {{has been used}} to {{evaluate}} the degree to which anxiolytics can alleviate anxiety in humans. For this the change in the acoustic startle reflex of rats with alarm pheromone-induced anxiety (i.e. reduction of defensiveness) has been measured. Pretreatment of rats with one of five anxiolytics used in clinical medicine was able to reduce their anxiety: namely midazolam, phenelzine (a nonselective monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitor), propranolol, a nonselective beta blocker, clonidine, an alpha 2 <b>adrenergic</b> agonist or CP-154,526, a corticotropin-releasing hormone antagonist.|$|E
25|$|The catecholamines, {{epinephrine}} and norepinephrine, secreted by the {{adrenal medulla}} form {{one component of}} the extended fight-or-flight mechanism. The other component is sympathetic stimulation. Epinephrine and norepinephrine have similar effects: binding to the beta-1 <b>adrenergic</b> receptors, and opening sodium and calcium ion chemical- or ligand-gated channels. The rate of depolarization is increased by this additional influx of positively charged ions, so the threshold is reached more quickly and the period of repolarization is shortened. However, massive releases of these hormones coupled with sympathetic stimulation may actually lead to arrhythmias. There is no parasympathetic stimulation to the adrenal medulla.|$|E
25|$|Exercise {{can cause}} a release of {{potassium}} into bloodstream by {{increasing the number of}} potassium channels in the cell membrane. The degree of potassium elevation varies with the degree of exercise, which range from 0.3 meq/L in light exercise to 2 meq/L in heavy exercise, with or without accompanying ECG changes or lactic acidosis. However, peak potassium levels can be reduced by prior physical conditioning and potassium levels are usually reversed several minutes after exercise. High levels of adrenaline and noradrenaline have a protective effect on the cardiac electrophysiology because they bind to beta 2 <b>adrenergic</b> receptors, which, when activated, extracellularly decrease potassium concentration.|$|E
