40|$|Some Micropaleontological data {{indicating}} {{the presence of}} (lower and upper) Badenian at Cluj-Napoca (Romania). In {{the central part of}} the city of Cluj-Napoca some excavations (in Cetăt̡uia Hill), drillings and waste-water collecting galery (at <b>Abator</b> Place) intercepted the Badenian deposits. The age of deposits from Cetăt̡uia Hill is lower Badenian. The analysis of the micropaleontological samples collected from the Badenian deposits (from <b>Abator</b> Place - drillings and waste - water collecting galery), revealed the presence of foraminifers and pteropods, of the lithostratigraphic unit “Spirialis marls”, indicating for the first time, at Cluj-Napoca, the presence of the upper Badenian. ...|$|E

These deposits have been analyzed for their foraminifera, calcareous nannofossils and pteropods content. The marly-clayey deposits of the Upper Badenian (Kossovian), respectively the ”Spirialis Marls ” (which belong to the upper part of the Mireş Subgroup, or to the Pietroasa Formation), have been intercepted at a depth of about 5 m, and they are about 3 m thick. The foraminiferal assemblages belong to Velapertina Biozone and the calcareous nannofossils’ assemblages belong to Discoaster exilis Biozone (NN 6). Pteropods belonging to Limacina genera are also present...|$|E
40|$|The {{physics of}} high {{pressure}} shocks plays {{a central role}} in Inertial Confinement Fusion (ICF). In indirect drive ICF, x-rays from a gold cavity (hohlraum) are used to ablatively drive a series of high pressure shocks into a spherical target (capsule). These shocks converge at the center, compressing the fuel and forming a hot dense core. The target performance, such as peak fuel density and temperature and neutron yield, depends critically on hock timing, and material compressibility. Accurate predictions of NIF target performance depends critically on shock timing and material compressibility. Current measurement techniques enable us to accurately determine shock timing in planar samples of <b>abator</b> material as a function of laser drive. Although this technique does not separately address uncertainties in material EOS and opacity, it does allow us to tune the laser drive until the desired shock timing is achieved. Experiments to directly address the EOS of D{sub 2 } ice are planned to further increase the margin for ignition in current target designs...|$|E
