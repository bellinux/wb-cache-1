50|$|As contest {{competition}} {{allows the}} monopolization of resources, offspring will typically always be produced and survive until adulthood {{independent of the}} population size. This results in stable population dynamics, {{in stark contrast to}} scramble competition which can result in periodic or chaotic population dynamics. The Beverton-Holt model is often used to represent population dynamics arising from contest competition. This model, and a few other well-known population models, can be explicitly derived from individual-level processes assuming contest competition and a random distribution of individuals <b>among</b> <b>resources.</b>|$|E
40|$|Abstract—Cloud {{computing}} {{has become}} a popular topic in many areas. It can publish various resources offered {{by a number of}} vendors as services. However, there is no valid technology to manage the resources or services. In this paper, the relations <b>among</b> the <b>resources</b> are classified into four classes: the relations <b>among</b> the <b>resources</b> having the same character, the relations among the variable part and invariable part of a service, the relations <b>among</b> the <b>resources</b> having the same interaction manner, and the relations <b>among</b> the <b>resources</b> that are incompatible but have to interoperate. Then four patterns are proposed to manage the resources in cloud. The motivation, condition, structure, generation and consequence are presented for each pattern. They can be used to improve the availability, scalability and reusability of the resources provided. Index Terms—Automatic resource management, Desig...|$|R

50|$|The Ricker Model, is used {{to model}} {{scramble}} competition. It was originally formulated to study the growth of salmon populations and is given by the equation Pn+1 = R(Pn) = Pner(1-Pn/k), where Pn is the population at the nth time period, r is the Malthusian growth rate, and k is the carrying capacity of the population. The Ricker model, {{and a few other}} well-known population models, can be explicitly derived from individual-level processes assuming scramble competition and a random distribution of individuals <b>among</b> <b>resources.</b>|$|E
50|$|Competition {{between members}} of a species ("intraspecific") for {{resources}} such as food, water, territory, and sunlight may result {{in an increase in}} the frequency of a variant of the species best suited for survival and reproduction until its fixation within a population. However, competition <b>among</b> <b>resources</b> also has a strong tendency for diversification {{between members of}} the same species, resulting in coexistence of competitive and non-competitive strategies or cycles between low and high competitiveness. Third parties within a species often favour highly competitive strategies leading to species extinction when environmental conditions are harsh (evolutionary suicide).|$|E

40|$|The {{design of}} {{efficient}} public policies that aim {{to improve the}} provision of ecosystem services faces the problem that many ecosystem services are only apparent at spatial levels beyond {{the level at which}} they are managed. This makes it impossible to measure the contribution of individual resource managers to the provision of these services, {{as is the case in}} landscapes managed by private landowners such as farmers. As a consequence, the magnitude of the public support associated with the implementation of a policy cannot be specified down to the level of the individual manager/land owner. In this situation, institutional arrangements <b>among</b> <b>resource</b> managers are needed to determine how the public support defined at the higher level can be fairly distributed. This paper proposes a financial compensation arrangement <b>among</b> <b>resource</b> managers in a landscape, based on the Kaldor–Hicks criterion leading to a Pareto-optimal improvement, and explores the institutional requirements for the effective implementation of this arrangement. The proposed arrangement is illustrated with a case study in a woodland landscape in The Netherlands. The results show that private benefits among farms differed considerably due to biophysical, ecological and geographic differences among the farms. The financial compensation arrangement could contribute to improved equity <b>among</b> natural <b>resource</b> managers, which has been proposed as a key requirement for implementation of effective governance of environmental changes. The discussion addresses the institutional requirements of the proposed arrangement for governance structures that effectively deal with biophysical and socio-economic scale mismatches in sustainable use of natural resource...|$|R
