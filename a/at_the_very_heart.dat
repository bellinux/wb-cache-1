Thus it is considered the most important set of throne halls in the entire Grand Palace. All of the buildings within the Maha Monthien face north and are arranged from front to back with the public reception hall being at the front, ceremonial halls in the middle and residential halls at the back, all of them inter-connected to each other.|$|E

He asked Norman Bradford (who was engaged as an engineer constructing the camp) to take on the duty of entertaining the guests which he did with a series of ice breakers and jokes. By {{the end of the night}} the camp was buzzing and the Butlin's atmosphere was born. From that point on, entertainment was <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>very</b> <b>heart</b> of Butlin's and Bradford became the first of the Butlin's Redcoats. That night Butlin decided that for his camp to work he would require an army of people to carry out the same job as Bradford, and the role of Redcoat was formed.|$|E

This Greek civic world could never be fully recovered, although it could be integrated into something more developed. The recovery of an integrated community, which embodies all the key components of individual autonomy (introduced initially in the Christian perspective), is the central aim of Green and Hegel. … The Reformation introduced a new positive form of autonomous consciousness, present in the liberal Protestant citizen, which is, in fact, <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>very</b> metaphysical <b>heart</b> of both liberalism and the Christian perspective.” Boucher and Vincent 2000, 35.|$|R

The sheet was large; but the words were placarded upon it in heavy though rapid lines, only six or eight to the page. And as the footman of a haughty visitor--some Count or Duke--announces the chariot of his lord by a thunderous knock on the portal; so to Glen did Pierre, in the broad, sweeping, and prodigious superscription of his letter, forewarn him what manner of man was on the road.|$|R
25|$|The first {{matters to}} {{establish}} were the design principles and layout. Since {{this was to}} be the first non-denominational chapel for a European garden cemetery, there were no existing guidelines. What should it look like? Where would it be most appropriately located within the park? How should it be aligned in the landscape? And which direction should it face? William Hosking, in discussion with George Collison II developed a plan to site the novel chapel <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>very</b> <b>heart</b> of Abney Park foregoing any positioning close to the main entrance. The aim was that, once the pine trees that were planted along the Chapel Ride matured, the chapel would gradually be revealed through a sylvan landscape approach drive. The sinuously designed Chapel Ride was therefore lined with Bhutan Pine trees on its south side, contributing an attractive odoriferous all-year effect. Not only could nature be appreciated, but the main entrance (with its Egyptian revival building style) would not be eclipsed.|$|E

[...] Steiner told Rosenbaum that [...] "in the German language, Hitler drew on a kind of rhetorical power which, {{in a way that is}} perhaps a little bit peculiar to German, allies highly abstract concepts with political, physical violence in a most unusual way". Hitler's genius lay [...] "not so much in the written word, but the embodied voice", which Steiner described as [...] "mesmeric". Rosenbaum notes that Steiner describes Hitler as [...] "a kind of medium for the evil genius of the German language itself" [...] and that his language is [...] "like 'antimatter' to ordinary language".|$|E

A son of Italian immigrants, a tailor and World War II veteran, he ran on a reform platform, {{defeating}} the incumbent, Leo Carlin, whom, ironically, Addonizio characterized as corrupt {{and a part}} of the political machine of the era. In December 1969, Addonizio and nine present or former officials of the municipal administration in Newark were indicted by a Federal grand jury; five other persons were also indicted. In July 1970, the former mayor, and four other defendants, were found guilty by a Federal jury on 64 counts each, one of conspiracy and 63 of extortion. In September 1970, Addonizio was sentenced to ten years in federal prison and fined $25,000 by Federal Judge George Herbert Barlow for his role in a plot that involved the extortion of $1.5 million in kickbacks, a crime that the judge said [...] "tore <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>very</b> <b>heart</b> of our civilized society and our form of representative government".|$|E

He was roundly taken to task by a public-spirited reporter, and babbled meaningless excuses; he did not know, he said, that the force now falling in on us at Yolo was so large.

500|$|With time, Johnson's home {{became a}} nexus for radical thinkers, who {{appreciated}} his open-mindedness, generous spirit, and humanitarianism. Although usually separated by geography, such thinkers would meet and debate {{with one another}} at Johnson's house in London, often over dinner. This network not only brought authors into contact with each other, it also brought new writers to Johnson's business. For example, Priestley introduced John Newton to Johnson, Newton brought John Hewlett, and Hewlett invited Mary Wollstonecraft, who in turn attracted Mary Hays who brought William Godwin. With this broad network of acquaintances and reputation for free-thinking publications, Johnson became the favourite publisher of a generation of writers and thinkers. By bringing inventive, thoughtful people together, he [...] "stood <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>very</b> <b>heart</b> of British intellectual life" [...] for over twenty years. Importantly, Johnson's circle was not made up entirely of either liberals or radicals. Chard emphasizes that it [...] "was held together less by political liberalism than by a common interest in ideas, free enquiry, and creative expression in various fields".|$|E
500|$|The Shakti {{panel in}} the east shrine is unusual in that {{counting}} Parvati, it features eight mothers (Asta matrikas) {{in an era when}} Sapta matrikas were more common such as at Samalaji and Jogeswari caves. Additionally, the mothers are flanked on one side with Ganesha and the other with Skanda (Kartikeya) when typical artwork from mid 1st millennium show the Shakta mothers with Ganesha and Shiva. According to Sara L. Schastok, the Skanda in the east shrine of Elephanta Cave 1 is significant, just like the one found in Deogarh Hindu temple site, because he is depicted with regalia, weapons and icons similar to Shiva and because he is surrounded by gods and goddeses. By portraying Skanda with Matrikas, he is equated with the Krittikas legend and thereby Kartikeya, and by showing him so prominently centered the artists are likely communicating the unity of Skanda-Shiva, that all these divinities are in essence the same spiritual concept, [...] "all emanations of the lingam <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>very</b> <b>heart</b> of Elephanta", according to Schastok.|$|E

The completed murals uplifted {{the spirits of the}} POWs and sick when they sought refuge in the Chapel.

In May 1944, Block 151 with the St Luke Chapel's inspiring murals was designated to become a store for an airfield nearby. The lower portion of St Luke in Prison mural was almost completely destroyed when it was demolished to make a link to an adjoining room. The walls of the Chapel were distempered over, hiding the murals from view. Stanley was later sent to Kranji in the north of Singapore, not far from the Causeway to Malaya, and remained there until the Japanese surrender on 15 August 1945. After the war, Stanley returned to England believing that his murals had been destroyed by Allied bombing {{towards the end of the}} war.

500|$|The Rashtrakuta kings {{supported}} the popular religions {{of the day}} in the traditional spirit of religious tolerance. Scholars have offered various arguments regarding which specific religion the Rashtrakutas favoured, basing their evidence on inscriptions, coins and contemporary literature. Some claim the Rashtrakutas were inclined towards Jainism since many of the scholars who flourished in their courts and wrote in Sanskrit, Kannada and a few in Apabhramsha and Prakrit were Jains. The Rashtrakutas built well-known Jain temples at locations such as Lokapura in Bagalkot district and their loyal feudatory, the Western Ganga Dynasty, built Jain monuments at Shravanabelagola and Kambadahalli. Scholars have suggested that Jainism was a principal religion <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>very</b> <b>heart</b> of the empire, modern Karnataka, accounting for more than 30% of the population and dominating the culture of the region. King Amoghavarsha I was a disciple of the Jain acharya Jinasena and wrote in his religious writing, Prashnottara Ratnamalika, [...] "having bowed to Varaddhamana (Mahavira), I write Prashnottara Ratnamalika".
