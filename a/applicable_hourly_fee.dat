40|$|We study a {{model of}} civil dispute with {{delegation}} in which a plaintiff's lawyer works on a contingent-fee basis but a defendant's lawyer on an <b>hourly</b> <b>fee</b> basis.

We then show that under this profitable delegation condition, the contingent-fee fraction for the plaintiff's lawyer is about one-third.

In contrast to the previous literature pertaining to one-time interactions between clients and attorneys, {{we find that the}} contingent fee is not the best arrangement.

This contract includes an <b>hourly</b> <b>fee</b> equal to the law firm’s opportunity cost, a lump sum, and a retention function. The lump sum payment is independent of the number of hours worked by the law firm and the outcome of the case.

40|$|Abstract: The {{decision}} of a claimant to obtain legal counsel, {{the timing of}} this decision, and the impact on the settlement amount an insurer successfully can offer are the focus of this study. This paper draws on strategic models of litigation/settlement with endogenous settlement amounts in the law and economics literature, but differs by endogenizing the decision to hire an attorney and its timing. The main results are that under symmetric damage information the claimant gains bargaining power over the insurer and a higher net payoff by retaining an attorney on a contingency fee basis before the insurer makes an offer. <b>Hourly</b> <b>fees</b> never appear in equilibrium under symmetric information. Under asymmetric information when only contingency fees are available, there exists a separating equilibrium where the insurer can deduce the expected damage award of each claimant by his attorney-hiring strategy and offer a settlement appropriate for each type. There is no separating equilibrium if the possibility of <b>hourly</b> <b>fees</b> is included. ...|$|R

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{examines the}} effect of regulations, resource and referral agencies, and subsidies on price and quality of care in child care centers. This research {{is based on a}} carefully developed conceptual framework that incorporates the factors affecting the demand and supply of child care. The first step in developing this framework is sketching out the structural equations. The structural equations help us understand the underlying behavior of individuals and firms making a decision. The exogenous variables are vector of attributes relating to family characteristics, child characteristics, regulations, subsidy, community characteristics and prices of inputs. Based on the structural equations, reduced form equations are estimated to find {{the effect of}} each of the exogenous variables on each of the endogenous variables. Reduced form equations help us answer public policy questions. The sample for this study is from the 1990 Profile of Child Care Settings (PCCS) data in which 2, 089 center based programs were interviewed. ^ Child/Staff Ratio (Group Level). Results indicate that among subsidies, only the state subsidy per child in poverty has a significant effect on the child/staff ratio at the group level. Presence of resource and referral agencies also increase the child/staff ratio at the group level. Also when the maximum center group size regulation for 25 - 36 months becomes more stringent, the child/staff ratio at the group level decreases. ^ Child/Staff Ratio (Center Level). When the regulations for the maximum child/staff ratio for age groups 13 - 24 months and 37 - 60 months become lax, the child/staff ratio for the center increases. As the regulation for maximum group size for infants becomes stringent, the child/staff ratio decreases. An interesting finding is that as the regulations for maximum group size for age groups 13 - 24 months and 25 - 36 months become stringent, the child/staff ratio for the center increases. Another significant finding is that when a center is located in a rural area the child/staff ratio is significantly lower. ^ Center Weighted Average <b>Hourly</b> <b>Fees.</b> Maximum group size regulations for age groups 25 - 36 months and 37 - 60 months {{have a negative effect on}} center <b>hourly</b> <b>fee.</b> Maximum child staff regulations for age groups 13 - 24 months and 37 - 60 months have a negative effect on center <b>hourly</b> <b>fee.</b> Maximum child staff regulations for age groups 0 - 12 months and 25 - 36 months have a positive effect on center <b>hourly</b> <b>fee.</b> Findings also indicate that the center average hourly price is lower when there is a resource and referral agency present. Cost adjusted prekindergarten funds and JOBS child care subsidies have a negative effect on average <b>hourly</b> <b>fee.</b> Cost adjusted social services block grant and state subsidy per child in poverty have a positive effect on the average hourly price. A major finding of this dissertation is the interaction of subsidy and regulatory variables. ^ Another major finding is that child/staff ratio at the group level is lower when there is an interaction between geographic location and nature of center sponsorship. ...|$|R

40|$|Under the {{conditional}} fee arrangement, a lawyer receives an upscale premium if a case is won. In this article, we develop an asymmetric information game of settlement and litigation {{in order to}} compare <b>hourly</b> and conditional <b>fees</b> {{with regard to their}} effects on the number of frivolous suits being filed, the settlement rate of cases, and the total costs of litigation. The main result shows that a conditional fee schedule improves the efficiency of the litigation process under the English fee-shifting rule by undermining frivolous plaintiffs' incentives to file suit and then reducing total expenditures. It hence provides an additional theoretical foundation for the recent switchover from <b>hourly</b> <b>fees</b> to conditional fees in the United Kingdom. ...|$|R

In several fields, such as handwriting analysis, where the expert compares signatures to determine {{the likelihood of a}} forgery, and medical case reviews by a physician or nurse, in which the expert goes over hospital and medical records to assess the possibility of malpractice, experts often initially charge a flat fixed fee for their initial report. As with the <b>hourly</b> <b>fees</b> discussed previously, the amount of that flat fee varies considerably based on the reviewing expert's field, experience and reputation. [...] The expert's professional fee, plus his or her related expenses, is generally paid by the party retaining the expert. In some circumstance the party who prevails in the litigation may be entitled to recover the amounts paid to its expert from the losing party.In high stakes cases multiple experts, in multiple topics, are often retained by each party. Although it is still relatively rare, the court itself may also retain its own independent expert. In all cases, fees paid to an expert may not be contingent on the outcome of the case.|$|R
