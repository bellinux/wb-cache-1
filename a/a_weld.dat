5|$|Another common process, {{explosion}} welding, {{involves the}} joining of materials by pushing them together under extremely high pressure. The {{energy from the}} impact plasticizes the materials, forming <b>a</b> <b>weld,</b> even though only {{a limited amount of}} heat is generated. The process is commonly used for welding dissimilar materials, such as the welding of aluminum with steel in ship hulls or compound plates. Other solid-state welding processes include friction welding (including friction stir welding), magnetic pulse welding, co-extrusion welding, cold welding, diffusion bonding, exothermic welding, high frequency welding, hot pressure welding, induction welding, and roll welding.|$|E
5|$|Many {{distinct}} factors {{influence the}} strength of welds and the material around them, including the welding method, the amount and concentration of energy input, the weldability of the base material, filler material, and flux material, {{the design of the}} joint, and the interactions between all these factors. To test the quality of <b>a</b> <b>weld,</b> either destructive or nondestructive testing methods are commonly used to verify that welds are free of defects, have acceptable levels of residual stresses and distortion, and have acceptable heat-affected zone (HAZ) properties. Types of welding defects include cracks, distortion, gas inclusions (porosity), non-metallic inclusions, lack of fusion, incomplete penetration, lamellar tearing, and undercutting.|$|E
5|$|Welding is a {{fabrication}} or sculptural {{process that}} joins materials, usually metals or thermoplastics, by causing fusion, which {{is distinct from}} lower temperature metal-joining techniques such as brazing and soldering, which do not melt the base metal. In addition to melting the base metal, a filler material is typically added to the joint to form a pool of molten material (the weld pool) that cools to form a joint that is usually stronger than the base material. Pressure may also be {{used in conjunction with}} heat, or by itself, to produce <b>a</b> <b>weld.</b> Welding also requires a form of shield to protect the filler metals or melted metals from being contaminated or oxidized.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. During {{welding process}} to make joints, {{residual}} stress is inevitably produced and weld metal should be used. These influence the static and dynamic behavior of steel structures with welded joints, such as steel piles. In steel structures, dynamic mechanical behavior is different to static mechanical behavior. Therefore, to accurately predict {{the behavior of}} steel piles with <b>a</b> <b>welded</b> joint under static-dynamic loading, the research on influence of <b>a</b> <b>welded</b> joint on the static and dynamic behavior of steel piles is necessary. For that purpose, a rate-dependent plasticity model was used, considering strain rate hardening and temperature rise. In this paper, the distribution of welding residual stress in <b>a</b> <b>welded</b> joint was computed by using three-dimensional heat conduction analysis and three-dimensional thermal elastic-plastic analysis. The behavior of steel piles with <b>a</b> <b>welded</b> joint under axial static and dynamic loading was investigated by using three-dimensional elastic-plastic finite element analysis, which employed a rate-dependent plasticity model and included residual stress and mechanical properties of <b>weld</b> metal in <b>a</b> <b>welded</b> joint. The rate-dependent plasticity model used in this paper is proposed by the authors based on the static-dynamic loading tests.

25|$|The heater's {{failure mode}} is {{typically}} a stress-related fracture of the tungsten wire or at <b>a</b> <b>weld</b> point and generally occurs after accruing many thermal (power on-off) cycles. Tungsten wire {{has a very}} low resistance when at room temperature. A negative temperature coefficient device, such as a thermistor, may be incorporated in the equipment's heater supply or a ramp-up circuit may be employed to allow the heater or filaments to reach operating temperature more gradually than if powered-up in a step-function. Low-cost radios had tubes with heaters connected in series, with a total voltage {{equal to that of}} the line (mains). Some receivers made before World War II had series-string heaters with total voltage less than that of the mains. Some had a resistance wire running the length of the power cord to drop the voltage to the tubes. Others had series resistors made like regular tubes; they were called ballast tubes.|$|E
500|$|The {{level of}} heat input also affects weld quality. [...] Low heat input, caused by low welding current or high welding speed, can limit {{penetration}} and cause the weld bead to lift {{away from the}} surface being welded. If {{there is too much}} heat input, however, the weld bead grows in width while the likelihood of excessive penetration and spatter increase. Additionally, if the welding torch is too far from the workpiece the shielding gas becomes ineffective, causing porosity within the weld. This results in <b>a</b> <b>weld</b> with pinholes, which is weaker than a typical weld.|$|E
