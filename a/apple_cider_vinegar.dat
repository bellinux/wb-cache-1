40|$|The {{interest}} for locally produced food is increasing due to consumer {{concern about the}} environment, distrust of industrial foods and a demand for high quality products. Apple is the predominant fruit crop in Sweden, and by processing <b>apples</b> into <b>cider</b> and <b>vinegar,</b> these products could significantly {{contribute to the development}} of the market of local foods. In this study different yeast types and different bacterial cultures were evaluated for their suitability in <b>cider</b> and <b>vinegar</b> production from cloudy apple juice. Ten apple cultivars (Aroma, Baldwin, Belle de Boskoop, Bramley, Cortland, Gravensteiner, Ingrid-Marie, Jonathan, Rubinola and Spartan) were also evaluated for their suitability for production of juice, <b>cider</b> and <b>vinegar.</b> Chemical analyses including total soluble solids, titratable acidity and total phenols were performed on the products along with sensorial evaluation by taste panels. The yeast strains were shown to have an effect on fermentation rate and the resulting content of total phenols in ciders fermented from cloudy apple juice. Dry commercial starter strains gave a higher appreciated cider compared to cider that was spontaneously fermented, and the ale yeast Safale S- 04 was concluded to be the most suited for fermentation of cloudy apple juice. For vinegar production, the bacterial culture had an effect on TSS, but not on any other chemical or taste characteristics. Clear differences in acceptability were found between the cultures; the culture from Alles um den Essig, intended for the submerged method, seemed to better be suited to the used production system compared to cultures developed for the surface method. The cloudy apple juice from the different cultivars varied significantly in chemical composition, with TSS in the range of 9. 6 – 15. 1 %, TA 0. 41 – 1. 24 % and total phenols 123. 9 – 850. 0 mg GAE/L. The comparatively sweet juices of Jonathan and Spartan obtained the highest acceptance whereas juices with lower TSS/TS ratios were less acceptable by the taste panel. During fermentation into cider, the TSS decreased differentially in the cultivars, whereas the differences in TA and total phenols were unaffected. Ciders that were perceived to be comparatively sweet were accepted to a higher degree. The fermentation enhanced the taste differences between the cultivars, and Jonathan and Spartan, were also most accepted as <b>ciders.</b> For <b>vinegar,</b> the differences in traits decreased, and of all the chemical parameters only content of total phenols separated the cultivars. There was however a tendency of lower acceptance of vinegar from Belle de Boskoop, Gravensteiner and Jonathan. It was concluded that several aspects influence the quality of cloudy <b>apple</b> juice, <b>cider</b> and <b>vinegar,</b> including cultivar, ripeness and choice of microorganisms for fermentation. For juices and ciders, sweeter products were preferred to a large extent, and the TSS/TA ratio appears to be a good predictor of consumer acceptance. In this study, an apple cultivar with a juice of good taste generally also produced a good cider, whereas the cultivar was of less importance for vinegar production...|$|R

40|$|University of Minnesota M. S. thesis. May 2014. Major: Food Science. Advisor: Baraem Ismail. 1 {{computer}} file (PDF); viii, 83 pages. The mycotoxin patulin, {{produced by a}} number of fungi, most prominently Penicillium expansum, has proven problematic for the apple industry due to contamination of apple juice and <b>apple</b> <b>cider.</b> Presently, techniques to control patulin accumulation have proven increasingly ineffective due to the presence of antifungal resistant strains of mold, stability of patulin during thermal processing, and conflicting data on the efficacy of other treatments. However, fermented apple products such as hard <b>ciders</b> and <b>apple</b> <b>cider</b> <b>vinegars</b> are devoid of patulin. Fermentation with yeast resulted in complete degradation of patulin, possibly due to enzymatic degradation by yeast enzymes. Patulin has also been shown to be susceptible to adduct formation with free thiol containing molecules such as glutathione, which is naturally present in yeast cells. Limited studies have also looked at patulin adsorptivity onto the call walls of yeast. Degradation of patulin is, therefore, hypothesized to be caused by multiple mechanisms mainly caused by yeast proteins/enzymes. To assess the loss of patulin by protein extracted from yeast (Rhodosporidium kratochvilovae strain 62 - 121), patulin extraction methods were compared to determine the optimal method for patulin extraction from protein rich environments. The effect of boiling to halt any possible enzymatic degradation on total patulin loss was assessed by comparing patulin recovery to that of samples placed on ice after the assay. Yeast growth was optimized for the production of patulin-degrading protein extracts by surveying days of growth and subsequent storage at 4 °C. Additionally, free thiol group reactivity with patulin was assessed upon incubation with protein extract, cysteine, and glutathione. Liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry (LC/MS) was used to detect patulin degradation products. Potential enzymatic activity was assessed by comparing the degradation activity of different protein extracts from yeast. Finally, patulin loss due to adsorption to inactivated yeast cell walls was determined. The use of acid and salt to precipitate the protein before patulin extraction resulted in the best patulin recovery from protein rich media, and an additional extraction following a modified AOAC method allowed for removal of excess salt without sacrificing patulin recovery. The use of boiling to denature the protein after the assay resulted in 10 % higher patulin loss than when the samples were placed on ice, presumably due to adduct formation with thiol groups. Growing yeast for 6 days at room temperature was deemed adequate to obtain optimal patulin degradation; and subsequent incubation of the yeast at 4 °C did not impair the patulin degradation activity. Yeast protein extracts were found to be inconsistent with respect to patulin degradation activity, nevertheless patulin degradation activity (up to 100 % patulin) was observed in several batches. Patulin incubated with cysteine showed signs of free thiol blockage in both samples of protein extract and pure cysteine. Patulin incubated with glutathione was degraded at both pH 7 and 3. 7, and one patulin-glutathione adduct (462 m/z) was identified via LC/MS. Lyophilized yeast cells demonstrated patulin adsorption capabilities after incubation at 30 °C for 20 min. Observed results confirm that patulin can be degraded by the protein extract from yeast. The exact mechanism of patulin degradation by protein extracts remains unclear, yet it appears to be either enzymatic or chemical through thiol adduct formation. Our results indicated that the mechanism is a combination of the two. This research offers insight into possible patulin degradation mechanisms, and can give direction in applying this new method of patulin control in an industrial setting...|$|R
