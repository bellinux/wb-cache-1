40|$|New {{blood vessel}} {{formation}} requires {{the coordination of}} endothelial cell division and the morphogenetic movements of vessel expansion, {{but it is not}} known how this integration occurs. Here, we show that endothelial cells regulate division orientation during the earliest stages of blood vessel formation, in response to morphogenetic cues. In embryonic stem (ES) cell–derived vessels that do not experience flow, the plane of endothelial cytokinesis was oriented perpendicular to the vessel long axis. We also demonstrated regulated cleavage orientation in vivo, in flow-exposed forming retinal vessels. Daughter nuclei moved away from the cleavage plane after division, suggesting that regulation of endothelial division orientation effectively extends vessel length in these developing vascular beds. A gain-of-function mutation in VEGF signaling increased randomization of endothelial division orientation, <b>and</b> <b>this</b> effect <b>was</b> rescued by a transgene, indicating that regulation of division orientation is a novel mechanism whereby VEGF signaling affects vessel morphogenesis. Thus, our findings show that endothelial cell division and morphogenesis are integrated in developing vessels by flow-independent mechanisms that involve VEGF signaling, <b>and</b> <b>this</b> cross <b>talk</b> <b>is</b> likely to be critical to proper vessel morphogenesis...|$|R

The four-colour theorem is {{equivalent}} to the statement that every planar cubic graph with no cut-edge is 3 -edge-colourable. What about non-planar cubic graphs? The Petersen graph is not 3 -edge-colourable, and in 1966 Tutte conjectured that every cubic graph with no cut-edge that does not contain the Petersen graph as a minor is 3 -edge-colourable. In 1996 we proved this conjecture, but did not publish the result, for reasons that escape me. We are currently getting it all back together for publication; <b>and</b> <b>this</b> <b>talk</b> <b>is</b> an outline. A graph is "apex'' if deleting some vertex makes it planar; and "doublecross'' if it can be drawn in the plane with crossings, but with only two crossings and both incident with the same region.

These questions are asked in good faith, <b>and</b> <b>this</b> <b>talk</b> <b>is</b> an opportunity to answer them directly to much of the RHIC community.

40|$|Invited Plenary TalkInternational audienceRecently, some {{relations}} have appeared between tropicalalgebra, linear programming, Perron-Frobenius theory, <b>and</b> zero-sumgames. <b>This</b> <b>talk</b> <b>is</b> devoted to these relations and to theirconsequences. In particular, we shall {{make a connection}} between twowell known unsolved questions. The first is the existence of astrongly polynomial pivoting rule in linear programming. Such a rulewould allow us to solve a linear program {{in a number of}} arithmeticoperations bounded only by the number of variables and the number ofconstraints. The second question is the existence of a polynomialalgorithm to solve mean payoff games. In work with Allamigeon,Benchimol, and Joswig, we showed that a positive answer to the firstquestion would yield a positive answer to the second, provided thepivoting rule satisfies certain conditions. This uses the equivalencebetween mean payoff games and tropical linear programs, established inan earlier work with Akian and Guterman. The proof of these resultswill give us the opportunity to see at work non-linearPerron-Frobenius theory, {{as well as a number}} of basic tropical tools:tropical eigenvalues, extensions or symmetrization of semirings,tropical analogues of Cramer theorem...|$|R
40|$|This study {{investigates the}} discursive {{management}} of taking prohibited substances in sport. In particular, it explores how one high-profile athlete, Australian cricketer Shane Warne, accounted for his drug-taking behavior when {{talking to the}} media. Discursive psychology (DP) is used as the theoretical and methodological framework to study drug discourses in sport. Emphasis in DP is on making explicit how psychological concepts (e. g., drug explanations) are used in everyday talk to perform certain actions. The research data is Warne's first public press statement concerning his 2003 positive test for hydrochlorothiazide and amiloride. Analysis reveals that Warne constructed his drug taking as not being related to performance enhancement <b>and</b> substantiated <b>this</b> {{with a history of}} negative test results. Warne worked up his taking as the result of ignorance rather than deliberate deception. Further, he presented this as a one-off event and not reflective of systematic drug usage.

40|$|Several {{published}} reports have now documented the clinical effectiveness of motivational interviewing (MI). Despite its effectiveness, {{there are no}} generally accepted or empirically supported theoretical accounts of its effects. The theoretical accounts that do exist are mentalistic, descriptive, and not based on empirically derived behavioral principles. Empirical research is being generated regarding the role of client and therapist verbal behavior in MI. Client and therapist speech in MI sessions has been correlated with subsequent client behavior change (Amrhein, Miller, Yahne, & Fulcher, 2003; Gaume, Gmel, & Daeppen, 2008; Moyers et al., 2007). Although provocative, these findings are correlational and no theory has yet been provided to explain them. The purposes of the present paper are (a) to bring MI {{to the attention of}} clinical behavior analysts; (b) to provide a conceptual account of MI that relies on recent developments in the behavior analysis of motivation and verbal behavior, especially stimulus equivalence and transformation of functions; (c) to provide a possible answer to two critical questions: “How does MI evoke client in-session talk abut behavior change?” <b>and</b> “Why <b>is</b> <b>this</b> change <b>talk</b> related to outcomes?”; and (d) to use this account to identify important research questions and perhaps enhance MI's effectiveness...|$|R
40|$|Learning {{is rapidly}} {{evolving}} from {{an activity that}} is designed, packaged and delivered by formal learning organizations, to one co-designed by individuals and networks of life-long learners. In this presentation Terry talks about the evolution of online learning from delivery models designed around monolithic virtual learning environments, to ones in which a variety of tools are used to connect learners with teachers, resources and collaborators. Effective learning now continuously morphs among individual, group, network and collective activities. Each requires learning designs and tools that adapt to and exploit the unique learning affordances of that context. Social software and web 2. 0 applications create opportunity to move formal education from a content transmission to a knowledge creation models. However, such systemic change creates disruption in current practices, attitudes and required skill sets of faculty and education administrators. Adoption and effective use does not come easily for institutions especially for this with successful histories with older models of teaching <b>and</b> learning. <b>This</b> <b>talk</b> <b>is</b> designed to explore, expose and challenge educational leaders and to equip them as effective agents of change in their learning contexts. The presentation overviews a conceptual model that differentiates the functions of groups, networks and collectives in supporting formal education and informal learning. The effective use of these new technologies requires new pedagogical models of learning and teaching. The session overviews new pedagogies that have evolved within a network intensive context. These include connectivism - 'a pedagogy for the networked era' and traces its development from constructivist and chaos theory. Finally the session looks at how learning ecologies are developed and sustained throughout and beyond formal education...|$|R
