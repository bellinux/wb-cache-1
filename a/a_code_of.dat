5|$|Local economies near major {{coral reefs}} {{benefit from an}} {{abundance}} of fish and other marine creatures as a food source. Reefs also provide recreational scuba diving and snorkeling tourism. These activities can damage coral but international projects such as Green Fins that encourage dive and snorkel centres to follow <b>a</b> <b>Code</b> <b>of</b> Conduct have been proven to mitigate these risks.|$|E

5|$|While {{waiting to}} be summoned to his unit, Tolkien sank into boredom. To pass the time, he {{composed}} a poem entitled The Lonely Isle, which was inspired by his feelings during the sea crossing to Calais. To evade the British Army's postal censorship, he also developed <b>a</b> <b>code</b> <b>of</b> dots by which Edith could track his movements.|$|E
5|$|During {{the period}} of English control over Scotland, there is some {{evidence}} to suggest that King Edward I attempted to abolish Scottish laws that were contrary to English law, as he had done in Wales. Under Robert I in 1318, a parliament at Scone enacted <b>a</b> <b>code</b> <b>of</b> law that drew upon older practices, but it was also dominated by current events and focused on military matters and the conduct of the war. Nevertheless, the Act also codified procedures for criminal trials and protections for vassals from ejection from the land. From the fourteenth century, there are surviving examples of early Scottish legal literature, such as the Regiam Majestatem (on procedure at the royal courts) and the Quoniam Attachiamenta (on procedure at the baron courts), which drew on both common and Roman law.|$|E

5|$|He {{was also}} {{famous for his}} love of cockfighting, hát bội (Vietnamese {{classical}} opera) and court dancing, {{all of which were}} popular with the common Vietnamese southerner. He reportedly gave a long speech praising cockfighting, in a joking manner, to Emperor Gia Long and sometimes beat the drum himself in order to encourage the actors and actresses of the hát bội troupes when they were performing for him. He was also known for his patronage of goddess spirits that were popularly venerated by local southerners in folk religions. In addition, Duyệt was the instructor of three đình formalities, <b>a</b> <b>code</b> <b>of</b> ceremonial conduct and customs that were copies of royal rituals.|$|E
5|$|However, {{in order}} to {{accomplish}} its aims, morality must be legitimate in the eyes of those to whom it speaks. As Durkheim argues, this moral authority is primarily to be located in religion, which is why in any religion one finds <b>a</b> <b>code</b> <b>of</b> morality. For Durkheim, it is only society that has the resources, the respect, and the power to cultivate within an individual both the obligatory and the desirous aspects of morality.|$|E
5|$|In 1929, an American Roman Catholic layman Martin Quigley, {{editor of}} the {{prominent}} trade paper Motion Picture Herald, and Father Daniel A. Lord, a Jesuit priest, created <b>a</b> <b>code</b> <b>of</b> standards (which Hays liked immensely), and submitted it to the studios. Lord's concerns centered on the effects sound film had on children, whom he considered especially susceptible to their allure. Several studio heads, including Irving Thalberg of Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM), met with Lord and Quigley in February 1930. After some revisions, they agreed to the stipulations of the Code. One of the main motivating factors in adopting the Code was to avoid direct government intervention. It was {{the responsibility of the}} Studio Relations Committee, headed by Colonel Jason S. Joy, to supervise film production and advise the studios when changes or cuts were required.|$|E

5|$|In {{the early}} 18th century, Bath {{acquired}} its first purpose-built theatre, the Old Orchard Street Theatre. It was rebuilt as the Theatre Royal, {{along with the}} Grand Pump Room attached to the Roman Baths and assembly rooms. Master of ceremonies Beau Nash, {{who presided over the}} city's social life from 1705 until his death in 1761, drew up <b>a</b> <b>code</b> <b>of</b> behaviour for public entertainments. Bath had become perhaps the most fashionable of the rapidly developing British spa towns, attracting many notable visitors such as the wealthy London bookseller Andrew Millar and his wife, who both made long visits.|$|E
5|$|Later, again under {{pressure}} from the plebs, a political compromise was reached in which the consuls and tribunes would give place to a commission of ten men, the decemviri, who would be empowered to publish <b>a</b> <b>code</b> <b>of</b> laws for all Rome. According to Livy, it codified all public and private law, but however, its promulgation did not grant further political rights to the plebs, as it enshired into the tables a law banning intermarriage between plebeians and patricians. With a short attempt to establish a tyranny by the decemviri, they were overthrown by the second secession of the army, restoring the old republic and preventing {{the creation of a new}} constitution based on the ten-man commission.|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, another immigrant, Hsin, {{tends to}} his leukemia-stricken daughter, Kim. To {{pay for her}} treatments, Hsin attends an {{underground}} lottery in which participants either win money or lose an organ, depending on tiles chosen {{from a pair of}} vases. One man wins the lottery but selects a bad tile, and his body is found later that day. Scully performs an autopsy and finds that he had been selling body parts, noticing his numerous surgical scars. The agents question Chao, who claims that the local community maintains <b>a</b> <b>code</b> <b>of</b> silence and does not reveal anything to even him.|$|E
5|$|Napoleon's set {{of civil}} laws, the Code Civil—now often {{known as the}} Napoleonic Code—was {{prepared}} by committees of legal experts {{under the supervision of}} Jean Jacques Régis de Cambacérès, the Second Consul. Napoleon participated actively in the sessions of the Council of State that revised the drafts. The development of the code was a fundamental change {{in the nature of the}} civil law legal system with its stress on clearly written and accessible law. Other codes ("Les cinq codes") were commissioned by Napoleon to codify criminal and commerce law; <b>a</b> <b>Code</b> <b>of</b> Criminal Instruction was published, which enacted rules of due process.|$|E
5|$|Right {{from the}} {{beginning}} of the march, the volunteers faced many disruptions. When they reached Koviladi, a small village on the banks of Kaveri, they were denied accommodation at a famous inn. However, they found alternative accommodation on the banks of the river, while Rajaji stayed at a private house. Rajaji also had <b>a</b> <b>code</b> <b>of</b> conduct for the volunteers under which consumption of coffee and tobacco products, and smoking were prohibited.|$|E

5|$|Rotblat {{retired from}} St Bartholomew's in 1976. In 1975–1976, he was Montague Visiting Professor of International Relations at the University of Edinburgh. He {{believed}} that scientists have an individual moral responsibility and, {{just as the}} Hippocratic Oath provides <b>a</b> <b>code</b> <b>of</b> conduct for physicians, he thought that scientists should have their own code of moral conduct, a Hippocratic Oath for scientists. During his tenure {{as president of the}} Pugwash conferences, Rotblat nominated Israeli nuclear technician Mordechai Vanunu for the Nobel Peace Prize every year from 1988 to 2004. Vanunu had disclosed the extent of Israel's nuclear weapons programme and consequently spent 18 years in prison, including more than 11 years in solitary confinement.|$|E
5|$|Televised {{hearings}} in early 1957 exposed misconduct {{by both the}} Beck and the Hoffa factions of the Teamsters Union. Both Hoffa and Beck were indicted, but Hoffa won the battle {{for control of the}} Teamsters. In response, the AFL-CIO instituted a policy that no union official who had taken the Fifth Amendment during a corruption investigation could continue in a leadership position. Meany told the Teamsters that they could continue as members of the AFL-CIO if Hoffa resigned as president. Hoffa refused, and the Teamsters were ousted from the AFL-CIO on December 6, 1957. Meany supported the AFL-CIO's adoption of <b>a</b> <b>code</b> <b>of</b> ethics, {{in the wake of the}} scandal.|$|E
5|$|The Bhutanese {{subsequently}} redesigned their flag {{to match}} the measurements of the flag of India, which they believed fluttered better than their own. Other modifications such as changing the red background color to orange led to the current design, in use since 1969. The National Assembly of Bhutan codified <b>a</b> <b>code</b> <b>of</b> conduct in 1972 to formalize the flag's design and establish protocol regarding acceptable flag sizes and conditions for flying the flag.|$|E
