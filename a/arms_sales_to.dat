5|$|In 1986, the Iran–Contra affair {{became a}} problem for the {{administration}} stemming from the use of proceeds from covert <b>arms</b> <b>sales</b> <b>to</b> Iran during the Iran–Iraq War to fund the Contra rebels fighting against the government in Nicaragua, which had been specifically outlawed by an act of Congress. The affair became a political scandal in the United States during the 1980s. The International Court of Justice, whose jurisdiction to decide the case was disputed by the United States, ruled that the United States had violated international law and breached treaties in Nicaragua in various ways.|$|E
5|$|As {{part of the}} Nixon Doctrine {{that the}} U.S. would avoid direct combat {{assistance}} to allies where possible, instead giving them assistance to defend themselves, the U.S. greatly increased <b>arms</b> <b>sales</b> <b>to</b> the Middle East—particularly Israel, Iran and Saudi Arabia—during the Nixon administration. The Nixon administration strongly supported Israel, an American ally in the Middle East, but the support was not unconditional. Nixon believed that Israel should make peace with its Arab neighbors and that the United States should encourage it. The president believed that—except during the Suez Crisis—the U.S. had failed to intervene with Israel, and should use the leverage of the large U.S. military aid to Israel to urge {{the parties to the}} negotiating table. The Arab-Israeli conflict was not a major focus of Nixon's attention during his first term—for one thing, he felt that no matter what he did, American Jews would oppose his reelection.|$|E
5|$|In {{the debates}} {{leading up to}} World War I, a number of isolationist {{senators}} filibustered bills that Wilson considered important. The filibusters lasted for weeks and twice lasted for over three months. Wilson and the bills' supporters requested that Marshall put a gag-order in place to cut off debate, but he refused on ethical grounds, allowing a number of bills to be defeated in hopes that opposition would eventually end their filibuster. Among the defeated bills was one allowing merchant ships to arm themselves, and another allowing the US government to make direct <b>arms</b> <b>sales</b> <b>to</b> the allies. Despite their victories, {{the small group of}} senators continued to lock up the senate to prevent any pro-war legislation from passing. In response, Marshall led the Senate to adopt a new rule on March 8, 1917, allowing filibusters to be broken by two-thirds of voting Senators. This replaced the previous rule that allowed any senator to prolong debate as long as he desired. The rule has been modified several times, most prominently that the current rule requires three-fifths of all Senators, not only the ones voting.|$|E

50|$|In 1975, President Gerald Ford's <b>arms</b> <b>sale</b> <b>to</b> Jordan led Congress {{to examine}} how to {{strengthen}} the Nelson-Bingham Amendment. A significant number of sale notifications {{had been allowed to}} be kept classified by the executive. The time period of Congressional review had been found to be deficient and the dollar level of $25 million as a tripwire had prevented a number of smaller sales from avoiding scrutiny. Members of Congress also sought to expand the scope of their review beyond government-to-government <b>sales.</b> The 1976 <b>Arms</b> Control Act incorporated these and other changes.|$|R

5000|$|Iraq ordered four Lupo class frigates, and six Wadi Assad class corvettes {{equipped}} with Otomat-2 anti-shipping missiles. Due <b>to</b> restrictions on <b>arm</b> <b>sales</b> <b>to</b> Iraq {{because of the}} Iran-Iraq War placed by the Italian prime minister Bettino Craxi, these ships remained interned in Italy {{until the end of}} that war in 1988. Iraqi President Saddam Hussein then tried to renegotiate the price of these ships, claiming he should receive a discount due the delay in delivery of the ships. Negotiations and court proceedings were still ongoing when Iraq invaded Kuwait in 1990 and a new arms embargo against Iraq was placed by the United Nations, again blocking the sale. Although these four frigates and the six corvettes were ultimately seized by Italy under the United Nations embargo during the 1991 Gulf War, these purchases signaled Iraq's intention to upgrade its naval power.|$|R
