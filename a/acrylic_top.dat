40|$|The behaviour/resistance of four {{optimised}} sol-gel coating systems (inorganic, hybrid organic-inorganic, containing zirconium ions and containing cerium ions) against corrosion of AZ 91 {{magnesium alloy}} were studied. The coatings {{obtained by the}} sol-gel process were evaluated as autonomous protective coatings {{as well as a}} pre-treatment prior to <b>acrylic</b> <b>top</b> coat. The coating obtained from tetramethoxysilane (TMOS) and diethoxydimethylsilane (DEDMS) as precursors and doped with Ce 3 + was especially effective as pre-treatment for a final acrylic coating. For non-defected coating the impedance modulus has not changed during the time of immersion (7 days) in 0. 5 M Na 2 SO 4. An inhibition of coating delamination at the defect of the acrylic coating was recorded by means of LEIS. © 2010 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved. Peer Reviewe...|$|E
40|$|Master's thesis in Environmental technologyGas hydrate {{formation}} posses {{a notorious}} {{concern for the}} oil and gas industry, and it only gets bigger because of that the never-ending pursuit of oil and gas compels the industry into deeper and colder waters. Here gas hydrate can from and agglomerate into plugs, jeopardizing pipelines and process equipments. Therefore a variety of methods have been developed to inhibit gas hydrate formation, one of them being to utilize low dosage hydrate inhibitors, which consists of kinetic hydrate inhibitors and anti-agglomerants. Low dosage hydrate inhibitors are relatively expensive, and it is therefore important to determine effective concentrations in laboratory apparatuses. Test apparatuses and methods are numerous, and the majority are THF rigs, rocker rigs, autoclaves, pipe wheels and flow loops. Prior methods for assessing hydrate inhibitors performance concentration tend to suffer form not being repeatable in addition to be inconsistent. Thus there are always possible for new hydrate inhibition test methods and apparatuses. A prototype table top wheel was developed for testing low dosage hydrate inhibitors. It consisted of a wheel submerged in a water bath. Unique features of the table top wheel was its small size, the <b>acrylic</b> <b>top</b> disk and the mode of moving the liquid in the apparatus. A swirling circular motion made the liquid move based on the "Euler disk" mechanical movement, hence no pumps or internal equipment for propelling the liquid was utilized. Preliminary tests were conducted to approve the apparatus for future experimental work, by providing a gas hydrate formation method of a consistent manner. The result for the same anti-agglomerant range in both 1. 5 wt% NaCl solution and distilled water, obtained in the table top wheel was compared to the rocker rig RCS 20. This was done to confirm if this apparatus indeed could be used to rank inhibitors, thus a validation of the apparatus. It was confirmed that the table top wheel result for the same anti-agglomerant range in both 1. 5 wt% NaCl solution and distilled water had the same trend as the results from the rocker rig. The table top wheel was thereby validated and approved at least for this anti-agglomerant range. However, the concentration required for an adequate inhibition was higher in the table top wheel compared to the rocker rig, hence the table top wheel was a more conservative test apparatus than the rocker rig. Unfortunately the table top wheel could not be operated safely after 59 pressurized experiments, due to cracks in the <b>acrylic</b> <b>top</b> disk. This was a severely design flaws which must be sorted out for the apparatus to progress. However, as far as being a prototype the table top wheel approved to be adequate. It yielded reliable and predictable test results and provided a consistent method for both hydrate formation and inhibitor testing...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{reports on}} {{experimental}} work {{to measure the}} adhesion, flexibility, and onset of cracking of modern paint layers. The objective was to investigate systematically and in greater detail the most significant findings of previous research into the mechanical characterization of composite paint layers with different media on canvas substrates. First, testing of layered alkyds and acrylics indicates that at low strains the mechanical properties of the composites can be predicted by combining {{the properties of the}} individual layers in proportion to their thickness. However, at higher strains this is not the case. After the failure of an alkyd layer, the stiffness is higher than what would be predicted assuming the load was taken by the acrylic layer only. Second, acrylic primings reduce the amount of cracking in the alkyd top layers, appearing to retard their normal brittle behavior. Conversely, failure of alkyd primings occurs but the <b>acrylic</b> <b>top</b> layer remains visually intact. Samples consist of commercially available oil, alkyd, and acrylic primings with subsequent paint layers of different pigments in oil, acrylic, and alkyd media. The priming and paint layers were prepared as composites on canvas and as free films. Mandrel and fold tests were performed to measure flexibility; the tensile force needed to detach the upper paint layer from a composite was used to measure adhesion. Crack initiation/propagation were captured using a CCD. The acquired data will result in a better understanding of interfacial interactions and potential failure modes of modern paint-layer combinations...|$|E
50|$|Firebirds optioned with T-tops {{received}} new <b>acrylic</b> plastic <b>tops</b> made by Leximar for GM. The new tops were lighter {{in weight}} and tinted darker, but were more dome shaped and aged rapidly. GM replaced many sets with tops {{made of glass}} under warranty, but the <b>acrylic</b> <b>tops</b> continued as standard-issue through 1992. All Firebirds optioned with rear disc brakes now received PBR brake calipers and larger brake rotors, which resolved issues encountered with previous-model rear discs and increased stopping power. Introduction of GM's Vehicle Anti Theft System (VATS) or PASS-Key made all Firebirds more theft-resistant. The system was adapted from GM's higher-end Corvette and Cadillac vehicles {{in response to an}} escalating trend among car thieves to target the Camaro and Firebird. VATS incorporated a small resistor into the ignition key shaft which was read by a sensor when the key was inserted. VATS-equipped cars also displayed anti-theft system warning decals in the lower rear corners of the side windows. A new CD player was offered, shoulder belts were added in the back seat, and the convertible model carried over.|$|R

40|$|AbstractDuring dynamic tennis {{specific}} movements, such as accelerating {{and side}} stepping, the traction {{provided by a}} shoe-surface combination {{plays an important role}} in the injury risk and performance of the player. Acrylic hard court tennis surfaces have been reported to have increased injury occurrence due to an increased traction coefficient. There is a requirement for an improved scientific understanding of the tribological interactions at the shoe surface interface and the effects footwear and surface parameters have on the friction mechanism developed. Often mechanical test methods used for the testing and categorisation of playing surfaces do not tend to simulate loads occurring during participation on the surface, and thus are unlikely to predict human response to the surface. A new traction testing device, discussed in this paper, has been developed to mechanically measure the traction force between the shoe and the surface under appropriate loading conditions. Acrylic Harcourt tennis surfaces generally have a rough surface topography, due to a sand and <b>acrylic</b> paint mixed <b>top</b> coating, and have a deformable under layer to provide impact attenuation. Surface micro-roughness has been found to influence the friction mechanisms presents during viscoelastic contacts, as found in footwear-surface interactions. This paper aims to further understand the influence of micro-roughness on tennis surfaces. The micro-roughness and traction of a controlled set of acrylic hard court tennis surfaces have been measured. The influence of roughness on tennis surfaces traction is discussed...|$|R
