5|$|DJ Hero was {{generally}} well received by game journalists, praising the {{departure from the}} Guitar Hero series-style of gameplay, {{the use of the}} turntable controller to simulate the motions of a DJ and how the game's difficulty curve helps the player to become skilled on it, and the game's soundtrack; several smaller issues were identified as potential improvements for a possible sequel. However, the game did not perform <b>as</b> <b>strongly</b> <b>as</b> expected by industry analysts, believed to be due to the waning interest in music games during 2009; regardless, DJ Hero is stated by NPD Group to be the highest-grossing new intellectual property of 2009 in North America.|$|E
5|$|Egyptian texts take {{different}} views {{on whether the}} gods are responsible when humans suffer unjustly. Misfortune was often seen {{as a product of}} isfet, the cosmic disorder that was the opposite of maat, and therefore the gods were not guilty of causing evil events. Some deities who were closely connected with isfet, such as Set, could be blamed for disorder within the world without placing guilt on the other gods. But some writings do accuse the deities of causing human misery, while others give theodicies in the gods' defense. Beginning in the Middle Kingdom, several texts connected the issue of evil in the world with a myth in which the creator god fights a human rebellion against his rule and then withdraws from the earth. Because of this human misbehavior, the creator is distant from his creation, allowing suffering to exist. New Kingdom writings do not question the just nature of the gods <b>as</b> <b>strongly</b> <b>as</b> those of the Middle Kingdom. They emphasize humans' direct, personal relationships with deities and the gods' power to intervene in human events. People in this era put faith in specific gods who they hoped would help and protect them through their lives. As a result, upholding the ideals of maat grew less important than gaining the gods' favor as a way to guarantee a good life. Even the pharaohs were regarded as dependent on divine aid, and after the New Kingdom came to an end, government was increasingly influenced by oracles communicating the gods' will.|$|E

25|$|Expectations for Brann {{were low}} {{ahead of the}} 2011 season, with VG {{predicting}} that Brann would be relegated. Nonetheless, Brann opened the season strongly with victories over reigning league champion Rosenborg and Lillestrøm {{in the first and}} second rounds. Although the season did not continue <b>as</b> <b>strongly</b> <b>as</b> that, Brann remained a contender for a top three position in the league and the team also qualified to the 2011 Norwegian Football Cup Final by defeating Fredrikstad in the semi-final. Hopes for a medal were dashed however, when Brann first lost the cup final 1-2 against Aalesund, and then the last match of the league, also against Aalesund. Finally, Brann finished in fourth place.|$|E
25|$|After two seasons, NBC {{saw that}} Punky Brewster and its {{principal}} Sunday night stablemate, the four-year-old Silver Spoons, could not compete <b>as</b> <b>strongly</b> <b>as</b> they hoped against CBS' juggernaut 60 Minutes, and cancelled both programs. Like many cult-favorite sitcoms of the time, Punky Brewster was revived for first-run syndication (as was Silver Spoons). Production on Punky went undelayed, and its third season began shooting on schedule. While {{the show was}} in production throughout the 1986-87 season, it {{did not return to}} the air via first-run syndication until October 30, 1987. Beginning on that premiere date, Punky was packaged such that new episodes would air every weekday (usually late in the afternoon on independent stations). The entire third season (1986–87) aired in the five-days-a-week format through December 7, 1987.|$|E
25|$|Shortly afterwards, John Paul Jones got the {{opportunity}} {{he had been}} striving for—not a moment too soon, as his ship had been holed below the waterline and was becoming increasingly unresponsive. Serapis’ jib-boom caught in the rigging of Bonhomme Richard’s mizzen mast, and Jones immediately led his crew in attaching the two ships together <b>as</b> <b>strongly</b> <b>as</b> they could. Seeing the danger, Pearson dropped anchor. Because both ships were under sail, when Serapis {{came to an abrupt}} halt, Bonhomme Richard would keep going, and with luck, tear free. Jones’ men had been very efficient, so what actually happened was that Bonhomme Richard’s motion was turned into a rotation, and the two ships, still firmly attached, ended up side-by-side, facing in opposite directions, their great guns touching each other’s hull planks. Better still for Jones, Serapis’ spare anchor caught in the woodwork of Bonhomme Richard’s stern, locking the two ships in that extraordinary position. Making a virtue of necessity, Pearson’s crew fired broadsides straight into Bonhomme Richard’s hull, tearing huge holes in its side, and doing terrible damage to the gun-decks. For Jones’s boarding plan to succeed, he needed to drive all the Royal Navy sailors from Serapis’ deck before his ship was destroyed beneath him. He had prepared well for such an eventuality, and his men at stations up the masts were equipped both with small guns and with incendiary grenades. Three 9-pound guns on the quarter-deck (the rear part of the upper deck) were still usable, although one was on the wrong side, and had to be dragged around. Two of these guns were loaded with anti-personnel grapeshot to help drive Pearson’s men from the deck, but the third was used with solid bar-shot (see Naval Artillery page) aimed at Serapis’ main-mast.|$|E

500|$|Meanwhile, the Australian Mounted Division {{advanced}} {{in the direction}} of Tel es Safi to press the left flank of the Ottoman forces <b>as</b> <b>strongly</b> <b>as</b> possible. About 4,000 Australian and British mounted troops of 3rd and 4th Light Horse and 5th Mounted Brigades moved northwards in a conspicuous demonstration of aggression. At first it appeared that the Ottoman formations had retired altogether; the 9th Light Horse Regiment (3rd Light Horse Brigade) rode through Barqusya, one troop pressing on to occupy Tel es Safi. The 5th Mounted Brigade also found Balin unoccupied, and rapidly advanced northwards towards Tel es Safi and Kustineh. By 12:00 the Australian Mounted Division was spread over at least [...] facing the north and east when four divisions of the Ottoman 7th Army (about 5,000 soldiers) began their advance southwards from the railway.|$|E

500|$|Although *Emilia is {{explicitly}} female, Love purposely {{ensured that the}} protagonist's gender is never stated, as she {{wanted them to be}} a blank slate that the player would project themselves into, rather than a character that the player would control. She intended for this, combined with never showing what the protagonist actually says, to create more immersion in the story. Unofficially, however, Love thought of the relationship as [...] "queer", both in respect to the player's gender and in respect to *Emilia as [...] "a confused adolescent falling in love with someone she's not supposed to"; Love has stated that this did not come across <b>as</b> <b>strongly</b> <b>as</b> she intended. Love has said that one of the intended messages of the game was the importance of love and relationships, though not necessarily romantic love; as an example she specifically referenced *Emilia valuing saving her [...] "family" [...] due to her love for them over her adolescent love for the player.|$|E
500|$|The city's origins {{lay in the}} {{foundation}} of an abbey in 673, [...] {{to the north of}} the village of Cratendune on the Isle of Ely, under the protection of Saint Etheldreda, daughter of King Anna. This first abbey was destroyed in 870 by Danish invaders and rededicated to Etheldreda in 970 by Ethelwold, Bishop of Winchester. The abbots of Ely then accumulated such wealth in the region that in the Domesday survey (1086) it was the [...] "second richest monastery in England". The first Norman bishop, Simeon, started building the cathedral in 1083. The octagon was rebuilt by sacrist Alan of Walsingham between 1322 and 1328 after the collapse of the original nave crossing on 22February 1322. Ely's octagon is considered [...] "one of the wonders of the medieval world". Architectural historian Nikolaus Pevsner believes the octagon [...] "is a delight from beginning to end for anyone who feels for space <b>as</b> <b>strongly</b> <b>as</b> for construction" [...] and is the [...] "greatest individual achievement of architectural genius at Ely Cathedral".|$|E
500|$|Like its predecessor, Segundo Romance {{continued}} {{the revival of}} interest in bolero music. Mark Holston wrote that the album [...] "proves again that the bolero is back, its heart beating <b>as</b> <b>strongly</b> <b>as</b> ever, its soul alive with tropical passion, a music for every time and all times". According to Enrique Lopetegui of the Los Angeles Times, both albums [...] "created a revival for the bolero—the old-fashioned, string-based romantic messages of unrequited love were embraced even by young listeners". Ed Morales wrote in his book The Latin Beat: The Rhythms and Roots of Latin Music from Bossa Nova to Salsa and Beyond: [...] "Beyond merely being a revival, Romance and its 1994 follow-up, Segundo Romance was a significant update of the genre." [...] Chicago Tribune editor Achy Obejas noted that the albums [...] "scored in such unlikely places as Saudi Arabia and Finland". Segundo Romance was followed by two more bolero albums: Romances (1997) and Mis Romances (2001). In 1998, all three albums were compiled on Todos Los Romances, released by WEA Latina.|$|E

500|$|Washington, {{who was in}} 1789 {{elected the}} first president, resented Mason's strong stances against the {{ratification}} of the constitution, and these differences destroyed their friendship. Although some sources accept that Mason dined at Mount Vernon on November 2, 1788, Peter R. Henriques noted that Washington's diary states that Mr. George Mason was the guest, and as Washington, elsewhere in his diary, always referred to his former colleague at Philadelphia as Colonel Mason, the visitor was likely George Mason V, the son. Mason always wrote positively of Washington, and the president said nothing publicly, but in a letter referred to Mason as a [...] " [...] friend" [...] who would not recant {{his position on the}} constitution because [...] "pride on the one hand, and want of manly candour on the other, will not I am certain let him acknowledge error in his opinions respecting it [...] though conviction should flash on his mind <b>as</b> <b>strongly</b> <b>as</b> a ray of light".

500|$|... "I Care" [...] {{comprised}} 75 {{tracks in}} total: 35 {{for the music}} and 40 for the vocals. According to Swivel, the main challenge in mixing [...] "I Care" [...] was hand‑aligning every single drum shot as it was time-consuming. He said, [...] "It's super‑monotonous, but it's the best way I can do it. If you Beat Detective the drums to the grid, it's never perfect." [...] As the layering of the drums had to be right on the millisecond, Swivel did one kick and snare at a time. This helped him ensure that the kicks line up with the programmed drums, hence preventing any phase inversion. Accordingly, each drum punched through <b>as</b> <b>strongly</b> <b>as</b> the last. The inspiration for the main drum sound on [...] "I Care" [...] came to Swivel at around four {{o'clock in the morning}} during a mixing session. He took a large plate sound from Avid’s D‑Verb plug‑in, rolled the high frequencies off at 8.6kHz, and sent it through an SSL channel strip with a gate on it, setting the release time to 0.6 seconds. He said, [...] "It's a really basic plug‑in, and I used a very 80s‑sounding gated reverb." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Million Dollar Maybe" [...] {{was well}} {{received}} by television critics. Todd VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club gave the episode a 'B' grade, {{the highest of}} the night. VanDerWerff was polarized with the plot, opining that it was convoluted and stated, [...] "This was a completely stupid plot, but to the show's credit, it commented on this when Homer told Marge he won the lottery and she said she'd much rather have the money than the wedding reception performance he missed." [...] Similarly, VanDerWerff was split with the subplot of [...] "Million Dollar Maybe". In regards to the subplot, he wrote, [...] "The Lisa gets the old people a Wii stand-in plot {{was one of those}} ones where the Simpsons writers have obviously noticed something in pop culture but have yet to wholly grasp what it is or why it's important." [...] Robert Canning of IGN gave the episode an 8.1 out of 10, signifying a [...] "great" [...] rating. Canning felt that the episode was impressive, expressing that it was [...] "a fun and funny episode focused on Homer and his always dysfunctional relationship with his family [...] just what we've come to love and expect after 20 years." [...] Jason Hughes of [...] TV Squad gave the episode a more mixed review, praising the episode's humor, but calling it [...] "random". Hughes wrote, [...] "A lot about this episode bothered me, and I think The Simpsons has been having a pretty strong season for the most part." [...] He resumed, [...] "This one just didn't hold together <b>as</b> <b>strongly</b> <b>as</b> most of the prior ones." [...] He went on to criticize the character development of Ricardo, opining that it was a [...] "slap to the face to the winner." [...] He then commented: [...] "Peggy Black created Ricardo Bomba as a new ladies man type of figure, so the writers had him drive into a cliff wall and subsequent fiery explosion right away upon his first appearance. He didn't even get to finish what was, I guess, going to be his catchphrase." ...|$|E
