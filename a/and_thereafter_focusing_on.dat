40|$|Malignant {{mesothelioma}} is an asbestos induced {{cancer that}} is difficult to diagnose. Several studies have combined biomarkers to improve mesothelioma diagnosis, but with moderate success, and {{there is a need for}} new mesothelioma biomarkers. The tumour is often resistant to treatment and most patients will survive less than a year. An indicator of patient survival is the tumours growth pattern, which in turn is influenced by expressed proteoglycans. In this thesis work, we aim to improve the possibilities to diagnose malignant mesothelioma by combining biomarkers and by identifying new ones. We also investigate tumour driving mechanisms with focus on one of these suggested biomarkers, the cell-bound proteoglycan syndecan- 1. We were able to construct a diagnostic two-step model based on biomarkers in patient material. By implementing a cut-off level <b>and</b> <b>thereafter</b> <b>focusing</b> <b>on</b> unresolved patients we combined hyaluronan and N-ERC/mesothelin (paper I), which significantly increased the diagnostic accuracy for malignant mesothelioma. To further improve diagnosis, we used mass spectrometry to find new biomarkers. We identified and validated galectin- 1, which was excellent in discriminating mesotheliomas from adenocarcinomas (paper II). In the same study, we were also the first to describe aldo-keto reductase 1 B 10 as a novel prognostic mesothelioma biomarker. Syndecan- 1 has been indicated as a marker for carcinomas. In paper I we describe how higher levels of syndecan- 1 indicate the presence of a carcinoma over a mesothelioma. This was verified in paper II when syndecan- 1 was identified as downregulated in fluids from mesothelioma patients compared to lung cancer patients. Paper III and paper IV focus on this proteoglycan. 	Malignant cell lines transfected with syndecan- 1 and various truncated forms of syndecan- 1 affected adhesion and migration, which are key features of cancer invasion (paper III). The results showed a domain- and cell type specific effect on the cells’ motility. Regulating syndecan- 1 levels and analysing the global gene expression of mesothelioma cells made it evident that this proteoglycan has a strong influence on transforming growth factor β signalling and several growth factor pathways (paper IV). Links to cell migration and proliferation were furthermore identified, along with glycosaminoglycan modifying enzymes. These results can shed light on the complex role of syndecan- 1 in invasion and growth of malignant mesenchymal cells. Taken together, this thesis work describes a complement to conventional mesothelioma diagnosis and identifies novel biomarkers. Furthermore, the potential biomarker syndecan- 1 was shown to have an effect on cell motility and proliferation. These results increase our understanding of this aggressive malignancy...|$|E

40|$|Stereoscopic {{displays}} {{have been}} used in research as an aid for visualizations, but often they end up in a special room only to be used by a small selected audience. How should such a system be setup to make it more available to a larger group of users? We try to solve this by setting up the system in a regular lecture room, an environment already known by our users and by modifying software to make the transition from monoscopic displays to stereoscopic displays as smooth as possible. To improve the usability further, we choose to connect the stereoscopic installation to a high-performance computing (HPC) cluster. As a result, we offer our users to distribute their visualizations and by that the ability to use larger data sets. There are two goals for this master thesis. The first goal is to setup a stereoscopic display in a regular class room environment. The second goal is to enable distributed visualization at our graphics lab and evaluate further development in this field. The first goal is accomplished by setting up the hardware <b>and</b> <b>thereafter</b> <b>focus</b> <b>on</b> making the system more usable. Three different ways will be presented, one by using the Visualization Toolkit (VTK), another by developing a small C++ library for converting existing visualizations to the stereoscopic display. And the final option is non-invasive stereoscopic visualization with the Chromium library. The second goal is realized by installing and configuring ParaView, a visualization application for distributedvisualizations on a cluster connected to the stereoscopic display. Exploration ofalternative ways of performing visualization on the Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) is also concluded. The result of this master thesis work is primarily a lecture room that in {{a matter of a few}} minutes is turned into a visualization studio with a stereoscopic display for up to 30 simultaneous viewers. The result is also an extended version of VTK for our stereoscopic display, a C++ library meant to help users to port their program for stereoscopic visualization and some examples on how to use Chromium for noninvasive stereoscopic rendering. Furthermore, we have made ParaView available to HPC users by installing and configuring it on one of UPPMAX clusters...|$|R

That means, what is the "correct" expression for electromagnetic momentum density in continuous matter. In our opinion one sees relatively often that authors over-interpret the importance of their experimental findings with respect to the momentum problem. Most of these experiments are actually unable to discriminate between these energy-momentum tensors at all, since they can be easily described in terms of force expressions that are common for Abraham and Minkowski. Moreover, we emphasize the inherent ambiguity in applying formal conservation principles to the radiation field in a dielectric, the reason being that the electromagnetic field in matter is only a subsystem which has to be supplemented by the mechanical subsystem to be closed. Finally, we make some suggestions regarding the connection between macroscopic electrodynamics and the Casimir effect, suggesting that there is a limit for the magnitudes of cutoff parameters in QFT related to surface tension in ordinary hydromechanics.

40|$|Algebraic {{equations}} {{and functions}} {{play an important}} role in various mathematical topics, including algebra, trigonometry, linear programming and calculus. Accordingly, various documents, such as the most recent Swedish curriculum (Lpf 94) for upper secondary school and the course syllabi in mathematics, specify what the students should learn in Mathematics Course B. They should be able to solve quadratic equations and apply this knowledge in solving problems, explain the properties of a function, as well as be able to set up, interpret and use some nonlinear functions as models for real processes. To implement these recommendations, it is crucial to understand the students’ way of experiencing quadratic equations and functions, and describe the meaning these have for the students in relation to the possibility they have to their experience of them. The aim of this thesis is to analyse, understand and explain the relation between the handled and learned content, which consists of second-degree equations and quadratic functions, in classroom practice. This means that content is the research object and not the teacher’s conceptions or knowledge of, or about this content. This restriction implies that the handled and learned contents are central in this study and will be analysed from different perspectives. The study includes two teachers and 45 students in two different classes. The data consist of video-recordings of lessons, individual sessions, interviews and the teachers’/researcher’s review of the individual sessions. The students’ tests also constituted an important part of the data collection. When analysing the data, concepts relating to variation theory have been used as analytical tools. Data have been analysed in respect of the teachers’ <b>focus</b> <b>on</b> the lesson content, which aspects are ignored and which patterns of dimensions of variations are constituted when the contents are handled by the teachers in the classroom. Also, data have been analysed in respect of the students’ focus when they solve different exercises in a test situation. It can be shown that the meaning of parameters, the unknown quantity in an equation and the function’s argument change several times when the teacher presents the content in the classroom and when the students solve different exercises. It can also be shown that the teachers and the students develop complicated patterns of variation during the lessons and that the ways in which the teachers open up dimensions of variation {{play an important role}} in the learning process. The results indicate that there is a convergent variation leading the students to improve their learning. By <b>focusing</b> <b>on</b> some aspects of the objects of learning and create convergent variations, it is possible for the students to understand the difference between various interpretations of these aspects <b>and</b> <b>thereafter</b> <b>focus</b> <b>on</b> the interpretation that fits in a certain context. Furthermore, this variation leads the students to make generalisations in each object of learning (equations and functions) and between these objects of learning. These generalisations remain over time, despite working with new objects of learning. An important result in this study is that the implicit or explicit arguments of a function can make it possible to discern an equation from a function despite the fact that they are constituted by the same algebraic expression...|$|R

40|$|AbstractIn {{recent years}} new {{information}} clarified our {{ideas on the}} pathophysiology of the nephropathy in sickle cell anemia (SCA). Whereas the medullary vascular pathology with its subsequent disturbances in renal concentrating and acidifying capacity are well documented [1 – 4], in recent years more {{attention has been given}} to the changes in cortical functions. Not only did renal blood flow and glomerular filtration rate (GFR) appear to be elevated, but proximal tubular activity, both reabsorptive and secretory, also were found to be increased. Arguments suggest that this hyperfiltration with increased proximal tubular activity is secondary to the medullary changes and mediated by abnormalities in renal vasoactive substances. AbstractSickle cell nephropathy thus is no longer confined to the medullary changes per se; it extends to a more complex entity with changes in cortical functions which compensate for a defective water and sodium conservation in the medulla.

50|$|The {{original}} {{idea for the}} Fantasy Flight Games company came from Petersen's love of European comics, and by negotiating with European publishers Petersen {{came up with the}} rights to three comic books: Lucky Luke, Spirou & Fantasio and Percevan. He started off publishing the comics he had licensed, and when he found out that people wanted more popular European comics like Asterix and Tintin, he started importing and distributing those and when he discovered that people were interested in him distributing even more books, he started doing that too, creating Downtown Distribution. From reading Comics & Games Retailer, Petersen had good data about the gaming field available to him, so, combining this with his Danish gaming expertise, Petersen started getting into game publication by designing Twilight Imperium (1997). Fantasy Flight Publishing became known as Fantasy Flight Games (FFG), and by early 1998 Fantasy Flight sold off Downtown Distribution - which represented the last remnant of its comic business - <b>and</b> <b>thereafter</b> <b>focused</b> almost entirely <b>on</b> the gaming market.

One of the most popular renewable energy systems over the past decade has been the wind turbine. Technological advances in modeling, prediction, sensing and control combined with the current shift towards decentralized power have prompted development of wind energy systems. Decentralized distribution allows for lower transmission losses because of the closer proximity to the consumer and greater regional control. The wind turbine has positioned itself as the leading energy system to serve as a cornerstone in the development of decentralized energy distribution. This research <b>focuses</b> <b>on</b> the development of a nonlinear dynamic model of a variable speed wind turbine. The modeling effort is followed by model validation against published data. Subsequently, benchmark control problems and existing control strategies are reviewed from literature. Emphasis is placed on variable speed form of operation. Control strategies are studied for two different operating modes of a wind turbine, namely operations below and above the rated-speed.

The purpose is to explore how do interpersonal relationships develop in terms of characteristics of virtuality {{and if there is}} any influence of project lifespan on {{the development of}} these relationships. Since relationships are dynamic in nature and are influenced by multiple levels of variables including individual, group and organizational level, therefore characteristics of virtuality have been considered from all these aspects so as to study their influence on development of relationships. In this study, relationships have been studied at two different levels. At first, dyadic relationships between two members of a GVT have been analyzed <b>and</b> <b>thereafter,</b> <b>focus</b> has been <b>on</b> the development of relationships among the team, based on these dyads. Characteristics having influence on development of relationships include trust, physical distance, time zone difference, cultural and language differences, level of formalization in the organization and means of communication used by team members. Level of formalization and means of communication are two characteristics which emerged after empirical study and are found to have direct influence on development of relationships. Remaining characteristics have been identified through literature review. In order to conduct the study, qualitative methodology has been applied. Empirical data has been collected based on a single case study while using semi-structured interviews as data gathering technique. Data analysis has been performed by applying thematic analysis along with the utilization of company documents such as work sheets, minutes of meetings and recordings of conferences. Findings of the study indicate that development of relationships, both at dyadic level and team level, is influenced by different events taking place among different members of GVT. These events have either positive or negative influence on the characteristics of virtuality, which leads to development of the relationships. It has been found that, trust, among all factors plays a greater role in development of these relations. Contrary to the belief that most conflicts arise among members of different cultures, they are equally likely to happen among the members from same culture in GVT environment. Study suggests that relationship development is not a smooth process but it fluctuates based on different events in teams. For further research, teams within large firms shall be studied along these lines. This study is an early attempt towards bringing different characteristics of virtuality together which previously, have been studied individually. It is therefore plausible to conduct similar studies so as to generalize {{the findings of this study}} which has provided a starting point...|$|R
40|$|The {{sustainability}} {{policies and}} studies {{during the last}} few decades have primarily <b>focused</b> <b>on</b> the environmental and economic aspects, leaving social sustainability relatively underexposed. So far, impeded by the lack of theorization, integrative conceptual framework, proper contextualization, and evidence-based knowledge, our understandings of the concept of social sustainability are still fuzzy and limited (Colantonio, 2011; Åhman, 2013; Littig and Griessler, 2005). In addition, {{as one of the most}} significant social transformations of the twenty-first century, population ageing has brought challenges for nearly all sectors of urban societies and is becoming increasingly of relevance to the social sustainability of cities. A particular emphasis of social sustainability on the ageing population in cities is badly needed. This research aims to better understand conceptually the meaning of social sustainability in ageing societies, particularly within the Chinese context, and to investigate empirically the influences of urban environmental, geographical and other contextual factors on social sustainability of elderly population in the city of Shanghai. Firstly, this research proposes an integrative conceptual framework of social sustainability that includes three key components (i. e., well-being, social justice and context), taking in particular the Chinese contextual interpretations and elderly population into account. Well-being, social justice and context show respectively what are important for a good life, how to distribute those important goods fairly among people, and the socio-cultural (Confucianism and Collectivism), institutional (Hukou system), demographic (ageing population) and geographic (Asian and Eastern) contexts that influence well-being <b>and</b> justice interpretations. <b>Thereafter,</b> <b>focusing</b> <b>on</b> well-being, social justice and context, this research provides empirical evidences to show that, hindered by Hukou’s institutional constraints, the migrant elderly people in central Shanghai in 2000 were residentially segregated from the local elderly people. Such residential segregation produced evident inequality in well-being, making migrant elderly people more disadvantaged in their urban life. During the period 2000 - 2010, the persistence of Hukou’s institutional constraints along with the intensified differentiations of housing price and new housing distribution had further slightly strengthened the residential segregation between local and migrant elderly people, which continuingly produced inequality in their well-being distribution. Furthermore, this research investigates specifically the well-being effects of urban residential environments and individual resources. Several residential environmental factors (e. g., good quality residential building, good accessibility to medical and financial facilities, higher economic status of a neighbourhood, and a lower proportion of older adults in a neighbourhood) and individual factors (e. g., health and household income) are found to be important correlates of the subjective well-being of older adults in Shanghai. Health, as the most significant individual factor for older adults’ subjective well-being, is also significantly influenced by the urban residential environments. This research shows that the residential environment affects older adults’ health directly, but also indirectly through a series of significant behavioral (physical and social activities) and perceptual (subjective well-being) factors. Urban residential environments such as good housing and neighborhood quality and a safe social environment exert significant positive total effects on older adults’ subjective, physical and mental health conditions...|$|R
