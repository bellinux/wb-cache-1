40|$|The {{aim of this}} retrospective, {{cross-sectional}} study was to assess whether mild and severe Class II division 1 subjects have craniofacial and upper airway characteristics, which relate to the severity of Class II as judged by overjet or ANB angle. The sample consisted of pre-treatment lateral cephalograms and dental casts of 131 males and 115 females (mean age 10. 4 ± 1. 6). Inclusion criteria were: healthy Caucasian subjects, at least &frac 34; Class II first molar relationship {{on both sides and}} overjet ≥ 4 mm. The cephalograms were traced and digitized. Distances and angular values were computed. Mild and severe Class II was defined by overjet (< 10 mm/≥ 10 mm) or by ANB angle (< 7 degrees/≥ 7 degrees). Statistics were performed with two-sample t-test and Pearson's correlation analysis. In the two overjet groups, significant differences were mainly found for incisor inclination while the two ANB groups differed significantly in SNA, WITS, Go-Pg, SpaSpp/MGo, SN/MGo, and Ar-Gn. The shortest <b>airway</b> <b>distance</b> between the soft palate and the posterior pharyngeal wall was significantly correlated to the NS/Ar angle. Statistical analysis revealed several significant correlations. Patients with a large overjet or ANB angle differed significantly from patients with a small overjet or ANB angle mainly in their incisor inclination. In the present sample, the overjet and to some extent also the ANB angle is determined by soft tissue or individual tooth position rather than by skeletal background. In retrognathic patients, a tendency towards smaller airway dimensions was found. However, statistical analysis did not reveal a strong connection between upper airway and dentoskeletal parameters, but a large interindividual variation...|$|E
40|$|Objective: To {{predict the}} proper depth of {{placement}} of endotracheal tubes, oral and nasal. Material and Method: This was a prospective study of 100 patients who underwent general anesthesia with oral endotracheal intubation. The cuff of the endotracheal tube was placed 2 cm below the vocal cords. The {{positions of the}} endotracheal tube tip and the <b>airway</b> <b>distances</b> of the patients were measured by fiberoptic bronchoscope; OC = {{the distance from the}} right upper canine to the vocal cords, NC = the distance from the right external naris to the vocal cords and T = the distance from the vocal cords to the carina. The correlation between the <b>airway</b> <b>distances</b> and patient’s factors were analyzed. The proper depth of placement of the endotracheal tube was calculated with the formula OTT = OC+T- 2, nasal endotracheal tube NTT = NC+T- 2. Results: The mean distance from the endotracheal tube tip to the carina was 3. 0 + 1. 48 cm (ranged 0. 7 - 7. 5 cm). The distance from the endotracheal tube tip to the carina of 86 from 100 patients was more than 2 cm. The mean OC was 9. 79 + 1. 27 cm. The mean NC was 15. 00 + 0. 84 cm. The mean T were 13. 03 + 1. 48 cm in males and 11. 63 + 1. 25 cm in females and it also related to the height of the person (Pearson correlation = 0. 557, p value < 0. 05). These distances did not relate to gender. Conclusion: The predicted formula of the depth of the endotracheal tube as “Chula formula”; OTT = 4 + (Ht/ 10) cm (The distance from the right upper canine to the point which is 2 cm above the carina) NTT = 9 + (Ht/ 10) cm (The distance from the right external naris to the point which is 2 cm above the carina...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: Bronchoscopic {{evaluation}} of stenosis is limited due to radial distortion of bronchoscopic images and the unknown {{distance between the}} endoscope and the stenotic area. The {{purpose of this study}} was the development and validation of a method for measuring cross-sectional areas in large <b>airways.</b> <b>Distance</b> measurements were performed using a laser probe inserted into the working channel of a bronchoscope. The laser probe was positioned to the locus of interest in the airway, a ring of light (helium/neon) projected on to the luminal wall and the images acquired using an electronic bronchoscope. The images taken were distortion-corrected by means of a computer program. The method was validated by simulating airways using tubes of known diameter. Additionally, distortion-corrected bronchoscopic images were compared with distortion-free videoscopic image analysis of tracheal slices taken from pigs. In the case of the plastic tubes, Pearson's correlation coefficient (r) as well as the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) were slightly higher (r= 0. 99, p< 0. 01, ICC= 0. 97) than the correlation of cross-sectional areas between bronchoscopic and videoscopic images of tracheal slices (r= 0. 88, p< 0. 01, ICC= 0. 87). This concept allows accurate and reproducible determination of cross-sectional areas in large airways...|$|R
40|$|Background: Optimal {{depth of}} endotracheal tube (ET) {{placement}} {{has been a}} serious concern because of the complications associated with its malposition. Aims: To find the optimal depth of placement of oral ET in Indian adult patients and its possible determinants viz. height, weight, arm span and vertebral column length. Settings and Design: This {{study was conducted in}} 200 ASA I and II patients requiring general anaesthesia and orotracheal intubation. Methods: After placing the ET with the designated black mark at vocal cords, various <b>airway</b> <b>distances</b> were measured from the right angle of mouth using a fibre optic bronchoscope. Statistical Analysis: The power of the study is 0. 9. Mean (SD) and median (range) of various parameters and Pearson correlation coefficient was calculated. Results: The mean (SD) lip-carina distance, i. e., total airway length was 24. 32 (1. 81)  cm and 21. 62 (1. 34)  cm in males and females, respectively. With black mark of ET between vocal cords, the mean (SD) ET tip-carina distance of 3. 69 (1. 65)  cm in males and 2. 28 (1. 55)  cm females was found to be considerably less than the recommended safe distance. Conclusions: Fixing the tube at recommended 23  cm in males and 21  cm in females will lead to carinal stimulation or endobronchial placement in many Indian patients. The lip to carina distance best correlates with patient′s height. Positioning the ET tip 4  cm above carina as recommended will result in placement of tube cuff inside cricoid ring with currently available tubes. Optimal depth of ET placement can be estimated by the formula "(Height in cm/ 7) - 2. 5. ...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: The {{hyoid bone}} and its {{relation}} with the pharyngeal space in health and disease has been an intriguing subject for years. Aim: This study attempts to evaluate the hyoid bone position and to ascertain any correlations with pharyngeal airway space in skeletal class I, II, and III malocclusions. Materials and Methods: McNamara′s airway analysis was carried out to assess {{the upper and lower}} airway widths and Hyoid triangle analysis by Bibby and Preston was carried out to determine the position of the hyoid bone.

40|$|OBJECTIVE:The aim was {{to assess}} {{pharyngeal}} airway dimensions and physiological changes based on lateral cephalometric radiographs from healthy untreated children aged 6 - 17 years. MATERIALS/METHODS:The sample consisted of 880 lateral cephalograms (412 females and 468 males) of the Zurich Craniofacial Growth Study. Statistical analyses on cephalometric measurements of <b>airway</b> dimensions (<b>distances</b> 'p': shortest distance between soft palate and posterior pharyngeal wall and 't': shortest distance between tongue and posterior pharyngeal wall) and craniofacial parameters were performed. To disclose differences between different age groups, a Kruskal-Wallis test was applied. The influence of gender on 'p' and 't' was analysed by a Mann-Whitney U-test for each age group separately. The Spearman correlation was computed in order to investigate associations between craniofacial parameters. Variables associated with 'p' and 't' were chosen for multiple regression model investigation. RESULTS:The results demonstrated high interindividual variations. A slight influence of age on 'p' (P = 0. 034) could be attested (+ 1. 03 mm) but not on 't' (P = 0. 208). With {{the exception of the}} 9 -year age group, {{no significant differences between the}} genders were found. Correlation analysis revealed several statistically significant correlations between 't' or 'p' and antero-posterior cephalometric variables. All correlation coefficients were, however, very low and the adjusted coefficient of determination also revealed the regression model to be very weak. CONCLUSIONS:The high interindividual variations of 'p' and 't' render the use of reference values problematic. Contrary to other craniofacial structures, neither age-related changes nor sexual dimorphism were found for 'p' and 't'. Any associations to antero-posterior cephalometric characteristics seem low...|$|R
40|$|Background and Objectives: The {{purpose of}} this study was to assess {{correlation}} between craniofacial morphology and oropharynx, genderwise variation of the oropharynx to craniofacial morphology and to assess the average width of oropharynx in Skeletal Class II patients in the age group of 10 - 13 years. Methods: Lateral cephalograms of 100 patients with Skeletal Class II malocclusion were obtained from the archives of M. S. Ramaiah Dental College and hospital, Bangalore. The pre-treatment radiographs were taken from the cephalostat (Planmeca 2002 cc Proline Panoramic unit) under standardized conditions with patient′s Frankfurt plane oriented parallel to floor. Results: When all the angular and linear craniofacial variables were compared between males and females, no significant difference was found between both the sexes. Among the angular variables cranial base angle (NSBa) was found to have negative correlation with lower <b>airway.</b> Linear <b>distance</b> between sella to nasion, nasion to basion, 3 rd cervical vertebrae to hyoid bone, 2 nd cervical vertebrae to hyoid bone, mandibular length (Go-Me), perpendicular distance from nasion to maxillary plane, menton to maxillary plane, gonion to maxillary plane, basion to point A showed moderate correlation with lower airway. Significant positive correlation was found between age, linear distance from sella to nasion, third cervical vertebrae to hyoid, 2 nd cervical vertebrae to hyoid, gonion to menton, perpendicular distance from menton to maxillary plane, sella to maxillary plane, wits appraisal (AO-BO) and upper airway. Interpretation and Conclusion: The present study concluded that there was no significant variation between different sexes. The study also concluded that there was a significant correlation between craniofacial morphology and oropharyngeal airway. The average width of the lower airway was found to be 10. 42 mm SD - 3. 459) and upper airway was 11. 73 mm (SD - 3. 467) in skeletal class II patients in the age group of 10 - 13 yrs...|$|R
40|$|Aims: To {{evaluate}} the diagnostic utility of virtual bronchoscopy, multiplanar reformatted images, and minimal-intensity projection in assessing airway stenoses. Settings and Design: It was a prospective study involving 150 patients with symptoms of major airway disease. Materials and Methods: Fifty-six patients {{were selected for}} analysis based on the detection of major airway lesions on fiber-optic bronchoscopy (FB) or routine axial images. Comparisons were made between axial images, virtual bronchoscopy (VB), minimal-intensity projection (minIP), and multiplanar reformatted (MPR) images using FB as the gold standard. Lesions were evaluated in terms of degree of <b>airway</b> narrowing, <b>distance</b> from carina, length of the narrowed segment and visualization of airway distal to the lesion. Results: MPR images had the highest degree of agreement with FB (Κ = 0. 76) in the depiction of degree of narrowing. minIP had the least degree of agreement with FB (Κ = 0. 51) in this regard. The distal visualization was best on MPR images (84. 2 %), followed by axial images (80. 7 %), whereas FB could visualize the lesions only in 45. 4 % of the cases. VB had the best agreement with FB in assessing the segment length (Κ = 0. 62). Overall there were {{no statistically significant differences}} in the measurement of the distance from the carina in the axial, minIP, and MPR images. MPR images had the highest overall degree of confidence, namely, 70. 17 % (n = 40). Conclusion: Three-dimensional reconstruction techniques were found to improve lesion evaluation compared with axial images alone. The technique of MPR images was the most useful for lesion evaluation and provided additional information useful for surgical and airway interventions in tracheobronchial stenosis. minIP was useful in the overall depiction of airway anatomy...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Difficult airway {{especially}} failed intubation {{has been}} associated with a high incidence of mortality and morbidity. Most of mortalities occur when an anaesthesiologist encounters an unanticipated difficult airway. Findings In 1999, a 23 yr. old, 65 kg weight and 170 cm height female patient had been scheduled for arthroscopy. Despite totally normal <b>airway</b> assessment (thyromental <b>distance,</b> mouth opening, jaw and neck movement [...] .) I was astonished by encountering a grade IV Cormack - Lehane laryngoscopic view. Tracheal intubation was impossible and ventilation was very difficult. On attempt to attain a better laryngoscopic view, while manipulating submandibular region I encountered a bulky noncompliant submental space (Submental Sign). This event made me more alert regarding this finding. Thereafter I noted for this sign throughout the past years and I found it very helpful. These findings encouraged me to write this report, and suggest a routine examination of submental space {{in order to keep the}} safety of the patient at the heart of the care we provide. Conclusion Evaluation of the submental space is suggested as an alternative predictor of difficult airway and routine examination of the submental space is of value in airway assessment. </p...|$|R
40|$|For {{patients}} with suspicious lung lesions found on chest x-ray or CT, endo/trans- bronchial biopsy of the lung {{is the preferred}} method for obtaining a diagnosis. With the addition of new screening programs, a higher number of patients will require diagnostic biopsy which will prove even more challenging due to {{the small size of}} lesions found with screening. There are many endobronchial tools available on the market today and a wide range of new tools under investigation to improve diagnostic yield. However, there is little information available about the optimal tool size required to reach the majority of lesions, especially peripheral ones. In this manuscript we investigate the percentage of lesions that can be reached for various diameter tools if the tools remain inside the airways (i. e. endobronchial biopsy) and the distance a tool must travel "off-road" (or outside of the airways) to reach all lesions. To further understand the distribution of lung lesions with respect to <b>airway</b> sizes and <b>distances</b> from the <b>airways,</b> six 3 D models of the lung were generated. The airways were modeled at two different respiratory phases (inspiration and expiration). Three sets of 1, 000 lesions were randomly distributed throughout the lung for each respiratory phase. The simulations showed that the percentage of reachable lesions decreases with increasing tool diameter and decreasing lesion diameter. A 1 mm diameter tool will reach < 25 % of 1 cm lesions if it remains inside the airways. To reach all 1 cm lesions this 1 mm tool would have to navigate through the parenchyma up to 8. 5 mm. CT scans of 21 patient lesions confirm these results reasonably well. The smaller the tool diameter the more likely {{it will be able to}} reach a lung lesion, whether it be for diagnostic biopsy, ablation, or resection. However, even a 1 mm tool is not small enough to reach the majority of small (1 - 2 cm) lesions. Therefore, it is necessary for endobronchial tools to be able to navigate through the parenchyma to reach the majority of lesions...|$|R
