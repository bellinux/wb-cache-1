40|$|Abstract. The {{purpose of}} this paper is to address the {{strategic}} <b>and</b> <b>tactic</b> issues in agent communication. Strategic reasoning enables agents to decide about the global communication plan in terms of the macroactions to perform in order to achieve the main conversational goal. Tactic reasoning, on the other hand, allows agents to locally select, at each moment, the most appropriate argument according to the adopted strategy. Previous efforts at defining and formalizing strategies for argumentative agents have often neglected the <b>tactic</b> level <b>and</b> the relation between strategic <b>and</b> <b>tactic</b> levels. In this paper, we propose a formal framework for strategic <b>and</b> <b>tactic</b> reasoning for rational communicating agents and the relation between these two kinds of reasoning. This framework is based on our social commitment and argument approach for agent communication. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. In this paper, {{we propose}} a new {{strategic}} <b>and</b> <b>tactic</b> reasoning for agent communication. This reasoning framework is specified using argumentation theory combined to a relevance theory. Strategic reasoning enables agents to decide about the global communication plan {{in terms of}} the macro-actions to perform in order to achieve the main conversational goal. Tactic reasoning, on the other hand, allows agents to locally select, at each moment, the most appropriate argument according to the adopted strategy. Previous efforts at defining and formalizing strategies for argumentative agents have often neglected the <b>tactic</b> level <b>and</b> the relation between strategic <b>and</b> <b>tactic</b> levels. In this paper, we propose a formal framework for strategic <b>and</b> <b>tactic</b> reasoning for rational communicating agents and the relation between these two kinds of reasoning. Furthermore, we address the computational complexity of this framework and we argue that this complexity is in the same level of the polynomial hierarchy than the complexity of the strategic-free argumentation reasoning. ...|$|R

5|$|Allardyce {{wrote to}} every {{club in the}} top two {{divisions}} to inform them he was available on a free transfer, and privately lamented choosing his past clubs for financial rather than footballing reasons. Over the summer he played 11 games in the North American Soccer League for the Tampa Bay Rowdies, a club that shared facilities with the NFL's Tampa Bay Buccaneers. Allardyce subsequently applied in his managerial career many modern practices of American football with regards to training, player management <b>and</b> <b>tactics.</b> He found playing difficult however, due to {{the heat and the}} all-out attacking nature of his teammates, which led to him being frequently exposed at the back, though he found that the club's masseurs managed to cure a long-standing hamstring scar tissue problem.|$|E
40|$|Studying power <b>and</b> {{influence}} <b>tactics</b> <b>and</b> {{the contexts}} {{in which they are}} used in program planning can advance understanding of establishing continuing professional education (CPE) programs. Researchers (Caffarella, 2002; Cervero & Wilson, 1994; Yang, et al 1998) have primarily focused on power <b>and</b> influence <b>tactics</b> used by adult educators (Caffarella, 2002; Cervero & Wilson, 1994; Yang et al, 1998). This case focuses on identifying and measuring the power <b>and</b> influence <b>tactics</b> {{in the context of an}} organization deciding whether or not to establish a CPE program. The author uses the samples of positive and influences (Caffarella, 2002), and Power <b>and</b> Influence <b>Tactics</b> Scale (POINTS), (Yang,Cervero, Valentine, & Benson, 1998) to identify <b>and</b> measure the <b>tactics</b> that were used to ensure establishment of a CPE program. The findings lend support to the planning theory offered by Cervero and Wilson (1994) in that “planning practice is a social process of negotiating personal and organizational interests in contexts of structured power relations” (p. 253) ...|$|R

5|$|American {{officers}} serving under Pulaski {{had difficulty}} taking orders from a foreigner who could scarcely speak English and whose ideas of discipline <b>and</b> <b>tactics</b> differed enormously from those {{to which they}} were accustomed. This resulted in friction between the Americans and Pulaski and his fellow Polish officers. There was also discontent in the unit over delays in pay, and Pulaski's imperious personality was a regular source of discontent among his peers, superiors, and subordinates. Pulaski was also unhappy that his suggestion to create a lancer unit was denied. Despite a commendation from Wayne, these circumstances prompted Pulaski to resign his general command in March 1778, and return to Valley Forge.|$|E

From 1885 to 1890, Lt. Herbert C. Squires—a veteran of the 7th U.S. Cavalry—built a cadet battalion to a strength of 200, which would provide the foundation for the modern ROTC unit at Fordham. The college built a science building in 1886, lending more legitimacy to science in the curriculum. In addition, a three-year Bachelor of Science degree was created. In 1897, academic regalia for students at commencement was first adopted.|$|E
