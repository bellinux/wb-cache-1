40|$|Nanoscience is {{the area}} of science {{concerning}} materials {{on the level of}} nanometer scale. Currently much of the discussion of nanoscience is focused on carbon-based nanostructures. Tremendous studies have been carried out on fullerenes and carbon nanotubes in the past <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>decade</b> due to their unique chemical and physical properties. This thesis studies the chemistry of the other two novel nanostructures in the carbon family: nanodiamond and carbon nano-onions. Nanodiamond is relatively a new engineering material with particular applications for fabrication of wear-resistant surface coatings, lubricating films and prototypes field emission displays. These materials are also of interest for studies of chemical reactivity stemming from their nanoscale particle sizes. The surface fluorination of nanodiamond at various temperatures yields a fluoro-nanodiamond with up to 8. 6 at. % fluorine content. The fluoro-nanodiamond was used as a precursor for preparation of the series of functionalized nanodiamonds by subsequent reactions with alkyllithium reagents, diamines, and amino acids. The fluoro-nanodiamond and all derivatives were characterized by SEM, TEM, XRD, TG-MS, FTIR, XPS, and Raman measurements. In comparison with the pristine nanodiamond, all functionalized nanodiamonds show an improved solubility in polar organic solvents, e. g., alcohols and THF, and a reduced particle agglomeration. The fluoro-nanodiamond powder was also used as a precursor for diamond coating on solid substrate surface e. g. glass. This novel approach is based on the wet chemistry process (solution reaction) occurring at low temperature and resulting in a covalent bonding of tiny nanodiamond crystals to substrate through a molecular linker, 3 -aminopropyltriethoxysilane (APTES). SEM, AFM and XPS were used for evaluation of surface morphology and elemental analysis to confirm the presence of diamond particles on surface. Carbon nano-onion studied in this thesis is another new material synthesized by our collaborators. The layer-by-layer structures make it a potential candidate as lubricant materials. The nano-onions were fluorinated at various temperatures resulting in fluoro-onions with different fluorine content. The inside layered structures are damaged due to fluorination, which was characterized by Raman, XRD, TEM et al. Defluorination treatment was also performed.

The typical life cycle of a logging town in the late 19 th and early 20 th centuries involved a miniature population boom as the mills came followed by up to <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>decades</b> <b>of</b> furious logging and prosperity (depending {{on the size of the}} forested areas nearby). Usually, though, after the logging industry would leave as abruptly as it came once the trees thinned out, leaving these towns devoid of an economic function; there was little the towns could do to survive and they often vanished. The analysis in this paper focuses primarily on the economic (side industries such as a tannery, metal works, and shoe company) and social developments (largely through city planning efforts) that took place in the city of Tomahawk between 1886 and the end of the Second World War, proposing that the evolution that occurred during this time period enabled the city to survive and prosper long after the bulk of the saw and paper mills had left the area...|$|R

40|$|This {{thesis is}} about the {{theology}} of the leader of Anglican evangelicalism, John Stott. Throughout this study of evangelical identity, the relationship between the objective belief and the subjective experience is a main thread. An attempt at definition of the Anglican evangelicalism: Theologically, evangelicalism means that the bibliology and the doctrine of salvation have been in the foreground. Evangelical belief is moving between a doctrinal and an experiential pole, but also between a conservative and a liberal pole. The message of salvation: The issue of salvation plays a central role in Stott’s theology. The foundation for his soteriology is Christology. This summarises the objective and the subjective. Our investigation has shown that Christ’s resurrection is, for John Stott, a bridge between the objective and the subjective. In the subjective experience there is an objective element, since the faith is centered on what Christ has done. His interpretation of the atonement stresses the objective, that is, it places salvation in history, outside of man’s subjective experience. Actually, Stott sees three steps – an objective, historical event, described in the Bible, to be experienced today. The authority of the message of salvation: For Stott the revelation has a cognitive side. The Bible records historical events, but it also gives them a divine interpretation. Stott does not accept a situation where a matter will be seen as true in a religious experience, but as false in an objective reality. For Stott, God revealed in Christ is the supreme authority. The Bible should therefore be read for the purpose of salvation and with Christ as a hermeneutic principle. Stott’s bibliology is by himself described as established with belief in Christ as a presupposition. The message of salvation contextualized: Stott wishes to combine the objective and the subjective interpretation in order to achieve a better contextualization but throughout all of this thesis it is made evident that Stott’s view on subjectivity is rather cautious and guarded. He refuses to accept that the Bible is defined, in an absolute way, by culture in its contents and its truth. Stott’s intention has been to point to the constant factor in the teaching of the Bible. It is quite clear that Stott does not deviate from the view that the content of the evangelical doctrine is an obligation. A critical evangelical perspective on the theology of John Stott: For Stott, faith is not only belief in the Bible, but also trust in the Saviour. However, the criterion of truth in its modernistic form brought Stott to a rational theology that {{did not want to see}} Christian theology as a subjective undertaking, but as being founded in an objective, historical belief. In the final chapter Stott’s theological inheritance has been assessed and criticised from the point of view of a rising evangelical and pentecostal theology that more manifestly seeks integration. The difference is that Stott has been influenced by the dualistic view of modernity, while the integrative theology attempts to assert evangelical interests in the face of post-modernism. By evangelical standards, Stott was a competent theologian during <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> crucial <b>decades.</b> He tried to attain sensitivity for certain complicated sections in theology, and he also emphasised the rational feature. However, Stott was not capable of, or interested in, leading evangelical theology into altered cultural and theological circumstances...|$|R
