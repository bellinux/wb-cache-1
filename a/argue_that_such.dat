5|$|Bina Agarwal and Pradeep Panda {{illustrate}} that a woman's property status (such as owning {{a house or}} land) directly and significantly reduces her chances of experiencing domestic violence, while employment makes little difference. They <b>argue</b> <b>that</b> <b>such</b> immovable property increases women's self-esteem, economic security, and strengthens their fall-back positions, enhancing their options and bargaining clout. They show that property ownership is an important contributor to women's economic well-being because it reduces their susceptibility to violence.|$|E
5|$|For example, Bina Agarwal {{and others}} have critiqued the {{mainstream}} model and helped provide {{a better understanding of}} intra-household bargaining power. Agarwal shows that a lack of power and outside options for women hinders their ability to negotiate within their families. Amartya Sen shows how social norms that devalue women's unpaid work in the household often disadvantage women in intra-household bargaining. These feminist economists <b>argue</b> <b>that</b> <b>such</b> claims have important economic outcomes which must be recognized within economic frameworks.|$|E
5|$|Margunn Bjørnholt and Ailsa McKay {{argue that}} the {{financial}} crisis of 2007–08 and the response to it revealed a crisis of ideas in mainstream economics and within the economics profession, and call for a reshaping of both the economy, economic theory and the economics profession. They <b>argue</b> <b>that</b> <b>such</b> a reshaping should include new advances within feminist economics that take as their starting point the socially responsible, sensible and accountable subject in creating an economy and economic theories that fully acknowledge care for each other {{as well as the}} planet.|$|E

5|$|The Chicxulub Crater lends {{support to}} the theory {{postulated}} by the late physicist Luis Alvarez and his son, geologist Walter Alvarez, that the extinction of numerous animal and plant groups, including non-avian dinosaurs, may have resulted from a bolide impact (the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event). Luis and Walter Alvarez, at the time both faculty members at the University of California, Berkeley, postulated that this enormous extinction event, which was roughly contemporaneous with the postulated date of formation for the Chicxulub crater, could {{have been caused by}} just such a large impact. The age of the rocks marked by the impact shows that this impact structure dates from roughly 66 million years ago, the end of the Cretaceous period, and the start of the Paleogene period. It coincides with the K–Pg boundary, the geological boundary between the Cretaceous and Paleogene. The impact associated with the crater is thus implicated in the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event, including the worldwide extinction of non-avian dinosaurs. This conclusion has been the source of controversy. In March 2010, 41 experts from many countries reviewed the available evidence: 20 years' worth of data spanning a variety of fields. They concluded that the impact at Chicxulub triggered the mass extinctions at the K–Pg boundary. In 2013 a study compared isotopes in impact glass from the Chicxulub impact with the same isotopes in ash from the boundary where the extinction event occurred in the fossil record; the study concluded that the impact glasses were dated at 66.038 ± 0.049 Ma, and the deposits immediately above the discontinuity in the geological and fossil record was dated to 66.019 ± 0.021 Ma, the two dates being within 19,000 years of each other, or almost exactly the same within experimental error. The theory is now widely accepted by the scientific community. Some critics, including paleontologist Robert Bakker, <b>argue</b> <b>that</b> <b>such</b> an impact would have killed frogs as well as dinosaurs, yet the frogs survived the extinction event. Gerta Keller of Princeton University argues that recent core samples from Chicxulub prove the impact occurred about 300,000 years before the mass extinction, and thus could not have been the causal factor. However, this conclusion is unsupported by radioactive dating and sedimentology.|$|E

25|$|Over {{the past}} 40 years and {{particularly}} since the mid-1990s, Alliance's political philosophy has veered away from non-sectarian unionism towards a more liberal, neutral position {{on the question of}} either a united Ireland or continued Union with Great Britain. While the Good Friday Agreement has attempted to implement consociational power-sharing, Alliance continues to <b>argue</b> <b>that</b> <b>such</b> enforced coalition government in Northern Ireland entrenches division rather than providing a basis for overcoming it.|$|E

25|$|In a {{partnership}} or joint venture where money is lent, the creditor only provides the capital yet is guaranteed {{a fixed amount}} of profit. The debtor, however, puts in time and effort, but is made to bear the risk of loss. Muslim scholars <b>argue</b> <b>that</b> <b>such</b> practice is unjust. As an alternative to usury, Islam strongly encourages charity and direct investment in which the creditor shares whatever profit or loss the business may incur (in modern terms, this amounts to an equity stake in the business).|$|E
25|$|Among {{advanced}} players, {{there is}} little argument about whether technological changes have enabled higher scoring. The general consensus has been that they have. Yet {{there are those who}} have seen their scores decline, often because they did not change their technique or bowling balls appropriately.

The USBC, for various reasons, has struggled to regulate these changes well enough to protect the integrity of their honor score award program.|$|E
25|$|The Casimir effect {{shows that}} {{quantum field theory}} allows the energy density in certain regions of space to be {{negative}} relative to the ordinary vacuum energy, {{and it has been}} shown theoretically that quantum field theory allows states where the energy can be arbitrarily negative at a given point, Many physicists such as Stephen Hawking, Kip Thorne, and others therefore <b>argue</b> <b>that</b> <b>such</b> effects might make it possible to stabilize a traversable wormhole.

25|$|Wormholes are conjectural distortions in spacetime that theorists {{postulate}} could connect two arbitrary {{points in}} the universe, across an Einstein–Rosen Bridge. It is not known whether wormholes are possible in practice. Although there are solutions to the Einstein equation of general relativity that allow for wormholes, all of the currently known solutions involve some assumption, for example the existence of negative mass, which may be unphysical. However, Cramer et al. <b>argue</b> <b>that</b> <b>such</b> wormholes might have been created in the early universe, stabilized by cosmic string. The general theory of wormholes is discussed by Visser in the book Lorentzian Wormholes.|$|E
25|$|In {{regards to}} race, a superior–inferior {{relationship}} with valuation is also accordingly implied, {{as it is}} unmistakable in virtually all interactions between whites and blacks in the Tarzan stories, and similar relationships and valuations {{can be seen in}} most other interactions between differing people, although one could <b>argue</b> <b>that</b> <b>such</b> interactions are the bedrock of the dramatic narrative and without such valuations there is no story. According to James Loewen's Sundown Towns, this may be a vestige of Burroughs' having been from Oak Park, Illinois, a former Sundown town (a town that forbids non-whites from living within it).|$|E
25|$|This view is {{not shared}} by Andrew Baruch Wachtel (Making a Nation, Breaking a Nation) who sees him as a {{partisan}} of South Slav unity, albeit in a limited sense, in that his linguistic definition emphasized what united South Slavs rather than the religious differences that had earlier divided them. However, one might <b>argue</b> <b>that</b> <b>such</b> a definition is very partisan: Karadžić himself eloquently and explicitly professed that his aim was to unite all native Shtokavian speakers whom he identified as Serbs. Therefore, Vuk Karadžić's central linguistic-political aim was {{the growth of the}} realm of Serbdom according to his ethnic-linguistic ideas and not a unity of any sort between Serbs and the other nations.|$|E

25|$|Proponents of gedoogbeleid <b>argue</b> <b>that</b> <b>such</b> {{a policy}} {{practices}} more consistency in legal protection than without it. Opponents of the Dutch drug policy either call for full legalization, or argue that laws should penalize morally wrong or deviant behavior, whether enforceable or not. In the Dutch courts, however, {{it has long}} been determined that the institutionalized non-enforcement of statutes with well defined limits constitutes de facto decriminalization. The statutes are kept on the books mainly due to international pressure and in adherence with international treaties. A November 2008 poll showed that a 60% majority of the Dutch population support the legalisation of soft drugs. The same poll showed that 85% supported closing of all cannabis coffeeshops within 250 meters walking distance from schools.|$|E
25|$|The idea of {{primitive}} matriarchal religions, which {{derived from the}} work of the Swiss lawyer Johann Jakob Bachofen, was popular in Gardner's day, both among academics (e.g., Erich Neumann, Margaret Murray) and amateurs (e.g. Robert Graves). Later scholars (e.g. Carl Jung and Marija Gimbutas) continued research in this area, and later still Joseph Campbell, Ashley Montagu and others became admirers of Gimbutas' theories of matriarchies in ancient Europe. Matriarchal interpretations of the archaeological record and the criticism of such work continue to be matters of academic debate. Some academics carry on research in this area (such as the 2003 World Congress on Matriarchal Studies). Critics <b>argue</b> <b>that</b> <b>such</b> matriarchal societies never actually existed and are an invention of researchers such as Margaret Murray. This is disputed by documentaries such as Blossoms of Fire (about contemporary Zapotec society).|$|E

Physicists have not found any natural process that would be predicted to form a wormhole naturally in the context of general relativity, although the quantum foam hypothesis is sometimes used to suggest that tiny wormholes might appear and disappear spontaneously at the Planck scale, and stable versions of such wormholes have been suggested as dark matter candidates. It has also been proposed that, if a tiny wormhole held open by a negative mass cosmic string had appeared {{around the time of the}} Big Bang, it could have been inflated to macroscopic size by cosmic inflation.|$|E
