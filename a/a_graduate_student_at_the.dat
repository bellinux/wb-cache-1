Later that year, while <b>a</b> <b>graduate</b> <b>student</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> University of California, Santa Barbara, he was temporarily hired by the United States Geological Survey (USGS) to help monitor the volcano Mount St. Helens in Washington state. St. Helens, dormant since the 1840s and 1850s, resumed activity in March 1980.|$|E
5|$|Before {{developing}} True Detective, Nic Pizzolatto {{worked as}} a literature professor for the University of Chicago, the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, and DePauw University. He also delved into fiction writing, having developed a fascination for it as <b>a</b> <b>graduate</b> <b>student</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> University of Arkansas. His first published work was the short story collection Between Here and the Yellow Sea, released in 2006. The author published his debut novel, titled Galveston, four years later, and {{around the same time}} began preparing to branch out into the television industry (earlier attempts were never realized due to lack of capital).|$|E
5|$|In 1943, the U.S. Department of the Army {{contracted}} the botanist and bioethicist Arthur Galston, {{who discovered the}} defoliants later used in Agent Orange, and his employer University of Illinois at Champaign-Urbana to {{study the effects of}} 2,4-D and 2,4,5-T on cereal grains (including rice) and broadleaf crops. Galston, then <b>a</b> <b>graduate</b> <b>student</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> University of Illinois, in his research and 1943 Ph.D. dissertation focused on finding a chemical means to make soybeans flower and fruit earlier. He discovered both that 2,3,5-triiodobenzoic acid (TIBA) would speed up the flowering of soybeans and that in higher concentrations it would defoliate the soybeans. From these studies arose the concept of using aerial applications of herbicides to destroy enemy crops to disrupt their food supply. In early 1945, the U.S. Army ran tests of various 2,4-D and 2,4,5-T mixtures at the Bushnell Army Airfield in Florida. As a result, the U.S. began a full-scale production of 2,4-D and 2,4,5-T and would have used it against Japan in 1946 during Operation Downfall if the war had continued.|$|E

5|$|Tatlock {{broke up}} with Oppenheimer in 1939, after a tempestuous relationship. In August that year he met Katherine ("Kitty") Puening Harrison, a radical Berkeley student and former Communist Party member. Harrison had been married three times previously. Her first {{marriage}} lasted only a few months. Her second husband was Joe Dallet, {{an active member of}} the Communist party, who was killed in the Spanish Civil War. Kitty returned to the United States where she obtained a Bachelor of Arts degree in botany from the University of Pennsylvania. There she married Richard Harrison, a physician and medical researcher, in 1938. In June 1939 Kitty and Harrison moved to Pasadena, California, where he became chief of radiology at a local hospital and she enrolled as <b>a</b> <b>graduate</b> <b>student</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> University of California, Los Angeles. Oppenheimer and Kitty created a minor scandal by sleeping together after one of Tolman's parties. In the summer of 1940 she stayed with Oppenheimer at his ranch in New Mexico. She finally asked Harrison for a divorce when she found out she was pregnant. When he refused, she obtained an instant divorce in Reno, Nevada, and took Oppenheimer as her fourth husband on November 1, 1940.|$|E

25|$|At {{the time}} of the {{invention}} of his revolutionary illumination scheme as <b>a</b> <b>graduate</b> <b>student</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> University of Giessen, Köhler was working on overcoming problems with microphotography. Microscopes were illuminated by gas lamps, mirrors or other primitive light sources, resulting in an uneven specimen illumination unsuited for producing good quality photomicrographs using the slow-speed emulsions available at the time. Over the course of his work for his doctorate degree, Köhler developed a microscope configuration that allowed for an evenly illuminated field of view and reduced optical glare from the light source. It involved a collector lens for the lamp that allowed the light source to be focused on the front aperture of the condenser. This in turn allowed the condenser to be focused on the specimen using a field diaphragm and condenser focus control. This superior illumination scheme is still widely used in modern microscopes and forms the basis for phase contrast, differential interference contrast, epifluorescence, and confocal microscopy.|$|E

500|$|George Volkoff, {{a friend}} of Christy who was a year ahead of him at UBC, was [...] {{accepted}} as <b>a</b> <b>graduate</b> <b>student</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> University of California, Berkeley, by Robert Oppenheimer, who led the most active school of theoretical physics in the United States at that time. This inspired Christy {{to apply to the}} University of California as well. He was accepted, and was awarded a fellowship for his first year. At Berkeley he shared an apartment with Volkoff, Robert Cornog, Ken McKenzie and McKenzie's wife Lynn McKenzie. For his thesis, Oppenheimer had him look at mesotrons, subatomic particles called muons today that then recently been found in cosmic rays. They were so-called because they were larger than electrons but smaller than protons. With the help of Shuichi Kusaka he performed detailed calculations of the particle's spin. He published two papers on mesotrons with [...] Kusaka in the Physical Review, which formed the basis of his 1941 Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) thesis ...|$|E

500|$|Sawyer argued {{again in}} favor of someone accused of {{communist}} sympathies in Deutch v. United States. Sawyer's client, Bernhard Deutch, was <b>a</b> <b>graduate</b> <b>student</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> University of Pennsylvania who was subpoenaed by the House Un-American Activities Committee in 1954. Deutch answered most of the committee's questions about his own former membership in the Communist Party as an undergraduate at Cornell University, but declined {{to answer questions about}} other members of the party, asserting that his [...] "moral scruples" [...] prevented him from doing so. The House found Deutch in contempt, and the charge was upheld in federal district court. The D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed the conviction, which Sawyer appealed to the Supreme Court. To his surprise, they took the case and reversed the conviction {{on the grounds that the}} government failed to prove [...] "the pertinence of the questions". In an article written after Sawyer's death, Judge Stewart Dalzell credited Sawyer's skillful argument in persuading the Court to overturn the conviction.|$|E
500|$|The {{theoretical}} physicists Niels Bohr and Werner Heisenberg considered {{whether the}} neutron {{could be a}} fundamental nuclear particle like the proton and electron, rather than a proton–electron pair. [...] Heisenberg showed that the neutron was best described as a new nuclear particle, but its exact nature remained unclear. [...] In his 1933 Bakerian Lecture, Chadwick estimated that a neutron had a mass of about [...] Since a proton and an electron had a combined mass of , this implied the neutron as a proton–electron composite had a binding energy of about , which sounded reasonable, although {{it was hard to}} understand how a particle with so little binding energy could be stable. [...] Estimating such a small mass difference required challenging precise measurements, however, and several conflicting results were obtained in 1933–4. [...] By bombarding boron with alpha particles, Frédéric and Irène Joliot-Curie obtained a large value for the mass of a neutron, but Ernest Lawrence's team at the University of California produced a small one. [...] Then Maurice Goldhaber, a refugee from Nazi Germany and <b>a</b> <b>graduate</b> <b>student</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Cavendish Laboratory, suggested to Chadwick that deuterons could be photodisintegrated by the 2.6 MeV gamma rays of 208Tl (then known as thorium C"): ...|$|E
500|$|Friedman {{also argued}} for the {{cessation}} of government intervention in currency markets, thereby spawning an enormous literature on the subject, as well as promoting the practice of freely floating exchange rates. His close friend George Stigler explained, [...] "As is customary in science, he did not win a full victory, in part because research was directed along different lines by the theory of rational expectations, a newer approach developed by Robert Lucas, also at the University of Chicago." [...] The relationship between Friedman and Lucas, or new classical macroeconomics as a whole, was highly complex. The Friedmanian Phillips curve was an interesting starting point for Lucas, but he soon realized that the solution provided by Friedman was not quite satisfactory. Lucas elaborated a new approach in which rational expectations were presumed instead of the Friedmanian adaptive expectations. Due to this reformulation, the story in which {{the theory of the}} new classical Phillips curve was embedded radically changed. This modification, however, had a significant effect on Friedman’s own approach, so, as a result, the theory of the Friedmanian Phillips curve also changed. Moreover, new classical Neil Wallace, who was <b>a</b> <b>graduate</b> <b>student</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> University of Chicago between 1960 and 1963, regarded Friedman’s theoretical courses as a mess. This evaluation clearly indicates the broken relationship between Friedmanian monetarism and new classical macroeconomics.|$|E
