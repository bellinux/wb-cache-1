40|$|The aim of {{our study}} was to {{investigate}} the diagnostic value of scans with 99 mTc(V) -dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) to localize bone <b>and</b> <b>joint</b> infection compared with scans using 67 Ga. Methods: Thirty-six patients referred for investigation of bone <b>and</b> <b>joint</b> infection were studied. In all patients, a bone scan was obtained initially. Subsequently, comparative scans with 99 mTc(V) -DMSA and 67 Ga were performed 1 wk apart. Microbiological findings, pathologic findings and/or clinical follow-up (until symptoms disappeared) were consid ered to be proof of the presence of bone <b>and</b> <b>joint</b> infection. Results: Technetium- 99 m (V) -DMSA showed greater sensitivity and accu racy than 67 Ga in the assessment of bone <b>and</b> <b>joint</b> infection, although the difference was not statistically significant. Conclusion: In comparison with a 67 Ga scan, a 99 rrTc(V) -DMSA scan, in combi nation with a bone scan, is a reliable way to diagnose bone <b>and</b> <b>joint</b> infection.

5|$|The medical {{problems}} of the ancient Egyptians stemmed directly from their environment. Living and working close to the Nile brought hazards from malaria and debilitating schistosomiasis parasites, which caused liver and intestinal damage. Dangerous wildlife such as crocodiles and hippos were also a common threat. The lifelong labors of farming and building put stress on the spine <b>and</b> <b>joints,</b> and traumatic injuries from construction and warfare all took a significant toll on the body. The grit and sand from stone-ground flour abraded teeth, leaving them susceptible to abscesses (though caries were rare).|$|E

40|$|Background: This study {{aimed to}} select {{prescriptions}} (mixtures of medicinal herbs) {{used in the}} treatment of bone <b>and</b> <b>joint</b> disorders in Korean medicine, and through the analysis of medicinal herb combination frequencies, select a high-frequency medicinal herb combination group for further experimental and clinical research. Methods: We systematically searched for terms related to bone <b>and</b> <b>joint</b> disorder in the âDongeuibogam (Dong yibaojian) â, a seminal Korean medicine book. We reviewed the results of published papers regarding the effects in bone <b>and</b> <b>joint</b> disorders (especially in osteoporosis, osteomalacia, osteopenia, rheumatoid arthritis, and degenerative arthritis). Results: In total, 34 candidates of a medicinal herb combination for the treatment of bone <b>and</b> <b>joint</b> disorders(CMHCTBJDs) <b>and</b> nine candidates of a medicinal herb for the treatment of bone <b>and</b> <b>joint</b> disorders(CMHTBJDs) were selected.

5|$|Each forelimb of {{the horse}} runs from the scapula or {{shoulder}} blade to the navicular bone. In between are the humerus (arm), radius (forearm), elbow joint, ulna (elbow), carpus (knee) bones and joint, large metacarpal (cannon), small metacarpal (splint), sesamoid, fetlock joint, first phalanx (long pastern), pastern joint, second phalanx (short pastern), coffin joint, outwardly evidenced by the coronary band, and the third phalanx (coffin or pedal) bones. Each hind limb {{of the horse}} runs from the pelvis to the navicular bone. After the pelvis come the femur (thigh), patella, stifle joint, tibia, fibula, tarsal (hock) bone and joint, large metatarsal (cannon) and small metatarsal (splint) bones. Below these, the arrangement of sesamoid and phalanx bones <b>and</b> <b>joints</b> {{is the same as}} in the forelimbs. When the horse is moving, the distal interphalangeal joint (coffin joint) has the highest amount of stresses applied to it of any joint in the body, and it can be significantly affected by trimming and shoeing techniques. Although having a small range of movement, the proximal interphalangeal joint (pastern joint) is also influential to the movement of the horse, and can change the way that various shoeing techniques affect tendons and ligaments in the legs. Due to the horse's development as a cursorial animal (one whose main form of defense is running), its bones evolved to facilitate speed in a forward direction over hard ground, without the need for grasping, lifting or swinging. The ulna shrank in size and its top portion became the point of the elbow, while the bottom fused with the radius above the radiocarpal (knee) joint, which corresponds to the wrist in humans. A similar change occurred in the fibula bone of the hind limbs. These changes were first seen in the genus Merychippus, approximately 17 million years ago.|$|E
5|$|The bones show {{a variety}} of {{diseases}} and degenerative processes. Six skeletons showed evidence of Paget's disease of bone (osteitis deformans). The most severe case of Paget's disease was in a body buried in the nave in a stone coffin. The lid was carved with two shields, indicating that the occupant had been a knight. One skeleton showed signs of leprosy affecting bones in the face, hands and feet. No definite cases of tuberculosis directly affecting bones were found but in two individuals there were changes in the ribs consistent with their having suffered from tuberculosis of the lungs. The only major congenital abnormality found consisted of bony changes resulting from a possible case of Down's syndrome. Relatively minor congenital abnormalities of the spine were found in 19skeletons, ten of which were cases of spina bifida occulta. Other spinal abnormalities included fused vertebrae, spondylolysis and transitional vertebrae. Definite evidence of fractured bones was found in ten skeletons, and evidence of possible fractures was found in three other cases. One cranium contained a large circular lesion {{which may have been}} the consequence of trepanning. Other diseases specific to bones <b>and</b> <b>joints</b> were osteoarthritis, diffuse idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis (DISH), and possible cases of spondyloarthropathy. Three skeletons showed possible evidence of rickets, two had changes of osteoporosis, and three crania had features of hyperostosis frontalis interna, a metabolic condition affecting post-menopausal women. Osteomata (benign tumours of bone) were found in three cases.|$|E

40|$|Diploma Thesis Abstract This diploma {{thesis is}} focused on the several <b>and</b> <b>joint</b> {{liability}} institute as the main securing VAT institute (instrument) with its own legislation in the Czech VAT Act. This thesis should be a comprehensive analysis of the matter of the several <b>and</b> <b>joint</b> liability in the tax process and should provide an alternative view of some of Czech tax doctrinal conclusions. The introductory part of this thesis is devoted to the particular several <b>and</b> <b>joint</b> liability issues arising from the confrontation between private and public branches of law. The author considers the judicial praxis of awarding the subject of the several <b>and</b> <b>joint</b> liability by recourse wrong. This recourse is derived from the unjust enrichment institute by the Czech Supreme Court. The problem is seen by the author in the fact, that the subject of the <b>joint</b> <b>and</b> several liability does his own legal duty and does not fulfil someone else obligation. Then follows the section about the general legislation of the tax <b>joint</b> <b>and</b> several liability. This tax legislation notably regulates status of the tax subject of the several <b>and</b> <b>joint</b> liability in the tax process and the rest of this legislation should be applied on VAT several <b>and</b> <b>joint</b> liability due to the subsidiarity principle.
