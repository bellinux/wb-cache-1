5|$|The {{day after}} Leopold and Wolfgang arrived back in Salzburg {{the court was}} thrown into turmoil {{by the death of}} Archbishop Schrattenbach. This created {{problems}} for Leopold, who had unresolved issues with the court. Part of his salary during the second Italian visit had been stopped, and Leopold wished to petition for its payment, and to pursue the matter of Wolfgang's salary as a Konzertmeister, which Schrattenbach had indicated might be paid on Wolfgang's return from the first Italian journey. There was also the matter of succession to the post of Salzburg's Kapellmeister, to be available soon on the pending retirement of the incumbent, Giuseppe Lolli, who was over 70 years old; Leopold, who had followed Lolli as Vice-Kapellmeister, might normally have felt confident of succeeding him to the higher post. Decisions on these matters would now be made by the new archbishop, whose policies and <b>attitudes</b> <b>were</b> unknown.|$|E

40|$|The social {{psychology}} literature on <b>attitudes</b> <b>is</b> reviewed. The structure of <b>attitudes</b> <b>is</b> examined {{in terms of}} two conceptual issues: whether <b>attitudes</b> <b>are</b> made up of one or three components and whether the evaluative aspect of <b>attitudes</b> <b>is</b> unidimensional or bidimensional. The possible functions of <b>attitudes</b> <b>are</b> considered, and the relations between attitudes and higher-order constructs such as values and ideologies are discussed. Numerous characteristics of <b>attitudes</b> <b>are</b> defined, including accessibility, ambivalence, and strength. The processes involved in <b>attitude</b> formation <b>are</b> summarized, {{and the effects of}} attitudes on information processing are discussed. Finally, the issue of attitude-behavior consistency is examined, focusing on the conditions under which attitudes predict behavior strongly...|$|R

40|$|How might cause-related {{marketing}} affect {{attitudes toward the}} charity involved? Could charity <b>attitudes</b> <b>be</b> harmed? These questions were addressed in a controlled laboratory study. Positive/negative fit between the organizations was manipulated, and company <b>attitude</b> <b>was</b> measured. The results suggest that charity <b>attitude</b> may <b>be</b> negatively impacted if consumers’ attitudes toward the company are negative, or if the organizations have negative fit. Alternatively, CRM may improve charity attitude if company <b>attitude</b> <b>is</b> positive or the organizations share positive fit. The effect of fit is stronger than the effect of company attitude, so positive fit may compensate for pairing with a company toward which consumers’ <b>attitudes</b> <b>are</b> negative...|$|R

Recreational groups represented on the council, such as Ducks Unlimited and Bow Waters Canoe Club, expressed concern for the river's environment.

25|$|Some in {{the medical}} {{community}} do not recognize CFS as a real condition, nor is there agreement on its prevalence. There has been much disagreement over proposed causes, diagnosis, and treatment of the illness. This uncertainty can significantly affect doctor-patient relations. A 2006 survey of GPs in southwest England found that despite more than two thirds of them accepting CFS/ME as a recognizable clinical entity, nearly half did not feel confident with making the diagnosis and/or treating the disease. Three other key factors that were significantly, positively associated with GPs' <b>attitudes</b> <b>were</b> knowing someone socially with CFS/ME, being male and seeing more patients with the condition in the last year.|$|E
5000|$|Functional {{attitude}} theory (FAT) {{suggests that}} beliefs and <b>attitudes</b> <b>are</b> influential to various psychological functions. <b>Attitudes</b> can <b>be</b> influential on many {{processes such as}} being utilitarian (useful), social, relating to values, or a reduction of cognitive dissonance. They can be beneficial and help people interact with the world. In the late 1950s when psychoanalysis and behaviorism reigned supreme as the foci of psychological studies, Smith, Bruner, and White (1956) and Katz (1960) [...] separately and independently developed typologies of human attitudes {{in relation to the}} functions to which they believed the attitudes served [...] This theory proposes that <b>attitudes</b> <b>are</b> held by individuals because they are important and integral to psychological functioning.

40|$|This article {{adds to the}} {{literature}} on worker attitudes towards unions by investigating the impact of cultural attitudes and the call centre labour process on union attitudes among call centre workers in Britain and India. It is hypothesised that workers with egalitarian and collectivist cultural <b>attitudes</b> will <b>be</b> {{more likely to have}} pro-union attitudes than other workers, although if the impact of cultural <b>attitudes</b> <b>is</b> mediated by history and institutions, it might be expected that this relationship is stronger for British than Indian workers. Conversely, if union <b>attitudes</b> <b>are</b> largely a function of the call centre labour process, we would expect union <b>attitudes</b> to <b>be</b> similar among workers in both countries. Our results only partially support our hypotheses. Collectivist <b>attitudes</b> <b>are</b> only weakly related to union attitudes among the British sample but are more strongly related in the Indian sample. There are significant differences between union attitudes among our British and Indian samples. The article concludes that relationship between cultural attitudes and union <b>attitudes</b> <b>are</b> heavily dependent on institutional context. Cultural <b>attitudes</b> <b>are</b> unlikely to be either a constraint or a facilitator of union efforts to organise workers...|$|R

25|$|Germany {{understood}} that the region would not be re-attached. Therefore, they favored {{the lesser of two}} evils and tacitly supported the interests of Lithuania. The Weimar Republic saw both Poland and France as its major enemies while Lithuania was more neutral. Also, once Germany restored its might, it would be much easier to recapture the region from weaker Lithuania than from larger Poland. Already on February 22, 1922, the Germans unofficially informed the Lithuanians that they were not opposed to Lithuanian action in Klaipėda and that, understandably, such a stance would never be officially declared. Such <b>attitudes</b> <b>were</b> later confirmed in other unofficial German–Lithuanian communications and even during the revolt, when Berlin urged local Germans not to hinder the Lithuanian plans.|$|E

A close friend of Nikolay Rubinstein, Alekseyev co-financed Moscow Conservatory and independent Moscow Opera together with his older mentor Sergei Tretyakov (mayor of Moscow in 18761882) and frequently acted as a manager for musicians.

50|$|Thus, <b>attitudes</b> <b>are</b> {{not always}} a clear {{prediction}} of behavior, resulting in the ‘value-action gap’. The decision-making process is hard to predict as positive <b>attitudes</b> <b>are</b> not followed by positive intentions, and what shapes behavior is a complex process.

25|$|Now that Russia {{was able}} to use Georgia as a {{bridgehead}} for further expansion south of the Caucasus, Persia and the Ottoman Empire felt threatened. In 1804, Pavel Tsitsianov, the commander of Russian forces in the Caucasus, attacked Ganja, provoking the Russo-Persian War of 1804-1813. This was followed by the Russo-Turkish War of 1806-12 with the Ottomans, who were unhappy with Russian expansion in Western Georgia. Georgian <b>attitudes</b> <b>were</b> mixed: some fought as volunteers helping the Russian army, others rebelled against Russian rule (there was a major uprising in the highlands of Kartli-Kakheti in 1804). Both wars ended in Russian victory, with the Ottomans and Persians recognising the tsar's claims over Georgia (by the Treaty of Bucharest with Turkey and the Treaty of Gulistan with Persia).|$|E
25|$|Jewish life in Christian lands {{was marked}} by {{frequent}} blood libels, expulsions, forced conversions and massacres. An underlying source of prejudice against Jews in Europe was religious. Christian rhetoric and antipathy towards Jews developed {{in the early years}} of Christianity and was reinforced by ever increasing anti-Jewish measures over the ensuing centuries. The action taken by Christians against Jews included acts of violence, and murder culminating in the Holocaust. These <b>attitudes</b> <b>were</b> reinforced in Christian preaching, art and popular teaching for two millennia, containing contempt for Jews, as well as statutes which were designed to humiliate and stigmatise Jews. The Nazi Party was known for its persecution of Christian Churches; many of them, such as the Protestant Confessing Church and the Catholic Church, as well as Quakers and Jehovah's Witnesses, aided and rescued Jews who were being targeted by the antireligious régime.|$|E
25|$|The first {{dialogue}} between transhumanism and faith was a one-day conference {{held at the}} University of Toronto in 2004. Religious critics alone faulted the philosophy of transhumanism as offering no eternal truths nor {{a relationship with the}} divine. They commented that a philosophy bereft of these beliefs leaves humanity adrift in a foggy sea of postmodern cynicism and anomie. Transhumanists responded that such criticisms reflect a failure to look at the actual content of the transhumanist philosophy, which, far from being cynical, is rooted in optimistic, idealistic attitudes that trace back to the Enlightenment. Following this dialogue, William Sims Bainbridge, a sociologist of religion, conducted a pilot study, published in the Journal of Evolution and Technology, suggesting that religious <b>attitudes</b> <b>were</b> negatively correlated with acceptance of transhumanist ideas and indicating that individuals with highly religious worldviews tended to perceive transhumanism as being a direct, competitive (though ultimately futile) affront to their spiritual beliefs.|$|E

25|$|This {{achievement}} was checked by {{the controversy over}} the use of graven images, and the proper interpretation of the Second Commandment, which led to the crisis of Iconoclasm or destruction of religious images, which racked the Empire between 726 and 843. The restoration of Orthodoxy resulted in a strict standardization of religious imagery within the Eastern Church. Byzantine art became increasingly conservative, as the form of images themselves, many accorded divine origin or thought to have been be painted by Saint Luke or other figures, was held to have a status not far off that of a scriptural text. They could be copied, but not improved upon. As a concession to Iconoclast sentiment, monumental religious sculpture was effectively banned. Neither of these <b>attitudes</b> <b>were</b> held in Western Europe, but Byzantine art nonetheless had great influence there until the High Middle Ages, and remained very popular long after that, with vast numbers of icons of the Cretan School exported to Europe as late as the Renaissance.

The enigmatic frescoes at Castelseprio may be an example of work by a Greek artist working in Italy.|$|E
25|$|Following completion, {{the park}} quickly slipped into decline. One {{of the main}} reasons for this was the lack of {{interest}} from the Tammany Hall political machine, which was the largest political force in New York at the time. Around the turn of the 20th century, the park faced several new challenges. Cars were becoming commonplace, bringing with them their burden of pollution, and people's <b>attitudes</b> <b>were</b> beginning to change. No longer were parks to be used only for walks and picnics in an idyllic environment but also for sports and similar recreation. Following the dissolution of the Central Park Commission in 1870 and Andrew Green's departure from the project, and Vaux's death in 1895, the maintenance effort gradually declined. All of this changed in 1934, when Republican Fiorello La Guardia was elected mayor of New York City and unified the five park-related departments then in existence. Robert Moses was given the task of cleaning up the park. Moses, about {{to become one of the}} most powerful men in New York City, took over what was essentially a relic, a leftover from a bygone era.|$|E
