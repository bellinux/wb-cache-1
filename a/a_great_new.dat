First, the Edict of Milan, issued by the emperors Constantine I and Licinius in 313, allowed for public Christian worship, and led {{to the development of}} a monumental, Christian art. Second, the dedication of Constantinople in 330 created <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>new</b> artistic centre for the eastern half of the Empire, and a specifically Christian one. Other artistic traditions flourished in rival cities such as Alexandria, Antioch, and Rome, but it was not until all of these cities had fallen - the first two to the Arabs and Rome to the Goths - that Constantinople established its supremacy.|$|E

Liverpool ended the 1974–75 season as runners-up to Derby County in the league. Kennedy featured just 25 times in the league as Toshack formed an effective combination with Kevin Keegan up front, and started to become frustrated and disillusioned in the club.|$|E
500|$|The {{film was}} a {{tremendous}} critical success, with many reviewers hailing it as a genuine work of art, recommended for both children and adults. Although film histories often state that the animation of the human characters was criticized, more recent scholarship finds that most reviewers praised the realistic style of the human animation, with several stating that audiences will forget that they are watching animated humans rather than real ones. At the 11th Academy Awards, the film won an Academy Honorary Award for Walt Disney [...] "as a significant screen innovation which has charmed millions and pioneered <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>new</b> entertainment field". Disney received a full-size Oscar statuette and seven miniature ones, presented to him by 10-year-old child actress Shirley Temple. The film was also nominated for Best Musical Score.

500|$|Viking Invasion {{received}} [...] "favorable" [...] reviews, albeit {{slightly less}} than the original Medieval: Total War, according to Metacritic. Reviewers felt the new gameplay features for the Vikings {{were the most important}} enhancement of the expansion pack, with Eurogamer commending the Vikings' raiding system as something that fixes what [...] "the original Medieval lacked". ActionTrip praised the new campaign as being a challenge for players: [...] "even on the normal difficulty setting, Viking Invasion is a very challenging game", a view shared by other critics. The pre-battle screen was commended by GameSpot, calling it a [...] "handy new feature." [...] GameSpot also praised the new additions to the original campaign, mentioning they have [...] "made castle sieges more interesting". The main criticism for Medieval: Total War – Viking Invasion was the graphics, with both ActionTrip and Eurogamer stating that they were [...] "starting to feel a little bit creaky". A lack of new multiplayer options was considered by GameSpot to be [...] "unfortunate", mentioning that [...] "a multiplayer campaign option would have been <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>new</b> feature". Overall, the expansion was received well by critics in the industry. IGN concluded by saying fans [...] "won't be disappointed with the Viking Invasion", while Actiontrip finished stating; [...] "the graphics are beginning to look old" [...] but the challenge made the expansion [...] "worth it". The review by GameSpot finished by saying [...] "overall, the expansion is a great addition to Medieval", and Eurogamer concluded with praising the addition it made to Medieval: Total War: [...] "It's a worthy expansion pack to a truly excellent game".|$|E

Tony and Matt are great actors, and the fact that they're easy on the eye is a great advantage". [...] "What the brothers bring is romance and fun, because that's something we've been a little short-changed on in EastEnders recently. The Moons are a very interesting family to work with– they're all big characters. It's <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>new</b> era for that clan". Kirkwood added that [...] "there is more to the pair than meets the eye" [...] saying that there [...] "are a couple of buried secrets between Eddie and his sons" [...] confirming it will be [...] "a big story for the summer". He finished, [...] "there'll be consequences for all concerned". Kirkwood later added, [...] "What I hope we've created in Tyler and Anthony are blokes you might see in the pub on a Friday night with an appetite for life– and for women." [...] When Anthony was introduced, it was revealed that he was a gambling addict. Of this, Lapinskas said, [...] "it's a great thing that our executive producer Bryan Kirkwood and the EastEnders team came up with for Anthony– that he does have this gambling problem and various insecurities connected with it. It adds some more depth to the character and it's brilliant when we can explore that. With every topic and every storyline that crops up, I think Anthony's background will always have an effect and impact on it. That's really nice to play." ...|$|E

Goldman described the episode as an [...] "especially strong installment, which delivered {{on a lot of}} fronts." [...] Goldman praised the scene depicting Sarah and Mauser's confrontation, writing, [...] "The entire ambience of the scene was terrific – a rainy night at a Christmas tree lot, with Chuck secretly watching as Sarah shot the unarmed, surrendering Mauser in cold blood - to the tune of 'Silent Night', no less. Of course she did this because she loves Chuck and wants to protect him, but all Chuck knows is that he just saw Sarah in a very scary light, and it's <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>new</b> dynamic to their relationship." [...] HitFix writer Alan Sepinwall wrote, [...] "Chuck vs. Santa Claus" [...] was moving along amusingly enough when it still seemed like Ned Rhyerson was just a hapless criminal with the bad luck to crash into a store built above a top-secret government intelligence facility, but the surprising left turn it took when Chuck flashed on Lt. Mauser took things to another level." [...] Steve Heisler of The A.V. Club gave the episode an A-, writing [...] "Santa Claus certainly delivered (character) goodies to everyone tonight. Morgan gets to be a hero, even if no one notices, taking down Ned with a fake snow machine. Jeff calls his mother–in prison–then finds the time to break up a mistletoe makeout session. Lester sneaks a smooch from Anna, and isn't even remotely fazed when it causes her to run for the hills. And Big Mike's embrace of cousin Big Al is a keeper." ...|$|E

[...] Stephen Whitty of the Newark Star-Ledger gave the film {{three out of four}} stars, saying [...] "Fresh family fun. Although there are those slightly noxious images of rodents scampering around a kitchen, the movie doesn't stoop to kid-pandering jokes based on back talk and bodily gases." [...] David Ansen of Newsweek gave the film a positive review, saying [...] "A film as rich as a sauce béarnaise, as refreshing as a raspberry sorbet, and a lot less predictable than the damn food metaphors and adjectives all us critics will churn out to describe it. OK, one more and then I'll be done: it's yummy." [...] Peter Hartlaub of the San Francisco Chronicle gave the film four out of four stars, saying [...] "Ratatouille never overwhelms, even though it's stocked with action, romance, historical content, family drama and serious statements about the creation of art." [...] Richard Corliss of Time gave the film a positive review, saying [...] "From the moment Remy enters, crashing, to the final happy fadeout, Ratatouille parades the brio and depth that set Pixar apart from and above other animation studios." [...] Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times gave the film four out of four stars, saying [...] "A lot of animated movies have inspired sequels, notably Shrek, but Brad Bird's Ratatouille is the first one that made me positively desire one." [...] Peter Howell of the Toronto Star gave the film four out of four stars, saying [...] "Had Bird gone the safe route, he would have robbed us of <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>new</b> cartoon figure in Remy, who {{like the rest of the}} film is rendered with animation that is at once fanciful and life-like.
