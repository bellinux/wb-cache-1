5|$|The non-reproductive castes of {{termites}} are wingless {{and rely}} exclusively on their six legs for locomotion. The alates fly {{only for a}} brief amount of time, so they also rely on their legs. The appearance of the legs is similar in each caste, but the soldiers have larger and heavier legs. The structure of the legs is consistent with other insects: the parts of a leg include a coxa, trochanter, femur, tibia and the tarsus. The number of tibial spurs on an individual's leg varies. Some species of termite have an <b>arolium,</b> located between the claws, which is present in species that climb on smooth surfaces but is absent in most termites.|$|E
5|$|Mantises {{have two}} spiked, {{grasping}} forelegs ("raptorial legs") in which prey items are caught and held securely. In most insect legs, including the posterior four {{legs of a}} mantis, the coxa and trochanter combine as an inconspicuous base of the leg; in the raptorial legs, however, the coxa and trochanter combine to form a segment {{about as long as}} the femur, which is a spiky part of the grasping apparatus (see illustration). Located {{at the base of the}} femur is a set of discoidal spines, usually four in number, but ranging from none to as many as five depending on the species. These spines are preceded by a number of tooth-like tubercles, which, along with a similar series of tubercles along the tibia and the apical claw near its tip, give the foreleg of the mantis its grasp on its prey. The foreleg ends in a delicate tarsus used as a walking appendage, made of four or five segments and ending in a two-toed claw with no <b>arolium.</b>|$|E
50|$|Because {{they lack}} {{developed}} <b>arolium</b> between their claws, neither adults nor juveniles can climb smooth, vertical surfaces, though juveniles {{have been known}} to climb silicone surfaces, and the plastic sides of containers.|$|E
50|$|These {{species are}} colorful, usually with hindwings that are yellow or red and edged with black. Others have black hindwings with pale edges, {{and a few}} species (including the most {{economically}} important ones) have clear hindwings. The <b>arolium</b> is extremely small or absent.|$|E
5000|$|Under their pretarsi, {{members of}} the Diptera {{generally}} have paired lobes or pulvilli, meaning [...] "little cushions". There is a single pulvillus below each unguis. The pulvilli often have an <b>arolium</b> between them or otherwise a median bristle or empodium, meaning the meeting place of the pulvilli. On {{the underside of the}} tarsal segments there frequently are pulvillus-like organs or plantulae. The <b>arolium,</b> plantulae and pulvilli are adhesive organs enabling their possessors to climb smooth or steep surfaces. They all are outgrowths of the exoskeleton and their cavities contain blood. Their structures are covered with tubular tenent hairs, the apices of which are moistened by a glandular secretion. The organs are adapted to apply the hairs closely to a smooth surface so that adhesion occurs through surface molecular forces.|$|E
50|$|The Hebridae are {{the only}} family within the {{superfamily}} Hebroidea. The 160 species are placed in seven genera. Hebrids are divided between two recognized subfamilies. The first is Hebrinae, which have eyes located near {{the base of the}} head, and antennae that are clearly longer than the head, and the parameres is generally symmetrical. It includes the genera of Hebrometra (Cobben), a genus of four species from Ethiopia, Hebrus (Curtis), the family's largest genus consisting of 110 species, Lipogomphus (Berg), four species from the Americas, Merragata (Buchanan-White), of several species, Neotimasius (Andersen), of one southern Indian species, and Timasius (Distant), a genus of 15 species that ranges from Sri Lanka to Taiwan. The second subfamily is Hyrcaninae, which have eyes clearly removed from the pronontum's anterior margin. The length of the antennae is less or equal to that of the head. Also, the ventral <b>arolium</b> is distinctly longer than the dorsal <b>arolium,</b> and the parameres is symmetrical. This subfamily has only one included genus, Hyrcanus (Distant), of four Asian species.|$|E
50|$|The bee genus Anthophora {{is one of}} {{the largest}} in the family Apidae, with over 450 species {{worldwide}} in 14 different subgenera. They are most abundant and diverse in the Holarctic and African biogeographic regions. All species are solitary, though many nest in large aggregations. Nearly all species make nests in the soil, either in banks or in flat ground; the larvae develop in cells with waterproof linings and do not spin cocoons. Males commonly have pale white or yellow facial markings, and/or peculiarly modified leg armature and hairs. Anthophora individuals can be distinguished from the very similar genus Amegilla by the possession of an <b>arolium</b> between the tarsal claws.|$|E

5000|$|Most Anthidium {{species are}} leaf-cutting bees who use conifer resin, plant hairs, earth, or a {{combination}} of these as material for the nest walls. Their abdominal bands are usually interrupted in the middle. There is no lobe (<b>arolium)</b> between their claws. Anthidium manicatum is commonly known as the wool carder bee which uses comblike mandibles to [...] "comb" [...] plant fibers into its brood cell walls. It has spread from Europe to North and South America. The males are much larger (ca. 18 mm) than the females (ca.12 mm) which is not uncommon among Megachilidae, but very rare among other bee families (e.g., the true honey bees, genus Apis). The males also have three [...] "thorns" [...] at their abdominal apex which they use as weapons when defending their territory.|$|E

5000|$|The ancestral tarsus was {{a single}} segment and in the extant Protura, Diplura and certain insect larvae the tarsus also is single-segmented. Most modern insects have tarsi divided into subsegments (tarsomeres), usually about five. The actual number varies with the taxon, which may be useful for {{diagnostic}} purposes. For example, the Pterogeniidae characteristically have 5-segmented fore- and mid-tarsi, but 4-segmented hind tarsi, whereas the Cerylonidae have four tarsomeres on each tarsus. The distal segment of the typical insect leg is the pretarsus. In the Collembola, Protura and many insect larvae, the pretarsus is a single claw. On the pretarsus most insects have a pair of claws unguis, plural ungues. Between the ungues a median unguitractor plate supports the pretarsus. The plate {{is attached to the}} apodeme of the flexor muscle of the ungues. In the Neoptera the parempodia are a symmetrical pair of structures arising from the outside (distal) surface of the unguitractor plate between the claws. It is present in many Hemiptera and almost all Heteroptera. Usually the parempodia are bristly (setiform), but in a few species they are fleshy. [...] Sometimes the parempodia are reduced in size so as to almost disappear. [...] Above the unguitractor plate the pretarsus expands forward into a median lobe, the <b>arolium.</b>|$|E
40|$|Hymenoptera {{attach to}} smooth {{surfaces}} with a flexible pad, the <b>arolium,</b> between the claws. Here we investigate its movement in Asian weaver ants (Oecophylla smaragdina) and honeybees (Apis mellifera).  When ants run {{upside down on}} a smooth surface, the <b>arolium</b> is unfolded and folded back with each step. Its extension is strictly coupled with the retraction of the claws. Experimental pull on the claw-flexor tendon revealed that the claw-flexor muscle not only retracts the claws, but also moves the <b>arolium.</b> The elicited <b>arolium</b> movement comprises (i) about a 90 ° rotation (extension) mediated by {{the interaction of the}} two rigid pretarsal sclerites arcus and manubrium and (ii) a lateral expansion and increase in volume. In severed legs of O. smaragdina ants, an increase in hemolymph pressure of 15 kPa was sufficient to inflate the <b>arolium</b> to its full size. Apart from being actively extended, an <b>arolium</b> in contact also can unfold passively when the leg is subject to a pull toward the body.  We propose a combined mechanical–hydraulic model for <b>arolium</b> movement: (i) the <b>arolium</b> is engaged by the action of the unguitractor, which mechanically extends the arolium; (ii) compression of the <b>arolium</b> gland reservoir pumps liquid into the arolium; (iii) arolia partly in contact with the surface are unfolded passively when the legs are pulled toward the body; and (iv) the <b>arolium</b> deflates and moves back to its default position by elastic recoil of the cuticle...|$|E
40|$|AbstractWe {{studied the}} {{external}} and internal pretarsus structure of the ants Brachyponera sennaarensis and Daceton armigerum {{in relation to their}} very different climbing ability. B. sennaarensis is a ground-dwelling species that is not able to climb vertical smooth walls. They have a pair of straight pretarsal claws with an average claw tip angle of 56 degrees, while the ventral tarsal surface lacks fine hairs that touch the substrate. They have no adhesive pad on the vestigial <b>arolium,</b> while the <b>arolium</b> gland is very small. D. armigerum, on the other hand, is an arboreal and thus well-climbing species with a very strong grip on the substrate. Their pretarsal claws are very hooked, with a claw tip angle around 75 degrees. They have dense arrays of fine hairs on the ventral tarsal surface, a well-developed <b>arolium</b> and <b>arolium</b> gland. These clearly different morphological characteristics are in line with the opposite climbing performance of both species...|$|E
40|$|The {{unfolding}} of the hymenopteran attachment pad (<b>arolium)</b> may {{be achieved in}} two ways, hydraulic and mechanical. The first was confirmed in experiments with pressure applied to more proximal leg parts and on immersion in hypotonic solutions. Presumably, this way of unfolding does not {{play an important role}} for a living hornet. Mechanical unfolding was studied experimentally {{with the aid of a}} micromanipulator pulling the tendon of the musculus retractor unguis. Ablation experiments on different parts of the <b>arolium</b> indicated that the arcus is the most crucial element for mechanical unfolding. The shape of the arcus in closed and open conditions was measured using a 3 D measurement microscope and reconstructed by means of 3 D computer graphics. The arcus coils up upon being freed from the <b>arolium</b> tissues, and coils up even more after immersion into a 10 % aqueous solution of NaOH. Geometrical models of the arcus are proposed, from which the rotational moment of elasticity is derived. Conformations and deformations of the arcus are quantified in order to explain its role in the folding and unfolding processes of the <b>arolium.</b> The diversity of approaches supports the idea that the arcus is a prestressed (tensegrity) structure providing immediate, soft, and graded transmission of forces during folding and unfolding action of the <b>arolium...</b>|$|E
40|$|Adhesive organs on {{the legs}} of {{arthropods}} and vertebrates are strongly direction dependent, making contact only when pulled towards the body but detaching when pushed away from it. Here we show that {{the two types of}} attachment pads found in cockroaches (Nauphoeta cinerea), tarsal euplantulae and pretarsal <b>arolium,</b> serve fundamentally different functions. Video recordings of vertical climbing revealed that euplantulae are almost exclusively engaged with the substrate when legs are pushing, whereas arolia make contact when pulling. Thus, upward-climbing cockroaches used front leg arolia and hind leg euplantulae, whereas hind leg arolia and front leg euplantulae were engaged during downward climbing. Single-leg friction force measurements showed that the <b>arolium</b> and euplantulae have an opposite direction dependence. Euplantulae achieved maximum friction when pushed distally, whereas <b>arolium</b> forces were maximal during proximal pulls. This direction dependence was not explained by the variation of shear stress but by different contact areas during pushing or pulling. The changes in contact area result from the arrangement of the flexible tarsal chain, tending to detach the <b>arolium</b> when pushing and to peel off euplantulae when in tension. Our results suggest that the euplantulae in cockroaches are not adhesive organs but ‘friction pads’, mainly providing the necessary traction during locomotion...|$|E
40|$|Stick insects (Carausius morosus) {{have two}} {{distinct}} types of attachment pad per leg, tarsal "heel" pads (euplantulae) and a pre-tarsal "toe" pad (<b>arolium).</b> Here {{we show that}} these two pad types are specialised for fundamentally different functions. When standing upright, stick insects rested on their proximal euplantulae, while arolia were the only pads in surface contact when hanging upside down. Single-pad force measurements showed that the adhesion of euplantulae was extremely small, but friction forces strongly increased with normal load and coefficients of friction were [Formula: see text] 1. The pre-tarsal <b>arolium,</b> in contrast, generated adhesion that strongly increased with pulling forces, allowing adhesion to be activated and deactivated by shear forces, which can be produced actively, or passively {{as a result of}} the insects' sprawled posture. The shear-sensitivity of the <b>arolium</b> was present even when corrected for contact area, and was independent of normal preloads covering nearly an order of magnitude. Attachment of both heel and toe pads is thus activated partly by the forces that arise passively in the situations in which they are used by the insects, ensuring safe attachment. Our results suggest that stick insect euplantulae are specialised "friction pads" that produce traction when pressed against the substrate, while arolia are "true" adhesive pads that stick to the substrate when activated by pulling forces...|$|E

40|$|Beetles (Coleoptera) are {{the largest}} group of insects and inhabit nearly every {{biological}} niche. During evolution, to enable walking and attachment on the variety of substrata, beetles developed various leg adaptations (Stork, 1987).

Specialized adhesive tarsal setae of representatives of some beetle families provide a mechanism of attachment to plant surfaces, because such natural substrata can be very smooth indeed (Stork, 1983 a,b).
