500|$|Oosterbaan {{believed}} {{success was}} fleeting. [...] He once {{was quoted in}} Time Magazine as saying, [...] "I'm on top now, <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of backslapping. But what of seasons to come? Let me lose the opener {{or a couple of}} other games next fall, and then watch how I'm blasted." [...] As coach, he had a reputation as a mild-mannered man who aspired to live by the maxims of his own college football coach, Fielding Yost.|$|E
500|$|He joined Conference Premier club Kettering Town on a {{contract}} {{until the end of}} 2010–11 on 18 January 2011. Kettering were fighting against relegation, and Challinor was quoted as saying [...] "We have to stay positive. We know it's a transitional period for the club <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> going on". He made his debut later that day as a half-time substitute for Callum Wilson in Kettering's 2–1 loss away to Grimsby Town. His first goal for Kettering came in stoppage time against Southport in a 3–1 home victory on 30 April 2011, having entered the match in the 89th minute. Challinor finished the season with 14 appearances and one goal for Kettering. He agreed to stay at Kettering ahead of 2011–12 on non-contract terms, in the belief that a permanent contract would later be agreed, and started the season playing as a defensive midfielder.|$|E
500|$|Many of the {{original}} {{members of the group}} attended the Escuela Elemental and the Escuela Secundaria of the University of Puerto Rico, an institution noted for its progressive and experimental teaching approaches. Vocalist/bassist Willy Rodriguez commented, [...] "It is a school in which you are allowed to decide a few things on your own, you have free time between classes [...] you can do your own things, <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of musical culture in the school. It tends to allow you to explore your artistic interests... There was always an air of liberation, of thinking on your own. I think that influenced a lot in what we do today musically and ideologically." [...] Group members Boris Bilbraut, Willy Rodríguez, Eliut González, Juan Costa, and Ivan Gutiérres began jamming together in 1996, bonding over a shared interest in reggae music, particularly Bob Marley. [...] These rehearsal sessions took place in El Hoyo, a neighborhood in the San Juan metropolitan area.|$|E

500|$|Another story arc saw Charlie {{reveal that}} her sister Ruby Buckton (Rebecca Breeds) {{is in fact}} her daughter. Charlie gave birth to Ruby after she was raped by Grant Bledcoe (Clayton Watson), when she was younger. Both Anderson and Breeds found the storyline {{challenging}} and felt {{they had to get}} it right. Breeds said it made her nervous but was pleased with the end result. She said she had to let it affect her own emotions to effect the viewing public. [...] "The revelation ruins their relationship, and Anderson said that Charlie was [...] "trying desperately to bridge this gap". Breeds added [...] "Ruby just wants to get some security back, everything she thought her life was is totally up in the air". Ruby becomes confused and starts to ask herself questions such as [...] "Where do I stand now?" [...] and [...] "How do I reconcile this?" [...] Breeds said it was a [...] "big exploration" [...] and a journey for Ruby, with Anderson agreeing. Anderson felt there was a beautiful element to the storyline and opined: [...] "Although it is tragic, you feel sorry for Charlie and you can sort of understand where it has all come from." [...] She added that everyone feels sorry for Ruby, meaning neither are wrong. Furthermore, she said, [...] "You are just rooting for them, you just want them to get back to how they were and it {{is a bit of a}} journey." [...] Comparing the storyline to the lesbian plot she said, [...] "Perhaps this storyline was a little bit harder, you've seen the start of this storyline <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> more to come and it wasn't easy." ...|$|E
2500|$|Giddens' {{first visit}} to Libya {{resulted}} in articles in the New Statesman, El País and La Repubblica, where {{he argued that the}} country had been dramatically transformed. In the New Statesman he wrote: [...] "Gaddafi's 'conversion' may have been driven partly by the wish to escape sanctions, but I get the strong sense it is authentic <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of motive power behind it. Saif Gaddafi is a driving force behind the rehabilitation and potential modernisation of Libya. Gaddafi Sr, however, is authorising these processes." [...] During the second visit, Monitor Group organised a panel of [...] "three thinkers" [...] – Giddens, Gaddafi, and Benjamin Barber, author of Jihad vs. McWorld – chaired by Sir David Frost.|$|E
2500|$|Following the {{expansion}} of his role from turntablist to keyboardist on Light Grenades (2006), Chris Kilmore stated that, during the band's hiatus, he [...] "took a lot of piano lessons and {{did a lot of}} learning keyboards. I made a lot of music, but it just sits at home, it’s not for everybody, it’s just for me as a learning process. A lot of practicing, I’d be playing music every single day, keys every single day. I was scratching a little bit, but mostly keys, because my role in this band has kind of evolved. So to pick up a new instrument and learn it in a few years was hard to do. [...] I’m really serious and focused about it, that’s what the rehearsals are for, hitting all those wrong notes. But I have questions, <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of people around me that I can ask, Ben is an incredible musician, Mike is an incredible musician and composer, and if I need something explained or helped with, I don’t have to go far to get an answer." ...|$|E

Lucas explained [...] "Summer's aware they've overloaded the car, so she wants to keep calm. She can sense Chris is getting stressed by all the yelling, so she's very tense." [...] As Chris tries {{to concentrate on the}} road, Andrew accidentally bumps his arm and he suddenly loses control of the car, which swerves, hits an embankment and flips over before coming to a stop. Sophie is critically injured after being thrown from the vehicle, while Andrew has a serious head injury and Ed is also in a bad way. Rhys Lawson (Ben Barber) comes across the scene and puts his own life at risk to start [...] "frantic" [...] rescue efforts. He cuts his hand in the process, but refuses to get it looked when the emergency services arrive. Rhys eventually finds Sophie and when she reaches the hospital, she is rushed into surgery. A writer for Soap World commented that [...] "a terrified" [...] Natasha is worried Ed will not wake up, before she can tell him she loves him. Mason stated that Chris is wracked with guilt and worried for his friends. Things become worse for him when Paul Robinson (Stefan Dennis) arrives at the hospital and, after learning his son and niece are in a serious condition, threatens to sue him. Mason revealed that Paul is angry and wants someone to pay for what happened, while Dennis explained [...] "Yes, it's typical Paul - someone has to pay and he decides that Chris should take all of the blame before he knows the full story." ...|$|E
