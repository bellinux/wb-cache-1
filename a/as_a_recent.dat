5|$|Chief of Section D Ros Myers (Hermione Norris) {{introduces}} Lucas North (Richard Armitage) {{to one of}} Adam Carter's assets, Pakistani {{intelligence officer}} Marlin (Emilio Doorgasingh). Marlin has information about a planned attack by Al-Qaeda; a cell intends to create Internet chatter, followed by a dry run, after which they will commence a series of suicide attacks. The ringleader behind this is Nadif Abdelrashid (Ariyon Bakare) who was previously responsible for similar attacks in Turkey and Somalia. Ben Kaplan is in his first undercover operation disguised <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>recent</b> convert to Islam and {{becomes part of the}} cell.

5|$|These {{harmful effects}} {{may also be}} seen in non-smokers, <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>recent</b> {{meta-analysis}} including data from approximately 230,000 patients showed that β-carotene, vitamin A or vitamin E supplementation is associated with increased mortality but saw no significant effect from vitamin C. No health risk was seen when all the randomized controlled studies were examined together, but an increase in mortality was detected when only high-quality and low-bias risk trials were examined separately. As {{the majority of these}} low-bias trials dealt with either elderly people, or people with disease, these results may not apply to the general population. This meta-analysis was later repeated and extended by the same authors, with the new analysis published by the Cochrane Collaboration; this analysis confirmed the previous results. These two publications are consistent with some previous meta-analyzes that also suggested that Vitamin E supplementation increased mortality, and that antioxidant supplements increased the risk of colon cancer. Beta-carotene may also increase lung cancer. Overall, the large number of clinical trials carried out on antioxidant supplements suggest that either these products have no effect on health, or that they cause a small increase in mortality in elderly or vulnerable populations.|$|E

25|$|However, in 1985, David Deutsch {{published}} three related thought experiments {{which could}} test the theory vs the Copenhagen interpretation. The experiments require {{macroscopic quantum state}} preparation and quantum erasure by a hypothetical quantum computer which is currently outside experimental possibility. Since then Lockwood (1989), Vaidman and others have made similar proposals. These proposals also require an advanced technology which is able to place a macroscopic object in a coherent superposition, another task which it is uncertain will ever be possible to perform.

500|$|As German Romanticism got {{underway}} {{and writers}} started to seek authentic folklore, Jacob Grimm rejected Elf <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>recent</b> Anglicism, and promoted the reuse {{of the old}} form Elb (plural Elbe or Elben).

This in turn inspired Goethe's poem Der Erlkönig. Goethe's poem then took {{on a life of}} its own, inspiring the Romantic concept of the Erlking, which was influential on literary images of elves from the nineteenth century on.|$|E

500|$|As part of DC Comics' 2011 relaunch, The New 52, Barbara Gordon's {{paralysis}} {{is described}} as lasting only three years time.

Although she resumes her work as Batgirl one year after recovering her mobility, she continues to suffer from posttraumatic stress disorder, causing her to hesitate in battle when exposed to gunfire that could result in receiving new spinal damage. The character also exhibits survivor guilt due to the fact she has made a full recovery from her paralysis while others have not. In a September 2011 interview, Gail Simone stated, [...] "I'm enjoying writing Batgirl at this stage in her life. She's younger, she doesn't know everything, she's been immersed in school and her life-plan. Events conspire to change that plan, and she's nervous about that. I love writing Barbara under pretty much any conditions, but this really is a key time for her." ...|$|E
500|$|This {{species was}} {{described}} by Linnaeus in 1758 {{and placed in the}} genus Ardea that included the larger herons. Edward Blyth published a monograph on the cranes in 1881 in which he considered the [...] "sarus crane" [...] of India to be made up of two species, Grus collaris and Grus antigone. Most modern authors recognize one species with three disjunct populations that were previously treated as subspecies, although the status of one extinct population from the Philippines is uncertain. The sarus cranes in India (previously of the sub-species antigone) are the largest, and in the east from Myanmar is replaced by a population that extends into Southeast Asia (previously of the sub-species sharpii). The sarus cranes from the Indian subcontinent are well marked and differentiated from the south-eastern population by having a white collar below the bare head and upper neck, and white tertiary remiges. The population in Australia (initially placed in sharpii (sometimes spelt sharpei but amended to conform to the rules of Latin grammar) was separated and named as the race gilliae, sometimes spelt gillae or even gilli), prior to a genetic analysis. Recent genetic analyses shows these three populations as representatives of a formerly continuous population that varies clinally. The Australian race was designated only in 1988, with the species itself first noticed in Australia in 1969 and regarded <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>recent</b> immigrant. Native Australians, however, differentiated the sarus and the brolga and called the sarus [...] "the crane that dips its head in blood". Sarus of the Australian population are similar to those in south-east Asia in having no white on the neck and tertiary remiges, but are distinguished by a larger grey patch of ear coverts. This population shows the most recent divergence from the ancestral form with an estimated 3000 generations of breeding within Australia. An additional subspecies luzonica was suggested for the population once found, but now extinct, in the Philippines. No distinctive character is known of this population.|$|E

2500|$|However, {{there is}} a lack of any hard {{evidence}} that would link Chapman to the Ripper murders.

[...] There is also some doubt about whether he could speak English at the time, as the Ripper would have had to, and whether <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>recent</b> immigrant he would have had the intimate knowledge of the Whitechapel district that the Ripper seems to have had.
