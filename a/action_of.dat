5|$|Bulteel and Meriton were commended. Meriton was {{to fight}} two more naval battles against the French, serving at the {{successful}} defence of the China Fleet at the Battle of Pulo Aura in February 1804. He was badly wounded and captured by a French frigate squadron after a fierce defence at the <b>Action</b> <b>of</b> 3 July 1810.|$|E
5|$|Casualties in {{the battle}} were minimal, the British losing four killed and two wounded while the French {{recorded}} no casualties at all. The significance of the action lies in {{the ease with which}} French frigates operating from Île de France were able to attack and capture vital trade convoys without facing serious opposition. The <b>action</b> <b>of</b> 18 November was the second occasion in 1809 in which a British East India convoy was destroyed and another would be lost at the <b>Action</b> <b>of</b> 3 July 1810 the following year. These losses were exceptionally heavy, especially when combined with the 12 East Indiamen wrecked during 1809, and would eventually provoke the massive buildup of British forces in late 1810. Despite the French success Vénus was never again able to operate independently in this manner. Hamelin was needed during 1810 to operate against the strong British frigate squadrons that returned in the spring to harass his cruisers and prepare for the planned invasions of Île Bonaparte and Île de France using the soldiers stationed on Rodriguez. The French commodore was ultimately unable to prevent these operations and was eventually captured in the <b>Action</b> <b>of</b> 18 September 1810, a personal engagement with Rowley on HMS Boadicea.|$|E
