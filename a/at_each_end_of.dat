5|$|Arrowmen are {{identified}} {{by a white}} sash bearing a red arrow that is worn over their right shoulder. An Ordeal member wears a sash with a lone arrow. The Brotherhood member wears a sash bearing an arrow with a red bar <b>at</b> <b>each</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the arrow. A Vigil Honor member wears a sash with the same bars of as the Brotherhood sash <b>at</b> <b>each</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the arrow, and a Vigil Honor triangle {{on the center of}} the shaft. Members wear the sash at Order of the Arrow functions and special Scouting activities when members need to be identified as Arrowmen rendering special services. The OA sash is not worn {{at the same time as}} the merit badge sash, nor worn folded in the belt. The sash as a form of recognition dates to the founding of the Order and has a long history of changes in usage and design.|$|E
5|$|Because of the hilly terrain, {{the station}} was built in a deep cutting {{excavated}} from Highgate Hill adjacent to Archway Road. Tunnels penetrated the hillside <b>at</b> <b>each</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the station, leading towards East Finchley {{to the north and}} Crouch End to the south. When built, the station had two side platforms, with three tracks between them, and a station building on the south side. A footbridge linked the two platforms.|$|E
5|$|Greathead had {{originally}} {{planned for the}} trains to be hauled {{by a pair of}} small electric locomotives, one <b>at</b> <b>each</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> a train, but the Board of Trade rejected this proposal and a larger locomotive was designed which was able to pull up to seven carriages on its own. Twenty-eight locomotives were manufactured in America by the General Electric Company (of which syndicate member Darius Ogden Mills was a director) and assembled in the Wood Lane depot. A fleet of 168 carriages was manufactured by the Ashbury Railway Carriage and Iron Company and the Brush Electrical Engineering Company. Passengers boarded and left the trains through folding lattice gates <b>at</b> <b>each</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the carriages; these gates were operated by guards who rode on an outside platform. The CLR {{had originally}} intended to have two classes of travel, but dropped the plan before opening, although its carriages were built with different qualities of interior fittings for this purpose.|$|E

25|$|The Jelapang and Ipoh South toll plazas were {{demolished}} in 2009 {{to make a}} non-stop route across Ipoh. This {{is achieved}} {{through the construction of}} two local-express lanes for each side, which are only accessible via Exit 138 Ipoh South Exit (for northbound traffic) and Exit 141 Ipoh North Exit (for southbound traffic). The toll plazas in Ipoh are therefore relocated <b>at</b> <b>each</b> <b>ends</b> <b>of</b> the local-express lanes.|$|R
25|$|For {{the past}} program, {{the third and}} fourth cars, {{coloured}} in green were even more radical in the reconfiguration, with all but eight parts <b>of</b> seats, four <b>at</b> <b>each</b> <b>ends</b> <b>of</b> the car removed completely. In its place was standing room with upholstered cushion, in an attempt to provide a degree of comfort to passengers standing in that space. This design proved to be unpopular with the commuters, and it was eventually dropped. The original seats between the 1st and 2nd door, and the 3rd and 4th door on these cars have been replaced. The remaining upholstered seats were reverted to original seats in May 2006. All C151 trains had their seats on the middle part of carriage removed.|$|R
5|$|In the 1950s, roundabouts were {{constructed}} <b>at</b> <b>each</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> The Causeway, {{to improve the}} flow of traffic on the bridges {{and the distribution of}} traffic back into the road network. The roundabout at the eastern end, connecting with Great Eastern Highway, opened in 1952. In 1973 construction began on upgrading that intersection to a grade-separated partial cloverleaf interchange. The interchange opened on 8 March 1974, having cost AUS$1.3 million.|$|E
5|$|Irwin {{developed}} and patented a football scoreboard, {{which was in}} use in the Ivy League by the 1890s. The large scoreboard featured a miniature representation of a football field, and the ball moved along the board to report each play. By 1915, Irwin's scoreboards were featured <b>at</b> <b>each</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> {{the field for the}} Army-Navy game at the Polo Grounds.|$|E
5|$|There {{are flat}} {{junctions}} <b>at</b> <b>each</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the station: Herne Hill North Junction, where the lines to Loughborough Junction and Brixton diverge; and Herne Hill South Junction, where the lines to West Dulwich and Tulse Hill diverge. Thameslink and Southeastern services cross each other's paths at the junctions, constraining capacity on both routes. The station {{also has a}} turnback siding on its eastern side, adjacent to Milkwood Road.|$|E
5000|$|Double acting {{cylinders}} have a port <b>at</b> <b>each</b> <b>end</b> or side <b>of</b> the piston, {{supplied with}} hydraulic fluid {{for both the}} retraction and extension.|$|R
50|$|The {{main line}} is in {{use at the}} present day (except for the {{terminals}} <b>at</b> <b>each</b> <b>end)</b> as part <b>of</b> the Dundee to Aberdeen main line.|$|R
50|$|Another German company, Hohenzollern, built some {{articulated}} fireless steam locomotives with a cab <b>at</b> <b>each</b> <b>end.</b> Only one <b>of</b> the bogies was powered, {{making the}} wheel arrangement B-2.|$|R
5|$|Unusually for a Thames bridge, {{only three}} of Chiswick Bridge's five spans cross the river; the shorter spans <b>at</b> <b>each</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the bridge cross the former towpaths. To allow {{sufficient}} clearance for shipping without steep inclines, the approach roads to the bridge are elevated from some distance back from the river.|$|E
5|$|A change {{occurred}} {{in the game and}} the role of the goalkeeper in the 1880s, when the Scottish reduced the size of the scoring area by placing rugby posts, spaced about 10 feet apart, <b>at</b> <b>each</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the pool. At the same time, the rules were changed to allow goalkeepers to stand on the pool deck and leap onto the head of an opposing player who approached the goal. This change in the rules was brief. To prevent the serious injuries that resulted from this method of goalkeeping, the rules were revised again to require the goalie to remain in the water.|$|E
5|$|Each train {{consists}} of six cars, {{from front to}} back: IM, CM, TTC, TT, CM and IM. The IM class carriages <b>at</b> <b>each</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the train are powered and fitted with a driver's compartment. The CM class is a powered passenger car. Class TTC is unpowered, it {{is equipped with a}} pantograph and a restaurant. The TT class is an unpowered passenger car which has also a pantograph on its roof. Each of the powered carriages is fitted with one motor on each of the two bogies. If needed, two trains can be coupled together.|$|E
5000|$|The [...] and [...] of {{a muscle}} {{are the two}} places where it is anchored, one <b>at</b> <b>each</b> <b>end.</b> The tissue <b>of</b> the {{attachment}} is called an enthesis.|$|R
50|$|The Church of England parish {{church of}} Saint Mary the Virgin {{is unusual in}} having a tower <b>at</b> <b>each</b> <b>end,</b> one <b>of</b> which has a spire. It {{is one of only}} three parish churches in England with both a spire and another tower. The other two are at nearby Wanborough, Wiltshire, and Ormskirk, Lancashire.|$|R
5000|$|Crocodile (German Krokodil) {{electric}} locomotives are so called {{because they have}} long [...] "noses" [...] <b>at</b> <b>each</b> <b>end,</b> reminiscent <b>of</b> the snout of a crocodile (see also Steeplecab). These contain the motors and drive axles, and are connected by an articulated center section. The center section usually contains the crew compartments, pantographs and transformer.|$|R
5|$|Except for its two stations—one <b>at</b> <b>each</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the tunnel—the line ran entirely underground. The {{line was}} built {{in less than three}} months, and on its {{completion}} in 1936 was one of the shortest independent railway lines in the country. It was open for only three years before being converted to a major air-raid shelter during World War II. After the war's end, it {{was not included in the}} 1948 nationalisation of British railways but remained in private hands.|$|E
5|$|Following the 15th century Reformation when {{clerical}} {{marriage was}} permitted, larger households {{would have been}} required {{and as a result}} some of the houses were altered and combined by knocking through walls, into larger dwellings. Others had extensions built to the rear. Water supply was originally from two wells, one <b>at</b> <b>each</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the close. By 1468 lead pipes had been installed to bring water into the houses, although the wells continued to function until the 19th century. Number 22 is the house which still has most of its original medieval structure as it was originally built.|$|E
5|$|On 6 July 1950, the Queen Mother {{travelled}} {{the line}} {{as far as}} Cranbrook when she visited the National Sanatorium at Benenden. The five-coach Royal Train was pulled by a Maunsell E1 class 4-4-0 No. 31067, Her Majesty using a Pullman car named Malaga, which was flanked by two corridor composites; there was a corridor third brake <b>at</b> <b>each</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the train. Malaga was one of six twelve-wheel first-class kitchen cars which had been built in 1920–1; and following an extensive refit in late 1949, was occasionally used in the Royal Train. It was withdrawn in 1961, and is preserved close to Shepperton railway station.|$|E

Ventrally yellowish, usually powdered or dotted with brown; a brown spot <b>at</b> <b>each</b> outer <b>end</b> <b>of</b> anterior ventrals.|$|R
5|$|Roundabouts were {{constructed}} <b>at</b> <b>each</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> The Causeway, {{to improve the}} flow of traffic on the bridges {{and the distribution of}} traffic back into the road network. The eastern roundabout opened in 1952, while the western one did not open until December 1954. Guides on the usage of the roundabouts were published in newspapers. In 1973 construction began on a grade-separated partial cloverleaf interchange at the eastern end of the Causeway. The $1.3 million interchange opened on 8 March 1974.|$|E
5|$|The {{bridge was}} still under {{construction}} in January 1928, {{and at that time}} the estimated date of completion was only a month away. The bridge finally opened to traffic on 14 April. The official opening of the bridge by the NSW Governor Dudley de Chair occurred on 10 July, and was celebrated by the cutting of the ribbon and an opening of the gates <b>at</b> <b>each</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the lift span. In return he was presented with a silver cigarette case.|$|E
5|$|The {{carriages}} operated as electric {{multiple unit}} trains without separate locomotives. Passengers boarded {{and left the}} trains through folding lattice gates <b>at</b> <b>each</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> cars; these gates were operated by gate-men who rode on an outside platform and announced station names as trains arrived. The design was subsequently used for the GNP and the CCE, and became known on the Underground as the 1906 stock or Gate stock. Trains for the line were stabled at the London Road depot south of Kennington Road station.|$|E
50|$|Caracas F.C. and U.A. Maracaibo {{ended with}} one {{championship}} <b>each</b> <b>at</b> the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the Apertura and Clausura. Tournament rules establish that {{a playoff game}} is required.|$|R
5000|$|The show {{began with}} the duo {{shooting}} straight {{up in the air}} from apparatuses <b>at</b> <b>each</b> <b>ends</b> <b>of</b> the stage, which had a sci-fi design. Hubbard and Kelley kicked off the show with [...] "Every Night" [...] and [...] "Smile", two non-singles from their current album, and ended the night with their smash hit [...] "Cruise". During the show they went into an acoustic setup for [...] "Dirt". Tyler Hubbard has said he thinks about his father in heaven when they sing that song, so towards the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> it, during the New York City show he called out, [...] "From MSG to Heaven." [...] Opening acts Thomas Rhett and Frankie joined Florida Georgia Line for [...] "Party People". They sang medley of covers which included songs such as Meghan Trainor's [...] "All About That Bass" [...] and Garth Brooks's [...] "Friends in Low Places".|$|R

5|$|The design {{incorporated}} many novel features, {{such as the}} use of thermic siphons, bogies and cabs <b>at</b> <b>each</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the locomotive, {{resulting in}} its unique—for a steam locomotive—modern diesel-like appearance. Several of its innovations proved to be unsuccessful however, partly accounting for the project's cancellation in the early 1950s. Five Leader locomotives were begun, although only one was completed. The operational locomotive was trialled on the former Southern Railway network around Brighton. Problems with the design, indifferent reports on performance and political pressure surrounding spiralling development costs, led to all locomotives of the class being scrapped by 1951.|$|E
5|$|The {{service was}} {{provided}} by a fleet of carriages manufactured for the UERL by the American Car and Foundry Company and assembled at Trafford Park in Manchester. These carriages were built to the same design used for the BS and the GNP and operated as electric multiple unit trains {{without the need for}} separate locomotives. Passengers boarded the trains via folding lattice gates <b>at</b> <b>each</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> cars which were operated by Gate-men who rode on the outside platform and announced station names as trains arrived. The design became known on the Underground as the 1906 stock or Gate stock.|$|E
