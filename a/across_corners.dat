6000|$|... "How {{many houses}} now have character-personality? Most people let the {{different}} dealers choose for them, as it is. Why {{not let the}} Standard Household-Effect Company, and finally the state? I am sure that either would choose much more wisely than people choose for themselves, in the few cases where they even seem to choose for themselves. In most interiors the appointments are without fitness, taste, or sense; they are the mere accretions of accident in the greater number of cases; where they {{are the result of}} design, they are worse. I see what you mean by character and personality in them. You mean the sort of madness that let itself loose a few years ago in what was called household art, and has since gone to make the junk-shops hideous. Each of the eternal-womanly was supposed suddenly to have acquired a talent for decoration and a gift for the selection and arrangement of furniture, and each began to stamp herself upon our interiors. One painted a high-shouldered stone bottle with a stork and stood it at the right corner of the mantel on a scarf; another gilded the bottle and stood it at the left corner, and tied the scarf through its handle. One knotted a ribbon around the arm of a chair; another knotted it around the leg. In a day, an hour, a moment, the chairs suddenly became angular, cushionless, springless; and the sofas were stood <b>across</b> <b>corners,</b> or parallel with the fireplace, in slants expressive of the personality of the presiding genius. The walls became all frieze and dado; and instead of the simple and dignified ugliness of the impersonal period our interiors abandoned themselves to a hysterical chaos, full of character. Some people had their doors painted black, and the daughter or mother of the house then decorated them with morning-glories. I saw such a door in a house I looked at the other day, thinking I might hire it. The sight of that black door and its morning- glories made me wish to turn aside and live with the cattle, as Walt Whitman says. No, the less we try to get personality and character into our household effects the more beautiful and interesting they will be. As soon as we put the Standard Household-Effect Company in possession and render it a relentless monopoly, it will corrupt a competent architect and decorator in each of our large towns and cities, and when you hire a new house these will be sent to advise with the eternal-womanly concerning its appointments, and tell her what she wants, and what she will like; for at present the eternal womanly, as soon as she has got a thing she wants, begins to hate it. The company's agents will begin by convincing her that she does not need half the things she has lumbered up her house with, and that every useless thing is an ugly thing, even in the region of pure aesthetics. I once asked an Italian painter if he did not think a certain nobly imagined drawing-room was fine, and he said 'SI. Ma troppa roba.' There were too many rugs, tables, chairs, sofas, pictures; vases, statues, chandeliers. 'Troppa roba' is the vice of all our household furnishing, and it will be the death of the eternal-womanly if it is not stopped. But the corrupt agents of a giant monopoly will teach the eternal-womanly something of the wise simplicity of the South, and she will end by returning to the ideal of housekeeping as it prevails among the Latin races, whom it began with, whom civilization began with. What of a harmless, necessary moth or two, or even a few fleas?" ...|$|E

40|$|An ultra {{precision}} large optics grinding machine, BoX®, {{was developed}} and produced at Cranfield University. BoX® offers a rapid and economic solution for grinding large off-axis aspherical and free-form optical components. Grinding high accuracy surfaces with low subsurface damage reduces subsequent polishing time. This efficient grinding process provides the capacity to grind 1. 5 m parts. This paper presents an analysis of Astrositall® optical ground parts: a hexagonal 84 m radius of curvature mirror of 1 m <b>across</b> <b>corners</b> and an off-axis 350 mm diameter mirror. The 1 m hexagonal part is representative of segments under study for making extremely large telescope (ELT) segmented mirrors. The second part was machined off-axis to demonstrate free-form fabrication capability. These operations demonstrate the scalability of the rapid grinding process developed for large free-form optics. The use of an error compensation procedure improved an initial ground form accuracy to +/- 1 μm p-v over 1 metre surface. The results highlighted the effect of grinding parameters and machine dynamics on form accuracy and fabrication...|$|E

40|$|In today’s leading-edge {{semiconductor}} technologies, it {{is increasingly}} difficult for ICdesigners to achieve sufficient improvements of performance, power and area metrics in theirnext-generation products. One root cause of this difficulty is the increased margins that are usedin the design process to guardband for (i) variability and aging, as well as (ii) analysis inaccuracies. Currently, these margins incur huge costs to design companies, because the benefits bydeploying the next technology node is only approximately 20 % in circuit performance, powerand density. To reduce margins, fast and accurate pathfinding of architecture, technology andconstraints choices are essential. A second root cause is the high cost (and, therefore, limitedsupply) of electronic design automation tool licenses, accompanied {{by the lack of}} any systematicmethodology to optimize the use of available tools within long-duration, highly iterative designprocesses. This constrains designers to perform only limited design-space exploration, so as to keep within limits on design infrastructure cost and design turnaround time. This thesis presentsnew techniques to reduce guardbands in optimization loops in the IC design process by using fastand accurate learning-based models. These techniques can be grouped into three main thrusts:(i) productivity through improved design- and implementation-space exploration; (ii) improvedaccuracy of electrical modeling and enablement of auxiliary physical design optimizations; and(iii) design power, energy, management and cost optimizations. In the productivity through improved design- and implementation-space explorationthrust, this thesis presents four applications of learning-based models for accurate predictionof area, power, timing and routability. To enable area and power estimation of Networks-on-Chip routers, so that architecture-level (RTL-level) design-space exploration can be efficientperformed, this thesis presents an open-source tool, ORION 3. 0, that has been released on theweb. In the improved accuracy of electrical modeling and enablement of auxiliary physicaldesign optimizations thrust, this thesis presents new methodologies to perform high-dimensionallearning-based modeling of delay, transition time and slack in timing paths. A methodology todevelop accurate models of post-routing optimization of signal delays at multiple signoff corners,so as to enable a new optimization of clock skew variation <b>across</b> <b>corners</b> is also described. In the design power, energy, management and cost optimizations thrust, this thesispresents three distinct works that directly benefit leading-edge SoC design companies. The firstwork describes a new analytic three-dimensional placement tool using a new objective functionthat achieves significant wirelength and power reduction relative to two-dimensional implementations. The second work provides two mixed integer-linear programs for optimal multi-project,multi-resource allocation with task precedence and resource co-constraints for IC design managementand cost reduction. The third work presents a maximum-value, reliability-constrainedoverdrive frequencies problem that guarantees prescribed lower bounds on acceptable performanceand acceptable throughput in multicore systems, without exceeding prescribed lifetimebudget for any core...|$|E

40|$|International audienceIn this paper, a {{systematic}} design methodology is proposed {{to design a}} triangular wave generator circuit. Using this methodology, various oscillation frequencies can be obtained in a shorter design time. Furthermore, the variations in the oscillation frequency are controlled <b>across</b> all process <b>corners.</b> The proposed methodology employs a transistor sizing and biasing CAD tool called CHAMS, in which the sizes and biases of each transistor are performed to meet the required DC operating points. <b>Across</b> all process <b>corners,</b> the error in the oscillation frequency can be controlled by changing the trimming current. Simulations <b>across</b> nine <b>corners</b> are done to estimate the error in frequency. The condition to pass the design is to guarantee that for each process corner, {{at least one of}} the trimming combination sets the oscillation frequency within the specified limits. The methodology is applied for different arbitrary values of frequencies 1 MHz, 2 MHz, and 4 MHz with a maximum error of ± 3 %...|$|R
