40|$|Worldwide, 3 {{billion people}} {{are at risk of}} {{hookworm}} infection, particularly in resource-poor countries. While control of soil-transmitted helminthiases relies mostly on chemotherapy, only few drugs are available and concern about potential emergence of drug resistance is rising. In the present study, tribendimidine, a derivative of <b>amidantel,</b> and its metabolites deacylated <b>amidantel</b> (dADT) and acetylated deacylated <b>amidantel</b> (AdADT) were tested in vitro and in vivo against Heligmosomoides bakeri and Ancylostoma ceylanicum, two hookworm rodent models, alone or in combination with standard drugs. Tribendimidine achieved IC(50) s 88 mug/ml). In vivo at single oral doses of 10 mg/kg, dADT showed a slightly higher efficacy than tribendimidine, achieving worm burden reductions of 87. 4 % and 74. 8 %, respectively. At the same dose, AdADT reduced the worm burden by 57. 9 %. Synergistic interactions were observed with tribendimidine-levamisole combinations against A. ceylanicum in vitro (combination index at IC(50) = 0. 5), and in vivo (combination index at ED(90) = 0. 19). In conclusion, tribendimidine and dADT show potent anti-hookworm properties. The potential of the promising tribendimidine-levamisole combination should be investigated in greater detai...|$|E
40|$|Background: The genus Trichuris {{includes}} parasites {{of major}} relevance in veterinary and human medicine. Despite serious economic losses and enormous impact on public health, treatment options against whipworms are very limited. Additionally, {{there is an}} obvious lack of appropriately characterized experimental infection models. Therefore, a detailed parasitological characterization of a Trichuris muris isolate was performed in C 57 BL/ 10 mice. Subsequently, the in vivo efficacies of the aminophenylamidines <b>amidantel,</b> deacylated <b>amidantel</b> (dAMD) and tribendimidine {{as well as the}} cyclooctadepsipeptides emodepside and in particular PF 1022 A were analyzed. This was performed using various administration routes and treatment schemes targeting histotropic and further developed larval as well as immature and mature adult stages. Methodology/Principal Findings: Duration of prepatent period, time-dependent localization of larvae during period of prepatency as well as the duration of patency of the infection were determined before drugs were tested in the characterized trichurosis model. <b>Amidantel</b> showed no effect against mature adult T. muris. Tribendimidine showed significantly higher potency than dAMD after oral treatments (ED 50 values of 6. 5 vs. 15. 1 mg/kg). However, the opposite was found for intraperitoneal treatments (ED 50 values of 15. 3 vs. 8. 3 mg/kg). When emodepside and PF 1022 A were compared, the latter was significantly less effective against mature adults following intraperitoneal (ED 50 values of 6. 1 vs. 55. 7 mg/kg...|$|E

Only minimal differences were observed following oral administration (ED 50 values of 2. 7 vs. 5. 2 mg/kg). Triple and most single oral doses with moderate to high dosages of PF 1022 A showed complete efficacy against histotropic second stage larvae (3 × 100 mg/kg or 1 × 250 mg/kg), further developed larvae (3 × 10 mg/kg or 1 × 100 mg/kg) and immature adults (3 × 10 mg/kg or 1 × 100 mg/kg). Histotropic first stage larvae were only eliminated after three doses of PF 1022 A (3 × 100 mg/kg) but not after a single dose. These results indicate that the cyclooctadepsipeptides are a drug class with promising candidates for further evaluation for the treatment of trichurosis of humans and livestock animals in single dose regimens...|$|E
40|$|The {{cholinergic}} {{class of}} anthelmintic drugs {{is used for}} the control of parasitic nematodes. One of this class of drugs, tribendimidine (a symmetrical diamidine derivative, of <b>amidantel),</b> was developed in China for use in humans in the mid- 1980 s. It has a broader-spectrum an-thelmintic action against soil-transmitted helminthiasis than other cholinergic anthelmintics, and is effective against hookworm, pinworms, roundworms, and Strongyloides and flat-worm of humans. Although molecular studies on C. elegans suggest that tribendimidine is a cholinergic agonist that is selective for the same nematode muscle nAChR as levamisole, no direct electrophysiological observations in nematode parasites have been made to test this hypothesis. Also the hypothesis that levamisole and tribendimine act on the same re-ceptor, does not explain why tribendimidine is effective against some nematode parasites when levamisole is not. Here we examine the effects of tribendimidine on the electrophysiol-ogy and contraction of Ascaris suum body muscle and show that tribendimidine produces depolarization antagonized by the nicotinic antagonist mecamylamine, and that tribendimi-dine is an agonist of muscle nAChRs of parasitic nematodes.

40|$|Tribendimidine {{has emerged}} as {{potential}} alternative to praziquantel {{in the treatment of}} Opisthorchis viverrini infections. To support its clinical development program, a quantitative high performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS/MS) assay was developed for tribendimidine's degradation product deacylated <b>amidantel</b> (dADT) and its acetylated metabolite adADT. Analytical sample preparation included protein precipitation for blood and plasma, and direct processing of dried blood spots (DBS). The analytes were detected by multiple reaction monitoring with electrospray ionization in the positive mode (dADT: 178. 3 → 133. 1 m/z, adADT: 220. 4 → 175. 1 m/z, tribendimidine 294. 3 → 249. 0 m/z). A pentafluorophenyl (PFP) phase Kinetex analytical column (2. 6 μm, 100 Å, 50 mm× 4. 6 mm) with a 6 min lasting mobile phase gradient program of ammonium acetate and acetonitrile was applied. The method was validated with respect to precision, accuracy, linearity, sensitivity, and selectivity. The analytical range in plasma and blood was 1 - 1000 ng/ml and in DBS 10 - 2000 ng/ml (R(2) < 0. 99). Recoveries determined using four different human blood batches were in the range of 70 - 90 %. Inter- and intra-assay accuracy and precision deviations were at least ≤ 12. 2 %. dADT and adADT were stable within the autosampler for 72 h (10 °C), for 4 h at room temperature, for 3 month at - 80 °C, and after three freeze and thaw cycles. DBS samples should be stored at - 20 °C. The validation results demonstrated that the LC-MS/MS method is precise, accurate and selective and can be applied for pharmacokinetic studies with tribendimidine...|$|E
40|$|There is {{pressing}} need for alternative treatments against the liver fluke Opisthorchis viverrini Oral tribendimidine is a promising candidate, but its population pharmacokinetic properties are unknown. Two phase IIa trials {{were conducted in}} Laos in O. viverrini-infected adults receiving single oral doses of 25 - 600 mg tribendimidine, administered as different formulations in each study (study 1 used 200 mg tablets; study 2 used 50 mg tablets). Venous whole-blood, plasma and capillary dried blood spots were sampled frequently from 68 adults and concentrations of tribendimidine metabolites dADT (deacetylated <b>amidantel)</b> and adADT (acetylated dADT) were measured. Population pharmacokinetics were assessed using nonlinear mixed-effects modeling. The relationship between drug exposure and cure (assessed 21 days post-treatment) was evaluated using univariable logistic regression. A six-transit compartment absorption model with a one-disposition compartment for each metabolite described the data well. Compared to the 50 mg formulation (study 2), the 200 mg formulation (study 1) had 40. 1 % higher mean transit absorption time, 113 % higher dADT volume of distribution, and 364 % higher adADT volume of distribution. Each ten year increase in age was associated with 12. 7 % lower dADT clearance and 21. 2 % lower adADT clearance. Highest cure rates (≥ 55 %) were observed with doses ≥ 100 mg. Higher dADT, but not adADT, peak concentrations and exposures were associated with cure (p= 0. 004 and 0. 003, respectively).

40|$|Muscle tension {{recordings}} {{were made}} from earthworm body wall muscle and the action of acetylcholine, cholinomimtics and cholinolytics examined. The effect of cholinergic agents on muscle twitches induced following field stimulation was also investigated. Carbachol was 8 times more active than acetylcholine {{in the presence of}} physostigmine. ?-Bungarotoxin, d-tubocurarine, gallamine, atropine, mecamylamine and hexamethonium reduced both electrical stimulation of the muscle and the acetylcholine response while ?-bungarotoxin reduced the electrically induced twitch but enhanced the acetylcholine contraction. 0. 4 wM Hemicholinium abolished the electrically induced twitch while having no effect on the acetylcholine response, but at 4. 0 uiM, did reduce the acetylcholine response. These results provide further evidence for cholinergic excitatory innervation of earthworm body wall muscle. Intracellular recordings {{were made from}} identifiable central neurones of Helix aspersa and the action of anthelmintic compounds investigated. The anthelmintics pyrantel, morantel and deacylated <b>amidantel</b> mimicked acetylcholine induced excitation"D" and inhibition"H" had the same ionic mechanism and were blocked by d-tubocurarine. This suggests these compounds interact with acetylcholine receptors on Helix neurones. Levamisole only inhibited the activity. A series of glutamate analogues was tested on Helix neurones which were either excited or inhibited by Lglutamate. The only analogue with clear glutamate- 1 ike activity was thio-glutamic acid. In normal saline Lglutamate hyperpolarises the membrane potential of cell F- 1. This event is chloride mediated and is reversed to a depolarisation followed by hyperpolarisation in low external chloride. This afterhyperpolarisation is reduced in sodium or potassium free saline or following application of strophanthidin, l. O-lOOyM. The local anaesthetics procaine and tetracaine mimicked the "H" and "D" effects of acetylcholine on certain neurones. Tetracaine, O. OlyM, gradually and reversibly reduced both "H" and "D" responses of acetylcholine and the "H" response to dopamine. This provides evidence that local anaesthetics can interact with responses linked to chloride, sodium and potassium ion channels...|$|E
40|$|Praziquantel is {{the only}} drug {{available}} {{for the treatment of}} Opisthorchis viverrini infections. Tribendimidine has emerged as a potential treatment alternative; however, its pharmacokinetic (PK) properties have not been sufficiently studied to date. Via two phase IIa dose-finding studies, 68 O. viverrini patients were treated with 25 - to 600 -mg doses of tribendimidine using 50 - and 200 -mg tablet formulations. Plasma, blood, and dried blood spots (DBS) were sampled at selected time points. The two main metabolites of tribendimidine, active deacetylated <b>amidantel</b> (dADT) and acetylated dADT (adADT), were analyzed in plasma, blood, and DBS. PK parameters were estimated by noncompartmental analysis. An acceptable agreement among plasma and DBS concentrations was observed, with a mean bias of ≤ 10 %, and 60 % dADT and 74 % adADT concentrations being within ± 20 % margins. We found that 200 -mg tribendimidine tablets possess immediate floating characteristics, which led to variable time to maximal concentration of drug (Tmax) values (2 to 24 h) between individuals. Dose proportionality was observed for dADT from 25 to 200 mg using 50 -mg tablets, but at higher dosages (200 to 600 mg), saturation occurred. The median ratio of the area under the plasma concentration-time curve from 0 to 24 h (AUC 0 - 24) of dADT to the AUC 0 - 24 of adADT ranged from 0. 8 to 26. 4, suggesting substantial differences in acetylation rates. Cure rates ranged from 11 % (25 -mg dose) to 100 % (400 -mg dose). Cured patients showed significantly higher dADT maximal serum concentrations (Cmax) and AUC 0 - 24 values than uncured patients. Tribendimidine is a promising drug for the treatment of opisthorchiasis. However, the tablet formulation should be optimized to achieve consistent absorption among patients. Further studies are warranted to assess the large differences between individuals in the rate of metabolic turnover of dADT to adADT.

40|$|The anthelminthic drug tribendimidine {{has been}} {{approved}} by Chinese authorities for human use in 2004, and a first comprehensive review was published in Acta Tropica in 2005. Here, we summarise further advances made through additional clinical trials and laboratory investigations. Two phase IV trials have been conducted in the People's Republic of China, the first one enrolling 1292 adolescents and adults aged 15 - 70 years and the second one conducted with 899 children aged 4 - 14 years who were infected with one or multiple species of soil-transmitted helminths. Oral tribendimidine (single 400 mg enteric-coated tablet given to adolescents/adults and 200 mg to children) showed high cure rates against Ascaris lumbricoides (90. 1 - 95. 0 %) and moderate-to-high cure rates against hookworm (82. 0 - 88. 4 %). Another trial done in school-aged children using a rigorous diagnostic approach found a cure rate against hookworm of 76. 5 %. A single oral dose of tribendimidine showed only low cure rates against Trichuris trichiura (23. 9 - 36. 8 %) confirming previous results. Tribendimidine administered to children infected with Enterobius vermicularis (two doses of 200 mg each on consecutive days) resulted in a high cure rate (97. 1 %). Importantly, a series of randomised, exploratory trials revealed that tribendimidine shows interesting activity against the liver flukes Opisthorchis viverrini and Clonorchis sinensis, the tapeworm Taenia spp. and the threadworm Strongyloides stercoralis with respective cure rates of 70. 0 %, 40. 0 %, 53. 3 % and 36. 4 %. Pharmacokinetic studies in healthy Chinese volunteers indicated that after oral administration of tribendimidine, no parent drug was detected in plasma, but its primary metabolite, p-(1 -dimethylamino ethylimino) aniline (aminoamidine, deacylated <b>amidantel)</b> (dADT), was found in plasma. dADT is then further metabolised to acetylated dADT (AdADT). dADT exhibits activity against several species of hookworm and C. sinensis in experimental studies, similar that of tribendimidine. First studies elucidating the mechanism of action suggested that tribendimidine is an L-type nicotinic acetylcholine receptor agonist. Additional experimental studies revealed that the anti-parasite spectrum of tribendimidine is very broad. Indeed, to date, activity has been documented against 20 different nematode, trematode and cestode species. Taken together, tribendimidine warrants further scientific inquiry, including more comprehensive toxicity appraisals, mechanism of action studies and clinical investigation as it holds promise as a broad spectrum anthelminthics...|$|E
