5|$|Following {{the success}} of <b>A</b> <b>Moment</b> <b>with</b> You, Wong Fu was {{approached}} to create a second film called Sleep Shift. However, the project was abandoned after producers disagreed with casting an Asian male in the film's lead role. Since {{the end of its}} first tour, Wong Fu has created music videos for rising artists and continued producing short films. The group's merchandise line, which included original T-shirt designs, was launched in conjunction with the 2007 film Just a Nice Guy. The short film The Spare was featured at the 2008 San Francisco International Asian American Film Festival, and two additional short films—At Musing's End and A Peace of Home—were shown at the 2009 Cannes Film Festival Short Films Corner. In September 2009, Wong Fu released the short film Poser!, a mockumentary {{on the history of the}} peace sign.|$|E
5|$|Hill {{had a bad}} {{start from}} pole position, {{allowing}} Schumacher to overtake him into turnone. Panis, who started from tenthposition in a Ligier, spun at the firstcorner after a nudge from Katayama, hitting {{the wall in the}} process and retiring from the race. Herbert, racing the spare Benetton chassis, dropped three places by the end of lapone, dropping behind Häkkinen and the two Ferrari cars. Blundell also made a poor start, dropping to fourteenth position after his gearbox changed from first to third gear as he accelerated away from the grid. At {{the end of the first}} lap, the race order was Schumacher leading Hill, from Coulthard, Häkkinen, Berger, Alesi, Herbert, Irvine, Katayama and Salo, with the two Tyrrell drivers switching places on the next lap. At the start of lapthree, Hill attempted to overtake Schumacher heading into turnfive, but Schumacher closed the door on Hill. Hill lost the advantage for <b>a</b> <b>moment,</b> <b>with</b> teammate Coulthard drawing alongside, but unable to get past with Hill on the inside line into turnsix. Henceforth, Schumacher and Hill began to gradually pull away from Coulthard, who realised that he could not match the pace of the leaders and settled into his own rhythm, albeit one that was still comfortably faster than the cars behind him. By lapfive, Herbert had dropped down to tenthposition, unhappy with the handling of the spare car and having been overtaken by Irvine, Salo and Katayama. On lapten, Schumacher lapped last-placed Diniz for the first time; the presence of slower cars a constant factor for the front-runners thereafter. On the same lap Frentzen retired from 12thposition with electrical failure. He was joined by Schiattarella two laps later after his Simtek car developed a steering problem. Irvine made a pit stop earlier than expected on lapfifteen, retiring from the race with a gearbox actuator problem. On the same lap, Katayama spun at the fourthcorner, stalled his car in the process and retired from the race. The two retirements meant Herbert moved back up to eighth position. Alesi was the first of the leading drivers to make a scheduled pit stop on lap17, rejoining the track in eleventh place. Barrichello, Irvine's teammate, retired a lap later, driving into the pit lane slowly with a gearbox problem. On the same lap, Verstappen retired his Simtek car with a clutch problem.|$|E

Later in the show, Hogan shared <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> <b>with</b> Mr. T, Paul Orndorff and Roddy Piper, with whom he main evented the first WrestleMania.|$|E

500|$|<b>A</b> <b>Moment</b> <b>with</b> You, the group's first feature-length film, premiered on June 3, 2006, {{at their}} alma mater. It was also {{screened}} at the San Diego Asian Film Festival on October 18, 2006. The film revolves around two neighbors who share similar romantic situations, {{in which one}} person in each relationship cannot {{let go of his}} or her past. [...] "A Moment with You" [...] was promoted through a screening tour at high schools and universities around the United States and Canada. In a review for the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's student newspaper The Tech, Tina Ro wrote, [...] "Despite its large Asian fan base, Wongfu's [...] movie has a cast of equal numbers of Asians and Caucasians. Furthermore, all the characters were shaped by their own characteristics rather than by their race, a refreshing concept for a movie." [...] According to The Daily Texans Katherine Fan, <b>A</b> <b>Moment</b> <b>with</b> You featured a [...] "more mature, introspective mood than their previous work." ...|$|E
500|$|Celebrity Marilyn Monroe is {{mentioned}} numerous times throughout the song, including the famous quote [...] "I'm selfish, impatient {{and a little}} insecure. I make mistakes, I am {{out of control and}} at times hard to handle. But if you can't handle me at my worst, then you sure as hell don't deserve me at my best." [...] However, it has never been confirmed that Monroe actually said this. Minaj liked the track, as [...] "it spoke to me as a woman. I'm very infatuated with Marilyn Monroe. I had <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> <b>with</b> that song where I was like, 'Oh my God, every woman in this world needs to hear that'. No, we're not perfect. Sometimes, we think, 'What's wrong with us?' We spend so much time criticizing ourselves. I needed to hear that, 'I'm not perfect, but I'm worth it'. It resonated with me. I felt like the world needed to hear it." ...|$|E

2500|$|In a {{newspaper}} interview with The Memphis Press Scimitar, Elvis himself was open about the close relationship to his mother. [...] "She was the number-one girl in his life, {{and he was}} dedicating his career to her." [...] Throughout her life, [...] "the son would call her by pet names," [...] and they communicated by baby talk. Presley even shared his mother's bed [...] "up until Elvis was a young teen," [...] simply because the family was so extremely poor that they couldn't afford the luxury of two beds. According to Elaine Dundy, [...] "it was agony for her to leave her child even for <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> <b>with</b> anyone else, to let anyone else touch Elvis." [...] Presley himself said, [...] "My mama never let me out of her sight. I couldn't {{go down to the}} creek with the other kids." [...] His father, Vernon Presley, talked about Elvis's close relationship to his mother [...] "after his son became famous, almost {{as if it were a}} source of wonder that anyone could be that close." ...|$|E
2500|$|Talking {{about the}} episode showing Kat's lover {{providing}} them with a flat to use, an EastEnders source told Inside Soap that Kat tries to resist him, but although she knows it is wrong, she cannot help herself. They said the flat [...] "really elavates things to a new level. This isn't just a dalliance any more—it's a full blown affair!" [...] Later, Alfie finds {{a key to the}} flat, about which a show source said, [...] "It's a foolish mistake, and it could well end up being Kat's undoing. With Alfie in possession of this key, the man can't get access to the flat—and if Alfie spots Kat with the same key, he'll be stunned." [...] It was reported that the first suspect would be eliminated in the week of 4 August 2012, with an insider saying [...] "There'll be <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> <b>with</b> the penny drops—and we'll all cry 'It isn't him!' It'll be a very simple moment, but utterly conclusive." [...] They added, [...] "at least eliminating someone at this stage will shorten the odds on the other four candidates. The intrigue is intense!". All About Soap said that viewers would be [...] "stunned". Ray was eliminated in the episode broadcast on 7 August. In mid-August, Newman said that the identity of Kat's lover would be revealed [...] "in the coming weeks".|$|E
