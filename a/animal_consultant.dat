50|$|An <b>animal</b> {{behavior}} <b>consultant</b> is {{a practitioner}} of applied behavior analysis to help correct behavior problems in animals, usually companion <b>animals.</b> <b>Animal</b> behavior <b>consultants</b> are usually employed {{to identify the}} cause of a behavior problem, to develop an intervention plan to change the problem behavior, and to help the owners learn how to execute that plan. <b>Animal</b> behavior <b>consultants</b> are distinct from animal trainers, in that their primary goal is not to train an animal to have basic manners or to perform a task, such as agility competition for dogs, but to mitigate behaviors that are problems for the animal's owner. <b>Animal</b> behavior <b>consultants</b> may also be known as pet behavior counsellors or pet psychologists.|$|R

50|$|Rage Syndrome, {{also known}} as Sudden Onset Aggression or (SOA) or Avalanche of Rage Syndrome, is a rare but serious {{behavioural}} problem that has been reported most commonly in the English Springer Spaniel but also {{in a variety of}} other dog breeds. It is often misdiagnosed as it can be confused with other forms of aggression. It is thought to be genetic in origin and is inheritable. A variety of treatments are available, but will need to be tailored to the individual needs of the specific dog. The term rage syndrome is attributed to Dr. Roger A.

50|$|The {{issues that}} an <b>animal</b> {{behavior}} <b>consultant</b> will typically be {{called upon to}} address depend on the species of animal and its living situation. There are, however, some problems that are common to all species of companion animal. These include aggression towards other animals or humans, self-injury and stereotypies, phobias, isolation and separation-related stress behaviors, destructiveness, making excessive noise, and resource guarding. The kinds of behaviors that consultants are called in to address may not be ethologically abnormal for the animal; they may be inappropriate given the individual animal’s living situation and either undesirable from the client’s point of view, a cause of diminished welfare for the animal, or both.|$|R

40|$|Animal {{agriculture}} substantially {{contributes to}} the world economy by providing food, jobs, and financial security for billions of people. With increasing concerns over global climate change and pollution, efforts are underway to reduce the overall environmental impact of animal production. This document analyses emission of non-carbon dioxide greenhouse gases, an important segment of the environmental footprint of animal production. It has been developed by a team that included experts in animal/ruminant nutrition, manure and soil management, animal and whole-farm modeling, and animal reproduction. Over 900 publications focusing on nutritional and manure management mitigation strategies for methane (enteric or from manure) and nitrous oxide emissions were reviewed and analysed, and a synthesis of feed-, animal management- and manure management-based mitigation approaches and interactions amongst them has been presented. This document will help researchers, <b>animal</b> industry <b>consultants,</b> policy-makers, <b>animal</b> producers, non-governmental organizations, and other groups with interest in maintaining a viable and environmentally-responsible animal production sector to make sound decisions on selection and adoption of effective and economically feasible greenhouse gas mitigation practices. 1...|$|R
5000|$|In {{the late}} 1980s, League Executive Director Richard Course {{was fired from}} the League after he {{expressed}} views divergent from the League's mission. He had begun {{to spend some time}} with the mounted fox hunts as an outgrowth of his work. After a period of time talking with professional wildlife managers and hunt supporters, he concluded that: [...] "I find it repugnant that some people will kill another living creature for recreational purposes" [...] but said that the dogs easily outpace the fox within a minute or two and kill it within a second or two and that how the fox is located is [...] "totally irrelevant" [...] to animal welfare considerations. Richard Course has since denied that he supported hunting as a humane method of culling foxes. James Barrington, an ex-hunt saboteur then assumed Course's position within the League. Barrington later resigned stating that he concluded that an absolute ban on hunting was not in the best interests of animal welfare; he later joined the Countryside Alliance as an <b>Animal</b> Welfare <b>Consultant.</b> Barrington admits that he did not fully understand hunting and therefore could not fully condemn it.|$|R
40|$|Objectives Although {{theoretical}} conceptualisations {{of animal}} hoarding have been published, few empirical {{studies have been}} conducted. The current study investigated animal hoarding {{from the perspectives of}} professionals who come into contact with people who hoard animals through their employment in various capacities, primarily in animal welfare. Design A qualitative research design was employed using inductive thematic analysis. Methods Twelve professionals who had experience working in animal hoarding were interviewed. Participants’ professions included: mental health nurse, vet, <b>animal</b> behaviour <b>consultant,</b> <b>animal</b> inspector, animal warden and animal welfare officer. Participants reported working in a diverse range of locations across the UK. Semi-structured interviews were conducted either in person or over the telephone. Interviews were audio recorded and transcribed verbatim before analysis. Results Animal hoarding was conceptualised primarily by the presence of multiple animal neglect or suffering. The term ‘animal hoarding’ was used by participants to reflect those who are neglecting animals unintentionally, living in squalor, self-neglecting, experiencing distress or mental health problems, and using animals as a replacement for people. Animal hoarding appears to be maintained or repeated despite interventions from animal professionals, possibly because the human aspects of this issue are currently overlooked. Conclusions Better understanding and education, particularly on the human aspects of animal hoarding, are needed for both professionals and the public. Joint working and greater communication is needed in both directions between animal professionals and those working in mental health and social services. Practitioner Points • The findings suggest that animal hoarding should be given much greater attention, both clinically and in research, within the field of psychology. • There are social and mental health aspects of animal hoarding which are inadequately addressed by professionals in the UK currently. Animal professionals should be aware of psychological and social issues such as the mental capacity of individuals to make decisions about their animals. Social and psychological interventions should be offered to engage people who are hoarding animals, safeguard people living in animal hoarding situations, address social isolation or support network issues, relieve psychological distress from comorbid mental health problems, increase insight, and instigate behaviour change. • The current study is limited by the representation of only professional perspectives on animal hoarding. The perspectives of animal hoarders and their families are not represented. • There was a majority of animal professionals compared with mental health professionals interviewed in the current study which may have caused a paucity of information on the social and mental health aspects of animal hoarding and professional responses to this...|$|R

40|$|Antimicrobial use in {{farm animals}} might {{contribute}} to the development of antimicrobial resistance in humans and animals, and there is an urgent need to reduce antimicrobial use in farm animals. Veterinarians are typically responsible for prescribing and overseeing antimicrobial use in animals. A thorough understanding of veterinarians' current prescribing practices and their reasons to prescribe antimicrobials might offer leads for interventions to reduce antimicrobial use in farm animals. This paper presents the results of a qualitative study of factors that influence prescribing behaviour of farm animal veterinarians. Semi-structured interviews with eleven farm animal veterinarians were conducted, which were taped, transcribed and iteratively analysed. This preliminary analysis was further discussed and refined in an expert meeting. A final conceptual model was derived from the analysis and sent to all the respondents for validation. Many conflicting interests are identifiable when it comes to antimicrobial prescribing by farm animal veterinarians. Belief in the professional obligation to alleviate animal suffering, financial dependency on clients, risk avoidance, shortcomings in advisory skills, financial barriers for structural veterinary herd health advisory services, lack of farmers' compliance to veterinary recommendations, public health interests, personal beliefs regarding the veterinary contribution to antimicrobial resistance and major economic powers are all influential determinants in antimicrobial prescribing behaviour of farm animal veterinarians. Interventions to change prescribing behaviour of farm animal veterinarians could address attitudes and advisory skills of veterinarians, as well as provide tools to deal with (perceived) pressure from farmers and advisors to prescribe antimicrobials. Additional (policy) measures could probably support farm animal veterinarians in acting as a more independent <b>animal</b> health <b>consultant.</b> </p...|$|R
