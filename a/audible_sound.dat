5|$|The game {{features}} several recipes, each listing preparation times, {{ingredients and}} courses. In addition, What's Cooking? {{can be used}} as a shopping list to remind players what items to purchase, and it can act as a timer to count down from a specified time and make an <b>audible</b> <b>sound</b> when it is done.|$|E
5|$|Tornadoes emit widely on the {{acoustics}} {{spectrum and}} the sounds are caused by multiple mechanisms. Various sounds of tornadoes have been reported, mostly related to familiar sounds for the witness and generally some variation of a whooshing roar. Popularly reported sounds include a freight train, rushing rapids or waterfall, a nearby jet engine, or combinations of these. Many tornadoes are not audible from much distance; the nature of and the propagation distance of the <b>audible</b> <b>sound</b> depends on atmospheric conditions and topography.|$|E
25|$|In {{the reverse}} microphonic effect, varying the {{electric}} field between the capacitor plates exerts a physical force, {{turning them into}} an audio speaker. High current impulse loads or high ripple currents can generate <b>audible</b> <b>sound</b> from the capacitor itself, draining energy and stressing the dielectric.|$|E

25|$|Ultrasound {{is sound}} waves with {{frequencies}} {{higher than the}} upper audible limit of human hearing. Ultrasound {{is no different from}} 'normal' (<b>audible)</b> <b>sound</b> in its physical properties, except in that humans cannot hear it. Ultrasound devices operate with frequencies from 20 kHz up to several gigahertz.|$|E
25|$|Some cave-dwelling species, {{including}} the oilbird and swiftlets (Collocalia and Aerodramus spp.), use <b>audible</b> <b>sound</b> (with {{the majority of}} sonic location occurring between 2 and 5kHz) to echolocate {{in the darkness of}} caves. The only bird known to make use of infrasound (at about 20Hz) is the western capercaillie.|$|E
25|$|For {{sound waves}} in air, {{the speed of}} sound is 343m/s (at room {{temperature}} and atmospheric pressure). The wavelengths of sound frequencies audible to the human ear (20Hz–20kHz) are thus between approximately 17m and 17mm, respectively. Note that the wavelengths in <b>audible</b> <b>sound</b> are much longer than those in visible light.|$|E

25|$|Poorly-designed {{walkways}} increase {{risks for}} the vision-impaired, {{because it is}} more difficult than at a signalised intersection to audibly detect whether there is a sufficient gap in traffic to cross safely. At a signalised intersection, traffic comes to a stop, and an <b>audible</b> <b>sound</b> can be generated to indicate {{that it is time to}} cross.|$|E
25|$|Capacitors, {{especially}} ceramic capacitors, {{and older}} designs such as paper capacitors, can absorb sound waves {{resulting in a}} microphonic effect. Vibration moves the plates, causing the capacitance to vary, in turn inducing AC current. Some dielectrics also generate piezoelectricity. The resulting interference is especially problematic in audio applications, potentially causing feedback or unintended recording. In the reverse microphonic effect, the varying electric field between the capacitor plates exerts a physical force, moving them as a speaker. This can generate <b>audible</b> <b>sound,</b> but drains energy and stresses the dielectric and the electrolyte, if any.|$|E
25|$|The phonautograph, {{patented}} by Léon Scott in 1857, used a vibrating diaphragm and stylus to graphically record sound waves as tracings on sheets of paper, purely for visual analysis {{and without any}} intent of playing them back. In the 2000s, these tracings were first scanned by audio engineers and digitally converted into <b>audible</b> <b>sound.</b> Phonautograms of singing and speech made by Scott in 1860 were played back as sound {{for the first time}} in 2008. Along with a tuning fork tone and unintelligible snippets recorded as early as 1857, these are the earliest known recordings of sound.|$|E

50|$|Cicadomorpha is an infraorder of {{the insect}} order Hemiptera which {{contains}} the cicadas, leafhoppers, treehoppers, and spittlebugs. There are approximately 35,000 described species worldwide. Distributed worldwide, {{all members of}} this group are plant-feeders, and many produce either <b>audible</b> <b>sounds</b> or substrate vibrations as a form of communication. The earliest fossils of cicadomorphs first appear during the Late Permian.|$|R
500|$|What's Cooking? is an {{interactive}} cookbook and food preparation video game with recipes that each list preparation times, ingredients and courses. Recipes can be sorted by criteria such as dishes that take less than 20 minutes to prepare, or vegetarian-only meals. After opening a recipe, an ingredient list is presented. Items {{on the list}} can be earmarked and added to a shopping list as a reminder to purchase in the future. A timer option is also available, which counts down from a specified time and makes an <b>audible</b> <b>sound</b> when it is done. Before doing any real cooking, a virtual representation of each step in the recipe is given on the screen that must be performed by the player. The Nintendo DS touchscreen and stylus are used to perform tasks such as whisking eggs, pouring sauces and cutting vegetables. Tutorials are also available to teach the player how to perform simple cooking preparation tasks. While cooking, the Nintendo DS responds to audible commands; saying [...] "next" [...] into the device's microphone will move the recipe {{on to the next}} step. One hundred recipes are included in the game, and players can create their own dishes in the game. Afterward, they can share them with others via Wi-Fi. In addition to the game's cooking aspects, What's Cooking? features challenges in which the player uses the stylus to chop, stir, and serve as quickly as possible.|$|E
2500|$|A similar debate arises {{with the}} NIV's {{use of the}} word [...] "sound" [...] instead of [...] "voice" [...] in [...] The noun used here — phōnē (φωνῆ) — can mean either. By {{translating}} 9:7 as [...] "they heard the sound" [...] instead of [...] "they heard the voice," [...] the NIV allows for Paul's companions to have heard an <b>audible</b> <b>sound</b> in Acts 9:7 without contradicting the statement in Acts 22:9 that they did not hear a comprehensible voice.|$|E
2500|$|The basic {{distinction}} between the Edison's first phonograph patent and the Bell and Tainter patent of 1886 was the method of recording. Edison's method was to indent the sound waves {{on a piece of}} tin-foil while Bell and Tainter's invention called for cutting or [...] "engraving" [...] the sound waves into an ozokerite wax record with a sharp recording stylus. At each step of their inventive process the Associates also sought out the best type of materials available in order to produce the clearest and most <b>audible</b> <b>sound</b> reproduction.|$|E

Researchers have found in Chinese astronomical records that some Chinese {{observations}} describe <b>audible</b> <b>sounds</b> associated with the comet, which may, if true, have resulted from the interaction of particles with the Earth's magnetosphere, as sometimes described for the aurora.|$|R
50|$|It is {{also common}} for Auchenorrhyncha species to produce either <b>audible</b> <b>sounds</b> or {{substrate}} vibrations {{as a form}} of communication. Such calls range from vibrations inaudible to humans, to the calls of many species of cicadas that can be heard for hundreds of metres, at least. In season, they produce the most characteristic and ubiquitous noise of the bush.|$|R

2500|$|The Allies of World War I {{first used}} {{infrasound}} to locate artillery. One {{of the pioneers}} in infrasonic research was French scientist Vladimir Gavreau. His interest in infrasonic waves first came about in his laboratory during the 1960s, {{when he and his}} laboratory assistants experienced [...] shaking laboratory equipment and pain in the eardrums, but his microphones did not detect <b>audible</b> <b>sound.</b> He concluded it was infrasound caused by a large fan and duct system, and soon got to work preparing tests in the laboratories. One of his experiments was an infrasonic whistle, an oversized organ pipe.|$|E
2500|$|Sensitivity is {{a measure}} of how {{effectively}} an earpiece converts an incoming electrical signal into an <b>audible</b> <b>sound.</b> It thus indicates how loud the headphones will be for a given electrical drive level. It can be measured in decibels of sound pressure level per milliwatt (dB (SPL)/mW) or decibels of sound pressure level per volt (dB (SPL) / V). [...] Unfortunately, both definitions are widely used, often interchangeably. [...] As the output voltage (but not power) of a headphone amplifier is essentially constant for most common headphones, dB/mW is often more useful if converted into dB/V using Ohm's law: ...|$|E
2500|$|Physics {{theories}} of the late 19th century assumed that just as surface water waves must have a supporting substance, i.e. a [...] "medium", to move across (in this case water), and <b>audible</b> <b>sound</b> requires a medium to transmit its wave motions (such as air or water), so light must also require a medium, the [...] "luminiferous aether", to transmit its wave motions. Because light can travel through a vacuum, {{it was assumed that}} even a vacuum must be filled with aether. Because the speed of light is so large, and because material bodies pass through the aether without obvious friction or drag, it was assumed to have a highly unusual combination of properties. Designing experiments to test the properties of the aether was a high priority of 19th century physics.|$|E
50|$|It {{is as if}} The Berlin Requiem {{deals with}} what can {{scarcely}} be discerned by the senses, be heard, {{in the realm of}} the gelid nothingness. As if there faintly <b>audible</b> <b>sounds</b> of the alterations of crystals and frozen bodies are recorded. Duration of the sound is expanding to the very limits of articulation. Only the silent quiver of white light and cold motions is <b>audible.</b> The <b>sound</b> extends through the space that has neither the horizon, nor forms, nor boundaries. Perhaps it is the place where the change is the largest - one that cannot be uttered, such a large one that it cannot be recorded or comprehended.|$|R
50|$|Although pitch {{notation}} {{is intended}} to describe <b>audible</b> <b>sounds,</b> {{it can also be}} used to specify the frequency of non-audible phenomena. For example, when the Chandra X-ray Observatory observed the waves of pressure fronts propagating away from a black hole, the one oscillation every 10 million years was described by NASA as corresponding to the B fifty-seven octaves below middle C (or B−53).|$|R
40|$|<b>Audible</b> <b>sounds</b> {{associated}} with breathing can provide important diagnostic {{information on the}} site and nature of respiratory disease.

This article discusses the important causes of wheezy breathing from a pathophysiological standpoint...|$|R
2500|$|A high-pass (low-cut) and/or {{low-pass}} (high-cut) filter {{may also}} be included on equalizers or audio consoles. High-pass (low-cut) and low-pass (high-cut) filters restrict a given channel's bandwidth extremes. Cutting very low frequency sound signals (termed infrasonic, or subsonic, a misnomer) reduces the waste of amplifier power which does not produce <b>audible</b> <b>sound</b> and which moreover can be hard on the low-range speakers. A low-pass filter to cut ultrasonic energy is useful to prevent interference from radio frequencies, lighting control hum, or digital circuitry creeping into the power amplifiers. Such filters are often included with graphic and parametric equalizers to give the audio engineer full control of the frequency range. [...] If their response is steep enough, high-pass filters and low-pass filters function as end-cut filters. [...] A feedback suppressor is an automatically-adjusted band-reject or notch filter which includes a microprocessor to detect the onset of [...] feedback [...] "howls" [...] and direct the filter to suppress the feedback by lowering the gain right at the offending frequency.|$|E
2500|$|There {{are also}} {{high rates of}} hearing loss, often NIHL, in firefighters, which {{increases}} with age and number of years working as a firefighter. [...] Hearing loss prevention programs have been implemented in multiple stations and have shown to help lower the rate of firefighters with NIHL. Other {{attempts have been made}} to lower sound exposures for firefighters, such as enclosing the cabs of the firetrucks to lower the siren exposure while driving. NFPA (National Fire Protection Association) is responsible for occupational health programs and standards in firefighters which discusses what hearing sensitivity is required to work as a firefighter, but also enforces baseline (initial) and annual hearing tests (based on OSHA hearing maintenance regulations). While NIHL can be a risk that occurs from working as a firefighter, NIHL can also be a safety concern for communicating while doing the job as communicating with coworkers and victims is essential for safety. Hearing protection devices have been used by firefighters in the United States. Earmuffs are the most commonly used hearing protection device (HPD) as they are the most easy to put on correctly in a quick manner. Multiple fire departments have used HPDs that have communication devices built in, allowing firefighters to speak with each other at safe, but <b>audible</b> <b>sound</b> levels, while lowering the hazardous sound levels around them.|$|E
2500|$|An {{electronic}} drum module is {{an electronic}} or digital music device in an electronic drum kit {{that serves as}} the central processing unit and sound module. The drum module creates or produces the drum kit sounds or other sounds selected by the drummer. By itself, a drum module cannot play or sound drum beats. It only produces drum sounds when a performer strikes electronic drum pads or acoustic drum kit instruments that have electronic [...] "triggers" [...] (or sensors) attached to them. When the electronic drum pads or trigger-equipped instruments are struck, this sends a signal to the drum module, which produces the corresponding electronic drum sound (or other sound). Even when drum pads and/or triggers are connected to a drum module, the drum module by itself does not make any <b>audible</b> <b>sound.</b> Like other electronic instruments such as the synthesizer, the drum module only outputs an electronic signal. The performer can hear this signal by connecting headphones to the drum module (i.e., for individual practice) or by plugging the drum module into a amplifier and loudspeaker or PA system for audible practice or live performances. The drum module's output signal can also be patched into an audio console for concerts or sound recording. The nomenclature varies (see below). For example, electronic drum modules are called [...] "percussion sound modules" [...] in the case of Roland Corporation, or sometimes simply modules. A common colloquial term for this device is drum brain. (see below).|$|E
