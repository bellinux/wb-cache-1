5|$|The {{riots in}} which Blakelock died took place within {{a wave of}} social unrest across England. Since the 1980 St. Pauls riot in Bristol, and {{particularly}} since the 1981 Brixton riot in south London, a series of incidents had sparked violent confrontations between black youths <b>and</b> <b>largely</b> white police officers.|$|E

5|$|Another {{important}} factor in the evaluation of chess positions is the pawn structure (sometimes known as the pawn skeleton), or the configuration of pawns on the chessboard. Since pawns are the least mobile of the chess pieces, the pawn structure is relatively static <b>and</b> <b>largely</b> determines the strategic nature of the position. Weaknesses in the pawn structure, such as isolated, doubled, or backward pawns and , once created, are often permanent. Care must therefore be taken to avoid these weaknesses unless they are compensated by another valuable asset (for example, by the possibility of developing an attack).|$|E
5|$|At {{around this}} time Etty began to receive many {{unsolicited}} letters from wealthy Old Etonian lawyer Thomas Myers. Myers was a huge admirer of Etty, and his letters mainly suggest literary topics he felt Etty ought to be painting so as {{to appeal to the}} nobility; he wrote regularly between July 1832 and May 1844. Although eccentric <b>and</b> <b>largely</b> incoherent (one of his suggestions was for Etty to raise his profile by painting nude portraits of the wives of the aristocracy), Etty appears to have taken at least some of Myers's suggestions seriously.|$|E
5|$|Bats are {{the second}} largest order of mammals (after the rodents), {{representing}} about 20% of all classified mammal species worldwide, with about 1,240 bat species divided into two suborders: the less specialized <b>and</b> <b>largely</b> fruit-eating megabats, including flying foxes, and the highly specialized and echolocating microbats. About 70% of bat species are insectivores. Most of the rest are frugivores, or fruit eaters. A few species feed from animals other than insects, with the vampire bats being hematophagous, or feeding on blood.|$|E

5|$|Being low-lying <b>and</b> <b>largely</b> {{surrounded}} by water, Norfolk is {{particularly vulnerable to}} rising sea levels. In addition, the land on which it is built is slowly subsiding. Some areas already flood regularly at high tide, and the city commissioned a study in 2012 to investigate how {{to address the issue}} in the future: it reported the cost of dealing with a sea-level rise of one foot would be around $1,000,000,000. Since then, scientists at the Virginia Institute of Marine Science in 2013 have estimated that if current trends hold, the sea in Norfolk will rise by 5 and 1/2 feet or more {{by the end of this}} century.|$|E
5|$|Controversy {{surrounds}} the breakout {{before the last}} stand—which various writers have posited might have actually been desertion—and a box of gold sovereigns, which a Matabele inDuna (leader) later claimed {{had been given to}} two unidentified men from Forbes's rear guard on 2 December, along with a message that Lobengula admitted defeat and wanted the column to stop pursuing him. Two batmen were initially found guilty of accepting the gold, keeping it for themselves and not passing on the message, but the evidence against them was inconclusive <b>and</b> <b>largely</b> circumstantial; the convictions were ultimately overturned.|$|E
5|$|Damage was {{confined}} to Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Tennessee, and south-central Iowa, <b>and</b> <b>largely</b> consisted of fallen chimneys, foundation cracks, collapsed parapets, and overturned tombstones. In one home in Dale, Illinois, near Tuckers Corners and southwest of McLeansboro, the quake cracked interior walls, plaster, and chimneys. Using a type of victim study, the local post office surveyed residents and implemented a field inspection which indicated the strongest shaking (MM VII) {{took place in the}} Wabash Valley, Ohio Valley, and other nearby south-central Illinois lowlands. Outside this four-state zone, oscillating objects including cars, chimneys, and the Gateway Arch were reported to authorities.|$|E

5|$|Hansell {{played a}} key <b>and</b> <b>largely</b> unsung role in the {{strategic}} planning of air operations by the United States. This included drafting both the strategic air war plans (AWPD-1 and AWPD-42) and the plan for the Combined Bomber Offensive in Europe; obtaining a base {{of operations for the}} B-29 Superfortress in the Mariana Islands; and devising the command structure of the Twentieth Air Force, the first global strategic air force and forerunner of the Strategic Air Command. He made precision air attack, as both the most humane and effective means of achieving military success, a lifelong personal crusade that eventually became the key tenet of American airpower employment.|$|E
5|$|Impact {{outside of}} China was minimal <b>and</b> <b>largely</b> limited to heavy rains, {{although}} one death {{was reported in}} Taiwan. In the country, strong winds and heavy rainfall left heavy damage near the coast, {{as well as to}} farms further inland. Rananim destroyed 64,300houses and damaged another 125,000. The typhoon affected 75counties, affecting 18million people, and overall damage was estimated at ¥20.1billion ($2.44billion 2004USD, $ USD), primarily in Zhejiang. There were 168deaths in China, which caused the name Rananim to be retired from the naming list.|$|E

It was the first tropical cyclone to threaten the New Orleans area since Hurricane Katrina and the destructive 2005 hurricane season. Overall impact from the cyclone was minor <b>and</b> <b>largely</b> limited to light rainfall. However, the precursor system spawned a damaging tornado in Eustis, Florida, where 20houses were destroyed and 30more were damaged.|$|E

5|$|New York State Route187 (NY187) {{is a short}} {{state highway}} located entirely in Erie County, New York, in the United States. It serves as the {{southern}} end of the busy Transit Road in the town of Elma. Its southern terminus is at Quaker Road (U.S. Route20A or US20A) and its northern terminus at US20 where that highway becomes Transit Road. Unlike much of the rest of Transit, which is mostly designated as part of NY78, the NY187 portion is lightly trafficked, two-lane <b>and</b> <b>largely</b> undeveloped. NY187 was assigned in the early 1940s and was previously part of NY78.|$|E
