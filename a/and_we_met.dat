25|$|The {{day before}} {{yesterday}} I was present at an operation performed by Dr. George McClellan, on a gentleman from Virginia. It consisted in {{the removal of the}} whole of the parotid gland in a scirrhous and much enlarged state, from {{the left side of the}} face. Nothing could exceed the combined coolness and skill manifested by Dr. M. throughout this terrible operation, which he has now performed for the eleventh time, and hitherto with remarkable success. On this occasion, however, he was doomed to disappointment, for the patient died last night, about thirty-six hours after the operation. McClellan sent for me in the evening, to see the dying man with him, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>met</b> in the chamber of death between ten and eleven o'clock. I had sometimes heard McClellan spoken of as a heartless surgeon, devoid of feeling or sympathy for those who came under his knife; but I can solemnly aver that I have seldom witnessed more unaffected sorrow than he manifested on this occasion. He walked the room incessantly, and repeatedly clasped my hands in his, while he expressed, in emphatic language, the feelings that preyed upon his mind. He moreover assured me, that he seldom performed one of his severer operations without first asking the blessing of God on his undertaking; and that days and nights of painful anxiety, often preceded those great professional efforts which have justly placed his name on the pinnacle of surgical fame. The gurgling respiration of the unfortunate patient announced the near approach of death, and I withdrew, full of sympathy for the agonized emotions of my friend.|$|E

60|$|I made my {{way back}} to the cafe. It was now almost deserted. All but one or two very late diners had gone, and the tables were being {{prepared}} for supper. Louis, however, was still there, sitting at the desk {{by the side of the}} cashier, and apparently making calculations. He came forward when he saw me enter, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>met</b> by chance just as one of the under-managers of the hotel passed by.|$|E
60|$|Israel Zangwill {{was often}} in the city <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>met</b> {{frequently}} during January and February. I recall taking him to see Howells whom he greatly admired but had never met. They made a singularly interesting contrast of East and West. Howells was serious, almost sad for some reason, unassuming, self-unconscious and yet masterly in every word. Zangwill on the contrary overflowed with humor, emitting a shower of epigrams concerning America and the things he liked and disliked, and soon had Howells smiling with pleased interest.|$|E

60|$|It really {{seemed like}} failure for my psychic, and I {{began to wonder}} whether the books really did fly from Miller's shelves. I could not suspect the gentle little lady of {{conscious}} deceit, but with {{a knowledge of the}} wonderful deceptions of somnambulists and hysterics, I began to doubt. I urged Miller to try one more sitting. He consented, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>met</b> at Brierly's house. Nothing happened during the first two hours, and at ten o'clock, or thereabouts, Miller, Brierly, and Fowler withdrew, leaving me to untie and restore Mrs. Smiley, who was still apparently in deep sleep.|$|E
60|$|Mr. Eaton {{was a man}} of books. His library {{contained}} many {{volumes of}} standard value <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>met</b> as equals over the pages of Scott and Dickens. I actually forced him to listen to a lecture which I had been writing during the winter and so wrought upon him that he agreed to arrange a date for me in a neighboring country church.--Thereafter while I glowed with absurd dreams of winning money and renown by delivering that lecture in the churches and school-houses of the state, I continued to seek for work, any work that would bring me food and shelter.|$|E
60|$|To my surprise, {{sometime}} after I was received into the Harbour, I ascertained {{that my sister}} had removed to New York, and was then living in the place. I felt it, now, to be a duty to hunt her up, and see her. This I did; <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>met,</b> again, after a separation of five-and-twenty years. She could tell me very little of my family; but I now learned, for the first time, {{that my father had}} been killed in battle. Who, or what he was, I {{have not been able to}} ascertain, beyond the facts already stated in the opening of the memoir.|$|E

60|$|The stars shone brightly as we glided {{over the}} {{crunching}} snow, and the sleigh-bells tinkled merrily as our horse sped over the deserted road. Groups of white cottages and solitary gigantic trees flew past us, looking, in the uncertain light, like large snow-drifts; save where the twinkling of a candle, {{or the first}} blue flames of the morning fire, indicated that the industrious habitant had risen to his daily toil. In silence we glided on our way, till the distant lights of Montreal awakened us from our reveries, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>met</b> at intervals a solitary pedestrian, or a sleigh-load of laughing, fur-encompassed faces returning from an evening party.|$|E
60|$|The {{next day}} I set about the {{business}} which had {{brought me to the}} English capital. Most of our passengers were in town, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>met,</b> as a matter of course. I had calls from three or four Americans established here, some in one capacity, and some in others; for our country has long been giving back its increase to England, in the shape of admirals, generals, judges, artists, writers and notion-mongers. But what is all this compared to the constant accessions of Europeans among ourselves? Eight years later, on returning home, I found New York, in feeling, opinions, desires, (apart from profit,) and I might almost say, in population, a foreign rather than American town.|$|E
60|$|The {{swiftness}} of our march, {{and uncertainty}} which way we intended, prevented all possible preparation to oppose us, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>met</b> with no party {{able to make}} head against us. From Woburn the king went through Buckingham to Oxford; some of our men straggling in the villages for plunder, were often {{picked up by the}} enemy. But in all this long march we did not lose 200 men, got an incredible booty, and brought six waggons laden with money, besides 2000 horses and 3000 head of cattle, into Oxford. From Oxford his Majesty moves again into Gloucestershire, having left about 1500 of his horse at Oxford to scour the country, and raise contributions, which they did as far as Reading.|$|E

60|$|In 1754, {{war with}} France being again apprehended, a {{congress}} of commissioners {{from the different}} colonies was, by an order of the Lords of Trade,[152] to be assembled at Albany, there to confer with the chiefs of the Six Nations[153] concerning the means of defending both their country and ours. Governor Hamilton, having received this order, acquainted the House with it, requesting they would furnish proper presents for the Indians, to be given on this occasion, and naming the speaker (Mr. Norris) and myself to join Mr. Thomas Penn and Mr. Secretary Peters as commissioners to act for Pennsylvania. The House approved the nomination, and provided the goods for the present, though they did not much like treating out of the provinces; <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>met</b> the other commissioners at Albany about the middle of June.|$|E
60|$|TANNER. Yes, you did. Do you {{remember}} a dark-eyed girl named Rachel Rosetree? [Ann's brows contract {{for an instant}} involuntarily]. I got up {{a love affair with}} her; <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>met</b> one night in the garden and walked about very uncomfortably with our arms round one another, and kissed at parting, and were most conscientiously romantic. If that love affair had gone on, it would have bored me to death; but it didn't go on; for the next thing that happened was that Rachel cut me because she found out that I had told you. How did she find it out? From you. You went to her and held the guilty secret over her head, leading her a life of abject terror and humiliation by threatening to tell on her.|$|E
60|$|I left my room {{to go down}} to {{the ground}} floor of the house, and speak to the {{landlord}} about finding me a messenger. He happened to be ascending the stairs at the time, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>met</b> on the landing. His son, a quick lad, was the messenger he proposed to me on hearing what I wanted. We had the boy upstairs, and I gave him his directions. He was to take the letter in a cab, to put it into Professor Pesca's own hands, and to bring me back a line of acknowledgment from that gentleman--returning in the cab, and keeping it at the door for my use. It was then nearly half-past ten. I calculated that the boy might be back in twenty minutes, and that I might drive to St. John's Wood, on his return, in twenty minutes more.|$|E
60|$|Here a low whistle, the {{prearranged}} signal, apprised {{the balance}} of our party that I was returning, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> were <b>met</b> by the three with every manifestation of enthusiastic rejoicing.|$|R
