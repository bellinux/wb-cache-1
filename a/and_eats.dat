5|$|A highly active predator, {{the river}} otter has adapted to hunting in water, <b>and</b> <b>eats</b> aquatic and semiaquatic animals. The {{vulnerability}} and seasonal availability of prey animals mainly governs its food habits and prey choices. This availability {{is influenced by}} the following factors: detectability and mobility of the prey, habitat availability for the various prey species, environmental factors, such as water depth and temperature, and seasonal changes in prey supply and distribution in correspondence with otter foraging habitat.|$|E
5|$|Active {{during the}} night, Transandinomys talamancae {{lives on the}} ground <b>and</b> <b>eats</b> plants and insects. Males move more and have larger home ranges than females. It breeds {{throughout}} the year, but few individuals survive {{for more than a}} year. After a gestation period of about 28 days, two to five young are born, which reach sexual maturity within two months. A variety of parasites occur on this species. Widespread and common, it is of no conservation concern.|$|E
5|$|Ale were {{believed}} {{to be able to make}} men insane; in eastern Serbia there is a special term for such a man: alosan. When people encountered an ala on a road or field, they could get dangerous diseases from her. Ale are also responsible for dogs’ rabies, although indirectly: a skylark that reaches the clouds and encounters an ala there goes mad (alosan), plunges to the ground, and so kills itself; a dog that finds <b>and</b> <b>eats</b> the bird goes mad too.|$|E

5|$|Cleaning {{symbiosis}} is {{a mutually}} beneficial association between individuals of two species, where one (the cleaner) removes <b>and</b> <b>eats</b> parasites {{and other materials}} {{from the surface of}} the other (the client). Cleaning symbiosis is well-known among marine fish, where some small species of cleaner fish, notably wrasses but also species in other genera, are specialised to feed almost exclusively by cleaning larger fish and other marine animals. Other cleaning symbioses exist between birds and mammals, and in other groups.|$|E
5|$|It has {{a unique}} method of {{capturing}} tent-making bats. It looks for roosting bats by looking for their tents (which are made of a folded leaf). When it finds a bat it climbs {{to a higher level}} and jumps onto the tent from above, attempting to dislodge the bat. If the fallen bat does not fly away in time, the monkey pounces on it on the ground <b>and</b> <b>eats</b> it.|$|E

40|$|Sex <b>and</b> <b>eating</b> {{may have}} {{behavioral}} and psychological relationships and have cortical regions in common. This research investigated the general relationship between sex <b>and</b> <b>eating</b> from a reward perspective {{among the general}} population. Two-hundred and sixty-one Chinese participants were recruited via the internet (136 males, 125 females, mean age 30. 46 years) to fill in questionnaires about wanting and liking for sex <b>and</b> <b>eating.</b> The results revealed that first, there was {{a positive correlation between}} wanting for sex <b>and</b> wanting to <b>eat</b> only for males. Second, the relationship between liking for sex <b>and</b> <b>eating</b> was also positive for males and not significant in females. Third, the correlation between sociosexual orientation <b>and</b> wanting to <b>eat</b> was significant only in females, and there was no significant correlation between sociosexual orientation <b>and</b> liking for <b>eating.</b> Fourth, emotional sex cravings (or emotional sexual activity) was positively correlated with emotional food cravings (or emotional eating behavior), with a higher magnitude correlation in males than females. Finally, analysis of wanting (liking) models of sex <b>and</b> <b>eating</b> for males <b>and</b> females revealed three models for wanting among females: high wanting, low wanting for <b>eating,</b> <b>and</b> low wanting for sex; and two models for wanting among males: high wanting and low wanting. Liking for sex <b>and</b> <b>eating</b> among females consisted of two types of model: high liking and low liking; whereas three type models existed for males: high liking for sex, high liking for <b>eating,</b> <b>and</b> low liking. In general, our research revealed that, as with other natural rewards, sex <b>and</b> <b>eating</b> have considerable commonality and are related in numerous ways...|$|R

5|$|The Simpsons {{has been}} dubbed into several other languages, {{including}} Japanese, German, Spanish, and Portuguese. It {{is also one of}} the few programs dubbed in both standard French and Quebec French. The show has been broadcast in Arabic, but due to Islamic customs, numerous aspects of the show have been changed. For example, Homer drinks soda instead of beer <b>and</b> <b>eats</b> Egyptian beef sausages instead of hot dogs. Because of such changes, the Arabized version of the series met with a negative reaction from the lifelong Simpsons fans in the area.|$|E
5|$|The Texas {{pocket gopher}} avoids {{emerging}} {{onto the surface}} to feed by seizing the roots of plants with its jaws and pulling them downwards into its burrow. It also practices coprophagy. The African pouched rat forages on the surface, gathering anything that might be edible into its capacious cheek pouches until its face bulges out sideways. It then returns to its burrow to sort through the material it has gathered <b>and</b> <b>eats</b> the nutritious items.|$|E
5|$|The {{great grey shrike}} is able {{to detect}} flying {{bumblebees}} up to 100 metres away; once captured, the sting is removed by repeatedly squeezing the insect with the mandibles and wiping the abdomen on a branch.

One hundred (100) female participants {{with a mean age}} of approximately 21 years were recruited after informed consent for this pilot study. Results showed a positive correlation between body image <b>and</b> <b>eating</b> disorders. In addition, there was no significant difference between the levels of university education on female body image <b>and</b> <b>eating</b> distortions in Ghana.

5|$|Various {{regions of}} Africa have folkloric tales of beings with vampiric abilities: in West Africa the Ashanti people tell of the iron-toothed and tree-dwelling asanbosam, and the Ewe {{people of the}} adze, which can {{take the form of}} a firefly and hunts children. The Eastern Cape region of South Africa has the impundulu, which can {{take the form of a}} large taloned bird and can summon thunder and lightning, and the Betsileo people of Madagascar tell of the ramanga, an outlaw or living vampire who drinks the blood <b>and</b> <b>eats</b> the nail {{clippings}} of nobles.|$|E
5|$|Vertebrate predators of bees include bee-eaters, shrikes and flycatchers, {{which make}} short sallies to catch insects in flight. Swifts and {{swallows}} fly almost continually, catching insects as they go. The honey buzzard attacks bees' nests <b>and</b> <b>eats</b> the larvae. The greater honeyguide interacts with humans by guiding {{them to the}} nests of wild bees. The humans break open the nests and take the honey and the bird feeds on the larvae and the wax. Among mammals, predators such as the badger dig up bumblebee nests and eat both the larvae and any stored food.|$|E
5|$|As an adult, {{the house}} sparrow mostly feeds on {{the seeds of}} grains and weeds, but it is {{opportunistic}} and adaptable, <b>and</b> <b>eats</b> whatever foods are available. In towns and cities, it often scavenges for food in garbage containers and congregates in the outdoors of restaurants and other eating establishments to feed on leftover food and crumbs. It can perform complex tasks to obtain food, such as opening automatic doors to enter supermarkets, clinging to hotel walls to watch vacationers on their balconies, and nectar robbing kowhai flowers. In common with many other birds, the house sparrow requires grit to digest the harder items in its diet. Grit can be either stone, often grains of masonry, or the shells of eggs or snails; oblong and rough grains are preferred.|$|E

5|$|Small rodents {{form the}} largest {{part of the}} least weasel's diet, but it also kills <b>and</b> <b>eats</b> rabbits, other mammals, and {{occasionally}} birds, birds' eggs, fish and frogs. Males mark their territories with olfactory signals and have exclusive home ranges which may intersect with or include several female ranges. Least weasels use pre-existing holes to sleep, store food and raise their young. Breeding {{takes place in the}} spring and summer, and there is a single litter of about six kits which are reared exclusively by the female. Due to its small size and fierce nature, the least weasel plays an important part in the mythology and legend of various cultures.|$|E

5|$|The pied butcherbird often perches on a fencepost, stump or branch while {{foraging}} for prey. It generally pounces on victims on {{the ground}} <b>and</b> <b>eats</b> them there. At times, it may hop or run along hunting ground-based food, and occasionally seize flying insects. It generally forages alone, or occasionally in pairs. The pied butcherbird has been observed hunting collaboratively with the Australian hobby, either picking off common starlings or rufous-throated honeyeaters disturbed by the larger hobby, or flushing out small birds from bushes, which the larger bird then hunts. The pied butcherbird sometimes stores food items by impaling them on a stick or on barbed wire, or shoving them in a nook or crevice.|$|E

40|$|Symptoms {{of muscle}} dysmorphia, body dysmorphic disorder, <b>and</b> <b>eating</b> {{disorders}} in a nonclinical population of adult male weightlifters in Australia. J Strength Cond Res 29 (5) : 1406 – 1414, 2015 —The current study aimed to (a) determine {{the rates of}} symptoms of muscle dysmorphia (MD), body dysmorphic disorder (BDD), <b>and</b> <b>eating</b> disorder; (b) determine the relationships among symptoms of MD, BDD, <b>and</b> <b>eating</b> disorders; <b>and</b> (c) provide a comprehensive comparison of symptoms of MD, BDD, <b>and</b> <b>eating</b> disorders in a nonclinical population of adult male weightlifters in Australia. The participants (N = 648, mean age = 29. 5 years, SD = 10. 1) participated in an online survey, consisting of Muscle Appearance Satisfaction Scale, the Body Dysmorphic Disorder Questionnaire, and the Eating Attitude Test- 26. Results indicated that 110 participants (17 %) were {{at risk of having}} MD, 69 participants (10. 6 %) were at risk of having BDD, and 219 participants (33. 8 %) were at risk of having an eating disorder. Furthermore, 36 participants (5. 6 %) were found at risk of having both MD and BDD, and 60 participants (9. 3 %) were at risk of having both MD <b>and</b> an <b>eating</b> disorder. Significant correlations and associations were found between symptoms of MD and BDD, and symptoms of MD <b>and</b> <b>eating</b> disorders. Support was provided for the comorbidity of, and symptomatic similarities between, symptoms of MD and BDD, and symptoms of MD <b>and</b> <b>eating</b> disorders. This may reflect a shared pathogenesis between symptoms of MD, BDD, <b>and</b> <b>eating</b> disorders. Strength <b>and</b> conditioning professionals, exercise scientists, athletic trainers, and personal trainers should be aware that adult males who are working out with weights (i. e., free weights or machines) may be at increased risk of having MD, BDD, <b>and</b> <b>eating</b> disorders...|$|R

5|$|Triaenops menamena is a bat in {{the genus}} Triaenops found on Madagascar, {{mainly in the}} drier regions. It was known as Triaenops rufus until 2009, when it was {{discovered}} that that name had been incorrectly applied to the species. Triaenops rufus is a synonym of Triaenops persicus, a Middle Eastern species closely related to T.menamena— the Malagasy species had previously been placed as a subspecies of T.persicus by some authors. Triaenops menamena is mostly found in forests, but also occurs in other habitats. It often roosts in large colonies <b>and</b> <b>eats</b> insects such as butterflies and moths. Because of its wide range, common occurrence, and tolerance of habitat degradation, it is not considered to be threatened.|$|E
