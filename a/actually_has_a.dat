500|$|The Stresemann's bushcrow {{lives in}} flat savanna covered with mature acacia and Commiphora thornbushes. The bird prefers open short-grass savannas with {{scattered}} stands of these mature thornbushes. The soil must be deep and rich {{to support the}} bushcrow. It is most numerous when these stands are next to agricultural fields. For many years it was unknown why the species could be completely absent from areas of suitable habitat near seemingly identical but inhabited land. However recent research has revealed that the bird appears to inhabit an area with a very precise average temperature extreme, all of the seemingly suitable but uninhabited surrounding land <b>actually</b> <b>has</b> <b>a</b> slightly higher average temperature that appears to prevent the birds from successfully colonising. It is also not found near the scattered broadleaf woodland made up of Combretum and Terminalia. Its habitat is between [...] above sea level.|$|E
500|$|But Gaga {{addressed}} the viewer {{directly in the}} video while singing the song, which led Moralde to deduce that [...] "She's not in the moment, but is instead playing a feminized role in a dreamlike space; this quality is accentuated by the bright and blown-out color palette, and the numerous shots of Gaga in bed or sleeping. The cumulative effect is that it asserts the Lady Gaga of the previous videos {{to be the real}} one, and the Gaga in 'Eh, Eh' is a character that she is playing." [...] His view was shared by Chris Kingston from The Harvard Crimson who noted during the release of the music video for Gaga's 2010 single [...] "Telephone", that the video shows [...] "the crazy party girl we know [...] <b>actually</b> <b>has</b> <b>a</b> weirdly girlish, domestic side." [...] In The Oxford Handbook of Sound and Image in Digital Media, author Carol Vernallis divided Gaga's persona into three categories. The personality portrayed in the [...] "Eh, Eh" [...] video was named as [...] "Friendly Peer" [...] archetype; someone with a girl-next-door image and approachable behavior.|$|E

500|$|The episode {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from critics, with critiques ranging from largely positive to very negative. Myles McNutt from The A.V. Club gave the episode a slightly positive review {{and gave it}} a B- rating. He wrote, [...] "The Office is far from a profound show when it just throws its characters in a room and observes their behavior, but there’s a certain charm to it." [...] McNutt noted that, despite feeling that the episode's description of [...] "Darryl teaches Nellie how to eat a taco" [...] was a poor move on NBC's part, he thought they [...] "could have spent more time with Nellie learning how to eat a taco." [...] Craig McQuinn from The Faster Times wrote positively of the episode, noting, [...] "For the first time in forever this is an episode of The Office that <b>actually</b> <b>has</b> <b>a</b> lot going on. Whether the stuff that’s happening is actually meaningful or significant in any way is up for debate, but I actually enjoyed most of this episode." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{story was}} well received. Joe Rybicki of Official U.S. PlayStation Magazine celebrated that [...] "for {{the first time}} I can remember, an extreme-sports game <b>actually</b> <b>has</b> <b>a</b> real story [...] honest-to-goodness characters". IGN's Douglas Perry called it [...] "a kick, albeit {{relatively}} lightweight in nature". He especially praised the pervasive sense of humor in the narrative and in the portrayal of real-world skaters. Knutson called the story [...] "unique" [...] and stated, [...] "I really like that Neversoft {{had the guts to}} try something this radical and ditch the formula that they know works so well." [...] Ben Silverman of Game Revolution described the game's plot as a [...] "silly" [...] cross between those of the 1980s films North Shore and Gleaming the Cube, but he praised it for giving context to the level goals and keeping distance between the skill unlocks. Bramwell called it [...] "hackneyed". Rybicki found that the plot hurt the game's replay value and caused missions to be overly simplistic. By contrast, Game Informers Justin Leeper thought that [...] "it serves to make some of the less-entertaining goals tolerable, because there’s a reason for doing them." ...|$|E
500|$|Foley has {{praised the}} group's musical style on several occasions. He {{described}} the concept as innovative, {{as the music}} [...] "is not nursery rhyme, it <b>actually</b> <b>has</b> <b>a</b> top 40 essence to it but the lyrics are for kids." [...] He suggested this musical appeal for all ages {{as a reason for}} the group having a large teenage and adult fanbase. He cited the Wiggles as an influence of Hi-5, however he said that the respective groups have different [...] "styles of music". Hi-5 has been successful internationally. Foley explained how kids are universal and [...] "love to hear music", suggesting that the music is part of how international audiences connect to the group. Robinson stated the cast were encouraged to write their own music for the group, which all of the original members did, and by 2015 said she still receives occasional royalty cheques for her work. Original member of the Wiggles, and classical musician, Phillip Wilcher declared that Hi-5 [...] "successfully explore the essential components that come together to make music"; he detailed how the educational appeal [...] "seems to happen gently and [...] seem so at one with their audience of young folk... They also seem to know the subtle difference between childlike and childish".|$|E

2500|$|The {{notion of}} a false {{positive}} is common in cases of paranormal or ghost phenomena seen in images and such, when there is another plausible explanation.
