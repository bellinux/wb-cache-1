5|$|<b>A</b> <b>cross</b> (X) {{means that}} the country participated in the contest that year.|$|E
5|$|Equine {{species can}} crossbreed with each other. The most common hybrid is the mule, <b>a</b> <b>cross</b> between a male donkey {{and a female}} horse. With rare exceptions, these hybrids are sterile and cannot reproduce. A related hybrid, a hinny, is <b>a</b> <b>cross</b> between a male horse and a female donkey. Other hybrids include the zorse, <b>a</b> <b>cross</b> between a zebra and a horse and a zonkey or zedonk, a hybrid of a zebra and a donkey. In areas where Grévy's zebras are {{sympatric}} with plains zebras, fertile hybrids do occur.|$|E
5|$|Familiar {{examples}} of equid hybrids are the mule, <b>a</b> <b>cross</b> between a female horse and a male donkey, and the hinny, <b>a</b> <b>cross</b> between a female donkey and a male horse. Pairs of complementary types like the mule and hinny are called reciprocal hybrids.|$|E
5000|$|In Denmark, it {{is illegal}} to cross the road outside of <b>a</b> {{pedestrian}} <b>crossing</b> if within 30 meters from <b>a</b> <b>crossing</b> (according to <b>a</b> newspaper) or if there is <b>a</b> <b>crossing</b> [...] "nearby" [...] (according to the law).|$|R
50|$|In the United Kingdom {{and certain}} parts of the Commonwealth of Nations, animal names are often used to {{distinguish}} several types of such crossings. <b>A</b> zebra <b>crossing</b> consists of wide longitudinal stripes on road (perpendicular to the crossing route), often with Belisha beacons. Pedestrians may cross at any time, while drivers must give way to pedestrians who demonstrate intent to <b>cross.</b> <b>A</b> pelican <b>crossing</b> is <b>a</b> signalised <b>crossing</b> and is button-operated. Similar to <b>a</b> pelican <b>crossing,</b> <b>a</b> puffin <b>crossing</b> is signalised; however, unlike <b>a</b> pelican <b>crossing,</b> where the pedestrian lights are {{on the far side of}} the road, <b>a</b> puffin <b>crossing</b> contains pedestrian lights on the near side of road, and is button-operated with kerbside detector. <b>A</b> toucan <b>crossing</b> is used by bicycles as well as pedestrians, while <b>a</b> pegasus <b>crossing</b> is used by equestrian.|$|R
50|$|<b>A</b> <b>crossing</b> {{may have}} {{the name of a}} {{specific}} banker added between the lines. A cheque with <b>a</b> such <b>a</b> <b>crossing</b> can only be paid into an account at that bank.|$|R
5|$|Now, you can win. You {{will not}} be a favorite; you'll be rather a long shot. But given luck and money and {{a hell of a lot}} of work, you can win... but for Christ's sake don't commit suicide with no dough... Maybe you can't crucify mankind on <b>a</b> <b>cross</b> of gold, but you can sure as hell crucify a statewide {{candidate}} upon <b>a</b> <b>cross</b> of no-gold.|$|E
5|$|The eight defenders, called Swedes, {{start on}} the eight squares {{adjoining}} the konakis, {{in the form of}} <b>a</b> <b>cross.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{standard}} astronomical {{symbol of}} Earth consists of <b>a</b> <b>cross</b> circumscribed by a circle, , representing {{the four corners}} of the world.|$|E
25|$|An antiparallelogram is {{a special}} case of <b>a</b> <b>crossed</b> quadrilateral, which has {{generally}} unequal edges. A special form of the antiparallelogram is <b>a</b> <b>crossed</b> rectangle, in which two opposite edges are parallel.|$|R
5000|$|Six-way intersections usually involve <b>a</b> <b>crossing</b> {{of three}} streets at one junction; for example, <b>a</b> <b>crossing</b> of two {{perpendicular}} streets and a diagonal street {{is a rather}} common type of 6-way intersection.|$|R
40|$|AbstractFor C the {{category}} of Lie (resp. Jordan, commutative, associative with unit) algebras, we define the notion of <b>a</b> <b>crossed</b> n-cube in C and prove that it is equivalent to an n-fold category object in C. <b>A</b> <b>crossed</b> 1 -cube is essentially <b>a</b> <b>crossed</b> module. The case where C is {{the category}} of groups has been treated separately by R. Steiner and the author...|$|R
5|$|Among the Wyandots was {{the legend}} of the hooh-strah-dooh. <b>A</b> <b>cross</b> between what current fiction/legends portray as zombies and vampires, the hooh-strah-dooh was an evil spirit that {{inhabited}} recently dead bodies and caused the corpse to rise and devour the living. The redbud was believed to be an effective ward.|$|E
5|$|Apollo Justice: Ace Attorney is, {{like the}} rest of the Ace Attorney series, <b>a</b> <b>cross</b> between the {{adventure}} game and visual novel genres. The player's goal is to defend their clients in four cases, and prove their innocence. The gameplay is separated into two types of situations: Investigations and trials.|$|E
5|$|Arsenal began brightly {{in front}} of a crowd of 65,483, {{creating}} the first chance of the match in the 17th minute. Paul Davis set up striker Kevin Campbell, who hooked the ball high over goal. Four minutes later, Alan Smith headed the ball into the goal net, meeting <b>a</b> <b>cross</b> from Paul Merson; it was ruled out by referee Terry Holbrook for offside. Tottenham improved shortly after, with Gary Mabbutt heading the ball directly at Arsenal goalkeeper David Seaman to create their first chance of the match. Their best opportunity to score was in the 36th minute. Vinny Samways set up Gary Lineker to break past the Arsenal defence. Having nudged the ball past Tony Adams, Lineker looked up, before making <b>a</b> <b>cross</b> for Nayim to head; the shot was acrobatically saved by Seaman's right foot.|$|E
50|$|In New Zealand, motorists are {{required}} {{to give way to}} pedestrians. Pedestrians wishing to cross the road within 20 metres of <b>a</b> <b>crossing</b> facility (which includes zebra crossings) must use <b>a</b> <b>crossing</b> facility.|$|R
5000|$|... {{together}} with the action of G on H defines <b>a</b> <b>crossed</b> module. Thus, central extensions {{can be seen as}} special <b>crossed</b> modules. Conversely, <b>a</b> <b>crossed</b> module with surjective boundary defines a central extension.|$|R
50|$|The {{line was}} single track except for <b>a</b> <b>crossing</b> loop at Tayport and another at Wormit. <b>A</b> <b>crossing</b> loop was {{provided}} at East Newport in 1878. Tay-Port became Fife's largest station north of Cupar.|$|R
5|$|As a male-line {{grandchild}} of a British Sovereign, Marie {{bore the}} arms of the kingdom, with an inescutcheon for Saxony, differenced by a five-point label argent, the outer pair of which bore anchors azure, the inner roses gules, and the central <b>a</b> <b>cross</b> gules. In 1917, the inescutcheon was dropped by Royal Warrant from George V.|$|E
5|$|Efe's obverse dies {{show the}} king's name and title, usually spelt {{with a mixture}} of runes and Latin script, with some aspects of the coins {{occasionally}} ill-drawn or omitted altogether. The king's name is generally arranged around the central motif of a pellet (or <b>a</b> <b>cross)</b> within a circle of pellets: this layout probably derived from Northumbrian coins. The reverse dies consisted of <b>a</b> <b>cross</b> and the letters E F E, placed in four sectors that were divided off by lines. It can be shown that Efe did not use his dies in any particular or consistent order. Calculations have been made that suggest that few of his dies remain undiscovered.|$|E
5|$|Gisa died in 1088 and {{was buried}} at Wells Cathedral. When he died, he, along with Wulfstan, Bishop of Worcester, {{were the only}} {{remaining}} bishops from Edward the Confessor's appointments. His tomb was opened in 1979, and <b>a</b> <b>cross</b> with verses from the Mass for the Dead inscribed on it was found in his tomb.|$|E
50|$|<b>A</b> <b>crossed</b> (self-intersecting) {{quadrilateral}} {{consists of}} two opposite sides of a non-self-intersecting quadrilateral along with the two diagonals. Similarly, <b>a</b> <b>crossed</b> rectangle is <b>a</b> <b>crossed</b> quadrilateral which {{consists of two}} opposite sides of a rectangle along with the two diagonals. It has the same vertex arrangement as the rectangle. It appears as two identical triangles with a common vertex, but the geometric intersection is not considered a vertex.|$|R
50|$|Garnier 15-6 is <b>a</b> <b>crossing</b> of Villard noir, {{developed}} in Southwest France by Bertille Seyve and Victor Villard, and the Vitis vinifera grape Müller-Thurgau developed by Swiss grape breeder Hermann Müller. Villard noir is <b>a</b> <b>crossing</b> of the Seibel grapes Chancellor and Les Subéreux which have Vitis labrusca and Vitis riparia and Vitis rupestris in their lineages. Müller-Thurgau is <b>a</b> <b>crossing</b> of two vinifera varieties, Riesling and Madeleine Royale.|$|R
40|$|We generalize {{the notion}} of <b>a</b> <b>crossed</b> module of groups to that of <b>a</b> <b>crossed</b> module of racks. We {{investigate}} the relation to categorified racks, namely strict 2 -racks, and trunk-like objects {{in the category of}} racks, generalizing the relation between crossed modules of groups and strict 2 -groups. Then we explore topological applications. We show that by applying the rack-space functor, <b>a</b> <b>crossed</b> module of racks gives rise to a covering. Our main result shows how the fundamental racks associated to links upstairs and downstairs in a covering fit together to form <b>a</b> <b>crossed</b> module of racks.

5|$|Gloucester {{bore the}} royal arms, differenced by an inescutcheon of the Danish {{coat of arms}} and a label of three points Argent, the centre point bearing <b>a</b> <b>cross</b> Gules.|$|E
5|$|In the 1850s, Stonehenge {{recommended}} <b>a</b> <b>cross</b> {{between a}} Beagle and a Scottish Terrier as a retriever. He found the crossbreed to {{be a good}} worker, silent and obedient, but it had the drawback that it was small and could barely carry a hare.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 19th century German horticulturalists devoted many {{efforts to develop}} new Riesling hybrids that would create a more flexible, less temperamental grape that could still retain some of the elegant {{characteristics}} of Riesling. The most notable is the Müller-Thurgau developed in the Geisenheim Grape Breeding Institute in 1882, which is <b>a</b> <b>cross</b> of Riesling and Madeleine Royale (although long believed to be Riesling x Silvaner). Other Riesling/Silvaner crosses include the Palatinate regional favorite Scheurebe and Rieslaner. Kerner, <b>a</b> <b>cross</b> between Riesling and the red wine grape Trollinger is a high quality cross that has recently eclipsed Riesling in plantings.|$|E
50|$|Glera is {{a parent}} variety of two Manzoni grapes, the red {{wine grape variety}} Incrocio Manzoni 2.15 (<b>a</b> <b>crossing</b> with Cabernet Sauvignon) and another red skinned variety known as Incrocio Manzoni 2.14 (<b>a</b> <b>crossing</b> with Cabernet Franc).|$|R
50|$|From its parents, Rayon d'Or (<b>a</b> <b>crossing</b> of Aramon du Gard and Seibel 405) and Seibel 5656 (<b>a</b> <b>crossing</b> of Seibel 4595 and Seibel 4199), Seyval noir has Vitis vinifera, Vitis rupestris and Vitis aestivalis {{genes in}} lineage.|$|R
5000|$|<b>A</b> <b>crossed</b> {{quadrilateral}} {{is sometimes}} likened to a bow tie or butterfly. A three-dimensional rectangular wire frame that is twisted {{can take the}} shape of a bow tie. <b>A</b> <b>crossed</b> rectangle is sometimes called an [...] "angular eight".|$|R
5|$|No atoms were {{detected}} providing {{a limit of}} 1.6pb on the cross section at the energy provided. The GSI repeated the experiment with higher sensitivity in three separate runs from April–May 2007, January–March 2008, and September–October 2008, all with negative results and providing <b>a</b> <b>cross</b> section limit of 90 fb.|$|E
5|$|Notes (N): The {{presence}} of <b>a</b> <b>cross</b> (†) denotes that all {{passengers and crew}} were killed. The {{presence of}} a one with an asterisk (1*) indicates the accident or incident had a sole survivor.|$|E
5|$|One legend {{states that}} when Andrew the Apostle visited the {{uninhabited}} {{mountains in the}} mid-stream of the Dnieper River (today's Andriyvskyy Descent area), he put up <b>a</b> <b>cross</b> atop of the hill where the descent starts and prophesied a foundation of a great Christian city. Since that time, wooden churches sprang up around in the vicinity, completing his prophecy.|$|E
50|$|The {{most common}} type of {{crossing}} on the railway network (around 2/3 of the total) and also the most basic type. These are either <b>a</b> footpath <b>crossing,</b> <b>a</b> <b>crossing</b> with gates and instructions, or <b>a</b> <b>crossing</b> with <b>a</b> telephone to the nearest signalbox. In order to cross safely, users must read the instructions and comply with them.|$|R
50|$|<b>A</b> <b>crossing</b> {{up through}} zero {{may be used}} as a signal to buy, or <b>a</b> <b>crossing</b> down through zero as a signal to sell. How high (or how low when negative) the {{indicators}} get shows how strong the trend is.|$|R
50|$|Schopp {{station is}} located on the {{north-western}} edge of the built-up area of the municipality of Schopp. At it opening, it had signals and <b>a</b> <b>crossing</b> loop. It is the only station between Kaiserslautern and Waldfischbach with <b>a</b> <b>crossing</b> loop.|$|R
