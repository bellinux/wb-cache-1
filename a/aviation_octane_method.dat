40|$|Despite many {{excellent}} {{properties of}} wood which make it suitable for many applications, it {{suffers from a}} number of disadvantages limiting its use. For instance, modification is needed to reduce water sorption and to improve decay resistance, dimensional stability and weathering performance. In addition, wood/liquid interaction such as water wettability on wood {{plays an important role in}} design and characteristics of many processes and phenomena such as adhesion, coating, waterproofing, wood chemical modification, and weathering. This thesis focuses on enhancing the understanding of wetting of wood, with emphasis on modified wood. The influence of surface chemical composition of wood and its microstructural characteristics on wetting and swelling properties has also been studied. A multicycle Wilhelmy plate technique has been developed to evaluate wetting properties of porous materials, such as wood, in which the samples were subjected to repeated immersions and withdrawals in a swelling liquid (water) and in a non-swelling liquid (<b>octane).</b> This <b>method</b> was utilized to dynamically investigate contact angle, sorption and swelling properties, as well as dimensional stability of unmodified, chemically and surface modified wood samples. Scots pine sapwood and heartwood samples were utilized to establish the principles of the technique. Acetylated and furfurylated wood samples with different level of modification were thereafter examined utilizing the developed technique for wetting measurements. A perimeter model based on a linear combination of the measured force and final change in sample perimeter was suggested to evaluate the dynamic dimensional stability of wood veneers. The feasibility of this method for studying dynamic wettability was investigated by measuring the changes of advancing and receding contact angles over repeated cycles on surface modified wood samples, created by combining liquid flame spray and plasma polymerisation methods. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and X-ray computed tomography (XCT) were employed to study the surface chemical composition and microstructural properties of the samples, respectively. Three different kinetic regimes were observed in the wetting measurements: i) fast wetting and spreading of the liquid on the wood surface, ii) void filling and wicking and iii) swelling, which was the slowest of the three. The multicycle Wilhelmy plate method was found to be suitable for studying liquid penetration, sorption, and dimensional stability of swelling materials. The results demonstrate that the wetting properties of wood are highly affected by surface chemistry and microstructure. It was shown that using both swelling and non-swelling liquids in wetting measurements allow to distinguish between capillary liquid uptake and swelling. Based on this, for chemically modified samples, it was demonstrated that acetylation mostly reduces swelling, while furfurylation reduces both swelling and capillary uptake. This is in line with the microstructural study with X-ray computed tomography where a significant change in the porosity was found as a result of furfurylation, conversely acetylation left the total porosity values unchanged. Wetting results for hydrophobised wood samples demonstrate that the multi-scale roughness obtained by combination of nanoparticle coating and plasma polymerization increased both the hydrophobicity and the forced wetting durability compared to the micro-scale roughness found on wood modified with plasma polymerisation alone.

40|$|Both {{the global}} economy and the society in general are {{dependent}} {{on the availability of}} reliable transportation. Most transportation technology involves the use of internal combustion engines in one way or another. Because of the large numbers of internal combustion engines in use around the world, their emissions have a significant environmental impact. Therefore, considerable efforts have been invested into developing more sophisticated engine control systems and improving engine combustion behavior and post-treatment systems. These efforts have resulted in significant reductions in NOx, CO, HC, and particulate matter emissions and further improvements can be expected. Emissions of the green house gas CO 2 were once unregulated, but has recently become the focus of considerable attention because of its role in global warming. The formation of CO 2 in an internal combustion engine is directly dependant on its efficiency. This, together {{with the fact that the}} Earth's oil resources are finite and rapidly diminishing, means that there remains a need for improvements in engine efficiency. Homogeneous Charge Compression Ignition (HCCI) and Partially Premixed Combustion (PPC) are “low-temperature” combustion techniques that can, if implemented correctly, allow for the development of engines with improved efficiency and low emissions of particulate matter and NOx. The objective of the work described in this thesis was to obtain insights into how these low temperature combustion processes can be controlled so as to achieve a high degree of combustion stability, low noise, and reliable transient performance. A set of control-oriented models of HCCI engines were developed. These models capture the engines dynamic behavior and have been used to design controllers that were tested on a real Turbo Negative Valve Overlap (NVO) HCCI Engine. Engines using these controllers exhibited improved transient performance compared to engines using a more conventional controller design. A number of difficulties relating to load range and controllability were encountered in the studies on HCCI engines; it was suggested that PPC engines might suffer less from these problems. PPC represents a significant advance on HCCI in terms of controllability. However, in order to satisfy modern emissions criteria, it is necessary to operate PPC engines with extensive Exhaust Gas Recirculation (EGR). This presents some challenges relating to excessive rates of pressure increase during transient load increases. This problem was solved using a dual-injection strategy and model-based control. Low-load PPC operation is difficult with high <b>octane</b> fuels. Various <b>methods</b> for extending the load tolerated by PPC were proposed; some, such as switching to SI mode, were evaluated experimentally. To the best of the author's knowledge, these experiments were the first instances in which the mode of operation of an active engine was changed from SI to PPC and back. In both PPC and HCCI, combustion is highly sensitive to environmental conditions. Some of these are not easy to measure or understand with sufficient accuracy to predict their impact. Some kind of combustion event feedback is therefore necessary. To this end, piezo-electric pressure sensors, an ion current sensor and a high precision torque sensor were evaluated as feedback sensors that could potentially provide this data. The piezo-electric pressure transducer was found to be superior to the alternatives. Its readings are precise and provide accurate feedback on combustion timing. The ion current sensor was found to be a useful alternative at high and intermediate loads; unfortunately, at low loads, the signal-to-noise of the ion current signal is poor. An algorithm was proposed to improve the detection of the ion current, and was somewhat successful. Using a novel technique, data from the torque sensor was used in conjunction with combustion and black box models to obtain information on the combustion phasing...|$|R
