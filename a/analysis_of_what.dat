The flooding revealed that although these properties were not normally affected by floods, there was significant seepage through the banks.

500|$|Another {{view is that}} Section 3 {{provides}} a much strengthened basis {{for the sort of}} [...] "weak review" [...] the scope of which carefully determined between courts on one hand and parliament on the other [...] in a statutory form. There have been at least three criticisms put forward: firstly that the impossibility of implied repeal goes against some formulations of parliamentary sovereignty that require that no parliament can bind a future parliament. Secondly, whether section 3 interpretations follow parliamentary intent is questionable; thirdly, if it does allow interpretations contrary to intent, section 3 may render section 4 necessary. However, judicial powers are probably not unconstrained. The <b>analysis</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> the courts can and cannot do would also provide the answer the third criticism, depending on the viewpoint. Whilst the scope of section 3 has been criticised for being vague, and leading therefore more easily to the imposition of the judiciary on the legal domain of parliament, this viewpoint is controversial: they do not seem to have yet so encroached and there are rules emerging about the application of section 3.|$|E

[...] In a subsequent review, VanDerWerff awarded the episode an [...] "A" [...] and called it [...] "one of my favorite episodes of The X-Files sixth season" [...] due to its <b>analysis</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> Mulder and Scully each desire from the world, and the fact that the episode argues that the [...] "mysteries can only be solved if both of these people are working to solve them."

500|$|Beginning in late 2002, Gore {{began to}} {{publicly}} criticize the Bush administration. In a September 23, 2002, speech given before the Commonwealth Club of California, Gore criticized President George W. Bush and Congress for {{the rush to}} war prior to the outbreak of hostilities in Iraq. He compared this decision to the Persian Gulf War (which Gore had voted for) stating, [...] "Back in 1991, I {{was one of a}} handful of Democrats in the United States Senate to vote in favor of the resolution endorsing the Persian Gulf War [...] But look at the differences between the resolution that was voted on in 1991 and the one this administration is proposing that the Congress vote on in 2002. The circumstances are really completely different. To review a few of them briefly: in 1991, Iraq had crossed an international border, invaded a neighboring sovereign nation and annexed its territory. Now by contrast in 2002, there has been no such invasion." [...] In a speech given in 2004, during the presidential election, Gore accused George W. Bush of betraying the country by using the 9/11 attacks as a justification for the invasion of Iraq. The next year, Gore gave a speech which covered many topics, including what he called [...] "religious zealots" [...] who claim special knowledge of God's will in American politics. Gore stated: [...] "They even claim that those of us who disagree with their point of view are waging war against people of faith." [...] After Hurricane Katrina in 2005, Gore chartered two planes to evacuate 270 people from New Orleans and criticized the Bush administration's response to the hurricane. In 2006, Gore criticized Bush's use of domestic wiretaps without a warrant. One month later, in a speech given at the Jeddah Economic Forum, Gore criticized the treatment of Arabs in the U.S. after 9/11 stating, [...] "Unfortunately there have been terrible abuses and it's wrong [...] I do want you to know that it does not represent the desires or wishes or feelings of the majority of the citizens of my country." [...] Gore's 2007 book, The Assault on Reason, is an <b>analysis</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> Gore refers to as the [...] "emptying out of the marketplace of ideas" [...] in civic discourse during the Bush administration. He attributes this phenomenon to the influence of television and argues that it endangers American democracy. By contrast, Gore argues, the Internet can revitalize and ultimately [...] "redeem the integrity of representative democracy." [...] In 2008, Gore argued against the ban of same-sex marriage on his Current TV website, stating, [...] "I think that gay men and women ought to have the same rights as heterosexual men and women to make contracts, have hospital visiting rights, and join together in marriage." [...] In a 2009 interview with CNN, Gore commented on former Vice President Dick Cheney's criticism of the Obama administration. Referring to his own previous criticism of the Bush administrations, Gore stated: [...] "I waited two years after I left office to make statements that were critical, and then of the policy [...] You know, you talk about somebody that shouldn't be talking about making the country less safe, invading a country that did not attack us and posed no serious threat to us at all." ...|$|E
