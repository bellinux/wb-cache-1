5|$|Abnormalities of behavior, {{also called}} {{abnormalities}} of activity, include observations of specific <b>abnormal</b> movements, {{as well as}} more general observations of the patient's level of activity and arousal, and observations of the patient's eye contact and gait. <b>Abnormal</b> movements, for example choreiform, athetoid or choreoathetoid movements may indicate a neurological disorder. A tremor or dystonia may indicate a neurological condition or the side effects of antipsychotic medication. The patient may have tics (involuntary but quasi-purposeful movements or vocalizations) which may be a symptom of Tourette's syndrome. There are a range of abnormalities of movement which are typical of catatonia, such as echopraxia, catalepsy, waxy flexibility and paratonia (or gegenhalten). Stereotypies (repetitive purposeless movements such as rocking or head banging) or mannerisms (repetitive quasi-purposeful <b>abnormal</b> movements such as a gesture or <b>abnormal</b> gait) may be a feature of chronic schizophrenia or autism.|$|E
5|$|For {{hereditary}} cases, {{the patient}} must {{have at least}} 2 <b>abnormal</b> tests plus family history.|$|E
5|$|HHT is {{a genetic}} {{disorder}} by definition. It is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner, {{which means that}} an affected person carries one <b>abnormal</b> gene with a 50% chance of passing this gene to offspring. Those with HHT symptoms that have no relatives with the disease may have a new mutation. It seems that carrying two <b>abnormal</b> copies of the gene is not compatible with life, and hence no homozygotes have been described.|$|E
5|$|Teratological (developmentally <b>abnormal)</b> {{forms of}} H.aurantiaca were {{reported}} {{to occur in the}} United Kingdom. The fruit bodies of these specimens were club-shaped with a wrinkled upper surface of convoluted gill tissue. The overall morphology of these forms somewhat resembles species of Clavariadelphus. Although the cause of this <b>abnormal</b> development is not known with certainty, environmental pollutants or virus infection have been suggested as contributing factors.|$|E
5|$|The Wilson's disease gene (ATP7B) {{has been}} mapped to {{chromosome}} 13 (13q14.3) and is expressed {{primarily in the}} liver, kidney, and placenta. The gene codes for a P-type (cation transport enzyme) ATPase that transports copper into bile and incorporates it into ceruloplasmin. Mutations can be detected in 90% of cases. Most (60%) are homozygous for ATP7B mutations (two <b>abnormal</b> copies), and 30% have only one <b>abnormal</b> copy. Ten percent have no detectable mutation.|$|E
5|$|A {{predisposition}} for bladder infections may run in families. Other {{risk factors}} include diabetes, being uncircumcised, {{and having a}} large prostate. In children UTIs are associated with vesicoureteral reflux (an <b>abnormal</b> movement of urine from the bladder into ureters or kidneys) and constipation.|$|E
5|$|<b>Abnormal</b> genitalia: usually {{cryptorchidism}} (retention of testicles in body) or monorchism (single testicle). In female patients, this presents {{as missing}} or single ovaries, much harder by nature to detect. Ultrasound imaging is performed at regular intervals, {{from the age}} of 1 year, to determine if ovaries are present.|$|E
5|$|About 1 in 300 to 500 {{people have}} {{mutations}} in the LDLR gene that encodes the LDL receptor protein, which normally removes LDL from the circulation, or apolipoprotein B (ApoB), {{which is the}} part of LDL that binds with the receptor; mutations in other genes are rare. People who have one <b>abnormal</b> copy (are heterozygous) of the LDLR gene may develop cardiovascular disease prematurely at the age of 30 to 40. Having two <b>abnormal</b> copies (being homozygous) may cause severe cardiovascular disease in childhood. Heterozygous FH is a common genetic disorder, inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, occurring in 1:500 people in most countries; homozygous FH is much rarer, occurring in 1 in a million births.|$|E
5|$|Acne scars {{are caused}} by {{inflammation}} within the dermal layer of skin and are estimated to affect 95% of people with acne vulgaris. The scar is created by <b>abnormal</b> healing following this dermal inflammation. Scarring {{is most likely to}} take place with severe acne, but may occur with any form of acne vulgaris. Acne scars are classified based on whether the <b>abnormal</b> healing response following dermal inflammation leads to excess collagen deposition or loss {{at the site of the}} acne lesion.|$|E
5|$|An <b>abnormal</b> {{behaviour}} {{of birds}} in captivity, performed primarily by commercial egg-laying hens, characterized by pecking {{damage to the}} , the surrounding skin and underlying tissue. Vent pecking frequently occurs immediately after an egg has been laid when the cloaca often remains partly everted exposing the mucosa.|$|E
5|$|An <b>abnormal</b> {{formation}} of the hip socket, known as hip dysplasia, affected nearly 64% of Pugs in a survey performed by the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals; the breed was ranked the second worst-affected by this condition out of 157 breeds tested.|$|E
5|$|At {{least one}} study has {{associated}} CS exposure with miscarriages. This {{is consistent with}} its reported clastogenic effect (<b>abnormal</b> chromosome change) on mammalian cells.|$|E
5|$|Heart murmurs are <b>abnormal</b> heart sounds {{which can}} be either {{pathological}} or benign. One example of a murmur is Still's murmur, which presents a musical sound in children, has no symptoms and disappears in adolescence.|$|E
5|$|Heparin-induced {{thrombocytopenia}} (HIT) is {{the development}} of thrombocytopenia (a low platelet count), due to the administration of various forms of heparin, an anticoagulant. HIT predisposes to thrombosis (the <b>abnormal</b> formation of blood clots inside a blood vessel) because platelets release microparticles that activate thrombin, thereby leading to thrombosis. When thrombosis is identified the condition is called heparin-induced thrombocytopenia and thrombosis (HITT). HIT is caused by the formation of <b>abnormal</b> antibodies that activate platelets. If someone receiving heparin develops new or worsening thrombosis, or if the platelet count falls, HIT can be confirmed with specific blood tests.|$|E
5|$|Hereditary Transmission of Fistulae Auris. This journal article, {{published}} in Der Erbarzt (The Genetic Physician), focuses on fistula auris (an <b>abnormal</b> fissure on the external ear) as a hereditary trait. Mengele noted {{that individuals who}} have this trait also {{tend to have a}} dimple on their chin.|$|E
5|$|Hereditary hemorrhagic {{telangiectasia}} (HHT), {{also known}} as Osler–Weber–Rendu disease and Osler–Weber–Rendu syndrome, is a rare autosomal dominant genetic disorder that leads to <b>abnormal</b> blood vessel formation in the skin, mucous membranes, and often in organs such as the lungs, liver, and brain.|$|E
5|$|Hypertonia – Hypertonia {{is marked}} by an <b>abnormal</b> {{increase}} in muscle tension and reduced ability of a muscle to stretch. Hypertonia may result from injury, disease, or conditions which involve damage to {{the central nervous system}} (e.g. cerebral palsy).|$|E
5|$|In one survey, it {{was found}} that 89% of singly-housed {{primates}} exhibited self-injurious or <b>abnormal</b> stereotypyical behaviors including pacing, rocking, hair pulling, and biting among others.|$|E
5|$|Individuals with neuroacanthocytosis {{also often}} suffer from parkinsonism, the {{uncontrolled}} slowness of movements, and dystonia, <b>abnormal</b> body postures. Many affected individuals also have cognitive (intellectual) impairment and psychiatric {{symptoms such as}} anxiety, paranoia, depression, obsessive behavior, and pronounced emotional instability. Seizures {{may also be a}} symptom of neuroacanthocytosis.|$|E
5|$|Marseille always {{strove to}} improve his abilities. He worked to {{strengthen}} his legs and abdominal muscles, to help him tolerate the extreme g forces of air combat. Marseille also drank an <b>abnormal</b> amount of milk and shunned sunglasses, {{to improve his}} eyesight.|$|E
5|$|Oil spills have {{devastating effects}} on the environment. Crude oil {{contains}} polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) which {{are very difficult to}} clean up, and last for years in the sediment and marine environment. Marine species constantly exposed to PAHs can exhibit developmental problems, susceptibility to disease, and <b>abnormal</b> reproductive cycles.|$|E
5|$|Other {{subnuclear}} structures {{appear as}} part of <b>abnormal</b> disease processes. For example, the presence of small intranuclear rods {{has been reported in}} some cases of nemaline myopathy. This condition typically results from mutations in actin, and the rods themselves consist of mutant actin as well as other cytoskeletal proteins.|$|E
5|$|People who are {{asymptomatic}} (for instance, those diagnosed through {{family screening}} or {{only as a}} result of <b>abnormal</b> test results) are generally treated, as the copper accumulation may cause long-term damage in the future. It is unclear whether these people are best treated with penicillamine or zinc acetate.|$|E
5|$|Political dissidents {{were usually}} charged under Articles 70 (agitation and {{propaganda}} against the Soviet state) and 190-1 (dissemination of false fabrications defaming the Soviet state and social system) of the RSFSR Criminal Code. Forensic psychiatrists {{were asked to}} examine offenders whose mental state was considered <b>abnormal</b> by the investigating officers.|$|E
5|$|Restricted interests: Interests or {{fixations}} {{that are}} <b>abnormal</b> in theme or intensity of focus, such as preoccupation {{with a single}} television program, toy, or game.|$|E
5|$|Sexologists {{and other}} {{researchers}} are concerned that women may consider themselves to be dysfunctional {{if they do not}} experience G-spot stimulation, and emphasize that this is not <b>abnormal.</b>|$|E
5|$|The LDL {{receptor}} gene {{is located}} on the short arm of chromosome 19 (19p13.1-13.3). It comprises 18 exons and spans 45 kb, and the protein gene product contains 839 amino acids in mature form. A single <b>abnormal</b> copy (heterozygote) of FH causes cardiovascular disease by the age of 50 in about 40% of cases. Having two <b>abnormal</b> copies (homozygote) causes accelerated atherosclerosis in childhood, including its complications. The plasma LDL levels are inversely related to the activity of LDL receptor (LDLR). Homozygotes have LDLR activity of less than 2%, while heterozygotes have defective LDL processing with receptor activity being 2–25%, depending {{on the nature of the}} mutation. Over 1000 different mutations are known.|$|E
5|$|The first clue to a {{diagnosis}} of AML is typically an <b>abnormal</b> result on a complete blood count. While an excess of <b>abnormal</b> white blood cells (leukocytosis) is a common finding with the leukemia, and leukemic blasts are sometimes seen, AML can also present with isolated decreases in platelets, red blood cells, or even with a low {{white blood cell count}} (leukopenia). While a presumptive diagnosis of AML can be made by examination of the peripheral blood smear when there are circulating leukemic blasts, a definitive diagnosis usually requires an adequate bone marrow aspiration and biopsy as well as ruling out pernicious anemia (Vitamin B12 deficiency), folic acid deficiency and copper deficiency.|$|E
5|$|The main {{response}} {{of the immune system}} to tumors is to destroy the <b>abnormal</b> cells using killer T cells, sometimes with the assistance of helper T cells. Tumor antigens are presented on MHC class I molecules in a similar way to viral antigens. This allows killer T cells to recognize the tumor cell as <b>abnormal.</b> NK cells also kill tumorous cells in a similar way, especially if the tumor cells have fewer MHC class I molecules on their surface than normal; this is a common phenomenon with tumors. Sometimes antibodies are generated against tumor cells allowing for their destruction by the complement system.|$|E
5|$|The {{pressure}} {{around the}} brain may rise, causing papilledema (swelling of the optic disc) {{which may be}} experienced as visual obscurations. In severely raised intracranial pressure, the level of consciousness is decreased, the blood pressure rises, the heart rate falls and the patient assumes an <b>abnormal</b> posture.|$|E
5|$|Vaginal {{bleeding}} or spotting {{in women}} after menopause occurs in 90% of endometrial cancer. Bleeding is especially common with adenocarcinoma, occurring in {{two-thirds of all}} cases. <b>Abnormal</b> menstrual cycles or extremely long, heavy, or frequent episodes of bleeding in women before menopause {{may also be a}} sign of endometrial cancer.|$|E
25|$|Symptoms {{that require}} urgent medical {{attention}} are seizures, problems urinating, <b>abnormal</b> bruising or bleeding, melena, hematemesis, jaundice, fever and rigors, chest pain, hemiplegia, <b>abnormal</b> vision, dyspnea and edema.|$|E
25|$|Pachygyria, {{lissencephaly}} (smooth brain), and polymicrogyria (multiple small gyri) are all {{the results}} of <b>abnormal</b> cell migration. The <b>abnormal</b> migration is typically associated with a disorganized cellular architecture, failure to form six layers of cortical neurons (a four-layer cortex is common), and functional problems. The <b>abnormal</b> formation of the brain {{may be associated with}} seizures, developmental delay, and mental dysfunctions.|$|E
25|$|More {{frequent}} Pap smears may {{be needed}} to follow up after an <b>abnormal</b> Pap smear, or after treatment for <b>abnormal</b> Pap or biopsy results, or after treatment for cancer.|$|E
25|$|Neoplasm is an <b>abnormal</b> {{growth of}} tissue, which if {{it forms a}} mass, is {{commonly}} referred to as a tumor. This <b>abnormal</b> growth (neoplasia) usually but not always forms a mass.|$|E
25|$|The {{most common}} disease in which {{glycogen}} metabolism becomes <b>abnormal</b> is diabetes, in which, because of <b>abnormal</b> amounts of insulin, liver glycogen can be abnormally accumulated or depleted. Restoration of normal glucose metabolism usually normalizes glycogen metabolism, as well.|$|E
