5|$|Suzanne Jones sees a {{substantive}} difference between active listening as originated by Gordon and empathic listening {{as recommended by}} Rosenberg, insofar as active listening involves a specific step of reflecting what a speaker said {{to let them know}} you are listening, whereas empathic listening involves <b>an</b> <b>ongoing</b> <b>process</b> of listening with both heart and mind and being fully present to the other's experience, with an aim of comprehending and empathizing with the needs of the other, the meaning of the experience for that person.|$|E
5|$|In 1946, {{the last}} {{resident}} of Ashton Court Dame Esme Smyth, died. After the house became derelict, {{it was taken}} over by the City in 1959. Restoration has been <b>an</b> <b>ongoing</b> <b>process</b> since then, but even after extensive investment by both the council and from Heritage Lottery Fund grants, presently only {{about a quarter of the}} building is occupied or usable. The available facilities of the house are rented out for business conferences, parties and weddings. In 2013 a fire damaged the northern wing. It was contained by Avon Fire and Rescue Service, otherwise the rest of the building would have been at risk.|$|E
5|$|Identified world zinc {{resources}} total about 1.9–2.8 billion tonnes. Large deposits are in Australia, Canada and the United States, {{with the}} largest reserves in Iran. The most recent estimate of reserve base for zinc (meets specified minimum physical criteria related to current mining and production practices) was made in 2009 and calculated to be roughly 480 Mt. Zinc reserves, on the other hand, are geologically identified ore bodies whose suitability for recovery is economically based (location, grade, quality, and quantity) {{at the time of}} determination. Since exploration and mine development is <b>an</b> <b>ongoing</b> <b>process,</b> the amount of zinc reserves is not a fixed number and sustainability of zinc ore supplies cannot be judged by simply extrapolating the combined mine life of today's zinc mines. This concept is well supported by data from the United States Geological Survey (USGS), which illustrates that although refined zinc production increased 80% between 1990 and 2010, the reserve lifetime for zinc has remained unchanged. About 346 million tonnes have been extracted throughout history to 2002, and scholars have estimated that about 109–305 million tonnes are in use.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The {{product design}} process plays {{a central role}} in {{ensuring}} that new products are realized with improved quality, in a short lead-time and with costs kept to a minimum. It is identified that making decisions dynamically on how the design process should proceed is not trivial. A computational environment that aids dynamic decision making on the design process would be useful in ensuring successful design of new products. A key component of analysing and making decisions on the progression of the design process is a model that captures <b>an</b> <b>ongoing</b> design <b>process.</b> In this paper, an approach to modelling <b>an</b> <b>ongoing</b> design <b>process</b> is proposed based on the use of design nodes. The approach allows <b>an</b> <b>ongoing</b> design <b>process</b> to be modelled that facilitates dynamic decision making on how the design process should pro-gress and accounts for the state of the design problem. The approach allows top-down and bottom-up design strategies to be modelled...|$|R

25|$|With the {{collapse}} of the Soviet Union in 1991 {{and the end of the}} Cold War, the United States began a moratorium on nuclear testing and development of new nuclear weapon designs. To sustain existing warheads for the indefinite future, a science-based Stockpile Stewardship Program (SSP) was defined that emphasized the development and application of greatly improved technical capabilities to assess the safety, security, and reliability of existing nuclear warheads without the use of nuclear testing. Confidence in the performance of weapons, without nuclear testing, is maintained through <b>an</b> <b>ongoing</b> <b>process</b> of stockpile surveillance, assessment and certification, and refurbishment or weapon replacement.|$|E
25|$|The {{relationship}} between sleep and memory has been postulated and studied {{since at least}} the early 19th century. Memory, the cognitive process whereby experiences, learning and recognition are recalled, is a product of brain plasticity, the structural changes within synapses that create associations between stimuli. Stimuli are encoded within milliseconds; however, the long-term maintenance of memories can take additional minutes, days, or even years to fully consolidate and become a stable memory (more resistant to change or interference). Therefore, the formation of a specific memory occurs rapidly, but the evolution of a memory is often <b>an</b> <b>ongoing</b> <b>process.</b>|$|E
