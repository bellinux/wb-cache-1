5|$|Lithium-6 {{is valued}} {{as a source}} {{material}} for tritium production and as a neutron <b>absorber</b> in nuclear fusion. Natural lithium contains about 7.5% lithium-6 from which large amounts of lithium-6 have been produced by isotope separation for use in nuclear weapons. Lithium-7 gained interest for use in nuclear reactor coolants.|$|E
5|$|There are {{thousands}} of uses of various potassium compounds. One example is potassium superoxide, , an orange solid {{that acts as a}} portable source of oxygen and a carbon dioxide <b>absorber.</b> It is widely used in respiration systems in mines, submarines and spacecraft as it takes less volume than the gaseous oxygen.|$|E
25|$|There are {{generally}} {{two types of}} bass traps: resonant <b>absorbers</b> and porous <b>absorbers.</b> Resonant <b>absorbers</b> are further divided into panel <b>absorbers</b> and Helmholtz resonators.|$|R
50|$|Resonant panels, Helmholtz {{resonators}} {{and other}} resonant <b>absorbers</b> work by damping a sound wave as they reflect it. Unlike porous <b>absorbers,</b> resonant <b>absorbers</b> {{are most effective}} at low-medium frequencies and the absorption of resonant <b>absorbers</b> is always matched to a narrow frequency range.|$|R

5|$|Zinc oxide {{can be used}} in ointments, creams, and lotions {{to protect}} against sunburn and other damage to the skin caused by {{ultraviolet}} light (see sunscreen). It is the broadest spectrum UVA and UVB <b>absorber</b> that is approved for use as a sunscreen by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and is completely photostable. When used as an ingredient in sunscreen, zinc oxide blocks both UVA (320–400nm) and UVB (280–320nm) rays of ultraviolet light. Zinc oxide and the other most common physical sunscreen, titanium dioxide, are considered to be nonirritating, nonallergenic, and non-comedogenic. Zinc from zinc oxide is, however, slightly absorbed into the skin.|$|E
5|$|Conventional fission {{power plants}} {{rely on the}} chain {{reaction}} caused when fission events release thermal neutrons that cause further fission events. Each fission event in U-235 releases two or three neutrons with about 2MeV of kinetic energy. By careful arrangement {{and the use of}} various <b>absorber</b> materials, designers can balance the system so one of those neutrons causes another fission event while the other one or two are lost. This balance is known as criticality. Natural uranium is a mix of three isotopes; mainly U-238, with some U-235, and trace amounts of U-234. The neutrons released in the fission of either of the main isotopes will cause fission in U-235, but not in U-238, which requires higher energies around 5MeV. There is not enough U-235 in natural uranium to reach criticality. Commercial light water nuclear reactors, the most prevalent power reactors in the world, use nuclear fuel containing uranium enriched to 3 to 5% U-235 while the leftover is U-238.|$|E
5|$|Fermi {{argued that}} {{by using the}} delayed neutrons, and by {{carefully}} controlling the reaction rates as the power is ramped up, a pile can reach criticality at fission rates slightly below that of a chain reaction relying solely on the prompt neutrons from the fission reactions. Since the rate of release of these neutrons depends on fission events taking place some time earlier, there is a delay between any power spikes and the later criticality event. This time gives the operators leeway; if a spike in the prompt neutron flux is seen, they have several minutes before this causes a runaway reaction. If a neutron <b>absorber,</b> or neutron poison, is injected {{at any time during}} this period, the reactor will shut down. Consequently, the reaction can be controlled with electromechanical control systems such as control rods. Compton felt this delay was enough to provide a critical margin of safety, and allowed Fermi to build Chicago Pile-1 at Stagg Field.|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: The most {{important}} element in an anechoic chamber is <b>absorbers.</b> <b>Absorbers</b> will absorb an electromagnetic wave to provide non-reflecting environments similar to outer space. <b>Absorbers</b> have been developed at Microwave Laboratory, Faculty of Electronic and Computer Engineering, UTeM, consisting of absorbing material in pyramid shape, carbon powder and coating liquid. <b>Absorbers</b> are coated with carbon using oil and water-based paint. This paper highlights the design and construction of the <b>absorbers,</b> {{as well as the}} measurement system configuration for absorption measurements.

5|$|The major {{commercial}} {{application of}} samarium is in samarium–cobalt magnets, which have permanent magnetization {{second only to}} neodymium magnets; however, samarium compounds can withstand significantly higher temperatures, above , without losing their magnetic properties, due to the alloy's higher Curie point. The radioactive isotope samarium-153 is the active component of the drug samarium (153Sm) lexidronam (Quadramet), which kills cancer cells {{in the treatment of}} lung cancer, prostate cancer, breast cancer and osteosarcoma. Another isotope, samarium-149, is a strong neutron <b>absorber</b> and is therefore added to the control rods of nuclear reactors. It is also formed as a decay product during the reactor operation {{and is one of the}} important factors considered in the reactor design and operation. Other applications of samarium include catalysis of chemical reactions, radioactive dating and an X-ray laser.|$|E
5|$|The nuclei {{of several}} hafnium {{isotopes}} can each absorb multiple neutrons. This makes hafnium a good material {{for use in}} the control rods for nuclear reactors. Its neutron-capture cross-section is about 600 times that of zirconium. (Other elements that are good neutron-absorbers for control rods are cadmium and boron.) Excellent mechanical properties and exceptional corrosion-resistance properties allow its use in the harsh environment of pressurized water reactors. The German research reactor FRM II uses hafnium as a neutron <b>absorber.</b> It is also common in military reactors, particularity in US naval reactors, but seldom found in civilian ones, the first core of the Shippingport Atomic Power Station (a conversion of a naval reactor) being a notable exception.|$|E
5|$|For the 1980 Grand Prix season, the Yamaha factory {{made the}} Yamaha USA team of Roberts and Carruthers {{the de facto}} factory racing team.

Roberts won the first three races as the Suzuki team appeared to be in disarray, but by the third race, the Suzukis of Mamola and Marco Lucchinelli were making things more difficult for Roberts. Roberts' Yamaha suffered a deflating front tire and a faulty rear shock <b>absorber</b> in the Netherlands forcing him {{to pull out of the}} race, but his main championship rivals also suffered setbacks with Cecotto, Ferrari and Hartog all missing races due to injuries and Sheene suffering mechanical breakdowns. Suzuki riders went on to win the last four races, but Roberts had built up a sufficient point lead to hold on and clinch his third consecutive 500cc world championship.|$|E

40|$|Using {{metamaterial}} <b>absorbers,</b> we {{have shown}} that metallic layers in the <b>absorbers</b> do not necessarily constitute undesired resistive heating problem for photovoltaics.

40|$|UV <b>absorbers</b> and {{antioxidants}} topically {{applied to}} upholstery fabrics to reduce fading, separately and {{in conjunction with}} soil repellent finish formulations containing UV <b>absorbers,</b> were evaluated in this study. Over fifty upholstery fabrics were initially evaluated and fourteen were selected for further study. The fabrics were then topically treated with commercially available soil repellent finishes (a fluorocarbon and a silicone finish) containing UV <b>absorbers</b> or immersion-treated with one of thirteen UV <b>absorbers</b> or antioxidants. Following light exposure, color changes were evaluated visually and instrumentally. The results showed that neither the fluorocarbon nor silicone-based soil repellent finishes containing UV <b>absorbers</b> significantly reduced fading in the upholstery fabrics.
