According to its terms, the two provinces of Korçë and Gjirokastër that constituted Northern Epirus would acquire complete <b>autonomous</b> <b>existence</b> (as a corpus separatum) under the nominal Albanian sovereignty of Prince Wied. The Albanian government had the right to appoint and dismiss governors and upper-rank officials, taking into account as much as possible the opinion of the local population. Other terms included the proportional recruitment of natives into the local gendarmerie and the prohibition of military levies from people not indigenous to the region. In Orthodox schools, the Greek language would be the sole medium of instruction, {{with the exception of the}} first three classes. The use of the Greek language was made equal to Albanian in all public affairs. The Ottoman-era privileges of Himarë were renewed, and a foreigner was to be appointed as its [...] "captain" [...] for 10 years.|$|E

2500|$|The third {{consequence}} of the Berber revolt was {{the collapse of the}} authority of the Damascus Caliphate over the western provinces. With the Umayyad Caliphs distracted by the challenge of the Abbasids in the east, the western provinces of the Maghreb and al-Andalus spun out of their control. From around 745, the Fihrids, an illustrious local Arab clan descended from Oqba ibn Nafi al-Fihri, seized power in the western provinces and ruled them almost as a private family empire of their own – Abd al-Rahman ibn Habib al-Fihri in Ifriqiya and Yūsuf al-Fihri in al-Andalus. The Fihrids welcomed the fall of the Umayyads in the east, in 750, and sought to reach an understanding with the Abbasids, hoping they might be allowed to continue their <b>autonomous</b> <b>existence.</b> [...] But when the Abbasids rejected the offer and demanded submission, the Fihrids declared independence and, probably out of spite, invited the deposed remnants of the Umayyad clan to take refuge in their dominions. It was a fateful decision that they soon regretted, for the Umayyads, the sons and grandsons of caliphs, had a more legitimate claim to rule than the Fihrids themselves. Rebellious-minded local lords, disenchanted with the autocratic rule of the Fihrids, conspired with the arriving Umayyad exiles.|$|E

40|$|Historical {{arguments}} against the Husserlian phenomenological reduction stem from two mutually independent sources. First, some adherents of {{the so called}} realistic phenomenology understand the reduction as {{the rejection of the}} belief in the <b>autonomous</b> world’s <b>existence,</b> and this view seems untenable to them. Second, for some proponents of Heidegger’s philosophy from Sein und Zeit period reduction means disentanglement of the human being from the world, which is quite impossible. The article touches only the first group of these arguments (the second one is the theme of another paper). But, first of all, contrary to the common anti-reductionist stance, the author states that the reduction is a performable procedure. He also considers reduction to be the wide-spread operation of the Western philosophy, though being practised without the explicit knowledge concerning it...|$|R

50|$|The Vingtaine de la Ville {{maintains}} an <b>autonomous</b> financial <b>existence,</b> unlike other vingtaines in Jersey, {{thanks to an}} endowment which has its origins in the purchase of Le Mont de la Ville by the British government in 1804. Formerly, Le Mont de la Ville, a craggy plateau overlooking the town of St. Helier, was topped by open common land used for grazing and rabbit hunting. In 1785 part of the plateau was levelled as a parade ground, {{which led to the}} discovery of a dolmen which the vingtaine presented to the Lieutenant Governor of Jersey, Marshal Conway, who subsequently transported it to his estate at Henley-on-Thames where it was re-erected. As it is now a listed monument in the United Kingdom, attempts to have it returned to Jersey have been to no avail. The continuing Napoleonic threat persuaded the British government to fortify the hill and Fort Regent was constructed. The proceeds from the sale established the original fund that lay at the foundation of the finances managed by the vingtaine's two elected procureurs today.|$|R

50|$|Schwarz's living {{system model}} is a summary {{of much of the}} {{knowledge}} of complex adaptive systems, but succinctly compressed as a graphical generic metamodel. It is this capacity of compression that establishes it as a new theoretical structure that is beyond the concept of autopoiesis/self-production proposed by Humberto Maturana, through the concept of autogenesis. While the concept of autogenesis has not had the collective coherence that autopoiesis has, Schwarz clearly defined it as a network of self-creation processes and firmly integrated it with relevant theory in complexity in a way not previously done. The outcome illustrates how a complex and adaptive viable system is able to survive - maintaining an <b>autonomous</b> durable <b>existence</b> within the confines of its own constraints. The nature of viable systems is that they should have at least potential independence in their processes of regulation, organisation, production, and cognition. The generic model provides a holistic relationship between the attributes that explains the nature of viable systems and how they survive. It addresses the emergence and possible evolution of organisations towards complexity and autonomy intended to refer to any domain of system (e.g., biological, social, or cognitive).|$|R
40|$|Abstract- Dynamical systems {{based on}} {{distributed}} elements can exhibit complex <b>autonomous</b> behavior. Simultaneous <b>existence</b> of separate stable dynamic states (attractors) and the transitions between them can model {{certain forms of}} epileptic discharge. Multi-stable systems have also been proposed for storage and retrieval of activation patterns. Here we consider systems with alternative types of collective behavior. In these systems emergent intermittency allows for autonomous switching between turbulent (chaotic) and laminar phases. We demonstrate that the distributions of the duration of various phases have distinctive statistical properties, different from those in multi-stable systems that are driven by stochastic processes. These properties are proposed to identify and classify mechanisms that may underlie paroxysmal activity as revealed in electrophysiological recordings of epileptiform activity.

The study of these relationships casts a new light on the ways herders perceive and relate to domestic and wild animals.

Since they believed that witchcraft is inherited, an autopsy of an accused witch would also prove that a particular living person, related to the deceased, was or was not a witch. Mangu is thought to be passed down from parent to child of the same sex — from father to son or from mother to daughter. Therefore if a man were to be proven to possess witchcraft substance, this conclusion would extend to that man's father, sons, brothers, and so on.|$|E

In the film about art, the filmmaker already operates with the repercussions of an interpretation or conception of the author of the work, which is at the basis of the film. In this case, there is a complex process of interpreting the interpretations through a new language – the cinematic one (reanimation of the image, illumination, cadre, angles, etc.). These films give the opportunity to convince us of the artistic and aesthetic functioning of the mechanisms of this process of connection of the arts; the transfer of the original work in audio-visual language into a product with an <b>autonomous</b> aesthetic <b>existence,</b> realizing its multi-functional purpose, which contains important components such as the valorization of the cultural heritage, the preservation of the images of the works of art, the cultivation of the aesthetic and artistic knowledge of the consumers of the beautiful, and so on...|$|R

40|$|The goal of {{this paper}} is the {{identification}} of the physical processes at the origin of the nonlinear behavior of a plasma conductor when an external constraint gradually departs the system from thermal equilibrium. This reveals the presence of a self-organization scenario whose final product depends on the magnitude of the applied constraint. At first it appears a complexity whose stability is ensured by the presence of an electrical double layer. By increasing the external constraint the complexity transits into an <b>autonomous</b> state whose <b>existence</b> is related to a rhythmic exchange of matter and energy with the surrounding environment, sustained and controlled by a proper dynamics of the double layer. The results are potentially important for developing a general strategy of nonequilibrium physics, suggesting answers to challenging problems concerning the mechanism that could explain the appearance of self-organized complexities in laboratory and nature.
