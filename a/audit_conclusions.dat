40|$|Background Alcohol {{use is a}} {{major public}} health problem with vast {{implications}} for poor, war-torn countries. The objective {{of this study was}} to describe prevalence of alcohol use and risky drinking across socio-demographic factors in South Sudan, and to determine the association between risky drinking, traumatic events and mental distress. Methods This is a randomized, population based, cross-sectional study from the north-western part of South Sudan with nearly 500 participants. We used the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT) as main outcome variable, the General Health Questionnaire (GHQ- 28) for mental distress and five questions to assess traumatic events. Results The mean AUDIT score was 2. 7 (SD 0. 3) with 14, 2  % in the high risk problem drinking category. Being male, lack of a regular income and psychological distress were significantly associated with higher AUDIT score. Traumatic events, however, was not associated with higher score on <b>AUDIT.</b> <b>Conclusion</b> Despite decades of civil war and great poverty the alcohol use in this population was at the same level as other countries in Southern Africa.

40|$|Background : The Nigerian Institute of Medical Research houses two {{reference}} laboratories: the virology and tuberculosis laboratories. Both {{were enrolled}} in the Strengthening Laboratory Management Toward Accreditation (SLMTA) programme. Objective: To describe the impact of SLMTA and discuss factors affecting the results, with an emphasis on mentorship. Methods : The SLMTA programme was implemented from April 2010 through November 2012. Participants attended three workshops and executed quality improvement projects; laboratory auditors evaluated performance using a standard checklist. The virology laboratory did not receive mentorship; however, the tuberculosis laboratory had an international mentor who visited the laboratory four times during the programme, spending two to four weeks embedded within the laboratory during each visit. Results : There was an overall improvement in the performance of both laboratories, with the virology laboratory increasing 13 % (from 80 % at baseline to 93 % at exit audit) and the tuberculosis laboratory increasing 29 % (from 66 % to 95 %). These scores were maintained nine months later at the surveillance <b>audit.</b> <b>Conclusion</b> : The SLMTA programme resulted in improved and sustained quality management performance for both laboratories. Mentoring was a possible factor in the substantial improvement made by the tuberculosis laboratory and should be considered in order to augment the training received from the SLMTA workshops. </p...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this audit was to {{evaluate}} the effectiveness of the unclassified computer security program at the Germantown Headquarters Administrative Computer Center (Center). The Department of Energy (DOE) relies on the application systems at the Germantown Headquarters Administrative Computer Center to support its financial, payroll and personnel, security, and procurement functions. The review was limited to an evaluation of the administrative, technical, and physical safeguards governing utilization of the unclassified computer system which hosts many of the Department`s major application systems. The audit identified weaknesses in the Center`s computer security program that increased the risk of unauthorized disclosure or loss of sensitive data. Specifically, the authors found that (1) access to sensitive data was not limited to individuals who had a need for the information, and (2) accurate and complete information was not maintained on the inventory of tapes at the Center. Furthermore, the risk of unauthorized disclosure and loss of sensitive data was increased because other controls, such as physical security, had not been adequately implemented at the Center.

Design a prospective collaborative audit over twelve months (November 1994 to October 1995) involving all surgeons undertaking CEA within one English health region. Methods audit standards were agreed by all participating surgeons {{at the outset}} based on existing national guidelines. Data were abstracted from clinical notes. Outcomes were reviewed by clinicians 30 days post-surgery. A confidential individualised report of the results was provided to each surgeon. A survey of participating surgeons sought {{to evaluate}} the audit process. Results ten surgeons performed 139 CEAs on 134 individuals (64 % men). Median per surgeon was 12 (range 1 – 44). Audit standards were generally achieved: 114 (82 %) patients had symptomatic carotid stenosis of 70 – 99 %, 14 (10 %) were asymptomatic. The median time from first referral to hospital to operation was 4. 8 months (interquartile range 3. 0 – 7. 3).

40|$|The article’s {{objective}} is to demonstrate the causality of risks involved in the audit, {{in order to minimize}} the audit risk associated with formulating the adequate <b>audit</b> <b>conclusion</b> based on the risks of the company’s financial reporting and the effectiveness of company’s internal control. The meaning of entrepreneurial risk and risk management methods at company level are discussed, with emphasizing the impact of risks on the reliability of financial reporting. Four components of the risk involved in external audit are outlined and discussed: entrepreneurial risk, risk of financial reporting, risk of taking obligations, risk of audit. The causality between risk components having impact on audit is illustrated. The essence and methods of risk management in audit are analyzed. It is demonstrated that the {{issue of whether or not}} a client be accepted for audit service and whether or not the audit-based cooperation with it be prolonged constitutes a primary decision with respect to each audit. Factors behind the auditor’s decision to accept a new client or continue to work with the previous one are highlighted.

40|$|Abstract Background The indications, {{complexity}} and capabilities of cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) have rapidly expanded. Whether actual service provision and training have developed in parallel is unknown. Methods We undertook a systematic telephone and postal survey of all public hospitals {{on behalf of}} the British Society of Cardiovascular Magnetic Resonance to identify all CMR providers within the United Kingdom. Results Of the 60 CMR centres identified, 88 % responded to a detailed questionnaire. Services are led by cardiologists and radiologists in equal proportion, though the majority of current trainees are cardiologists. The mean number of CMR scans performed annually per centre increased by 44 % over two years. This trend was consistent across centres of different scanning volumes. The commonest indication for CMR was assessment of heart failure and cardiomyopathy (39 %), followed by coronary artery disease and congenital heart disease. There was striking geographical variation in CMR availability, numbers of scans performed, and distribution of trainees. Centres without on site scanning capability refer very few patients for CMR. Just over half of centres had a formal training programme, and few performed regular <b>audit.</b> <b>Conclusion</b> The number of CMR scans performed in the UK has increased dramatically in just two years. Trainees are mainly located in large volume centres and enrolled in cardiology as opposed to radiology training programmes. </p...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} the control and audit of the state budget. The main {{objective}} is to evaluate the control and audit of state budget in the Czech Republic and provide recommendations. To achieve this objective, content analysis of literature and laws is done. Then based on the database of Budget Practices and Procedures Database, analysis of the responses of OECD countries is made.

From obtained knowledge and appreciation of the situation in the Czech Republic recommendations are proposed. In the area of internal audit is strictly necessary to separate the internal auditing function and increase the number of performance audits. In the area of external audit is essential to strengthen the powers of the Supreme Audit Office and legislatively adjust the annual audit of state budget. For the implementation of a performance audit carried out by the supreme audit institutions is necessary to eliminate the mistake in the law on the Supreme Audit Office, where it is not requirement of control effectiveness.

40|$|Abstract Background The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} the standard tasks performed by clinical research coordinators (CRCs) in oncology clinical trials. Methods Forty-one CRCs were anonymously surveyed, using a four-page self-administered questionnaire focused on demographics, qualifications, and professional experience. The survey questions on responsibilities consisted of an ad-hoc 32 -item questionnaire where respondents had to rate the frequency of involvement in the listed activities using a 3 -point scale. We defined as "standard" a task that was rated as "in all or nearly all trials" by at least half of the respondents. Results A response rate of 90 % (37 out of 41) was achieved after two mailings. Less than half of the respondents had received additional training in oncology, clinical research or Good Clinical Practices (GCP). Overall, all standard tasks performed by CRCs were in the category of "monitoring activities" (those usually performed by a Clinical Research Associate "CRA") and included patient registration/randomization, recruitment follow-up, case report form completion, collaboration with the CRA, serious adverse events reporting, handling of investigator files, and preparing the site for and/or attending <b>audits.</b> <b>Conclusions</b> CRCs play a key role in the implementation of oncology clinical trials, which goes far beyond mere data collection and/or administrative support, and directly contributes to the gathering of good quality data. </p...|$|R

40|$|This report {{argues that}} the {{strength}} of the Commission of <b>Audit’s</b> <b>conclusions</b> is not supported by the depth of its evidence. Overview Governments are not like businesses. They provide services because the citizens demand them, not because delivering them is profitable. They collect taxes from citizens, not charge prices from customers. While a business has a legal responsibility to maximise the dividends it pays its shareholders, it makes no sense for a government to generate a surplus from its own citizens. Tony Shepherd’s National Commission of Audit is a deeply flawed document, but its deepest flaw is its authors’ belief that a government should systematically seek to collect more tax each year than it spends. That is, while the report talks about intergenerational equity, the most inequitable thing a government could do would be to collect surplus tax revenue from one generation in order to leave a subsequent generation lower levels of education and infrastructure and a slightly larger bank balance. The Commission focusses on the need for the government to sustain public finances but barely discusses the role of government in sustaining the health of Australia’s citizens, its communities and its environment. There is no doubt that governments must make sustainable long-run decisions about tax and expenditure. There is also no doubt that the decisions it makes about how to improve the sustainability of our finances can have significant impacts on the sustainability of the broader systems on which our economy is built...|$|R

DESIGN [...] Semistructured interviews. SETTING [...] Four purchaser and provider pairings in the former Northern Region of the National Health Service (NHS) in England. SUBJECTS [...] Chief executives, contracts managers, quality and audit leaders, directors of public health, consultants, general practitioners, audit support staff, and practice managers (total 42). MAIN MEASURES [...] Attitudes on the present state and future development of clinical audit. RESULTS [...] Purchasers and providers shared common views on the purpose of clinical audit, but there were important differences in their views on the level and appropriateness of involvement of health care purchasers, integration with present NHS structures and processes (including contracting and the internal market), priority setting for clinical audit, the effects of clinical audit on service development and purchasing, change in behaviour, and the sharing of information on the outcomes of clinical <b>audit.</b> <b>CONCLUSIONS</b> [...] There are important differences in attitudes towards, and expectations of, clinical audit between health care purchasers and providers, at least in part due to the limited contact between them on audit to date.

40|$|Background. Intussusception {{remains the}} most common cause of bowel {{obstruction}} in infants and toddlers and can result in considerable morbidity and mortality if not properly treated. The aim of this study was to determine the success rate of air intussesception reduction (AIR), and to identify factors predicting an unsuccessful procedure, among paediatric patients diagnosed with idiopathic intussusception at the Bloemfontein Academic Hospital Complex, Free State, South Africa. Methods. This retrospective analytic cohort study assessed data from the records of all paediatric patients with the diagnosis of idiopathic intussusception discharged from the Department of Paediatric Surgery between 1 January 2003 and 30 September 2011. Results. Thirty-five children with intussusception were identified. AIR enemas were performed in 18 children (51. 4 %), with successful reduction in 2 (11. 1 %). Seventeen children (48. 6 %) were primarily treated surgically without attempting radiological reduction. Successful AIR was more likely if the duration of symptoms was < 48 hours. Sixteen patients in whom AIR was attempted eventually required surgical intervention, either due to perforation during AIR or irreducibility. Approximately 94 % of children required bowel resection at surgery. In 37. 5 % of cases AIR was complicated by perforation, making surgical treatment mandatory. Nine patients (56. 3 %) had unsuccessful AIR without perforation, but needed bowel resection at surgery. One patient (6. 3 %) required manual reduction only, without the need for bowel resection at surgery. No deaths were recorded during the period covered by this <b>audit.</b> <b>Conclusions.</b> Our institution’s radiological reduction outcomes were not comparable to international standards. The only statistically significant predictor of poor outcome of AIR was time delay before attempted reduction...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Although {{clinical}} audit {{is an important}} instrument for quality care improvement, the concept {{has not yet been}} adequately taken on board in rural settings in most resource limited countries where the problem of maternal mortality is immense. Maternal mortality and morbidity audit was established at Saint Francis Designated District Hospital (SFDDH) in rural Tanzania in order to generate information upon which to base interventions. Methods Methods are informed by the principles of operations research. An audit system was established, all patients fulfilling the inclusion criteria for maternal mortality and severe morbidity were reviewed and selected cases were audited from October 2008 to July 2010. The causes and underlying factors were identified and strategic action plans for improvement were developed and implemented. Results There were 6572 deliveries and 363 severe maternal morbidities of which 36 women died making institutional case fatality rate of 10 %. Of all morbidities 341 (94 %) had at least one area of substandard care. Patients, health workers and administration related substandard care factors were identified in 50 % - 61 % of women with severe morbidities. Improving responsiveness to obstetric emergencies, capacity building of the workforce for health care, referral system improvement and upgrading of health centres located in hard to reach areas to provide comprehensive emergency obstetric care (CEmOC) were proposed and implemented as a result of <b>audit.</b> <b>Conclusions</b> Our findings indicate that audit can be implemented in rural resource limited settings and suggest {{that the vast majority of}} maternal mortalities and severe morbidities can be averted even where resources are limited if strategic interventions are implemented. </p...|$|E

This audit was self-initiated and addresses financial risk. The objective of our audit was to determine whether internal controls over stamp, cash, and money order accountabilities; financial differences; employee items; and disbursements at the selected sites were in place and effective. See Appendix A for additional information about this <b>audit.</b> <b>Conclusion</b> We visited five Gateway District post offices and stations with high-risk accounting activities according to our PARIS Cost and Controls model. We identified internal control and compliance issues at these sites related to stamp, cash, and money order accountabilities; financial differences; 1 employee items; and disbursements. In addition, we identified similar issues at five other sites in the Gateway District that we audited during fiscal year (FY) 2009. 2 We attribute these internal control deficiencies to an insufficient district-wide monitoring program that identified high-risk offices but did not hold unit managers accountable for implementing and documenting corrective actions. As a result, Gateway District post offices, stations, and branches are at an increased risk of losing cash, accountable items, and revenue without detection; and misstating financial records. We identified $ 171, 000 in monetary impact and approximately $ 1. 9 million in non-monetary impact as a result of unit managers not effectively implementing internal controls. 1 Financial differences are unreconciled expense entries that must be researched and resolved in a timely manner...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Prior audit {{research}} has established that tacit knowledge {{plays a key}} role in relatively experienced auditors ’ performance evaluations (Tan and Libby [1997]), but also that tacit knowledge can improve relatively inexperienced auditors ’ ability to reach better-justified <b>audit</b> <b>conclusions</b> (Shankar and Tan [2006]). In addition, an easily overlooked finding in Tan and Libby [1997] is that even inexperienced auditors sometimes possess tacit knowledge levels rivaling that of top-rated experienced auditors. An important research question, therefore, is whether valuable tacit knowledge possessed by inexperienced auditors is consistently valued by audit firms. To address this question, we rely on real-world pairings of audit supervisors and subordinates (e. g., Kennedy and Peecher [1997]) to empirically test the following hypotheses: (1) Staff and senior audit subordinates with higher tacit knowledge levels are more likely to be identified as future leaders by their supervisors; (2) Staff and senior auditors ’ tacit knowledge is positively associated with their exposures to diverse professional experiences, opportunities to interact with clients, significance of their job responsibilities, and involvement with their firm’s social and community activities; (3) Audit supervisors with higher tacit knowledge better cultivate their subordinates ’ tacit knowledge; and (4) Relative to those with lower tacit knowledge, audit supervisors with higher tacit knowledge place greater relative weight on subordinates ’ tacit knowledge than on their technical knowledge when evaluating annual performance. Our findings are consistent with all four of our hypotheses and contribute to the audit expertise, human capital development, and compensation contracting literatures in accounting.

40|$|OBJECTIVE [...] To canvass {{the views}} of all general {{practitioners}} and consultants working in Newcastle upon Tyne {{on the content of}} referral letters and replies, the feasibility of standardising certain aspects of referral letters, and the use of communications data for audit purposes. DESIGN [...] A postal questionnaire was sent to all general practitioners and consultants in Newcastle upon Tyne in May 1991. Questions were asked about the clinical and administrative content of letters, the utility of standard categories to state the reason for referral, the idea of using letters for feedback purposes, and communications as a potential topic for professionally led audit. SETTING [...] Area served by Newcastle upon Tyne Family Health Services Authority and District Health Authority. RESULTS [...] Replies were received from 274 (77 %) doctors (115 general practitioners and 159 consultants). A majority (225; 82 %) were in favour of items defined as "always important" forming a minimum requirement for referral letters and for consultants' replies. Using standardised categories to state the reason for referral was not endorsed: 102 (89 %) general practitioners and 132 (83 %) consultants preferred referrers to use their own words. Using referral communications to provide feedback was less popular with consultants (54; 34 %) than general practitioners (72; 63 %).

MAIN MEASURES [...] Attitudes to and perceptions of child health surveillance and audit. Questionnaires were completed by 440 general practitioners (response rate 73 %), 164 health visitors (60 %), and 39 clinical medical officers (93 %). RESULTS [...] Attitudes to child health surveillance were less positive among general practitioners than health visitors or clinical medical officers. Few respondents agreed that child health surveillance was a cost effective use of general practitioners' time (general practitioners 28 %, 113 / 407; health visitors 28 %, 40 / 145; clinical medical officers 39 %, 15 / 39) and most thought that health visitors should carry out more of the doctors' examinations (68 %, 262 / 387; 65 %, 89 / 136; 66 %, 25 / 38). General practitioners thought that clinical medical officers were less supportive than other relevant groups of their doing more child health surveillance. Most (72 %, 105 / 146) health visitors thought that the 1990 contract had reduced parental choice of where to attend for child health surveillance. General practitioners were less enthusiastic than health visitors about most forms of clinical <b>audit.</b> <b>CONCLUSIONS</b> [...] Despite reservations {{about the impact of}} recent changes all groups were willing to explore innovative ways of delivering child health surveillance. IMPLICATIONS [...] There is scope for health visitors to increase their responsibilities and for more varied relationships between general practitioners and community child health doctors...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background the {{objective}} {{of this study was to}} evaluate the impact of annual review of the infection control practice in all Ministry of Health hospitals in the holy city of Makkah, Saudi Arabia, during the Hajj period of four lunar Islamic years, 1423 to 1426 corresponding to 2003 to 2006. Methods audit of infection control service was conducted annually over a 10 -day period in six community hospitals with bed capacities ranging from 140 to 557 beds. Data were collected on standardized checklists on various infection control service items during surprise visits to the medical, pediatric, surgical, and critical care units, and the kitchens. Percentage scores were calculated for audited items. The results of the audit for hospitals were confidentially sent to them within four weeks after the end of Hajj. Results deficiencies observed in the first audit included lack of infection control committees, infection control units, infection control educational activities, and surveillance system and shortage of staff. These deficiencies were resolved in the subsequent audits. The average (range) scores of hospitals in 11 infection control items increased from 43 % (20 – 67 %) in the first audit to 78 % (61 – 93 %) in the fourth <b>audit.</b> <b>Conclusion</b> regular hospital infection control audits lead to significant improvement of infection control practice. There is a need to build a rigorous infection control audit into hospitals' ongoing monitoring and reporting to the Ministry of Health and to provide these hospitals with feed back on such audits to continuously strengthen the safety standards for patients, visitors, and employees. </p...|$|R
40|$|This report {{presents}} the results of our audit of financial accountability in the Philadelphia Metropolitan District (Project Number 09 BD 015 FF 000). We conducted this audit at 13 judgmentally selected post offices, stations, and branches. 1 This audit was self-initiated and addresses financial risk based on factors evaluated by U. S. Postal Service Office of Inspector General (OIG) Performance and Results Information System (PARIS) models. See Appendix A for additional information about this <b>audit.</b> <b>Conclusion</b> We identified 135 of 302 Philadelphia District post offices, stations, and branches with high-risk accounting activities based on our PARIS Cost and Controls model. Of 13 sites visited, we found 80 internal control and compliance issues related to stamp accountabilities, disbursements, and financial accounting and reporting. Further, we identified similar issues at eight randomly selected sites conducted in the Philadelphia Metropolitan District over the past 3 years in support of audits of the U. S. Postal Service’s financial statements. We attribute the internal control deficiencies to insufficient training, financial background, and oversight of the managers and supervisors responsible for implementing financial internal controls. As a result, Philadelphia District post offices, stations, and branches are at an increased risk of losing cash, accountable items, and revenue without detection; and misstating financial records. We identified $ 945, 487 in monetary and $ 1, 124, 353 in non-monetary impact as a result of managers not effectively implementing internal controls. 1 We initially selected five sites to audit: xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx We expanded our audit to visit eight additional sites to review master trust accounts: xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx...|$|R
40|$|This report {{presents}} the results of our financial installation audits of 105 post offices, stations, and branches for fiscal year (FY) 2008 (Project Number 08 BD 001 FF 000). We conducted this work in support of the audit of the U. S. Postal Service’s financial statements. Appendix A presents additional information about this <b>audit.</b> <b>Conclusion</b> Based on the items we reviewed, financial transactions were reasonably and fairly presented in the accounting records, and, generally, the internal controls we examined were in place and effective. In Appendix B, we identify one location where controls, overall, were not effective, and eight additional locations where major segments of post office internal controls were not effective. Appendix C lists each issue reported during FY 2008 and the number of units where the issue was also reported in FYs 2006 and 2007. Appendix D presents statistical projections of the number of units with the 10 most frequently reported internal control deficiencies. In our FY 2007 capping report, 3 we disclosed similar internal control deficiencies and recommended the Postal Service develop and implement an action plan to measurably reduce or eliminate the reported deficiencies. In FY 2008, the Postal Service developed an action plan to address the control deficiencies and is currently implementing their plan; therefore, we are not making a similar recommendation in this report. We made recommendations to district management addressing internal control and compliance issues at each installation. District management’s comments were responsive to our findings, recommendations, and $ 819, 602 in monetary an...|$|R
