25|$|When the Nasdaq Stock Market began {{trading on}} February 8, 1971, {{it was the}} world's first {{electronic}} stock market. At first, it was merely a quotation system and did not provide a way to perform electronic trades. The Nasdaq Stock Market helped lower the spread (the difference between the bid price and the <b>ask</b> <b>price</b> of the stock) but was unpopular among brokerages which made much of their money on the spread.|$|E

Neither would he allow {{questions}} as to whether she'd had sexual intercourse with Carter or Gilley.

2500|$|Unlike a stock market, {{the foreign}} {{exchange}} market is divided into levels of access. At the top is the interbank {{foreign exchange market}}, which {{is made up of}} the largest commercial banks and securities dealers. Within the interbank market, spreads, which are the difference between the bid and ask prices, are razor sharp and not known to players outside the inner circle. The difference between the bid and ask prices widens (for example from 0 to 1 pip to 1–2 pips for currencies such as the EUR) as you go down the levels of access. This is due to volume. If a trader can guarantee large numbers of transactions for large amounts, they can demand a smaller difference between the bid and <b>ask</b> <b>price,</b> which is referred to as a better spread. The levels of access that make up the foreign exchange market are determined {{by the size of the}} [...] "line" [...] (the amount of money with which they are trading). The top-tier interbank market accounts for 51% of all transactions. From there, smaller banks, followed by large multi-national corporations (which need to hedge risk and pay employees in different countries), large hedge funds, and even some of the retail market makers. According to Galati and Melvin, “Pension funds, insurance companies, mutual funds, and other institutional investors have played an increasingly important role in financial markets in general, and in FX markets in particular, since the early 2000s.” (2004) In addition, he notes, “Hedge funds have grown markedly over the 2001–2004 period in terms of both number and overall size”. Central banks also participate in the foreign exchange market to align currencies to their economic needs.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} impact of two {{commonly}} used <b>asking</b> <b>price</b> strategies on house sales prices. In particular, we compare a dynamic <b>asking</b> <b>price,</b> where the seller adjusts her <b>asking</b> <b>price</b> over time as she fails to sell her property, with a static <b>asking</b> <b>price,</b> where the seller sets an <b>asking</b> <b>price</b> and sticks to it until the property is sold. While we show this comparison to be ambiguous from a theoretical perspective, our empirical study, using a comprehensive dataset of the properties sold in the greater Sydney region in 2011, indicates that properties with a dynamic <b>asking</b> <b>price</b> sold, on average, for approximately 1. 9 per cent less than properties with a static <b>asking</b> <b>price.</b> In addition, we show that, controlling for the <b>asking</b> <b>price</b> strategy, the duration of sale has {{a significant impact on}} sales prices...|$|R

5000|$|Layering is a {{strategy}} in high-frequency trading where a trader makes and then cancels orders that they never intend to have executed in hopes of influencing the stock price. For instance, to buy stock at a lower price, the trader initially places orders to sell {{at or above the}} market <b>ask</b> <b>price.</b> This may cause the market's best <b>ask</b> <b>price</b> to fall as other market participants lower their asking prices because they perceive selling pressure as they see the sell orders being entered on the order book. The trader may place subsequent sell orders for the security at successively lower prices as the best <b>ask</b> <b>price</b> falls (to increase the appearance of selling interest). After the price has fallen sufficiently, the trader makes a real trade, buying the stock at the now lower best <b>ask</b> <b>price,</b> and cancels all the sell orders. [...] It is considered a form of stock market manipulation.|$|E

With risk-neutrality, the optimal <b>asking</b> <b>price</b> exceeds the optimal fixed price when the expected gain is a strictly concave function.

40|$|We {{conducted}} an {{experimental study of}} price competition in a duopolistic market.
