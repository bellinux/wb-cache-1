40|$|Membrane {{splitting}} by freeze-fracture (2) {{could provide}} chemical {{information about the}} transmembrane distribution of constituents if the individual halves of the membrane could be analyzed separately. One means of analysis is the detection of membrane-incorporated radioisotopic labels by autoradiography after freeze-fracturing (6). We have examined three model systems, two nonbiological and one biomembrane, that test the feasibility of combining freeze-fracture with electron microscope autoradiography (FARG) and that demonstrate FARG's potential in studies of biomembrane organization. We describe here a method for the formation and application of a dry, parlodion-stabilized monolayer of <b>autoradiographic</b> <b>emulsion</b> to frozen replicas of fractured surfaces (Fig. 1) ...|$|E
40|$|We {{report a}} method which {{combines}} epifluorescence microscopy and microautoradiography to determine both {{the total number}} of microorganisms in natural water populations and those individual organisms active in the uptake of specific substrates. After incubation with 3 H-labeled substrate, the sample is filtered and, while still on the filter, mounted directly in a film of <b>autoradiographic</b> <b>emulsion</b> on a microscope slide. The microautoradiogram is processed and stained with acridine orange, and, subsequently, the filter is removed before microscopic observation. This novel preparation resulted in increased accuracy in direct counts made from the autoradiogram, improved sensitivity in the recognition of uptake-active (3 H-labeled) organisms, and enumeration of a significantly greater number of labeled organisms compared with corresponding samples prepared by a previously reported method...|$|E
40|$|We {{present a}} simple and {{improved}} method for in situ localization of albumin and collagen mRNAs in isolated mouse hepatocytes. The cells were isolated by collagenase perfusion, mincing, and differential centrifugation. Nick-translated 3 H-labeled mouse albumin cDNA (pmalb- 2) and chicken pro-alpha 2 (I) collagen cDNA (pCg 45) probes were then hybridized with the cells in silane-treated microcentrifuge tubes. The cells were transferred and fixed to a microscope slide and hybridization was evaluated semiquantitatively by counting exposure of grains in <b>autoradiographic</b> <b>emulsion</b> placed over the cells. With this method of in situ hybridization, all hepatocytes appear to have significant, but highly variable, amounts of albumin mRNA. In addition, type I procollagen mRNA appears to be present at low abundance in hepatocytes. These results indicate that in situ hybridization can effectively demonstrate the presence of specific low- or high-abundance mRNAs in isolated well-differentiated eukaryotic cells...|$|E
40|$|We {{present a}} high-speed, {{high-resolution}} imager of beta particles. It {{is devoted to}} be used in autoradiography experiments such as receptor binding or in situ hybridization experiments, either instead of, or in complement with <b>autoradiographic</b> film and <b>emulsions.</b> It allows the user to locate and perform quantitative analyses of (H- 3, C- 14, S- 35, P- 33, P- 32, I- 125) labelled molecules with a 15 mu m spatial resolution on a 0. 9 x 1. 3 cm(2) sensitive area.

40|$|We {{investigated}} endothelin (ET) receptors in the endometrium and the myometrium {{obtained from}} pre-menopausal 39 -, 40 -, and 49 -year-old women, using quantitative receptor and <b>emulsion</b> <b>autoradiographic</b> methods with 125 I-endothelin- 1 (125 I-ET- 1) [radioligand for the ET receptors], BQ- 123 [specific antagonist of the ETA receptor], and sarafotoxin S 6 c [agonist for the ETB receptor]. The radioligand binding reached a maximum at 36 hr of incubation and a plateau was maintained {{for up to}} 72 hr. No degradation of 125 I-ET- 1 during incubation was observed at 72 hr. In cold-ligand saturation binding studies 125 I-ET- 1 bound with a single affinity to the endometrium and the myometrium. In the myometrium the ETA receptor {{was found to be}} predominantly present, and also a considerable amount of the ETB receptor was quantified. There was a significant amount of the ETA and the ETB receptor in the endometrium, and the emulsion autroradiographic technique we used revealed the ETA and the ETB receptor to be on stroma cells and glandular epithelial cells, respectively. The existence of the the ETA and the ETB receptor in the endometrium and the myometrium supports the physiological significance of ET family of peptodes in the human uterus...|$|R
40|$|By {{using in}} situ {{hybridization}} methodology, we have directly examined primary lymph node and peripheral blood from patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) and AIDS-related complex {{for the presence of}} human T-lymphotropic virus type III (HTLV-III) viral RNA. Mononuclear cell preparations were hybridized with a 35 S-labeled HTLV-III-specific RNA probe and exposed to <b>autoradiographic</b> <b>emulsion</b> for 2 days. HTLV-III-infected cells expressing viral RNA were detected in approximately 86 % (6 / 7) of lymph node and 50 % (7 / 14) of peripheral blood samples studied. However, in all patient samples examined, labeled cells were observed at very low frequency (less than 0. 01 % of total mononuclear cells). The HTLV-III-infected cells exhibited morphological characteristics consistent with that of lymphocytes and expressed viral RNA at relatively low abundance (20 - 300 copies per cell). These results demonstrate that HTLV-III expression in lymph node and peripheral blood is very low in vivo. Furthermore, the lymph node hyperplasia observed in HTLV-III-associated lymphadenopathy is not directly due to proliferation of HTLV-III-infected lymphocytes...|$|E
40|$|This {{paper is}} the first report {{on the use of}} the {{electron}} microscopy autoradiography technique to detect metabolically tritium labeled sphingolipids in intact cells in culture. To label cell sphingolipids, human fibroblasts in culture were fed by a 24 hours pulse, repeated 5 times, of 3 x 10 (- 7) M [1 -H- 3]Sphingosine. [1 -H- 3]sphingosine was efficently taken up by the cells and very rapidly used for the biosynthesis of complex sphingolipids, including neutral glycolipids, gangliosides, ceramide and sphingomyelin. The treatment with [1 -H- 3]sphingosine did not induce any morphological alteration of cell structures, and well preserved cells, plasma membranes, and intracellular organelles could be observed by microscopy. Ultrathin sections from metabolic radiolabeled cells were coated with <b>autoradiographic</b> <b>emulsion.</b> One to four weeks of exposition resulted in pictures where the location of radioactive sphingolipids was evidenced by the characteristic appearance of silver grains as irregular coiled ribbons of metallic silver. Radioactive sphingolipids were found at the level of the plasma membranes, on the endoplasmic reticulum and inside of cytoplasmic vesicles. Thus, electron microscopy autoradiography is a very useful technique to study sphingolipid-enriched membrane domain organization and biosynthesis...|$|E
40|$|Following an {{intraperitoneal}} injection of tritiated thymidine to neonatal mice, livers and spleens were removed and their labelling indices were derived autoradiographically. This {{was done in}} a number of ways: (1) from tissue imprints on gelatinised glass slides; (2) from tissue embedded in JB 4 plastic sectioned at thicknesses of 2, 5 and 7 micron; and (3) from tissue embedded in paraffin wax and sectioned at 7 micron. The results show that the indices from the JB 4 embedded sections increase as the section thickness decreases, and that this relationship persists down to the notional section thickness of zero in the tissue imprints (in which all the cells are in contact with the <b>autoradiographic</b> <b>emulsion).</b> Indices from the 7 micron paraffin wax embedded sections are surprisingly close to the values from the imprints, are higher than indices from the 5 and 7 micron JB 4 embedded sections, and are not significantly different (at the 2 % level) from those from 2 micron JB 4 embedded sections. Possible reasons for these results are discussed in respect of the autoradiographic process and in relationship to various mathematical correction factors which have been proposed to take account of beta-particle self-absorption in thick sections. It is concluded that none of these correction factors is of value and that the embedding medium has an important effect on the observed labelling indices. Comparisons between labelling indices, therefore, should be made only when they are derived from similarly embedded material at the same section thickness...|$|E
40|$|Author: Dr. William H. Heidcamp ### Materials 1. ^ 3 H-Thymidine, {{specific}} activity of 2. 0 - curie/millimole - Onion sets, jars and toothpicks - Alcohol-acetic acid fixative - Materials for feulgen reaction (Exercise 2. 4) - Paraffin embedding, sectioning equipment - Kodak Nuclear Track Emulsion (or equivalent) - Darkroom - Water bath at 42 ° C - Kodak D 19 Developer - Kodak Fixer - Xylol, Permount and coverslips - Microscope ### Procedure 1. Carefully read and follow all precautions for the safe handling of radioactive materials ([Appendix H]([URL] - Place toothpicks into {{the sides of}} an onion and set the onion {{into the top of}} a small jar or beaker. Fill the jar with water and allow the onion to begin root development (3 - 7 days). Mild aeration of the water will assist in the growth of the roots. - Set up another beaker, containing a 10 µ /ml solution of ^ 3 H-thymidine such that there are approximately 10 µc/ml, transfer the onion and its growing roots to the jar containing the radioactive thymidine. - Allow the roots to stay in the radioactive solution for 1 hour at room temperature. - Remove the onion and hold the bulb over a beaker containing water. Rinse the onion roots by dipping several times in the beaker. Transfer the bulb to yet another beaker of aerated water and allow to remain in this beaker for four hours. - Cut off the roots tips and fix in alcohol-acetic acid (3 : 1) overnight. Change the fixative after the first four hours. - Wash the roots in water for several minutes and place in 1 N HCl at 60 ° C for 12 minutes. - Stain the root tips with the Feulgen Reaction as given in Steps 3. b- 3. e of [Exercise 2. 5]([URL] - Dehydrate the root tips, embed in paraffin and section at 10 - 15 microns. Mount on microscope slides. - Deparaffinize in xylol and rehydrate sections by passing first through a series of alcohols and finally in two changes of water. - In a dark room melt some liquid <b>autoradiographic</b> <b>emulsion</b> at a water bath at 42 ° C. - Place two slides back-to-back and dip slowly into the melted emulsion. Remove, allow to drain and place in an appropriate light-proof container and allow them to dry in a vertical position. - When dry, place the slides into an opaque slide box containing drierite. Wrap in aluminum foil and place in a refrigerator. - The slides must stay in the refrigerator until a proper exposure has been made. This can vary from 5 days to over two weeks. After one week, a trial slide should be developed using Steps 15 and 16 below. Examine the slide at 10 X with a bright field microscope and look for the presence of black silver grains located over the cells. A correct exposure is determined by the appearance of silver grains over the cells, but few or no silver grains located in areas without cells. If the appearance of the trial slide is correct, then the remainder should be processed immediately. Repeat an additional trial slide in 2 - 3 days, and repeat every three days thereafter until an adequate exposure is obtained. - Develop the autoradiogram emulsion in the darkroom as follows: - Develop in Kodak D- 19 Developer at 20 ° C for 3 minutes. - Wash for 10 seconds in distilled water. - Fix with Kodak Fixer for 3 minutes. - Wash in running water for 15 minutes. - Dehydrate by placing in 95 % alcohol for 3 minutes. - Place in 100 % alcohol for 3 minutes. - Clear in two changes of xylol for 3 minutes each. - Mount coverslip with Permount. - Draw and label the autoradiograms in the space provided on the following page. Calculate the percent of cells actively undergoing DNA synthesis during the time of exposure to radioactive thymidine. Note that the tissue and the silver grains are in different planes of focus and you will need to constantly switch focus from one plane to the other. ![Figure 1]([URL] "Figure 1 ") Drawing of thymidine incorporation ### Notes This procedure involves the incorporation of a radioactive substance into a cell, and subsequent detection of that material {{through the use of a}} photographic emulsion. The primary source used for cell biology is an organic molecule containing tritium, the radioactive form of hydrogen. Radioactive carbon, phosphorous and iodine are occasionally utilized, but tritium has inherently more resolution than any of the others. Tritiated thymidine (^ 3 H-thymidine) is often used, for example, to study the synthesis and location of DNA. Thymidine is a soluble base which is specific to DNA. It is incorporated into the macromolecular structure of DNA during synthesis and replication of the chromosomes. Upon fixing the cells for standard histological examination, the DNA molecules (with their incorporated, radioactive, thymidine) are precipitated or cross-linked as permanent parts of the cell. Un-incorporated thymidine is removed from the cell, as it remains soluble and is disposed of in the tissue washing procedures. When the tissues are sectioned and applied to a glass slide, they will contain radioactive nuclei, but only those nuclei that were in the S phase of division during the exposure of the cells to ^ 3 H-thymidine. Radioactive sources can not be detected directly, but if a photographic emulsion is applied directly over the section, it will become exposed by the radioactive source. When the photographic emulsion is subsequently processed (i. e. developed), the exposed portions of the emulsion will contain reduced silver grains in direct proportion to the amount of radiation being given off beneath it (in the nuclei of our example). If the exposed, developed slides are now examined with a microscope, there will be two layers of interest. Focusing the microscope on the tissue itself will give a view of the tissue and cell architecture. If the focus of the microscope is moved upward, however, the cells will go out of focus, exactly as the photographic emulsion comes into focus. Within the emulsion will be areas of reduced silver grains and clear areas containing no silver grains. By alternately focusing on the tissue and the emulsion, those nuclei that are radioactive can be readily identified. If desired, the number of silver grains could be counted to give a quantitative measure of ^ 3 H- thymidine incorporation (and thus DNA synthesis), although this is a rather complex procedure to control, with any significant accuracy...|$|E
