5|$|E. When Jos Verstappen stalled his {{car on the}} grid, Race Director Charlie Whiting {{attempted}} to abort the start, a procedure that is carried out when <b>a</b> <b>car</b> <b>is</b> stalled before the lights go out. However, {{the lights went out}} before he had the chance to do so, and as a result the lights afterwards displayed the standard 5 red lights and 3 amber lights. The race was immediately stopped, but the red flag was not displayed until the cars came to the start/finish line. As is the case when a start is aborted, the race was shortened by one lap as the cars were not refuelled, but Verstappen was allowed to regain his original grid position in 15th.|$|E
5|$|It {{is illegal}} in New Jersey {{to have an}} open {{container}} of alcohol in the passenger portion of a private automobile, but open bottles of alcohol may be transported {{in the trunk of}} a car, and consumption of alcohol on a bus, train, taxi, limousine, or boat is permitted. The penalty for having an open container of alcohol in <b>a</b> <b>car</b> <b>is</b> $200 fine for the first offense, and a $250 fine or 10 days of community service for repeat violations. The state Motor Vehicle Commission does not impose license points for open container convictions, but some automobile insurance companies impose a surcharge. New Jersey's law on open containers in motor vehicles is compliant with the Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century (TEA-21), a federal act passed in 1998 which reduces the highway funding of states that do not prohibit open containers in passenger areas of automobiles.|$|E
25|$|Exocentric {{compounds}} occur {{more often}} in adjectives than nouns. <b>A</b> V-8 <b>car</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>car</b> with <b>a</b> V-8 engine rather than <b>a</b> <b>car</b> that <b>is</b> <b>a</b> V-8, and <b>a</b> twenty-five-dollar <b>car</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>car</b> with <b>a</b> worth of $25, not <b>a</b> <b>car</b> that <b>is</b> $25. The compounds shown here are bare, but more commonly, a suffixal morpheme is added, esp. -ed. Hence, a two-legged person is a person with two legs, and this is exocentric.|$|R

5|$|When Nora arrives home, Ray {{shows up}} {{demanding}} {{the name of}} the person responsible. She tells him that the man responsible is Owen Harris. Ray finds Harris, along with his family, and nearly kills him. However, he realizes that Harris was an accountant who accidentally sent the barrel to the salvage yard. Seeing that he was ultimately innocent, Ray spares him and goes off to die. Scully believes that this act represented the last of Ray’s humanity. At {{the very end of the}} episode, <b>a</b> <b>car</b> <b>is</b> dropped into a compactor at a salvage yard and crushed. As the camera fades out, Ray's eye is seen, still alive as the car is crushed.|$|E

25|$|In {{the city}} centre, driving <b>a</b> <b>car</b> <b>is</b> discouraged. Parking fees are expensive, and many streets are closed to cars or are one-way. The local {{government}} sponsors carsharing and carpooling initiatives such as Autodelen and Meerijden.nu.|$|E
25|$|The rules {{regarding}} unsafe pit releases—when <b>a</b> <b>car</b> <b>is</b> {{released from}} its pit bay to the lane {{directly into the}} path of an oncoming car—were rewritten, with the driver who was released in an unsafe fashion given a grid penalty for the next race.|$|E

25|$|From 2009, however, this {{procedure}} has been dropped, {{and replaced by}} software that calculates where <b>a</b> <b>car</b> <b>is</b> on the track and a minimum lap time it should take the car {{to get to the}} pits. Cars that enter the pits before this time limit has expired are penalised.|$|E
25|$|The cost {{of obtaining}} a licence for driving <b>a</b> <b>car</b> <b>is</b> on average €1,400 (US$1,800 in September 2014) but varies widely {{according}} to an individual's skill, city and region. Individual driving schools set their own prices. The total includes fees for: authorities and exams, learning materials, driving lessons and tuition.|$|E
5000|$|The use of <b>a</b> spare <b>car</b> <b>was</b> restricted. Each {{competing}} {{team would}} not be allowed to have more than two cars available for use at any time.

The Secret Scripture was filmed in Loreto Abbey, Rathfarnham in 2015.|$|E
25|$|The ITV 1970s TV series The Professionals filmed both {{outside and}} inside for several {{different}} episodes, {{most notably in}} one episode when <b>a</b> <b>car</b> <b>is</b> driven at speed towards the asylum main entrance followed by both main characters running down the white spiral staircase of the central tower into the basement below. At least one other episode uses a ward as a location where the three main characters visit a person supposedly in a general hospital ward.|$|E
25|$|The {{solid black}} flag {{is used to}} summon a driver to the pits. It is usually {{associated}} with a penalty imposed on the driver for disobeying the rules, but may also be used when <b>a</b> <b>car</b> <b>is</b> suffering a mechanical failure, leaking fluid, exhibiting damage such as loose bodywork, loose hood, dragging bumper, or any other damage that could potentially become a hazard to the driver or other competitors. In some cases, the black flag {{may be used to}} call a driver to the pits when their radio is not working.|$|E

5000|$|Ohio—currently {{required}} {{only in the}} Cleveland metropolitan area (Cuyahoga County, Geauga County, Lake County, Lorain County, Medina County, Portage County, and Summit County). Vehicles up to four years old are exempt. Testing {{is based on an}} odd-even year system. If <b>a</b> <b>car</b> <b>was</b> purchased in 2000, it is not required to be tested until 2010, if <b>a</b> <b>car</b> <b>was</b> purchased in 2003, then it will need to be tested in 2009. Ohio does not charge a fee for emission testing, due to Ohio's tobacco settlement.|$|R
25|$|This {{technique}} provides insights {{in other}} situations {{such as the}} Monty Hall problem, a game show scenario in which <b>a</b> <b>car</b> <b>is</b> hidden behind one of three doors, and two goats are hidden as booby prizes behind the others. Once the contestant has chosen a door, the host opens one of the remaining doors to reveal a goat, eliminating that door as an option. With only two doors left (one with the car, the other with another goat), the player must decide to either keep their decision, or switch and select the other door. Intuitively, one might think the player is choosing between two doors with equal probability, and that the opportunity to choose another door makes no difference. But probability spaces reveal that the contestant has received new information, and can increase their chances of winning by changing to the other door.|$|E
25|$|The energy {{efficiency}} {{of a system}} or device that converts energy {{is measured by the}} ratio of the amount of useful energy put out by the system ("output energy") to the total amount of energy that is put in ("input energy") or by useful output energy {{as a percentage of the}} total input energy. In the case of fuel cells, useful output energy is measured in electrical energy produced by the system. Input energy is the energy stored in the fuel. According to the U.S. Department of Energy, fuel cells are generally between 40–60% energy efficient. This is higher than some other systems for energy generation. For example, the typical internal combustion engine of <b>a</b> <b>car</b> <b>is</b> about 25% energy efficient. In combined heat and power (CHP) systems, the heat produced by the fuel cell is captured and put to use, increasing the efficiency of the system to up to 85–90%.|$|E
25|$|This {{is due in}} part to the {{reduction}} in the costs of COE and PARF between 2000 and 2005, which has incentivised owners to purchase new cars before their ten years is up. Previously, the COE and PARF represented around 80% of the cost of a medium-priced car like the Honda Accord. With the COE and PARF less expensive than in the past, in some cases the yearly drop in the COE and PARF rebate becomes significant compared to the pre-tax (OMV) price of a new car. Furthermore, with the PARF rebate starting to diminish after <b>a</b> <b>car</b> <b>is</b> five years old, the net amount of credit (similar to resale value or trade-in value) compared to the OMV becomes less favourable for owners of older cars. In contrast, in countries with low taxes, the most economical ownership strategy is to keep a car as long as possible until repair costs exceed a new car's depreciation costs or financing costs.|$|E
