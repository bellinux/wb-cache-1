5|$|One study {{published}} in 2003 suggested that curve-billed speciation was due to climate, which {{could be explained by}} molt and feather wear. The same study suggested that the Sierra Madre Occidental acts <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>barrier</b> <b>to</b> initiate differentiation within the species.|$|E
5|$|Sebaceous glands {{are part}} of the body's {{integumentary}} system and serve to protect the body against germs. Sebaceous glands secrete acids that form the acid mantle. This is a very fine, slightly acidic film {{on the surface of the}} skin that acts <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>barrier</b> <b>to</b> bacteria, viruses, and other potential contaminants that might penetrate the skin. The pH of the skin is between 4.5 and 6.2, and this acidity helps to neutralise the primarily alkaline nature of contaminants.|$|E

5|$|The nuclear envelope, {{otherwise}} known as nuclear membrane, consists of two cellular membranes, an inner and an outer membrane, arranged {{parallel to one another}} and separated by 10 to 50 nanometres (nm). The nuclear envelope completely encloses the nucleus and separates the cell's genetic material from the surrounding cytoplasm, serving <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>barrier</b> <b>to</b> prevent macromolecules from diffusing freely between the nucleoplasm and the cytoplasm. The outer nuclear membrane is continuous with the membrane of the rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER), and is similarly studded with ribosomes. The space between the membranes is called the perinuclear space and is continuous with the RER lumen.|$|E
5|$|At the time, Chongqing was {{reeling from}} {{problems}} such as air and water pollution, unemployment, poor public health, and complications from the Three Gorges Dam. According to analysts, Hu wanted to transfer his ally Wang Yang out of Chongqing before these problems intensified. Bo was initially reluctant to go to Chongqing and was reportedly unhappy with his new assignment. He had hoped to become vice-premier instead, but Premier Wen Jiabao and Vice-premier Wu Yi argued against Bo's promotion to vice-premiership. In particular, Wu was critical of Bo's penchant for self-promotion, and Wen cited international lawsuits against Bo by Falun Gong adherents <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>barrier</b> <b>to</b> his holding higher office.|$|E
5|$|The {{depiction}} of Christ in pictorial form was highly controversial {{in the early}} church. From the 5th century onward, flat painted icons became popular in the Eastern Church. The Byzantine Iconoclasm acted <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>barrier</b> <b>to</b> developments in the East, but by the ninth century, art was permitted again. The Protestant Reformation brought renewed resistance to imagery, but total prohibition was atypical, and Protestant objections to images have tended to reduce since the 16th century. Although large images are generally avoided, few Protestants now object to book illustrations depicting Jesus. The use of depictions of Jesus is advocated by the leaders of denominations such as Anglicans and Catholics and {{is a key element}} of the Eastern Orthodox tradition.|$|E

5|$|The first {{hypothesis}} {{that tried to}} explain how prions replicate in a protein-only manner was the heterodimer model. This model assumed that a single PrPSc molecule binds to a single PrPC molecule and catalyzes its conversion into PrPSc. The two PrPSc molecules then come apart and can go on to convert more PrPC. However, a model of prion replication must explain both how prions propagate, and why their spontaneous appearance is so rare. Manfred Eigen showed that the heterodimer model requires PrPSc to be an extraordinarily effective catalyst, increasing {{the rate of the}} conversion reaction by a factor of around 1015. This problem does not arise if PrPSc exists only in aggregated forms such as amyloid, where cooperativity may act <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>barrier</b> <b>to</b> spontaneous conversion. What is more, despite considerable effort, infectious monomeric PrPSc has never been isolated.|$|E
5|$|Levels {{of genetic}} {{diversity}} within individual populations of B.cuneata are unusually high {{for a rare}} and endangered species, but the populations fall into two genetically distinct groups. These are separated not by geographical distance but by the Salt River, an ephemeral saline river system that provides a habitat unsuitable for both B.cuneata and the birds that pollinate it. It thus functions <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>barrier</b> <b>to</b> the exchange of genetic material, allowing populations on different sides of the river to diverge through genetic drift. The implication for conservation is that effort should be invested {{on both sides of}} the river in order to conserve as much genetic diversity as possible. It was suggested that one large population from each population group would probably be adequate. More recently, however, a model-based risk analysis found that the population size required to reduce extinction risk to acceptable levels is more than ten times the current population size. This leads to the conclusion that all populations, and all available habitat, should be protected.|$|E
5|$|Smuggling {{was one of}} Christchurch's {{most lucrative}} {{industries}} during the 18th and 19th centuries due to easy access to neighbouring towns and the difficult harbour entrance which acted <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>barrier</b> <b>to</b> customs cutters. Many townspeople were involved in this illegal trade and large quantities of wealth were accumulated. In 1784 a confrontation between a gang of local smugglers and Customs and Excise officers led to the Battle of Mudeford in which a Royal Navy officer was killed and a smuggler subsequently executed. Another important industry during this period was the manufacture of fusee chains for watches and clocks. In 1790, Robert Cox began to manufacture fusee chains in workshops in the High Street. By 1793 Cox gained a monopoly on chain production in Britain, supplying watch, clock and chronometer makers throughout the country. In 1845 William Hart opened a similar factory in Bargates. However, by 1875 the chains were no longer required due to changes in watch designs and the factories were closed.|$|E

25|$|Today’s glass {{optical fiber}} draw {{processes}} employ a dual-layer coating approach. An inner primary coating {{is designed to}} act as a shock absorber to minimize attenuation caused by microbending. An outer secondary coating protects the primary coating against mechanical damage and acts <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>barrier</b> <b>to</b> lateral forces, and may be colored to differentiate strands in bundled cable constructions.|$|E
25|$|Cuticular {{hydrocarbons}} serve <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>barrier</b> <b>to</b> moisture diffusion {{and thus}} prevent dehydration in wasps. Cuticular hydrocarbon profiles vary over species and nests, and so cuticular hydrocarbons are a proposed mechanism for nest-mate recognition. Worker and queen cuticular lipids have similar components, but their distributions differ dramatically, implying that cuticular hydrocarbons {{also play a}} role in caste differentiation.|$|E
25|$|New Netherland was a 17th-century Dutch colony {{centered}} on present-day New York City and the Hudson River Valley; the Dutch traded furs with the Native Americans to the north.

25|$|Many private Waldorf schools {{experience}} {{a tension between}} these social goals and the way tuition fees act <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>barrier</b> <b>to</b> access to the education by less well-off families.

25|$|Wild silks {{also tend}} to be more {{difficult}} to dye than silk from the cultivated silkworm. A technique known as demineralizing allows the mineral layer around the cocoon of wild silk moths to be removed, leaving only variability in color <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>barrier</b> <b>to</b> creating a commercial silk industry based on wild silks in the parts of the world where wild silk moths thrive, such as in Africa and South America.|$|E
