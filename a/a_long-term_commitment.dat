Iran will almost never honor the interests of a company that does not show long-term commitment. Tenders are strictly required for government contracts for purchasing or projects.

500|$|Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje {{signed to}} Lost on a one-year contract, {{as he did}} not want to make <b>a</b> <b>long-term</b> <b>commitment</b> to the series. As Michelle Rodriguez signed under similar {{conditions}} that lead to her character Ana-Lucia Cortez only appearing in the show's second season, show runners Damon Lindelof and Carlton Cuse negotiated with Akinnuoye-Agbaje to make his character, Mr. Eko, to appear in the third season as well, adding some space between the two character deaths to develop Eko's closure better. As filming of season 2 ended, conversations between the actor and the writers ended setting Eko's departure during the first six episodes, prior to mid-season break, with [...] "a shocking and emotional death". To make sure the sequence was [...] "big and impressive", effects supervisor Kevin Blank decided to set the death at the Jackass Ginger in Kalihi, a large space that allowed to make the Smoke Monster [...] "flip him around in weird physical positions". A stunt double was dragged through cables, and along with the digital monster and wire removal, fast editing made the scene akin to [...] "a magician's trick", in Blank's opinion. The episode was written by Monica Owusu-Breen and Alison Schapker, who had previously worked in another series by Lost production company Bad Robot Productions, Alias.|$|E
500|$|The {{character}} of Mr. Eko {{was created to}} explore the spiritual element of the show, and to add an African character, which the producers thought would provide [...] "cultural variety" [...] to the cast.

However, after it was made clear Reddick was unavailable due to the filming schedule of The Wire, Cuse and Lindelof decided to contact Akinnuoye-Agbaje, because they were big fans of {{his work on the}} HBO prison drama Oz. At the time, Akinnuoye-Agbaje was filming Get Rich or Die Tryin' and, being unfamiliar with Lost, had no intention of joining the cast. While the producers succeeded in persuading Akinnuoye-Agbaje to take the role, {{he did not want to}} make <b>a</b> <b>long-term</b> <b>commitment</b> to the show and was therefore only hired for a short period of time. Akinnuoye-Agbaje accepted the part mostly because it was an opportunity to play a character with a different faith than his Buddhism, and because he enjoyed the idea of being on a deserted island (he had lived on a deserted island four years prior to being cast on the show). Two weeks after he was hired, Akinnuoye-Agbaje moved to Oahu, Hawaii, where filming took place.|$|E

500|$|Larger {{cockatoos}} {{can live}} 30 to 70 years {{depending on the}} species, or occasionally longer, and cockatiels can live for about 20 years. As pets they require <b>a</b> <b>long-term</b> <b>commitment</b> from their owners. Their longevity is considered a positive trait as it reduces instances {{of the loss of}} a pet. The oldest cockatoo in captivity was a Major Mitchell's cockatoo named [...] "Cookie", residing at Brookfield Zoo in Chicago, which lived to be 83 years old (1933-2016). A salmon-crested cockatoo named 'King Tut' who resided at San Diego Zoo was nearly 69 when he died in 1990 and a palm cockatoo reached 56 in London Zoo in 2000. However, anecdotal reports describe birds of much greater ages. 'Cocky Bennett' of Tom Ugly's Point in Sydney was a celebrated sulphur-crested cockatoo who was reported to have reached an age of 100 years or more. He had lost his feathers and was naked for much of his life. A palm cockatoo was reported to have reached 80 or 90 years of age in an Australian zoo, and a little corella that was removed from a nest in central Australia in 1904 was reported still alive in the late 1970s. In February 2010, a white cockatoo named 'Arthur' was claimed to be 90 years old; he had lived with a family for generations in Dalaguete, Cebu, before being taken to Cebu City Zoo.|$|E
