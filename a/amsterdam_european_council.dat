40|$|Measuring the European Parliament’s {{concrete}} impact at {{this stage}} encounters two main problems: first, the European Parliament’s own position with regard to its definitive requirements, its bottom line, {{is not easy to}} describe. Its resolutions to this end are numerous and [...] quite normally [...] evolving throughout a large period accompanying preparation in the Reflection Group and the actual work in the Intergovernmental Conference (IGC). Still, one can distill a certain number of priorities: with regard to social policy issues they are the establishment of an area of freedom, security and justice, an enhanced Union citizenship with an extended non-discrimination clause, fundamental rights protection, general equality, an employment title, the inclusion and improvement of the social protocol including measures against social exclusion, improved protection of the environment, and the objective of sustainable development. With regard to institutional issues, the priorities are threefold: first, efficiency, especially in view of future enlargements and mainly concerning qualified majority voting in Council; second, transparency and openness, concerning the reduction of decision-making procedures to three (assent, co-decision and consultation), the simplification and codification of the Treaties, openness of the Council in its legislative capacity and public access to documents; and third, democracy, meaning Parliament’s own role. Second, {{it is virtually impossible to}} describe the results of the IGC a few weeks before its possible conclusion in the <b>Amsterdam</b> <b>European</b> <b>Council</b> on 16 / 17 June 1997.

40|$|In 2009 the European Union {{introduced}} the Lisbon Treaty. One {{of the changes}} this brought about was {{the introduction of a}} permanent president of the <b>European</b> <b>Council.</b> With this transformation the former EU presidency no longer exists and this thesis investigates the implications of this change. This is done by specifically looking at the national interests discussed in the <b>European</b> <b>Council.</b> Before the Lisbon Treaty Member States were able to influence the <b>European</b> <b>Council</b> by pushing their national interests, but based on the new institutional settings of the permanent presidency, this seemed after Lisbon more unlikely. An analysis of nine rotating presidencies of the <b>Council</b> of the <b>European</b> Union after Lisbon has been made and compared to the respective <b>European</b> <b>Council</b> conclusions of that period. The results show that in fact national interests have been discussed in the <b>European</b> <b>Council.</b> Nevertheless, only a third of all national interests has been discussed. On the other hand, the analyses also reveal that on average the discussed national interests in the <b>European</b> <b>Council</b> have significant similarity with the national interests of the Member States. Furthermore, the analysis brought also forward that certain national interests that seem not significant for the <b>European</b> <b>Council</b> have been discussed in the <b>European</b> <b>Council,</b> which could indicate that Member States can still push their national interests. In conclusion, national interests were discussed only to a low extent in the <b>European</b> <b>Council,</b> answering the research question of this thesis: to what extent are national interests of Member States presiding over the <b>Council</b> of the <b>European</b> Union discussed during <b>European</b> <b>Council</b> meetings...|$|R
40|$|The <b>European</b> <b>Council,</b> {{the meeting}} of the Heads of State and Government of the member states of the European Union, has evolved into EU's most {{influential}} and powerful decision-making institution. However, the process of deepening (expansion of policy areas) and widening (enlargement) of European integration have forced the <b>European</b> <b>Council</b> to tackle the potential threat of a crisis in European top-level decision making before actual enlargement with ten new members in May 2004. If the current generation of political leaders is not able to reach agreement on necessary reforms, future decision-making in the <b>European</b> <b>Council</b> could eventually {{turn out to be a}} mission impossible. Despite a successful record, the <b>European</b> <b>Council</b> seemed to have lost its grip on the integration process, still based on an unchanged negotiation structure since its creation in the 1970 's, are needed if the <b>European</b> <b>Council</b> wants to continue its important and guiding role in European integration. Two parallel processes of <b>European</b> <b>Council</b> reform have been initiated or intensified and are to be finalized before actual enlargement next year. The first process deals with the operational settings of the <b>European</b> <b>Council</b> summits. The second process deals with the institutional structure and the balance of power between the EU institutions. The main purpose of this paper is twofold. The first is to present information on the evolution and current functioning of the <b>European</b> <b>Council</b> since the summits are still surrounded by a lot of secrecy and informal decision-making. Secondly, an overview and analysis will be presented on these current reform processes that need to prepare the <b>European</b> <b>Council</b> for the upcoming enlargement.

In this article, we argue that an analysis of agenda formation dynamics in the <b>European</b> <b>Council</b> may help us understand better how the <b>European</b> <b>Council</b> works and how its role has evolved over time. Building on theories of agenda-setting, we identify two ideal-typical modes of agenda formation: selective targeting and routine monitoring. Based on a comprehensive dataset of coded <b>European</b> <b>Council</b> Conclusions in the period 1975 - 2011, we show that the substantive content of the <b>European</b> <b>Council</b> agenda shows little change over time.

40|$|Introduction: High on {{the agenda}} of the <b>European</b> <b>Council</b> as the key {{institution}} within the EU’s architecture are issues of economic governance. The various policies that form part of economic governance – monetary, fiscal, and other economic and social policies – are usually regarded as the most important or at least the most often discussed areas of the <b>European</b> <b>Council’s</b> policy-making (see for example Van Rompuy 2010). Following their problem-solving instinct, since the 1970 s, the Union’s political leaders have regularly and extensively used the <b>European</b> <b>Council</b> to cope with economic challenges that the European states were faced with. The performance and profile of the <b>European</b> <b>Council</b> in this area is difficult to capture. The term ’economic governance’, used by the <b>European</b> <b>Council</b> itself (for example March 2011), is only useful for a first general orientation as this policy field is characterised by a confusing array of institutions, processes, mechanisms and instruments (Begg 2011 : 337 - 339). To consider the <b>European</b> <b>Council’s</b> performance in the economic realm, this paper takes {{a closer look at the}} institution’s activities as constitutional architect, at its leadership-role as crisis manager and at its institutional position in the centre of the multi-pillar architecture...|$|R
