25|$|For lay Buddhists, marital {{fidelity}} {{is traditionally}} {{considered to be}} part of Right <b>Action,</b> <b>part</b> of the Eightfold Path. Specifically, it is considered part of the avoidance of sexual misconduct (kamesu miccha-cara veramani in Pali), which defines who is an illicit or inappropriate sexual partner for a man or a woman, depending on their marital status, age, etc. Different Buddhist-influenced cultures have interpreted the specifics of this prohibition differently with respect to practices like multiple marriage and concubinage; in 2015, for example, a Japanese court ruled that paying for prostitution did not constitute adultery, though traditional rules of sexual misconduct forbid a man from having sex with a woman who might be obliged to him for financial reasons.|$|E
25|$|In the Spanish Netherlands Luxembourg {{still had}} 100,000 men; {{but he was}} outnumbered. Lacking {{sufficient}} supplies to mount an attack Luxembourg was unable to prevent the Allies garrisoning Dixmude and, on 27 September 1694, recapturing Huy, an essential preliminary to future operations against Namur. Elsewhere, de Lorge marched and manoeuvred against Baden on the Rhine with undramatic results before the campaign petered out in October; while in Italy, the continuing problems with French finance and a complete breakdown in the supply chain prevented Catinat's push into Piedmont. However, in Catalonia the fighting proved more eventful. On 27 May Marshal Noailles, supported by French warships, soundly defeated the Marquis of Escalona's Spanish forces at the Battle of Torroella {{on the banks of}} the river Ter; the French proceeded to take Palamós on 10 June, Gerona on 29 June, and Hostalric, opening the route to Barcelona. With the Spanish King threatening to make a separate peace with France unless the Allies came to his assistance William III prepared the Anglo-Dutch fleet for <b>action.</b> <b>Part</b> of the fleet under Admiral Berkeley would remain in the north, first leading the disastrous amphibious assault on Brest on 18 June, before bombarding French coastal defences at Dieppe, Saint-Malo, Le Havre, and Calais. The remainder of the fleet under Admiral Russell was ordered to the Mediterranean, linking up with Spanish vessels off Cadiz. The Allied naval presence compelled the French fleet back to the safety of Toulon, which, in turn, forced Noailles to withdraw to the line of the Ter, harassed en route by General Trinxería's miquelets. By shielding Barcelona in this way the Allies kept Spain in the war for two more years.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Expressions are facial {{activities}} invoked by sets {{of muscle}} motions, {{which would give}} rise to large variations in appearance mainly around facial parts. Therefore, for visual-based expression analysis, local-izing the <b>action</b> <b>parts</b> and encoding them effectively become two essential but challenging problems. To take them into account jointly for expres-sion analysis, in this paper, we propose to adapt 3 D Convolutional Neural Networks (3 D CNN) with deformable <b>action</b> <b>parts</b> constraints. Specifi-cally, we incorporate a deformable parts learning component into the 3 D CNN framework, which can detect specific facial <b>action</b> <b>parts</b> under the structured spatial constraints, and obtain the discriminative part-based representation simultaneously. The proposed method is evaluated on two posed expression datasets, CK+, MMI, and a spontaneous dataset FERA. We show that, besides achieving state-of-the-art expression recog-nition accuracy, our method also enjoys the intuitive appeal that the part detection map can desirably encode the mid-level semantics of different facial <b>action</b> <b>parts.</b> ...|$|R

5000|$|Gas {{operation}} {{is a system}} of operation used to provide energy to semi-automatic and fully automatic firearms. In gas-operation, a portion of high pressure gas from the cartridge being fired is tapped {{through a hole in}} the barrel and diverted to operate the action. There are three basic types: long stroke gas piston (where the gas piston goes the same distance as the operating stroke of the <b>action</b> <b>parts,</b> and is often attached to the <b>action</b> <b>parts),</b> short stroke gas piston (where the gas piston travels a shorter distance than the operating stroke of the <b>action</b> <b>parts),</b> and direct impingement (AKA [...] "direct gas", [...] "gas impingement", where there is no piston, and the gas acts directly on the <b>action</b> <b>parts).</b> A fourth type, now considered obsolete and ineffective, are those systems based on the Bang rifle that utilize a muzzle cap to capture gas after the bullet has left the barrel. While this system is successful in boosting the operating power of recoil operated guns, it is insufficient and too susceptible to fouling for use as the primary operating system.|$|R

The addition of carbon fiber also increased the stiffness of ABS-Carbon <b>action</b> <b>parts,</b> allowing the <b>action</b> to produce more power for the player with less effort.

Kissinger had been running the CIA since the beginning of Nixon's presidency, but Nixon impressed on Schlesinger that he must appear to congress to be in charge, averting their suspicion of Kissinger's involvement.

Before Helms would leave office, he would destroy every tape he had secretly made of meetings in his office, and many of the papers on Project MKUltra. In Schlesinger's 17-week tenure, he would fire more than 1,500 employees. As Watergate threw the spotlight on the CIA, Schlesinger, who had been kept in the dark about the CIA's involvement, decided he needed to know what skeletons were in the closet. He issued a memo to every CIA employee directing them to disclose to him any CIA activity they knew of past or present that could fall outside the scope of the CIA's charter.|$|E

And for each of the body parts, we define several semantic body <b>part</b> <b>actions,</b> e. g., hand holding, hand waving.
