[...] He added: [...] "There's a danger of being seduced into being self-conscious, of being <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> 'career'. That can be lethal." [...] He also grew more concerned of the [...] "threatening" [...] corporate influence into the film industry at the expense of [...] "the idea of the creative spirit". He channeled this ambivalence into Broadcast News. As a romantic comedy, Brooks felt he could say [...] "something new ... with that form" [...] adding [...] "One of the things you're supposed to do {{every once in a while}} as a filmmaker is capture time and place. I was just glad there was some way to do it in a comedy." [...] He cast William Hurt, Holly Hunter and Albert Brooks in the three main roles.|$|E

After months of treatment, Incognito described his experience and growth as [...] "very difficult" [...] because [...] "There's no doubt things were said and things were texted and things were done where I clearly crossed the line...That's part of the learning process I went through, and just growing up and maturing and being <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> surroundings and who your audience is." ...|$|E

2500|$|Goodrem's third studio album, the eponymous Delta, was {{released}} in Australia on 20 October 2007. Goodrem described the material as [...] "...a lot lighter" [...] compared to her previous album Mistaken Identity. She has also stated, [...] "As people become more <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> life, they can pinpoint what songs are about. On this album, I've tried to remove {{a lot of that}} and just write great pop songs, songs that are from my heart but there's no baggage with them". The album debuted at number one on the ARIA Albums Chart, making it her third number one album in her home country. and received platinum certification for shipments of 70,000 records, though sales were much lower; only 23,000 copies were sold during the first week. In December the album was certified 2x platinum. It eventually was certified 3x platinum in 2008. In New Zealand, the album debuted at number twelve on the RIANZ Albums Chart.|$|E

40|$|Being a {{committee}} member is about {{much more than}} simply attending meetings, although {{that is one of}} {{a committee}} member’s tasks! You should see it as an active not a passive role.

Details of the membership and terms of reference of all committees are set out in the School's Standing Orders which can be found at...|$|R
40|$|Being a {{committee}} Chair {{is a very}} important role. It will be an interesting activity and at times will be challenging. Your role is to ensure that the business which comes to your committee is dealt with appropriately, so enabling the business to be completed, or, if necessary, to move on through the committee structure. It is essential that you are familiar with <b>your</b> committee’s Terms <b>of</b> Reference so that you are <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> what <b>your</b> committee is authorised to do. You also need to be <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> the reporting lines <b>of</b> <b>your</b> committee and where it fits in the committee structure. The School Calendar contains a diagram showing the committee structure within the School. This will show you whether any committees report to your committee, and to which committee(s) your committee needs to report. All committees are ultimately responsible to Governing Body. You will need to work very closely with your committee Secretary. Notes have been prepared about the roles of committee Secretary and of committee member and you may find it useful to read these: Role of a Committee Member...|$|R

50|$|There are {{a number}} of factors that you need to be <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> before {{choosing}} <b>your</b> account, for example, some accounts offer interest that it adds onto your balance monthly, which then accumulates more interest throughout the year based on the total balance. Other accounts pay the interest owed when the term ends, or pay the interest into a separate savings account on a monthly basis, so you will only be paid interest on the opening balance.|$|R
40|$|Paying {{attention}} to competitor {{is as important}} as caring your customers. By giving full attention ONLY to customers and not <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> what <b>your</b> competitors doing will create a very fragile condition. Since, as we know, what we called satisfaction, expectation, and customer value is very relative to competitors offering. Their values are not absolute. There are many companies who have lack information about their competitor. Many do not even know, whether they have competitor or not. It is because they are the only one of their kind or because they are market nicher. According to Levitt, these enterprises are suffering what he called marketing myopia. Actually (in the real situation) they do have competitor in the greater context. Even though their products are not similar, however they do serve similar need...|$|R
40|$|The NODUPRECS (or NODUP) and NODUPKEY options can {{be useful}} with the SORT {{procedure}} {{but they can be}} dangerous if you do not understand them completely. They work similarly in that they both can eliminate unwanted observations, but NODUPRECS compares all the variables in your data set while NODUPKEY compares just the BY variables. Also, you must be <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> how <b>your</b> data set is currently sorted to eliminate the observations that you want because these options compare adjacent observations. In this paper, I will describe this in greater detail and show examples of how to use the NODUPRECS and NODUPKEY options. All examples shown were done in the SAS ® system for PCs, version 8. 2. The intended audience for this paper is beginner level SAS programmers...|$|R

6000|$|Seeing my surprise, he went on, [...] "I {{drove down}} in a gig that {{afternoon}} to look after that boy. You might have heard my wheels when you came out to look after him yourself, for I was <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> you and <b>your</b> little maid going up when I was walking the horse down. Making an inquiry or two {{about him in the}} town, I soon heard what company he was in and was coming among the brick-fields to look for him when I observed you bringing him home here." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{suppose you}} would call me a poacher," [...] {{answered}} the man; and his voice {{was something of a}} surprise coming from such a scarecrow; it had that hard fastidiousness to be found in those who have made a fight for their own refinement among rough surroundings. [...] "I consider I have a perfect right to shoot game in this place. But I am well <b>aware</b> that people <b>of</b> <b>your</b> sort take me for a thief, and I suppose you will try to land me in jail." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Then you, too, {{have known}} the secret, and have said nothing about it? You, too, have been <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> the {{violence}} which took place at that midnight meeting?

Oh, Florence, you also will find yourself {{in the hands of}} the policeman!"

5000|$|ASMR {{triggers}} typically {{originate from}} human behaviors. Triggering behaviors are reportedly consistent with behaviors arising from {{individuals who are}} fully present in a given moment, as described in Buddhist texts. For example, in the book Cutting Through Spiritual Materialism, Tibetan Buddhist Chogyam Trungpa's description of a fully present person performing a Japanese tea ceremony is consistent with descriptions of visual ASMR triggers: [...] "If you pour a cup of tea, you are <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> extending <b>your</b> arm and touching your hand to a teapot, lifting it and pouring the water. Finally the water touches your teacup and fills it, and you stop pouring and put the teapot down precisely...each precise movement has dignity." [...] In the same text, a description of how a fully present person speaks is consistent with descriptions of verbal ASMR triggers: [...] "Every pause made {{in the process of}} speaking becomes a kind of punctuation. Speak, allow space, speak, allow space. It is beautiful that you are not rushing, that you are not talking at tremendous speed, raucously." ...|$|R
