5|$|Having found {{success in}} both {{domestic}} and European cup competitions, Revie took the decision to focus exclusively on the league for the 1968–69 campaign. They went {{the rest of the}} season unbeaten in the league following a 5–1 defeat to Burnley at Turf Moor on 19 October, and secured the title with a 0–0 draw with challengers Liverpool at Anfield; after the game Revie led his team back out onto the pitch to <b>applaud</b> <b>the</b> Liverpool supporters, who in turn applauded the Leeds team. His team set a number of records: most points (67), most wins (27), fewest defeats (2), and most home points (39); a still-unbroken club record is their 34 match unbeaten run that extended into the following season.|$|E

We recognize and <b>applaud</b> <b>the</b> thoughtful and painstaking efforts, over many years, of Judge Neil P. McCurn, who presided over this and related land claims in upstate New York with fairness and due regard to the rights and interests of all parties as well as with a keen appreciation of the complexities of the subject matter and of the relevant law. Our decision is based on a subsequent ruling by the Supreme Court, which could not be anticipated by Judge McCurn in his handling of this case over more than twenty years.|$|E

500|$|Acknowledging the show's critics, Scott Miller {{wrote in}} 2001 that [...] "some people can't see past the {{appearance}} of chaos and randomness to the brilliant construction and sophisticated imagery underneath." [...] Miller notes, [...] "Not only did many of the lyrics not rhyme, {{but many of the}} songs didn't really have endings, just a slowing down and stopping, so the audience didn't know when to <b>applaud....</b> <b>The</b> show rejected every convention of Broadway, of traditional theatre in general, and of the American musical in specific.

Maureen Ryan of the Chicago Tribune agreed, but also noted that [...] "you don't {{need to be a}} longtime fan of the long-running program to enjoy its jibes at sci-fi clichés or expedient writing." [...] Eclipse Magazine noted that although the episode was [...] "not a work of comic genius", [...] "200" [...] was the best comedy episode of the series.|$|E

500|$|Behind {{the goal}} {{at the north}} end of Goodison Park, the Gwladys Street Stand is divided into Upper Gwladys and Lower Gwladys. This stand is the [...] "Popular End", holding the most boisterous and vociferous home supporters. It is known colloquially as [...] "The Street End". If Everton win the toss before {{kick-off}} the captain traditionally elects to play towards the Gwladys Street End in the second half. One of the traditions of the stand is also to <b>applaud</b> <b>the</b> visiting goalkeeper as he runs out to the goal of the stand. The stand has a capacity of 10,611 and gives its name to Gwladys Street's Hall of Fame. On the 12th July 2016 it was announced that the Gwladys Street End would be renamed the Howard Kendall Gwladys Street End, in honour of Everton's most successful manager, Howard Kendall.|$|E
500|$|Matejko's {{technique}} {{in this painting}} was subtly but noticeably different compared to his other paintings; authors Wrede et al. attribute this to Matejko's exploration of new techniques, but note that contemporary critiques saw this departure from his old style as the weakening form of the dying master, and did not <b>applaud</b> <b>the</b> changes. They also note that Matejko usually dedicated two years to paintings of that size; this one was completed {{in less than a}} year, during a period in which Matejko was working on other projects and suffering from stress and depression. Matejko himself was not fond of the 18th century and the Polish Enlightenment, remarking that he [...] "would rather prefer to paint any other century". He felt compelled, however, by the anniversary of the Constitution to create an artwork commemorating the event, which he recognized as historically significant.|$|E
500|$|The {{ruling was}} praised by {{the video game}} industry, which had {{expected}} the law to be ruled unconstitutional, but sought affirmation by the Court. ESA's CEO, Michael Gallagher, responded that [...] "The Court declared forcefully that content-based restrictions on games are unconstitutional; and that parents, not government bureaucrats, {{have the right to}} decide what is appropriate for their children." [...] Bo Anderson of the EMA stated that [...] "there now can be no argument whether video games are entitled to the same protection as books, movies, music, and other expressive entertainment," [...] while Electronic Arts' (former) CEO John Riccitiello asserted that the decision [...] "affirmed the constitutional rights of game developers." [...] Other entertainment industries, such as the Motion Picture Association of America, also showed support for the Court's decision. [...] Former U.S. Senator and current head of the Association Chris Dodd recognized that the motion picture industry has seen similar attempts to limit its freedom of expression, and that [...] "We <b>applaud</b> <b>the</b> Supreme Court for recognizing the far-reaching First-Amendment implications posed by the California law." ...|$|E

500|$|Relations {{between the}} Olympians and the Australian Government {{remained}} tense {{after months of}} political struggle regarding the boycott. The quartet did not receive the customary congratulations from Fraser, who initially resisted complaints the next day from the media and government members at his failure to <b>applaud</b> <b>the</b> Australian victory. In a radio interview, he said [...] "I hope that circumstances do not arise {{over the next few}} years which will cause them to have very great regrets about the fact that they've gone". Fraser relented and late in the night, his office sent a telegram indirectly, through the Australian Embassy in Moscow. Fraser had ordered the Australian diplomatic mission to shun the Olympians, so the embassy staff had to pass the envelopes containing the message through the Olympic Village fence. Fraser's telegram said: [...] "You know I did not and do not approve of Australia being represented at these Olympic Games. I do want to say however that your performance in the relay was a truly great sporting achievement. My personal congratulations." [...] The swimmers tore up the message.|$|E
500|$|When the {{two teams}} played {{for the first time}} at Yankee Stadium, on April 3, Yankee fans started new taunts, saying [...] "The Curse of 1918 is finally over (86 years). Let the new curse 2090 begin." [...] They also {{projected}} the next Red Sox championship with signs saying [...] "1918-2004-2090." [...] Just a week later, the Red Sox received their World Series rings at Fenway Park before they played the Yankees. All of the Yankees went to the top step of the dugout to <b>applaud</b> <b>the</b> Red Sox accomplishment. During the announcement of the lineups, Red Sox fans reciprocated by giving Yankee closer Mariano Rivera (who had struggled against the Red Sox) a loud, standing ovation, despite their booing of Alex Rodriguez. Rivera laughed and tipped his cap. In New York, the YES Network, the Yankees television network, declined to broadcast it. Instead, a fixed camera shot was focused tightly on correspondent Kimberly Jones as she described in general terms the events surrounding her; afterwards, YES was roundly criticized for the move. The Red Sox won the game 8–1.|$|E
500|$|According to The Globe and Mail John Barber, Martin manages {{simultaneously}} to master and transcend the genre so that [...] "Critics <b>applaud</b> <b>the</b> {{depth of his}} characterizations and lack of cliché in books that are nonetheless replete with dwarves and dragons". Publishers Weekly gave favorable reviews to the first three Ice and Fire novels at their points of release, saying that A Game of Thrones had [...] "superbly developed characters, accomplished prose and sheer bloody-mindedness", that A Clash of Kings was [...] "notable particularly for the lived-in quality of [...] for the comparatively modest role of magic", and that A Storm of Swords was one [...] "of the more rewarding examples of gigantism in contemporary fantasy". However, they found that A Feast For Crows as the fourth installment [...] "sorely misses its other half. The slim pickings here are tasty, but in no way satisfying." [...] Their review for A Dance with Dragons repeated points of criticism for the fourth volume, and said that, although [...] "The new volume has a similar feel to Feast", [...] "Martin keeps it fresh by focusing on popular characters [...] notably absent from the previous book." ...|$|E

500|$|Many reviewers {{perceived}} an anti-American {{message in}} the film, equating RDA's private security force to American soldiers. Commentator Glenn Beck on his radio show said that Avatar was [...] "an anti‑U.S. human thing". Russell D. Moore in The Christian Post stated that, [...] "If {{you can get a}} theater full of people in Kentucky to stand and <b>applaud</b> <b>the</b> defeat of their country in war, then you've got some amazing special effects" [...] and criticized Cameron for what he saw as an unnuanced depiction of the American military as [...] "pure evil". John Podhoretz of The Weekly Standard argued that Avatar revealed [...] "hatred of the military and American institutions and the notion that to be human is just way uncool." [...] One review called Avatar the [...] "liberal tell" [...] of [...] "a thinly disguised, heavy-handed and simplistic sci-fi fantasy/allegory critical of America from our founding straight through to the Iraq War." [...] Charles Mudede of The Stranger commented that with the release of the film [...] "the American culture industry exports an anti-American spectacle to an anti-American world." [...] Debbie Schlussel likewise dismissed [...] Avatar as [...] "cinema for the hate America crowd".|$|E
500|$|Not all reviews were positive. Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, {{in their}} book Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, rated the episode two stars out of five and wrote that the installment's return to the black oil mythos seemed [...] "out of date". They also wrote that Mulder and Doggett are [...] "good at running away, which doesn't give either of them much dignity." [...] Paula Vitaris from Cinefantastique gave the episode a {{negative}} review and awarded it one-and-a-half stars out of four. She wrote, [...] "as action-adventure, 'Veinen' is so-so. Except for the big 'money shot' explosion at the end, it doesn't exploit the possibilities of the physical location." [...] Meghan Deans of Tor.com ultimately concluded that [...] "while 'Vienen' works hard to hit its marks—a classic villain, a battle of dudes—it can’t measure up to all that’s come before it." [...] She surmised that [...] "the transfer [...] is functional, but the transfer is hollow." [...] She did, however, <b>applaud</b> <b>the</b> return of the black oil, noting that she was [...] "happy to have it back." ...|$|E
500|$|Shortly {{after midnight}} on September 12, 2001, Philippines local time (approximately four {{hours after the}} September 11, 2001 attacks in the U.S.), Fischer was interviewed live by Pablo Mercado on the Baguio City station of the Bombo Radyo network. Fischer stated that he was happy that the {{airliner}} attacks had happened, while expressing his view on U.S. and Israeli foreign policy, saying [...] "I <b>applaud</b> <b>the</b> act. Look, nobody gets... that the U.S. and Israel have been slaughtering the Palestinians... for years." [...] He also said [...] "The horrible behavior that the U.S. is committing all over the world... This just shows you, that what goes around, comes around even for the United States." [...] Fischer also referenced the movie Seven Days in May and said he hoped for a military coup d'état in the U.S., [...] " [...] {{the country will be}} taken over by the military, they'll close down all the synagogues, arrest all the Jews, execute hundreds of thousands of Jewish ringleaders." [...] In response to Fischer's statements about 9/11, the U.S. Chess Federation passed a motion to cancel his right to membership in the organization. Fischer's right to become a member was reinstated in 2007.|$|E
