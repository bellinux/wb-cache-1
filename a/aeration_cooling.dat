40|$|ABSTRACT. Aeration is an {{inexpensive}} {{way to improve}} grain storage conditions, {{but it can be}} difficult to implement immediately after harvest in much of the hard red winter (HRW) wheat belt due to high ambient temperatures. High nighttime relative humidity worsens this problem because the heat of condensation released during adsorption reduces <b>aeration</b> <b>cooling,</b> but the magnitude of this humidity effect is not well documented. A procedure was developed to calculate effective temperature (Teff), which coupled dry-bulb temperature (Tdb), wet-bulb temperature (Twb), and grain moisture content to predict the actual final grain temperature after aeration. Hourly historical weather data were used to determine the available aeration hours belo...|$|E

40|$|Since its beginning, {{research}} into the protection of stored grain in Australia {{has been driven by}} market access, in particular, the need to provide insect free grain to overseas customers Research began in 1917 when a bumper harvest coincided with disruption of shipping due the First World War and resulted in the unprecedented accumulation of wheat stocks, which were subject to catastrophic attack by ‘weevil plagues’. Initial experiments were of insect life cycles and reproductive rate. This was followed by trials of heat and mechanical disinfestation and fumigation, and preventative methods such as admixture or surface treatment with lime, sand or mineral dusts, and hermetic storage. These technologies continued to be developed into the 1950 s along with <b>aeration</b> <b>cooling.</b> In addition, ground-breaking research on mathematical descriptions of grain beetle life tables was published. The admixture of malathion to bulk grain in the 1960 s allowed, for the first time, the export of insect-free grain. However, in less than ten years, resistance in target pests had become so serious that alternatives were desperately required. In response, research began on the development of new grain protectants and alternatives such as controlled atmospheres, manipulation of grain temperature, new ways of using phosphine and the development of new fumigants...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT. Field {{trials were}} {{conducted}} in metal wheat storage bins to determine whether pressure aeration, pushing ambient air from the bottom, or suction aeration, pulling air down from the top, would be more efficient at cooling the wheat mass and thereby limiting insect population growth. Aeration was accomplished at an approximate airflow rate of 0. 22 to 0. 31 m 3 /min/t and was done by adjusting thermostatic controllers to operate the aeration fans when ambient temperatures fell below specified thresholds. Summer and autumn cooling cycles using suction <b>aeration</b> <b>cooled</b> the warmest part of the bin, {{the top of the}} grain mass first, which resulted in lower overall wheat mass temperatures compared to pressure aeration, where the top of the grain mass always remained warmer than with suction <b>aeration.</b> This <b>cooling</b> effect was most pronounced in the upper surface of the grain mass, and insect pest populations as measured by pitfall traps were consistently less in bins with suction versus pressure aeration.

40|$|Abstract]Grain harvest {{represents}} {{a period of}} high risk and is also a bottleneck in a grain production. This study develops a climate-based systems simulation model to investigate the economics of high moisture grain harvesting in Australia. The optimum harvesting and drying strategies were determined. The role of grain <b>aeration</b> <b>cooling</b> was also examined. The model software was developed in MATLAB. This model was run on an hourly basis using 15 years of historical weather data (1991 - 2005) for three main wheat production areas in Australia, represented by Goondiwindi (QLD), Tamworth (NSW) and Scaddan (WA). The Wheat Harvest System Simulation Model (WHSSM) consists of four submodels of weather data, machinery performance, crop loss and economic calculations. Each submodel is represented by mathematical functions and supported by available theoretical and field data. The weather submodel is used to predict dynamic grain moisture contents for a standing crop in the field. Machinery submodel was developed to calculate machinery performance and its operating costs at different grain and weather conditions. The main machinery involved are combine harvester, cooling aerator, and four categories of grain driers. Crop loss submodel is used to quantify grain losses involved during harvest and storage periods, including shedding (yield) losses, header losses, threshing losses, crop quality downgrading losses (due to rainfalls), and storage spoilage losses. The model {{has been used to}} predict and compare the possible return for different harvesting and postharvest management strategies.

40|$|Chilling {{aeration}} of stored grain {{is becoming}} very popular {{around the world}} since it offers many advantages in situations where ambient air conditions are not adequate to cool grain. It allows to cool grain, independent of ambient conditions, to “safe” temperatures where insect, fungi, and spoilage development is reduced to the minimum, {{and at the same}} time can potentially reduce chemical control use. The objective of this research was to evaluate the effectiveness of chilling aeration to preserve grain quality and control insect-pests. The research trial was developed from August to November 2015 in Central Kansas in two 1, 270 metric tons (MT) steel bins with low-moisture wheat from the 2015 summer harvest. One bin was chilled and the other was used as a control (ambient aeration). Variables evaluated were: moisture content (MC), grain and flour quality, insect-pest development and reproduction rate, insect fragments per kg, and fungi presence. Chilling <b>aeration</b> <b>cooled</b> the grain in 135 hours to an average of 17 ⁰C, with minimum variation through the four months. Ambient aeration in the control bin cooled the grain to an average of 22 ⁰C after 308 hours, with variation over 16 ⁰C through the four months. Lower temperatures significantly diminished insect development and reproduction rate. Flour quality was better preserved in the chilled than in the control bin. There was no significant effect on MC, grain quality or fungi presence. The energy cost of running the grain chiller was 0. 22 $/MT more than the cost of ambient aeration in the control bin...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT. Grain in the U. S. Northwest is {{typically}} both over-dry and too warm for safe storage after harvest. Laboratory and computer studies {{were used to}} examine <b>aeration</b> with <b>cool</b> and high humidity air to alleviate both deficiencies, while maintaining grain quality with safe storage conditions. A wide range of high humidity aeration conditions was produced in the laboratory to study the effect of moisture condensation on the grain and moisture adsorption during and after cooling the grain. Computer simulations were used to evaluate long-term temperature and moisture changes from aeration. Results demonstrated the possibility of maintaining optimum grain temperature and moisture content when these processes are correctly managed. The tests showed that moisture accumulation (by adsorption), but not moisture condensation, needs to be monitored for safe aeration management.

40|$|ABSTRACT. A two-year {{study was}} {{conducted}} to determine acceptable aeration strategies for farmer stock peanuts stored in conventional warehouses with and without headspace ventilation. Farmer stock peanuts were stored in 1 / 10 th scale model warehouses with various aeration and ventilation treatments. Peanuts were loaded into each warehouse in the fall and stored for about 190 days. Peanuts stored with <b>aeration</b> generally <b>cooled</b> faster than those stored without aeration. Aflatoxin was detected in the initial samples from the 2002 crop, but aeration significantly reduced the further production of aflatoxin in storage. Aflatoxin contamination was not a factor in the 2003 storage season. Value change based on kernel size distribution was not significantly affected by aeration. An aeration rate of 0. 31 m 3 min− 1 t− 1 was sufficient for proper aeration when used without headspace ventilation. The reduced aeration rate of 0. 10 m 3 min− 1 t− 1 in conjunction with headspace ventilation cooled the center of the peanut mass sufficiently {{to reduce the risk of}} aflatoxin production in storage.

40|$|The {{so-called}} 2 ̆ 2 lime-induced 2 ̆ 2 chlorosis {{has been}} recognized for many years as a problem where plants are grown on calcareous soils. The characteristics associated with lime-induced chlorosis {{are the same as}} those associated with iron deficiency chlorosis [...] interveinal yellowing of the leaves at the meristemic region combined with reduced vigor of the plant as a whole. Lime-induced chlorosis is unique in that the iron content of both chlorotic plant and the soil do not always show a deficiency in iron when chemically analyzed. This leads to the theory that iron is inactivated in both the soil and plant. Although no single factor has been found to adequately explain this physiological disease, many factors have been associated with it. Thorne, Wann, and Robinson (1950) observed that calcareous soils characterized by fine texture, high moisture content, poor <b>aeration,</b> and <b>cool</b> temperatures intensify the development of chlorosis in plants.

Especially in the 1990 s, modern grain storage depots were constructed, in which four new technologies of grain inspection automation, machinery <b>aeration,</b> grain <b>cooling,</b> and phosphine recirculating fumigation were popularized. The main technologies to phase out methyl bromide in national depots are under-film phosphine recirculation fumigation and mixing fumigation of phosphine and carbon dioxide. In grain storage scientific research, research programs from applied to molecular fields have been implemented in institutes and universities. The 4 th national survey of stored grain insects showed 270 species including 44 natural enemies were recorded. Among these stored grain insect pests the psocid, Liposcelis bostrychophila is generally more prevalent in stored grain with high moisture content. Hence, bionomics, ecologies, control measures, and molecular biology have being conducted since 1990 s, and many achievements have been obtained. Efficacy of new grain protectants such as diatomaceous earth and spinosad against the main stored grain insects were evaluated. Researches on effective concentration of phosphine, application technique, recirculation fumigation, combination phosphine with carbon dioxide, and phosphine resistance mechanism were executed.

40|$|ABSTRACT. Equilibrium {{simulation}} model {{was used for}} estimating the drying and rewetting of long-grain rough rice in shallow beds due to forced aeration. Limitations of the {{simulation model}} were examined for the relative influences of grain layer thickness, time step, and airflow rate on predicted moisture content profiles in grain beds. A value of grain dry matter-to-air ratio {{equal to or greater}} than 0. 27 based on 1 -h time step was determined to yield close agreement between experimental and simulated moisture content profiles. Under such conditions, the simulated moisture content profiles were insensitive to the changes either in layer thickness or time step for a fixed value of grain dry matter-to-air ratio based on 1 -h time step. Results showed that equilibrium model predicted rough rice drying and rewetting in shallow-beds reasonably well when the developed criterion for grain dry matter-to-air ratio was applied in the simulation scheme.

40|$|The 5 MW(e) Dual Boiling Cycle Geothermal Power Plant, hence {{referred}} to as the Raft River plant, is being developed for DOE by EG and G, Inc., Idaho Falls, Idaho. This pilot power plant is of the binary concept and utilizes isobutane as the working second fluid. The plant will demonstrate the feasibility of power generation from an intermediate temperature ({approx} 290 F) resource. The plant is schematically diagrammed in Figure 1. During the final design phase and after the major components were specified to be made of carbon steel, and ordered, various conditions forced the power plant design to switch from surface water to geothermal fluid for the condenser cooling loop make-up water. Because the geothermal fluid contains significant concentrations of chlorides and sulfates, about 1000 ppm and 65 ppm respectively, <b>aeration</b> in the <b>cooling</b> tower causes this water to become extremely aggressive, especially in the pitting of carbon steel components. Although essentially all of the condenser cooling loop materials are carbon steel, the isobutane condenser and turbine lube oil cooler are the most vulnerable. These components are tubed with carbon steel tubes of 0. 085 and 0. 075 inch wall thickness. These two components are extremely leak critical heat exchangers. For example, even a single pit perforation in the isobutane condenser can cause plant shutdown through loss of isobutane. Such a leak also poses an explosion or fire hazard. As isobutane pressure falls, the incursion of cooling water into the isobutane loop could occur, causing damage to anhydrous service seals. Under a DOE contract for geothermal failure analysis, Radian Corporation has made a preliminary investigation of the pitting hazard presented by the aggressive cooling fluid and the corrosion inhibition treatment that has thus far been proposed. This report documents Radian's understanding of the present situation and the results of its investigation on possible mitigation of this hazard. Finally, various conclusions and recommendations are made that may, if pursued, lead to a satisfactory solution that will avert a certain early prolonged plant shutdown due to failure of the thin walled isobutane and turbine lube oil cooler tubes...|$|R
40|$|Each {{year about}} 2, 000, 000, 000 tonnes of cereal and other food grains are harvested, and their farm gate value {{is on the}} order of $ 500, 000, 000, 000. As a result, the global grains {{industry}} is similar in value to that of the oil industry. About 5 % of all grains harvested are destroyed during storage by insects, mites and fungi, and in some countries the spoilage exceeds 25 %. Grains can be stored for prolonged periods of time by manipulating the stored grains ecosystem by changing the temperature, grain moisture content or the composition of the intergranular atmosphere so that insect pests cannot survive. An effective method of preserving grains is to cool them by blowing through them ambient or refrigerated air. However, because grains are hygroscopic the temperature to which grains can be cooled is a function of both the temperature and the humidity of the air used to aerate them. Ceteris paribus the dryer the air, the lower the temperature to which the grains can be cooled. Warm air cannot be used for <b>aeration</b> and <b>cool</b> ambient air generally has a high relative humidity that limits the degree of cooling that can be achieved. Grains are often stored with moisture contents such that the relative humidity of the intergranular air is less than 60 %. In this work it is hypothesised that air leaving the upper surface of an aerated bulk of grain can be cooled and re-admitted to the grain at a thermodynamic state that is more favourable for cooling than ambient air. It is further hypothesised that solar energy incident on the roofs of grain stores passively dries the upper surface of stored grains thus further enhancing the behaviour of grains as a desiccant. A mathematical analysis suggests that grains can indeed be cooled by up to 5 ºC more using recirculated air, and this has a profoundly beneficial effect on the preservation of grains. The power consumption of the system is estimated to be about 1 W per tonne of grain stored, and the energy consumption is estimated to be 250 Wh per tonne per month of storage. The performance of a recircaeration system in a climate that is representative of a low altitude region in Southern Queensland in summer has been investigated. It is estimated that a population of the rice weevil, S. oryzae, would increase by a factor of about 6, 400 in unaerated wheat that has a moisture content of 11 % (wet basis) and a temperature of 30 °C, whereas in grain that is aerated with ambient air or using the proposed recircaeration system the increases are 1500 -fold and 350 -fold respectively. Similar reductions in populations of the lesser grain borer, Rhyzopertha dominica are obtained. Somewhat lower relative reductions in the decay of chemical pesticides are predicted over a period of 100 days, but the benefits of aeration and recircaeration manifest themselves over greater periods of time. The marginal capital cost of the system is negligible. Solar energy passively dries the upper surface of a bulk of grains by a process dubbed desiccaeration, but the benefit of this appears to be offset by the higher overall heat load on the system. Nonetheless, this aspect of the process is worthy of further research...|$|R
30|$|The {{other main}} source of water for the {{countries}} of the Arabian Peninsula is the non-renewable fossil groundwater stored in the sedimentary deep aquifers. The sandstone and limestone geological formations of the Arabian Shelf store significant amounts of groundwater that are thousands of years old (Edgell 1987). The sedimentary aquifers have been classified as either primary or secondary, based on their areal extent, groundwater volume, water quality, and development potential (UNESCO 2009). These aquifers cover two-thirds of Saudi Arabia and some of them extend into Kuwait, Bahrain, Qatar, the United Arab Emirates, Oman, and Yemen, as well as into Jordan, Syria, and Iraq. Vast amounts of groundwater stored in the primary deep aquifers serve as a dependable source of water for the central and northern regions of Saudi Arabia, and, to a lesser extent, the other countries of the peninsula. Deep groundwater reserves for the aquifers in the peninsula are estimated at 2175 BCM, with the major portion (1919 BCM) located in Saudi Arabia. Recharge for all the deep aquifers is estimated at a very limited 2.7 BCM per year (UN Water 2012). This reserve represents groundwater exploitable by lowering the water level to 300 m below the ground surface, the maximum depth currently possible with modern pumping technology. Although water in the deep aquifers is in large quantity, the quality varies greatly and is suitable for domestic consumption in only a few areas. Total dissolved solids range from 400 to 20, 000  ppm. Good-quality water is stored in only a few aquifers: the Saq, Tabuk, and Wajid in Saudi Arabia, and the Dammam in Bahrain and Kuwait. Brackish water from the Minjur, Wasia, Biyadh, and Um er-Radhuma aquifers usually requires treatment in most of the countries for hardness and high temperature. Water from these deep aquifers tends to be saturated with calcium and magnesium salts and has high concentrations of sulphate and chloride ions; it also contains relatively large quantities of hydrogen sulphide and carbon dioxide gases (FAO 2007). The brackish water from some of these deep aquifers is usually used without treatment for agricultural purposes, and for limited domestic purposes in some locations in Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Qatar, and the United Arab Emirates. The groundwater of most of the deep aquifers requires treatment such as <b>cooling,</b> <b>aeration</b> to remove hydrogen sulphide and carbon dioxide gases, and lime soda processing.|$|R
