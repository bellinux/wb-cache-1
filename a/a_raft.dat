5|$|Although each {{adult and}} {{independent}} juvenile forages alone, sea otters tend to rest together in single-sex groups called rafts. <b>A</b> <b>raft</b> typically contains 10 to 100 animals, with male rafts being larger than female ones. The largest raft ever seen contained over 2000 sea otters. To keep from drifting {{out to sea}} when resting and eating, sea otters may wrap themselves in kelp.|$|E
5|$|The Executive {{was struck}} on the {{starboard}} side; the explosion demolished the booms, engine, dynamos and all {{equipment in the}} immediate area. One hold rapidly flooded and the ship began to settle by the stern. Nine of the crew were killed, the remaining 53 abandoned ship in three lifeboats and <b>a</b> <b>raft.</b> The ship was sunk by gunfire from a destroyer about {{an hour after the}} attack.|$|E
40|$|This work {{focuses on}} the {{geotechnical}} behaviour of three foundation solutions for windmills. The first design is <b>a</b> traditional flat <b>raft,</b> the second is <b>a</b> deep flat <b>raft,</b> {{and the third is}} <b>a</b> conical <b>raft.</b> <b>A</b> comparative study between the traditional and the new solutions is performed. <b>A</b> conical <b>raft</b> is used to improve the resistance of the soil-structure interface. It is shown that <b>a</b> conical <b>raft</b> gives <b>a</b> significant decrease of tilting compared to <b>a</b> flat circular <b>raft.</b> The use of <b>a</b> conical <b>raft</b> can thus decrease the dimensions of the foundation which may lead to potential cost reductions...|$|R

5|$|A {{prototype}} of the automatic strobe unit was produced in October, along with a new Mk. IVA-like radar unit with a manual strobe for testing. EMI was then asked to provide another breadboard {{prototype of}} the strobe unit for air testing, which was delivered on 12 October. <b>A</b> <b>raft</b> of problems were found and addressed. Among these, {{it was found that}} the strobe would often stick to the ground reflection, and when it did not, would not stick until it had a strong signal at shorter ranges, or might stick to the wrong target. Eventually a panacea button was added to unstick the strobe in these cases.|$|E
5|$|Initially, Quisling's charges {{related to}} the coup, {{including}} his revocation of the mobilisation order, to his time as Nasjonal Samling leader and to his actions as Minister President, such as assisting the enemy and illegally attempting to alter the constitution. Finally, {{he was accused of}} Gunnar Eilifsen's murder. Whilst not contesting the key facts, he denied all charges on the grounds that he had always worked for a free and prosperous Norway, and submitted a sixty-page response. On 11 July, a further indictment was brought, adding <b>a</b> <b>raft</b> of new charges, including more murders, theft, embezzlement and, most worrying of all for Quisling, the charge of conspiring with Hitler over the 9 April occupation of Norway.|$|E
5|$|Plath wrote poetry {{from the}} age of eight, her first poem {{appearing}} in the Boston Traveller. By the time she arrived at Smith College she had written over 50 short stories and published in <b>a</b> <b>raft</b> of magazines. At Smith she majored in English and won all the major prizes in writing and scholarship. Additionally, she won a summer guest editor position at the young women's magazine Mademoiselle, and, on her graduation in 1955, she won the Glascock Prize for Two Lovers and a Beachcomber by the Real Sea. Later at Cambridge, she wrote for the University publication, Varsity.|$|E

5|$|Sydneys {{failure to}} reach Fremantle on 20 November was not {{initially}} cause for concern, as several factors might have delayed the cruiser, {{none of which}} were sufficient reason to break the order to maintain wireless silence. However, {{with no sign of}} the cruiser by 23 November, shore-based wireless stations began transmitting orders for Sydney to break silence and report in. <b>A</b> <b>raft</b> of German survivors was recovered by a British tanker on 24 November, at which point a large-scale air and sea search began. During this search, which lasted until the evening of 29 November, 318 survivors from Kormorans 399 personnel were found, but apart from a carley float and a lifebelt, nothing from Sydney or the 645 aboard was recovered.|$|E
5|$|The Fifth Earl {{also built}} the Grade II* listed Gardener's House {{at the back}} of the park, in a similar Palladian style. The head {{gardener}} of Althorp resided at the villa in the 18th century. Princess Diana had been intent on living in the house following her separation from Prince Charles, but due to security concerns it was considered unfeasible. Of particular note is its Victorian three-quarter life-sized marble sculpture, The Shipwrecked Mariner, depicting a sailor reaching desperately from <b>a</b> <b>raft.</b> Charles Spencer has since moved it from the main portico of Gardener's House to the main house.|$|E
5|$|Ecological {{damage was}} {{widespread}} but generally mild. Although damage to mangroves was minor, the cyclone defoliated swaths of many coastal and island forests. For the most part, cays and reefs were unharmed, with no visible {{change in the}} general appearance or shape of reefs and little underwater change as well. It was noted, however, that water clarity surrounding certain reefs was poor. River plumes of the Herbert, Tully, Murray, Hull, Johnstone, and Mulgrave/Russell rivers were noticeably changed, with some paths diverted. The Herbert River plume expanded to encompass areas near the Greater Palm group of islands, the Mulgrave/Russell around the Frankland Islands. In addition, the loss of <b>a</b> <b>raft</b> system utilized for farming of giant clams was noted near Fitzroy Island. Tourist operations experienced little damage from Winifred, with only minimal damage on Dunk Island, Bedarra Island, and Mission Beach. Overall, Winifred caused three deaths and $130million (1986AUD) in damage, and was described by the Bureau of Meteorology as the worst cyclone to strike Queensland since Cyclone Althea in 1971.|$|E

5|$|For {{nine weeks}} Riou and his small crew navigated the Guardian, by now {{little more than}} <b>a</b> <b>raft,</b> across the 400 leagues to the Cape of Good Hope. The Cape of Good Hope was sighted on 21 February 1790, and whalers were {{despatched}} from Table Bay to help the battered ship to safety. Riou ran her aground to prevent her sinking, but a gale struck the coast shortly afterwards, completing {{the wreck of the}} Guardian. The voyage was described by J. K. Laughton in the Dictionary of National Biography as 'almost without parallel'. Those who remained with the Guardian were among the few survivors of the accident. Of the boats sent out on 25 December, only the launch with 15 people survived, having been rescued by a French merchant. The launch had witnessed the sinking of the jolly-boat, before losing contact with the two cutters and the long-boat. Riou arranged for the surviving convicts who had helped to save the ship to be pardoned for their good service.|$|E
5|$|Gierek, like Gomułka in 1956, came {{to power}} on <b>a</b> <b>raft</b> of {{promises}} that everything would be different from now on: wages would rise, prices would remain stable, there would be freedom of speech, and {{those responsible for the}} violence at Gdynia and elsewhere would be punished. Although Poles were much more skeptical than they had been in 1956, Gierek was believed to be an honest and well-intentioned man, and his promises bought him some time. He used this time to create a new economic program, one based on large-scale borrowing from banks in the West — mainly from the United States and West Germany — to buy technology that would upgrade Poland's production of export goods. This massive borrowing, estimated to have totaled over 24 billion US (1970s) dollars during Gierek's years, was used to re-equip and modernize Polish industry, and to import consumer goods to give the workers more incentive to work.|$|E
5|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the Battle of the Bismarck Sea, Japanese troops and sailors were again shipwrecked on Goodenough Island. Responding to reports from ANGAU, the police and civilian informants, patrols searched the island for Japanese survivors. In a week of vigorous patrolling between 8 and 14 March 1943, the 47th Infantry Battalion located and killed 72 Japanese, captured 42, and found another nine dead on <b>a</b> <b>raft.</b> A remarkable coup was achieved by a patrol under Captain Joseph Pascoe that killed eight Japanese who had landed in two flat-bottomed boats. In the boats they found documents in sealed tins. On translation by the Allied Translator and Interpreter Section, one document {{turned out to be a}} copy of the Japanese Army List, with the names and postings of every officer. It therefore provided a complete order of battle of the Japanese Army, including many units never previously reported. Moreover, a mention of any Japanese officer could now be correlated with his unit. Copies were made available to intelligence units in every theatre of war against Japan.|$|E

5|$|On 18 February 1817 Alceste {{entered the}} Gaspar Strait between Bangka and Liat, {{traversing}} largely uncharted waters. Some hours later the frigate struck a hidden reef and grounded, sustaining severe damage to her hull. Despite Maxwell's {{best efforts to}} free his ship the carpenter reported that Alceste was taking on water and would rapidly sink if refloated. Ordering the ship to be abandoned, Maxwell gave the ship's barge to the ambassador and supervised the construction of <b>a</b> <b>raft</b> which, with the remaining boats, safely convoyed the crew, passengers and a quantity of supplies to a nearby island, formed largely of impenetrable mangrove swamps. The last to leave Alceste, Maxwell arrived on shore {{on the morning of}} 19 February. A council of officers subsequently decided that Amherst would take the ship's boats and 50 men and attempt to reach Batavia, four days sail away. It was essential that Amherst reach Batavia quickly, as the supplies salvaged from the wreck, especially of drinkable water, would only last a few days shared among all 250 survivors.|$|E

5|$|The Just So Stories each {{tell how}} a {{particular}} animal was modified from an original form {{to its current}} form by the acts of man, or some magical being. For example, the Whale has a tiny throat because he swallowed a mariner, who tied <b>a</b> <b>raft</b> inside to block the whale from swallowing other men. The Camel has a hump {{given to him by}} a djinn as punishment for the camel's refusing to work (the hump allows the camel to work longer between times of eating). The Leopard's spots were painted by an Ethiopian (after the Ethiopian painted himself black). The Kangaroo gets its powerful hind legs, long tail, and hopping gait after being chased all day by a dingo, sent by a minor god responding to the Kangaroo's request to be made different from all other animals.|$|E

5|$|The eggs may be {{deposited}} singly or {{in small}} groups, or may {{take the form of}} spherical egg masses, rafts or long strings. In terrestrial caecilians, the eggs are laid in grape-like clusters in burrows near streams. The amphibious salamander Ensatina attaches its similar clusters by stalks to underwater stems and roots. The greenhouse frog (Eleutherodactylus planirostris) lays eggs in small groups in the soil where they develop in about two weeks directly into juvenile frogs without an intervening larval stage. The tungara frog (Physalaemus pustulosus) builds a floating nest from foam to protect its eggs. First <b>a</b> <b>raft</b> is built, then eggs are laid in the centre, and finally a foam cap is overlaid. The foam has anti-microbial properties. It contains no detergents but is created by whipping up proteins and lectins secreted by the female.|$|E
5|$|The island {{they arrived}} on {{turned out to}} be {{uninhabited}} with little food and no apparent water. After a camp had been set up ashore, White was sent back to the still floating Grasshopper to scavenge supplies. He boarded the vessel and descended below decks to search for any items that might be of use. Whilst there, he felt Judy in the darkness, pinned in her bed under a row of lockers. He constructed <b>a</b> <b>raft</b> out of materials on the Grasshopper and rowed the items, along with Judy, back to the island. The lack of water was becoming an issue, until Judy began to dig at a point on the waterline. It took a couple of minutes, but Judy managed to unearth a fresh-water spring and was credited with saving everyone's lives. During the first night, the magazine on the Grasshopper finally caught light and exploded, sinking the vessel. The survivors continued to camp on the beach for the following few days, with Judy protecting them from snakes.|$|E
5|$|The {{location}} of the Soak Zone was originally an island known as Flower Island, until part of the surrounding lake was filled in. Under previous names {{it was called the}} H20hhh Zone and later Dr. Hydro's Soak Zone. The area originally consisted of just the pool and bathhouse, until slides were first added in 1985. <b>A</b> <b>raft</b> ride, Rafter's Run, was added the next year. The water park has since been expanded to include body slides, inner-tube slides, a slide with foam mats, and many features for children, including a miniature pool and Captain Kidd's Adventure Galley, a play area added in 2006. The swimming pool was replaced by a heated wave pool in 2011. The addition was the park's single-largest capital improvement. For the 2013 season the park added a lazy river and an expanded beach area.|$|E
