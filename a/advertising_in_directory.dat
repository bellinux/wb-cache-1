40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the effect of}} competition on second degree price discrimination <b>in</b> display <b>advertising</b> <b>in</b> Yellow Page <b>directories.</b> Our main empirical finding is that while competition is associated with lower prices, the association is not proportional along the range of product offerings. Instead, directories that face more competitors offer price schedules that display {{a greater degree of}} curvature than directories facing less competition. This means that purcahsers of the largest ads pay less per ad size relative to purchasers of small ads for ads <b>in</b> more competitive <b>directories...</b>|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the effect of}} competition on second degree price discrimination <b>in</b> display <b>advertising</b> <b>in</b> Yellow Page <b>directories.</b> Recent theoretical work makes conflicting predictions {{about the effect of}} competition on curvature. Our main empirical finding is that competition increases the curvature of the price schedule, meaning that purchasers of the largest ads see their prices fall the most in response to competition. We also present evidence of menu costs in adjusting pricing schedules and address this issue in estimation. The magnitudes that we find could be relevant for welfare calculations in the face of price discrimination. ...|$|R
40|$|In optical {{research}} networks, {{the need}} to enable network users to dynamically provision and manage network resources inspired {{the development of the}} User Controlled Lightpath Provisioning System (UCLP). The UCLP version 2 (UCLPv 2) is based on a service-oriented architecture in which network resources are abstracted as and managed via Web Services. It introduces a new concept, called Articulated Private Network, where end-users collect resources from several different domains to dynamically articulate and change their network topology. In the current UCLPv 2 system, the process of resource sharing is manual, usually error prone and inefficient. This thesis proposes, designs and implements a new functionality for resource advertising and discovery as an enhancement to the UCPv 2 system. The new functionality describes the UCLPv 2 resources based on the Resource Description Framework (RDF) and <b>advertises</b> them <b>in</b> <b>directories.</b> This allows automation of the resource advertising and discovery. By adopting RDF, the capability of sharing resources with other provisioning applications is achieved...|$|R
