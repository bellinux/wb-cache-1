25|$|Soon after touring {{she began}} to record her second album, Fake Chemical State, which was {{released}} for sale on 20 March 2006, preceded by new single Just Let the Sun two weeks earlier. The first single actually issued from this album was <b>Alone</b> <b>in</b> <b>My</b> Room, a download-only track released on 7 November 2005. 'Alone in My Room' was also the name given to Skin's first solo tour in two years, which commenced in Berlin in November 2005. For this album she shaved her head bald again, returning to the look she had in her Skunk Anansie days.|$|E
500|$|By late September 1945 the Thomases {{had left}} Wales and were living with various friends in London. The {{publication}} of Deaths and Entrances in 1946 {{was a turning}} point for Thomas. Poet and critic Walter J. Turner commented in The Spectator, [...] "This book <b>alone,</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> opinion, ranks him as a major poet".|$|E
500|$|Also that month, Cosmopolitan {{published}} {{the first interview}} with Manning in prison, conducted by mail. Cosmo reported that Manning was optimistic about recent progress but said that not being allowed to grow her hair long was [...] "painful and awkward … I am torn up. I get through each day okay, but at night, when I'm <b>alone</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> room, I finally burn out and crash." [...] Manning said it was [...] "very much a relief" [...] to announce {{that she is a}} woman and did not fear the public response. [...] "Honestly, I'm not terribly worried about what people out there might think of me. I just try to be myself." [...] According to Cosmo, Manning had her own cell with [...] "two tall vertical windows that face the sun", and could see [...] "trees and hills and blue sky and all the things beyond the buildings and razor wire". Manning denied being harassed by other inmates and claimed some had become confidantes.|$|E

6000|$|Blanche's bright {{face flushed}} up. [...] "If you think Anne a half-bred person, Lady Lundie, you stand <b>alone</b> <b>in</b> your opinion. <b>My</b> uncle doesn't agree with you, I'm sure." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Don't be an ass,' said Lowndes. 'You are at full {{liberty to}} make fun of {{anything}} else you like, but leave that hymn <b>alone.</b> It's associated <b>in</b> <b>my</b> mind with the most sacred recollections----' ...|$|R
500|$|The {{book also}} found early success with book buyers {{and the general}} public. It sold 6,000 copies {{in its first year}} and 1,600 in its second. Frances Chrystie, the {{juvenile}} buyer for FAO Schwarz, wrote to Bennett Cerf, Geisel's publisher, [...] "I've been sitting <b>alone</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> apartment reading Horton aloud to myself over and over again... It's the funniest book I've ever seen... merchandise manager thinks he can find an elephant in the store, and we can make a tree and lay an egg and have a very fine window for Book Week." [...] Mary Stix of James Book Store in Cincinnati, Ohio, noted the book's popularity with adults as well as children. Numerous booksellers invited Geisel to hold autographing events at their stores, and Cerf sent him on a tour across several U.S. cities to promote the book. However, the book was less well received in England, where it was rejected by seven publishers before Hamish Hamilton finally published it, to modest success, in 1947. This mirrored a general trend, as Dr. Seuss books were slow to catch on in England.|$|E
2500|$|... "The Trap", a {{short story}} by H.P. Lovecraft and Henry S. Whitehead, centers around a mirror. [...] "It was on a certain Thursday morning in December {{that the whole thing}} began with that unaccountable motion I thought I saw in my antique Copenhagen mirror. Something, it seemed to me, stirred—something {{reflected}} in the glass, though I was <b>alone</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> quarters." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 2012, she {{publicly}} revealed her eight-year {{struggle with}} bulimia, explaining how during {{her time in}} the Pussycat Dolls, [...] "I just hated myself. I was in a group but I never felt so <b>alone</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> life... I never did drugs, but hurting myself was my addiction. The music is what saved me. That's the only thing I can trust.".|$|E
60|$|Somewhere upon my way {{the road}} forked, but I do not {{remember}} whether that was near Shaphambury or {{near the end of}} my walk. The hesitation between two rutted unmade roads <b>alone</b> remains clear <b>in</b> <b>my</b> mind.|$|R
60|$|One night--it was a {{night of}} full moon--I sat <b>alone</b> with Umslopogaas <b>in</b> <b>my</b> hut, and we spoke of the matter of our plots; then, when we had {{finished}} that talk, we spoke of Nada the Lily.|$|R
6000|$|He {{was silent}} for a moment. [...] "No; it has been stolen, it is true, but I shall still find it. And by myself <b>alone!</b> <b>In</b> your profession, <b>my</b> dear fellow, when a member is seriously ill, he does not {{prescribe}} for himself, but calls in a brother doctor. Therein we differ. I shall take this matter <b>in</b> <b>my</b> own hands." ...|$|R
2500|$|The famous Old English riddle Ic wæs be Sonde {{describes}} a conch: [...] "I was by sound, near seawall, at ocean-stream; I dwelt <b>alone</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> first resting place... Little did I know that I, ere or since, ever should speak mouthless over mead-benches." [...] Another meaning given to this riddle [...] "Ic wæs be Sonde" [...] {{is that the}} sound of the conch corresponds to spiritualised sound as heard in higher realms. In the Hindu tradition, the conch shell is used in ceremony as the sound it makes is said to correspond with higher frequency universal sounds associated with music of the spheres.|$|E
6000|$|... ‘Let {{me leave}} you with your sister, whom it is time you took home,’ said Mr. Crisparkle. ‘You will find me <b>alone</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> room by-and-by.’ ...|$|E
6000|$|When we {{were again}} <b>alone</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> study, Zulime said, [...] "I'm {{going to enjoy}} it here. I like your people, and I hope they liked me." ...|$|E
5000|$|Tuaolo {{is also an}} author. His autobiography, <b>Alone</b> <b>in</b> the Trenches: <b>My</b> Life As a Gay Man in the NFL, was {{released}} {{in the spring of}} 2006. (...) [...] It details Tuaolo's upbringing and sheds light on how his experiences with poverty, sexuality, and football shaped him.|$|R
6000|$|... "Dear Kitty, I {{will come}} and stay all night on purpose," [...] said Dorothea; [...] "but I want to be <b>alone</b> now, and <b>in</b> <b>my</b> own home. I wish to know the Farebrothers better, and to talk to Mr. Farebrother about what {{there is to be}} done in Middlemarch." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, I {{bought it}} of her. I've been {{a sort of}} patron of her ever since I found out how she stood towards us. As she was quite <b>alone</b> here <b>in</b> Washington, <b>my</b> mother and sister have taken her up, and have been doing the social thing." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, WRETCH!" [...] said Tressilian; [...] "for were he aught better, {{why are you}} here, and <b>alone,</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> apartment? why was not fitting {{provision}} {{made for}} your honourable reception?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Shall I sit <b>alone</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> chamber, [...] And duly {{the table}} lay, [...] Whilst {{you stand up}} in the diet, [...] And have not a word to say?--Old Danish Ballad.|$|E
6000|$|Shall I sit <b>alone</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> chamber, [...] And set {{the chairs}} by the wall, [...] While you sit with lords and princes, [...] Yet have not a thought at all? ...|$|E
60|$|Apart from {{personal}} experiences, this movement must gain great additional solidity from the wonderful literature which has sprung up around {{it during the}} last few years. If no other spiritual books were in existence than five which have appeared {{in the last year or}} so--I allude to Professor Lodge's Raymond, Arthur Hill's Psychical Investigations, Professor Crawford's Reality of Psychical Phenomena, Professor Barrett's Threshold of the Unseen, and Gerald Balfour's Ear of Dionysius--those five <b>alone</b> would, <b>in</b> <b>my</b> opinion, be sufficient to establish the facts for any reasonable enquirer.|$|R
6000|$|... "No {{wonder you}} are puzzled," [...] he continued, [...] "so was {{everybody}} in the court that day, every one save myself. I <b>alone</b> could see <b>in</b> <b>my</b> mind's eye that gruesome murder such {{as it had been}} committed, with all its details, and, above all, its motive, and such as you will see it presently, when I place it all clearly before you.|$|R
50|$|In Lasthein's own words:Basically {{the idea}} is to take the viewer on a visual journey through the {{borderland}} between European East and West. Not claiming any kind of truth, the conditions are decided by myself <b>alone,</b> <b>in</b> relation to <b>my</b> own internal boundaries: What can it be like being European? An attempt to open up some borders - my own, and maybe even others.|$|R
6000|$|... "Did I {{believe her}} when I was meditating on our interview, <b>alone</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> room? Or did I suspect you of having robbed {{me of the}} only {{consolation}} that makes my life endurable? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No," [...] replied Watty with {{increasing}} {{interest in the}} American; [...] "we escaped on a raft to an island, off which I was blown, while <b>alone</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> boat only two days ago." ...|$|E
60|$|That evening, {{when we were}} <b>alone</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> chamber {{where none}} could hear us, I told Kari that Quilla was promised in {{marriage}} to a prince who would be Inca of all the land.|$|E
60|$|I meant, {{as soon as}} I {{heard he}} was on the way, to leave Arghouse, make visits among friends, and decide on my future home, for, alas! there was no one who wanted me. I was quite <b>alone</b> <b>in</b> the world; <b>my</b> mother's cousins were not near, and I hardly knew them; and my only {{relations}} were the bushrangers, as Lady Diana Tracy called them.|$|R
60|$|About four or {{five days}} after they came again for some victuals, and gave the {{governor}} an account where they had pitched their tents, and marked themselves out an habitation or plantation: it was a very convenient place indeed, on the remotest part of the island, N.E. much about the place where I providentially landed <b>in</b> <b>my</b> first voyage when I was driven out to sea, the Lord <b>alone</b> knows whither, <b>in</b> <b>my</b> foolish attempt to surround the island.|$|R
6000|$|The seaman's {{instinct}} <b>alone</b> survived whole <b>in</b> <b>my</b> moral dissolution. I {{descended the}} ladder to the quarter-deck. The starlight seemed to die out before reaching that spot, but when I asked quietly: [...] "Are you there, men?" [...] my eyes made out shadow forms starting up around me, very few, very indistinct; and a voice spoke: [...] "All here, sir." [...] Another amended anxiously: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Were danger <b>alone</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> way," [...] said Peveril, much {{surprised}} at the softened tone in which Bridgenorth made this observation, [...] "there are few things which I would not face to--to--deserve your good opinion." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Will you seat yourself," [...] {{said the}} old man, [...] "and forgive me if I leave you? I am <b>alone</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> house to-night, {{and if you are}} to eat I must forage for you myself." ...|$|E
60|$|Our plans being fixed, {{they were}} at once carried into effect, and the same evening I found myself <b>alone</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> yacht, with no one but the skipper and crew and the {{faithful}} Lancey, to keep me company.|$|E
60|$|As for myself, I {{was either}} too stupid or too {{innocent}} to feel any positive forewarning of the truth, so far. After luncheon, while I was <b>alone</b> <b>in</b> the conservatory, <b>my</b> maid {{came to me}} from Michael, asking if I had any commands {{for him in the}} afternoon. I thought this rather odd; but {{it occurred to me that}} he might want some hours to himself. I made the inquiry.|$|R
5000|$|In {{addition}} to this motif, the play features a series of seemingly metaphysical observations, which characters make about themselves or about unspecified third parties. For example, Mouth states: [...] "Everyone does not know me. I am <b>alone</b> here <b>in</b> <b>my</b> wardrobe and the mirror is blank when I look at myself." [...] Another such line reads: [...] "The void drinks the void: air was born with blue eyes, that's why it endlessly swallows aspirin." [...] One other exchange, in which Ear compares herself to a [...] "prize horse", results later in the text in an actual metamorphosis, through which she becomes the horse Clytemnestra (named after the femme fatale character in Greek myths).|$|R
