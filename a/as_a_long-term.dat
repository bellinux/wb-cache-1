5|$|Following Operation Kraai in 1948, {{in which}} Dutch forces conquered the republican capital at Yogyakarta and {{captured}} {{much of the}} Sukarno government, Soeman was made commander of the guerrilla forces in Riau. Aside from continuing the fight, he was tasked with finding new fighters to support the republican cause. In this mission, he was aided in part by his extensive networks <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>long-term</b> schoolteacher, and many of Soeman's fighters were former students of his. Though his troops were underarmed, Soeman led them into combat against Dutch-allied indigene troops several times.|$|E
5|$|Natalizumab and {{mitoxantrone}} {{are considered}} highly effective {{both in terms}} of relapse rate reduction and halting disability progression, however, they are related to dangerous side-effects that have led them to be considered second-line treatments. Natalizumab halves the risk of suffering relapses when compared to interferons, having an overall efficacy of over 70%. Moreover, mitoxantrone is also highly useful to reduce attacks and disability, but it is generally not considered <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>long-term</b> therapy due to its severe cardiac toxicity.|$|E
5|$|At the July 1945 general {{election}} Dunglass lost his Parliamentary {{seat in the}} landslide Labour victory. It was widely assumed that as his father, the 13th earl, was in his seventies, Dunglass's political career was behind him, as he would soon inherit the earldom. There being at that time no provision for peers to disclaim their peerages, this would bring with it an obligatory seat in the House of Lords, with no option of remaining in the Commons, where most political power resided. Dunglass was appointed {{a director of the}} Bank of Scotland in 1946, and although he never considered banking <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>long-term</b> occupation he gained valuable first-hand experience in commerce and finance. He remained with the bank until 1951.|$|E

5|$|Historically, {{the game}} was {{developed}} on natural grass turf. However, in 1976, the International Hockey Federation (FIH) made artificial pitches mandatory at all major competitions. The 1976 Summer Olympics in Montreal {{was the first of}} these; however at this time few players had seen or played on synthetic pitches. Although it is still permissible to play on natural turf all national competitions and international matches must be played on an artificial surface. Elite-level competitions, such as the Olympic Games and World Cup, require a water-based playing surface. However, due to water conservation efforts, this is not seen <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>long-term</b> sustainable option and alternative elite surfaces that do not require water are being researched.|$|E
5|$|Janet Jackson (born May 16, 1966) is an American pop singer-songwriter and actress, who is {{considered}} to be a gay icon. Jackson garnered a substantial gay following during the 1990s as she gained prominence in popular music. Recognized <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>long-term</b> ally of the LGBT community, Jackson received the GLAAD Media Award for Outstanding Music Album for her Grammy Award-winning sixth studio album The Velvet Rope (1997), which spoke out against homophobia and embraced same-sex love. In 2005, Jackson received the Humanitarian Award from the Human Rights Campaign and AIDS Project Los Angeles in recognition of her involvement in raising funds for AIDS Charities and received the Vanguard Award at the 19th Annual GLAAD Media Awards in 2008. In June 2012, Jackson announced she is currently executive producing a documentary on the lives of transgender people around the world titled Truth, saying she agreed to sign on to help stop discrimination against the transgender community.|$|E
5|$|The {{government}} {{determined that}} it did not need to go ahead with an immediate replacement for the Canberra and preferred Hancock's original choice of the TFX <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>long-term</b> solution, leading to the Menzies government's announcement on 24 October that it was ordering 24 F-111s for US$125 million, enough for two squadrons. The announcement came during the campaigning for the 1963 general election. Calwell's Labor party had on 22 October reiterated its pre-campaign promise that it would replace the Canberras as soon as it formed a government. The government's announcement, and the consequent improvement of its chances against Labor, likely also benefited the United States; the purchase helped rebut American critics of the TFX, and the Kennedy administration preferred Menzies' defence policies to the opposition's. The contract was signed the following year through the U.S. Department of Defense. The British government's cancellation of the TSR-2 in April 1965 showed that Australia's decision to not order it was correct.|$|E

5|$|Long-serving coach Carles Rexach was {{appointed}} as his replacement, initially {{on a temporary}} basis, and managed to at least steer the club to the last Champions League spot {{on the final day}} of the season. Despite better form in La Liga and a good run to the semi-finals of the Champions League, Rexach was never viewed <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>long-term</b> solution and that summer Van Gaal returned to the club for a second spell as manager. What followed, despite another decent Champions League performance, was one of the worst La Liga campaigns in the club's history, with the team as low as 15th in February 2003. This led to Van Gaal's resignation and replacement for the rest of the campaign by Radomir Antić, though a sixth-place finish was the best that he could manage. At the end of the season, Antić's short-term contract was not renewed, and club president Joan Gaspart resigned, his position having been made completely untenable by such a disastrous season on top of the club's overall decline in fortunes since he became president three years prior.|$|E
5|$|The departures of Núñez and Van Gaal {{were hardly}} noticed by the fans when {{compared}} to that of Luís Figo, then club vice-captain. Figo had become a cult hero and was considered by Catalans to be one of their own. Barcelona fans, however, were distraught by Figo's decision to join arch-rivals Real Madrid, and, during subsequent visits to the Camp Nou, Figo was given an extremely hostile reception. Upon his first return, a piglet's head and a full bottle of whiskey were thrown at him from the crowd. The next three years saw the club in decline, and managers came and went. Van Gaal was replaced by Lorenzo Serra Ferrer who, despite an extensive investment in players in the summer of 2000, presided over a mediocre league campaign and a humiliating first-round Champions League exit, and was eventually dismissed late in the season. Long-serving coach Carles Rexach was appointed as his replacement, initially on a temporary basis, and managed to at least steer the club to the last Champions League spot {{on the final day of}} the season.
