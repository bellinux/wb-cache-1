McCain {{was sent to a}} different camp on the outskirts of Hanoi. In December 1967, McCain was placed in a cell with two other Americans who did not expect him to live more than a week. In March 1968, McCain was placed into solitary confinement, where he would remain for two years.|$|E
5|$|John and Josephine deeply {{wish to have}} a {{child and}} when she is born with skin <b>as</b> <b>white</b> <b>as</b> snow, lips as red as blood, and hair as black as ebony, they name her Snow White. However, Josephine, Snow White's mother, dies in childbirth, leaving John alone with their child. In the winter, John struggles to find food for his daughter, Snow White, when he sheds a tear over a frozen lake and frees a {{creature}} known as the Green-Eyed One. As thanks for freeing him, Green-Eyed One offers John three wishes. For John's wishes, he asks for nourishment for his daughter, a kingdom to raise his family, and a queen for a new wife, as the creature cannot raise the dead.|$|E
5|$|When the ducklings {{were ready}} for slaughter, the duckers would {{generally}} kill them on their own premises. The slaughter would generally {{take place in the}} morning, to ensure the ducks would be ready for market in the evening. To keep the meat <b>as</b> <b>white</b> <b>as</b> possible, the ducks would be suspended upside down and their necks broken backwards, and held in this position until their blood had run towards their heads. They were kept in this position for ten minutes before being plucked, as otherwise their blood would collect in those parts of the body from which the feathers had been plucked. The plucking was generally carried out by the women of the household. The plucked carcasses would be sent to market, and the feathers would be sold direct to London dealers.|$|E
60|$|So the Reverend and I {{had at last}} {{arrived at}} Hamilton, the {{principal}} town in the Bermuda Islands. A wonderfully <b>white</b> town; <b>white</b> <b>as</b> snow itself. <b>White</b> <b>as</b> marble; <b>white</b> <b>as</b> flour. Yet looking like none of these, exactly. Never mind, we said; we shall hit upon a figure by and by that will describe this peculiar white.|$|R

5000|$|In Alabama, for example, its 1901 {{constitution}} {{restricted the}} franchise for poor <b>whites</b> <b>as</b> well as blacks. It contained requirements for payment of cumulative poll taxes, completion of literacy tests, and increased residency at state, county and precinct levels, effectively disenfranchised {{tens of thousands}} of poor <b>whites</b> <b>as</b> well as most blacks. Historian J. Morgan Kousser found, [...] "They disfranchised these <b>whites</b> <b>as</b> willingly as they deprived blacks of the vote." [...] By 1941, more whites than blacks in total had been disenfranchised.|$|R
25|$|The tips of {{the ears}} are rounded, with black hair along the edge. There are no tufts of longer hair {{on the top of}} the ears. Adult Iriomote cats have a white spot on the back of each ear, much like those found on tigers' ears. Young Iriomote cats do not have these marks, and even as adults the spots will not be <b>as</b> <b>white</b> <b>as</b> those seen on other leopard cat subspecies.|$|E
25|$|At the {{outbreak}} of World War I, Albizu Campos volunteered in the United States Infantry. Albizu was commissioned a Second Lieutenant in the Army Reserves {{and sent to the}} City of Ponce, where he organized the town's Home Guard. He was called to serve in the regular Army and sent to Camp Las Casas for further training. Upon completing the training, he was assigned to the 375th Infantry Regiment. The United States Army, then segregated, assigned Puerto Ricans of recognizably African descent as soldiers to the all-black units, such as the 375th Regiment. Officers were men classified <b>as</b> <b>white,</b> <b>as</b> was Albizu Campos.|$|E
25|$|From {{the years}} 1500 to 1850, an {{estimated}} 3.5 million captives were forcibly shipped from West/Central Africa to Brazil; the territory received {{the highest number}} of slaves of any country in the Americas. Scholars estimate {{that more than half of}} the Brazilian population is at least in part descended from these individuals. Brazil has the largest population of Afro-descendants outside of Africa. In contrast to the US, during the slavery period and after, the Portuguese colonial government and later Brazilian government did not pass formal anti-miscegenation or segregation laws. As in other Latin American countries, intermarriage was prevalent during the colonial period and continued afterward. In addition, people of mixed race (pardo) often tended to marry white spouses, and their descendants became accepted <b>as</b> <b>white.</b> <b>As</b> a result, some of the European descended population also has West African or Amerindian blood. According to the last census of the 20th century, in which Brazilians could choose from five color/ethnic categories with which they identified, 54% of individuals identified as white, 6.2% identified as black, and 39.5% identified as pardo (brown)— a broad multi-racial category, including tri-racial persons.|$|E

25|$|Wanyan Heda's army {{still had}} more than 100,000 men after the battle at Mount Yu, and the Mongols adopted a {{strategy}} of exhausting the enemy. The Jin troops had little rest {{all the way from}} Dengzhou, and had not eaten for three days because of the severing of their supply lines. Their morale was plummeting and their commanders were losing confidence. When they reached Three-peaked Hill, a snowstorm suddenly broke out, and it was so cold that the faces of the Jin troops went <b>as</b> <b>white</b> <b>as</b> corpses, and they could hardly march. Rather than attack them when they were desperate with their backs to the wall, the Mongols left them an escape route and then ambushed them when they let down their guard during the retreat. The Jin army collapsed without a fight, and the Mongols pursued the fleeing Jin troops relentlessly. Wanyan Heda was killed, and most of his commanders also lost their lives. After the Battle of Three-peaked Hill, Kaifeng was doomed and Emperor Aizong soon abandoned the city and entered Hebei Province in a vain attempt to reestablish himself there. Thousands of people offered a stubborn resistance to the Mongols, who entrusted the conduct of the attack to Subutai, the most daring of all their commanders. Emperor Aizong was driven south again, and by this time Kaifeng had been taken by the Mongols so he established his new capital at Caizhou (present-day Runan County, Henan Province). Subutai wished to massacre the whole of the population. But fortunately for the Khitans, Yelü Chucai was more humane, and under his advice Ögedei Khan rejected the cruel proposal.|$|E

500|$|Eventually, {{three of}} Hemings' four {{surviving}} children, except for Madison, chose to identify as white {{adults in the}} North; they were seven-eighths European in ancestry, and this was consistent with their appearance. In his memoir, Madison Hemings said both Beverley and Harriet married well in the white community in Washington, DC. Harriet was described by Edmund Bacon, the longtime Monticello overseer, as [...] "nearly <b>as</b> <b>white</b> <b>as</b> anybody, and very beautiful." [...] For some time Madison wrote to both his siblings and learned of their marriages. He knew that Harriet had children and was living in Maryland, but gradually she and Beverly stopped responding to his letters, and the siblings lost touch.|$|E
500|$|Following refusals from Spain, Portugal, France and Savoy, Leopold I, Holy Roman Emperor, {{suggested}} Johann Wilhelm, Elector Palatine. James II of England {{put forward}} his brother-in-law, Francesco II d'Este, Duke of Modena, but the Princess deemed a duke too lowly {{in terms of}} protocol for {{the daughter of a}} grand duke. The Elector Palatine obtained the style Royal Highness from the Holy Roman Emperor for Cosimo III in February 1691. (Cosimo had hitherto been outranked by the Duke of Savoy — much to his anger—who derived royal status from his successful pretendership to the abolished Cypriot throne). Consequently, Johann Wilhelm was ultimately chosen. He and Anna Maria Luisa were married by proxy on 29 April 1691. At the accompanying festivities, a contemporary describes the Electress's physical attributes: [...] "In her person, she is tall, her complexion was fair, her eyes large and expressive, both those and her hair were black; her mouth was small, with a fullness of the lips; her teeth were <b>as</b> <b>white</b> <b>as</b> ivory...." ...|$|E
