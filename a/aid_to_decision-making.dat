Unfortunately, many British managers have {{a low level of}} numeracy and find this area difficult. From practical experience with such courses, it is argued that some of the special difficulties and the widely varying needs of middleaged managers might be met by introducing a self-scheduling learning scheme. The features of this approach to teaching are discussed against a background of the widespread interest in individualized learning in other areas of education. A proposed system for teaching quantitative techniques is described to illustrate this approach and raise a number of design issues. ...|$|R
40|$|This book {{focuses on}} a major and highly {{significant}} development in the governing of education across the globe: the use of knowledge-based technologies to make policy, rather than simply as <b>aids</b> <b>to</b> <b>decision-making.</b> These technologies, we suggest, are themselves becoming the process of governing. A combination of factors has produced this shift. First, the massive expansion of technological capacity signalled {{by the arrival of}} ‘big data’ (McKinsey 2013) allows for the collection, circulation and processing of extensive system knowledge. The second factor is the growth of comparison as a basis for and justification of action. This growth is accompanied, inevitably, by the increasing displacement of contextualised, messy and ‘local’ understandings and meanings as resources for policy development, along with much of the ideological debate that previously fuelled a politics of education...|$|R

30|$|OMP and antibiotic-resistant {{organisms in}} the urban water cycle of Berlin are {{analyzed}} together with toxicological assessments and a human biomonitoring. This approach facilitates a scientific assessment of corresponding risks in urban areas. Different treatment options at different places within the water cycle are tested from bench scale up to large scale. Accompanying cost and life cycle assessments support the selection of most efficient technical measures {{with regards to the}} removal of harmful OMP and organisms and thus minimizes risk. A basis for an appropriate communication of potential risks is supported by an extensive sociological survey of the perception of OMP-related risks. The detailed scientific assessment of risks is used to implement a risk management system. Outcomes of the research project ASKURIS will provide an <b>aid</b> <b>to</b> <b>decision-making</b> for preventive measures against possible actual or future risks emanating from OMP and antibiotic-resistant microorganisms.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: A {{primary use}} for {{mathematical}} models, in {{fields such as}} environmental management, economics and engineering, is prediction. Prediction can aid choice between decisions by assessing their consequences, or between models by comparing their prediction performance. Choice between models raises fewer questions of how to use predictions, and this paper concentrates instead on prediction for decision-making. It starts with an illustration of how systematic but easily overlooked modelling error can spoil prediction. Three radically differing approaches <b>to</b> supporting <b>decision-making</b> with imprecise predictions are then reviewed: Bayesian optimal decision theory, model predictive control and set-membership prediction. Their potential and limitations as <b>aids</b> <b>to</b> environmental <b>decision-making</b> are discussed...|$|R

40|$|Metabonomics is an {{established}} technology {{concerned with the}} analysis of human and animal biofluids to reveal and understand changes in metabolite profiles resulting from interventions such as drug administration, disease, ageing and genetic change. Typically, these studies are performed by the analysis of metabolites in biofluids such as urine or blood plasma by powerful analytical technologies such as nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy or liquid chromatography - mass spectrometry (LC-MS). Pharmacometabonomics is a newer technology concerned {{with the use of}} pre-dose metabolite profiles to predict responses to drugs prior to dosing. Differences observed in responses to drugs such as varying pharmacokinetics, metabolism, efficacy or toxicity in different sub-groups of patients may be correlated with differences in pre-dose metabolite profiles between those particular patient sub-groups. This then enables prediction of drug response in patients on the basis of pre-dose metabolite profile analysis. Pharmacometabonomics is thus a valuable <b>aid</b> <b>to</b> <b>decision-making</b> in stratified or personalised medicine...|$|E

The work reported here has translated this concept into practical results in a vital area of public service. This is a small but significant advance, of potential value to urban governments everywhere. ...|$|E

40|$|The {{operations}} of the dispatch department of a manufacturing organization have been analysed in terms of matching the labour supply to the labour demand (as determined by customer orders). The problem differed somewhat from those traditionally associated with dispatch departments since set-up costs and company policy resulted in high stocks being carried.

40|$|Rapid {{advances}} in {{information and communication}} technology have made ubiquitous computing and the Internet of Things popular and practicable. These applications create enormous volumes of data, which are available for analysis and classification as an <b>aid</b> <b>to</b> <b>decision-making.</b> Among the classification methods used to deal with big data, feature selection has proven particularly effective. One common approach involves searching through {{a subset of the}} features that are the most relevant to the topic or represent the most accurate description of the dataset. Unfortunately, searching through this kind of subset is a combinatorial problem that can be very time consuming. Meaheuristic algorithms are commonly used to facilitate the selection of features. The artificial fish swarm algorithm (AFSA) employs the intelligence underlying fish swarming behavior as a means to overcome optimization of combinatorial problems. AFSA has proven highly successful in a diversity of applications; however, there remain shortcomings, such as the likelihood of falling into a local optimum and a lack of multiplicity. This study proposes a modified AFSA (MAFSA) to improve feature selection and parameter optimization for support vector machine classifiers. Experiment results demonstrate the superiority of MAFSA in classification accuracy using subsets with fewer features for given UCI datasets, compared to the original FASA...|$|E
