50|$|NETRA is {{a mobile}} eye {{diagnostic}} device developed at MIT Media Lab {{consisting of a}} clip-on eyepiece and a software app for smart phones. The co-inventors include Ramesh Raskar and Vitor Pamplona. It {{can be seen as}} the inverse of expensive Shack-Hartmann sensors. NETRA allows for the early, low-cost diagnosis of the most common refractive Refractive Disorders. The subject looks into the device and aligns patterns on the display. By repeating this procedure for eight meridians, the required refractive correction is computed. NETRA exploits the fact that aberrations are expressed using only a few parameters (Spherical, Cylindrical and Axis of Astigmatism) to create an easier user interaction approach. Leveraging mobile connectivity, the system can transmit test data to appropriate facilities for immediate action, aggregate data for use in analysis, or instruct a separate machine for <b>automatic</b> <b>dispensing</b> of spectacles.|$|R

Integration of CAD system generates digital {{information that can be}} subsequently used to produce screens directly by the latest laser technology or by conventional means using the computer production system. The systems help in improving tedious design, manipulation/separation, and coloration tasks. A designer can manipulate colors on a visual display unit (VDU) by software control and also produce an interpretation of the design/coloring on the VDU. The system used for color management and communication should be able to interpret the design, communicate, and predict the correct process, control the <b>automatic</b> <b>dispensing</b> of the colorants, and define the printing technology for the specific substrate. In order to obtain the desired color on the textiles, CAD developers use elementary calibration procedures using thousands of colors.

40|$|In Part I, we {{describe}} an efficient methodology for the combinatorial synthesis of microporous, materials based on <b>automatic</b> <b>dispensing</b> of reagents into autoclave blocks followed by synthesis, isolation and automated structure analysis with X-ray diffractometry. The method {{is characterized by}} low reagent consumption and efficient sample recovery. The syntheses of the aluminophosphate phases using the above combinatorial strategies are described. The aluminophosphate study discusses the influence of combined organometallic and organic structure directing agents on the resulting phases (e. g., AFI, AEL and AST structure types), based on the different size and flexibility of the templating agents. Furthermore, {{the effects of the}} concentration of single templates, Al sources, and different templates as well as mixed template system on the crystallization of aluminophosphates are examined. In part II, we present novel strategies to prepare organic monolayers on hydride-terminated Ge(100) surfaces utilizing the available Ge–H bonds as chemical handles. The new hydride-terminated Ge(100) surface was prepared by utilizing an efficient preparation method involving soaking in an aqueous 10 % HF solution. Lewis acid mediated hydrogermylation of alkynes and alkenes on the hydride-terminated Ge(100) surfaces results in alkenyl and alkyl surfaces, respectively, bound through Ge–C bonds. Thermal treatment of hydride terminated Ge surface with neat alkenes and alkynes, or solutions in mesitylene, also results in similar organic monolayers. Finally, these two approaches were contrasted with UV photoinduced hydrogermylation of alkenes. The resulting organic monolayers were characterized by infra-red spectroscopy (ATR-FTIR), stability studies, and contact angle measurements. ...|$|R

To minimize risks of radiation the production is fully automated in specially designed laboratories. On the other hand to minimize the microbiological and pyrogenic contamination during the production, all production steps should be carried out in clean areas entry to which should be through airlocks for personnel, equipment and materials. The production of 18 F-FDG should be carried out under negative pressure surrounded by a positive pressure zone ensuring that appropriate air quality requirements are met according EN ISO 14644 - 1 Due to this requirements our laboratory is specially designed to ensure fully automated and safe production of 18 F-FDG, taking care of radiation protection and sterility.

40|$|The Health Hazard Evaluation (HHE) Program {{received}} {{a request from}} a mail order pharmacy. Employees were concerned about possible health effects from exposures to hazardous drugs and pharmaceutical dust, and communication and other workplace safety climate issues. Roughly 175 employees worked at the pharmacy; the majority of whom were contractors performing most production functions (e. g., filling, labeling, packaging, and housekeeping). On average, the mail order pharmacy filled approximately 74, 000 prescriptions per day using automated and manual distribution systems. HHE Program investigators evaluated the pharmacy in August 2012. We surveyed employees and talked with them about job stress, work-related health concerns, and perceptions of the job and social factors at work. We sampled air and work surfaces for lactose (inactive ingredient in pharmaceuticals) and active pharmaceutical ingredients. Overall, employees had a positive perception of safety climate. However, contractor employees were not comfortable taking time off work when ill and they reported more eye, nose, throat, and skin irritation and cough associated with work than company employees. Some employees were concerned about repetitive tasks and prolonged standing. No employees reported changes in their health consistent with exposures to hazardous drugs. However, air sampling results indicated that employees who clean or repair <b>automatic</b> <b>dispensing</b> machine cells, refill <b>automatic</b> <b>dispensing</b> machine canisters, clean manually-fed automated counters with canned air, and hand-fill hazardous drug prescriptions may be exposed to airborne dust from uncoated tablets. Inhalation exposures to active pharmaceutical ingredients were mostly below manufacturers' occupational exposure limits (if a limit was available). However, an employee who cleaned and repaired Baker machine cells was exposed to airborne Lisinopril, an antihypertension medication, above the exposure limit. Some employees were exposed to multiple active pharmaceutical ingredients, the effects of which are not well understood. The surface sampling results and our observations also indicate the potential for personal clothing contamination with active pharmaceutical ingredients {{and the potential for}} take home exposure. Employees were provided vinyl gloves but no other protective clothing. Employees demonstrated good housekeeping and hand-washing practices. To address areas of concern identified in the survey and employee interviews, HHE Program investigators recommended the employer (1) create a health and safety committee, (2) stop the punitive "point system" for discouraging absences, and (3) provide seats at workstations. To address the potential for exposures to pharmaceutical dust, HHE Program investigators recommended the employer (1) substitute uncoated tablets with coated tablets when that option is available, (2) create a list of pharmaceuticals that are dusty and use this information to determine how to handle these pharmaceuticals, (3) use local exhaust ventilation hoods that are ducted outdoors for filling hazardous drug prescriptions and other tasks that could create pharmaceutical dust, (4) require employees to wear nitrile gloves as these are better suited than vinyl gloves for pharmaceutical dust and the isopropyl alcohol used to clean surfaces and equipment, and (5) provide safety glasses and long-sleeve protective clothing to employees who hand fill hazardous drug prescriptions or create pharmaceutical dust.

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} the fabrication, characterisation and validation of two novel immunosensors {{for the detection}} of the inflammation markers nerve growth factor-β (NGF) and psoriasin (S 100 -A 7). The initial phase of sensor construction involves the electrodeposition of polyaniline onto commercial screen-printed carbon electrodes. A classical avidin-biotin link was then used to immobilise biotinylated antibodies. Fully fabricated immunosensors were incubated with their target antigen and interrogated with AC impedance to observe the change in real (Z‘) impedance (Ohms) with respect to antigen exposure. The Z‘ impedance was found to increase over physiologically significant concentration ranges of the target antigen. The effects of non-specific antigen binding were accounted for via controls using a non-specific antigen analogue for each immunosensor. The sensors reported here, after optimisation of the fabrication procedure using the BioDot AD 3200 <b>automatic</b> <b>dispensing</b> system, are capable of detecting the presence and concentration of target antigen in a commercial sample within 35 minutes with a lower limit of detection (LLD) (a response observed that is {{more than three times the}} standard deviation of the immunosensors baseline impedance measurement) of 50 pg ml- 1 for NGF and 250 pg ml- 1 for psoriasin. An evaluation is also presented of the competitive advantage gained by companies such as Unilever by undertaking research projects in conjunction with universities and forming other such strategic networks. As part of this EngD project, a review paper concerning antibody based sensors in the past decade was written and is now submitted ready for publishing in the peer reviewed journal 'Biosensors and Bioelectronics‘.

Industrially sourced projects at the pre-University stage are referred to but {{the main thrust of}} this paper is directed at experiences with the third year design course in a four year Mechanical Engineering BEng programme. The aim of the paper is to provide an awareness of the characteristics of the project work arising from industrially sourced project work. These projects are a useful addition to the set piece projects which are focused on the formal course content. The challenges and experiences encountered in supervising industrially sourced projects presented here will be of value to course lecturers who are working in this exciting area and will also point the way to those seeking involvement in this type of project. Project realisation was reported in DATER 94 and here project realism is presented as an additional important component in stimulating the interest and enthusiasm of the students. Pre-existing staff contact with industry, e. g. arising from consultancy, is of benefit if this type of venture is to be successful.

40|$|Objective: <b>Automatic</b> drug <b>dispensing</b> systems (ADS) allow patient-specific, unit-dose {{packaging}} of medication. They {{claim to}} provide cheaper, {{more efficient and}} safer drug management (1). However, {{little is known about}} health care providers’ (HCPs) expectations or the perceived problems when introducing ADS in a non-hospital environment. Therefore, we studied HCPs views regarding ADS introduction in a Belgian nursing home. Methods: Structured interviews between September and December 2009, before and after the introduction of ADS. Interviewees included dispensing pharmacist, nurses, nursing home management and coordinating physician. Interviews were audio-recorded, verbatim transcribed and qualitatively analyzed using a framework analysis approach. Results: Nine interviews before, and 8 after ADS introduction were conducted. Information: in the first round, most nurses mentioned a lack of information on ADS, contrary to the pharmacist, coordinating physician and head nurse. This difference was resolved only after introduction of ADS. Time management: most people expected to spend less time in medication management after introduction of ADS, except the pharmacist. After introduction, HCPs reported to need extra time for distribution and administration {{due to the fact that}} not all medication is distributable by ADS, and hence required a combination of old and new system. Also administrative issues required more time. Medication errors: new errors arose, due to non-familiarity with the new IT system, and problems with the number and labeling of pouches. Also unexpected discontinuation of therapy caused problems. On the other hand, all participants felt more secure about medication management. User-friendliness: the new medication pouches were deemed more hygienic and easier for administration than the old distribution system. The pouches, however, were more space-consuming and thus difficult to manage. Conclusion: This analysis shows that health care providers have high expectations on the introduction of ADS, but that new problems can arise that have to be expected and handled appropriately. status: publishe...|$|R

Gaining sophisticated knowledge about the statistical process of adhesive bonding advances the quality of related production steps like beam-shaping optics, mounting of turning mirrors for fiber coupling or building resonators evaluating power, mode characteristics and beam shape. Maximizing the precision of these single assembly steps fosters the scope of improving the overall efficiency of the entire laser system. At Fraunhofer IPT research activities on the identification of relevant parameters for improved adhesive bonding precision have been undertaken and are ongoing. The influence of the volumetric repeatability of different <b>automatic</b> and manual <b>dispensing</b> methods play an important role. Also, the evaluation of UV-light sources and the relating illumination properties have a significant influence on the bonding result. Furthermore, common UV-curing adhesives are being examined on their performance and reliability for both highest precision prototyping, as well as their application as robust bonding medium in automated optics assembly cells. This paper sums up the parameters of most influence. Overall goal of these activities is the development of a prediction model for optimized shrinkage compensation and thus improved assembly quality...|$|R
40|$|Solid-state {{lighting}} (SSL) using {{light-emitting diode}} (LED) {{as an alternative}} light source is an emerging technology. Compared with conventional light sources, LEDs have superior characteristics such as low energy consumption, long operation life, no toxic ingredient, and fast response time. Industrial emphasis {{has been placed on}} high power LEDs which are most likely to compete with conventional light sources. As the emerging illumination applications require white LEDs to provide higher performance while reducing cost to an acceptable range for consumers, therefore, low cost and high throughput manufacturing processes for LEDs are in urgent demand. The objective of this thesis is to introduce a low cost and high throughput method for the automation of LED mass production. Phosphor converted LEDs (pc-LEDs), which employ blue LEDs with yellow phosphor deposition to generate white light illumination is a widely used solid-state lighting source. This paper presents the integration of two major processes, namely, phosphor screen printing and moldless encapsulant dispensing, for wafer level pc-LED packaging. In the present study, the processing procedures and parameters of phosphor screen printing were developed and investigated in detail. The attributes of the phosphor layer by screen printing such as packing density, thickness, uniformity and adhesive strength, which control the performance of final white light illumination, were characterized. The results of the proposed screen-printing method in terms of packing density and thickness uniformity of yellow phosphor layer are comparable to those of settling and EPD methods. Subsequently a moldless encapsulant dispensing process was applied at the wafer level. Silicone is selected as encapsulant material for its long term optical stability in elevated temperature. The processing procedures and parameters of the <b>automatic</b> moldless encapsulant <b>dispensing</b> were also investigated. The geometry characterization of the silicone encapsulation dome demonstrated a good control over the dome shape with the double-line microgrooves. Optical performance of the packaged LEDs was evaluated. The chromaticity of the generated white light is close to the ideal white light. Meanwhile, a good uniformity in the color distribution was observed. The prototype of 4 x 4 and 5 x 5 white light LED arrays demonstrated that a LED wafer level packaging can be achieved with the integration of the two novel processes...|$|R
