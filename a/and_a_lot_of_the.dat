25|$|The initial {{attempts}} at evacuation while {{the war was}} still {{in its early stages}} through early 1942 were {{a far cry from the}} organised affair that the Soviet central bureaucracy envisaged. Throughout the summer and fall of 1941, numerous Soviet frontier cities evacuated in a haphazard and panicked fashion before the German onslaught. A number of factors led to this lack of organisation. For one, the Soviet evacuation plans were thrown together fairly hurriedly, <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> logistical planning was done on the fly as the German advance was already sweeping through the Soviet border zone. The German invasion also hampered the effectiveness of the Soviet response by shattering their communications in the war's early stages; many Soviet leaders were unable to gather reliable information about the positions of German forces until it was too late to effect an orderly evacuation.|$|E
25|$|Well, it's {{not really}} a choice at all. It's just, you know, I started playing very young and from early on, the people I was {{listening}} to had some element of finger style. Probably the first guitarist I was emulating was Scotty Moore, when I was maybe 6 or 7. And he played with a pick, but he also used fingers. <b>And</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> session players, like Chet Atkins, they played with fingers or a pick. Then I listened to {{a certain amount of}} light classical guitar playing. And of course later on, when the first wave of rock 'n' roll kind of fell away, folk music was very popular and very influential in my style. So it was really less of a choice than what I fell into. I use a pick occasionally. I certainly use it more in the studio when {{you want to get a}} certain tone. But it's just the way I came up. I wasn't taught. I just sort of figured things out on my own terms. I guess that was one of the ways that I became comfortable and it just kind of set in.|$|E

This was the second accident involving the class; in October 2012 an Oracle Team USA AC72 also capsized in San Francisco Bay during training, causing substantial damage but no serious injuries. Christopher Clarey, writing in The New York Times, described the class as [...] "high-speed and high-risk." [...] Stephen Park, who heads the British Olympic sailing team, commented: [...] "they're very high powered and the loads on them are huge... these boats are untrodden waters for sailing. A lot of the loads <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> equipment is new {{and there are a lot}} of unknowns and things being tested."

500|$|... "In the Name of the Grandfather" [...] was {{the first}} episode written by Matt Marshall who had {{previously}} worked on the show as a writers' assistant. In 2007, he pitched the idea of Grampa being neglected and the Simpsons taking him to Ireland. The script {{was ready for a}} table read in late 2007, but the Writers Guild of America strike delayed work on the episode. Executive producer Al Jean said the episode is intended to be [...] "an affectionate love letter to Ireland" [...] because many of the writers have Irish roots. He added, [...] "The episode is based on the experiences of myself <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> writers on The Simpsons who have Irish ancestry and come back to visit to find it very different, much more hi-tech." [...] According to James L. Brooks, the story was also inspired by a New York Times article about the effects of the smoking ban in Ireland on pubs.|$|E

[...] Although Waters and Gilmour have on occasion downplayed his contribution to the {{success of the}} album, Mason has praised his role. [...] In 2003, Parsons reflected: [...] "I think they all felt that I managed to hang the rest of my career on Dark Side of the Moon, which has an element of truth to it.

500|$|The A.V. Clubs Nathan Rabin {{called this}} episode [...] "clumsy and tired", {{explaining}} it was [...] "misfiring on all cylinders. The satire was toothless, the playing strained {{and the whole}} enterprise reeked of mild desperation." [...] He continued in his recap that [...] "Let's Stay Together" [...] had a [...] "golden opportunity to comment insightfully and hilariously about the tricky intersection of politics, power, race and privilege", however [...] "it recycled jokes that were unfunny and overly familiar the first time around". In conclusion, Rabin gave it a C grade rating. Brad Sanders of the Indiana Daily Student opined that the show's writing [...] "is still sharp– not 'as sharp as ever,' but sharp– {{but a lot of}} the most interesting plots have already played out, <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> new plots aren't interesting." [...] Sanders said that the stories featured here had [...] "a few big laughs... but they're assembled so haphazardly and put into such a bulky framework that the train just never gets enough steam to salvage the episode." ...|$|E

500|$|The idea of {{the film}} {{initially}} came to Jonze in the early 2000s when he read an article online that mentioned a website where a user could instant message with an artificial intelligence. [...] "For the first, maybe, 20 seconds of it, it had this real buzz," [...] said Jonze. [...] "I'd say 'Hey, hello,' and it would say 'Hey, how are you?', {{and it was like}} whoa [...] this is trippy. After 20 seconds, it quickly fell apart and you realized how it actually works, and it wasn't that impressive. But it was still, for 20 seconds, really exciting. The more people that talked to it, the smarter it got." [...] Jonze's interest in the project was renewed after directing the short film I'm Here (2010), which shares similar themes. Inspiration also came from Kaufman's writing approach for Synecdoche, New York (2008). Jonze explained, [...] " [...] said he wanted to try to write everything he was thinking about in that moment – all the ideas and feelings at that time – and put it into the script.

I've been to the Holocaust Museum. I've seen the footage of General Eisenhower touring one of the camps. They're [...] nutty as loons if they don't think it happened". The newspaper had intended to interview Gravel about the National Initiative. Gravel later recounted the background to the event:"He [...] liked the idea of the National Initiative. I figured it was an opportunity to discuss it. Whether it is the far right, far left, whatever, I'll make my pitch to them. They gave me a free subscription to American Free Press. They still send it to me today. I flip through it sometimes. It has some extreme views, <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ads in it are even more extreme and make me want to upchuck. Anyways, sometime later, Carto contacted me to speak at that Barnes Review Conference. I had never heard of the Barnes Review, didn't know anything about it or what they stood for. I was just coming to give a presentation about the National Initiative. I was there maybe 30 minutes. I could tell from the people in the room (mainly some very old men) that they were pretty extreme. I gave my speech, answered some questions and left.
