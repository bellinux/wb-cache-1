5|$|Within {{months of}} his leaving the premiership Chamberlain's health began to fail; he {{resigned}} from the cabinet, and died after a short illness in November 1940. Dunglass had volunteered for active military service, seeking to rejoin the Lanarkshire Yeomanry shortly after Chamberlain left Downing Street. The consequent medical examination revealed that Dunglass had <b>a</b> <b>hole</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> spine surrounded by tuberculosis in the bone. Without surgery {{he would have been}} unable to walk within a matter of months. An innovative and hazardous operation was performed in September 1940, lasting six hours, in which the diseased bone in the spine was scraped away and replaced with healthy bone from the patient's shin.|$|E
5|$|Upon her joining, {{however, the}} members of the group are {{targeted}} and murdered one by one. All of their deaths relate to their fears: Mark falls down an elevator shaft, trying to escape from the darkness when the lights go out, and is torn in half. Paul accidentally consumes a cockroach while eating a bag of chips; he is given cleaning solution by a masked figure, and upon drinking it, burns <b>a</b> <b>hole</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> throat. Laura begins to suspect these deaths are not accidental. The hospital loses power, leaving Laura, Alison, Darren, Nicky, Dr. Jessica Ryan, and the receptionist Gloria in the dark. Gloria goes to the basement to turn the lights back on, but once the patients return to their rooms, Alison is tied to her bed by the Boogeyman. He places maggots on her arms, which burrow into her skin via her self-inflicted incisions, and she kills herself attempting to cut them out.|$|E
5|$|During Edward II's reign (1307–1327) {{there was}} {{relatively}} little {{activity at the}} Tower of London. However, {{it was during this}} period that the Privy Wardrobe was founded. The institution was based at the Tower and responsible for organising the state's arms. In 1321, Margaret de Clare, Baroness Badlesmere became the first woman imprisoned in the Tower of London after she refused Queen Isabella admittance to Leeds Castle and ordered her archers to fire upon Isabella, killing six of the royal escort. Generally reserved for high-ranking inmates, the Tower was the most important royal prison in the country. However it was not necessarily very secure, and throughout its history people bribed the guards to help them escape. In 1322 Roger Mortimer, 1st Earl of March, was aided in his escape from the Tower by the Sub-Lieutenant of the Tower who let Mortimer's men inside. They hacked <b>a</b> <b>hole</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> cell wall and Mortimer escaped to a waiting boat. He fled to France where he encountered Edward's Queen. They began an affair and plotted to overthrow the King. One of Mortimer's first acts on entering England was to capture the Tower and release the prisoners held there. For three years he ruled while EdwardIII was too young to do so himself; in 1330, Edward and his supporters captured Mortimer and threw him in the Tower. Under EdwardIII's rule (1312–1377) England experienced renewed success in warfare after his father's reign had put the realm on the backfoot against the Scots and French. Amongst Edward's successes were the battles of Crécy and Poitiers where King John II of France was taken prisoner, and the capture of the King David II of Scotland at Neville's Cross. During this period, the Tower of London held many noble prisoners of war. EdwardII had allowed the Tower of London to fall into a state of disrepair, and by the reign of EdwardIII the castle was an uncomfortable place. The nobility held captive within its walls were unable to engage in activities such as hunting which were permissible at other royal castles used as prisons, for instance Windsor. EdwardIII ordered that the castle should be renovated.|$|E

5|$|While {{some parts}} of the book were inventions, she also made use of real-life incidents. The opening chapter of The Danger Tree {{describes}} the accidental death of the young son of Sir Desmond and Lady Hooper. The incident was based on fact: Sir Walter and Lady Amy Smart's eight-year-old boy was killed when he picked up a stick bomb while on a desert picnic in January 1943. Just as described in the novel, his grief-stricken parents had tried to feed the dead boy through <b>a</b> <b>hole</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> cheek. Manning had long been resentful at the Smarts' failure to include her and Reggie in their artistic circle in Cairo. However, the scene was considered in poor taste even by Manning's friends, who were also outraged that the quiet and faithful Lady Smart was associated with Manning's very different Lady Hooper. Though both Sir Walter and his wife had died by the time of publication, Manning's publisher received a solicitor's letter written on behalf of the Smart family, objecting to the scene and requiring {{that there should be no}} further reference to the incident or to the couple in future volumes. Manning ignored both requests. She based the character of Aidan Pratt on the actor, writer and poet Stephen Haggard, whom she had known in Jerusalem. Like Pratt, Haggard committed suicide on a train from Cairo to Palestine, but in Haggard's case it followed the end of a relationship with a beautiful Egyptian woman, rather than unrequited homosexual love. After years of complaints about her publisher Heinemann, Manning moved to Weidenfeld & Nicolson, and remained with them until the end of her life. The Danger Tree was a considerable critical success, and though Manning was disappointed yet again that her novel was not shortlisted for the Booker prize, the Yorkshire Post selected it as their Best Novel of 1977. This award followed her 1976 appointment to the Order of the British Empire.|$|E
25|$|The simple shapes {{made by the}} {{tinsmith}} require tools {{similar to}} a coppersmith. In addition to the big shears anchored in <b>a</b> <b>hole</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> bench he used hand snips and nippers for cutting. The tin was flattened on an anvil made of a block of steel. Straight and curved anvils (stakes) were used to turn and roll {{the edges of the}} tin. Solder was then used to join the pieces together; a soldering iron and fire pot were needed to do this.|$|E
25|$|Smaug was {{the last}} named dragon of Middle-earth. He was slain by Bard, a {{descendant}} of Girion, Lord of Dale. A deadly winged fire-breathing dragon, he was described as red-gold in colour and his underbelly was encrusted with many gemstones from the treasure-pile he commonly slept upon once he had taken control of Erebor (the Lonely Mountain). The Arkenstone was buried right in the pile he slept on, but Smaug never noticed it. Smaug had only a single weakness: there was <b>a</b> <b>hole</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> jewel encrusted underbelly on his left breast area. Bilbo Baggins discovered this, which led to Smaug's death above Esgaroth.|$|E

25|$|On 29 July 2005, Norwegian Major General Bjørn Egge gave an {{interview}} to the newspaper Aftenposten on the events surrounding Hammarskjöld's death. According to General Egge, {{who had been the}} first UN officer to see the body, Hammarskjöld had <b>a</b> <b>hole</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> forehead, and this hole was subsequently airbrushed from photos taken of the body. It appeared to Egge that Hammarskjöld had been thrown from the plane, and grass and leaves in his hands might indicate that he survived the crash – and that he had tried to scramble away from the wreckage. Egge does not claim directly that the wound was a gunshot wound.|$|E
25|$|By 1976, Ike Turner's {{addiction}} to cocaine {{was so strong}} that he had burned <b>a</b> <b>hole</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> nasal septum, leading to nosebleeds, from which he would relieve himself by using more cocaine. During this time, Ike was spending more time at Bolic Sound than he was with Tina and their children at their home in Inglewood. Tina Turner, meanwhile, had looked inward to alleviate her own problems and soon found solace after a friend introduced her to the teachings of Buddhism. In July 1976, Ike intended on signing a five-year contract with a new record company, Cream Records, for a reported yearly amount of $150,000. The contract had a key person clause, meaning Ike would have to sign the contract in four days, keeping Tina tied to Ike for five more years.|$|E
25|$|On December 15, 2014, it was {{announced}} that Vickers would miss part of the 2015 season due to health issues. Vickers said that his body had been rejecting an artificial patch which had been inserted in 2010 to fix <b>a</b> <b>hole</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> heart. He had corrective surgery in December to repair the hole that was a success, and said that he would need time for rest and rehabilitation. Vickers implied in January that he only would miss a few races. On January 21, 2015, it {{was announced}} that Vickers had been medically cleared to return to racing in March, with his season debut expected at Las Vegas Motor Speedway on March 8. It was also announced that NASCAR had granted him a waiver to make him eligible for the Chase for the Sprint Cup championship should he qualify.|$|E

25|$|Vickers {{will miss}} the first two races of the 2015 season after {{off-season}} surgery to repair a patch placed over <b>a</b> <b>hole</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> heart. Vickers Team owner and race driver Michael Waltrip will race the Daytona 500, while Brett Moffitt raced the No. 55 for the Folds of Honor QuikTrip 500. Vickers returned for two races before he was sidelined again just before Fontana. Moffitt was named the interim driver and later declared his candidacy for Rookie of the Year. On April 24, {{it was announced that}} David Ragan would take over the No. 55 beginning at Kansas. Ragan had several strong runs in the 55, with potential top 10 finishes at Sonoma, Bristol, Watkins Glen, Martinsville, and Charlotte, but fell victim to bad racing luck, with crashes or mechanical failures in many events. He was ultimately released and left for BK Racing when MWR closed its doors.|$|E
25|$|Ian Johnson won the toss in {{the sweltering}} 100°F/38°C heat and chose to bat {{on the best}} surface seen since Brisbane. Again nine Australian batsmen got into double figures, Colin McDonald (48) and Arthur Morris (25) added 59 for the first wicket, and Keith Miller made 44. Hutton made himself unpopular with his {{deliberately}} slow over rates {{so that he could}} rest his exhausted fast bowlers, and Brian Statham ripped the nail off his right big toe and had to hack <b>a</b> <b>hole</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> boot so he could continue to bowl. It was Bob Appleyard (3/58) who made the breakthrough, dismissing MacDonald, Miller and Benaud, with Tyson (3/85) and Bailey (3/39) in support as Australia fell to 229/8. Len Maddocks (69) justified his selection and was the only man to pass fifty, adding 92 for the ninth wicket with Ian Johnson (41) until Bailey removed the captain. Maddocks was run out two runs later and Australia were dismissed for 323 on the afternoon of the second day.|$|E
500|$|Suter {{played only}} one {{game for the}} Sharks in the 1998–99 season, missing {{virtually}} the entire campaign after a microbe in his triceps caused an infection that required three surgeries to alleviate. [...] During treatment, doctors also discovered <b>a</b> <b>hole</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> heart that required another surgery to correct. At 35 years old, Suter said he never contemplated retirement due to the ailments as he wanted to repay the Sharks for their support of him. He agreed to defer {{a portion of his}} salary that year to allow San Jose to sign a replacement player. Suter returned for the 1999–2000 season healthy and played over 20 minutes per game as San Jose's most experienced defenseman.|$|E

500|$|Heyward {{still has}} <b>a</b> <b>hole</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> swing {{that has yet}} to resolve. [...] While he was in the minor leagues, his unorthodox swing was not {{regarded}} as a significant issue, but rather was perceived to have worked for him because of his enormous talent. [...] To the contrary, one scout compared it to an awkward golf swing. [...] "You watch him, he really stiff-arms the bat out there", noting Heyward almost fully extends his arms to attempt to power the head of the bat through the strike zone. [...] He does not protect the inside of part of the strike zone as well as the outside. [...] That creates a weakness that allows pitchers – especially power pitchers – to throw inside, thus exploiting an inability to attain contact on inside pitches efficiently.|$|E
500|$|Salih {{was among}} those {{tortured}} by Mansur. Moreover, Salih was forced to divorce his wife and cousin Tarud, who was famed for her beauty, so that Mansur could wed her. Zakkar writes {{that it is not}} known whether this was meant to humiliate Salih, [...] "an energetic and bold" [...] emir, or to establish marital ties with other elements of the Kilab. Mansur frequently threatened to execute Salih, who upon being informed of these threats, escaped the citadel. According to the versions of medieval chroniclers, Salih managed to cut one of his shackles and make <b>a</b> <b>hole</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> cell wall. Then, on the night of 3 July 1014, he jumped from the wall of the citadel with one shackle still attached to his leg and hid in a drain pipe {{for the remainder of the}} night until re-joining his tribesmen at their encampment in Marj Dabiq. Zakkar questions the truth of this story, and asserts it was more likely that Salih escaped either through bribery or a friendly arrangement with a guard.|$|E
500|$|The Anasazi ruins were {{constructed}} in Anza-Borrego Desert State Park. Location manager Mac Gordon later noted that, {{due to the}} presence of a rare [...] "spiny black horned toad" [...] in the area, he and his crew were forced to hire several biologists to locate any lizards in the area and move them elsewhere. In addition, Gordon had a difficult time persuading the park rangers to build and then blow up faux-ruins. He explained, [...] "we were on a state park property that was an off road park, with motorcycles and [...] flying all over the place, but they still blanched when I said we have to build Indian ruins and then blow it up." [...] However, the cameo of The Smoking Man was filmed on a sound stage back at 20th Century Fox. Manners noted that Davis had [...] "a hell of a time" [...] trying to smoke his cigarettes through <b>a</b> <b>hole</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> neck, because the hole was fake. The scene featuring The Smoking Man being burnt up by the fire from a missile was done via computer animation. The missiles were created via CGI technology by animator Mat Beck. The helicopter, however, included real smoke bombs. A shot of William B. Davis was overlapped with fire, and eventually a skull to give the effect that The Smoking Man's flesh was burnt away. Paul Rabwin later called the scene a [...] "great sequence".|$|E

500|$|In season five, Mary Alice {{appears in}} {{multiple}} flashbacks in [...] "The Best Thing That Ever Could Have Happened", including when handyman Eli Scruggs (Beau Bridges) was first starting out and approached Mary Alice on the street, asking {{her if she}} had any work for him. After initially declining, she notices <b>a</b> <b>hole</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> shoe and says she has a broken vase that he can glue back together for her. Years later, on the day Mary Alice committed suicide, Eli was at her house dropping something off. He asks if she is alright, to which she says she is, and just as he is about to leave she picks up the vase he glued for her and says she wants him to have it. Eli asks again if she is alright, and she politely asks him to leave. Later that day, after Mary Alice had shot herself, Eli watches police cars and neighbors gossiping from afar, regretting that he did nothing to save her. He then makes a vow to God to not only fix people's belongings but their lives as much as he can as well. In season six, Mary Alice again appears in a flashback in [...] "Epiphany", when she notices four-year-old Eddie Orlofsky (Davin Ransom) witnessing his father leave their family. Mary Alice continues to check on Eddie and his mother Barbara (Diane Farr), bringing them a hot meal and later to bring a teddy bear for Eddie, where she finds the young child left home alone. Mary Alice finds Barbara in a bar, brings her home and scolds her for her poor parenting skills.|$|E
