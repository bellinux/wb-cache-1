Critically, it was better received than her 1980s work and seemed to signal a move closer to her acoustic beginnings, along with some references to the style of Hejira. This album was also Mitchell's first since Geffen Records was sold to MCA Inc., meaning that Night Ride Home was her first album not to be initially distributed by WEA (now Warner Music Group).|$|E

Accordingly we argue that every BPN is a `unique' object in its appearance, but all can be explained within the binary model paradigm. Therefore, we request a stop to the attaching of adjectives such as `unique', `peculiar', and `unusual' to BPNe and proto-BPNe, thereby removing the need to invoke a new model for almost every `unusual' BPN. As a case study we try to build a binary model for the proto-BPN OH 231. 8 + 4. 2.
