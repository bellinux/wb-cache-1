40|$|Serum from {{a patient}} (CO) with acute lymphoblastic leukemia was {{reactive}} in immunoadherence assays with autologous leukemia cells but not with autologous blood lymphocytes or bone marrow cells during complete remission. Extensive <b>absorption</b> <b>tests</b> {{with an array of}} leukemia cells and normal cells were performed in order to define the specificity of the reaction. The autologous leukemia reactivity was either completely or partially absorbed with acute lymphoblastic leukemia cells obtained from 10 of 14 patients but not with acute nonlymphoblastic leukemia cells or normal hematopoietic cells. Some cultured lymphocytic leukemia lines also showed expression of the antigen. The absence of alloantibodies in CO's serum detectable in our assay allowed direct testing of CO's serum on allogeneic target cells. The results of these tests correlated with the results of <b>absorption</b> <b>tests,</b> indicating that small populations of antigen-positive cells were not missed with <b>absorption</b> <b>tests.</b> In addition, <b>absorption</b> <b>tests</b> with CO-positive allogeneic leukemia target cells showed the same pattern of antigen distribution as tests with autologous targets.

40|$|Sera from {{a survey}} of 6, 026 people were tested for {{hepatitis}} B surface antigen by using radioimmunoassay and counterelectrophoresis. Forty-eight sera (0. 79 %) were positive by counterelectrophoresis and 152 sera (2. 52 %) were positive by radioimmunoassay, using the most liberal of the recommended criteria for positivity (i. e., counts 3 standard deviations above the mean). <b>Absorption</b> <b>tests</b> performed on the 152 radioimmunoassay-positive sera showed that 10 (6. 6 %) were false-positive reactions to guinea pig protein, 74 (48. 6 %) were due to false-positive reaction(s) with other protein(s) in the test system, and 68 (44. 8 %) were true positives. There was {{a strong correlation between}} the degree of elevation of radioactive counts and the proportions of sera that were true positives; all 49 sera with counts > 50 standard deviation units above the mean were true positives, but only 19 (18. 4 %) of the 103 sera with counts < 50 standard deviation units were true positives. A few sera with high counts required absorption with type-specific (type D) antisera. The following conclusions were reached from this study: (i) <b>absorption</b> <b>tests</b> should be run on all radioimmunoassay-positive, counterelectrophoresis-negative sera; (ii) most (about 90 %) false positives are not due to anti-guinea-pig protein reactions; and (iii) radioimmunoassay, in combination with <b>absorption</b> <b>tests,</b> yields a modest increase (about 35 %) in detection of true positives over use of counterelectrophoresis alone...|$|R

40|$|The {{efficiency}} of polyfunctional monomers as cross-linking co-agents on the chemical properties of natural rubber vulcanized by electron beam irradiation was studied.

40|$|Concrete {{durability}} can {{be evaluated}} {{by a number}} of properties - such as water absorption and chloride diffusion. Each of these properties can be measured using Standardized methods. Water absorption can be linked to porosity and therefore to eventual deterioration. <b>Tests</b> based on <b>absorption</b> have the potential to be simple and rapid tests for placed concrete. However, it is impossible to provide the Standard conditions for in-situ measurements. Water absorption is strongly affected by environmental temperature and concrete moisture content. These different conditions may cause incorrect evaluation of concrete performance. In this thesis, several samples were taken from three different construction projects in the Montréal region. These samples were taken to the laboratory, conditioned in different relative humidity and temperature environments and later water <b>absorption</b> <b>tests</b> were performed on them to investigate the effect of these two factors. In addition, three samples of each concrete mixture were placed outdoors and were tested in different environmental situations. Lastly, in-situ water <b>absorption</b> <b>tests</b> were performed on real concrete elements for one of the projects in actual field conditions. It was found that the concrete water absorption rate increases linearly with increasing temperature and decreasing moisture content. In addition, surface relative humidity was found as an accurate and practical indicator of concrete moisture content. These relationships were verified by additional exposed and in-situ measurements. It is suggested to perform several water <b>absorption</b> <b>tests</b> along with temperature and concrete surface relative humidity measurements to arrive at a Standardized value for quality control purposes. ...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{details the}} {{performance}} of the reverberation chamber of the Integrated Acoustics Laboratory (IAL), equipped with experimental lightweight diffusers. Reverberation chambers are generally equipped with dense baffles, called diffusers, which are designed to reflect but not absorb sound, in an effort to create a sound field in the chamber with uniform energy density. Industry standards, such as ASTM C 423, ISO 354, and ISO 3741 for sound absorption and sound power testing in reverberation chambers, recommend the use of stationary and rotating diffusers, made of a material with high surface density and low absorption. Instead, lightweight fiberglass diffuser panels were installed in the IAL reverberation chamber because they are safer, less expensive and more flexible; their performance in the IAL chamber was evaluated. Preliminary testing of the IAL instrumentation chain and analysis techniques documented their acceptable performance. Qualification testing per the abovementioned standards proved that the IAL chamber, equipped with stationary lightweight diffusers, was fit for testing sound power but not sound absorption. However, when equipped with a combination of stationary and rotating lightweight diffusers, the chamber qualified for sound <b>absorption</b> <b>tests.</b> Optimization of <b>absorption</b> <b>testing</b> methodology showed that specimen area did not significantly affect the measured sound absorption coefficient unless the specimen was highly absorptive or the area was significantly less than the recommended 6. 69 m 2. Also, increasing the empty room absorption of the acoustically hard IAL chamber did not improve the reproducibility of absorption measurements. With regard to length of <b>test,</b> <b>absorption</b> <b>tests</b> in the IAL chamber should include the measurement of 225 decays to attain the representative repeatability values of ASTM C 423 for frequencies 315 Hz and higher. Comparative <b>absorption</b> <b>testing</b> showed that the chamber reproduced sound absorption results well; when round robin testing was replicated in the chamber, results were not statistically different from other laboratories. However, the reproducibility was worse for highly absorptive specimens. Sound power testing produced highly reproducible results, well within the limits of reproducibility of the standard. It can be concluded that a combination of stationary and rotating lightweight diffusers made the IAL chamber fit for sound absorption and sound power testing. M. S.

40|$|The {{functional}} {{integrity of}} the small bowel is impaired in coeliac disease. Intestinal permeability, {{as measured by the}} sugar <b>absorption</b> <b>test</b> probably reflects this phenomenon. In the sugar <b>absorption</b> <b>test</b> a solution of lactulose and mannitol was given to the fasting patient and the lactulose/mannitol ratio measured in urine collected over a period of five hours. The sugar <b>absorption</b> <b>test</b> was performed in nine patients with coeliac disease with an abnormal jejunum on histological examination, 10 relatives of patients with coeliac disease with aspecific symptoms but no villous atrophy, six patients with aspecific gastrointestinal symptoms but no villous atrophy, and 22 healthy controls to determine whether functional integrity is different in these groups. The lactulose/mannitol ratio (mean (SEM) is significantly higher in both coeliac disease (0. 243 (0. 034), p < 0. 0001)) and relatives of patients with coeliac disease (0. 158 (0. 040), p < 0. 005)) v both healthy controls (0. 043 (0. 006)) and patients with aspecific gastrointestinal symptoms (0. 040 (0. 011)). The lactulose/mannitol ratio in relatives of coeliac disease patients was significantly lower than in the coeliac disease patient group (p = 0. 04). The lactulose/mannitol ratio was the same in healthy controls and patients with aspecific gastrointestinal symptoms. It is concluded that the sugar <b>absorption</b> <b>test</b> is a sensitive test that distinguishes between patients with coeliac disease and healthy controls. The explanation for the increased permeability in relatives of patients with coeliac disease is uncertain. Increased intestinal permeability may be related to constitutional factors in people susceptible to coeliac disease and may detect latent coeliac disease. The sugar <b>absorption</b> <b>test</b> may therefore be helpful in family studies of coeliac disease...|$|E

Serum antibody could be specifically absorbed with allantoic fluid containing influenza virus or, more effectively, with concentrated suspensions of virus obtained from allantoic fluid by high-speed centrifugation or by the red cell adsorption and elution technique. Normal allantoic fluid, or the centrifugalized sediment therefrom, failed to absorb antibodies. Influenza B virus (Lee) caused no detectable absorption of antibody from antisera directed against influenza A virus strains, but it specifically absorbed antibody from Lee antisera. 2. The neutralizing, agglutination-inhibiting, and complement-fixing anti-bodies in ferret antisera were completely absorbed only by the homologous virus strain, even though 2 absorptions were carried out with large amounts of heterologous virus strains. 3. PR 8 virus appeared to have the broadest range of specific antigenic components for it completely absorbed the heterologous antibodies in Christie and W. S. antisera and left only those antibodies which reacted with the respective homologous strains. The other virus strains (Christie, Talmey, W.
