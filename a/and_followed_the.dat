5|$|Bond novelist Raymond Benson {{wrote his}} {{adaptation}} of The World Is Not Enough from the film's screenplay. It was Benson's fourth Bond novel <b>and</b> <b>followed</b> <b>the</b> story closely, {{but with some}} details changed. For instance, Elektra sings quietly before her death and Bond still carries his Walther PPK instead of the newer P99. The novel also gave the cigar girl/assassin the name Giulietta da Vinci and retained a scene between her and Renard that was cut from the film.|$|E
5|$|During {{the initial}} {{settlement}} {{period of the}} Niagara area, following the American Revolutionary War, new wagon routes were built over native footpaths. Grimsby and Newark (now Niagara-on-the-Lake) quickly became established settlements, but travel was cumbersome between them. Pioneers were forced to travel south along the Niagara Road to Queenston, where they turned west <b>and</b> <b>followed</b> <b>the</b> Iroquois Road.|$|E
5|$|He {{was born}} into a {{military}} landowning family from the south of the Russian Empire, <b>and</b> <b>followed</b> <b>the</b> family tradition by entering the army. In 1903, he was noticed by Grand Duchess Olga during a military review, and they became close friends. Olga wanted to divorce her first husband, Duke Peter Alexandrovich of Oldenburg, and marry Kulikovsky, but neither her husband nor her brother, the Tsar, would allow it.|$|E

5|$|Little Fishing Creek {{serves as}} a water supply source for nearby {{communities}} such as Millville. Slate has been quarried on the creek and limestone has also been produced there. In the early 1900s, there were woolen mills and tanneries in the watershed and agriculture was also practiced. The creek also powered several small gristmills. The Susquehanna, Bloomsburg, and Berwick Railroad historically crossed the watershed <b>and</b> <b>followed</b> <b>the</b> creek between its mouth and Millville.|$|E
5|$|Paetus {{nonetheless}} appeared {{confident of}} victory, <b>and</b> <b>followed</b> <b>the</b> Parthian {{declaration of war}} and capture of Tigranocerta with his own invasion of Armenia, while Corbulo remained at Syria, further strengthening the fortifications in the Euphrates frontier. Paetus had only two legions with him, IV Scythica and XII Fulminata, and advanced towards Tigranocerta. A few minor forts were taken, but a lack of supplies forced him to withdraw westwards for the winter.|$|E
5|$|Tanya Franks {{returned}} {{to the role of}} Rainie Cross for a stint on 16 June 2014.

5|$|The Mountaineer was a {{passenger}} train operated by Amtrak between Norfolk, Virginia, and Chicago, Illinois, via Cincinnati, Ohio. It {{was the first}} train to use the Norfolk and Western Railway's tracks since the creation of Amtrak in 1971 <b>and</b> <b>followed</b> <b>the</b> route of the Pocahontas, the N's last passenger train. Service began in 1975 and ended in 1977. A new train, the Hilltopper, operated {{over much of the}} Mountaineers route but was itself discontinued in 1979.|$|E
5|$|The album {{proved to}} be Nas’s most commercially {{successful}} release, debuting at #1 on the US Billboard 200 chart. It also heralded Nas’s mainstream popularity <b>and</b> <b>followed</b> <b>the</b> success of other mafioso rap albums such as Only Built 4 Cuban Linx… (1995) and Reasonable Doubt (1996). However, his stylistic changes and increased mainstream success fostered accusations of selling out within the hip hop community. It remains Nas' best-selling release, with over 2 million copies in the United States alone.|$|E
5|$|The {{electrostatic}} force was first described in 1784 by Coulomb {{as a force}} that existed intrinsically between two charges. The properties of the {{electrostatic force}} were that it varied as an inverse square law directed in the radial direction, was both attractive and repulsive (there was intrinsic polarity), was independent {{of the mass of}} the charged objects, <b>and</b> <b>followed</b> <b>the</b> superposition principle. Coulomb's law unifies all these observations into one succinct statement.|$|E

5|$|The {{original}} {{incarnation of}} Highway55 travelled through Hamilton.

It turned west <b>and</b> <b>followed</b> <b>the</b> access down the Niagara Escarpment, ending at Highway6 (John Street).|$|E
5|$|The route {{continued}} past Redbird {{into the}} town of Stockton, where it left Cassadaga Creek and headed uphill as it curved to the west. In Centralia, NY380 met CR54 and CR57 at a four-way intersection. Here, NY380 {{turned back to the}} north and descended into another valley surrounding the Bear Lake Outlet. The route crossed the outlet <b>and</b> <b>followed</b> <b>the</b> waterway into the hamlet of Stockton, centered on the intersection between NY380 and NY424 (now part of CR58).|$|E
5|$|A {{long period}} of uplift and erosion was {{concurrent}} with <b>and</b> <b>followed</b> <b>the</b> above events, creating a major unconformity. Sediments worn off the Death Valley region were shed both east and west and carried by wind and water; the eastern sediments ended up in Colorado and are now famous for their dinosaur fossils. No Jurassic to Eocene sedimentary formations exist in the area except for some possibly Jurassic-age volcanic rock around Butte Valley. Large parts of previously deposited formations were removed; probably by streams that washed the sediment into the Cretaceous Seaway that longitudinally divided North America to the east.|$|E

5|$|After rescuing all the Tribals and {{restoring}} the starship with several needed parts, the team, along with King Jeff, departs to the asteroid and confront Mizar. To {{the surprise of}} all though, Mizar is revealed to be a robot controlled by King Jeff's jealous brother, Barry. Realising that destroying Barry's robot ruined their best chance of destroying the asteroid, the team is out of options. In an honorable notion, Floyd, a little robot that defected from Mizar <b>and</b> <b>followed</b> <b>the</b> team, offers to sacrifice himself to destroy the asteroid. Hesitantly, the team agrees and attaches a timed warhead to Floyd before sending him into the core. The team returns to the starship and departs shortly before Floyd destroys the asteroid. Afterwards on Earth, the Jet Force Gemini team is given the highest honors for their accomplishments.|$|E
5|$|As {{a medieval}} Christian author William could hardly avoid hostility towards the kingdom's Muslim neighbours, {{but as an}} educated man who lived among Muslims in the east, he was rarely polemical or {{completely}} dismissive of Islam. He did not think Muslims were pagans, but rather that they belonged to a heretical sect of Christianity <b>and</b> <b>followed</b> <b>the</b> teachings of a false prophet. He often praised the Muslim leaders of his own day, even if he lamented their power over the Christian kingdom; thus Muslim rulers such as Mu'in ad-Din Unur, Nur ad-Din, Shirkuh, and even Jerusalem's ultimate conqueror Saladin are presented as honourable and pious men, characteristics that William did not bestow on many of his own Christian contemporaries.|$|E
5|$|By the {{beginning}} of the Civil War, Austria-Hungary, Denmark, France, Germany, Greece, Norway, Sweden and Switzerland had recognized Finnish independence. The United Kingdom and United States did not approve it; they stood by <b>and</b> <b>followed</b> <b>the</b> relations between Finland and Germany, the main enemy of the Allies, which hoped to override Lenin's regime and get Russia back into the war against the Germans. As to Finland's separation from Russia, Germany hastened it, in order to get Finland within the German power sphere. France broke off diplomatic relations to the White government of the 1918 war, due to the Whites' co-operation with Germany.|$|E

5|$|By {{the late}} 1590s, his championing of native Scottish {{tradition}} {{was reduced to}} some extent by the increasing likelihood of his succession to the English throne. William Alexander and other courtier poets started to anglicise their written language, <b>and</b> <b>followed</b> <b>the</b> king to London after 1603. James's role as active literary participant and patron made him a defining figure in many respects for English Renaissance poetry and drama, which reached a pinnacle of achievement in his reign, but his patronage of the high style in the Scottish tradition, which included his ancestor James I of Scotland, became largely sidelined.|$|E
5|$|Finally, in late 1229, Theodore began {{assembling}} {{his forces}} at Thessalonica—including {{a contingent of}} troops sent by Frederick II—for the projected final attack on Constantinople. As his troops marched east in spring 1230, he unexpectedly turned his army north <b>and</b> <b>followed</b> <b>the</b> Evros valley into Bulgaria. Theodore's motives for this sudden change are debated. Contemporary and later historians like Akropolites denounced this {{as a sign of}} Theodore's duplicity and treachery. A more likely suggestion is that Theodore, hitherto undefeated in battle, desired to check Bulgarian power and avoid the possibility of the Bulgarians striking in his rear while he was engaged in besieging Constantinople. Although caught by surprise, John Asen reacted rapidly. Allegedly affixing the text of the broken treaty to one of his spears as a flag, he rallied his troops and met Theodore in battle in April 1230. The ensuing Battle of Klokotnitsa was a crushing victory for the Bulgarian ruler, who took Theodore and many of his officers captive.|$|E
5|$|From Cozumel, {{the fleet}} looped around {{the north of}} the Yucatán Peninsula <b>and</b> <b>followed</b> <b>the</b> coast to the Grijalva River, which Cortés named in honour of the Spanish captain who had {{discovered}} it. In Tabasco, Cortés anchored his ships at Potonchán, a Chontal Maya town. The Maya prepared for battle but the Spanish horses and firearms quickly decided the outcome. The defeated Chontal Maya lords offered gold, food, clothing and a group of young women in tribute to the victors. Among these women was a young Maya noblewoman called Malintzin, who was given the Spanish name Marina. She spoke Maya and Nahuatl and became the means by which Cortés was able to communicate with the Aztecs. From Tabasco, Cortés continued to along the coast, and went on to conquer the Aztecs.|$|E
