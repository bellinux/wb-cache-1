The runway, the taxiways and the apron of the airport remained operational, but radio communications were not possible because the control tower was extensively damaged.

A new {{passenger}} terminal (designed by Cezar Lăzărescu), with {{a capacity of}} 1,200,000 passengers per year, was opened on 13 April 1970, for domestic and international flights.

40|$|Single phase {{thyristor}} rectifiers {{are widely}} used in modern airport as dc power supply for such loads as air-conditioners, communication, computers and <b>airport</b> grounding <b>lighting</b> system(AGL). The disadvantages {{of this kind of}} rectifiers are the waveform distortion and the unbalance of loading, both of which have become a concern at many airports. In this paper, the harmonics produced by clusters of phase controlled rectifiers of <b>airport</b> grounding <b>lighting</b> <b>system</b> are studied based on experimental measurement. It is shown these rectifiers are the dominant harmonics source of the airport electrical power system. Harmonic pollution is found to be closely related to the load level of <b>airport</b> grounding <b>lighting</b> <b>system.</b> Voltage waveform distortion at point of common coupling (PCC) is primarily a result of harmonic current generated by the power electronics controlled loads. It is also found total voltage harmonics distortion does not necessarily increase with the increase of current distortion at PCC. The harmonics and unbalance for combined loads are also investigated in this paper. Severe unbalance is observed which is disadvantageous for the power transformer and the auxiliary generator. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

50|$|A Public inquiry was convened to {{investigate}} the accident, during which it emerged that the <b>airport's</b> approach <b>lighting</b> <b>system</b> may have been switched off {{at the time of}} the aircraft's landing attempt. The inquiry also heard evidence regarding a bent screwdriver that had been found in the wreckage, but as this had been removed by an airport worker before its position in the wreckage had been recorded, the likelihood of the object jamming the flight controls could not be assessed. At the conclusion of the inquiry, while it made recommendations regarding the security of aircraft crash sites and tool control during maintenance, and suggested that records be kept of when <b>airport</b> approach <b>lighting</b> was switched on or off, no official cause of the accident was determined.|$|R

40|$|Abstract—A test <b>airport</b> runway <b>lighting</b> <b>system,</b> {{including}} a buried cable {{protected by a}} counterpoise and vertical ground rods, was subjected to direct lightning strikes, and currents and voltages measured {{in different parts of}} the system were reported earlier by Bejleri et al. In this paper, we attempt to model the lightning interaction with this system using the transmission line theory. Lumped devices along the cable such as current regulator and transformers are ignored; possible nonlinear phenomena (arcing) in the system are neglected; the soil is assumed to be homogeneous. The model-predicted currents in the counterpoise, ground rod, and the cable are compared with the measurements, and a reasonable agreement was found for the currents along the counterpoise. It is found that current in the counterpoise is not much influenced by the presence of the cable. Further, vertical ground rods connected to the counterpoise do not have significant influence on the current distribution along the counterpoise. It appears that the model is unable to predict cable currents and voltages in the test system, presumably due to neglecting nonlinear phenomena in the soil and in cable’s insulation and electromagnetic coupling with the lightning channel.

He made improvements of a local airport restaurant and a lounge that had arcades and vending machines for his passengers. Hybla Valley Airport developed several runways and constructed three hangars for airplanes. It also had a flying school facility for training to get a pilot's license. The airport operated {{from time to time}} dozens of airplanes and sold government surplus aircraft. Ashburn's <b>airport</b> installed a <b>lighting</b> <b>system</b> so airplanes could land there at night. The regional facilities grew to 179 acres by 1954.

40|$|In the {{presented}} research, mobile camera {{technology is}} {{used to assess the}} performance of <b>airport</b> ground <b>lighting.</b> In particular, automated assessment of the performance of luminaires in the approach <b>lighting</b> <b>system</b> CALS) within an <b>airport</b> landing <b>lighting</b> <b>system</b> is proposed. To do this a camera must be installed in the cockpit of an aircraft. As the aircraft approaches the runway, the camera records image data of the lighting pattern. Subsequent image analysis, using the computer vision techniques proposed here, will allow a performance metric to be determined for the luminaires. The performance metric will rank the luminaires based on their performance. This is very useful information towards the maintenance strategy for the airport and to date, is the only method available to evaluate the performance of luminaires in the ALS pattern. In order to determine the performance metric for the ALS, the luminaires must be identified in each image in which they appear or tracked throughout the complete acquired image sequence. For each identified lurninaire, the pixel information representing that luminaire must be extracted and stored. A measure of the pixel grey level per luminaire per image is then used to estimate a performance measure for each luminaire. In addition, since mobile camera technology is used, some of the captured images can become corrupted with the effects of vibration. The effect that this vibration will have on the pixel grey level information recorded for a given luminaire is not known. Therefore a methodology to quantify this effect is proposed. In addition, since the quality of captured images can vary with vibration, a reliability factor is also automatically determined for each acquired performance measurement. Using the performance measurement data luminaires are ranked in a list and this list is then reported to the maintenance team at a given airport.

40|$|The {{development}} of machine vision based pilot aids {{to help reduce}} night approach and landing accidents is explored. The techniques developed are motivated {{by the desire to}} use the available information sources for navigation such as the <b>airport</b> <b>lighting</b> layout, attitude sensors and Global Positioning System to derive more precise aircraft position and orientation information. The fact that <b>airport</b> <b>lighting</b> geometry is known and that images of <b>airport</b> <b>lighting</b> can be acquired by the camera, has lead to the synthesis of machine vision based algorithms for runway relative aircraft position and orientation estimation. The main contribution of this research is the synthesis of seven navigation algorithms based on two broad families of solutions. The first family of solution methods consists of techniques that reconstruct the <b>airport</b> <b>lighting</b> layout from the camera image and then estimate the aircraft position components by comparing the reconstructed lighting layout geometry with the known model of the <b>airport</b> <b>lighting</b> layout geometry. The second family of methods comprises techniques that synthesize the image of the <b>airport</b> <b>lighting</b> layout using a camera model and estimate the aircraft position and orientation by comparing this image with the actual image of the <b>airport</b> <b>lighting</b> acquired by the camera. Algorithms 1 through 4 belong to the first family of solutions while Algorithms 5 through 7 belong to the second family of solutions. Algorithms 1 and 2 are parameter optimization methods, Algorithms 3 and 4 are feature correspondence methods and Algorithms 5 through 7 are Kalman filter centered algorithms. Results of computer simulation are presented to demonstrate the performance of all the seven algorithms developed...|$|R
