5|$|<b>Applications</b> <b>are</b> often {{classified}} {{according to}} how often their subtasks need to synchronize or communicate with each other. An application exhibits fine-grained parallelism if its subtasks must communicate many times per second; it exhibits coarse-grained parallelism {{if they do not}} communicate many times per second, and it exhibits embarrassing parallelism if they rarely or never have to communicate. Embarrassingly parallel <b>applications</b> <b>are</b> considered the easiest to parallelize.|$|E

The high thermal conductivity of diamond makes it suitable as a heat sink for integrated circuits in electronics.|$|E
5|$|The high {{non-linearity}} of {{lithium niobate}} {{also makes it}} useful in non-linear optics applications.

5|$|Nuclear weapons {{manufacture}} and other nuclear physics <b>applications</b> <b>are</b> {{a major source}} of artificial lithium fractionation, with the light isotope 6Li being retained by industry and military stockpiles {{to such an extent that}} it has caused slight but measurable change in the 6Li to 7Li ratios in natural sources, such as rivers. This has led to unusual uncertainty in the standardized atomic weight of lithium, since this quantity depends on the natural abundance ratios of these naturally-occurring stable lithium isotopes, as they are available in commercial lithium mineral sources.|$|E
5|$|Resistance welding {{involves}} {{the generation of}} heat by passing current through the resistance caused by the contact between two or more metal surfaces. Small pools of molten metal are formed at the weld area as high current (1000–100,000 A) is passed through the metal. In general, resistance welding methods are efficient and cause little pollution, but their <b>applications</b> <b>are</b> somewhat limited and the equipment cost can be high.|$|E
