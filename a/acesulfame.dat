25|$|<b>Acesulfame</b> {{potassium}} (Ace-K) is 200 times {{sweeter than}} sucrose (common sugar), {{as sweet as}} aspartame, about two thirds as sweet as saccharin, and one third as sweet as sucralose. Like saccharin, it has a slightly bitter aftertaste, especially at high concentrations. Kraft Foods has patented the use of sodium ferulate to mask acesulfame's aftertaste. <b>Acesulfame</b> potassium is often blended with other sweeteners (usually aspartame or sucralose), which give a more sucrose-like taste, whereby each sweetener masks the other's aftertaste and also exhibits a synergistic effect in which the blend is sweeter than its components.|$|E
25|$|The {{perceived}} {{sweetness of}} aspartame (and other sweet substances like <b>acesulfame</b> K) in humans {{is due to}} its binding of the heterodimer G-protein coupled receptor formed by the proteins TAS1R2 and TAS1R3.|$|E
25|$|Red Bull {{contains}} caffeine, taurine, B vitamins (B3, B5, B6, B12), sucrose, and glucose. To produce Red Bull Sugarfree, sugars sucrose and glucose {{have been}} replaced by the sweeteners <b>acesulfame</b> K and aspartame/sucralose.|$|E
25|$|Unlike aspartame, <b>acesulfame</b> {{potassium}} {{is stable}} under heat, even under moderately acidic or basic conditions, {{allowing it to}} be used as a food additive in baking or in products that require a long shelf life. In carbonated drinks, it is almost always used in conjunction with another sweetener, such as aspartame or sucralose. It is also used as a sweetener in protein shakes and pharmaceutical products, especially chewable and liquid medications, where it can make the active ingredients more palatable.|$|E
25|$|In 2004, {{perhaps in}} {{response}} to the burgeoning popularity of low-carbohydrate diets such as the Atkins diet, Coca-Cola announced its intention to develop and sell a low-carbohydrate alternative to Coke Classic, dubbed C2 Cola. C2 contains a mix of high fructose corn syrup, aspartame, sucralose, and <b>Acesulfame</b> potassium. C2 is designed to more closely emulate the taste of Coca-Cola Classic. Even with {{less than half of the}} food energy and carbohydrates of standard soft drinks, C2 is not a replacement for zero-calorie soft drinks such as Diet Coke. C2 went on sale in the U.S. on June 11, 2004, and in Canada in August 2004. C2's future is uncertain due to disappointing sales.|$|E
25|$|Sugar-free gum {{sweetened}} with xylitol {{has been}} shown to reduce cavities and plaque. The sweetener sorbitol has the same benefit, but is only about one-third as effective as xylitol. Other sugar substitutes, such as maltitol, aspartame and <b>acesulfame</b> K, have also been found to not cause tooth decay. Xylitol is specific in its inhibition of Streptococcus mutans, bacteria that are significant contributors to tooth decay. Xylitol inhibits Streptococcus mutans in the presence of other sugars, with the exception of fructose. Xylitol is a safe sweetener that benefits teeth and saliva production because, unlike most sugars, it is not fermented to acid. Daily doses of xylitol below 3.44grams are ineffective and doses above 10.32grams show no additional benefit. Other active ingredients in chewing gum include fluoride, which strengthens tooth enamel, and p-chlorbenzyl-4-methylbenzylpiperazine, which prevents travel sickness. Chewing gum also increases saliva production.|$|E
2500|$|Sucralose is an {{artificial}} sweetener and sugar substitute. The majority of ingested sucralose is not {{broken down by}} the body, so it is noncaloric. In the European Union, it is also known under the E number E955. Sucralose is about 320 to 1,000 times sweeter than sucrose, three times as sweet as both aspartame and [...] <b>acesulfame</b> potassium, and twice as sweet as sodium saccharin. [...] Evidence of benefit is lacking for long-term weight loss with some data supporting weight gain and heart disease risks.|$|E
2500|$|Aspartame is {{approximately}} 200 times sweeter than sucrose (table sugar). Due to this property, even though aspartame produces four kilocalories of energy per gram (/g) when metabolized, {{the quantity of}} aspartame needed to produce a sweet taste is so small that its caloric contribution is negligible. [...] The taste of aspartame and other artificial sweeteners {{differs from that of}} table sugar in the times of onset and how long the sweetness lasts, though aspartame comes closest to sugar's taste profile among approved artificial sweeteners. The sweetness of aspartame lasts longer than that of sucrose, so it is often blended with other artificial sweeteners such as <b>acesulfame</b> potassium to produce an overall taste more like that of sugar.|$|E
2500|$|In the United States, seven {{intensely}} sweet sugar substitutes {{have been}} approved for use. They are stevia, aspartame, sucralose, neotame, <b>acesulfame</b> potassium (Ace-K), saccharin, and advantame. Cyclamates are used outside the U.S., but have been prohibited in the U.S. since 1969. Others, {{which may or may}} not be approved depending on jurisdiction, include allulose (psicose) and monk fruit. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration regulates artificial sweeteners as food additives. [...] Food additives must be approved by the FDA, which publishes a generally recognized as safe (GRAS) list of additives. [...] Stevia is exempt under the FDA's GRAS policy due to its being a natural substance in wide use well before 1958, and the FDA has approved it on these grounds. The conclusions about safety are based on a detailed review of a large body of information, including hundreds of toxicological and clinical studies.|$|E
2500|$|Sucralose {{is found}} in many food and {{beverage}} products, used {{because it is a}} no-calorie sweetener, does not promote dental cavities, is as safe for consumption by diabetics and nondiabetics, and does not affect insulin levels, although the sucralose-based sweetener product Splenda contains 95% (by volume) bulking agents dextrose and maltodextrin that do affect insulin levels. Sucralose is used as a replacement for, or in combination with, other artificial or natural sweeteners such as aspartame, <b>acesulfame</b> potassium or high-fructose corn syrup. Sucralose is used in products such as candy, breakfast bars and soft drinks. [...] It is also used in canned fruits wherein water and sucralose take the place of much higher calorie corn syrup-based additives. Sucralose mixed with maltodextrin or dextrose (both made from corn) as bulking agents is sold internationally by McNeil Nutritionals under the Splenda brand name. In the United States and Canada, this blend is increasingly found in restaurants, in yellow packets, in contrast to the blue packets commonly used by aspartame and the pink packets used by those containing saccharin sweeteners; in Canada, though, yellow packets are also associated with the SugarTwin brand of cyclamate sweetener.|$|E
50|$|Research {{suggests}} <b>acesulfame</b> K {{may affect}} prenatal development. One study appeared to show <b>acesulfame</b> K is ingested by mice through their mothers' amniotic fluid or breast milk, and this influences the adult mouse's sweet preference.|$|E
5000|$|One rodent {{study showed}} no {{increased}} incidence of tumors {{in response to}} administration of <b>acesulfame</b> K. In this study, conducted by the National Toxicology Program, 60 rats were given <b>acesulfame</b> K for 40 weeks, making {{up as much as}} 3% of their total diet (which would be equivalent to a human consuming 1,343 [...] cans of artificially sweetened soft drinks every day). No sign indicated these (or lower) levels of <b>acesulfame</b> K increased the rats' risk of cancer or other neoplasms. However, a similar study conducted with p53 haploinsufficient mice showed signs of carcinogenicity in males but not females. Further food safety research has been recommended. <b>Acesulfame</b> K did not show any DNA-damaging properties.|$|E
5000|$|Recently, {{two other}} {{sweeteners}} {{have been used}} with increasing frequency: sucralose (marketed as Splenda) and <b>acesulfame</b> potassium ("Sunett" [...] or [...] "Ace K"). The K in [...] "Ace K" [...] represents the chemical symbol for potassium. <b>Acesulfame</b> potassium is usually combined with aspartame, sucralose, or saccharin rather than alone and its use is particularly common among smaller beverage producers (e.g. Big Red). Diet Rite is the non-aspartame diet soft drink brand with the highest sales today; it uses a combination of sucralose and <b>acesulfame</b> potassium.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Acesulfame</b> {{potassium}} ( [...] ), {{also known}} as <b>acesulfame</b> K [...] (K is the symbol for potassium) or Ace K, is a calorie-free sugar substitute (artificial sweetener) often marketed under the trade names Sunett and Sweet One. In the European Union, it is known under the E number (additive code) E950. It was discovered accidentally in 1967 by German chemist Karl Clauss at Hoechst AG (now Nutrinova). In chemical structure, <b>acesulfame</b> potassium is the potassium salt of 6-methyl-1,2,3-oxathiazine-4(3H)-one 2,2-dioxide.
