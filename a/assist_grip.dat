25|$|On 6 May 1990, 3801 was {{involved}} in the Cowan rail disaster. 3801 was struggling to climb the Cowan Bank (on the Sydney side of the Hawkesbury River) when returning from the Morpeth Jazz Festival when a CityRail Interurban passenger service crashed into the back of 3801's train. Six people lost their lives, including driver of the intercity electric, and a passenger in the V Set's cab. 3801 applied sand to the track to <b>assist</b> <b>grip</b> and an investigation into the crash suggested this may have caused the signals to malfunction. The signals changed from red to green several times. After the signals were green for a few moments, the interurban driver then entered the tunnel behind 3801 where the accident occurred. The handbrake in one of the carriages may also have been applied.|$|E
40|$|A {{receptacle}} to hold {{a medical}} sharps device such as a scalpel (5) during a surgical procedure. The receptacle has an elongate recess (10, 12) to receive the medical sharps device, a finger access arrangement (15) to enable access to {{the handle of the}} medical device and laterally extending wings (9) on the receptacle to provide stability for the receptacle in use. A raised portion (17) in the recess raises the handle of the medical device to <b>assist</b> <b>gripping</b> it. Adhesive pads (13) may be placed under the wings. The receptacle can be disposable or be able to be sterilised...|$|R

2500|$|A {{friction}} ridge is {{a raised}} {{portion of the}} epidermis on the digits (fingers and toes), the palm of the hand or the sole of the foot, consisting {{of one or more}} connected ridge units of friction ridge skin. These are sometimes known as [...] "epidermal ridges" [...] which are caused by the underlying interface between the dermal papillae of the dermis and the interpapillary (rete) pegs of the epidermis. These epidermal ridges serve to amplify vibrations triggered, for example, when fingertips brush across an uneven surface, better transmitting the signals to sensory nerves involved in fine texture perception. These ridges may also <b>assist</b> in <b>gripping</b> rough surfaces and may improve surface contact in wet conditions.|$|R
50|$|Firm Ground cleats {{are defined}} as cleats that are made {{typically}} for use on natural surfaces such as dirt and grass. These cleats are equipped with large studs {{on the bottom of}} the shoe to <b>assist</b> in <b>gripping</b> the surface and preventing sliding and assisting in rapid directional changes. These studs are permanently attached to the cleats (i.e. they are not removable). The stud itself is often called a cleat. There are three main types of soccer cleats: round, hard ground, and bladed. Active outdoorsman and philanthropist Erik Van Till is credited as a creator of the round cleat. While the studs are sometimes made out of metal, this is less common, as they are illegal in some sports for safety reasons.|$|R
5000|$|Wrist straps: Wrist straps (lifting straps) are {{sometimes}} used to <b>assist</b> in <b>gripping</b> very heavy weights. Wrist straps {{can be used}} to isolate muscle groups like in [...] "lat pull-downs", where the trainee would primarily use the latissimus dorsi muscles of the back rather than the biceps. They are particularly useful for the deadlift. Some lifters avoid using wrist straps to develop their grip strength, just as some go further by using thick bars. Wrist straps can allow a lifter initially to use more weight than {{they might be able to}} handle safely for an entire set, as unlike simply holding a weight, if it is dropped then the lifter must descend with it or be pulled down. Straps place stress on the bones of the wrist which can be potentially harmful if excessive.|$|R
50|$|Athletes need {{to throw}} from a seated position. They cannot throw from an {{inclined}} or other position. Doing so {{could increase the}} contribution of their legs and benefit their performance. Their legs must be {{in contact with the}} seat during the throw. If an athlete throws from a non-seated position, this is counted as a foul. People in this class can put tape on their non-throwing hand to <b>assist</b> in <b>gripping</b> the holding bar. All straps used to hold the athlete to the frame must be non-elastic. While in the process of throwing, an athlete cannot touch a tie-down for the frame. Because of visibility issues for officials, athletes cannot wear lose clothing and they can ask athletes to tuck in clothing if they feel there is any issue with visibility. In throwing events at the Paralympic Games and World Championships, athletes get three trial throws. After that, the top 8 throwers get an additional three throws. For other events, organizers generally have the option to use that formula to give all throwers six consecutive throws. The total number of warm-up throws is at the discretion of the meet director.|$|R
50|$|Burton’s legless lizard has {{significant}} morphological adaptations to {{enable it to}} deal with large struggling prey items. The first adaptation is a skull with an elongated snout that may, along with its pointed, recurved and hinged teeth, be an adaptation that <b>assists</b> it to <b>grip</b> its prey. In addition, this elongated snout may also promote binocular vision which would allow strikes to be more accurately directed. Another adaptation that assists Burton’s legless lizard to hold its prey is its flexible mesokinetic and hypokinetic joints which allow its jaws to encircle prey. Lastly, {{the ability of the}} species to retract its eyes is of key importance as it is a visual predator that relies on eyesight and this adaptation effectively protects them during conflict.|$|R
5000|$|Stickum, {{along with}} other {{adhesive}} or [...] "sticky" [...] substances (such as glue, rosin (tree sap), or food substances), were used for years in the National Football League to <b>assist</b> players in <b>gripping</b> the ball. The use of adhesives such as Stickum was banned by the league in 1981, and the resulting action {{became known as the}} [...] "Lester Hayes rule" [...] in association with the Oakland Raiders defensive back known for his widespread use of Stickum. Despite the ban, Hall of Famer Jerry Rice freely admitted to illegally using stickum throughout his career, leading many fans to question the integrity of his receiving records. [...] Rice's claim that [...] "all players" [...] in his era used stickum was quickly denied by Hall of Fame contemporaries Cris Carter and Michael Irvin.|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: A {{fingerprint}} in {{its narrow}} sense is an impression {{left by the}} friction ridges of a human finger. In a wider use of the term, fingerprints are the traces of an impression from the friction ridges of any part of a human or other primate hand. A print from the foot can also leave an impression of friction ridges. A friction ridge is a raised portion of the epidermis on the digits (fingers and toes), the palm of the hand or the sole of the foot, consisting {{of one or more}} connected ridge units of friction ridge skin These are sometimes known as "epidermal ridges " which are caused by the underlying interface between the dermal papillae of the dermis and the interpapillary (rete) pegs of the epidermis. These epidermal ridges serve to amplify vibrationstriggered, for example, when fingertips brush across an uneven surface, better transmitting the signals to sensory nerves involved in fine texture perception. These ridges also <b>assist</b> in <b>gripping</b> rough surfaces, as well as smooth wet surfaces. This paper presents removal of noise from a fingerprint image. It was implemented using two methods. First is using histogram equalization, Wiener filtering, binarization and thinning. Second is using anisotropic filter. Second method was successful in removing noise. matlab environment was used simulation of proposed alogorithm...|$|R
50|$|The {{practical}} reasoning for {{the extra}} finger on the glove stems from having more surface area available to the archer for the heavier draws. During the draw, the thumb of the archer is typically placed on the last gloved finger of the drawing hand, with the first (or, {{in the case of}} a yotsugake, the first and index fingers) being placed gently on either the thumb or the arrow shaft itself. Sometimes a type of resin powder, called giriko is applied to the thumb and holding finger to <b>assist</b> in the <b>grip</b> during the pull. The extra finger allows for a stronger hold on the thumb, as it is then placed on the third finger of the hand instead of the second. Some schools, such as Heki-ryū Insai-ha only use the three-fingered glove, even with bows above 40 kilograms.|$|R
40|$|Various robotic exoskeletons {{have been}} {{proposed}} for hand function assistance during {{activities of daily living}} (ADL) of stroke survivors. However, traditional exoskeletons involve the use of complex rigid systems that impede the natural movement of joints, and thus reduce the wearability and cause discomfort to the user. The objective {{of this paper is to}} design and evaluate a soft robotic glove that is able to provide hand function assistance using fabric-reinforced soft pneumatic actuators. These actuators are made of silicone rubber which has an elastic modulus similar to human tissues. Thus, they are intrinsically soft and compliant. Upon air pressurization, they are able to support finger range of motion (ROM) and generate the desired actuation of the finger joints. In this work, the soft actuators were characterized in terms of their blocked tip force, normal and frictional grip force outputs. Combining the soft actuators and flexible textile materials, a soft robotic glove was developed for grasping assistance during ADL for stroke survivors. The glove was evaluated on five healthy participants for its <b>assisted</b> ROM and <b>grip</b> strength. Pilot test was performed in two stroke survivors to evaluate the efficacy of the glove in assisting functional grasping activities. Our results demonstrated that the actuators designed in this study could generate desired force output at a low air pressure. The glove had a high kinematic transparency and did not affect the active ROM of the finger joints when it was being worn by the participants. With the assistance of the glove, the participants were able to perform grasping actions with sufficient <b>assisted</b> ROM and <b>grip</b> strength, without any voluntary effort. Additionally, pilot test on stroke survivors demonstrated that the patient 2 ̆ 7 s grasping performance improved with the presence and assistance of the glove. Patient feedback questionnaires also showed high level of patient satisfaction and comfort. In conclusion, this paper has demonstrated the possibility of using soft wearable exoskeletons that are more wearable, lightweight, and suitable to be used on a daily basis for hand function assistance of stroke survivors during activities of daily living...|$|R
