5000|$|Version 4.0 {{included}} a fully functional word processor - Q&A Write - {{that could be}} launched from Q&A or used as a stand-alone application. Q&A Write featured a 100,000 word spell check, a 660,000 word thesaurus, a dictionary, formatting options such as page layout, columnar formatting, <b>automatic</b> <b>page</b> <b>numbering</b> and headers, as well as support for the addition of graphics. Additionally, it offered multifont printing support {{and the ability to}} hot-link elements of a Lotus 1-2-3 document, Symphony spreadsheet or Lotus PIC graphs, to Q&A Write documents. Macros could be stored in an ASCII text file created with a text editor, Q&A Write or by recording keys; the Macro Menu could be accessed from many locations by pressing Shift-F2.|$|E
50|$|Most desktop {{publishing}} software allows for grids {{in the form}} of a page filled with coloured lines or dots placed at a specified equal horizontal and vertical distance apart. Automatic margins and booklet spine (gutter) lines may be specified for global use throughout the document. Multiple additional horizontal and vertical lines may be placed at any point on the page. Invisible to the end-user/audience shapes may be placed on the page as guidelines for page layout and print processing as well. Software templates are achieved by duplicating a template data file, or with master page features in a multiple-page document. Master pages may include both grid elements and template elements such as header and footer elements, <b>automatic</b> <b>page</b> <b>numbering,</b> and automatic table of contents features.|$|E
5000|$|Master {{pages are}} {{templates}} used to automatically copy or link elements and graphic design styles to {{some or all}} {{the pages of a}} multipage document. Linked elements can be modified without having to change each instance of an element on pages that use the same element. Master pages {{can also be used to}} apply graphic design styles to <b>automatic</b> <b>page</b> <b>numbering.</b> Cascading Style Sheets can provide the same global formatting functions for web pages that master pages provide for virtual paper pages. Page layout is the process by which the elements are laid on the page orderly, aesthetically, and precisely. Main types of components to be laid out on a page include , linked images that can only be modified as an external source, and embedded images that may be modified with the layout application software. Some embedded images are rendered in the application software, while others can be placed from an external source image file. Text may be keyed into the layout, placed, or (with database publishing applications) linked to an external source of text which allows multiple editors to develop a document at the same time.Graphic design styles such as color, transparency, and filters, may also be applied to layout elements. Typography styles may be applied to text automatically with style sheets. Some layout programs include style sheets for images in addition to text. Graphic styles for images may be border shapes, colors, transparency, filters, and a parameter designating the way text flows around the object called [...] "wraparound" [...] or [...] "runaround.

The spectrum of methods under investigation includes OS-level <b>automatic</b> <b>page</b> placement algorithms, dynamic page migration, and manual data distribution. The trade-off that these methods face lies between performance and programming effort. <b>Automatic</b> <b>page</b> placement algorithms are transparent to the programmer, but may compromise memory access locality. Dynamic page migration is also transparent, but requires careful engineering of online algorithms to be effective. Manual data distribution on the other requires substantial programming effort and architecture-specific extensions to OpenMP, but may localize memory accesses in a nearly optimal manner.

40|$|Reading books, magazines, {{and printed}} {{materials}} {{is an essential}} activity of daily living. Turning pages of a book or magazine is often cumbersome for avid readers and disabled individuals. An <b>automatic</b> <b>page</b> turner can serve as an assistive technology {{for people with disabilities}} and people with limited upper-body extremity function. The purpose of this project is try to find a better new form of an <b>automatic</b> <b>page</b> turner that will help such disabled people to complete the motions of turning pages so that to satisfy the desire of reading and learning. Individuals with decreased hand functioning, as the result of diagnoses such as arthritis, cerebral palsy, and stroke often have difficulties with fine motor activities. Reading, specifically the act of page-turning, can be one such activity that is greatly affected. Assistive page turners are available commercially, but for many school systems and private families the cost of these systems is prohibitive. A low-cost page turning device has been designed, allowing a user to turn a page of printed matter by simply touching a switch with their head, hand, or other body part. So developing an <b>automatic</b> <b>page</b> turner will ultimately provide a capability to turn and hold the page using a mechanical structure for people who need to read without assistance...|$|R

These two pages will replace page 10 in the outstanding drafts. Conversely, if pages 15 and 16 are shortened such that they now occupy a single page, the revisions will be distributed on a single <b>page</b> <b>numbered</b> 15-16.|$|R
