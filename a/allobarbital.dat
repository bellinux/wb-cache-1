2500|$|In 1971, the Convention on Psychotropic Substances {{was signed}} in Vienna. Designed to {{regulate}} amphetamines, barbiturates, and other synthetics, the 34th version of the treaty, , regulates secobarbital as schedule II, amobarbital, butalbital, cyclobarbital, and pentobarbital as schedule III, and <b>allobarbital,</b> barbital, butobarbital, mephobarbital, phenobarbital, butabarbital, and vinylbital as schedule IV on its [...] "Green List". The combination medication Fioricet, consisting of butalbital, caffeine, and paracetamol (acetaminophen), however, is specifically exempted from controlled substance status, while its sibling Fiorinal, which contains aspirin instead of paracetamol and may contain codeine phosphate, remains a schedule III drug.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Allobarbital,</b> {{also known}} as allobarbitone and branded as Cibalgine or Dial-Ciba (in {{combination}} with ethyl carbamate), is a barbiturate derivative invented in 1912 by Ernst Preiswerk and Ernst Grether working for CIBA. It was used primarily as an anticonvulsant although it has now largely been replaced by newer drugs with improved safety profiles. Other uses for <b>allobarbital</b> included as an adjutant to boost the activity of analgesic drugs, and use {{in the treatment of}} insomnia and anxiety.|$|E
50|$|<b>Allobarbital</b> {{was never}} {{particularly}} widely used compared to better known barbiturates such as phenobarbital and secobarbital, although it saw more use in some European {{countries such as}} Bulgaria and Slovakia, and is still used in for example Poland, but only as compound.|$|E

40|$|A {{method for}} the {{extraction}} and identification of urinary metabolites of allylic barbiturates by gas chromatography and mass spectrometry is described. The metabolites from rat and guinea pig urine were extracted and separated into two fractions (an acidic and a nonacidic fraction) by chromatography on DEAE-Sephadex before being converted into suitable derivatives for gas phase analysis. N,N’-dimethyi derivatives were used except {{in cases where}} metabolic N-demethylation was possible, in which case N-ethylation yielded more information. Hydroxyl, keto, and epoxy groups were converted into trimethylsilyl (TMS), alkyloxime, and chloro-TMS derivatives, respectively. This procedure was used to identify metabolites present in urine at concentrations as low as 0. 1 pg/mI. The allyl sidechains of secobarbital, alphenal, <b>allobarbital,</b> and aprobarbital were metabolized to epoxides, diols, and, {{in the case of}} secobarbital, to a ketol. Other sidechains were usually hydroxylated. Secobarbital was metabolized to compounds containing hydroxyl groups in both chains. Hexobarbital was metabolized by allylic hydroxylation, and no evidence of the epoxide-diol the detection of epoxides of the four allyli...|$|E
40|$|A {{method for}} the {{simultaneous}} {{qualitative and quantitative}} determination of drugs of abuse (opiates, cocaine, or amphetamines) and prescribed drugs (tricyclic antidepressants, phenotiazines, benzodiazepines, etc.) in biological fluids— blood, urine, bile, and gastric contents—was developed. This procedure involves solid-phase extraction with Bond-Elut Certify columns followed by analysis by gas chromatography– nitrogen-phosphorus detection (GC–NPD) and confirmation by gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC–MS), after derivatization, when necessary. Pretreatment was performed on all samples: sonication for 15 min plus enzymatic hydrolysis with β-glucuronidase in urine. With respect to the internal standards, nalorphine and trihexylamine were used for basic substances, <b>allobarbital</b> for acidic drugs, and prazepam for benzodiazepines. Acidic and basic compounds were extracted from different aliquots of samples at different pH levels: 6 – 6. 5 for the acidic and neutral and 8 – 8. 5 for the basic and the benzodiazepines. Several areas of experimental design were considered {{in the process of}} method optimization. These included internal standards, pH, sonication, flow rate and washing solvents. It was found that systematic analysis could be reliably performed using optimized extraction conditions. The recovery rates for the compounds tested were always higher than 61. 02 %...|$|E
