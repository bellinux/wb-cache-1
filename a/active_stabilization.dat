50|$|Prior to Keynes, a {{situation}} in which aggregate demand for goods and services did not meet supply was referred to by classical economists as a general glut, although there was disagreement among them as to whether a general glut was possible. Keynes argued that when a glut occurred, it was the over-reaction of producers and the laying off of workers that led to a fall in demand and perpetuated the problem. Keynesians therefore advocate an <b>active</b> <b>stabilization</b> policy to reduce the amplitude of the business cycle, which they rank among the most serious of economic problems. According to the theory, government spending can be used to increase aggregate demand, thus increasing economic activity, reducing unemployment and deflation.|$|E
50|$|Phase {{modulated}} light, {{consisting of}} a carrier frequency and two side bands, is directed onto a two-mirror cavity. Light reflected off the cavity is measured using a high speed photodetector, the reflected signal consists of the two unaltered side bands along with a phase shifted carrier component. The photodetector signal is mixed down with a local oscillator, which is in phase with the light modulation. After phase shifting and filtering, the resulting electronic signal gives {{a measure of how}} far the laser carrier is off resonance with the cavity and may be used as feedback for <b>active</b> <b>stabilization.</b> The feedback is typically carried out using a PID Controller which takes the PDH error signal readout and converts it into a voltage that can be fed back to the laser to keep it locked on resonance with the cavity.|$|E

50|$|Proxflyer {{refers to}} a family of micro R/C {{helicopter}} prototypes based on a dual coaxial counter-rotating rotor concept developed and patented by Norwegian Petter Muren. The concept differs from the swashplate designs in conventional helicopter flight controls and enables a helicopter to be passively stable in hover. Elimination of the conventional cyclic and collective pitch controls allows for simpler and lighter helicopters to be developed. A helicopter based on this design achieves stability {{without the use of}} gyroscopes or any form of <b>active</b> <b>stabilization</b> and thus is made up of much fewer parts than other model helicopters. The two counter-rotating rotors keep the helicopter very stable relative to the surrounding air. Altitude control is performed by varying the speed for both main rotors while Yaw control is achieved by increasing the speed of one rotor and reducing the speed of the other rotor by the same amount. A horizontally oriented tail rotor controls the helicopter’s forward or backward movement by shifting its center of lift with respect to the center of gravity (CG).|$|E
50|$|A decoherence-free {{subspace}} (DFS) is a subspace of a system's Hilbert {{space that}} is invariant to non-unitary dynamics. Alternatively stated, {{they are a}} small section of the system Hilbert space where the system is decoupled from the environment and thus its evolution is completely unitary. DFSs can also be characterized as a special class of quantum error correcting codes. In this representation they are passive error-preventing codes since these subspaces are encoded with information that (possibly) won't require any <b>active</b> <b>stabilization</b> methods. These subspaces prevent destructive environmental interactions by isolating quantum information. As such, they are an important subject in quantum computing, where (coherent) control of quantum systems is the desired goal. Decoherence creates problems in this regard by causing loss of coherence between the quantum states of a system and therefore the decay of their interference terms, thus leading to loss of information from the (open) quantum system to the surrounding environment. Since quantum computers cannot be isolated from their environment (i.e. we cannot have a truly isolated quantum system in the real world) and information can be lost, the study of DFSs {{is important for the}} implementation of quantum computers into the real world.|$|E
40|$|Switching mode power {{electronic}} converter with feedback loop control makes itself {{work as a}} constant power load (CPL). CPLs have negative input impedance which may cause system instability. This is known as input impedance instability problem. Both passive and <b>active</b> <b>stabilization</b> methods can solve this problem. However, <b>active</b> <b>stabilization</b> methods is more power efficient. Many <b>active</b> <b>stabilization</b> methods have been proposed for DC/AC inverter based CPL. However, <b>active</b> <b>stabilization</b> methods for DC/DC converter in voltage mode control based CPL receive little concern. In this project, a direct active method and the optimal active method for DC/DC buck converter in voltage mode control have been proposed. Comparing with the direct method, the optimal method can make the settling time shorter and have smaller undesirable effect on the load performance. Simulation and experimental results are reported to verify {{the effectiveness of these}} two methods...|$|E

40|$|Recent {{demands in}} {{sophisticated}} agricultural machinery require passive or active image sensors to be mounted on vehicle frames. The impact produced by vertical displacements due to tire-soil interaction and mechanical engine vibration causes oscillations that reduce the data quality of any activity performed by {{equipment such as}} a camera, spectroradiometer, or scanner laser. This paper presents the modeling and simulation of an active system for stabilization of oscillations using a fractional order PID (Proportional-Integral-Derivative) controller. A method for tuning the fractional order PID is presented for a closed-loop dynamic system. Experiments based on simulations are carried out to compare {{the performance of the}} <b>active</b> <b>stabilization</b> system with fractional and integer order PID controllers. Common excitation functions are used to assess the performance of the <b>active</b> <b>stabilization</b> system, along with some common vibration disturbances acquired by a field experiment with a tractor-implement set. The results show that the <b>active</b> <b>stabilization</b> system presents better performance, mitigating vibration displacements and accelerations through a closed-loop system with a fractional PID controller. Additionally, numerical results confirm the superior capacity of the fractional controller based system for attenuating the vibration disturbance compared to the classical PID system for different machinery operational conditions such as forward speed and load. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersio...|$|E
