5|$|Willaumez's fleet {{discovered}} Beresford's ships off Lorient at 16:30 in {{the afternoon}} and Willaumez ordered his second-in-command, Contre-amiral Antoine Louis de Gourdon, to drive Beresford away.

5|$|As Généreux pulled <b>away</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> west, Thompson, who {{had already}} been wounded several times, succeeded in turning his {{battered}} ship so that his broadside was directed at the stern of Généreux. Despite the collapsed wreckage of the mizzenmast and fore topmast, his gunnery teams managed to cut away enough of the obstruction to fire a raking broadside at the French vessel. Although Leander had inflicted severe damage, the size {{and power of the}} French ship was beginning to tell, and Lejoille was able to turn Généreux southwards again. The ships continued exchanging broadsides until 15:30, by which time Leanders crew had run out of regular shot and were firing scrap metal at the French ship. Eventually Lejoille succeeded in bringing Généreux across Leanders bow and hailed the British ship, asking if they had surrendered. Unable to continue fighting due to the wreckage that lay across the forward guns, Thompson ordered a French flag raised on a pike, which was sufficient for Lejoille to cease firing.|$|E
