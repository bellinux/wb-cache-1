25|$|Stressful working {{conditions}} {{can lead to}} three types of strains: Behavioral (e.g., absenteeism or poor performance), physical (e.g., headaches or coronary heart disease), and psychological (e.g., anxiety or depressed mood). Physical symptoms that may occur because of occupational stress include fatigue, headache, upset stomach, muscular <b>aches</b> <b>and</b> <b>pains,</b> weight gain or loss, chronic mild illness, and sleep disturbances. Psychological and behavioral problems that may develop include anxiety, irritability, alcohol and drug use, feeling powerless and low morale. The spectrum of effects caused by occupational stress includes absenteeism, poor decision making, lack of creativity, accidents, organizational breakdown or even sabotage. If exposure to stressors in the workplace is prolonged, then chronic health problems can occur including stroke. An examination was of physical and psychological effects of workplace stress was conducted {{with a sample of}} 552 female blue collar employees of a microelectronics facility. It was found that job-related conflicts were associated with depressive symptoms, severe headaches, fatigue, rashes, and other multiple symptoms. Studies among the Japanese population specifically showed a more than 2-fold increase in the risk of total stroke among men with job strain (combination of high job demand and low job control). Those in blue-collar or manual labor jobs are more likely to develop heart disease compared to those in white-collar jobs. Along with the risk of stroke, stress can raise the risk of high blood pressure, immune system dysfunction, coronary artery disease. Prolonged occupational stress can lead to occupational burnout. Occupational stress can also disrupt relationships.|$|E

Based on the anti-inflammatory activity (92. 4 % inhibition of the cyclooxygenase enzyme COX- 2) initially observed for a crude extract, stems of T. phanerophlebia were here examined for the underlying phytochemical principles. Three cholestane triterpenoids β-sitosterol, β-sitostenone and stigmast- 4 -ene- 3, 6 -dione were isolated from the ethanol extract by silica gel column chromatography via gradient elution with hexane/ethyl acetate mixtures. Structure elucidation was facilitated by use of physical and spectroscopic methods, including high field 2 D NMR and mass spectroscopic techniques. The crude extract as well as β-sitosterol was seen to be selective inhibitors of the cyclooxygenase enzyme COX- 2. This work is of chemosystematic relevance as it represents the first isolation of β-sitostenone and stigmast- 4 -ene- 3, 6 -dione from any species of Terminalia...|$|R
