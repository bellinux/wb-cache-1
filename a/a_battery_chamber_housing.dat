40|$|In my {{bacteria}} powered battery, Geobacter sulfurreducens is used {{to provide}} electrons into an electrode for electricity production. G. sulfurreducens is especially suited to this purpose due to its ability to make conductive protein filaments that seek out nearby electron acceptors. This bacteria requires anaerobic conditions {{and the presence of}} Fe(lll) to produce electricity. I designed <b>a</b> dual <b>chambered</b> <b>battery,</b> separated into aerobic and anaerobic chambers, to test the electricity production. I measured a voltage drop of 420 mV across a 500 ohm resistor from which I calculated the current generated to be 0. 68 mAo Given my results and analysis of prior studies, I addressed a few issues to fix on this particular project as well as obstacles to a real world implementation of this technology...|$|R
40|$|A {{simple and}} {{inexpensive}} Space Shuttle experimental apparatus to conduct microgravity melting and solidification is presented. A GAS space furnace was initially {{developed as a}} student design project at the USAF Academy and further refined at NASA Lewis. The experiment package consists of <b>a</b> melting <b>chamber,</b> <b>battery</b> power system, temperature data recording systems, and electronic controller. The melting chamber is a thin-walled tube wrapped by heating resistance wire. Thermocouples are used to record the specimen thermal history. Power is supplied by 2 -V batteries wired to produce 360 W. The mV output of the thermocouples is amplified, cold-junction compensated, and converted to a frequency which is then recorded on an off-the-shelf cassette tape recorder. A backup data recording system which digitizes the amplified signal and records the data on EEPROMs has also been included. This experimental device demonstrates that basic science research can be kept simple and inexpensive...|$|R

50|$|Vacuum {{pressure}} casting (VPC) uses gas pressure and a vacuum {{to improve the}} quality of the casting and minimize porosity. Typically VPC machines consist of an upper and a lower chamberâ€”the upper chamber, or melting <b>chamber,</b> <b>housing</b> the crucible, and the lower casting <b>chamber</b> <b>housing</b> the investment mould. Both chambers are connected via a small hole containing a stopper. A vacuum is pulled in the lower chamber, while pressure is applied in the upper, and then the stopper is removed. This creates the greatest pressure differential to fill the molds.|$|R

50|$|The solvent {{is heated}} to reflux. The solvent vapour travels up a {{distillation}} arm, and floods into the <b>chamber</b> <b>housing</b> the thimble of solid. The condenser ensures that any solvent vapour cools, and drips {{back down into}} the <b>chamber</b> <b>housing</b> the solid material. The chamber containing the solid material slowly fills with warm solvent. Some of the desired compound dissolves in the warm solvent. When the Soxhlet chamber is almost full, the chamber is emptied by the siphon. The solvent is returned to the distillation flask. The thimble ensures that the rapid motion of the solvent does not transport any solid material to the still pot. This cycle may be allowed to repeat many times, over hours or days.|$|R
