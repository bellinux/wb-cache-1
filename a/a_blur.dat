40|$|Perceived {{brightness}} is nonlinearly {{related to}} luminance. Consequently, any mechanism {{operating on the}} (transformed) luminance profile of <b>a</b> <b>blurred</b> edge to detect its location should make errors, and the magnitude of these errors should increase with contrast. The perceived location of <b>a</b> <b>blurred</b> edge was measured at a range of contrasts and <b>a</b> range of <b>blur</b> space constants in a vernier alignment task. It {{was found that the}} perceived location of <b>a</b> <b>blurred</b> edge was affected by the contrast and the blur space constant of the edge. At low contrasts, the apparent location of the blurred edge was near the calculated location of the edge, assuming the linear transduction of luminance. At higher contrasts, the perceived location of <b>a</b> <b>blurred</b> edge was shifted toward {{the dark side of the}} edge, and the shift increased with contrast...|$|R

25|$|With {{the natural}} Poisson {{distribution}} {{due to the}} random arrival and absorption times of the photons, there is an expected natural dose (photon number) variation of at least several percent 3 sigma, making the exposure process susceptible to stochastic variations. The dose variation leads to {{a variation of the}} feature edge position, effectively becoming <b>a</b> <b>blur</b> component. Unlike the hard resolution limit imposed by diffraction, shot noise imposes a softer limit, with the main guideline being the ITRS line width roughness (LWR) spec of 8% (3s) of linewidth. Increasing the dose will reduce the shot noise, but this also requires higher source power.|$|E
25|$|The {{advantages}} {{possessed by}} roller printing over all other processes are mainly three: firstly, its high productivity, 10,000 to 12,000 yards being commonly printed {{in one day}} of ten hours by a single-colour machine; secondly, by its capacity of being applied to the reproduction of every style of design, ranging from the fine delicate lines of copperplate engraving and the small repeats and limited colours of the perrotine to the broadest effects of block printing and to patterns varying in repeat from I to 80 in.; and thirdly, the wonderful exactitude with which each portion of an elaborate multicolour pattern can be fitted into its proper place, and the entire absence of faulty joints at its points of repeat or repetition consideration {{of the utmost importance}} in fine delicate work, where such <b>a</b> <b>blur</b> would utterly destroy the effect.|$|E
25|$|In the 19th century, {{a wave of}} {{seemingly}} noble sounding surnames began to appear among the common population, where {{a significant number of}} the bourgeoisie class, and even the peasantry, began to adopt or bear the noble -ski suffix. The -ski suffix was thus attached to surnames derived from a person's occupation, characteristics, patronymic surnames, or toponymic surnames (from a person's place of residence, birth or family origin). This caused <b>a</b> <b>blur</b> between the -ski bearing territorial toponymic surnames once a characteristic only borne by the nobility. As such, and contrary to a popular modern-day misconception, a person simply bearing the -ski suffix in their family surname or merely sharing the same toponymic surname as members of Poland's nobility, does not in itself denote that person too {{is a member of the}} nobility, of noble origin, or indeed connected to that particular family.|$|E

25|$|The {{last three}} days are very much {{connected}} and are sometimes described as <b>a</b> <b>blur.</b> The third day of the convention, June 20, 1969, began with tense conversations between RYM, RYM II, and PL who fought over how to proceed with SDS as a whole. The question of black nationalism {{and the role of}} women in SDS caused much disagreement. RYM thought that black nationalism was important and backed it, while RYM II merely agreed that it existed and PL very strongly opposed to it. Like black nationalism, when it came to the “matter of women’s liberation,” PL thought that it was more important for women to “focus upon the ‘class struggle’”. RYM disagreed, instead proposing that women’s focus be in “anti-imperialism and anti-racism,” but in a more prominent and powerful role. To PL’s beliefs, Bernardine Dohrn, Mike Klonsky, and others “responded by declaring that it was impossible to remain in the same organization with people who opposed self-determination in practice and demanded an immediate split”. After this, Dohrn “announced that she was walking out and invited all those who agreed with her to follow”.|$|E
25|$|Because Music has {{the ability}} to access {{multiple}} parts of the brain, music therapy is highly effective in providing therapeutic support for individuals with all types of dementia. Research indicates that the sections of the brain weakened by dementia can be supported and in some cases strengthened by other areas of the brain through musical activities. Musical ability and awareness {{is also one of the}} last functions to be compromised in an individual with dementia, which makes it an especially effective intervention, even in people with very late stage forms of the disease. Music therapy is more than simply listening to or playing music. Through the use of evidence based interventions and clinical assessments, a music therapist works to improve the lives and abilities of individuals. These interventions can decrease anxiety, improve speech and self- expression, and a decrease in negative behaviors and isolation which are commonly found in individuals with dementia. Common negative behaviors that correspond with dementia are depression and agitation. According to Mary S. Mittelman, the director of psychosocial research at Langone Medical Center, music therapy helped to decrease both of these negative substantially. The reason for this is because in the brain, the parts corresponding to music are preserved even through the effects of dementia. Due to these being preserved, residents who live their lives in <b>a</b> <b>blur</b> find some clarity and familiarity through music, creating lower levels of stress and agitation.|$|E

500|$|In Pittsfield, Virginia, Tony Reed and {{two other}} {{teenagers}} meet in the woods late at night, but they are interrupted by a sheriff's deputy. Moments later the deputy is murdered, killed with his own flashlight. Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) later examine the deputy's body: the blow that killed the man was so ferocious that his glasses were pushed {{through the back of}} his skull. They question the suspect, teenager Tony Reed, whose fingerprints were found on the flash light, but he denies any part in the murder. Mulder and Scully agree that Tony is innocent, although Mulder's theory of spirit involvement is not shared by Scully. Scully, on the other hand, suggests they question Tony's friends. Mulder and Scully visit Tony's school and speak with the two teenagers who were with Tony in the woods: the sheriff's son, Max Harden, and his girlfriend Chastity. Chastity seems concerned about Tony when Mulder and Scully tell her he may go to jail. However, Tony is later released when the murder weapon mysteriously goes missing from the evidence room. Mulder and Scully review video footage from the evidence room that shows the flashlight simply disappear. However, <b>a</b> <b>blur</b> on the video footage attracts Mulder's attention and later analysis by an expert reveals the blurred object is solid and matches the local high school's colors.|$|E
500|$|On June 19, 2000, {{soon after}} Halos preview at Electronic Entertainment Expo 2000, Microsoft {{announced}} that it had acquired Bungie Software and that Bungie would {{become a part of}} the Microsoft Game Division under the name Bungie Studios. Halo would be developed as an exclusive, first-person shooter title for the Xbox. The reasons for Bungie accepting Microsoft's offer were varied. Jones stated that [...] "I don't remember the details exactly, it was all <b>a</b> <b>blur.</b> We'd been talking to people for years and years—before we even published Marathon, Activision made a serious offer. But the chance to work on Xbox—the chance to work with a company that took the games seriously. Before that we worried that we'd get bought by someone who just wanted Mac ports or didn't have a clue." [...] Martin O'Donnell, who had joined Bungie as an employee only ten days before the merger was announced, remembers that the stability of the Xbox as a development platform was not the only benefit. Shortly before Myth IIs release, it was discovered versions of the game could erase a player's hard drive; the glitch led to a massive recall of the games right before they shipped, which cost Bungie nearly one million dollars. O'Donnell stated in a Bungie podcast that this recall created some financial uncertainty, although accepting the offer was not something Bungie [...] "had to do." [...] Seropian and Jones had refused to accept Microsoft's offer until the entire studio agreed to the buyout.|$|E

500|$|The album's only cover song, [...] "California Sun", was {{originally}} written by Henry Glover and Morris Levy, and performed by The Rivieras. While the lyrics and musical structure {{remain the same}} throughout the piece, Joey's pronunciation upon words significantly lessened the similarity to the original song. The sound output tone also differs from the original, with more distortion {{as well as a}} faster tempo. Author Steve Waksman relates: [...] "From the opening bars, 'California Sun' becomes subject to the Ramones' distinctive brand of musical minimalism paired with sonic excess. The chords go by in <b>a</b> <b>blur</b> of distortion; the drums and bass kick at seemingly twice the speed of the Rivieras." [...] The twelfth track [...] "Commando" [...] has a theme which deals with war movies and contains multiple military references. Author Avram Mednick said the song was a successor to [...] "Blitzkrieg Bop", released on the band's debut album. He also noted that it has a [...] "bouncy melody and an infectious call-and-response chorus." [...] "You're Gonna Kill that Girl", which was written very early in the band's career, was also rooted in doo-wop genre. Mednick commented that it appealed highly to those tuning into the Ramones in the UK, and also said it has a [...] "lovely misogynistic tune." [...] The final guitar chord on the track is played by drummer Tommy since Johnny rarely played acoustic. The album's final track, [...] "You Should Never Have Opened That Door", was written by Dee Dee and Johnny, and circles themes of horror films and hints that people in these movies tend to be naïve and unintelligent.|$|E
500|$|The {{tour of the}} United States faced various troubles. Ament {{said that}} the band and its crew had to [...] " [...] shows from the ground up, a venue {{everywhere}} we went." [...] In June 1995, the band was scheduled to play at San Francisco, California's Golden Gate Park in front of 50,000 people. Before the concert Vedder was forced to stay at a hospital after suffering {{from the effects of}} food poisoning. Vedder left the hospital to play the show, however {{he was not able to}} finish and ended up performing just seven out of twenty-one songs with the band. Neil Young filled in for Vedder for the rest of the show that day. Vedder said, [...] "That whole [...] thing was <b>a</b> <b>blur</b> based on some bad food. It was really, really bad. Looking back at it, it doesn't seem as intense as it was, but it was horrible. I just felt not human and looking back I should have got through that show somehow, and I think the fact that Neil [...] was there made me feel like I could get off the hook in some way and I did go out for a few songs." [...] Because of Vedder's health the band was forced to cancel the remaining dates of its tour of the United States. Some dates were reinstated while the rest were rescheduled for the fall. About canceling the dates, Vedder said, [...] "I think we all agreed that it had gotten insane, that it was no longer about the music." [...] Ament later said, [...] "We were so hardheaded about the 1995 tour. Had to prove we could tour on our own, and it pretty much killed us, killed our career." ...|$|E
