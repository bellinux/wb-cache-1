5|$|In season 9 Cristina and Owen's {{marriage}} is again very strained. Cristina is working at Mayo Clinic and Owen in Seattle but she returns. Owen <b>asks</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> divorce. He later {{shows that he}} is {{still in love with}} her and only asked for a divorce so Cristina and the others involved in the plane crash get the money. Cristina and Owen reconcile in episode 9 before Bailey's wedding.|$|E
5|$|One of Bart's early {{hallmarks}} was his prank {{calls to}} Moe's Tavern owner Moe Szyslak in which Bart calls Moe and <b>asks</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> gag name. Moe {{tries to find}} that person in the bar, but soon realizes it is a prank call and angrily threatens Bart. These calls were apparently based {{on a series of}} prank calls known as the Tube Bar recordings, though Groening has denied any causal connection.|$|E
5000|$|In {{some rules}} of Marjapussi, {{the options for}} declaring marriages are ordered: Self-declaring comes first, <b>asking</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> whole comes second, and <b>asking</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> half comes last. In your first opportunity, you are allowed to choose freely which {{alternative}} you use, {{but you are not}} allowed to self-declare after you have <b>asked</b> either <b>for</b> <b>a</b> whole or a half, and you are not allowed to <b>ask</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> whole after you have <b>asked</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> half. The restrictions apply only per hand, and start of a new hand nullifies the restrictions. In some variants, a team that has not <b>asked</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> whole is not allowed to <b>ask</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> half.|$|R

5|$|Brian and Stewie go to {{the mall}} so they can meet Santa, but Peter is asking Santa for gifts (he <b>asks</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> game of Uno, a Magna Doodle, a pet chink (a mix of a {{chinchilla}} and a mink) and a Charles in Charge lunchbox.) When the mall Santa leaves for the night and Brian demands that he let Stewie sit in his lap, Santa mentions he will be at Applebee's. Stewie says that Santa leaving before he got a chance to sit in his lap felt like a bigger betrayal than the betrayal of Gary Busey by reality; this takes us to Busey looking himself in the mirror asking his reflection, {{in the form of a}} crazed clown, how he is doing.|$|E
5|$|During {{the summer}} vacation, while the first-string team {{plays in the}} prefectural {{qualifying}} tournament for Koshien, Maeno has the portable team practice at a recently closed elementary school with the support from a mysterious old man. The portable team also has six practice matches with other local high schools, all of which reached semifinals or higher in the regional preliminaries. Near {{the end of summer}} vacation, the interim principal decides to dissolve the portable team. However, Coach Maeno <b>asks</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> rematch scrimmage with the first-string team, after which the losing team would be dissolved and that coach would leave.

5|$|Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) and Todd Packer (David Koechner) {{compete to}} become VP under Nellie Bertram (Catherine Tate) by seducing her after {{work at the}} hotel bar. For most of the night, Packer {{seems to be the}} most successful, so Dwight has Gabe Lewis (Zach Woods) spike Packer's beer with his asthma inhaler, which causes Packer to vomit and leaves Dwight alone with Nellie. Dwight {{eventually}} succeeds in seducing Nellie as she <b>asks</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> key to his room. Dwight scratches off the magnetic strip on his hotel card before giving it to Nellie, stating the seduction was only to gain approval and that he does not intend to have sex with her.|$|E

5000|$|Another {{etymology}} {{states that}} michelada is a portmanteau of mi chela helada. The word chela is <b>a</b> popular term <b>for</b> <b>a</b> beer in Mexico. When you <b>ask</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> chela, you are <b>asking</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> cold beer; therefore the phrase mi chela helada means [...] "my ice cold beer".|$|R
5|$|However, {{there are}} some {{complications}} which neither Wally nor the experienced Alisandros anticipates. This time, Varrick's CEO Rueben Massey feels {{sure that there is}} nothing wrong with Krayoxx. The drug works as advertised, it has no ill effects and is unjustly maligned; Varrick has first-rate experts with impeccable records willing to so testify. The Varrick CEO flies to Chicago and engages Nadine Karros, the Rogan Rothberg ace litigator, who <b>asks</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> $5 million non-refundable retainer and bills at $1,000 per hour - and those who can afford it consider her worth every penny. With Karros' help, Varrick sets a trap for the mass tort lawyers. This time Varrick will only pretend to negotiate – their true aim would be to have a jury completely vindicate Krayoxx and deny any kind of tort.|$|E
5|$|Michael (Steve Carell) and Dwight (Rainn Wilson) {{have been}} having secret {{meetings}} in the parking lot, where Dwight provides information about Dunder Mifflin so Michael can undercut the company. However, Dwight's loyalty is {{put to the test}} as Charles Miner (Idris Elba) seems to show more respect for Dwight than Michael ever did. Dwight brings Charles to the parking lot during one of the secret meetings, where Charles orders Michael to stop pestering Dwight. This begins a rivalry between Michael and Dwight, and Michael begins to steal Dwight's clients. Dwight <b>asks</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> truce and offers to take Michael and his employees out to lunch; Dwight does not go to the restaurant and instead sneaks into the empty Michael Scott Paper Company office and steals everything on Michael's desk, including his Rolodex contact list, and places a dead fish in the air conditioning vent.|$|E
5|$|The {{story is}} about three {{brothers}} who, traveling together, reach a treacherous river. They make a magical bridge over the river wherein just as they cross, they meet the personification of Death, who is angry for losing three potential victims. He pretends to be impressed by them and grants each a wish as a reward. The oldest brother asks for an unbeatable dueling wand, so Death gives him the Elder Wand. The middle brother asks for the ability to resurrect the dead, so Death gives him the Resurrection Stone. The youngest brother does not trust Death and <b>asks</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> way to stop Death from following him, so Death reluctantly gives him his Cloak of Invisibility. Afterwards, the brothers go their separate ways.|$|E

50|$|Both legs in {{a neutral}} {{position}} (neither forward nor back), applying equal pressure against the horse's sides, generally <b>asks</b> <b>for</b> <b>an</b> increase in speed or an upward transition (such as walk to trot). Depending {{on the level of}} restraining aids (seat and hands), the leg can also <b>ask</b> <b>for</b> <b>an</b> increase in impulsion, for collection, or even for the rein back. To ask a horse to back up, a rider simultaneously uses soft rein aids to keep the horse from stepping forward, but uses the legs to <b>ask</b> <b>for</b> movement, so the horse moves backwards. It is incorrect to <b>ask</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> rein back by pulling or jerking on the reins.|$|R
5|$|Cristina is re-hired and Owen <b>asks</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> divorce once Cristina {{wants to}} reconcile. Shocked, Cristina agrees, but later {{finds out that}} the {{potential}} conflict of interest regarding the plane crash lawsuit was a key motive behind Owen's request and confronts him. Owen tells her that he 'feels responsible' and was worried as {{he thought she was}} dead. They have a sexual relationship after divorcing. The hospital is sued and found guilty of negligence. The surviving doctors, including Yang, must receive $15 million of compensation each, which leads the hospital to a near bankruptcy as the insurers refuse to pay. Yang, Callie Torres (Sara Ramirez), and the other surviving doctors buy the hospital {{with the help of the}} Harper-Avery Foundation to prevent it from closing, and each become members of the new directing board. After buying the hospital, Yang realizes that she was made for the O.R. and breaks things off with Owen because he still wants kids and she still doesn't.|$|E

5|$|The legend tell of {{the demon}} Malla {{and his younger}} brother Mani, who had gained the boon of invincibility from Brahma, {{creating}} chaos on the earth and harassing the sages. When the seven sages approached Shiva for protection after Indra and Vishnu confessed their incapability, Shiva assumed the form (Avatar) of Martanda Bhairava, as the Mahatmya calls Khandoba, riding the Nandi bull, leading an army of the gods. Martanda Bhairava is described as shining like the gold and sun, covered in turmeric also known as Haridra, three-eyed, with a crescent moon on his forehead. The demon army was slaughtered by the gods and finally Khandoba killed Malla and Mani. While dying, Mani offers his white horse to Khandoba as an act of repentance and <b>asks</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> boon. The boon is that he be present in every shrine of Khandoba, that human-kind is bettered and that he be given an offering of goat flesh. The boon was granted, and thus he was transformed into a demigod. Malla, when asked by the deity if he asked for a boon, asks for the destruction of the world and human-flesh. Angered by the demon's request, Khandoba decapitates him, and his head falls at the temple stairs where it will trampled by devotees' feet. The legend further describes how two Lingas appeared at Prempuri, the place where the demons were killed.|$|E
5|$|Fran {{once lived}} with her sisters Jote and Mjrn in Eruyt Village, the secluded Viera {{settlement}} in Golmore Jungle, but became restless and desired to see the outside world. This was {{a major source of}} conflict between her and the other viera, especially her elder sister Jote, who served as the village matriarch. Fran argued that although all Viera begin their lives in the forest, they are not necessarily bound to remain there to the end. When the party encounters an impassable Viera barrier on the path through Golmore, Fran is forced to return to the village and ask for help. She learns from Jote that their youngest sister Mjrn has run off to the nearby magicite mines. When Fran finds her and brings her back, Mjrn reveals she wishes to leave Golmore, but Fran advises her against doing so, relating how her own independence has cost her her family and the ability to commune with the Wood. Fran accepts that she is now part of the Hume world, and <b>asks</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> confirmation from Jote that the Wood accepts her before she leaves. Jote replies that The Wood misses her child and is jealous of the hume that has taken her away. Fran smiles {{for the first time in}} the game, knowing her sister is lying and still cares for her, as she leaves The Wood for good. In Revenant Wings, Balthier and Fran are searching for the Cache of Glabados. Fran was voiced by Nicole Fantl in English and by Rika Fukami in Japanese. She also appears in Itadaki Street Portable.|$|E
