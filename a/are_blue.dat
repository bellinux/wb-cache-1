5|$|The {{club was}} founded in 1878 but did not turn {{professional}} until 1936, and was subsequently elected to join the Football League in 1938. They play their home games at Portman Road in Ipswich.

5|$|Diamonds {{containing}} boron as a substitutional impurity are termed type IIb. Only {{one percent}} of natural diamonds are of this type, and most <b>are</b> <b>blue</b> to grey. Boron is an acceptor in diamond: boron atoms have one less available electron than the carbon atoms; therefore, each boron atom substituting for a carbon atom creates an electron hole in the band gap that can accept an electron from the valence band. This allows red light absorption, and due to the small energy (0.37 eV) needed for the electron to leave the valence band, holes can be thermally released from the boron atoms to the valence band even at room temperatures. These holes can move in an electric field and render the diamond electrically conductive (i.e., a p-type semiconductor). Very few boron atoms are required for this to happen—a typical ratio is one boron atom per 1,000,000 carbon atoms.|$|E
5|$|Florida International University has {{seventeen}} varsity sports teams, {{named the}} Panthers. The Panthers' athletic colors <b>are</b> <b>blue</b> and gold, and {{compete in the}} NCAA Division I as part of Conference USA in all sports.

The Panthers football team plays at FIU Stadium ("The Cage"), the men and women's basketball and volleyball teams play at the FIU Arena, and the men's baseball team plays at FIU Baseball Stadium. Other athletics venues include the Aquatic Center, Tennis Complex, softball fields, and various other recreational fields. FIU Arena underwent expansion to add more seating and a modernization of the exterior that was completed in late 2011. On July 1, 2013, FIU {{became a member of}} Conference USA.|$|E

Behind the couple, their children replay the scene: the father's cane protrudes between the son's legs, doubling as a hobby horse, while the daughter is clearly in charge, demanding that he hand over his gingerbread.

5|$|Starfish are marine invertebrates. They {{typically}} have a central disc and five arms, though some species {{have a larger}} number of arms. The aboral or upper surface may be smooth, granular or spiny, and is covered with overlapping plates. Many species are brightly coloured in various shades of red or orange, while others <b>are</b> <b>blue,</b> grey or brown. Starfish have tube feet operated by a hydraulic system and a mouth at the centre of the oral or lower surface. They are opportunistic feeders and are mostly predators on benthic invertebrates. Several species have specialized feeding behaviours including eversion of their stomachs and suspension feeding. They have complex life cycles and can reproduce both sexually and asexually. Most can regenerate damaged parts or lost arms and they can shed arms as a means of defence. The Asteroidea occupy several significant ecological roles. Starfish, such as the ochre sea star (Pisaster ochraceus) and the reef sea star (Stichaster australis), have become widely known as examples of the keystone species concept in ecology. The tropical crown-of-thorns starfish (Acanthaster planci) is a voracious predator of coral throughout the Indo-Pacific region, and the northern Pacific sea star is considered {{to be one of the}} world's 100 worst invasive species.|$|E
5|$|Stockport County's {{traditional}} kit colours <b>are</b> <b>blue</b> and white, {{although they}} have played in other colours throughout their history. Originally competing in blue and white striped jerseys and white shorts, they experimented with red and white stripes in the early 1900s, and from the mid-1930s to mid-1960s played in white jerseys and black shorts. No set pattern has been established for the club's use of blue and white as main colours, as they have played at various times in a white jersey with a blue band and blue shorts and a blue jersey with white pin stripes and white shorts. They made a short experiment with an Argentina-style kit, light blue and white stripes with black shorts, after the 1978 World Cup. This was abandoned after {{the outbreak of the}} Falklands War, and the club returned to blue and white striped tops with blue shorts in the 1980s. County marked their 125th anniversary during 2008 by bringing in a third kit – a gold colour with black trim. The kit was worn on 17 occasions, all away trips. The strip was retired 'undefeated' {{at the end of the}} year, having been worn for 13 victories and 4 draws. The kit was also worn during a match against Chester City which was abandoned after 59 minutes.|$|E
5|$|The {{traditional}} colours of all IFK associations <b>are</b> <b>blue</b> and white, and IFK Göteborg is no exception. Soon {{after the}} club's foundation in 1904, {{it was decided}} that the kit should consist of a blue and white striped shirt with blue shorts. But the design was too costly and instead a cheaper alternative was used. Thus the club's first kit used a blue shirt with a single horizontal white stripe and a four-pointed star, one of the IFK association symbols, in white on the chest. During the next few years, white or blue shirts without stripes were used. In 1910, a kit comprising a blue and white vertically striped shirt and blue shorts was used for the first time inspired by the kit of Kjøbenhavns Boldklub. This kit has remained as the home colours ever since. The small amount of sponsor logos, together with the longtime use of blue and white stripes, has made the kit a classic in Swedish football. The most common away kit has been red and white in different styles, though other colour combinations, for example orange and white, have been used, mainly in the 1990s and 2000s. The away kit introduced in 2005 once again used red and white. An almost completely white third kit with blue details was introduced in mid-2007 after requests from supporters. In the 2010s, the away-kit colours have seen much variation, including a pink shirt with black shorts, a black kit with light-grey details, the more traditional red kit with white trimmings, and a purple kit with white details introduced in 2016.|$|E
