500|$|Dromaeosaurids {{had long}} tails. Most {{of the tail}} {{vertebrae}} bear bony, rod-like extensions, as well as bony tendons in some species. In his study of Deinonychus, Ostrom proposed that these features stiffened the tail {{so that it could}} only flex at the base, and the whole tail would then move as a single, rigid, lever. However, one well-preserved specimen of Velociraptor mongoliensis (IGM 100/986) has an articulated tail skeleton that is curved horizontally in a long S-shape. This suggests that, in life, the tail could bend from side to side with a substantial degree of flexibility. It has been proposed that this tail was used as a stabilizer or counterweight while running or in the air; in Microraptor, an elongate diamond-shaped fan of feathers is preserved {{on the end of the}} tail. This may have been used as an <b>aerodynamic</b> <b>stabilizer</b> and rudder during gliding or powered flight (see [...] "Flight and gliding" [...] below).|$|E

40|$|The {{results are}} {{presented}} of four aerodynamic studies that were {{in support of a}} broader, preliminary inquiry concerning the potential use of downward-deployed tethered sub-satellites for in-flight aerothermodynamic research. There are a multitude of questions regarding the general tethered satellite concept and the present report addresses only a few of these. A method for estimating drag and local surface pressure and shear on orbiting or re-entereing bodies is described, and examples based on the planned TSS- 2 (Tethered Satellite System) are given. The problem of pressure measurement are explored, taking into account thermal transpiration, lag time, and the disturbed flow field created by the satellite body. The performance of an <b>aerodynamic</b> <b>stabilizer,</b> a ring-tail design, is calculated and its influence on satellite motion is illustrated. A method for optimizing future satellite shapes for desired aerodynamic properties is transitional rarefied flow with given geometric constraints is proposed and examples are shown...|$|E

50|$|Tail fins {{are covered}} with Kyoban or <b>aerodynamic</b> wooden <b>stabilizer</b> plates. They were {{introduced}} in 1936. It is shed off by the impact on water entry. This <b>aerodynamic</b> wooden <b>stabilizer</b> plates in the tail are {{in the shape of}} box cover for single-engine carrier-based torpedo-bombers Nakajima B5N and Nakajima B6N. In the case for twin-engine land-based torpedo-bombers G3M, G4M, P1Y, and Ki-67, the torpedo wears another type of <b>aerodynamic</b> wooden <b>stabilizer</b> plates covering tail fins in cross to extend their tail length in the air, which is less in drag resistance loss but needs more clearance heights in the bomb bay underneath the fuselage. In the case of land-based torpedo-bomber aircraft, a plate is needed to be set inside the bomb bay to groom the airflow, because the vortex coming in the bomb bay gives the turbulence behavior to the torpedo released.|$|R

40|$|Two {{types of}} a {{tethered}} satellite system (TSS) - a basic 1. 8 -m-diameter spherical spacecraft and the Shuttle Tethered Aerothermodynamic Research Facility (STARFAC) are considered. Issues {{related to the}} deployment and retrieval of a large satellite with exceedingly long tethers are discussed, and the objectives of an Atmospheric Verification Mission (ATM) are outlined. Focus is concentrated on the ATM satellite which will fly after TSS- 1 and before the fully instrumented and costlier TSS- 2. The differences between the AVM and TSS- 2, including {{the configuration of the}} <b>aerodynamic</b> <b>stabilizers,</b> instrumentation, and the materials of construction are outlined.

5000|$|Integrated {{data systems}} require a digital data bus. The MIL-STD-1553 bus was defined in 1973. This enabled the first {{operational}} fully authoritative fly-by-wire {{system to be}} developed for the General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon.

5000|$|Digital systems also {{appeared}} in the aircraft themselves and grew steadily in sophistication. The first FADEC (Full Authority Digital Engine Control) trials took place in 1968, with the first operational system entering service in 1985.

50|$|The Japanese Type 91 torpedo used Kyoban <b>aerodynamic</b> tail <b>{{stabilizers}}</b> in the air. These stabilizers (introduced in 1936) were shed {{off when}} it entered the water. And a new control system (introduced in 1941) stabilized the rolling motion by countersteering {{both in the}} air and the water.The Type 91 torpedo could be released at speed of 180 knots (333 km/h) from 20 m (66 ft) into shallow water but also at 204 knots (the Nakajima B5N2's maximum speed) into choppy waves of a rather heavy sea.|$|R
40|$|This work {{deals with}} the {{development}} of a new preliminary design method for aircraft directional stability and vertical tail sizing. It is focused on regional turboprop aircraft because of their economic advantage over regional jets on short routes, for the increasing oil price, and because of the market needs of new airplanes in the next 20 years. The focus on aircraft directional stability is due to the significant discrepancies that classical semi-empirical methods, as USAF DATCOM and ESDU, provide for some configurations, because they are based on NACA wind tunnel tests about models not representative of an actual transport airplane. This work exploits the CFD to calculate the aerodynamic interference among aircraft parts for hundreds configurations of a given layout, providing a useful method in aircraft preliminary design. A wind tunnel investigation involving about 180 configurations has validated the numerical approach. The innovation of the work concerns the numerical and experimental parametric study on the static directional stability of a model representative of the regional turboprop aircraft category and the direct measurement of the vertical <b>stabilizer</b> <b>aerodynamic</b> forces in the wind tunnel, in addition to the force and moments acting on the whole model. In this way, useful data about aerodynamic interference have been extracted from experimental tests, which are in good agreement with the results of numerical simulations...|$|R
