5|$|Despite {{these and}} {{numerous}} other influences, however, Shelly Manne's style of drumming was always his ownpersonal, precise, clear, {{and at the same}} time multilayered, using a very broad range of colors. Manne was often experimental, and had participated in such musically exploratory groups of the early 1950s as those of Jimmy Giuffre <b>and</b> <b>Teddy</b> Charles. Yet his playing never became overly cerebral, and he never neglected that element usually considered fundamental to all jazz: time.|$|E

5|$|Flanagan's early {{influences}} included Art Tatum <b>and</b> <b>Teddy</b> Wilson, {{both of whom}} {{he heard}} on the radio and playing in the Detroit area, as well as Nat King Cole and local pianists Earl Van Riper and Willie Anderson. These, however, played in an earlier style, and the young Flanagan and his friends were more interested in the newer bebop, including that played by pianist Bud Powell, who had a strong effect on Flanagan's musical thinking and improvising.|$|E
5|$|He grew up {{supporting}} Tottenham Hotspur, {{and states}} his footballing heroes were Darren Anderton <b>and</b> <b>Teddy</b> Sheringham {{after watching the}} attacking football Tottenham played during the early 1990s.

5|$|As Farmer's {{reputation}} grew, he {{expanded from}} bebop into more experimental forms through working with composers such as George Russell <b>and</b> <b>Teddy</b> Charles. He {{went on to}} join Gerry Mulligan's quartet and, with Benny Golson, to co-found the Jazztet. Continuing to develop his own sound, Farmer switched from trumpet to the warmer flugelhorn in the early 1960s, and he helped to establish the flugelhorn as a soloist's instrument in jazz. He settled in Europe in 1968 and continued to tour internationally until his death. Farmer recorded more than 50 albums under his own name, a dozen with the Jazztet, and dozens more with other leaders. His playing {{is known for its}} individuality – most noticeably, its lyricism, warmth of tone and sensitivity.|$|E

5|$|Ken Levine {{remarked that}} the whole {{audience}} laughed during the filming of an office scene between Coach and his daughter {{at the end of}} the episode.

5|$|Graham's {{replacement}} was Glaswegian John Docherty. In {{his second}} season as manager, Millwall won the Second Division championship and gained promotion to the top flight of English football {{for the first time}} in the club's history. Starting the 1988–89 season strongly, Millwall topped the league on 1 October 1988 having played six games (winning four and drawing two) and rarely slipped out of the top five before Christmas. This was mainly due to Tony Cascarino <b>and</b> <b>Teddy</b> Sheringham, who scored 99 goals between them in three seasons playing together. Millwall's first top division season ended with a tenth-place finish, which was the lowest place occupied by the club all season. The following season, they briefly led the league for one night in September 1989 after beating Coventry City 4–1, but won only two more games all season and were relegated in 20th place at the end of the 1989–90 season.|$|E
