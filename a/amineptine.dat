25|$|Although several related {{compounds}} are disclosed {{in the original}} patent, {{it is unclear whether}} these share tianeptine's unique pharmacological effects. <b>Amineptine,</b> the most closely related drug to have been widely studied, is a dopamine reuptake inhibitor with no significant effect on serotonin levels.|$|E
25|$|In a {{study of}} 1022 outpatients, overall sexual {{dysfunction}} with all antidepressants averaged 59.1% with SSRIs values between 57 and 73%, mirtazapine 24%, nefazodone 8%, <b>amineptine</b> 7% and moclobemide 4%. Moclobemide, a selective reversible MAO-A inhibitor, does not cause sexual dysfunction, and can actually lead to an improvement {{in all aspects of}} sexual function.|$|E
25|$|The {{majority}} of the tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) act primarily as serotonin–norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) by blocking the serotonin transporter (SERT) and the norepinephrine transporter (NET), respectively, which results in an elevation of the synaptic concentrations of these neurotransmitters, and therefore an enhancement of neurotransmission. Notably, with the sole exception of <b>amineptine,</b> the TCAs have negligible affinity for the dopamine transporter (DAT), and therefore have no efficacy as dopamine reuptake inhibitors (DRIs).|$|E

2500|$|A {{very small}} number of cases {{involving}} non-medical use of antidepressants have been reported over the past 30 years. According to the US government classification of psychiatric medications, TCAs are [...] "non-abusable" [...] and generally have low abuse potential.

Several cases of the misuse of amitriptyline alone or together with methadone or in other drug dependent patients and of dosulepin with alcohol or in methadone patients have been reported.|$|E
5000|$|Worre {{has once}} been tested {{positive}} for <b>amineptine</b> in 1992, he confessed {{to the use of}} doping, receiving a conditional suspension. <b>Amineptine</b> is a mild but pleasant stimulant and a fast-acting mood-brightener. <b>Amineptine</b> had been on the doping list {{for a couple of months}} before Worres confession of using <b>amineptine,</b> and was removed again from the list of banned performance-enhancing drugs shortly after.|$|E
50|$|<b>Amineptine</b> {{inhibits}} the reuptake of dopamine and, to {{a lesser}} extent, of norepinephrine. There is also some evidence that <b>amineptine</b> additionally acts to selectively induce the presynaptic release of dopamine. In addition to its catecholaminergic actions, <b>amineptine</b> is a very weak anticholinergic and antihistamine.|$|E
50|$|Pharmacodependence is {{very common}} with <b>amineptine</b> {{compared}} to other antidepressants. A variety of psychological symptoms can occur during withdrawal from <b>amineptine,</b> such as anxiety and agitation.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Amineptine,</b> a TCA-derivative that {{predominantly}} inhibits DA re-uptake and has minimal noradrenergic and serotonergic {{activity has}} also been shown to possess antidepressant activity. A number of studies have suggested that <b>amineptine</b> has similar efficacy to the TCAs, MAOIs and SSRIs. However, <b>amineptine</b> is no longer available as a treatment for depression due to reports of an abuse potential.|$|E
50|$|<b>Amineptine</b> {{was never}} {{approved}} by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for marketing in the United States, meaning {{that it is not}} legal to market or sell <b>amineptine</b> for any medical uses in the US.|$|E

50|$|<b>Amineptine</b> was {{developed}} by the French Society of Medical research in the 1960s. Under the trade-names (Survector, Maneon, Directim, Neolior, Provector, Viaspera) <b>amineptine</b> was used as an atypical tricyclic antidepressant (TCA) that selectively inhibits the reuptake of dopamine {{and to a lesser extent}} norepinephrine, in turn producing an antidepressant effect.|$|E
50|$|The risk of {{addiction}} is low, but exists nonetheless. Between 1978 and 1988, there were 186 cases of <b>amineptine</b> addiction {{reported to the}} French Regional Centres of Pharmacovigilance; an analysis of 155 of those cases found that they were predominantly female, and that two-thirds of cases had known risk factors for addiction. However, a 1981 study of known opiate addicts and schizophrenia patients found no drug addiction {{in any of the}} subjects. In a 1990 study of eight <b>amineptine</b> dependence cases, the gradual withdrawal of <b>amineptine</b> could be achieved without problems in six people; in two others, anxiety, psychomotor agitation, and/or bulimia appeared.|$|E
5000|$|Tricycle: amitriptyline, melitracen, cyclobenzaprine, tianeptine, <b>amineptine,</b> {{clopenthixol}} chlorprothixene flupentixol thiothixene zuclopenthixol ...|$|E

5000|$|Severe acne due to <b>amineptine</b> {{was first}} {{reported}} in 1988 by various authors - Grupper, Thioly-Bensoussan, Vexiau, Fiet, Puissant, Gourmel, Teillac, Levigne, {{to name a}} few - simultaneously in the same issue of Annales de dermatologie et de vénéréologie and in the 12 March 1988 issue of The Lancet. A year later, Dr Martin-Ortega and colleagues in Barcelona, Spain reported a case of [...] "acneiform eruption" [...] in a 54-year-old woman whose intake of <b>amineptine</b> was described as [...] "excessive." [...] One year after that, Vexiau and colleagues reported six women, one of whom never admitted to using <b>amineptine,</b> getting severe acne concentrated in the face, back and thorax, the severity of which varied with the dosage. Most of them were treated unsuccessfully with isotretinoin (Accutane) for about 18 months; two of the three that discontinued <b>amineptine</b> experienced a reduction in cutaneous symptoms, with the least affected patient going into remission.|$|E

50|$|Various {{tricyclic}} antidepressants (TCAs) {{contain the}} dibenzocycloheptene moiety in their chemical structures, including <b>amineptine,</b> amitriptyline, amitriptylinoxide, butriptyline, demexiptiline, nortriptyline, noxiptiline, and protriptyline. Cyclobenzaprine, a skeletal muscle relaxant, also contains this functional group.|$|E
50|$|There is some, albeit mixed, {{in vitro}} {{evidence}} that the antidepressant and modestly selective DRI <b>amineptine</b> may in addition to inhibiting the reuptake of dopamine selectively induce the presynaptic release of dopamine without affecting that of norepinephrine or serotonin.|$|E

50|$|<b>Amineptine</b> can rarely cause hepatitis, of the cytolytic, cholestatic varieties.

50|$|In one study, {{nortriptyline}} had {{the highest}} affinity for the dopamine transporter among the TCAs (KD = 1,140 nM) besides <b>amineptine</b> (a norepinephrine-dopamine reuptake inhibitor), although its affinity for this transporter was still 261- and 63-fold lower than for the norepinephrine and serotonin transporters (KD = 4.37 and 18 nM, respectively).|$|E

5000|$|Introduced in France in 1978 by the {{pharmaceutical}} company Servier and marketed under the trade name Survector, <b>amineptine</b> soon {{gained a reputation}} for abuse due to its short-lived, but pleasant, stimulant effect experienced by some patients.

5000|$|Dopamine reuptake inhibitors (DRIs) or {{dopamine}} transporter (DAT) inhibitors such as methylphenidate (Ritalin), bupropion (Wellbutrin), <b>amineptine,</b> and nomifensine, cocaine, methylenedioxypyrovalerone (MDPV; [...] "Sonic"), ketamine, and phencyclidine (PCP), among others, {{which are}} used in the treatment of attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and narcolepsy as psychostimulants, obesity as anorectics, depression and anxiety as antidepressants and anxiolytics, respectively, drug addiction as anticraving agents, and sexual dysfunction, as well as illicit street drugs.|$|E

50|$|In {{spite of}} its {{atypical}} nature and different profile of activity, trimipramine {{has been shown in}} head-to-head clinical studies to possess equivalent effectiveness to other antidepressants, including but not limited to other TCAs (e.g., amitriptyline, imipramine, doxepin, <b>amineptine),</b> tetracyclic antidepressants (TeCAs) (e.g., maprotiline), monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) (e.g., phenelzine, isocarboxazid), and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (e.g., fluoxetine). In addition, trimipramine has been found to possess greater anxiolytic effects than other TCAs such as amitriptyline and doxepin in head-to-head comparisons. Indeed, its prominent anxiolytic effects have been said to distinguish it from most other TCAs. The atypicality of trimipramine in relation to its lack of monoamine reuptake inhibition is described as challenging the monoamine hypothesis of depression.|$|E
50|$|The {{following}} {{drugs have}} DRI action {{and have been}} or are used clinically specifically for this property: <b>amineptine,</b> dexmethylphenidate, difemetorex, fencamfamine, lefetamine, levophacetoperane, medifoxamine, mesocarb, methylphenidate, nomifensine, pipradrol, prolintane, and pyrovalerone. The following drugs are or have been used clinically and possess only weak DRI action, {{which may or may}} not be clinically-relevant: adrafinil, armodafinil, bupropion, mazindol, modafinil, nefazodone, sertraline, and sibutramine. The following drugs are or have been clinically used but only coincidentally have DRI properties: benzatropine, diphenylpyraline, etybenzatropine, ketamine, nefopam, pethidine (meperidine), and tripelennamine. The following are a selection of some particularly notably abused DRIs: cocaine, ketamine, MDPV, naphyrone, and phencyclidine (PCP). Amphetamines, including amphetamine, methamphetamine, MDMA, cathinone, methcathinone, mephedrone, and methylone, are all DRIs as well, but are distinct in that they also behave, and potentially more potently as dopamine releasing agents (DRAs) (it should be noted that due to Yerkes-Dodson's law, 'more potently stimulated' may not equal more optimally functionally stimulated). There are very distinct differences in the mode of action between dopamine releasers/substrates & dopamine re-uptake inhibitors; the former are functionally entropy-driven (i.e. relating to hydrophobicity) and the latter are enthalpy-driven (i.e. relating conformational change). Reuptake inhibitors such as cocaine induce hyperpolarization of cloned human DAT upon oocytes that are naturally found on neurons, whereas releasing agents induce de-polarization of the neuron membrane.|$|E
