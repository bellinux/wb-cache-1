Introduction With the increased emphasis on fuel economy improvements, especially in Europe, automotive research and engineering efforts are refocused on Lean burn (LB) and Direct Injection (DI) engines. Lean burn engines typically operate at <b>air</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>ratios</b> of 20 : 1, while DI engines are operated at <b>air</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>ratios</b> as high as 40 : 1 during stratified charge mode of operation.

40|$|This report, An Experimental Evaluation of Low Calorific Value Gaseous Fuels as a Heat Source for Stirling Engines, {{was written}} by Johan Westerberg as a Master's thesis at Chalmers University of Technology. It covers the topic of MILD {{combustion}} of liquid propane gas, G 25 natural gas, synthesis gas and landfill gas, of which the latter two represents low calorific gaseous fuels. The investigated engine was a C 9 G Stirling engine from Cleanergy. The primary incentive to {{this study was to}} determine if steady and reliable operation of the C 9 G Stirling engine could be maintained while using low calorific gaseous fuels. Another incentive to this project was to achieve further understanding of the combustion device, which purpose is to supply the Stirling engine with heat. Thus, an understanding of the changed characteristics caused by varying the <b>air</b> to <b>fuel</b> <b>ratio</b> was targeted. Engine operation by use of landfill gas, made up by 20 percent methane in carbon dioxide and nitrogen, was successful at the lowest load setting allowed by the C 9 G engine, generating 1 : 5 kW of shaft power. For liquid propane gas and G 25 natural gas, up to 10 : 9 kW of shaft power was generated. Combustion of synthesis gas was not attempted due to the hazard of carbon monoxide poisoning, caused by insufficient ventilation in the test cell. Apparent changes in energy ows and temperatures within the combustion device at varied <b>air</b> to <b>fuel</b> <b>ratios</b> suggest that incomplete combustion prior to the heat sink of the Stirling engine was an issue, especially at low to moderate <b>air</b> to <b>fuel</b> <b>ratios.</b> Further, a reversed ow direction through the ue gas recirculation cavities was observed when high ow rates of fuel, which primarily occurs for high load settings and low <b>air</b> to <b>fuel</b> <b>ratios,</b> was supplied to the engine. Consequently, a higher <b>air</b> to <b>fuel</b> <b>ratio</b> resulted in a higher system efficiency for all tested fuels and load settings.

50|$|In {{almost all}} cases, people are {{interested}} in increasing the power output of an engine. Many well tried and tested techniques have been devised to achieve this, but all essentially operate to increase the rate (and to a lesser extent efficiency) of combustion in a given engine. This is achieved by putting more air/fuel mixture into the engine, increasing compression ratio (requires higher octane gas) burning it more rapidly, and getting rid of the waste products more rapidly - this increases volumetric efficiency. In order to check the amount of the air/fuel mixture, <b>air</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>ratio</b> meters are often used. The weight of this fuel will affect the overall performance of the automobile, so fuel economy is a competitive advantage.
