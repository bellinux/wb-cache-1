500|$|If the {{candidate}} was manic, {{he was also}} dedicated and filled with good humor, {{and he had a}} particular genius for getting media attention. He spent long hours registering voters and shaking hands at bus stops and movie theater lines. He took whatever opportunity came along to promote himself. He thoroughly enjoyed campaigning, and his success was evident. With the large numbers of volunteers, he had dozens at a time stand along the busy thoroughfare of Market Street as human billboards, holding [...] "Milk for Assembly" [...] signs while commuters drove {{into the heart of the}} city to work. He distributed his campaign literature anywhere he could, including among one of the most influential political groups in the city, the Peoples Temple, an organization that Milk attended regularly. Milk's volunteers even took thousands of brochures and because the Peoples Temple leader, Jim Jones, was a politically powerful individual in San Francisco, Milk encouraged Temple members to work his phones, spoke at the Temple and later wrote a letter to President Jimmy Carter defending Jones character. Milk's relationship with the Temple was not entirely similar to other politicians' in Northern California. According to The San Francisco Examiner, Jones and his parishioners were a [...] "potent political force", helping to elect Moscone (who appointed him to the Housing Authority), District Attorney Joseph Freitas, and Sheriff Richard Hongisto. (Jacobs, John [...] [...] "S.F.'s Leaders Recall Jones the Politician", The San Francisco Examiner, p.C.) [...] Milk spoke at the Temple ("Another Day of Death", Time, December 11, 1978.) and defended Jones in a letter to President Jimmy Carter in 1978. [...] (In that letter he called Jones [...] "a man of the highest character," [...] and criticized outspoken Temple defectors for trying to [...] "damage Rev. Jones' reputation" [...] with [...] "apparent bold-faced lies".) (Coleman, Loren (2004), The Copycat Effect, Simon & Schuster, p.68.). [...] However, When Milk learned Jones was backing both him and Art Agnos in 1976, he told friend Michael Wong, [...] "Well fuck him. I'll take his workers, but, that's the game Jim Jones plays." [...] But to his volunteers, he said: [...] "Make sure you're always nice to the Peoples Temple.

2500|$|On November 19, 2006, Governor Romney led a rally {{against the}} legislature's delaying tactics {{in front of}} the Massachusetts State House. Romney said: [...] "The issue before us is not whether {{same-sex}} couples should marry. The issue before us today is whether 109 legislators will follow the constitution." [...] He said he would ask a justice of the SJC to order the initiative placed on the ballot because the legislators were refusing to fulfill their constitutional obligations. The next day he sent the 109 legislators a copy of the state constitution with a letter underscoring the document's provision that the legislators sitting as a constitutional convention shall vote on initiatives: [...] "Not 'may' vote ... not 'could' vote ... not 'perhaps' vote ... It's very clear." [...] His reference was to the clause: [...] "final legislative action in the joint session ... shall be taken only by call of the yeas and nays". He filed the lawsuit as one member of a group of private citizens on November 24, citing 5 occasions in 24 years in which the legislature failed to vote on valid initiatives. Other plaintiffs included Ray Flynn and officials of VoteOnMarriage.org and the Catholic Action League of Massachusetts. Named as defendants were the Massachusetts Secretary of State, who oversees the preparation of election ballots, William F. Galvin, and the President of the Massachusetts Senate who chairs joint sessions of the legislature, Senator Travaglini. After a 20-minute hearing on November 30, Associate Justice Judith A. Cowin ordered an expedited hearing before the full SJC on December 20. At that hearing both sides agreed that the SJC could not enforce an order against the legislature. An attorney for the plaintiffs said: [...] "We're not <b>asking</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> tell the Legislature how to do their business. We're only <b>asking</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> declare what their constitutional obligations are." [...] An Assistant Attorney General representing the legislature countered that the voters were free to replace the legislators at the next election.|$|E
2500|$|The Irgun's {{activities}} were classed as terrorism by MI5. The Irgun {{has been viewed}} as a terrorist organization or organization which carried out terrorist acts. In particular the Irgun was branded a terrorist organisation by Britain, the 1946 Zionist Congress and the Jewish Agency. Begin argued that terrorists and freedom fighters are differentiated in that terrorists deliberately try to target civilians, and that the Irgun was not guilty of terrorism since it supposedly tried to avoid civilian casualties. At the events to mark the 60th anniversary of the attack, Benjamin Netanyahu, then chairman of Likud and Leader of the Opposition in the Knesset, opined that the bombing was a legitimate act with a military target, distinguishing it from an act of terror intended to harm civilians. He said, [...] "Imagine that Hamas or Hizbullah would call the military headquarters in Tel Aviv and say, 'We have placed a bomb and we are <b>asking</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> evacuate the area.' They don't do that. That is the difference." ...|$|E

2500|$|Speaking of Lopez's image, Andrew Barker of Variety observed: [...] "Despite a {{carefully}} cultivated image as an imperious pop empress in ludicrously expensive outfits, her signature hits bear the titles [...] "I'm Real" [...] and [...] "Jenny From the Block". She managed the perilous transition from actress to music star without ever seeming to pick {{either as a}} primary gig.

[...] In 2002, Lynette Holloway of The New York Times described Lopez as overexposed. She wrote: [...] "Forgive yourself if you are seeing Jennifer Lopez in your sleep. She is everywhere." [...] Holloway noted her image to be [...] "a dash of ghetto fabulousness" [...] and [...] "middle-class respectability" [...] for mass appeal. Entertainment Weekly observed a change in her public profile upon joining American Idol in 2011, writing: [...] "Gone was her old cut-a-bitch swagger; J. Lo 2.0 is an all-embracing, Oprahfied earth [...]" [...] Lopez is considered an icon of popular culture. Television presenter Ray Martin describes her as a [...] "showbiz phenomenon".|$|E
2500|$|Founders of Women for the Wall {{have stated}} that they support {{alternative}} prayer at the Robinson's Arch section of the Kotel. They have requested meetings with leaders of Women of the Wall, who have declined. W4W leaders state that their objection is to the imposition of alternative prayer and associated political agendas on traditional women, plus their desire to confront and shock them, at Judaism's holiest site [...] [...] "Don't forget, Women FOR the Wall is not <b>asking</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> change.

[...] Ronit Peskin has stated concerning traditional women, [...] "We want to come and pray peacefully, and you (The Women of the Wall group that insist on praying in the traditional women's section and not at Robinson's Arch) are disrupting the prayers of other women around you." [...] Leaders of W4W have condemned any show of verbal or phsycal violence by orthodox Jews against WoW and their supporters. The ongoing efforts of W4W to role model peaceful, silent prayer, plus their calls to the orthodox to refuse to respond to provocations have decreased heated reactions from the orthodox camp; The Forward described the gathering at the Kotel on 4 October 2013 (Rosh Chodesh Cheshvan) [...] "the calmest prayer service in months".|$|E
2500|$|Before {{the game}} against Philadelphia, Brown told his players that Cleveland's {{successful}} {{years in the}} AAFC were at stake against the Eagles. [...] "There's not only this season at stake, but four years of achievements", he told them. [...] "I'm <b>asking</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> dedicate yourselves to preserving the reputation the Browns have made". The Eagles punted after their first drive stalled, and Cleveland's Don Phelps returned the kick 64 yards for a touchdown. The score was called back on a clipping penalty, however. Groza injured his arm on the play and sat {{out the rest of}} the game. Philadelphia made the first score of the game, a 17-yard field goal by Cliff Patton. The Browns tried to respond with a field goal of their own, but Chubby Grigg, substituting for Groza, missed the attempt. Jones scored a touchdown later in the first quarter on a pass from Graham, putting Cleveland in the lead. Another touchdown pass from Graham to Lavelli at the end of the second quarter put Cleveland ahead 14–3 at halftime. The Browns extended the lead on their first possession of the third quarter, an 80-yard drive capped by a short touchdown pass to end Mac Speedie. Turnovers by Philadelphia and then by the Browns set up a touchdown for the Eagles at the beginning of the fourth quarter to narrow Cleveland's lead to 11 points. The Browns added two touchdowns toward the end of the game, the first on a one-yard quarterback sneak by Graham and the second a short run by Bumgardner that was set up by a Lahr interception. The Browns had 316 passing yards and 141 rushing yards in the 35–10 win. A crowd of 71,237 people saw the game, an attendance record in Philadelphia and the ninth-largest in professional football history at the time. NFL commissioner Bert Bell named Graham the team's most valuable player and gave him a trophy, calling the Browns [...] "the greatest team to ever play the game". Neale congratulated the Browns on the win, but critiqued the team for its reliance on passing, equating it to a basketball team. Brown said the team would not gloat over the victory, citing a long season ahead.|$|E
