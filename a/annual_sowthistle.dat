40|$|<b>Annual</b> <b>sowthistle</b> {{has become}} more {{abundant}} under no-till systems in southern Australia. Increased knowledge of germination biology of <b>annual</b> <b>sowthistle</b> would facilitate development of effective weed control programs. The effects of environmental factors on germination and emergence of <b>annual</b> <b>sowthistle</b> seeds were examined in laboratory and field experiments. Seeds of <b>annual</b> <b>sowthistle</b> were able to germinate over {{a broad range of}} temperatures (25 / 15, 20 / 12, and 15 / 9 C day/night temperatures). Seed germination was favored by light; however, some germination occurred in the dark as well. Greater than 90 % of seeds germinated at a low level of salinity (40 mM NaCl), and some seeds germinated even at 160 mM NaCl (7. 5 %). Germination decreased from 95 % to 11 % as osmotic potential increased from 0 to - 0. 6 MPa and was completely inhibited at osmotic potential greater than - 0. 6 MPa. Seed germination was greater than 90 % over a pH range of 5 to 8, but declined to 77 % at pH 10. Seedling emergence was the greatest (77 %) for seeds present on the soil surface but declined with depth, and no seedlings emerged from a soil depth of 5 cm. In another experiment in which seeds were after-ripened at different depths in a field, seed decay was greater on the soil surface than at 2 or 5 cm depth. At the end of the growing season, there was a much greater persistence of buried seed (32 to 42 %) than seeds present on the soil surface (8 %). Greater persistence of buried seed could be due to dormancy enforced by dark in this species...|$|E
40|$|Several phytopathogenic fungi {{have been}} {{proposed}} for biocontrol of weeds, but few have been used. Recent studies were conducted to develop integrated biocontrol strategies {{using a combination of}} low-dose mycoherbicides and the Phytotoxins they produce. This chapter describes the chemical and the biological characterization of Phytotoxins produced by some Ascochyta, Pyrenophora and Phoma species proposed for the biocontrol of weeds (fat hen, <b>annual</b> grasses and <b>sowthistle)</b> infesting important agrarian crops, such as maize, sugar beet and cereals. Furthermore, the importance of Phytotoxins in developing integrated weed control strategies is discusse...|$|R
40|$|Differences in {{periodicity}} {{and depth}} of weed seedling recruitment due to agronomic management practices, such as reduced tillage, have implications for weed competitive ability and management strategies. Periodicity {{and depth of}} seedling recruitment of 10 different weed species was measured {{in the field in}} 2004 and 2005. The seedling recruitment of rigid ryegrass, threehorn bedstraw, and wild radish seedlings was higher under minimum tillage than under no-till scenarios. In contrast, the seedling recruitment of Oriental mustard, <b>annual</b> <b>sowthistle,</b> squirreltail fescue, little mallow, and turnipweed was higher under the no-till system. The seedling recruitment of wild oat and African mustard was not influenced by the tillage system. The mean seedling recruitment depth of wild oat, rigid ryegrass, threehorn bedstraw, wild radish, and turnipweed was greater under minimum tillage than under the no-till system. These weeds are able to emerge from deeper in the soil profile. In contrast, the seedling recruitment depth under minimum-tillage and no-till systems was similar for African mustard, Oriental mustard, <b>annual</b> <b>sowthistle,</b> little mallow, and squirreltail fescue. These are all small-seeded species, which failed to emerge from deeper depths under either tillage system. In addition, all of these species except African mustard showed higher total seedling recruitment under the no-till system. Results of this study will facilitate weed-control timing decisions and provide validation data for weed seedling recruitment models. Bhagirath S. Chauhan, Gurjeet Gill, and Christopher Presto...|$|E
40|$|Two {{rates of}} Raptor {{herbicide}} were evaluated for late winter weed control in alfalfa {{in combination with}} various types of surfactancts, the insecticide Furadan, and other alfalfa herbicides with known limited control spectrums. Herbicides that were combined with Raptor were also evaluated separately, as was Pursuit. Effects of treatments on wild oats, littleseed canarygrass and <b>annual</b> <b>sowthistle</b> were obtained. Treatments containing the active ingredient clethodim (Select/Prism) reduced canarygrass height and reproduction, while Raptor treatments increased numbers of inflorescences. No treatment provided effective control of sowthistle although some activity was noted from the Raptor treatments when numbers of reproductive structures and height were examined. Surfactants/ adjuvants greatly increased Raptor activity. Wild oat control was noted in treatments containing clethodim and several Raptor treatments when utilizing a surfactant/adjuvant...|$|E
40|$|<b>Annual</b> <b>sowthistle</b> (Sonchus oleraceus) {{has been}} {{reported}} to produce allelopathic effects. Two greenhouse experiments were conducted to estimate the allelopathic potential of both plant residue and root exudates of S. oleraceus on flavonoid composition and nodulation in a leguminous crop, Trifolium alexandrinum, and in two leguminous weeds, Melilotus indicus and T. resupinatum. The results of high performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS/MS) showed that all three legumes contained six flavonoid aglycones: apigenin, daidzein, kaempferol, luteolin, myricetin and quercetin; and seven flavonoid glycosides: daidzin, genistin, hesperidin, hyperoside, kaempferol- 7 -O-glucoside, naringin and rutin. In general, both plant residue and root exudates had inhibitory effects on the flavonoid composition and nodulation of the target species. However, residue of S. oleraceus caused a significant increase in both individual and total detected flavonoids in T. alexandrinum. The results suggest that the phytotoxins released from S. oleraceus may restrain the biosynthesis of flavonoids in the target species, whereas the accumulated flavonoids in T. alexandrinum are allelopathic-induced metabolites and suggest a resistance mode in this crop...|$|E
40|$|Simazine {{loss from}} soil to surface runoff water produce both a {{decrease}} in the effectiveness of the soil chemical treatment and a water quality hazard in receiving waters. Simazine has been found in 30 % of wells sampled in Fresno and Tulare counties, California and some contamination has been attributed to simazine use in citrus orchards. Contamination of receiving water from herbicides could put important weed control tools at risk and potentially increase risks to human health. In order to better understand the off-site movement of herbicides, studies were conducted in citrus orchards to evaluate weed control efficacy under selected weed management practices and to measure selected management practices for mitigating preemergent herbicide movement in rainfall runoff from citrus orchard middles. The results showed weed management practices that avoid broadcast application of preemergent herbicides during the rainy season were as effective as the standard rate at 2. 0 lb ai /acre for weed control by using spray application to the entire orchard floor. The most common weed species included: spotted spurge, common groundsel, horseweed, <b>annual</b> <b>sowthistle,</b> and purple cudweed. Common groundsel is found to be resistant to preemergence application. Modifying how preemergence herbicides are used to control weeds is becoming increasingly important to protect th...|$|E
40|$|Solarization is {{a method}} of soil {{disinfestation}} that relies upon high temperatures to reduce populations of pest organisms in the soil (Stapleton and De Vay 1986). Soil temperatures above 45 C {{have been found to}} reduce emergence of seeds of annual weed species (Horowitz et al. 1983, Peachey et al. 2001). While solarization has promise as a potential alternative to soil fumigation, specific guidelines for treatment are lacking (Stapleton et al. 2000). Time and temperature requirements for thermal death have already been determined for seeds of six weed species (<b>annual</b> <b>sowthistle,</b> barnyardgrass, black nightshade, common purslane, London rocket, and tumble pigweed) at temperatures reached during solarization (Dahlquist et al. 2007). We determined the time required for thermal death for seeds of two additional weed species, yellow starthistle (Centaurea solstitialis L.) and black mustard (Brassica nigra L.), at 50 C. Seeds were placed in organdy bags and allowed to imbibe water at room temperature for 2 hours before heat treatment. Seed bags were placed in 0. 47 -L mason-type canning jars filled with 30 -grit silica sand wetted to field capacity (10. 4 % moisture) with deionized water and maintained at 50 C in a water bath. Six jars per species were maintained at 50 C, and three jars were kept at room temperature as controls. In each experiment, three to four bags of seeds were placed i...|$|E
40|$|A "double-tent " {{solarization}} technique, which develops higher {{soil temperatures}} than solarization of open fields, was recently {{approved by the}} California Department of Food and Agriculture (CDFA) as a nematicidal treatment for containerized nursery production. The technique was tested for effect as an herbicidal treatment. Laboratory-derived thermal death dosages (temperature x time) for six weed species important in California [Portulaca oleracea (common purslane), Amaranthus albus (tumble pigweed), Sonchus oleraceus (<b>annual</b> <b>sowthistle),</b> Sisymbrium irio (London rocket), Solanum nigrum (black nightshade), and Echinochloa crus-galli (barnyardgrass) ] were determined, as previously reported. In a field validation of the laboratory data, moist soil which was placed in black polyethylene (poly) planting bags containing seeds of the six test species was subjected to 24 hours of solarization after reaching a threshold temperature of 60 C (2 hours after initiation of the experiment). Other samples of weed seeds were incubated under ambient temperature (ca. 23 C). Samples were removed at 2, 4, 20, and 24 hours after reaching the 60 C threshold. They were then incubated at ca. 7 C for 12 weeks to ameliorate possible secondary dormancy effects. After the cold treatment, seeds were moistened and incubated at a temperature regimen of 16 hours at 30 C and 8 hours at 20 C, with exposure to a fluorescent grow-light during the 30 C cycle. Apart from the non-solarized control treatment, no weed seeds germinated {{at any of the}} sampling periods, in accordance with the laboratory thermal death data. The "double-tent " solarization technique may be useful to many growers of containerized plants in warmer areas of California...|$|E
