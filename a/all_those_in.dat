A.×wherryi showed the same pattern, as it also contains chromosomes from both of those species. A specimen of A.stotleri was subsequently shown to form the same chromatograms as well. This showed that it was not descended to A.pinnatifidum, whose chromatograms contain compounds inherited from walking fern (A.rhizophyllum), and verified that A.stotleri was simply a form of A.bradleyi. Allozyme analysis in the 1980s also supported these hybrid origins of A.bradleyi.|$|E

25|$|One of the Conservatives' key {{policy areas}} of 2010 was {{to reduce the}} number of people in the UK {{claiming}} state benefits, and increase the number of people in the workforce. They have stated that <b>all</b> <b>those</b> <b>in</b> the UK claiming incapacity benefit will face a review of their cases. Until 1999, Conservatives opposed the creation of a national minimum wage, citing that they believed it would cost jobs, and businesses would be reluctant to start business in the UK from fear of high labour costs. However the party have since pledged support and in the July 2015 budget, Chancellor George Osborne announced a national living wage of £9/hour, to be introduced by 2020, for those aged 25 and over. They support, and have implemented, the restoration of the link between pensions and earnings, and seek to raise retirement age from 65 to 66.|$|E
25|$|Anselm held {{a council}} at Lambeth Palace {{which found that}} Henry's beloved Matilda had not {{technically}} become a nun and was thus eligible to wed and become queen. On Michaelmas in 1102, Anselm {{was finally able to}} convene a general church council at London, establishing the Gregorian Reform within England. The council prohibited marriage, concubinage, and drunkenness to <b>all</b> <b>those</b> <b>in</b> holy orders, condemned sodomy and simony, and regulated clerical dress. Anselm also obtained a resolution against the British slave trade. Henry supported Anselm's reforms and his authority over the English church, but continued to assert his own authority over Anselm. Upon their return, the three bishops he had dispatched on his second delegation to the pope claimed—in defiance of Paschal's sealed letter to Anselm, his public acts, and the testimony of the two monks who had accompanied them—that the pontiff had been receptive to Henry's counsel and secretly approved of Anselm's submission to the crown. In 1103, then, Anselm consented to journey himself to Rome, along with the king's envoy William Warelwast. Anselm supposedly travelled in order to argue the king's case for a dispensation but, in response to this third mission, Paschal fully excommunicated the bishops who had accepted investment from Henry, though sparing the king himself.|$|E
25|$|David II's {{liberation from}} hostage in 1357 {{did not come}} without conditions, {{one of which was}} that Edward would hold on to the lands in the {{southeast}} of the country; this ensured that Dryburgh and the other border abbeys stayed in English held territory. David allowed the abbeys to keep their Scottish possessions and did not interfere with the canons and monks from receiving the income from those. Dryburgh's records had all been lost at this time and it is only from what is known at Melrose that Dryburgh's position can be traced. The wool export trade and the resultant customs duty was important to David and so the Border abbeys who produced large amounts of wool were encouraged to use the Scottish ports and at the expense of Edward's Berwick. The 1360s and 1370s saw the English hold over the Border areas diminish until it was basically the castles at Berwick, Jedburgh and Roxburgh with the county of Berwick and {{the eastern part of the}} county of Roxburgh still in their grip. Pressure on these bastions intensified during 1384 and 1385 and Scottish raiding parties moved deep into England forcing Richard II to launch his army on a hugely damaging incursion through the Borders to Edinburgh which he burned. On the way he ordered the sacking of Dryburgh, Melrose and Newbattle. It was while Richard was in Newbattle Wood in August 1385 that he took reprisals against <b>all</b> <b>those</b> <b>in</b> Teviotdale who had returned to the Scottish cause.|$|E

500|$|In 1222, {{along with}} the Archbishop of Canterbury and the Bishop of Norwich, Hugh ordered that <b>all</b> <b>those</b> <b>in</b> their dioceses refrain from contact with Jews. This decree, however, was {{countermanded}} by a royal decree to the county sheriffs in the affected dioceses ordering them to imprison any residents who refused to interact with Jews. Besides these activities, Hugh was active in his diocese, including supervising the various monastic houses within it. In 1227, a visitation to Eynsham Abbey resulted in Hugh deposing the abbot. Although the 12th chronicler Matthew Paris accused Hugh of being biased against monks and nuns, and even called him the [...] "untiring persecutor of monks, the hammer of canons, nuns and all the religious", {{there is little evidence}} that Hugh singled out monks for persecution. One reason for Paris' dislike of the bishop may have been the fact that the chronicler's own abbey of St Alban's had to compromise with Hugh over two legal disputes, dealing with the right to appoint to various benefices.|$|E
500|$|Christian {{churches have}} existed in Lancashire since Anglo-Saxon times. [...] Architectural {{features}} from that era have survived in StPeter's Church, and in StPatrick's Chapel, both in Heysham; churches such as StMargaret, Hornby, contain Anglo-Saxon fragments {{in the form}} of parts of crosses or carved stones. [...] Norman features are found in some of the churches, including StJohn the Evangelist, Gressingham, and StSaviour, Stydd, but almost <b>all</b> <b>those</b> <b>in</b> the list are Gothic in style. [...] Many were restored during the 19thcentury and have additions or alterations in Gothic Revival style, including StBartholomew, Colne, and StCuthbert, Halsall. [...] All but two of the churches are Anglican by denomination. The two Roman Catholic churches in the list date from the 19thcentury and are in the Gothic Revival style: Pleasington Priory, and StWalburge, Preston. [...] Most of the county is rural, but remnants of a greater industrial past remain in the larger towns of Preston and Blackburn, and in the smaller former textile towns of east Lancashire. [...] Lancashire's [...] bedrock is mainly sandstone, with limestone deposits in the north and in the area around Clitheroe, which provided the major building materials for the churches.|$|E

The explosion would have been seen from miles away, and heard from further away still.

Numerous low-income families lived {{along the banks of}} the river, despite being such a high-risk area. Residential and commercial areas were also set up along reclaimed embankments that restricted river flow. Additionally, squatters were allowed to live {{along the banks of the}} Anilao river in an area called Isle Verde. Roughly 2,500people lived on this reclaimed land prior to the flood. The majority of fatalities took place along the banks of the river, with most drowning or being buried in mud or debris. A survivor described the initial event as a gigantic wave crashing over the banks and flooding the city. Isle Verde was virtually wiped out and out of the original 2,500people that lived there, only 200survived. It became known as the [...] "Isle of Death" [...] to survivors. Residents reported hundreds of bodies floating down rivers in the area. The force of the water and mud was enough to crack the walls of city hall. Nearly 3,000homes were destroyed and more than 11,000others were damaged. In the city alone, officials confirmed that 4,922people were killed and another 1,8573,000were left missing. Additionally, 3,020people were injured. The majority of those missing were likely swept out to sea by the flood and presumed dead. Two days after the storm, several bodies of those swept out to sea washed back ashore. Officials stated that the death toll could have been in the tens of thousands had the flood occurred at night rather than in the middle of the day.|$|E
