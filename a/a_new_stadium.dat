5|$|Off the field, the Mariners' AL West {{championship}} {{as well as}} its memorable run in {{the postseason}} served as a catalyst for public funding for a new ballpark. Less than two weeks before the tiebreaker, the residents of King County, Washington (whose county seat is Seattle) voted against a sales tax increase to fund <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>stadium,</b> but shortly after their ALDS victory, the Washington State Legislature reconvened and approved a separate funding package for <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>stadium.</b> The new stadium, now called Safeco Field, opened in July 1999.|$|E

5|$|York City F.C. ceased {{ownership}} of their Bootham Crescent {{ground in the}} summer of 1999, after the club's real property assets were transferred to a holding company called Bootham Crescent Holdings. The club secured a £2million loan from the Football Stadia Improvement Fund (FSIF) to buy the ground in February 2004. The terms of this loan required the club to identify a site for <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>stadium</b> by 2007, and have detailed planning permission by 2009, to avoid financial penalties. Once plans for <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>stadium</b> were in place, the loan would turn into a grant to assist in funding the relocation.|$|E

5|$|Following the {{construction}} of newer, relatively luxurious minor league ballparks, Greer Stadium had fallen below the standards set for Triple-A stadiums by professional baseball in 1990. At the time, team president Larry Schmittou tried to convince the city to approve a new ballpark, but was unsuccessful. Throughout the 2000s, the team continued in its attempts to gather approval and financing for a new ballpark to replace Greer. At one point, <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>stadium,</b> First Tennessee Field, was planned for construction {{on the west bank}} of the Cumberland River in downtown. Disagreements over who would pay for the ballpark repeatedly pushed back opening day at the stadium, and eventually resulted in the cancellation of the project altogether. In the meantime, numerous upgrades and repairs, including over $2.5million worth of improvements from 2008 to 2009, were made to Greer in order to preserve its functionality until <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>stadium</b> could be built. A deal for such a new ballpark was achieved in late 2013. The Sounds played their final game at Greer on August 27, 2014.|$|E
