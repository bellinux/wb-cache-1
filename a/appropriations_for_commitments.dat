40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to suggest the {{adoption}} of an "evidence based" approach in the analysis of CAP expenditure. The debate on CAP expenditure is generally based on ex-ante images of the budget as presented in the Multiannual Financial Framework and, before each financial year, on the budget <b>appropriations</b> <b>for</b> <b>commitments.</b> But this differs significantly from the actual payments as recorded ex-post in the Financial Reports. These differences are mainly concentrated on structural policies (such as regional and rural development policy), while they do not exist, or are minimal, in the mere transfer policies (such as in Pillar 1 of the CAP). Based as it is on a partial and distorted image of the expenditure, the analysis and discussion on the CAP reform is distorted as well. CAP expenditure, financial reports, evidence based approach, CAP reform, Agricultural and Food Policy, H 5, F 5,...|$|E
40|$|The {{following}} report presents {{projections of}} year-end revenues and expenditures. Projections are determined using actual (unaudited) data from July 2009 through September 2009, or through accounting period three, and departmental information regarding spending trends and operations. This report includes discussion of year-end projections that vary {{significantly from the}} current budget for the General Fund and other budgeted funds with staff. For this report, a significant variance is defined as under or over budget revenues or expenditures of $ 500, 000 or greater. GENERAL FUND Earlier this fiscal year, the Chief Financial Officer instituted a new procedure regarding the treatment of prior year encumbrances. The City of San Diego has historically used prior year budgets {{as a means to}} preserve <b>appropriations</b> <b>for</b> encumbered <b>commitments</b> that are in place {{at the end of a}} fiscal year. These prior year budgets were held separate from the current year budget and not previously included in monitoring reports. This is inconsistent with best practices and creates difficulties for tracking and monitoring. Beginning with Fiscal Year 2010, the practice of maintaining a separate, prior year budget has been discontinued. All financial activity will be captured and reported as current year activity. In addition, the practice of carrying forwar...|$|R
