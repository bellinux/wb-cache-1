40|$|The mission <b>and</b> <b>vision</b> of {{companies}} have been gaining {{a lot of attention}} both within the scholarly and business context. A lot of time and money is being invested to develop and implement mission <b>and</b> <b>vision</b> statements <b>and</b> business students {{all over the world are}} taught these concepts. However, literature on how mission <b>and</b> <b>vision</b> actually influence employees is limited and inconsistent. Therefore, this thesis explores how mission <b>and</b> <b>vision</b> influence employees’ work motivation. The study follows an inductive approach and has a qualitative nature. In order to build a basis for the research, various literatures on mission <b>and</b> <b>vision</b> <b>and</b> motivational theories are reviewed. Data was collected by the conduction of twelve interviews with employees in different job positions. The semi structured character of the interviews implied the use of templates to analyze the data. Thereby, categories and codes were developed and relationships between the individual motivation and the influence of mission <b>and</b> <b>vision</b> were identified. The results show that the influence of mission <b>and</b> <b>vision</b> cannot be generalized but is highly dependent on individual aspects. Intrinsically motivated employees are positively influenced by their company’s mission <b>and</b> <b>vision.</b> Hence, mission <b>and</b> <b>vision</b> can push intrinsic motivation. On the other hand, the motivating influence of a mission <b>and</b> <b>vision</b> is rather low on extrinsically motivated employees. Interestingly, the findings also show that mission <b>and</b> <b>vision</b> play a greater role for people in higher positions (top & middle managers). Front line employees are rather extrinsically motivated and less dedicated to their company’s mission <b>and</b> <b>vision.</b> The results contribute to existing literature by encouraging a more differentiated approach for dealing with the topic in taking the individual component into consideration. Furthermore, the findings bear potential for employers to apply and communicate their mission <b>and</b> <b>vision</b> more purposefully to motivate employees...|$|R

Practitioners and academics alike agree that employee motivation <b>and</b> <b>vision</b> <b>and</b> organizational learning are important determinants of service quality and subsequently customer satisfaction and loyalty. Utilizing a framework suggested by the resource-based view of the firm, this empirical study investigated the effects of employee motivation <b>and</b> <b>vision</b> <b>and</b> organizational learning on perceived service quality in a service firm (Radisson Hotels Worldwide). The results of this research show that both employee motivation <b>and</b> <b>vision</b> <b>and</b> organizational learning positively affect perceived service quality.

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.), Edward R. Murrow School of Communication, Washington State UniversityOrganizational mission <b>and</b> <b>vision</b> play {{important}} roles {{in the life of}} an organization and well-being of its employees. While many researchers have studied mission <b>and</b> <b>vision</b> from leadership perspectives, little is known about employee constructions of their organization's mission <b>and</b> <b>vision.</b> Unlike previous research which approached mission <b>and</b> <b>vision</b> from rhetorical <b>and</b> socio-cultural perspectives, this study builds on a social constructionist foundation. Based on individual interviews with 45 employees from 22 organizations, this study seeks to understand how employees construct vision (in particular, the ideal future state of the organization, general values related to the ideal state, <b>and</b> authorship/source of <b>vision)</b> <b>and</b> mission (in particular, organization's reason for being, uniqueness, possible changes, customers, clients, market segments, products, services, economic concerns, specific values related to its present operations, and ownership of the mission). This study also addresses the question of how employees' constructions of mission <b>and</b> <b>vision</b> compare with the official versions of mission <b>and</b> <b>vision.</b> To answer the question, the author conducted a thematic analysis of employee responses as compared to official mission <b>and</b> <b>vision</b> statements found on organizations' Web sites. Results indicate lack of congruence between official and employee constructions of organizational mission <b>and</b> <b>vision.</b> This study suggests that the lack of congruence is due to poor communication of vision/mission by leaders, low employee awareness of the advantages of knowing vision/mission, employees' perceptions of vision/mission as irrelevant to daily work, and observed discrepancy between vision/mission and leaders' actions. These findings have important practical implications for organizational professionals. The study makes a significant contribution to mission <b>and</b> <b>vision</b> literature, as well as research on employee perceptions, employee alignment, organizational identification, and organizational control.

Objective: Describe the hearing <b>and</b> <b>vision</b> of home care patients older than 80 years. Methods: Ninety-three older adults (80 + years) receiving home care were screened for hearing <b>and</b> <b>vision</b> in their homes. Data were collected using a HEINE Mini 3000 ® Otoscope to examine the eardrum and presence of earwax, an Entomed SA 201 -IV portable pure-tone audiometer to measure the pure-tone average (PTAV), a logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution chart to measure visual acuity (VA), and the Combined Serious Sensory Impairment interview guide. Results: Slight and moderate hearing impairments were found in 41 % and 47 % of the population, respectively (mean PTAV = 40. 4 dB for the better ear), and 40 % and 56 % had impaired <b>and</b> slightly impaired <b>vision,</b> respectively (mean VA = 0. 45 for the better eye). The participants' self-assessments of hearing <b>and</b> <b>vision</b> were only weakly correlated with PTAV and VA values.

5|$|Heathenry {{does not}} have a unified {{theology}} and is typically polytheistic, centering on a pantheon of deities from pre-Christian Germanic Europe. It adopts cosmological views from these religions, including an animistic view of the cosmos in which the natural world is imbued with spirits. The faith's deities and these spirits are honored in sacrificial rites known as blóts in which food and libations are offered to them. These are often accompanied by symbel, the act of ceremonially toasting the gods with an alcoholic beverage. Some practitioners also engage in rituals designed to induce an altered state of consciousness <b>and</b> <b>visions,</b> most notably seiðr and galdr, with the intent of gaining wisdom and advice from the deities. Although many solitary practitioners follow the religion by themselves, members of the Heathen community often assemble in small groups, usually known as kindreds or hearths, to perform their rites outdoors or in specially constructed buildings. Heathen ethical systems emphasize honor, personal integrity, and loyalty, while beliefs about an afterlife vary and are rarely emphasized.|$|E

40|$|The {{world is}} globalising, {{we are living}} in an {{information}} society, consumption has acquired new content and form. Mankind has reached an era where needs and consumption no longer have a direct connection and through acquiring things we do not satisfy our direct needs but rather buy affiliation, status and contentment. Thus today’s retailing organisations have an important role to play in moulding and directing contemporary culture. In the thesis titled “Mission <b>and</b> <b>Vision</b> in retailing – based on Sportland Eesti AS’s example” the author examined mission <b>and</b> <b>vision</b> in retailing. A word is the simplest way of expressing thoughts generated from feelings and the utmost chance of amplifying them. It has been proven that word and thought have immense power, however mission <b>and</b> <b>vision</b> are the expression of a company’s existence put into words. The thesis’ main problems were: what are mission <b>and</b> <b>vision,</b> <b>and</b> how mission <b>and</b> <b>vision</b> affect the creation of a company’s strategy, concept and sales environment, positioning and differentiation from competitors. Mission <b>and</b> <b>vision</b> in retailing were viewed in the context of Sportland Eesti AS. Sportland Eesti AS is a part of Sportland International Group AS, where the subjects of mission <b>and</b> <b>vision</b> are paid considerable attention. The author’s long-term and tight relationship with Sportland most probably affected the distancing of the thesis {{but on the other hand}} it provided the possibility of contrasting theory and practical processes. The theoretical definition of mission <b>and</b> <b>vision,</b> <b>and</b> the connected themes played an important role in the thesis. The author’s analysis of Sportland’s mission, <b>vision</b> <b>and</b> values was based on a discourse analysis and in order to determine the opinions of Estonian retailing experts on mission <b>and</b> <b>vision</b> the author conducted and expert semi structured expert interview with them. The thesis alternates with the theoretical, literature based approach to mission <b>and</b> <b>vision</b> <b>and</b> the connected realms, phenomenon, activities etc and the author’s analysis and comments about Sportland and an overview of the opinions and citations from the interviews conducted with the Estonian retailing experts. In the first chapter the author gives a short overview of the Estonian retailing development over the past fifteen years. The development found longer coverage with the aim to find the breaking point where supply exceeded the demand. That very point may be considered to be the moment of entering a consumer society where the success and failure of companies is affected by different factors than before and where the subjects of mission <b>and</b> <b>vision</b> become presumably more important. The second chapter consisted of ponderings over the term consumer society with the help of different authors. The author also covered the development of the Sportland store chain from 1997 to the present day and gave an overview of the company’s structure. In the last part of the second chapter the author reviewed strategic planning. The third chapter described the thesis methodology. In the beginning of the chapter a short overview is given of the discourse analysis that was used to analyse Sportland’s mission, <b>vision</b> <b>and</b> values; the choice of interviewees, interview questions and other issues connected with the interviews were also covered. The fourth chapter is dedicated to mission <b>and</b> <b>vision.</b> In the first part of the chapter the author gives the theoretical definition of mission, then brings out the connections between mission and the power of word and thought and lastly analyses the mission of Sportland. The second part of the chapter covers vision. The chapter is concluded by the analysis of the interviews with the Estonian retailing experts. The fifth chapter reviews organisational values and structure and sixth positioning and its connections with mission <b>and</b> <b>vision.</b> The seventh chapter views concept and the development of the retailing environment, and the importance of mission <b>and</b> <b>vision</b> at that. Based on Sportland Eesti AS it could be said that a clearly worded mission <b>and</b> <b>vision</b> are a strong basis for the development of a retailer’s strategy, concept and the retailing environment and the clear-sighted and meaningful organisation of daily work. It is also clear that mission <b>and</b> <b>vision</b> aid in the differentiation from competitors. In principle all interviewed retailing experts considered the subject of mission <b>and</b> <b>vision</b> as the general basis for organising a company’s activities to be important, however, the opinions differed in the sense of how much the subject is paid attention to in Estonian retailing companies and how much attention should be paid to it. Based on the development of Sportland Eesti AS, it could be said that paying attention to those questions became actual in 2000. Also all interviewees agreed that in the 1990 s the subject of mission <b>and</b> <b>vision</b> had no practical value in Estonia and that the importance started increasing in 2000 when competition had become tighter. All interviewees also noted that through tightening competition also the importance of the so called softer issues becomes more important for the comapnies. Taking into consideration the volume of the thesis, it was not possible to cover all aspects connected with mission <b>and</b> <b>vision.</b> The discussion included a somewhat more thorough overview of the possible development directions of the thesis. The author was forced to leave out marketing in retailing and its connections to mission <b>and</b> <b>vision,</b> since the marketing subject itself is very extensive. The author also didn’t cover the subject of mission <b>and</b> <b>vision</b> from the aspect of human resources, i. e. the communication of the mission <b>and</b> <b>vision</b> to the organisation members and by the members...|$|R
