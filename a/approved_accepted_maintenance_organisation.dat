40|$|Unavailability of {{technical}} systems, such as aircraft, is expensive. Technical systems require maintenance {{to prevent and}} to remedy defects that cause unavailability. Users {{of technical}} systems usually bear {{the consequences of the}} risk of unavailability, in particular the loss of productivity. This is based on the presumption that users are best able to insure the risks, although <b>maintenance</b> <b>organisations</b> may be more capable to mitigate the risks. The risks are seldom allocated to <b>maintenance</b> <b>organisations</b> because users and <b>maintenance</b> <b>organisations</b> tend to have conflicting objectives. This raises the questions if a <b>maintenance</b> <b>organisation</b> can be motivated to pursue the objective of the user. This would be possible if the <b>maintenance</b> <b>organisation</b> is rewarded for the “commercial success of the user of the technical system”. If the <b>maintenance</b> <b>organisation</b> indeed pursues the objective of the user of the technical system, the <b>maintenance</b> <b>organisation</b> can make autonomous decisions about the maintenance activities. And if the <b>maintenance</b> <b>organisation</b> can make decisions, it can make investments in measures to mitigate risks, knowing that it can decide if these measures will be employed. This research shows that it is efficient and effective to transfer the risks of the unavailability of a technical system from the user to the <b>maintenance</b> <b>organisation</b> on the condition that the <b>maintenance</b> <b>organisation</b> (a) will be compensated for the risks of unavailability, (b) will be rewarded for the contribution of the technical system to the commercial success of the user, and (c) is assigned the required decision rights. This will in practice require new “collaborative” contracts {{that can be used for}} the supply of long-term maintenance services of technical systems where unavailability causes a significant economic risk, for example in aircraft maintenance.

40|$|Despite {{extensive}} research on future manufacturing and the forthcoming fourth industrial revolution (implying extensive digitalisation), {{there is a}} lack of understanding regarding the specific changes that can be expected for <b>maintenance</b> <b>organisations.</b> Therefore, developing scenarios for future maintenance is needed to define long-term strategies for the realisation of digitalised manufacturing. This empirical Delphi-based scenario planning study is the first within the maintenance realm, examining a total of 34 projections about potential changes to the internal and external environment of <b>maintenance</b> <b>organisations,</b> considering both hard (technological) and soft (social) dimensions. The paper describes a probable future of <b>maintenance</b> <b>organisations</b> in digitalised manufacturing in the year 2030, based on an extensive three-round Delphi survey with 25 maintenance experts at strategic level from the largest companies within the Swedish manufacturing industry. In particular, the study contributes with development of probable as well as wildcard scenarios for future maintenance. This includes e. g. advancement of data analytics, increased emphasis on education and training, novel principles for maintenance planning with a systems perspective, and stronger environmental legislation and standards. The scenarios may serve as direct input to strategic development in industrial <b>maintenance</b> <b>organisations</b> and are expected to substantially improve preparedness to the changes brought by digitalised manufacturing...|$|R

40|$|Digitalisation is {{the future}} of the {{manufacturing}} industry, and it will entail production systems that are highly automated, efficient, and flexible. The realisation of such systems will require effective <b>maintenance</b> <b>organisations</b> that adopt engineering approaches, e. g. engineering tools and methods.

Through a survey study in 70 Swedish manufacturing companies, this study shows to what extent engineering tools and methods are used in <b>maintenance</b> <b>organisations,</b> as well as to what extent companies have maintenance engineers performing work related to engineering tools and methods. Overall, the results indicate a potential for increasing the use of engineering tools and methods in both the operational and the design and development phase.

This is the case also for maintenance management IT (MMIT), i. e. applications used for maintenance management purposes such as computerised maintenance management systems (CMMS) and maintenance management or asset management modules in enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems. Although, models and methods for evaluating maintenance IT needs and IT systems are not well developed. This paper shows how the IT maturity of the <b>maintenance</b> <b>organisation</b> could {{be considered in the}} IT procurement process. If we are able to define functionality for different levels of IT maturity, the assessment and selection of the relatively best IT application for the <b>maintenance</b> <b>organisation</b> would be supported. A model describing three phases of IT maturity within maintenance (IT beginners, medium IT users and IT mature organisations) forms the theoretical basis. The applicability of the approach is tested by evaluating 24 CMMS and enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems. The original pulication is available at www. springerlink. com. </p...|$|R

The company sees economic gains in the future by becoming an approved organisation that follows the European Aviation Safety Agency guidelines (EASA) and meets the requirements outlined in the rules of Part-M. In order for the company to become an approved organization, responsible for continuing airworthiness of aircraft, a handbook should be presented to the local authority. This handbook describes the company’s responsibility for the continuing airworthiness in order for the authorities to get an insight into the company and its work. This thesis resulted in a draft of CAME (Continuing Airworthiness Management Exposition) and this draft has been approved by Priority Aero Maintenance.
