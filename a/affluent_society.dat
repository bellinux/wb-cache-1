25|$|After the {{beginning}} of the Great Recession of 2008, Galbraith's The Great Crash, 1929 (1955) and other books containing warnings about the dangers of an unrestrained speculative mood without proper government oversight found an attentive readership again. In 2010, the Library of America published a new edition of Galbraith's major works, edited by his son, James K. Galbraith: The <b>Affluent</b> <b>Society</b> & Other Writings, 1952–1967: American Capitalism, The Great Crash, 1929, The <b>Affluent</b> <b>Society,</b> and The New Industrial State. On this occasion, Bill Moyers interviewed James K. Galbraith about his father, his works, and his legacy.|$|E
25|$|In The <b>Affluent</b> <b>Society</b> (1958), {{which became}} a bestseller, Galbraith {{outlined}} his view that to become successful, post-World War II America should make large investments in items such as highways and education, using funds from general taxation.|$|E
25|$|His work {{included}} several best selling books throughout the fifties and sixties. His major {{contribution to the}} field of economics is the so-called American capitalism trilogy: The <b>Affluent</b> <b>Society</b> (1958), The New Industrial State (1967), and Economics and the Public Purpose (1973). Written in a clear and concise style, they were comprehensible to lay readers, not just economists.|$|E
40|$|Abstract Research in {{marketing}} has neglected economic scarcity in <b>affluent</b> <b>societies,</b> {{with a few}} exceptions. Many affluent states are today facing financial difficulties and a global belief in the market as self-regulating, and in de-regulation {{have led to a}} focus on consumer agency. This has also contributed to a widening gap regarding opportunities to consume in <b>affluent</b> <b>societies.</b> The {{purpose of this article is}} to bring attention to the importance of considering economic scarcity in <b>affluent</b> <b>societies</b> among marketers in studies on consumption by using theoretical concepts from welfare studies such as inclusion and exclusion, participation and inequality. Researchers who ignore the consequences of the lower strata in the income hierarchy disregard the complexity of consumption. It is argued that regardless of income, we are all consumers, but with different opportunities and abilities. The hegemony of free choice needs to be challenged...|$|R

25|$|Galbraith was {{a long-time}} Harvard faculty member and stayed with Harvard University {{for half a}} century as a {{professor}} of economics. He was a prolific author and wrote four dozen books, including several novels, and published more than a thousand articles and essays on various subjects. Among his works was a trilogy on economics, American Capitalism (1952), The <b>Affluent</b> <b>Society</b> (1958), and The New Industrial State (1967). His works have been heavily criticized by leading academics like Milton Friedman, Paul Krugman and Robert Solow.|$|E

500|$|After 5000 BCE new {{waves of}} {{immigrants}} {{arrived from the}} south again, which accelerated the process of differentiation of the agrarian society into several distinct cultures {{during the first half}} of 5th millennium BC and afterwards. In the Oder River basin mostly there was the culture named after the punctured variety of Linear Band pottery - Stroked Pottery culture, while in the Vistula River basin the Lengyel and Polgár cultures appeared. The two regions developed in some separation, but within them the different cultural traditions of the younger Danubian circle often overlapped. The houses were now of an elongated trapezoidal shape, up to 40 meters long, grouped in larger complexes, often protected by beam and earth walls, moats and other fortifications, as such defensive measures apparently became necessary against people from the still Mesolithic native population or other Danubian settlements. These defensive structures, built from the mid 5th millennium BCE on, were complicated and consumed significant time and resources. Their design followed that of the similar construction that was taking place in the Danube River areas, starting in the early part of this millennium. Large cemeteries and graves supplied with fancier objects such as jewelry, including the first so-called [...] "princely" [...] graves (the princesses had imported copper necklaces, earrings and diadems in addition to locally made decorations), testify to the emergence of a relatively more <b>affluent</b> <b>society.</b> Cattle raising and trading (large varieties resulted from cross-breeding with the aurochs) and land tillage provided basic sustenance. Salt was obtained and traded and became a much sought after commodity, at first probably to help preserve stored food. The salt springs around Wieliczka were utilized already by the Lengyel culture people, who left ceramic vessels used in salt production there. The Danubian people produced many richly decorated objects, including clay containers with animal head ornaments and figurines of women.|$|E
40|$|Who has {{the duty}} to {{guarantee}} that basic human rights are fulfilled globally? This {{is one of the}} central questions in the current global justice debate. The answer to this question must be based on some principle of justice that distributes rights and duties in the global sphere. This paper analyses Thomas Pogge’s answer to this question, which does not rest on notions of charity, benevolence, or supererogatory duties, but on the negative duty not to harm the global poor. His central claim is that "we, the citizens and governments of the <b>affluent</b> <b>societies,</b> in collusion with the ruling elites of many poor countries, are harming the global poor by imposing an unjust institutional order upon them. " Although I am sympathetic to Pogge’s project, my discussion of it is mainly critical of his negative duty argument. Section 48. 2 discusses Pogge’s explanatory globalism arguing that global poverty is caused by a global institutional order, and that <b>affluent</b> <b>societies,</b> by setting up this global institutional order in an unjust way, are responsible for global poverty. Section 48. 3 describes and discusses Pogge’s argument that we, the citizens and governments of <b>affluent</b> <b>societies,</b> have a negative duty not to cause global poverty. Although Pogge’s explanatory globalism is convincing, his negative-duty argument cannot be sustained. The main problemin his argument is the unspecified "we" that have a duty: does it refer to governments of <b>affluent</b> <b>societies,</b> their citizens, or both...|$|R

2500|$|Galbraith also critiqued the {{assumption}} that continually increasing material production {{is a sign of}} economic and societal health. Because of this Galbraith is sometimes considered one of the first post-materialists. In this book, he popularized the old phrase [...] "conventional wisdom". Galbraith worked on the book while in Switzerland and had originally titled it Why The Poor Are Poor, but changed it to The <b>Affluent</b> <b>Society</b> at his wife's suggestion. The <b>Affluent</b> <b>Society</b> contributed (likely to a significant degree, given that Galbraith had the ear of President Kennedy) to the [...] "war on poverty", the government spending policy introduced by the administrations of Kennedy and Johnson.|$|E
2500|$|In The <b>Affluent</b> <b>Society</b> Galbraith {{asserts that}} {{classical}} economic theory {{was true for}} the eras before the present, which were times of [...] "poverty"; now, however, we have moved from an age of poverty to an age of [...] "affluence", and for such an age, a completely new economic theory is needed.|$|E

2500|$|Galbraith's work in general, and The <b>Affluent</b> <b>Society</b> in particular, {{have drawn}} sharp {{criticism}} from laissez-faire supporters {{since the time}} of their publications.

2500|$|Galbraith was an {{important}} figure in 20th-century institutional economics, and provided an exemplary institutionalist perspective on economic power.

As for the later works, economist and Galbraith friend Mike Sharpe visited him in 2004, on which occasion Galbraith gave Sharpe a copy {{of what would be}} Galbraith's last book, The Economics of Innocent Fraud.

2500|$|In 1953, a Parliamentary Commission {{on poverty}} {{estimated}} that 24% of Italian families were either “destitute” or “in hardship,” 21% of dwellings were overcrowded, 52% of {{homes in the}} south had no running drinking water, and only 57% had a lavatory. In the 1950s, several important reforms were launched: e.g. agrarian reform (legge Scelba), fiscal reform (legge Vanoni), and the country enjoyed a period of extraordinary economic development (miracolo economico, economic miracle). In this period of time, a massive population transfer, from the impoverished South to the booming industrial North, took place. This however exacerbated social contrasts, including between the old-established [...] "worker aristocracy" [...] and the new less qualified immigrants ("operaio-massa") of Southern origin. In addition, a wide {{gap between rich and}} poor continued to exist.

40|$|Defenders of {{suburban}} sprawl assert that sprawl is inevitable in <b>affluent</b> <b>societies,</b> based on trends in Western Europe.

This Article compares Western Europe to the United States, and criticizes the Inevitabilty Theory on the grounds that: (1) Europe is in fact far less automobile-dependent than the United States; (2) Europe has not, contrary to the Inevitability Theory 2 ̆ 7 s claims, become more car-dependent and suburbanized in recent years; and (3) Although some European sprawl did occur in the late 20 th century, some European cities 2 ̆ 7 pro-sprawl highway-building programs may be partially to blame.

40|$|The {{demographic}} {{regimes of}} modern <b>affluent</b> <b>societies</b> {{are characterized by}} long life, below-replacement fertility (sometimes, well below replacement), large and increasing proportions of elderly, and appreciable immigration from poorer areas.

In both cases, at the country level, heated contention over details disguises a fair amount of consensus on what should be done. Dealing with aging, the consensus would say, calls for raising retirement ages, somehow limiting the health care burden, and ensuring the viability of pension systems. Dealing with immigration calls for revising selection criteria, smoothing obstacles to assimilation, and controlling illicit entry. Both, it might be concluded, are fairly “easy ” problems, technically if not politically. <b>Affluent</b> <b>societies</b> also have population problems that by any measure are “difficult”: without obvious technical solution and lacking an agreed basis for policy debate.

40|$|Studies of intergenerational {{solidarity}} in <b>affluent</b> <b>societies</b> suggest that relationships between generations consist simultaneously of both emotional closeness and conflicts. This analysis extends {{the standard model}} of intergenerational relationships, which until now has been applied only to countries with bilineal kinship systems, to culturally and economically diverse areas with varying kinship systems. Latent class analysis was applied to measure affection and conflict in the ongoing relationships of young and middle-aged women with their mothers (7, 522 relationship pairs) and fathers (5, 338 relationship pairs). The empirical analysis was based on standardised oral interviews with mothers from areas in China, Indonesia, North and South India, South Africa, Palestine, Israel, Turkey, Russia, Estonia, Poland, East and West Germany, France, Jamaica, and the United States (n= 8, 756). The best fitting model of relationship differences consisted of four latent classes: 'amicable' (45 percent), 'detached' (28 percent), 'ambivalent' (22 percent), and 'disharmonious' (5 percent). Based on a cross-culturally largely invariant measurement model, results revealed significantly different distributions for fathers and mothers and across areas. Multinomial three-level regression {{analysis was used to}} analyse the complex cross-level interdependence of area effects, individual characteristics, and the respective relationship on class membership. In patrilineal societies, relationships of women with their biological parents {{are more likely to be}} ambivalent, less likely to be detached, and very likely to become disharmonious in case of spatial proximity. In <b>affluent</b> <b>societies,</b> the relationships are less likely to be disharmonious and most likely to be harmonious. Whereas the frequency of contact decreases the likelihood of detached or disharmonious relationships in <b>affluent</b> <b>societies,</b> functional exchange with the parents increases the likelihood of disharmonious relationships.

40|$|Abstract: The {{neurotoxic}} {{effects of}} fish-methylmercury (meHg) consumed regularly are considered hazardous to fetuses and newborn infants; {{as a result}} fish consumption advisories are an important asset to control meHg exposure in <b>affluent</b> <b>societies.</b> These concerns {{are now part of}} health promotion programs for Amazon subsistence villagers. While urban dwellers in <b>affluent</b> <b>societies</b> can choose an alternative nutritious diet, traditional and subsistence communities are caught up in controversial issues and lifestyle changes with unintended health consequences. Traditional fish-eating populations of industrialized and non-industrialized regions may be exposed to different neurotoxic substances: man-made pollutants and environmentally occurring meHg. Additionally, in non-industrialized countries, pregnant women and infants are still being immunized with thimerosal-containing vaccines (TCVs) which degrade to ethylmercury (etHg). Therefore, the complexity involving fish-meHg associated with wild-fish choices and Hg exposure derived from TCVs is difficult to disentangle and evaluate: are villagers able to distinguish exposure to differently hazardous chemical forms of Hg (inorganic, fish-meHg, and injected etHg) ? Is it possible that instead of helping to prevent a plausible (unperceived...|$|R
