25|$|Due to the island's {{southern}} latitude it experiences <b>Astronomical</b> <b>Twilight</b> (sun illumination is barely distinguishable at nighttime) {{for a couple}} of weeks from June to early July.|$|E
25|$|From a {{point on}} the ground at this latitude, the sun is above the horizon for 16 hours, 12 minutes during the summer {{solstice}} and 8 hours, 14 minutes during the winter solstice This latitude also roughly corresponds to the minimum latitude in which <b>astronomical</b> <b>twilight</b> can last all night near the summer solstice. Slightly less than 1/8 of the Earth's surface is north of the 49th parallel.|$|E
2500|$|The {{climate is}} mild for its {{northern}} latitude, {{due to the}} North Atlantic Current which flows northwards from mainland Norway up {{the west coast of}} Spitsbergen. It also receives heat from the predominant high pressure fronts which bring warm air from the Atlantic to the Barents Sea. The town has its lowest temperatures during February, at an average [...] and a high average of [...] during July. The sun does not set from 18 April to 24 August (midnight sun) and does not rise from 25 October to 17 February (polar night). But there is no nautical twilight between December 11 to December 30, it only has 24 hour of darkness called <b>astronomical</b> <b>twilight.</b> The site is sufficiently isolated that {{it can be used to}} measure the background pollution levels in the high Arctic troposphere.|$|E
50|$|However, {{in other}} places, {{especially}} those with skyglow, <b>astronomical</b> <b>twilight</b> may be almost indistinguishable from night. In the evening, even when <b>astronomical</b> <b>twilight</b> has yet to end {{and in the morning}} when <b>astronomical</b> <b>twilight</b> has already begun, most casual observers would consider the entire sky fully dark. Because of light pollution, observers in some localities, generally in large cities, may never have the opportunity to view even fourth-magnitude stars, irrespective of the presence of any twilight at all, and to experience truly dark skies.|$|E
50|$|Polarization {{patterns}} remain consistent {{even when}} the sun is not present in the sky. Twilight patterns are produced during the time period between the beginning of <b>astronomical</b> <b>twilight</b> ({{when the sun is}} 18° below the horizon) and sunrise, or sunset and the end of <b>astronomical</b> <b>twilight.</b> The duration of <b>astronomical</b> <b>twilight</b> depends on the length of the path taken by the sun below the horizon. Thus it depends on the time of year as well as the location, but it can last for as long as 1.5 hours.|$|E

5000|$|Morning <b>astronomical</b> <b>twilight</b> begins (astronomical dawn) {{when the}} {{geometric}} {{center of the}} sun is 18° below the horizon {{in the morning and}} ends when the geometric center of the sun is 12° below the horizon in the morning. Evening <b>astronomical</b> <b>twilight</b> begins when the geometric center of the sun is 12° below the horizon in the evening and ends (astronomical dusk) when the geometric center of the sun is 18° below the horizon in the evening.In some places (away from urban light pollution, moonlight, auroras, and other sources of light), where the sky is dark enough for nearly all astronomical observations, astronomers can easily make observations of point sources such as stars both during and after <b>astronomical</b> <b>twilight</b> in the evening and both before and during <b>astronomical</b> <b>twilight</b> in the morning. However, some critical observations, such as of faint diffuse items such as nebulae and galaxies, may require observation beyond the limit of <b>astronomical</b> <b>twilight.</b> Theoretically, the faintest stars detectable by the naked eye (those of approximately the sixth magnitude) will become visible in the evening at astronomical dusk, and become invisible at astronomical dawn.|$|E

50|$|There {{are three}} {{established}} and widely accepted subcategories of twilight: civil twilight (brightest), nautical twilight, and <b>astronomical</b> <b>twilight</b> (darkest).|$|E
5000|$|<b>Astronomical</b> <b>twilight</b> {{begins when}} the sky is no longer {{completely}} dark after astronomical dawn. This occurs when the Sun is 18 degrees below the horizon in the morning. At this point a very {{small portion of the}} sun's rays illuminate the sky and the fainter stars begin to disappear. Astronomical dawn is often indistinguishable from night, especially in areas with light pollution. Astronomical dawn marks the beginning of <b>astronomical</b> <b>twilight,</b> which lasts until nautical dawn.|$|E

5000|$|Major {{cities that}} near <b>astronomical</b> <b>twilight</b> from {{nautical}} dusk to nautical dawn: Saguenay (48°25′0"N), Brest (48°23′26"N), Thunder Bay (48°22′56″N), Vienna (48°12′30″N), Bratislava (48°8′38″N), Munich (48°8'0″N) ...|$|E
50|$|At {{the winter}} {{solstice}} within the polar circle, twilight can extend through solar noon at latitudes below 72.561° (72°33′43″) for civil twilight, 78.561° (78°33′43″) for nautical twilight, and 84.561° (84°33′43″) for <b>astronomical</b> <b>twilight.</b>|$|E
50|$|Sunset is {{distinct}} from twilight, which has three phases, the first being civil twilight, which begins once the Sun has disappeared below the horizon, and continues until it descends to 6 degrees below the horizon; the second phase is nautical twilight, between 6 and 12 degrees below the horizon; {{and the third is}} <b>astronomical</b> <b>twilight,</b> which is the period when the Sun is between 12 and 18 degrees below the horizon. Dusk is {{at the very end of}} <b>astronomical</b> <b>twilight,</b> and is the darkest moment of twilight just before night. Night occurs when the Sun reaches 18 degrees below the horizon and no longer illuminates the sky.|$|E
50|$|The astronomical {{polar night}} {{is a period}} of {{continuous}} night where no <b>astronomical</b> <b>twilight</b> occurs. <b>Astronomical</b> <b>twilight</b> happens when the Sun is between twelve and eighteen degrees below the horizon and astronomical night when it is lower than that. Thus, the astronomical polar night is limited to latitudes above 84° 34', which is exactly 18° within the polar circle, or five and a half degrees from the pole. During the astronomical polar night stars of the sixth magnitude, which are the dimmest stars visible to the naked eye, will be visible throughout the entire day. This happens when the sun is between 18 and 23.5 degrees below the horizon. These conditions last about 11 weeks at the poles.|$|E
50|$|A civil {{twilight}} {{period of about}} two weeks occurs before sunrise and after sunset, a nautical twilight period of about five weeks occurs before sunrise and after sunset and an <b>astronomical</b> <b>twilight</b> period of about seven weeks occurs before sunrise and after sunset.|$|E
50|$|The time of dusk is {{the moment}} {{at the very end}} of <b>astronomical</b> <b>twilight,</b> just before total {{darkness}} or night, or may be thought of as the darkest part of twilight.But technically, there are 3 types of dusk which are listed below.|$|E
5000|$|Astronomical dusk {{occurs when}} the sun is 18 degrees below the horizon in the evening. It marks the end of <b>astronomical</b> <b>twilight</b> which begins at {{nautical}} dusk. After this time the sun no longer illuminates the sky, and thus no longer interferes with astronomical observations.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Astronomical</b> <b>twilight</b> from {{nautical}} dusk to nautical dawn: Hulun Buir, Erdenet, Astana, Samara, Kiev, Minsk, Warsaw, Košice, Paris, Dublin, Zwettl, Prague, Stanley (Falkland Islands), Berlin, Luxembourg City, Brussels, Amsterdam, London, Cardiff, Calgary, Unalaska (Bellingham, {{largest in}} the continental USA), Rio Gallegos, and Punta Arenas.|$|E
50|$|Twilight {{is defined}} {{according}} to the solar elevation angle θs, which is {{the position of the}} geometric center of the sun relative to the horizon. There are three established and widely accepted subcategories of twilight: civil twilight (nearest the horizon), nautical twilight, and <b>astronomical</b> <b>twilight</b> (farthest from the horizon).|$|E
5000|$|Nautical dawn is {{the moment}} when the {{geometric}} center of the Sun is 12 degrees below the horizon in the morning. It is preceded by morning <b>astronomical</b> <b>twilight</b> and followed by morning nautical twilight. Nautical dusk {{is the moment}} when the geometric center of the Sun is 12 degrees below the horizon in the evening. It marks the beginning of evening <b>astronomical</b> <b>twilight</b> and the end of evening nautical twilight. Before nautical dawn and after nautical dusk, sailors cannot navigate via the horizon at sea. At nautical dawn and nautical dusk, the human eye finds it difficult, if not impossible, to discern traces of illumination near the sunset or sunrise point of the horizon ("first light” after nautical dawn but before civil dawn and [...] "nightfall" [...] after civil dusk but before nautical dusk).|$|E
5000|$|Thus, this bee is {{an example}} of an insect that can {{perceive}} polarization patterns throughout <b>astronomical</b> <b>twilight.</b> [...] Not only does this case exemplify the fact that polarization patterns are present during twilight, but it remains as a perfect example that when light conditions are challenging the bee orients itself based on the polarization patterns of the twilight sky.|$|E
50|$|After sunset, civil {{twilight}} sets in, and ends when the Sun drops more than 6° below the horizon. This {{is followed by}} nautical twilight, when the Sun reaches heights of -6° and -12°, after which comes <b>astronomical</b> <b>twilight,</b> defined as the period from -12° to -18°. When the Sun drops more than 18° below the horizon, the sky generally attains its minimum brightness.|$|E
50|$|From a {{point on}} the ground at this latitude, the sun is above the horizon for 16 hours, 12 minutes during the summer {{solstice}} and 8 hours, 14 minutes during the winter solstice This latitude also roughly corresponds to the minimum latitude in which <b>astronomical</b> <b>twilight</b> can last all night near the summer solstice. Slightly less than 1/8 of the Earth's surface is north of the 49th parallel.|$|E
50|$|On 6 June 2014, the {{asteroid}} brightened to about apparent magnitude 13.7 {{while in the}} southern constellation of Horologium. Near its closest approach to Earth of 3.25 Lunar distances on 8 June 2014, {{the asteroid}} crossed the celestial equator, making it a northern hemisphere object. It however had an elongation of about 20 degrees from the Sun, and was lost in <b>astronomical</b> <b>twilight</b> during the closest approach to Earth. The Goldstone Deep Space Network observed the asteroid later on 8 June 2014, when the asteroid was between 3.6 and 3.8 lunar distances.|$|E
50|$|Twilight {{is divided}} into three {{segments}} according to how far the sun is below the horizon, measured in segments of 6°. After sunset the civil twilight sets in; it ends when the sun drops more than 6° below the horizon. This is followed by the nautical twilight, when the sun is 6° and 12° below the horizon (heights of between −6° and −12°), after which comes the <b>astronomical</b> <b>twilight,</b> defined as the period from −12° to −18°. When the sun drops more than 18° below the horizon, the sky generally attains its minimum brightness.|$|E
50|$|Sumas is a {{small town}} in Whatcom County, Washington, United States. The {{population}} was 1,307 at the 2010 census. Sumas is located adjacent to the Canada-US border and borders the city of Abbotsford, British Columbia. The Sumas-Huntingdon port of entry {{at the north end of}} State Route 9 operates 24 hours a day. Sumas shares Nooksack Valley School District with the towns of Nooksack and Everson. Sumas is the northernmost settlement on Washington State Route 9 and experiences <b>Astronomical</b> <b>Twilight</b> for 22 days during the months of June and July.|$|E
50|$|Dusk {{occurs at}} the darkest stage of twilight, {{or at the very}} end of <b>astronomical</b> <b>twilight</b> after sunset and just before night. Pre-dusk, during early to {{intermediate}} stages of twilight, there may be enough light in the sky under clear-sky conditions to read outdoors without artificial illumination, but at the end of civil twilight, when the earth rotates to a point at which the center of the sun is at 6° below the local horizon, artificial illumination is required to read outside. The term dusk usually refers to astronomical dusk, or the darkest part of twilight before night begins.|$|E
5000|$|From mid November 2013 until 1 January 2014 15:00 UT {{the small}} dim {{asteroid}} had an elongation less than 45 {{degrees from the}} Sun with an undetectable apparent magnitude of around 30. While less than 18 degrees from the Sun any dim asteroid can be lost in <b>astronomical</b> <b>twilight.</b> On 1 January 2014 10:00 UT the asteroid passed [...] from the Moon and at 16:13 UT passed [...] from Earth. The asteroid was then discovered on 2 January 2014 by the Catalina Sky Survey at an apparent magnitude of 18.9 using a 0.68 m Schmidt-Cassegrain telescope. By 3 January 2014 the asteroid was becoming dimmer than apparent magnitude 20.|$|E
50|$|During the {{nautical}} {{polar night}} period, {{there is no}} trace of daylight, except around midday. It happens {{when there is no}} nautical twilight and only <b>astronomical</b> <b>twilight</b> occurs at the solar culmination. Nautical twilight happens when the Sun is between six and twelve degrees below the horizon. There is a location at the horizon around midday with more light than others because of refraction. During nautical night, the Sun is lower than 12° below the horizon, so nautical polar night is limited to latitudes above 78° 34', which is exactly 12° within the polar circle, or 11.5° from the pole. Alert, Nunavut, the northernmost settlement in Canada and the world, experiences this from late November to mid-January.|$|E
5000|$|From mid October 2011 until 3 December 2011 15:00 UT {{the small}} dim {{asteroid}} had an elongation less than 60 {{degrees from the}} Sun. (While less than 18 degrees from the Sun any dim asteroid can be lost in <b>astronomical</b> <b>twilight,</b> and many observatories can not see below ~40 degrees from the horizon.) On 3 December 2011 at 15:20 UT the asteroid passed [...] from Earth and at 16:20 UT passed [...] from the Moon. The asteroid was then discovered on 8 December 2011 by Lincoln Near-Earth Asteroid Research (LINEAR) at an apparent magnitude of 19 using a 1.0 m reflecting telescope. At the time of discovery the asteroid was near opposition to the Sun.|$|E
50|$|Within {{the polar}} circles, twenty-four-hour {{daylight}} is encountered in summer, and in regions {{very close to}} the poles, twilight can last for weeks on the winter side of the equinoxes. Outside the polar circles, where the angular distance from the polar circle is less than the angle which defines twilight (see above), twilight can continue through local midnight near the summer solstice. The precise position of the polar circles, and the regions where twilight can continue through local midnight, varies slightly from year to year with Earth's axial tilt. The lowest latitudes at which the various twilights can continue through local midnight are approximately 60.561° (60°33′43″) for civil twilight, 54.561° (54°33′43″) for nautical twilight and 48.561° (48°33′43″) for <b>astronomical</b> <b>twilight.</b>|$|E

It also receives heat from the predominant high pressure fronts which bring warm air from the Atlantic to the Barents Sea. The town has its lowest temperatures during February, at an average −14 C and a high average of 5 C during July. The sun does not set from 18 April to 24 August (midnight sun) and does not rise from 25 October to 17 February (polar night). But there is no nautical twilight between December 11 to December 30, it only has 24 hour of darkness called <b>astronomical</b> <b>twilight.</b> The site is sufficiently isolated that {{it can be used to}} measure the background pollution levels in the high Arctic troposphere.|$|E
50|$|At Greenwich, England (51.5°N), the {{duration}} of civil twilight will vary from 33 minutes to 48 minutes, depending {{on the time of}} year. At the equator, conditions can go from day to night in as little as 20-25 minutes. This is true because at low latitudes the sun's apparent movement is perpendicular to the observer's horizon. But at the poles, civil twilight can be as long as 2-3 weeks. In the Arctic and Antarctic regions, twilight (if there is any) can last for several hours. There is no <b>astronomical</b> <b>twilight</b> at the poles near the winter solstice (for about 74 days at the North Pole and about 80 days at the South Pole). As one gets closer to the Arctic and Antarctic circles, the sun's disk moves toward the observer's horizon at a lower angle. The observer's earthly location will pass through the various twilight zones less directly, taking more time.|$|E
