Heidi's special <b>ability</b> <b>is</b> to make herself attractive to other people, regardless of species or gender.|$|E
5|$|Distribution of mecopterans is worldwide; the {{greatest}} diversity at the species level {{is in the}} Afrotropic and Palearctic realms, but there is greater diversity at the generic and family level in the Neotropic, Nearctic and Australasian realms. They are absent from Madagascar and many islands and island groups; this may demonstrate that their dispersal <b>ability</b> <b>is</b> low, with Trinidad, Taiwan and Japan, where they are found, having had recent land bridges to the nearest continental land masses.|$|E
5|$|Exile begins 10 {{years after}} the events of Riven, when the Stranger arrives {{at the home of}} Atrus and his wife Catherine. Atrus is a {{scientist}} and explorer who has mastered an ancient practice known as the Art: he can create links to different worlds, called Ages, by writing special books. This <b>ability</b> <b>is</b> by an ancient civilization known as the D'ni, whose society crumbles after the D'ni city is devastated by a plague. Atrus calls the Stranger to his home to display his newest Age, Releeshahn, which Atrus has designed as a new home for the D'ni survivors.|$|E
40|$|We {{examined}} {{the contribution of}} executive control to individual differences in response time (RT) for naming objects and actions. Following Miyake et al., executive control was assumed to include updating, shifting, and inhibiting <b>abilities,</b> which <b>were</b> assessed using operation span, task-switching, and stop-signal tasks, respectively. Experiment 1 showed that updating <b>ability</b> <b>was</b> significantly correlated with the mean RT of action naming, but not of object naming. This finding was replicated in Experiment 2 using a larger stimulus set. Inhibiting <b>ability</b> <b>was</b> significantly correlated with the mean RT of both action and object naming, whereas shifting <b>ability</b> <b>was</b> not correlated with the mean naming RTs. Ex-Gaussian analyses of the RT distributions revealed that updating <b>ability</b> <b>was</b> correlated with the distribution tail of both action and object naming, whereas inhibiting <b>ability</b> <b>was</b> correlated with {{the leading edge of}} the distribution for action naming and the tail for object naming. Shifting ability provided no independent contribution. These results indicate that the executive control abilities of updating and inhibiting contribute to the speed of naming objects and actions, although there are differences in the way and extent these <b>abilities</b> <b>are</b> involved...|$|R
500|$|Characters {{can also}} {{use a variety of}} magical {{abilities}} for both offense and ally-support. These <b>abilities</b> <b>are</b> limited by the number of Ether Points (EP) that are available to a character, which must be replenished using items during exploration (non-combat) sequences. For most characters, these <b>abilities</b> <b>are</b> attributed to [...] "Ether," [...] a mysterious power to which (presumably) all humans have access. Some characters' magical <b>abilities</b> <b>are</b> referred to by different names, implying differences in their origins. For example, Fei's magic is called [...] "Chi" [...] and Citan's is called [...] "Arcane". While fighting in gears, human Ether <b>abilities</b> <b>are</b> amplified, though some change or become unavailable during this type of combat.|$|R
50|$|Batters and fielders <b>abilities</b> <b>are</b> {{measured}} with five different statistics: Batting, Power, Speed, Defense, and Arm. Pitchers <b>abilities</b> <b>are</b> {{measured with}} three different statistics: Speed, Stamina, and Control. Statistics are measured by a number 1-10, with 1 being the weakest and 10 being the best.|$|R
5|$|Four magical {{disciplines}} are acquired, {{including the}} Fire of Ares, the Ice of Poseidon, the Lightning of Zeus, and the Soul of Hades, which, {{depending on the}} magic equipped, imbues the Blades of Chaos with that elemental property. For example, the Soul of Hades imbues the Blades with purple flames and can unleash souls of the Underworld to briefly attack enemies. The Ice of Poseidon also enables Kratos to breathe underwater, a necessary ability as substantial time is spent there. The Rage ability called Rage of the Gods that was featured in previous games is included, but in this game, its meter is filled by landing attacks on enemies and the <b>ability</b> <b>is</b> automatically activated once the meter has reached maximum capacity. It remains activated until Kratos is attacked or stops attacking {{for an extended period}} of time, after which the meter must be refilled. The Rage <b>ability</b> <b>is</b> also affected by the magic equipped, allowing Kratos to use different Rage attacks, such as the lightning-based Rage of Zeus.|$|E
5|$|In ecology, {{sustainability}} (from sustain and <b>ability)</b> <b>is</b> {{the property}} of biological systems to remain diverse and productive indefinitely. Long-lived and healthy wetlands and forests are examples of sustainable biological systems. In more general terms, sustainability is the endurance of systems and processes. The organizing principle for sustainability is sustainable development, which includes the four interconnected domains: ecology, economics, politics and culture. Sustainability science {{is the study of}} sustainable development and environmental science.|$|E
5|$|Octopuses use {{camouflage}} when hunting, and {{to avoid}} predators. To do this they use specialised skin cells which change {{the appearance of the}} skin by adjusting its colour, opacity, or reflectivity. Chromatophores contain yellow, orange, red, brown, or black pigments; most species have three of these colours, while some have two or four. Other colour-changing cells are reflective iridophores and white leucophores. This colour-changing <b>ability</b> <b>is</b> also used to communicate with or warn other octopuses.|$|E
50|$|In {{psychiatric}} {{and psychological}} testing, e-assessment {{can be used}} not only to assess cognitive and practical abilities but anxiety disorders, such as social anxiety disorder, i.e. SPAI-B. Widely in psychology. Cognitive <b>abilities</b> <b>are</b> assessed using e-testing software, while practical <b>abilities</b> <b>are</b> assessed using e-portfolios or simulation software.|$|R

5|$|The {{gear and}} dial {{in the bottom}} left of the game screen {{is related to the}} Kotarou's Rewrite ability. The dial moves forward {{whenever}} this <b>ability</b> <b>is</b> used, and the outcome of certain scenes is determined by how much the dial has moved. Throughout most of the game, the text is presented in a dialog box on the lower portion of the game screen, but this is changed for the Terra scenario, where the text is overlaid across the entire screen.|$|E
5|$|The show {{centers on}} FBI special agents {{who work on}} cases linked to the paranormal, called X-Files; this season focuses on the {{investigations}} of John Doggett (Robert Patrick), Monica Reyes (Annabeth Gish), and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson). In this episode, Doggett, Reyes, Walter Skinner (Mitch Pileggi) and Scully stumble on to a bizarre murder case where the main suspect {{is a man with}} an unusual obsession for The Brady Bunch. Despite their initial differences—both in investigative style and love of The Brady Bunch—the four of them soon learn that the man's telekinetic <b>ability</b> <b>is</b> the ultimate, undeniable proof of an X-File.|$|E
5|$|Vortigaunts {{are shown}} {{as a very}} {{communal}} and cultural race, believing in a force that binds {{the fabric of the}} universe and each Vortigaunt together, as well as producing a tradition of poetry and music. Vortigaunts also display the ability to summon and command electrical energy without the need for technology. This <b>ability</b> <b>is</b> used for various activities, such as a means of attack, powering electrical equipment, and healing.|$|E

5|$|Flowers and coins, {{as well as}} stars, are {{scattered}} about the game's stages. These are totaled {{at the end of}} each stage and a score is given depending how many of each were collected (a maximum of 30 stars, 20 red coins and 5 flowers). Sufficiently high scores are required to unlock one of the two sets of secret levels. (the other set being unlocked upon completing the game, similar to the GBA remake of the original game) Special character coins are also introduced. Missing from the game are the power-ups of sorts — like the ability to spit seeds by eating watermelons — which were present in the original. The fire breathing <b>ability</b> <b>is</b> retained though: Yoshi can use it when he snags a torch or fireball with his tongue. This allows him to shoot streams of fire up to three times. Keys found in the stages unlock mini-games and doors that would be closed otherwise.|$|E
5|$|Jack Russells {{are first}} and {{foremost}} a working terrier. Originally bred to bolt foxes from their dens during hunts, they are used on numerous ground-dwelling quarry such as groundhog, badger, and red and grey fox. The working JRT is required to locate quarry in the earth, and then either bolt it or hold it in place until they are dug to. To accomplish this, the dog will not bark but will expect attention to the quarry continuously. Because the preservation of this working <b>ability</b> <b>is</b> of highest importance to most registered JRTCA/JRTCGB breeders, Jack Russells tend to be extremely intelligent, athletic, fearless, and vocal dogs. It is not uncommon for these dogs to become moody or destructive if not properly stimulated and exercised, as they have a tendency to bore easily and will often create their own fun when left alone to entertain themselves.|$|E
5|$|James' playmaking <b>ability</b> <b>is</b> {{generally}} considered to be one of his premier skills, with some analysts ranking him among the greatest passers in NBA history. He is the only frontcourt player in league history to register over 7,000 career assists. Using his size, vision, and the attention he garners from opposing defenses to his advantage, James is able to create easy points for his teammates with accurate assists, manufacturing a league leading 2.6 three-pointers per game by way of his passing alone in 2013. He will often execute passes that would normally be considered unconventional, including passes after leaving his feet and passes through defensive traffic. His uncanny tendency to find the open man {{played a significant role in}} the evolution of modern NBA defenses, forcing teams to incorporate some elements of zone into their schemes to better cover the weak side of the court and prevent James from passing to open shooters.|$|E

5|$|Over {{the course}} of its development, the Sharingan will grant the user three unique abilities: The first being its famous ability for the user to {{instantly}} memorize and replicate any opponent's movement and attacks with perfect accuracy. The Sharingan's second ability grants the user increased ocular perception, allowing them to read and predict the movements and actions of fast-moving objects. This also allows the user to easily recognize genjutsu and different forms of chakra (i.e.: to visualize chakra in different colors). Its final <b>ability</b> <b>is</b> a brand of scenarios that suggests actions and thoughts to the opponent, acting as {{an effective way to}} produce beyond genjutsu abilities or implant memories in another person.|$|E
5|$|The Game Boy Advance version shares basic {{elements}} with its console counterparts. Displayed from a side-scrolling view, the Prince navigates {{the palace of}} Azad using his acrobatic skills. The Rewind <b>ability</b> <b>is</b> still present to save the Prince's life, and is also involved in solving some puzzles and fighting bosses. New moves and abilities are gained by the Prince by performing moves and solving puzzles. Farah is featured as a second playable character in some sections, with switching between the two being key to some puzzles. The mobile version is similarly a side-scroller, featuring simple puzzles and traps. The powers linked to the Sands are absent, but enemies must still be killed by stabbing them with the Dagger. There are three enemy types: archers, flying enemies, and foot soldiers.|$|E
5|$|The central {{character}} in the series is Harry Potter, an English boy who lives with his aunt, uncle, and cousin - the Dursleys - who discovers, {{at the age of}} eleven, that he is a wizard, though he lives in the ordinary world of non-magical people known as Muggles. The wizarding world exists parallel to the Muggle world, albeit hidden and in secrecy. His magical <b>ability</b> <b>is</b> inborn and children with such abilities are invited to attend exclusive magic schools that teach the necessary skills to succeed in the wizarding world. Harry becomes a student at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, a wizarding academy in Scotland and it is here where most of the events in the series take place. As Harry develops through his adolescence, he learns to overcome the problems that face him: magical, social and emotional, including ordinary teenage challenges such as friendships, infatuation, romantic relationships, schoolwork and exams, anxiety, depression, stress, and the greater test of preparing himself for the confrontation that lies ahead in wizarding Britain's increasingly-violent second wizarding war.|$|E

5|$|In general, a Vortigaunt is a {{somewhat}} humanoid figure with two legs and two arms, but has an additional arm protruding from its thorax. Vortigaunts have mottled green skin and digitigrade legs, {{allowing them to}} move quickly. Typically, Vortigaunts have a slightly hunched posture. In addition, Vortigaunts have sharp teeth, clawed hands, strong senses, and their faces are dominated by a large red eye. In Half-Life, this eye is surrounded by five smaller eyes, although, in Half-Life 2, this {{has been reduced to}} three smaller eyes. A key aspect of the Vortigaunts is their ability to summon energy to their command without the need for any equipment. In-game, this <b>ability</b> <b>is</b> most commonly used as a means of attack, with Vortigaunts' hurling the energy towards foes in the form of green electrical bolts. In addition, Vortigaunts {{have been shown to be}} able to use the energy for other purposes, such as assisting in repair work, removing rubble and blockages, recharging the player's HEV suit or powering up electrical generators. Enslaved Vortigaunts are depicted with green collars and shackles, although the means by which these control Vortigaunts is not explored. Vortigaunts are not typically seen wearing clothing, although several Vortigaunts are observed wearing lab coats and chef's clothing in the course of Half-Life 2 and its expansions. Vortigaunts are depicted as meat eaters; the player can observe Vortigaunts' eating human corpses in Half-Life and cooking headcrabs in Half-Life 2, although Half-Life 2 also shows Vortigaunts working in kitchens with chef hats, preparing soups and salads, suggesting that Vortigaunts are omnivores.|$|E
5|$|On June 17, 2013, Rovio teased on its Facebook {{page that}} Red, the main protagonist of the game, would receive an ability {{in a new}} episode. On June 26, Rovio {{released}} a YouTube video, uncovering three new facts: the episode would be called Red's Mighty Feathers, the update would come in July, and the Angry Birds app icon would receive a new design. On July 3, 2013, the update was released, with fifteen levels of all-new gameplay. Instead of knocking over the pigs' castles, the player's goal {{is to keep the}} pigs from stealing the egg and leaving the playing field with it. The pigs arrive in waves of complicated vehicles, and the only available bird is Red, whose new <b>ability</b> <b>is</b> to target the nearest pig. There is no score, and the three stars are awarded by completing three objectives in one try. The first objective is to finish the level without getting the egg stolen. The second is to pop all the pigs in the level. The third is to use fewer than or equal to a certain number of birds to clear the level. Because some people were skeptical about the new gameplay, Rovio later announced that they would add levels to the episode based on the original level style. On September 16, 2013, Rovio added 15 levels to the episode using the original style and these levels include manual targeting for Red Bird.|$|E
25|$|Jensen claimed, on {{the basis}} of his research, that general {{cognitive}} <b>ability</b> <b>is</b> essentially an inherited trait, determined predominantly by genetic factors rather than by environmental conditions.
