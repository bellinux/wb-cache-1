50|$|The {{treatment}} for galactosemic cataract {{is no different}} from general galactosemia treatment. In fact, galactosemic cataract {{is one of the few}} symptoms that is actually reversible. Infants should be immediately removed from a galactose diet when symptoms present, and the cataract should disappear and visibility should return to normal. Aldose reductase inhibitors, such as sorbinil, have also proven promising in preventing and reversing galactosemic cataracts. AR inhibitors hinder aldose reductase from synthesizing galactitol in the lens, and thus restricts the osmotic swelling of the lens fibers. Other AR inhibitors include the acetic acid compounds zopolrestat, tolrestat, <b>alrestatin,</b> and epalrestat. Many of these compounds have not been successful in clinical trials due to adverse pharmokinetic properties, inadequate efficacy and efficiency, and toxic side effects. Testing on such drug-treatments continues in order to determine potential long-term complications, and for a more detailed mechanism of how AR inhibitors prevent and reverse the galactosemic cataract.|$|E
40|$|The {{efficacy}} of treatment with an aldose reductase inhibitor (1, 3 -dioxo- 1 H-benz-de-isoquinoline- 2 (3 H) -acetic acid, AY- 22, 284, <b>Alrestatin)</b> on peripheral nerve function in diabetic polyneuropathy was assessed. Thirty patients with long-standing diabetes and slight to moderate neuropathy {{participated in the}} double-blind placebo trial. Clinical examination, sensory threshold determinations for vibratory, tactile and thermal stimuli, conduction velocity measurements and studies of automatic function were performed to evaluate the treatment. Significant differences favouring <b>Alrestatin</b> over placebo were found {{for many of the}} measured variables, whereas no changes occurred on placebo. The apparent improvement of neuropathy occurred despite persisting hyperglycaemia. The results indicate that aldose reductase inhibitor treatment may be of value in diabetic polyneuropathy, and provide support for the sorbitol pathway hypothesis of diabetic polyneuropathy...|$|E
40|$|The kinetic {{mechanism}} of the major sheep liver aldehyde reductase (ALR 1) was studied with three aldehyde substrates: p-nitrobenzaldehyde, pyridine- 3 -aldehyde and D-glucuronate. In each case the enzyme mechanism was sequential and product-inhibition studies were consistent with an ordered Bi Bi mechanism, with the coenzymes binding to the free enzyme. Binding studies were used to investigate the interactions of substrates, products and inhibitors with the free enzyme. These provided evidence for the binding of D-glucuronate, L-gulonate and valproate, as well as NADP+ and NADPH. The enzyme was inhibited by high concentrations of D-glucuronate in a non-competitive manner, indicating that this substrate was able to bind to the free enzyme and to the E X NADP+ complex at elevated concentrations. Although the enzyme was inhibited by high pyridine- 3 -aldehyde concentrations, {{there was no evidence}} for the binding of this substrate to the free enzyme. Sheep liver ALR 1 was inhibited by the ionized forms of <b>alrestatin,</b> sorbinil, valproate, 2 -ethylhexanoate and phenobarbitone, indicating the presence of an anion-binding site similar to that described for the pig liver enzyme, which interacts with inhibitors and substrates containing a carboxy group. Sorbinil, valproate and 2 -ethylhexanoate inhibited the enzyme uncompetitively at low concentrations and non-competitively at high concentrations, whereas phenobarbitone and <b>alrestatin</b> were non-competitive and uncompetitive inhibitors respectively. The significance of these results with respect to inhibitor and substrate binding is discussed...|$|E
40|$|Aldose reductase (alditol:NADP+ 1 -oxidoreductase, EC 1. 1. 1. 21) {{has been}} {{partially}} purified from human erythrocytes by DEAE-cellulose (DE- 52) column chromatography. This enzyme is activated severalfold upon incubation with 10 microM each glucose 6 -phosphate, NADPH, and glucose. The {{activation of the}} enzyme was confirmed by following the oxidation of NADPH {{as well as the}} formation of sorbitol with glucose as substrate. The activated form of aldose reductase exhibited monophasic kinetics with both glyceraldehyde and glucose (Km of glucose = 0. 68 mM and Km of glyceraldehyde = 0. 096 mM), whereas the native (unactivated) enzyme exhibited biphasic kinetics (Km of glucose = 9. 0 and 0. 9 mM and Km of glyceraldehyde = 1. 1 and 0. 14 mM). The unactivated enzyme was strongly inhibited by aldose reductase inhibitors such as sorbinil, <b>alrestatin,</b> and quercetrin, and by phosphorylated intermediates such as ADP, glycerate 3 -phosphate, glycerate 1, 3 -bisphosphate, and glycerate 2, 3 -trisphosphate. The activated form of the enzyme was less susceptible to inhibition by aldose reductase inhibitors and phosphorylated intermediates...|$|E
40|$|Prostaglandins are {{important}} regulators of female reproductive functions to which aldose reductases exhibiting hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase activity also contribute. Our {{work on the}} regulation of reproductive function by prostaglandins (PGs), lead us to the discovery that AKR 1 B 5 and later AKR 1 B 1 were highly efficient and physiologically relevant PGF synthases. PGE 2 and PGF 2 α are the main prostanoids produced in the human endometrium and proper balance in their relative production is important for normal menstruation and optimal fertility. Recent evidence suggests that PGE 2 /EP 2 and PGF 2 α/FP may constitute a functional dyad with physiological relevance comparable to the prostacyclin-thromboxane dyad in the vascular system. We have recently reported that AKR 1 B 1 was expressed and modulated in association with PGF 2 α production in response to IL- 1 β in the human endometrium. In the present study, we show that the human AKR 1 B 1 (gene ID: 231) also known as ALDR 1 or ALR 2 is a functional PGF 2 α synthase in different models of living cells and tissues. Using human endometrial cells, prostate, and vascular smooth muscle cells, cardiomyocytes and endothelial cells we demonstrate that IL- 1 β is able to up regulate COX- 2 and AKR 1 B 1 proteins as well as PGF 2 α production under normal glucose concentrations. We show that the promoter activity of AKR 1 B 1 gene is increased by IL- 1 β particularly around the multiple stress response region containing two putative antioxidant response elements adjacent to TonE and AP 1. We also show that AKR 1 B 1 is able to regulate PGE 2 production through PGF 2 α acting on its FP receptor and that aldose reductase inhibitors like <b>alrestatin,</b> Statil (ponalrestat), and EBPC exhibit distinct and characteristic inhibition of PGF 2 α production in different cell models. The PGF synthase activity of AKR 1 B 1 represents a new and important target to regulate ischemic and inflammatory responses associated with several human pathologies...|$|E
