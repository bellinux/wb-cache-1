40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} with the identification and analysis of the policy objectives of US antitrust and EU competition law, with particular reference to the hardcore vertical restrictions, <b>absolute</b> <b>territorial</b> <b>protection</b> (ATP) and minimum resale price maintenance (RPM). It does not critique the identified policy objectives as such, but it does critique the underlying economic principles through which they are interpreted to assess whether the US and EU legal positions on the hardcore restrictions are logically justifiable. As such, two chapters are dedicated to the identification of the objectives of US antitrust policy and EU competition policy, respectively. This is done through analysis of their legal development, and political and historical context. They conclude that the promotion of consumer welfare has become the sole objective of US antitrust policy, but that EU competition policy has retained a multifaceted set of objectives, including the protection of market integration and the promotion of effective competition, as well as the welfare objectives the EU has adopted more recently. The final chapter assesses whether the US and EU legal positions on the hardcore vertical restrictions are logically justified by the policy objectives of each jurisdiction identified in the previous chapters. It considers the development of the legal positions in detail, and goes on to critique the economic analysis of vertical restraints under which the restrictions have been considered. It concludes that the EU justifies its absolute prohibition of both hardcore restrictions under its multifaceted set of competition policy objectives, but that the US can only logically justify its rule of reason for ATP under the sole objective of consumer welfare, while minimum RPM should have continued to be subject to per se illegality. The Leegin decision to permit minimum RPM subject to a rule of reason relied on flawed analysis of its economic effects...|$|E

40|$|The thesis {{deals with}} the legal {{regulation}} of <b>territorial</b> <b>protection</b> of water in terms of quantity, which is contained in the Water Act. I am only focusing on the Protected Areas of Natural Water Accumulation and Surface Water Accumulation Protected Areas as they have significant potential to reduce the effects of drought. Both areas are viewed through common problem, which {{is the point of}} view of the amount of water. The legal regulation of the <b>territorial</b> <b>protection</b> of waters in terms of quantity is discussed in connection with other laws. The aim of this work is to answer the question whether the legal regulation of <b>territorial</b> <b>protection</b> of waters in terms of quantity in the Water Act is sufficient to enable the Czech Republic to adapt adequately to the ongoing climate change, that ultimately causes the loss of water. The first part of the thesis deals with sources of legal regulation of <b>territorial</b> <b>protection</b> of water in terms of quantity, further includes the systematics of the Water Act and the Strategy on Adaptation to Climate Change in the Czech Republic (Adaptation Strategy of the Czech Republic). The second part analyses the Protected Areas of Natural Water Accumulation, prohibitions therein contained prohibitions, exemption from prohibitions and damage compensation.

40|$|This thesis {{provides}} a basic {{overview of the}} Czech legislation on the general <b>territorial</b> <b>protection</b> of nature and landscape. The primary source of this thesis is the Act no. 114 / 1992 Coll., on the Protection of nature and landscape protection. The thesis is divided into seven chapters. The first chapter is to introduce a protection of nature and landscape and to explain the terms and legal instruments related thereto. The following two chapters focus on international and mainly European developments and documents that have influenced the legislation of the general <b>territorial</b> <b>protection.</b> The fourth chapter briefly describes the historical background of the Czech legislation. The main part of this thesis is concentrated in the fifth chapter which deals with individual tools of a general <b>territorial</b> <b>protection</b> of nature and landscape, ie. territorial systems of ecological stability, significant elements of the landscape, protection of trees outside forests, protection of inanimate nature, landscape character, natural park and temporarily protected area. These institutes are examined {{in terms of the}} rules contained in the Act no. 114 / 1992 Coll., on the Protection of nature and landscape, in the context of laws that amend the act. The sixth and seventh chapters deal with issues relate to a legal [...] ...|$|R

The theoretical framework predicts that a larger parental pool of knowledge raises the probability of offshoring. This holds in a national {{as well as an}} international context. However, when the producer loses <b>territorial</b> <b>protection,</b> the changeover from non-integration to integration is delayed. Employing data on German firms investing in Eastern Europe finds empirical evidence for the theoretical predictions.

40|$|This {{rigorous}} thesis analyzes {{in detail}} the legislation relating to the territorial nature and landscape protection {{and that of the}} European and Czech perspective. The thesis describes the legal sources of European nature and landscape protection from the most general point of view, with focus on certain articles of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union and EU Action Programs, including the new EU Biodiversity Strategy to 2020. The thesis also refers to the historical development of nature and landscape protection in the Czech lands to the present. It also describes general and special <b>territorial</b> <b>protection</b> in the Czech legal system, included especially in Act No. 114 / 1992 Coll and analyzes various legal instruments of nature and landscape protection. The thesis describes the European law (Habitats Directive 92 / 42 /EEC and Birds Directive 2009 / 147 /EC, also judgments of the European Court of Justice) and Czech legal sources concerning the Natura 2000 network, and evaluates the success of the transposition and implementation of the Directives in Czech law.

40|$|With {{diminishing}} global {{water reserves}} {{the problem of}} water allocation becomes increasingly important. We consider the problem of efficiently sharing a river {{among a group of}} satiable countries. Inducing countries to efficiently cooperate requires monetary compensations via international agreements. We show that cooperation of the other countries exerts a positive externality on the benefit of a coalition. Our problem is to distribute the benefit of efficiently sharing the river under these constraints. If the countries outside of a coalition do not cooperate at all, then the downstream incremental distribution is the unique compromise between the <b>absolute</b> <b>territorial</b> sovereignty (ATS) doctrine and the unlimited territorial integrity (UTI) doctrine. If all countries outside a coalition cooperate, then there may not exist any distribution satisfying the UTI doctrine. WATER ALLOCATION;EXTERNALITIES...|$|R

50|$|Boxer crabs in {{the genus}} Lybia have {{developed}} a mutualistic relationship with small sea anemones such as Triactis producta. The crab's front limbs have modified chelae, each of which can gently grip a sea anemone by its column, and it usually holds one in each claw. The living anemone is brandished like a weapon to keep predators away and is also used in ritualistic <b>territorial</b> <b>protection.</b> The sea anemones used are small and seldom exceed a column height of 8 mm. If it loses one of its anemones, the crab can tear the other one in half, after which each part grows into a new individual. The crab also uses the anemones to immobilise and capture prey on its behalf. The sea anemones seem unharmed by being used in this way.|$|R

Open innovation {{as a way to}} increase competitiveness has become popular among many organizations, but its success is not guaranteed.

Using empirical findings from a project in the field of vehicle- and traffic safety, this paper contributes with a proposal for a refined methodology, iKCP, to enable and facilitate open innovation collaboration. Inspiration has been sought in methods used for managing innovative design processes. The strength of the iKCP methodology is that it supports, encourages and even forces the participants to leave the zone of <b>territorial</b> <b>protection</b> and be at ease in the zone of expansive exploration...|$|R
