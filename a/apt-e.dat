25|$|The {{introduction}} {{into service}} of the Advanced Passenger Train {{was to be a}} three-stage project. Phase 1, the development of an experimental APT (<b>APT-E),</b> was completed. The <b>APT-E</b> used a gas turbine-electric locomotive, the only multiple unit so powered that was used by British Rail. It was formed of two power cars (numbers PC1 and PC2), initially with nothing between them and later, two trailer cars (TC1 and TC2). The cars were made of aluminium to reduce the weight of the unit and were articulated. The use of a gas turbine was dropped from development, due to excessive noise of the turbine and the high fuel costs of the late 1970s. The <b>APT-E</b> first ran on 25 July 1971. The train drivers' union, ASLEF black-listed the train due to the use of a single driver. The train was moved to the works at Derby (with the aid of a locomotive inspector). This triggered a one-day strike by ASLEF that cost BR more than the research budget for the entire year.|$|E
2500|$|In the 1970s, British Rail {{began to}} explore new {{technologies}} for enabling high-speed passenger rail services in the UK. While the Japanese and French railway authorities had decided to build completely new tracks for their respective Shinkansen and TGV high-speed rail systems, British Rail opted instead to develop a train capable of running on existing rail infrastructure: the Advanced Passenger Train (APT), with {{a top speed of}} [...] An experimental version, the <b>APT-E</b> was tested between 1972 and 1976. It was equipped with a tilting mechanism which allowed the train to tilt into bends to reduce cornering forces on passengers, and was powered by gas turbines (the first to be used on British Rail since the Great Western Railway, and subsequent Western Region utilised Swiss built Brown-Boveri, and British built Metropolitan Vickers locomotives (18000 and 18100) in the early 1950s). The 1970s oil crisis prompted a rethink in the choice of motive power (as with the prototype TGV in France), and British Rail later opted for traditional electric overhead lines when the pre-production and production APTs were brought into service in 1980-86.|$|E

50|$|The {{hydrokinetic}} {{brake system}} was successful and reliable on the <b>APT-E</b> and was retained for the APT-P {{with a number}} of design improvements from the lessons learnt on <b>APT-E.</b> However, as an energy-cutting measure, the hydraulically actuated friction brakes used for low speed were modified to be fed by a passive hydraulic intensifier rather than a hydraulic power pack.|$|E

5000|$|It {{could be}} {{somewhat}} tactless, or perhaps naive, at times. The <b>APT-E</b> was {{provided with a}} single driver position central in the cab, {{at a time when}} the unions were resisting the loss of the [...] "second man" [...] (the fireman in steam days). After its first run out to Duffield the <b>APT-E</b> was [...] "blacked" [...] by the unions for a year.|$|E
50|$|Other changes {{suggested}} by experience on <b>APT-E</b> included {{changes to the}} vertical suspension from conventional hydraulic shock absorbers to air bags, which would both improve the ride quality and have lower maintenance requirements. For service reasons, the power cars were redesigns {{to have their own}} bogies in a Bo-Bo arrangement, so they could be easily removed from the train, unlike the former articulated design that connected adjacent cars together and made it difficult to split the train apart. The passenger cars retained the articulated design, but a number of changes were made due to experience on <b>APT-E.</b> Finally, a system that would cause the tilt system to fail into the upright position was desired, as <b>APT-E</b> had failed into a tilted position on several occasions.|$|E
5000|$|While POP was {{proving the}} basic concepts, {{construction}} of the test train continued at the Derby lab. The set was sufficiently complete by late 1971 for an official naming ceremony, where it became the <b>APT-E</b> (for Experimental). It made its first low-speed run from Derby to Duffield on 25 July 1972. Upon reaching Duffield, the ASLEF union immediately [...] "blacked" [...] it, forbidding their members from doing any work involving the train. Their complaint was that the <b>APT-E</b> had a single operator's chair, which they took as evidence that BR was moving to single operator trains. A friendly inspector helped the team move the train back to Derby at night. This resulted in a one-day national strike that cost more than the entire <b>APT-E</b> project.|$|E
50|$|While <b>APT-E</b> {{was still}} under construction, the team was well into {{the design of a}} {{production}} version. Jones found an ally in Graham Calder, who had been promoted to become BR's chief mechanical engineer (CME) in 1971. At the time they envisioned building two new experimental trains; one was essentially a stretched version of the <b>APT-E</b> with turbine power, and the other was similar, but powered by overhead electrical lines via pantograph (pan).|$|E
50|$|The 'Leyland 2S/350' {{gas turbine}} was {{developed}} by British Leyland to power road vehicles. It was also used in the British Rail <b>APT-E</b> train.|$|E

It will eventually be displayed at the Electric Railway Museum in Coventry. It was donated to the <b>APT-E</b> preservation Group by Serco after the National Railway Museum chose not to preserve it, but NRM have recently relented and HSFV1 will eventually be displayed at Shildon alongside the restored <b>APT-E,</b> which after all benefitted from the fundamental research carried out into wheel/rail interaction with HSFV1.HSFV4 is also still extant at the Eden Valley Railway where it is undergoing restoration.|$|E

It was powered by gas turbines, the only multiple unit so powered {{that was used}} by British Rail. The <b>APT-E</b> consisted of two driving power cars (PC1 and 2) and two trailer cars (TC1 and 2). Each power car was equipped with four Rover- built Leyland 2S/350 gas turbines (and a fifth for auxiliary power supplies), these initially produced 300 HP each but were progressively uprated to 330 HP. Two GEC 253AY nose suspended traction motors provided the traction on the leading bogies. The vehicles were manufactured from aluminium, approx 70 ft with articulated bogies between them.|$|E

50|$|The <b>APT-E</b> {{made its}} first run on 25 July 1972 from Derby to Duffield and was {{immediately}} 'blacked' by the drivers' union ASLEF, due to concerns that the single driver's seat preempted ongoing negotiations about the single-manning of trains. It was over twelve months before it ran again on the main line in August 1973.|$|E
5000|$|British Railways {{invested}} in experimentation {{with the new}} jet turbines {{in the early to}} mid 1950s. Most examples were built for the Western region (because of the oversized loading gauge compared {{with the rest of the}} network). The last attempt before <b>APT-E</b> was GT3 in 1962, but by then British Rail had favoured diesel and electric locomotives, and the project was scrapped.|$|E
50|$|The <b>APT-E</b> (E for experimental) was {{powered by}} gas turbines; the APT-P (P for prototype) was electric. With no tilting, {{the train was}} {{developed}} to break the British rail speed record. Tilting trains using passive tilt were not new, but it was uncommon and not widely implemented. The engineers decided that active tilt {{was the key to}} negotiating curves at much higher speeds.|$|E
5000|$|The {{track was}} set up by British Rail Research Division, which had used it from May 1966. [...] After closure as a through route in 1968, it was {{converted}} into a test track for the Advanced Passenger Train <b>APT-E</b> project, re-opening in September 1970. [...] The track saw extensive use in the heyday of the Research Division and was used for pantograph development and OHLE testing.|$|E
50|$|The <b>APT-E</b> unit is {{now owned}} by the National Railway Museum and is on display at its Locomotion museum at Shildon in County Durham. Also at Locomotion is an APT-P power car, number 49006, {{which is due to}} undergo {{restoration}} work after having been stored outdoors at York for many years. The second APT-P unit is now on display at Crewe Heritage Centre and can be seen from trains passing on the adjacent WCML.|$|E
5000|$|The APT-POP (Power-0-Power) set was a rake {{of three}} {{skeletal}} unpowered carriages {{used as a}} test bed for the suspension, tilting and braking systems used by APT units. The 'Power pumps' were only mock-ups, though similar externally to PC1 and PC2 in the <b>APT-E</b> unit minus cabs, and the whole set had to be hauled by a locomotive. Following the abandonment of the APT project, all three carriages were scrapped in 1985. The set was formed as follows: ...|$|E
50|$|<b>APT-E</b> testing {{ended in}} 1976, {{and the single}} train was sent {{directly}} to the National Railway Museum in York on 11 June 1976. During its testing it covered approximately , ending a career that is considered a success, but the train could {{not be said to}} have been extensively tested; in three years it covered less distance than the average family car would in that period. In comparison, the first TGV prototype, TGV 001, also powered by gas turbines, covered 320000 km between 1972 and 1976.|$|E
50|$|The RTC {{centralised}} {{the technical}} {{services provided by}} the regional Chief Mechanical & Electrical Engineers (CM&EE) to form the Department of Mechanical & Electrical Engineering (DM&EE). In addition, it housed the newly formed British Rail Research & Development Division (R&DD) which reported directly to the Board. The latter {{is well known for}} its work on the experimental Advanced Passenger Train (<b>APT-E).</b> At that early stage this was a concept vehicle, and in time the DM&EE applied the new knowledge to existing practice {{in the design of the}} High Speed Train (HST), the later prototype APT-P and other high-speed vehicles.|$|E
50|$|The Advanced Passenger Train (APT) was a tilting {{high speed}} train {{developed}} by British Rail during the 1970s and early 1980s, {{for use on}} the West Coast Main Line (WCML). The WCML contained many curves, and the APT pioneered the concept of active tilting to address these, a feature that has since appeared on designs around the world. The experimental <b>APT-E</b> achieved a new British railway speed record on 10 August 1975 when it reached 152.3 mph, only to be bested by the service prototype APT-P at 162.2 mph in December 1979, a record that stood for 23 years.|$|E
5000|$|As data flowed in {{from the}} POP and <b>APT-E,</b> a number of changes to the design were being made. Among the more {{problematic}} changes was Leyland's exit from the turbine market, having concluded {{that the concept of}} a turbine powered truck was not economically feasible. The company agreed to continue supporting the project anyway, including the release of a more powerful [...] version, but made it clear a production design would have to find another solution. In November 1972, the plans changed to build four electric versions for operation on the WCML, and another two turbine versions. From that point the turbine versions fell progressively further behind, and were eventually cancelled.|$|E
5000|$|The Research Division brought {{together}} personnel and expertise {{from all over}} the country, including the LMS Scientific Research Laboratory. Their remit was not simply the improvement of existing equipment, or the solution of existing problems, but fundamental research from first principles, into railway operation. The results of its work would go on to inform development by engineers, manufacturers and railways all over the world. For instance, once the initial <b>APT-E</b> experimental project was complete, it passed to the mechanical engineering department to build the APT-P prototype. In time, engineers would be seconded to other countries for varying periods under the trade name [...] "Transmark".|$|E
50|$|Although APT-P used {{much of the}} {{technology}} developed on the <b>APT-E,</b> construction of the first APT-P was delayed several times. The first power car was delivered from the Derby locomotive works in June 1977, and the first passenger cars on 7 June 1978, a year late. The first complete train was not ready until May 1979. It entered testing soon after, and set the UK speed record at 162.2 mph in December 1979, a record that stood for 23 years. Two additional examples were delivered, each with minor changes, one in late 1979, and the last in 1980. Initially proposed in the 1960s, and given the go-ahead in the early 1970s, the design was now significantly late.|$|E
50|$|Two {{vehicles}} survive: DB975025 Caroline and S60750. S60750, {{the buffet}} removed car from unit 1031 in 1963, {{had been used}} for tilt tests in the 1980s for the Advanced Passenger Train. This vehicle was fitted with a centre executive section, a urinal, and a classroom at one end which also had windows fitted for use when the vehicle was propelled at the Old Dalby test track, and was later used for airflow tests before being rescued first by Hastings Diesels Ltd at St. Leonards Depot and subsequently by the Hastings 60750 Group. In 2011 the vehicle came {{under the care of}} the <b>APT-E</b> Conservation and Support Group and moved to the Electric Railway Museum, Warwickshire near Coventry.|$|E
50|$|Work {{continued}} into the nationalised era, when {{a decision was made}} to concentrate various headquarters functions, particularly that of the Chief Mechanical and Electrical Engineer, in one national centre. This produced the Railway Technical Centre (RTC) {{on the opposite side of}} London Road, on a site which had formerly been part of the Way and Works sidings. Part of the RTC would be occupied by a new British Rail Research Division, reporting directly to the Board, under the Chief Civil Engineer's Department. This went on, in addition to its other work into all aspects of the railway, to design the experimental version of the Advanced Passenger Train (<b>APT-E).</b> The Scientific Research Laboratory was renamed Hartley House, and formed the Scientific Services department of the Research Division.|$|E
5000|$|British Rail's Class 370 tilting trains, also {{referred}} to as APT-P (meaning Advanced Passenger Train Prototype), were the pre-production Advanced Passenger Train units. Unlike the earlier experimental gas-turbine <b>APT-E</b> unit, these units were powered by 25 kV AC overhead electrification and were used on the West Coast Main Line between London Euston and Glasgow Central. The APT-P is the most powerful domestic train to have operated in Britain, the eight traction motors fitted to the two central Motor Cars giving a total output of [...] This enabled the train to set the UK rail speed record of 162.2 mph in December 1979, a record that stood for 23 years until an InterCity 225 set reached 162.6 mph in a test run on Stoke Bank.|$|E
50|$|The {{problems}} were eventually solved and the trains quietly reintroduced in 1984. By {{this time the}} competing High Speed Train, powered by a conventional diesel engine and lacking the APT's tilt and performance, had gone through development and testing at a rapid rate and was now forming the backbone of BR's passenger service. All support for the APT project had collapsed as anyone in authority distanced themselves from what was widely derided as a failure, while the HST found widespread support. All thoughts of building a production version, APT-S, were abandoned, and the three APT-P's ran for {{just over a year}} before being withdrawn again over the winter of 1985/6. Two of the three sets were broken up, and parts of the third sent to the National Railway Museum where it joined the <b>APT-E.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Contract {{negotiations}} over {{high speed rail}} had concluded {{in the summer of}} 1973, {{just in time for the}} modified three-car <b>APT-E</b> to emerge from the shop in August 1973. The train then started a testing series lasting eight months, covering details of the suspension, braking, curve performance and drag. However, reliability was a serious problem and it returned to the shops for a second overhaul in March 1974. Among the many changes for this round was the switching of the turbines formerly dedicated to power delivery for the passenger cars to add additional power to the traction motors, while at the same time replacing all of the turbines with an upgraded [...] version, improving total power per car from [...] Other changes included new motor bearings and the return and similar modification of the second power car, formerly used at the lab.|$|E
