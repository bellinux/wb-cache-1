5|$|By 1975, {{peregrine}} falcons {{had been}} reduced to 324 pairs in North America, primarily as a result of DDT, a widely used pesticide. DDT lowered estrogen levels in female peregrines and inhibited the production of calcium, causing eggs to thin and break during incubation. Recovery efforts for the peregrine falcon have been remarkably successful: agricultural DDT was banned by the U.S. in 1972 <b>and</b> <b>efforts</b> to breed and train peregrine falcons in captivity to later release to the wild were effective. In 1999, the peregrine falcon was removed from the U.S. Endangered Species list.|$|E

5|$|Ever {{since the}} Emperor Michael VIII Palaiologos (r. 1259–1282) {{recovered}} Constantinople from the Latin Empire in 1261, the restored Byzantine Empire faced {{the threat of}} a Latin crusade to reclaim the city. The antagonistic Greek Despotate of Epirus and the Latin states of southern Greece, fearful of the Byzantine resurgence, sought aid from the Kingdom of Sicily, first under Manfred of Sicily (r. 1258–1266), and after 1266 under the ambitious Charles of Anjou (r. 1266–1285), who quickly established himself as Byzantium's chief antagonist. Countering the Angevin ruler's alliances <b>and</b> <b>efforts</b> to conquer Byzantium would occupy the remainder of Michael VIII's reign.|$|E

5|$|A {{minority}} of Vietnamese are also {{followers of the}} Cao Đài faith which was introduced in 1927. The Cao Đài faith attracted both Vietnamese and Cambodian adherents within {{the first few years}} of its founding, but a royal decree which outlawed the religion <b>and</b> <b>efforts</b> by Cambodian nationalists to prosecute Khmer adherents led to Cao Dai being observed solely by Vietnamese from the 1930s onwards. A Cao Đài temple was built in Mao Tse Tung Boulevard in 1937, and in the 1960s there were about 70,000 adherents in Cambodia. Cao Đài was outlawed during the Khmer Republic and Khmer Rouge regimes, but regained official recognition in 1985 and has about 2,000 adherents in 2000.|$|E

5|$|As chief {{financial}} administrator, he bore {{the brunt of}} the chronicler's condemnations for extortion <b>and</b> <b>efforts</b> to increase royal revenues. Besides attempts to increase the efficiency of collection and the rate of taxation, Ranulf created new methods of raising money. One of his new measures in revenue collection came in 1094, when the fyrd, or English militia, was assembled to fight in Normandy against the king's brother Robert Curthose. When all the men had assembled, instead of sending them to Normandy, Ranulf dismissed them, after collecting the 10 shillings that each man had been given by their district for maintenance. Ranulf then spent the money on mercenaries. Ranulf also actively pressed lawsuits, including bringing suit against Anselm on the day of Anselm's consecration as Archbishop of Canterbury. Another innovation was the attempt to collect a relief, much like the relief due from vassals at the death of an overlord, from the under-tenants of church lands when the church office changed hands. This attempt came at the death of Wulfstan, Bishop of Worcester in 1095, when the king sent writs to the free tenants of the bishop, setting the amount of relief owed to the king. This attempt was not repeated, however.|$|E
5|$|Damage <b>and</b> <b>efforts</b> {{to control}} the spread of emerald ash borer have {{affected}} businesses that sell ash trees or wood products, property owners, and local or state governments. Quarantines can limit the transport of ash trees and products, but economic impacts are especially high for urban and residential areas due to treatment or removal costs and decreased land value from dying trees. Costs for managing these trees can fall upon homeowners or local municipalities. For municipalities, removing large numbers of dead or infested trees at once is costly, so slowing down {{the rate at which}} trees die through removing known infested trees and treating trees with insecticides can allow local governments more time to plan, remove, and replace trees that would eventually die. This strategy saves money as it would cost $10.7 billion in urban areas of 25 states between 2009–2019, while removing and replacing all ash trees in these same areas at once would cost $25 billion. Some urban areas such as Minneapolis, Minnesota, have large amounts of ash with slightly more than 20% of their urban forest as ash.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} we reconsider the {{efficiency}} losses of monopoly by studying a monopolist’s incentives to control production costs. To do so, we construct a model where a firm’s {{total cost of}} production depends on output <b>and</b> the manager’s <b>effort.</b> Total cost increases with output but decreases with effort. We analyse two separate cases with regard to ownership and control: (1) {{the owner of the}} firm manages the firm; and (2) the owner hires a manager to operate the firm. We demonstrate that even in the case where the owner is the manager of the firm, the effort level exerted by the owner-manager of a monopoly is generally not first-best. The direction of the bias depends on the relationship between output <b>and</b> <b>effort</b> in the cost function. The monopolist exerts too little <b>effort</b> if output <b>and</b> <b>effort</b> are complements in the cost function. The reverse is true if output <b>and</b> <b>effort</b> are substitutes in the cost function. The separation of ownership and control exacerbates monopoly slackness when output <b>and</b> <b>effort</b> are complements in the cost function. If output <b>and</b> <b>effort</b> are substitutes, on the other hand, the separation of ownership and control offsets the over-supply of effort by the owner-manager of the monopoly...|$|R
