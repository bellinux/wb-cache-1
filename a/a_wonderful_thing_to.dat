2500|$|They {{were named}} one of the Huffington Posts Sweet 16 of 2016 by {{entertainment}} and sports journalist Michael Blalas on December 21, 2016. Blalas stated of the band, [...] "Ah, the beauty of youthful exuberance. It's <b>a</b> <b>wonderful</b> <b>thing,</b> <b>to</b> be sure, but when you have brains, musical talent, enthusiasm and the ability to connect with a growing fan base through the monster method of social media and viral videos, there's no telling how far you can go," [...] and that [...] "The Accidentals certainly didn't happen by accident." ...|$|E
2500|$|Debnam-Carey was {{surprised}} by the attention. She was new to Twitter and Instagram, and did not know what shipping (the desire by fans for two people or fictional characters to be in a romantic or platonic relationship) meant; she saw that fans had given the pairing the portmanteau [...] "Clexa". [...] "I was on Instagram or something and I checked my tagged photos, and I realized that suddenly they were all LGBT artwork. I was like, 'Oh, my god!' I had no idea. It was the first time I realized I was a figure for that community," [...] said Debnam-Carey. She called this [...] "an honor" [...] and [...] "flattering," [...] and added, [...] "It's new for our society, as well. It's one of the first shows that really has two characters in the cast that are gender and sexually fluid and embraces that. There are no labels. It's <b>a</b> <b>wonderful</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> be a part of. I'm all for it." [...] While at Paleyfest 2016, she was made aware of fans raising money in her name for The Trevor Project, an organization for LGBT teenagers in need, and the fact that, at the time, $46,000 dollars had been raised. When asked if she knew she had that much of an impact on the LGBT community, Debnam-Carey commented, [...] "Not that much, no, that's amazing." [...] As of July 13, 2016, over $135,000 dollars have been raised.|$|E

6000|$|... "I don't think it's such <b>a</b> very <b>wonderful</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> walk <b>a</b> little, low, board fence," [...] she said. [...] "I knew {{a girl in}} Marysville {{who could}} walk the ridgepole of a roof." ...|$|R
6000|$|Now the old tale tells that Eric cried aloud: [...] "Little chance {{had this}} one," [...] and that then <b>a</b> <b>wonderful</b> <b>thing</b> came <b>to</b> pass. For the {{head on the}} rock opened its eyes and answered: ...|$|R
60|$|And {{the poor}} girl {{looked as if}} she might cry, which would have been <b>a</b> <b>wonderful</b> <b>thing</b> for Pomona <b>to</b> do.|$|R

60|$|The Author of this Advice having thus {{brought them}} to understand, and approve his Proposal, they demanded his {{assistance}} for making the Essay, and 'tis <b>a</b> most <b>wonderful</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> consider what <b>a</b> strange effect the alteration of their Measures had upon the whole Solunarian Nation.|$|R
6000|$|SIDI (timidly {{touching}} her hand). Now this is <b>a</b> <b>wonderful</b> <b>thing,</b> and worthy <b>to</b> be chronicled {{with the story}} of Solomon and the Queen of Sheba. Is it not so, Osman Ali? ...|$|R
60|$|Instantly {{the island}} trembled {{and with a}} weird groaning noise it moved upward--slowly, very slowly, but with a steady motion, while all the company stood by in awed silence. It was <b>a</b> <b>wonderful</b> <b>thing,</b> even <b>to</b> those skilled in the arts of magic, wizardry and sorcery, to realize that a single word could raise that great, heavy island, with its immense glass Dome.|$|R
6000|$|He {{was black}} in the face, and they {{scarcely}} could trace [...] The least likeness {{to what he had}} been: [...] While so great was his fright that his waistcoat turned white-- [...] <b>A</b> <b>wonderful</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> be seen! ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It’s <b>a</b> <b>wonderful</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> me," [...] said Mr. Negget in a {{low voice}} to his pipe, [...] "as they should come to a house with a retired {{policeman}} living in it. Looks to me like somebody that ain’t got much respect for the police." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It was <b>a</b> <b>wonderful</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> do," [...] said Maud, her admiration glowing {{for a man}} {{who could}} treat such a leap so lightly. She had always had a private theory that Lord Leonard, after {{performing}} the same feat, had bragged about {{it for the rest of}} his life.|$|E
6000|$|... "I have no plans, Duchess," [...] he said. [...] "Your {{country is}} very delightful, and the {{hospitality}} {{of the friends}} I have made over here is too <b>wonderful</b> <b>a</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> be described; but one never knows." ...|$|R
60|$|She {{followed}} along a pace behind me, {{neither of}} us speaking. I was too angry, and she evidently didn't care to converse with the lower orders. I was mad all the way through, as I had certainly felt that at least a word of thanks should have rewarded me, for I knew that even by her own standards, I must have done <b>a</b> very <b>wonderful</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> have killed the redoubtable Jubal in a hand-to-hand encounter.|$|R
6000|$|... "Moses who! Jack, {{you ought}} to be ashamed of yourself--{{you ought to}} [...] be ashamed of such {{criminal}} ignorance. Why, Moses, the great guide, [...] soldier, poet, lawgiver of ancient Israel! Jack, from this spot [...] where we stand, to Egypt, stretches a fearful desert three hundred [...] miles in extent--and across that desert that wonderful man brought [...] the children of Israel!--guiding them with unfailing sagacity for [...] forty years over the sandy desolation and among the obstructing [...] rocks and hills, and landed them at last, safe and sound, within [...] sight of this very spot; and where we now stand they entered the [...] Promised Land with anthems of rejoicing!

60|$|Daylight sped {{along at}} a long {{stretching}} hand-gallop, giving the gaunt Zulu a lift at every stride. It was <b>a</b> <b>wonderful</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> see old Umslopogaas run mile after mile, his lips slightly parted and his nostrils agape like the horse's. Every five miles or so we stopped {{for a few minutes}} to let him get his breath, and then flew on again.|$|E
6000|$|There {{followed}} a great tumult, {{in which the}} spectators took part, and the strange sight was seen of priests and their partisans, and even of bishops themselves, falling upon their adversaries and beating them with whatever weapon was to hand; yes, even with their pastoral staves. It was <b>a</b> <b>wonderful</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> behold, these ministers of the Christ of peace belabouring each other with pastoral staves! ...|$|E
60|$|Dutcher {{concluded}} {{that he should}} have a woman in the house, and so sent back to Pennsylvania for his sister, lately widowed. Rose looked forward to seeing her aunt with the wildest delight. She went with her father down the valley to Bluff Siding to meet her. Bluff Siding was the only town the child knew, and it was <b>a</b> <b>wonderful</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> go to town.|$|E
6000|$|... "By George, {{that would}} make me so much the more firm. From the first, I have thought matters would be better in your hands than mine; you have an education, and that's <b>a</b> <b>wonderful</b> <b>thing,</b> Miles. <b>As</b> <b>to</b> sailing a ship, or stowing her, or taking care of her in heavy weather, or finding my way across an ocean, I'll turn my back on no man; but it's a {{different}} thing when it comes to figures and calculations." ...|$|R
60|$|The curses {{to which}} the General gave a low utterance, as soon as Rebecca and her conqueror had quitted him, were so deep, that I am sure no {{compositor}} would venture to print them were they written down. They came from the General's heart; and <b>a</b> <b>wonderful</b> <b>thing</b> it is <b>to</b> think that the human heart is capable of generating such produce, and can throw out, as occasion demands, such a supply of lust and fury, rage and hatred.|$|R
6000|$|When {{there was}} a debate, and I was kept out very late, it seemed so strange to me, as I was walking home, to think that Dora was at home! It was such <b>a</b> <b>wonderful</b> <b>thing,</b> at first, <b>to</b> have her coming softly down {{to talk to me}} as I ate my supper. It was such a stupendous <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> know for certain that she put her hair in papers. It was {{altogether}} such an astonishing event to see her do it! ...|$|R
60|$|Work {{came to be}} <b>a</b> <b>wonderful</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> possess. To put hand to a beam or {{a shovel}} seemed now a most {{desirable}} favor, for it meant not only warm food and security and shelter, but in his case it promised {{a return to the}} mountains which came each hour to seem the one desirable and splendid country in the world--so secure, so joyous, so shining, his heart ached with wistful love of it.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] conceded Decoud, [...] "it's <b>a</b> <b>wonderful</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> {{say with}} {{the sight of}} the San Tome mine, the {{greatest}} fact in the whole of South America, perhaps, before our very eyes.

[...] "Mrs. Gould, are you aware to what point he has idealized the existence, the worth, the meaning of the San Tome mine? Are you aware of it?" ...|$|E
6000|$|A native {{pointed out}} a {{handsome}} swarthy man of grave and dignified bearing, and said in an awed tone, [...] "That is so-and-so; has held office {{of one sort or}} another under this government for 37 years--he is known all over this whole island and in the other countries of the world perhaps --who knows? One thing is certain; you can speak his name anywhere in this whole island, and you will find not one grown person that has not heard it. It is <b>a</b> <b>wonderful</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> be so celebrated; yet look at him; it makes no change in him; he does not even seem to know it." ...|$|E
60|$|We reached camp {{at the end}} of {{this still}} hot summer day. Never had a camp seemed so welcome! What <b>a</b> <b>wonderful</b> <b>thing</b> it was <b>to</b> earn and {{appreciate}} and realize rest! The cottonwood leaves were rustling; bees were humming in the tamarack blossoms. I lay in the shade, resting my burning feet and achiag bones, and I watched Nielsen as he whistled over the camp chores. Then I heard the sweet song of a meadow lark, and after that the melodious deep note of a swamp blackbird. These birds evidently were traveling north and had tarried at the oasis.|$|R
50|$|An insane {{misunderstanding}} {{that leads}} to love. Here, an almost-out-of-work actress - Geeta - accepts a ride from the chauffeur of wealthy industrialist Sandeep Anand. She is seen descending from Sandeep's limo and assumed to be his fiancé, all unbeknownst to herself. <b>As</b> <b>a</b> result, <b>wonderful</b> <b>things</b> begin <b>to</b> happen to her - her theatre company makes her the leading lady of all their productions, she is courted and fêted wherever she goes and a journalist becomes her constant shadow. She finds herself falling for him {{only to find out}} that he is none other than Sandeep Anand.|$|R
6000|$|In {{his later}} years at Stormfield Mark loved to play his {{favorite}} billiards. [...] "It was sometimes <b>a</b> <b>wonderful</b> and fearsome <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> watch Mr. Clemens play billiards," [...] relates Elizabeth Wallace. [...] "He loved the game, and he loved to win, but he occasionally made a very bad stroke, and then the varied, picturesque, and unorthodox vocabulary, acquired in his more youthful years, {{was the only thing}} that gave him comfort. Gently, slowly, with no profane inflexions of voice, but irresistibly as though they had the headwaters of the Mississippi for their source, came this stream of unholy adjectives and choice expletives." ...|$|R
60|$|The sunset in {{that great}} solemn place was <b>a</b> <b>wonderful</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> see. First {{of all the}} measureless crater was filled with light like a bowl with fire. Then as the great orb sank behind the western cliff, half of the plain became quite dark while shadows seemed to rush forward over {{the eastern part of}} its surface, till that too was {{swallowed}} up in gloom and for a little while there remained only a glow reflected from the cliff face and from the sky above, while on the crest of the parapet of rock played strange and glorious fires. Presently these too vanished and the world was dark.|$|E
6000|$|In {{regard to}} this meeting at Edinburgh, there was a ridiculous story {{circulated}} and variously commented on in certain newspapers of the United States, that the American flag was there exhibited, insulted, torn, and mutilated. Certain religious papers {{took the lead in}} propagating the slander, which, so for as I know or can learn, had no foundation, unless it be that, in the arranging of the flag around its staff, the stars might have been more distinctly visible than the stripes. The walls were profusely adorned with drapery, and there were numerous flags disposed in festoons. Truly <b>a</b> <b>wonderful</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> make a story of, and then parade it in the newspapers from Maine to Texas, beginning in Philadelphia! ...|$|E
60|$|Of course, {{there are}} times when these people have to come out with a spoken lie, for that is a thing which happens to {{everybody}} once in a while, and would happen to the angels if they came down here much. Particularly to the angels, in fact, for the lies I speak of are self-sacrificing ones told for a generous object, not a mean one; but even when these people tell a lie of that sort it seems to scare them and unsettle their minds. It is <b>a</b> <b>wonderful</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> see, and shows that they are all insane. In fact, it is a country which is full of the most interesting superstitions.|$|E
40|$|The TEMPLATE {{procedure}} {{is used to}} modify {{the layout of the}} output to create a neat, consistent, useable output file. The problem is that the TEMPLATE procedure {{has a great deal of}} language elements and the user is just trying to fix the output and get back to work. While there are great papers on learning and using the TEMPLATE procedure, having someone give you their completed template that solves your problems can be <b>a</b> <b>wonderful</b> <b>thing.</b> I’m going <b>to</b> do just that. I will give you Styles created from PROC TEMPLATE that meet CTD requirements as well as a few other styles that are either useful or fun. This paper will focus on the implementation and selection of styles...|$|R
6000|$|... "Sihamba, Walker-by-Moonlight, and you, Lady Swallow, listen <b>to</b> me. <b>A</b> <b>wonderful</b> <b>thing</b> {{has come}} <b>to</b> {{pass in the}} kraal of Sigwe this day, {{such a thing as}} our fathers have not known. You see that my host is {{gathered}} yonder: well, to-morrow they start to make war upon these very Endwandwe of whom you have spoken because of a deadly insult which they have put upon me and my house. Therefore, according to custom, this morning the soldiers were assembled at dawn to be doctored and that the diviners might search out the omens of the war. So the diviners searched, and she who was chosen among them ate the medicine and sank into the witch sleep here before us all. Yes, this one," [...] and he pointed to a tall woman with dreamy eyes who was bedizened with bones and snakeskins.|$|R
6000|$|... "My dear Anne," [...] he said, [...] "that {{young man}} has {{an income of}} at least a hundred {{thousand}} a year. Have you ever considered what <b>a</b> <b>wonderful</b> <b>thing</b> it is <b>to</b> possess an income like that? You could surround yourself with it like a halo. You could eat it, wear it, and breathe it every second of your life. You could even use it as a means of escaping as often as possible from the somewhat inevitable but highly objectionable adjunct who seems now to be peering at us through the door. Be a wise girl, Anne. An income like that doesn't depend upon discretions or indiscretions. Besides, as a matter of fact, I really do not think that that young man knows {{what it is to be}} indiscreet. Remember, I am quite serious. A hundred thousand a year should lift any man beyond the pale of criticism." ...|$|R
