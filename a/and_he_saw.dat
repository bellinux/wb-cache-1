5|$|Goebbels, however, wanted more, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> in Wessel's {{shooting}} {{the possibility of}} a propaganda bonanza. The beginning of his plan was to turn Wessel's funeral into a mass demonstration full of speeches and processions of SA men in uniform, but he could not get the necessary police permits to do so, even after Wessel's sister requested Hindenburg to relent.|$|E
5|$|According to Znaniecki, {{sociology}} can {{be divided}} into the study of four dynamic social systems: social action theory, social relation theory, social actors theory, and social groups theory. Znaniecki saw social actions as the foundation of a society, as they give rise to more complex social relations, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> this theory as the foundation of all the others. Unlike Max Weber, he did not believe that everything can be reduced to social actions; he was also quite skeptical of any insights coming from the science of psychology, which he held in low esteem.|$|E
5|$|One of President Garfield's more wearying duties {{was seeing}} office seekers, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> Guiteau at least once. White House {{officials}} suggested to Guiteau that he approach Blaine, as the consulship {{was within the}} Department of State. Blaine also saw the public regularly, and Guiteau became a regular at these sessions. Blaine, who {{had no intention of}} giving Guiteau a position he was unqualified for and had not earned, simply stated that the deadlock in the Senate over Robertson's nomination made it impossible to consider the Paris consulship, which required Senate confirmation. Once the New York senators had resigned, and Robertson had been confirmed as Collector, Guiteau pressed his claim, and Blaine told him he would not receive the position.|$|E

60|$|<b>And</b> when <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> him <b>he</b> stopped awhile, for he {{had never}} seen so strange a beast. His body was a man’s: but his head was the head of a bull; and his teeth were the teeth of a lion, <b>and</b> with them <b>he</b> tore his prey. <b>And</b> when <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> Theseus <b>he</b> roared, <b>and</b> put his head down, and rushed right at him.|$|R
5|$|Blaine saw {{presiding}} over the cabinet {{as a chance to}} preside over the Washington social scene, as well, and soon ordered construction of a new, larger home near Dupont Circle. Although his foreign policy experience was minimal, Blaine quickly threw himself into his new duties. By 1881, Blaine had completely abandoned his protectionist leanings and now used his position as Secretary of State to promote freer trade, especially within the western hemisphere. His reasons were twofold: firstly, Blaine’s old fear of British interference in the Americas was undiminished, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> increased trade with Latin America as the best way to keep Britain from dominating the region. Secondly, he believed that by encouraging exports, he could increase American prosperity, and by doing so position the Republican party as the author of that prosperity, ensuring continued electoral success. Garfield agreed with his Secretary of State’s vision and Blaine called for a Pan-American conference in 1882 to mediate disputes among the Latin American nations and to serve as a forum for talks on increasing trade. At the same time, Blaine hoped to negotiate a peace in the War of the Pacific then being fought by Bolivia, Chile, and Peru. Blaine favored a resolution that would not result in Peru yielding any territory, but Chile, which had by 1881 occupied the Peruvian capital, rejected any negotiations that would gain them nothing. Blaine sought to expand American influence in other areas, calling for renegotiation of the Clayton–Bulwer Treaty to allow the United States to construct a canal through Panama without British involvement, as well as attempting to reduce British involvement in the strategically located Kingdom of Hawaii. His plans for the United States' involvement in the world stretched even beyond the Western Hemisphere, as he sought commercial treaties with Korea and Madagascar.|$|E

25|$|Only {{the first}} few episodes of Broadchurch series one were written before filming began. Chibnall waited until casting was {{complete}} <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> the actors performing their roles. The later scripts were then shaped {{to take advantage of}} these performances.|$|E

25|$|Faced {{with this}} serious {{challenge}} to {{the unity of the}} republic, Sukarno declared martial law (Staat van Oorlog en Beleg) on 14 March 1957. He appointed a non-partisan prime minister Djuanda Kartawidjaja, while the military was in the hands of his loyal General Nasution. Nasution increasingly shared Sukarno's views on the negative impact of western democracy on Indonesia, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> a greater role for the military in political life.|$|E
25|$|Pakistan cricket was {{involved}} by dissension and controversies over the national team's poor performance during {{the tour of}} India and a public uproar forced {{the end of the}} Ad Hoc Committee. The chairman and team captain Asif Iqbal had to step down. Air Marshal Nur Khan now became chairman <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> the banks and other organisations increase their participation on the Board Council in the face of protests from the zonal organisations.|$|E

25|$|Major-General John Gaspard Le Marchant (9 February 1766 – 22 July 1812) {{was one of}} {{the finest}} British cavalry commanders of his generation; he was also an {{intellectual}} soldier who had a great influence on the efficient functioning of the army he served in. He was instrumental in the process which produced the first British military academy and staff college; <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> active service in the French Revolutionary Wars and the Peninsular War.|$|E
25|$|Eliot was in Oxford for {{one year}} only, and was {{expected}} to return to Harvard to begin a career as an academic philosopher, an idea he railed against. He {{wanted to be a}} poet. He had completed The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock in 1911, the poem that was to make his name when it was published in Chicago in 1915, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> remaining in England as a way to escape his parents' plans for him.|$|E
25|$|Following in the Pauline tradition, in the 5th century Augustine of Hippo viewed Christ as the {{mediator}} of the New Covenant between God and man {{and as the}} conqueror over sin. He viewed Christ as the cause and reason for the reconciliation of man with God {{after the fall of}} Adam, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> in Christ the path to Christian salvation. Augustine believed that salvation is available to those who are worthy of it, through faith in Christ.|$|E

25|$|On June 28, Pederson left a {{game against}} the Milwaukee Brewers after spraining his right AC joint while making a diving catch against the outfield wall; he was placed on the DL three days later, and {{returned}} on July 19. He appeared in 137 games in 2016, batting 246/.352/.495 with 25 home runs, 25 doubles, and 68 RBIs. His 25 home runs averaged a distance of 412.1 feet (the 7th-longest average distance of any MLB hitter), <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> 4.18 pitches-per-plate-appearance (10th-most in the NL).|$|E
25|$|John Dickson became {{in effect}} {{the driving force}} of the Dulas Valley Mineral Railway, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> that the line would only reach its {{potential}} if it extended at each end. In the1863 session of Parliament, therefore, the company promoted a Swansea and Neath and Brecon Railway. Swansea docks were as yet undeveloped but clearly had much greater potential than Neath. Extension north-eastward to Brecon would connect there with the Brecon and Merthyr Railway, itself connecting with a chain of other lines reaching to Hereford and beyond.|$|E
25|$|Now the Lord {{had shown}} unto me, Abraham, the intelligences that were {{organized}} {{before the world}} was; and among all these there were many of the noble and great ones; And God saw these souls that they were good, and {{he stood in the}} midst of them, and he said: These I will make my rulers; for he stood among those that were spirits, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> that they were good; and he said unto me: Abraham, thou art one of them; thou wast chosen before thou wast born.|$|E

25|$|Huxley {{used the}} setting and {{characters}} in his science fiction novel to express widely held opinions, particularly {{the fear of}} losing individual identity in the fast-paced world of the future. An early trip to the United States gave Brave New World much of its character. Not only was Huxley outraged by the culture of youth, commercial cheeriness and sexual promiscuity, and the inward-looking nature of many Americans, he had also found the book My Life and Work by Henry Ford on the boat to America, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> the book's principles applied in everything he encountered after leaving San Francisco.|$|E
25|$|In {{his younger}} days Hume had studied some geology {{from the likes}} of Gideon Mantell and he {{appreciated}} the synthesis of ideas from other fields in ornithology. Hume included in 1872, a detailed article on the osteology of birds in relation to their classification written by Richard Lydekker who was then in the Geological Survey of India. The early meteorological work in India was done within the department headed by Hume <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> the value of meteorology in the study of bird distributions. In a work comparing the rainfall zones, he notes how the high rainfall zones indicated affinities to the Malayan fauna.|$|E
25|$|John Roach {{meanwhile}} {{was planning}} to add shipbuilding to his engine building business, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> the Morgan Iron Works with its dockyard on the East River as a stepping stone toward this goal. When in 1867 he offered to purchase the Morgan Works, Morgan was ready to sell, and the two agreed upon a price of $450,000, divided into a cash payment of $100,000 and two mortgages of $100,000 and $250,000. Roach would soon run into cash flow problems {{of his own and}} consequently defaulted on both mortgages; Morgan however chose not to foreclose and Roach settled the debts shortly before Morgan's death in 1878.|$|E
