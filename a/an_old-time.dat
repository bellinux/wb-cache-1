5|$|Expedition to the Barrier Peaks {{was first}} {{played at the}} Origins II {{convention}} in 1976, where {{it was used to}} introduce Dungeons & Dragons players to the science fiction game Metamorphosis Alpha. In 1980, TSR published the adventure, updated for first edition Advanced Dungeons & Dragons rules. The adventure was not updated for later rules systems, but a Wizards.com article did provide a conversion to Future Tech. It included a separate booklet of illustrations, in both color and black and white. The adventure is <b>an</b> <b>old-time</b> favorite of many Dungeons & Dragons fans, including Stephen Colbert. It was ranked the fifth-best Dungeons & Dragons adventure of all time by Dungeon magazine in 2004, and received positive reviews from White Dwarf and The Space Gamer magazines. The other adventures in the S series include S1 Tomb of Horrors, S2 White Plume Mountain, and S4 Lost Caverns of Tsojcanth.|$|E
5|$|Flywheel, Shyster, and Flywheel is a {{situation}} comedy radio show starring two of the Marx Brothers, Groucho and Chico, and written primarily by Nat Perrin and Arthur Sheekman. The series was originally broadcast in the United States on the National Broadcasting Company's Blue Network beginning November 28, 1932, and ended May 22, 1933. Sponsored by the Standard Oil Companies of New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Louisiana and the Colonial Beacon Oil Company, it was the Monday night installment of the Five-Star Theater, <b>an</b> <b>old-time</b> radio variety series that offered a different program each weeknight.

25|$|Old-time {{music is}} played using {{a wide variety}} of {{stringed}} instruments. The instrumentation of <b>an</b> <b>old-time</b> group is often determined by what instruments are available, as well as by tradition. The most common instruments are acoustic string instruments. Historically, the fiddle was nearly always the leading melodic instrument, and in many instances (if no other instruments were available) dances were accompanied only by a single fiddler, who often also acted as dance caller.|$|E

Lair lived in and around Borger and Panhandle, Texas until 1940, when he moved to Waco. He graduated from 11 years of schooling at Waco High School, at age 16. He took some post-high school courses while working for the Panhandle Herald and a grocery store.|$|E
25|$|Old-Timey {{cartoons}} {{take place}} in <b>an</b> <b>old-time</b> setting, {{with most of the}} characters being Old-Timey counterparts of the Homestar Runner characters. These cartoons are in black and white with a film grain effect and scratchy audio quality. They parody the distinctive style of animated cartoons during the 1920s and 1930s (à la Steamboat Willie), and can be seen as perhaps deliberately unfunny, to make a slanted joke about such old-style cartoons. The versions of the characters are, for the most part, similar to their standard counterparts. The names are mostly slightly changed (for instance, Homestar Runner becomes The Homestar Runner, and The Cheat becomes The Sneak) but some are completely different; for example, Pom Pom's equivalent is called Fat Dudley and Strong Sad's equivalent is called Sickly Sam.|$|E
25|$|During {{his years}} in the U.S. House of Representatives Carper sought to gain better control of the Democratic Party {{organization}} in Delaware in hopes of someday becoming governor. Heavily Democratic and with {{over half of the}} population of the state, New Castle County was the key. Its Democratic organization was controlled by Eugene T. Reed, a former ironworker, and <b>an</b> <b>old-time</b> political party boss who was then among several politicians in both parties implicated in illegal money raising practices. To address this corruption and rescue the reputation of the Democratic Party, Carper recruited Joseph E. Reardon, a DuPont Company chemist, as a candidate for New Castle County Democratic Party chairman. By early 1989, he had succeeded in getting Reardon elected, and Reardon replaced Reed at the head of a newly reformed party organization. In 1990 Carper faced a primary challenge from a Reed ally, Daniel D. Rappa, but crushed him convincingly and went on to win election to his fifth term as U.S. Representative.|$|E

25|$|In {{the last}} half of the 1990s, Mochizuki {{directed}} a series of yakuza movies that are considered his best work. Some of the films were a collaboration with novelist Yukio Yamanouchi who had once been a legal advisor to one of the yakuza syndicates. The first of the films, Another Lonely Hitman, about <b>an</b> <b>old-time</b> yakuza hitman who ends up battling his own gang, was released in 1995. The movie took the Best Film award at the 5th Japan Film Professional Awards and Mochizuki won the Best Director award. What critics consider his best film appeared in 1997, Onibi or The Fire Within, another study of an aging yakuza trying to go straight. Onibi won the Best Film award at the 19th Yokohama Film Festival and Mochizuki took the festival's Best Director award for this movie and his other 1997 film A Yakuza in Love. These were followed by the 1998 manga-based Mobster's Confession, a comical, cynical account of a small-time gangster and his girlfriend. By this time, Mochizuki had begun to attain an international reputation and the Rotterdam Film Festival held a ten-film retrospective on the director in 1998.|$|E

500|$|A fire {{destroyed}} {{half the}} village in 1895, burning 26 buildings and causing more than $125,000 in damage. The village had no form of fire protection, though {{there had been an}} attempt prior to the fire to establish such a utility. Ironically, [...] "those who were the heaviest losers by the fire were the ones who worked hardest to defeat the movement". About 10,000 people came to Rosendale following the fire to look at the charred remains, packing {{the village in}} [...] "a scene [...] <b>an</b> <b>old-time</b> country fair". In 1900, the village attempted to purchase a water plant for $40,000. The New York & Rosendale Cement Company sued to prevent bonding for the purchase. Before the case could reach the New York Supreme Court, Appellate Division, the village elected a new board of trustees, which attempted to block the purchase. They were unsuccessful and the village was forced to complete the purchase in 1903. The village enacted an ordinance in December 1901 to remove snow, ice and dirt from local gutters and sidewalks. Power lines were built throughout the village in 1906.|$|E

500|$|Robert Canning of IGN {{wrote that}} [...] "this is why 30 Rock {{is still a}} show you can't miss. Even the weaker episodes can be damn funny." [...] Canning rated the episode 7.7 out of 10.

[...] Alan Sepinwall of The Star-Ledger said that [...] "I saw [...] "Subway Hero" [...] a while back, and as I wrote in my column last week, my {{reaction}} to it was roughly {{the same as it was}} to [...] "MILF Island": a number of very funny individual moments, but an episode that was less than the sum of its parts." [...] David Hinckley of The New York Daily News said that there were [...] "a lot of former-boyfriend gags that are, once again, well-formulated" [...] in this episode and that [...] "They work." [...] Hinckley also wrote that [...] "the real reason [...] is must-see TV is a guest spot by Tim Conway as <b>an</b> <b>old-time</b> television star whose deadpan recollections of the [...] "good old days" [...] keep getting weirder and funnier. He darn near steals the show." ...|$|E
500|$|Race is a {{polarizing}} theme {{throughout the}} story. As William M. Morgan wrote, while the white characters are largely depicted as cold and humorless, {{and the black}} characters as warm and amusing, the town's racial hierarchy is omnipresent. Slavery is referred to several times throughout the story, as critic Nan Goodman noted; as a post-Civil War work, The Monster revisits slavery's legacy, {{as well as its}} effects on modern African Americans like Henry Johnson. At the beginning of the story, it is made clear that the white townspeople tolerate Henry because he [...] "behaves himself" [...] and [...] "knows his place" [...] as a black man. Later, when Henry struggles through the burning house to save Jimmie, it is said that [...] "he was submitting, submitting because of his fathers, bending his mind in a most perfect slavery to this conflagration." [...] However, while his suffering is central to the story, Henry Johnson is never really fleshed out as a character; before the fire, he [...] "strikes in quick succession the minstrel's poses of <b>an</b> <b>old-time,</b> happy-go-lucky Negro", who charms children and women alike. Despite his heroism, Morgan stated, Henry does not stray far from a racial stereotype. Critics such as Lillian Gilkes and John R. Cooley have noted Crane's lack of racial sensitivity while writing The Monster, although they note that the author was simply exhibiting [...] "unconscious racism" [...] in order to fulfill literary conventions of the late 19th century. [...] In his 2002 essay, [...] "Blunders of Virtue: The Problem of Race in Stephen Crane's 'The Monster'", John Clemen sums up the critics' tendency to either [...] "ignore the evidence of Crane's racism, to dismiss it as [...] a cultural influence irrelevant to his larger purposes, or to reconfigure it within his irony {{in such a way as}} to enable the story and its author to achieve an unintended racial insight." ...|$|E
