One squad took up a {{position}} at the pit number three coal shed; another, <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>pump</b> house. A warning party was sent ahead of the squads into Chinatown.

After only 30 minutes, the first gunshots were fired by the squad <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>pump</b> house, followed by a volley from those at the coal shed. Lor Sun Kit, a Chinese laborer, was shot and fell to the ground. As the group at coal pit number three rejoined them, the crowd pressed on toward Chinatown, some men firing their weapons as they went. The smaller group of white miners at the plank bridge divided itself into squads and surrounded Chinatown. One squad stayed at the plank bridge to cut off any Chinese escape.|$|E

5|$|According to two {{separate}} research {{studies conducted in}} 2009, {{at the national level}} 65% of the flex-fuel registered vehicles regularly used ethanol fuel, and the usage climbed to 93% in São Paulo, the main ethanol producer state where local taxes are lower, and prices <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>pump</b> are more competitive than gasoline. However, as a result of higher ethanol prices caused by the Brazilian ethanol industry crisis that began in 2009, combined with government subsidies to keep gasoline price lower than the international market value, by November 2013 only 23% flex-fuel car owners were using ethanol, down from 66% in 2009.|$|E

40|$|Published October 6, 2016, {{as part of}} the Proceedings of the 2015 Mathematics and Statistics in Industry Study Group. We {{consider}} the pressure pulse or surge in a pipeline due to an unplanned sudden shutdown of a <b>pump</b> system in <b>the</b> pipeline network. This is known as water hammer. Our primary focus is the negative pressure pulse that travels downstream from <b>the</b> <b>pump(s),</b> is reflected with a sign reversal from the end, and travels back to <b>the</b> <b>pump(s).</b> As part of the preliminary design of a pipeline it is necessary to determine the minimum head envelope associated with such an event, which is used to determine where surge protection will be needed in the pipeline. Of particular interest is whether the initial head drop <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>pump(s)</b> due to a sudden drop of the flow speed to zero, as given by the Joukowski formula, gives a sufficiently accurate prediction of <b>the</b> minimum head <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>pump(s).</b> This minimum head is used to construct the minimum head envelope for the downstream pipeline. An examination of the relevant literature along with solution of the water hammer equations shows that, assuming the flow speed falls instantaneously to zero <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>pump(s),</b> <b>the</b> total drop in head <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>pump(s)</b> is given by the sum of the initial Joukowski head change and the friction loss under normal operating conditions. While the friction loss may not be significant in short pipelines, in long pipelines it cannot be neglected. Y. M., Stokes, A. Miller, G. Hockin...|$|R
25|$|In 2007, in the United States, average retail (<b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>pump)</b> prices, {{including}} {{federal and}} state fuel taxes, of B2/B5 were lower than petroleum diesel by about 12cents, and B20 blends {{were the same as}} petrodiesel. However, as part of a dramatic shift in diesel pricing, by July 2009, the US DOE was reporting average costs of B20 15cents per gallon higher than petroleum diesel ($2.69/gal vs. $2.54/gal). B99 and B100 generally cost more than petrodiesel except where local governments provide a tax incentive or subsidy.|$|E

500|$|In {{order to}} achieve these goals several {{government}} incentives were implemented. Ethanol, as the other biofuels, was exempted of both, the CO2 and energy taxes until 2009, resulting in a 30% price reduction <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>pump</b> of E85 fuel over gasoline. Furthermore, other demand side incentives for flexifuel vehicle owners include a [...] bonus to buyers of FFVs, exemption from the Stockholm congestion tax, up to 20% discount on auto insurance, free parking spaces {{in most of the}} largest cities, owner annual registration taxes, and a 20% tax reduction for flexifuel company cars. Also, a part of the program, the Swedish Government ruled that 25% of their vehicle purchases (excluding police, fire and ambulance vehicles) must be alternative fuel vehicles. By the first months of 2008, this package of incentives resulted in sales of flexible-fuel cars representing 25% of new car sales.|$|E

500|$|Outside work, {{mostly on}} public infrastructure, {{continued}} beyond the convict era, but gradually declined due to discipline concerns, {{the rise of}} trade unions that saw such work as [...] "a threat to free labour", and an increasing emphasis on work as rehabilitation rather than punishment. By 1911 outside work had all but ceased, but could not adequately be replaced by employment within the prison walls; a lack of suitable work plagued the prison throughout its lifetime. Work in the 19th century consisted of cooking, washing clothes, cleaning the prison, tailoring, bootmaking, and printing. However, demand exceeded the availability of such work – increasingly so in the later years of the 19th century – so prisoners were also given activities with no practical value other than keeping them occupied. These included breaking stones, operating a water pump, and oakum picking. Even with these extra activities, by 1899, 60 to 70 men were employed <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>pump,</b> each doing {{only a few minutes}} work per hour, and occupied {{the rest of the time}} with recreation such as draughts.|$|E
