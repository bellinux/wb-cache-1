40|$|Software-intensive systems {{require the}} {{verification}} of functional and non-functional properties before the implementation and integration {{phases of the}} development process. In recent trends, the Architecture Analysis and Design Language (AADL) has proven <b>a</b> good candidate <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>modeling</b> language for software-intensive systems. At the same time, Model Driven Development (MDD) is gaining popularity <b>as</b> <b>a</b> development process. In this paper, we explore the use of AADL in <b>a</b> <b>model</b> driven development process from a usability point of view. Three issues regarding the usability of AADL <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>modeling</b> language for software-intensive systems are identified, namely system versus software level, complex component composition and property ambiguity. For resolving these issues, an approach is presented through integration of AADL <b>models</b> in <b>a</b> <b>model</b> driven development process with specifically designed model transformations. This approach enhances the usability of AADL for software developers. ...|$|R
