5|$|Helper T cells express T {{cell receptors}} (TCR) that {{recognize}} antigen bound to Class II MHC molecules. The MHC:antigen complex is also {{recognized by the}} helper cell's CD4 co-receptor, which recruits molecules inside the T cell (e.g., Lck) {{that are responsible for}} the T cell's activation. Helper T cells have a weaker association with the MHC:antigen complex than observed for killer T cells, meaning many receptors (around 200–300) on the helper T cell must be bound by an MHC:antigen in order to activate the helper cell, while killer T cells can be activated by engagement of a single MHC:antigen molecule. Helper T cell activation also requires longer duration of engagement with an <b>antigen-presenting</b> <b>cell.</b> The activation of a resting helper T cell causes it to release cytokines that influence the activity of many cell types. Cytokine signals produced by helper T cells enhance the microbicidal function of macrophages and the activity of killer T cells. In addition, helper T cell activation causes an upregulation of molecules expressed on the T cell's surface, such as CD40 ligand (also called CD154), which provide extra stimulatory signals typically required to activate antibody-producing B cells.|$|E

25|$|In {{the early}} stages of allergy, a type I {{hypersensitivity}} reaction against an allergen encountered {{for the first time and}} presented by a professional <b>antigen-presenting</b> <b>cell</b> causes a response in a type of immune cell called a TH2 lymphocyte, which belongs to a subset of T cells that produce a cytokine called interleukin-4 (IL-4). These TH2 cells interact with other lymphocytes called B cells, whose role is production of antibodies. Coupled with signals provided by IL-4, this interaction stimulates the B cell to begin production of a large amount of a particular type of antibody known as IgE. Secreted IgE circulates in the blood and binds to an IgE-specific receptor (a kind of Fc receptor called FcεRI) on the surface of other kinds of immune cells called mast cells and basophils, which are both involved in the acute inflammatory response. The IgE-coated cells, at this stage, are sensitized to the allergen.|$|E

40|$|The immune {{response}} to certain synthetic polypeptide antigens and native proteins {{has been shown}} to be controlled by {{immune response}} (Ir) genes, which reside in the murine major histoeompatibility complex (MHC) 1 (reviewed in 1). The expression of such Ir gene control has been localized to T cells, B <b>cells,</b> and/or <b>antigen-presenting</b> <b>cells</b> (2 - 4). Support for the concept of Ir gene expression in <b>antigen-presenting</b> <b>cells</b> depends largely upon the observations that T cells from (high responder × low responder) Fl animals recognize (respond to) antigen in the context of antigen presentation by high responder <b>antigen-presenting</b> <b>cells.</b> Such immune T cells are not stimulated by antigen presented by <b>antigen-presenting</b> <b>cells</b> of low responder strains (5 - 7). Based upon these observations, it has been suggested that phenotypic low responsiveness is due to the inability of low responder <b>antigen-presenting</b> <b>cells</b> to process or bind antigen in such a way that it can be effectively recognized by T cells. Alternatively, these results can be interpreted to suggest that there are "holes " in the T cell repertoire in low responder mice (8).
