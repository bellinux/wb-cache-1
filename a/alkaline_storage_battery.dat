While there he earned the nickname [...] "the Wizard of Menlo Park." [...] Before his death at age 83 in 1931, the prolific inventor amassed a record 1,093 patents for creations including the phonograph, a stock ticker, the motion-picture camera, the incandescent light bulb, a mechanical vote counter, the <b>alkaline</b> <b>storage</b> <b>battery</b> including one for an electric car, and the first commercial electric light.|$|E

50|$|Alvin J. Salkind (June 12, 1927 - June 9, 2015) was an American {{chemical}} engineer. Salkind {{is known}} for writing the seminal texts <b>Alkaline</b> <b>Storage</b> <b>Batteries</b> with S.

Among his many scientific contributions, Salkind was the first to build a battery into an x-ray port tracking structure with state of charge.

40|$|A {{membrane}} that is insoluble {{in an aqueous}} {{alkali metal}} hydroxide medium is described. The membrane is a resin which is a water-soluble C 2 -C 4 hydroxyalkyl cellulose ether polymer and an insolubilizing agent for controlled water sorption, a dialytic and electrodialytic membrane.

5000|$|The antenna was {{suspended}} from a steel tower on the Electrical Engineering Building {{in which the}} station was located {{on the third floor}} to another tower atop the dormitory next door. Details of its construction are not available.The main station receiver was an early model Coast Guard tuner consisting of multi-tapped coils with both coarse and fine tuning taps supplemented by a variable air condenser. This tuning unit was connected to a World War I Signal Corps VT-1 vacuum tube detector unit and a two-tube audio amplifier. Filament voltage was obtained from Signal Corps <b>alkaline</b> <b>storage</b> <b>batteries</b> and the high voltage was provided by conventional [...] "B" [...] batteries. By today's standards such a receiver would be useless with crowded signals, but at that time it worked out fairly well.|$|R
5000|$|Thomas Edison National Historical Park {{preserves}} Thomas Edison's {{laboratory and}} residence, Glenmont, in Llewellyn Park in West Orange in Essex County, New Jersey, United States. For more than 40 years, the laboratory {{had a major}} impact on the lives of people worldwide. Out of the West Orange laboratories came the motion picture camera, improved phonographs, sound recordings, silent and sound movies and the nickel-iron <b>alkaline</b> electric <b>storage</b> <b>battery.</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{discharge}} capacity of sintered silver electrodes in KOH solutions was improved 40 - 50 % when the prior charge {{was made by}} a 60 cps asymmetric a. c. composed of two opposing hal f-wave currents 180 ~ out of phase, rather than a constant charge current, both at the 20 -hr rate in 35 % KOH at 25 ~ Commercial Ag-Zn cells containing similar silver electrodes gave capacity increases of 15 - 25 % under the same conditions. Capacity depended on the proportion of charge and discharge components of the a. c. Capacity improve-ments were smaller when net charge current was at the 6 -hr rate, when charge current was composed of 60 cps hal f-wave reverse current super-imposed on constant charge current, or when the KOH concentration was increased. No significant improvement occurred when the charge with re-verse current followed a series of discharges at the 1 -hr rate.

50|$|As {{stated in}} the {{previous}} section, there were many busy suburban railroads in the Soviet Union which required a faster and more powerful replacement for the obsolete S units, but also one which was compatible with the low passenger platforms used on these lines (which the ER1 could not accommodate). Accordingly, {{it was decided to}} update the ER1 trainsets with exits which were compatible with both high and low platforms; the updated design was {{to be known as the}} ER2. The new exits required changes to the underframe, which could have had deleterious consequences for the cars' structural integrity; to avoid this, the cars' side walls, headstocks, door frames, and head-end bulkheads (on cars with engineers' cabs) had to be reinforced. Also, to maximize commonality of parts with the ER9 AC electric trainsets (which were to be produced concurrently with the ER2 on the same assembly lines), the brakes were redesigned—instead of 1 master cylinder actuating all of a given car's brake shoes, 4 brake cylinders were installed (2 per truck). The designers also took the opportunity to improve the electrical equipment: lead-acid <b>storage</b> <b>batteries</b> were replaced with safer <b>alkaline</b> <b>storage</b> <b>batteries,</b> and the motor-generator windings were redesigned. (Both of these improvements were already tested on selected ER1 trainsets.) The new trainset was given the factory designation 62-61.|$|R
