On Thursdays and Sundays, flights are handled {{in a period}} of a few hours in the mornings and on Saturdays only the evening hours are used.

25|$|In the {{universities}} of the UK there <b>are</b> <b>days</b> called scarlet days or red letter days. On such days, doctors {{of the university}} may wear their scarlet 'festal' or full dress gowns instead of their undress ('black') gown. This is more significant for the ancient universities such as Oxford and Cambridge where academic dress is worn almost daily, the black undress gown being worn on normal occasions {{as opposed to the}} bright red gowns. Since most universities have abandoned academic dress to the graduation ceremony (where doctors always wear scarlet), the significance of scarlet days has all but disappeared.|$|E

500|$|These <b>are</b> <b>days</b> {{which are}} {{associated}} with the life of Christ or the Apostles and deserve attention in their own right. Lesser Festivals do not have priority over festivals and technically do not have precedence over ordinary Sundays. However, the Lutheran Book of Worship does permit the celebration of a Lesser Festival on Sundays where the normal color of the day would be green (that is, seasons after Epiphany or after Pentecost) or on the Sundays in Christmas. This is abrogated for patronal festivals (that is, the day commemorating the saint or event for which a congregation is named) provided that they do not take place in Lent, Advent, or Easter, in which case they must also be transferred to the next convenient weekday. [...] Most Lesser Festivals have their own collects and a few, such as All Saints, have their own proper.|$|E
500|$|Following the race, Démare {{expressed}} delight at his victory, saying: [...] "There <b>are</b> <b>days</b> {{like this}} one in which everything works despite the occasional hiccup, like crashing {{at the bottom of the}} Cipressa. I made it across at the bottom of the Poggio and the entire way I felt fantastic. [...] This is a big one and has been running for over a century. It's extraordinary. I'm extremely happy." [...] Second placed Swift on the other hand, was disappointed by missing out on a possible win: [...] "Obviously, it's quite disappointing to get second – so close to the win – but you have got to be happy to be back on the podium in a Monument." [...] Fernando Gaviria shed tears after his late fall, which he felt cost him a possible victory: [...] "I am very sad about what happened. It was my fault, I was in a perfect position but then I lost my focus for two seconds, because I began thinking on how to sprint. I touched the wheel of the guy in front of me. That was enough to throw away all the hard work of the team." [...] Nacer Bouhanni in turn was furious after the finish. Some hundred metres before the finish line, he had been in a good position before his chain slipped off, taking away his chances. After crossing the line, he threw away his bike in anger.|$|E

500|$|Rollason began feeling unwell in 1996 {{during an}} eight-week {{assignment}} to the US, {{where she was}} covering that year's Olympic and Paralympic Games. She {{was diagnosed with cancer}} of the colon in August 1997, which she was told had also spread to her liver. She was initially given three months to live, but confounded medical opinion by fighting the disease long after that. She underwent treatment with chemotherapy, but also used a combination of holistic therapies and diet to treat her condition. The cancer later metastasised to her lungs. Rollason continued to work throughout her illness, despite sessions of chemotherapy that left her feeling weak, and cited her work as the thing that had kept her going throughout her treatment. [...] "I stay working because I love it, and because I feel best on the days when I'm busy. I'd far rather work than hang around the house – even though there <b>are</b> <b>days</b> when I can hardly get out of bed." [...] She presented sports bulletins for BBC News, wrote a weekly column about her illness for the Sunday Mirror Magazine and worked on a book about her experience that she hoped would help others diagnosed with the disease. She cited the determination of the many disabled athletes she had got to know through her work as having given her the strength of mind to fight her illness. In October 1998, the BBC aired a special edition of its QED documentary series titled Hope for Helen, which followed her as she underwent a course of treatment. The film earned her much support from the public for her courage. in December 1998, colleagues paid tribute to an emotional-looking Rollason during the BBC's Sports Review of the Year, a compliment that produced mixed feelings for the presenter. She later wrote of the incident, [...] "I felt a mixture of horror, embarrassment and incredible warmth towards my colleagues that they should think of doing this".|$|E
500|$|As {{the season}} wound down, Benfica was battling for a direct {{qualification}} for the Champions League with six matches remaining. On 6 April, the club played Boavista on the road. The hosts were undefeated at home since October, but Benfica {{had an opportunity}} to gain ground over Vitória de Guimarães (who had lost points hours earlier). Neither team could penetrate the other's defence, despite Boavista's 24th-minute penalty kick, and the game ended in a scoreless draw. Chalana was highly critical of the refereeing: [...] "What happened here was a disgrace." [...] The following Friday, Benfica hosted Académica. In the fourth minute Luisão lost the ball to Miguel Pedro, who scored for Académica. At the 30-minute mark, Markus Berger added another, and in the second half, Luis Aguiar scored a third. It was the fourth time in Benfica's history that they lost by three goals at home, matching their worst result in the Primeira Liga. They had lost 3–0 to Boavista in 1998–99 and 4–1 to Sporting CP in 1938–39 and 1947–48. Chalana was resigned: [...] "There <b>are</b> <b>days</b> like this." [...] With the loss, Benfica had lost 18 points in Luz, was 21 points behind Porto and fell from second to fourth place. On 16 April, the club visited the Alvalade for the Portuguese Cup semi-finals. Benfica began the game well, with first-half goals by Rui Costa and Nuno Gomes. Sporting mobilized in the second half, scoring three goals in 12 minutes. Rodríguez tied the game for Benfica before Sporting scored two more goals, eliminating Benfica. Chalana attributed the loss to poor refereeing: [...] "We started strong, scored two goals and could have scored a third if the referee had signalled a penalty over Luisão. It would be the 3–0 and would have killed the game." [...] Four days later, Benfica played Porto at the Estádio do Dragão. Lisandro López scored goals in the seventh and 80th minutes to give Porto a 2–0 win, increasing the difference between them to 24 points. Despite amassing five out of a possible 15 points since becoming manager and trailing second-place Vitória de Guimarães by four points, Chalana remained hopeful: [...] "Nothing is lost, Benfica will use all their weapons to win the remaining nine points." [...] The club's last April match was a 2–0 victory over Belenenses, with Chalana praising his players' performance against [...] "a very good team".|$|E

2500|$|Pope Pius XII had {{initially}} relaxed {{some of the}} regulations concerning fasting in 1956. [...] In 1966, Pope Paul VI in his apostolic constitution Paenitemini, changed the strictly regulated Roman Catholic fasting requirements. He recommended that fasting be appropriate to the local economic situation, and that all Catholics voluntarily fast and abstain. In the United States, {{there are only two}} obligatory days of fast – Ash Wednesday and Good Friday. The Fridays of Lent <b>are</b> <b>days</b> of abstinence: eating meat is not allowed. Pastoral teachings since 1966 have urged voluntary fasting during Lent and voluntary abstinence on the other Fridays of the year.
