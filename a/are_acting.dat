5|$|The player {{initially}} must {{enter their}} name into the device, which then displays {{a series of}} past lives the player has lived. The name is converted into its numerological equivalent. Above and below the central chamber are two other areas, called Kether and Malchut respectively, each of which houses a display screen with a mask-like face that provides the player with information about the next task. The motivations of the two organizations represented by the faces are murky, although it becomes clear they <b>are</b> <b>acting</b> in opposition to each other. Both masks refer to the player by their assigned number.|$|E
5|$|Historically, {{forces were}} first quantitatively {{investigated}} in conditions of static equilibrium where several forces canceled each other out. Such experiments demonstrate the crucial properties that forces are additive vector quantities: they have magnitude and direction. When two forces act {{on a point}} particle, the resulting force, the resultant (also called the net force), can be determined by following the parallelogram rule of vector addition: the addition of two vectors represented by sides of a parallelogram, gives an equivalent resultant vector that is equal in magnitude and direction to the transversal of the parallelogram. The magnitude of the resultant varies from the difference of the magnitudes of the two forces to their sum, depending on the angle between their lines of action. However, if the forces <b>are</b> <b>acting</b> on an extended body, their respective lines of application must also be specified in order to account for their effects on {{the motion of the}} body.|$|E
5|$|Khan {{realizes that}} he can make the girls winners only if he can help them {{overcome}} their differences. During his first few days as coach he benches several players who refuse to follow his rules—including Bindia Naik (Shilpa Shukla), his most experienced player. In response, Bindia repeatedly encourages the other players to defy Khan. When she finally succeeds, Khan angrily resigns; however, he invites the staff and team to a farewell lunch at McDonald's. During the lunch, local boys make a pass at Mary; Balbir attacks them, triggering a brawl between the boys and the team. Khan, recognizing that they <b>are</b> <b>acting</b> as one for the first time, prevents the staff from intervening; he only stops a man from hitting {{one of the women}} from behind with a cricket bat, telling him that there are no cowards in hockey. In an about-face, after the fight the women ask Khan to remain as their coach.|$|E

25|$|Good Samaritan laws {{may vary}} from {{jurisdiction}} to jurisdiction as do {{their interactions with}} various other legal principles, such as consent, parental rights {{and the right to}} refuse treatment. Most such laws do not apply to medical professionals' or career emergency responders' on-the-job conduct, but some extend protection to professional rescuers when they <b>are</b> <b>acting</b> in a volunteer capacity.|$|E
25|$|For instance, {{courts of}} law make {{judgments}} about whether individuals <b>are</b> <b>acting</b> {{under their own}} free will under certain circumstances without bringing in metaphysics. Similarly, political liberty is a non-metaphysical concept. Likewise, some compatibilists define free will as freedom to act according to one's determined motives without hindrance from other individuals. So for example Aristotle in his Nicomachean Ethics, and the Stoic Chrysippus.|$|E
5000|$|From mid-May until end-June, Lieutenant Bones <b>was</b> <b>acting</b> {{governor}} of Sierra Leone. While he <b>was</b> <b>acting</b> governor, Tigress remained at Freetown. However her boats continued to patrol for slave ships.|$|R

25|$|The {{classes of}} {{hypotheses}} {{based on the}} creation of variation are further broken down below. Any number of these hypotheses may be true in any given species (they are not mutually exclusive), and different hypotheses may apply in different species. However, a research framework based on creation of variation has yet to be found that allows one to determine whether the reason for sex is universal for all sexual species, and, if not, which mechanisms <b>are</b> <b>acting</b> in each species.|$|E
25|$|According to a review, {{the main}} {{mechanisms}} by which environmental compounds increase breast cancer risk <b>are</b> <b>acting</b> like hormones, especially estrogen, or affecting susceptibility to carcinogenesis. The evidence to date generally supports an association between breast cancer and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs). dioxins and organic solvents, on the other hand, have only shown an association in sparse and methodologically limited studies, but are suggestive of an association. Overall, however, evidence is still based on {{a relatively small number}} of studies.|$|E
25|$|In addition, one of {{the most}} {{important}} ("first rank") diagnostic symptoms of schizophrenia is the patient's delusion of being controlled by an external force. People with schizophrenia will sometimes report that, although they <b>are</b> <b>acting</b> in the world, they do not recall initiating the particular actions they performed. This is sometimes likened to being a robot controlled by someone else. Although the neural mechanisms of schizophrenia are not yet clear, one influential hypothesis is that there is a breakdown in brain systems that compare motor commands with the feedback received from the body (known as proprioception), leading to attendant hallucinations and delusions of control.|$|E
50|$|From March 2, 1815 to August 1, 1815 he <b>was</b> <b>acting</b> Secretary of War {{and for a}} {{time that}} year <b>was</b> <b>acting</b> Secretary of State as well. He {{returned}} to Philadelphia, but lived only a year.|$|R
50|$|He <b>was</b> <b>acting</b> chief commissary, {{and acting}} {{assistant}} adjutant-general Department of Missouri summer 1879. He was chief commissary {{officer in the}} District of New Mexico in Santa Fe until November, 1884. He <b>was</b> <b>acting</b> assistant adjutant-general and acting engineer officer at different times.|$|R
50|$|Alexander {{returned}} to Ceylon after the war, and was appointed Controller of Revenue in Ceylon in 1922. He <b>was</b> <b>acting</b> Colonial Secretary from 1925 to 1927, and <b>was</b> <b>acting</b> Governor from 18 October 1925 to 30 November 1925. He was succeeded by Hugh Clifford.|$|R
25|$|Unconscionable {{agreements}} can be escaped where {{a person}} was under duress or undue influence or their vulnerability was being exploited when they ostensibly agreed to a deal. Children, mentally incapacitated people and companies, whose representatives <b>are</b> <b>acting</b> wholly outside their authority, are protected against having agreements enforced against them where they lacked the real capacity {{to make a decision}} to enter an agreement. Some transactions are considered illegal, and are not enforced by courts because of a statute or on grounds of public policy. In theory, English law attempts to adhere to a principle that people should only be bound when they have given their informed and true consent to a contract.|$|E
25|$|This {{division}} {{is illustrated in}} a number of ways: The sovereign, for example, holds a unique Canadian title and, when she {{and other members of the}} Royal Family <b>are</b> <b>acting</b> in public specifically as representatives of Canada, they use, where possible, Canadian symbols, including the country's national flag, unique royal symbols, armed forces uniforms, and the like, as well as Canadian Forces aircraft or other Canadian-owned vehicles for travel. Once in Canadian airspace, or arrived at a Canadian event taking place abroad, the Canadian Secretary to the Queen, officers of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, and other Canadian officials will take over from whichever of their other realms' counterparts were previously escorting the Queen or other member of the Royal Family.|$|E
25|$|In Section II, Kant {{starts from}} scratch and {{attempts}} to move from popular moral philosophy to a metaphysics of morals. Kant begins Section II of the Groundwork by criticizing attempts to begin moral evaluation with empirical observation. He states that even when we take ourselves to be behaving morally, we cannot be at all certain that we are purely motivated by duty and not by inclinations. Kant observes that humans are quite good at deceiving themselves {{when it comes to}} evaluating their motivations for acting, and therefore even in circumstances where individuals believe themselves to be acting from duty, it is possible they <b>are</b> <b>acting</b> merely in accordance with duty and are motivated by some contingent desire. However, the fact that we see ourselves as often falling short of what morality demands of us indicates we have some functional concept of the moral law.|$|E

25|$|The Samak Sundaravej government, {{elected in}} the December 2007 general elections, came under {{pressure}} to resign since May 2008, when the People's Alliance for Democracy (PAD) reformed and staged regular street protests. They protested the government’s proposals to amend the 2007 constitution, claiming that Prime Minister Samak Sundaravej and his government <b>are</b> <b>acting</b> {{as a proxy for}} former deposed prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra. The PAD also criticized the Samak government's decision to support the Cambodian government's application for the listing of the disputed Preah Vihear Temple as a World Heritage site. Tensions rose between Thailand and Cambodia as the PAD called for Thai investors to withdraw from Cambodia, the closure of all 40 Thai-Cambodian border checkpoints, a ban on all flights from Thailand to Phnom Penh and Siem Reap, the construction of a naval base at Koh Kut near the border, and the abolition of the committee which oversees demarcation of overlapping sea areas and the unilateral declaration of a Thai marine map.|$|E
25|$|Tolerance {{occurs to}} the muscle-relaxant, anticonvulsant, and sleep-inducing effects of benzodiazepines, and upon {{cessation}} a benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome occurs. This {{can lead to}} benzodiazepines being taken for longer than originally intended, as people continue to take the drugs {{over a long period}} of time to suppress withdrawal symptoms. Some people abuse benzodiazepines at very high doses and devote a lot of time to doing so, satisfying the diagnostic criteria in DSM IV for substance abuse and dependence. Another group of people include those on low to moderate therapeutic doses of benzodiazepines who do not abuse their benzodiazepines but develop a tolerance and benzodiazepine dependence. A considerable number of individuals using benzodiazepines for insomnia escalate their dosage, sometimes above therapeutically-prescribed dose levels. Tolerance to the anxiolytic effect of benzodiazepines has been clearly demonstrated in rats. In humans, there is little evidence that benzodiazepines retain their anti-anxiety effects beyond four months of continuous treatment; there is evidence that suggests that long-term use of benzodiazepines may actually worsen anxiety, which in turn may lead to dosage escalation, with one study finding 25% of patients escalated their dosage. Some authors, however, consider benzodiazepines to be effective long-term; however, it is more likely that the drugs <b>are</b> <b>acting</b> to prevent rebound anxiety withdrawal effects. Tolerance to the anticonvulsant and muscle-relaxing effects of benzodiazepines occurs within a few weeks in most patients.|$|E
25|$|Possibly {{the most}} {{important}} aspect of good trust management is to have good trustees. In virtually all cases, a settlor will have identified who trustees will be, but even if not or the chosen trustees refuse a court will, in the last resort appoint one under the Public Trustee Act 1906. A court may also replace trustees who <b>are</b> <b>acting</b> detrimentally to the trusts. Once a trust is running, Trusts of Land and Appointment of Trustees Act 1996 section 19 allow beneficiaries of full capacity to determine who the new trustees are, if other replacement procedures are not in the trust document. This is, however, simply an articulation of the general principle from Saunders v Vautier that beneficiaries of full age and sound mind may by consensus dissolve the trust, or do with the property as they wish. According to the Trustee Act 2000 sections 11 and 15, a trustee may not delegate their power to distribute trust property without liability, but they may delegate administrative functions, and the power to manage assets if accompanied with a policy statement. If they do, they can be exempt from negligence claims. For the trust terms, these may be varied in any unforeseen emergency, but only in relation to the trustee's management powers, not a beneficiary's rights. The Variation of Trusts Act 1958 allows courts to vary trust terms, particularly on behalf of minors, people not yet entitled, or with remoter interests under a discretionary trust. For the latter group of people, who may have highly restricted rights, or know very little about a trust terms, the Privy Council affirmed in Schmidt v Rosewood Trust Ltd that courts have an inherent jurisdiction to administer trusts, and this goes especially to a requirement for information about a trust to be disclosed.|$|E

500|$|Nairi Hunanyan, {{the leader}} of the armed group, was an ex-member of the Armenian Revolutionary Federation (Dashnaktsutyun). According to the ARF representatives, Hunanyan was {{expelled}} from the party in 1992 for misconduct and had not been in any association with the ARF since then. Some speculations have been made about the involvement of the ARF in the shootings. Ashot Manucharyan stated in 2000 that he is much worried about the circumstance that [...] "a number of Dashnaktsutyun party leaders <b>are</b> <b>acting</b> {{in the interest of the}} American foreign policy." ...|$|E

He also declared that [...] "Western special services" [...] were involved in the October 27 events.
