Halfway into the cover, before beginning the new verse, Gaga says, [...] "So <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>tell,</b> I'm very outgoing {{and a little}} bit shy, but I've decided that this song is just too short. It's such a beautiful Christmas song but it's only one verse, so I added an extra one." [...] "You and I" [...] is devoid of the musical arrangements from the version in Born This Way, and features instrumentation from a piano and a trumpet, which is played halfway through the song. From time to time, Gaga shouts the word [...] "America" [...] while singing the song. Her acoustic version of [...] "The Edge of Glory" [...] begins with a monologue, explaining her dedication of the song to her grandfather: [...] "It's the second Thanksgiving I'm spending without my grandpa, and I wrote this song about him, so here it is. So Grandma, if you're watching at home, this one's for you." [...] Following the first chorus, Gaga stops playing her piano and tells a story about Italian cookies. A recurring theme for the songs is Gaga stopping midway through singing to engage in conversation with the listeners.|$|E

He stated: [...] "Katy and I went into [...] just to address some issues with [...] records that we had done in the past that didn't end up going on , so {{we are in the process}} of just listening and freshening up things and getting ready for something special she has going on", hinting that Teenage Dream would have a re-release. Stewart also added: [...] "We always knew that the records we created were special [...] at the time it was more contractual obligation , I can only have so many songs produced by me on the album, and she honestly didn't need any more records, <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>tell</b> by the success of this album, the songs have been flawless." [...] The producer later revealed one of the songs was titled [...] "Dressing Up", saying: [...] "This song is really special. It's called 'Dressing Up,' so it's going to be a big record, I think, it definitely fits. It's right there in what her sensibilities are as a musician and a songwriter. She doesn't change much. She has a very keen musical taste. It'll be really good".|$|E

'That drunkard,' said Beckwith, 'who had {{free access}} to your rooms at all times, that he might drink the strong drinks that you left in his way and be the sooner ended, holding no more terms with you than he would hold with a tiger, has had his master-key for all your locks, his test for all your poisons, his clue to your cipher- writing.

He has gone to meet de Tournay, St. Just and the other traitors, which for the moment, I thought, perhaps, he {{did not intend to}} do. When we find them, there will be a band of desperate men at bay. Some of our men will, I presume, be put HORS DE COMBAT.
