5|$|Matthew and Luke each {{describe}} Jesus' nativity (or birth), {{especially that}} Jesus was born by <b>a</b> <b>virgin</b> Mary in Bethlehem in fulfillment of prophecy.

Both accounts state that Jesus was born to Joseph and Mary, his betrothed, in Bethlehem, and both support {{the doctrine of the}} virgin birth of Jesus, according to which Jesus was miraculously conceived by the Holy Spirit in Mary's womb when she was still <b>a</b> <b>virgin.</b>|$|E

5|$|A month later, Jennifer is {{beginning}} to look pale, so she accepts a date with school goth/emo Colin, whom she brutally kills. While Needy and Chip have sex, Needy senses something dreadful has happened. She leaves in a panic and almost runs over Jennifer, who is drenched in blood. At home, she finds Jennifer in her bedroom. Jennifer kisses her, initiating a brief makeout session, and soon explains what happened after the fire: Low Shoulder took her {{into the woods and}} offered her as <b>a</b> <b>virgin</b> sacrifice to Satan in exchange for fame and fortune. Although the sacrifice and demonic exchange were a success, Jennifer was not <b>a</b> <b>virgin.</b> As a result, when lead singer Nikolai murdered her, the ritual backfired and a demonic spirit took over her body. Unbeknownst to Needy, Jennifer also encountered Indian exchange student Ahmet after the fire and, upon hearing that no one knew he had survived, took him into the woods and made him her first victim. Jennifer states that when she has eaten, she can withstand virtually any injury without pain, making her rather difficult to kill.|$|E
