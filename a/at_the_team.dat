5|$|As {{a result}} of the media interest, the ACB privately {{launched}} an investigation to determine if any Australian players had been involved with bookmakers. Journalists told officials about speculation that an Australian player was having financial dealings with bookmakers, after Mark Ray of the Sunday Age received an anonymous letter alleging that Waugh and Warne were being paid by a bookmaker for information. Following a private investigation opened by team manager Ian McDonald, Waugh and Warne wrote unsigned handwritten statements on 20 February 1995, acknowledging their involvement. The statements were faxed and sent to Graham Halbish, the CEO of the ACB. Warne and Waugh were called to Sydney for an interview with ACB chairman Alan Crompton <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>team</b> hotel, where the Australians had assembled before departing for a tour of the West Indies. The pair admitted their involvement with the bookmaker and were fined A$10,000 and A$8,000 respectively; at the time, these were the highest fines ever imposed on Australian cricketers.|$|E

5|$|Baroš joined Premier League side Portsmouth on {{loan from}} Lyon in January 2008 {{until the end of}} the season, with the option of making the move {{permanent}} at the end of the loan. Baroš played a significant role in the club winning the 2008 FA Cup. He won Portsmouth's match-winning penalty kick in the quarter-final at Manchester United and assisted Nwankwo Kanu's deciding goal in the semi final match against West Bromwich Albion with a suspected handball that went unnoticed by both the referee and his assistant. The final match of Baroš' loan spell was the 2008 FA Cup Final victory over Cardiff City at Wembley Stadium, where he appeared as an 87th-minute substitute for Kanu. By the end of the season, Baroš had played 16 matches for Portsmouth, including seven as a substitute, although he failed to score. He was one of a number of Portsmouth players to be absent <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>team</b> parade after the club won the FA Cup, leading to speculation he could have played his last game for the club. At the end of the season, Baroš returned to Lyon.|$|E
5|$|George Burley was {{appointed}} manager in January 2008. Burley suffered from disruptions to the squad. During a goalless home draw against Norway, Burley substituted in Chris Iwelumo, who missed an open goal from 3 yards. Striker Kris Boyd, {{who had been}} left on the bench, announced his retirement from international football. Burley dropped Barry Ferguson and Allan McGregor from the team for a qualifying match against Iceland after it was reported they had been drinking through the night <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>team</b> hotel. The two players made gestures at photographers while sitting on the substitutes' bench during the match against Iceland and were then banned by the SFA. Despite failing {{to qualify for the}} 2010 FIFA World Cup, the SFA initially decided to keep Burley in the job, but then decided to dismiss him after a heavy defeat in a friendly match against Wales.|$|E
5|$|His signing by the Steelers {{caused a}} social media {{backlash}} by many Steeler fans, with some {{saying that they}} would never support the team again. Fans who supported or were indifferent about the signing called such fans fair weather fans, and also cited that the Steelers have several players with questionable pasts, most notably Roethlisberger and James Harrison. The Animal Rescue League of Western Pennsylvania made a subtle jab <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>team</b> on Twitter by saying that they were now more proud to support the Pittsburgh Penguins and subsequently moved an upcoming fundraiser event from Heinz Field to Consol Energy Center. Steelers president Art Rooney II defended the Vick signing on KDKA-TV, saying that they felt that Vick had proven himself since being released from prison. The Steelers had considered signing Vick in 2009—both Vick and Steelers head coach Mike Tomlin are from the same part of Virginia and know each other well personally—but decided against it due to potential backlash since Vick at the time hadn't proven himself following his release from prison.|$|E

5|$|In {{the opening}} {{weekend of the}} season Manchester United faced Leicester City at Old Trafford, and went a goal down within seven minutes; Muzzy Izzet’s cross was met by Emile Heskey to scuff {{the ball into the}} net before Tony Cottee– the scorer in the {{previous}} season’s corresponding fixture– added a second with fifteen minutes remaining. Teddy Sheringham’s intervention and a last gasp free kick by David Beckham helped the home side salvage a point, setting a precedent for things to come. The team's first away game at West Ham followed, but despite the debut of striker Dwight Yorke, United were held to a goalless draw. Beckham, who had become a national hate figure after his dismissal in the World Cup, received a torrid reception by the home supporters, with every touch of the ball made by him jeered at. Bottles and stones were directed <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>team</b> coach prior to kick-off. After the game Ferguson, his players, and the Manchester United staff refused to be interviewed by the press or television.|$|E
5|$|After going undrafted in the 2013 NBA draft, Pressey {{signed with}} the Boston Celtics {{to play in the}} 2013 Orlando Summer League. He was a known {{commodity}} to the Celtics. Pressey's AAU team had even practiced <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>team</b> facility in Waltham. His performance in the Summer League led to Pressey signing a deal with the Celtics on July 22, 2013. The contract was believed to be a three-year deal for the league minimum, which was $490,180 during his rookie season. The Celtics began the season without four-time All-Star point guard Rajon Rondo who had endured a anterior cruciate ligament injury during the prior season. Pressey made his regular season debut in the 2013–14 Celtics season opener on October 30 at the Air Canada Centre against the Toronto. He did not play in the next three games, but after the Celtics got off to an 04 start, head coach Brad Stevens shuffled the lineup. On November 6, at home against the Utah Jazz, Pressey recorded the first three assists, first steal and first field goal of his career. Then on November 9, he posted four assists and tallied in 7 points in 21 minutes of play. He posted a team-high 5 assists on November 19, 2013 against the Houston Rockets. He established a new career high with 8 assists on November 25 against the Charlotte Bobcats. On January 15, with Rondo's return imminent, the Celtics traded guards Jordan Crawford and MarShon Brooks, clearing the way for Pressey to start that night against the Toronto Raptors. Pressey posted 10 assists and no turnovers in his first start. On January 22, with Rondo, Avery Bradley and Jerryd Bayless all sitting out and Pressey making his second career start, Pressey scored a career-high 20 points against Washington before fouling out. Since Rondo's return, Pressey's occasional starts have been to give Rondo rest. He posted a double-double on April 5 against the Detroit Pistons with 12 points and a career-high 11 assists. On April 11, he had another career high with 13 assists as part of a 10-point double double against the Charlotte Bobcats. He matched the 13 assists the following night against the Cleveland Cavaliers.|$|E
