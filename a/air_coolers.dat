The seasonal variations in electrocution-related deaths are due to differences in humidity, moisture, and individual behaviour. Higher incidents of electrocution deaths during summer may be due to increased humidity and high usage of electric appliances such as <b>coolers,</b> <b>air</b> conditioners, and refrigerators (Reddy and Sengottuvel 2014).

The tracer gas technique is used to experimentally measure the infiltration of warm <b>air</b> into walk-in <b>coolers</b> during its nominal operating conditions. The tracer gas samples captured before, during, and after the infiltration process are collected through sampling probes {{inside and outside the}} cooler. The infiltration rate can be calculated from this data. The transient nature of the infiltration rate that is captured in this approach signifies the shortcoming of the existing methodologies currently practiced in industry. It is found that the infiltration rate {{is a function of the}} temperature gradient between the inside and outside air, relative humidity, and the void volume in the cooler. It is also demonstrated that it is possible to derive a closed form equation based on the experimental data that can replace the current equations. dc 201...|$|R

40|$|International audienceProjections {{of future}} climate suggest {{increases}} in extreme temperatures particularly in mid latitudes. In addition, {{the effect of}} heat waves, which are becoming a major “summer killer”, is exacerbated in urban areas owing to the heat island effect. Air conditioning (A/C) is a key parameter for health problems in case of heat waves since, on one hand, it reduces mortality but, on the other hand, depending on the heat management, it can increase street temperature therefore increasing the air cooling demand. Results of a meso-scale meteorological model (MESO-NH), coupled to an urban energy balance model including a simplified building model (TEB), are used. Simulations based on a realistic spatial cartography of air-cooled chillers and cooling towers {{in the city of}} Paris and surroundings have been performed. The simulation period corresponds to the extreme heat wave in Paris: 9 – 13 August 2003. Five scenarios will be discussed: firstly a baseline without air-conditioning (NO-AC scenario); secondly the actual situation including individual <b>air</b> dry <b>coolers,</b> wet cooling towers and an urban cooling network relying on free-cooling (water-cooled A/C with the river Seine) (REAL scenario). A third scenario will assume that all the heat is rejected as sensible heat in the atmosphere (DRY AC scenario). Two other scenarios correspond to a prospective where A/C is doubled. Scenario 4 assumes that all the heat is rejected as sensible heat in the atmosphere (DRY ACx 2 scenario). On the opposite, scenario 5 assumes that all the heat is rejected underground or in the river Seine (NOREJ scenario). Results show that A/C affects the UHI depending on its management. A detailed analysis on selected districts shows that the local temperature variation resulting from heat island is proportional to the sensible heat rejected locally by A/C, indicating that a clever A/C management is all the more important to provide comfort and to mitigate heat island. Moreover, the incidence of the sky view factor is also discussed...|$|R
