DCS Gull also revealed that some items of women's clothing and accessories, including a handbag <b>and</b> <b>jacket,</b> had been recovered and were being forensically tested to establish whether they belonged to any of the murdered women.|$|E

The items and Kennedy's clothing were subsequently removed from the exhibit, with the LAPD apologizing to the Kennedy family.|$|E

The album became the band's first to top the charts in the United Kingdom, selling 24,000 copies in its debut week. The album also managed to reach higher chart positions worldwide than its predecessor Neighborhoods and outsold both its first-week and total sales in the US.

5|$|Ivy's {{alternate}} character {{designs in}} the games are a contrast to her primary designs, with the secondary from Soulcalibur to Soulcalibur III consisting of countess attire of either blue or red pants, vest, <b>and</b> <b>jacket,</b> with white boots covering her feet and her hair combed back. In Soulcalibur II, a tertiary alternate design was added consisting of a red leotard and gloves with gold trimming, with red stockings on her legs; in addition, a fourth design resembling her appearance {{at the conclusion of}} Soulcalibur was considered, incorporating a cloak and the symbol of caduceus on the front of her leotard cupping her breasts, but was unused. In Soulcalibur III, a long, rose-themed dress with hat and veil was used as a tertiary alternate, one of several considered designs. For Soulcalibur IV, a similarly themed black dress was used as her sole alternate design for the game.|$|E
5|$|Take Off Your Pants <b>and</b> <b>Jacket</b> is {{the fourth}} studio album by American rock band Blink-182. Produced by Jerry Finn, the album was {{released}} on June 12, 2001, through MCA Records. The band {{had spent much of}} the previous year traveling and supporting their third album Enema of the State (1999), which launched the band's mainstream career. The title is a tongue-in-cheek pun on male masturbation ("take off your pants and jack it"). The cover art has icons for each member of the trio: an airplane ("take off"), a pair of pants, and a jacket. The album's first, limited pressing came in three separate discs reflecting each icon and containing separate bonus tracks and joke songs.|$|E

5|$|The {{album was}} {{recorded}} over three months at Signature Sound in San Diego. During the sessions, MCA executives pressured the band {{to retain the}} sound that helped their previous album sell millions. As such, Take Off Your Pants <b>and</b> <b>Jacket</b> continues the pop punk sound that the group honed and made famous, albeit with a heavier tone inspired by groups such as Fugazi and Refused. Regarding lyrics, the album {{has been referred to}} as a concept album chronicling adolescence, with songs dedicated to first dates, fighting authority and teenage parties. Due to differing opinions on direction, the trio worked in opposition to one another for the first time, and the sessions sometimes became contentious.|$|E
5|$|This is {{followed}} with Spears performing a dance routine inside a blacklight paint graffiti room, {{and the two}} women dancing around a metal bedframe. Spears then begins chasing Madonna in a wooden-like maze, and the latter enters a room covered with fallen leaves and stands in a swing. Once Spears finds the room, Madonna {{is nowhere to be}} found. Throughout the video, Madonna gradually loses her symbolic power, paralleled by her disposing the cane <b>and</b> <b>jacket,</b> becoming less phallic and more noticeably female biologically and more feminine socially. Although it ultimately seems that Spears becomes the dominant figure, Madonna recovers her phallic power {{in the form of a}} cigar from an onlooking male. Spears appears in Madonna's room and throws her against the wall, and Madonna vanishes just as they are about to kiss. The video ends as Madonna's laugh is heard in the background.|$|E
5|$|Blink-182 {{consisted}} of guitarist Tom DeLonge, bassist Mark Hoppus and drummer Travis Barker, and by 2004 had {{been regarded as}} the most successful pop punk act of the time since the releases of Enema of the State (1999) and Take Off Your Pants <b>and</b> <b>Jacket</b> (2001). During its brief hiatus in 2002, DeLonge suffered a herniated disc in his back and collected several darker musical ideas he viewed unsuitable for the band; the ideas were used in supergroup Box Car Racer's self-titled album, recorded with assistance from Hazen Street guitarist and longtime friend David Kennedy. Box Car Racer {{was intended as a}} one-time experimental project but evolved into a full-fledged band involving Barker. The side project would cause personal conflicts between DeLonge and Hoppus, the latter was {{not a member of the}} supergroup and felt betrayed. The moody subject matter on Box Car Racer was incorporated into the sound of Blink-182, who explored experimentalist elements on their eponymous fifth studio album (2003). After the success of Box Car Racer, DeLonge declined a solo recording deal offered by Geffen Records because he believed it would cast negative light on Blink-182, but it loomed over the band in addition to growing internal tension.|$|E

5|$|By 2004, Blink-182, {{consisting}} of guitarist Tom DeLonge, bassist Mark Hoppus and drummer Travis Barker, had {{emerged as the}} biggest pop punk act of the era, releasing the seven-times-multiplatinum Enema of the State (1999) and number one album Take Off Your Pants <b>and</b> <b>Jacket</b> (2001). The band took a brief break in 2002 when DeLonge suffered a herniated disc in his back, during which time he collected several darker musical ideas he felt unsuitable for Blink-182, compiling them into a record, Box Car Racer. The album, recorded {{with the help of}} Hazen Street guitarist and longtime friend David Kennedy, was intended as a one-time experimental project but evolved into a full-fledged band with Barker behind the kit. The side project would cause great division between DeLonge and Hoppus, who was not included and felt betrayed. The moody subject matter and music on Box Car Racer edged its way into the Blink sound as well, and the band explored experimentalist elements on their next effort, an eponymous fifth studio album (2003). Geffen Records, after the success of Box Car Racer, offered DeLonge a solo recording deal, which he declined, feeling that it would cast a negative shadow over the band. Nevertheless, the possible deal loomed over the band, contributing to internal tension.|$|E
5|$|Emily, {{disguised}} as her twin sister Katie, arrives at college to take Katie's history exam. In reality, Katie is at home, with nine stitches {{to the head}} after being hit with a rock by their friend Effy Stonem, who has disappeared. Katie is embarrassed about how her injuries look, and miserable {{over the loss of}} her boyfriend Freddie Mclair (Luke Pasqualino), who only dated her to spite Effy, his real love interest. She begins to take notice of all the hints in front of her, and realises that she can no longer hide from herself the fact that Emily is homosexual. At college, Naomi uncovers Emily's disguise (which had not fooled JJ or Freddie either) and tells her that she plans to spend the summer alone in Cyprus. When Emily tells Naomi that she will miss her, they kiss in an empty corridor and later find themselves at Naomi's house where they have sex. Afterward, Emily asks Naomi to the college ball, but Naomi, still crippled by insecurity over her sexuality, refuses, leaving Emily heartbroken. Emily leaves and at the bus stop meets Thomas Tomone (Merveille Lukeba), who offers her his shoes <b>and</b> <b>jacket</b> and is unconcerned when she tells him that she is gay. He tries to comfort her but admits that he believes it impossible to stop loving somebody, referring to his ex-girlfriend Pandora Moon (Lisa Backwell). Emily returns home and comes out to her family, telling them that she has been having sex with a girl named Naomi. Her father, Rob (John Bishop), dismisses it as a joke and her mother, Jenna (Ronni Ancona), is speechless, while Katie tries to deny it. She and Emily have a heated argument, leaving Katie crying.|$|E
