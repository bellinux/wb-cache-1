5|$|The <b>armor</b> {{scheme of}} the Gangut-class ships had some {{significant}} weaknesses. The rear transverse bulkhead was unprotected {{by any other}} <b>armor</b> but was the same thickness as the forward bulkhead which was defended by the upper belt <b>armor.</b> The thinness of the barbette <b>armor</b> was a serious defect which could have proved fatal in a battle. And {{the lack of a}} splinter bulkhead behind the <b>armor</b> of the turrets, barbettes and conning towers left all of those locations vulnerable to main gun hits. But the biggest weakness was the lack of an anti-torpedo bulkhead, which made them highly vulnerable to mines or torpedoes.|$|E

Zero-damage criterion is valid for double-layer <b>armors</b> of massive CAUs, but single-layer <b>armors</b> require a lower-than-zero damage criterion. A simple methodology is proposed to calculate design KD for Cubipod <b>armors</b> and to obtain reasonable explicit global safety factors to IDe and IDa {{when compared to}} benchmark CAUs.

5|$|The {{equivalent}} {{strengths of}} the different <b>armor</b> plates was as follows: 15in (381mm) of wrought iron was equivalent to 12in (305mm) of either plain steel or compound iron and steel <b>armor,</b> and to 7.75in (197mm) of Harvey <b>armor</b> or 5.75in (146mm) of Krupp <b>armor.</b>|$|E
5|$|The main <b>armor</b> belt was Krupp {{cemented}} and nineinches (230mm) thick, but {{narrowed to}} six and three inches (150 and 76mm) closer to {{each end of}} the ships. The barbettes were protected by nine-inch <b>armor,</b> while the turret had a twelve-inch (300mm) front, eight-inch (200mm) sides, and a two- to three-inch (51to76mm) top, and the conning tower had twelve-inch <b>armor.</b> The deck <b>armor</b> had multiple decks of one-and-a-half to twoinches (38to51mm), oneinch (25mm), and oneinch.|$|E
5|$|The {{ships were}} {{equipped}} with Krupp cemented <b>armor.</b> The level of <b>armor</b> {{protection for the}} Moltke class was increased from the Von der Tann design, to 10cm (3.9in) in the forward main belt, 27cm (10.6in) in the citadel, and 10cm (3.9in) aft. The casemates were protected by 15cm (5.9in) vertically and 3.5cm (1.4in) on the roofs. The forward conning tower was protected by 35cm (14in), and the aft tower had 20cm (7.9in) of <b>armor.</b> The turrets had 23cm (9.1in) on the face, 18cm (7.1in) on the sides, and 9cm (3.5in) on the roofs. The deck <b>armor</b> and sloping <b>armor</b> were both 5cm (2.0in), as was the torpedo bulkhead around the barbettes. The torpedo bulkhead was 3cm (1.2in) in other, less critical areas. As with Von der Tann, the <b>armor</b> was Krupp cemented and nickel steel.|$|E

50|$|The series {{received}} negative reviews by {{the critics}} and fans. It holds a 5.2/10 rating at the Internet Movie Database. It was heavily criticized for its complimentary toy line. Each {{member of the}} Avengers wore special battle <b>armors</b> that weren't used in the show. This was due because producers of the show wanted to do different battle <b>armors</b> rather than using the Avengers' regular battle <b>armors.</b> However, TV.com was more positive, with a 7.3/10 rating.|$|R

5|$|The {{ships were}} {{protected}} with Krupp <b>armor.</b> The deck <b>armor</b> was 40mm (1.57in) thick on the horizontal, and ranged between 140–75–140mm (5.51–2.95–5.51in) in the sloped deck <b>armor.</b> The main armored belt was 250mm (9.8in) thick. The forward conning tower had a 50mm (1.97in) thick roof, while the sides were 300mm (11.8in) thick. The aft conning tower had a roof protected by 30mm (1.2in) of <b>armor</b> plating and 140mm (5.51in) <b>armor</b> on the sides. The ship's citadel was also protected by 140mm of <b>armor.</b> The main battery turrets had 50mm thick roofs and 250mm sides. The secondary battery turrets were protected by 150mm (5.9in) of <b>armor,</b> while the casemated guns had gun shields 70mm (2.75in) thick.|$|E
5|$|Weissenburg and Kurfürst Friedrich Wilhelm were armored with {{nickel steel}} Krupp <b>armor,</b> {{but due to}} {{delivery}} problems, Brandenburg and Wörth were armored with a composite <b>armor.</b> The composite <b>armor</b> was constructed by layering steel-clad wrought iron plates and wood planks, which was backed by two more layers of sheet iron. Krupp's nickel steel <b>armor</b> {{was based on the}} Harvey process, which enriched the upper layers of the steel with carbon. This type of <b>armor</b> produced greater strength with thinner <b>armor</b> belts, which enabled ships equipped with it to carry more complete protection. Some portions of Brandenburg did receive the new Krupp <b>armor,</b> including the barbettes that held the fore and center main battery turrets. All four ships retained teak backing to their <b>armor</b> belts.|$|E
5|$|A {{representative}} {{piece of}} Mycenaean <b>armor</b> is the Dendra panoply (c. 1450–1400 BC) {{which consisted of}} a cuirass of a complete set made up of several elements of bronze. It was flexible and comfortable enough {{to be used for}} fighting on foot, while the total weight of the <b>armor</b> is around 18kg (about 40lb). Important evidence of Mycenaean <b>armor</b> has also been found in Thebes (c. 1350–1250 BC), which include a pair of shoulder guards, smaller than to those from Dendra, with additional plates protecting the upper arms, attached to the lower edge of the shoulder guards.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, two {{software-based}} architectures {{for providing}} fail-silent processes, Voltan and Chameleon <b>ARMORs,</b> are analyzed using fault injection. The {{goal is to}} compare the fail-silence coverage provided by the internal error detection techniques in Chameleon <b>ARMORs</b> with an ideal case of full duplication provided by Voltan. Rather than providing fault tolerance through redundant customized hardware, Voltan and Chameleon take the alternate approach of providing fail-silence in software using "off-the-shelf " hardware components. Voltan uses duplicated processes to provide the abstraction of a fail-silent node running on a conventional processor.
