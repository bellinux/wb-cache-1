5|$|In 2008, Bahrain {{was named}} the world's fastest growing {{financial}} center by the City of London's Global Financial Centres Index. Bahrain's banking and financial services sector, particularly Islamic banking, {{have benefited from the}} regional boom driven by demand for oil.

25|$|The product {{aluminium}} oxide {{tends to be}} multi-phase, i.e., consisting of several phases of {{aluminium oxide}} rather than solely corundum. The production process can therefore be optimized to produce a tailored product. The type of phases present affects, for example, the solubility and pore structure of the aluminium oxide product which, in turn, affects the cost of <b>aluminium</b> <b>production</b> and pollution control.|$|E

The primary sector continues to dominate New Zealand's exports, despite accounting for 6.5% of GDP in 2013.|$|E
25|$|Sodium {{hydroxide}} is {{a popular}} strong base used in industry. Around 56% of sodium hydroxide produced is used by industry, 25% of which {{is used in the}} paper industry. Sodium hydroxide is also used in the manufacture of sodium salts and detergents, pH regulation, and organic synthesis. It is used in the Bayer process of <b>aluminium</b> <b>production.</b> In bulk, it is most often handled as an aqueous solution, since solutions are cheaper and easier to handle.|$|E
25|$|The {{technology}} {{requires a}} hot and arid climate. Such locations include {{the coast of}} West Africa, Western Australia, northern Chile, Namibia, the Red Sea, Persian Gulf, and the Gulf of California. Most of these regions are remote and thinly populated, and would require power to be transported over long distances to where it is needed. Alternatively, such plants could provide captive power for nearby industrial uses such as desalination plants, <b>aluminium</b> <b>production</b> via the Hall-Héroult process, or to generate hydrogen for ammonia production.|$|E

500|$|Fluorine is {{the thirteenth}} most common element in Earth's crust at 600–700ppm (parts per million) by mass. Elemental {{fluorine}} in Earth's atmosphere would easily react with atmospheric water vapor, precluding its natural occurrence; {{it is found}} only in combined mineral forms, of which fluorite, fluorapatite and cryolite are the most industrially significant. Fluorite or fluorspar (...) , colorful and abundant worldwide, is fluorine's main source; China and Mexico are the major suppliers. The U.S. led extraction in the early 20th century but ceased mining in 1995. Although fluorapatite (Ca5(PO4)3F) contains most of the world's fluorine, its low mass fraction of 3.5% means that {{most of it is}} used as a phosphate. In the U.S. small quantities of fluorine compounds are obtained via fluorosilicic acid, a phosphate industry byproduct. Cryolite (...) , once used directly in <b>aluminium</b> <b>production,</b> is the rarest and most concentrated of these three minerals. The main commercial mine on Greenland's west coast closed in 1987, and most cryolite is now synthesized.|$|E

2500|$|In Tajikistan {{the energy}} sector is used to support two key export {{industries}} – cotton and <b>aluminium</b> <b>production.</b> [...] The ministry of water and irrigation {{is one of the}} largest debtors to Barki Tajik, the national electricity company. [...] The Tajik Aluminium Company (TALCO) consumes between 40 to 50 per cent of all electricity and pays the lowest tariff in the country. The government argues that both sectors are crucial sources of revenue. After gaining independence in 1991 Kazakhstan moved to address strategic vulnerabilities of the energy system. At the time the northern part of the country was linked with the Russian grid, while southern regions draw their supply from the unified regional system. By building two north-south transmission lines (one in 1997 and the other in 2009) the country connected its southern territories to major sources of energy in the north and decreased dependence on its neighbours.|$|E

50|$|While {{a simple}} {{manufactured}} sheet of GLARE {{is more expensive}} than an equivalent sheet of <b>aluminium,</b> considerable <b>production</b> savings can be made using the aforementioned optimization. A structure properly designed for GLARE is significantly lighter and less complex than an equivalent metal structure, requires less inspection and maintenance, and has a longer lifetime-till failure, often making it cheaper, lighter, and safer in the long run.|$|R

30|$|To {{further reduce}} the {{environmental}} impact of MHM, the main areas of improvement can be identified in the log processing, fibreboards manufacturing, and aluminium nails manufacturing for GWP and POCP. The energy production for the final assembling of the wall also caused a remarkable share of emissions.

Interventions on the <b>aluminium</b> nails <b>production</b> would also be critical in the reduction of the impact on HTP.|$|R
