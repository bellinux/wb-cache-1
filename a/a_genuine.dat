5|$|Cotillo's early law {{practice}} included {{a lot of}} uncompensated charity for the neighborhood.

5|$|Near {{the end of}} his life, Justinian became {{ever more}} {{inclined}} towards the Monophysite doctrine, especially in the form of Aphthartodocetism, but he died before being able to issue any legislation.

In the course of his reign, Justinian, who had <b>a</b> <b>genuine</b> interest in matters of theology, authored a small number of theological treatises.|$|E

5|$|The Beatles: Rock Band {{was well}} {{received}} by the press, both as <b>a</b> <b>genuine</b> means of experiencing the music {{and history of the}} Beatles and as a standalone music video game. Although the game's sales were considered respectable, with {{more than half a million}} units sold during its first month of release in the United States, analysts had projected larger sales volumes and attributed the lower sales to waning interest in the rhythm game genre and the video game industry recovery from the late-2000s recession.|$|E
40|$|We show {{a general}} {{approach}} for detecting genuine multipartite entanglement (GME) and partial inseparability in many-body-systems {{by means of}} macroscopic observables (such as the energy) only. We show that the obtained criteria, the "GME gap" and "the k-entanglement gap", detect large areas of genuine multipartite entanglement and partial entanglement in typical many body states, which are not detected by other criteria. <b>As</b> <b>genuine</b> multipartite entanglement is a necessary property for several quantum information theoretic applications such as e. g. secret sharing or certain kinds of quantum computation, our methods {{can be used to}} select or design appropriate condensed matter systems.
