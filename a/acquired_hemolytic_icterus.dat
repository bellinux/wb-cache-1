40|$|HEMOLYTIC icterus, in its literal sense, {{is a term}} so {{broad and}} {{inclusive}} that it may embrace {{a wide variety of}} conditions in which there is hemolysis of the erythrocytes and anemia. By common usage the term is applied to a more specific entity characterized not only by increased hemolysis and anemia, but by splenomegaly, increased fragility of the erythrocytes and evidences of bone marrow stimulation. This disease has been subdivided into the familial or congenital (Chauffard-Minkowski) type and the acquired (Hayem-Widal) type. The former represents a definite, clear-cut, clinical entity, whereas there is a diversity of opinion {{as to whether or not}} the acquired form should be so recognized. There are many who feel the term " <b>acquired</b> <b>hemolytic</b> <b>icterus</b> " should be eliminated, believing that all such cases are in reality manifestations of the familial or congenital form, and that there is a latent, inherent tendency of the erythrocytes in these individuals to hemolize, requiring only some infectious, toxic, or metabolic disturbance to bring this to light. 1 ' 2 A diagnosis of <b>acquired</b> <b>hemolytic</b> <b>icterus</b> has been made i...|$|E

About 20 years later, Hayem distinguished between congenital hemolytic anemia and an acquired type of infectious icterus associated with chronic splenomegaly.

In 1930, Lederer and Brill described cases of acute hemolysis with rapid onset of anemia and rapid recovery after transfusion therapy.

The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate the predictive values of hemolytic anemias registered in the Danish National Patient Register. Patients and methods: All patients with a first-ever diagnosis of hemolytic anemia from either specialist outpatient clinic contact or inpatient admission at Odense University Hospital from January 1994 through December 2011 were considered for inclusion. Patients with mechanical reason for hemolysis such as an artificial heart valve, and patients with vitamin-B 12 or folic acid deficiency were excluded. Results: We identified 412 eligible patients: 249 with a congenital hemolytic anemia diagnosis and 163 with <b>acquired</b> <b>hemolytic</b> anemia diagnosis. In all, hemolysis was confirmed in 359 patients, yielding an overall PPV of 87. 1 % (95 % confidence interval [CI]: 83. 5 %– 90. 2 %). A diagnosis could be established in 392 patients of whom 355 patients had a hemolytic diagnosis. Diagnosis was confirmed in 197 of the 249 patients with congenital hemolytic anemia, yielding a PPV of 79. 1 % (95 % CI: 73. 5 %– 84. 0 %). Diagnosis of <b>acquired</b> <b>hemolytic</b> anemia could be confirmed in 136 of the 163 patients, resulting in a PPV of 83. 4 % (95 % CI: 76. 8 %– 88. 8 %).

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} whether the abnormal serum factors of <b>acquired</b> <b>hemolytic</b> anemia in patients with leukemia and lymphoma could be characterized as antibody by the immune adherence technique. The patho-genesis of this disorder has not been completely explained and it was felt that the study of specific immunologic reactions might help to determine whether these serum factors are erythrocyte anti-body. The technique of immune adherence (1, 2) was used not only because its flexibility and sensi-tivity make it most suitable for the study of anti-gen-antibody reactions but particularly because, insofar as is at present known, immune adherence will not occur unless antigen and specific comple-ment-fixing antibody are present. The basic premise of this reaction states that in the presence of antigen, specific antibody, complement, and indicator (either primate red cells or nonprimate platelets), the antigen will adhere to the indicator particles. Immune adherence may be determined either macroscopically by red cell floccule forma-tion or microscopically by dark-field illumination. METHODS AND MATERIALS A.

The agglutinating activity was found associated with proteins of variable mobility in the different cases. The majority represented "fast" γ-globulins. The 4 sera with the highest titers of cold agglutinins showed distinguishable abnormal electrophoretic components. The titers correlated with {{the height of the}} abnormal components. Ultracentrifugal analysis of the electrophoretic fractions indicated that the cold agglutinins were associated with proteins having a sedimentation coefficient of approximately 19 S. The abnormal component from the serum with the highest biological activity showed almost no contamination with lower molecular weight proteins. The amount of 19 S material found correlated with the titer of agglutinating activity. The high molecular weight character of the cold agglutinins was confirmed by procedures of density gradient zone centrifugation. The biological activity sedimented with proteins of the 19 S class in all the sera including those of relatively low titer with which no abnormal electrophoretic components were observed. Dissociation of the abnormal high molecular weight components was possible by means of certain sulfhydryl compounds. This resulted in disappearance of cold agglutinin activity. Some of the cases could be classified as macroglobulinemias because of the very large content of high molecular weight components.

The direct Coombs test has become a diagnostic and investigative tool in hemolytic disease of the newborn (4 - 6), following incompatible blood transfusions (7) and in the <b>acquired</b> <b>hemolytic</b> anemias, idiopathic or secondary types (8 - 22).

40|$|Human {{liver tissue}} has been assayed to {{determine}} the amount of hemoglobin production factors in normal and abnormal states. Standardized dogs made anemic by blood removal have been used in this biological assay. Normal animal liver as control is rated as 100 per cent. Normal human liver tissue as compared with the normal animal control contains more of these hemoglobin production factors—a biological assay ratio of 120 to 160 per cent. Infections, acute and chronic, do not appear to modify these values, the concentration of hemoglobin-producing factors falling within the normal range. Pernicious anemia and aplastic anemia both show large liver stores of hemoglobin-producing factors—a biological assay ratio of 200 to 240 per cent. Therapy in pernicious anemia reduces these liver stores as new red cells are formed. Secondary anemia presents a low normal or subnormal liver store of hemoglobin-producing factors—an assay of 60 to 130 per cent. Hemochromatosis, erythroblastic anemia, and <b>hemolytic</b> <b>icterus</b> in spite of large iron deposits in the liver usually show a biological assay which is normal or close to normal. Polycythemia shows low reserve stores of hemoglobin-producing factors. Leukemias present a wide range of values discussed above. Hypoproteinemia almost always is associated with low reserve stores of hemoglobin-producing factors in the liver—biological assays of 60 to 80 per cent. Hypoproteinemia means a depletion of body protein reserve stores including the labile protein liver reserves—a strong indication that the prehemoglobin material (or globin) is related to these liver stores. Pregnancy, eclampsia, and lactation all may present subnormal liver stores of hemoglobin-producing factors.

40|$|Paroxysmal nocturnal {{hemoglobinuria}} (PNH) is an <b>acquired</b> <b>hemolytic</b> anemia {{caused by}} the expansion of a hematopoietic progenitor cell that has acquired a mutation in the X-linked PIGA gene.

PIGA is essential for the synthesis of glycosyl phosphatidyl-inositol (GPI) anchor molecules. PNH blood cells are therefore deficient in all proteins that use such an anchor molecule for attachment to the cell membrane. Two of these proteins regulate complement activation on the cell surface. Their deficiency therefore explains the exquisite sensitivity of PNH red blood cells to complement-mediated lysis.

The erythrocyte membrane of 52 healthy subjects contained 2. 50 - 2. 85 x 10 ^- 16 moles of reactive SH groups (mean 2. 50 +/- 0. 20) per erythrocyte, when determined by this method. A 27 - 36 % reduction of erythrocyte membrane SH content was observed in various conditions characterized by accelerated red cell destruction, including glucose- 6 -phosphate dehydrogenase (G 6 PD) deficiency, drug-induced, autoimmune and other <b>acquired</b> <b>hemolytic</b> anemias and congenital spherocytosis. Normal membrane sulfhydryl content was found in iron deficiency anemia, pernicious anemia in relapse, and in other miscellaneous hematological conditions. Inhibition of membrane SH groups with PMB caused marked potassium leakage from the otherwise intact cells. The possible role of membrane sulfhydryl groups in the development of certain types of hemolytic anemias, and in the maintenance of active transmembrane cation transport in the erythrocyte is discussed...|$|R
