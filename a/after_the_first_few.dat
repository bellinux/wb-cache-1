5|$|As {{promotion}} for the show, Showtime {{posted a}} preview of the pilot on their website. In September 2006, CBS and YouTube struck a strategic content and advertising partnership, and the YouTube CBS Brand Channel started including daily contributions from the Showtime network, including promotional video clips from its critically acclaimed original series, such as Dexter. On October 28, <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>few</b> episodes had aired, Showtime made it easier for viewers {{to catch up with the}} show by dedicating a whole night to showing the first five episodes.|$|E
5|$|Critical {{reception}} for Outlaw Star has been mostly positive. Many reviewers praised the anime series, particularly its animation style and its balance of dramatic and comedic elements. However, some found fault with the show's pacing, {{believing that the}} storyline quality begins to wane <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>few</b> episodes. Sunrise produced a spin-off television series titled , which aired in Japan in 1999. Preliminary plans were made to create a direct sequel {{in the form of}} a single-episode (OVA) called Sword of Wind, but production never began.|$|E

5|$|In February 1937, Agnew entered Johns Hopkins University as a {{chemistry}} major. <b>After</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>few</b> months {{he found the}} pressure of the academic work increasingly stressful, and was distracted by the family's continuing financial problems and worries about the international situation, in which war seemed likely. In 1939 he decided that his future lay in law rather than chemistry, left Johns Hopkins and began night classes at the University of Baltimore School of Law. To support himself, he took a day job as an insurance clerk with the Maryland Casualty Company.|$|E
5|$|There are {{significantly}} fewer bughouse openings {{than there are}} chess openings. Many chess openings create weaknesses which can be easily exploited in bughouse. It is for instance not recommended to move pawns other than the d- and e-pawns. Bughouse openings are generally geared towards dominating vital squares and fast development. Captured pieces become available <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>few</b> moves {{and it is important}} to develop at this stage as there is often not enough time to do so later. Development also helps to defend against early piece drop attacks.|$|E
5|$|Finding American {{distributors}} {{proved more}} troublesome. Memento was screened for various studio heads (including Miramax chief Harvey Weinstein) in March 2000. Although {{most of the}} executives loved the film and praised Nolan's talent, all passed on distributing the picture, believing it was too confusing and would not attract a large audience. After famed independent film director Steven Soderbergh saw the film and learned it was not being distributed, he championed the film in interviews and public events, giving it even more publicity, {{although he did not}} secure a distributor. Newmarket, in a financially risky move, decided to distribute the film itself. <b>After</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>few</b> weeks of distribution, Memento had reached more than 500 theaters and earned a domestic total of $25million in its box-office run. The film's success was surprising to those who passed on the film, so much so that Weinstein realized his mistake and tried to buy the film from Newmarket.|$|E
25|$|Nifedipine rapidly lowers blood pressure, and {{patients}} are commonly warned {{they may feel}} dizzy or faint <b>after</b> taking <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>few</b> doses.

25|$|In 1917 the Hoosiers {{began playing}} their {{games at the}} Men's Gymnasium. <b>After</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>few</b> games there spectators complained that they couldn't see the game because of opaque wooden backboards. Therefore, new backboards were {{installed}} that contained one-and-a-half inch thick plate glass so that fans could see games without an obstructed view. As a result, {{it was the first}} facility – and the Hoosiers were the first team – in the country to use glass backboards.|$|E

25|$|It is {{said that}} William III showed his {{appreciation}} of Shaftesbury's services on this latter occasion by offering him a secretaryship of state, which, however, his worsening health compelled him to decline. Had the King's life continued, Shaftesbury's influence at court {{would probably have been}} considerable. <b>After</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>few</b> weeks of Anne's reign, Shaftesbury, who had been deprived of the vice-admiralty of Dorset, returned to his retired life, but his letters to Furly show that he retained a keen interest in politics.|$|E
25|$|Daniel 1 {{serves as}} an {{introduction}} to the book, showing how God continues to move throughout history when men seem to have failed (i.e., how God stands for his people when they are in a foreign land and subject to an alien power). An interesting feature of the book is that the accounts of chapters 2-6 and the visions in chapter 7 are in Aramaic (<b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>few</b> lines of chapter 2 in Hebrew). However, the visions of chapters 8-12 are in Hebrew, as is the introduction, chapter 1.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} 1950s, Block joined {{the panel of}} the new {{television}} show What’s My Line? <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>few</b> shows were criticized as dull and the show {{was in danger of}} cancellation adding a comedic element to the format. The show survived and by the time of Block’s departure was rated {{as one of the top}} shows on U.S. television. Block had set the precedent of having a comedian on the panel as he was subsequently followed by Steve Allen and then Fred Allen.|$|E
50|$|The {{series was}} Mathews and Linehan's {{immediate}} follow {{up to the}} hugely popular and highly successful Father Ted.

His Braunschweig teammates nicknamed him [...] "Angie" [...] after German chancellor Angela Merkel.|$|R
25|$|At this point, {{nobody knew}} how long Hearne could keep going. However, 1899 saw unmistakable signs of decline, for apart from {{early in the}} season on very helpful pitches, Hearne lost most of his sting. Despite a hat-trick in the first ever Test at Headingley that {{suggested}} he was still a great bowler, Hearne's haul of wickets declined from 222 to 127 and his average rose by fifty percent – a great decline even when the very dry weather <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>few</b> games is considered.|$|E
25|$|Even {{congenital}} GH deficiency {{does not}} usually impair length growth until <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>few</b> months of life. From {{late in the}} first year until mid teens, poor growth and/or shortness is the hallmark of childhood GH deficiency. Growth is not as severely affected in GH deficiency as in untreated hypothyroidism, but growth at about half the usual velocity for age is typical. It tends to be accompanied by delayed physical maturation so that bone maturation and puberty may be several years delayed. When severe GH deficiency is present from birth and never treated, adult heights can be as short as 48-65inches (122–165cm).|$|E
25|$|On July 2, 2009, the USA team played Great Britain. As {{with the}} {{previous}} game against France, this game was not in much doubt <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>few</b> minutes; USA prevailed 93–59. The USA team's offense was led by three double-digit scorers – Jantel Lavender (17), Danielle McCray (15) and Ta'Shia Phillips (11) – but USA coach Charli Turner Thorne credited the win to defense. The third game was against the hosts, Serbia. The USA led {{at the end of}} the first quarter 20–14, the smallest lead at that point of the first three games. The USA team increased its lead, and ended with an 84–50 win.|$|E

25|$|English text, {{treated as}} a string of characters, has fairly low entropy, i.e., is fairly predictable.

25|$|The Men's Gymnasium {{served as}} the home of the {{basketball}} team from 1917–1928. <b>After</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>few</b> games spectators complained that they couldn't see the game because of opaque wooden backboards. As a result, the Nurre Mirror Plate Company in Bloomington was employed to create new backboards that contained one-and-a-half inch thick plate glass so that fans could see games without an obstructed view. As a result, it was the first facility in the country to use glass backboards. Due to growing popularity of the sport at the school the team eventually had to move to a larger arena. The facility is now used by the School of Public Health-Bloomington (formerly the School of Health, Physical Education, and Recreation, HPER).|$|E
25|$|A {{syndicated}} {{version with}} almost identical rules ran weekly in 1975–76. Each episode featured {{the same two}} contestants competing for the entire show. <b>After</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>few</b> episodes the rules were changed so that rather than requiring contestants to win a two-out-of-three match, the winner of each game played the Big Numbers, and the losing contestant returned for another game. The contestants played as many games as possible until time was called. If this happened during a game, {{the one who had}} removed more digits won the final game and any prizes accumulated. Under the two-out-of-three game format used in the first few episodes, the contestant also had another chance at the Big Numbers. Like other weekly nighttime game shows at that time, this version had no returning champions.|$|E
