Strategic Plans may also be helpful to the livestock industry as a means of evaluating progress on those issues.

40|$|Since their {{introduction}} into New Zealand, the Australian bush tail possum, Trichosurus vulpecula, {{has become}} a major <b>animal</b> <b>pest.</b> Possums are believed to number over 70 million, and are known to spread bovine tuberculosis, eat pasture and crops, kill young trees in forest plantations, cause severe damage to indigenous forests in conservation areas, and prey directly on insects and young birds. They have no natural predators (apart from humans) in New Zealand and range from the highlands to the coastal areas. Millions of dollars are spent each year by a number of government agencies in an attempt to curb the possum population. This paper explores a number of spatial data issues involved in possum control in an attempt to show how a GIS can assist with possum management on a conservation block. Examples are given using data obtained from a number of control operations on Mount Karioi and using the GIS packages ArcView and ARC/INFO. From the planning stage, through the operation and monitoring stages, GIS has an important role to play in pest management. The broader issues on spatial analysis explored here include remote sensing and image analysis, GPS, buffering, overlay and 3 D analysis...|$|E

40|$|Description of the subject. To {{counteract}} {{environmental problems}} due to agricultural intensification, European farmers can apply agri-environmental schemes in their fields. Flower strips are {{one example of}} these schemes, {{with the aim of}} supporting biodiversity, leading to an increase in "useful" species groups such as pollinators for crop pollination and natural enemies for pest control. However, to our knowledge, a complete appraisal of {{the pros and cons of}} flower strips, from a farmer's point of view, does not yet exist. It is proposed that better and more complete information could increase the adoption and implementation of such agri-environmental schemes. Objectives. This study aims 1) to assess the pros and cons of flower strips, from a farmer's point of view, and 2) to highlight the knowledge gaps that exist in the scientific literature, for the different types of pros and cons. Method. We listed the different components of the appraisal of pros and cons and conducted a systematic screening of the scientific literature on flower strips and these components. Results. The largest part of the 31 selected studies was concerning agronomical and ecological processes, such as pollination and <b>animal</b> <b>pest</b> control. Most of them indicated positive effects of flower strips. For many components of the appraisal, mostly economic and social ones, few or no studies were found. Conclusions. While a positive balance of pros and cons, from a farmer's point of view, came from our literature screening, large research gaps still remain and more research is required, especially in the economic and social components of the evaluation...|$|E
40|$|Chapter 7 The {{development}} of new methods and approaches for ensuring the sustainability of agriculture and ecosystem services is an important challenge that ecologists, agronomists, and theoreticians must address together. Enhancement of ecosystem services {{needs to be addressed}} at different scales and should include the interaction between farmland biodiversity and stakeholders (farmers, managers, policy makers, etc.) to optimize service delivery. Predictions require an understanding of the interactions between numerous management options and components of biodiversity. Here, we argue that interaction networks on a broad sense (from food webs to landscapes networks in which nodes could be species, trophic groups, fields or farms) can help address this high level of complexity. We examine how tools from mathematics and artificial intelligence, developed for network modelling and reasoning, could be useful for assessing and enhancing ecosystems services. In doing this we highlight the gaps that currently exist between our questions about ecosystem service provision and our ability to answer them with current modelling approaches. We illustrate the use of these tools with three case studies related to ‘pest regulation services’. These include food web approaches to assess <b>animal</b> <b>pest</b> regulation services and decisional models to address management strategies for diseases and weeds. Finally, we describe how different types of network models might operate at different scales of management. The future challenge for agroecologists will be to produce models of interactions and emergent ecosystem services, which are sufficiently quantified and validated. We suggest that network ecology is a nascent research topic that is developing a strong and unified empirical and theoretical foundation, which could serve as the central paradigm for a sustainable, intensive agriculture in the future...|$|E
