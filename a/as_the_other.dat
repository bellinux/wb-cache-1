5|$|A new {{passenger}} {{service to}} Sydney {{was scheduled to}} open {{in the second half of}} 2005, along with Manila and Seoul <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> anticipated destinations. The airline also planned services to the United States in 2005, at first with cargo flights. It was the airline's intention to more than double its freighter fleet to nine Boeing 747s by 2008.|$|E
30|$|We chose r= 1, 000. This {{distance}} {{decreases in}} <b>the</b> same manner <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>others.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Episode 12: Pete was cut {{because he}} couldn't keep up in <b>the</b> ring <b>as</b> well <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>others.</b>|$|R
50|$|Maria Thayer <b>as</b> Abbey Logan. <b>The</b> school librarian, {{who serves}} <b>as</b> <b>the</b> {{voice of reason}} against <b>the</b> <b>other</b> main cast and their schemes but is shown to be just <b>as</b> depraved <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>others</b> when pushed.|$|R
5|$|Although one bomb did detonate, Harry Pearce (Peter Firth) {{views the}} {{operation}} a success, <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> three did not, and no civilians were killed. Ben tells Lucas {{he was right}} about Jawad; he chose to become a bomber over seeing his family. Lucas receives a call from Marlin, who asks to meet with him. During the confrontation, Marlin admits {{he was forced to}} become Mr. Big when terrorists kidnapped his family. Now knowing he has failed, he commits suicide.|$|E
5|$|As of February 2014, SteamOS, Valve's own Linux-based {{operating}} system, supports Portal 2 and its predecessor, as do {{most modern}} Debian-based Linux distributions on its services via the Steam client. Released as a Beta in early 2014 for Linux distributions, it holds {{all of the}} same traits <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> versions, retaining cross-platform play, split screen and fully native controller support.|$|E
5|$|Because Kazakhstan {{was once}} {{a member of the}} USSR, its rail system connects with and carries the same rail gauge as the Russian rail system, as well <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> Central Asian republics of Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan.|$|E
50|$|Morrisburg HC {{joined the}} league for the season, {{but was not}} of <b>the</b> same calibre <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>others</b> and did not win a game.|$|R
2500|$|<b>The</b> <b>other</b> two {{roots of}} the cubic {{equation}} can be determined using the same equality, using <b>the</b> <b>other</b> two choices for the cube root in the equation for : denoting the first choice simply <b>as</b> , <b>the</b> <b>others</b> can be written as ...|$|R
50|$|During {{his earlier}} years in Vienna Benucci also {{performed}} in private concerts {{in collaboration with}} Nancy Storace. The diarist Count Zinzendorf noted that each singer served <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>other's</b> keyboard accompanist.|$|R
5|$|Beginning in the {{converter}} station {{next to the}} Radisson substation, the HVDC line heads south and roughly parallels the six 735kV power lines some distance to the west. It traverses {{the same type of}} terrain <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> six lines; the land is replete with lakes, wetlands, and forested rolling hills. Gradually, the power line turns to the southeast, as it crosses under several 735kV power lines.|$|E
5|$|Cosimo {{went about}} {{arranging}} a marriage for his elder son, Ferdinando, in 1686. He ushered {{him into the}} marriage <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> Tuscan princes, Francesco Maria de' Medici and Gian Gastone de' Medici, were sickly and unlikely to produce children. The main suitors were: Violante of Bavaria, a Bavarian princess, Isabel Luisa of Portugal (the heiress-apparent of Portugal), and the Elector Palatine's daughters.|$|E
5|$|Each {{character}} {{has their own}} unique abilities. Verne has the strength to push and carry large items and can retract into his shell {{in order to avoid}} detection, but cannot jump as high or run as swift <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> characters. RJ has average strength and agility. He can climb, lift items and also throw Verne. Hammy is the most agile of the three, running swifter and jumping higher. This enables him to circumvent security more easily.|$|E
50|$|Here, {{application}} of the Lax-Milgram theorem is definitely a stronger result than is needed, but we still can use it and give this problem <b>the</b> same structure <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>others</b> have.|$|R
50|$|As most {{countries}} {{which have a}} league in a particular sport will operate their regular season at roughly <b>the</b> same time <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>others,</b> international tournaments may be arranged during the off season.|$|R
5000|$|Entry Island is one {{of three}} anglophone {{communities}} on the Magdalen Islands, <b>the</b> <b>other</b> two being [...] and Old Harry. Entry Island is the only totally secluded community, <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>others</b> (anglophone and francophone) are all connected by sand dunes and a highway, Route 199.|$|R
5|$|Gray's Inn, as well <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> Inns of Court, became {{noted for}} {{the parties and}} festivals it hosted. Students {{performed}} masques and plays in court weddings, in front of Queen Elizabeth herself, and hosted regular festivals and banquets at Candlemas, All Hallows Eve and Easter. At Christmas the students ruled the Inn for the day, appointing a Lord of Misrule called the Prince of Purpoole, and organising a masque entirely on their own, with the Benchers and other senior members away for the holiday.|$|E
5|$|In 2006, Langan {{became an}} {{executive}} producer at BBC Films, developing features such <b>as</b> <b>The</b> <b>Other</b> Boleyn Girl (2008) and The Duchess (2008). In April 2009, she was appointed Creative Director of BBC Films, giving her {{control of a}} £12million annual budget and which projects are commissioned for development. By 2010, Langan had led BBC Films to a record 13 nominations at the British Academy Film Awards, which included In the Loop (2009), Fish Tank (2009) and An Education (2009).|$|E
5|$|In general, most field events allow a {{competitor}} {{to take their}} attempt individually, under theoretically the same conditions <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> competitors in the competition. Each attempt is measured to determine who achieved the longest distance.|$|E
50|$|Farmer did the rehearsals in Nice a {{few days}} before the {{beginning}} of her concert tour. The concerts in stadiums were announced <b>as</b> different <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>others,</b> because <b>the</b> stage was bigger and there was additional material.|$|R
2500|$|The renown {{literary}} figure André Gide {{present in}} <b>the</b> audience, fooled <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>others,</b> described <b>the</b> happening: [...] "Some young people, solemn, stilted, {{tied up in}} knots, got up on <b>the</b> platform and <b>as</b> a chorus declaimed insincere inanities".|$|R
50|$|In addition, Australian postal {{authorities}} pressed registration labels {{into service}} as 3d stamps, overprinted in <b>the</b> same way <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>others.</b> Labels of <b>the</b> Friedrich Wilhelmshaven, Herbertshöhe, Kavieng, Kieta, Manus, and Rabaul post offices became overprinted in this manner.|$|R
5|$|In {{the ancient}} Olympic Games, as well <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> Panhellenic Games, there were both four-horse (tethrippon, Greek: τέθριππον) and two-horse (synoris, Greek: συνωρὶς) chariot races, which were {{essentially}} the same aside {{from the number of}} horses.|$|E
5|$|Marie herself {{begins the}} {{operation}} {{on a quest}} to seduce and betray her target. Her reversal (followed by two subsequent changes of heart, {{back to the original}} mission and then in opposition to it) counterbalance the wickedness of Madame du Gua and Corentin. Her ultimate fidelity to the object of her desire demonstrates the possibility of sincere passion, even <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> pair speak to the venom of the slighted heart.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, President Bartlet {{tries to}} persuade Ellie {{to speak to}} the press to contain the incidence, but Ellie insists she is not as {{comfortable}} with the spotlight <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> members of the family. She later watches her mother do a light-hearted appearance on Sesame Street, to defend her right to practice medicine even after voluntarily giving up her licence. This inspires her to follow her father's advice, and give a passionate public statement about the necessity of a politically independent scientific community.|$|E
50|$|Hangar E is a {{base that}} is a twin looking {{building}} <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>others</b> on beside them. Hangar E is the Autobot's new base with soldiers and military protocol which is later discovered by Soundwave and supposedly destroyed by Starscream.|$|R
5|$|At <b>the</b> camp, <b>the</b> <b>other</b> survivors' {{are enjoying}} dinner when {{a horde of}} walkers {{suddenly}} appear, biting several of the members including Amy and Ed Peletier (Adam Minarovich). Rick and <b>the</b> <b>others</b> arrive in time to quell the walkers. Amy dies in Andrea's arms, and <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>others</b> stand around in shock, Jim recalls why he had dug those holes.|$|R
50|$|All {{four were}} tried at Durham and {{condemned}} to death, Palasor {{for being a}} priest, and <b>the</b> <b>others</b> for assisting him. Another gentleman was condemned {{at the same time}} but saved his life by conforming to the Church of England, <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>others</b> might have done. Mrs. Norton, being supposed to be with child, was reprieved. <b>The</b> <b>others</b> were executed together.|$|R
5|$|O'Malley's and {{two other}} groups {{submitted}} proposals to run the restaurant in September 2001. The Park Grill group's proposal was twice as long <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> two but, technically, promised the Park District the lowest revenues. By {{the end of the}} year, O'Malley's team had been selected to run the restaurant, souvenir and concession stands, and a cafe in the new Millennium Park.|$|E
5|$|Over {{the last}} 150 years, this layout has been {{replaced}} by the usual Spanish colonial architecture of large square blocks with internal patios. Remnants of the initial design can still be seen in San Miguel de Velasco, San Rafael de Velasco and Santa Ana de Velasco, places that were not as much exposed to modernization <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> settlements.|$|E
5|$|The Grand Commandant, whose {{title was}} changed to Grand Marshal in 119 BC before {{reverting}} to Grand Commandant in 51 AD, was the irregularly posted commander {{of the military and}} then regent during the Western Han period. In the Eastern Han era he was chiefly a civil official who shared many of the same censorial powers <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> two Councillors of State.|$|E
25|$|The route {{remained}} unchanged from then until 1973, when many other secondary highways within {{the newly created}} Regional Municipality of Sudbury were decommissioned. Though it did not fall within the new region, it was decommissioned at <b>the</b> same time <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>others.</b>|$|R
2500|$|In a 1942 {{review of}} the American Abstract Artists' sixth annual exhibition, {{influential}} art critic Clement Greenberg wrote that among the [...] "geometricians", Swinden [...] "shows as much promise perhaps in his single unsuccessful painting <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>others</b> in their successful ones." ...|$|R
5|$|Carl Esser <b>as</b> Fabian, <b>the</b> <b>other</b> spoiled {{antagonist}} of the series.|$|R
