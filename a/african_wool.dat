At 70 per cent. relative humidity and 70 °F. the mean was 66. 0 per cent., the standard deviation 17. 6 per cent. and the coefficient of variability 26. 6 per cent. No difference in scaliness between different fineness groups within a staple was obtained. Between samples, however, a significant negative correlation of - 0. 3428 between percentage difference in friction and fibre fineness was obtained. The value obtained for a sample was concluded to be characteristic of the sample, and not of any particular group of fibres used for the determination. The regression coefficient of percentage difference in friction on fibre fineness was - 2. 30, a significant value, showing that on the average the percentage difference in friction decreases by 2. 30 per cent. for every micron increase in the fibre fineness of the sample. The values for coefficient of friction for the different quality numbers of South <b>African</b> Merino <b>wool</b> are given. Wool from rams gave a lower value for scaliness concordant with a coarser wool.

40|$|An {{analysis}} of one thousand South <b>African</b> Merino <b>wool</b> samples selected at random and involving {{the measurement of}} {{a quarter of a}} million fibres is described and fundamental characteristics are demonstrated. Fibre thickness ranges from 7. 5 µ to 50 µ. The bulk, or eighty per cent. of the fibres measure from 12. 5 µ to 22. 5 µ. Eighty per cent. of the samples conform to the quality numbers of 60 's to 100 's. Eleven per cent. are 120 's to 150 's and it is suggested that these are " hunger fine " and presumably influenced by adverse conditions of nutrition. Eight per cent. are cross-bred and are coarser than Merino quality numbers. As regards coefficient of variability, South <b>African</b> Merino <b>wool</b> ranges from 10 per cent. to 32 per cent. Seventy-nine per cent. of the samples conform to a variability of sixteen to twenty-four per cent. coefficient of variability. The coefficient of correlation between fibre finess and coefficient of variability is given as - • 0754 ± • 0217 and indicates an insignificant correlation. The coefficient of correlation between fibre fineness and crimping is given as - • 617 ± • 0226, which shows a definite correlation, though not a high one. Twenty-eight per cent. of the samples show a perfect agreement between the quality numbers of fibre fineness and those of crimps. The woolman who judges fibre fineness on crimps may err in seventy-two per cent. of his judgments by one, two or even three quality numbers.

40|$|A {{series of}} South <b>African</b> Merino <b>wool</b> samples, {{representing}} wools from {{different parts of}} the Union, was analysed for breaking strength and tensile strength. The method of determination, using Doehner's instrument, consisted of bundle tests, this giving average values for larger samples and lots. A portion of the analysis is devoted to the breaking strength and tensile strength of fibres within the same staple. It is shown that the average breaking strength of the coarse fibres within the staple is 6. 66 (±. 504) grammes. That of the fine fibres is 4. 38 (±. 300) grammes, so that the course fibres are 52 per cent. stronger per fibre than the fine fibres. The practical significance of this is discussed. Breeding aspects are discussed and it is shown that the Merino breeder, in striving for uniformity of fibre fineness, will tend to attain uniformity in fibre length and also in the breaking strength of the fibres. The average tensile strength of the coarse fibres within the staple is 1. 32 (± 0 · 058) and that of the fine fibres is 1 · 46 (± · 070), (expressed as grammes per square cm. x 10 ⁶). When fibres within the same staple are considered, there is a significant correlation of · 9508 (± · 7938) between fibre diameter and breaking strength and a significant negative correlation of - · 4822 (± · 0456) between fibre diameter and tensile strength. The average breaking strength (per fibre) of representative South <b>African</b> Merino <b>wool</b> samples ranges from 1 to 11 grammes with a mean of 5 · 50 grammes. The tensile strength of South <b>African.</b> Merino <b>wool</b> varies from 0 · 6 to 1 · 6 (x 10 ⁶) grammes per square centimetre with an average of 1 · 243 (x 10 ⁶) grammes per square centimetre of fibre. The latter figure can also be expressed as 8 tons per square inch or 12 · 4 kilogrammes per square millimeter of fibre. When different samples are considered there is a significant correlation (r = 0 · 896 ± 0 · 0186) between fibre fineness and breaking strength, but an insignificant correlation (r= - 0. 1780 ± 0. 0911) between fibre fineness and tensile strength. The regression coefficient of the breaking load on fibre fineness is 0 · 445 (± · 0208) indicating that, on an average, every increase of 1 µ in fibre fineness is associated with an increase of 0 · 445 grammes in the breaking strength.

40|$|The {{adsorption}} {{of moisture}} at various relative humidities by ten samples representing {{different types of}} South <b>African</b> Merino <b>wool</b> was investigated. The samples differed significantly in absorptive powers. At 90 per cent. relative humidity the extreme values of 24. 0 per cent. and 22. 3 per cent. with a mean value of 22. 8 per cent. were obtained. At 97. 5 per cent. relative humidity the corresponding values were 28. 3 per cent. and 27. 4 per cent., showing a smaller difference than at 90 per cent. relative humidity. The highest values were obtained {{in the case of}} an extremely hairy sample, and the lowest in the case of a sample of the "ropy" type.

Fifty naturally infected ewes as well as another 40 from a maedi-visna-free source to be used as control animals, were purchased and kept in separate flocks which were managed in a similar way. All the ewes were of the same breed and 3 - 4 years old. During the adaptation period, and through the mating, pregnancy and lactation periods they were periodically monitored for the presence of MVV serum antibodies. The lambs were weighed at birth and thereafter every 2 weeks until the age of 90 days, when they were weaned. The ewes were then slaughtered, and their udders examined histologically and the number of lymphocytic follicles were counted and assessed. Although the calculated values indicated a correlation between the number of follicles in the udder and the reduction in the growth rate of the lambs, this was not statistically significant. Similarly, despite higher counts of lymphoid follicles in the udders of sero-positive ewes as compared to those that were sero-negative and the lower ewe productivity indexes in infected ewes, no statistically significant differences were found in the indexes of ewes in different follicle categories.

Wool is a natural animal ﬁbre produced in varying quantities around the world. The wool ﬁbre is far from homogenous; its type and quality, such as ﬁneness and length, depending on the breed of sheep and the environmental conditions prevailing during its growth. Wool is used {{in a variety of}} end uses, ranging from ﬁ ne worsted suiting, to hand knitting yarn, carpets, blankets and aircraft upholstery, its use depending largely on its ﬁbre ﬁneness and length. The wool industry {{is one of the oldest}} agricultural industries in South Africa, playing an important economic role as an earner of foreign exchange, and providing a living to many people. Wool is produced in many parts of South Africa under extensive, semi-extensive or intensive conditions, and is largely an export commodity. It is produced and traded in a sophisticated free market business environment into the international market place, where supply and demand forces determine price levels. More than 90 % of locally produced wool is exported in an unprocessed or semi-processed form which detrimentally affects employment, foreign exchange and income-generating opportunities associated with value-addition prior to export. To reduce the amount of wool exported in unprocessed or semi-processed form, wool-processing enterprises need to be established to produce internationally marketable end products. Therefore, South Africa needs to attract investors into the wool sector, who will set up manufacturing mills in an economically sustainable manner. Potential and present investors in the South African (S. A.) wool industry need easily accessible and up-to-date information on the production statistics, processing properties and end-use pplications of the wool they need for the particular end-products they manufacture or could manufacture. To achieve this and ensure accessibility to such continuously updated information, it is essential to develop an integrated computer-based system. It is with the above in mind that a knowledge-based system for the optimum utilisation of South <b>African</b> <b>wool</b> has been developed, which is described here. This paper reviews relevant work in this ﬁ eld and covers wool production statistics in South Africa, the end uses of the wool ﬁbre versus the diameter of the ﬁbre, the advantages of distributed architectures, and the ﬂow of processes in a wool utilization system. It then sets out the concept and development of the proposed system, including the architecture of the proposed expert system, the associated analysis and ﬁnally the conclusions. The components of the expert system, namely the knowledge base, inference engine, knowledge acquisition component, and explanation system are described. The architecture of the system incorporates the concept of distributed systems and the related advantages incorporated in its general architecture and within its internal components. It marries both expert and general knowledge-based systems, consisting of a combination of an ordinary knowledge-based system (KBS) that can be queried for information and an expert system that provides advice to users. The distributed system developed involves collection of autonomous components that are interconnected, which enables these components to coordinate their activities and share resources of the system, so that users perceive the system as a single integrated facility. There are a number of advantages of such a distributed system and these are articulated in the paper. This approach allows not only incremental development of the system, but also facilitates sharing of data and information. The distributed nature of the architecture of the system developed, consists of three main elements: The expert system to advise on the characteristics of the wool that is required for a particular end use A knowledge-based system for querying on the distribution of wool of the various characteristics in South Africa An expert system for the selection of the best alternative area for investment for the particular product end use. The knowledge base consists of a number of databases, each representing the various wool characteristics. This represents a distributed architecture of the knowledge base. Therefore, this architecture inherits all the advantages of distributed processing systems as described in the paper. These knowledge bases can be queried by the user via a database management system (DBMS), a software that manages the creation, updating, maintenance and querying of the database. In terms of wool utilization, the system involves capturing the end-use and requirements of a product and from it, retrieving the characteristics of the wool that will meet the particular end-use. The availability of the wool is then checked by region and province for each style, type, clip type, yield, colour, vegetable matter fault and micron range, in line with the latest statistics available. The system developed enables questions such as the following to be asked at the user interface: What is the anticipated end use of the wool? What criteria must the wool satisfy for the selected end-use? What quantities of wool are required?The outputs at the user interface of the system are the quantities of wool per province and region in terms of micron, style, yield, colour, type, clip type as available on the web-site of Cape Wools SA.

The possibility of genetically improving survival of a Merino lambs was assessed with data from 5769 lambs that were born alive in the Cradock fine wool stud from 1998 to 2003. Three traits can possibly be linked to lamb survival and can therefore be included in selection programs, namely birth coat score, birth weight and 42 -day body weight. The aim of this study is therefore to quantify the genetic relationship among lamb survival, birth coat score, birth weight and 42 -day body weight in a South <b>African</b> fine <b>wool</b> Merino stud.
