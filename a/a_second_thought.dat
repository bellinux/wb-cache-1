25|$|According to René Tinner and Stephan Plank {{in a radio}} {{documentary}} {{about the life of}} Conny Plank, it was Brian Eno's idea that Plank should produce the U2-album The Joshua Tree instead of him. After being introduced to the band by Eno and after a short meeting, Plank turned down the job ("I cannot work with this singer"). According to the companion website of the documentary film Conny Plank – The Potential of Noise (but not the film itself), after the meeting, Plank firstly asked for time for <b>a</b> <b>second</b> <b>thought.</b> In the meantime he attended a U2 concert at Freilichtbühne Loreley, where U2's Bono introduced Plank to the audience as their new producer. Thereupon Plank has left the concert and never again talked to any member of U2.|$|E

Brooks credits Tolkien with introducing this theme of mundane heroism into fantasy literature and influencing his own fiction.

Peter Hawes of The Sunday Star-Times in Auckland, New Zealand, said the episode was funny and intelligent. He {{said of the}} episode, [...] "Once again, the US national psyche is imperishably captured by a crude cartoon." [...] He liked the way adults were portrayed as less sensible than the children, and he particularly enjoyed the [...] "Duck and Cover" [...] videos: [...] "It is terrifyingly funny, for it is a word-for-word recreation of the insane Atom-bomb Safety film, created and distributed in 1952 by the US government, who never for <b>a</b> <b>second</b> <b>thought</b> it would work."

2500|$|Polite pronouns {{are used}} to address elders, {{teachers}} and strangers, {{through the use of}} feudal-era third person pronouns in lieu of first and second person pronouns. In such situations, one refers to oneself in third person: [...] kya. nau [...] for men and [...] kya. ma. [...] for women, both meaning [...] "your servant", and refer to the addressee as [...] min [...] "your highness", [...] khang bya: [...] "master, lord" [...] (...) or [...] hrang [...] "ruler/master".

2500|$|Virginia Woolf's [...] (1928) is {{an early}} example of {{bisexuality}} in literature. The story, {{of a man who}} changes into a woman without <b>a</b> <b>second</b> <b>thought,</b> was based on the life of Woolf's lover Vita Sackville-West. Woolf used the gender switch to avoid the book being banned for homosexual content. The pronouns switch from male to female as Orlando's gender changes. Woolf's lack of definite pronouns allows for ambiguity and lack of emphasis on gender labels. Her 1925 book Mrs Dalloway focused on a bisexual man and a bisexual woman in sexually unfulfilled heterosexual marriages in later life. Following Sackille-West's death, her son Nigel Nicolson published Portrait of a Marriage, one of her diaries recounting her affair with a woman during her marriage to Harold Nicolson. Other early examples include works of D.H. Lawrence, such as Women in Love (1920), and Colette's Claudine (1900–1903) series.|$|E
2500|$|... is {{an average}} {{teenager}} who, {{unable to get}} into the local high schools, enrolls at Yokai Academy. He discovers it is a school for monsters, and must hide his human identity under punishment of death. However, because he befriends Moka Akashiya, an attractive vampire, he decides to stay. Over the course of the series, he makes new friends and protects them without <b>a</b> <b>second</b> <b>thought.</b> Most of his friends are girls who in turn compete for his affection. When infused with Moka's blood, he acquires extraordinary strength that allows him to defeat other monsters. The transfusions, however, take a toll on his human body and transform him into a ghoul, after which he is given a spirit lock to retain his humanity. In Season II, he trains and undergoes body alterations to become stronger and to control his vampiric power. He eventually is able to transform into a powerful vampire like Moka. In the original Japanese series and drama CD, Tsukune is voiced by Daisuke Kishio. In the English dub, he is voiced by Todd Haberkorn.|$|E
2500|$|Although {{the book}} has always been popular and {{considered}} a children's classic by many literary critics, a number of prominent individuals have spoken unfavorably of the novel over the years. Children's novelist and literary historian John Rowe Townsend has described the book as [...] "fantasy of an almost literally nauseating kind" [...] and accused it of [...] "astonishing insensitivity" [...] regarding the original portrayal of the Oompa-Loompas as black pygmies, although Dahl did revise this in later editions. Another novelist, Eleanor Cameron, compared the book to the sweets that form its subject matter, commenting that it is [...] "delectable and soothing while we are undergoing the brief sensory pleasure it affords but leaves us poorly nourished with our taste dulled for better fare."Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (together with Charlotte's Web [...] ) is probably the book most read aloud by those teachers who have no idea, apparently, what other books they might read to the children. Charlie, again along with Charlotte's Web, is always {{at the top of}} the best sellers among children's books, put there by fond aunts and grandmothers and parents buying it as the perfect gift, knowing no better. And I do think this a most curious coupling: on the one hand, one of the most tasteless books ever written for children; and on the other, one of the best. We are reminded of Ford Madox Ford's observation that only two classes of books are universal in their appeal: the very best and the very worst. [...] is like candy (the chief excitement and lure of Charlie) in that it is delectable and soothing while we are undergoing the brief sensory pleasure it affords but leaves us poorly nourished with our taste dulled for better fare. I think it will be admitted of the average TV show that goes on from week to week that there is no time, either from the point of view of production or the time allowed for showing, to work deeply at meaning or characterisation. All interest depends upon the constant, unremitting excitement of the turns of plot. And if character or likelihood of action – that is, inevitability – must be wrenched to fit the necessities of plot, there is no time to be concerned about this either by the director or by the audience. Nor will the tuned-in, turned-on, keyed-up television watcher give the superficial quality of the show so much as <b>a</b> <b>second</b> <b>thought.</b> He has been temporarily amused; what is there to complain about? And like all those nursing at the electronic bosom in McLuhan's global village (as he likes to call it), so everybody in Willy Wonka's chocolate factory is enclosed in its intoxicating confines forever: all the workers, including the little Oompa-Loompas brought over from Africa and, by the end of the book, Charlie and his entire family.}} ...|$|E
