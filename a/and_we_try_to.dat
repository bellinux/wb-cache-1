25|$|Consecration to the Blessed Virgin Mary: Our members consecrate {{themselves}} to the Blessed Virgin Mary every year on the Solemnity of the Immaculate Conception, December 8th. We have a yearly novena to our Lady under this title, {{and this is a}} solemnity proper to our Congregation. The original Constitutions drawn up by Father Rauzan affirmed the belief that one goes surely to Jesus through Mary. Placing ourselves under the patronage of the Blessed Virgin Mary, we profess our Final/Perpetual Vows on August 15th, the Solemnity of the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> schedule all of our Ordinations on a Marian feast day.|$|E
500|$|In 2010, Jacqui {{embarked}} on a [...] "surprise" [...] relationship with Rhys Ashworth (Andrew Moss). Moss first hinted at their romance months prior stating: [...] "I think Rhys is going {{to fall in love}} again. It's a character already in the village. It's quite surprising. It's a character who's been here for a while." [...] The relationship proved popular with viewers; during an interview with Digital Spy, Cooper spoke of her original lack of optimism towards the pairing, stating: [...] "When the relationship first started, we didn't know how they were going to gel and how it was going to work, because people were such fans of Jacqui and Tony. Some people still ask me if those two are going to get back together, but people are really taken with Rhys and Jacqui." [...] Cooper believes it's her own working relationship with Moss that helps make the pairing a success stating: [...] "It's a nice collaboration <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> make it funny, emotional, hard-hitting, three-dimensional and as interesting for the audience as possible." [...] She also adopted a [...] "couple name" [...] for the pair titled [...] "Ja-Rhys".|$|E
2500|$|When {{asked about}} the {{differences}} amongst theaters in Chicago and Under the Gun's ensemble, the theater's artistic director explained: [...] "I think what makes us different is our ensemble. Our idea of the ensemble is {{we are going to}} bring in a large group of people that we like, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> empower them to do the best work they can do. And we give them plenty of chances to fail with the only consequence of failing being that the show closes and they get to try another show...That’s a very different mindset than other theaters. I have to have the mindset of if a person is struggling in the show, is there anyway I can help them perform better? Because I am stuck with them. Unless I can trick them into punching me in the face, I can’t cut them." ...|$|E

60|$|Arthur and Quincey {{came home}} with me, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> cheer {{each other on the}} way. We had left behind the child in safety, and were tired. So we all slept with more or less reality of sleep.|$|R
2500|$|So {{what can}} it mean when America {{says it will}} now protect its friends? It can only mean {{prejudice}} against Iraq. This stance plus maneuvers and statements which have been made has encouraged the UAE and Kuwait to disregard Iraqi rights. ... If you use pressure, we will deploy pressure and force. We {{know that you can}} harm us although we do not threaten you. But we too can harm you. Everyone can cause harm according to their ability and their size. We cannot come all the way to you in the United States, but individual Arabs may reach you. ... We do not place America among the enemies. We place it where we want our friends to be <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> be friends. But repeated American statements last year made it apparent that America did not regard us as friends.|$|E
6000|$|... "It is nothing," [...] Alvarez {{replied in}} a deprecatory tone.

Besides, watching them serves two objects." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Don't {{you want}} to come round to our club to-night?" [...] asked the editor, as he handed Bartley the order for his money across the table. [...] "We have a bad dinner, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> have a good time. We're all {{newspaper}} men together." ...|$|E
5000|$|<b>And</b> <b>we</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> be {{very fair}} and {{reasonable}} {{about this and}} take these matters up on a case-by-case basis.

6000|$|... "We did {{everything}} we could to fight him off from it," [...] interrupted Mrs. Elmore, [...] "both of us. We {{saw that it was}} coming, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> stop it. But nothing would help. Perhaps, as he says, he did have to do it." ...|$|R
60|$|Surely {{this was}} putting it fairly, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> follow the old man's advice, or, at least I did; but without {{arriving}} at any satisfactory conclusion. The only plan I could put together {{was that we}} first get our wares and then blunder ahead <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> sell them, trusting to luck for the rest.|$|R
60|$|Lizzie {{shook her}} head, still smiling. 'They have never {{asked me what}} my {{religion}} is. They asked me what my story was, and I told them. They asked me to be industrious and faithful, and I promised to be so. They most willingly and cheerfully do their duty {{to all of us}} who are employed here, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> do ours to them. Indeed they do much more than their duty to us, for they are wonderfully mindful of us in many ways.|$|E
60|$|The paradox lies in wait here, as in {{most other}} human affairs, to {{confound}} us, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> baffle it, in this way and in that. We talk, for instance, of poetry for poets, and we fondly imagine that this is different from talking of cookery for cooks. Poetry is not made for poets; they have enough poetry of their own, but it is made {{for people who are}} not poets. If it does not please these, it may still be poetry, but it is poetry which has failed of its truest office. It is none the less its truest office because some very wretched verse seems often to do it.|$|E
6000|$|... "There are now no {{cities in}} Altruria, in your meaning, {{but there are}} capitals, {{one for each of}} the regions of our country and one for the whole commonwealth. These capitals are for the {{transaction}} of public affairs, in which every citizen of Altruria is schooled, and they are the residences of the administrative officials, who are alternated every year, from the highest to the lowest. A public employment with us is of no greater honor or profit than any other, for with our absolute economic equality there can be no ambition, and there is no opportunity for one citizen to outshine another. But as the capitals are the centres of all the arts, which we consider the chief of our public affairs, they are oftenest frequented by poets, actors, painters, sculptors, musicians, and architects. We regard all artists, who are in a sort creators, as the human type which is likest the divine, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> conform our whole industrial life to the artistic temperament. Even in the labors of the field and shop, which are obligatory upon all, we study the inspiration of this temperament, and in the voluntary pursuits we allow it full control. Each, in these, follows his fancy as to what he shall do, and when he shall do it, or whether he shall do anything at all. In the capitals are the universities, theatres, galleries, museums, cathedrals, laboratories and conservatories, and the appliances of every art and science, as well as the administration buildings; and beauty as well as use is studied in every edifice. Our capitals are as clean and quiet and healthful as the country, and these advantages are secured simply by the elimination of the horse, an animal which we should be as much surprised to find in the streets of a town as the plesiosaurus or the pterodactyl. All transportation in the capitals, whether for pleasure or business, is by electricity, and swift electrical expresses connect the capital of each region with the villages which radiate from it to the cardinal points. These expresses run at the rate of a hundred and fifty miles an hour, and they enable the artist, the scientist, the literary man, of the remotest hamlet, to visit the capital (when he is not actually resident there in some public use) every day, after the hours of the obligatory industries; or, if he likes, he may remain there a whole week or fortnight, giving six hours a day instead of three to the obligatories, until the time is made up. In case of very evident merit, or for the purpose of allowing him to complete some work requiring continuous application, a vote of the local agents may release him from the obligatories indefinitely. Generally, however, our artists prefer not to ask this, but avail themselves of the stated means we have of allowing them to work at the obligatories, and get the needed exercise and variety of occupation in the immediate vicinity of the capital.|$|E

5000|$|Simons store {{locations}} are each uniquely designed.

60|$|She and Alured {{really enjoyed}} it, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> think <b>we</b> did! <b>And</b> then Fulk used to stride {{off on a}} long solitary walk, or else sit in the porch with his arms across, in a dumb heavy silence, till he saw us looking at him; {{and then he would}} shake himself, and go and find Sisson, and discuss every field and beast with him.|$|R
30|$|A non-controversial use {{of student}} {{experiments}} {{is to use}} them to test experimental design and initial hypotheses, before conducting experiments with professionals, as recommended by (Sjoberg et al. 2002). According to (Carver et al. 2010), it can make sense to use students for initial experiments, to see whether the experiment design works. We agree with these arguments <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> mitigate confounding factors by performing a careful experiment in which <b>we</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> use an appropriate assessment criterion.|$|R
500|$|Ahead of the 2012–13 Premier League season, Barton was {{not given}} a squad number by QPR. Towards {{the end of the}} season, however, {{chairman}} Tony Fernandes identified the loss of Barton as a factor in the club's poor performance and relegation from the Premier League, saying: [...] "We missed Joey.

5000|$|... "Evolution {{has seen}} {{to it that}} {{geometric}} drawings like this elicit in us premonitions of the near future.

5000|$|Some monsters due for an {{appearance}} in the film were cut for budgetary reasons, but Letterman stated that the crew tried to choose the monsters most appropriate to the story. Letterman also stated {{that he tried to}} combine both humor and horror in the film, commenting that [...] "the books themselves are legitimately scary, but they're legitimately funny, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> capture that". In November 2014, the release date was moved back to April 15, 2016. In January 2015, the release date was pushed forward to October 16, 2015.|$|E
5000|$|In radio {{interviews}} {{conducted during the}} height of their success both Hunt and Pasquale stated that one of their primary musical influences was George Michael, and more specifically, the work Michael did during the Wham! years.

We're fascinated by the book 'Godel Escher Bach' by Douglas Hofstadter <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> make music that is recursive. We try to establish certain themes and then shape and reuse them in different ways to create songs that have common threads within them. Patterns repeat, but not in ways you'd expect." ...|$|E
5000|$|When it was {{suggested}} that his techniques resembled brain-washing, Mowrer repeated the response of Charles Dederich (as quoted by Yablonsky) to a similar question: [...] "Yes, that's right, we do engage in a good deal of 'brain-washing.'
