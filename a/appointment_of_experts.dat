40|$|This article situates the {{judgement}} of The Hague District Court in Urgenda Foundation v the Kingdom of the Netherlands {{within the}} life {{of global climate change}} litigation. To do so, the paper concentrates on the legal particulars of Dutch law, elements of ‘diffused’ jurisprudence from other jurisdictions, and the reasoning of the judgement that is ‘diffusible’. Firstly, the Court’s mandate for the State to take more robust and immediate climate mitigation action were informed by particulars of Dutch civil and constitutional law. Such particulars assisted with crossing the hurdles of standing of Dutch citizens in a climate change case, and the imposition of liability on the State for transboundary harm. Second, in relation to the separation of powers, there is clearly a marriage of ‘diffused’ jurisprudence from other jurisdictions and Dutch legal particulars with the primary effect of providing Connecticut v. AEP a second life. Third, aspects of the Court’s reasoning are ‘diffusible’ or amenable to transnational borrowing. Notable in this regard is the Court’s adoption of a procedural version of the precautionary principle, whereby the onus of proving adequacy and effectiveness of climate policy is shifted onto the State. However, caution must be exercised in adopting the Court’s reasoning as to why the international (namely the IPCC) is identified as a preferred benchmark for allocation of climate targets as against the supranational (namely the Effort-Sharing Decision of the EU), and the implicit economic reasoning as to why the State’s policies are ineffective. To overcome this problem, it is suggested that the <b>appointment</b> <b>of</b> <b>experts</b> by judicial bodies may be the way forward...|$|E
40|$|The audit {{assessed}} {{the effectiveness of}} the Australian Securities and Investments Commission’s administration of enforceable undertakings. Audit objective and criteria The objective of the audit was to assess {{the effectiveness of the}} Australian Securities and Investments Commission’s administration of enforceable undertakings. To form a conclusion against this objective, the Australian National Audit Office (ANAO) adopted the following high level criteria: 	management arrangements are in place that support the effective, consistent and transparent administration of EUs; 	offers of an EU are administered consistently, transparently and in accordance with ASIC 2 ̆ 7 s policies and procedures; and 	EUs accepted by ASIC are monitored to ensure compliance with those undertakings, action is undertaken where non‑compliance is identified and the effectiveness of EUs as a regulatory tool is assessed. Overall conclusion As one of ASIC’s suite of regulatory responses, enforceable undertakings (EUs) have a valuable role in ASIC’s overall enforcement approach. EUs are particularly useful in addressing less serious misconduct where the promisor is co-operative. A potential benefit of EUs is in driving changes in a promisor’s compliance culture and systems, whereas an administrative penalty (or even a civil sanction) may not lead to behavioural change. Since their introduction in 1998, ASIC has accepted an average of 24 EUs per year, and from January 2012 to June 2014, 53 of ASIC’s 1711 enforcement actions (three per cent) were EUs. In general, ASIC has effectively administered the EUs it has negotiated and accepted. It has sound processes for each major step of the EU process: accepting EUs as the most appropriate regulatory tool; including terms in the undertaking that appropriately address the misconduct; and monitoring adherence to those terms and addressing any identified non‑compliance. However, there is considerable scope to improve the record keeping processes supporting EU decisions and compliance monitoring, as documentation was inconsistent, dispersed across multiple systems and not always readily available. In addition, ASIC does not measure or report on the effectiveness of EUs in achieving intended regulatory outcomes, including greater levels of voluntary compliance. Improved performance measurement and reporting would better inform key stakeholders, including Parliament, of the effectiveness of ASIC’s regulation. In relation to entering into EUs, ASIC has accepted offers of EUs consistently, transparently and in accordance with its policies and procedures. For most EUs reviewed by the ANAO (83  per cent), there was sufficient documentation to demonstrate that accepting an EU would provide an effective regulatory outcome and no instances were identified where promisors were treated differently based on the size of their business. ASIC also had a sound basis for including particular terms in each EU, with the terms generally aligning with the non‑compliance at which the EU was directed. However, ASIC could ensure that EUs are clearer about the misconduct that was the subject of ASIC’s concerns. ASIC could also strengthen its capacity to assess compliance with, and the effectiveness of, EUs by more consistently including in the terms of an EU the requirement that the promisor report back to ASIC demonstrating their compliance with EU obligations. This information will better inform ASIC’s monitoring of the promisor’s compliance with the EU and, where necessary, its response to non‑compliance. Where the EU required an independent expert to assess the promisor’s compliance with EU obligations, ASIC was generally involved with the review process, and the reports provided by the expert were satisfactory. However, there were inconsistencies in ASIC’s approach to approving the <b>appointment</b> <b>of</b> <b>experts</b> and their terms of reference. In February 2015, ASIC released new public guidance that is expected to help improve processes relating to the appointment of independent experts.

Qualitative Interviews mit Sicherheits-bzw. DV-Beauftragten oder der Geschaeftsfuehrung sowie Expertengespraeche fuehren zu dem Ergebnis, dass die Situation der Informations- und Telekommunikationssicherheit in KMU im Vergleich zu Grossunternehmen stark verbesserungsbeduerftig ist. Vor allem die Implementation von organisatorischen und personellen Sicherheitsmassnahmen scheint mit betraechtlichen Schwierigkeiten verbunden zu sein. Die Kosten bilden dabei nicht das Hauptproblem. Die Befragungsergebnisse lassen vielmehr darauf schliessen, dass die Gruende in fehlender fachlicher Qualifikation, organisatorischen Problemen, Informationsdefiziten und einer mangelnden Risikoperzeption zu suchen sind. ' (Autorenreferat) 'Security in {{companies}} {{becomes more and}} more a central problem in data processing and telecommunications. In every company the production process and the provision of services are based on functioning systems, the minimization of transmission errors, the assignment and demonstrability of communication processes and the confidential processing and transmission of data. There is {{every reason to believe that}} trustworthiness of the information and communication systems will serve as a basis for further diffusion and adoption of telematic services. Although the potential of vulnerability increases with the use of open networks, studies in large companies have shown that security aspects do not come first for many of them. They do not even take sufficient security measures against well-known risks such as software-anomalies or unsecured network access. Nevertheless, it should be assumed that large companies are likely to be among the pioneers rather than of the latecomers in the field of information and telecommunications security because of their financial and personnel resources. The results raise the question how Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises (SMEs) deal with the problem of security in data processing and telecommunications. In spring 1996 the research institute WIK asked the company ExperTeam/ Online Hanse GmbH to conduct an empirical study on the state of information and telecommunication security in SMEs. The intention was to assess the risk situation and the security awareness of the enterprises against the background of growing risks by the increasing use of telecommunications services. As the study shows the security situation of information and telecommunications in SMEs needs improvement. Despite the fact that the majority of companies consider protection aims like availability, liability, and confidence as indispensable, a detailed strategy or measure planning is hardly found. The interviews revealed that risk situations are often underestimated whereas their own knowledge in the field of telecommunications security is overestimated. The majority of the interviewed SMEs plan to improve their security by using technical solutions in the first place. Although the <b>appointment</b> <b>of</b> <b>experts</b> in the field of information security or the establishment of security committees can be an important contribution to the increase of security the implementation of organizational and personnel security measures seem to cause difficulties for many SMEs. Costs are not the main problem. The results of the study rather indicate that the reasons are to be found in a lack of professional qualification, information deficits and a lack of risk awareness. The implementation of security measures {{in companies}} has to be seen as a communication intensive, iterative and continous process and not as a problem that can be faced with unique solutions. Only few companies take extensive precautions against damages on the basis of risk analysis. The implementation of security measures is organized as an incremental process: Security measures are often taken only against such risks that have already caused security problems before. Security problems caused by the use of data networks such as manipulation, spying or theft of information can hardly be noticed without the implementation of security measures. Therefore, numerous SMEs underestimate the extent of potential as well as already existing security problems in their companies. On the one hand, there is often a lack of technical, personnel and organisational means to detect a damage. On the other hand, after the occurrence of a damage it is difficult to identify the real consequences.

40|$|Thesis (M. Ed.) - University of Natal, Durban, 1976. It {{has become}} a fairly common {{practice}} in Natal to borrow ideas from the English educational scene. No doubt this is to our advantage but perhaps not necessarily always so. It is possible that an idea is copied and pursued diligently here yet meanwhile, back at its source of development in England, the idea is fast loosing favour. It is necessary to sift the good from the bad before we borrow, and {{that can only be}} done by surveying the field thoroughly. The author of this thesis after spending a number of years in primary education was fortunate enough to receive a study grant from the Natal Education Department which enabled him to visit England and other countries, and study at first hand the primary schools there. The primary aim of this thesis. is, therefore, to examine some of the recent developments in primary education in England, to evaluate them and to consider the feasibility of adapting and utilising them in the primary schools of Natal. These developments offer an alternative approach to education and one that is closer to what we now know about children {{and the nature of the}} learning process. The English primary school offers hope to those who believe that because change is difficult, it is either an impossibility or it takes generations to bring about. This study should supply the answer to the question: "What is happening in British primary schools?", which Brian Young poses in Children At School - Primary Education in Britain Today (1). It may in addition minimise the chances of the merely faddish aspects being slavishly copied and avoid change for the sake of change. It may also be of assistance to those concerned with policy making in primary education, particularly in Natal, especially if they are seriously interested in exploring alternatives to existing patterns of instructions. The basic assumption underlying the whole study is that each child is an unique individual who is characterised by an unmatched set of gifts and limitations. While the approach adopted is a child-centred one, a confrontation with exclusive choices is avoided. It is not a question of the child or the teacher, children or subjects, subjects or an integrated programme, the individual or society, or freedom or discipline. The question: "How far do we need a concept of the educated man as well as the notion of the educated child?" (2), is very relevant to this study. Part One of this thesis is a discussion of. the various factors from which present-day practices have evolved. No historical account of the developments is undertaken, but a brief survey of the old elementary school is followed by a resume of the changing educational demands of a society which has undergone extensive changes in the last 75 years. Immense scientific and technological developments and the concomitant social and economic upheavals have called for new curricula, subject content and teaching methods. The role played by the progressives, a small group of avant-garde educationists whose views were considered eccentric in their time, is discussed in detail. The direct and indirect influence of educationists, philosophers and psychologists is more difficult to establish. This and the impact of official educational reports and Acts are also studied. Part Two concerns the purpose of English primary education. It is no theoretical dissertation on the aims of education. It rather attempts to establish what the primary school seeks to achieve for its pupils. The concept of 'being educated' is analysed and is followed by a discussion of what are termed immediate aims. Here attention is focused on the belief that primary education is to serve solely as a preparation for the education that is to follow and on the acquisition of skills such as reading, writing and arithmetic, and the ability to speak properly and listen attentively. Next follows a discussion of so-called long-term aims. Particular attention is given to the preparation of children for the society in which they will one day be adults; prerequisites such as adaptability and a critical mind are highlighted. The freedom of the individual and his place in society is examined. Finally, the opinions of teachers as reflected in a Schools Council exploratory study of aims, influences and attitudes, are briefly analysed. A comprehensive survey of every primary school in England by Her Majesty's Inspectorate revealed certain trend-setting schools. Part Three is a study of some of the recent developments that reflect the ethos prevalent in these schools. the blend of freedom and support where teachers and headteachers are relatively free to decide what to teach, how to teach it and the support they receive from a variety of sources, is discussed in detail. The move to what has become known as open or informal schooling and other features of these schools, such as the integrated day, team teaching and open plan schools are described. Part Four of this study concerns those aspects of English primary education that could with success be adapted and introduced into the primary schools of Natal. The features that are considered are the introduction of a more child-centred approach, the <b>appointment</b> <b>of</b> <b>experts</b> in primary education to decision- and policy-making positions, the in-service education of teachers, the fuller utilization of teachers' centres and the building design of primary schools...|$|E

In addition, we find that this positive reaction is concentrated among firms with relatively strong corporate governance, consistent with "accounting" financial expertise complementing strong governance, possibly because strong governance helps channel the expertise toward enhancing shareholder value. Together, {{these findings are consistent}} with financial expertise on audit committees improving corporate governance but only when both the expert and the appointing firm possess characteristics that facilitate the effective use of the expertise.

40|$|A {{challenge}} is posed {{to the institution}} of international adjudication by international disputes concerning physical risks to human beings and the environment. These cases are requiring international tribunals to exercise their powers of adjudication in circumstances of scientific uncertainty. This thesis posits that, by dint of the development and clarification {{of the law and}} through the revisitation of rules about proof, international adjudication is developing the capacity to deal with such international disputes. A growing emphasis on the importance of international procedural obligations, the harmonisation of international law, and a broadening acceptance of precautionary doctrines in substantive law help shape the legal issues coming before tribunals in disputes involving scientific uncertainty into more manageable form. International courts and tribunals are meanwhile attending to the problems that may be posed by the concept of a burden of proof in disputes involving scientific uncertainty. A move towards a more inquisitorial style of adjudication, relying on tribunals’ <b>appointment</b> <b>of</b> independent <b>expert</b> advisors, provides relief from pressures associated with the application of traditional rules on proof in such cases. At the same time, tribunals’ adjudicatory competence in such disputes is gradually being defined, using criteria by which respondents’ activities may practically be assessed, such as rationality and reasonableness.

Although this suggests that accounting expertise enhances {{the quality of a}} firm's financial reports, it is unclear whether financial reporting quality improves after appointing an accounting expert. Additionally, I explore how the strength of alternative governance provisions and the current expertise of the audit committee influence relations between appointing an accounting expert and changes in financial repOliing qua. l ity. I hypothesize that accounting experts possess the financial backgrounds needed to detect accounting manipulations and the reputational capital to warrant actions that limit exposure to financial reporting failures. Therefore, I predict that newly appointed IV accounting experts have the ability and incentive to strengthen financial reporting systems and increase the quality of financial reports. Furthermore. I predict tha...|$|R
40|$|We {{study the}} {{relation}} between audit committee accounting expertise, analyst following, and market liquidity. Our main results indicate that analyst following increases subsequent to the <b>appointment</b> <b>of</b> an accounting <b>expert</b> to the audit committee. We also provide evidence that accrual quality, as opposed to audit quality or management earnings forecasts, is the channel through which accounting expertise increases analyst following and improves analyst forecast properties. We also show that audit committee accounting expertise is related to higher trading volume and lower liquidity risk, supporting incentives for greater analyst following. Our study extends prior literature by providing evidence that audit committee accounting expertise enhances firms’ information environment beyond the effects it has on financial reporting quality or analysts’ forecast properties. Our study also complements the literature on determinants of analyst following and market liquidity, {{both of which are}} related to cost of capital. Results from our study should be useful to firms seeking to enhance analyst following and market liquidity...|$|R

40|$|This study {{investigates the}} {{influence}} of strong committee of independent directors {{on the board of}} directors on firm value. We focus on the factors that strengthen independent directors’ performance of fiduciary duties notably the presence <b>of</b> independent financial <b>expert,</b> senior independent director, independent board’s chairman, and absence of top management executives and presence of family members {{on the board of directors}}. We conduct our research using 221 samples of Malaysian listed companies. This study extends prior research by emphasizing the significance <b>of</b> regulating the <b>appointment</b> <b>of</b> independent financial <b>expert</b> and the support of independent director with in depth corporate governance experience on the board. The results show that board oversight roles enhanced firm performance when a senior independent director and an independent board’s chairman were present on the board where CEO, CFO, COO or MD was not a board member. Furthermore, the negative relationship between the proportion of family member director on the board and firm performance supported the imperativeness of higher independent director presence on the board. These findings provide empirical evidence in support of the significance of board independence as an effective governing mechanism for monitoring family-member director influence on board decisions. On the other hand, the negative relationship between the presence of more than majority independent director on the board and firm performance signifies their productivity is valued more than numbers...|$|R
