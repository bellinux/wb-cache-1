500|$|The real Abagnale {{never saw}} his father again after he ran away from home. Spielberg [...] "wanted to {{continue}} to have that connection where Frank kept trying to please his father; by making him proud of him; by seeing him in the uniform, the Pan-American uniform". However, Abagnale praised the idea. [...] "Even though I didn't see my dad again, every night after living a brilliant day and meeting many women, and making much money, I'd come back alone to a hotel room <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>just</b> think of {{my mom and dad}} and fantasize about getting them back together again, and cry. It's the justification of a fantasy." [...] Carl Hanratty (portrayed by Tom Hanks) is based on FBI agent Joseph Shea. In the shooting script the character was referred to as Joseph Shea, but was changed to Carl Hanratty for unknown reasons.|$|E
500|$|Clarke {{was never}} {{sure if she}} would finish her novel or {{if it would be}} published. Clarke tried to write for three hours each day, {{beginning}} at 5:30am, but struggled to keep this schedule. Rather than writing the novel from beginning to end, she wrote in fragments and attempted to stitch them together. Clarke, admitting that the project was for herself and not for the reader, [...] "clung to this method" [...] "because I felt that if I went back and started at the beginning, [...] would lack depth, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>just</b> be skimming the surface of what I could do. But if I had known {{it was going to take}} me ten years, I would never have begun. I was buoyed up by thinking that I would finish it next year, or the year after next." [...] Clarke and Greenland fell in love while she was writing the novel and moved in together.|$|E

She also published stories in Starlight 2 and Starlight 3; according to the New York Times Magazine, her work was known and appreciated by a small group of fantasy fans and critics on the internet. She was never sure, however, if she would finish her novel or if it would be published. Clarke tried to write for three hours each day, beginning at 5:30am, but struggled to keep this schedule.

The advice was succinct <b>and</b> helpful. <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>just</b> like to add one point. Namely, that all effective methods of contraception will reduce the spread of HIV in a population. This is achieved by reducing the opportunity for mother-to-child transmission during pregnancy...|$|R

2500|$|Hughes {{suggested}} to Columbus that they cast Macaulay Culkin {{in the main}} role because of his experience with the child actor while shooting Uncle Buck. Columbus met with other actors for the part, by his count [...] "hundreds and hundreds", as {{he felt it was}} his [...] "directorial responsibility". Columbus finally met with Culkin and agreed he was the right choice for the role. Due to Culkin's age, he could only work until 10 PM which created shooting problems for the crew because of the movie's many night-time scenes. The film's stunts also created tension for the crew during shooting. Columbus said, [...] "Every time the stunt guys did one of those stunts it wasn’t funny. We’d watch it, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>just</b> pray that the guys were alive." [...] Stunts were originally prepared with safety harnesses, but because of their visibility on camera, the film's final stunts were performed without them.|$|E

5000|$|Brad Wood {{provided}} a different recording approach, structuring the drum patterns and bass lines around Phair's vocal phrases and guitar riffs, instead of recording the rhythm section {{first and then}} layering the guitars and vocals on top. Phair has commented, [...] "It was fun. Actually we just played our parts separately. I laid down the guitar, <b>and</b> then <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>just</b> tell them what kind of song it would be {{and what kinds of}} instruments we needed to do. And then they would go in there and figure out a part and then do it. It was more like collage work than really playing with a band." ...|$|R
5000|$|In July 2013, Wicker {{proposed}} that the Senate meet to discuss a controversial change to filibuster rules. The Senate held the private meeting in the Old Senate chamber to discuss Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid's threat of the so-called [...] "nuclear option", which would change the rules for Senate votes on President Obama's executive branch nominees. Wicker said he hoped the chamber's bipartisan past could serve as an inspiration for {{the debate about the}} nuclear option: [...] "I think there are concessions that can be made on both sides. <b>And</b> then <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>just</b> hope that, institutionally, we can get away from this mindset." ...|$|R

6000|$|She {{owned it}} was her father, but would enter into no particulars, only shook her head, {{and said he was}} not well and not like himself, {{and it was a great}} pity.

60|$|So I said it wouldn't be {{no use to}} try to play it any longer, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>just</b> make a clean {{breast and}} tell her everything, but she musn't go back on her promise. Then I told her {{my father and mother}} was dead, and the law had bound me out to a mean old farmer in the country thirty mile back from the river, and he treated me so bad I couldn't stand it no longer; he went away to be gone a couple of days, and so I took my chance and stole some of his daughter's old clothes and cleared out, and I had been three nights coming the thirty miles. I {{traveled}} nights, and hid daytimes and slept, and the bag of bread and meat I carried from home lasted me all the way, and I had a-plenty. I said I believed my uncle Abner Moore would take care of me, and so that was why I struck out for this town of Goshen.|$|E
5000|$|Denrele is an {{entertainment}} personality whose style {{has been described}} as [...] "punk and fun".

5000|$|Although {{the ability}} to draw has always come easy, the process takes practice, “For years <b>and</b> years, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>just</b> flip pages in sketchbooks and draw, draw, draw until {{something}} came out. That’s {{a good way to}} approach it, I think.” Talking about his artistic process, he explains that is doesn’t always come out the way he wants or expects it to the first time, “Once I let go of the struggle and start sketching, it starts to come out. It’ll never be completely pure, there are always filters that go through you. If you’re tuned in, you can feel if it’s flowing. There’s something that we all tune in to, and we can be connected to it. It’s a choice.” ...|$|R

[...] "I just {{want to give you}} a little hint, which I am sure I believe is quite unnecessary," [...] continued Lady Milborough. Then she paused, but Trevelyan would not speak. She looked into his face, and saw that it was black. But the man was the only child of her dearest friend, and she persevered. [...] "Do you know I don't quite like that Colonel Osborne coming so much to your house." [...] The face before her became still blacker, but still the man said nothing. [...] "I dare say it is a prejudice on my part, but I have always disliked him. I think he is a dangerous friend;--what I call a snake in the grass. And though Emily's high good sense, and love for you, and general feelings on such a subject, are just what a husband must desire--Indeed, I am quite sure that the possibility of anything wrong has never entered into her head. But it is the very purity of her innocence which makes the danger. He is a bad man, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>just</b> say a word to her, if I were you, to make her understand that his coming to her of a morning is not desirable. Upon my word, I believe there is nothing he likes so much as going about and making mischief between men and their wives." ...|$|E

And doing my work well, the innate justice of the men, assisted by their wholesome dislike for a clawing and rending wild-cat ruction, soon led them to give over their hectoring. After a bit of strife, my attitude was accepted, and it was my pride that I was taken in as an equal in spirit as well as in fact. From then on, everything was beautiful, and the voyage promised to be a happy one.|$|R
