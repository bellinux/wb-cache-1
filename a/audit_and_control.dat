25|$|Before {{the reign}} of Raja Raja I, parts of the Chola {{territory}} were ruled by hereditary lords and princes who were in a loose alliance with the Chola rulers. Raja Raja initiated a project of land survey and assessment in 1000 {{which led to the}} reorganization of the empire into units known as valanadus. From {{the reign of}} Raja Raja Chola I until the reign of Vikrama Chola in 1133, the hereditary lords and local princes were either replaced or turned into dependent officials. This led to the king exercising a closer control over the different parts of the empire. Rajaraja strengthened the local self-government and installed a system of <b>audit</b> <b>and</b> <b>control</b> by which the village assemblies and other public bodies were held to account while retaining their autonomy. To promote trade, he sent the first Chola mission to China.|$|E

40|$|We {{are proud}} {{to be able to}} present this book, the first volume of what we intend to become an annual book series. This year’s edition {{contains}} eleven papers. Each paper is based on a thesis in the field of Accounting, <b>Auditing</b> <b>and</b> <b>Control,</b> on which these students received a Master’s degree in Economics & Business from the Erasmus School of Economics in 2008. Each year at the section Accounting, <b>Auditing</b> <b>and</b> <b>Control,</b> approximately 150 master students experience that writing a master thesis is hard work. It is even harder to notice that despite all efforts that students put into the thesis, just a few people will read the final result. As thesis supervisors we have noticed over the years that many theses deserve a wider audience, and may help students from our master streams in writing their theses. That is why we have planned this new annual book series. In this series, we intend to publish a collection of master theses each year that meet the following four criteria: 1. The thesis was defended in the specific calendar year; 2. The thesis was supervised by one of the staff members from the Accounting, <b>Auditing</b> <b>and</b> <b>Control</b> group; 3. The topic of the thesis is relevant for master students in the streams of Accounting & Finance or Accounting, <b>Auditing,</b> <b>and</b> Control; 4. The thesis is of high quality, based on the usual criteria that apply for master theses at the Erasmus School of Economics. By publishing papers from these theses, we aim to achieve the two purposes described above: first, to provide a wider audience for theses that deserve that, and second, to offer some help to current and future master students in the streams of Accounting & Finance or Accounting, <b>Auditing,</b> <b>and</b> <b>Control</b> in writing their theses by presenting “good practices”...|$|R
25|$|After the Civil War, Ferry {{returned}} to both {{his political career}} and law practice. In 1866, he ran against Lafayette S. Foster, the current incumbent of the Class III Connecticut Senate seat. Ferry won the election, and took {{his place in the}} U.S. Senate on March 4, 1867. He became very active in committees, and favored amnesty for members of the Confederacy. Ferry participated in the Impeachment of President Andrew Johnson, voting to convict. In 1869, Ferry was attacked by a rare disease of his spine. This disease led to a slow deterioration of his spine. This slowed his workings in the Senate, but he continued to play an active role. From 1870 to 1871, he served as the chairman of the Committee to <b>Audit</b> <b>and</b> <b>Control</b> the Contingent Expenses. From 1871 to 1875, he was chairman of the Committee on Patents. Ferry also served on the United States Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions. Ferry was considered a Liberal Republican, but he declined to officially associate with the breakaway party. In 1872, Ferry was reelected for a second term. His main supporters were Democrats and Liberal Republicans.|$|E

2500|$|Once in the Senate, Carpenter moderated {{his views}} {{to the degree}} that {{he became one of the}} spokesmen of the {{emerging}} Stalwart Republicans. He opposed any [...] "fundamental conditions" [...] placed on states wishing to be readmitted to the Union, and favored blanket amnesty for former Confederates. Carpenter was known as one of the staunchest supporters of the corrupt Grant administration. In the Senate he presented an unabashed defense of political patronage, mocking the idea of civil service reform. He also feuded with Liberal Republican senators Charles Sumner and Carl Schurz over many issues. He delivered a sarcastic denunciation of Sumner's wide-reaching civil rights amendment to the Confederate amnesty bill. As the chair of an investigating committee he also debunked Sumner and Schurz's claim that the War Department had broken its neutrality when it sold outmoded rifles to France during the Franco-Prussian War. Despite such skirmishes Carpenter was a respected figure in the senate, being elected president pro tempore by his colleagues in 1871. He also served as chairman of the Committee on Enrolled Bills (42nd Congress) and the Committee to <b>Audit</b> <b>and</b> <b>Control</b> the Contingent Expense (42nd and 43rd Congresses).|$|E
