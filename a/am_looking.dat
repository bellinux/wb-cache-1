500|$|Following Howarth's 1992 casting as Todd Manning, he {{occasionally}} vacated the role. His 2003 departure was his longest absence from OLTL; {{he did not}} return to the series until 2011. Todd was recast in 2003 with St. John, and Howarth joined As the World Turns as Paul Ryan until it was cancelled in 2010. Malone stated that because of Todd's appeal, which he credited to Howarth, [...] "The network was therefore happy to have him return to Llanview whenever Roger would come back, and happy to have him move into story in major ways." [...] In April 2011, after several months of speculation, OLTL confirmed Howarth's return, although it was unclear if he would portray Todd Manning. He stated, [...] "I <b>am</b> <b>looking</b> forward to returning to One Life to Live". Executive producer Frank Valentini said, [...] "We are thrilled to have Roger return to One Life to Live".

500|$|Still, Balzac {{believed}} that keeping her letters was dangerous and, {{in a moment}} of characteristic impulse, threw them into the fire. He described it to her as [...] "the saddest and most frightful day of my life... I <b>am</b> <b>looking</b> at the ashes as I write to you, and I tremble seeing how little space fifteen years takes up." [...] On 5 September 1847 he left Paris to join {{her for the first time}} in Wierzchownia. They spent several happy months together, but financial obligations required his presence in France. The Revolution of 1848 began one week after his return. Back in Wierzchownia, Hańska lost 80,000 francs due to a granary fire, and her time was consumed with three lawsuits. These complications, and Balzac's constant debt, meant that their finances were unstable, and she hesitated anew at the idea of marriage. In any case, a wedding would be impossible without approval from the Tsar, which he did not grant until spring of 1850. On 2 July 1849 Russian authorities responding to Balzac's request in December 1847 to marry Hańska stated that he could do so, but that Hańska could not keep her land.|$|E
