Initially focusing their work on projects local to the United States, HBA began work on the Beverly Rodeo Hotel in Beverly Hills and Chez Voltaire, a restaurant in Florida. Over time, HBA expanded its work internationally, establishing an office in Hong Kong and later an office in London.After a decrease in revenue between 2008 and 2010, newly appointed co-CEOs Ian Carr and René Kærskov expanded HBA's services by establishing HBA Studio (design services for mid-tier and limited-service hotel projects), HBA Architecture (<b>architectural</b> <b>design</b> <b>services),</b> Illuminate (lighting design consultancy), and HBA Canvas (art budgeting, concept planning, and procurement/installation).

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{the use of}} crowdsourcing as a new approach for architectural design acquisition.

In this paper we will discuss the methods and techniques of architectural crowdsourcing and illustrate the processes and outcomes through a series of projects: a remodeling project for a closet; an interior design challenge for a dining space; and a layout problem for an apartment complex. We will then evaluate the protocol and outcome of architectural crowdsourcing, and convey the professional and popular media response to this new method of architectural design acquisition...|$|E
40|$|The {{design and}} {{construction}} of modern residential architecture, which came into critical focus by architects of the Machine Age, {{continues to be a}} priority in the architectural discourse. For Modern architects, the desire to relate the house to industrial processes was an aesthetic and social imperative that never gained popular acceptance. Today, mention of an industrial, factory-produced house conjures images of mobile homes and cheap construction rather than innovative modern design. At the same time, the typical suburban single-family unit offers {{little in the way of}} innovation or individual expression. Land developers, rather than architects or planners, have taken control of the residential market, and do not offer <b>architectural</b> <b>design</b> <b>services</b> to average consumers. As a result, the design of homes adheres to generic standards that are neither flexible nor adaptable to changing family and individual needs. Stylistic choices are extremely limited. The topic of this thesis is to address these and other issues currently impeding the development of innovative residential architecture by exploring the use of computational tools to generate unique architectural solutions. Strategies for obtaining meaningful information from clients that generate spatial rules are explored, as well as a construction methodology that supports multivalent, adjustable architecture.

40|$|This thesis {{looks at}} the {{practice}} of design as it emerges in <b>architectural</b> <b>design</b> and <b>service</b> <b>design.</b> The lens adopted considers design both as an activity {{as well as a}} space full of contradictions, which are accumulated tensions. Design activity is a professional occupation that interacts with other activities, whereas design space is a range of possibilities considered for a project. The contradictions in both sides are separately identified and then rejoined to follow the transitions from one side to another. When pursuing this dialectic, this research has found two ways in which design reproduces contradictions in society. The first, reductive design, aims to reduce contradictions by partitioning the design space into small manageable parts. The second, expansive design, aims to expand contradictions by increasing awareness for the possibilities in the design space. The former ignores, hides, or removes contradictions from the design space and the later uncovers, highlights, or takes advantage of contradictions in the design space. The combination of reductive design and expansive design leads to uneven development. This understanding of design comes from three short-term empirical studies of <b>architectural</b> <b>design</b> and <b>service</b> <b>design</b> projects, which were complemented with two experiments undertaken with design students. The empirical studies show evidence that expansive design may emerge from playing design games; however, this also depends on the willingness of participants to deal with contradictions in an inclusive way. The main contribution of this thesis is highlighting and developing further the concept of expansive design, which implies dealing with contradictions in an inclusive way...|$|R
