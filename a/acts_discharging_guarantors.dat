Low permeability subsoils can result in lack of percolation and thus ponding of the effluent on the surface with potential surface water pollution around the site. In such cases, the only options available are discharge of wastewater to surface water (requiring a Water Pollution <b>Act</b> <b>discharge</b> licence, which local authorities are reluctant to grant) or installation of a zero discharge system.

Zinc so prepared, {{even though}} impure, does not sensibly {{decompose}} {{the water of}} dilute sulphuric acid, but still has such affinity for the oxygen, that the moment a metal which, like copper or platina, {{has little or no}} affinity, touches it in the acid, action ensues, and a powerful and abundant electric current is produced. It is probable that the mercury acts by bringing the surface, in consequence of its fluidity, into one uniform condition, and preventing those differences in character between one spot and another which are necessary for the formation of the minute voltaic circuits referred to (998.). If any difference does exist at the first moment, with regard to the proportion of zinc and mercury, at one spot on the surface, as compared with another, that spot having the least mercury is first acted on, and, by solution of the zinc, is soon placed in the same condition as the other parts, and the whole plate rendered superficially uniform. One part cannot, therefore, <b>act</b> as a <b>discharger</b> to another; and hence all the chemical power upon the water at its surface is in that equable condition (949.), which, though it tends to produce an electric current through the liquid to another plate of metal which can <b>act</b> as a <b>discharger</b> (950.), presents no irregularities by which any one part, having weaker affinities for oxygen, can <b>act</b> as a <b>discharger</b> to another. Two excellent and important consequences follow upon this state of the metal. The first is, that the full equivalent of electricity is obtained for the oxidation of a certain quantity of zinc; the second, that a battery constructed with the zinc so prepared, and charged with dilute sulphuric acid, is active only whilst the electrodes are connected, and ceases to act or be acted upon by the acid the instant the communication is broken.|$|R
