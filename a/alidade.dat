25|$|Halley {{had been}} {{instructed}} by Robert Hooke and John Flamsteed to persuade Hevelius to use telescopes for his measurements, yet Hevelius demonstrated {{that he could}} do well with only quadrant and <b>alidade.</b> He is thus considered the last astronomer to do major work without the use of a telescope.|$|E
25|$|In 1996, Hunter and {{the other}} four towers {{were added to the}} Historic Lookout Register, and then to the National Register the {{following}} year. Local committees raised money for their repair, and on October 7, 2000 DEC formally reopened the Hunter tower to the public as observation towers with interpretive materials, including an <b>alidade</b> in the tower cab.|$|E
25|$|A {{significant}} number of stars in the sky, such as Aldebaran, Altair and Deneb, and astronomical terms such as <b>alidade,</b> azimuth, and nadir, are still referred to by their Arabic names. A large corpus of literature from Islamic astronomy remains today, numbering approximately 10,000 manuscripts scattered throughout the world, {{many of which have}} not been read or catalogued. Even so, a reasonably accurate picture of Islamic activity in the field of astronomy can be reconstructed.|$|E
2500|$|The FAMAS {{features}} two <b>alidades</b> for aiming {{rifle grenades}} with several modes: ...|$|R
5000|$|L'Odeur du lac The Scent of the Lake (three stories not yet {{published}} in Italian; French translation and foreword by Olivier Favier, <b>Alidades,</b> Évian, 2008).|$|R
50|$|This form {{is shown}} in the diagram as having pointers. These can be used to read off an angle on a scale that is {{engraved}} around the outer edge (or limb) of the instrument. <b>Alidades</b> of this form are found on astrolabes, mariner's astrolabes and similar instruments.|$|R
2500|$|In {{indirect}} fire mode the grenade support (more exactly named [...] "grenade enforcement ring" [...] in French) is moved forwards or backwards on the barrel which has markings (12/13?). This changes {{the position of}} the grenade on the barrel and automatically the volume of the chamber in which the gas expands to push the grenade forward. Each position of the grenade support has a number which is multiplied by a certain fixed number depending on the <b>alidade</b> position, 45° or 75°; this will accurately indicate the firing distance of the grenade.|$|E
2500|$|He {{created the}} nonius {{to improve the}} astrolabe's accuracy. [...] This {{consisted}} {{of a number of}} concentric circles traced on the astrolabe and dividing each successive one with one fewer divisions than the adjacent outer circle. [...] Thus the outermost quadrant would comprise 90° in 90 equal divisions, the next inner would have 89 divisions, the next 88 and so on. [...] When an angle was measured, the circle and the division on which the <b>alidade</b> fell was noted. [...] A table was then consulted to provide the exact measure.|$|E
50|$|The <b>alidade</b> {{was free}} to rotate about a pin through {{the centre of the}} instrument. The vanes of the <b>alidade</b> were either slotted or pierced with a hole to allow the user to align the <b>alidade.</b>|$|E
40|$|The {{field work}} was {{conducted}} in areas adjacent to White­hall, Montana, {{as has been the}} custom for the past several years. Instruction in the proper use of the telescopic and open sight <b>alidades,</b> and the Brunton compass for surveying geologic features was given. Advantages of pacing and speed­ometer mapping were pointed out and used...|$|R
50|$|Stadia {{readings}} used in surveying can {{be taken}} with modern instruments such as transits, theodolites, plane-table <b>alidades</b> and levels. When using the stadia measuring method, a stadia rod is held so that it appears between two stadia marks visible on the instrument's reticle. The stadia rod has measurements written on it that can be read through the telescope of the instrument, providing a known length for the distance calculations.|$|R
50|$|There {{has always}} been a need for {{accurate}} measuring instruments. Whether it is a linear device such as a ruler or vernier or a circular device such as a protractor, astrolabe, sextant, theodolite, or setting circles for astronomical telescopes, the desire for ever greater precision has always existed. For every improvement in the measuring instruments, such as better <b>alidades</b> or the introduction of telescopic sights, the need for more exact graduations immediately followed.|$|R
50|$|<b>Alidade</b> D has vanes {{without any}} openings. In this case, {{the object is}} viewed and the <b>alidade</b> is rotated until the two {{opposite}} vanes simultaneously eclipse the object. With skill, this sort of <b>alidade</b> can yield very precise measures. In this example, pointers are shown.|$|E
5000|$|The {{earliest}} altazimuth instruments {{consisted of}} a base graduated with a full circle at the [...] and a vertical angle measuring device, most often a semicircle. An <b>alidade</b> on the base was used to sight an object for horizontal angle measurement, and a second <b>alidade</b> was mounted on the vertical semicircle. Later instruments had a single <b>alidade</b> on the vertical semicircle and the entire semicircle was mounted {{so as to be}} used to indicate horizontal angles directly. Eventually, the simple, open-sight <b>alidade</b> was replaced with a sighting telescope. This was first done by Jonathan Sisson in 1725.|$|E
50|$|By {{using the}} <b>alidade</b> as a {{surveying}} level, {{information on the}} topography of the site can be directly recorded on the drawing as elevations. Distances to the objects can be measured directly or {{by the use of}} stadia marks in the telescope of the <b>alidade.</b>|$|E
50|$|Other {{forms of}} {{tacheometry}} in surveying {{include the use}} of stadia rods with theodolites or plane-table <b>alidades.</b> These use stadia marks on the instrument's reticle to measure the distance between two points on the stadia rod (the stadia interval). This is converted to distance from the instrument to the stadia rod by multiplying the stadia interval by the stadia interval factor. If the stadia rod is not at the same elevation as the instrument, the value must be corrected for the angle of elevation between the instrument and the rod.|$|R
50|$|When {{intersecting}} {{lines of}} position {{are used to}} fix the position of an unmapped feature or point by fixing its position relative to two (or more) mapped or known points, the method is known as intersection. At each known point (hill, lighthouse, etc.), the navigator measures the bearing to the same unmapped target, drawing a line on the map from each known position to the target. The target is located where the lines intersect on the map. In earlier times, the intersection method was used by forest agencies and others using specialized <b>alidades</b> to plot the (unknown) location of an observed forest fire from two or more mapped (known) locations, such as forest fire observer towers.|$|R
50|$|The {{theodolite}} is {{an instrument}} for the measurement of angles. It uses two separate circles, protractors or <b>alidades</b> to measure angles in the horizontal and the vertical plane. A telescope mounted on trunnions is aligned vertically with the target object. The whole upper section rotates for horizontal alignment. The vertical circle measures the angle that the telescope makes against the vertical, known as the zenith angle. The horizontal circle uses an upper and lower plate. When beginning the survey, the surveyor points the instrument in a known direction (bearing), and clamps the lower plate in place. The instrument can then rotate to measure the bearing to other objects. If no bearing is known or direct angle measurement is wanted, the instrument can be set to zero during the initial sight. It will then read the angle between the initial object, the theodolite itself, and the item that the telescope aligns with.|$|R
50|$|If the sextant is {{permanently}} fixed in position, only {{the position of}} the <b>alidade</b> or similar index need be determined. In that case, the observer moved the <b>alidade</b> until the object of interest is centered in the sights and then reads the graduations marked on the arc.|$|E
50|$|The <b>alidade</b> was {{originally}} {{a part of}} many types of scientific and astronomical instrument. At one time, some alidades, particularly those used on graduated circles as on astrolabes, were also called diopters. With modern technology, the name is applied to complete instruments such as the plane table <b>alidade.</b>|$|E
50|$|Set the {{latitude}} {{on a scale}} in the <b>alidade.</b>|$|E
40|$|The {{design of}} color clashes into two problems; the correct {{definition}} {{of colors and}} their true representation. A preliminary comparison of color combination seems {{to be important in}} the design choice, because the overall effect is more relevant than clarification of the exact value of hues, in respect of which you could yet accept the variable degree of approximation. Therefore, the usefulness of new auxiliary tools development, to allow a display of color choices and their homologous combinations, could be interfaced with the measuring-production-representation of shades. According to color theories, which refer {{to a wide variety of}} shapes, a topologically flexible model is able to suit different assumptions and it could be applicable for fabric, wallpaper and tiles design, including interior and urban design. The hypothesis referred to the realization of digital color-solid, allowing quick display of equivalent color combinations, throughout the rotation of some radial <b>alidades,</b> whose direction shows different shade with similar harmony. This requires identifying a regular solid, which to apply the colour symmetry, then proceeding with a geodesic tessellation with the smallest deformation among the different tiles of the tessellation pattern. The solid that best meets this requirement is the octahedron, whose 6 vertices allow to place in a prominent position the four psychological primaries (red, green, yellow and blue) and the two achromatic colors (black and white). The geodesic projection of the tessellation on the sphere allows a - quite- regular layout of all intermediate shades. The choice to replicate the application of tessellation pattern of the same generative algorithm is due to the need to minimize the tiles deformations. This would be lower starting from a solid with a higher number of faces. The pattern allows you to display the selected combination of hue on continuous surface of the sphere. The different colors obtained by mixing two components, both along the diameter of the stereographic projection of the tetrahedrons’ edges, on the face there are the nuances of three blending colors, in the center of which are the intermediate colors between the colors of each vertex. The generative tessellation allows you to change from time to time the number of dowels - then of colors- depending on the difference wanted between contiguous colors. In this way, the arrangement of colors on the surface of the sphere, which is symmetric around its center, allows to "measure" equivalent combinations, by the rotation within the space, by a number of choices of <b>alidades</b> integral between them, either of a regular shape of two or three dimensions inserted into the sphere...|$|R
