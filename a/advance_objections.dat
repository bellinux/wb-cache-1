5000|$|Vilem Flusser's {{analysis}} of Tsai's work delves into {{his place in}} both the Eastern and Western traditions. Possibly Tsai himself does not stand within Western tradition. The {{analysis of}} his phenomena seems to reveal this. In that case the arguments just advanced cannot touch him. Possibly he stands within an Oriental tradition, for which (so at least it looks like to a Western observer) man is not a being radically separated form all others. For such a tradition man may feel deeply united with animals, plants, {{and other types of}} beings. He can therefore, conceive of them much more as [...] "others" [...] than we can. And the phenomena Tsai produces are then, in their naive, plant-like Gestalten, [...] "true others" [...] If I can dialogue with a plant (and Oriental tradition seems to suggest this), then a fortiori, I can dialogue with the phenomena Tsaiis producing. Such an hypothesis of Tsai's position would explain his approach to the problem posed by the series [...] "thing-other." [...] He could then still see others (even in a stone), where we no longer can see them. In this case Tsai may say that his is an important Oriental contribution to the Western (and bankrupt) attempt to free man from the determining effects of objects of culture. He may say that he is using Western models and Western methods from an Oriental approach, in order to try and solve the universally human problem of freedom from determination. And he will be completely correct in thus answering the above <b>advanced</b> <b>objections.</b>|$|R

Priest claims that, in this way, his theory can include an unrestricted principle of characterization for objects. Now, some representational properties attributed to fictional characters, a kind of fictional entities, involve a crucial reference {{to the world in}} which {{they are supposed to be}} instantiated. I argue that these representational properties are problematic for Priest’s theory and that he cannot accept an unrestricted version of the principle of characterization.

A critical step in Zagzebski’s argument is the move from epistemic self-trust to granting this sort of trust to other people—a move for which a sub-argument can be drawn out of her essay.

Although it will strike an informed student as strange that the procedure for the rendering of declaratory judgments should be attacked as unconstitutional, {{the fact is that}} the issue has been raised in a number of American cases, though never in any other country.

Fourteen state courts have considered these arguments and have unanimously concluded that they are unsound, because they proceed from a misconception as to the nature of a declaratory judgment. After some earlier hesitation, the United States Supreme Court has now held that a decree of execution is no essential part of a valid and final judgment. The fact that the highest courts in fourteen states have expressly held, after one early misstep in Michigan, that the declaratory judgment is in every respect constitutional, and that the courts of twelve other states have assumed its constitutionality, would ordinarily relieve a commentator from spending much time or space on the question of constitutionality...|$|R

40|$|After {{distinguishing}} between a metaphysical and a contemplative strategy {{interpretation of the}} no-self doctrine, I argue that the latter allows for the illumination of significant and under-discussed Kantian affinities with Buddhist views {{of the self and}} moral psychology. Unlike its metaphysical counterpart, the contemplative strategy interpretation, understands the doctrine of no-self as a technique of perception, undertaken from the practical standpoint of action. I argue that if we think of the contemplative strategy version of the no-self doctrine as a process engaged in, in order to free oneself from delusion and to see things more objectively in order to promote right action, then we find a clear parallel in Kant’s duty of self-knowledge which demands that we rid ourselves of deluded moral self-descriptions. While in Buddhism the aim is a selflessness that liberates one from suffering, for Kant the aim is an agency free of the conceit that interferes with clear moral vision, sound judgement, and dutiful action. I conclude by responding to <b>objections</b> <b>advanced</b> by Charles Goodman which aim to show that the Kantian position is deeply at odds with Buddhist thinking, arguing that neither Kantian agency nor Kantian self-legislation is undermined by the doctrine of no-self...|$|R

David Lewis [1973 b] offers a possible worlds approach to a theory of counterfactuals. He attempts to specify necessary and sufficient conditions according to which a given counterfactual is true or false. My profit surveys Lewis's theory of counterfactuals in detail. Although for the most part I defend Lewis's account from several objectors, in the final chapter I reason that his theory is susceptible to a severe skepticism, which threatens any philosophical theory that relies on Lewis's theory to distinguish between non-paradigmatically true and false counterfactuals. As for the more sympathetic portion of my project, while I show how Lewis's canonical account cannot handle some paradigmatically false counterfactuals-viz., those containing true components-I try to repair his analysis in the spirit of Alan Penczek (1997). I then discuss Lewis's extension or enhancement to his original theory, which he gives in order to foil an <b>objection</b> <b>advanced</b> by Kit Fine (1975) and Jonathan Bennett (1974).

40|$|The {{episode of}} the trial of Jesus before Herod Antipas, being unique to Luke’s Gospel (23 : 6 - 12) – and despite the popular notion {{that it does not}} {{contribute}} to the development of the Lukan Passion Narrative – is nevertheless shown to fulfill a pertinent and multi-faceted function. In the course of the literary analysis, the most intriguing problem discussed was the origin of this narrative. Despite the prevailing opinion arguing for the Markan origin of the text, it seems more reasonable to assume the existence of an independent source (or sources), written or oral, which gave rise the whole tradition of the encounter between Jesus and Herod. Luke was fully responsible for the wording of this episode. As to the historicity of this encounter, there are good reasons to accept the fact that it really took place. All the <b>objections</b> <b>advanced</b> by a substantial number of authors can be reasonably countered. The exegetical analysis pointed out the importance of Jesus’ silence, the act of putting a white robe on Jesus, and the reconciliation between Herod and Pilate. Each of these three realities has profound christological meaning, revealing Jesus’ true identity. The main objective of this article was the search for the most plausible reason(s) for including this episode within the Lukan Passion Narrative. Jesus always plays an active, dynamic role elsewhere in the Lukan Passion Narrative, but in the Herod pericope there is a striking contrast as Jesus remains passive. Jesus likewise usually dominates the Passion scenes, yet even when that domination is not by means of his words and deeds, as is the case in this episode, he remains in control through his silence. It seems that the main stress of the whole narrative lies on Jesus’ innocence. Under that overriding theme, the passage is seen to have at least a four-fold purpose: historical (Jesus was guiltless despite being placed on trial); christological (the true identity of Jesus’ person and mission is disclosed by Jesus’ behavior and its effect, i. e. reconciliation); pedagogical (Jesus is a model for later Christians to imitate, and Herod is an anti-model by his lack of faith); and apologetic (Jesus, and consequently Christians, are innocent of the charges brought against them by both Rome and the Jews).

40|$|A {{sample of}} 84 Abell {{clusters}} {{has been investigated}} to determine photometric and metric properties of brightest cluster galaxies {{as a function of}} cluster richness. The clusters are distributed fairly uniformly in Abell richness class. Seventy-five new measurements of cluster redshifts are presented (previously published redshifts were used for the nine other clusters). The selection criteria resulted in a strong redshift-richness correlation in the sample. Poor clusters (richness classes 0 and 1) have redshifts ~ 0. 09, while the richest clusters have redshifts roughly as twice as large. Direct imaging of the core of each cluster was affected using a CCD area photometer. The wavelength response of the CCD is so different from that of previous photometric devices that a new photometric system is required. The reductions employ photon based k-corrections (instead of energy based ones) and galactic absorption determined by the neutral hydrogen column density. The luminosity of the brightest cluster galaxy (G 1) within an aperture of 16 kpc radius is shown to be a good standard candle. Previous aperture measurements of 135 first-ranked cluster galaxies are placed on the CCD photometric system. Nearly 200 Gl's with redshifts less than 0. 3 have been measured, and they effectively determine the luminosity of giant ellipticals at the present epoch. Their aperture luminosity dispersion is 0. 34 mag, which can be reduced to slightly under 0. 3 mag by removing richness and morphological trends. The richness correction is reasonably well established at 0. 10 magnitudes per Abell richness class, with the rich clusters having brighter galaxies. The trend of luminosity with Bautz-Morgan type matches those of previous investigations, ~ 0. 12 mag per subclass, with BM I clusters having brightest cluster galaxies which are 0. 3 mag brighter than the average Gl. Aperture magnitudes were also determined for the second and third ranked cluster galaxies (G 2 and G 3), which are defined as the next two brightest galaxies within 250 kpc of Gl. The limiting radius was adopted because of the relatively small area covered by the detector. The dispersion in the aperture luminosity for G 2 is 0. 55 mag; for G 3 the dispersion is 0. 65 mag. On average G 2 is 0. 8 mag and G 3 1. 3 mag fainter than Gl. The luminosity dependence of G 2 and G 3 on Abell richness class is roughly the same as that for Gl, except for the richest clusters where G 2 and G 3 are much brighter than expected. There is no significant BM-luminosity correlation for either G 2 or G 3 in this sample. The observed colors for the brightest three cluster galaxies indicate that no color evolution has taken place since redshifts of 0. 25 (~four billion years). The radius surface brightness profiles inside 16 kpc for Gl, G 2, and G 3 are fit fairly well by either a de Vaucouleurs model or a modified Hubble law. At 16 kpc the surface brightness for G 1 falls off like a power law with an index of - 1. 6 to - 1. 8. For first-ranked galaxies the mean effective radius is 28 kpc and the mean core radius is 2. 1 kpc. These scale lengths are three and five times the values for G 2 and G 3, respectively. The strong correlation of Gl's structure with its absolute magnitude and with cluster morphology are confirmed. The average aperture correction factor (α) for first-ranked cluster galaxies is 0. 7; this reduces the sensitivity of the Hubble diagram to q[subscript o] by 35 %. Nearly half of the brightest cluster galaxies have multiple nuclei, roughly five times the number expected from projection effects. The multiple systems are, on average, ~ 0. 13 magnitudes brighter than the single systems. An evolutionary correction to q[subscript o] of ~+ 1. 5 is required if the multiple systems are interpreted as mergers induced by dynamical friction. The merger process, however, can be calibrated from the α-luminosity relations; this allows corrections to be applied to each galaxy individually. There is a strong effective radius-surface brightness relation for brightest cluster galaxies. The surface brightness at the effective radius I(R[subscript e), determines the effective radius (R[subscript e] to ~ 25 %. The observed effective radii (determined from fits to the inner 16 kpc) range from ~ 4 kpc to over 100 kpc. The outer regions (> 30 kpc) of galaxies with extended envelopes do not match the de Vaucouleurs profile found by fitting the inner regions. An angular diameter test based on the effective radii is impractical due to the large intrinsic scatter; a test using the surface brightness corrected effective radii conveys the same information as the standard redshift-magnitude test. The effective radius-surface brightness relation explains the small dispersion in the aperture magnitudes of Gl, and predicts that the total luminosities of brightest cluster galaxies grow as the 0. 7 power of the scale length. If the mass-to-light ratio in ellipticals is constant, the luminosity-scale length correlation is incompatible with the Faber-Jackson relation. Application of the R[subscript e]-I(R[subscript e]) relation to the brightest galaxies in Virgo (NGC 4472 and NGC 4486) yields a null result (no infall) for the distortion of the local Hubble flow. Infall velocities of 250 km s[superscript - 1] are excluded at the 2 σ level. The second and third ranked galaxies follow a similar R[subscript e]-I(R[subscript e]) relation. The exponent in the luminosity scale length relation for G 2 is about 10 % smaller than that for Gl. For G 3 the luminosity increases as the square root of the scale length. Data of sufficient quality to allow construction of luminosity functions were obtained for 60 of the 84 clusters. The limited size of the field required that the luminosity functions be determined inside a given metric radius (250 kpc). The observed luminosity functions were fit to Schechter functions using maximum likelihood techniques. The brightest cluster galaxy cannot be drawn from a universal luminosity function. It is impossible to reconcile the small total luminosity-richness correlation with the relatively large (0. 6 mag) dispersion in their total luminosities. The first- ranked galaxies are also about one magnitude too bright to be drawn from a Schechter function. Excluding Gl from the luminosity function results in satisfactory Schechter function fits {{to the rest of the}} cluster members. The power-law slope at low luminosities is ~- 1, but is not well determined. The observations find a mean M[subscript *] in close agreement with other investigations. The observed dispersion of M[subscript *] about the mean as a function of cluster richness is similar to that predicted from numerical simulations. Cluster richness is defined as the total luminosity found by integrating over all luminosities the best fitting Schechter function determined from galaxies within 250 kpc of the brightest cluster galaxy. This definition correlates well but not perfectly with Abell richness class. Richness (actually central density) varies by nearly a factor of 40 from the poorest to the richest clusters in this sample,and in several poor clusters the brightest galaxy outshines the rest of the core. The total luminosity of G 1 is weakly correlated with richness (at the same level as with Abell richness class). The luminosities of G 2 and G 3, however, exhibit a strong positive relationship with cluster richness. Surface photometry of ~ 2000 cluster members indicates that they may form the basis for a very powerful angular diameter (or luminosity) test for the deceleration parameter, but uncertainties in the seeing corrections and object selection effects must first be resolved. The evidence for dynamical evolution, while admittedly circumstantial, is nevertheless persuasive. The strong structure-luminosity relation and the frequency of multiple systems are strong arguments in favor of galactic cannibalism. A detailed spectroscopic and photometric study of a brightest cluster galaxy composed of nine nuclei, V Zw 311, indicates that dynamical friction can radically alter a galaxy in a time scale of only a billion years. The lack of strong luminosity-richness correlation is the most often <b>advanced</b> <b>objection</b> to the merger picture, but dynamical studies of rich systems are required before their capture rates can be calculated...|$|R
