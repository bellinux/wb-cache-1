25|$|In 1826 {{he began}} {{attending}} the Conservatoire to study composition under Jean-François Le Sueur and Anton Reicha. He also submitted a fugue to the Prix de Rome, but was eliminated {{in the primary}} round. Winning the prize would become an obsession until he finally won it in 1830, submitting a new cantata every year until he succeeded at his fourth attempt. The reason for this interest in the prize was not just <b>academic</b> <b>recognition.</b> The prize included a five-year pension – much needed income for the struggling composer. In 1827 he composed the Waverley overture after Walter Scott's Waverley novels. He also began working as a chorus singer at a vaudeville theatre to contribute towards an income. On 11 September of that year, he attended a production by a traveling English theatre company at the Odéon theatre with the Irish-born actress Harriet Smithson playing Ophelia and Juliet in the Shakespeare plays Hamlet and Romeo and Juliet. He immediately became infatuated with both actress and playwright. Prone to violent impulses, Berlioz began flooding Smithson's hotel room with love letters which both confused and terrified her.

500|$|Although {{seemingly}} at {{odds with}} each other, art and exploitation films are frequently treated as equal and interchangeable in cult fandom, listed alongside each other and described in similar terms: their ability to provoke a response. [...] The most exploitative aspects of art films are thus played up and their <b>academic</b> <b>recognition</b> ignored. [...] This flattening of culture follows the popularity of post-structuralism, which rejects a hierarchy of artistic merit and equates exploitation and art. [...] Mathijs and Sexton state that although cult films are not synonymous with exploitation, as is occasionally assumed, this is a key component; they write that exploitation, which exists {{on the fringes of}} the mainstream and deals with taboo subjects, is well-suited for cult followings. [...] Academic David Andrews writes that cult softcore films are [...] "the most masculinized, youth-oriented, populist, and openly pornographic softcore area." [...] The sexploitation films of Russ Meyer {{were among the first to}} abandon all hypocritical pretenses of morality and were technically proficient enough to gain a cult following. [...] His persistent vision saw him received as an auteur worthy of academic study; director John Waters attributes this to Meyer's ability to create complicated, sexually charged films without resorting to explicit sex. [...] Myrna Oliver described Doris Wishman's exploitation films as [...] "crass, coarse, and camp... perfect fodder for a cult following." [...] "Sick films", the most disturbing and graphically transgressive films, have their own distinct cult following; these films transcend their roots in exploitation, horror, and art films. [...] In 1960s and 1970s America, exploitation and art films shared audiences and marketing, especially in New York City's grindhouse cinemas.|$|E
