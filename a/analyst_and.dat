40|$|Several {{scholars}} {{have suggested that}} policy <b>analysts</b> <b>and</b> policy researchers can be classified as falling into one of {{a small number of}} ideal types. These ideal-type models are based largely on analysts' views of their roles in an organization and their value orientations, including their relationships with clients, their perceptions of their responsibility to the public, and their acceptance of professional norms. To determine to what extent practicing policy <b>analysts</b> <b>and</b> researchers resemble the ideal types, we administered Q-sorts to 38 <b>analysts</b> <b>and</b> researchers in three states. In our analysis of the Q-sorts, we identified five types. Also, we found that the <b>analysts</b> <b>and</b> researchers hold in common many views of analytic roles and values. ...|$|R

5|$|Ninety {{seconds after}} Wallace shoved Artest, most of both teams' {{players and coaches}} were huddled at midcourt, {{attempting}} to calm down Wallace (Tayshaun Prince was the only player on either team to not leave the bench during the entire incident; others became automatically eligible for one-game suspensions). While Artest {{was lying on the}} table, Wallace threw a towel at him, causing Artest to briefly stand up before being held back by coaches. A spectator, John Green, then threw a plastic cup of Diet Coke at Artest, hitting him in the chest. Artest jumped off the table, ran into the stands, and grabbed a man, Michael Ryan, who he mistakenly believed was responsible. Boyle stood up to try and hold back Artest and was trampled in the effort, suffering five fractured vertebrae and a gouge on his head. Jackson followed Artest into the stands and punched a fan, William Paulson, in the face in retaliation for the man throwing another drink in Artest's face while he was being restrained by other spectators. Pacers players Eddie Gill, David Harrison, Reggie Miller (who was not dressed for the game due to injury), Fred Jones, and Jamaal Tinsley, the Pistons' Rasheed Wallace, and numerous personnel (including Pistons radio <b>analyst</b> <b>and</b> former player Rick Mahorn) also quickly entered the stands to retrieve Artest and Jackson, and to break up the fighting. Green punched Artest twice in the head from behind, as did Ben Wallace's brother, David, to Jones. More fans then began throwing drinks and other objects, while a number of fans spilled out onto the court.|$|E

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2007. The accrual anomaly {{represents}} the positive abnormal returns {{generated by a}} trading strategy that seeks to exploit investors' failure to accurately forecast earnings when the accrual and cash components of earnings (earnings components) are differentially persistent. This dissertation investigates: (i) whether <b>analysts</b> <b>and</b> nonprofessional investors accurately forecast earnings when the earnings components are differentially persistent; and, (ii) a behavioral process {{that contributes to the}} accrual anomaly. I find that the earnings forecasts of <b>analysts</b> <b>and</b> nonprofessional investors are less accurate when the earnings components are differentially persistent relative to when the earnings components are equally persistent. Using cognitive load theory as a framework, I consider the effect of two hurdles (i. e., intrinsic and extraneous cognitive load) that investors need to overcome to accurately forecast earnings of firms with differentially persistent earnings components. I investigate how task decomposition and disclosure format combine to enable <b>analysts</b> <b>and</b> nonprofessional investors to overcome the cognitive load hurdles and more accurately forecast earnings when the earnings components are differentially persistent. I predict and find that the earnings forecasts of <b>analysts</b> <b>and</b> nonprofessional investors are only more accurate when <b>analysts</b> <b>and</b> nonprofessional investors attend to the earnings components and this information is disclosed in a format that minimizes their information processing costs...|$|R
