50|$|Another {{example is}} the {{introduction}} of the <b>air</b> <b>fence.</b> The <b>air</b> <b>fence</b> performs a function similar to the air bag in a commercial passenger vehicle, except that rather than inflating upon impact, it is pre-inflated. By acting as a softer, energy-absorbing barrier, air fences can be placed over hard obstacles around tracks that racers might encounter in the course of an accident. With an <b>air</b> <b>fence</b> in place the racer has a much better chance of sustaining fewer injuries than if he were to simply hit the object without any buffer. They are especially important (and more widely used) in motorcycle road racing.|$|E

50|$|To {{increase}} {{the safety of}} the riders, the Speedway Riders Association installed an <b>Air</b> <b>Fence</b> through turns one and two and three and four at Gillman Speedway by the start of the 2011-12 season. The Speedway Safety System Airfence, the most up-to-date and safest Speedway fence that is manufactured, consists of sixty six 3 x 1.2 panels that are 75 centimetres thick. Each panel consists of a foam frame and reinforced PVC cover. The <b>Air</b> <b>Fence</b> was installed at a cost in excess of A$100,000 with the money raised by the Speedway Riders' Association through sponsorship packages.|$|E

50|$|Because run-off {{areas and}} their {{associated}} safety devices (i.e. gravel traps, <b>air</b> <b>fences,</b> tire walls, etc.) are a primary safety feature of tracks, they hold enormous economic sway over the track, a consideration {{that is not}} lost on designers of new tracks and existing tracks' renovation projects.|$|R
50|$|Run-off {{areas are}} an {{important}} safety feature of modern motorsports parks and road courses. In fact, they are arguably {{the most important factor}} since they are the basis for several other safety features, such as gravel traps and <b>air</b> <b>fences,</b> which could not be placed anywhere or would be ineffective without a proper run-off area.|$|R

50|$|On 3 June 2016, with 25 {{minutes to}} go during Free Practice 2 for the 2016 Catalan Moto2 Grand Prix, Salom crashed at Europcar (turn 13), {{resulting}} in the session being red-flagged. The accident was not recorded by MotoGP cameras, but a security camera near turn 13 managed to capture video of the accident. His bike hit the <b>air</b> <b>fence</b> and bounced upwards, while Salom (who had {{let go of his}} bike) slid underneath resulting in him being directly in the crashing bike's path. Salom was rushed to Hospital General de Catalunya, where he died during surgery from injuries sustained in the crash.|$|E
50|$|Rowley Park Speedway {{operated}} {{in an era}} when safety wasn't the main concern of anyone involved. It wasn't until the early 1970s that safety roll cages for the open wheeled cars and seat belts became compulsory. Until the addition of the roll cage to the cars, Speedcar and TQ drivers, plus the bike riders, were most at risk of serious injury or death. If a Speedcar or TQ rolled, the driver was at risk as his or her head was usually well above the height of the rear roll bar. Also, until seat belts became compulsory in the 1970s, drivers often raced without a seat belt or nothing more than a lap sash, leading to drivers sometimes being thrown from their cars. and it wasn't until the late 1960s that fireproof racing suits became compulsory. Before then drivers often raced in overalls and some even raced in shorts and T-shirts!! Bike riders were at risk of hitting the safety fence with no protection but a crash helmet and leathers (no <b>Air</b> <b>Fence</b> in those days), as well as being run over by closely following bikes (or {{in the case of a}} tumbling sidecar, having the bike land on a fallen rider).|$|E
50|$|Safety {{requirements}} {{include the}} use of suspended wire <b>fences,</b> <b>air</b> <b>fences</b> and wooden <b>fences.</b> <b>Air</b> <b>fences</b> are made up of inflated panels installed on the bends. The fence is designed to dissipate energy by allowing an impacted area to compress and transfer air into the rest of the fence through blow-off valves or restriction ports connected to the other sections. They are mandatory for tracks in the British Elite League, Polish Ekstraliga, Speedway Grand Prix and Speedway World Cup. Neutral zones outside the track provide safe run-off areas for riders and their machinery to minimise the potential risk of injury to spectators. The majority of tracks are dedicated to speedway or other sports such as sidecar speedway and banger racing. For larger events, the FIM occasionally sanctions the use of stadiums that install temporary tracks such as the British Grand Prix held at the Millennium Stadium in Cardiff.|$|R
50|$|A second {{iteration}} of the Type R, dubbed NSX-R, {{was released}} in 2002, again exclusively in Japan. The NSX-R had a more aggressive rear spoiler and hood vent, featured a roof scoop, along with various refinements to reduce weight to 1270 kg. Under the body, panels and <b>air</b> <b>fences</b> in the front, along with a small rear diffuser, produced balanced downforce. These subtle changes along with its renowned handling kept the NSX-R competitive on the track against considerably higher-powered cars.|$|R

40|$|This summary {{describes}} the 9 March 1994 Thermal Infrared Multispectral Scanner (TIMS) airborne calibration experiment conducted at Castaic Lake, California. This experiment was {{a collaborative effort}} between the TIMS and Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) science teams at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL). TIMS was flown on the NASA/Ames Research Center C 130 with the new retractable <b>air</b> <b>fence</b> installed in the TIMS instrument bay. The purpose of this experiment {{was to determine if}} the fence would reduce the air turbulence in the TIMS instrument bay, thereby reducing the errors in calibration caused by wind-blast cooling of the blackbody reference sources internal to TIMS. Previous experiments have indicated that the wind blast effect could cause TIMS to over-estimate surface temperatures by more than 10 C. We have examined the TIMS data from twelve lines flown over Castaic Lake. Four of the lines were flown at an altitude of approximately 2. 5 km (MSL), four at an altitude of approximately 6. 7 km, and four at approximately 8. 3 km. At each altitude there were flights with northern and southern headings, with the aircraft level and at a positive pitch (nose-up attitude). The suite of twelve flights was designed to subject the TIMS/air fence system to different wind conditions and air temperatures. The TIMS flights were supported by a ground-truth team, who measured lake surface temperatures from a boat, and an atmosphere characterization team, who launched an airsonde and measured solar irradiance with a Reagan Sun Photometer. The Reagan measurements were used to construct a time-series of estimates of the total abundance of water vapor in the atmospheric column. These estimates were used to constrain modifications of the airsonde water vapor profile measurements made when processing the TIMS data with a customized version of the MODTRAN radiative transfer code...|$|E
50|$|In 1998, the EPA {{collected}} weekly data on VOCs {{going into}} and {{coming out of}} the incinerator. The <b>air</b> at the <b>fence</b> line was sampled weekly to verify that no VOCs were leaving the site. EPA turned off the system later in 1998, because the sampling program did not measure potential dioxin emissions. However, based on tests of similar systems used on other projects, it is believed that emissions of VOCs, dioxins, and other chemicals were low and did not pose an elevated threat to public health.|$|R

Jaghbub was a part of Egypt until December 1925, when it was ceded to Italy as part of a deal to fix the Egypt-Libya border. In February 1931, the Italian colonial administration led by Marshal Rodolfo Graziani decided to build a barbed-wire fence stretching from the Mediterranean port of Bardia to Jaghbub 270 km away. Supervised by armoured patrols and the <b>air</b> force, the <b>fence</b> sought to cut off the rebels from their supply sources and contacts with the Senussi leadership in Egypt. The construction of the fence began in April, 1931 and was completed in September. This, along with the deportation of almost the entire population of the Jebel Akhdar, was decisive and precipitated the end of the rebellion. The fence still runs along the Libyan-Egyptian border from near Tobruk, finishing at Jaghbub where the Great Sand Sea begins.|$|R

40|$|Out on {{the porch}} [...] . ” The very words bring to mind a mood, a feeling, {{an image of a}} place to relax and enjoy a cool breeze on a warm {{afternoon}} or evening, a place for reading, rocking, storytelling and sharing with family neighbors and friends. The porches in our lives hold vivid memories for fami-lies. Greetings and partings of family and friends take place there. For some, the porch becomes (at least in the “old-fashioned days”) an outdoor living room—a place to spend hours sitting and talking with family and friends. Nobody thought much about the front porch when most Americans had them and used them. The great American front porch was just there, open and sociable, an unassigned part of the house that belonged to everyone and no one, a place for family and friends to pass the time. Davida Rocklin “Perhaps more things were resolved on America’s front porches than in any other place, and yet so few are being used today, ” comments writer Gary Smalley. Today, tele-visions, computers, <b>air</b> conditioners, privacy <b>fences,</b> end-less activities, and busyness seem to keep people off their porches.

Porches can give a glimpse of the personality of a home and its owner. The entrance to the place you call home speaks volumes about who lives beyond the door. No matter how big or small your porch, it can call out a warm welcome to guests with a little creativity and planning. Dress it up for holidays and the changing seasons with a colorful doormat, a little paint, some pretty flowers, or furniture. Remember, it is your front porch, the place where you welcome others into your life...|$|R
30|$|The inter-generational {{transmission}} of traditional and local ecological knowledge {{for the prevention}} of dzud damage was low, since 88 % of the interviewees claimed that they had not acquired such knowledge about grazing, livestock management or specific protective actions against dzud from their parents or neighbours. However, the experiences {{in the wake of the}} 2009 / 10 dzud had increased herders’ appreciation of local ecological knowledge across ethnic groups and wealth strata. Some herders (n[*]=[*] 18) stated that they became aware of the importance of local ecological knowledge and related strategies after the last dzud, others (n[*]=[*] 14) confirmed that they rediscovered the significance of hay-making and hay-stocking and a third group (n[*]=[*] 11) had acquired basic skills of livestock management. Conversely, 26 respondents claimed not to engage in particular preventive actions against dzud, whereby there were no differences between male and female respondents (M 12, F 14) or between ethnic groups. Nevertheless, most herders (n[*]=[*] 40) stressed the importance of hay-making and hay-stocking to prepare for a dzud. Improving the animals’ winter pen, the wind-protection fences and reinforcing the manure layer on the pen floor were also mentioned as being important dzud preparation measures (n[*]=[*] 24). The respondents explained that about 1  m of dry animal manure needs to be piled up on the pen floor to protect the animals from the frozen terrain underneath. In addition, the pen floor needs to be cleaned every day and frozen urine patches have to be removed to keep the inside <b>air</b> warm. The <b>fence</b> around the pen and adjacent yard must be fixed and gaps filled with manure, wood or stones to keep off cold wind. These measures require dry manure from cattle and yak, stones and wood. Manure is difficult to obtain for many Sh and some Mh households, because of a limited number of cattle and lack of manpower for the related physical work. The acquisition of concentrate feed and nutritious forage was not viewed as a realistic coping strategy against dzud because of high costs. Nevertheless, all interviewees hoped to be supported in this way by the government in case of another harsh winter.|$|R
