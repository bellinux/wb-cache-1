50|$|Airborne {{pathogens}} or allergens often cause inflammation in the nose, throat, sinuses and the lungs.

40|$|An {{experimental}} model {{using an}} ex vivo perfused ventilated canine pulmonary lobe {{was used to}} study aspiration pneumonia. After intrabronchial acid instillation, the lobe weight tripled, <b>air</b> <b>way</b> pressure and pulmonary artery pressure doubled, and intrapulmonary shunting increased from 5. 5 % to 53. 4 %. If large quantities of albumin {{were added to the}} lobe perfusate 5 minutes after intrabronchial acid instillation, weight gain, <b>air</b> <b>way</b> and pulmonary artery pressure, and intrapulmonary shunting were unchanged from control levels. If large quantities of steroid were added to the lobe perfusate 5 minutes after intrabronchial acid instillation, the lobe weight doubled but <b>air</b> <b>way</b> pressure and pulmonary artery pressure, and intrapulmonary shunting were not significantly different from control values. It is surmised that intrapulmonary acid aspiration causes an immediate and marked changed in pulmonary capillary permeability. Albumin administration by counteracting this permeability change, and steroid administration by modifying the permeability change, are both beneficial following acid aspiration...|$|R

40|$|The human larynx is a {{versatile}} organ. Main functions are phonation, protection and {{regulation of the}} <b>air</b> <b>ways.</b> Patients suffer severely from the diagnosis of a laryngeal carcinoma of the stages T 3 and T 4. In most cases this diagnosis {{will lead to a}} total laryngectomy, which is usually dissatisfying in the sense of postoperative rehabilitation. The postoperative consequences include the loss of the native voice, the loss of regular <b>air</b> <b>ways</b> via mouth and nose, sense of smell, and the inability to build up an abdominal pressure. In this paper we focus on the feasibility of a modular larynx prosthesis which enables the laryngectomee to talk with his native voice, to breathe via the regular <b>air</b> <b>ways,</b> and to build up abdominal pressure. In particular we will give insights for a postoperative solution - a modular prosthesis based on a biomimetic self-regulating double clack-valve and on a voice reconstruction module, a so called vocoder. The vocoder is a device to reproduce the natural human voice. Most important for the use is an additional device required to analyze, conserve and manage voice characteristics of the patient before surgery. The self-regulating double clack-valve is designed to build up an abdominal pressure e. g. to cough. Therefore, our valve-system is working in both directions - a two-way valve system. By bridging the gap of the regular <b>air</b> <b>ways</b> lost by laryngectomy, the sense of smell and taste are restored. In the following we will present details and characteristics of these two main components required for a modular prosthesis of the larynx in laryngectomees...|$|R

40|$|Nd:YAG laser {{irradiation}} of 25 - 50 W {{is useful}} in the bronchoscopic treatment of central <b>air</b> <b>way</b> malignancies, but is associated with complications such as bleeding and perforation. In recent years, laser hyperthermia using low power Nd:YAG laser under 5 W was investigated or clinically applied in many fields due to its ability to heat a very restricted region effectively. An experimental study applying laser hyperthermia into bronchoscopic treatment of central <b>air</b> <b>way</b> malignancies was performed and results {{compared with those of}} high power Nd:YAG laser irradiation which is widely used. The following results were obtained: (1) Laser hyperthermia using 2. 5 W Nd:YAG laser produced a lower volume of defect and carbonization and a greater volume of coagulation in irradiated tissues than high power Nd:YAG laser irradiation with 25 W. (2) By repeatedly switching the power with the foot switch, it was possible to maintain the temperature between 42. 5 and 43. 5 degrees Centigrade 5 mm from the frosted probe during laser hyperthermia using 2. 5 W, 0. 5 sec-pulse mode. (3) In the investigation using resected Beagle trachea, pin-hole perforation was recognized at the site between cartilages after 1 minute of laser hyperthermia using 2. 5 W, 0. 5 sec-pulse mode. While at sites on the cartilage, defect of irradiated tissue was restricted within the cartilage, and there was no perforation detected. (4) Though laser hyperthermia using low power Nd:YAG laser is inferior to high power Nd:YAG laser irradiation with respect to immediate relief of <b>air</b> <b>way</b> stenosis, there are some advantages such as lower risk of bronchial perforation or bleeding, decreased smoke generated and deeper anti-tumor effect. Thus it is considered a promising method which is easily performed after minimum widening of the <b>air</b> <b>way</b> by high power Nd:YAG laser irradiation...|$|R
