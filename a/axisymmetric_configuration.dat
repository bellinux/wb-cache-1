40|$|International audienceThe {{equilibrium}} configuration of compound sessile drops has been calculated previously {{in the absence}} of gravity. Using the Laplace equations, we establish seven dimensionless parameters describing the <b>axisymmetric</b> <b>configuration</b> in the presence of gravity. The equilibrium <b>axisymmetric</b> <b>configuration</b> can be either stable or unstable depending on the fluid properties. A stability criterion is established by calculating forces on a perturbed Laplacian shape. In the zero Bond number limit, the stability criterion depends on the density ratio, two ratios of interfacial tensions, the volume ratio of the two drops, and the contact angle. We use Surface Evolver to examine the stability of compound sessile drops at small and large Bond numbers and compare with the zero Bond number approximation. Experimentally, we realize a stable axisymmetric compound sessile drop in air, where the buoyancy force exerted by the air is negligible. Finally, using a pair of fluids in which the density ratio can be tuned nearly independently of the interfacial tensions, the stability transition is verified for the <b>axisymmetric</b> <b>configuration.</b> Even though the perturbations are different for the theory, simulations and experiments, both simulations and experiments agree closely with the zero Bond number approximation, exhibiting a small discrepancy at large Bond number.

40|$|A new {{framework}} for analysing the gravitational fields in a stationary, <b>axisymmetric</b> <b>configuration</b> is introduced. The method {{is used to}} construct {{a complete set of}} field equations for the vacuum region outside a rotating source. These equations are underdetermined. Restricting the Weyl tensor to type D produces a set of equations which can be solved, and a range of new techniques are introduced to simplify the problem. Imposing the further condition that the solution is asymptotically flat yields the Kerr solution uniquely. The implications of this result for the no-hair theorem are discussed. The techniques developed here have many other applications, which are described in the conclusions. ...|$|E
