5|$|In 2010, the city's {{population}} included about 16percent {{under the}} age of 18 and about 12percent who were 65 years of age or older. Females accounted for 54percent of the total. Students at the university comprised <b>about</b> <b>a</b> <b>third</b> <b>of</b> the city's population.|$|E
50|$|The raw {{energy density}} of liquid ammonia is 11.5 MJ/L, which is <b>about</b> <b>a</b> <b>third</b> that <b>of</b> diesel. Although {{it can be}} used as a fuel, for a number of reasons this has never been common or widespread.|$|R
6000|$|Hereupon the Angel of the Odd {{replenished}} my goblet (which was <b>about</b> <b>a</b> <b>third</b> full <b>of</b> Port) with a colorless fluid that {{he poured}} {{from one of}} his hand bottles. I observed that these bottles had labels about their necks, and that these labels were inscribed [...] "Kirschenwasser." ...|$|R
50|$|Prior to the {{contract}} revision, {{the price was}} <b>about</b> <b>a</b> <b>third</b> that <b>of</b> <b>a</b> contemporary reactor, at just over $1 billion, reflecting {{the year of the}} original contract and that it was the first post-Soviet nuclear export order. Increased material costs and currency fluctuations had made completion at that price difficult.|$|R
5|$|Soviet {{composer}} Dmitri Shostakovich (1906–1975) {{completed his}} Symphony No. 7 on 27 December 1941 and dedicated {{it to his}} native Leningrad. At the time the city was about 16 weeks into its 900-day siege by Nazi German forces, which would kill <b>about</b> <b>a</b> <b>third</b> <b>of</b> the city's pre-war population.|$|E
5|$|The exact {{prevalence}} of obesity hypoventilation syndrome is unknown, and {{it is thought that}} many people with symptoms of OHS have not been diagnosed. <b>About</b> <b>a</b> <b>third</b> <b>of</b> all people with morbid obesity (a body mass index exceeding 40 kg/m2) have elevated carbon dioxide levels in the blood.|$|E
5|$|Ammianus {{reports that}} 6,000 Germans perished on the {{battlefield}} and in the pursuit on land. (Libanius gives a figure of 8,000). Thousands more drowned {{as they tried to}} get across the river. It is thus likely that <b>about</b> <b>a</b> <b>third</b> <b>of</b> the German force lost their lives. However, it appears that the majority escaped, including the eight reges alongside Chnodomar. The Romans lost just 243 men, including four tribuni (regimental commanders) of which two were commanders of cataphracti.|$|E
50|$|Most {{people with}} yellow nail {{syndrome}} (four fifths) have lymphedema; it is symmetrical and typically affects both legs. It {{is the first}} symptom of the condition in <b>about</b> <b>a</b> <b>third.</b> Involvement <b>of</b> the arms and face is more unusual, as is lymphedema of the abdomen with ascites (fluid collection in the abdominal cavity) and fluid collection around the heart.|$|R
60|$|P. 811. Burnet, {{speaking}} of the proposal to establish a regency, says:--The much greater part of the House of Lords was for this, and stuck long to it: And so was <b>about</b> <b>a</b> <b>third</b> part <b>of</b> the House of Commons. The greatest part of the clergy declared themselves for it.--Swift. And it was certainly much the best expedient.|$|R
50|$|The {{secondary}} HR 5171 Ab is {{a luminous}} yellow star with <b>a</b> radius <b>about</b> <b>a</b> <b>third</b> that <b>of</b> the primary star {{and an almost}} identical temperature. It is much less massive, estimated at only {{a tenth of the}} mass of the primary. Its exact properties can only be estimated from models since it is barely resolved from its larger companion and its spectrum cannot be distinguished.|$|R
5|$|Bread is a {{significant}} part of German cuisine and German bakeries produce about 600 main types of bread and 1,200 different types of pastries and rolls (Brötchen). German cheeses account for <b>about</b> <b>a</b> <b>third</b> <b>of</b> all cheese produced in Europe. In 2012 over 99% of all meat produced in Germany was either pork, chicken or beef. Germans produce their ubiquitous sausages in almost 1,500 varieties, including Bratwursts, Weisswursts, and Currywursts. In 2012, organic foods accounted for 3.9% of total food sales.|$|E
5|$|Bupropion is {{considered}} moderately dangerous in overdose. For significant overdoses, seizures {{have been reported}} in <b>about</b> <b>a</b> <b>third</b> <b>of</b> all cases; other serious effects include hallucinations, loss of consciousness, and abnormal heart rhythms. When bupropion was one of several kinds of pills taken in an overdose, fever, muscle rigidity, muscle damage, hypertension or hypotension, stupor, coma, and respiratory failure have been reported. While most people recover, some people have died, and before they died suffered multiple uncontrolled seizures and heart attacks.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} Hamnet was four, {{his father was}} already a London playwright and, as his {{popularity}} grew, he was probably not regularly at home in Stratford with his family. Honan believes that Hamnet may have completed Lower School, {{which would have been}} normal, before his death at the age of eleven (possibly from the Bubonic Plague). He was buried in Stratford on 11 August 1596. At that time in England <b>about</b> <b>a</b> <b>third</b> <b>of</b> all children died before age 10.|$|E
2500|$|Harvestmen are a scientifically {{neglected}} group. Description of new taxa {{has always}} been dependent on the activity of a few dedicated taxonomists. Carl Friedrich Roewer described <b>about</b> <b>a</b> <b>third</b> (2,260) <b>of</b> today's known species from the 1910s to the 1950s, and published the landmark systematic work Die Weberknechte der Erde (Harvestmen of the World) in 1923, with descriptions of all species known to that time. Other important taxonomists in this field include: ...|$|R
50|$|In 2008, the {{neighborhood}} had an estimated population of 6,197. According to the 2000 census, Windsor Square was highly diverse, with {{the percentage of}} Asian people being high for the county. The racial breakdown was 41.6% Asian, 37.7% white, 14.8% Latino, 4.3% black, and 1.6% other. <b>About</b> <b>a</b> <b>third</b> (33.5%) <b>of</b> the residents were born outside the United States, considered a high ratio for Los Angeles, the most common country being Korea at 57.7%.|$|R
50|$|Mary's {{three sons}} by the Earl seldom visited their mother, and never stayed long. However, two of Mary's {{daughter}}s {{lived with her}} - Lady Jessop, the Earl's daughter; and Mary Bowes, who was born during the term of Mary's second marriage. One of Mary's few joys was to see her daughter Mary learning to ride - at this time, riding brought great independence; journey times were <b>about</b> <b>a</b> <b>third</b> that <b>of</b> going by coach.|$|R
5|$|Citations for the Crimean War, {{particularly}} those in the first gazette of 24 February 1857, listed multiple actions for <b>about</b> <b>a</b> <b>third</b> <b>of</b> the recipients. The format of each citation varied between recipients, some specify the actual date, some {{the name of the}} battle and others have both sets of information.|$|E
5|$|Development {{continued}} as lots were sold southward to present day Oak Street, <b>about</b> <b>a</b> <b>third</b> <b>of</b> the way between Broadway and the House of Refuge. The principal road through the suburb {{at this time}} was Central Plank Road, which became Third Street. The emerging area was called the Southern Extension by this time. Growth south of Oak was very slow until the Southern Exposition was held annually in the area from 1883 to 1887.|$|E
5|$|Lead has no {{confirmed}} biological role. Its prevalence in {{the human}} body—at an adult average of 120mg—is nevertheless exceeded only by zinc (2500mg) and iron (4000mg) among the heavy metals. Lead salts are very efficiently absorbed by the body. A small amount of lead (1%) is stored in bones; the rest is excreted in urine and feces {{within a few weeks}} of exposure. Only <b>about</b> <b>a</b> <b>third</b> <b>of</b> lead is excreted by a child. Continual exposure may result in the bioaccumulation of lead.|$|E
2500|$|The raw {{energy density}} of liquid ammonia is 11.5 MJ/L, which is <b>about</b> <b>a</b> <b>third</b> that <b>of</b> diesel. Although {{it can be}} used as a fuel, for a number of reasons this has never been common or widespread. In {{addition}} to direct utilization of ammonia as a fuel in combustion engines there is also the opportunity to convert ammonia back to hydrogen where {{it can be used}} to power hydrogen fuel cells or it can be directly used within high temperature fuel cells.|$|R
5000|$|Implicit {{exceptions}} bring <b>about</b> <b>a</b> <b>third</b> type <b>of</b> {{value system}} called a formal value system. Whether idealized or realized, this type contains an implicit exception {{associated with each}} value: [...] "as long as no higher-priority value is violated". For instance, a person might feel that lying is wrong. Since preserving a life is probably more highly valued than adhering to the principle that lying is wrong, lying to save someone’s life is acceptable. Perhaps too simplistic in practice, such a hierarchical structure may warrant explicit exceptions.|$|R
5000|$|There is {{a notable}} {{difference}} between the opinion of scientists {{and that of the}} general public in the United States. A 2009 poll by Pew Research Center found that [...] "Nearly all scientists (97%) say humans and other living things have evolved over time - 87% say evolution is due to natural processes, such as natural selection. The dominant position among scientists - that living things have evolved due to natural processes - is shared by only <b>about</b> <b>a</b> <b>third</b> (32%) <b>of</b> the public." ...|$|R
5|$|Luftflotte 2 {{operated}} {{in support of}} Army Group Centre, commanded by Fedor von Bock, continuing the close working relationship between the two. Kesselring's mission was to gain air superiority, and if possible air supremacy, {{as soon as possible}} while still supporting ground operations. For this he had a fleet of over 1,000 aircraft, <b>about</b> <b>a</b> <b>third</b> <b>of</b> the Luftwaffes total strength.|$|E
5|$|Officials {{declared}} <b>about</b> <b>a</b> <b>third</b> <b>of</b> {{the state}} of Queensland as a disaster area following Cyclone Joy, directing state funds toward recovery efforts. The Queensland government provided monetary assistance to eligible families in the disaster zone and offered special loans to farmers affected by the storm. The federal government agreed to contribute 75%of overall relief costs. Following the cyclone's impacts in Australia, the name Joy was later retired by the World Meteorological Organization.|$|E
5|$|Overall {{prognosis}} {{is good in}} most patients, with one study showing recovery occurring in 94% and 89% of children and adults, respectively (some having needed treatment). In children under ten, the condition recurs in <b>about</b> <b>a</b> <b>third</b> <b>of</b> all cases and usually within {{the first four months}} after the initial attack. Recurrence is more common in older children and adults.|$|E
50|$|Chiron {{intends to}} create a next {{generation}} of The Lorica that is <b>about</b> <b>a</b> <b>third</b> the weight <b>of</b> the current generation. Once challenge the Chiron team faces is implementing edged weapons into its metrics. Blunted weapons are easily recorded in their anatomical metrics, whereas edged weapons will require further development.|$|R
5000|$|This {{plant is}} very similar to Erodium botrys and is often {{overlooked}} as such, but brachycarpum is a smaller plant overall. Flowers are <b>about</b> <b>a</b> <b>third</b> the size <b>of</b> botrys, and the style is smaller than 80 mm rather than larger. Minor differences exist in the seeds themselves, as well.|$|R
50|$|Following {{large-scale}} commercial whaling {{during the}} late 19th and 20th centuries, when over 255,000 whales were taken, the sei whale is now internationally protected, although limited hunting occurs under a controversial research program conducted by Japan. , its worldwide population was <b>about</b> 80,000, nearly <b>a</b> <b>third</b> <b>of</b> its prewhaling population.|$|R
5|$|Plantar {{fasciitis}} is {{a disorder}} {{that results in}} pain in the heel {{and bottom of the}} foot. The pain is usually most severe with the first steps of the day or following a period of rest. Pain is also frequently brought on by bending the foot and toes up towards the shin and may be worsened by a tight Achilles tendon. The condition typically comes on slowly. In <b>about</b> <b>a</b> <b>third</b> <b>of</b> people both legs are affected.|$|E
5|$|The Late Middle Ages {{was marked}} by {{difficulties}} and calamities including famine, plague, and war, which significantly diminished the population of Europe; between 1347 and 1350, the Black Death killed <b>about</b> <b>a</b> <b>third</b> <b>of</b> Europeans. Controversy, heresy, and the Western Schism within the Catholic Church paralleled the interstate conflict, civil strife, and peasant revolts {{that occurred in the}} kingdoms. Cultural and technological developments transformed European society, concluding the Late Middle Ages and beginning the early modern period.|$|E
5|$|The {{city has}} three {{sites on the}} National Register of Historic Places—Memorial Park Site, a {{significant}} pre-Columbian archaeological find; Heisey House, a Victorian-era museum; and Water Street District, an area {{with a mix of}} 19th- and 20th-century architecture. A levee, completed in 1995, protects the city from further flooding. While industry remains important to the city, <b>about</b> <b>a</b> <b>third</b> <b>of</b> Lock Haven's workforce is employed in education, health care, or social services.|$|E
50|$|Hobart Upjohn (1876-1949) was an American architect, {{best known}} for {{designing}} a number of ecclesiastical and educational structures in New York and in North Carolina. He also designed {{a number of significant}} private homes. His firm produced <b>a</b> total <b>of</b> <b>about</b> 150 projects, <b>a</b> <b>third</b> <b>of</b> which were in North Carolina.|$|R
50|$|According to the 1910 Austrian census results (Istria {{included}} here {{parts of}} the Karst and Liburnia which are not really part of Istria), out of 404,309 inhabitants in Istria, 168,116 (41.6%) spoke Croatian, 147,416 (36.5%) spoke Italian, 55,365 (13.7%) spoke Slovene, 13,279 (3.3%) spoke German, 882 (0.2%) spoke Romanian, 2,116 (0.5%) spoke other languages and 17,135 (4.2%) were non-citizens, which had not been asked for their language of communication. So, in the peninsula of Istria before World War I the Italians accounted for <b>about</b> <b>a</b> <b>third</b> (36.5%) <b>of</b> the local inhabitants.|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} {{it is argued}} that the:haracterization of {{mathematical}} justifications as inductive or deductive is incomplete. Promoting in classrooms the development <b>of</b> and discourse <b>about</b> <b>a</b> <b>third</b> type <b>of</b> reasoning, transformational reasoning, which considers the results of operations on a set of objects, may contribute to mathematics learning in significant ways. Topics discussed include: contrasting the presence and absence of transformational reasoning, defining transformational reasoning, transformational reasoning as a way of thinking, and implications.
