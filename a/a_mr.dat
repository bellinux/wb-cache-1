5|$|The first {{paper mill}} in Cullompton dates from 1729, with mills {{being set up}} near by at Hele and Higher Kensham in 1767, at Lower Kensahm c1788 and Langford c 1788.

Records show that the mill in Cullompton was owned by <b>a</b> <b>Mr</b> Simon Mills in 1757 and {{was taken over by}} <b>a</b> <b>Mr</b> Theodore Dart in 1799.

5|$|After a {{long period}} of {{remaining}} empty, the castle slowly began to decay, until in 1812, when Simon Temple, a local businessman, leased the castle from the Strathmores and made it habitable.

However, his failed business ventures prevented him from completing his work, and in 1819 the castle was lived in by <b>a</b> <b>Mr.</b> Thomas Wade.|$|E
40|$|<b>A</b> mixed-reality face (<b>MR</b> face) is <b>a</b> mosaic {{face with}} real and virtual facial parts, {{presented}} by overlaying a virtual facial part {{on a real}} face using mixed-reality techniques. An <b>MR</b> face is <b>an</b> effective means to improve communication in mixed-reality space by restoring the eye expressions lost when wearing HMDs. Photometric registration between the real and virtual parts is important because our eyes are very sensitive, even to small changes in human faces. However, efforts to achieve perfect 2 ̆ 7 physical 2 ̆ 7 photometric registration on <b>an</b> <b>MR</b> face are not feasible in <b>an</b> ordinary <b>MR</b> space. Therefore, {{it is essential to}} clarify the sensitivity of our eyes to the photometric inconsistencies on <b>an</b> <b>MR</b> face, and to concentrate on resolving them. In this paper, we first present the results of a systematic experiment that evaluated our sensitivity to the photometric inconsistencies on <b>an</b> <b>MR</b> face. Then, <b>a</b> technique to resolve the inconsistency and an experimental system to demonstrate the effectiveness of <b>an</b> <b>MR</b> face are described...|$|R
