5|$|Methylcyclopentadienyl {{manganese}} tricarbonyl (MMT) is {{a gasoline}} additive used to replace lead compounds for unleaded gasolines {{to improve the}} octane rating of low octane petroleum distillates. It reduces engine knock agent through {{the action of the}} carbonyl groups. Fuels containing manganese tend to form manganese carbides, which damage exhaust valves. The need for lead or manganese additives is merely historic because the modern reformation processes create fuels with increased octane ratings. Such fuels, directly or in mixture with non-reformed distillates, <b>are</b> <b>universal</b> in developed countries (0EU, Japan, etc.). In the USA, the imperative to provide the lowest price per volume on motor fuels and the lowest taxation rate, combined with lax legislation of fuel content before the year 2000, encouraged refineries to use MMT. Compared to 1953, levels of manganese in air have dropped. Many racing competitions specifically ban manganese compounds in racing fuel for carts and minibikes. MMT contains 24.4–25.2% manganese. Elevated atmospheric manganese concentrations are strongly correlated with automobile traffic density.|$|E

25|$|Within this framework, {{the goal}} of {{linguistics}} is to identify all of the principles and parameters that <b>are</b> <b>universal</b> to human language (called Universal Grammar).

This leads to continual refinement of the theoretical machinery of generative linguistics {{in an attempt to}} account for as much syntactic variation in human language as possible.|$|E
25|$|From a {{bottom-up}} perspective, happiness {{represents an}} accumulation of happy experiences. Bottom-up influences include external events, and broad situational and demographic factors, including health and marital status.

In support of this view, there is evidence that daily pleasurable events are associated with increased positive affect, and daily unpleasant events or hassles are associated with increased negative affect.|$|E

25|$|Vitamins {{can serve}} as {{precursors}} to many organic cofactors (e.g., vitamins B1, B2, B6, B12, niacin, folic acid) or as coenzymes themselves (e.g., vitamin C). However, vitamins do have other functions in the body. Many organic cofactors also contain a nucleotide, such as the electron carriers NAD and FAD, and coenzyme A, which carries acyl groups. Most of these cofactors are found in a huge variety of species, and some <b>are</b> <b>universal</b> to all forms of life. An exception to this wide distribution {{is a group of}} unique cofactors that evolved in methanogens, which are restricted to this group of archaea.|$|E
25|$|The {{construction}} of the group algebra for a given group {{is in many ways}} analogous to constructing the universal enveloping algebra for a given Lie algebra. Both constructions <b>are</b> <b>universal</b> and translate representation theory into module theory. Furthermore, both group algebras and universal enveloping algebras carry natural comultiplications which turn them into Hopf algebras. This is made precise in the article on the tensor algebra: the tensor algebra has a Hopf algebra structure on it, and because the Lie bracket is consistent with (obeys the consistency conditions for) that Hopf structure, it is inherited by the universal enveloping algebra.|$|E

In modern disposable pens, narrow plastic tubes contain the ink, which is compelled downward to the ball by gravity. Brass, steel, or tungsten carbide are used to manufacture the ball bearing-like points, then housed in a brass socket.|$|E
