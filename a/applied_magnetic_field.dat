25|$|Para{{magnetism}} {{is a form}} of magnetism whereby certain {{materials are}} weakly attracted by an externally <b>applied</b> <b>magnetic</b> <b>field,</b> and form internal, induced magnetic fields {{in the direction of the}} <b>applied</b> <b>magnetic</b> <b>field.</b> In contrast with this behavior, diamagnetic materials are repelled by magnetic fields and form induced magnetic fields in the direction opposite to that of the <b>applied</b> <b>magnetic</b> <b>field.</b> Paramagnetic materials include most chemical elements and some compounds; they have a relative magnetic permeability slightly greater than 1 (i.e., a small positive magnetic susceptibility) and hence are attracted to magnetic fields. The magnetic moment induced by the applied field is linear in the field strength and rather weak. It typically requires a sensitive analytical balance to detect the effect and modern measurements on paramagnetic materials are often conducted with a SQUID magnetometer.|$|E

25|$|Later {{on in his}} life, in 1862, Faraday used a {{spectroscope}} {{to search}} for a different alteration of light, the change of spectral lines by an <b>applied</b> <b>magnetic</b> <b>field.</b> The equipment available to him was, however, insufficient for a definite determination of spectral change. Pieter Zeeman later used an improved apparatus to study the same phenomenon, publishing his results in 1897 and receiving the 1902 Nobel Prize in Physics for his success.

25|$|As a {{consultant}} to the Physikalisch-Technische Reichsanstalt (PTR), Laue met Walther Meissner who was working there on superconductivity. Meissner had discovered that a weak magnetic field decays rapidly to zero in the interior of a superconductor, which is known as the Meissner effect. Laue showed in 1932 that the threshold of the <b>applied</b> <b>magnetic</b> <b>field</b> which destroys superconductivity varies with the shape of the body. Laue published a total of 12 papers and a book on superconductivity. One of the papers was co-authored with Fritz London and his brother Heinz. Meissner published a biography on Laue in 1960.|$|E

25|$|Hemozoin {{crystals}} have {{a distinct}} triclinic structure and are weakly magnetic. The difference between diamagnetic low-spin oxyhemoglobin and paramagnetic hemozoin {{can be used}} for isolation. They also exhibit optical dichroism, which means that they absorb light more strongly along their length than across their width, which allows the automated detection of malaria. Hemozoin is produced in a form that, under the action of an <b>applied</b> <b>magnetic</b> <b>field,</b> gives rise to an induced optical dichroism characteristic of the hemozoin concentration; and precise measurement of this induced dichroism may be used to determine the level of malarial infection.|$|E
25|$|A {{key feature}} of NMR {{is that the}} {{resonance}} frequency of a particular substance is directly proportional {{to the strength of}} the <b>applied</b> <b>magnetic</b> <b>field.</b> It is this feature that is exploited in imaging techniques; if a sample is placed in a non-uniform magnetic field then the resonance frequencies of the sample's nuclei depend on where in the field they are located. Since the resolution of the imaging technique depends on the magnitude of magnetic field gradient, many efforts are made to develop increased field strength, often using superconductors. The effectiveness of NMR can also be improved using hyperpolarization, and/or using two-dimensional, three-dimensional and higher-dimensional multi-frequency techniques.|$|E
25|$|Unlike ferromagnets, paramagnets do not retain any {{magnetization}} in {{the absence}} of an externally <b>applied</b> <b>magnetic</b> <b>field</b> because thermal motion randomizes the spin orientations. (Some paramagnetic materials retain spin disorder even at absolute zero, meaning they are paramagnetic in the ground state, i.e. {{in the absence}} of thermal motion.) Thus the total magnetization drops to zero when the applied field is removed. Even in the presence of the field there is only a small induced magnetization because only a small fraction of the spins will be oriented by the field. This fraction is proportional to the field strength and this explains the linear dependency. The attraction experienced by ferromagnetic materials is non-linear and much stronger, so that it is easily observed, for instance, in the attraction between a refrigerator magnet and the iron of the refrigerator itself.|$|E

40|$|Composite {{materials}} with large magnetoelectric effect are proposed for application in advanced near-room-temperature refrigeration.

25|$|Three {{studies in}} 1992 {{were the first}} to explore using the BOLD {{contrast}} in humans. Kenneth Kwong and colleagues, used a gradient-echo Echo Planar Imaging (EPI) sequence at a magnetic field strength of 1.5 T to study activation in the visual cortex. Ogawa and others conducted the study using a higher field (4.0 T) and showed that the BOLD signal depended on T2* loss of magnetization. T2* decay is caused by magnetized nuclei in a volume of space losing magnetic coherence (transverse magnetization) from both bumping into one another and from intentional differences in <b>applied</b> <b>magnetic</b> <b>field</b> strength across locations (field inhomogeneity from a spatial gradient). Bandettini and colleagues used EPI at 1.5 T to show activation in the primary motor cortex, a brain area at the last stage of the circuitry controlling voluntary movements. The magnetic fields, pulse sequences and procedures and techniques used by these early studies are still used in current-day fMRI studies. But today researchers typically collect data from more slices (using stronger magnetic gradients), and preprocess and analyze data using statistical techniques.|$|E
25|$|A {{superconductor}} {{with little}} or no magnetic field within it is said to be in the Meissner state. The Meissner state breaks down when the <b>applied</b> <b>magnetic</b> <b>field</b> is too large. Superconductors can be divided into two classes according to how this breakdown occurs. In Type I superconductors, superconductivity is abruptly destroyed when the strength of the applied field rises above a critical value Hc. Depending on the geometry of the sample, one may obtain an intermediate state consisting of a baroque pattern of regions of normal material carrying a magnetic field mixed with regions of superconducting material containing no field. In Type II superconductors, raising the applied field past a critical value H'c1 leads to a mixed state (also known as the vortex state) in which an increasing amount of magnetic flux penetrates the material, but there remains no resistance to the flow of electric current as long as the current is not too large. At a second critical field strength H'c2, superconductivity is destroyed. The mixed state is actually caused by vortices in the electronic superfluid, sometimes called fluxons because the flux carried by these vortices is quantized. Most pure elemental superconductors, except niobium and carbon nanotubes, are TypeI, while almost all impure and compound superconductors are TypeII.|$|E

40|$|The {{origin of}} the {{suppression}} of the longitudinal spin Seebeck effect by <b>applied</b> <b>magnetic</b> <b>fields</b> is studied.

We observe a decrease of the magnon accumulation with increasing <b>magnetic</b> <b>field</b> and we reveal that the origin of this effect is a field dependent change of the frequency distribution of the propagating magnons.
