5|$|Actinium-227 {{is used as}} {{a neutron}} source. Its high {{specific}} energy (14.5 W/g) and the possibility of obtaining significant quantities of thermally stable compounds are <b>attractive</b> <b>for</b> use in long-lasting thermoelectric generators for remote use. 228Ac {{is used as a}}n indicator of radioactivity in chemical research, as it emits high-energy electrons (2.18 MeV) that can be easily detected. 228Ac-228Ra mixtures are widely used as an intense gamma-source in industry and medicine.|$|E

5|$|Cerium-doped {{lanthanum}} bromide and {{lanthanum chloride}} are the recent inorganic scintillators, {{which have a}} combination of high light yield, best energy resolution, and fast response. Their high yield converts into superior energy resolution; moreover, the light output is very stable and quite high over a very wide range of temperatures, making it particularly <b>attractive</b> <b>for</b> high-temperature applications. These scintillators are already widely used commercially in detectors of neutrons or gamma rays.|$|E
5|$|Holmium-chromium-thulium triple-doped Yttrium {{aluminum}} garnet (Ho:Cr:Tm:YAG, or Ho,Cr,Tm:YAG) is {{an active}} laser medium material with high efficiency. It lases at 2097nm and is widely used in military applications, medicine, and meteorology. Single-element thulium-doped YAG (Tm:YAG) lasers operate between 1930 and 2040nm. The wavelength of thulium-based lasers is very efficient for superficial ablation of tissue, with minimal coagulation depth in air or in water. This makes thulium lasers <b>attractive</b> <b>for</b> laser-based surgery.|$|E
5|$|In the 1990s, forty {{prefabricated}} {{houses were}} built on adjacent {{land on a}} former holiday camp to rehouse residents {{of some of the}} most dilapidated properties. Despite winning several architectural awards and being praised by the local council, only five of the older properties were demolished. The original development along Brooklands has faced demolition, particularly with respect to dilapidated properties, and vacant sites nearby have been purchased to provide new homes. New permanent residences in Brooklands are prohibited by council regulations. Tendring District Council hope that by 2026, the area will change sufficiently to be <b>attractive</b> <b>for</b> development, and to provide a self-sufficient service based economy for tourism.|$|E

5|$|Many fungi {{can serve}} as source of food for insect larvae, whereas most insects eat fungi only occasionally. Still, {{a whole range of}} insect species {{specialize}} on fungi. These animals are mainly beetle larvae, especially hairy fungus beetles (Mycetophagidae), rove beetles (Staphylinidae), and true flies (Diptera). Milk caps are especially <b>attractive</b> <b>for</b> true flies, while beetle larvae are comparatively rarer. The most common insects found on the fungus are Mycetophilidae and Phoridae larvae, which populate even the youngest fruit bodies. Also relatively common on mature or overaged fruit bodies are Drosophilidae and Psychodidae. Species from the section Deliciosi are often infested by Diptera larvae.|$|E
5|$|Niobium is {{slightly}} less electropositive and more compact {{than its predecessor}} in the periodic table, zirconium, whereas it is virtually identical in size to the heavier tantalum atoms, {{as a result of}} the lanthanide contraction. As a result, niobium's chemical properties are very similar to those for tantalum, which appears directly below niobium in the periodic table. Although its corrosion resistance is not as outstanding as that of tantalum, the lower price and greater availability make niobium <b>attractive</b> <b>for</b> less demanding applications, such as vat linings in chemical plants.|$|E
5|$|The {{shoreline}} {{was still}} at a higher altitude than today, with the Sisimiut valley east of the Kangerluarsunnguaq Bay, partially under sea. Many artifacts and graves from the several centuries of permanent settlement remain scattered in the region. Rich in fauna, the coastal region from Sisimiut to Kangaamiut was particularly <b>attractive</b> <b>for</b> migrants, and due to {{a large number of}} historical artifacts it is currently listed as a candidate for the UNESCO World Heritage Site, with the application received in 2003.|$|E

5|$|In general, humans {{consider}} woodpeckers in a favourable light; {{they are}} viewed as interesting birds and fascinating to watch as they drum or forage. However, their activities are not universally appreciated. Some individual birds habitually excavate holes in buildings, fencing and utility poles, and there are various reverberatory structures on buildings such as gutters, downspouts, chimneys, vents and aluminium sheeting, that the birds find <b>attractive</b> <b>for</b> drumming. Houses with shingles or wooden boarding are also attractive as possible nesting or roosting sites, especially when close to large trees or woodland. Several exploratory holes may be made, especially at the junctions of vertical boards or {{at the corners of}} tongue-and-groove boarding. The birds may also drill holes in houses as they forage for insect larvae and pupae hidden behind the woodwork.|$|E
5|$|The Liberian open registry, {{founded in}} 1948, was {{the brainchild of}} Edward Stettinius, who had been Franklin D. Roosevelt's Secretary of State during World War II. Stettinius created a {{corporate}} structure that included The Liberia Corporation, a joint-venture with the government of Liberia. The corporation was structured so that one-fourth of its revenue would go to the Liberian government, another 10% went to fund social programs in Liberia, and the remainder returned to Stettinius' corporation. The Liberian registry was created at a time when Panama's registry was becoming less <b>attractive</b> <b>for</b> several reasons including its unpopularity with the U.S. labor movement and European shipping concerns, political unrest in Panama, and increases in its fees and regulations.|$|E
5|$|With the Coinage Act of 1873, {{the dollar}} {{was no longer}} {{equivalent}} to a set amount of silver, a statutory change made so that {{as the price of}} silver dropped with increased U.S. production, mining companies could not present their bullion at the mints and receive it back, struck into silver dollars worth more as money than they were as metal. By the post-World War II era, the Bureau of the Mint was striking the three remaining precious metal coins, the dime, quarter and half dollar in 90 percent silver—the dollar had not been coined since 1935 and circulated little outside some Western states like Nevada and Montana. The metal in a silver dollar was worth more as bullion than as money above $1.2929 per troy ounce; the smaller coins would be <b>attractive</b> <b>for</b> the melting pot above $1.38 per ounce.|$|E

5|$|For Rhodes, throffers can {{not merely}} be {{biconditional}} proposals. If Q proposes that P pay $10,000 so that Q withholds {{information that would}} lead to Ps arrest, then {{despite the fact that the}} proposal is biconditional (that is, P may choose to pay or not pay, which would lead to different outcomes) it is not a throffer. This is because choosing to pay cannot be considered <b>attractive</b> <b>for</b> P independent of Qs proposal. Ps paying of Q does not lead to the satisfaction of an attainment-want, which is a necessary condition for a proposal's being an offer under Rhodes's account. The exception to this is when an agent offers to help another overcome a background threat (a threat that was not introduced by the proposal). Biconditionals, in addition to either threats or offers, may contain neutral proposals, and so not be throffers. The possibility of another agent's not acting is necessarily neutral. Throffers are those biconditional proposals that contain both a threat and an offer, as opposed to biconditional proposals containing a threat and neutral proposal, or an offer and a neutral proposal. In the case of throffers, it is always going to be difficult or even impossible to determine whether an agent acts on the threatening aspect of the proposal or the offer.|$|E
