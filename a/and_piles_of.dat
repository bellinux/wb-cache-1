5|$|In those years, Gaddafi's support {{had been}} mostly moral, {{with only a}} limited supply of weapons. All this started {{changing}} in February 1977, when the Libyans provided Oueddei's men with hundreds of AK-47 assault rifles, dozens of RPGs, 81 and 82mm mortars and recoilless cannons. Armed with these weapons, the FAP attacked in June the Chadian Armed Forces' (FAT) strongholds of Bardaï and Zouar in Tibesti and of Ounianga Kébir in Borkou. Oueddei took full control of the Tibesti with this attack after Bardaï, besieged since 22 June, surrendered on 4 July, while Zouar was evacuated. The FAT lost 300 men, <b>and</b> <b>piles</b> <b>of</b> military supplies fell {{into the hands of}} the rebels.

40|$|Pile {{foundations}} are slender {{structural elements}} used to transfer loads from super structure into deep hard strata below the ground level. However, single piles are rarely found in practice. It is quite complicated to analyze pile groups since pile soil interaction is complex. In this study, {{two dimensional analysis}} <b>of</b> <b>pile</b> group under vertical load is carried out using finite element software ANSYS. Pile group has 16 numbers <b>of</b> <b>piles</b> <b>and</b> it is located in c-ø soil, parameters like diameter (0. 2, 0. 3, 0. 4, 0. 5, 0. 6, 0. 7, 0. 8 m), length (3, 4, 5, 6 m) <b>and</b> spacing <b>of</b> <b>piles</b> (2 D, 2. 5 D, 3 D, 3. 5 D, 4 D) <b>and</b> thickness <b>of</b> <b>pile</b> cap (0. 2, 0. 4, 0. 6, 0. 8, 1. 0, 1. 2, 1. 4 m) are varied to study the behavior <b>of</b> <b>pile</b> group. Results <b>of</b> influence of diameter, length <b>and</b> spacing <b>of</b> <b>piles</b> <b>and</b> thickness <b>of</b> <b>pile</b> cap are discussed. It can be observed that, as the diameter <b>and</b> spacing <b>of</b> <b>piles</b> <b>and</b> thickness <b>of</b> <b>pile</b> cap increase, the load carrying capacity <b>of</b> <b>pile</b> group increases.

5|$|Before Eline struck Mozambique, storm {{warnings}} and later hurricane warnings were issued on February21. Flooding had affected the nation since January, with some areas receiving a year's worth of rainfall in two weeks. Widespread areas were inundated, with about 220,000people displaced, and about 150people killed. Eline moved ashore with very powerful winds, {{although there were}} no direct observations of the strongest winds. In Beira, the closest major city to the landfall point, winds reached storm force. However, the rainfall from Eline was the most impacting following the preexisting flooding, which were the worst since 1951. The floods were beginning to recede by the time Eline arrived, {{and by the end}} of February 2000, the situation was considered the country's worst natural disaster in a century. Flooding continued for days after Eline moved through southern Africa due to waters flowing downstream from neighboring countries. By early March the floods were beginning to recede again, leaving behind a deep layer of mud, ponds of contaminated water, <b>and</b> <b>piles</b> <b>of</b> rotten corpses.|$|E
5|$|The {{relief efforts}} were {{hindered}} by {{the composition of}} the mud, which made it nearly impossible to move through without becoming stuck. By the time relief workers reached Armero twelve hours after the eruption, many of the victims with serious injuries were dead. The relief workers were horrified by the landscape of fallen trees, disfigured human bodies, <b>and</b> <b>piles</b> <b>of</b> debris from entire houses. This was the second-deadliest volcanic disaster of the 20th century, surpassed only by the 1902 eruption of Mount Pelée, and is the fourth-deadliest volcanic event recorded since 1500 AD. The event was a foreseeable catastrophe exacerbated by the populace's unawareness of the volcano's destructive history; geologists and other experts had warned authorities and media outlets about the danger over the weeks and {{days leading up to the}} eruption. Hazard maps for the vicinity were prepared, but poorly distributed. On the day of the eruption, several evacuation attempts were made, but a severe storm restricted communications. Many victims stayed in their houses as they had been instructed, believing that the eruption had ended. The noise from the storm may have prevented many from hearing the sounds from Ruiz until it was too late.|$|E

25|$|The rapid {{industrialization}} of Russia also {{resulted in}} urban overcrowding and poor conditions for urban industrial workers (as mentioned above). Between 1890 and 1910, {{the population of the}} capital, Saint Petersburg, swelled from 1,033,600 to 1,905,600, with Moscow experiencing similar growth. This created a new 'proletariat' which, due to being crowded together in the cities, was much more likely to protest and go on strike than the peasantry had been in previous times. In one 1904 survey, it was found that an average of sixteen people shared each apartment in Saint Petersburg, with six people per room. There was also no running water, <b>and</b> <b>piles</b> <b>of</b> human waste were a threat {{to the health of the}} workers. The poor conditions only aggravated the situation, with the number of strikes and incidents of public disorder rapidly increasing in the years shortly before World War I. Because of late industrialization, Russia's workers were highly concentrated. By 1914, 40% of Russian workers were employed in factories of 1,000+ workers (32% in 1901). 42% worked in 100–1,000 worker enterprises, 18% in 1–100 worker businesses (in the USA, 1914, the figures were 18, 47 and 35 respectively).|$|E

500|$|On June 3, 1917, {{the first}} portion of the Broadway–Seventh Avenue Line south of Times Square–42nd Street, a shuttle to 34th Street–Penn Station, opened; a {{separate}} shuttle service, running between 42nd and 34th Streets, was created. This short extension was opened even though {{the rest of the}} route was not yet completed in order to handle the mass of traffic to and from Pennsylvania Station. Only {{the northern part of the}} station was opened at this time, <b>and</b> <b>piles</b> <b>of</b> plaster, rails, and debris could be seen on the rest of the platforms. This shuttle was extended south to South Ferry, with a shorter shuttle on the Brooklyn branch between Chambers Street and Wall Street, on July 1, 1918. The new [...] "H" [...] system was implemented on August 1, 1918, joining the two halves of the Broadway–Seventh Avenue Line and sending all West Side trains south from Times Square.

500|$|In 629 Tikal {{had founded}} Dos Pilas in the Petexbatún region, some [...] to its southwest, as a {{military}} outpost {{in order to control}} trade along the course of the Pasión River. B'alaj Chan K'awiil was installed on the throne of the new outpost at the age of four, in 635, and for many years served as a loyal vassal fighting for his brother, the king of Tikal. In AD 648 Calakmul attacked Dos Pilas and gained an overwhelming victory that included the death of a Tikal lord. B'alaj Chan K'awiil was captured by Yuknoom Che'en II but, instead of being sacrificed, he was re-instated on his throne as a vassal of the Calakmul king, and went on to attack Tikal in 657, forcing Nuun Ujol Chaak, the then king of Tikal, to temporarily abandon the city. The first two rulers of Dos Pilas continued to use the Mutal emblem glyph of Tikal, and they probably felt that they had a legitimate claim to the throne of Tikal itself. For some reason, B'alaj Chan K'awiil was not installed as the new ruler of Tikal; instead he stayed at Dos Pilas. Tikal counterattacked against Dos Pilas in 672, driving B'alaj Chan K'awiil into an exile that lasted five years. Calakmul tried to encircle Tikal within an area dominated by its allies, such as El Peru, Dos Pilas and Caracol. In 677 Calakmul counterattacked against Dos Pilas, driving Tikal out and reinstalled B'alaj Chan K'awiil on his throne. In 679 Dos Pilas, probably aided by Calakmul, gained an important victory over Tikal, with a hieroglyphic description of the battle describing pools of blood <b>and</b> <b>piles</b> <b>of</b> heads.|$|E
500|$|Throughout North Carolina, the 1827 {{hurricane}} {{was considered}} {{more severe than}} a similar-tracked cyclone that impacted the region 12 years prior. In the city of Wilmington, a few buildings saw their chimneys destroyed, roofs ripped off, and fences flattened. One resident recounted that waves washed above garden fences up to [...] inland, while other reports suggested that storm tides surpassed [...] above normal levels. Less than a dozen vessels were driven ashore {{along the banks of}} the Cape Fear River. Outside the city, the hurricane widened the Masonboro Sound by at least [...] and destroyed several of the accompanied saltworks. Fayetteville recorded a 30-hour period of gales and rain, where an abundant corn crop sustained insignificant loss. The cotton and tobacco crops did not fare so well, and many roads were rendered impassible by fallen trees or high water. Raleigh, meanwhile, saw many of its water courses flooded, mills and bridges carried off, and trees and chimneys downed. Corn and cotton crops were in some cases torn to pieces, <b>and</b> <b>piles</b> <b>of</b> wheat which had been stacked in fields were swept downstream. In Bethabara, or modern-day Winston–Salem, the hurricane's onslaught downed fences, tore off roofs, and damaged orchards and forests. Several bridges were swept away by floodwaters, and numerous washed-out roadways impeded travel for weeks following the storm's passage. In Washington, floodwaters rose to as much as [...] in the first floor of houses along Water Street, while storm tides exceeded [...] One schooner was driven aground causing damage to a wharf while several others combined to dislodge and carry away a bridge.
