5|$|In the 1970s, {{when the}} New York City Subway was at <b>an</b> <b>all-time</b> <b>low,</b> {{following}} the general trend of {{a decrease in}} ridership, the amount of passengers using the Union Turnpike station decreased by 2,700,000 passengers. As part of the MTA's 1975–1981 transit program, station lighting at Kew Gardens was improved. In 1981, the MTA listed the station among the 69 most deteriorated stations in the subway system.|$|E
5|$|By the 1970s and 1980s, the New York City Subway was at <b>an</b> <b>all-time</b> <b>low.</b> Ridership {{had dropped}} to 1910s levels, and {{graffiti}} and crime were rampant on the subway; in general, the subway was very poorly maintained during that time, and delays and track problems were common. Still, the NYCTA managed to open six new subway stations in the 1980s, make the current fleet of subway cars graffiti-free, as well as order 1,775 new subway cars. By the early 1990s, conditions had improved significantly, although maintenance backlogs accumulated during those 20 years are still being fixed today.|$|E
5|$|Following the First World War, it surged in {{popularity}} and {{was associated with}} Hollywood stars {{and members of the}} British Royal Family. Its numbers have dropped significantly since then, with the breed listed as a Vulnerable Native Breed by the Kennel Club; <b>an</b> <b>all-time</b> <b>low</b> was recorded in 2008 when only 43 puppies were registered in the United Kingdom. This decline has been blamed on an influx of foreign and designer breeds, and the Sealyham's reduced usefulness as a working dog.|$|E

5|$|In mid-1932, {{after nine}} pictures, Tracy {{remained}} virtually {{unknown to the}} public. He considered leaving Fox once his contract was up for renewal, but a rise in his weekly rate to $1,500 convinced him to stay. He continued to appear in unpopular films, with Me and My Gal (1932) setting <b>an</b> <b>all-time</b> <b>low</b> attendance record for the Roxy Theatre in New York City. He was loaned to Warner Bros. for 20,000 Years in Sing Sing (1932), a prison drama co-starring Bette Davis. Tracy was hopeful {{that it would be}} his break-out role, but despite good reviews this failed to materialize.|$|E
5|$|Over {{the course}} of the tour with Dashboard Confessional, {{relationships}} between the band members continued to decline. The band's live shows had deteriorated, and Rob and Suptic had both threatened to quit multiple times. Matt Pryor's wife had recently given birth to their first child, and being away from his family had made him irritable and standoffish. After the Honda Civic tour ended, the band embarked on their world tour, including stops throughout Europe, Japan and Australia. However, their live performance hit <b>an</b> <b>all-time</b> <b>low,</b> with Pryor at times refusing to even sing large portions of songs.|$|E
5|$|The {{number of}} {{competing}} athletes for Djibouti was at <b>an</b> <b>all-time</b> <b>low</b> for the 2000 Olympic Games. The first woman athlete for Djibouti debuted at these games, {{competing in the}} 800 m. She set the record for Djibouti's youngest Olympian at an age of 16 years and 62 days. Wais finished last in her heat, 24.15 seconds behind the next competitor. The only other competitor was Omar Daher Gadid, who competed in the marathon and did not finish the race.|$|E

50|$|In 1984, {{with the}} company in bankruptcy, the loss was less severe {{than it had been}} the prior year, at only US$25 million, {{excluding}} extraordinary income of US$6 million. However, the stock price set <b>a</b> new <b>all-time</b> <b>low</b> again that year, and began trading as a penny stock (under $1), down another 23% from its 1983 low.|$|R
50|$|Chicago set <b>an</b> <b>all-time</b> NBA record <b>low</b> for {{points in}} the shot clock era in a 82-49 loss to the Heat. Kornel David led Chicago with 13 points. Later in the season Chicago beat Miami 101-86.|$|R
5|$|By 1918, {{civilian}} morale in occupied Belgium reached <b>an</b> <b>all-time</b> <b>low.</b> The early {{successes of}} the Ludendorff Offensive {{in the spring of}} 1918 were believed to have made liberation virtually impossible in the foreseeable future. However, during the Hundred Days Offensive, the Allied and Belgian armies launched a series of successful offensives on the Western Front. The Belgian army, restricted to the Yser salient since 1914, advanced as far as Bruges. German forces on the front in Belgium launched a wide retreat. On 11 November 1918, the German army signed an armistice. The ceasefire did not, however, lead to the immediate liberation of Belgium and sporadic fighting continued. The Belgian army gradually advanced into the country, behind the evacuating German occupying force.|$|E
5|$|By 1987 Pittston Coal {{had dropped}} {{from being the}} seventh largest coal {{operator}} in the United States to the 15th, and coal production was at <b>an</b> <b>all-time</b> <b>low.</b> The Pittston Coal Company had worked with the Bituminous Coal Operators (BCOA), which regulated health and retirement benefits offered to Pittston workers. The Pittston mines continued to lose money, though, and in 1987 the Pittston Coal Company terminated its contract with the BCOA to establish its own health and retirement benefit contract with the UMWA. Through collective bargaining, the UMWA and the Pittston Coal Company established two different retirement plans for the miners: one for those who retired before 1974 and one for those who retired after 1974, {{in the hopes that}} this would help the company gain a profit.|$|E
5|$|JG 27 {{was moved}} out of Africa {{for about a month}} because of the impact Marseille's death had on morale. The deaths of two other German aces, Günter Steinhausen and Marseille's friend Hans-Arnold Stahlschmidt, just three weeks earlier reduced spirits to <b>an</b> <b>all-time</b> <b>low.</b> One biographer {{suggests}} these consequences were instigated by a failure in the command style of Marseille, although it was not entirely within his control. The more success Marseille had, the more his staffel relied on him to carry the greater share of aerial victories claimed by the unit. So his death, when it came, was something which JG 27 had seemingly not prepared for.|$|E
5000|$|In 2010, HSBC {{was rated}} {{the worst in}} {{customer}} advocacy by Forrester Research, which asked bank customers to rank their banks.

50|$|The 1978-79 St. Louis Blues {{season was}} the 12th for the {{franchise}} in St. Louis, Missouri. The Blues finished {{the season with}} a record of just 18 wins (a franchise low), 50 losses and just 12 ties, for <b>an</b> <b>all-time</b> franchise <b>low</b> of 48 points. The Blues finished out of the playoffs for the second straight season, and the last time before the 2005-06 season, following the lockout.|$|R
50|$|Oblak {{signed for}} Portuguese club Benfica {{at the age}} of 17, and was part of the team that won the {{domestic}} treble in the 2013-14 season. He then moved to Atlético Madrid for a fee of €16 million, becoming La Liga's most expensive goalkeeper of all time. In 2015-16 he won the Ricardo Zamora Trophy for best goalkeeper, conceding <b>an</b> <b>all-time</b> record <b>low</b> of 18 goals. He won the award again the following season.|$|R
5|$|The main {{shopping}} centre in Sale, the Square Shopping Centre, {{was constructed in}} the 1960s. Following the Trafford Centre's opening in 1998, {{it was expected that}} the centre would suffer, but it has since prospered. In 2003 the Square Shopping Centre underwent a £7million refurbishment, {{a major part of the}} redevelopment of Sale's town centre. It was sold for £40M in 2005, by which time the Square had experienced an increase in trade and demand for tenancy that had led to an increase of 70% in rental income. The town's economy expanded to the extent that in 2007, at a time when the rest of south Manchester was oversupplied with office space, Sale's available office and commercial space was at <b>an</b> <b>all-time</b> <b>low</b> because of high demand.|$|E
5|$|The {{team has}} not {{qualified}} {{for a major}} competition since 1998. German coach Berti Vogts became the first foreign manager of the team in 2002, but his time in charge was generally seen as a failure and the FIFA World Ranking declined to <b>an</b> <b>all-time</b> <b>low</b> of 88 in March 2005. Walter Smith and Alex McLeish achieved better results, with the ranking improving to an all-time high of 13 in October 2007, but both were only briefly in charge before returning to club management. George Burley and Craig Levein both had worse results with the team and were eventually sacked. Results improved somewhat under Gordon Strachan, but {{he was unable to}} secure qualification for a tournament.|$|E
5|$|On its formation, the Association of Masters of Harriers and Beagles {{took over}} the running of a regular show at Peterborough that had started in 1889, and the Beagle Club in the UK held its first show in 1896. The regular showing of the breed led to the {{development}} of a uniform type, and the beagle continued to prove a success up until the outbreak of World War I when all shows were suspended. After the war, the breed was again struggling for survival in the UK: the last of the Pocket Beagles was probably lost during this time, and registrations fell to <b>an</b> <b>all-time</b> <b>low.</b> A few breeders (notably Reynalton Kennels) managed to revive interest in the dog and by World War II, the breed was once again doing well. Registrations dropped again after the end of the war but almost immediately recovered.|$|E
5000|$|On March 10, 1981, CDCP won {{its first}} game of the season, 95-69, {{limiting}} Presto to <b>an</b> <b>all-time</b> <b>lowest</b> output of 69 points. After seven games in the elimination round, Lister was replaced by the returning NBA veteran Jeff Wilkins. [...] The Road Builders were contending for one of the four semifinals berth and were a game behind Toyota with one scheduled assignment left, but the Super Diesels won their last game against Finance Funders to join U-Tex, San Miguel and Crispa in the semifinal round, thereby eliminating the Road Builders. In the Reinforced Filipino Conference, CDCP paraded Ronald McCoy as their import, the Road Builders again fell short to advance into the next round, they won their last game against Presto Fun Drinks on October 8 for a 4-5 won-loss card but failed to create a tie with Tefilin, which secured the 6th and last spot in the round of six quarterfinals berth by winning over San Miguel Beer two nights later.|$|R
50|$|Eight games {{without a}} win ensured relegation by just two points, and amid {{news of a}} 25,000 all-seater stadium {{development}} along the Avenue of Remembrance came the stark reality of <b>a</b> new <b>all-time</b> <b>lowest</b> attendance of 1,430 at the final day win over Carlisle and the season's average of just 2,641. Roberts was given {{a vote of confidence}} despite relegation. The Council refused the new stadium plans and re-iterated their covenant on Layer Road that prevented any activity other than football.|$|R
50|$|A {{leadership}} {{election was}} held on 18 March 2012 in the Panhellenic Socialist Movement (PASOK), Greece's main centre-left party. The leadership election came after the resignation of PM George Papandreou on 11 November 2011 {{as part of the}} Greek government debt crisis and before the early election expected in April or May 2012. Due to strongly rising resistance against the two main parties (PASOK and New Democracy, the main conservative party), PASOK's ratings in opinion polls were at <b>an</b> unprecedented <b>all-time</b> <b>low</b> point, barely above 10%.|$|R
5|$|With every {{subsequent}} improvement made to {{the ground}} since the Second World War, the capacity steadily declined. By the 1980s, the capacity had dropped from the original 80,000 to approximately 60,000. The capacity dropped still further in 1990, when the Taylor Report recommended, and the government demanded that all First and Second Division stadia be converted to all-seaters. This meant that £3–5million plans to replace the Stretford End with a brand new stand with an all-standing terrace at the front and a cantilever roof to link {{with the rest of}} the ground had to be drastically altered. This forced redevelopment, including the removal of the terraces at the front of the other three stands, not only increased the cost to around £10million, but also reduced the capacity of Old Trafford to <b>an</b> <b>all-time</b> <b>low</b> of around 44,000. In addition, the club was told in 1992 that they would only receive £1.4million of a possible £2million from the Football Trust to be put towards work related to the Taylor Report.|$|E
5|$|However, the {{financial}} crisis of 2007–08 ended this period of stability, and, on 16 April 2007, the governor (at that time Mervyn King), was obliged to write the first MPC open letter to the chancellor (Gordon Brown), explaining why the inflation had deviated from the target of 2% per year {{by more than one}} percentage point (3.1%). By February 2013, he had had to write 14 such letters to chancellors. Between October 2008 and March 2009 the base rate was cut six times to <b>an</b> <b>all-time</b> <b>low</b> of 0.5% in order to avoid deflation and spur growth. In March 2009, the MPC launched a programme of quantitative easing, initially injecting £75 billion into the economy. By March 2010, it had also increased the amount of money set aside for quantitative easing to £200 billion, a figure later increased by a further £75 billion in the months following October 2011. The MPC announced two further £50 billion rounds of quantitative easing in February and July 2012, bringing the total to £375 billion whilst simultaneously keeping the base rate at 0.5%. In March 2013, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, George Osborne, called on the MPC to follow its American counterpart (the Federal Reserve Board) in committing itself to keeping interest rates low for a prolonged period of time via appropriate forward guidance, which it did on 7 August.|$|E
5|$|The opening {{game of the}} new {{stands on}} 3 May 1962 was a Rosenborg {{friendly}} against Dunfermline Athletic. Freidig moved to Eberg idrettsanlegg when it was completed ahead of the 1965 season. A new stadium spectator record was set in the cup semifinal against Brann in 1967, which was watched by 25,551 people. Rosenborg qualified for the 1968–69 European Cup and met SK Rapid Wien in the first round. The game was spectated by 22,492 and remains the record for UEFA tournaments. Per-season average attendance for Rosenborg's league matches lay between five and ten thousand people during the 1970s and early 1980s, with <b>an</b> <b>all-time</b> <b>low</b> of 2,549 in 1978, when Rosenborg played in the Second Division. The venue hosted the Norwegian Athletics Championships four times, in 1963, 1967, 1973 and 1983. Lerkendal hosted the Women's Cup Final in 1986, where Sprint-Jeløy beat Trondheims-Ørn. Strindheim IL played in the top division in 1984 and 1995, both times playing their home games at Lerkendal. Kvik remained at Lerkendal until the upgrades started in 2000, after which they moved to Øya stadion. Bodø/Glimt played their home game in the 1999–2000 UEFA Cup against Werder Bremen at Lerkendal, attracting 1,425 spectators.|$|E
5000|$|The 1998 ADL {{survey also}} found a {{correlation}} between antisemitism and sympathy for right-wing anti-government groups [...] Although antisemitism has declined over the past 35 years, the activities of some antisemitic groups have intensified, possibly {{as a result of}} the increasing marginalization of antisemitic viewpoints [...] From 1974 to 1979, membership in the Ku Klux Klan rose from <b>a</b> historic <b>all-time</b> <b>low</b> of 1,500 to 11,500, and throughout the 1980s various Klan factions allied themselves with more explicitly neo-Nazi groups like the Aryan Nations.|$|R
50|$|Attendances {{were now}} at <b>a</b> {{worrying}} <b>all-time</b> <b>low</b> {{and so the}} Stoke board and manager Tony Waddington decided something {{needed to be done}} to bring the supporters back to the Victoria Ground. And Waddington pulled off a master stroke after paying £3,000 to Blackpool for the returning 46-year-old Stanley Matthews. Crowds instantly arrived in large numbers with Matthews first match back against Huddersfield Town more than 35,000 turned up a good 15,000 more than the last home match. Stoke could not sustain a push for promotion, but the feeling around the club had changed dramatically.|$|R
50|$|In 1976, Colchester Borough Council set up {{a stadium}} working party to work towards solutions, {{locations}} and study the feasibility for a new stadium for the town. During the 1980-81 season, plans were submitted for an all-seater stadium at the Avenue of Remembrance, Colchester. However, the club ended the season 22nd out of 24 in the Third Division table and relegated to the Fourth Division, with an average gate of just 2,641 and <b>a</b> new <b>all-time</b> <b>lowest</b> attendance of 1,430. The stadium plan {{was rejected by the}} council {{on the grounds of the}} covenant restrictions.|$|R
5|$|During {{the first}} four months of his premiership, Brown enjoyed a {{substantial}} lead in the polls. His popularity amongst the public may have been because his handling of numerous serious events during his first few weeks as Prime Minister, including two attempted terrorist attacks in London and Glasgow at the end of June 2007. However, between the end of 2007 and September 2008, his popularity fell significantly; two contributing factors were believed to be his perceived change of mind over plans to call a general election in October 2007 and his handling of the 10p tax rate cut in 2008, which led to allegations of weakness and dithering. His unpopularity led eight Labour MPs to call for a leadership contest in September 2008, less than 15 months into his premiership. The threat of a leadership contest receded due to his perceived strong handling of the global financial crisis in October, but his popularity hit <b>an</b> <b>all-time</b> <b>low</b> and his position became increasingly untenable after the May 2009 expenses scandal and Labour's poor results in the 2009 Local and European elections. Brown's cabinet began to rebel; there were several key resignations in the run up to local elections in June 2009. However, Brown was backed by his party. He faced a second attempt to launch a leadership challenge by former Cabinet colleagues Geoff Hoon and Patricia Hewitt in January 2010, but the plot failed to gather momentum and Brown remained as both Labour leader and Prime Minister to lead his party into the 2010 General Election. The election resulted in a hung parliament, with the Conservative Party winning the largest number of seats. Brown remained as Prime Minister while the Liberal Democrats entered separate negotiations with Labour and the Conservatives with a view to forming a coalition government. He announced his intention to resign on 10 May 2010 to help broker a Labour-Liberal Democrat deal. However, this became increasingly unlikely and on 11 May, Brown announced his resignation as Prime Minister and as Leader of the Labour Party.|$|E
5|$|In 1968, {{the club}} won their third Portuguese Cup and {{qualified}} for the 1968–69 Cup Winners' Cup. As in previous years, {{they were unable to}} get past the second round, losing 4–1 on aggregate to Slovan Bratislava. Porto's last participation in the Fairs Cup, in 1969–70, also ended in the second round, with a defeat against holders Newcastle United. Domestically, Porto finished the league in <b>an</b> <b>all-time</b> <b>low</b> ninth place, thus failing to qualify for European competition in the 1970–71 season. They returned the following season to participate in the inaugural edition of the UEFA Cup, which officially replaced the Fairs Cup, but their debut against Nantes led to another premature exit. Porto returned to this tournament in four of the following five seasons, the exception being 1973–74, when it failed qualification for European competitions. In the first of those seasons (1972–73), Porto reached the third round of a European competition for the first time, but were eliminated by Dynamo Dresden. They beat Barcelona in the first round, in what was the teams' first European encounter and the only time Porto eliminated the Spanish side from European competitions. In the 1975–76 UEFA Cup, Porto were again eliminated in the third round, but in the process they beat Luxembourg's Avenir Beggen with a club record home (7–0) and aggregate (10–0) win scores. In {{the first round of the}} following season's UEFA Cup, Porto were matched with Schalke 04. After a tie in the first leg, Porto squandered a 2–0 lead in the second leg, conceding three goals in the last 15 minutes, which resulted in their elimination.|$|E
5|$|In Eastern Europe, wolves {{were never}} fully exterminated, {{because of the}} area's {{contiguity}} with Asia and its large forested areas. However, Eastern European wolf populations were reduced to very low numbers by the late nineteenth century. Wolves were extirpated in Slovakia during {{the first decade of}} the twentieth century and, by the mid-twentieth century, could only be found in a few forested areas in eastern Poland. Wolves in the eastern Balkans benefitted from the region's contiguity with the former Soviet Union and large areas of plains, mountains and farmlands. Wolves in Hungary occurred in only half the country around the start of the 20th century, and were largely restricted to the Carpathian Basin. Wolf populations in Romania remained largely substantial, with an average of 2,800 wolves being killed annually out of a population of 4,600 from 1955–1965. <b>An</b> <b>all-time</b> <b>low</b> was reached in 1967, when the population was reduced to 1,550 animals. The extermination of wolves in Bulgaria was relatively recent, as a previous population of about 1,000 animals in 1955 was reduced to about 100–200 in 1964. In Greece, the species disappeared from the southern Peloponnese in 1930. Despite periods of intense hunting during the eighteenth century, wolves never disappeared in the western Balkans, from Albania to the former Yugoslavia. Organized persecution of wolves began in Yugoslavia in 1923, with the setting up of the Wolf Extermination Committee (WEC) in Kocevje, Slovenia. The WEC was successful in reducing wolf numbers in the Dinaric Alps.|$|E
