In 1996 a group of Japanese and French astronomers discovered that Pleione is a single-lined spectroscopic binary with an orbital period of 218.0 days and a large eccentricity of 0.6. The Washington Double Star Catalogue lists an <b>angular</b> <b>separation</b> between the two components of 0.2 arcsecondsan angle which equates to a distance of about 24 AU, assuming a distance of 120 parsecs.|$|E
5|$|The {{orbital motion}} of the Sirius binary system brings the two stars to a minimum <b>angular</b> <b>separation</b> of 3arcseconds and a maximum of 11arcseconds. At the closest approach, it is an {{observational}} challenge to distinguish the white dwarf from its more luminous companion, requiring a telescope with at least 300mm (12in) aperture and excellent seeing conditions. A periastron occurred in 1994 and the pair have since been moving apart, making them easier to separate with a telescope.|$|E

The system is composed of a primary star, Kepler-14A, and a dimmer companion star, Kepler-14B. When the stars were observed, while searching for the planet Kepler-14b, the <b>angular</b> <b>separation</b> of the binary system made it extremely difficult to note the dimmer companion star.

This star, however, is known to exhibit solar-like oscillations over a period of approximately 2.16 hours. The other two stars in Serpens Cauda forming its asterism are Theta and Xi Serpentis. Xi, where the asterism crosses over to Mu Serpentis in the head, is a triple star system located approximately 105 parsecs away. Two of the stars, with a combined apparent magnitude of around 3.5, form a spectroscopic binary with an <b>angular</b> <b>separation</b> of only 2.2 milliarcseconds, and thus cannot be resolved with modern equipment.

When viewed through a moderate telescope, the two components—a brighter blue-white star of magnitude 3.9 and a fainter star of magnitude 6.1 that {{has been described as}} lilac as well as blue-white—can be seen. 15 Lyncis is another star that is found to be a double system when viewed through a telescope, separating into two yellowish stars of magnitudes 4.7 and 5.8 that are 0.9arcseconds apart. The components are a yellow giant of spectral type G8III that is around 4.01 times as massive as the Sun, and a yellow-white main sequence star of spectral type F8V that is around 3.73 times as massive as the Sun. Orbiting each other every 262 years, the stars are 178 ± 2 light years distant from Earth. 12 Lyncis has a combined apparent magnitude of 4.87. When seen through a telescope, it can be separated into three stars: two components with magnitudes 5.4 and 6.0 that lie at an <b>angular</b> <b>separation</b> by 1.8″ (as of 1992) and a yellow-hued star of magnitude 7.2 at a separation of 8.6″ (as of 1990).

40|$|AbstractA test grating {{appears to}} be tilted away from an {{inducing}} grating for small <b>angular</b> <b>separations</b> (repulsion), but towards the inducing grating for larger <b>angular</b> <b>separations</b> (attraction). Previous research on luminance gratings suggests that repulsion is caused by local inhibition in cortical areas V 1 and/or V 2, and that the attraction involves global interactions beyond V 1, in extrastriate areas. Experiments reported here demonstrate attribute invariant attraction and repulsion effects for gratings specified by luminance, motion, and disparity contrasts. A frame surrounding the inducing grating abolishes only the attraction effect, but a spatial frequency difference, or a small gap between the inducer and test gratings, abolishes only the repulsion effect, irrespective of the attributes that specify the gratings. It is proposed that detectors selectively sensitive to attribute invariant orientation and size exist in early cortical sites such as V 1 and/or V 2...|$|R

If the interval between the flashes is less than a second or so, the first light that is flashed appears to move across to the position of the second light.

Dennett asks how we could see the light change colour before the second light is observed.|$|E
500|$|First, Pluto's {{argument}} of perihelion, the angle between {{the point where}} it crosses the ecliptic and {{the point where it}} is closest to the Sun, librates around 90°. This means that when Pluto is closest to the Sun, it is at its farthest above the plane of the Solar System, preventing encounters with Neptune. This is a consequence of the Kozai mechanism, which relates the eccentricity of an orbit to its inclination to a larger perturbing body—in this case Neptune. Relative to Neptune, the amplitude of libration is 38°, and so the <b>angular</b> <b>separation</b> of Pluto's perihelion to the orbit of Neptune is always greater than 52° [...] The closest such <b>angular</b> <b>separation</b> occurs every 10,000 years.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. We {{describe}} an extensive FUSE survey of highly ionized {{oxygen in the}} vicinity of the Milky Way that serves as an example of the type of study that would be desirable for other galactic systems. Understanding the origin of hot gas {{in the vicinity of}} galaxies and its relationship to the intergalactic medium presents a major observational challenge. Ultraviolet absorption-line spectroscopy is currently the most direct means for comprehensive investigations of the gas in galactic environments, but even with present (and near-term) facilities the number of background objects available to probe nearby galaxy halos and low-redshift cosmological structures is limited. Studying these structures over a range of impact parameters and <b>angular</b> <b>separations</b> would provide fundamental information about the baryonic content of the hot gas, its physical conditions, and its origins.

40|$|Image Rotation and Subtraction (IRS) is a high-contrast imaging {{technique}} {{which can be}} used to suppress the speckles noise and facilitate the direct detection of exoplanets. IRS is different from Angular Differential Imaging (ADI), in which it will subtract a copy of the image with 180 degrees rotated around its PSF center, rather than the subtraction of the median of all of the PSF images. Since the planet itself will be rotated {{to the other side of}} the PSF, IRS does not suffer from planet self-subtraction. In this paper, we have introduced an optimization algorithm to IRS (OIRS), which can provide an extra contrast gain at small <b>angular</b> <b>separations.</b> The performance of OIRS has been demonstrated with ADI data.
