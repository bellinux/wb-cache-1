40|$|The {{purpose of}} this case study {{is to examine the}} nature and uses of {{multiple}} literacies in an Opera Project as experienced by school children who attended a bilingual first grade in a culturally and linguistically diverse urban school district in the American Southwest. Thirty-one young children created and produced an opera in collaboration with an artist-in-residence, university researcher, <b>apprentice</b> <b>teacher,</b> and their classroom teacher and parents. Significant to this research is a focus on the perspectives of the participants about this in-school multiple literacy experience as well as the sociocultural contexts that influenced their experience. In addition, this study provides evidence of the processes, types, and uses of multiple literacies in young children's opera. By working at the nexus of language arts/literacy and music/arts education, this research builds on the existing theories and practices in these disciplines and informs both. A review of the literature points to the gap between a reductionist, deficit-driven paradigm in schools and children's natural learning proclivities. Culturally and linguistically diverse children are considered as less capable and further marginalized by school practices that emphasize decontextualized and verbocentric forms of literacy. This study uses ethnographic techniques and an arts-based approach to educational research to examine 24 one hour sessions of an Opera Project. New understandings were rendered in an opera libretto, constructed in the vernacular of the participants with the personal signature of the researcher. This alternative genre contributes to changing {{the way we think about}} language arts. A reconceptualization of language arts/literacy that both includes and goes beyond a skills-with-print definition requires a transformation in the way educators think about meaning making and curriculum, intelligence and knowledge, perception and expression. It requires an unpacking of one's assumptions and perspectives about what it means to have an experience and to live a literate life. For this process to be sustained, a wider audience must have access to young children's opera as (1) semiotic apprenticeship, (2) inquiry, (3) synergy, (4) an awakening to multiple literacies, and (5) survival. In this way art as conscious life is literacy for life's sake. Many ways is the way...|$|E
40|$|Vocational {{training}} curricula {{are often}} {{designed as a}} progression of alternating periods of attending school and working as an apprentice in a company. In the case discussed in this paper, involving the training of electrician apprentices at a Danish vocational school, many of the apprentices (pupils) have difficulties understanding how the two modes of learning, i. e. formal learning by means of instruction and informal learning through apprenticeship, relate {{to one another and}} add up to a meaningful whole. This paper is an account of an experiment in designing for net-based vocational learning with the aim of providing a coupling between widely different learning contexts. The design approach is based on a user-focused quadruple helix model of understanding the learning situation. According to this model, knowledge institution, enterprise, and public authorities together and in shifting constellations provide a framework in which all actors assume roles that are multi-dimensional. The actual design process used is based on a recently-developed method for user-driven innovation, the "quadrant model", involving <b>apprentices,</b> <b>teachers,</b> and masters and journeymen from companies as active and equal co-creators of new didactic designs. Having initially acquired domain knowledge by means of observation and interviews with the various user groups, the researchers together with <b>apprentices,</b> <b>teachers,</b> masters and journeymen have developed a series of designs for new practices by means of workshops, prototyping, and testing. The final outcome has been three designs that facilitate communication between apprentice-and-apprentice, school-and-apprentice, and apprentice-and-master/journeyman. From the perspective of the apprentices, the three designs: a) facilitate community building; b) help bring the school into the practice environment; and c) encourage reflection on one's own practice. From {{the point of view of}} the school, the designs make it possible to extend formal learning to the workplace, and for masters/journeymen the designs offer an opportunity to supplement dreary routines of documentation with visualisations and reflections on practice. It is suggested that the designs are likely to result in an empowerment of the apprentices, and thus that in a wider perspective successful integration of the designs entail a need for adjusting existing practices in terms of assigning the learners a more active and responsible role as co-contributors to their own education...|$|R

Their experiences lay as the foundation for answering the following research question;  "How does the vocational education program support and prepare students heading for different professions?" The motivation for this study is the ongoing change of structure within the Norwegian vocational education. The Ministry of education has involved several experts in this changing process, however, no students nor teachers have been included. This article will therefore bring forward students, <b>apprentices</b> and <b>teachers</b> voices, before the ministry of education make their decisions. Their experiences of the current education programs, are important as part of the foundation for the evaluation of a need for change. The theoretical perspectives are related to conditions regarding students motivation, sense of accomplishment, ability to learn, as well as national guidelines and regulations, goals, and the overall purpose of the vocational education program. The research methods used (in the work) are electronic surveys among the vocational study's current first and second year students as well as apprentices within the specialized educational programs. It also includes semi structured interviews with profession specialized vocational teachers. One key finding reveals that the current educational programs fail to  meet the students individual learning needs, nor does it comply with national guidelines and regulations for the Norwegian vocational educations.  The basic year works for some students and professions but not for others.

40|$|This book arose as a {{consequence}} of a brainstorm with colleagues at a higher education institution where we discussed what the personality of the profession of teacher education might look like. We used this shared identification of the construction and personality of the teacher education profession to identify chapters that we thought might be of use to early career teacher educators (ECTE). These are people making the transition from their successful professional practice to the teacher education arena. Thus the book is aimed at people who are early career teacher educators. While most might be within an academic institution there are growing numbers of mentors in school-based programmes of teacher education. Regardless of where you sit on this spectrum of teacher education provision, we believe that anyone <b>apprenticing</b> future <b>teachers</b> needs to have an understanding of the similarities and differences between their original status and their status as a teacher educator. An expert classroom teacher does not necessarily result in an efficient or effective teacher educator or mentor. However, if we can develop and support informed professionals such educators could make a difference to the learning experiences of students in education programmes. The intention of this book was to provide a means to encourage those new to the teacher education profession to consider the signature pedagogy of teacher education by considering aspects of pedagogy, subject, reflection, ethics, working with others, and quality assurance.

When {{a university}} teacher integrates these three elements as a process, scholarship {{of teaching and learning}} (SOTL) is accomplished. SOTL means that the knowledge the university teacher builds is about teaching and learning. Examples of the research questions posed by the SOTL academic are: ‘Is there evidence that student learning is enhanced through this type of teaching approach?’ and ‘What makes learning sustainable and transferable?’ Constructing a legacy of learning for a SOTL academic means timetabled students access the teaching and also, the teaching and learning research is published in journals and books and presented at conferences. This ensures access to learning is extended and contributes to an interactive history of scholarship. SOTL also means students are considered as more than pupils or an audience.
