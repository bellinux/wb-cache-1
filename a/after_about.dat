5|$|A small navy had {{operated}} at {{a fairly}} low level <b>after</b> <b>about</b> 300 BC, {{but it was}} massively upgraded about forty years later, during the First Punic War. After a period of frenetic construction, the navy mushroomed to a size of more than 400 ships on the Carthaginian ("Punic") pattern. Once completed, it could accommodate up to 100,000 sailors and embarked troops for battle. The navy thereafter declined in size.|$|E

He turned down the offer of a posting home to Southern Rhodesia as an instructor and, after a refresher course in Egypt, travelled to Corsica to rejoin No. 237 Squadron, which was by now flying Spitfire Mk IXs.|$|E
5|$|<b>After</b> <b>about</b> 10 days (1–3 weeks {{depending}} on temperatures), larvae hatch and bore directly throughout the pod walls and develop within the seed. Larvae are thus protected from {{biological and chemical}} control. Larval development lasts two to three months. Before entering its pupal stage, the larva cuts a circular cap. After around ten days of pupal stage, the adult emerges from the seeds. Because mating and oviposition are spread over a few weeks, adults can emerge before or after harvest.|$|E
