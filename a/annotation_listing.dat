Results: We use decision trees to predict phenotypes associated with Saccharomyces cerevisiae genes on the basis of Gene Ontology (GO) functional annotations from the Saccharomyces Genome Database (SGD) and other phenotypic annotations from the Yeast Phenotype Catalog at the Munich Information Center for Protein Sequences (MIPS). We assess the methodology in three ways: (1) we use cross-validation on the phenotypic <b>annotations</b> <b>listed</b> in MIPS, and show ROC curves indicating the tradeoff between true-positive rate and false-positive rate; (2) we do a literature-search for 100 of the predicted gene-phenotype associations that are not listed in MIPS, and find evidence for 43 of them; (3) we use deletion strains to experimentally assess 61 predicted gene-phenotype associations not listed in MIPS; significantly more of these deletion strains show abnormal growth than would be expected by chance.

40|$|Background: In {{eukaryotic}} cells, identical proteins can {{be located}} in different subcellular compartments (termed dualtargeted proteins). Methodology/Principal Findings: We divided a reference set of mitochondrial proteins (published single gene studies) into two groups: i) Dual targeted mitochondrial proteins and ii) Exclusive mitochondrial proteins. Mitochondrial proteins were considered dual-targeted if they were also found or predicted to be localized to the cytosol, the nucleus, the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) or the peroxisome. We found that dual localized mitochondrial proteins have i) A weaker mitochondrial targeting sequence (MitoProtII score, hydrophobic moment and number of basic residues) and ii) a lower whole-protein net charge, when compared to exclusive mitochondrial proteins. We have also generated an <b>annotation</b> <b>list</b> of dual-targeted proteins within the predicted yeast mitochondrial proteome. This considerably large group of dual-localized proteins comprises approximately {{one quarter of the}} predicted mitochondrial proteome. We supported this prediction by experimental verification of a subgroup of the predicted dual targeted proteins. Conclusions/Significance: Taken together, these results establish dual targeting as a widely abundant phenomenon that should affect our concepts of gene expression and protein function.

40|$|With the {{prevalence}} of digital cameras, {{more and more people}} have considerable digital images on their personal devices. As a result, there are increasing needs to effectively search these personal images. Automatic image annotation may serve the goal, for the annotated keywords could facilitate the search processes. Although many image annotation methods have been proposed in recent years, their effectiveness on arbitrary personal images is constrained by their limited scalability, i. e. limited lexicon of small-scale training set. To be scalable, we propose a searchbased image annotation (SBIA) algorithm that is analogous to Web page search. First, content-based image retrieval (CBIR) technology is used to retrieve a set of visually similar images from a large-scale Web image set. Then, a text-based keyword search (TBKS) technique is used to obtain a ranked <b>list</b> of candidate <b>annotations</b> for each retrieved image. Finally, a fusion algorithm is used to combine the ranked lists into the final <b>annotation</b> <b>list.</b> The application of both efficient search technologies and Webscale image set guarantees the scalability of the proposed algorithm.

However, the core problem of the clinical evaluation of mammographic tumors remains a highly demanding cognitive task. In order for these automated diagnostic systems to perform in levels of sensitivity and specificity {{similar to that of}} human experts, it is essential that a robust framework on problem-specific design parameters is formulated. This study is focused on identifying a robust set of clinical features that can be used as the base for designing the input of any computer-aided diagnosis system for automatic mammographic tumor evaluation. A thorough list of clinical features was constructed and the diagnostic value of each feature was verified against current clinical practices by an expert physician. These features were directly or indirectly related to the overall morphological properties of the mammographic tumor or the texture of the fine-scale tissue structures as they appear in the digitized image, while others contained external clinical data of outmost importance, like the patient’s age.

40|$|Abstract Background Pigeonpea [Cajanus cajan (L.) Millsp. ] is an {{important}} legume crop of rainfed agriculture. Despite of concerted research efforts directed to pigeonpea improvement, stagnated productivity of pigeonpea during last several decades may be accounted to prevalence of various biotic and abiotic constraints and the situation is exacerbated by availability of inadequate genomic resources to undertake any molecular breeding programme for accelerated crop improvement. With the objective of enhancing genomic resources for pigeonpea, this study reports for the first time, large scale development of SSR markers from BAC-end sequences and their subsequent use for genetic mapping and hybridity testing in pigeonpea. Results A set of 88, 860 BAC (bacterial artificial chromosome) -end sequences (BESs) were generated after constructing two BAC libraries by using Hin dIII (34, 560 clones) and Bam HI (34, 560 clones) restriction enzymes. Clustering based on sequence identity of BESs yielded a set of > 52 K non-redundant sequences, comprising 35 Mbp or > 4 % of the pigeonpea genome. These sequences were analyzed to develop <b>annotation</b> <b>lists</b> and subdivide the BESs into genome fractions (e. g., genes, retroelements, transpons and non-annotated sequences). Parallel analysis of BESs for microsatellites or simple sequence repeats (SSRs) identified 18, 149 SSRs, from which a set of 6, 212 SSRs were selected for further analysis. A total of 3, 072 novel SSR primer pairs were synthesized and tested for length polymorphism {{on a set of}} 22 parental genotypes of 13 mapping populations segregating for traits of interest. In total, we identified 842 polymorphic SSR markers that will have utility in pigeonpea improvement. Based on these markers, the first SSR-based genetic map comprising of 239 loci was developed for this previously uncharacterized genome. Utility of developed SSR markers was also demonstrated by identifying a set of 42 markers each for two hybrids (ICPH 2671 and ICPH 2438) for genetic purity assessment in commercial hybrid breeding programme. Conclusion In summary, while BAC libraries and BESs should be useful for genomics studies, BES-SSR markers, and the genetic map should be very useful for linking the genetic map with a future physical map as well as for molecular breeding in pigeonpea. </p...|$|R
50|$|While {{techniques}} such as microarray analysis, RNA interference, and the yeast two-hybrid system {{can be used to}} experimentally demonstrate the function of a protein, advances in sequencing technologies have made the rate at which proteins can be experimentally characterized much slower than the rate at which new sequences become available. Thus, the annotation of new sequences is mostly by prediction through computational methods, as these types of annotation can often be done quickly and for many genes or proteins at once. The first such methods inferred function based on homologous proteins with known functions (homology-based function prediction). The development of context-based and structure based methods have expanded what information can be predicted, and a combination of methods can now be used to get a picture of complete cellular pathways based on sequence data. The importance and prevalence of computational prediction of gene function is underlined by an analysis of 'evidence codes' used by the GO database: as of 2010, 98% of <b>annotations</b> were <b>listed</b> under the code IEA (inferred from electronic annotation) while only 0.6% were based on experimental evidence.|$|R
