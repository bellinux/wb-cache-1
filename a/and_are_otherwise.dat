Instead he erected four sections, placing B.lindleyana in B.sect. Orthostylis (now B.ser.

500|$|The {{vertebral}} column of Stegoceras is incompletely known. The articulation between the zygagophyses (articular processes) of successive dorsal (back) vertebrae {{appears to have}} prevented sideways movement of the {{vertebral column}}, which made it very rigid, and it was further strengthened by ossified tendons. Though the neck vertebrae are not known, the downturned occipital condyle (which articulates with the first neck vertebra) indicates that the neck was held in a curved posture, like the [...] "S"- or [...] "U"-shape of most dinosaur necks. Based on {{their position in the}} pachycephalosaur Homalocephale, the ossified tendons found with UALVP 2 would have formed an intricate [...] "caudal basket" [...] in the tail, consisting of parallel rows, with the extremities of each tendon contacting the next successively. Such structures are called myorhabdoi, <b>and</b> <b>are</b> <b>otherwise</b> only known in teleost fish; the feature is unique to pachycephalosaurs among tetrapod (four-limbed) animals, and may have functioned in stiffening the tail.|$|E

60|$|The {{arguments}} {{opposed to}} the theory of Natural Selection, have been discussed in my 'Origin of Species,' as far as the size of that work permitted, under the following heads: the difficulty in understanding how very simple organs have been converted by small and graduated steps into highly perfect and complex organs; the marvellous facts of Instinct; the whole question of Hybridity; and, lastly, the absence in our known geological formations of innumerable links connecting all allied species. Although some of these difficulties are of great weight, we shall see that many of them are explicable on the theory of natural selection, <b>and</b> <b>are</b> <b>otherwise</b> inexplicable.|$|E

60|$|In {{the other}} {{sense of the}} word State, by which is {{understood}} the Supreme Government only, I must observe this upon the question: that to exclude whole classes of men entirely from this part of government cannot be considered as absolute slavery. It only implies a lower and degraded state of citizenship: such is (with more or less strictness) the condition of all countries in which an hereditary nobility possess the exclusive rule. This may be no bad mode of government,--provided that the personal authority of individual nobles be kept in due bounds, that their cabals and factions are guarded against with a severe vigilance, and that the people (who have no share in granting their own money) are subjected to but light impositions, <b>and</b> <b>are</b> <b>otherwise</b> treated with attention, and with indulgence to their humors and prejudices.|$|E

The segments of the three posterior cirri bear three or four pairs of main spines, <b>and</b> <b>are</b> <b>otherwise</b> characterised like the foregoing species. First cirrus, with its anterior ramus much thicker than the posterior ramus, and of nearly equal length; all the segments, except the two terminal ones, thickly clothed with serrated spines. Second cirrus considerably shorter than the third cirrus: anterior ramus with the seven basal segments very protuberant, and paved with bristles, and the four terminal ones on the usual structure; posterior ramus, with the five basal segments paved (but much less thickly than in the anterior ramus), and the nine terminal ones on the usual structure. Third cirrus, the anterior ramus, with the five basal segments, thick and paved, and eleven terminal segments on the usual structure: posterior ramus, with one basal segment paved, and sixteen other segments on the usual structure. In the posterior rami, however, of both {{the second and third}} cirri, it is difficult to draw any distinct line between the paved segments and the others.|$|E

The {{forms of}} the villas to which these towers are {{attached}} are straggling, and varied by many crossing masses; but the great principle of simplicity is always kept in view; everything is square, and terminated by parallel lines; no tall chimneys, no conical roofs, no fantastic ornaments are ever admitted: the arch alone is allowed to relieve the stiffness of the general effect. This is introduced frequently, {{but not in the}} windows, which are either squares or double squares, at great distances from each other, set deeply into the walls and only adorned with broad flat borders. Where more light is required they are set moderately close, and protected by an outer line of arches, deep enough to keep the noonday sun from entering the rooms. These lines of arches cast soft shadows along the bright fronts, <b>and</b> <b>are</b> <b>otherwise</b> of great value. Their effect is pretty well seen in fig. 10; a piece which, while it has no distinguished beauty is yet pleasing by its entire simplicity; and peculiarly so, when we know that simplicity to have been chosen (some say, built) for its last and lonely habitation, by a mind of softest passion as of purest thought; and to have sheltered its silent old age among the blue and quiet hills, till it passed away like a deep lost melody from the earth, leaving a light of peace about the gray tomb at which the steps of those who pass by always falter, and around this deserted, and decaying, and calm habitation of the thoughts of the departed; Petrarch's, at Arquà. A more familiar instance of the application of these arches is the Villa of Mecænas at Tivoli, though it is improperly styled a villa, being pretty well known to have been nothing but stables.|$|E
