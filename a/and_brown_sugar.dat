25|$|In Tamil Nadu, a plain rice porridge, or {{the thick}} {{supernatant}} water from overcooked rice, {{is known as}} kanji. Kanji or Congee is also prepared with different grains available {{in different parts of}} Tamil Nadu, for example minor millet or pearl millet, finger millet, broken wheat, maize.The people of Kerala also call this preparation of rice in a watery state kanji, and it is eaten as a porridge with green lentils or chutney. Kanji is prepared with rice or ragi. Nuts and spices are added to the kanji depending on the economic status or health requirements. Rice kanji is prepared by boiling rice in large amounts of water. To this preparation, either milk and sugar (usually jaggery) or curd (yoghurt) and salt are added. Ragi kanji is prepared by drying ragi sprouts in shade, and then grinding them into a smooth powder. This powder is added to water and cooked. Milk <b>and</b> <b>brown</b> <b>sugar</b> are added to this cooked preparation for taste. Ragi kanji can be given to infants after six months. Another kanji preparation uses jevvarisi (sago in English, sabudana in Hindi) in kanji. Sago is dry roasted and powdered with/ without sugar. Powdered sago is boiled in water until cooked. This is eaten by all ages from adults to infants as young as three months.|$|E

2500|$|Considered {{the staple}} starch of {{traditional}} Polynesian cuisine, taro {{is both a}} common and prestigious food item that was first introduced to the Polynesian islands by prehistoric seafarers of Southeast Asian derivation. The tuber itself is prepared in various ways, including baking, steaming in earth ovens (umu or imu), boiling, and frying. The famous Hawaiian staple poi is made by mashing steamed taro roots with water. Taro also features in traditional desserts such as Samoan [...] "fa'ausi", which consists of grated, cooked taro mixed with coconut milk <b>and</b> <b>brown</b> <b>sugar.</b> The leaves of the taro plant also feature prominently in Polynesian cooking, especially as edible wrappings for dishes such as Hawaiian laulau, Fijian and Samoan [...] "palusami" [...] (wrapped around onions and coconut milk), and Tongan [...] "lupulu" [...] (wrapped corned beef). Ceremonial presentations on occasion of chiefly rites or communal events (weddings, funerals, etc.) traditionally included ritual presentation of raw and cooked taro roots/plants.|$|E
60|$|Thus {{it is that}} Mr. Bullock's {{practices}} are at all known.

40|$|The area of {{radiation}} exposure by the nuclear accident occurred at Tokai village in 1999 was estimated by the ESR measurement of 95 household sugar samples collected from the accident area. These samples were roughly classiˆed into three types of sugar, ˆne white <b>sugar,</b> ˆne <b>brown</b> <b>sugar</b> <b>and</b> coarse <b>brown</b> <b>sugar.</b> The control ˆne white sugar showed no radical in the ESR spectrum, while those of ˆne <b>brown</b> <b>sugar</b> <b>and</b> coarse <b>brown</b> <b>sugar</b> showed {{the presence of a}} small amount of radicals. It was also shown that, among these three kinds of sugar, the radical concentration of ˆne white su-gar sampled from wooden houses at the area similar to each other did not vary much with the samples, while those of ˆne <b>brown</b> <b>sugar</b> <b>and</b> coarse <b>brown</b> <b>sugar</b> varied to a considerable extent. Thus, the ˆne white sugar is considered to be more suitable for the estimation of the level {{of radiation}} exposure. The radical concentration of each ˆne white sugar sample was plotted against the distance from the site of the nuclear accident with a correction of the diŠerence in the shielding eŠect between concrete houses and wooden houses. The samples obtained at more than 2 km north of the site of nuclear accident showed no ESR spectral signal to a detectable extent. On the other hand, the ESR spectra were ob-served from the samples obtained within 10 km south and 4 km west of the accident site. These results suggest that the radiation exposure by the contaminant blown by the northeast wind blowing {{on the day of the}} accident may occur at the south and west areas...|$|R
