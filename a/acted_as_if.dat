5|$|In 1836, the Reverend Richard Hill {{had a fit}} of {{apoplexy}} in the vestry and died. Soon {{after this}} dramatic event, and while the church was still in mourning, the Right Reverend William Grant Broughton was installed as Bishop of Australia during a service in St James' lasting five hours. Since Macquarie's {{plans for a new}} cathedral on George Street had not come to fruition, Broughton <b>acted</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> St James' were a pro-cathedral. Robert Cartwright and then Napoleon Woodd succeeded Richard Hill at St James'.|$|E
5|$|Philip had no {{intention}} of handing over Amphipolis to the Athenians, but <b>acted</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> he was just delaying the transfer of the city. He seems to have gone straight on to besiege Pydna after capturing Amphipolis. The Athenians, perhaps still hoping to receive Amphipolis if they allowed Philip to take Pydna, do not seem to have tried to intervene (and may not have been able to). Pydna seems to have fallen to Philip by treachery, in either 357 or 356 BC.|$|E
5|$|According to Plutarch, one {{tradition}} had it {{that the}} Persian king (who at the time would still have been Xerxes) agreed a humiliating peace treaty {{in the aftermath of}} the Eurymedon. However, as Plutarch admits, other authors denied that such a peace was made at this time, and the more logical date for any peace treaty would have been after the Cyprus campaign of 450 BC. The alternative suggested by Plutarch is that the Persian king <b>acted</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> he had made a humiliating peace with the Greeks, because he was so fearful of engaging in battle with them again. It is generally considered unlikely by modern historians that a peace treaty was made in the aftermath of Eurymedon.|$|E

5|$|Nolan North, {{the voice}} actor who played Drake, {{had a large}} role in {{defining}} the character's physical and vocal reactions. In the Uncharted series, the actors were used for motion capture, and <b>acted</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> performing in a movie. Motion capture was done on a soundstage, and the dialog recorded during this process was used in the game. North was allowed to ad-lib dialog and insert aspects of his own personality into the character. In naming the character, the development team considered many different choices, including Ethan, Samuel, and John. Matthew Drake was seriously contemplated, but received a poor reaction from those it was presented to. Eventually, Naughty Dog settled on the name Nathan for its ability to be shortened to Nate, and the perception that it sounded historical. Drake's character design changed little between Drake's Fortune and Among Thieves.|$|E

25|$|There is {{considerable}} speculation {{as to the}} actual paternity of Paul I. It is suggested {{that he was not}} Peter's son at all, but that his mother had engaged in an affair—to which Elizabeth had consented—with a young officer named Sergei Vasilievich Saltykov, and that he was Paul's real father. In any case Peter never gave any indication that he believed Paul to have been fathered by anyone but himself. He also did not take any interest in parenthood. Elizabeth though most certainly took an active interest. She removed the young Paul and <b>acted</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> she were his mother and not Catherine. The Empress had ordered the midwife to take the baby and to follow her. Catherine was not to see her child for another month and then on the second time briefly for the churching ceremony. Six months later Elizabeth let Catherine see the child again. The child had in effect become a ward of the state and in a larger sense, the property of the state, to be brought up by Elizabeth as she believed he should be — as a true heir and great-grandson of her father, Peter the Great.|$|E

25|$|He {{was born}} René Karl Wilhelm Johann Josef Maria Rilke in Prague, capital of Bohemia (then part of Austria-Hungary, {{now part of}} the Czech Republic). His {{childhood}} and youth in Prague were not especially happy. His father, Josef Rilke (1838–1906), became a railway official after an unsuccessful military career. His mother, Sophie (“Phia”) Entz (1851–1931), came from a well-to-do Prague family, the Entz-Kinzelbergers, who lived in a house on the Herrengasse (Panská) 8, where René also spent many of his early years. The relationship between Phia and her only son was coloured by her mourning for an earlier child, a daughter who had died only one week old. During Rilke's early years Phia <b>acted</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> she sought to recover the lost girl through the boy by dressing him in girl's clothing. His parents' marriage failed in 1884. His parents pressured the poetically and artistically talented youth into entering a military academy, which he attended from 1886 until 1891, when he left owing to illness. From 1892 to 1895 he was tutored for the university entrance exam, which he passed in 1895. Until 1896 he studied literature, art history, and philosophy in Prague and Munich.|$|E
500|$|The name Anonymous {{itself is}} {{inspired}} by the perceived anonymity under which users post images and comments on the Internet. Usage of the term Anonymous {{in the sense of}} a shared identity began on imageboards, particularly the /b/ board of 4chan, dedicated to random content. A tag of Anonymous is assigned to visitors who leave comments without identifying the originator of the posted content. Users of imageboards sometimes jokingly <b>acted</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> Anonymous was a single individual. The concept of the Anonymous entity advanced in 2004 when an administrator on the 4chan image board activated a [...] "Forced_Anon" [...] protocol that signed all posts as Anonymous. As the popularity of imageboards increased, the idea of Anonymous as a collective of unnamed individuals became an Internet meme.|$|E
500|$|Attendances at {{the church}} were small until, {{during one of the}} services, Prince <b>acted</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> he was possessed, {{throwing}} himself around the church. Congregations grew each week as the [...] "possession" [...] was repeated. The congregation were then divided with separate services for men and women. Subsequently, he separated them again into sinners and the righteous, which generally included females who were wealthy. The bishop was summoned to investigate the practices. By that time, Prince had contracted his first [...] "spiritual marriage" [...] and had persuaded himself that he had been absorbed into the personality of God and become a visible embodiment of the Holy Spirit. During his illness Starkey read one of his curate's sermons, and was not only [...] "cured" [...] forthwith, but embraced his strange doctrines. Together they procured many conversions in the countryside and the neighbouring towns. In the end the rector was deprived of his living and Prince was defrocked. Together with a few disciples they started the Charlinch Free Church, which had a very brief existence, meeting in a supportive farmer's barn.|$|E
