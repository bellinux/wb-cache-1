40|$|We {{analyze the}} path arrival rate for an inroom radio channel with {{directive}} antennas. The impulse response of this channel exhibits {{a transition from}} early separate components followed by a diffuse reverberation tail. Under {{the assumption that the}} transmitter's (or receiver's) position and orientation are picked uniformly at random we derive an exact expression of the mean arrival rate for a rectangular room predicted by the mirror source theory. The rate is quadratic in delay, inversely proportional to the room volume, and proportional to the product of beam coverage fractions of the transmitter and receiver antennas. Making use of the exact formula, we characterize the onset of the diffuse tail by defining a "mixing time" as the point in time where the arrival rate exceeds one component per transmit pulse duration. We also give an approximation for the power-delay spectrum.
