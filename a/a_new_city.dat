5|$|An {{advisory}} committee {{was formed by}} the city council in 1956 to propose sites for <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>city</b> hall and civic center campus.

City offices instead moved to a former hardware store near the Bellevue Square shopping center in 1960.|$|E
5|$|Funding for {{the city}} hall came from several sources. In 1889, the Oregon Legislative Assembly {{approved}} a sale of $175,000 worth of bonds by the City of Portland to finance the construction of <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>city</b> hall. The building ultimately cost $575,000.|$|E

5|$|Paris' {{cultural}} centre {{had begun to}} move to the Right Bank, after the draining of its former swampland made the land habitable and fit for crops. In 1137, <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>city</b> marketplace (where Les Halles is today) replaced the two smaller ones on the Île de la Cité and Place de la Grève (Hotel de Ville). The latter location housed the headquarters of Paris' river trade corporation, an organisation that later became, unofficially (although formally in later years), Paris' first municipal government.|$|E
5|$|Yongle demoted Nanjing to a {{secondary}} capital and in 1403 announced the new capital of China {{was to be}} at his power base in Beijing. Construction of <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>city</b> there lasted from 1407 to 1420, employing {{hundreds of thousands of}} workers daily. At the center was the political node of the Imperial City, and {{at the center of this}} was the Forbidden City, the palatial residence of the emperor and his family. By 1553, the Outer City was added to the south, which brought the overall size of Beijing to 4 by 4½ miles.|$|E
5|$|A major {{restoration}} of Mdina's fortifications was {{undertaken in the}} 1720s by the French military engineer Charles François de Mondion, during the magistracy of António Manoel de Vilhena. L'Isle-Adam's palace, including the remaining parts of the Castellu di la Chitati, were demolished {{to make way for}} Palazzo Vilhena, while the main gate was walled up and <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>city</b> gate was built in the Baroque style. A Baroque portal was also added to the Greeks Gate. The remaining medieval towers in the land front were demolished and the Torre dello Standardo was built {{on the site of the}} Turri Mastra, while the entire western walls of the city were demolished to make way for a single casemated curtain wall known as Magazine Curtain. D'Homedes Bastion was modified with the addition of a bastionette, while traverse-like batteries were built at the extremities of the land front. The city was further protected with the construction of outworks, including a covertway, two places-of-arms and a glacis.|$|E

5|$|After the Norman {{conquest of}} England in the 11th century a motte and bailey castle was {{constructed}} {{on the south}} side of the city, but the Norman rulers continued to use the older burh walls, despite the city having expanded beyond these defences in the north and south-east. During the years of the Anarchy in the 1140s, Worcester was successfully attacked several times; after the war <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>city</b> wall was built to improve the city's defences. The new walls, completed by the early 13th century, were constructed of stone and had three main gates. They were maintained in good condition into the 17th century.|$|E
5|$|After the Sounds vacated Greer, Mayor Dean {{expressed}} interest in converting the facility to a community sporting complex or <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>city</b> park, but, {{nearing the end of}} his term, ultimately deferred the decision to the next mayor (Megan Barry, elected 2015). In the meantime, Metropolitan Director of Parks Tommy Lynch recommended that the stadium be demolished due to the potential costs for any renovation, including the removal of asbestos. The department asked Mayor Barry for $800,000 to fund the demolition of the concourse and seating bowl so as to expand the green space at the property which could then be sold to private developers. , the ballpark, now dilapidated and vadazlied, is still standing.|$|E
5|$|Albany's first {{city hall}} was the Stadt Huys, {{built by the}} Dutch at the {{intersection}} of Broadway and Hudson Avenue probably in the 1660s, though possibly earlier. It was probably replaced around 1740 with a larger building, which continued {{to be known as the}} Stadt Huys. In 1754, the Stadt Huys was the location of the Albany Congress, where Benjamin Franklin presented the Albany Plan of Union, the first proposal to unite the British American colonies. In 1797 Albany was declared the state capital of New York and the New York Legislature made its home in Albany's city hall. In 1809 the Legislature opened the first New York State Capitol and Albany's government moved in with the Legislature. After purchasing a plot of land at the eastern terminus of Washington Avenue, across Eagle Street from the capitol, the city government moved into <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>city</b> hall designed by Philip Hooker in 1832.|$|E

5|$|Another {{significant}} {{storm was}} Hurricane Hattie, a late-season Category5 hurricane that struck Belize. Hattie caused 319confirmed fatalities and about $60.3million in damage. Destruction was so severe in Belize {{that the government}} had to relocate inland to <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>city,</b> Belmopan. The remnants of Hattie {{may have contributed to the}} development of Tropical Storm Simone in the eastern Pacific Ocean. In early November, the depression that would later strengthen into Hurricane Jenny brought light rainfall to Puerto Rico. The final storm, Tropical Storm Inga, dissipated on November8, after causing no impact on land. On September11, three hurricanes existed simultaneously – Betsy, Carla, and Debbie – the most on a single day in the Atlantic basin since 1893 and until 1998. Collectively, the storms of the 1961Atlantic hurricane season caused about $391million in damage and at least 348fatalities.|$|E
5|$|Construction of the County Courthouse in {{the late}} 1820s also {{encouraged}} growth, with an addition of western lots to Ninth Street and <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>City</b> Hall adjacent to the river in 1833. The military post far {{north of the city}} at Fort Bellefontaine moved nearer to the city to Jefferson Barracks in 1827, and the St. Louis Arsenal was built in south St. Louis the same year. The 1830s included dramatic population growth: by 1830, it had increased to 5,832 from roughly 4,500 in 1820. By 1835, it reached 8,316, doubled by 1840 to 16,439, doubled again by 1845 to 35,390, and again by 1850 to 77,860.|$|E
5|$|Following the First World War, {{the local}} {{authority}} began to systematically buy {{up all the}} stalls on the market, eventually bringing the entire market into public ownership. It was radically redesigned in the 1930s: stalls were arranged into parallel rows and <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>City</b> Hall was built along the entire {{western side of the}} marketplace to replace the by then inadequate Guildhall. This new arrangement survived with few significant changes {{for the rest of the}} 20thcentury. By the 1990s, the market was becoming decrepit and, in 2003, proposals were made for another radical rebuilding of the area. These proposals were extremely controversial and were abandoned in 2004 in favour of a scheme which retained the parallel rows of stalls, but replaced the old stalls with steel units of four stalls each. The rebuilt market was completed in early 2006 and is one of the largest markets in Britain.|$|E

5|$|From its {{establishment}} in 1967 to its abolition in 1992, the Milton Keynes Development Corporation created {{by far the}} largest and most ambitious of the British new towns: indeed its objective was to build <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>city</b> of 250,000 people. Many of Britain's most acclaimed building and landscape architects contributed to what was to be a show-piece of British design. Unlike previous new towns, Milton Keynes has a preponderance of privately funded development but these developments were subject to an exacting design brief in line with the design principles laid out in The Plan for Milton Keynes.|$|E
5|$|In 1797 Albany was {{declared}} the official {{capital of the}} state and the Legislature made city hall its home until the first state capitol was opened in 1809. In an effort to move public buildings away from the bustling and expanding waterfront, the new capitol was located atop the State Street hill, on the same land the current building now stands. City surveyor Simeon De Witt, in his , set aside this land as a public square. Also included on this map are depictions of city hall and the new city jail, located at State and Eagle Streets. In 1809, Albany city government moved with the Legislature into the new capitol and remained there until <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>city</b> hall was opened in 1832. The old Stadt Huys was eventually demolished after a fire in 1836.|$|E
5|$|In 1869, the City of Troy {{bought the}} {{property}} of the Third Street Burying Ground for the site of <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>city</b> hall. This was the burial site for many of Troy's earliest inhabitants; the City had bought lot number 102 in Section N for re-interment of 146 graves. The Vanderheyden family and Jacob Lansing, founders of Troy and Lansingburgh respectively, were re-interred in Oakwood from private, family cemeteries. With these re-interments, the graves within Oakwood span the entire the history of Troy. Although it was a cemetery by definition, Oakwood quickly became a place for recreation and was used in its early days as a public park. In response to its popularity, many memorials include benches in their design, aimed to invite visitors to rest while enjoying their visit. So popular was Oakwood that in 1908 the Association began a stage service between the Oakwood Avenue and 114th Street entrances.|$|E
