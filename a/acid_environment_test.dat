40|$|Includes abstract. Includes bibliographical references. A {{hydrochloric}} acid solution laboratory test {{was developed to}} assess the resistance of concrete used {{in the manufacture of}} pipes to sulphuric <b>acid</b> <b>environments</b> encountered in sewers. A {{hydrochloric acid}} solution (pH of 1, 00) simulates the attack on concrete sewer pipes at the average daily sewage level region and in severely corrosive sulphuric <b>acid</b> <b>environments</b> (pH of less than 1, 00) commonly encountered in South African sewers. Calcium sulphate, which precipitates in a sulphuric acid solution and masks further attack, is eliminated simulating the constant dissolution of the precipitate at the average daily sewage level region and loosely attached precipitate in the severely corrosive sewer environments. A straightforward procedure is used to determine the acid resistance of dolomite aggregate concrete used in the manufacture of sewer pipes for exposure to sulphuric <b>acid</b> sewer <b>environments.</b> <b>Acid</b> resistance and neutralisation capacity of the concrete are measured as functions of mass loss and hydrogen ion consumption with time (over a period of approximately 96 hours or less). A procedure to determine the acid resistance of siliceous aggregate concrete requires a longer test period (approximately 200 hours or more). A concrete containing calcium aluminate cement and a synthetic alag™ aggregate made from the calcium aluminate cement clinker gave the best resistance to the hydrochloric acid solution (pH of 1, 00) and a severely corrosive biologically-induced sulphuric <b>acid</b> <b>environment</b> (pH of less than 1, 00). A similar concrete containing dolomite aggregate gave poorer resistance to the respective solutions. A dolomite aggregate concrete containing calcium aluminate cement gave better resistance in the biologically-induced sulphuric <b>acid</b> <b>environment</b> than a similar concrete containing ordinary portland cement but both concretes were of similar resistance in the hydrochloric acid solution. A poor quality dolomite stone (low strength and high porosity), which fractures during pipe manufacture gave poorer resistance in the hydrochloric solution than a concrete containing a sound dolomite stone but better resistance in the biologically-induced sulphuric <b>acid</b> <b>environment.</b> Concrete containing siliceous aggregate gave the poorest resistance to both the acidic <b>environments.</b> Assessing <b>acid</b> resistance using the hydrochloric acid solution test method illustrates {{the manner in which the}} physical and chemical properties influences the attack and dissolution of concrete in an acidic environment, which is crucial in the development of a sewer pipe concrete to resist and neutralise a biologically-induced sulphuric <b>acid</b> sewer <b>environment...</b>|$|R

In order {{to study the}} strength degradation, E-glass fibers were immersed in sulfuric acid. Strength reduction, stiffness, and fracture strain of fibers vs. immersion times were studied. The corrosion mechanism of E-glass fiber exposed to acid, were examined by quantitative X-ray fluorescencemethod. The results showed that corrosion of E-glass fiber was accompanied by removal of Al, Ca, and Fe ions from the fibers. Moreover, intact and degraded fiberswere examined by scanning electronmicroscope and energy dispersiveX-ray (EDX) microanalysismethods to show {{the relation between the}} reaction of E-glass fiber elements and <b>acid</b> <b>environment.</b> The ion-depletion-depth model was used to study the fracture process. The results showed that by increasing the immersion time in acid, spiral stress induced due to the shrinkage of E-glass fiber surface caused axial cracks in fibers.

40|$|It {{is widely}} {{held that the}} {{penetration}} of cells by alphaviruses is dependent on exposure to the <b>acid</b> <b>environment</b> of an endosome. The alphavirus Sindbis virus replicates in both vertebrate and invertebrate cell cultures. We have found that exposure to an <b>acid</b> <b>environment</b> may not be required for infection of cells of the insect host. In this work, we investigated the effects of two agents (NH 4 Cl and chloroquine), which raise the pH of intracellular compartments (lysosomotropic weak bases) on the infection and replication of Sindbis virus in cells of the insect host Aedes albopictus. The results show that both of these agents increase the pH of endosomes, as indicated by protection against diphtheria toxin intoxication. NH 4 Cl blocked the production of infectious virus and blocked virus RNA synthesis when added prior to infection. Chloroquine, in contrast to its effect on vertebrate cells, had no inhibitory effect on infectious virus production in mosquito cells even when added prior to infection. Treatment with NH 4 Cl did not prevent the penetration of virus RNA into the cell cytoplasm or translation of the RNA to produce a precursor to virus nonstructural proteins. These data suggest that while these two drugs raise the pH of endosomes, they do not block insect cell penetration. These data support previous results published by our laboratory suggesting that exposure to an <b>acid</b> <b>environment</b> within the cell {{may not be an}} obligatory step in the process of infection of cells by alphaviruses...|$|R
