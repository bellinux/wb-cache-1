5|$|Deficiencies in {{vanadium}} {{result in}} reduced growth in rats. The U.S. Institute of Medicine has not confirmed that vanadium {{is an essential}} nutrient for humans, so neither a Recommended Dietary Intake nor <b>an</b> <b>Adequate</b> Intake have been established.

5|$|Well-known human vitamin {{deficiencies}} involve thiamine (beriberi), niacin (pellagra), vitamin C (scurvy), {{and vitamin}} D (rickets).
