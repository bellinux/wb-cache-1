5|$|Diefenbaker's {{successful}} leadership race {{had been}} run by Allister Grosart, an executive for McKim Advertising Ltd. Soon {{after taking the}} leadership, Diefenbaker got Grosart to help out at Tory headquarters, and soon appointed him national director {{of the party and}} national campaign manager. Grosart appointed <b>a</b> <b>national</b> <b>campaign</b> committee, something which had not been done previously by the Tories, but which, according to Grosart, provided the organizational key to success in 1957. The party was ill-financed, having only $1,000,000 to wage the campaign—half what it had in 1953. Grosart divided most of that money equally by constituency, to the disgruntlement of Quebec Tories, who were used to receiving a disproportionate share of the national party's financing.|$|E
