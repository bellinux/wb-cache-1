5|$|Having no {{children}} of his own, David adopted his kinsman, the young prince Bagrat, heir to the Bagratid throne of Kartli (Iberia). He did so {{at the request of}} the energetic Georgian nobleman Iovane Marushis-dze. Through his fortunate bloodlines Bagrat was destined to sit upon two thrones. Furthermore, through his mother Gurandukht, sister of the childless <b>Abkhazian</b> king Theodosius III, Bagrat was a potential heir to the realm of Abkhazia. Making a plan for the creation of an all-Georgian state, David occupied Kartli for his foster-son in 976 and repulsed the troops from the easternmost Georgian kingdom of Kakheti, which had recently occupied the western sector of Kartli with its rock-hewn city of Uplistsikhe. Two years later, in 978, David and Marushis-dze secured the crown of Abkhazia for Bagrat by displacing Theodosius III.|$|E
5|$|The main {{legacy of}} the SSR Abkhazia is that it created, {{for the first time}} in modern history, a defined {{geographic}} entity under the name Abkhazia. The Abkhaz people were cognizant of their republic and its quasi-independent status, and though it was removed in 1931 they did not forget that it had existed. The SSR Abkhazia would take a prominent role during the glasnost and perestroika era of the late 1980s, as Abkhaz leaders called for their state to once again be formed and break away from Georgia, citing the SSR Abkhazia as a precedent. This led to them restoring the 1925 SSR <b>Abkhazian</b> constitution, which ultimately led to the 1992–1993 war between Abkhazia and Georgia, and the modern Abkhaz–Georgian conflict.|$|E
