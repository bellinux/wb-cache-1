5|$|An autocannon is {{a cannon}} {{with a larger}} caliber than <b>a</b> <b>machine</b> gun, but smaller {{than that of a}} field gun. Autocannons have {{mechanisms}} to automatically load their ammunition, and therefore have a faster rate of fire than artillery, often approaching—and, in the case of Gatling guns, surpassing—that of <b>a</b> <b>machine</b> gun. The traditional minimum bore for autocannon—indeed, for all types of cannon, as autocannon are the lowest-caliber pieces—has remained 20mm, since World War II.|$|E

5|$|Autocannons have an {{automatic}} firing mode, {{similar to that}} of <b>a</b> <b>machine</b> gun. They have mechanisms to automatically load their ammunition, and therefore have a higher rate of fire than artillery, often approaching, or, in the case of rotary autocannons, even surpassing the firing rate of <b>a</b> <b>machine</b> gun. While there is no minimum bore for autocannons, they are generally larger than machine guns, typically 20mm or greater since World War II and are usually capable of using explosive ammunition even if it isn't always used. Machine guns in contrast are usually too small to use explosive ammunition.|$|E

5|$|Coronary artery {{bypass surgery}} {{is one such}} operation. In this operation, one or more arteries {{surrounding}} the heart that have become narrowed are bypassed.

Because this operation involves the heart tissue, <b>a</b> <b>machine</b> is used so that blood can bypass the heart during the operation.|$|E
