Republicans called attention to Murphy's failure {{to pay taxes on}} <b>a</b> <b>start-up</b> computer software company he had founded in the 1990s, drawing comparison to three high-profile Obama administration nominees who failed to pay all of their taxes. Tedisco also called attention to Murphy's failure to regularly vote in elections after the National Republican Congressional Committee (NRCC) announced that Murphy had failed to vote in the 2000 presidential election, along with seven other primaries and general elections between 2000 and 2003. Believing the negative ads run by the NRCC were responsible for his drop in the polls, Tedisco announced that he would take control of campaign advertising from the NRCC.|$|E

5|$|Jones {{was accused}} (in a lawsuit brought by Mona Brewer against Earl Paulk of Chapel Hill Harvester Church) of using {{money from a}} $125 million green space bond sale to {{purchase}} a Decatur, GA church building from Paulk for $2.4 million, a sum claimed to be unjustifiably {{in excess of the}} land's actual value. The County made no use of the property, and was the building was later leased to <b>a</b> <b>start-up</b> cable network for a token sum of a dollar per year. During the ensuing court case, the plaintiff alleged that, as part of a questionable relationship, Paulk arranged for a sexual encounter between Jones and one of Paulk's former mistresses. When deposed, Jones refused to answer questions relating to that incident, {{as well as a number}} of other questions involving his dealings with Paulk. That case was ultimately withdrawn by the plaintiff's attorney, Louis Levenson, who felt that the judge in the case was biased against his client. The case was subsequently refiled and drew a different judge.|$|E
40|$|A firm’s {{competence}} base {{is considered}} an important driver of its performance. For start-ups, such competence base coincides with the aggregate of the knowledge, capabilities and expertise of theirs founders. To successfully compete in the market, such competences need to be both heterogeneous and advanced. However, we theorize a trade-off between <b>a</b> <b>start-up’s</b> competence base degrees of depth and heterogeneity. In addition, since heterogeneous competences imply a certain diversity of background, perspectives and education among start-ups’ cofounders, these may produce conflict and misunderstandings that may damage <b>a</b> <b>start-up’s</b> expected performance. Thus, we contend that the established positive effect of advanced competences on expected performance {{is partly due to}} a lower degree of competence heterogeneity. We test our model on a large-scale sample of 1690 start-ups and find support for our hypotheses. Our results suggest that, at least in the first moments of <b>a</b> <b>start-up’s</b> life, competence heterogeneity would be better to be limited...|$|R

After an affirmative response from Cartoon Network president Betty Cohen, the legal paperwork and deal-making began, followed by <b>a</b> <b>start-up</b> meeting at the Chateau Marmont Hotel in Los Angeles. A deal was made that Antonucci's studio, a.k.a. Cartoon, would produce Ed, Edd n Eddy, the first Cartoon Network original series to be produced by an outside production company rather than Cartoon Network's Hanna-Barbera. The series also entered production and bypassed a seven-minute short; this marked the first time that one of the studio's original series had ever done this.|$|E
5|$|Braid was {{originally}} {{developed as a}} Windows title with possible console versions, though Blow was not committed to releasing either a PC or console version first. Blow signed up with Microsoft to release the game on Xbox Live in mid-2007, with that version officially announced at the 2007 Tokyo Game Show. Blow was critical of the Xbox Live certification process, as he believed the effort to meet all the requirements could have been better spent on polishing the game. At the same time, the certification team allowed him to retain certain aspects of his vision for the game that were otherwise contrary to the process, including giving the player immediate control of the game instead of requiring <b>a</b> <b>start-up</b> title screen. Microsoft also requested that Blow include some additional hints to the player based on results of playtesting, but Blow held his ground, refusing to release the game if {{he was forced to}} add these. He said he would likely not release a game again on the Xbox Live service under the same business model. Blow later released a Braid theme for Xbox Live; though he wanted to release this theme for free, Microsoft required the theme to be priced at a nominal level.|$|E

40|$|While the {{majority}} of existing studies on the determinants of post-entry firm growth focus {{on the role of}} the founders or on the impact of firm-specific characteristics like size, age or industry affiliation, a possible impact of the characteristics of <b>a</b> <b>start-up's</b> workforce on post-entry growth has been widely neglected in the literature so far. Based upon a comprehensive panel dataset of establishments in Germany, this paper contributes to fill this gap and examines the role of the initial employment structure with respect to qualification, age, gender and nationality for post-entry employment growth measured both in terms of employees and in terms of fulltime equivalents. Moreover, it is analyzed whether the use of flexible work forms like regular part-time and / or marginal employment in the year of foundation affects post-entry growth. Our empirical results confirm that in particular the initial qualification structure of <b>a</b> <b>start-up's</b> employees matters for post-entry growth. Establishments using flexible work forms show higher post-entry growth with respect to total hours worked, but a significantly lower growth with respect to the number of employees...|$|R
