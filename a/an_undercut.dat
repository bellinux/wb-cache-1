500|$|Of Portland stone construction, the {{memorial}} {{is in the}} form of a [...] high, lozenge-shaped shaft with short, chamfered arms, moulded where they meet the shaft to form a cross. The cross stands on a base of four uneven rectangular blocks, below which is <b>an</b> <b>undercut</b> square platform, which itself stands on two square blocks. At the very bottom are two wide, shallow steps. The largest block of the base bears the only inscription on {{the memorial}}: [...] "TO THE CITIZENS OF YORK 1914 – 1918, 1939 – 1945" [...] on the south face, and [...] "THEIR NAME LIVETH FOR EVERMORE" [...] on the north; the dates of the Second World War were added later. As a memento, a bottle, several coins, and a newspaper were placed inside the structure. The memorial stands in a war memorial garden on the south bank of the River Ouse; it overlooks the river and the ruins of St Mary's Abbey on the opposite bank.|$|E
500|$|When {{the race}} started at 14:00 local time (...) , Kimi Räikkönen managed to pass both Williams {{cars on the}} first lap to move up to fourth, while Nico Rosberg was able to fend off Sebastian Vettel for second. On the second lap, Carlos Sainz Jr. spun his Toro Rosso and dropped down the order. Nico Hülkenberg became the first {{retirement}} on lap ten, when he parked his Force India in the gravel after his gearbox failed. During the pit stops, Ferrari attempted <b>an</b> <b>undercut</b> by pitting Sebastian Vettel early on lap 13, a strategy in which a car running behind is pitting early {{in order to use}} a fast out-lap on fresh tyres to jump ahead of a rival without having to overtake them on track. However this was unsuccessful as Mercedes reacted by pitting Rosberg the following lap, allowing Rosberg to maintain track position over Vettel. On lap 17, Daniil Kvyat retired from the race when his Red Bull started to smoke.|$|E

500|$|At {{the podium}} interviews, {{conducted}} by former team owner Eddie Jordan, Sebastian Vettel described the race {{as one of}} his best ever, calling it [...] "a great day; we had a really great weekend". He also revealed that his drink bottle had failed halfway into the race, causing him to become thirsty as drivers lose two to three litres in sweat during the Singapore race. Second placed Daniel Ricciardo said he felt that <b>an</b> <b>undercut,</b> overtaking Vettel by pitting earlier might have been possible {{had it not been for}} the safety car periods. Kimi Räikkönen expressed surprise at his performance, considering that he had struggled with the handling of the car both in qualifying and the race. Speaking about the track intruder, Sebastian Vettel stated at the post-race press conference that he [...] "saw him taking a picture" [...] and continued: [...] "I hope it was a good one at least. I hope it was in focus! Yeah, pretty crazy, we approach that corner at around 280–290 klicks so, I don't know, I wouldn't cross the track if I was him. It was crazy, obviously [...]" [...] The intruder was later revealed to be 27-year-old British citizen Yogvitam Pravin Dhokia. He appeared in court on the Tuesday following the race and was offered a bail of , which he was unable to pay. He was later sentenced to serve six weeks in jail.|$|E
2500|$|On {{turned parts}} <b>an</b> <b>undercut</b> {{is also known}} as a neck or [...] "relief groove". They are often used {{at the end of the}} {{threaded}} portion of a shaft or screw to provide clearance for the cutting tool, and also referred to as thread relief in this context. A rule of thumb is that the undercut should be at least 1.5 threads long and the diameter should be at least [...] smaller than the minor diameter of the thread. Strictly speaking the relief simply needs to be equal or slightly smaller than the minor diameter of the thread. [...] Thread relief can also be internal on a bore, and then the relief needs to be larger than the major thread diameter. [...] They are also often used on shafts that have diameter changes so that a mating part can seat against the shoulder. If <b>an</b> <b>undercut</b> is not provided there is always a small radius left behind even if a sharp corner is intended. These types of undercuts are called out on technical drawings by stating the width and either the depth or the diameter of the bottom of the neck.|$|E
2500|$|In manufacturing, <b>an</b> <b>undercut</b> is {{a special}} type of {{recessed}} surface. In turning, it refers to a recess in a diameter. In machining, it refers to a recess in a corner. In molding, it refers to a feature that cannot be molded using only a single pull mold. In printed circuit board, construction {{it refers to the}} portion of the copper that is etched away under the photoresist. In welding, it refers to undesired melting and removal of metal near the weld bead.|$|E

The approach is modeled after Plantinga’s evolutionary argument against naturalism. The first step is to show that Mormon cosmology is relevantly like naturalism. The second step is to show that the origin of human persons ins relevantly similar to naturalistic evolution so that it faces the same kind of defeaters as the conjunction of naturalism and naturalistic evolution...|$|R
5000|$|Labor {{finds this}} {{desirable}} {{because it can}} point to the increased wages it offers as signs of its achievement, and labor receives more money. Capitalists may find this desirable because there are [...] "worse alternatives," [...] i.e., strikes, workplace disruptions, etc. Furthermore, it acts {{as a barrier to}} entry against upstart firms. If all firms are required to pay higher than normal wages, it is difficult to compete on price, and an employer can take out <b>an</b> <b>undercutting</b> competitor by encouraging strikes. In this arrangement, consumers of the industry lose.|$|R
2500|$|The Native American flute is {{the only}} flute in the world {{constructed}} with two air chambers - there is a wall inside the flute between the top (slow) air chamber and the bottom chamber which has the whistle and finger holes. The top chamber {{also serves as a}} secondary resonator, which gives the flute its distinctive sound. There is a hole {{at the bottom of the}} [...] "slow" [...] air chamber and a (generally) square hole at the top of the playing chamber. A block (or [...] "bird") with a spacer is tied on top of the flute to form a thin, flat airstream for the whistle hole (or [...] "window"). Some more modern flutes use <b>an</b> <b>undercut</b> either in the block or the flute to eliminate the need for a spacer.|$|E

50|$|The {{knocking}} player then subtracts {{his or her}} deadwood {{points from}} the defending player's deadwood points. The result {{is the number of}} points the knocking player receives. <b>An</b> <b>undercut</b> occurs if a player knocks and the defending player's deadwood points are {{less than or equal to}} the knocking player's. In this case the defending player receives <b>an</b> <b>undercut</b> bonus (usually 25 points) plus the difference in deadwood points. If the defending player has less or equal deadwood to the knocking player's deadwood after laying off any of his or her deadwood, then it is still a valid undercut.|$|E
50|$|Plasma etching can be isotropic, i.e., exhibiting <b>a</b> lateral <b>undercut</b> rate on <b>a</b> {{patterned}} surface {{approximately the same}} as its downward etch rate, or can be anisotropic, i.e., exhibiting <b>a</b> smaller lateral <b>undercut</b> rate than its downward etch rate. Such anisotropy is maximized in deep reactive ion etching. The {{use of the term}} anisotropy for plasma etching should not be conflated {{with the use of the}} same term when referring to orientation-dependent etching.|$|R
50|$|The Natural Bridge is a {{naturally}} formed rock arch over Cave Creek, {{a tributary of}} the Nerang River.

40|$|The {{realization}} of mechanical decoupling zones around a membrane to reduce package stresses is presented. Wet-isotropic etching with a nitric/fluoridic solution (HNO 3 /HF/H 2 O) {{as well as}} reactive-ion etching (RIE) with a sulphurhexafluoride/oxygen (SF 6 /O 2) plasma are investigated to realize deep circular grooves. The shape of the {{cross section of the}} groove, which determines the shape of the decoupling zone, can be controlled using the RIE method by changing the etch conditions. It is shown that <b>a</b> large <b>undercut</b> at low pressures as well as <b>a</b> small <b>undercut</b> at high pressures is possible with a SF 6 /O 2 plasma, leading to round or steep sidewalls of the grooves, respectively. Finally a completed bare structure containing a membrane and a surrounding decoupling zone is presented...|$|R

Hamilton tried to open up a gap in order to cover his position, should the Ferrari drivers attempt <b>a</b> so-called <b>undercut,</b> <b>a</b> strategy in which a car entered the pit lane early in order to use fresher tyres to get in front of another car without overtaking them on track.
