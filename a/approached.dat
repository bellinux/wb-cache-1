5|$|Director Wes Anderson first <b>approached</b> actors Schwartzman and Portman about Hotel Chevalier in 2005. Schwartzman and Anderson had {{previously}} worked on Rushmore (1998), Anderson's cult second feature, {{and had been}} living together in Schwartzman's Paris apartment {{in the months leading}} up to the shoot. Portman was <b>approached</b> after the director obtained her email address from Scott Rudin, producer of 2004's Closer in which she starred. The actors appeared for free, and Anderson financed the remainder of the production himself.|$|E

50|$|The Initial <b>Approach</b> Fix (IAF) is {{the point}} where the initial <b>approach</b> segment of an {{instrument}} <b>approach</b> begins. An instrument <b>approach</b> procedure may have more than one Initial <b>approach</b> fix and initial <b>approach</b> segment. The initial <b>approach</b> fix is usually a designated intersection, VOR, NDB, or DME fix. The initial <b>approach</b> fix may be collocated with the intermediate fix (IF) of the instrument <b>approach</b> and in such case they designate the beginning of the intermediate segment of the <b>approach.</b> When initial <b>approach</b> fix, and intermediate fix are combined there is no initial <b>approach</b> segment.|$|R

30|$|Two {{commonly}} used <b>approaches</b> in THA are the Moore <b>approach</b> (posterior <b>approach)</b> and the modified Hardinge <b>approach</b> (direct lateral <b>approach)</b> (Pellicci et al. 1998; Hardinge 1982; Finnish Arthroplasty society 2015; Madsen et al. 2004). Other possible <b>approaches</b> are the Smith-Petersen direct anterior <b>approach</b> and the Watson-Jones anterolateral <b>approach</b> (Smith-Petersen 1949; Watson-Jones 1934). Chechik et al. surveyed 292 orthopedic surgeons from 57 countries {{and found that}} the posterior <b>approach</b> was used by 45 % and the direct lateral <b>approach</b> by 42 %. The anterior <b>approach</b> was used by 10 % of the surgeons and other <b>approaches</b> by 3 % (Chechik et al. 2013).|$|R

5|$|A {{joint line}} through the Denburn Valley to link the Great North to the south had been planned, and the Great North had <b>approached</b> the {{railways}} using the Guild Street station in 1853 and 1857 but were unhappy with the assistance that had been offered. Permission was granted in 1861 to the Inverness & Perth Junction Railway to build a line from , on the Inverness & Aberdeen Junction Railway, direct to Perth. The Great North protested, and won the right for a booking office in Inverness. The line opened in 1863 and in 1865 the Inverness & Perth Junction and Inverness & Aberdeen Junction merged to become the Highland Railway. The Aberdeen Railway, which had now been absorbed by the Scottish North Eastern Railway (SNER), <b>approached</b> the Great North, concerned that the new line had bypassed Aberdeen, but no agreement was reached.|$|E
30|$|For pushing recommendations, {{four types}} of <b>approach</b> are identified. They are preference-based <b>approach</b> [46], {{knowledge-based}} <b>approach</b> [4, 5], content-based <b>approach</b> [47] and hybrid <b>approach.</b>|$|R
50|$|There are {{two main}} <b>approaches</b> in {{educational}} research. The first is a basic <b>approach.</b> This <b>approach</b> is {{also referred to as}} an academic research <b>approach.</b> The second <b>approach</b> is applied research or a contract research <b>approach.</b> Both of these <b>approaches</b> have different purposes which influence the nature of the respective research.|$|R
30|$|There {{are several}} <b>approaches</b> in {{classifying}} intended touches and unintended touches. Annett et al. [5] have researched such <b>approaches</b> {{and made a}} comparison. They categorized the various <b>approaches</b> in four types: user adaptions, firmware <b>approaches,</b> operating system <b>approaches</b> and application-specific <b>approaches.</b> Schwarz et al. [6] categorized existing <b>approaches</b> into hardware solution and software solution.|$|R
5|$|A second station, {{later called}} Shepton Mallet (Charlton Road), opened in 1874 with the {{building}} of the Bath extension of the Somerset and Dorset Joint Railway. This station was some distance east of the centre of the town and was <b>approached</b> on the Charlton Viaduct.|$|E
5|$|About 40 {{years after}} the Persian conquest of Ionia, and in {{the reign of the}} fourth Persian king, Darius the Great, the {{stand-in}} Milesian tyrant Aristagoras found himself in this familiar predicament. In 500 BC, Aristagoras was <b>approached</b> by some exiles from Naxos, who asked him {{to take control of the}} island. Seeing an opportunity to strengthen his position in Miletus by conquering Naxos, Aristagoras <b>approached</b> the satrap of Lydia, Artaphernes, proposing a joint attack on Naxos, to which Artaphernes assented.|$|E

50|$|Planning {{theory is}} the body of {{scientific}} concepts, definitions, behavioral relationships, and assumptions that define the body of knowledge of urban planning. There are eight procedural theories of planning that remain the principal theories of planning procedure today: the rational-comprehensive <b>approach,</b> the incremental <b>approach,</b> the transactive <b>approach,</b> the communicative <b>approach,</b> the advocacy <b>approach,</b> the equity <b>approach,</b> the radical <b>approach,</b> and the humanist or phenomenological <b>approach.</b>|$|R
40|$|To {{be able to}} {{understand}} the value of integrating advanced technologies into existing technology education programmes, it is necessary to look at the features of various <b>approaches</b> that can be distinguished in various countries. Here eight <b>approaches</b> are described: the craft oriented <b>approach,</b> the industrial production oriented <b>approach,</b> the applied science <b>approach,</b> the high tech <b>approach,</b> the engineering concepts <b>approach,</b> the design <b>approach,</b> the key qualifications <b>approach</b> and the Science and Technology in Society (STS} <b>approach.</b> For each of these <b>approaches</b> the presence of five main characteristics of technology are evaluated: the human aspect, matter/energy/information analyses, science-technology relationships, the process of designing-making-using, and social aspects. The integration of advanced technologies into these <b>approaches</b> can stimulate the enhancement of characteristics not present, or poorly represented, in the various <b>approaches...</b>|$|R
40|$|Some Japanese {{universities}} are considering changing from using traditional SLA <b>approaches</b> for language teaching and employing other <b>approaches,</b> like content-based <b>approaches</b> and immersion <b>approaches,</b> which are relatively new for Japan.

40|$|We {{propose a}} {{modified}} nonparametric Baumgartner–Weiß–Schindler test and investigate {{its use in}} testing for trends among K binomial populations. Exact conditional and unconditional <b>approaches</b> to p-value calculation are explored {{in conjunction with the}} statistic in addition to a similar test statistic proposed byNeuhäuser (2006), the unconditional <b>approaches</b> considered including the maximization <b>approach</b> (Basu, 1977), the confidence interval <b>approach</b> (Berger and Boos, 1994), and the E+M <b>approach</b> (Lloyd, 2008). The procedures are compared with regard to actual Type I error and power and examples are provided. The conditional <b>approach</b> and the E+M <b>approach</b> performed well, with the E+M <b>approach</b> having an actual level much closer to the nominal level. The E+M <b>approach</b> and the conditional <b>approach</b> are generally more powerful than the other p-value calculation <b>approaches</b> in the scenarios considered. The power difference between the conditional <b>approach</b> and the E+M <b>approach</b> is often small in the balance case. However, in the unbalanced case, the power comparison between those two <b>approaches</b> based on our proposed test statistic show that the E+M <b>approach</b> has higher power than the conditional <b>approach...</b>|$|R
5|$|As Näslund's {{free agency}} <b>approached</b> on 1 July 2008, Näslund {{made it clear}} that the style of play and the player {{personnel}} of a team would be important factors in determining which team he would sign with after his contract with the Canucks expired.

40|$|Since {{the first}} report of {{endoscopic}} subtotal parathyroidectomy in 1996, a variety of endoscopic surgical <b>approaches</b> has been reported. These endoscopic <b>approaches</b> include the minimally-invasive video-assisted thyroidectomy (MIVAT), the endoscopic lateral <b>approach,</b> the lateral mini-incision <b>approach,</b> the anterior/chest (hybrid) <b>approach,</b> the transaxillary <b>approach,</b> the axillobreast <b>approach,</b> the post-auricular and axillary <b>approach,</b> and other novel experimental <b>approaches.</b> Some of these <b>approaches</b> could {{be done with the}} assistance of the da Vinci robot (i. e. robotic-assisted thyroidectomy). For simplification, these <b>approaches</b> could be categorized into the cervical/direct <b>approach</b> and the extra-cervical/indirect <b>approach.</b> Each technique or <b>approach</b> has its own benefits and weaknesses. Currently, there is no preferred <b>approach</b> in the literature and the choice seems to be determined by the surgeon’s own experience and the patient’s preference. In our experience, the transaxillary <b>approach</b> was a technically more challenging procedure and was associated with longer hospital stay, longer operating time, more immediate pain, and increased overall RLN injury and morbidity than MIVAT. The 6 -month scar appearance and patient satisfaction were similar between the two procedures. postprin...|$|R
