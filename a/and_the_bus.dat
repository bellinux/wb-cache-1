5|$|From 1999 onwards, other railway {{companies}} received concessions for {{the northern}} railway lines of the Netherlands. NoordNed, a joint venture of the Nederlandse Spoorwegen and Arriva, provided the railway services to and from Winschoten between 2000 and 2005. The Ihrhove–Nieuweschans railway was closed for major renovations in the years 2000–2002. Arriva bought all shares of NoordNed in 2003, and rebranded the services as Arriva in 2005. In 2013–2015, the station building was restored to its state of 1904 {{as part of a}} larger project to improve the quality and functionality of the station area. Between December 2015 and October 2016, the Ihrhove–Nieuweschans railway was closed entirely after a railway bridge near Weener was destroyed in a collision with the ship Emsmoon.

5|$|M-66 was {{extended}} southerly from Assyria through Battle Creek to the Indiana state line replacing sections of M-78 in 1965. The US127 freeway was completed from Mason north to Lansing in 1966, adding the US127 designation along the I-496/M-78 freeway. The next year, M-78's freeway {{was extended}} eastward to I-75/US10/US23 in Flint. The US127/M-78 freeway was extended north of I-496 in 1969, and a discontinuous section of M-78 freeway east of Flint was completed {{around the same}} time frame. In 1970, the I-496 freeway was completed <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bus.</b> M-78 designation was removed through Lansing. In 1972, the highway was rerouted to run east of Bellevue to Olivet instead of northeast to Charlotte. The next year, all of M-78 northeast of Olivet was removed when I-69 between Charlotte and I-96 southwest of Lansing was completed; this truncation produced the modern routing of M-78 in the state.|$|E

This business loop existed until 1964. At that time, the bypass around Mason was upgraded to a full freeway with an interchange at Cedar Street northwest of downtown. Two segments of highway were turned over to local control at this time: the southern half of Bus. US127 along Hull Road and Jefferson Street as well as the section of Bus. US127/M-36 along Columbia Avenue. M-36 was extended northward along Cedar Street to the new interchange, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bus.</b> US127 designation was decommissioned.|$|E
5|$|A {{discontinuous}} {{section of}} M-78 freeway east of Flint {{was completed in}} 1969. The same year, I-475 was named the David Dunbar Buick Freeway, after the founder of Buick Motor Company in Flint; the same legislation, House Concurrent Resolution22 of 1969 named the M-78 freeway through Flint for Louis Chevrolet. In 1970, the I-496 freeway was completed <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bus.</b> M-78 designation was removed through Lansing. A freeway segment between Flint and Lapeer opened in 1971. M-21 was routed down M-13 to the new freeway where it joined the M-78 designation from M-13 east. The section of M-21 formerly between M-13 and Bus. M-54 was redesignated M-56. The M-78 designation was replaced by I-69 in 1973 after a Temporary I-69 (Temp. I-69) designation was extended northward from Charlotte through Lansing to Perry. On September 4 of that year, I-69's designation was officially extended by Congress to end at I-475 {{on the east side}} of Flint; this extension, and all subsequent ones, was of non-chargeable mileage, or segments not financed through the Interstate Highway fund.|$|E
