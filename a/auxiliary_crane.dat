40|$|The {{subject of}} this report is the upending of a {{floating}} monopile for an offshore wind turbine foundation. This is an assignment of Van Oord Dredging and Marine Contractors BV. An analytical model has been developed to simulate the upending of a monopile in MapleTM, based on the general theoretical principles {{and the experience of}} Van Oord. An experiment was then done to validate the analytical model. The MapleTM script can be used to calculate the forces of the crane for future projects. The monopile, sealed with two end-caps, is towed by a tugboat from the storage site to the installation site and is then upended by the jack-up vessel of Van Oord, the Aeolus. The end-caps guarantee buoyancy during transport and upending. After upending the end-caps are removed, either internally or externally. A conceptual design has been developed for both removal methods. With upending the vertical position of the monopile can be reached with a nett weight of the pile greater than the safe working load of the crane using the buoyant force. The minimum draught needed for the buoyant force to remain within the safe working load of the crane, determines the minimum hydrostatic pressure needed for the external removal of the bottom-cap. The top-cap can only be removed once the pile has been placed on the seabed, since the buoyant force is the <b>auxiliary</b> of the <b>crane.</b> As shown in figure 1, the upending of the monopile is performed, by vertically displacing the connection point between the pile and the crane. Because the crane hook is attached to the pile with a hinge, the monopile can rotate freely around this point. For the analytical model in MapleTM it is assumed that the upending process is quasi-static because the influence of the inertia is negligible. The experiment has confirmed that the inertia may indeed be neglected by showing the similarity between two scaled upending tests at different continuous hoisting velocities and the corresponding quasi-static simulation. Therefore the scaled upending correlates to the quasi-static model. It is found that, only when the lifting starts and stops, and respectively the acceleration and deceleration are relatively large, the inertia influences the upending process. Further research to refine the upending process, as well as the design of the end-caps is recommended. The hoisting speed of the crane can be optimized if the expectations of the experiment and the analytical model are confirmed in practice. The design depends on the airflow when releasing the end-cap and the internal pressure when lowering the pile towards the seabed. The internal pressure can be controlled using a pressure valve. These recommendations will lead to the optimized upending process of monopiles for offshore wind turbine foundations that are transported by towage using end-caps.

5000|$|Three {{vessels of}} the American President Lines {{had been built}} in 1966 as Type C4-S-1qa ships by National Steel and Shipbuilding, San Diego, California. Between 1972 and 1973 these breakbulk cargo vessels were {{converted}} into partial containerships. [...] The conversion work was done at Todd Pacific Shipyards, Seattle, Washington. Overall length was extended by 105 ft. Bow thrusters were also fitted into the ships for improved maneuverability along with an improved stabilization system. Between 1984-1986 all three vessels were acquired by the U.S.Navy and re-fitted as <b>Auxiliary</b> <b>Crane</b> Ships {{for use by the}} Military Sealift Command (C6-S-MA1qd).

40|$|In {{the paper}} a {{possible}} scenario for {{the occurrence of}} the local buckling of {{the wall of the}} thin walled aluminium mast is analysed. It is assumed that the hook of the <b>auxiliary</b> <b>crane</b> of the rubber-tired marine crane buckled to the lateral mast-supporting wire rope during the retrieval motion from the pier. The consequences of an unintended crane action on the mast of the sailing boat are studied using combination of analytical calculations and FEM. The complexity of the mast – mast wires system, the big displacements and non-linear material characteristics are taken into account. The properties of the tempered aluminium alloy are included as well as properties in the heat affected zone {{in the vicinity of the}} welds. On the basis of the calculated internal forces and moments in the mast and wire-ropes, the possibility of occurrence of different types of failure are studied. The estimated possible damages are compared with actual damages...|$|E
40|$|We {{present a}} virtual {{simulation}} of ships and ship-mounted cranes. The simulation {{is carried out}} in a Cave Automated Virtual Environment (CAVE). This simulation serves as a platform to study the dynamics of ships and ship-mounted cranes under dynamic sea environments and as a training platform for ship-mounted crane operators. A model of the (<b>Auxiliary</b> <b>Crane</b> Ship) T-ACS 4 - 6 was built, converted into an OpenGL C++ API, and then ported into the CAVE using DiverseGL (DGL). A six-degrees-of-freedom motion base was used to simulate the actual motion of the ship. The equations of motion of the ship are solved using the Large Amplitude Motion Program (LAMP), while the equations of motion of the crane payload are numerically integrated; {{the interaction between the}} payload and the ship is taken into consideration. A nonlinear delayed-position feedback-control system is applied to the crane and the resulting simulation is used to compare the controlled and uncontrolled pendulations of the cargo. Our simulator showed a great deal of realism and was used to simulate different ship-motion and cargo transfer scenarios...|$|E
40|$|Ship-mounted cranes {{are used}} to {{transfer}} cargo from large container ships to smaller lighters when deep-water ports are not available. The wave-induced motion of the crane ship produces large pendulations of hoisted cargo and causes operations to be suspended. In this work, we show that in boom type ship-mounted cranes, {{it is possible to}} reduce these pendulations signicantly by controlling the slew and lu angles of the boom. Such a control can be achieved with the heavy equipment that is already part of the crane so that retrotting existing cranes would require a small eort. Moreover, the control is superimposed on the commands of the operator transparently. The successful control strategy is based on delayed-position feedback of the cargo motion in-plane and out-of-plane of the boom and crane tower. Its eectiveness is demonstrated with a fully nonlinear three-dimensional computer simulation and with an experiment on a 1 / 24 scale model of a T-ACS (The <b>Auxiliary</b> <b>Crane</b> Ship) crane mounted on a platform moving with three degrees of freedom to simulate the ship roll, pitch, and heave motions of the crane ship. The results demonstrate that the pendulations can be signicantly reduced, and therefore the range of sea conditions in which cargo-transfer operations could take place can be greatly expanded...|$|E
40|$|Debris {{analysis}} {{suggests that the}} damages in the SPROB plant had taken place due to continuous burning of the propellant. There were no evidences of explosion {{at any given time}} during the accident. Analysis also showed that the most probable location of ignition was at the west of the propellant segment near the bottom ring. Immediately after ignition, the maraging steel shell got punctured resulting in escaping of the flame and the hot gases through this opening towards the west. The excessive heat at this location has resulted in the melting of the west legs of the stool and as a result the whole assembly had tilted towards the west. As the burning progressed, the propellant moved towards the west continuously because of the tilt and in the process it got separated from the steel shell at the east. While the damages continued to be more at the west, the east was protected because of the undamaged portion of the shell. As the heat generated was more at the west, the rope of the <b>auxiliary</b> <b>crane</b> hook got melted first and had fallen on the floor in between the stool and the working platform. Evidences suggest that the top ring was anchored with east and west tackles of the main crane. Subsequently, the rope with the west tackle got melted. This had created an imbalance resulting in rotation of the top ring in anticlockwise direction leading to the tearing of the maraging steel shell in the same direction along the circumference with the bottom ring. The rotation was also associated with a swing because of which the top ring along with the shell was thrown towards the southwest direction with respect to the propellant burning site. Falling of the main crane hook appears to be the last event. It is not possible at this stage to postulate the exact reason for ignition...|$|E
