5|$|The armies stared <b>at</b> <b>one</b> <b>another</b> in a {{heavy rain}} across the bloody fields on July 4, {{the same day that}} the Vicksburg {{garrison}} surrendered to Maj. Gen. Ulysses S. Grant. Lee had reformed his lines into a defensive position on Seminary Ridge the night of July 3, evacuating the town of Gettysburg. The Confederates remained on the battlefield, hoping that Meade would attack, but the cautious Union commander decided against the risk, a decision for which he would later be criticized. Both armies began to collect their remaining wounded and bury some of the dead. A proposal by Lee for a prisoner exchange was rejected by Meade.|$|E
5|$|By 08:00, it {{was clear}} that despite his vessels speed, Stewart's plan was going to fail: the captains of Charlton and United Kingdom had not even {{attempted}} to join his advance, deliberately checking their advance towards the French, falling far behind Windham. Although Stewart now faced overwhelming odds, he had no option but to continue the attack: his ship was now too close to attempt to flee from the French frigate. Captain Dornal de Guy opened fire at 09:30, his shot repeatedly striking Windham as she approached. Stewart did not return fire, instead waiting until his ship was closer to minimise the inaccuracy of his gunnery. Unable to reach the more nimble French ship directly, Stewart absorbed the French fire until he was as close as he was able before unleashing his guns. The results were disappointing: the entire broadside splashed into the sea far short of the French ship. The more manoeuvrable Manche now approached Windham at close range, and the two ships fired <b>at</b> <b>one</b> <b>another</b> for over an hour, Stewart still unsupported by his companions, who did no more than fire the occasional ineffective shot at extreme range.|$|E
5|$|Earp {{was named}} deputy sheriff {{in the area}} {{including}} newly incorporated Kootenai County, Idaho, which was disputing jurisdiction of Eagle City with Shoshone County. There were {{a considerable number of}} disagreements over mining claims and property rights, which Earp had a part in. On March 28, several feet of snow were still on the ground. Bill Buzzard, a miner of dubious reputation, began constructing a building when one of Wyatt's partners, Jack Enright, tried to stop the construction. Enright claimed the building was on part of his property. Words were exchanged and Buzzard reached for his Winchester. He fired several shots at Enright and a skirmish developed. Allies of both sides quickly took defensive positions between snowbanks and began shooting <b>at</b> <b>one</b> <b>another.</b> Deputy Sheriff Wyatt Earp and his brother James stepped {{into the middle of the}} fray and helped peacefully resolve the dispute before anyone was seriously hurt. Shoshone County Deputy W. E. Hunt then arrived and ordered the parties to turn over their weapons.|$|E

5|$|Nauendorf {{continued}} his raids, the soldiers foraged {{for food and}} dug up the local potato crop, and Joseph and Frederick glared <b>at</b> <b>one</b> <b>another</b> by Königgrätz. Maria Theresa had sent Kaunitz on a secret mission to Berlin to offer a truce. In a second trip, she offered a settlement, and finally wrote to Catherine in Russia to ask for assistance. When Joseph discovered his mother's maneuvering behind his back, he furiously offered to resign. His mother enlisted the assistance she needed. Catherine offered to mediate the dispute; if her assistance was unacceptable, {{she was willing to}} send fifty thousand troops to augment the Prussian force, {{despite the fact that she}} disliked Frederick and her alliance with him was strictly defensive. Frederick withdrew portions of his force in mid-September. In October, Joseph withdrew most of his army to the Bohemian border and Frederick withdrew his remaining troops into Prussia. Two small forces of hussars and dragoons remained in Bohemia to provide a winter cordon; these forces allowed Joseph and Frederick to keep an eye on each other while their diplomats negotiated at Teschen.|$|E
5|$|Seine had a rapid passage back to European waters, {{arriving}} in the Bay of Biscay on 28 June. Early the following morning, with the Brittany coast in sight, Seine was spotted by the inshore frigate squadron of HMS Jason, HMS Pique and HMS Mermaid. While Mermaid cut Seine off from the coast, Jason and Pique gave chase as Seine fled southwards. Pique reached Seine at 23:00 that evening and {{for more than two}} and a half hours the frigates pounded <b>at</b> <b>one</b> <b>another</b> until Pique fell back. Pique and Jason continued the chase full speed through the night, until suddenly all three frigates crashed headlong into the sandbanks off La Tranche-sur-Mer on the Vendée coast. Even while grounded the frigates continued to fire on one another until Mermaid finally arrived and the outnumbered Seine surrendered. Jason and Seine were badly damaged but successfully refloated, the casualties on the packed decks of the French ship appallingly high, but Pique was an irretrievable wreck: the ship was evacuated and then burnt before the remainder of the squadron returned to Britain with their prize.|$|E
5|$|While pre-dreadnoughts {{were adopted}} worldwide, {{there were no}} clashes between pre-dreadnought battleships {{until the very end}} of their period of dominance. The First Sino-Japanese War in 1894–95 {{influenced}} pre-dreadnought development, but this had been a clash between Chinese battleships and a Japanese fleet consisting of mostly cruisers. The Spanish–American War of 1898 was also a mismatch, with the American pre-dreadnought fleet engaging Spanish cruisers. Not until the Russo-Japanese War of 1904–05 did pre-dreadnoughts engage on an equal footing. This happened in three battles: the Russian tactical victory during the Battle of Port Arthur on 8–9 February 1904, the indecisive Battle of the Yellow Sea on 10 August 1904, and the decisive Japanese victory at the Battle of Tsushima on 27 May 1905. These battles upended prevailing theories of how naval battles would be fought, as the fleets began firing <b>at</b> <b>one</b> <b>another</b> at much greater distances than before; naval architects realized that plunging fire (explosive shells falling on their targets largely from above, instead of from a trajectory close to horizontal) was a much greater threat than had been thought.|$|E

25|$|The mythic theme {{passed into}} Etruscan culture: a fifth-century bronze mirrorback is inscribed with Fulnice (Polynices) and Evtucle (Eteocles) running <b>at</b> <b>one</b> <b>another</b> with drawn swords. A {{particularly}} gruesome detail from the battle, in which Tydeus gnawed {{on the living}} brain of Melanippos {{in the course of}} the siege, also appears, in a sculpted terracotta relief from a temple at Pyrgi, ca. 470–460 BC.|$|E

25|$|In 68 AD, {{there was}} growing unrest in Jerusalem. Ananus ben Ananus incited {{the people to}} rise up against the Zealots, who were robbing the people and using the Temple of Jerusalem as their base of operations. Ben Hanan began to recruit for armed conflict. The Zealots, who were {{quartered}} in the Temple, learned that ben Hanan was preparing for battle, and sallied forth, attacking all in their way. Ben Hanan quickly organized the people against them. The skirmish began with the belligerents throwing rocks <b>at</b> <b>one</b> <b>another,</b> then javelins, then finally hand-to-hand combat with swords ensued. Eventually the Zealots retreated to the inner court of the Temple, and 6,000 of Ben Hanan's men held the first (outer) court.|$|E
25|$|Charismatic Andrew Jackson, by contrast, in {{collaboration}} with strategist Martin Van Buren rallied his followers in the newly emerging Democratic Party. In the election of 1828, Jackson defeated Adams by an overwhelming electoral majority in the first presidential election since 1800 to mark a wholesale voter rejection of the previous administration's policies. The electoral campaign was correspondingly as vicious as the one 28 years earlier, with Jackson and Adams's camps hurtling the worst mudslinging accusations <b>at</b> <b>one</b> <b>another.</b> The former painted himself as a war hero and the champion of the masses against Northeastern elites while the latter argued {{that he was a}} man of education and social grace against an uncouth, semi-literate backwoodsman. This belied the fact that Andrew Jackson was a societal elite by any definition, owning a large plantation with dozens of slaves and mostly surrounding himself with men of wealth and property. The election saw the coming to power of Jacksonian Democracy, thus marking the transition from the First Party System (which reflected Jeffersonian Democracy) to the Second Party System. Historians debate the significance of the election, with many arguing that it marked the beginning of modern American politics, with the decisive establishment of democracy and the formation of the two party system.|$|E
25|$|The {{generals and}} representatives at Saumur, {{including}} Berthier, planned {{to drive the}} rebels west against the seacoast and crush them there. From his headquarters at Niort, Biron argued that this action might cause the rebels to overrun a port and open communications with the Royal Navy. He and Canclaux wanted to mount a concentric offensive instead. Finding the independent-minded group at Saumur persisting with their plan and being supported by the Committee of Public Safety, Biron sent in his resignation. He was soon recalled to Paris and executed by guillotine on 31 December 1793. Meanwhile, Jacques-Marie Pilotte La Barolière set out from Saumur with a major expedition. On 15 and 17 July they repulsed rebel attacks but the unfitness of their soldiers shook the resolve of the commanders. La Barolière complained that his troops were drunk and insubordinate while Berthier advised retreat after witnessing two units firing <b>at</b> <b>one</b> <b>another.</b> Led by a body of German and Swiss deserters, the Whites attacked on 18 July at Vihiers. The advance guard under Menou held its ground {{for a long time}} but many of the Blues ran away after only catching a glimpse of the enemy. Louis-Nicolas Davout covered the rout that followed with some cavalry and Santerre escaped by jumping his horse over a wall. In the Battle of Vihiers the Royalists lost 1,000 killed and wounded out of 12,000. The Republicans suffered losses of 2,000 killed and wounded and 3,000 men captured out of 14,000; they lost 25 out of 30 guns.|$|E
5000|$|The name Mushaboom {{is likely}} a {{shortened}} {{form of the}} Mi'kmaq word Moosaboon-elagwaak which means [...] "a pile of hair".

500|$|Remembering his {{experience}} with Shaoweng, the emperor turned cautious and tested Luan Da; he requested the mystic to display his power. Luan Da set down a chess board and, while chanting, caused the chess pieces to charge <b>at</b> <b>one</b> <b>another.</b> The emperor was reassured that Luan Da truly had power. The trick was achieved by coating the pieces {{in a mixture of}} rooster's blood, iron shavings, and [...] "magnetic dust". In Science and Civilisation in China (1986), Joseph Needham discusses the details of this feat and proposed that lodestone was likely used: powdered magnetite would not have been very effective.|$|E
500|$|The common {{method of}} {{grinding}} and mashing ingredients into pastes {{and the many}} potages and sauces {{has been used as}} an argument that most adults within the medieval nobility lost their teeth at an early age, and hence were forced to eat nothing but porridge, soup and ground-up meat. The image of nobles gumming their way through multi-course meals of nothing but mush has lived {{side by side with the}} contradictory apparition of the [...] "mob of uncouth louts (disguised as noble lords) who, when not actually hurling huge joints of greasy meat <b>at</b> <b>one</b> <b>another</b> across the banquet hall, are engaged in tearing at them with a perfectly healthy complement of incisors, canines, bicuspids and molars".|$|E
500|$|While much of {{the prior}} work in {{automated}} virtual camera control systems has been directed towards reducing {{the need for a}} human to manually control the camera, the Director's Lens solution computes and proposes a palette of suggested virtual camera shots leaving the human operator to make the creative shot selection. [...] In computing subsequent suggested virtual camera shots, the system analyzes the visual compositions and editing patterns of prior recorded shots to compute suggested camera shots that conform to continuity conventions such as not crossing the line of action, match placement of virtual characters so they appear to look <b>at</b> <b>one</b> <b>another</b> across cuts, and favors those shots which the human operator had previously used in sequence.|$|E
50|$|A {{favorite}} of whaling ships {{in need of}} reprovisioning, {{in the mid-nineteenth century}} Rotuma became a haven for runaway sailors, some of whom were escaped convicts.

500|$|Hoste {{was aware}} of Dubourdieu's {{intentions}} and the French advantage in numbers, and consequently ordered a large [...] howitzer on Amphion's deck triple-shotted until the cannon contained over 750musket balls Once Favorite was within a few yards of Amphions stern, Hoste gave permission for the gun to be fired and the cannon's discharge instantly swept the bow of Favorite clear of the French and Italian boarding party. Among the dozens killed and wounded were Dubourdieu and all the frigate's officers, leaving Colonel Gifflenga in command of Favorite. As Favorite and Amphion closed with one another, firing continued between the British rear and the French leeward division, led by Danaé. Several of the French ships came at an angle at which they could bring their guns to bear on HMS Cerberus, the rearmost British ship, and both sides were firing regular broadsides <b>at</b> <b>one</b> <b>another.</b>|$|E
500|$|As {{the field}} was cleared, silence descended on the arena {{following}} the King's [...] instructions that anybody who interfered in the duel would be executed and that anyone who shouted or verbally interrupted the combat would lose a hand. Readying their steeds, the knights squared up and at the marshal's signal, charged towards one another. Their lances struck but failed to penetrate the thick hides covering their shields and the combatants wheeled and charged again, this time striking one another on their helms. Rounding once more, the knights charged a third time, again striking shields and this time both shattering their lances. Reeling from the impact, the warriors drew their axes and charged a fourth time. Slashing and kicking <b>at</b> <b>one</b> <b>another</b> in {{the centre of the}} field, they traded blows until Le Gris, the much stronger man, was able to drive his axe through the neck of Carrouges' horse. As the beheaded beast tumbled to the ground, Carrouges jumped clear and lashed out with his own weapon, disemboweling Le Gris' steed in turn.|$|E
