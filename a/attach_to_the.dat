5|$|Grey reef {{sharks are}} prey for larger sharks, {{such as the}} silvertip shark. At Rangiroa Atoll in French Polynesia, great hammerheads (Sphyrna mokarran) feed opportunistically on grey reef sharks that are {{exhausted}} from pursuing mates. Known parasites of this species include the nematode Huffmanela lata and several copepod species that <b>attach</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> sharks' skin, and juvenile stages of the isopods Gnathia trimaculata and G. grandilaris that <b>attach</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> gill filaments and septa (the dividers between each gill).|$|E
5|$|The spores are cylindrical, smooth, and hyaline (translucent), with {{dimensions}} of 3–4 by 1–2µm. The basidia (spore-bearing cells) are cylindrical, with {{dimensions of}} 20–25 by 3–4µm. They have eight sterigmata (slender extensions that <b>attach</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> spores), {{as well as}} a clamp at their base.|$|E

5|$|Amanita rubrovolvata {{produces}} a white to cream-colored spore print. The spores are spherical or nearly so, and typically measure 7.5–9.0 by 7.0–8.5µm. They are inamyloid, {{meaning that they}} will not absorb iodine stain from Melzer's reagent. The basidia (spore-bearing cells in the hymenium) are club-shaped, four-spored (rarely two-spored), and measure 25–44 by 10–14µm. The sterigmata (slender extensions at the basidial tips that <b>attach</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> spores) are 3–4µm long, and clamps are not found on the bases of basidia.|$|E
5|$|Antibodies can {{continue}} {{to be an effective}} defence mechanism even after viruses have managed to gain entry to the host cell. A protein that is in cells, called TRIM21, can <b>attach</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> antibodies {{on the surface of the}} virus particle. This primes the subsequent destruction of the virus by the enzymes of the cell's proteosome system.|$|E
5|$|The {{bacteria}} that cause urinary tract infections typically enter the bladder via the urethra. However, infection may also occur via the blood or lymph. It {{is believed that}} the bacteria are usually transmitted to the urethra from the bowel, with females at greater risk due to their anatomy. After gaining entry to the bladder, E. Coli are able to <b>attach</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> bladder wall and form a biofilm that resists the body's immune response.|$|E

5|$|Unlike {{other members}} of this phylum, {{anthozoans}} {{do not have a}} medusa stage in their development. Instead, they release sperm and eggs into the water. After fertilisation, the planula larvae form part of the plankton. When fully developed, the larvae settle on the seabed and <b>attach</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> substrate, undergoing metamorphosis into polyps. Some anthozoans can also reproduce asexually through budding or by breaking in pieces. More than 6,100 species have been described.|$|E
5|$|Like {{most other}} molluscs, the {{excretory}} organs of bivalves are {{a pair of}} nephridia. Each of these consists of a long, looped, glandular tube, which opens into the body cavity just beneath the heart, and a bladder to store urine. The pericardial glands either line the auricles of the heart or <b>attach</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> pericardium, and serve as extra filtration organs. Metabolic waste is voided from the bladders through a pair of openings {{near the front of}} {{the upper part of the}} mantle cavity, from where it joins the stream of exhalant water.|$|E

These free-moving folds or filaments are called the plica fimbriata and <b>attach</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> base of the sublingua and are supported at the midline by the plica mediana. The plica fimbriata is highly developed and specialized in lemurs, and makes up the majority of the sublingua.|$|E
5|$|Parasaurolophus walkeri {{is known}} from one {{specimen}} which might contain a pathology. The skeleton shows a v-shaped gap or notch in the vertebrae {{at the base}} of the neck. Originally thought to be pathologic, Parks published a second interpretation of this, as a ligament attachment to support the head. The crest would <b>attach</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> gap via muscles or ligaments, and be used to support the head while bearing a frill, like predicted to exist in some hadrosaurids. One other possibility, is that during preparation, the specimen was damaged, creating the possible pathology. The notch, however, is still considered more likely to be a pathology, even though some illustrations of Parasaurolophus restore the skin flap.|$|E
5|$|The game is set after {{a fictional}} World War III in a post-apocalyptic United States where various gangs prey on towns in which {{survivors}} {{from the war}} have gathered. The player assumes the role the eponymous female protagonist, Angel, as she defends the towns and searches for her lost friend. The game is played from a bird's eye view as the player controls a car and its mounted machine guns in order to destroy enemies and vehicles. Players can find more powerful guns to <b>attach</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> car and can also use special weapons such as napalm or spike strips which are picked up after killing certain enemies.|$|E

5|$|The {{spore print}} is white when fresh, but becomes more cream-coloured when dry. The smooth spores are oval to ellipsoid, hyaline (translucent), non-amyloid (meaning {{they do not}} absorb iodine from Melzer's reagent), and {{typically}} measure 6.5–7.5 by 4.5–5.5μm. The basidia (spore-bearing cells) are thin-walled, hyaline, and lack clamp connections at their bases. They are usually four-spored but occasionally two-spored, with sterigmata (projections that <b>attach</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> spores) up to 4μm long. The cheilocystidia (cystidia that occur {{on the edge of}} a gill) are mostly club-shaped, thin-walled, hyaline, and measure 15–30 by 6–10μm.|$|E
5|$|There {{has been}} {{considerable}} argument among paleontologists {{about whether the}} main wing membranes (brachiopatagia) attached to the hind limbs, and if so, where. Fossils of the rhamphorhynchoid Sordes, the anurognathid Jeholopterus, and a pterodactyloid from the Santana Formation seem {{to demonstrate that the}} wing membrane did <b>attach</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> hindlimbs, at least in some species. However, modern bats and flying squirrels show considerable variation in the extent of their wing membranes and it is possible that, like these groups, different species of pterosaur had different wing designs. Indeed, analysis of pterosaur limb proportions shows that there was considerable variation, possibly reflecting a variety of wing-plans.|$|E
5|$|As {{with other}} bird families, {{pelicans}} {{are susceptible to}} a variety of parasites. Specialist feather lice of the genus Piagetella are found in the pouches of all species of pelican, but are otherwise only known from New World and Antarctic cormorants. Avian malaria is carried by the mosquito Culex pipens, and high densities of these biting insects may force pelican colonies to be abandoned. Leeches may <b>attach</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> vent or sometimes the inside of the pouch. A study of the parasites of the American white pelican found 75 different species, including tapeworms, flukes, flies, fleas, ticks and nematodes. Many of these do little harm, but flies may be implicated in the death of nestlings, particularly if they are weak or unwell, and the soft tick Ornithodoros capensis sometimes causes adults to desert the nest. Many pelican parasites are found in other bird groups, but several lice are very host-specific.|$|E

5|$|Cementum is a {{specialized}} bone like substance covering {{the root of}} a tooth. It is approximately 45% inorganic material (mainly hydroxyapatite), 33% organic material (mainly collagen) and 22% water. Cementum is excreted by cementoblasts within {{the root of the}} tooth and is thickest at the root apex. Its coloration is yellowish and it is softer than dentin and enamel. The principal role of cementum is to serve as a medium by which the periodontal ligaments can <b>attach</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> tooth for stability. At the cementoenamel junction, the cementum is acellular due to its lack of cellular components, and this acellular type covers at least ⅔ of the root. The more permeable form of cementum, cellular cementum, covers about ⅓ of the root apex.|$|E
5|$|Common {{blackbirds}} {{spend much}} of their time looking for food on the ground where they can become infested with ticks, which are external parasites that most commonly <b>attach</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> head of a blackbird. In France, 74% of rural blackbirds were found to be infested with Ixodes ticks, whereas, only 2% of blackbirds living in urban habitats were infested. This is partly because it is more difficult for ticks to find another host on lawns and gardens in urban areas than in uncultivated rural areas, and partly because ticks are likely to be commoner in rural areas, where a variety of tick hosts, such as foxes, deer and boar, are more numerous. Although ixodid ticks can transmit pathogenic viruses and bacteria, and are known to transmit Borrelia bacteria to birds, {{there is no evidence that}} this affects the fitness of blackbirds except when they are exhausted and run down after migration.|$|E
5|$|Epaulette {{sharks are}} preyed upon by larger fishes such as other sharks. Its {{coloration}} provides protective camouflage, while its epaulette is speculated {{to be an}} eyespot for distracting or deterring predators. Epaulette sharks are almost all parasitized by the praniza (parasitic) larval stage of gnathiid isopods. The larvae feed on blood and mostly <b>attach</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> skin around the cloaca and the claspers, though they are also found inside the mouth and on the gills. These parasites cause little damage and are not believed to adversely affect {{the health of the}} shark. Other parasites of this species include a species of myxosporean in the genus Kudoa, which infests the skeletal muscles, the hemogregarine protozoan Haemogregarina hemiscyllii, which infects the blood, the ostracod Sheina orri, which attaches to the gills, and the nematode Proleptus australis, which infests the stomach.|$|E
