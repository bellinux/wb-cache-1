The nickel proved difficult to strike and the reverse, or tails, design was modified in 1867. Even so, production difficulties continued, causing many minor varieties which are collected today. Minting of the Shield nickel for circulation was suspended in 1876 for a period of over two years due to <b>a</b> <b>glut</b> <b>of</b> low-denomination coinage and it was struck in only small quantities until 1882. The following year, the coin was replaced by Charles E. Barber's Liberty head design.|$|E
5|$|Poole and Donovan {{had long}} {{wanted to make}} a sequel to Boys in the Sand. In 1984, they finally shot Boys in the Sand II. Also filmed on Fire Island, the film {{featured}} Donovan, the only cast member from the original to return. The original opening sequence, Bayside, was recreated for the sequel, with Pat Allen performing the run from the water. Litigation tied up the release of Boys in the Sand II until 1986 and {{with the advent of the}} home video market, there was <b>a</b> <b>glut</b> <b>of</b> gay porn titles available. Boys in the Sand II did not distinguish itself from the competition and was not particularly successful.|$|E

5|$|The {{quotation}} {{price of}} Olympus shares on the Tokyo Stock Exchange (TSE) on 15 November had fallen by some 75percent since the scandal erupted. The price {{continued to be}} volatile: trading was halted as its price hit the upper limit for price falls. On 14 and 15 November, after the threat of delisting ebbed, trading in its shares was once again halted when buy orders heavily outnumbered sell orders; the price rose by the upper limit of ¥100. Trading only took place after hours as there was <b>a</b> <b>glut</b> <b>of</b> unsatisfied buy orders. The share price rose in four straight trading sessions, reaching 834yen at one point on 16 November.|$|E
5|$|Agouti {{species are}} one of the few animal groups that can break open the large {{capsules}} of the Brazil nut fruit. Too many seeds are inside to be consumed in one meal, so the agouti carries some off and caches them. This helps dispersal of the seeds as any that the agouti fails to retrieve are distant from the parent tree when they germinate. Other nut-bearing trees tend to bear <b>a</b> <b>glut</b> <b>of</b> fruits in the autumn. These are too numerous to be eaten in one meal and squirrels gather and store the surplus in crevices and hollow trees. In desert regions, seeds are often available only for short periods. The kangaroo rat collects all it can find and stores them in larder chambers in its burrow.|$|E
5|$|RKO {{released}} a limited slate of twelve features {{in its first}} year; in 1930, that figure more than doubled to twenty-nine. Originally organized as the distinct business entities RKO Productions Inc. and RKO Distributing Corp., by July the studio was making a transition to the new, unified RKO Radio Pictures Inc. Encouraged by Rio Ritas success, RKO produced several costly musicals incorporating Technicolor sequences, among them Dixiana and Hit the Deck, both scripted and directed, like Rio Rita, by Luther Reed. Following {{the example of the}} other major studios, RKO had planned to create its own musical revue, Radio Revels. Promoted as the studio's most extravagant production to date, it was to be photographed entirely in Technicolor. The project was abandoned, however, as the public's taste for musicals temporarily subsided. From a total of more than sixty Hollywood musicals in 1929 and over eighty the following year, the number dropped to eleven in 1931. RKO was left in a bind: it still had a contract with Technicolor to produce two more features with its system. Complicating matters, audiences had come to associate color with the momentarily out-of-favor musical genre due to <b>a</b> <b>glut</b> <b>of</b> such productions from the major Hollywood studios. Fulfilling its obligations, RKO produced two all-Technicolor pictures, The Runaround and Fanny Foley Herself (both 1931), containing no musical sequences. Neither was a success.|$|E

50|$|General Motors {{predicted}} {{sales of}} between 30,000-40,000 vehicles {{a year in}} the United States. Sales were slow, due initially to <b>a</b> large <b>glut</b> <b>of</b> unsold Ions and later the uncertainty surrounding the Saturn brand's future. In 2008 only 11,968 were sold in the US and in 2009 this fell to 6,298.|$|R

50|$|In 2008, {{the school}} was reevaluated by Taiwan's Ministry of Education, {{as a result of}} which one-third of its {{departments}} were placed on probation.

In 2010 it was announced that HCU has passed the re-evaluation (though several departments were closed) for the next five years.|$|R
25|$|But {{discrimination}} {{was perhaps}} less overt than such events suggest. It {{could be argued}} that some politicians and publicists may have promoted and disseminated controversial ideologies through popular books such as H. Glynn-Ward’s 1921 The Writing on the Wall and Tom MacInnes’s 1929 The Oriental Occupation of British Columbia. Newspapermen such as L. D. Taylor of the Vancouver World and General Victor Odlum of the Star generated <b>a</b> <b>glut</b> <b>of</b> editorials analyzing and warning about the “Oriental Menace,” as did Danger: The Anti-Asiatic Weekly.|$|E
25|$|Delaware fruit growers had {{experienced}} a bumper year in 1875, and <b>a</b> <b>glut</b> <b>of</b> peaches on the local market had depressed the price correspondingly.

The ASC organized a train to pick up the fruit, and the response was overwhelming, with over 4,500 baskets of peaches delivered. Ohio sailed for Liverpool with its cargo of peaches in late August.|$|E
25|$|The Aircraft Manufacturing Company Limited (Airco) was a British {{aircraft}} manufacturer operating from 1912 to 1920. Airco produced thousands of aircraft for the British military during the First World War, {{most of which}} were designed by their chief designer, Geoffrey de Havilland. Advertised in 1918 as the largest aircraft company in the world, Airco established the first airline in the United Kingdom, Aircraft Transport and Travel Limited, as a subsidiary. <b>A</b> <b>glut</b> <b>of</b> war surplus aircraft and a lack of government interest in aviation caused the company to become unprofitable, and in 1920 it was sold to Birmingham Small Arms Company, who had its operations liquidated later that year.|$|E

25|$|An institution's {{overnight}} reserves, averaged {{over some}} maintenance period, must equal or exceed its average required reserves, calculated {{over the same}} maintenance period.

Since quantitative easing began in 2008, they have been even less important, as <b>an</b> enormous <b>glut</b> <b>of</b> excess reserves now exists (over the whole system, though in theory, individual banks may still run into temporary shortfalls).|$|R
25|$|There {{was a brief}} codicil to Packe's {{first-class}} cricket career. Following {{his appearance}} for the Army cricket team in 1932, he played four further first-class games for the Army between 1937 and 1939. In a rain-spoiled match against a weak Cambridge University side in May 1938, he hit 176 in 135 minutes, with 29 fours, to record his highest first-class score. His century came in 75 minutes and was the fastest of the season until beaten by Don Bradman, by two minutes, three weeks later. The following season, 1939, the same fixture saw <b>a</b> <b>glut</b> <b>of</b> runs and Packe was again the highest scorer, his 145 on that occasion taking 170 minutes with 20 fours. It was Packe's last first-class match.|$|E
25|$|Normally, {{the extra}} payment of the premium would be {{compensated}} for by the profits {{to be made by}} selling the first of the new crop of tea. In 1866 there was a problem - the first cargo of tea had arrived over two weeks earlier in the steam auxiliary ship Erl King, a ship that was not considered part of the race. The tea merchants were committed to a payment when their tea would sell at a loss. To add to this, the first two tea clippers had signalled off Deal early on the morning of 6 September, followed by a third (Serica) at 1:00 pm. These three ships would create <b>a</b> <b>glut</b> <b>of</b> new season tea, so prices were bound to fall further.|$|E
25|$|Right {{through to}} {{the first decades of}} the twentieth century, {{manufacturers}} continued to seek a solution to realise the economic benefits of direct-pull ploughing and, particularly in North America, this led to the American development of the steam tractor. British companies such as Mann's and Garrett developed potentially viable direct ploughing engines, however market conditions were against them and they failed to gain widespread popularity. These market conditions arose in the wake of the First World War when there was <b>a</b> <b>glut</b> <b>of</b> surplus equipment available as a result of British Government policy. Large numbers of Fowler ploughing engines had been constructed in order to increase the land under tillage during the war and many new light Fordson F tractors had been imported from 1917 onwards.|$|E
50|$|For the {{subsidiaries}} of United Aircraft, and for {{countless other}} manufacturing firms, World War II was {{an exercise in}} how to attempt to meet limitless demand for production (as well as for R&D). The U.S. government encouraged corporations to build up their physical plant, but the corporations knew {{that there would be}} <b>a</b> postwar <b>glut</b> <b>of</b> overcapacity if they did so. In many cases a compromise was reached in which the government paid partially or fully for the expansions in the form of tax breaks and accelerated depreciation.|$|R

50|$|Following the Great Seattle Fire of 1889, the northward {{expansion}} of Seattle's business district from Pioneer Square, {{already in the}} planning stages prior to the fire, took on a rapid pace. <b>A</b> quick <b>glut</b> <b>of</b> new office space created by the boom however left many buildings incomplete and many more lots undeveloped as the economy began to cool in 1891.

25|$|By 1942, the Air Ministry had <b>a</b> <b>glut</b> <b>of</b> trained pilots, {{resulting}} from the fear created by the Blitz and the Battle of Britain. Desperate for pilots, too many {{had been allowed to}} train, or had been placed on backlists to await slots for induction and training. This would continue to be a problem as late as 1944, when the British Army was forced to disband a division after Operation Overlord due to a shortage of manpower. At the same time, the Air Ministry had the equivalent of a division of civilians waiting aircrew training slots, and already had more aircrew than it had aircraft available for them to man. This would lead to pilots being transferred to the Army's Glider Pilot Regiment, and to the lists of civilians reserved for aircrew training being cleared of men who were then able to be conscripted by the Army.|$|E
25|$|The most {{prominent}} Schalke addition was {{the arrival of}} Kevin-Prince Boateng from Milan. After a disappointing {{first round of the}} 2013–14 Bundesliga that saw Schalke in seventh place in the Bundesliga table, as well as an early exit from the 2013–14 DFB-Pokal in the first knockout round, the club played their most successful {{second half of the season}} in club history. The season was marked by <b>a</b> <b>glut</b> <b>of</b> injuries to key squad players, including Jefferson Farfán and Klaas-Jan Huntelaar, for almost the entire season. It also led to performance related discussions about head coach Jens Keller. Partially, Schalke fielded up to ten young players with potential who played in the Schalke youth system throughout the season. Among the brightest young player discoveries of the 2013–14 season were Max Meyer and Leon Goretzka. The young Schalke squad won 11 out of 17 matches, totalling 36 points. At the end of the 2013–14 season, the club finished in third place in the Bundesliga table to qualify for their third-straight UEFA Champions League appearance, a feat Schalke had never before achieved.|$|E
25|$|On 1 July 2009, Felix Magath, who had led VfL Wolfsburg {{to the top}} of {{the table}} in the Bundesliga, became head coach and general manager of the Königsblauen. The {{appointment}} of Magath as manager coincided with a multimillion-euro spending spree, allowing Schalke to acquire internationally-known forwards Klaas-Jan Huntelaar and Raúl. Magath's tenure at the club was initially successful, seeing the side score <b>a</b> <b>glut</b> <b>of</b> goals in the first few months of the season, though defensive frailties and Magath's questionable squad selection had made him unpopular with Schalke supporters by December 2010. On 16 March 2011, Magath was sacked and replaced with Ralf Rangnick, who previously, between 2004 and 2005, had a brief spell being in charge of the team. Within just weeks of his appointment, Rangnick masterminded a 5–2 victory over Inter Milan at the San Siro during the quarter-finals of the Champions League. Schalke advanced to the semi-final where they lost 2–0 to Manchester United in the first leg and 4–1 in the second leg.|$|E
