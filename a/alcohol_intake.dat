5|$|Treatments are varied {{because there}} are {{multiple}} perspectives of alcoholism. Those who approach alcoholism as a medical condition or disease recommend differing treatments from, for instance, those who approach the condition as one of social choice. Most treatments focus on helping people discontinue their <b>alcohol</b> <b>intake,</b> followed up with life training and/or social support to help them resist a return to alcohol use. Since alcoholism involves multiple factors which encourage a person to continue drinking, they must all be addressed to successfully prevent a relapse. An example {{of this kind of}} treatment is detoxification followed by a combination of supportive therapy, attendance at self-help groups, and ongoing development of coping mechanisms. The treatment community for alcoholism typically supports an abstinence-based zero tolerance approach; however, some prefer a harm-reduction approach.|$|E
5|$|Bond's {{drinking}} habits run {{throughout the}} series of books. During the course of On Her Majesty's Secret Service alone, Bond consumes forty-six drinks: Pouilly-Fuissé, Riquewihr and Marsala wines, most of a bottle of Algerian wine, some 1953 Château Mouton Rothschild claret, along with Taittinger and Krug champagnes and Babycham; for whiskies he consumes three bourbon and waters, half a pint of I.W. Harper bourbon, Jack Daniel's whiskey, two double bourbons on the rocks, two whisky and sodas, two neat scotches and one glass of neat whisky; vodka consumption totalled four vodka and tonics and three double vodka martinis; other spirits included two double brandies with ginger ale, a flask of Enzian Schnaps and a double gin: he also washed this down with four steins of German beer. Bond's <b>alcohol</b> <b>intake</b> {{does not seem to}} affect his performance.|$|E
40|$|The {{question}} about differences in dietary patterns associated with beer, wine, and spirits is still unresolved. We used diet data from 423 middle-aged males of the STANISLAS Study. Using adjusted values for covariates, we observed a negative significant association between increasing <b>alcohol</b> <b>intakes</b> and {{the consumption of}} milk, yogurt, and fresh/uncured cheese, sugar and confectionery, vegetables and fruits, and a significant positive relationship with cheese, meat and organs, pork-butcher's meat, and potatoes. In addition, the first dietary pattern identified by factor analysis (characterized a more prudent diet) was inversely related to <b>alcohol</b> <b>intakes.</b> Conversely, when analyzing daily consumption of specific food groups and diet patterns according to beverage preference (wine, beer, and spirits), no significant difference was observed. In conclusion, in this sample of middle-aged French males, there was a linear trend between increasing <b>alcohol</b> <b>intakes</b> and worsening of quality of diet, while no difference was observed according to beverage preference...|$|R

5|$|Epileptic {{seizures}} {{are thought}} to relate to abnormal electrical activity. Seizure activity can manifest as absence (of consciousness), focal effects such as limb movement or impediments of speech, or be generalized in nature. Status epilepticus refers to a seizure or series of seizures that have not terminated within 30 minutes, although this definition has recently been revised. Seizures have {{a large number of}} causes, however many seizures occur without a definitive cause being found. In a person with epilepsy, risk factors for further seizures may include sleeplessness, drug and <b>alcohol</b> <b>intake,</b> and stress. Seizures may be assessed using blood tests, EEG and various medical imaging techniques based on the medical history and exam findings. In addition to treating an underlying cause and reducing exposure to risk factors, anticonvulsant medications can play a role in preventing further seizures.|$|E
5|$|Several {{studies have}} focused on changes of anthropometrical (body weight, BMI, WHR,…) or {{biochemical}} parameters (mostly plasma lipid levels) {{as a result of the}} interactions between common APOA5 variants and dietary habits (polyunsaturated fatty acid intake, n-3 and n-6 fatty acid intake, total fat and total energy intake, <b>alcohol</b> <b>intake),</b> dietary (lowering the energy intake) and/or physical activity interventions or dyslipidaemic (using statins or fenofibrate) treatment. Due to the high heterogeneity of the examined populations, differences in protocol and/or interventions used, the studies are difficult to directly compare and draw definitive conclusions. However, with caution, it could be concluded that carriers of the minor C-1131, Trp19, or T553 alleles are in some cases less prone to the positive effects of environmental and/or pharmacological interventions. Some papers suggest the importance of the interactions between APOA5 and other genes, especially with common APOE (OMIM acc. No. 107741) three allelic (E2, E3, and E4) polymorphism, in the modulation of plasma lipids. In these cases, the interaction between minor alleles of both genes seems to be of importance. In the general population, APOE4 seems to have the potential to diminish the effect of minor APOA5 rs662799 and rs3135506 alleles, especially in females. Interaction between APOE and APOA5 Ser19˃Trp has been suggested to play some role in the development of type III hyperlipidaemia. Further studies, in which interaction with APOA5 has been described, have included, for example, variants within FTO, lipoprotein lipase, USF-1 and FEN-1. They have also focused not only on plasma lipids, but on BMI values or hypertension as well.|$|E

40|$|The authors {{describe}} {{an approach to}} the analysis of case-control studies in which the exposure variables are continuous, i. e., quantitative variables, and one wishes neither to categorize levels of the exposure variable nor to assume a log-linear relation between level of exposure and disease risk. A dose-response association of an exposure variable with a disease outcome can be depicted by estimated relative risks at various exposure levels, and the functional relation between exposure dose and disease risk is here termed a relative risk function (RRF). A RRF takes values that are greater than zero: Values less than one imply lower risk; the value one implies no risk, and values greater than one imply increased risk, when compared with a reference value. The authors describe how a nonparametric logistic regression can be used to estimate and display these RRFs. Using data from a previously published case-control study of diet and colon cancer, RRFs for total energy, dietary fiber, and <b>alcohol</b> <b>intakes</b> are compared with the original results obtained from using catego-rized levels of exposure variables. For total energy and <b>alcohol</b> <b>intakes,</b> there were meaningful differences in study results based on the two analytic approaches. For energy, the nonparametric logistic regression detected a significant protective effect of low intakes, which was not found in the original analysis. For alcohol, the nonparametric logistic regression suggested that there were two underlying populations, non- or very light drinkers and moderate to heavy drinkers, with different relation of dose to disease risk.

25|$|Excessive alcohol {{consumption}} {{is a significant}} cause of hepatitis and {{is the most common}} cause of cirrhosis in the U.S. Alcoholic hepatitis is within the spectrum of alcoholic liver disease.
