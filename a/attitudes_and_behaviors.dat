25|$|Justice or {{fairness}} {{refers to}} the idea that an action or decision is morally right, which may be defined according to ethics, religion, fairness, equity, or law. People are naturally attentive to the justice of events and situations in their everyday lives, across a variety of contexts (Tabibnia, Satpute, & Lieberman, 2008). Individuals react to actions and decisions made by organizations every day. An individual's perceptions of these decisions as fair or unfair can influence the individual's subsequent <b>attitudes</b> <b>and</b> <b>behaviors.</b> Fairness is often of central interest to organizations because the implications of perceptions of injustice can impact job <b>attitudes</b> <b>and</b> <b>behaviors</b> at work. Justice in organizations can include issues related to perceptions of fair pay, equal opportunities for promotion, and personnel selection procedures.|$|E

40|$|Background: KADARZI {{could be}} {{realized}} by optimizing {{the role of}} family, namely by increasing nutrition knowledge, changing <b>attitude</b> <b>and</b> <b>behavior</b> <b>and</b> developing independent family. The poor knowledge, <b>attitude</b> <b>and</b> <b>behavior</b> of society, especially house wives, to-ward nutrition and health are important factors which influence the realization of KADARZI programme. The evaluation of KADARZI programme in 2002 in Indragiri Hilir resulted 22. 41 % from the target 80 %. One way to increase society’s knowledge, <b>attitude</b> <b>and</b> <b>behavior</b> toward nutrition is by giving nutrition education during early life. Objective: The study was purposed to investigate the influence of nutrition education among elementary school students to KADARZI house wives knowledge, <b>attitude</b> <b>and</b> <b>behavior.</b> Method: This was quasi experimental with non-randomized control group pretest-posttest study. Subjects were elementary students in the fourth, fifth, and sixth class along with their mothers. The place was in Indragiri Hilir district. Subjects were gathered by purposive. The quantity of subjects were determined with sample formulation, knowledge, <b>attitude</b> <b>and</b> <b>behavior</b> data were gathered by interview and observation adjusted in questionnaire list. Characteristic was analyzed with chi square, statistic test with t-test, with significance level of p= 0. 05. Result: The analysis of age, education, occupation, the number of household members and family income of both group were similar. Pretest analysis of knowledge, <b>attitude</b> <b>and</b> <b>behavior</b> among students <b>and</b> mothers in both groups were also similar in both groups before intervention.

25|$|While {{some use}} the term to refer to only post-{{conflict}} or post-war contexts, most {{use the term}} more broadly to refer to any stage of conflict. Before conflict becomes violent, preventive peacebuilding efforts, such as diplomatic, economic development, social, educational, health, legal and security sector reform programs, address potential sources of instability and violence. This is also termed conflict prevention. Peacebuilding efforts aim to manage, mitigate, resolve and transform central aspects of the conflict through official diplomacy {{as well as through}} civil society peace processes and informal dialogue, negotiation, and mediation. Peacebuilding addresses economic, social and political root causes of violence and fosters reconciliation to prevent the return of structural and direct violence. Peacebuilding efforts aim to change beliefs, <b>attitudes</b> <b>and</b> <b>behaviors</b> to transform the short and long term dynamics between individuals and groups toward a more stable, peaceful coexistence.

Thus, the aim of the study is to enlighten self-reported <b>attitude</b> <b>and</b> <b>behavior</b> among dental <b>and</b> medical undergraduate students. Methodology: A cross-sectional, questionnaire-based study was conducted among undergraduate students of a tertiary care teaching hospital in Telangana state. The information regarding demographic data, <b>attitude,</b> <b>and</b> <b>behavior</b> toward oral health was collected using the Hiroshima University-Dental Behavioral Inventory questionnaire. Data were analyzed using the analysis of variance. Results: The study subjects consisted of 361 dental and 315 medical undergraduate students. The present study revealed that oral health <b>attitudes</b> <b>and</b> <b>behavior</b> improved significantly with increasing levels of education in both dental and medical students. The dental undergraduates have better <b>attitude</b> <b>and</b> <b>behavior</b> than medical students, which was statistically significant regarding oral hygiene practices, gingival health, and visit to the dentist. Conclusions: Significant improvement was found regarding oral health <b>attitude</b> <b>and</b> <b>behavior</b> among both dental and medical students, with increase in their academic year. The overall <b>attitude</b> <b>and</b> <b>behavior</b> were better in dental students than medical students; however, both dental and medical undergraduates should have a comprehensive program, self-care regimen practices starting from their 1 st year of education...|$|R

Subjects and Methods: A total of 189 students including 94 males and 95 females involved in the cross-sectional surveyed. Data were collected using pretested, self-administered, structured questionnaire. The mean percentage scores, standard deviation, and frequency distribution were calculated. The Student′s t-test and ANOVA test were used to test the association between variables. The linear regression analysis was used to establish any association of <b>behavior</b> with knowledge <b>and</b> <b>attitude.</b> Results: The total mean percentage scores for knowledge, <b>attitude,</b> <b>and</b> <b>behavior</b> were more than 50 % among the students. The mean percentage scores for knowledge, <b>attitude,</b> <b>and</b> <b>behavior</b> were significantly higher for the medical students compared to pharmacy and nursing students. All the scores were significantly higher in females than in males except for the mean score of knowledge. There was no significant association between knowledge, <b>attitude,</b> <b>and</b> <b>behavior</b> with age. Linear regression analysis showed a significant linear relationship between <b>behavior</b> <b>and</b> <b>attitude,</b> but there was no significant linear relation between <b>behavior</b> <b>and</b> knowledge. Conclusion: The present study indicates that although the mean scores for knowledge, <b>attitude,</b> <b>and</b> <b>behavior</b> were more than 50 % among the participants, the students′ oral health knowledge, <b>attitude,</b> <b>and</b> <b>behavior</b> was inadequate <b>and</b> needs to be improved upon.

Objective: The objective was to assess self-reported oral health <b>attitude</b> <b>and</b> <b>behavior</b> among undergraduate dental students and to analyze variations between gender and level of education. Materials and Methods: A self-administered questionnaire based on the Hiroshima University-Dental Behavioural Inventory (HU-DBI) was distributed among 270 undergraduate students which consisted of 20 dichotomous responses (yes-no). Data were analyzed using the analysis of variance and statistical significance was set at P < 0. 05. Results: Females had better oral health <b>attitude</b> <b>and</b> <b>behavior</b> toward visiting the dentist and oral hygiene practices, mean HU-DBI score of 8. 8 (P < 0. 05). Furthermore, the preclinical students (1 st, 2 nd years) had better oral health <b>attitude</b> <b>and</b> <b>behavior</b> especially towards gingival health, oral hygiene practices and visiting the dentist (P < 0. 05). Conclusion: Among dental students, the overall attitude of oral health was good, even though there were deficits in a few areas.
