5000|$|It is {{believed}} Chief Engineer (Lieutenant Colonel) Heraud {{was a leading}} contributor to the missile section, of UNMOVIC’s working document on Iraq’s Unresolved Disarmament Issues. [...] Under Lieutenant Colonel Heraud’s leadership, the <b>Al</b> <b>Samoud</b> <b>missile</b> was destroyed.|$|E
50|$|Under UN supervision, Iraq begins {{destroying}} {{four of its}} <b>Al</b> <b>Samoud</b> <b>missiles.</b>|$|R
50|$|American forces found a {{cache of}} twelve <b>Al</b> <b>Samoud</b> <b>missiles</b> south of Baiji on July 21, 2003.|$|R
5000|$|Iraq destroys {{nine more}} <b>Al</b> <b>Samoud</b> 2 <b>missiles,</b> {{bringing}} to 28 {{the total number}} of missiles scrapped.|$|R
5000|$|Iraq destroys {{six more}} <b>Al</b> <b>Samoud</b> <b>missiles,</b> {{bringing}} the total destroyed to 10 out of an estimated 100 missiles ordered eliminated by the UN. The White House continues to dismiss Iraq's actions as [...] "part of its game of deception." [...] Iraq indicates that it may halt destruction of the missiles if the U.S. indicates it will go to war anyway.|$|R
5000|$|Iraq {{flattens}} {{six more}} <b>Al</b> <b>Samoud</b> 2 <b>missiles,</b> meaning {{the country has}} now destroyed 34 of its known stock of 100 of the banned rockets.|$|R
5000|$|Secretary of State Colin Powell {{says that}} US {{intelligence}} {{has indicated that}} Hussein has ordered the production of more <b>Al</b> <b>Samoud</b> 2 <b>missiles</b> parts and engines. The Iraqi government does not deny the claim but simply says once again that they considered the missiles to be legal. Powell {{also points out that}} Iraq has delivered [...] "some documents that have not been found before" ...|$|R
5000|$|Iraq destroys {{three more}} <b>Al</b> <b>Samoud</b> 2 <b>missiles,</b> {{bringing}} to 19 the number Baghdad has crushed out of 100 ordered {{destroyed by the}} UN. Iraq also destroys a launcher and five engines {{in a rush to}} prove it is disarming before a crucial U.N. report on 7 March. UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan calls the new actions [...] "a positive development" [...] while the White House remains unconvinced saying, [...] "Despite whatever limited head-fakes Iraq has engaged in, they continue to fundamentally not disarm." ...|$|R
5000|$|Iraq is {{expected}} {{to begin the process of}} destroying <b>Al</b> <b>Samoud</b> two <b>missiles</b> on Saturday. Hans Blix, U.N. chief weapons inspector says [...] "It is a very significant piece of real disarmament". However, White House spokesman Ari Fleischer declares that the Iraq commitment to destroying these missiles is a fraud that President George W. Bush had predicted, and indicates that the United States wants a total and complete disarmament of Iraq. He also repeats that if the United Nations does not act to disarm Baghdad, the United States will lead a coalition of voluntary countries to disarm Saddam Hussein.|$|R
5000|$|The {{main base}} for the SSF's {{northern}} units is a substantial modern barracks associated with Muaskar <b>Al</b> <b>Samoud,</b> with an extensive training facility and ranges next {{to the village of}} Halban near Seeb; the HQ building is at Latitude/Longitude 23.619486N, 58.037970E ...|$|R
50|$|In its 2000, 2001, and 2002 {{intelligence}} products (i.e., {{before the}} 2003 invasion), the IC updated its assessments and asserted that Iraq had made steady progress in developing its missile programs and was continuing to develop UAVs. The IC assessed that: Iraq {{was in the}} final stages of development of the a1 <b>Samoud</b> <b>missile</b> (2000), may be preparing to deploy the a1 Samoud (2001), and was deploying the a1 Samoud and Ababil-100 short-range ballistic missiles (SRBMs), both which exceed the 150-h UN range limit (2002).|$|R
50|$|The missile was {{essentially}} a scaled-down Scud, though parts were mostly derived from the Russian SA-2 'Guideline' surface-to-air missile. The first test-firing was carried out as early as 1997 and was supervised by UNSCOM. The production started in 2001, and the goal was the assembly of ten missiles each month. The <b>Al</b> <b>Samoud</b> 2 was not fully operational by 2003, {{but some of them}} had been already delivered to the Iraqi army.|$|R
5000|$|Two {{days before}} his {{scheduled}} update to the United Nations on Iraqi cooperation with inspection, Hans Blix credits Iraq with [...] "a great deal more of cooperation now", although still expressing some skepticism {{as to whether or}} not the cooperation would continue. Among the examples of cooperation that he cites are Iraq's destruction of <b>Samoud</b> 2 <b>missiles,</b> which he calls [...] "the most spectacular and the most important and tangible". He adds that [...] "here weapons that can be used in war are being destroyed in fairly large quantities." [...] In general, he states, [...] "you have a greater measure of cooperation on interviews in general." [...] These statements help to harden the opposition to the US-led war by several other Security Council members. (It was later found that Blix had found and destroyed almost the only illegal weapons in Iraq - and they were not WMD).|$|R
