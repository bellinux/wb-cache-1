25|$|The anode and cathode foils must be {{protected}} from direct {{contact with each other}} because such contact, even at relatively low voltages, may lead to a short circuit. In case of direct contact of both foils the oxide layer on the anode surface gives no protection. A spacer or separator made of a special highly <b>absorbent</b> <b>paper</b> with high purity protects the two metal foils from direct contact. This capacitor paper also serves as a reservoir for the electrolyte to extend the lifetime of the capacitor.|$|E
25|$|Around 1450, Johannes Gutenberg {{introduced}} the first movable type printing system in Europe. He advanced innovations in casting type {{based on a}} matrix and hand mould, adaptations to the screw-press, {{the use of an}} oil-based ink, {{and the creation of a}} softer and more <b>absorbent</b> <b>paper.</b> Gutenberg was the first to create his type pieces from an alloy of lead, tin, antimony, copper and bismuth – the same components still used today. Johannes Gutenberg started work on his printing press around 1436, in partnership with Andreas Dritzehen – whom he had previously instructed in gem-cutting – and Andreas Heilmann, the owner of a paper mill.|$|E

50|$|There {{are three}} {{categories}} of papers with respect to sizing: unsized (water-leaf), weak sized (slack sized), and strong sized (hard sized). Waterleaf has low water resistance and includes <b>absorbent</b> <b>papers</b> for blotting. Slack sized <b>paper</b> is somewhat <b>absorbent</b> and includes newsprint, while hard sized papers have the highest water resistance, such as coated fine papers and liquid packaging board.|$|R

25|$|In {{the metal}} type era, typefaces {{intended}} to be printed small contained ink traps, small indentations at the junctions of strokes that would be filled up with ink spreading out, maintaining the intended appearance of the type design. Without ink traps, the excess ink would blob and ruin the crisp edge. At larger sizes, these ink traps were not necessary, so display faces did not have them. They have also been removed from most digital fonts, as these will normally be viewed on screen or printed through inkjet printing, laser printing, offset lithography, electrophotographic printing or other processes that do not show the ink spread of letterpress. Ink traps have remained common on designs {{intended to be}} printed on low-quality, <b>absorbent</b> <b>paper,</b> especially newsprint and telephone directories.|$|E
2500|$|Commensurate {{with the}} need of {{wildlife}} conservation, it is often desirable to include in a herbarium sheet {{as much of the}} plant as possible (e.g., flowers, stems, leaves, seed, and fruit), or at least representative parts of them in the case of large specimens. To preserve their form and colour, plants collected in the field are carefully arranged and spread flat between thin sheets, known as 'flimsies', (equivalent to sheets of newsprint) and dried, usually in a plant press, between blotters or <b>absorbent</b> <b>paper.</b> During the drying process the specimens are retained within their flimsies at all times to minimise damage, and only the thicker, absorbent drying sheets are replaced. For some plants it may prove helpful to allow the fresh specimen to wilt slightly before being arranged for the press. An opportunity to check, rearrange and further lay out the specimen to best reveal the required features of the plant occurs when the damp absorbent sheets are changed during the drying/pressing process.|$|E

50|$|The <b>absorbent</b> kraft <b>paper</b> is {{a normal}} kraft paper with {{controlled}} absorbency, which means {{a high degree of}} porosity. It is made of clean low kappa hardwood kraft with good uniformity. The grammage is 80 - 120 g/m2 and normally 2-4 plies are used.|$|R
50|$|The {{measure of}} how much an ink dot spreads and becomes larger on paper is called dot gain. This {{phenomenon}} must be accounted for in photographic or digital preparation of screened images. Dot gain is higher on more <b>absorbent,</b> uncoated <b>paper</b> stock such as newsprint.|$|R
40|$|Absorbent-grade {{paper is}} a highly {{specialized}} product due to introduction of certain special characteristics, namely high water absorbency, castor oil penetration (COP), and porosity. Water absorbency {{is affected by the}} radius of capillaries within the paper. Likewise the COP is affected by pulp beating and by the degree of collapse of the paper structure during sheet pressing. Using 4 % NaHCO 3 solution during manufacturing of <b>absorbent</b> grade <b>paper</b> not only improves all the three basic properties, but it also mitigates the cost of <b>absorbent</b> grade <b>paper</b> by US$ 4. 07 per metric tonne. Fibers come closer to each other during sheet making as a result of increased surface tension forces due to mixing of NaHCO 3 in tap water...|$|R
50|$|The Pilstulpe ("Pilsner Tulip") or Biertulpe ("Beer tulip") is the {{tradition}} glass for German pilsner beers. Sizes are typically around 300 ml, {{but can be}} as large as 500 ml.

50|$|Porous {{paper is}} used to {{describe}} paper as absorbent, usually in contrast to less <b>absorbent</b> <b>paper</b> used in the stamps of the same country. Porosity is a characteristic of paper. Wood fibers are hydrophilic or water loving. Sizing is added to paper to create a resistance to water {{as well as to}} fill in the gaps between the fibers. Porosity is a measure of how the paper responds to a liquid.|$|E
50|$|Broader nibs {{are used}} for less precise emphasis, {{with the benefit of}} a greater level of ink shading and/or sheen on less <b>absorbent</b> <b>paper.</b> Finer nibs (e.g. EF and F) may be used for {{intricate}} corrections and alterations, at the expense of shading and sheen. Oblique, reverse oblique, stub and italic nibs may be used for calligraphic purposes or for general handwritten compositions.The line width of a particular nib may vary based on its country of origin; Japanese nibs are often thinner in general.|$|E

50|$|An {{improper}} technique {{can produce}} false results, for example, leukocytes and erythrocytes precipitate {{at the bottom}} of the container and may not be detected if the sample is not properly mixed, and in the same way, if an excess of urine remains on the strip after it has been removed from the test sample, may cause the reagents to leak from the pads onto adjacent pads resulting in mixing and distortion of the colours. To ensure that this does not occur it is recommended the edges of the strip are dried on <b>absorbent</b> <b>paper.</b>|$|E
50|$|Screen {{frequency}} {{is determined}} by the type of paper the image is printed on. An <b>absorbent</b> <b>paper</b> surface, uncoated recycled paper for instance, lets ink droplets spread (dot gain)—so requires a more open printing screen. Input resolution can therefore be reduced to minimize file size without loss in quality, as long as the quality factor of 2 is maintained. This is easily determined by doubling the line frequency. For example, printing on an uncoated paper stock often limits printing screen frequency to no more than 120 lpi, therefore, a quality factor of 2 is achieved with images of 240 ppi.|$|E
5000|$|Dried {{blood spot}} {{specimens}} are collected by applying {{a few drops}} of blood, drawn by lancet from the finger, heel or toe, onto specially manufactured <b>absorbent</b> filter <b>paper.</b> The blood is allowed to thoroughly saturate the paper and is air dried for several hours. [...] Specimens are stored in low gas-permeability plastic bags with desiccant added to reduce humidity, and may be kept at ambient temperature, even in tropical climates.|$|R
25|$|Plant-based paste {{tends to}} dry {{more quickly than}} silk-based pastes because the plant extract does not hold onto the oil as tightly as silk. Depending on the paper used, plant pastes can dry in 10 to 15 minutes. The more <b>absorbent</b> the <b>paper</b> is, the faster it dries as the paper absorbs most of the oil. Also, plant pastes tend to smudge more easily than silk pastes due to the loose binding agent.|$|R
50|$|Facial {{tissue and}} paper {{handkerchief}} {{refers to a}} class of soft, <b>absorbent,</b> disposable <b>papers</b> that are suitable for use on the face. They are disposable alternatives for cloth handkerchiefs.

50|$|Chicken can {{be cooked}} or reheated from the frozen state, {{but it will}} take {{approximately}} one and a half times as long to cook, and any wrapping or <b>absorbent</b> <b>paper</b> should be discarded. There are three generally accepted safe methods of reheating frozen chicken: in the refrigerator, in cold water, or using a microwave oven. These methods are endorsed by the FDA as safe, as they minimize the risk of bacterial growth. Bacteria survives but does not grow in freezing temperatures. However, if frozen cooked foods are not defrosted properly and are not reheated to temperatures that kill bacteria, chances of getting a foodborne illness greatly increase.|$|E

50|$|Indicators {{may be used}} {{to measure}} pH, by making use of the fact that their color changes with pH. Visual {{comparison}} of the color of a test solution with a standard color chart provides a means to measure pH accurate to the nearest whole number. More precise measurements are possible if the color is measured spectrophotometrically, using a colorimeter or spectrophotometer.Universal indicator consists of a mixture of indicators such that there is a continuous color change from about pH 2 to pH 10. Universal indicator paper is made from <b>absorbent</b> <b>paper</b> that has been impregnated with universal indicator. Another method of measuring pH is using an electronic pH meter.|$|E

25|$|Typefaces {{may also}} be {{designed}} differently considering the type of paper on which they will be printed. Designs to be printed on <b>absorbent</b> newsprint <b>paper</b> will be more slender as the ink will naturally spread out as it absorbs into the paper, and may feature ink traps: areas left blank into which the ink will soak as it dries. These corrections will not be needed for printing on high-gloss cardboard or display on-screen. Fonts designed for low-resolution displays, meanwhile, may avoid pure circles, fine lines and details a screen cannot render.|$|R
5000|$|A {{laminate}} {{consists of}} a single or multiple layers, each having its own distinct function. The base is most often particle- or fiberboards, then some layers of <b>absorbent</b> kraft <b>paper.</b> The last layers are a decor paper covered with an overlay. The lamination papers are covered with an inert resin, often melamine, which is cured to form a hard composite with the structure of paper. The laminates may also have a [...] {{on the back side}} of laminating kraft to compensate for the tension created by the top side lamination.|$|R
