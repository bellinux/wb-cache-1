40|$|A {{study has}} been made of the {{low-energy}} charged particles emitted from the interactions of 6 BeV and 27 BeV protons with silver and bromine nuclei in nuclear emulsions. The energy spectra of the protons and <b>alpha</b> <b>particles</b> are compared with the Weisskopf evaporation theory and with experimental results at other bombarding energies. The evaporation temperatures of the excited nuclei were determined for the emission of protons (including deuterons and tritons) and <b>alpha</b> <b>particles,</b> respectively, for the two primary proton energies of 6 BeV and 27 BeV. The two proton energy spectra are consistent with an evaporation temperature of 4 to 5 MeV and a potential barrier V° ∼ 3 - 4 MeV. For the <b>alpha</b> <b>particle</b> <b>spectra,</b> the parameters for the evaporation curves which give the best fit to the experimental distributions are a temperature, T, of the order of 10 to 12 MeV and a potential barrier V° very nearly equal to zero. These abnormally high temperatures (greater than the binding energy of a nucleon inside the nucleus) indicate the emission process cannot be entirely explained in terms of a normal mechanism of evaporation from a thermodynamic equilibrium state. Applying the value of T obtained from the proton energy spectra, with a value of V° - 7 - 8 MeV, gives a satisfactory fit of the theoretical curve to the experimental distribution for alpha energies less than 30 MeV. A study of the angular distributions of the emitted <b>particles</b> <b>alpha</b> shows that the emission is anisotropic, the distribution being peaked in the forward direction; this peaking is more pronounced at 6 BeV than at 27 BeV. In both cases, the forward peaking appears to be due exclusively to <b>alpha</b> <b>particles</b> of energy greater than 30 MeV. We may conclude, therefore, that these higher-energy particles are probably associated with secondary interactions provoked by the cascade, rather than with the pure evaporation process. In an attempt to understand the processes of interaction of 6 BeV protons with heavy nuclei, the angular distributions of the black tracks have been studied for stars previously analyzed in terms of the charged pi-meson distribution. The results are discussed for the cases when the incident proton collides: (a) with a single nucleon in the target nucleus, and (b) with 3 to 5 target nucleons. The results indicate that the interactions with a single target nucleon occur at the periphery of the nucleus, the two nucleons then leaving the nucleus without initiating a cascade.

The ATD system must be properly calibrated to provide accurate estimations of indoor radon levels. Calibration of the ATD system requires relating the average observed track density on the film (tracks cm') to the integrated radon exposure (kBq hr m-'). This relationship is termed the ATD calibration constant (tracks CM- 2 per kBq hr m-'). The ATD calibration constant for LR 115 II type detectors was calculated using a Monte Carlo computer code. The <b>alpha</b> <b>particle</b> propagation was simulated using random trajectories and the range-energy curves for <b>alpha</b> <b>particles</b> in air (ICRU 1993). Film response calculations were based upon an analytical expression for the track forming probability of LR 115 II (Damkjaer 1986). The fractions of radon progeny plating out on the inner surfaces of the container were estimated using diffusion theory. The <b>alpha</b> <b>particle</b> energy/angular <b>spectrum</b> found at the detector film surface was characterized. Investigations into the effects of changes in ambient atmospheric pressure (simulating changes in altitude) and canister geometry on the calibration coefficient were also performed. The calibration coefficient was determined to be 1. 65 (tracks cm' per kBq hr m-'). The detector response varied inversely with the ambient pressure. The detector response was non-linear producing a 20 % increase in the response for a 17 kPa (5 in. Hg) drop in ambient pressure, and a 14 % decrease in the response for a 17 kPa (5 in. Hg) increase in ambient pressure. Effects from differences in altitude or ambient pressure can be compensated through the use of these correction factors. The optimum canister geometry was determined to be 3. 75 cm (1. 5 inches) in height with a radius of at least 5 cm (2 inches). This ATD configuration results in an increase of the calibration coefficient to 1. 81 tracks CM- 2 per kBq hr m-') ...|$|R

In an experiment where they shot a beam of <b>alpha</b> <b>particles</b> through hydrogen, the <b>alpha</b> <b>particles</b> knocked the hydrogen nuclei forwards {{in the direction of}} the beam, not backwards. In an experiment where they shot <b>alpha</b> <b>particles</b> through nitrogen, he discovered that the <b>alpha</b> <b>particles</b> knocked hydrogen nuclei (i.e. protons) out of the nitrogen nuclei.|$|R

Some {{highlights of the}} research activities {{during the past year}} are given. Work continues at a rapid pace toward completion of the Sudbury Neutrino Observatory in January 1997. Following four years of planning and development, installation of the acrylic vessel began last July and is now 50 % complete, with final completion scheduled for September. The Russian-American Gallium Experiment (SAGE) has completed a successful {sup 51 }Cr neutrino source experiment. The first data from {sup 8 }B decay have been taken in the Mass- 8 CVC/Second Class Current study. The analysis of the measured barrier distributions for Ca-induced fission of prolate {sup 192 }Os and oblate {sup 194 }Pt has been completed. In a collaboration with a group from the Bhabha Atomic Research Centre they have shown that fission anisotropies at energies well above the barrier are not influenced by the mass asymmetry of the entrance channel relative to the Businaro-Gallone critical asymmetry. They also have preliminary evidence at higher bombarding energy that noncompound nucleus fission scales with the mean square angular momentum, in contrast to previous suggestions. The authors have measured proton and <b>alpha</b> <b>particle</b> emission <b>spectra</b> from the decay of A {approximately} 200 compound nuclei at excitation energies of 50 [...] 100 MeV, and used these measurements to infer the nuclear temperature. The investigations of multiparticle Bose-Einstein interferometry have led to a new algorithm for putting Bose-Einstein and Coulomb correlations of up to 6 th order into Monte Carlo simulations of ultra-relativistic collision events, and to a new fast algorithm for extracting event temperatures...|$|R
