5|$|I didn't {{even know}} the project was coming out. I didn't know what the beat was for; I just knew Eminem <b>asked</b> <b>me</b> <b>for</b> the files and I sent it to them.... When I saw Eminem in L.A. for Grammy weekend, Eminem said, 'Yeah, he ripped the track.' Later on that day, I met Royce, and Royce was like, 'Yeah, {{download}} that track man. We ripped that track. That's the first single.' I was like, 'What?' But until then, I still wasn't sure.|$|E
500|$|Around 1907, Caion's {{paper was}} hosting poems {{by the young}} Symbolist author George Bacovia (including [...] "Sonnet" [...] and [...] "Pulvis") and art chronicles by Theodor Cornel. Bacovia {{described}} their first encounter, in November 1903, as follows: [...] "Caion [...] was very depressed after his recently completed trial with Caragiale. My solitary presence, without any sort of recommendation from another author, made him receive me with significant reserve. I then communicated the purpose of my arrival, asking for the address of his collaborator, the poet Macedonski. Nevertheless, he still <b>asked</b> <b>me</b> <b>for</b> a handful of poems, the ones later published by his magazine." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Badlaa" [...] {{was written}} by John Shiban and {{inspired}} by stories of Indian fakirs. In fact, the episode's title means [...] "to retort" [...] or [...] "to revenge" [...] in Urdu. Further inspiration came [...] "from {{a little bit of}} desperation" [...] according to Shiban. He later recalled that he was walking through the Vancouver airport and suddenly had the thought, [...] "What if someone who {{came up to me and}} <b>asked</b> <b>me</b> <b>for</b> money was actually a bad guy." [...] Shiban later noted that his early drafts of the episode featured the antagonist with a different power. He explained, [...] "My original idea was a beggar with no legs who can actually shrink himself and climb inside your ear, and Chris Carter–and this is why he's Chris Carter–said 'No, no, no! I know what's even better.'" [...] Shiban later said that [...] "... one thing about this episode that I'm sort of proud is that people often have told me that it is the most disgusting thought that they ever had, that this little man would actually enter your body and travel around inside you." ...|$|E

5000|$|MGM was <b>asking</b> <b>me</b> <b>for</b> more Lovin' Spoonful albums, {{claiming}} that I owed them … At that point, Bob Cavallo went to Mo Ostin. They {{had a very}} good relationship, and it was Mo's feeling that MGM was <b>asking</b> <b>me</b> <b>for</b> something that wasn't theirs to ask. He said, [...] "Look, I'll buy this contract out." [...] That was really what happened.|$|R

500|$|The third single [...] "911 Is a Joke" [...] {{features}} Flavor Flav as {{the lead}} MC. He was given the idea by Chuck D to write the song. As Flav recalled, [...] "I went and got high and wrote the record. I went and got ripped, I went {{and got out of}} my mind, and I started speaking all kinds of crazy shit 'cos usually {{back in the days when}} I used to smoke, it used to broaden my ideas and everything". The humorous and satirical subject matter is reflected in its music video, which featured a severely injured Flav being mistreated by a remiss, overdue ambulance staff. Another Flavor Flav-solo track, the fifth single [...] "Can't Do Nuttin' for Ya Man", has lyrics advocating African-American self-reliance and denouncing welfare dependence. It also reflects on Flav's experiences with acquaintances from poor neighborhoods. He said of his inspiration for the song, [...] "I was in my Corvette riding from Long Island going to The Bronx. I was slipping. I was roasting. I mean I was smoked-out crazy. And everybody kept asking me for stuff and yet nobody wanted to give me stuff. So then if anybody ever <b>asked</b> <b>me</b> <b>for</b> something I would be like, 'Yo, I can't do nothing for ya man.' Next thing you know I started to vibe on it: 'I can't do nothing for ya man,' um ahh um um ahh. So I went and told that to Chuck. Chuck was like, 'Record that shit man'". Writing of both tracks, music critic Tom Moon comments that Flav [...] "affects a tone of gimme-a-break sarcasm that is crucial to both tracks, and is welcome respite from Chuck D.'s assault". [...] "Can't Do Nuttin' for Ya Man" [...] was featured in the 1990 comedy film House Party.|$|E

2500|$|Some {{time after}} the article was published, Bay changed his stance, {{claiming}} that his apology only related to the editing of the film, not the whole film, and accused the writer of the article for taking his words out of context. The author of the article, Miami Herald writer Rene Rodriguez claimed: [...] "NBC <b>asked</b> <b>me</b> <b>for</b> a response, and I played them the tape. I didn't misquote anyone. All the sites that picked up the story did." ...|$|E

2500|$|... "The initial {{impetus for}} {{creating}} the Xeric Foundation was frustration -- when the Turtle thing started getting really huge, people started {{coming out of the}} woodwork to ask for money. Many of them were legitimate charitable organizations or creators needing funding, but there were also quite a few ridiculous things -- like the total stranger who <b>asked</b> <b>me</b> <b>for</b> {{a quarter of a million}} dollars to fund his general store. It got to the point where I was getting overwhelmed with making these kinds of decisions, and it was suggested to me that a foundation might be a good way to [...] "separate the wheat from the chaff", providing official and clearly delineated channels through which people looking for money had to make their way." ...|$|E
2500|$|At Miraflores, {{according}} to The Los Angeles Times, Chávez dispatched Rincón, his military chief of staff, {{to meet with}} the military officers at Fuerte Tiuna who were calling for him to step down. Rincón called Chávez from Fuerte Tiuna to say that the officers were [...] "fighting among themselves" [...] and insisting on his resignation. As The Chicago Tribune put it, [...] "top military commanders," [...] unable to countenance [...] "the spectacle of a president making war on his own people," [...] demanded that Chávez step down. Faced with this demand, Chávez [...] "started working the phones" [...] and also summoned a clergyman, Monsignor Maltazar Porras, to discuss [...] "prayer and forgiveness," [...] his purpose being [...] "maybe as much to search his soul as to search for {{a way out of the}} crisis." [...] Porras, whom Chávez had once reviled as one of the church's [...] "devils in skirts," [...] said that Chávez had [...] "personally <b>asked</b> <b>me</b> <b>for</b> forgiveness for everything he had said about me." ...|$|E
2500|$|On May 10, 1940, Germany {{launched}} the blitzkrieg offensive against France, Belgium, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg, {{and millions of}} refugees took to the roads. [...] On May 15, Sousa Mendes issued transit visas to Maria Tavares, a Luxembourg citizen of Portuguese origin, and to her husband Paul Miny, also a Luxembourger. Two weeks later, the couple returned to the Bordeaux Consulate asking Sousa Mendes to issue them false papers. Sousa Mendes agreed to their request, and on May 30, 1940, he issued a Portuguese passport listing Paul Miny as Maria's brother, therefore as having Portuguese citizenship. This time Sousa Mendes risked himself {{a great deal more}} than he had before; disobeying Dispatch 14 was one thing, but issuing a passport with a false identity, for someone of military age was a crime. Sousa Mendes later provided the following explanation: “This couple <b>asked</b> <b>me</b> <b>for</b> a Portuguese passport, where they would figure as brother and sister, for fear that the husband, who was still of military age, would be detained on passing the French border, and incorporated in the Luxembourg army then being organized in France." [...] Under the terms imposed by the German occupation of Luxembourg in World War II, that army was under Nazi control.|$|E
60|$|Why {{do you buy}} Associated Press dispatches? To {{make your}} paper the more salable, you answer. But why don't you try to beg them? Why do you discriminate? I can sell my stuff; why should I give it to you? Why don't you <b>ask</b> <b>me</b> <b>for</b> a shirt? What is the {{difference}} between <b>asking</b> <b>me</b> <b>for</b> the worth of a shirt and <b>asking</b> <b>me</b> <b>for</b> the shirt itself? Perhaps you didn't know you were begging. I would not use that argument--it makes the user a fool. The passage of poetry--or prose, if you will--which has taken deepest root in my thought, and which I oftenest return to and dwell upon with keenest no matter what, is this: That the proper place for journalists who solicit literary charity is on the street corner with their hats in their hands.|$|R
