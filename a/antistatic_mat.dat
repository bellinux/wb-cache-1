50|$|An {{antistatic}} wrist strap, ESD wrist strap, {{or ground}} bracelet is an antistatic device used to safely ground a person working on very sensitive electronic equipment, {{to prevent the}} buildup of static electricity on their body, which can result in electrostatic discharge (ESD). It {{is used in the}} electronics industry by workers working on electronic devices which can be damaged by ESD, and also sometimes by people working around explosives, to prevent electric sparks which could set off an explosion. It consists of an elastic band of fabric with fine conductive fibers woven into it, attached to a wire with a clip on the end to connect it to a ground conductor. The fibers are usually made of carbon or carbon-filled rubber, and the strap is bound with a stainless steel clasp or plate. They are usually used in conjunction with an <b>antistatic</b> <b>mat</b> on the workbench, or a special static-dissipating plastic laminate on the workbench surface.|$|E
5000|$|An <b>{{antistatic}}</b> floor <b>mat</b> {{or ground}} mat {{is one of}} a number of antistatic devices designed to help eliminate static electricity. It does this by having a controlled low resistance: a metal mat would keep parts grounded but would short out exposed parts; an insulating mat would provide no ground reference and so would not provide grounding. Typical resistance is on the order of 105 to 108 ohms between points on the mat and to ground. [...] The mat would need to be grounded (earthed). This is usually accomplished by plugging into the grounded line in an electrical outlet. It's important to discharge at a slow rate, therefore a resistor should be used in earthing the mat. The resistor, as well as allowing high-voltage charges to leak through to earth, also prevents a shock hazard when working with low-voltage parts. Some ground mats allow you to connect an antistatic wrist strap to them. Versions are designed for placement on both the floor and desk.|$|R
