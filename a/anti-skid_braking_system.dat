500|$|Because {{of the way}} Concorde's delta-wing {{generated}} lift, the undercarriage had to be unusually {{strong and}} tall {{to allow for the}} angle of attack at low speed. At rotation, Concorde would rise to a high angle of attack, about 18 degrees. Prior to rotation the wing generated almost no lift, unlike typical aircraft wings. Combined with the high airspeed at rotation (199 knots indicated airspeed), this increased the stresses on the main undercarriage {{in a way that was}} initially unexpected during the development and required a major redesign. Due to the high angle needed at rotation, a small set of wheels were added aft to prevent tailstrikes.

50|$|Modern {{automobiles}} have complex instrumentation. In {{addition to}} displays of {{engine rotational speed}} and vehicle linear speed, there are also displays of battery voltage and current, fluid levels, fluid temperatures, distance traveled and feedbacks of various controls (turn signals, parking brake, headlights, transmission position). Cautions may be displayed for special problems (fuel low, check engine, tire pressure low, door ajar, seat belt unfastened). Problems are recorded {{so they can be}} reported to diagnostic equipment. Navigation systems can provide voice commands to reach a destination. Automotive instrumentation must be cheap and reliable over long periods in harsh environments. There may be independent airbag systems which contain sensors, logic and actuators. <b>Anti-skid</b> <b>braking</b> <b>systems</b> use sensors to control the brakes, while cruise control affects throttle position.

5000|$|The {{relatively}} high wing loading (weight/wing area) required a high landing speed of 180 kn. To shorten the landing roll, Air Force test pilot Major Guy Townsend promoted {{the addition of}} a 32 ft German-invented [...] "ribbon" [...] drag chute (thrust reversers had not then been developed).

5000|$|Additionally, due to {{the high}} average {{take-off}} speed of 250 mph, Concorde needed upgraded brakes. Like most airliners, Concorde has <b>anti-skid</b> <b>braking</b> - a <b>system</b> which prevents the tyres from losing traction when the brakes are applied for greater control during roll-out. The brakes, developed by Dunlop, were the first carbon-based brakes used on an airliner. The use of carbon over equivalent steel brakes provided a weight-saving of 1200 lb. Each wheel has multiple discs which are cooled by electric fans. Wheel sensors include brake overload, brake temperature, and tyre deflation. After a typical landing at Heathrow, brake temperatures were around [...] For landing Concorde required a minimum of 6000 ft runway length, this in fact being considerably less than the shortest runway Concorde ever actually landed on, that of Cardiff Airport.|$|R

As pressure servo valve realizes the pressure closed loop by hydraulic feedback loop, this structure increased {{the complexity of}} the processing and manufacturing, restricted the pressure closed loop parameters adjustment, and increased the difficulty of debugging the system design. Pressure servo valve is expensive and difficult to process, poor ability to resist pollution. This paper proposed a slip ratio large closed loop aircraft <b>anti-skid</b> <b>brake</b> control method based on high-speed on-off valve, built the model of aircraft ground vertical taxiing and slip ratio large closed loop control algorithm in the MATLAB/SIMULINK, and built the model of aircraft hydraulic <b>brake</b> <b>system</b> based on on-off valve in the AMESim and a joint simulation was carried out.

5000|$|Pilots of {{the early}} A-7s lauded the {{aircraft}} for general ease of flying (with the exceptions of poor stability on crosswind landings and miserable stopping performance on wet runways with an inoperative <b>anti-skid</b> <b>braking</b> <b>system)</b> and excellent forward visibility but noted a lack of engine thrust. This was addressed with A-7B and more thoroughly with A-7D/E. The turbofan engine provided {{a dramatic increase in}} fuel efficiency compared with earlier turbojets - the A-7D was said to have specific fuel consumption one sixth that of an F-100 Super Sabre at equivalent thrust. An A-7D carrying 12 x 500 lb (227 kg) bombs at 480 mph (775 km/h) at 33,000 ft (10,000 m) used only 3,350 lb (1,500 kg) of fuel per hour. Typical fuel consumption at mission retrograde during aircraft carrier recovery was approximately 30 pounds per minute compared to 100+ pounds per minute for the Phantom F-4J/N series.

5000|$|Southwest Air Lines Flight 611 {{took off}} on runway 36 from Naha Airport {{on the island of}} Okinawa at 13:09 for a regular flight to Ishigaki Airport, Japan. The {{aircraft}} climbed to the cruising altitude of Flight level 240 (approximately 24,000 ft/7,315 m). On approach to Ishigaki, the crew was given weather information for Ishigaki [...] - [...] wind 300 degrees at 12 knots; temperature 32 degrees C (89.6 degrees F); active runway: Runway 22. The crew of Flight 611 made a crosswind landing at a speed slightly higher than the reference airspeed. The aircraft bounced and on touching down again the spoilers and thrust reversers did not seem to operate. The flight crew shut down both engines but this action disabled the <b>anti-skid</b> <b>braking</b> <b>system,</b> and during the landing rolls the inner tires on both main gear legs burst almost simultaneously. Flight 611 overran the runway and came to rest 145 meters (476 feet) beyond the threshold at 13:49. Everyone on board was evacuated. At 14:01 the Boeing 737 caught fire and was destroyed.|$|E
50|$|At 06:45 UTC, {{the plane}} touched down hard, {{approximately}} 1030 ft past {{the threshold of}} Runway 33, at a speed of approximately 200 kn, bounced once and then touched down again, approximately 2800 ft from the threshold. Maximum emergency braking was applied and retained, and the plane {{came to a stop}} 7600 ft from the threshold of that 10000 ft runway. Since the <b>anti-skid</b> and <b>brake</b> modulation <b>systems</b> were inoperative, the eight main wheels locked up; the tires abraded and fully deflated within 450 ft. Fourteen passengers and two crew members suffered minor injuries, while two passengers suffered serious injuries during the evacuation of the aircraft.

40|$|Abstract- Aircraft {{brake system}} plays a very {{important}} role in the safe takeoff and landing.

So we use <b>anti-skid</b> <b>braking</b> <b>system</b> which will prevent tires from slipping extremely on the track and ensure aircraft landing safety and stability with maximum braking efficiency. Estimate of the slip is estimated using a technique called H ∞ filter design. The purpose of estimation is to make the slip, error free, from the noises coming out from the sensors and other measuring devices which affect the system parameters.

40|$|The {{main purpose}} of this work is the {{development}} of an intelligent <b>anti-skid</b> <b>braking</b> <b>system</b> for business jet that would allow the maintenance of good performance during braking in all types of track conditions. In fact, one of the main problems in abs controllers modelling is due to the significantly variation of the optimal value of the friction coefficient closely related to the track conditions (dry, wet, icy); so it is extremely difficult to define a controller that ensures optimal braking performance in all environmental conditions. This study has involved the design of two controllers, based on computational intelligence techniques such as Artificial Neural Networks and Fuzzy Logic. In fact, AI is an excellent tool for the development of procedures dedicated to control systems which are complex and nonlinear like abs controllers. The application of these techniques seems particularly appropriate in the case of inadequate physical models {{as in the case of}} friction between wheels and track. The developed controllers make possible to operate in an unstable equilibrium point in order to achieve optimum braking performance...|$|E
