500|$|... "We really shot it — {{some people}} in the video did not know we were filming. I think the real idea of the video is in <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> <b>like</b> that— in a private moment like that, she can never be by herself... This song is not about someone who feels those emotions, it's about Beyoncé feeling those emotions. It's {{personal}} to her. It's her that cannot be by herself no matter where she goes or what she does, because she's who she is." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{accordance}} with the Marxist doctrine that history is made by collective action, not individuals, Eisenstein forbore to single out any person in his film, but rather focused on the [...] "mass protagonist". Soviet film critics hailed this approach, including the dramaturge and critic, Adrian Piotrovsky, writing for the Leningrad newspaper Krasnaia gazeta: The hero is the sailors' battleship, the Odessa crowd, but characteristic figures are snatched here and there from the crowd. For <b>a</b> <b>moment,</b> <b>like</b> a conjuring trick, they attract all the sympathies of the audience: like the sailor Vakulinchuk, like the young woman and child on the Odessa Steps, but they emerge only to dissolve once more into the mass. This signifies: no film stars but a film of real-life types.|$|E
500|$|Lithgow called Rita's death a [...] "fantastic choice", {{which he}} said shed a {{completely}} different light on the final scene between Dexter and Arthur, {{which appears to be}} somewhat sympathetic before the audience learned what Arthur had done. Lithgow said he knew that Arthur would be killed {{from the very beginning of}} the season. He said he particularly enjoyed working with Michael C. Hall in [...] "The Getaway", and particularly cited the opening scene in the police station, where he said Hall was [...] "so great at working out the rhythms and finding the real meaning" [...] of the moment where Dexter realizes Arthur has the advantage over him. Lithgow also said he enjoyed their final scene together, including the moment where he realized his daughter had committed suicide: [...] "It's very unusual for a character that despicable to have <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> <b>like</b> that, a moment of such pain." ...|$|E
60|$|Then {{there was}} a little more trite {{conversation}} between Mr. Arabin and Mr. Harding--trite, and hard, and vapid, and senseless. Neither of them had anything to say to the other, and yet neither at such <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> <b>liked</b> to remain silent. At last Mr. Harding, taking advantage of a pause, escaped out of the room, and Eleanor and Mr. Arabin were left together.|$|R
60|$|She {{moved her}} eyes away {{and had to}} {{disengage}} her hand to which he clung for <b>a</b> <b>moment,</b> giddy, <b>like</b> <b>a</b> man {{falling out of the}} world.|$|R
6000|$|LORD W. That's--very deep--very dip. D'you mind lending me your note-book <b>a</b> <b>moment.</b> I'd <b>like</b> {{to stick}} that down. All right, I'll use the other end. [THE PRESS hands it hypnotically.] ...|$|R
500|$|Curry {{stated that}} the [...] "first few drafts of [...] focused on a 12-year-old boy and a mother's trial {{of trying to get}} her son out of this boy's clutches, and gradually, it became {{something}} else". In the original script, Claire was [...] "happily married", but Curry chose to have her separated due to her husband's infidelity, so that she could be a [...] "more sympathetic character". Curry was influenced by the real-life story of Mary Kay Letourneau, a teacher who became involved with her underage student, causing her to be convicted for rape charges. Director Rob Cohen revealed that in Curry's draft, the character of Noah was younger, but he made the conscious decision to age him to 19, because he felt as if it was [...] "not healthy" [...] and that audiences would lose sympathy for the protagonist. Explaining her character, Lopez stated that Claire was feeling [...] "worthless" [...] after her husband cheated, and [...] "People can understand that. They can understand making a mistake in <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> <b>like</b> that." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Israelis {{said they}} have found explosive-making labs and {{factories}} for assembling Qassam II rockets. One Israeli special forces commander who fought in the camp said that [...] "the Palestinians were admirably well prepared. They correctly analyzed {{the lessons of the}} previous raid". Mardawi told CNN from prison in Israel, that after learning the IDF was going to use troops, and not planes, [...] "It was like hunting … like being given a prize. … The Israelis knew that any soldier who went into the camp like that was going to get killed. … I've been waiting for <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> <b>like</b> that for years".|$|E
60|$|The doctor {{paused for}} <b>a</b> <b>moment,</b> <b>like</b> a man {{collecting}} his thoughts.|$|E
60|$|Alton said nothing, {{and for an}} hour {{they were}} busy about the camp. Then as they stood <b>a</b> <b>moment,</b> loaded <b>like</b> beasts of burden, under the {{dripping}} pines, Seaforth held out his hand.|$|R
6000|$|... "Confound it, old man," [...] drawled Blythe, [...] "why do you spoil <b>a</b> golden <b>moment</b> <b>like</b> {{this with}} business? I {{wanted to see}} you--well, this has the preference." [...] He gulped down his brandy, and gazed longingly into the empty glass.|$|R
60|$|Then for {{the first}} time the drawn-faced, hungry-eyed giant turned his gaze upon Duane. He had {{intelligence}} which was not yet subservient to passion. Moreover, he seemed the kind of man Duane would care to have judge him in <b>a</b> critical <b>moment</b> <b>like</b> this.|$|R
60|$|She awaited his explanations. Benham {{looked for}} <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> <b>like</b> his father.|$|E
60|$|Pritchard {{covered his}} face with his hands for <b>a</b> <b>moment,</b> <b>like</b> a child {{shutting}} out an ugliness.|$|E
6000|$|The Queen turned crimson with fury, and, after {{glaring at}} her for <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> <b>like</b> a wild beast, screamed 'Off with her head! Off--' ...|$|E
6000|$|The world changed, for Redwood. For <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> {{something}} <b>like</b> hysteria had {{the muscles}} {{of his face and}} throat. Then he gave vent to a profound [...] "Ah!" [...] His heart bounded towards exultation. [...] "The Giants have held their own!" ...|$|R
60|$|And {{she laughed}} {{a little on}} a low note. I don’t know about Mills, but the subdued shadowy {{vibration}} of it echoed in my breast which felt empty for <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> and <b>like</b> <b>a</b> large space that makes one giddy.|$|R
60|$|Wetzel, {{in taking}} his {{position}} for the race, had faced the river. Mrs. Zane had seen him start suddenly, straighten up and for <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> stand <b>like</b> <b>a</b> statue. Her exclamation drew he attention of the others to the hunter.|$|R
60|$|AUGUSTUS. What matters {{the death}} rate of Little Pifflington in <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> <b>like</b> this? Think of our gallant soldiers, not of your squalling infants.|$|E
6000|$|Hawkeye {{regarded}} him <b>a</b> <b>moment,</b> <b>like</b> {{one who knew}} not how to take the question; then nodding his head, he answered, still laughing, though inaudibly,-- ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What! desert ces braves, Ghita, at <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> <b>like</b> this!--Not {{to possess}} thy hand, dearest girl, could I {{be guilty of}} an act so base." ...|$|E
5000|$|... "Tonight, we say good-bye. But we {{will not}} forget. Open your eyes, look around and take <b>a</b> mental picture. <b>Moments</b> <b>like</b> this shall live on forever.|$|R
50|$|Despite his {{financial}} woes, Perry {{was invited to}} participate in the second debate, held at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library and hosted by CNN on September 16, where he needed <b>a</b> breakout <b>moment</b> <b>like</b> Fiorina's. However, Perry withdrew from the race before the debate and did not participate.|$|R
6000|$|... "He {{certainly}} does {{know how to}} do it, Bryan," [...] replied Frank; [...] "and it's a comfort to know that every thrust kills in <b>a</b> <b>moment.</b> I <b>like</b> to see as little of the appearance of cruelty as possible in work of this kind." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "They come!" [...] she exclaimed. [...] "Perhaps, June, it is {{my uncle}} or the Quartermaster. I cannot keep out even Mr. Muir at <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> <b>like</b> this." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I cannot desert poor Christine to the scorn of the world, in <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> <b>like</b> this! If I die of shame, I must {{go forward}} and own myself." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Then {{you are now}} first missed. Yes, that is it--and no wonder, Maud, {{it creates}} alarm. Merciful God! How must they all feel, at <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> <b>like</b> this!" ...|$|E
60|$|Jake {{hesitated for}} <b>a</b> <b>moment.</b> He <b>liked</b> {{the man and}} on the whole thought he could be trusted, while he {{imagined}} {{that he was not}} prompted by idle curiosity but knew something. Besides, Jake was often impulsive and ready, as he said, to back his judgment.|$|R
60|$|Outside greater {{darkness}} had gathered, heavy clouds {{obscured the}} light, and the gorgeous {{figure of the}} Cæsar now and then vanished into the dark angles of the room, reappearing <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> later <b>like</b> some threatening ghoul that comes and goes, blown by the wind which foretells the coming storm.|$|R
6000|$|Oft of {{some unknown}} Past such Fancies roll [...] Swift o'er my brain as make the Present seem [...] For <b>a</b> brief <b>moment</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> most strange dream [...] When not {{unconscious}} that she dreamt, the soul [...] Questions herself in sleep! {{and some have}} said [...] We lived ere yet this fleshly robe we wore.|$|R
6000|$|Lydgate, {{startled and}} jarred, {{looked up in}} silence for <b>a</b> <b>moment,</b> <b>like</b> {{a man who has}} been {{disturbed}} in his sleep. Then flushing with an unpleasant consciousness, he asked-- ...|$|E
60|$|The Phantom {{spread its}} dark robe before him for <b>a</b> <b>moment,</b> <b>like</b> a wing; and, {{withdrawing}} it, revealed a room by daylight, where {{a mother and}} her children were.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{have heard}} this before," [...] Dunham at length replied. [...] "Ah, Mabel! it is strange {{for the parent}} to lean on the child at <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> <b>like</b> this!" ...|$|E
60|$|The {{question}} was not answered for, at that <b>moment,</b> <b>a</b> sound <b>like</b> a loud deep sigh was heard overhead. The natives started back; and even Stanley felt, for <b>a</b> <b>moment,</b> uncomfortable.|$|R
60|$|He drew a low {{chair for}} {{her into the}} little circle of light and {{arranged}} some cushions. As she sank into it, she suddenly {{looked up at him}} and smiled, a smile of rare and wonderful beauty. Dominey felt for <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> something <b>like</b> the stab of a knife at his heart.|$|R
60|$|There {{was little}} need for Hiram to thus incite us. I was strung {{up to the}} highest tension until {{it seemed as if}} all the nerves in my body had {{suddenly}} been laid bare, and <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> appeared <b>like</b> <b>a</b> half-hour, so keenly did I realize that the critical time had come.|$|R
