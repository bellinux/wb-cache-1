50|$|SIA Standards {{developed}} and maintains the ANSI/SIA CP-01-False Alarm Reduction Standard. The standard generally specifies {{the design for}} controls of security alarm systems at the control panel. The specification focuses chiefly on the <b>arming</b> <b>and</b> <b>disarming</b> process, {{which is responsible for}} generating many false alarms. The standard is chiefly used by manufacturers and security system installers. SIA last revised the standard in 2010 to add some clarifications.|$|E

They may control special functions, such as auditing of voting machines, operation of power tools or equipment, enabling of security alarm systems (e.g., <b>arming</b> <b>and</b> <b>disarming),</b> or restocking of vending machines. A very commonly seen tamper-resistant switch is the ignition switch in most motor vehicles.|$|E
5000|$|Residential burglar alarms can {{be caused}} by {{improper}} <b>arming</b> <b>and</b> <b>disarming</b> of the system, power outages and weak batteries, wandering pets, and unsecured doors and windows. [...] In the U.S. false alarms cost police agencies up 6.5 million personnel hours, according to the International Association of Chiefs of Police. [...] A 2002 study by the U.S. Justice Department estimated the cost of false alarms to be as high as $1.5 billion. [...] Due to this cost, many cities now require permits for burglar alarms, have enacted verified response protocols, or have introduced fines for excessive false alarms.|$|E

Should the plane enter a dive, the system automatically applies counter-control {{to reduce the}} likelihood of a crash. It also detects and avoids overcompensation of the controls, one of the leading causes of crashes by inexperienced pilots. As skills develop, the ACT is easily disabled by pulling the throttle stick downward and holding it for three seconds. The plane beeps twice to signify the ACT is turned off. Rearming the ACT is accomplished in the same manner and will cause the plane to beep once. <b>Arming</b> <b>and</b> <b>disarming</b> the ACT can be done in flight if desired.|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} of this thesis is defining the feasibility of using an Inductive Wireless Power and Data transfer system (IWPD) as sounding rocket umbilical. An Umbilical is used to supply power and communicate with the rocket in the last moments before launch. The power is used to keep the batteries fully charged and the communication is used for <b>arming</b> <b>and</b> <b>disarming</b> procedures. An IWPD system uses magnetically coupled coils, or inductors, to transfer power and data. This principle is used in transformers where a magnetic core creates a high coupling. In the umbilical the coils cannot be placed around a single core. This {{comes from the fact}} that one coil is outside the rocket and one coil is inside the rocket. Coupling of two coils separated by air is obtained by the magnetic field they produce. The coupling is defined as the magnetic field shared by the two coils in reference to the field that only passes one of the coils. To determine the coupling a simplified model was made which allowed the coupling to be plotted to the distance between the coils. The power transfer between a pair of coupled coils is dependent on the coupling between the coils. The magnetic field will not dissipate energy unless it goes through conductive materials. This means that magnetic energy is stored in the field and can be reclaimed. Making the inductors resonate with the addition of capacitors keeps the energy in the circuit. This resonance makes the power transfer non linear to the coupling of the coils. Circuit calculations are presented to determine the transfer of the IWPD in respect to frequency, supply and load conditions. The transfer is then used to determine the best setup to be used for an IWPD umbilical. The resonance of the system is used as frequency response of an oscillator. This oscillator is used to overcome the frequency shift of the system. The proposed system is compared with a more conventional umbilical. This comparison is made in three fields. Performance, Interference and Safety. In Performance an IWPD is as suited for the task as conventional system. Both will be able of supplying sufficient power and date. In Interference the IWPD is much better. It separates the umbilical from the skin and structure of the rocket. For Safety the results are balanced. The conventional systems perform better on electromagnetic interference (EMI). While the IWPD performs better on Electrostatic discharge (ESD). The IWPD might perform less on EMI this however does not have to be a problem. Increasing the electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) of the electronics and the distance to dangerous materials in the rocket will create a safe working situation.

50|$|The {{concept of}} <b>armed</b> <b>and</b> <b>disarmed</b> {{glycosyl}} donors {{refers to the}} increased reactivity of benzylated over benzoylated glycosyl donors, a phenomenon observed very early, and which originates from the greater electron-withdrawing capability of ester blocking groups over ether blocking groups. However, it was Bertram Fraser-Reid who realised that benzylated glycosyl donors can be activated when benzoylated are not, and invented the terms armed glycosyl donor to the former <b>and</b> <b>disarmed</b> glycosyl donor to the latter. He and his group showed that armed glycosyl donors could be coupled onto a glycosyl acceptor, {{that at the same}} time was a disarmed glycosyl donor, without self-coupling of the disarmed donor/acceptor. This methodology allowed him to perform a one-pot synthesis of a trisaccharide via the O-pentenyl method.|$|R
60|$|The shield ([Greek: aspis]), we {{are told}} by {{followers}} of Reichel, was only worn by princes who could afford to keep chariots, charioteers, and squires {{of the body to}} <b>arm</b> <b>and</b> <b>disarm</b> them. But this can scarcely be true, for all the comrades of Diomede had the shield ([Greek: aspis], Iliad, X. 152), and the whole host of Pandarus of Troy, a noted bowman, were shield-bearers ([Greek: aspistaon laon], Iliad, IV. 90), and some of them held their shields ([Greek: sakae]) in front of Pandarus when he took a treacherous shot at Menelaus (IV. 113). The whole host could not have chariots and squires, we may presume, so the chariot was not indispensable to the écuyer or shield-bearing man.|$|R

50|$|Burglar {{alarm systems}} are also available. These systems contain door/window sensors, {{as well as}} motion sensors that use a coded radio {{frequency}} (RF) signal to identify when they are tripped or just to routinely check-in and give a heart-beat signal {{to show that the}} system is still active. Users can <b>arm</b> <b>and</b> <b>disarm</b> their system via several different remote controls that also use a coded RF signal to ensure security. When an alarm is triggered the console will make an outbound telephone call with a recorded message. The console will also use X10 protocols to flash lights when an alarm has been triggered while the security console sounds an external siren. Using X10 protocols, signals will also be sent to remote sirens for additional security.|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{the project}} is to design a {{wireless}} based home security with automation system. The system uses wireless technology to revolutionize the standards of living which could give assurance for user to protect their homes from burglars, thieves and criminals. This project is so versatile and is equipped with various sensors such as passive infrared sensor, magnetic switch sensor and vibration sensor to detect different forms of intrusion. A microcontroller is used to control the system operation while a remote gadget is used to <b>arm</b> <b>and</b> <b>disarm</b> the system. To ensure only the authorized user can operate the system, the gadget {{is equipped with a}} password. Various indication outputs such as BUZZER, LED and LCD are used to display the alarm status. In addition, the sound indicators like siren are also included in the design to inform intrusion. Due to the consideration of user-friendliness, portability as well as wider-area coverage, all the sensors and remote gadget are implemented using zigbee transceiver. A backup battery module is also introduced in the design to ensure the system keep functioning even during power failure...|$|R
40|$|Chapter 1 describes, in a {{schematic}} manner, various {{approaches to the}} synthesis of the repeating disaccharide unit of H. pleuropneumoniae serotype 4 capsular polysaccharide. Chapter 2 describes an indirect use of thioglycosides, by conversion into glycosyl halides, and their direct use with promoters such as dimethyl (methylthio) sulfonium triflate (DMTST) and N-bromosuccinimide (NBS). Chapter 3 describes {{the development of the}} concept of active and latent thioglycosyl donors which combines the features of <b>armed</b> <b>and</b> <b>disarmed</b> glycosyl donors is presented. Reactivation of latent donor para-nitrophenyl thioglycoside is also proposed. In Chapter 4, we describe the synthesis of a complex series of thioglycosides under PTC conditions. During this approach we discovered that the use of the lipophilic PTC catalyst tretrabutylammonium hydrogen sulfate (TBAHS) (1 eq.) and ethyl acetate as solvent greatly improve the reaction rates. Chapter 5 presents our approaches to the stereospecific syntheses of 1, 2 -trans-aryl- 1 -thio-β-D-glycobiosides, active and latent tioglycosyl donors, as well as 1, 2 -trans-β-D-glycosyl phosphates by PTC. Chapter 6 describes our approaches to the synthesis of the repeating disaccharide unit of H. pleuropneumoniae serotype 4 (CPS) via thioglycosyl donors using different thiophilic promoters such as NBS, DMTST and N-iodosuccinimide (NIS) /trifluoromethanesulfonic acid (TfOH).

40|$|Home and {{commercial}} alarms {{are an integral}} physical security measure that have become so commonplace that little thought {{is given to the}} security that {{they may or may not}} provide. Whilst the focus has shifted from physical security in the past to cyber security in the present, physical security for protecting assets may be just as important for many business organisations. This research looks at 700 genuine alarm PIN codes chosen by users to <b>arm</b> <b>and</b> <b>disarm</b> alarm systems in a commercial environment. A comparison is made with a study of millions of PIN numbers unrelated to alarms to compare the results in order to allow a prediction of the alarm codes utilised in these systems. Results show that PIN number for alarm codes are often chosen differently than other PIN numbers and an analysis of the alarm codes gives an indication of how users choose codes. The codes are ranked in various groupings and results show that a non-sequential brute force attack against an alarm system using the results of this study greatly reduce the number of codes tried by an attacker before a disarming code is discovered. The results can be used to assist users in choosing codes that are less predictable than the codes that are often chosen today...|$|R
