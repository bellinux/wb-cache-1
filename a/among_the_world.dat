The 2000s saw Selle Français <b>among</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> leaders in both show jumping and three-day eventing. Four stallions made up the champion show jumping team at the 2002 World Equestrian Games, while four more Selle Francais made up the winning three-day event team at the 2004 Summer Olympics.

25|$|Parliamentary {{elections}} followed {{shortly after}} the presidential election where the opposition party garnered most of the seats, giving them the power to pass constitutional amendments.

In a sudden gesture, the government proclaimed a joint communiqué for reunification with North Korea on July 4, 1972, and held Red Cross talks in Seoul and Pyongyang. However, there was no change in government policy regarding reunification, and on October 17, 1972, Park declared martial law, dissolving the National Assembly and suspending the constitution.|$|E

25|$|In 1931, Japan invaded Manchuria, {{defeating}} the Republic of China's military forces and establishing Manchukuo, a puppet state. The Hoover administration deplored the invasion, but {{also sought to}} avoid antagonizing the Japanese, fearing that taking too strong a stand would weaken the moderate forces in the Japanese government. In response to the Japanese invasion, Hoover and Secretary of State Henry Stimson outlined the Stimson Doctrine, which held that the United States would not recognize territories gained by force. The Hoover administration based this declaration on the 1928 Kellogg-Briand Pact, in which several nations (including Japan and the United States) renounced war and promised to peacefully solve disputes. In the aftermath of invasion of Manchuria, Stimson {{and other members of}} the Cabinet came to believe that war with Japan might be inevitable, though Hoover continued to push for disarmament <b>among</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> powers.|$|E

500|$|Despite Bernstein's own musical antipathies, Adams {{claims the}} {{conductor}} generally remained open-minded and curious enough [...] "to try something at least once." [...] <b>Among</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> premieres of [...] "difficult" [...] works he led were Olivier Messiaen's Turangalîla-Symphonie in Boston in 1949 and Carter's Concerto for Orchestra in New York in 1970; {{and despite his}} apparent lack of identification with Carter's music, he described the composer in 1975 as [...] "a brilliant mind and a supremely intelligent musician." [...] Bernstein conducted Connotations again {{during the first week}} of regular Philharmonic concerts in 1963 and included it among the pieces the orchestra played on its European tour in February 1963. He would also commission a subsequent orchestral work from Copland, which became Inscape, and conduct Connotations again in an all-Copland concert with the New York Philharmonic in 1989. Even with this advocacy and the chance to familiarize himself at length, Connotations apparently remained a work that Bernstein did not conduct well. Critic Peter Davis, in his review of the 1989 performance, writes that while Connotations remained [...] "admittedly not a very lovable piece," [...] in Bernstein's hands it [...] "sounded more fulsome than portentous." ...|$|E

2500|$|After his safari, Roosevelt {{traveled}} North {{to embark}} on a tour of Europe. Stopping first in Egypt, he commented favorably on British rule of the region, giving his opinion that Egypt was not yet ready for independence, paralleling his views about the Philippines. He refused a meeting with the Pope due to a dispute over a group of Methodists active in Rome, but met with Emperor Franz Joseph of Austria-Hungary, Kaiser Wilhelm II of Germany, King George V of Great Britain, and other European leaders. In Oslo, Norway, Roosevelt delivered a speech calling for limitations on naval armaments, a strengthening of the Permanent Court of Arbitration, {{and the creation of a}} [...] "League of Peace" [...] <b>among</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> powers. He also delivered the Romanes Lecture at Oxford, in which he denounced those who sought parallels between the evolution of animal life and the development of society. Though Roosevelt attempted to avoid domestic politics during his time abroad, he met with Gifford Pinchot, who related his own disappointment with the Taft Administration. Pinchot had been forced to resign as head of the forest service after clashing with Taft's Interior Secretary, Richard Ballinger, who had prioritized development over conservation. Roosevelt returned to the United States in June 1910.|$|E
2500|$|... 1918, {{especially}} {{the second half}} of the year, also saw the United States increasingly involved. [...] While American volunteers had been flying in Allied squadrons since the early years of the war, not until 1918 did all-American squadrons begin active operations. Technically America had fallen well behind the European powers in aviation, and no American designed types saw action, with the exception of the Curtiss flying boats. At first, the Americans were largely supplied with second-rate and obsolete aircraft, such as the Nieuport 28, Sopwith 1½ Strutter, and Dorand AR.2 types, and inexperienced American airmen stood little chance against their seasoned opponents. As numbers grew and equipment improved with the introduction of the twin-gun SPAD XIII as well as the Sopwith Camel and even the S.E. 5a into American service near the war's end, the Americans came to hold their own in the air; although casualties were heavy, as indeed were those of the French and British, in the last desperate fighting of the war. [...] One of the French twin-seat reconnaissance aircraft used by the French and the USAAS, the Salmson 2.A2, was <b>among</b> <b>the</b> <b>World</b> War I-era aircraft to pioneer the use of [...] "fixed" [...] radial engines in military aircraft — the liquid-cooled radials designed by Georges Canton and Pierre Unné powered the 2.A2 aircraft, and were among the first [...] "fixed" [...] radial aircraft powerplants ever designed, and manufactured by the parent Société des Moteurs Salmson aircraft and automobile manufacturing firm, from 1908 to 1920.|$|E
