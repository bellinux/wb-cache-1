5|$|Furthermore, by 1795, {{the army}} had already made itself odious, by both rumor and action, {{throughout}} France through its dependence upon the countryside of material support and its general lawlessness and undisciplined behavior. After April 1796, the military was paid in metallic value, not the worthless paper, but pay was still well in arrears. The French Directory believed that war should pay for itself and did not budget to pay, feed, and equip its troops. Thus, <b>a</b> <b>campaign</b> <b>that</b> would take the army out of France became increasingly urgent for both budgetary and internal security reasons.|$|E
5|$|In 1219, in {{retaliation}} for the murders of his ambassadors, the Mongol Khan, Genghis Khan, invaded the Khwarezmian Empire. In <b>a</b> <b>campaign</b> <b>that</b> lasted three years, Genghis Khan and his generals destroyed the Khwarezmian armies and caused the empire to disintegrate. The Khwarezmian Sultan Ala ad-Din Muhammad succumbed to disease on an island in the Caspian Sea, leaving his son, Jalal ad-Din Mingburnu landless.|$|E

Gosiewski then ravaged Ducal Prussia, burning 13 towns and 250 villages, in <b>a</b> <b>campaign</b> <b>that</b> entered {{folklore}} {{because of the high}} death toll and the high number of captives deported to the Crimea.|$|E

5|$|The Byzantine forces, under Licario's command, now (in 1272/1273) {{launched}} <b>a</b> <b>campaign</b> <b>that</b> {{took the}} fortresses of Larmena, La Cuppa, Clisura and Manducho. The Lombard triarchs then appealed to their liege-lord, Prince William II of Achaea, and to Dreux de Beaumont, marshal of the Angevin Kingdom of Sicily. William {{was able to}} recover La Cuppa, but de Beaumont was defeated in a pitched battle and was subsequently recalled by Charles of Anjou. Between then and 1275, according to the Venetian chronicler Marino Sanudo, Licario himself served in the Byzantine army in Asia Minor, where he scored a victory against the Turks.|$|E
5|$|The Captaincy General of Chile {{followed}} a process analogous {{to that of}} the May Revolution, and elected a Government Junta that inaugurated the brief period known as Patria Vieja. The Junta was defeated in 1814 at the Battle of Rancagua, and the subsequent Reconquista of Chile would make it a royalist stronghold once more. The Andes provided an effective natural barrier between the Argentine revolutionaries and Chile, so there was no military confrontation between them until the Crossing of the Andes, led by José de San Martín in 1817, <b>a</b> <b>campaign</b> <b>that</b> resulted in the defeat of the Chilean royalists.|$|E

Finally, in 905 the Abbasids launched <b>a</b> <b>campaign</b> <b>that</b> rapidly brought {{about the end of}} Tulunid autonomy and fully re-incorporated their lands into the Caliphate.|$|E
5|$|A {{group of}} Andalusian exiles conquered Crete in c. 824 or in 827/828, quickly {{establishing}} an independent state. The Byzantines launched <b>a</b> <b>campaign</b> <b>that</b> took {{most of the}} island back in 842 and 843 under Theoktistos, but the reconquest was not completed and was soon reversed. Later attempts by the Byzantine Empire to recover the island failed, and for the approximately 135 years of its existence, the emirate {{was one of the}} major foes of Byzantium. Crete commanded the sea lanes of the Eastern Mediterranean and functioned as a forward base and haven for Muslim corsair fleets that ravaged the Byzantine-controlled shores of the Aegean Sea. The emirate's internal history is less well-known, but all accounts point to considerable prosperity deriving not only from piracy but also from extensive trade and agriculture. The emirate was brought to an end by Nikephoros Phokas, who launched a huge campaign against it in 960–961.|$|E
5|$|Additionally, in 1808, he {{was offered}} the {{position}} of First Squire of the Emperor in Napoleon's Military Household, a dignity that offered an annual revenue of 30,000 Francs and which gained importance when the Grand Squire, General Armand Augustin Louis de Caulaincourt, was sent to Saint-Petersburg as ambassador. Napoleon allegedly chose Nansouty for his elegant manners and education, aristocratic posture and talent for administration. In his capacity as First Squire, Nansouty thus had to accompany the Emperor during the latter's short campaign in Spain (from November 1808 to early January 1809). There, {{he was in charge}} of several administrative tasks linked with managing the Emperor's stable services and suite and commanding his orderly officers. The Emperor's aides-de-camp had their own aides-de-camp, who were also placed under the command of the First Squire. Although never very far away from the Emperor in <b>a</b> <b>campaign</b> <b>that</b> included many battles, Nansouty himself never exercised a field command during this campaign, and in January 1809, he accompanied his master back to France, as the outbreak of the War of the Fifth Coalition was imminent.|$|E

5|$|Count Herbert II of Maine died in 1062, and William, who had betrothed {{his eldest}} son Robert to Herbert's sister Margaret, claimed the county through his son. Local nobles {{resisted}} the claim, but William invaded and by 1064 had secured control of the area. William appointed a Norman to the bishopric of Le Mans in 1065. He also allowed his son Robert Curthose to do homage to the new Count of Anjou, Geoffrey the Bearded. William's western border was thus secured, but his border with Brittany remained insecure. In 1064 William invaded Brittany in <b>a</b> <b>campaign</b> <b>that</b> remains obscure in its details. Its effect, though, was to destabilise Brittany, forcing the duke, Conan II, to focus on internal problems rather than on expansion. Conan's death in 1066 further secured William's borders in Normandy. William also benefited from his campaign in Brittany by securing the support of some Breton nobles {{who went on to}} support the invasion of England in 1066.|$|E
5|$|Discouraged by {{an early}} defeat {{for a seat}} in the state legislature, Fields took a job at a grocery store in Ashland, Kentucky that allowed him to travel the state and meet many people in his congressional district. In 1911, he became the first Democrat elected to Congress from the Ninth District in two decades. Elected to seven {{consecutive}} terms, he rose to become the ranking member of the House Committee on Military Affairs during World War I. When Democratic gubernatorial nominee J. Campbell Cantrill died unexpectedly two months before the general election, the Democratic Central Committee chose Fields to replace Cantrill as the nominee. In <b>a</b> <b>campaign</b> <b>that</b> featured more name-calling than substantial debate, Fields secured the backing of the powerful Jockey Club political alliance and won a landslide victory over Republican Attorney General Charles I. Dawson.|$|E
5|$|Donnchadh's {{interests}} in the area were damaged when de Courcy lost his territory in eastern Ulster to his rival Hugh de Lacy in 1203. John de Courcy, with help from his wife's brother King Rǫgnvaldr Guðrøðarson (Raghnall mac Gofraidh) and perhaps from Donnchadh, tried to regain his principality, but was initially unsuccessful. De Courcy's fortunes were boosted when Hugh de Lacy (then Earl of Ulster) and his associate William III de Briouze, themselves fell foul of John; the king campaigned in Ireland against them in 1210, <b>a</b> <b>campaign</b> <b>that</b> forced de Briouze to return to Wales and de Lacy to flee to St Andrews in Scotland.|$|E

In the previous decade, Alexander II, King of Scotland (died 1249) had made several attempts to incorporate the Hebrides into the Scottish realm. In the 1260s, Alexander's son and successor, Alexander III, King of Scotland (died 1286), renewed his kingdom's struggle to wrest the region from Norwegian overlordship. In so doing, Alexander III provoked a retaliatory military response from Hákon, <b>a</b> <b>campaign</b> <b>that</b> ultimately ended in failure with the latter's weakening health and death in 1263.|$|E
5|$|The Confederate {{stronghold of}} Vicksburg, Mississippi blocked {{the way for}} {{complete}} Union control of the Mississippi River, making its capture vital for the Union War effort. Grant's Army held western Tennessee with almost 40,000 troops available to fight. Grant was aggravated to learn that Lincoln authorized McClernand to raise a separate army for the purpose. Halleck ordered McClernand to Memphis, and placed him and his troops under Grant's authority. After Grant's army captured Holly Springs Grant planned to attack Vicksburg's front overland while Sherman would attack the fortress from the rear on the Mississippi River. However, Confederate cavalry raids on December 11 and 20 broke Union communications and recaptured Holly Springs, preventing Grant's and Sherman's armies from connecting. On December 29, a Confederate army led by Lieutenant General John C. Pemberton repulsed Sherman's direct approach ascending the bluffs to Vicksburg at Chickasaw Bayou. McClernand reached Sherman's army, assumed command, and independently of Grant led <b>a</b> <b>campaign</b> <b>that</b> captured Confederate Fort Hindman. During this time Grant incorporated fleeing African American slaves into the Union Army giving them protection and paid employment.|$|E
5|$|The {{cessation}} of diplomatic relations between France and Madagascar prompted immediate French {{military action in}} <b>a</b> <b>campaign</b> <b>that</b> {{became known as the}} Second Franco-Hova War. The expedition ended eleven months later in September 1895 when a French military column reached Antananarivo and bombarded the royal palace with heavy artillery, blasting a hole through the roof of the queen's quarters and inflicting heavy casualties among the numerous courtiers gathered in the palace courtyard. Rainilaiarivony sent an interpreter to carry a white flag to the French commander and entreat his clemency. Forty-five minutes later he was joined by Radilifera, the Prime Minister's son, to request the conditions of surrender; these were immediately accepted. The following day Queen Ranavalona signed a treaty accepting the French protectorate over Madagascar. She and her court were permitted to remain at the palace and administer the country according to French dictates.|$|E
