50|$|When {{heading for}} a product, {{consumers}} (in)directly seek objective as well as subjective satisfaction. <b>Adequate</b> <b>packaging</b> can increase the consumer's feeling of identification with a product by, e.g., promoting a certain life-style or by conveying high quality, enhancing the product's ability of serving as a status symbol. Another important consumer type {{is the one that}} values health and a high quality of life above everything else. The proportion of packaging that promotes health benefits of the product and that conveys to the customer a certain feeling of doing something good for their health is steadily increasing. Another trend involves packaging that turns products into collectibles and make the packaging more valuable to the customer than the actual product itself. A good example of this trend is the Share a Coke marketing campaign by Coca-Cola, that was launched in Brazil in 2015, four years after the first campaign was launched in Australia. Colors transmit esthetics, yet post 2010 developments in the Brazilian packaging market show a rising preference of simple styles by customers.|$|E

While large amounts of federal funding have been allocated to public health laboratories, little federal funding has been allocated to hospital microbiology laboratories. There are concerns that hospital laboratories may have inadequate surge capacities to deal with a significant bioterrorism incident. A workflow analysis of a clinical microbiology laboratory that serves an urban medical center was performed to identify barriers to surge capacity in the setting of a bioterrorism event and to identify solutions to these problems. Barriers include a national shortage of trained medical technologists, the inability of clinical laboratories to deal with a dramatic {{increase in the number of}} blood cultures, a delay while manufacturers increase production of critical products and then transport and deliver these products to clinical laboratories, and a shortage of class II biological safety cabinets. Federal funding could remedy staffing shortages by making the salaries of medical technologists comparable to those of similarly educated health care professionals and by providing financial incentives for students to enroll in clinical laboratory science programs. Blood culture bottles, and possibly continuous-monitoring blood culture instruments, should be added to the national antibiotic stockpile. Federal support must ensure that companies that manufacture essential laboratory supplies are capable of rapidly scaling up production.

40|$|Cassava (Manihot esculenta Crantz) and yam (Dioscorea spp.) are {{tropical}} crops {{consumed by}} ca. 2 billion people {{and represent the}} main source of carbohydrate and energy for the approximately 700 million people living in the tropical and sub-tropical areas. They are a guarantee of food security for developing countries. The production of these crops and the transformation into food-derived commodities is increasing, it represents a profitable business and farmers generate substantial income from their market. However, there are some important concerns related to the food safety and food security. The high post-harvest losses, mainly for yam, the contamination by endogenous toxic compounds, mainly for cassava, and the contamination by external agents (such as micotoxins, pesticides, and heavy metal) represent a depletion of economic value and income. The loss in the raw crops or the impossibility to market the derived foodstuffs, due to incompliance with food regulations, can seriously limit all yam tubers and the cassava roots processors, from farmers to household, from small-medium to large enterprises.

40|$|Strawberry {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{delicate}} and perishable fruits. It is usually harvested fully ripe, suffering rapid deterioration under inadequate conditions (4). Promptly removal of field heat and <b>adequate</b> <b>packaging</b> can slow down quality changes and increase its shelf-life (1, 2, 5). Packaging of fruits in polymeric films is often used to prevent moisture loss, to protect against mechanical damage, and to provide for better appearance (3). However, packaging strawberries with polymeric films immediately after harvest, is not a common technique, and water loss may be considerable during storage. In this work, different times of delay to cooling were used to study the effects on strawberry quality, after harvest. The effect of a PVC film around the strawberries was also tested. Precooling with forced air was performed after o, 6 and 8 hours delay. Strawberries were then stored at 1 °C during one week. After conditioning strawberries at 20 °C for one day, physical and chemical properties were measured. 19 No significative differences were noticed in pH for all times of delay. Delays in precooling result in darker, less red fruit. Decreases in soluble solids and sugars in strawberries packed and unpacked with PVC film were noticed. Increases in firmness of unpacked strawberries were related to moisture loss. This was confirmed by the decrease of firmness of packed strawberries. The most significative changes in appearance were related to greater water loss in unpacked strawberries. Rapid precooling of fresh strawberries, and use of polymeric films immediately after harvest could be a useful practice in order to control deterioration...|$|E

Survey was also made in the wholesale and retail dried fish markets in Chittagong and Cox’s Bazar area. After harvesting, the small scale fishermen carry their catch to the landing centre in traditional bamboo baskets without using adequate ice and sell it to the pre-selected buyers or middlemen locally called ‘mohajan’. Both quantitative and qualitative losses occur in raw materials due to spoilage. Considerable post harvest losses also occur in fish before and after drying due to insect attack and contamination which amounts to about 10 - 30 % of the total catch. There is also widespread use of insecticides before and after drying to avoid insect infestation. In most cases the fishes which are not sold as fresh in the market are used as raw materials of the dried products. The overall organoleptic qualities of the dried products available in various marketing chains are very poor. There is a long marketing chain for fresh and dried products which include fishermen, purchase commission agents (fresh fish), processor, purchase commission agents (dried fish), wholesaler, retailer and finally the consumer. Due to the involvement of various middlemen in the different marketing chains, the price in each stage of marketing increases and finally the consumers buy the products with a higher price.

Structural characteristics of the package determine its ability to withstand the test conditions imposed. These characteristics include: package diameter, shell material and thickness, strength of internal fill material (e. g., fiberboard), and configuration of closure (clamp-ring, bolted flange, etc.). For the clamp-ring closure configuration a study of published drop test results has shown that packages having a weight ratio of less than 50 per cent were typically able to retain their lids in hypothetical accident condition, 30 -ft drop tests. Those having weight ratios greater than 50 per cent typically failed.

Furthermore, it allows also for a broader approach going beyond cost effective reduction of carbon emissions and energy use by taking into account co-benefits achieved in a renovation process. Besides impact indicators for primary energy use, carbon emissions and costs it also provides a methodological framework for integrating at least embodied energy use for renovation measures as part of a lifecycle impact assessment. The methodology and resulting fundamentals for renovation standards have to be applicable to different climatic and country specific situations. The Guideline for policy makers proposed by the Annex 56 gives useful information and suggestions to the drafting of legislative and administrative measures, at the national or local level, for reducing the amount of energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions in renovation of residential buildings. The reachable saving targets must be defined in agreement with the actors in the energy market, as the owners and / or the managers of buildings, but policy makers must be aware of their responsibility in defining cost effective levels for nearly zero energy or emissions building renovation, using a life cycle perspective, and the relevance of preparing <b>adequate</b> financial <b>packages</b> to support ambitious levels for building renovation.

Indeed, mapping procedural metrics to object-oriented systems should take into account the building principles of object-oriented programming: inheritance and late binding. Inheritance offers the possibility to create packages by just extending classes with the necessary increment of behavior. Late binding coupled to the " Hollywood Principle " are a key to build frameworks and let the users branch their extensions in the framework. Therefore, a package extending a framework does not have to be cohesive, since it inherits the framework logic, which is encapsulated in framework packages. In such a case, the correct modularization of an extender application may imply low cohesion for some of the packages. In this paper we confirm these conjectures on various real systems (JHotdraw, Eclipse, JEdit, JFace) using or extending OO frameworks. We carry out a dependency analysis of packages to measure their relation with their framework. The results show that framework dependencies form a considerable portion of the overall package dependencies. This means that non-cohesive packages should not be considered systematically as packages of low quality...|$|R

Most households (40. 9 %) used solid fuels such as fuelwood, coal, briquettes, pellets, agricultural residues and combinations of solid and other fuels...|$|R
40|$|The need {{to develop}} a highly {{accurate}} set of “as-found” condition documents presents a significant challenge in the practice of architecture for any project involving an existing building. For the majority of new buildings, an <b>adequate</b> construction documentation <b>package</b> can be developed simply by applying industry standards along with carefully engineered and well-detailed methods and materials. In contrast, projects involving intervention in existing buildings require an in-depth understanding of the existing building, its methods of construction, and any deterioration that exists. This requirement is particularly critical in the practice of preservation architecture, when renovation, adaptive re-use, and/or restoration projects affect structures with physical fabric of intrinsic historic value. Existing guidelines, such as those of HABS, attempt to ensure that recording is performed in a useful manner that meets certain minimum standards; however, these address only visible conditions, those that can be measured and photographed and those where physical reality is fully observable. Advancements in technology have allowed a marked increase in the ability to understand both the layout of concealed elements, such as wood framing configurations, and the existence of deterioration mechanisms invisible to the naked eye. Unfortunately, these advancements have not necessarily corresponded with the development of standards and guidelines for systematically conducting this type of investigation. Based in part on the author’s experience as a preservation architect, this thesis outlines a methodology and approach for documenting concealed fabric and conditions in historic buildings...|$|R
40|$|The goal of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} relations between structural characteristics and quality (Early Childhood Environment Rating Scale; ECERS) of early childhood classroom environments in 100 child care centers licensed by the PA Department of Public Welfare to determine: a) a minimum set of structural characteristics that can be used to predict quality, b) to identify threshold values of structural characteristics that could be used to discriminate between categories of quality, and c) to determine whether the minimal set of structural characteristics also could be used to predict quality in preschools. Teacher and director pre-service education, teacher and director continuing education, teacher and director wages, provision of benefits to staff, and training budget per staff member consistently predicted quality, accounting for between 27. 4 % and 28. 9 % of the variance in ECERS Total Score. Further, this set of structural characteristics accurately predicted 52 % of "Good," "Mediocre," and "Poor" quality sites. Yet, even within this smaller set of eight structural predictors, two structural characteristics (percent of teachers in the center that have an Associate Degree or higher and the number of benefits) and their interaction most strongly accounted for variance in quality across sites and demonstrated a significant interaction effect. When applied to 38 preschools licensed by the PA Department of Education, teacher education and benefits predicted quality but to a lesser extent. The findings have implications for policy and practice as states develop tiered strategies and standards to recognize and reward differing levels of quality in early care and education programs, and it is recommended that these strategies and standards include attention to the educational levels of classroom teachers and the provision of <b>adequate</b> staff benefit <b>packages...</b>|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background The {{present study}} {{assessed}} malaria RDT kits for <b>adequate</b> and correct <b>packaging,</b> design and labelling of boxes and components. Information inserts were studied for readability {{and accuracy of}} information. Methods Criteria for packaging, design, labelling and information were compiled from Directive 98 / 79 of the European Community (EC), relevant World Health Organization (WHO) documents and studies on end-users' performance of RDTs. Typography and readability level (Flesch-Kincaid grade level) were assessed. Results Forty-two RDT kits from 22 manufacturers were assessed, 35 of which had evidence of good manufacturing practice according to available information (i. e. CE-label affixed or inclusion in the WHO list of ISO 13485 : 2003 certified manufacturers). Shortcomings in devices were (i) insufficient place for writing sample identification (n = 40) and (ii) ambiguous labelling of the reading window (n = 6). Buffer vial labels were lacking essential information (n = 24) or were of poor quality (n = 16). Information inserts had elevated readability levels (median Flesch Kincaid grade 8. 9, range 7. 1 - 12. 9) and user-unfriendly typography (median font size 8, range 5 - 10). Inadequacies included (i) no referral to biosafety (n = 18), (ii) critical differences between depicted and real devices (n = 8), (iii) figures with unrealistic colours (n = 4), (iv) incomplete information about RDT line interpretations (n = 31) and no data on test characteristics (n = 8). Other problems included (i) kit names that referred to Plasmodium vivax although targeting a pan-species Plasmodium antigen (n = 4), (ii) not stating {{the identity of the}} pan-species antigen (n = 2) and (iii) slight but numerous differences in names displayed on boxes, device packages and information inserts. Three CE labelled RDT kits produced outside the EC had no authorized representative affixed and the shape and relative dimensions of the CE symbol affixed did not comply with the Directive 98 / 79 /EC. Overall, RDTs with evidence of GMP scored better compared to those without but inadequacies were observed in both groups. Conclusion Overall, malaria RDTs showed shortcomings in quality of construction, design and labelling of boxes, device packages, devices and buffers. Information inserts were difficult to read and lacked relevant information. </p...|$|R
