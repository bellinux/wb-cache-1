5|$|American {{black bears}} have been spotted in the {{chaparral}} region, {{usually in the}} fall. The most common birds include titmice and the <b>acorn</b> <b>woodpecker.</b> blue-gray gnatcatchers, lesser goldfinches, and Anna's hummingbirds have also been seen.|$|E
5|$|Snakes {{such as the}} ringneck snake, western yellow-bellied racer, striped whipsnake, and Pacific gopher snake live in the oak savanna region. Birds such as the oak titmouse, ash-throated flycatcher, white-breasted nuthatch, western bluebird, violet-green swallow, <b>acorn</b> <b>woodpecker,</b> black-headed grosbeak, and American kestrel {{have also}} been found in this region. The rocks {{are known to be}} the northernmost place blue-gray gnatcatchers inhabit. Gall wasps live in this area, often {{creating}} galls in oak trees by injecting their larva into their leaves and branches.|$|E
5|$|The {{ability to}} {{excavate}} allows woodpeckers to obtain tree sap, {{an important source}} of food for some species. Most famously, the sapsuckers (genus Sphyrapicus) feed in this fashion, but the technique is not restricted to these, and others such as the <b>acorn</b> <b>woodpecker</b> and white-headed woodpecker also feed on sap. It was once thought that the technique was restricted to the New World, but Old World species, such as the Arabian woodpecker and great spotted woodpecker, also feed in this way.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Acorn</b> <b>woodpeckers</b> provide {{substantial}} information on breeding systems because they practice monogamy, polyandry, and polygyny. In polyandry {{the presence of}} more male breeders in <b>acorn</b> <b>woodpeckers</b> has shown that females reproduce the optimal clutch size and that with paternity sharing between males it is behaviorally more stable increasing male and female fitness. As opposed to polygyny, {{where it has been}} observed that polygynous females that lay a large number of eggs exceeding the optimal clutch size reduces the fitness of the group. Polygynous trios compared to polyandrous trios showed that having more eggs lowered the group fitness. Chao (1997) studies using <b>acorn</b> <b>woodpeckers</b> suggest that other mating systems are practiced at a lower rate when compared to polyandry because it is polyandry that can maximize the fitness of males and females when obtaining optimal clutch size. In polyandrous mating, optimal clutch size is obtained because there is only one female and it becomes more stable when all members remain together.|$|R
50|$|Over seventy {{species of}} mammals occur in this rich ecoregion. The endemic mammals include three species of {{kangaroo}} rat. Some hundred {{species of birds}} occur here. Indicator species are scrub jays, <b>acorn</b> <b>woodpeckers,</b> and wrentits.|$|R
50|$|<b>Acorn</b> <b>woodpeckers,</b> {{like many}} other species, are {{threatened}} by habitat loss and degradation. Competition for nest cavities by non-native species is an ongoing threat in urbanized areas. Conservation of this species {{is dependent on the}} maintenance of functional ecosystems that provide the full range of resources upon which the species depends. These include mature forests with oaks capable of producing large mast crops and places for the woodpeckers to nest, roost, and store mast. Residents are encouraged to preserve mature oak and pine-oak stands of trees and to provide dead limbs and snags for nesting, roosting, and granary sites to help preserve the <b>acorn</b> <b>woodpecker's</b> population.|$|R
5|$|Group-living species {{tend to be}} {{communal}} group breeders. In {{addition to}} these species, a number of species may join mixed-species foraging flocks with other insectivorous birds, although they tend {{to stay at the}} edges of these groups. Joining these flocks allows woodpeckers to decrease their anti-predator vigilance and increase their feeding rate. Woodpeckers are diurnal, roosting at night inside holes and crevices. In many species the roost will become the nest-site during the breeding season, but in some species they have separate functions; the grey-and-buff woodpecker makes several shallow holes for roosting which are quite distinct from its nesting site. Most birds roost alone and will oust intruders from their chosen site, but the Magellanic woodpecker and <b>acorn</b> <b>woodpecker</b> are cooperative roosters.|$|E
5|$|Members of Picidae are {{typically}} monogamous, {{with a few}} species breeding cooperatively and some polygamy reported in a few species. Polyandry, where a female raises two broods with two separate males, has also {{been reported in the}} West Indian woodpecker. Another unusual social system is that of the <b>acorn</b> <b>woodpecker,</b> which is a polygynandrous cooperative breeder where groups of up to 12 individuals breed and help to raise the young. Young birds from previous years may stay behind to help raise the group's young, and studies have found reproductive success for the group goes up with group size, but individual success goes down. Birds may be forced to remain in groups {{due to a lack of}} habitat to disperse to.|$|E
5|$|Overall, {{woodpeckers}} are arboreal {{birds of}} wooded habitats. They reach their greatest diversity in tropical rainforests, but occur {{in almost all}} suitable habitats including woodlands, savannahs, scrublands, and bamboo forests. Even grasslands and deserts have been colonised by various species. These habitats are more easily occupied where {{a small number of}} trees exist, or, in the case of desert species like the Gila woodpecker, tall cacti are available for nesting. Some are specialists and are associated with coniferous or deciduous woodland or even, like the <b>acorn</b> <b>woodpecker,</b> with individual tree genera (oaks in this case). Other species are generalists and are able to adapt to forest clearance by exploiting secondary growth, plantations, orchards and parks. In general, forest-dwelling species need rotting or dead wood on which to forage.|$|E
50|$|The {{park has}} {{a large number of}} waterfalls, a wide variety of environments (from lush canyon bottoms to sparse chaparral-covered slopes), many animals (deer, raccoons, an {{occasional}} bobcat) and abundant bird life - including Steller's jays, egrets, herons and <b>acorn</b> <b>woodpeckers.</b>|$|R
50|$|In {{cooperative}} simultaneous polyandry, multiple males {{mate with}} a single female and a clutch of mixed eggs (belonging to multiple males) are cared for by the whole group. Species that exhibit this behavior include certain types of <b>Acorn</b> <b>Woodpeckers</b> and Harris Hawks.|$|R
40|$|Landscape {{characteristics}} and social behavior {{can affect the}} foraging patterns of seed-dependent animals. We examine the movement of acorns from valley oak (Quercus lobata) trees to granaries maintained by <b>acorn</b> <b>woodpeckers</b> (Melanerpes formicivorus) in two California oak savanna-woodlands differing {{in the distribution of}} Q. lobata within each site. In 2004, we sampled Q. lobata acorns from 16 granaries at Sedgwick Reserve in Santa Barbara County and 18 granaries at Hastings Reserve in Monterey County. Sedgwick has lower site-wide density of Q. lobata than Hastings as well as different frequencies of other Quercus species common to both sites. We found <b>acorn</b> <b>woodpeckers</b> foraged from fewer Q. lobata seed source trees (Kg =  4. 1  ±  0. 5) at Sedgwick than at Hastings (Kg =  7. 6  ±  0. 6) and from fewer effective seed sources (Nem* =  2. 00 and 5. 78, respectively). The differences between sites are due to a greater number of incidental seed sources used per granary at Hastings than at Sedgwick. We also found very low levels of seed source sharing between adjacent granaries, indicating that territoriality is strong at both sites and that each social group forages on its own subset of trees. We discovered an interesting spatial pattern in the location of granaries. At Sedgwick, <b>acorn</b> <b>woodpeckers</b> situated their granaries within areas of higher-than-average tree density, while at Hastings, they placed them within areas of lower-than-average tree density, with the outcome that granaries at the two sites were located in areas of similar valley oak density. Our results illustrate that landscape characteristics might influence the number of trees visited by <b>acorn</b> <b>woodpeckers</b> and the locations of territories, while woodpecker social behavior, such as territoriality, shapes which trees are visited and whether they are shared with other social groups...|$|R
25|$|Several {{varieties}} of rattlesnakes are indigenous to the region. While only the Pacific Northwest rattler makes its home in Northern California, almost a dozen rattlesnakes make {{their home in}} the deserts of Southern California, including the western diamondback and the Mojave rattlesnake. Birds in the region include the Anna's hummingbird, <b>acorn</b> <b>woodpecker,</b> northern flicker, California towhee, California vulture, red-tailed hawk and many more.|$|E
25|$|The {{state is}} also a host to a large {{population}} of birds which include endemic species and migratory species: greater roadrunner Geococcyx californianus, cactus wren Campylorhynchus brunneicapillus, Mexican jay Aphelocoma ultramarina, Steller's jay Cyanocitta stelleri, <b>acorn</b> <b>woodpecker</b> Melanerpes formicivorus, canyon towhee Pipilo fuscus, mourning dove Zenaida macroura, broad-billed hummingbird Cynanthus latirostris, Montezuma quail Cyrtonyx montezumae, mountain trogon Trogon mexicanus, turkey vulture Cathartes aura, and golden eagle Aquila chrysaetos. Trogon mexicanus is an endemic species found in the mountains in Mexico; it is considered an endangered species and has symbolic significance to Mexicans.|$|E
25|$|Over {{most of the}} range, acorns fall in October. A {{variety of}} mammals and birds eat them, {{including}} the <b>acorn</b> <b>woodpecker,</b> California scrub jay, yellow-billed magpie, and California ground squirrel. The acorns are also attacked by bruchid beetles, but can survive moderate levels of infestation. Surviving acorns all germinate in their first winter, and none remain by mid-winter. The acorns are medium to dark brown and range from two to three centimeters (0.8-1.2 inches) in length. The caps have deep stippling and are found most often as singlets, but occasionally as doublets. The Concow tribe call the acorns lō-ē’ (Konkow language).|$|E
50|$|There {{are only}} two species in which kin {{selection}} {{has resulted in a}} shared food store, i.e. beavers (Castor canadensis) and <b>acorn</b> <b>woodpeckers</b> (Melanerpes formicivorous); the former live in family groups and construct winter larders of submerged branches, while the latter are unusual in that they construct a conspicuous communal larder.|$|R
40|$|General: White oak is a {{dominant}} species of valley oak savanna and low elevation riparian forests in California, providing a critical habitat for many {{animal and plant}} species, stabilizing soils in flood plains, and contributing an aesthetic value to the natural landscape. Wildlife: California white oak acorns are an important food source for deer, California ground squirrels, band-tailed pigeons, and <b>acorn</b> <b>woodpeckers.</b> Ethnobotanic: Native Americans used acorns as a food staple...|$|R
50|$|An avian example {{published}} in Nature is <b>acorn</b> <b>woodpeckers.</b> Females nest together, possibly because those nesting alone have their eggs constantly destroyed by rivals. Even so, eggs are consistently removed at first by nest partners themselves, until {{the entire group}} lays on the same day. They then cooperate and incubate the eggs as a group, but by this time {{a significant proportion of}} their eggs have been lost because of this ovicidal behavior.|$|R
25|$|The verdant forests on eastern {{exposures}} are fed by {{the year}} round Graham Creek and its tributaries. The most common eastern slope plant community is the oak woodland, which has a canopy of coast live oak, Garry oak, black oak, Pacific madrone, bigleaf maple and California laurel. In some of the steeper, cooler riparian zones there are also small groves of coast redwood, Sequoia sempervirens. In these oak woodlands, the dominant understory plants are toyon, blackberry, western poison-oak and in occasional drier patches some coyote brush. Common animals observed include California mule deer, gray squirrel, raccoon, skunk and opossum. Less frequently bobcat and mountain lion are seen. There is abundant birdlife including the scrub jay, Steller's jay, <b>acorn</b> <b>woodpecker</b> and junco. Because of the rich soils and mild climate, there are significant sized vineyards at elevations up to 1,700 feet (518m) on the northeast flanks of the mountain, positioned like mosaics in a patchwork of mostly oak forest; these grapes contribute to some premium varietal wines, {{some of which are}} marketed as premium Sonoma Valley appellations.|$|E

25|$|Birds such as flickers, <b>acorn</b> <b>woodpeckers,</b> Mexican jays, and flycatchers {{are typical}} predators of M. flavitarsis. In {{addition}} to birds, ants will often try {{to invade the}} wasp nests. The wasps fight back by attempting to drive and throw the ants off the nest. They will also rub their abdomen on nest surfaces to deter ants from approaching. One final predator of M. flavitarsis is the praying mantis, which will eat perching males during mating season.|$|R
50|$|<b>Acorn</b> <b>woodpeckers</b> (Melanerpes formicivorus) {{are known}} to form {{communal}} roosts during the winter months. In these roosts two to three individuals will share a cavity during the winter. Within these tree cavities woodpeckers share their body heat {{with each other and}} therefore decrease the thermoregulatory demands on the individuals within the roost. Small scale communal roosting during the winter months has also been observed in Green Woodhoopoes (Phoeniculus purpureus). Winter communal roosts in these species typically contain around five individuals.|$|R

50|$|The {{environment}} can also introduce beneficial traits {{to a small}} population that promote its persistence. In the small, fragmented populations of the <b>acorn</b> <b>woodpecker,</b> minimal immigration is sufficient for population persistence. Despite the potential genetic consequences of having a small population size, the <b>acorn</b> <b>woodpecker</b> is able to avoid extinction and the classification as an endangered species because of this environmental intervention causing neighboring populations to immigrate.  Immigration promotes survival by increasing genetic diversity, which {{will be discussed in}} the next section as a harmful factor in small populations.|$|E
50|$|American {{black bears}} have been spotted in the {{chaparral}} region, {{usually in the}} fall. The most common birds include titmice and the <b>acorn</b> <b>woodpecker.</b> blue-gray gnatcatchers, lesser goldfinches, and Anna's hummingbirds have also been seen.|$|E
5000|$|As mentioned, adult <b>acorn</b> <b>woodpeckers</b> live {{together}} in [...] "coalitions", which consist of up to seven co-breeding males and up to three joint-nesting females; however, most nests {{are made up of}} only three males and two females. Nesting groups can also contain up to ten offspring helpers. Interestingly, these breeding coalitions are typically closely related. The males are often brothers, and the females are usually sisters. Inbreeding is rare, however, meaning that co-breeders of the opposite sex are almost never related.|$|R
5000|$|Sunset Trail - Sunset Trail is a 4.6 mile loop trail {{accessible}} from Meadows Trailhead off Sunrise Highway, mile marker 19.1. The trail, {{which offers}} several connection options, winds through pine forest leading one to open meadows, ponds and small lakes, and a popular lookout to the Pacific Ocean. The surrounding habitat supports numerous {{flora and fauna}} including native black oaks, Engelmann oaks, giant Jeffrey pines, <b>Acorn</b> <b>Woodpeckers</b> (Melanerpes formicivorus), hawks and turkey vultures. Dogs are not allowed off leash.|$|R
50|$|Bird life is {{abundant}} throughout the park. Steller's jays and <b>acorn</b> <b>woodpeckers</b> are both seen and heard, and the dark-eyed junco is widespread. Less obvious are the brown creeper, Anna's hummingbird, northern flicker, olive-sided flycatcher and sharp-shinned hawk. The first marbled murrelet nest ever sighted {{was located in}} Big Basin {{not far from the}} park headquarters. These robin-sized seabirds nest high in the oldest coast Douglas-firs and redwoods to feed their young. They can be seen or heard at dawn and dusk, high above the forest canopy.|$|R

50|$|Acorn {{woodpeckers}} practice cooperative breeding, {{which is}} a relatively rare evolutionary trait that is thought to occur in only nine percent of bird species. Cooperative breeding is defined as more than two birds taking care of nestlings in the nest. With the <b>acorn</b> <b>woodpecker,</b> cooperative breeding occurs in two ways: coalitions and family groups. Coalitions of adult acorn woodpeckers nest together, localizing to storage granaries. Additionally, adult offspring often stay in their parents' nest and help raise {{the next generation of}} woodpeckers. It is generally believed that limited territories drive cooperative breeding behavior in birds, {{and in the case of}} the <b>acorn</b> <b>woodpecker,</b> this limited territory is the acorn storage granary.|$|E
50|$|In {{the extreme}} {{downstream}} reaches rufous-crowned sparrow, California thrasher and American kestrel {{can be observed}} on chaparral slopes. In the oak woodlands along the creek, <b>acorn</b> <b>woodpecker,</b> California quail, Anna's hummingbird, scrub jay, oak titmouse, bushtit, Bewick's wren, and spotted towhee can be found.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Acorn</b> <b>{{woodpeckers}},</b> {{as their}} name implies, depend heavily on acorns for food. In {{some parts of}} their range (e.g., California), the woodpeckers create granaries or [...] "acorn trees" [...] by drilling holes in dead trees, dead branches, telephone poles, and wooden buildings. The <b>woodpeckers</b> then collect <b>acorns</b> and find a hole {{that is just the}} right size for the acorn. As acorns dry out, they are moved to smaller holes and granary maintenance requires a significant amount of the bird's time. They also feed on insects, sap, and fruit.|$|R
5000|$|In bi-parental care, {{the male}} {{provides}} {{food and the}} female is a caretaker. Both ensure {{the survival of the}} offspring. The female may care for her young by covering them to keep them warm, shielding them from the sun or from rain and guarding them from predation. The male may also feed the female, who in turn regurgitates the food to the chicks. In female red-eyed vireos the roles are reversed. Nonbreeding adults or juveniles in <b>acorn</b> <b>woodpeckers</b> contribute the care through collaboration with the parents. (Paul R. Ehrlich, David S. Dobkin, and Darryl Wheye) ...|$|R
30|$|Black {{oak trees}} and {{seedlings}} can resprout vigorously from dormant buds in their root crown after being top-killed by fire (McDonald and Tappeiner 2002). Although sprouting {{is the primary}} mode of reproduction for black oak, seed regeneration allows black oak to migrate and adapt to changes in conditions through sexual reproduction (McDonald 1990). Black oak migration is facilitated by animals such as western grey squirrels (Sciurus griseus Ord), California scrub jays (Aphelocoma californica Vigors), and <b>acorn</b> <b>woodpeckers</b> (Melanerpes formicivorus Swainson), which can move black oak acorns farther from their parent tree than can wind dispersal (McDonald 1990, Koenig et al. 2008).|$|R
