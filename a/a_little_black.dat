25|$|The {{following}} rhyme {{tells of}} Peter Rabbit's sister, Cotton-tail, and her implied courtship by <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>black</b> rabbit who leaves {{a gift of}} carrots at her door. In The Tale of Mr. Tod, Cotton-tail is married to the black rabbit. Like the first rhyme, the little black rabbit rhyme is of three stanzas accompanied by three illustrations.|$|E
25|$|The Pequod next gams {{with the}} Jungfrau from Bremen. Both ships sight whales simultaneously, with the Pequod winning the contest. The three harpooneers dart their harpoons, and Flask {{delivers}} the mortal strike with a lance. The carcass sinks, and Queequeg barely manages to escape. The Pequods next gam {{is with the}} French whaler Bouton de Rose, whose crew is ignorant of the ambergris in the gut of the diseased whale in their possession. Stubb talks them out of it, but Ahab orders him away. Days later, an encounter with a harpooned whale prompts Pip, <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>black</b> cabin-boy from Alabama, {{to jump out of}} his whale boat. The whale must be cut loose, because the line has Pip so entangled in it. Furious, Stubb orders Pip to stay in the whale boat, but Pip later jumps again, and is left alone in the immense sea and has gone insane by the time he is picked up.|$|E

Nerima serves as a backdrop for more martial arts mayhem with the introduction of Ranma's regular rivals, such as the eternally lost Ryoga Hibiki who traveled halfway across Japan getting from the front of his house to the back, where Ranma spent three days waiting for him. Ryoga, seeking revenge on Ranma, followed him to Jusenkyo where he ultimately falls into the Spring of Drown Piglet. Now when splashed with cold water he takes the form of <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>black</b> pig. Not knowing this, Akane takes the piglet as a pet and names it P-chan, but Ranma knows and hates him for keeping this secret and taking advantage of the situation. Another rival is the nearsighted Mousse, who also falls into a cursed spring and becomes a duck when he gets wet, and finally, there is Ranma's impish grandmaster, Happosai, who spends his time stealing the underwear of schoolgirls.|$|E
500|$|The {{lyrics of}} [...] "Tim McGraw" [...] regard a summer romance {{that came to}} a sudden halt. The song fondly reminisces an ex-boyfriend, and directs the lyrics towards him, rather than country singer Tim McGraw himself. It uses McGraw's music as a marker in their {{relationship}} timeline: [...] "When you think Tim McGraw / I hope you think my favorite song." [...] Sean Dooley of About.com stated, [...] "Music {{has the power to}} evoke memories, and it's an old Tim McGraw song that triggers her happy memories." [...] McGraw's reference is one of the several items used for association of the failed relationship, along with other items and places, such as <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>black</b> dress.|$|E

I pleaded with him to let me throw over him a large waterproof wrap which had often served him in sickness during the summer season for a dressing gown and which I hoped might so cover his person that in the grey of the morning {{he would not be}} recognized. As he strode off I threw over his head <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>black</b> shawl which was around my own shoulders, saying that he could not find his hat and after he started sent my colored woman after him with a bucket for water hoping that he would pass unobserved." ...|$|E

500|$|Chang called Dylan's father [...] "a stiff Asian stereotype", while Mohan of The Oregonian {{found it}} {{contradictory}} for an anti-racist film to contain such depiction. Peter Bradshaw of The Guardian even {{claimed that the}} line [...] "If you can barely beat <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>black</b> girl" [...] (spoken by Dylan's father) signifies that Atchison [...] "thinks it's all right to bring in racism by making the Asians the racists." [...] Metro Silicon Valleys Richard von Busack commented that [...] "tepping around black stereotypes, the film squishes its two left feet right in the mire of Asian stereotyping." [...] Beth Accomando of KPBS also criticized Dylan and his father's portrayal as [...] "painful cliches", while Schager of Slant Magazine found it not authentic, even likening Dylan's father to Mao Zedong.|$|E
500|$|On November 24, 2009, Rihanna {{appeared}} on Good Morning America, where she performed [...] "Wait Your Turn" [...] and [...] "Russian Roulette" [...] from Rated R {{as well as}} [...] "Umbrella" [...] from Good Girl Gone Bad (2007). The set featured Rihanna wearing [...] "a white sequined blazer with <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>black</b> shirt underneath and stilettos", and was joined on stage {{by a group of}} dancers, who were all dressed in black. Rihanna also gave a short interview about the album and the level of energy which was put into it, saying [...] "It came very natural only because it was my place of peace, being the studio just venting. It was the one place I didn't feel judged or criticized. Every emotion went into that album." [...] The song was also included on the set list of the Last Girl on Earth Tour (2010–11) in the encore section, as part of a medley with [...] "Live Your Life" [...] and [...] "Run This Town", before performing [...] "Umbrella" [...] as the final song. On June 24, 2012, Rihanna performed at the BBC Radio 1's Hackney Weekend. She performed [...] "Wait Your Turn" [...] as part of a set list which also included songs from her fifth and sixth sequel studio albums. The performance featured giant sphinx on the stage.|$|E
500|$|After {{attending}} USC School of Cinematic Arts {{and working}} at a youth center in South Los Angeles, Atchison incorporated his experiences from the neighborhood into the film; among them, he heard that children who {{do well in school}} are said to be [...] "acting white". As a result, Atchison tried to use the film to show what causes these children to doubt their own abilities. This doubts are shown through the preconceptions Akeelah and other community members have that [...] "Spelling Bee is for someone else". She [...] "must first overcome her feelings of inadequacy," [...] and when she discovers Larabee comes from her neighborhood and is a successful man, it [...] "empowers her to ... accomplish this task." [...] Fishburne stated the film's treatment of race extends beyond the dichotomy of struggle and success, and goes into the prejudice that many people hold against black people competing in mainstream society. Atchison elaborated, [...] "it's about this girl's insecurity about doing a thing that she hasn't seen people who look like her doing". The director affirmed that African American children in film usually aspire to nothing other than being successful in sports, music or dance. He argued that the film industry has disseminated [...] "lies about black inferiority", so he was interested in focusing in their intellect rather than let them succumb to the stereotypes. Atchison noted he had created the project for all publics [...] "but particularly for kids of color to see <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>black</b> girl who does something powerful." ...|$|E

2500|$|Isabella {{was also}} an extreme example of the Renaissance European {{tendency}} to treat black African slaves in her household as exotic accessories. Isabella's fascination with black child servants is extensively documented. On 1 May 1491 Isabella asked Giorgio Brognolo, her agent in Venice, to procure a young black girl ('una moreta') {{between the ages of}} one-and-a-half and four, and twice in early June reminded him of the request, emphasizing that the girl should be 'as black as possible'. Isabella’s household and financial records reflect she already had a significantly older black girl in her service when she inquired after a younger black child. Records also reflect that she obtained <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>black</b> girl from a Venetian orphanage, opened negotiations with a Venetian patrician household for the sale of <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>black</b> boy and purchased an enslaved little black girl from her sister. The commission for the purchase of a little girl [...] "as black as possible" [...] could be construed as a wish for maximum exoticism.|$|E

2500|$|As {{a player}} with Cambridge United, Moyes {{received}} abuse from team-mate Roy McDonough for his religious beliefs; Moyes is a practising Christian.

[...] Following a 3–3 draw with Wigan Athletic on 9 March 1985, McDonough, who was 26 years old at the time, states that he [...] "battered" [...] 20-year-old Moyes for not putting sufficient effort into the game.|$|E
2500|$|Trademark for Conguitos, a {{confection}} {{manufactured by}} the LACASA Group features a tubby, little brown character with full, red lips.

In France, the chocolate powder Banania still uses <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>black</b> boy with large red lips as its emblem. The licorice brand Tabu, owned by Perfetti Van Melle and distributed in Europe, introduced a cartoon minstrel mascot in the 1980s inspired by Al Jolson's blackface performance in The Jazz Singer, which is still in use today.|$|E

On the later date he claimed a third DFW but was denied official recognition for lack of witnesses. Mannock went to view his third victory which had fallen in friendly lines. The observer had survived but the pilot was dead. He forced himself to search the wreck and discovered the remains.

2500|$|Only 11 of the 26 {{original}} {{crew members}} completed the voyage. The others either deserted or were regularly discharged.

The second mate on the Acushnet was John Hall, English-born but a naturalized American. He is identified as Stubb in an annotation in the book's copy of crew member Henry Hubbard, who, like Melville, had joined the voyage as a green hand. Hubbard also identified the model for Pip: John Backus, <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>black</b> man added to the crew during the voyage.

2500|$|Blampied’s {{earliest}} etchings are dated December 1909, {{suggesting that}} he did not begin to learn this technique until the academic year 1909–1910; his teacher at Bolt Court was Walter Seymour. Blampied’s prints were first shown at an exhibition of students’ work in March 1914, where his etching of an ox cart was noted by the correspondent of The Times. [...] The first print believed to have been published was an etching entitled At the wings (illustration removed) which was reproduced in the Annual Report of Bolt Court in 1914. Blampied later recorded his method of working on zinc for etching and copper for drypoint in Ernest Stephen Lumsden's treatise The Art of Etching. Blampied wrote: [...] "I generally chose from amongst my various drawings one which would tend to produce a successful plate. I do not trace on to the copper, but copy a few important lines on to the bare metal with litho-chalk. I then sketch over this with an ordinary sewing needle and rub in <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>black</b> oil-colour[...] [...] From the first my efforts are to improve on the sketch until I consider the plate finished[...] [...] In very few cases do I touch a plate after the first proof, so the majority have but one state. If I am dissatisfied with either the composition or details, I prefer to start afresh upon another plate rather than make radical alterations." ...|$|E

It was very cold, for dawn was coming, and they shivered <b>a</b> <b>little</b> as they looked about them. There was nothing to excite apprehension, only a jaded horse that stood just within the {{uncertain}} light with loose bridle and lowered head, but Ingleby felt a curious uneasiness come upon him. The sight was unpleasantly suggestive.|$|R
