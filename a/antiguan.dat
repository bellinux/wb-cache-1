50|$|In {{the first}} section of A Small Place, Kincaid employs the {{perspective}} of the tourist in order to demonstrate the inherent escapism in creating a distance from the realities of a visited place.

Dolby corroborates Kincaid‚Äôs depiction of the tourist creating separation by ‚Äúothering‚Äù the locale and the individuals that inhabit it.
