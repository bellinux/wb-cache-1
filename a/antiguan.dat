25|$|Antigua and Barbuda put up 164/9 (a {{recovery}} from 77/7) in a 41-over match against India, but the rain fell again with India 30/2 in reply and the match was declared a no-result.

50|$|In {{the first}} section of A Small Place, Kincaid employs the {{perspective}} of the tourist in order to demonstrate the inherent escapism in creating a distance from the realities of a visited place. Nadine Dolby dissects the theme of tourism in A Small Place and places Kincaid’s depiction of tourism in a globalized context that justifies Kincaid’s strong feelings toward it. Dolby corroborates Kincaid’s depiction of the tourist creating separation by “othering” the locale and the individuals that inhabit it. Furthermore, the tourist industry is linked to a global economic system that ultimately does not translate into benefits for the very <b>Antiguans</b> who enable it.|$|R

50|$|The WIR was {{intended}} (like other regional institutions) {{to promote a}} sense of common pride and shared heritage and would be recruited from the various islands and serve throughout the region.

The recruiting for the Regiment, which was the main fighting component of the Federal Defence Force, had been carried out on a federal basis with men from all the islands being recruited on a percentage basis related to the population of each territory. By September 1961, some 200 Trinidadians were serving in the Regiment. A total of 14 <b>Antiguans</b> and 12 Kittitians served, though none emerged as officers.|$|R
