40|$|Trade-offs between {{competitive}} {{priorities are}} {{often seen as}} exogenous – managers accept them as a given downside while simultaneously addressing multiple competitive priorities. However, some companies seem to face fewer trade-offs than others. The question is how companies reduce their trade-offs to successfully compete on multiple competitive priorities simultaneously. We address this question by theorising that bundles of <b>action</b> <b>programmes</b> are needed to reduce trade-offs between competitive priorities. We examine four Swiss manufacturing plants and show how the selection of <b>action</b> <b>programmes</b> influences the simultaneous competition on multiple competitive priorities. We show that successful competition on multiple competitive priorities does not happen by accident but is achieved by aligning competitive priorities, <b>action</b> <b>programmes,</b> infrastructural/structural changes and contextual factors...|$|R

40|$|Thesis (MTech (Human Resource Management)) [...] Cape Technikon, 1996. Labour {{relations}} in South Africa is directly influenced by {{affirmative action in}} the work place, creating potential labour relations opportunities and threats within organisations. An investigation was done to ascertain the influence of affirmative action on labour relations. A comparative study of employer and trade union perceptions indicated a marked consensus between the two parties. The differences between the parties can be addressed by collective bargaining. A theoretical framework was developed, which demonstrated that worker participation and joint decision-making on affirmative <b>action</b> <b>programmes</b> {{should be regarded as}} essential for the success of these programmes. Shortcomings in current affirmative <b>action</b> <b>programmes</b> emanate from unilateral decision-making by management. A lack of legitimacy in affirmative <b>action</b> <b>programmes</b> results from non-consultation with trade unions. This has a detrimental effect on the credibility of affirmative <b>action</b> <b>programmes</b> and as a result no real employee development occurs. The labour relations climate is thus impaired. The research methodology included interviews (conducted with a number of academics, human resource managers and trade unionists) and postal questionnaires, which were completed by 231 managers (human resource and line managers) in both private and public organisations in the Western Cape...|$|R
40|$|Much {{literature}} exists about {{best practices}} {{and there are}} many contributions on how to achieve high operational performance. However, {{there is a lack of}} theory on the relationships between practices and performance(s). Furthermore, the implementation process of <b>action</b> <b>programmes</b> and especially the effects that process may have on the success of the <b>action</b> <b>programmes</b> is often not considered. This paper focuses on the latter and reports the results of an exploratory case study of a plant, which is part of a large high performance manufacturing company in Denmark. The plant is in the process of implementing a range of <b>action</b> <b>programmes,</b> including TPM, 6 sigma, SMED and CFM to support its ambition to become lean. While these programmes clearly reinforce each other, the plant experiences negative performance effects. In the paper, we propose a range of factors explaining this. We conclude the paper with directions for further research...|$|R

25|$|Initially, EU {{environmental}} policy focused on Europe. More recently, the EU has demonstrated leadership in global environmental governance, e.g. {{the role of}} the EU in securing the ratification and coming into force of the Kyoto Protocol despite opposition from the United States.

The Lisbon Treaty further strengthened the leadership ambitions. EU law has {{played a significant role in}} improving habitat and species protection in Europe, as well as contributing to improvements in air and water quality and waste management.|$|E

The mechanisms by which these principles would be applied were created, and the manner clarified, by the 1995 Millbrook Commonwealth <b>Action</b> <b>Programme,</b> which created the Commonwealth Ministerial Action Group (CMAG), which has the power to rule on whether members meet the requirements for membership under the Harare Declaration. Also in 1995, an Inter-Governmental Group was created to finalise and codify the full requirements for membership. Upon reporting in 1997, as adopted under the Edinburgh Declaration, the Inter-Governmental Group ruled that any future members would have to have a direct constitutional link with an existing member.|$|E

25|$|Fiscal {{efficiency}} is separate from economic efficiency. Economic analysis of recycling {{does not include}} what economists call externalities, which are unpriced costs and benefits that accrue to individuals outside of private transactions. Examples include: decreased air pollution and greenhouse gases from incineration, reduced hazardous waste leaching from landfills, reduced energy consumption, and reduced waste and resource consumption, {{which leads to a}} reduction in environmentally damaging mining and timber activity. About 4,000 minerals are known, of these only a few hundred minerals in the world are relatively common. Known reserves of phosphorus will be exhausted within the next 100 years at current rates of usage. Without mechanisms such as taxes or subsidies to internalize externalities, businesses may ignore them despite the costs imposed on society. To make such nonfiscal benefits economically relevant, advocates have pushed for legislative action to increase the demand for recycled materials. The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has concluded in favor of recycling, saying that recycling efforts reduced the country's carbon emissions by a net 49 million metric tonnes in 2005. In the United Kingdom, the Waste and Resources <b>Action</b> <b>Programme</b> stated that Great Britain's recycling efforts reduce CO2 emissions by 10–15 million tonnes a year. Recycling is more efficient in densely populated areas, as there are economies of scale involved.|$|E
500|$|At a 23 March {{meeting in}} Dresden in East Germany, {{leaders of the}} [...] "Warsaw Five" [...] (USSR, Hungary, Poland, Bulgaria and East Germany) {{questioned}} a Czechoslovak delegation over the planned reforms, suggesting any talk of [...] "democratization" [...] was a veiled critique of other policies. Władysław Gomułka and János Kádár were less concerned with the reforms themselves than with the growing criticisms levelled by the Czechoslovak media, and worried the situation might be [...] "similar to the prologue of the Hungarian counterrevolution". Some of the language in April's KSČ <b>Action</b> <b>Programme</b> may have been chosen to assert that no counter-revolution was planned, but Kieran Williams suggests that Dubček was perhaps surprised at, but not resentful of, Soviet suggestions.|$|E

Party conservatives urged repressive measures, but Dubček counselled moderation and re-emphasized KSČ leadership. At the Presidium of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia in April, Dubček announced a political programme of [...] "socialism with a human face".

500|$|By {{the late}} 1990s, things had worsened, {{and the food}} {{manufacturing}} sector {{was estimated to be}} generating over 8 million tonnes of food waste annually. A documentary in 1998 revealed tonnes of edible food being discarded at a Tesco store, provoking a renewed response on the issue of food waste. In 2000, the government created the Waste & Resources <b>Action</b> <b>Programme</b> (WRAP), a government-funded, not-for-profit company that advises on how to reduce waste and use resources efficiently. In 2007, WRAP launched the [...] "Love Food, Hate Waste" [...] campaign and returned food waste to the forefront of the news and public agenda.

500|$|Those who {{drafted the}} <b>Action</b> <b>Programme</b> were {{careful not to}} criticize {{the actions of the}} post-war Communist regime, only to point out {{policies}} that they felt had outlived their usefulness.

[...] Since the [...] "antagonistic classes" [...] were said to have been defeated with the achievement of socialism, these methods were no longer necessary. Reform was needed, for the Czechoslovak economy to join the [...] "scientific-technical revolution in the world" [...] rather than relying on Stalinist-era heavy industry, labour power, and raw materials. Furthermore, since internal class conflict had been overcome, workers could now be duly rewarded for their qualifications and technical skills without contravening Marxism-Leninism. The Programme suggested it was now necessary to ensure important positions were [...] "filled by capable, educated socialist expert cadres" [...] in order to compete with capitalism.|$|E
