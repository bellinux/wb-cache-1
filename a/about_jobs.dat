500|$|... "The Revenge" [...] {{was first}} {{read by the}} cast of the show on February 13, 1991 and was filmed {{in front of a}} live {{audience}} on February 20, 1991. Filming of the episode had been delayed two days due to President's Day. Both Alexander and Louis-Dreyfus praised the scene in which Jerry and George discuss the types of employment George could apply for after he quit his job. Louis-Dreyfus stated she was jealous that she was not in the scene. A number of scenes in the episode were removed prior to broadcast, such as one in which George and Kramer meet in the hallway and Kramer informs George that Jerry has gone to the laundromat. The writers decided that George could just say Kramer told him Jerry was at the laundromat and, upon that addition, the scene was cut. Initially, during Jerry and George's conversation <b>about</b> <b>jobs,</b> George mentions Regis Philbin, when they discuss George being a talk show host. Additional dialogue between George and Jerry at the laundromat was also removed. Because the episode [...] "The Stranded" [...] did not air until mid season three, the few references [...] "The Revenge" [...] contained to the episode, were cut. The Newman subplot was significantly reduced; the character initially appeared in one scene, but it was never filmed. In that scene, he would have explained to Jerry and Kramer that he jumped from the roof, but an awning broke his fall, though Jerry and Kramer would remain skeptical. The episode also involved the second appearance of Harold the building superintendent, who had previously appeared in [...] "The Apartment". Harold would inform the main characters that Newman made up the story about the awning breaking his fall, though, with the reduction of the Newman subplot, the scene was removed.|$|E

To what extent do students, non-managers, and managers benefit from job offers when they are member of SNSs like Facebook or LinkedIn? How can differences in receiving information <b>about</b> <b>job</b> openings be explained by the strength-of-weak-ties and structural holes theorems? The results of an online survey among 386 respondents indicate that users of SNSs with more contacts are more likely to receive information <b>about</b> <b>job</b> openings than others. Most information <b>about</b> <b>job</b> openings was transmitted via LinkedIn to professionals. Regression analyses indicate that LinkedIn professionals with more links are more likely to information <b>about</b> a <b>job</b> opening. In contrast, the structural holes theory is not supported in our setting. Higher education should actively encourage and train students to use LinkedIn to enhance their employability. Furthermore, organisations should consider that new generation graduates use technology for different tasks and with different people than professionals...|$|R
