5|$|Borobudur is {{constructed}} {{in such a}} way that it reveals various levels of terraces, showing intricate architecture that goes from being heavily ornamented with bas-reliefs to being plain in Arupadhatu circular terraces. The first four terrace walls are showcases for bas-relief sculptures. These are exquisite, considered to be the most elegant <b>and</b> <b>graceful</b> in the ancient Buddhist world.|$|E

5|$|In India, {{the sword}} dance Choliya or Saraon of the Kumaon {{region of the}} hills of the Indian state of Uttarakhand started partly due to their long martial {{tradition}} and also to give protection to marriage processions. It was also held auspicious and, according to Hindu tradition, warded off evil spirits. It has a very beautiful <b>and</b> <b>graceful</b> form and has techniques which give it {{the status of a}} martial art.|$|E
5|$|Rai school sugata {{resembles that}} of the late Heian/early Kamakura period being both gentle <b>and</b> <b>graceful,</b> but grander and with a more {{vigorous}} workmanship. Starting with Kunimitsu, the kissaki becomes larger. The jihada is small-grain mokume-hada, dense with ji-nie, yubashiri and chikei. The quality of the jigane is slightly inferior {{to that of the}} Awataguchi school. The hamon shows medium suguha with chōji midare.|$|E
5|$|The Canadian horse has {{a rather}} short, high-set {{head with a}} broad forehead. The neck is arched <b>and</b> <b>graceful,</b> and the chest, back and loins broad and {{strongly}} muscled. The shoulders and croup are sloping, with a relatively high-set tail. Overall, the breed gives the impression of strength and agility. Their heavy and wavy mane and tail, arched necks and finely boned heads are all reminiscent of Andalusian and Barb ancestry. Their trot is described as flashy. They are hardy horses and easy keepers. Today, most Canadian horses are used as riding and driving horses, and {{are known for their}} jumping ability. They are seen in competition in almost every discipline, as well as for leisure riding. They can also be found in light draft work, trail riding, and working as a stock horse.|$|E

5|$|Due to the {{cancellation}} of Sonic X-treme, the Saturn lacks an exclusive Sonic the Hedgehog platformer, containing only a graphically enhanced port of the Genesis title Sonic 3D Blast, the compilation Sonic Jam, and a racing game called Sonic R. The platformer Bug! received attention for its eponymous main character being a potential mascot for the Saturn, but it failed to catch on as the Sonic series had. Considered {{one of the most}} important Saturn releases, Sonic Team developed Nights into Dreams, a score attack game that attempted to simulate both the joy of flying and the fleeting sensation of dreams. The gameplay of Nights involves steering the imp-like androgynous protagonist, Nights, as it flies on a mostly 2D plane across surreal stages broken into four segments each. The levels repeat for as long as an in-game time limit allows, while flying over or looping around various objects in rapid succession earns additional points. Although it lacked the fully 3D environments of Nintendo's Super Mario 64, Nights emphasis on unfettered movement <b>and</b> <b>graceful</b> acrobatic techniques showcased the intuitive potential of analog control. Sonic Team's Burning Rangers, a fully 3D action-adventure game involving a team of outer-space firefighters, garnered praise for its transparency effects and distinctive art direction, but was released in limited quantities late in the Saturn's lifespan and criticized for its short length.|$|E

25|$|In {{general the}} wines from Volnay are lighter, more elegant <b>and</b> <b>graceful</b> {{than most other}} red Burgundies from the Cote d'Or. 80,000 cases of red wine come from its 242ha of vineyards, of which 115ha is split among 26 Premier Crus.

25|$|One of the Palace {{sites is}} marked by the {{artificial}} lake of Anapji with stone works of retaining walls delineating the former building location.

Tiles from many ruins of the buildings were found everywhere. Of those that are still intact, show elegant <b>and</b> <b>graceful</b> design.|$|E
25|$|The {{earliest}} dated {{specimen of}} Old East Slavic (or, rather, of Church Slavonic with pronounced East Slavic interference) {{must be considered}} the written Slovo o zakone i blagodati, by Hilarion, metropolitan of Kiev. In this work there is a panegyric on Prince Vladimir of Kiev, the hero of so much of East Slavic popular poetry. This subtle <b>and</b> <b>graceful</b> oration admirably conforms to the precepts of the Byzantine eloquence. It is rivalled by another panegyric on Vladimir, written a decade later by Yakov the Monk.|$|E

25|$|The art of {{the period}} from François I through Henri IV often is heavily {{inspired}} by late Italian pictorial and sculptural developments {{commonly referred to as}} Mannerism, which is associated with Michelangelo and Parmigianino, among others. It is characterized by figures which are elongated <b>and</b> <b>graceful</b> that rely upon visual rhetoric, including the elaborate use of allegory and mythology. Perhaps the greatest accomplishment of the French Renaissance was the construction of the Châteaux of the Loire Valley. No longer conceived of as fortresses, such pleasure palaces took advantage of the richness of the rivers and lands of the Loire region and they show remarkable architectural skill.|$|E
25|$|The stretch above Jesus Lock is {{sometimes}} {{known as the}} middle river (with the section above the Mill Pond being {{referred to as the}} upper river). Between Jesus Lock and the Mill Pond, it passes through the Backs below the walls of many of the colleges. This is the section of river most popular with tourists, with its picture-postcard views of elegant bridges, green lawns <b>and</b> <b>graceful</b> willows. This stretch also has the unusual feature of the remains of a submerged towpath: the riverside colleges did not permit barge horses on the Backs, so the beasts waded up the Cam to the mill pulling their loads behind them.|$|E
25|$|In {{one early}} account, the Isneg were {{described}} as of slender <b>and</b> <b>graceful</b> stature, with manners that were kindly, hospitable, and generous, possessed {{with the spirit of}} self-reliance and courage, and clearly artistic in their temperament. The Isnag’s ancestors are believed to have been the proto-Austronesians who came from South China thousands of years ago. Later, they came in contact with groups practicing jar burial, from whom they adopted the custom. They later also came into contact with Chinese traders plying the seas south of the Asian mainland. From the Chinese they bought the porcelain pieces and glass beads which now form part of the Isnag’s priceless heirlooms. The Isnag have been known to be a head-taking society since recorded history.|$|E
