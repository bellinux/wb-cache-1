5|$|Diagnosis {{is based}} on a person's {{symptoms}} and history of medication use. Other conditions that can produce similar symptoms such as neuroleptic malignant syndrome, malignant hyperthermia, <b>anticholinergic</b> toxicity, heat stroke, and meningitis should be ruled out.

5|$|Those {{taking more}} than 4mg per day have an {{increased}} potential for dependence. This medication may cause withdrawal symptoms upon abrupt withdrawal or rapid tapering, which in some cases {{have been known to}} cause seizures, as well as marked delirium similar to that produced by the <b>anticholinergic</b> tropane alkaloids of Datura (scopolamine and atropine). The discontinuation of this medication may also cause a reaction called rebound anxiety.|$|E
5|$|In {{cases of}} serious {{poisoning}} the mushroom causes delirium, somewhat similar in effect to <b>anticholinergic</b> poisoning (such as that caused by Datura stramonium), characterised by bouts of marked agitation with confusion, hallucinations, and irritability followed by periods of {{central nervous system}} depression. Seizures and coma may also occur in severe poisonings. Symptoms typically appear after around 30 to 90 minutes and peak within three hours, but certain effects can last for several days. In {{the majority of cases}} recovery is complete within 12 to 24hours. The effect is highly variable between individuals, with similar doses potentially causing quite different reactions. Some people suffering intoxication have exhibited headaches up to ten hours afterwards. Retrograde amnesia and somnolence can result following recovery.|$|E

25|$|New {{research}} has also revealed compelling evidence of a link between long-term use of <b>anticholinergic</b> medications like TCAs and dementia. Although many studies have investigated this link, {{this was the first}} study to use a long-term approach (over seven years) to find that dementias associated with anticholinergics may not be reversible even years after drug use stops. <b>Anticholinergic</b> drugs block the action of acetylcholine, which transmits messages in the nervous system. In the brain, acetylcholine is involved in learning and memory.|$|E

25|$|Doses {{in excess}} of 3mg daily often {{required}} use of an <b>anticholinergic</b> drug to combat excessive cholinergic activity {{in many parts of}} the body as well as parkinsonism. For adjunctive treatment, doses are typically kept at or below 0.25mg twice a day.|$|E
25|$|Because {{trazodone}} has minimal <b>anticholinergic</b> activity, it {{was especially}} welcomed {{as a treatment for}} geriatric patients with depression when it first became available. Three double-blind studies reported trazodone has antidepressant efficacy similar to that of other antidepressants in geriatric patients. However, a side effect of trazodone, orthostatic hypotension, which may cause dizziness and increase the risk of falling, can have devastating consequences for elderly patients; thus, this side effect, along with sedation, often makes trazodone less acceptable for this population, compared with newer compounds that share its lack of <b>anticholinergic</b> activity but not the rest of its side-effect profile. Still, trazodone is often helpful for geriatric patients with depression who have severe agitation and insomnia.|$|E

25|$|At doses used {{to treat}} depression, doxepin appears to inhibit the reuptake of {{serotonin}} and norepinephrine and to have antihistamine, adrenergic and serotonin receptor antagonistic, and <b>anticholinergic</b> activities; at low doses {{used to treat}} insomnia {{it appears to be}} selective for the histamine H1 receptor.|$|E
25|$|Trazodone's potent α1-adrenergic {{blockade}} {{may cause}} some side effects like orthostatic hypotension and sedation. Conversely, along with 5-HT2A and H1 receptor antagonism, it {{may contribute to}} its efficacy as a hypnotic. Trazodone lacks any affinity for the muscarinic acetylcholine receptors, so does not produce <b>anticholinergic</b> side effects.|$|E
25|$|At {{very low}} doses, doxepin has not shown {{discontinuation}} or withdrawal effects nor rebound insomnia. Sustained effectiveness without apparent tolerance was demonstrated in clinical studies {{of up to}} 12weeks duration. This {{appears to be in}} contrast to over-the-counter antihistamines like diphenhydramine and doxylamine and all other first-generation antihistamines, which are associated with rapid development of tolerance and dependence (by day 3 or 4 of continuous dosing) and loss of hypnotic effectiveness. It is for this reason that, unlike doxepin, they are not recommended for the chronic management of insomnia and are advised for only short-term treatment (i.e., 1week). It is not entirely clear why doxepin and first-generation antihistamines are different in this regard, but {{it has been suggested that}} it may have to do with the lack of selectivity for the H1 receptor of the latter or may have to do with the use of optimal doses. Unlike very-low-dose doxepin, most first-generation antihistamines also have marked <b>anticholinergic</b> activity as well as associated side effects such as dry mouth, constipation, urinary retention, and confusion. This is particularly true in older people, and antihistamines with concomitant <b>anticholinergic</b> effects are not recommended in adults over the age of 65. <b>Anticholinergic</b> activity notably may interfere with the sleep-promoting effects of H1 receptor blockade.|$|E

25|$|Enuresis (involuntary urinating in sleep) in children. The {{effect may}} not be {{sustained}} following treatment, and alarm therapy {{may be more effective}} in both the short-term and the long-term. Combining a tricyclic (such as clomipramine) with <b>anticholinergic</b> medication, may be more effective for treating enuresis than the tricyclic alone.|$|E
25|$|Medications such as anticholinergics (benztropine), which act as inhibitors of the {{neurotransmitter}} acetylcholine, {{may provide}} some relief. In {{the case of}} an acute dystonic reaction, diphenhydramine is sometimes used (though this drug is well known as an antihistamine, in this context it is being used primarily for its <b>anticholinergic</b> role).. See also Procyclidine.|$|E
25|$|Common {{side effects}} include sleepiness, poor coordination, and an upset stomach. Its use is not {{recommended}} in babies. There is no clear risk of harm when used during pregnancy; however, use during breastfeeding {{is not recommended}}. It is a first generation H1-antihistamine and works by blocking certain effects of histamine. Diphenhydramine is also an <b>anticholinergic.</b>|$|E

40|$|Abstract: <b>Anticholinergics</b> {{have been}} used to treat obstructive {{respiratory}} disease for many years from historical preparations of the deadly nightshade genus, to the more recent developments of ipratropium, oxitropium, and tiotropium. The medical treatment of airways obstruction has focused on achieving maximal airway function through bronchodilators. Of the two main bronchodilators, beta 2 -agonists are often the first treatment choice although there is evidence of equivalence and some suggestions of the superiority of <b>anticholinergics</b> in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The following review looks at the background of <b>anticholinergics,</b> their pharmacological properties, and the evidence for use with suggestions for their place in the treatment of COPD...|$|R
25|$|Adjuvant analgesics, {{also called}} {{atypical}} analgesics, include nefopam, orphenadrine, pregabalin, gabapentin, cyclobenzaprine, hyoscine (scopolamine), {{and other drugs}} possessing anticonvulsant, <b>anticholinergic,</b> and/or antispasmodic properties, {{as well as many}} other drugs with CNS actions. These drugs are used along with analgesics to modulate and/or modify the action of opioids when used against pain, especially of neuropathic origin.|$|E
25|$|The major {{metabolite}} of doxepin, nordoxepin (desmethyldoxepin), is pharmacologically active similarly, but {{relative to}} doxepin, {{is much more}} selective as a norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor. In general, the demethylated variants of tertiary amine TCAs like doxepin are much more potent inhibitors of norepinephrine reuptake, less potent inhibitors of serotonin reuptake, and less potent in their antiadrenergic, antihistamine, and <b>anticholinergic</b> activities.|$|E
25|$|Tianeptine has {{antidepressant}} and anxiolytic effects with {{a relative}} lack of sedative, <b>anticholinergic,</b> and cardiovascular side effects. It {{has been found to}} act as an atypical agonist of the μ-opioid receptor with clinically negligible effects on the δ- and κ-opioid receptors. μ-Opioid receptor agonists typically induce euphoria, and in accordance, tianeptine does so at high doses well above the normal therapeutic range.|$|E
