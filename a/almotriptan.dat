50|$|<b>Almotriptan</b> is {{prescribed}} {{to treat the}} acute headache phase of migraine attacks with or without aura. <b>Almotriptan</b> is the only oral triptan approved in the USA {{for the treatment of}} migraine in adolescent from 12 to 17 years of age.|$|E
50|$|As {{mentioned}} previously, <b>almotriptan</b> is metabolized {{mainly by}} MAO-A and to lesser extent by CYP3A4 and CYP2D6. Studies of drugs used as preventive against migraine (propranolol and verapamil), anti-depressants (moclobemide and fluoxetine) yielded results that showed significant altering of the pharmacokinetics of <b>almotriptan</b> {{though they were}} deemed not clinically relevant.|$|E
50|$|Like all triptans, <b>almotriptan</b> has a {{high and}} {{specific}} affinity for serotonin 5-HT1B/1D receptors. Binding of the drug to the receptor leads to vasoconstriction of the cranial (brain) blood vessels and thus affects the redistribution of blood flow. <b>Almotriptan</b> significantly increases cerebral blood flow and reduces blood flow through extracerebral cranial vessels. Even though it affects cranial blood vessels a single standard dose of <b>almotriptan</b> has no clinically significant effect on blood pressure or heart rate in both young and elderly healthy volunteers. Larger doses seem to slightly increase blood pressure but not beyond clinical relevance.|$|E
50|$|The {{efficacy}} and tolerability of <b>almotriptan</b> {{has been studied}} in numerous randomised, control-led trials totaling more than 4800 adults with either moderate or severe attacks of migraine. Its efficacy is significantly more effective than placebo and alleviates nausea, photophobia and phonophobia linked to migraine attacks. <b>Almotriptan</b> has similar efficacy as a standard dose of sumatriptan, another triptan drug, and fewer adverse effects.|$|E

5000|$|Triptans are {{specific}} and selective agonists for the 5-HT1 receptors. Sumatriptan binds to 5-HT1D receptors, zolmitriptan, rizatriptan, naratriptan, <b>almotriptan,</b> and frovatriptan binds to 5-HT1B/1D and eletriptan binds to 5-HT1B/1D/1F receptors. Triptans {{are believed to}} exert their effects through vasoconstriction, leading to reduced carotid arterial circulation without affecting cerebral blood flow, peripheral neuronal inhibition, or inhibition of transmission through second order neurons of the trigeminocervical complex.|$|E
50|$|As {{with other}} triptans, <b>almotriptan</b> {{should not be}} used in {{patients}} with a history, symptoms or signs of ischaemic heart disease (myocardial infarction, angina pectoris, documented silent ischaemia, Prinzmetal’s angina) or severe hypertension and uncontrolled mild or moderate hypertension.Other contraindications are previous cerebrovascular accident (CVA) or transient ischaemic attack (TIA), peripheral vascular disease, severe hepatic impairment, concomitant administration of ergotamine, ergotamine derivatives (including methysergide) and other 5-HT1B/D agonists.|$|E
50|$|<b>Almotriptan</b> has linear {{pharmacokinetics}} {{up to the}} 16-fold standard dose. Its {{biological half-life}} is 3 hours, and its bioavailability 70%.Cmax is observed 1.5-4 hours after oral administration, and approximately 50% of the drug is excreted unchanged in the urine. Metabolism is mediated through the enzymes MAO-A and CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 oxidation.Almotriptan clearance is moderately reduced in the elderly but does not require dose adjustment. Sex does not alter the pharmacokinetics of the drug. People with moderate-to-severe renal dysfunction are recommended to use only half the dose.|$|E
50|$|Sumatriptan was {{the pioneer}} drug in this class. The second generation's triptans such as zolmitriptan, naratriptan, rizatriptan, <b>almotriptan,</b> {{eletriptan}} and frovatriptan soon became available.Different triptans {{are available in}} different formulations and in different strengths (see table 2). They have been formulated as subcutaneous injections, oral tablets, orally disintegrating tablets, nasal spray and as rectal suppositories. Delivery system of the triptans may {{play an important role}} in the onset of action. The selection of anti-migraine drug for patients depends on their symptoms. The first selective 5-HT1B/1D agonist, sumatriptan, was first synthesized as a subcutaneous injection, then as an oral tablets and more recently as a nasal spray, it is also available in some countries as suppositories. The subcutaneous injection is the fastest way to stop a rapidly progressing migraine attacks. The sumatriptan nasal spray provides faster onset of action than the tablets but it produces a similar headache response at 2 hours. Some patients prefer the nasal spray as it works more rapidly than the tablets and does not have as many adverse effects as the subcutaneous injection. Nasal spray is although not suitable for all patients, because some patients experience bad taste and lack of consistency of response. Zolmitriptan was developed with the strategy to create a more lipophilic compound, with faster absorption and better ability to cross the blood brain barrier than sumatriptan. It is available as tablets, orally disintegrating tablets and as nasal spray in some countries. Rizatriptan is available as tablets and orally disintegrating tablets but naratriptan, <b>almotriptan,</b> eletriptan and frovatriptan are only available in tablets, for now.|$|E

40|$|To assess patient {{preference}} for <b>almotriptan</b> 12. 5 mg vs rizatriptan 10 mg for the acute treatment of migraine. METHODS: Randomized, multicenter, open-label, crossover trial in which triptan-naïve patients treated two moderate/severe migraine attacks, the first with one triptan {{and the second}} with the other: 183 patients took rizatriptan followed by <b>almotriptan</b> and 189 treated in the reverse order.

RESULTS: Of those recording a preference (209), 54. 5 % preferred <b>almotriptan,</b> but statistical significance was not achieved. The main reason for {{preference for}} {{one or the other}} triptan was efficacy: 43 % of patients preferring <b>almotriptan</b> gave faster headache relief as the reason and 34 % cited faster return to normal activities. The corresponding values for rizatriptan were 47 % and 38 %. A significantly greater proportion of those preferring <b>almotriptan</b> cited fewer adverse events (AEs) as the reason. <b>Almotriptan</b> and rizatriptan were of comparable efficacy and both treatments were well tolerated; 9 % of patients experienced AEs probably or possibly related to study medication after <b>almotriptan</b> vs 14 % after rizatriptan. <b>Almotriptan</b> was associated with a significantly lower incidence of triptan-associated AEs in triptan-naïve patients (8. 5 % vs 18 % with rizatriptan). CONCLUSION: Physicians should use information from meta-analyses and preference studies like this one to aid in the selection of a triptan with a high likelihood of providing rapid, sustained relief from pain coupled with an absence of AEs. About 55 % of patients recording a preference in this trial preferred <b>almotriptan,</b> perhaps because of its combination of good efficacy and lower incidence of triptan-associated AEs...|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to evaluate patients' satisfaction with acute treatment of migraine with frovatriptan or <b>almotriptan</b> by preference questionnaire. One hundred and thirty three subjects with a history of migraine with or without aura (IHS 2004 criteria), with at least one migraine attack in the preceding 6 months, were enrolled and randomized to frovatriptan 2. 5 mg or <b>almotriptan</b> 12. 5 mg, treating 1 - 3 attacks. The study had a multicenter, randomized, double blind, cross-over design, with treatment periods lasting < 3 months. At study end patients assigned preference to one of the treatments using a questionnaire with a score from 0 to 5 (primary endpoint). Secondary endpoints were pain free and pain relief episodes at 2 and 4 h, and recurrent and sustained pain free episodes within 48 h. Of the 133 patients (86 %, intention-to-treat population) 114 of them expressed a preference for a triptan. The average preference score was not significantly different between frovatriptan (3. 1 +/- 1. 3) and <b>almotriptan</b> (3. 4 +/- 1. 3). The rates of pain free (30 % frovatriptan vs. 32 % <b>almotriptan)</b> and pain relief (54 % vs. 56 %) episodes at 2 h did not significantly differ between treatments. This was the case also at 4 h (pain free: 56 % vs. 59 %; pain relief: 75 % vs. 72 %).

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{determine}} the cost-effectiveness of the 5 -HT 1 B/ 1 D agonists, or triptans, in the acute treatment of migraine. METHODS: To {{determine the}} cost-effectiveness of the triptans, a meta-analysis was conducted of the efficacy data from 27 oral triptan trials, using the endpoint of "pain-free " status within 2 hours after initial dosing as the indicator of efficacy. Efficacy data {{were used to}} determine the number needed to treat (NNT) to achieve pain-free status in 1 patient within 2 hours postdose and then applied the per-dose costs for each triptan to the NNT values. RESULTS: Rizatriptan 10 mg and <b>almotriptan</b> 12. 5 mg were the most cost-effective of the triptans, costing $ 48. 34 and $ 48. 57, respectively, to achieve pain-free status in 1 patient within 2 hours postdose. Frovatriptan 2. 5 mg was the most costly, with a cost-effective ratio of $ 162. 49. All other triptans fell between these extremes: zolmitriptan 5 mg ($ 65. 18), sumatriptan 100 mg ($ 70. 83), sumatriptan 50 mg ($ 75. 67), zolmitriptan 2. 5 mg ($ 78. 74), and naratriptan 2. 5 mg ($ 141. 43), in decreasing order of cost-effectiveness.

The Regression analysis of Beer‟s Law plot showed good correlation in a general concentration range of 8 - 40 µg/ml or 4. 0 - 20 µg/ml with correlation coefficient (r = 0. 998) for methods M 1 and M 2 respectively. The proposed methods are validated with respect to accuracy, precision, linearity and limit of detection. The suggested procedures are successfully applied to {{the determination of the}} drug in pharmaceutical preparation, with high percentage of recovery, good accuracy and precision. The results of analysis have been validated statistically by repeatability and recovery studies. The results are found satisfactory and reproducible. These methods are applied successfully for the estimation of <b>almotriptan</b> in tablet form without the interference of excipients...|$|E
30|$|Migraine is {{a primary}} {{headache}} which causes pulsate, one-sided headache, and common symptoms including vomiting, nausea, and environmental sensitivity which often last 4 – 48  h (Kristoffersen and Lundqvist 2014). Migraine has four possible phases including prodrome (hours or days before the headache), aura (right before headache), pain (main headache), and postdrome (following effects of headache) (Lauritzen 1994). Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs including ibuprofen and acetaminophen are effective treatments, but in case of severe and chronic migraine, triptans family such as sumatriptan, eletriptan, zolmitriptan, naratriptan, <b>almotriptan,</b> frovatriptan, and rizatriptan must be used (Gilmore and Michael 2011; Wang et al. 2007).|$|E
