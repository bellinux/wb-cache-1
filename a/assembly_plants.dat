5|$|Since 1994, all Australian-built Holden {{vehicles}} were manufactured at Elizabeth, South Australia, and engines were produced at the Fishermans Bend plant in Melbourne. Historically, production or <b>assembly</b> <b>plants</b> were operated in all mainland states of Australia.

5|$|The growth {{witnessed}} {{in the late}} 1970s and early 1980s was interrupted by another U.S. recession in 1981, in which silver, timber, and farm prices dropped. The period of decline for the city lasted into the 1990s and was also marked by a loss of many steady family-wage jobs in the manufacturing sector. Although this was a tough period, Spokane's economy had started to benefit from some measure of economic diversification; growing companies such as Key Tronic and other research, marketing, and <b>assembly</b> <b>plants</b> for technology companies helped lessen Spokane's dependence on natural resources.|$|E

5|$|GM <b>assembly</b> <b>plants</b> were {{operated}} in New Zealand from 1926 until 1990 by General Motors New Zealand Limited {{in an earlier}} and quite separate operation from Holden's in Australia. Although Holden's involvement in exports has fluctuated since the 1950s, the declining sales of large cars in Australia led the company to look to international markets to increase profitability. Since 2010 Holden has incurred losses due to the strong Australian dollar, and government grants have been reduced. This led to the announcement on 11 December 2013 that Holden will cease vehicle and engine production {{by the end of}} 2017, however, the company will continue to have a large and ongoing presence in Australia importing and selling cars as national sales company. Holden will retain their design centre, but with reduced staffing.|$|E
5|$|Throughout Japan, Nabi caused {{damage in}} 31 of the 47prefectures, leaving over 270,000residences without power. Torrential rains caused {{flooding}} and landslides throughout the country. The storm destroyed 7,452houses and flooded 21,160others. Several car <b>assembly</b> <b>plants</b> were damaged in southwestern Japan, {{while others were}} closed due to power outages, such as Toyota, Mazda, and Mitsubishi. In addition, the storm wrecked about 81ships along the coast. On the island of Kyushu, damage in Ōita Prefecture on Kyushu reached ¥11.7billion (US$106million), the fifth highest of any typhoon in the preceding 10years; about 20% of the total there was related to road damages. In nearby Saga Prefecture, crop damage totaled about ¥1.06billion (US$9.6million), mostly to rice but also to soybeans and various other vegetables. Crop damage as a whole on Kyushu totaled ¥4.08billion (US$36.9million).|$|E
5|$|By 1923, HMBB were {{producing}} 12,000units per year. During this time, HMBB was {{the first}} company to assemble bodies for Ford Motor Company of Australia until its Geelong plant was completed. From 1924, HMBB became the exclusive supplier of car bodies for GM in Australia, with manufacturing taking place at the new Woodville plant. These bodies were made to suit a number of chassis imported from manufacturers such as Chevrolet and Dodge. In 1926 General Motors (Australia) was established with <b>assembly</b> <b>plants</b> at Newstead, Queensland; Marrickville, New South Wales; City Road, Melbourne; Birkenhead, South Australia; and Cottesloe, Western Australia using bodies produced by Holden Motor Body Builders and imported complete knock down (CKD) chassis. In 1930 alone, the still independent Woodville plant built bodies for Austin, Chrysler, DeSoto, Morris, Hillman, Humber, Hupmobile and Willys-Overland as well GM cars. The last of this line of business was the assembly of Hillman Minx sedans in 1948. The Great Depression led to a substantial downturn in production by Holden, from 34,000units annually in 1930 to just 1,651units one year later. In 1931 General Motors purchased Holden Motor Body Builders and merged it with General Motors (Australia) Pty Ltd to form General Motors-Holden's Ltd (GM-H). Throughout the 1920s Holden also supplied tramcars to the Melbourne & Metropolitan Tramways Board, of which several examples have been preserved in both Australia and New Zealand.|$|E

In the 1920s, Ford also opened plants in Australia, India, and France, and by 1929, he had successful dealerships on six continents. Ford experimented with a commercial rubber plantation in the Amazon jungle called Fordlândia; it was one of his few failures.|$|E
