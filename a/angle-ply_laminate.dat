Adding these corrective terms to the assumed displacements in (i) Classical Laminate Plate Theory (CLPT) and (ii) Classical Laminate Shear Deformation Theory (CLSDT), two new refined lamination-dependent shear deformation models are developed.

40|$|Analysis of <b>angle-ply</b> <b>laminates</b> becomes {{critical}} and computationally involved {{because of the}} presence of extension-shear coupling. A refined three-dimensional, mixed, 18 -node finite-element (FE) model has been developed to analyse <b>angle-ply</b> <b>laminates</b> under static loading. The minimum potential energy principle has been used for the development of the mixed FE model, where the transverse stress components (tau(xz), tau(yz) and sigma(z), where z is the thickness direction) have been incorporated as the nodal degrees of freedom, in addition to the three displacement fields. Further, continuity of transverse stress fields through the thickness of the plate and layerwise continuity of displacement fields have been enforced in the formulation. Because all the constitutive and the compatibility conditions have been ensured within the continuum, the present formulation is unique amongst the family of mixed FE models. Results have been obtained for various <b>angle-ply</b> <b>laminates</b> and compared with analytical and finite-element solutions, which have been found to be in good agreement with them. Some new results on angle-ply with clamped-clamped support condition have also been presented to serve as benchmark results. Copyright (C) 2003 John Wiley Sons, Ltd...|$|R

40|$|Results are {{presented}} of parametric studies {{to assess the}} effects of various parameters on the buckling behavior of angle-ply, laminated thin shells in a hot environment. These results were obtained by using a three-dimensional finite element analysis. An angle-ply, laminated thin shell with fiber orientation of (theta/-theta) (sub 2) was subjected to compressive mechanical loads. The laminated thin shell had a cylindrical geometry. The laminate contained T 300 graphite fibers embedded in an intermediate-modulus, high-strength (IMHS) matrix. The fiber volume fraction was 55 percent and the moisture content was 2 percent. The residual stresses induced into the laminate structure during the curing were taken into account. Parametric studies were performed to examine {{the effect on the}} critical buckling load of the following parameters: cylinder length and thickness, internal hydrostatic pressure, different ply thicknesses, different temperature profiles through the thickness of the structure, and different lay up configurations and fiber volume fractions. In conjunction with these parameters the ply orientation was varied from 0 deg to 90 deg. Seven ply angles were examined: 0 deg, 15 deg, 30 deg, 45 deg, 60 deg, 75 deg, and 90 deg. The results show that the ply angle theta and the laminate thickness had significant effects on the critical buckling load. The fiber volume fraction, the fiber orientations, and the internal hydrostatic pressure had important effects on the critical buckling load. The cylinder length had a moderate influence on the buckling load. The thin shell with (theta/-theta) (sub 2) or (theta/-theta) (sub s) <b>angle-ply</b> <b>laminate</b> had better buckling-load performance than the thin shell with (theta) (sub 4) <b>angle-ply</b> <b>laminate.</b> The temperature profiles through the laminate thickness and various laminates with the different ply thicknesses has insignificant effects on the buckling behavior of the thin shells...|$|E
40|$|Analytical {{solutions}} are sought for optimal temperature distributions {{to control the}} interlaminar stresses near the free edges of composite laminates subjected to uniaxial loading. Optimal through-thickness temperature gradients are obtained by minimizing appropriate performance indices that are functions of the far-field properties, {{with respect to the}} through-thickness temperature differences. Through the application of these temperatures, effects of local mismatches as well as global mismatches in two of the elastic properties, the Poisson's ratio and coefficient of mutual influence, are minimized. Numerical examples are given for several lay-ups made of graphite epoxy. It is shown that for a cross- or <b>angle-ply</b> <b>laminate</b> a uniform temperature rise or drop can completely eliminate all of the interlaminar stresses, whereas for other laminates nonuniform temperature distributions must be applied to minimize the stresses...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: Classical {{laminated}} plate theory (CLPT) {{is applied to}} a laminate plate with induced strain actuators, such as piezoceramic patch, bonded to its surface or em-bedded within the laminate to develop an induced strain actuation theory that allows for the actuator patch to be spatially distributed.

Typical S log sub 10 N curves were determined experimentally at 25 C, 75 C, and 115 C. The time-temperature superposition principle was employed to find the shift factors of uniaxial fatigue strength, and a general linear equation of S log sub 10 N for shifting purpose was established. The combined techniques of cyclic creep measurements and optical microscopy upon fatigue failure allow some assessment of the possible physical basis of S log 10 N curve shifting.
