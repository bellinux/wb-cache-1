5|$|This {{behaviour}} {{appears at}} first to be an evolutionary paradox, since helping others costs precious resources and decreases one's own fitness. Previously, many had interpreted this as an aspect of group selection: individuals <b>are</b> <b>doing</b> <b>what</b> {{is best for the}} survival of the population or species as a whole. British evolutionary biologist W. D. Hamilton used gene-frequency analysis in his inclusive fitness theory to show how hereditary altruistic traits can evolve if there is sufficient genetic similarity between actors and recipients of such altruism (including close relatives). Hamilton's inclusive fitness has since been successfully applied {{to a wide range of}} organisms, including humans. Similarly, Robert Trivers, thinking in terms of the gene-centred model, developed the theory of reciprocal altruism, whereby one organism provides a benefit to another in the expectation of future reciprocation. Dawkins popularised these ideas in The Selfish Gene, and developed them in his own work. In June 2012 Dawkins was highly critical of fellow biologist E.O. Wilson's 2012 book The Social Conquest of Earth as misunderstanding Hamilton's theory of kin selection. Dawkins has also been strongly critical of the Gaia hypothesis of the independent scientist James Lovelock.|$|E

500|$|As of 2004, Monster owned about 300 trademarks, 70 {{of which}} {{are related to the}} word [...] "Monster". By 2009, the company had made 190 filings with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. Most filings were to delay {{potentially}} infringing trademark applications so Monster could study them. Some were formal oppositions and about 30 resulted in lawsuits. Most lawsuits were settled with non-disclosed terms. Critics and defendants say that Monster is too aggressive in pursuing trademark protections against companies that do not have confusingly similar products and that it is trying to own a common word, not protect a brand. Monster representatives say they <b>are</b> <b>doing</b> <b>what</b> most [...] "premium" [...] brands do to protect their marks and that their products include things like clothes, mints and music.|$|E

500|$|On August 8, 2004—with 86days to {{go before}} the general election—the Illinois Republican Party drafted Alan Keyes to run against Democratic state senator Barack Obama for the U.S. Senate, after the Republican nominee, Jack Ryan, withdrew due to a sex scandal, and other {{potential}} draftees (most notably former Illinois governor Jim Edgar and former Chicago Bears coach Mike Ditka) declined to run. The Washington Post called Keyes a [...] "carpetbagger" [...] since he [...] "had never lived in Illinois." [...] When asked to answer charges of carpetbagging in the context of his earlier criticism of Hillary Clinton, he called her campaign [...] "pure and planned selfish ambition", but stated that in his case he felt a moral obligation to run after being asked to by the Illinois Republican Party. [...] "You <b>are</b> <b>doing</b> <b>what</b> you believe to be required by your respect for God's will, and I think that that's what I'm doing in Illinois".|$|E

[...] Bamie and Eleanor eventually reconciled, and {{in an article in}} the Ladies Home Journal, [...] "How to Take Criticism," [...] Eleanor referred to her, saying, [...] "I can honestly say that I hate no one, and perhaps the best advice I can give to anyone who suffers from criticism and yet must be in the public eye, would be contained in the words of my aunt, Mrs. William Sheffield Cowles. She was President Theodore Roosevelt's sister and the aunt to whom many of the young people in the family went for advice. I had asked her whether I should do something which at that time would have caused a great deal of criticism, and her answer was: 'Do not be bothered by what people say as long as you are sure that you <b>are</b> <b>doing</b> <b>what</b> seems right to you, but be sure that you face yourself honestly.'" [...] Theodore's elder daughter Alice also broke with Eleanor over her campaign. Alice and Eleanor reconciled after Eleanor wrote Alice a comforting letter upon the death of Alice's daughter, Paulina Longworth.|$|E

2500|$|However, the Derg {{was split}} by a rivalry between Mengistu and a faction allied against him, which limited his control. This rivalry was {{resolved}} {{at the meeting}} of the Standing Committee of the Derg on 3 February 1977, at which fifty-eight top Derg officers were killed in an hour-long shootout. Seven of these officers were opponents of Mengistu, including chairman and Lieutenant General Tafari Benti, Captain Almayahu Haile, Captain Mogas Wolde Mikael and Lt. Colonel Asrat Desta, the latter being an avowed Marxist-Leninist: [...] "We <b>are</b> <b>doing</b> <b>what</b> Lenin did. You cannot build socialism without Red Terror." [...] Although two rivals to Mengistu were still alive—Colonel Berhanu Bayeh and Lt. Colonel Atnafu Abate—Col. Berhanu had sided with Mengistu, and Lt. Colonel Atnafu quickly sided with the victor of the bloodbath, leaving Mengistu as the undisputed head of the Derg, and ruler of Ethiopia. A few days later, Mengistu turned his attention to his rivals outside of the Derg, foremost being the EPRP.|$|E

2500|$|In September 2014, the Las Vegas Sun {{featured}} {{an article}} about the adult industry's possible relocation from Southern California to Las Vegas. According to commentary by AVN magazine's political analyst Mark Kernes, the author of the Sun article, Andrea Domanick, [...] "manages to make a few good points—and snags some quotes from Kink.com CEO Peter Acworth". In the article Acworth is quoted as saying, [...] "Vegas is looking more and more attractive as time goes by... I {{think that a lot of}} companies <b>are</b> <b>doing</b> <b>what</b> we’re doing. They’re setting up satellite offices and getting their feet wet with Vegas as a potential place to shoot. The move is happening, but quietly. They don’t want a target on their back." [...] Acworth had announced several weeks earlier that he was shopping for office/production space in Las Vegas. The article also mentions the ease of production relative to California by stating that Nevada requires film permits only for specific locations and conditions. It states, [...] "Shooting on private property, frequently the choice of porn producers, requires no permit or notification, and the state has no explicit regulations about condom use." [...] The article also quotes a technician with knowledge of the mainstream film industry in Southern California and Nevada. Jim Reid of JR Lighting, one of Nevada's largest production rental companies stated, [...] "A lot of people I know in the mainstream industry started out in the adult industry in California. It’s a very good training ground." ...|$|E
