40|$|This paper investigates {{whether there}} is <b>a</b> {{discrepancy}} between <b>stated</b> and actual aims in biomechanical research, {{particularly with respect to}} hypothesis testing. We present an analysis of one hundred papers recently published in The Journal of Experimental Biology and Journal of Biomechanics, and examine the prevalence of papers which (a) have hypothesis testing <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>stated</b> aim, (b) contain hypothesis testing claims that appear to be purely presentational (i. e. which seem not to have influenced the actual study), and (c) have exploration <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>stated</b> aim. We found that whereas no papers had exploration <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>stated</b> aim, 58 per cent of papers had hypothesis testing <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>stated</b> aim. We had strong suspicions, at the bare minimum, that presentational hypotheses were present in 31 per cent of the papers in this latter group...|$|R

5|$|By 1920, {{what would}} {{originally}} become DE 404 was an unimproved county road, with the section east of Bridgeville under contract <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>state</b> highway. The entire route {{of what would}} become DE 404 was completed <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>state</b> highway to a point northwest of Bridgeville by 1924. By 1931, the road was built <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>state</b> highway northwest to the Maryland border. DE 404 was designated to run from the Maryland border, where it connected to MD 404, southeast to DE 18 southeast of Bridgeville by 1936.
