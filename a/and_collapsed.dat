5|$|After the First World War ended, severe discontent among farmers (over wheat prices) {{and union}} members (over wage rates) {{resulted}} in an upsurge of radicalism, coupled with a polarization over the rise of Bolshevism in Russia. The most dramatic result was the Winnipeg general strike of 1919. It began on 15 May <b>and</b> <b>collapsed</b> on 25 June 1919; as the workers gradually returned to their jobs, the Central Strike Committee decided to end the movement.|$|E
5|$|At about 8:30am {{the wooden}} {{construction}} of {{the main part of}} the building also burned through <b>and</b> <b>collapsed.</b> Despite the fact that there were still people in the building and more people were lying around the building severely injured, the fire fighters decided to withdraw. The fire department proceeded to extinguish the smoking debris, and at 9:30am the fire was declared under control. The building's collapse left a gaping hole; of the hotel, the furniture store and the book store, almost nothing remained.|$|E
5|$|City College's Tudor and Gothic-style building, {{designed}} by Baltimore City Hall architect George A Frederick, lasted until 1892, {{when it was}} undermined by {{the construction of the}} Baltimore & Ohio Railroad tunnel from Camden Station to Mount Royal Station, <b>and</b> <b>collapsed.</b> Several years of political in-fighting and the change to a reformist city administration delayed construction of a new structure. Designed by the architects Baldwin and Pennington, the new structure was not completed until 1899.|$|E
30|$|Alveolar hyperdistension and collapse: As Vt {{correlates}} {{well with}} local impedance lung changes [21 – 24], pixel-by-pixel compliance was calculated as ∆impedance/(plateau pressure—PEEP). Alveolar overdistension <b>and</b> <b>collapse</b> was then computed as previously described by Costa et al. [25]. Finally, alveolar hyperdistension <b>and</b> <b>collapse</b> was calculated as {{the sum of}} alveolar hyperdistension <b>and</b> <b>collapse</b> expressed as percentage value.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Taking {{account of}} the {{influence}} of friction between the outer wall of buckling tubular and the inner wall of casing under vibrating loads, the burst <b>and</b> <b>collapse</b> strengths of worn tubular would be reduced greatly compared to the unworn tubular. If the reduction of burst <b>and</b> <b>collapse</b> strength weren’t taken into consideration, there may be potential risk in well completion. The models of worn tubular strings were established based on finite element method, and thus the relationships between strength of burst <b>and</b> <b>collapse</b> <b>and</b> the degree of wear were analyzed. The results of FEM were verified by the equations in API 5 C 3. The results show that the strengths of burst <b>and</b> <b>collapse</b> will be reduced with the increase of wear degree, and the burst strength will be reduced more sharply. When the tubular strings are worn by 30 %, the strengths of burst <b>and</b> <b>collapse</b> will be reduced by almost 50 %. While the strengths of burst <b>and</b> <b>collapse</b> will be reduced by almost 60 %, when the tubular strings are worn by 50 %. So, to avoid the accident caused by the worn tubular, the work case should be controlled strictly correspondingly...|$|R

5|$|On August 3, 1915, the Mill Creek (Lake Erie) flooded {{downtown}} Erie. A culvert, or a tunnel, {{was blocked}} by debris, <b>and</b> <b>collapsed.</b> A four-block reservoir, caused by torrential downpours, had formed behind it. The resulting deluge destroyed 225houses and killed 36people. After the flood, Mayor Miles Brown Kitts had the Mill Creek directed into another larger culvert, constructed under more than 2 miles of city, before emptying into Presque Isle Bay on the city's lower east side.|$|E

5|$|Communications with severed with towns {{along the}} southwestern {{coastline}} as roads and rail lines were washed away. Thousands of residents sought refuge by moving to higher ground. The Korean relief center reported that 762homes were destroyed and another 11,700flooded {{due to the}} storm. Other reports indicated that upwards of 5,900homes were destroyed. More than 191,000acres (77,300hectares) of farmland was washed out. Throughout South Korea, 113people lost their lives. Most of the deaths resulted from landslides, swollen rivers, <b>and</b> <b>collapsed</b> embankments. Total damage in the country amounted to $134million, with agriculture accounting for at least $24million. Additionally, 28,000people were left homeless. The disaster relief agency Hope Bridge provided 7.5billion won ($10.2million) in aid to areas affected by the storm.|$|E
5|$|During World War II, fuel {{stocks were}} used by the armies, and were {{unavailable}} to farmers. This allowed horses to remain a key aspect of agriculture and transportation {{until the end of}} the war. After the war, farmers rapidly mechanized their operations. The Auxois and other draft breeds were quickly abandoned in favor of machines, and population numbers began to fall in the early 1950s <b>and</b> <b>collapsed</b> completely in the 1960s. By the 1970s, the Auxois had almost disappeared, although many villages in the breed's homeland retained a small number of mares for traditional competitions.|$|E

Formby was advised by doctors to emigrate to South Africa for the benefit of his health, but he preferred to stay in Britain, with his wife and children, and continued to work. During his performances his wife would wait in the wings with ice for him to suck to stop internal bleeding, and an oxygen tent was present in the stage wings ready for emergencies.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Collapse-type {{shrinkage}} is {{the greatest}} obstacle to prevent planted eucalypts from being used for solid wood products. In {{order to make the}} suitable drying schedules for high effective utilization of eucalypt wood, the total shrinkage <b>and</b> <b>collapse</b> on two species of difficult-to-dry E. urophylla and E. grandis wood under continuous and intermittent drying regimes were measured. The results show that total shrinkage <b>and</b> <b>collapse</b> in both eucalypts exhibited higher values for continuous drying than intermittent drying. With increasing drying temperature, total shrinkage <b>and</b> <b>collapse</b> increase in both drying regimes, while the increasing magnitude of both parameters becomes apparently larger for continuous drying than intermittent drying regime, in particular higher temperature condition. Properly elevating drying temperature {{to make up for the}} intermittent-waiting time may be allowed for intermittent drying regime. Drying duration at each intermittent drying period has a greater effect on total shrinkage <b>and</b> <b>collapse</b> of eucalypt wood. When more than a drying duration of 6 hours at an intermittent drying period is used, the differences in shrinkage <b>and</b> <b>collapse</b> between both drying regimes are very slight. Intermittent duration at an intermittent drying period has a comparatively larger effect on total shrinkage <b>and</b> <b>collapse.</b> Accordingly, we may draw a conclusion that intermittent drying regime is very likely to be a potential drying one suitable for collapse-prone lower-density plantation-grown eucalypt wood...|$|R

5|$|In the {{immediate}} aftermath of Henry's death, Richard successfully claimed his father's lands; he later left on the Third Crusade, but never married Alice as he had agreed with Philip Augustus. Eleanor was released from house arrest and regained control of Aquitaine, where she ruled on Richard's behalf. Henry's empire, however, did not survive long <b>and</b> <b>collapsed</b> during the reign of his youngest son John, when Philip captured all of the Angevin possessions in France except Gascony. This collapse had various causes, including long-term changes in economic power, growing cultural differences between England and Normandy but, in particular, the fragile, familial nature of Henry's empire.|$|E

5|$|Amid decolonisation and the Wind of Change, the Federation {{failed to}} become a Commonwealth realm <b>and</b> <b>collapsed</b> in 1963. Two years later, {{following}} prolonged dispute with Britain over the terms for full sovereignty, the mostly white government in Southern Rhodesia (or Rhodesia, following Northern Rhodesia's independence as Zambia) issued a Unilateral Declaration of Independence (UDI). The Rhodesian government, counting several World War II veterans including the Prime Minister Ian Smith, attempted to emphasise Rhodesians' prior war record on Britain's behalf by declaring independence on Armistice Day, 11 November, at 11:00 local time. As part of its subsequent isolation of Rhodesia, the UK government banned the post-UDI authorities from {{taking part in the}} annual Armistice Day service at the Cenotaph in London. Smith's government organised its own Rhodesian wreath-laying ceremony there.
