5|$|Blyton {{felt she}} had <b>a</b> <b>responsibility</b> <b>to</b> provide her readers with a strong moral framework, so she {{encouraged}} them to support worthy causes. In particular, through the clubs she set up or supported, she encouraged and organised them {{to raise funds for}} animal and paediatric charities. The story of Blyton's life was dramatised in a BBC film entitled Enid, featuring Helena Bonham Carter in the title role and first broadcast in the United Kingdom on BBC Four in 2009. There have also been several adaptations of her books for stage, screen and television.|$|E
5|$|In 1970 the United States Congress {{repealed}} mandatory {{penalties for}} cannabis offenses and The Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act separated cannabis from other illicit narcotics and removed mandatory sentences {{for possession of}} small amounts of cannabis. In 1972 President Richard Nixon commissioned a comprehensive study from the National Commission on Marijuana and Drug Abuse. The Commission found that the constitutionality of cannabis prohibition was suspect and that the executive and legislative branches had <b>a</b> <b>responsibility</b> <b>to</b> obey the Constitution, {{even in the absence}} of a court ruling to do so. The Richard Nixon administration did not implement the study's recommendations.|$|E
5|$|In another storyline {{her sister}} Charlie Buckton (Esther Anderson) reveals {{she is in}} fact her mother. The reveal episode {{centered}} around Ruby interrogating Charlie about the identity of her secret child, with Charlie breaking down whilst she admits the truth. Whilst filming the episodic block, both Breeds and Anderson found the storyline challenging; furthermore they felt <b>a</b> <b>responsibility</b> <b>to</b> get the narrative flow and emotions perfect. Breeds {{said she had to}} let it affect her own emotions in order to affect the viewing public. Although she was nervous, Breeds was pleased with the end result.|$|E

5|$|Soon {{after the}} Sharpeville {{massacre}} in 1960, Makeba {{learned that her}} mother had died. When she tried to return home for the funeral, she found that her South African passport had been cancelled. Two of Makeba's family members were killed in the massacre. The incident left her concerned about her family, many of whom were still in South Africa, including her daughter: the nine-year-old Bongi joined her mother in the US in August 1960. During her first few years in the US, Makeba had rarely sung explicitly political music, but her popularity had led to an increase in awareness of apartheid and the anti-apartheid movement. Following the Sharpeville killings, Makeba felt <b>a</b> <b>responsibility</b> <b>to</b> help, as she had been able to leave the country while others had not. From this point, she became an increasingly outspoken critic of apartheid and the white-minority government; before the massacre, she had taken care to avoid overtly political statements in South Africa.|$|E
5|$|The 1980s saw {{the growth}} of {{speculative}} house building by developers. These introduced English brick and half-timbered vernacular styles to Scotland, which had been largely unknown before this period. Many were small and built to minimum standards with little regard to energy or environmental issues. Sales of council houses were popular in Scotland and until the mid-1990s as, unlike in England, local authorities could use the whole of their capital receipts for development. Under the Scottish Assembly, Scottish Homes was abolished and replaced by Communities Scotland in 2001, which had <b>a</b> <b>responsibility</b> <b>to</b> provide affordable housing and environmental improvement. In 2011 it was in turn replaced by the Scottish Housing Regulator, whose remit includes Scottish local authority landlords.|$|E
5|$|The {{capture of}} the JNA barracks in Bjelovar also {{affected}} the ceasefire agreement reached between the JNA and Croatia in Igalo, specifically a provision regarding {{the lifting of the}} blockade of the JNA barracks there. Initially there was a dispute between Tuđman and JNA General Veljko Kadijević as to whether it meant achieving normal living conditions in the barracks or complete freedom of movement for the JNA in Croatia. A compromise interpretation was negotiated, only to be dropped by Kadijević specifically because of the events in Bjelovar. On 1 October, Kadijević issued an ultimatum to Croatia threatening destruction of one civilian facility vital to the Croatian population for each military post captured by the ZNG. The ultimatum demonstrated that the JNA considered Croatia enemy territory, rather than part of the country it had <b>a</b> <b>responsibility</b> <b>to</b> protect.|$|E

The report moved beyond the question of military intervention, arguing that a range of diplomatic and humanitarian actions could also be utilized to protect civilian populations.|$|E
