5|$|Two {{stages of}} {{volcanic}} activity constructed the Itcha Range. The first stage, {{referred to as}} the felsic shield-building stage, occurred between 3.8and 3.0million years ago. Three phases comprise this stage; a pre-explosive phase, an explosive phase and a post-explosive phase. Analysis of the first trachyte magmas to erupt during the pre-explosive phase suggest they were relatively fluid as shown by their <b>areal</b> extent. Eruptions became more viscous during the explosive phase, followed by more viscosity during the post-explosive phase. As a result, the volume of erupted material became smaller over time. The increasing viscousness of felsic lava during the shield-building stage suggests a maturing plumbing system underneath the Itcha Range, which may have consisted of multiple, isolated, cupola-type magma chambers.|$|E
5|$|When {{speakers}} of different languages interact closely, it is typical for their languages to influence each other. Through sustained language contact over long periods, linguistic traits diffuse between languages, and languages belonging to different families may converge {{to become more}} similar. In areas where many languages are in close contact, this {{may lead to the}} formation of language areas in which unrelated languages share a number of linguistic features. A number of such language areas have been documented, among them, the Balkan language area, the Mesoamerican language area, and the Ethiopian language area. Also, larger areas such as South Asia, Europe, and Southeast Asia have sometimes been considered language areas, because of widespread diffusion of specific <b>areal</b> features.|$|E

5|$|Cerro Blanco {{is part of}} the Central Volcanic Zone and {{is located}} at the {{southern}} limit of the Puna. It forms a volcanic unit together with the Aguada Alumbrera ignimbrite, at {{the eastern edge of the}} Cordillera de San Buenaventura. Rocks beneath this unit include dacitic–trachyandesitic volcanites 9–7 mya old and an igneous-metamorphic granitic basement containing orthogneiss, quartz of Neoproterozoic-early Paleozoic age, containing paleozoic mafic to ultramafic volcanic inclusions. The Cordillera de San Buenaventura is formed from lava domes and volcanic complexes of intermediary composition of Upper Miocene–Quaternary age. During the Miocene-Pleistocene, the isotope and chemical composition of <b>areal</b> magmas has moved away from arc like magmas to distinctly water-poor and unoxidized petrologies. This finding is consistent with a hot mantle forming after delamination of the crust and migration of the arc.|$|E
5|$|Initially, {{the storm}} moved westward under the {{influence}} of a strong subtropical ridge to the south. Despite having reached tropical cyclone intensity according to Perth TCWC, it was not assigned a name. Once the storm crossed 90°E on March25, the Météo-France's La Réunion Regional Specialized Meteorological Center (MFR) began tracking the system as a moderate tropical storm, giving it the name Hudah. Gradually intensifying, Hudah developed an eye with an eyewall primarily in the northern semicircle, indicated by a Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) pass over the system. On March26, Hudah ceased strengthening as cloud tops warmed and the eye became no longer evident. Atmospheric divergence remained favorable, and Hudah eventually restrengthened, attaining tropical cyclone intensity at 0000UTC on March27, while located approximately 1,200km (750mi) southeast of Diego Garcia. This period of strengthening was short-lived, likely due to dry air. The cloud structure fluctuated as well, with a poorly-defined eye appearing at times on satellite imagery. Hudah was able to attain an initial peak intensity of 155km/h (95mph) at 0600UTC on March29 according to the MFR, shortly after passing 1010km (630mi) south of Diego Garcia. An anticyclone that had been over Hudah showed signs of weakening later that day, spurring an increase in wind shear and causing weakening. This period of weakening was short-lived, and Hudah resumed its former strengthening trend by the night of March30 as shear decreased and convective organization and <b>areal</b> extent increased. After passing 275km (170mi) north of Rodrigues Island, Hudah attained intense tropical cyclone status by 1200UTC on March31. Satellite imagery indicated a large, cloud-free eye, indicative of a strong tropical cyclone.|$|E

25|$|HDD data {{transfer}} rate depends upon the rotational speed of the platters and the data recording density. Because heat and vibration limit rotational speed, advancing density becomes the main method to improve sequential transfer rates. Higher speeds require a more powerful spindle motor, which creates more heat. While <b>areal</b> density advances by increasing both the number of tracks across the disk {{and the number of}} sectors per track, only the latter increases the {{data transfer}} rate for a given rpm.
