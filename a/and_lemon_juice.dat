25|$|Egg {{emulsion}} sauces include mayonnaise, Hollandaise and Béarnaise. For hollandaise sauce, {{egg yolks}} and water, lemon juice or vinegar are emulsified. Unlike custard, the egg does not coagulate. An emulsion {{is a mixture}} of two or more liquids that are normally immiscible (unmixable or unblendable). Droplets of the butter become suspended in the water <b>and</b> <b>lemon</b> <b>juice</b> once emulsion occurs. While emulsions can be either stable or unstable, hollandaise is made stable by the addition of eggs which contain lecithin, combining with the oil and water, holding it together.|$|E
25|$|By the 19th century, sauces {{had been}} {{classified}} into four distinct categories by Chef Marie-Antoine Carême. One of Carême's family of sauces was allemande, {{which was a}} stock-based sauce using egg <b>and</b> <b>lemon</b> <b>juice.</b> Auguste Escoffier updated that list in the early 20th century by replacing allemande with Hollandaise sauce {{as part of his}} family of five mother sauces of Haute cuisine. While many believe that a true Hollandaise sauce should only contain the basic ingredients of eggs, butter and lemon, Prosper Montagne suggested using either a white wine or vinegar reduction, similar to a Béarnaise sauce, to help improve the taste.|$|E
25|$|Care {{should be}} taken when {{consuming}} oysters. Purists insist on eating them raw, with no dressing save perhaps lemon juice, vinegar (most commonly shallot vinegar), or cocktail sauce. Upscale restaurants pair raw oysters with a home-made Mignonette sauce, which consists primarily of fresh chopped shallot, mixed peppercorn, dry white wine <b>and</b> <b>lemon</b> <b>juice</b> or sherry vinegar. Like fine wine, raw oysters have complex flavors that vary greatly among varieties and regions: salty, briny, buttery, metallic, or even fruity. The texture is soft and fleshy, but crisp on the palate. North American varieties include: Kumamoto and Yaquina Bay from Oregon, Duxbury and Wellfleet from Massachusetts, Malpeque from Prince Edward Island, Canada, Blue Point from Long Island, New York, Pemaquid from Maine, and Cape May oysters from New Jersey. Variations in water salinity, alkalinity, and mineral/nutritional content influence their flavor profile.|$|E

500|$|Levantine cuisine is {{the cooking}} of the Levant (including the Middle Eastern Mediterranean coast, east of Egypt).

500|$|Cookery writer Laura Kelley {{notes that}} the 1774 edition {{was one of the}} first books in English to include a recipe for curry: [...] "To make a currey the Indian way." [...] The recipe calls for two small {{chickens}} to be fried in butter; for ground turmeric, ginger and pepper to be added and the dish to be stewed; and for cream <b>and</b> <b>lemon</b> <b>juice</b> to be added just before serving. Kelley comments that [...] "The dish is very good, but not quite a modern curry. As you can see from the title of my interpreted recipe, the modern dish most like it is an eastern (Kolkata) butter chicken. However, the Hannah Glasse curry recipe lacks a full complement of spices and the varying amounts of tomato sauce now so often used in the dish." ...|$|E

500|$|Curry {{was created}} by the arrival of the British in India in the seventeenth century, {{beginning}} as bowls of spicy sauce used, Lizzie Collingham writes, to add [...] "bite to the rather bland flavours of boiled and roasted meats." [...] The 1758 edition of Hannah Glasse's The Art of Cookery contains what Clarissa Dickson Wright calls a [...] "famous recipe" [...] which describes how [...] "To make a currey the Indian way"; it flavours chicken with onions fried in butter, the chicken being fried with turmeric, ginger and ground pepper, and stewed in its own stock with cream <b>and</b> <b>lemon</b> <b>juice.</b> Dickson Wright comments that she was [...] "a bit sceptical" [...] of this recipe, as it had few of the expected spices, but was [...] "pleasantly surprised by the end result" [...] which had [...] "a very good and interesting flavour".|$|E
500|$|The {{dominant}} tastes in borscht are {{sweet and}} sour. This combination is traditionally obtained by adding beet sour. It {{is made by}} covering sliced beetroots with lukewarm preboiled water and allowing bacteria to ferment some of the sugars present in beetroots into dextran (which gives the liquid a slightly viscous consistency), mannitol, acetic acid and lactic acid. Stale rye bread is often added to hasten the process, but usually omitted in Jewish recipes, as chametz (leavened bread) would make the sour unfit for Passover meals. Sugar, salt <b>and</b> <b>lemon</b> <b>juice</b> may be also added to balance the flavor. After about 2–5 days (or 2–3 weeks without the bread), the deep red, sweet and sour liquid may be strained and is ready to use. It is added to borscht shortly before the soup is done, as prolonged boiling would cause the tart flavor to dissipate. The beet sour is known in Slavic languages as kvas (literally 'sour, acid'; compare kvass) and in Yiddish as [...] (from a Slavic word originally referring to any brine obtained by steeping salted meat or vegetables in water; compare Russian [...] 'pickle juice', Polish [...] 'broth'). Apart from its employment in borscht, it may be also added to prepared horseradish or used as pot roast marinade.|$|E
