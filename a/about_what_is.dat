5|$|Since the , {{there were}} hints that both Sara Sidle and Grissom were {{interested}} in each other romantically. In fact, the show's creators made Sara Sidle while thinking of a future love interest for Grissom, but during the show's first three seasons, Grissom flirted with all the female characters, and when Sara asked him out to dinner, he rejected her, claiming {{that he did not}} know what to do <b>about</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> going on between them.|$|E
5|$|The {{prosperity}} theology {{teaching of}} positive confession stems from its proponents' view of scripture. The Bible {{is seen as}} a faith contract between God and believers; God is understood to be faithful and just, so believers must fulfill their end of the contract to receive God's promises. This leads to a belief in positive confession, the doctrine that believers may claim whatever they desire from God, simply by speaking it. Prosperity theology teaches that the Bible has promised prosperity for believers, so positive confession means that believers are speaking in faith what God has already spoken about them. Positive confession is practiced to bring <b>about</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> already believed in; faith itself is a confession, and speaking it brings it into reality.|$|E

5|$|With {{regards to}} the plot, the {{producers}} wanted to repeat the same style as the previous sixth series and include another story-arc in the seventh. The writers and producers got together to think <b>about</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> to become a big political story that will affect the United Kingdom in twelve to eighteen months time. They decided on using the resurgence of power in Russia {{following the end of}} the Cold War, which the producers felt in subtle ways, is threatening the security of the West. The new storyline would allow the series to return to the world of spying, truth, and who the character should trust. The episode was written by Neil Cross. It was also additionally written by Ben Richards.|$|E
5|$|Alan Brigman was the {{technical}} director and co-producer. He and Mike Woodroffe developed a game creation system, Adventure Graphic Operating System (AGOS) II, which facilitated {{the development of}} Simon the Sorcerer and enabled the team {{to focus on the}} gameplay and story without worrying about {{the technical}} aspects. The system allowed the developers to input text commands on a separate monitor, and the engine could be ported to other platforms. Other features of the engine included translating actions performed by the mouse into text commands (a sentence parser carries them out), the loading of data as-needed, and functions could be implemented by the simple addition of commands. The game was built as a database, which contained tables for rooms and objects. These tables contained animation code and information <b>about</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> supposed to happen. Alan Cox was also involved {{in the development of the}} AGOS engine, which is based on AberMUD.|$|E
5|$|Diagnosis and {{treatment}} cost patients money, and the player can change hospital policy, including {{the amount of}} diagnosis patients require. This can be set to over 100 per cent to force patients to have further unnecessary diagnoses. Other policies include when staff can go on breaks and whether they can leave rooms, and loans can be taken out. From time to time, events such as emergencies (in which patients arrive and must be cured within a time limit or they will die), and epidemics (in which a disease spreads rapidly) occur. During the latter, the player can attempt {{to cover it up}} by curing all affected patients before a health inspector turns up. If the player fails, he or she is fined and must face a damaged reputation, a statistic that shows how well the hospital is doing and affects the flow of patients. VIPs may also occasionally ask to tour the hospital; if impressed, the player is granted a cash bonus, a reputation increase, or both. There is an advisor who keeps the player informed <b>about</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> going on. Rats may infest the hospital, and the player is able to shoot them with the cursor.|$|E

5|$|Upon {{waking up}} again, Wells is {{surprised}} to find no bullet wounds on his body. Scully and Doggett arrive to interrogate Wells, but he is confused <b>about</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> going on. A furious Doggett claims {{that he has been}} accused of murdering his wife, Vicky, and initially believes that Wells is faking his confusion in order to build an insanity defense. However, Doggett shows signs of doubt when he notices Wells' genuine anguish over Vicky's death. Wells is brought into court and he recognizes his father-in-law, Al Cawdry, as the man who shot him. When Wells' next court date is announced to be Thursday, he realizes that he has somehow travelled back to the day before his shooting. When the judge decides to transfer Wells to a different cell, he makes a scene in the court and accuses Cawdry of planning to kill him during the transfer.|$|E
5|$|After {{cancelling}} the self-destruct, {{they find}} the Bynars have uploaded massive amounts of information to the Enterprise computers, but {{they are unable to}} decode it. Realizing that Minuet was purposely created by the Bynars as a distraction, Picard and Riker ask the simulation <b>about</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> going on as the ship nears the orbit of Bynar. Minuet explains that a star near the Bynar homeworld had gone supernova, and the EMP it emitted would knock out their computer systems, effectively killing the Bynars. They had used the Enterprise to upload their computer information for safekeeping and then planned to download it back to the Bynar computers after the threat of the EMP had passed. With Data's help, Picard and Riker successfully download the data, and the Bynars recover. They apologize for their actions, having feared that Starfleet would refuse to help, though Picard notes they only had to ask. As the Enterprise returns to Starbase, Riker returns to the holodeck to thank Minuet but finds that without the Bynar data, the simulation has regressed to the expected norm for the holodeck, and while Minuet still exists, she {{is not the same as}} before. Riker reports to Picard that Minuet is gone.|$|E
5|$|Under the {{supervision}} of Dr. Derek Shepherd (Patrick Dempsey), Lexie works with Mercy West resident Dr. April Kepner (Sarah Drew) on a burglar, and the two get in several disagreements, leading Lexie to steal her diary. Dr. Alex Karev (Justin Chambers) and Adamson continuously argue {{over the course of}} treatment for a patient, leading the patient's daughter to yell at them in disbelief. Angry about the revelation that Percy (who later apologized saying that they can be friends outside the hospital, but not inside) was using her, Stevens accidentally administers the wrong dialysis to a patient, making her an unviable candidate for the kidney transplant she was scheduled to receive. After arguing over surgical cases for the entirety of the day, Yang comes to the realization that she needs a cardiothoracic surgeon to work at the hospital. After being mistreated by Kepner, Lexie begins to mock her <b>about</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> written in her diary, thus ruining her emotionally, but subsequently apologizes. Dr. Arizona Robbins (Jessica Capshaw), Torres' girlfriend, talks to Carlos, and convinces him to accept his daughter's sexuality. Having found out about Stevens' mistake, Dr. Miranda Bailey (Chandra Wilson) reprimands her reports her to the chief of surgery Dr. Richard Webber (James Pickens, Jr.). Webber asks Stevens to come into her office, and he fires her from the staff, noting that Hunt, Shepherd, and Karev had concerns with her coming back to work so early. Stevens departs, writing Karev a Dear John letter, causing him to cry in front of Meredith and Yang.|$|E
