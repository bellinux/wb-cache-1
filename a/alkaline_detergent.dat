50|$|A common {{process of}} hot water {{extraction}} begins with preconditioning. Alkaline agents such as ammonia solution for synthetic carpets, or acidic solution (such as vinegar solution) for woollen carpets, are sprayed into the carpet, then agitated with a grooming brush or an automatic scrubbing machine. Next, a pressurized manual or automatic cleaning tool (known as a wand) passes over the surface to rinse out all pre-conditioner, residue, and particulates. If an <b>alkaline</b> <b>detergent</b> is used on a woollen carpet, use of a mild acetic acid solution will restore neutral fiber pH. The acidic rinse thus neutralizes the alkaline residues, and can contribute to softening cleaned fabrics.|$|E

The objective of this study was to evaluate the analytical sensitivity of legislation-described tests and nonspecific microbial inhibition tests, and to investigate the effect of such substances on microbial growth inhibition and the persistence of detectable residues after 24 / 48 h of refrigeration. Batches of raw milk, free from any contaminant, were divided into aliquots and mixed with different concentrations of formaldehyde, hydrogen peroxide, sodium hypochlorite, chlorine, chlorinated <b>alkaline</b> <b>detergent,</b> or sodium hydroxide. The analytical sensitivity of the official tests was 0. 005 %, 0. 003 %, and 0. 013 % for formaldehyde, hydrogen peroxide, and hypochlorite, respectively.

40|$|In {{the milk}} industry, the {{production}} {{must be stopped}} daily in order to clean the process equipment from deposits that are formed at the inside surface when the products are heat treated. This leads reduced production time since no products can be treated when the equipment are being cleaned. The heat treatment of milk products is necessary {{to ensure that the}} product is safe to consume. When heat treating the milk, certain compounds in the milk become unstable and form a deposit called fouling inside the heating equipment. This fouling layer reduces the heat transfer from the heat equipment to the product that is supposed to be heat treated. In order to remove the fouling deposit cleaning with first alkaline and then acidic detergent are used. It can take up to a few hours before the equipment is cleaned depending on the degree of fouling. The aim of this master’s thesis is to develop a laboratory method for measuring cleaning efficiency of UHT fouling by using cleaning detergents at different temperatures and concentrations. The method was created by looking on how a Cleaning-In-Place process is performed and imitates these steps at a laboratory level, by performing experiments on storage, drying, size and separation of fouling. The cleaning method was evaluated according to repeatability and ability to distinguish cleaning effects of the different cleaning liquids. A cleaning method for dissolution of UHT fouling was achieved where it was possible to detect trends of degree of dissolved fouling when different temperature and concentration of cleaning liquids were used in the sodium hydroxide step. The repeatability of the cleaning method was sufficient to be able to detect the cleaning trends. The cleaning effect trials showed that higher temperature and concentration leads to more fouling dissolved. It was also seen that with higher concentration of <b>alkaline</b> <b>detergent</b> a lower temperature could be used to achieve a similar cleaning compared to lower concentration of <b>alkaline</b> <b>detergent...</b>|$|E

Data suggest that brushing of the bottle did not raise the release of BPA. Claims that used bottles release more BPA than new bottles and that mineral composition of the aqueous food simulant affect release could not be substantiated.

To repress capsular polysaccharide production, bacteria were cultured in medium containing bismuth nitrate and sodium salicylate. Rapid removal of other contaminating bacterial surface components was achieved by mild acidic zwitterionic detergent extraction. After treatment, bacterial cells were more readily lysed in <b>alkaline</b> <b>detergents.</b> The resulting plasmid preparations contained virtually no capsular polysaccharide and relatively small quantities of lipopolysaccharide and protein, yet they produced yields of nucleic acids {{similar to those of}} conventional plasmid preparations. Conventional preparations from encapsulated organisms were largely insoluble and appeared as smears following agarose gel electrophoresis, with indefinite plasmid banding. Plasmids prepared by the new method were highly soluble in conventional buffers and exhibited high-resolution plasmid banding patterns in agarose gels. Plasmids as large as 180 kbp could be isolated and visualized, without apparent nicking, and were readily digested by restriction endonuclease enzymes. The method proved effective with encapsulated or mucoid strains of KiebsieUla pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Acinetobacter anitratus, SalnoneUla typhimurium, and Enterobacter species.

However, currently there is no standard method available for evaluating and comparing cleaning agents for use in cleaning-in-place procedures in the dairy industry under realistic conditions. The present study aims to establish a cleaning-in-place model system {{to evaluate the effectiveness of}} cleaning agents in removal of biofilm derived spores from the surfaces of stainless steel which is the predominant substrate in milking equipment on dairy farms. The system is based on Bacillus subtilis spores surrounded with exopolymeric substances produced by bacteria during biofilm formation. The spores applied on sampling plates were mounted on T-junctions protruding 1. 5 – 11 -times the milk pipe diameter from the main loop to resemble different levels of cleaning difficulty. The cleaning tests were conducted using commercial <b>alkaline</b> <b>detergents</b> and caustic soda at conditions which are relevant to actual farm environment. The spores removal effect was evaluated by comparing the number of viable spores (attached to sampling plates) before and after cleaning. Evaluation of the cleaning and disinfecting effect of cleaning agents towards biofilm derived spores was further performed, which indicates whether spores elimination effect of an agent is due to killing the spores or removing them from the surfaces of dairy equipment. Moreover, it was established that the presence of extracellular matrix is an important factor responsible for high level of cleaning difficulty characteristic for surface attached spores.

The HEPA-filtered air and any accumulated particulates on the spacecraft, ground support equipment, and floor of the humidity-controlled, desiccated clean room surfaces provide low quantities of nutrients to inhabiting microbes (Venkateswaran et al. 2001).

The first phase involved researching the current decontamination methods applied in UK hospital pharmacies, which manipulate cytotoxic drugs. The second phase evaluated practical decontamination methods, and the third phase investigated one intervention aimed at reducing or preventing contamination occurring in an isolator. A questionnaire was sent out to ASU managers in NHS hospital pharmacies to gain information about the disinfection and decontamination procedures and products used. The practical decontamination methods investigated were mechanical removal and degradation by detergents (pH range from 1. 7 - 13. 2) and cleaning agents, and degradation by vaporised hydrogen peroxide. Analytical methods were developed and validated to recover and quantify the amount of cytotoxic marker drug remaining after the decontamination tests carried out in phase two, and to recover and quantify cytotoxic surface contamination from various surfaces in phase three of this work. This composed an attempt to evaluate the effectiveness of a closed-system e. g. PhaSeal® device for fluid-transfer, in reducing contamination produced from the compounding of cytotoxic drugs in an isolator. The detergents and cleaning agents were effective in removing or reducing cytotoxic surface contamination. <b>Alkaline</b> <b>detergents</b> caused degradation of doxorubicin (maximum 81 % at pH 13. 2 after 1 hour exposure); the other detergents tested did not xi x degrade the cytotoxic drugs investigated. Exposure to vaporised hydrogen peroxide (1. 6 g min- 1 for 2 hours) caused the degradation of cyclophosphamide (98. 9 %), 5 -Fluorouracil (29. 3 %), doxorubicin (71. 0 %) and epirubicin (65. 9 %) when exposed in pharmaceutical diluents. The closed-system (PhaSeal®) device was effective in reducing contamination produced in an isolator from the compounding of cytotoxic drugs. The risk posed by handling and manipulation of cytotoxic drugs and products to the operator and the environment may be reduced, if not eliminated by considering additional approaches to the methods already in place.

This technique minimizes the amount of repair of radiation damage before analysis without the necessity of using physical or chemical treatments to inhibit repair and alter the physiological condition of the cells. The yield of DNA strans breaks formed in covalent circular superhelical lambda DNA molecules superinfecting E. coli lysogens was about 4 -fold greater when the cells were irradiated in oxygen than when they were irradiated under nitrogen anoxia. The same yields were obtained in phosphate buffer at 3 degrees and 22 degrees as well as in growth medium at 37 degrees, and the yields were not altered by the polA 1 mutation. When E. coli lysogenic cells superinfected with lambda were irradiated with doses sufficient to introduce at least seven breaks in the phage DNA, the chromosomal DNA and the superinfecting phage DNA sedimented similarly in alkaline sucrose gradients, indicating that both DNAs were broken to a similar extent during irradiation. However, the yield of breaks calculated for chromosomal DNA in similar experiments was greater than the yield calculated from the first break introduced into covalent circular lambda DNA molecules. These apparently contradictory results are explicable either if the initial break in a superhelical molecule occurs with an efficiency different from that for subsequent breaks, or if the pulsed electron radiation produces a high proportion of double-strand breaks...|$|E
40|$|A {{case-control study}} was {{conducted}} to identify specific on-farm risk factors that influence bacteriological quality of bulk tank milk in Prince Edward Island dairy herds. Total aerobic (TAC), preliminary incubation (PIC), laboratory pasteurization (LPC), and coliform (CC) counts were used to assess the bacteriological quality of bulk tank milk. Four case-control groups were defined based on the last 6 results of each test before on farm evaluation. A herd was classified as a TAC, PIC, or CC case when the herd had at least 4 high TAC, PIC, or CC counts out of the last 6 analyses for each test, respectively. For the LPC case group, a herd was required to have at least 3 high results out of the last 6 analyses. Control groups had low counts in the last 6 analyses for each test in the corresponding case group (TAC, PIC, CC, and LPC). The results of the study showed that TAC and PIC were mainly associated with cow and stall hygiene: washing the teats with water, not using teat predip, and dirty teats were risk factors. The LPC and CC were related to equipment hygiene, with high counts being associated with low temperature of the cleaning solution, high water-hardness score, and high alkalinity of <b>alkaline</b> <b>detergent</b> wash. Based on {{the findings of this study}} it can be concluded that TAC, PIC, LPC, and CC counts are of considerable value in identifying practices that could influence milk quality...|$|E
40|$|Users of washer disinfectors {{are advised}} to select {{one of the three}} test soils meeting the {{criteria}} for performance qualification (validation) of washer disinfectors. The draft international standard for washer disinfectors (prEN ISO 15883 part 1) names seven different test soils {{that can be used to}} monitor the cleaning efficacy of washer disinfectors for surgical instruments. Unfortunately, the standard does not provide information on the quality of the different test soils, nor does it give any criteria for the selection of a test soil by the user. In a study performed by the RIVM these test soils were prepared, applied to stainless steel plates and dried, as prescribed in the instructions given in the draft standard. In addition two commercially available instant test soils were included in the evaluation. The contaminated plates were placed in an off-the-shelf table-top washer disinfector and subjected to a number of rinsing and washing processes. The production of one of the test soils proved to be impracticable, while three test soils and the two instant test soils showed little resistance to simple rinsing processes. The three remaining test soils were not removed by rinsing with warm or cold water. A proper cleaning process, which included washing at 60 degrees Centigrade for 5 minutes with an <b>alkaline</b> <b>detergent,</b> was necessary to completely remove these test soils. These three test soils therefore meet the requirements set by the RIVM...|$|E
40|$|Decontamination is a {{combination}} of processes (including cleaning, disinfection and/or sterilization) used to render a reusable item safe for return to the operating theatre. Critical to this process are the prevention of drying and the implementation of an effective washer-disinfector process commonly utilizing enzymatic or <b>alkaline</b> <b>detergents</b> within an automated cycle. At this stage the choice of the main wash chemistry is crucial. A balance must be obtained between the vigorous removal of often dense contamination and the maintenance of surface integrity and instrument function. However, ineffective cleaning of surgical instruments may be a vector for the transmission of hospital acquired infections and assessment of cleaning efficacy is dependent on the minimal level of detection of the analytical method. Currently, following disinfection, instruments are subjected to visual evaluation often using magnifying/illuminated lenses to detect any evidence of residual soiling of damage whereby instruments are reprocessed or discarded. Although this method is clearly both rapid and simple to perform it undoubtedly suffers from serious issues of variability and sensitivity, in addition to being non-quantitative. Whilst this method readily detects the haem pigment in haemoglobin to levels as low as 10 ?g/cm 2, bodily fluids without pigments are more difficult to visualise (REF?). Cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) is both colourless and odourless and {{has been shown to be}} a carrier of prion disease infection. Due to the realisation of these facts, European guidelines ISO EN 15883 and the British Health Technical Memorandum (HTM) 2030 outline two techniques for the further assessment of instrument cleanliness: the Biuret and Ninhydrin test kits. Both require prior swabbing of an instrument surface to obtain a result and are based on colorimetric chemical changes although the methodologies behind these reactions differ. The Biuret technique utilises the reaction of copper ions with peptide bonds under alkaline conditions to form a complex which is then added to bicinchoninic acid (BCA) causing a purple colour change that can be readily visualised. The Ninhydrin test kit uses a reaction of amino acids, peptides and proteins with 1, 2, 3 -indantrione monohydrate followed by a 30 min incubation at 110 ºC, although a Ninhydrin gel kit can also be used requiring incubation at only 57 ºC for 60 min. However, a recent study has shown that both the Biuret and Ninhydrin tests suffer from poor sensitivity, demonstrating a minimum level of detection by 75 % of volunteers of 6. 7 ?g and 9. 25 ?g of protein, respectively, on surgical grade stainless steel tokens 1. The authors suggests that, as a result, large amounts of protein (up to 6. 5 ?g) may remain undetected, therefore seriously underestimating levels of residual contamination. In practice, sensitivity is likely to be reduced further due to the difficulty in swabbing areas of surgical instruments such as teeth and box joints where contamination is likely to be harder to remove for analysis...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT The {{structure}} of the major plant polysacchanides contributing to dietary fiber, their organization within the plant cell wall, and {{the problems associated with}} their analysis are briefly reviewed. <b>Alkaline,</b> acidic, and <b>detergent</b> fractionation methods are described and considered in relation to their specificity. The analysis of pectin, often ignored as a component of dietary fiber, is examined in detail. The sohubility of pectins from a number of common plant foods was determined, indicating that a considerable portion of pectin polyuronide is host to many of the commonly used analytical procedures. Am. J. Clin. Nutr. 31 : S 77 -S 8 h, 1978. Plant cell walls are an organized mixture of polysaccharides-pectin, hemicellulose (xyhans, gahactoglucomannan, glucan), and cellulose-plus lignin and glycoprotein. Apart from pectin, the cell wall polysaccha-rides are insoluble in mild solvents without pretreatment; they are digested to only a lim-ited extent by monogastric animals but ar...|$|R
40|$|An {{extracellular}} alkaline lipase of alkalophilic Pseudomonas pseudoalcaligenes F- 111 was purified to homogeneity. The apparent {{molecular weight}} determined by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was 32, 000, and the isoelectric point was 7. 3. With p-nitrophenyl esters as its substrates, the enzyme shows preference for C 12 acyl and C 14 acyl groups. It was stable in the pH range of 6 to 10, which {{coincides with the}} optimum pH range. Lipases (EC 3. 1. 1. 3, glycerol ester hydrolases) catalyze the hydrolysis of triacylglycerols to glycerol and free fatty acids. They also catalyze the synthesis and transesterification of glyceride (15, 18). Because of their activities in both aqueous and nonaqueous solvent systems (20), it has become evident that lipases have considerable applications in industry and medicine (1, 3). Recently, attention {{has been focused on}} the application of <b>alkaline</b> lipase in <b>detergent</b> formulations. Several <b>alkaline</b> lipases with high levels of activity at alkaline pHs were obtained from various microorganisms, such as Achromobacte...|$|R
