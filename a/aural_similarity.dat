5000|$|A mixed review {{came from}} Slant Magazine, in which music critic Sal Cinquemani called the album [...] "one {{of her most}} sonically consistent". However, finding the album [...] "soulless", {{he noted that the}} <b>aural</b> <b>similarity</b> of the tracks led to the {{production}} sounding [...] "cheap and same-y, lacking the fullness of her best work". He continues, [...] "Mariah is in fine voice throughout the album, {{and there are plenty of}} inspired moments to be found... Which makes it all the more disappointing that the album's final stretch devolves into a mess of old-school Mariah rehashes that should have been left in the past." [...] Entertainment Weekly music critic Leah Greenblatt gave Memoirs of an Imperfect Angel a B, noting that the album neither impresses nor disappoints, but is merely satisfactory: [...] "imperfections are nowhere to be found on Memoirs, but neither are many true revelations." [...] Robert Christgau once again gave the album a [...] "dud" [...] score (...) [...]|$|E
5000|$|According to Sebo, {{the preface}} to Symphosius's riddles 'reveals that within Symphosius' milieu {{there is still a}} {{conception}} of riddles as oral and agonistic' going back to Antique traditions of the symposium. However, the riddles themselves are highly literary: 'in thus removing the Riddle form from its popular context as a guessing game, so to speak, and endowing it with a new autonomy and intertextual sophistication Symphosius [...] "invents" [...] what was later termed the Literary Riddle'. Sebo also argues that the collection is carefully structured as a literary whole, proceeding from the more light-hearted to the more sombre, and drawing together material similar in subject (such as whether the solutions are plants, animals or artefacts), metaphorical themes, or <b>aural</b> <b>similarity</b> of lemmata. She argues that, since the solutions are transmitted with the riddles in the manuscript, they too are to be read as part of the sophisticated literary form of Symphosius's work; and she claims that overall the work meditates on the material world, giving voices to creatures and objects whose perspectives on the world were not ordinarily heard.|$|E
5000|$|In 2000-2002 Demidova {{appeared}} on screen twice, first as Lora Lyons (in Remembering Sherlock Holmes, a Russian TV serial) then as mad Elsa (in Letters to Elsa, a film based on Vladimir Vysotsky's son Arkady's screenplay). In Boris Blank's Death of Tairov (2004) Demidova played Alisa Koonen. [...] "Enchanted by the character, I longed for that role, {{but the film}} proved to be devoid of dramatic scenes, and the script was bizarre, to put it mildly. Nevertheless, I managed to achieve some things: visual and <b>aural</b> <b>similarity,</b> by reproducing her voice and plastics - people who remembered her assured me as much," [...] she later commented. Yuri Lyubimov {{was supposed to be}} cast as Tairov, but fell ill, was hospitalized and Mikhail Kozakov came in, making a disappointing substitution, as far as Demidova was concerned. For the leading role in Kira Muratova's The Tuner (2005) Demidova received the Nika Award and the Golden Eagle Award for the Best Actress, having portrayed a kind of [...] "modern day Ranevskaya," [...] as she put it, a pure and pathetic post-Chekhov character. After two more films - Igor Maslennikov's Russian Money (after Alexander Ostrovsky) where she played Murzavetskaya, and Sergey Kostin's historical documentary Waiting for the Empress (about Maria Fyodorovna, both 2006, - Demidova declared she's lost all interest in being filmed.|$|E
