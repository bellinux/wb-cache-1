Progress through the preimplanta-tion stages can be marked <b>by</b> <b>multiple</b> <b>nuclei</b> in some or all blastomeres, the formation of numerous fragments of vary-ing size and organized in different patterns, and by arrests in development at virtually any stage. Various parameters have been offered as markers of the success of embryo growth and its culmination in implanta-tion. Some of these involve characteristics in the follicles such as size, steroid output, properties of cumulus cells and others. Most involve studies on embryos in vitro, analysing timing of cleavage, blastomere structure, chromosome complement and timing of blastulation. More recently, characteristics {{in the structure of the}} pronuclei or of the ooplasm have been introduced. Certain dysmorphisms i...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we propose a novel message-passing algorithm, the {{so-called}} Action-GDL, as an extension to the generalized distributive law (GDL) to ef¿ciently solve DCOPs. Action-GDL provides a unifying perspective of several dynamic programming DCOP algorithms that are based on GDL, such as DPOP and DCPOP algorithms. We empirically show how Action-GDL using a novel distributed post-processing heuristic can outperform DCPOP, and by extension DPOP, even when the latter uses the best <b>arrangement</b> provided <b>by</b> <b>multiple</b> state-of-the-art heuristics.

40|$|We present two new {{non-parametric}} {{methods for}} quantifying galaxy morphology: the relative {{distribution of the}} galaxy pixel flux values (the Gini coefficient or G) and the second-order moment of the brightest 20 % of the galaxy’s flux (M 20). We test the robustness of G and M 20 to decreasing signal-to-noise and spatial resolution, and find that both measures are reliable to within 10 % at average signal-to-noise per pixel greater than 3 and resolutions better than 1000 pc and 500 pc, respectively. We have measured G and M 20, as well as concentration (C), asymmetry (A), and clumpiness (S) in the rest-frame near-ultraviolet/optical wavelengths for 150 bright local “normal ” Hubble type galaxies (E-Sd) galaxies and 104 0. 05 < z < 0. 25 ultra-luminous infrared galaxies (ULIRGs). We find that most local galaxies follow a tight sequence in G − M 20 − C, where early-types have high G and C and low M 20 and late-type spirals have lower G and C and higher M 20. The majority of ULIRGs lie above the normal galaxy G − M 20 sequence, due to their high G and M 20 values. Their high Gini coefficients arise from very bright nuclei, while the high second-order moments are produced <b>by</b> <b>multiple</b> <b>nuclei</b> and bright tidal tails. All of these features are signatures of recent and on-going mergers and interactions. We also find that in combination with A and S, G {{is more effective than}} C at distinguishing ULIRGs from the “normal ” Hubble-types. Finally, we measure the morphologies of 45 1. 7 < z < 3. 8 galaxies from HST NICMOS observations of the Hubble Deep Field North. We find that many of the z ∼ 2 galaxies possess G and A higher than expected from degraded images of local elliptical and spiral galaxies, and have morphologies more like low-redshift single nucleus ULIRGs. 1...|$|R

50|$|This theory {{states that}} a single {{unicellular}} organism, with <b>multiple</b> <b>nuclei,</b> could have developed internal membrane partitions around each of its nuclei. Many protists such as the ciliates or slime molds can have several nuclei, lending support to this hypothesis. However, the simple presence of <b>multiple</b> <b>nuclei</b> {{is not enough to}} support the theory. <b>Multiple</b> <b>nuclei</b> of ciliates are dissimilar and have clear differentiated functions. The macronucleus serves the organism's needs, whereas the micronucleus is used for sexual reproduction with exchange of genetic material. Slime molds syncitia form from individual amoeboid cells, like syncitial tissues of some multicellular organisms, not the other way round. To be deemed valid, this theory needs a demonstrable example and mechanism of generation of a multicellular organism from a pre-existing syncytium.|$|R

40|$|Ultraluminous {{infrared}} galaxies (ULIRGs) with <b>multiple</b> (> 3) <b>nuclei</b> {{are frequently}} observed.

40|$|We study enumerative {{questions}} on the moduli space M(L) of hyperplane ar-rangements with a given intersection lattice L. Mnëv’s universality theorem suggests that these moduli spaces can be arbitrarily complicated; indeed it is even difficult to compute the dimensionD = dimM(L). EmbeddingM(L) in a product of projective spaces, we study the degree N = degM(L), which {{can be interpreted as}} the number of arrangements inM(L) that pass through D points in general position. For generic arrangementsN can be computed combinatorially and this number also appears {{in the study of the}} Chow variety of zero dimensional cycles.

From a concrete article, it is described the way in which Sarmiento conceives the relationship between readers and the readings in the specific context of a popular library. In the final conclusion, two observations are made: firstly, the selection of readings is not an isolated prescription, but a complex of observations about the presence of books and reading in Latin America, specially in Chile and Argentina. Secondly, the author appeals to the elaboration of a catalog capable to attract the readers. This objective is a priority in his projec...|$|R
