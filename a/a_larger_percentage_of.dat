For this reason, {{during the winter months}} (and the late fall and early spring) it is {{considered}} an aquatic turtle. November through February or March is spent in hibernation {{at the bottom of a}} small, flowing river. The wood turtle may hibernate alone or in large groups. During this period, individuals bury themselves in the thick mud at the bottom of the river and rarely move. During hibernation, it is vulnerable to flash floods. Emergence does not occur until March or sometimes April, months that mark the beginning of its activation period (males are typically more active than females at this time).|$|E
5|$|Low {{back pain}} results in large {{economic}} costs. In the United States, {{it is the}} most common type of pain in adults, responsible for a large number of missed work days, and is the most common musculoskeletal complaint seen in the emergency department. In 1998, it was estimated to be responsible for $90 billion in annual health care costs, with 5% of individuals incurring most (75%) of the costs. Between 1990 and 2001 there was a more than twofold increase in spinal fusion surgeries in the US, despite the fact that there were no changes to the indications for surgery or new evidence of greater usefulness. Further costs occur in the form of lost income and productivity, with low back pain responsible for 40% of all missed work days in the United States. Low back pain causes disability in <b>a</b> <b>larger</b> <b>percentage</b> <b>of</b> the workforce in Canada, Great Britain, the Netherlands and Sweden than in the US or Germany.|$|E

25|$|According {{to former}} {{employee}} Alberto Pelliccione, {{the company began}} as security services provider, offering penetration testing, auditing and other defensive capabilities to clients. Pelliccione states that as malware and other offensive capabilities were developed and accounted for <b>a</b> <b>larger</b> <b>percentage</b> <b>of</b> revenues, the organization pivoted in a more offensive direction and became increasingly compartmentalized. Pelliccione claims fellow employees working on aspects of the same platform – for example, Android exploits and payloads – would not communicate with one another, possibly leading to tensions and strife within the organization.|$|E
25|$|Since {{there are}} {{more men than women}} for a limited number of jobs, more men, in {{absolute}} terms, are excluded from formal employment. Consequently, the ratio of female to male workers increases because women represent <b>a</b> <b>larger</b> <b>percentage</b> <b>of</b> those who work than they represent the entire labor force. Therefore, women would have a relatively higher ratio of female to male workers than its female labor force participation rate may suggest. The sheer size of the male component of the workforce may be sufficient to create a small ratio of female to male workers.|$|E
25|$|By 2004, Peru had a {{far-reaching}} {{social safety}} net that included food programs serving 35 percent of the population, and work programs offering temporary employment to unskilled workers. The Cooperative Fund for Social Development funded projects to construct and improve schools, health clinics, rural roads, water and sanitation systems, and electric grids. Toledo placed food and infrastructure programs under the Ministry for Women and Social Development and urged that municipalities implement decentralization. Social safety-net spending in Peru remained well below the Latin American average under Toledo even as it covered <b>a</b> <b>larger</b> <b>percentage</b> <b>of</b> the population, which means that outlays were insufficient to lift many people up out of poverty.|$|E

25|$|One {{liter of}} ethanol contain 21.1 MJ, a liter of {{methanol}} 15.8 MJ and a liter of gasoline approximately 32.6 MJ. In other words, {{for the same}} energy content as one liter or one gallon of gasoline, one needs 1.6 liters/gallons of ethanol and 2.1 liters/gallons of methanol. The raw energy-per-volume numbers produce misleading fuel consumption numbers however, because alcohol-fueled engines can be made substantially more energy-efficient. <b>A</b> <b>larger</b> <b>percentage</b> <b>of</b> the energy available in a liter of alcohol fuel {{can be converted to}} useful work. This difference in efficiency can partially or totally balance out the energy density difference, depending on the particular engines being compared.|$|E
25|$|There is a {{correlation}} between the geographic distribution of UV radiation (UVR) {{and the distribution of}} skin pigmentation around the world. Areas that have higher amounts of UVR have darker-skinned populations, generally located nearer the equator. Areas that are further away from the equator generally closer to the poles have a lower concentration of UVR, and contain lighter-skinned populations. This is the result of human evolution which contributed to variable melanin content in the skin to adapt to certain environments. <b>A</b> <b>larger</b> <b>percentage</b> <b>of</b> dark skinned people are found in the Southern Hemisphere because latitudinal land mass distribution is disproportionate. The present distribution of skin colour variation does not completely reflect the correlation of intense UVR and dark skin pigmentation due to mass migration and movement of peoples across continents in the recent past.|$|E

25|$|In the 2000 election, the Bloc dropped {{further to}} 38 seats, despite polling <b>a</b> <b>larger</b> <b>percentage</b> <b>of</b> the vote {{than at the}} {{previous}} election. One factor was the forced merger of several major Quebec cities, such as Montreal, Quebec City and Hull/Gatineau. The merger was very unpopular in those areas, resulting in Liberal wins {{in several of the}} merged areas. This was still more than the number of seats the Liberals had won in Quebec. However, the Liberals won several subsequent by-elections during the life of the resulting Parliament, until the Liberals had held the majority of Quebec's seats in the Commons {{for the first time since}} the 1984 federal election. From then to the subsequent election, the Bloc continued to denounce the federal government's interventions in what the Bloc saw as exclusively provincial jurisdictions. The Bloc credits its actions for the uncovering of what has since become the sponsorship scandal.|$|E
25|$|Boa constrictors are ovoviviparous, {{giving birth}} to live young. They {{generally}} breed in the dry season—between April and August—and are polygynous, thus males may mate with multiple females. Half of all females breed in a given year, and <b>a</b> <b>larger</b> <b>percentage</b> <b>of</b> males actively attempt to locate a mate. Due to their polygynous nature, many of these males will be unsuccessful. As such, female boas in inadequate physical condition are unlikely to attempt to mate, or to produce viable young if they do mate. Reproduction in boas is almost exclusively sexual. Males ordinarily have a ZZ pair of sex determining chromosomes, and females a ZW pair. In 2010, a boa constrictor was shown to have reproduced asexually via parthenogenesis. The Colombian Rainbow boa, Epicrates maurus was found to reproduce by facultative parthenogenesis resulting in production of WW female progeny. The WW females were likely produced by terminal automixis (see Figure), a type of parthenogenesis in which two terminal haploid products of meiosis fuse to form a zygote, which then develops into a daughter progeny. This is only the third genetically confirmed case of consecutive virgin births of viable offspring from a single female within any vertebrate lineage.|$|E
25|$|In 2004, Nancy Weiss Malkiel, the Dean of the College, {{implemented}} a grade deflation policy {{to curb the}} number of A-range grades undergraduates received. Malkiel's argument was that an A was beginning to lose its meaning as <b>a</b> <b>larger</b> <b>percentage</b> <b>of</b> the student body received them. While the number of A's has indeed decreased under the policy, many argue that this is hurting Princeton students when they apply to jobs or graduate school. Malkiel has said that she sent pamphlets to inform institutions about the policy so that they consider Princeton students equally, but students argue that Princeton graduates can apply to other institutions that know nothing about it. They argue further that as other schools purposefully inflate their grades, Princeton students' GPAs will look low by comparison. Further, {{studies have shown that}} employers prefer high grades even when they are inflated. The policy remained in place even after Malkiel stepped {{down at the end of}} the 2010–2011 academic term. The policy deflates grades only relative to their previous levels; indeed, as of 2009, or five years after the policy was instituted, the average graduating GPA saw a marginal decrease, from 3.46 to 3.39.|$|E

[...] The motivation for creating and marketing this album directly came in part from the very article Byrne wrote as well as Eno's belief that music fans want more than just the music on an album and prefer collectible deluxe editions as well as the live performances that promote them. A month after releasing the album, Byrne was skeptical of market saturation claiming [...] "I sense {{that a lot of people}} don't know we have a record out" [...] and hoped to counterbalance that ignorance with his tour. He also described the digital music market as [...] "so infinite [...] it's easy for music to get lost out there" [...] and has noted that this business model would not work for performers who are not already established.|$|E
