5|$|Goebel lost a close {{election}} to Republican William S. Taylor. When the General Assembly's session opened on January 2, 1900, {{the election results}} were immediately challenged. With Democrats in control of both houses of the Assembly, the results seemed sure to be reversed. The Assembly was still deliberating on January 30, 1900, when Goebel was shot by an unknown assailant <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>entered</b> <b>the</b> state capitol building. The following day, as Goebel was being treated for his wounds at a local hotel, the General Assembly invalidated enough votes {{to give him the}} election. He was sworn into office from his bed the same day. Three days later Goebel died, never having risen from the bed.|$|E

5|$|Knowing Orlando Chinea, a {{coach who}} had trained some of Cuba's top {{pitchers}} before he defected from Cuba, lived in the area, Jiménez had his son train with Chinea. He attended Braulio Alonso High School in Tampa, Florida. Playing {{on the high school}} baseball team, Fernández was part of the Florida Class 6A state champions in his sophomore and senior seasons. Before his senior year in 2011, the Florida High School Athletic Association ruled that Fernández was ineligible, <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>entered</b> <b>the</b> ninth grade while in Cuba in 2006 and had therefore exhausted his eligibility. MLB's Cincinnati Reds were prepared to sign Fernández as an international free agent to a $1.3 millionsigning bonus. Fernández won an appeal and was declared eligible for his senior year, ending Cincinnati's pursuit. As a senior, Fernández pitched to a 13–1 win–loss record with a 2.35 earned run average (ERA) and 134 strikeouts. He also threw two no-hitters.|$|E
5|$|After Collins told Polite to leave, {{she became}} {{verbally}} abusive {{of the officer}} and Collins arrested her {{on the grounds of}} disturbing the peace. Florine Roberts, the mother of Robert Bandy, a black soldier in the U.S. Army who was also present, observed the incident and asked for Polite's release. The official police report held that the soldier threatened Collins; in the report, Bandy and Mrs. Roberts then attacked Collins. Bandy hit the officer and, while attempting to flee, Collins shot Bandy in the shoulder with his revolver. In an interview with PM, the soldier said that he intervened when the officer pushed Polite. According to Bandy, Collins threw his nightstick at Bandy, which he caught. When Bandy hesitated after Collins asked for its return, Collins shot him. Bandy's wound was superficial, but he was taken to Sydenham Hospital for treatment. Crowds quickly gathered around Bandy <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>entered</b> <b>the</b> hospital, and also around the hotel and police headquarters, where a crowd of 3,000 amassed by 9:00 pm. The crowds combined and grew tense, as rumors that an African-American soldier had been shot soon turned to rumors that an African-American soldier had been killed.|$|E
5|$|Miller {{was given}} the {{responsibility}} of batting in the number three position when Hassett was afflicted by tonsillitis. In the First Test at Johannesburg, Miller scored 21 and then took 5/40 in South Africa's first innings, only his second match on tour, resulting in the home side being forced to follow on and lose by an innings. In the Second Test at Cape Town, he scored 58 and then took 3/54 in the first innings. On the third morning, Miller crashed his car and arrived late to the ground, still putting on his trousers <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>entered</b> <b>the</b> playing field. Despite, this he dismissed Dudley Nourse with his third ball. He was wicketless in the second innings, and took {{only one in the}} Third Test in Durban and did not pass 10 with the bat. Australia won both matches. He returned to the form in the Fourth Test with 84, 33 notout and 3/75 in a high scoring draw. Miller took match figures of 5/66 in the Fifth Test as Australia took the series 4–0. He ended the series with 246runs at 41.00 and 17wickets at 22.94, placing in the top six in the Test averages for bat and ball. During the tour matches, he took match figures of 11/54 against Natal Country Districts and scored a century against Transvaal.|$|E

5|$|Queen Victoria {{assumed the}} title Empress of India in 1876. A durbar (court) {{was held in}} Delhi, India on 1January 1877 to {{proclaim}} her assumption of the title. The queen did not attend personally, but she was represented there by the Viceroy, Lord Lytton. A similar durbar was held on 1January 1903 to celebrate the accession of EdwardVII, who was represented by his brother the Duke of Connaught. In 1911, GeorgeV also held a durbar which {{he and his wife}} Queen Mary attended in person. Since it was deemed inappropriate for a Christian anointing and coronation to take place in a largely non-Christian nation, GeorgeV was not crowned in India; instead, he wore an imperial crown <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>entered</b> <b>the</b> Durbar. Tradition prohibited the removal of the Crown Jewels from the United Kingdom; therefore, a separate crown, known as the Imperial Crown of India, was created for him. The Emperor was enthroned, and the Indian princes paid homage to him. Thereafter, certain political decisions, such as the decision to move the capital from Calcutta to Delhi, were announced at the durbar. The ceremony was not repeated, and the imperial title was abandoned by GeorgeVI in 1948, a year after India gained independence.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{his return}} to Kansas Anderson {{continued}} horse trafficking, but ranchers in the area soon became aware of his operations. In May 1862 Baker issued an arrest warrant for Griffith, whom Anderson helped hide. Some local citizens suspected that the Anderson family was assisting Griffith and traveled to their house to confront William C. Anderson. After hearing their accusations against his sons, he was incensed—he found Baker's involvement particularly infuriating. The next day he traveled to the Council Grove courthouse with a gun, intending to force Baker to withdraw the warrant. <b>As</b> <b>he</b> <b>entered</b> <b>the</b> building he was restrained by a constable and fatally shot by Baker. William Anderson buried his father, and was subsequently arrested for assisting Griffith. However, he was quickly released owing to {{a problem with the}} warrant, and fled to Agnes City, fearing that he would be lynched. There he met Baker, who temporarily placated him by providing a lawyer. Anderson remained in Agnes City until he learned that Baker would not be charged, as the judge's claim of self-defense had been accepted by legal authorities. Anderson was outraged and went to Missouri with his siblings. William and Jim Anderson then traveled southwest of Kansas City, robbing travelers to support themselves.|$|E

25|$|In a paper {{published}} in 1908, Girault vividly described {{an encounter with}} bedbugs in 1907 {{in a hotel room}} in Cincinnati, Ohio. He was reluctant to sleep on the bed after discovering the bedbugs <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>entered</b> <b>the</b> room a little after midnight. He eventually decided to keep the lights on and to lie across the bed without getting under the covers. He slept fitfully, constantly waking up to find bedbugs scurrying away after feeding on him. At 3:30 AM, he eventually gave up and slept on a rocking chair. Despite the discomfort, he systematically described the behaviour and stages of maturity of the bedbugs, the general conditions of the room, and attempted to search for eggs and moultings of the insects.|$|E

He turned around to see Jack Ruby who called him {{by his first name}} and shook his hand; {{he said that he had}} become acquainted with Ruby while he was a reporter for the Dallas Times Herald newspaper. According to Kantor, Ruby asked him if he thought that it would be a good idea for him to close his nightclubs for the next three nights because of the tragedy and Kantor responded with thinking that doing so would be a good idea.|$|E

In 1998, he started entering events in the French Citroën Saxo Trophy series, winning the title in 1999. Guy Fréquelin, Citroën Sport's team principal, would serve as Loeb's mentor <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>entered</b> <b>the</b> Junior World Rally Championship in 2001, becoming the series' first champion by winning five of the six events. The only event he didn't win this year was Rallye Sanremo: for this event, he was elected as a driver for the WRC championship, driving a Citroën Xsara WRC alongside Philippe Bugalski and Jesús Puras. In only his third rally with a World Rally Car, he surprisingly hounded Peugeot tarmac specialist and eventual victor Gilles Panizzi to the finish, and ended up second.|$|E
25|$|Miller and {{his band}} {{appeared}} in two Twentieth Century Fox films. In 1941's Sun Valley Serenade, they were major members of the cast, which also featured comedian Milton Berle, and Dorothy Dandridge with the Nicholas Brothers in the show-stopping song and dance number, Chattanooga Choo Choo. The Miller band returned to Hollywood to film 1942's Orchestra Wives, featuring Jackie Gleason playing a part as the group's bassist, Ben Beck. Miller had an ailment that made laughter extremely painful. Since Jackie Gleason was a comedian, Miller {{had a difficult time}} watching Gleason more than once, because Miller would start laughing. Harry Morgan appears as Cully Anderson, the unrequited love interest of Ann Rutherford's character, Connie Ward. Miller was contracted to do a third movie for Fox, Blind Date, but <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>entered</b> <b>the</b> U.S. Army, this never panned out. The Glenn Miller Story was released in 1953-1954 by Universal-International.|$|E

25|$|Faint bloodstains in {{the main}} hallway of the {{apartment}} indicate {{at least one of}} the victims had been attacked <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>entered</b> <b>the</b> apartment. Authorities later said that the presence of a blood-soaked bath towel and paper towels in the bathroom suggest Rodger had attempted to clean the hallway after each murder. The bodies of Wang and Hong were found in their shared bedroom, whereas Chen's body was found in the bathroom. The positioning of the bodies suggested each victim had entered the apartment separately before being murdered, and that Rodger had made efforts to conceal the bodies of the first two victims by covering them with blankets, towels, and clothing. Police removed a knife, a hammer, and two machetes from the apartment, but they later determined that two knives recovered from a backpack found in Rodger's car were the weapons used to kill the apartment victims.|$|E
25|$|While his teams' {{records and}} {{performance}} had declined since the 1977–78 season, Lemons was not {{thought to be}} {{in danger of losing}} his job <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>entered</b> <b>the</b> 1981–82 season, the first year for new Athletic Director DeLoss Dodds and Lemons' last at Texas. Preseason expectations had Texas posting improvement over the prior season, but the 1981–82 Longhorns were nonetheless not expected to challenge for Southwest Conference supremacy. Texas began the season unranked, only entering the January 12 AP Poll at No. 19 after winning the first ten games of the season. Consecutive double-digit wins over No. 10 and eventual Final Four participant Houston at Hofheinz Pavilion and No. 9 Arkansas in Austin vaulted Texas to No. 7 in the following poll. An 88–71 nationally televised win over South Carolina the following week moved Texas to No. 5 in the AP Poll, the then-highest ranking in program history. Keyed by the performance of 1982 All-American, national rebounding champion, and eventual fifth overall 1982 NBA draft pick LaSalle Thompson and the much-improved sophomore forward Mike Wacker, the Longhorns had started the season with a record of 14–0, then the program's finest season start in the NCAA Tournament era. Two weeks and five losses later, the Longhorns would drop from the polls altogether. The loss of Wacker to a devastating knee injury {{in the first half of}} a 69–59 loss to Baylor, the Longhorns' first defeat of the year, disrupted the team's on-court chemistry and confidence and ultimately derailed the season. Texas would win only two of its final 13 games, finishing the season with a 16–11 overall record.|$|E
