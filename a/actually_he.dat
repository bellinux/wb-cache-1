Mick Pennisi also arrived as a solution to the team's lack of height. The games won by the Energizers were nullified. Red Bull finished 10th and failed to enter the quarterfinals.|$|E
25|$|The {{leader of}} the Transylvanian noblemen who had fled to the Ottoman Empire, Gabriel Bethlen, {{sent a letter to}} Bocskai urging him to rise up against Rudolph, but Bocskai refused. To award Bocskai for his loyalty, Rudolph {{restored}} to him almost all his estates in Transylvania proper on 2July 1604. Bocskai visited Transylvania and realized that the towns and villages had almost completely been destroyed during the previous years. On his way back from Transylvania, on 20September he learnt that Hajdús had seized a letter about his alleged correspondence with the Grand Vizier, Lala Mehmed Pasha, from Gabriel Bethlen. Fearing reprisals, Bocskai hurried to Sólyomkő and pretended that gout had paralysed him. <b>Actually,</b> <b>he</b> ordered his castellans to make preparations for resistance, but one of them revealed Bocskai's plans to Cipriano Concini, the deputy captain of Várad.|$|E
25|$|There {{were many}} heros {{throughout}} the exhausting {{five days of}} play, but with a doubt, the most unsung of them was Greg Matthews, who scored 44 and 27 not out and took five wickets in each innings. His stamina and resilience were absolutely staggering, especially on the last day, when he bowled 39.5 overs just about consecutively to keep us {{in the game and}} then ultimately tie it. Making his feat all the more noteworthy in the eyes of his fellow players was the fact that he wore two sleeveless sweaters throughout the day. <b>Actually,</b> <b>he</b> gave one to the umpire when he fielded and only wore them both when he was bowling. We just shook our heads in disbelief, because it was so hot with 90 degree humidity, but as usual Greg had a theory. He explained that nomadic herders in the desert wore woollen coats because they kept the cool air in, thus acting as a kind of air-conditioner.|$|E

25|$|In {{the early}} hours of 23 March 1935, Rattenbury was {{discovered}} in his sitting room with severe head injuries. He had sustained a series of blows with a carpenter's mallet, the blows savage enough to remove the back of his skull; he died four days later. His wife confessed, but Stoner admitted to the housekeeper that it was <b>actually</b> <b>he</b> who had carried out the deed. Alma Rattenbury and Stoner were both charged, although Alma was to retract her confession after her elder son Christopher visited her in prison. Stoner was convicted and sentenced to death, later commuted to life imprisonment following the submission to the Home Secretary of a petition signed by over 300,000 people who felt that the young man had been manipulated into committing murder by the older woman. Alma, represented by Ewen Montagu, was acquitted of murder and of being an accessory after the fact but committed suicide a few days later on 4 June 1935, stabbing herself six times in the breast with a dagger before throwing herself into the River Stour at Christchurch.|$|E

Sirius sends Harry a Firebolt broom, and Harry happily takes it for a ride.|$|E
25|$|TNT did allow a final Nitro show to {{air from}} Panama City Beach, Florida {{which had been}} {{scheduled}} for the following Monday on March 26. McMahon opened the last-ever episode of WCW Monday Nitro with a simulcast with WWF Monday Night Raw, which aired from Cleveland, Ohio, with a self-praising speech. The final WCW World Heavyweight Championship match for the show and the company saw WCW United States Heavyweight Champion Booker T defeat Scott Steiner to win the WCW World Heavyweight Championship. The main event featured Sting defeating Ric Flair with the Scorpion Deathlock as a culmination of their trademark feud, then both men embraced one another at the match's conclusion. This was a direct parallel to the very first Nitro, where Sting vs. Flair was also the main event. After the Sting/Flair match, Vince appeared on Raw to close Nitro and to declare victory over WCW. Vince's son Shane McMahon then appeared on Nitro, declaring that it was <b>actually</b> <b>he</b> who had bought WCW.

500|$|The Cure {{were one}} of the first {{alternative}} bands to have chart and commercial success in an era before alternative rock had broken into the mainstream.
