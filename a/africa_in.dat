5|$|After 1935, {{the mines}} were reopened {{and there was}} steady growth in the region. According to David M. Gordon, the unrest gave missionaries {{a chance to respond}} to the Watchtower {{movement}} in a coordinated fashion. The London Missionary Society and the Church of Scotland worked together after the strike, saying that the lack of education and religious instruction were contributing factors. The missionaries and the mining companies said that a Christian education would create a disciplined workforce, a belief which was called the spiritual wing of industrial capitalism. The region's Protestant mission established the United Mission of Copperbelt (UMCB), which led to the establishment of Protestant bodies such as the Church of Central <b>Africa</b> <b>in</b> Rhodesia (CCAR) in 1945 and the United Church of Central <b>Africa</b> <b>in</b> Rhodesia in 1958 (which became the United Church of Zambia in 1965).|$|E

5|$|For the 2010 and 2014 World Cups, {{the final}} tournament is rotated between confederations, {{allowing}} only countries from the chosen confederation (<b>Africa</b> <b>in</b> 2010, South America in 2014) to bid {{to host the}} tournament. The rotation policy was introduced after the controversy surrounding Germany's victory over South <b>Africa</b> <b>in</b> the vote to host the 2006 tournament. However, the policy of continental rotation will not continue beyond 2014, so any country, except those belonging to confederations that hosted the two preceding tournaments, can apply as hosts for World Cups starting from 2018. This is partly to avoid a similar scenario to the bidding process for the 2014 tournament, where Brazil was the only official bidder.|$|E
