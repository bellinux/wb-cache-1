25|$|Later, {{after turning}} down {{a job offer}} to join the police, Whirlpool {{changed his name to}} Humphrey James and moved to Tasmania. By 1865, however, he had moved to Sydney. Keeping his {{identity}} secret, he undertook a teachers training course and then began working at a school near Wisemans Ferry. Still plagued by his injuries, and although considered to be <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>teacher,</b> he began drinking heavily and this eventually led to him being dismissed.|$|E
25|$|Although {{the family}} was happy in Lorch, Schiller's father found his work unsatisfying. He {{sometimes}} took his son with him. In Lorch, Schiller received his primary education. The quality of the lessons was fairly bad, and Friedrich regularly cut class with his older sister. Because his parents wanted Schiller to become a pastor, they had the pastor of the village instruct the boy in Latin and Greek. Pastor Moser was <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>teacher,</b> and later Schiller named the cleric in his first play Die Räuber (The Robbers) after him. As a boy, Schiller was excited {{by the idea of}} becoming a cleric and often put on black robes and pretended to preach.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The {{purpose of}} the study was to define {{criteria}} for <b>a</b> <b>good</b> mathematics <b>teacher</b> and examine how well one pre-service elementary teacher fulfilled these criteria during the first two years of her studies. The study was carried out during the academic years 1999 - 2000 and 2000 - 2001 at a Finnish university. The study shows the important role that all elements of one's view of mathematics have in enabling a student to meet the criteria for <b>a</b> <b>good</b> mathematics <b>teacher...</b>|$|R
25|$|In the Indian {{education}} system, a teacher’s {{success is}} loosely defined. It is either {{based on a}} student’s success or based on the years of teaching experience, both of which do not necessarily correlate to a teacher’s skill set or competencies. The management of an institution could thereby be forced to promote teachers based on the grade level they teach or their seniority, {{both of which are}} often not an indicator of <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>teacher.</b> This means that either a primary school teacher is promoted to a higher grade, or a teacher is promoted to take up other roles within the institution such as Head of Department, coordinator, Vice Principal or Principal. However, the skills and competencies that are required for each of them vary and a great teacher may not be a great manager. Since teachers do not see their own growth and success in their own hands, they often do not take up any professional development. Thus, {{there is a need to}} identify a framework to help a teacher chart a career path based on his/her own competency and help him/her understand his/her own development.|$|E
25|$|Arthur Berry... was <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>teacher</b> {{and focus}} for art {{activity}} at the Burslem & Stoke Art School. I do not agree that he is for many the finest 20th century artist from Stoke - there are other candidates also. Mr Berry's work lies somewhere between painting and drawing - for me paint and its properties hold most attraction. Mr Berry's talent was spread over several areas - drawing, painting, writing, plays, poems and teaching. I do not think I am good enough myself to do several things well, so concentrate on one (painting). Mr Berry said he admired Lowry and once encountered him in a Manchester Gallery - said he was built and made for a particular task - as an artist recording the vanishing industrial scene of Manchester....Mr Berry was, I feel, a humorist whose interest was {{the people of the}} old working class of Stoke - a type of person who no longer exists. I mostly liked his landscapes. They seemed to convey that strange Stoke light which appeals to me and the old buildings and streets which were very much part of my own childhood and youth.|$|E

The book offers great, relevant images related to new reflective concrete ideas, and it has a beautiful layout. Waterhouse points out her core argument several places in the text: <b>a</b> <b>good</b> kindergarten <b>teacher</b> is <b>a</b> creative kindergarten teacher – and the book reviewer adds, <b>a</b> <b>good</b> kindergarten <b>teacher</b> is <b>a</b> reading, reflecting kindergarten teacher. </p...|$|R
40|$|The {{present study}} aims to {{investigate}} the elementary, secondary and high school students’ perceptions on <b>a</b> <b>good</b> language <b>teacher.</b> The participants are 365 Turkish school students who are learning English as a foreign language.

In the present study it has been also found that what students expect from <b>a</b> <b>good</b> English <b>teacher</b> is {{to have the ability to}} maintain discipline, motivate students, learn about the learner’ needs and establish good relations with them. The study also reveals striking results with respect to classroom discipline and teacher subject knowledge. </p...|$|R
2500|$|The {{importance}} {{of education and}} study is a fundamental theme of the Analects. For Confucius, a good student respects and learns from the words and deeds of his teacher, and <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>teacher</b> is someone older who {{is familiar with the}} ways of the past and the practices of antiquity (Analects 7.22). Confucius emphasized the need to find balance between formal study and intuitive self-reflection (Analects 2.15). When teaching he is never cited in the Analects as lecturing at length about any subject, but instead challenges his students to discover the truth through asking direct questions, citing passages from the classics, and using analogies (Analects 7.8). He sometimes required his students to demonstrate their understanding of subjects by making intuitive conceptual leaps before accepting their understanding and discussing those subjects at greater levels of depth. (Analects 3.8) ...|$|E

50|$|The phrase <b>a</b> very <b>good</b> <b>teacher</b> is <b>a</b> {{complement}} {{of the sentence}} in (a.), that is, {{it is part of}} the syntax of the sentence; in the framework of discourse grammar, it is therefore classified as belonging to sentence grammar. In (b.), by contrast, the same phrase (but printed in bold) is not part of the syntax; it is syntactically independent from the rest of the sentence, commonly classified as a non-restrictive appositive. And it is also different in other ways: Whereas in (a.) {{it is part of the}} prosody of the sentence, in (b) it is separated from the preceding clause by a tone unit boundary in spoken English and by a comma in written English. And third, there is also a difference in meaning: Whereas the meaning of <b>a</b> very <b>good</b> <b>teacher</b> in (<b>a.)</b> is determined by its syntactic function as a {{complement of}} the sentence, it is fairly independent from the sentence meaning in (b.); the former meaning has therefore been called restrictive and the latter non-restrictive.The phrase <b>a</b> very <b>good</b> <b>teacher</b> in (b) is classified as belonging to thetical grammar, that is, as a thetical. Theticals are defined in the following way: (1) They are syntactically unattached, (2) they are typically set off prosodically from the rest of the utterance, (3) their meaning is non-restrictive, (4) they tend to be positionally mobile, and (5) their internal structure is built on principles of sentence grammar but can be elliptic.|$|R

40|$|A quality teacher’s {{education}} program is rational and streamlined {{to address some}} specific pedagogical issues.
