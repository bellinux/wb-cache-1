25|$|Building on Aston Martin's {{established}} {{road car}} and sports racer template, the chassis of the DBR4 was a conventional spaceframe structure, skinned with aluminium bodywork. Beneath the skin the DBR4's basic design was {{closely related to}} the DB3S sports car of 1956, but with its <b>ancillary</b> <b>components</b> more tightly packaged to enclose them in the smaller, single-seater body. Although some manufacturers had started to use wind-tunnel testing for racing cars, such as the Bristol 450, aerodynamics as a science was still in its infancy where road vehicles were concerned. As a result of this, although the DBR4's bodywork appeared svelte and streamlined, the effect was ruined by the decision to mount a large air intake {{on the side of the}} bonnet, and to install a relatively tall, near-vertical windscreen.|$|E

Alongside minor engine modification, during repair dramatic changes {{were made to the}} styling of the machines. The panelwork was smoothed even further, with the small front wings now completely gone and the roofline raised between the rear fins; the headlamps were set into deeply recessed, [...] conical tunnels; the spotlamps and indicator lights were set into more conventional faired recesses; and the engine air intake bulge was smoothed and tapered. At the same time the car's width was reduced, and cutout ducts were introduced behind the front wheels to improve cooling of the front brakes. All <b>ancillary</b> <b>components</b> were also removed from the airflow, either by fairing or by choosing alternative methods.|$|E

40|$|The AAA-ATPase (ATPase {{associated}} with various cellular activities) p 97 has {{been implicated in}} the degradation of misfolded and unassembled proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum (ERAD). To better understand its role in this process, we used a reconstituted cell-free system to define the precise contribution of p 97 in degrading immature forms of the polytopic, multi-domain protein CFTR (cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator). Although p 97 augmented both the rate {{and the extent of}} CFTR degradation, it was not obligatorily required for ERAD. Only a 50 % decrease in degradation was observed in the complete absence of p 97. Moreover, p 97 specifically stimulated the degradation of CFTR transmembrane (TM) domains but had no effect on isolated cytosolic domains. Consistent with this, p 97 -mediated extraction of intact TM domains was independent of proteolytic cleavage and influenced by TM segment hydrophobicity, indicating that the relative contribution of p 97 is partially determined by substrate stability. Thus, we propose that p 97 functions in ERAD as a nonessential but important <b>ancillary</b> <b>component</b> to the proteasome where it facilitates substrate presentation and increases the degradation rate and efficiency of stable (TM) domains...|$|R

40|$|Agonists of the {{dopamine}} D 1 /D 5 receptors {{that are}} positively coupled to adenylyl cyclase specifically induce a slowly developing long-lasting potentiation {{of the field}} excitatory postsynaptic potential in the CA 1 region of the hippocampus that lasts for > 6 hr. This potentiation is blocked by the specific D 1 /D 5 receptor antagonist SCH 23390 and is occluded by the potentiation induced by cAMP agonists. An agonist of the D 2 receptor, which is negatively coupled to adenylyl cyclase through G alpha i, did not induce potentiation. Although this slow D 1 /D 5 agonist-induced potentiation is partially independent of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors, it seems to share some steps with and is occluded by the late phase of long-term potentiation (LTP) produced by three repeated trains of nerve stimuli applied to the Schaffer collateral pathway. Similarly, the D 1 /D 5 antagonist SCH 23390 attenuates the late phase of the LTP induced by repeated trains, and the D 1 /D 5 agonist-induced potentiation is blocked by the protein synthesis inhibitor anisomycin. These {{results suggest that the}} D 1 /D 5 receptor may be involved in the late, protein synthesis-dependent component of LTP in the hippocampal CA 1 region, either as an <b>ancillary</b> <b>component</b> or as a mediator directly contributing to the late phase...|$|R

40|$|The Fuel Cell {{has been}} used for manned space flight since the Gemini program. Its power output and water {{production}} capability over long durations for the mass and volume are critical for manned space-flight requirements. The alkaline fuel cell used on the Shuttle, while very reliable and capable for it s application, has operational sensitivities, limited life, and an expensive recycle cost.

NASA Glenn Research Center is currently leading a PEM fuel cell development and test program intended to move the technology closer to the point required for manned space-flight consideration.

However, careful SRF cavity preparation and experimental configuration have achieved the ideal Qo not only for low field amplitudes, but up to cavity fields that are typically 75% of the magnetic field quench limit. Few cavities make it to the magnetic field quench limit since residual losses and vanishingly small defects heat up localized spots, which eventually exceed the superconducting critical temperature and lead to a thermal quench.|$|E
