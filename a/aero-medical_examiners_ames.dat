For instance, the most common deficiencies are (1) failure to address items airmen checked “yes” or left blank in blocks 13, 17, 18, or 19 of the examination form, and (2) the history given does not provide the information required by the Guide for Aviation Medical Examiners.

40|$|Authority (ICAO) has {{recently}} required all signatories to the United Nations Charter {{to indicate the}} English language proficiency of all pilots on their pilot certificates.

40|$|Along {{with others}} I have long {{felt the need}} for a {{comprehensive}} approach to the medical certification of aviators. Within AsMA we have physicians involved in many levels of aeromedical certification including establishment of standards, revision of standards in light of technological advances, exceptions to standards (waivers), harmonization of standards, and individual assessment of fitness by the individual aviation medical <b>examiner</b> (<b>AME).</b> To this end, we established an ad hoc AsMA Clinical Aviation Medicine Committee, which had its inaugural meeting in conjunction with our annual scientific meeting in New Orleans this past May. The committee is composed of six international members and one U. S. member. This is a committee that will guide the development of clinical aviation medicine initiatives. I have just returned from two stimulating aviation medicine meetings held overseas. The first was Medicin...|$|R
40|$|Satisfaction Survey are in! A {{total of}} 15, 755 surveys were {{received}} by airmen and 6, 425 were returned, a 41 % response rate. There were many interesting findings in these results {{that we can}} cover another time in this space, but today I {{want to focus on}} only a couple of problem areas. Fifteen per cent of airmen responded “No ” when asked, “Did the aviation medical <b>examiner</b> (<b>AME)</b> with whom you had the appointment review your medical history with you?”; 7 % said the history was reviewed by a non-AME physician, 15 % by a non-physician, and the remaining 79 % said there was no history review. Four per cent of airmen reported their evaluations were not done by the person with whom they had the appointment; of these, 70 % were done by non-physicians, 17 % by a non-AME physician, and 13 % said they were not examined at all.

40|$|Our duties place us in {{situations}} fraught with ethical dilemmas By Susan Northrup, MD This article {{appeared in the}} April 2008 issue of Flight Physician, the newsletter of the Civil Aviation Medical Association, and is reprinted here with permission. Dr. Northrup is the FAA Southern Regional Flight Surgeon, and she is also {{the president of the}} Civil Aviation Medical Association. —Ed. just returned from a trip to Wash-I ington, D. C., with my children and husband. We visited the standard tourist destinations for a family of aviation enthusiasts–the National Air and Space Museum, the Udvar Hazy annex, and the new National Marine Corps Museum. We concluded our trip with visits to Arlington Cemetery and the National Archives. The experience started me thinking about the profession of aviation medicine and our obligations: Are they to the aviator at all cost? Are they to aviation safety? What about our obligations as Aviation Medical <b>Examiners</b> (<b>AMEs)</b> ? To the profession of medicine? How safe is safe enough? Can we “look the other way ” when aviators willfully violate 14 CFR 61. 53 (Prohibition on Operation...|$|R
40|$|Patients {{expect the}} highest {{standards}} of professionalism from us—what does the FAA expect? By G. J. Salazar, MD ETHICS—mention the word and eyes glaze over. As physicians, we hear the word continuously because it forms {{an integral part of}} our profession. Patients expect nothing less than complete ethical behavior from us, and state licensing boards periodically require we be trained in it to continue practicing our profession. Yet the subject is not one we typically discuss as part of aviation medical <b>examiner</b> (<b>AME)</b> designation. It is one of those basic concepts the Federal Aviation Administration assumes physicians understand, yet I am continuously surprised by the complaints received in FAA Regional Medical Offices on the activities of some of our medical peers. A small number of the more interesting ones in this Region have been: issuing FAA medical certificates in a bar; back-dating an exam and certificate to cover a friend involved in an aircraft accident who did not have a current airman medical certificate; performing FAA physical examinations while the AME was a patient in a nursing home; missing a recent sternotomy scar for cardiac bypass surgery because no physical exam was performed; performing FAA physical exams in a storage room {{in the back of the}} spouse’s insurance office.

40|$|The {{bicuspid}} {{aortic valve}} (BAV) {{is the most}} common congenital heart malformation, affecting up to 2 % of the population (1), while the remainder of heart mal-formations total only 0. 8 %. More than 33 % of the affected patients with bicuspid valves will eventually develop complications. Dilatation of the aorta must be closely controlled in the presence of BAV (2) : aortic root replacement surgery is indicated earlier (diameter of 45 - 50 mm) than in those patients with tricuspid aor-tic valves (diameter> 55 mm) (3 - 7). Alternative tech-niques, such as tricuspidization to restore a normal valve function, have been described by Prêtre et al. (8) and Anderson (9). Whilst this technique may offer promise under certain circumstances, long-term results are still lacking. Cardiac surgery is rare in pilots, and even rarer in military pilots. The flight-licensing procedure for the return to duty of a pilot represents a challenge for both the cardiac surgeon and the Aeromedical <b>Examiner</b> (<b>AME),</b> the latter being the only physician competent to determine the flight sta-tus of a pilot. To date, only one case of aortic valve replacement (AVR) in a United States Air Force pilot has been reported (10). Address for correspondence...|$|R
40|$|Background and {{aim of the}} study: Bicuspid {{aortic valve}} {{is the most common}} {{congenital}} heart malformation, and a high percentage of patients with this condition will develop complications over time. It is rare that pilots undergo aortic valve surgery, and the confirmation of flight-licensing requirements after aortic valve replacement (AVR) is a challenge for the patient's cardiac surgeon and, particularly, for the Aeromedical <b>Examiner</b> (<b>AME).</b> Only AMEs are able to determine the flight status of pilots. Furthermore, in military and in civil aviation (e. g., Red Bull Air Race), the high G-load environment experienced by pilots is an exceptional physiological parameter, which must be considered postoperatively. Methods: A review was conducted of the aeronautical, surgical and medical literature, and of European pilot-licensing regulations. Case studies are also reported for two Swiss Air Force pilots. Results: According to European legislation, pilots can return to flight duty from the sixth postoperative month, with the following limitations: that an aortic bioprosthesis presents no restrictions in cardiac function, requires no cardioactive medications, yet requires a flight operation with co-pilot, the avoidance of accelerations over + 3 Gz and, in military aviation, restricts the pilot to non-ejection-seat aircraft. The patient follow up must include both echocardiographic and rhythm assessments every six months. Mechanical prostheses cannot be certified because the required anticoagulation therapy is a disqualifying condition for pilot licensing. Conclusion: Pilot licensing after aortic valve surgery is possible, but with restrictions. The +Gz exposition is of concern in both military and civilian aviation (aerobatics). The choice of bioprosthesis type and size is determinant. Pericardial and stentless valves seem to show better flow characteristics under high-output conditions. Repetitive cardiological controls are mandatory for the early assessment of structural valve disease and rhythm disturbances. A pre-emptive timing is recommended when reoperation is indicated, without waiting for clinical manifestations of structural valve disease...|$|R
40|$|A {{letter report}} {{issued by the}} Government Accountability Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "Aerospace medical experts GAO interviewed generally agreed that the Federal Aviation Administration's (FAA) medical standards are appropriate and supported FAA's recent data-driven efforts to improve its pilot medical-certification process. Each year, about 400, 000 candidates apply for a pilot's medical certificate and complete a medical exam {{to determine whether they}} meet FAA's medical standards. From 2008 through 2012, on average, about 90 percent of applicants have been medically certified by an FAA-designated aviation medical <b>examiner</b> (<b>AME)</b> {{at the time of their}} medical exam or by a Regional Flight Surgeon. Of the remaining applicants, about 8. 5 percent have received a special issuance medical certificate (special issuance) after providing additional medical information to FAA. Approximately 1. 2 percent were not medically certified to fly. According to an industry association, the special issuance process adds time and costs to the application process, in part, because applicants might not understand what additional medical information they need to provide to FAA. Officials from FAA's medical certification division have said that technological problems with the aging computer systems that support the medical certification process have contributed to delays in the special issuance process. FAA's medical certification division has identified about 50 potential technological enhancements to its internal computer systems that support the medical certification process, of which about 20 have been identified as high priority, but the division has not yet implemented them or developed a timeline to do so. By developing a timeline to implement the highest-priority enhancements, FAA would take another step toward expediting the certification process for many applicants hoping to obtain a special issuance. FAA recently established a datadriven process using historic medical and accident data that authorizes AMEs to certify a greater number of applicants with medical conditions who had previously required a special issuance. Officials expect this effort to allow more applicants to be certified at the time of their AME visit and to free resources at FAA to focus on applicants with higher-risk medical conditions. ...|$|R
40|$|It {{has been}} a few months since we made the use of MedXPress {{mandatory}} for all pilots. The transition was fairly smooth, and MedXPress has made the medical application process much more efficient than the old paper system. However, we did experience some “growing pains. ” I {{thought it might be}} helpful to share some of the lessons we have learned, and {{to let you know that}} we are working hard to make this system as efficient and effective as it can possibly be. In January 2013, we received a call from an aviation medical <b>examiner</b> (<b>AME)</b> who said that he had an airman in his office who was completing his MedXPress application using the AME’s computer. The airman was attempting to enter the date of his most recent exam which had been accomplished in January of 2012. However, each time the airman entered the exam date, he got an error message stating that he could not enter a future date for a previous exam. Needless to say, the airman and the AME were very frustrated. It turns out that the AME had installed his computer in 2004 and never updated the system clock. Consequently, the system would not let the airman enter a date that it “thought ” was eight years into the future. Remember to keep your system’s clock up to date — LESSON 1. We received calls stating that the aerospace medical certification subsystem (AMCS) would not retrieve an application when a confirmation number was entered. MedXPress automatically eliminates applications if an airman has not provided the AME with a confirmation number within 60 days of application submission — LESSON 2. Airmen have wished to make corrections to a submitted application, but they discovered they no longer had access. If an airman calls you with this concern, simply tell him or her you can make the corrections in your office. You can revise every item on the applicant’s history page with the exception of block 20 (Applicant’s National Driver Register and Certifying Declarations) — LESSON 3. I understand some AMEs are experiencing printing problems. Some of these problems are resolved as AMEs get more familiar with the system. However, there also appear to be some issues with Adobe Reader, the free PDF Reader application. We are working to simplify the printing process, but in the meantime if you experience any printing problems, you can email us a...|$|R
