Levels are linear but add <b>a</b> <b>more</b> <b>open</b> environment, {{consisting}} of puzzles and first-person shooter game-play. Sequences involving vehicles are interspersed throughout the game, breaking up moments of combat.|$|E

Goh presented <b>a</b> <b>more</b> <b>open</b> and consultative style of leadership as the country continued to modernize.

5|$|With {{the advent}} of new media, pro-PAP views in {{mainstream}} media are countered by websites expressing the views of Internet users which have been omitted from newspapers and television, thus providing additional platforms for expression which are vital in inculcating <b>a</b> <b>more</b> <b>open</b> and democratic society.|$|E
5|$|On April 9, 2007, {{the show}} debuted a new set. The {{projection}} screens were revamped (with one large screen behind Stewart, while the smaller one behind the interview subject remained the same), a large, global map directly behind Stewart, <b>a</b> <b>more</b> <b>open</b> studio floor, and a J-shaped desk supported {{at one end}} by a globe. The intro was also updated; the graphics, display names, dates, and logos were all changed.|$|E

5|$|The {{developers}} redesigned {{the game}} engine, {{the software that}} handles rendering and much of gameplay. Bungie hired an expert in motion capture to develop more realistic character animations. Building a motion capture studio in-house saved Bungie time as motion capture data {{could be applied to}} the game models the same day it was shot. The developers sought to increase replay value by focusing on improving artificial intelligence. Rather than scripting enemy encounters, they focused on <b>a</b> <b>more</b> <b>open</b> world or sandbox approach to battles.|$|E
5|$|The game is {{presented}} from a third-person perspective, with a primary focus on Batman's melee combat, stealth abilities, detective skills, and gadgets. Arkham Knight also introduces the Batmobile as a playable vehicle, {{which is used}} for transportation, puzzle solving and combat. The game expands Batman's arsenal of gadgets and combat attacks and offers <b>a</b> <b>more</b> <b>open</b> world structure than previous titles in the series, allowing the player to complete side missions away from the primary storyline.|$|E
5|$|VT149 heads southeastward {{away from}} the built up village of Granville into a more rural region of the Rutland County town of Pawlet, {{paralleling}} the Mettawee River as it progresses onward. It heads past homes and through a dense forest as it intersects with Bull Frog Hollow Road just after the border. After Bull Frog Hollow Road, the route proceeds eastward through an area dominated by quarries. VT149 continues on, entering <b>a</b> <b>more</b> <b>open</b> area and passing only a few homes before ending at an intersection with VT30 in Blossom Corners, a small, largely unpopulated community within the town of Pawlet.|$|E

5|$|In 2009, a fan-made mod called The Nameless Mod (TNM) was {{released}} by Off Topic Productions. The game's protagonist is a user of an Internet forum, with digital places represented as physical locations. The mod offers roughly {{the same amount of}} gameplay as Deus Ex and adds several new features to the game, with <b>a</b> <b>more</b> <b>open</b> world structure than Deus Ex and new weapons such as the player character's fists. The mod was developed over 7 years and has thousands of lines of recorded dialogue and two different parallel story arcs. Upon its release, TNM earned a 9/10 overall from PCPowerPlay magazine. In ModDB's 2009 Mod of the Year awards, The Nameless Mod won the Editor's Choice award for Best Singleplayer Mod.|$|E
5|$|T. oreades has a swollen woody base largely {{under the}} soil {{known as a}} lignotuber, which stores energy and {{nutrients}} {{as a resource for}} rapid growth after a bushfire. The wet forests in which it grows seldom catch fire. When they do, the plant community becomes <b>a</b> <b>more</b> <b>open</b> sclerophyll woodland until slow-growing plants with larger leaves take over. New shoots grow from the lignotuber, which survives bushfire {{as the rest of the}} plant above ground is burnt. The seed also germinates and grows in post-bushfire soil, which is higher in nutrients and more open with fewer competing plant species. Waratah seeds are often eaten—and destroyed—by animals and do not travel far (several metres) from the parent plants.|$|E
5|$|The Fujiwhara {{interaction}} had {{a significant}} impact on the track of Humberto, which made a quick turn to the northwest, and then to the north-northwest, early on August 25. The interaction came to an end that afternoon as Humberto completed the northerly turn, while remaining a Category2 hurricane in the tropical waters of the central Atlantic. It began to gradually weaken on August 26 due to an increase in southwesterly shear from a nearby upper-level low as it maintained a north-northwest track. The slow weakening trend continued into August 27 as the eye became intermittent in the moderate-shear environment, which was once again affected by the outflow of Iris to the southwest. That evening, it dropped to a minimal hurricane with 75mph (120km/h) winds, which was later confirmed to have been the low point. Operationally, Humberto was downgraded to a tropical storm for a while on August 28, but was later confirmed to have been underestimated. As it tracked away from Iris and into <b>a</b> <b>more</b> <b>open</b> environment, it turned more to the north-northeast and slowly re-intensified again on August 29. Its movement was now affected by an incoming mid-latitude trough that turned Humberto northeast early on August 30. Humberto reached its second intensity peak of 90mph (145km/h) at that time.|$|E

5|$|Müller {{was named}} in Germany's {{provisional}} 27-man squad for the 2010 FIFA World Cup along with seven other Bayern Munich players. Despite suffering a scare {{when he fell}} off his bicycle at the team's training camp in South Tyrol, Müller only received superficial injuries and made the final cut for the tournament when the squad was reduced to 23 players. He was allocated the number 13, normally worn by injured captain Michael Ballack, and previously worn by Müller's eponym Gerd. He earned his second international cap in the final warm-up match before the World Cup when he came on as a half-time substitute for Piotr Trochowski in a 3–1 win over Bosnia and Herzegovina. He started {{the first game of}} Germany's World Cup campaign and scored the third goal – his first internationally – in a 4–0 win over Australia, winning Germany's goal of the month award in the process. He played in all Germany's group games, as they finished top of Group D; he scored twice and assisted once in the 4–1 victory over England in the round of 16. In the third minute of Germany's 4–0 quarter final win against Argentina, he opened the scoring with his fourth tournament goal. However, he picked up his second booking of the tournament in the first half, for a handball and was suspended for the semi-final defeat against Spain. Müller said that he felt far more nervous during the Spain game than any he was able to play. He returned to the team for the third-place playoff against Uruguay and scored the first goal, his fifth of the tournament, as Germany won 3–2 to take the bronze medals. The team's success was a culmination of a series of changes made after the national team's failure at Euro 2000. The Germans emphasized <b>a</b> <b>more</b> <b>open,</b> attack-minded style not previously associated with Germany, and included prominent young players, including Müller, Sami Khedira and Mesut Özil.|$|E
