5|$|In {{addition}} to the Soyuz and Progress spacecraft, after the final crew had left, Salyut 6 was visited by an experimental transport logistics spacecraft called Kosmos 1267 in 1982. The transport logistics spacecraft, known as the TKS, was originally designed for the <b>Almaz</b> programme, and proved that large modules could dock automatically with space stations, a major step toward the construction of multimodular stations such as Mir and the International Space Station.|$|E
5|$|The {{launch of}} Soyuz TM-8 on 5 September 1989 marked the {{beginning}} of the longest human presence in space, until 23 October 2010, when this record was surpassed by the ISS. It also {{marked the beginning}} of Mir's second expansion. The Kvant-2 and Kristall modules were now ready for launch. Alexander Viktorenko and Aleksandr Serebrov docked with Mir and brought the station out of its five-month hibernation. On 29 September the cosmonauts installed equipment in the docking system in preparation for the arrival of Kvant-2, the first of the 20tonne add-on modules based on the TKS spacecraft from the <b>Almaz</b> programme.|$|E

25|$|The ISS follows Salyut and <b>Almaz</b> series, Skylab, and Mir as the 11th {{space station}} launched, as the Genesis prototypes were never {{intended}} to be manned. Other examples of modular station projects include the Soviet/Russian Mir and the planned Russian OPSEK and Chinese space station. First generation space stations, such as early Salyuts and NASA's Skylab were not designed for re-supply. Generally, each crew had to depart the station to free the only docking port for the next crew to arrive, Skylab {{had more than one}} docking port but was not designed for resupply. Salyut 6 and 7 had more than one docking port and were designed to be resupplied routinely during crewed operation.|$|E
25|$|In 1970, the Soviet {{space program}} re-oriented from lunar travel to orbital stations. In February 1970, Kamanin {{estimated}} first <b>Almaz</b> (Chelomei) or DOS-7K (Mishin) {{to be ready}} in summer 1971, at best. Selection of cosmonauts for the first orbital station, again, became a tug of war between Mishin and Kamanin, while the Air Force continued recruitment of new military pilots like Vladimir Dzhanibekov. 19 May - 19 June, Kamanin conducted the usual flight preparation and flight control sequence of Soyuz 9; health problems of cosmonauts returning from an 18-day mission caused a major redesign of future flight programs and another clash with Mishin (Mishin insisted on 30-days flights, Kamanin set {{for no more than}} 24 days).|$|E

His successor, Vasily Mishin, backed by Mstislav Keldysh, {{started his own}} {{political}} campaign, targeted at capturing cosmonaut training facilities from the Air Force - which forever alienated Kamanin. In particular, Mishin promoted his own candidates into the space program; Kamanin deemed them inadequately trained to fly and insisted on Air Force candidates with a proven flight record. For some time, the future Soyuz missions had two competing crews - Air Force and OKB-1,. Kamanin's cosmonauts were also assigned to the future <b>Almaz,</b> Spiral and two competing lunar projects. Probably as a reaction against Mishin, Kamanin rated Vladimir Chelomei and his staff very high, and his products - superior to Mishin's.|$|E
25|$|On February 20, 2016 Infeld {{finished}} third in the Millrose Games women's indoor 5000 meters in 15:00.91, behind Betsy Saina and Molly Huddle. Emily Infeld placed second in the 10,000 m behind Molly Huddle at the 2016 United States Olympic Trials (track and field) to qualify for Athletics at the 2016 Summer Olympics with Marielle Hall. In the Olympics 10000 m event she placed 11th in 31:26.94. The weather conditions were ideal for a fast race, where at least the top 6 competitors performed close to their best expectations that day, and many personal records were set including a World Record of 29:17 by <b>Almaz</b> Ayana. The Olympics USA team was spread apart by more than 2 minutes. Infeld's fellow team member, Molly Huddle, was well ahead and had one of her best performances establishing a PR of 30:13 and placing 6th. Marielle Hall was far behind in 32:39 for 33rd.|$|E
25|$|The Uzlovoy Module (UM), or Node Module is a 4-metric-ton ball-shaped module {{that will}} allow docking of two {{scientific}} and power modules during {{the final stage of}} the station assembly, and provide the Russian segment additional docking ports to receive Soyuz MS and Progress MS spacecraft. UM is due to be launched in late 2018. It will be integrated with a special version of the Progress cargo ship and launched by a standard Soyuz rocket. Progress would use its own propulsion and flight control system to deliver and dock the Node Module to the nadir (Earth-facing) docking port of the Nauka MLM/FGB-2 module. One port is equipped with an active hybrid docking port, which enables docking with the MLM module. The remaining five ports are passive hybrids, enabling docking of Soyuz and Progress vehicles, as well as heavier modules and future spacecraft with modified docking systems. The node module was conceived to serve as the only permanent element of the future Russian successor to the ISS, OPSEK. Equipped with six docking ports, the Node Module would serve as a single permanent core of the future station with all other modules coming and going as their life span and mission required. This would be a progression beyond the ISS and Russia's modular Mir space station, which are in turn more advanced than early monolithic first generation stations such as Skylab, and early Salyut and <b>Almaz</b> stations.|$|E

500|$|It was {{originally}} planned that the ports would connect to [...] modules {{derived from the}} Soyuz spacecraft. These modules would have used a Soyuz propulsion module, as in Soyuz and Progress, and the descent and orbital modules would have been replaced with a long laboratory module. Following a February 1979 governmental resolution, the programme was consolidated with Vladimir Chelomei's manned <b>Almaz</b> military space station programme. The docking ports were reinforced to accommodate [...] space station modules based on the TKS spacecraft. NPO Energia {{was responsible for the}} overall space station, with work subcontracted to KB Salyut, due to ongoing work on the Energia rocket and Salyut 7, Soyuz-T, and Progress spacecraft. KB Salyut began work in 1979, and drawings were released in 1982 and 1983. New systems incorporated into the station included the Salyut 5B digital flight control computer and gyrodyne flywheels (taken from <b>Almaz),</b> Kurs automatic rendezvous system, Luch satellite communications system, Elektron oxygen generators, and Vozdukh carbon dioxide scrubbers.|$|E

Similar to the 2015 World Championships, all three USA team members (this time Infeld, Huddle, and Sisson) were within seconds of one another. The first 2k of the race was slow (6:48 for the leader where 1k was 3:30 for the leader), and it wasn't until after 3k-4k with <b>Almaz</b> Ayana making a decisive move where the large pack of runners started break up. Molly Huddle was leading the USA team for the first 7-8k, while Infeld showed greater strength particularly in last 1k in an attempt to overcome the local pack of other competitors {{just in front of the}} USA team. Infeld succeeded, falling just short of only one of those competitors in the local pack, Susan Krumins, who also surpassed Infeld at the end in the Huesden Belgium 5000 m. The remaining runners had a significant lead ahead of the local pack starting at 6k, which included <b>Almaz</b> Ayana who lapped all competitors except the three who placed behind her.. Emily's first 5k was 16:08 and her last 5k was 15:12, showing significant potential for another PR in the future.|$|E

This is the longest continuous human presence in low Earth orbit, having surpassed the previous record of [...] held by Mir. The station is serviced {{by a variety of}} visiting spacecraft: the Russian Soyuz and Progress, the American Dragon and Cygnus, the Japanese H-II Transfer Vehicle, and formerly the Space Shuttle and the European Automated Transfer Vehicle. It has been visited by astronauts, cosmonauts and space tourists from 17 different nations.|$|E
2500|$|On {{the first}} day, the first gold medal was won by <b>Almaz</b> Ayana of Ethiopia, who broke a long-standing {{world record in}} the women's 10,000 metres by almost fifteen seconds. The race {{as a whole was}} {{historically}} fast, setting four of the five fastest times ever for the distance and seeing eight national records broken. China's Wang Zhen was the first male winner of the 2016 Olympic athletics, topping the 20 kilometres race walk podium. With her final throw of the event, Michelle Carter won the United States' first ever title in the women's shot put, preventing Valerie Adams from winning a third straight title. The first half of the heptathlon saw two athletes set a world heptathlon best: Belgium's Nafissatou Thiam and Great Britain's Katarina Johnson-Thompson both cleared [...] for the high jump. (Their marks would have been sufficient for the individual high jump gold.) ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{morning of}} the {{penultimate}} day began with two racewalking finals. In the men's 50km walk Matej Tóth overtook defending champion Jarred Tallent to win Slovakia's first Olympic gold in athletics while Liu Hong returned China {{to the top of}} the women's 20km walk podium. Ekaterini Stefanidi of Greece won the women's pole vault after the pre-event favourites faltered. Dilshod Nazarov made history in the men's hammer throw by becoming Tajikistan's first Olympic gold medallist. Vivian Cheruiyot achieved a first for her country in the women's 5000metres by outrunning 10,000m champion <b>Almaz</b> Ayana to take Kenya's first ever gold in the distance event. In that race, Cheruiyot set the last of eight Olympic records in Rio. The 4 × 100m finals delivered new highs for Olympic athletics. The American women overcame their qualification troubles by winning from lane one, making Allyson Felix the most successful female Olympian in athletics at five gold medals. Usain Bolt anchored the Jamaican men to the gold to complete a set of three consecutive victories across the 100m, 200m and relay (referred to as a [...] "treble treble"). Bolt equalled Carl Lewis and Paavo Nurmi's record of nine Olympic gold medals in athletics.|$|E
2500|$|In {{perhaps the}} {{greatest}} 10,000 metres race of all time, Dibaba ran the fourth fastest time in history while winning the bronze medal. Her finish time of 29:42.56 was 12.1 seconds faster than her previous personal best of 29:54.66, which she set at the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing. Teammate <b>Almaz</b> Ayana smashed Wang Junxia's 22 year old (and controversial) world record (29:31.78) by 14.33 seconds {{on her way to}} the gold medal in a time of 29:17.45. Silver medalist Vivian Cheruiyot of Kenya came within 0.75 seconds of Wang's world record while running the third fastest time (29:32.53) in history. Fourth place finisher Alice Aprot Nawowuna of Kenya ran the fifth fastest time (29:53.51) in history. (She led the race for the first 5000 metres, reaching that mark in a very quick 14:46.81.) The next 9 finishers each set an area record (Molly Huddle of the U.S.), a national record (Cheruiyot of Kenya, Sarah Lahti of Sweden, Diane Nukuri of Burundi), or a personal best. National records for Greece, Kyrgyzstan, and Uzbekistan also were broken. Before this race, a woman had finished a 10,000 metres race in under 30 minutes only five times - but four did so in this race. Dibaba said after the race, [...] "I had a short time after delivery.
