50|$|The Intermediate Disturbance Hypothesis (IDH) {{suggests}} that local species diversity is maximized when ecological disturbance is neither too rare nor too frequent. At {{high levels of}} disturbance, due to frequent forest fires or human impacts like deforestation, all species {{are at risk of}} going extinct. According to IDH theory, at intermediate levels of disturbance, diversity is thus maximized because species that thrive at both early and late successional stages can coexist. IDH is a nonequilibrium model used to describe the relationship between disturbance and species diversity. IDH is based on the following premises: First, ecological disturbances have major effects on species richness within the <b>area</b> <b>of</b> <b>disturbance.</b> Second, interspecific competition results from one species driving a competitor to extinction and becoming dominant in the ecosystem. Third, moderate ecological scale disturbances prevent interspecific competition.|$|E

50|$|The {{origins of}} Kai-tak can be tracked {{back to the}} broad <b>area</b> <b>of</b> <b>disturbance</b> {{embedded}} in a monsoonal trough that was first spotted, early on August 10. By the next day, the convection deepened and a weak low-level circulation center was spotted with winds of up to 20 kn. A Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission pass revealed that the convection around the system was very loosely organised and the banding was relatively weak. By midnight, that day, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) started tracking {{the system as a}} weak Tropical Depression with winds under 30 knots. A couple of hours later, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) issued a Tropical cyclone formation alert (TCFA) estimating winds of up to 22 kn. As the storm was also in the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA)'s area of Responsibility, they started issuing advisories on the system, thus naming it Helen. By noon, on August 12, the JMA confirmed that the depression has reached a windpseed of 30 kn. As opposed to this, in their first advisory on the system, the JTWC said that the storm had winds of up to 25 knots only. Only late that night, did the JTWC confirm winds of 30 knots, based on new microwave imagery and satellite data. The storm was moving to the west at 12 kn at the moment. At midnight, the JMA reported winds of 35 kn, stating that the depression had intensified into a tropical storm, thus officially naming it Kai-tak. At 09:00 UTC, on August 13, the JTWC confirmed the same. At that time, the system had a broad, partially exposed low-level circulation center (LLCC) with deep convection persisting along the western periphery. Later the same day, according to JMA, the storm reached a maximum sustained windspeed of 50 kn, thus making it a Severe Tropical Storm.|$|E

Three interferograms of laser interaction with a single pulse of Nd:YAG laser were captured by three CCD cameras simultaneously, with dye laser as a flash illuminator. An appropriate algorithm utilizing intensity distributions, matched pixel to pixel was able to reduce the problem. It was found that the maximum phase change was (2. 5 ÃÂ± 0. 1) rad for an interaction of a 3 mJ Nd:YAG laser pulse at a delay of 3. 6 ÃÂµs.

Further support for this observation was provided by the results of a discriminant function analysis, which found that the amount <b>of</b> open <b>area</b> could be used to discriminate between samples that were devoid of nests and samples that contained nests. It is suggested that orang utan may favour these areas as nest sites because of the increased predator/conspecific detection and outlook ability that may be associated with this type of microhabitat.

40|$|A new {{calculation}} of the Ecological Footprint (EF) of a water provider addresses limitations in the previous methodology by regionalising a previously national input-output model, and determining the <b>area</b> <b>of</b> <b>disturbance</b> caused by environmental toxicants not considered in the traditional EF model. In a first step, the regional input-output model determines indirect effects of water services activities {{in the form of}} point sources of pollutants. Accuracy is improved by hybridisation using Âprocess dataÂ to account for the direct environmental burden of the water service. The accuracy of the input-output model is improved by reconciling data sources; calibrating concordance tables and employing optimisation techniques to deal with conflicting data sources. The second step involves a nested fate model, which follows the fate of the point source emissions at several spatial scales. The final output provides an indication of the direct and indirect burden connected with the water business, throughout its entire upstream supply chains. This proposed EF methodology improves on previous EF methodologies by avoiding exclusive reliance on national average data, and by including toxicants in a disturbance-based calculation analogous to the established inclusion of greenhouse gases in EF, making it more comprehensive. It is hoped that the additional detail and comprehensiveness will make the new method a more effective environmental reporting and communications tool for the Australian water industry. This generic approach to environmental reporting may potentially be applied to other economic activities...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{the project}} was to compare the {{performance}} and the costs of alternative tillage systems and machinery, in both energy and economic terms. To determine the energy requirements of tillage implements, experimentation in field conditions and controlled laboratory was conducted. Costs of alternative implements and complete systems were analysed. The field experiment was undertaken to determine the performance of tillage implements in real conditions. Draught force and <b>area</b> <b>of</b> <b>disturbance</b> of the implements were measured and specific resistance calculated. The implements involved in the experiment were 4 furrow mouldboard plough, 3 furrow disc plough, disc harrow and 7 winged tines. The mouldboard plough was operating at two different depths. Two tractors were used for execution of the implement and the wheel slip was measured. The soil bin studies were conducted in additional evaluation of the implements. The laboratory conditions ensure the uniformity of each test. The experiment was carried out to determine draught force, <b>area</b> <b>of</b> <b>disturbance</b> and specific resistance. The experiment involved single furrow mouldboard plough, disc plough, disc harrow and winged tines. Winged tines were made up of four different wing widths. Finally, an economic cost calculator was developed to compare the costs of different implements and tillage systems. Technical parameters and current prices of the implements were obtained from the manufacturers. The results from the field experiment show that there is a similar draught force per unit implement for mouldboard and disc ploughs, while draught force of mouldboard plough is significantly higher. The tillage efficiency of all implements is similar, with a mean of specific resistance of 58 kN/m 2 and a range of 15 kN/m 2. In the soil bin the vertical force preventing penetration occurred for disc plough and disc harrow. The specific resistance of the mouldboard plough had the lowest value, while the specific resistance of disc plough was higher by a factor of 1. 65. By increasing the wing width of the tines the draught force was increased but the specific resistance decreased. Comparing the costs of complete tillage systems it was observed that minimum tillage decreases the operational cost per hectare by 30 % compared to a conventional system based on ploughing. Direct drilling is the cheapest way to establish a crop, but if herbicide has to be applied the cost per hectare {{is similar to that of}} minimum tillage. The costs of different sizes (102, 162, 224 kW tractors) of alternative tillage systems are similar. Namely the cost of mouldboard plough is Â£ 80. 33 /ha with a range of Â£ + 2. 48 /- 1. 93 /ha, the cost of shallow mouldboard plough is Â£ 68. 85 /ha with a range of Â£ + 2. 02 /- 1. 64 /ha, the cost of stubble cultivator is Â£ 42. 05 /ha with a range of Â£ + 2. 02 /- 1. 27 /ha, the cost of direct drill is Â£ 20. 76 /ha with a range of Â£ + 0. 89 /- 0. 75 /ha and the cost of direct drill with herbicide application is Â£ 43. 15 /ha with a range of Â£ + 0. 41 /- 0. 53 /ha...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the latest surface heat flow {{map of the}} continental United States and analyzes the distribution of known extensional geothermal systems in the western US with respect to background heat flow (heat flow outside the <b>area</b> <b>of</b> <b>disturbance</b> associated with a convecting system). The heat flow map is {{an updated version of}} the DNAG Geothermal Map of North America (Blackwell and Steele, 1992). The update adds a number heat flow measurements to the original map for the central and western US. The overall heat flow picture has not changed from the 1992 map, but the additional data have improved contour detail in some areas (particularly the southwest US) as well as increased confidence in the contouring in other areas. The map is sufficiently detailed and accurate {{to be used as a}} basic data source for further studies. The density of high temperature (> 150 Â°C), extensional geothermal systems, increases rapidly with heat flow. While not unexpected, the fit of the curve suggests that sampling of known geothermal systems is unbiased to any significant degree in all but the highest heat flow regions. Reservoir temperatures of known geothermal systems fall off rapidly in areas with heat flow less than 80 mW/m 2. For typical thermal conductivity and assuming reservoir temperature equals geochemical system temperature, the depth of circulation of most Basin and Range systems is less than 5 km. Taken together, the data suggest that there is little value to exploration for extensional geothermal systems in areas with less then 80 mW/m 2 background heat flow...|$|E
40|$|Rocks of White River (Oligocene) age {{have been}} known {{for many years to}} {{constitute}} numerous isolated buttes and mesas in the northwest corner of South Dakota, but no detailed study of their character and structural relations had been made until 1911, when, during an examination of the lignite area of that country, the writer had occasion to study the relation of the younger rocks to those containing lignite beds. Todd, in 1895, recognized the White River formation in the Slim Buttes and called attention to the area in the following language: 3. Miocene beds, both White River and Loup Fork, with characteristic fossils, have been found overlying wide areas of the Laramie north of the Black Hills, covering quite deeply most of Harding County, with thin outliers over the north half of Butte County and south half of Ewing. In the Short Pine hills and Slim Buttes these deposits exhibit a depth of 200 to 400 feet with characteristic fossil features closely resembling those of the White River region. 4. An <b>area</b> <b>of</b> <b>disturbance</b> was found in the north half of Slim Buttes in northeast Harding County covering perhaps 20 to 25 square miles. This consists of sharp folds, including the Laramie and White River beds, with throws of perhaps 100 feet and dips of 25 degrees.

40|$|L Lake was {{developed}} as a cooling water reservoir for the L Reactor at the Savannah River Site. The construction of the lake, {{which began in the}} fall of 1984, altered the structure and function of Steel Creek. Completed in the fall of 1985, L Lake has a capacity of 31 million cubic meters and a normal pool of 58 meters. When L Reactor operations ceased in 1988, the water level in the lake still had to be maintained. Site managers are currently trying to determine the feasibility of draining or drawing down the lake in order to save tax dollars. In order to understand the full repercussions of such an undertaking, it was necessary to compile a comprehensive inventory of what the lake bottom looked like prior to filling. Aerial photographs, acquired nine days before the filling of the lake began, were scanned and used for softcopy photogrammetry processing. A one-meter digital elevation model was generated and a digital orthophoto mosaic was created as the base map for the project. Seven categories of features, including the large waste units used to contain the contaminated soil removed from the dam site, were screen digitized and used to generate accurate maps. Other map features include vegetation waste piles, where contaminated vegetation from the flood plain was contained, and ash piles, which are sites where vegetation debris was burned and then covered with clean soil. For all seven categories, the <b>area</b> <b>of</b> <b>disturbance</b> totaled just over 63 hectares. When the screen digitizing was completed, the elevation at the centroid of each disturbance was determined.

30|$|The {{response}} of the vegetation regrowth within the burned subcatchments was rapid as the region is dominated by resprouting species. Resprouting species favor <b>areas</b> <b>of</b> <b>disturbances</b> (Russell-Smith et al. 2010) and maximize fitness by allocating more resources to root reserves and structures that will increase their chances of surviving the next fire (Bond and Van Wilgen 1996). Knox and Morrison (2005) also demonstrated the quick {{response of}} resprouting sclerophyll vegetation, finding that shrubs resprouting from lignotubers had greater reproductive output at sites with longer rather than shorter inter-fire intervals. Resprouting species do not lose all of their aboveground biomass and the canopy is not always 100 % scorched (Morrison and Renwick 2000). In comparison, obligate seeders are often killed by wildfire and require a fire-free period after germination and adequate post-fire rainfall to ensure seedling growth and development (Lamont and Markey 1995), which slows down the overall vegetation response process.|$|R
