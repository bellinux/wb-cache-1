5|$|German {{forces in}} France {{reported}} losses of 158,930 men between D-Day and 14 August, {{just before the}} start of Operation Dragoon in Southern France.

5|$|San Martino saw <b>action</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Battle of Lissa, fought {{during the}} Third Italian War of Independence in 1866. There {{she was in}} the center of the <b>action,</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> head of the Italian main body. Of the three ships in her division, San Martino was the only vessel to survive the battle. After the war, the ship's career was uneventful, the result of the {{emergence}} of more modern ironclads and a severe reduction in the Italian naval budget following their defeat at Lissa. She was rebuilt as a central battery ship some time after Lissa, and was modernized again in the late 1880s. The ship was eventually broken up for scrap in 1903.|$|E
5|$|The Orel {{brought with}} it 40 men, 2-machine guns, and a doctor.

The Russians were successful in capturing an estimated 180 mutineers. The Russians had also engaged in heavy gun battle with the mutineers on the night of 25th February.|$|E
5|$|The pursuit resumed {{the next}} day at dawn, and was {{followed}} by yet another <b>action</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Battle of Ratisbon, where the Austrians tried to delay the French pursuit. After fierce fighting, during which Nansouty's and Saint-Sulpice's men successfully charged the enemy cavalry three times, the French captured the citadel at Ratisbon, but saw the Austrians skilfully retreating. Nansouty was left at Ratisbon with Davout, to observe the retreat of Archduke Charles.|$|E

5|$|A skilful pilot, Hull {{dedicated}} {{much of his}} pre-war {{service to}} aerobatics, flying Hawker Audaxes, Furies and Hurricanes. He reacted to the outbreak of war with enthusiasm and achieved No. 43 Squadron's first victory of the conflict in late January 1940. Reassigned to Norway in May 1940 to command a flight of Gloster Gladiator biplanes belonging to No. 263 Squadron, he downed four German aircraft in an hour over the Bodø area south-west of Narvik on 26 May, a feat that earned him the Distinguished Flying Cross. He was shot down the next day, and invalided back to England. Hull returned to <b>action</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> end of August, when he was made commander of No. 43 Squadron with the rank of squadron leader. A week later, he died in a dogfight over south London.|$|E

5|$|All four ships saw <b>action</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Battle of Lissa {{during the}} Third Italian War of Independence in 1866. Regina Maria Pia was badly {{burned in the}} battle, but the other three vessels were not seriously damaged. The ships served {{in a variety of}} roles for the {{remainder}} of their long careers; they were modernized in the late 1880s and thereafter used as a training ships. Regina Maria Pia, San Martino, and Ancona were discarded in 190304, and Castelfidardo joined them in the breaker's yard in 1910.|$|E
5|$|All four ships saw major action {{during the}} war. Augsburg fired the first {{shots of the}} war against Russia on 2 August. Mainz and Cöln were sunk at the Battle of Heligoland Bight {{in the first month}} of the war. Kolberg saw <b>action</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Battle of Dogger Bank in January 1915 and scored the first hits of the engagement. Both Kolberg and Augsburg participated in the Battle of the Gulf of Riga in August 1915, and Operation Albion in October 1917. After the end of the war, Kolberg was seized by France as a war prize and {{commissioned}} into the French Navy as Colmar; she served for only a few years and was scrapped in 1929. Augsburg was surrendered to Japan, which broke her up for scrap in 1922.|$|E
5|$|At the {{outbreak}} of war in August 1914, Augsburg was deployed to the Baltic, while Kolberg, Mainz, and Cöln remained in the North Sea. The three ships were assigned to patrol duty in the Heligoland Bight; on 28 August 1914, they were attacked during the Battle of Heligoland Bight. Mainz and Cöln were both sunk in the battle. Kolberg saw <b>action</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Battle of Dogger Bank in January 1915, and joined Augsburg for the Battle of the Gulf of Riga in August 1915. Both ships also saw service during Operation Albion in October 1917. Both ships survived the war; Kolberg was ceded to France, where she was renamed Colmar and served in the French Navy until 1927. Augsburg was surrendered to Japan and was then sold for scrap.|$|E

5|$|BZP {{has been}} shown to have a mixed {{mechanism}} of action, acting on the serotonergic and dopaminergic receptor systems in a similar fashion to MDMA. BZP has amphetamine-like actions on the serotonin reuptake transporter, which increase serotonin concentrations in the extracellular fluids surrounding the cell and thereby increasing activation of the surrounding serotonin receptors. BZP has a lower potency effect on the noradrenaline reuptake transporter and the dopamine reuptake transporter. BZP has a high affinity <b>action</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> alpha2-adrenoreceptor, it is an antagonist at the receptor, like yohimbine, which inhibits negative feedback, causing an increase in released noradrenaline.|$|E
5|$|Elsewhere on the Eastern front, the Junkers {{assisted}} Army Group Centre in its {{drive toward}} Moscow. From 13–22 December, 420 vehicles and 23 tanks {{were destroyed by}} StG 77, greatly improving {{the morale of the}} German infantry, who were by now on the defensive. StG 77 finished the campaign as the most effective dive bomber wing. It had destroyed 2,401 vehicles, 234 tanks, 92 artillery batteries and 21 trains for the loss of 25 Ju 87s to hostile <b>action.</b> <b>At</b> <b>the</b> end of Barbarossa, StG 1 had lost 60 Stukas in aerial combat and one on the ground. StG 2 lost 39 Ju 87s in the air and two on the ground, StG 77 lost 29 of their dive-bombers in the air and three on the ground (25 to enemy action). IV.(St)/LG1, operating from Norway, lost 24 Ju 87s, all in aerial combat.|$|E
5|$|Habsburg saw <b>action</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Battle of Lissa in July 1866, {{though she}} was not {{significantly}} engaged during the battle. In 1870, she was used {{in a show of}} force to try to prevent the Italian annexation of Rome while the city's protector, France, was distracted with the Franco-Prussian War, though the Italians took the city regardless. The ship's armament was revised several times in the 1870s and 1880s, before she was ultimately withdrawn from frontline service and employed as a guard ship and a barracks ship in Pola in 1886. She served in this role until 1898 when she was stricken from the naval register and broken up for scrap in 18991900.|$|E
