40|$|Cloud {{computing}} is {{the latest}} computing paradigm that delivers hardware and software resources as virtualized services in which users are free from the burden of worrying about the low-level system administration details. Migrating Web applications to Cloud services and integrating Cloud services into existing computing infrastructures is non-trivial. It leads to new challenges that often require innovation of paradigms and practices at all levels: technical, cultural, legal, regulatory, and social. The key problem in mapping Web applications to virtualized Cloud services is selecting the best and compatible mix of software images (e. g., Web server image) and infrastructure services to ensure that Quality of Service (QoS) targets of an application are achieved. The fact that, when selecting Cloud services, engineers must consider heterogeneous sets of criteria and complex dependencies between infrastructure services and software images, which are impossible to resolve manually, is a critical issue. To overcome these challenges, we present a framework (called CloudGenius) which automates the decision-making process based on a model <b>and</b> <b>factors</b> <b>specifically</b> for Web server migration to the Cloud. CloudGenius leverages a well known multi-criteria decision making technique, called Analytic Hierarchy Process, to automate the selection process based on a model, factors, and QoS parameters related to an application. An example application demonstrates {{the applicability of the}} theoretical CloudGenius approach. Moreover, we present an implementation of CloudGenius that has been validated through experiments.

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} motives behind {{internal}} income transfers through an analysisof original survey data. Though {{there has been}} much research on this topic, few studies haveaddressed the role of seasonal migration <b>and</b> <b>factors</b> <b>specifically</b> relevant to women (such asnumber of children) in remittance behavior. Both issues are investigated here. Over 100 femalemigrant domestic workers living in Dakar, Senegal were given a survey on their remittancebehaviors, work, and family situations. The correlations between percent of income remittedand explanatory variables such as age, number of children, and status as a seasonal migrant, wasused to determine the characteristics of migrants who remit the most. This information was thenused to draw conclusions on migrants' motives for remitting. Three main results were established. First, status as a seasonal migrant is associated with a higher percent of income remitted relative to non-seasonal migrants, suggesting that seasonal migrants have a greater stake in their home community due to regular stays at home. This also reflects the idea that families use rural-urban migration as a tool for household consumption smoothing. Secondly, having asmall number of children is associated with a higher percent of income remitted relative to those with many or no children, indicating that the women with one or two young children leave them in care of their grandparents, and that remittances are a form of payment for the child's needs. Finally, migrants with a deceased father remit less than those with a living father, which supports an insurance motive...|$|E

Policy makers and urban planners {{all over the world}} have been promoting bicycling. City of Seattle has been implementing new policies and programs to create a bike friendly environment and aims to quadruple ridership by 2030. Therefore, empirically confirming such growth in Seattle will help to justify current and future investment in bicycle infrastructure and programs in Seattle. This study uses Seattle cyclist count data to quantify cycling trend and examine their relationship between seasonal and weather factors. First, a systematic approach is taken to identify the explanatory variables and their appropriate forms of transformation. Then different models are investigated and compared to best capture the relationship between bike counts <b>and</b> <b>factors.</b> <b>Specifically,</b> non-linearity, discontinuity and interaction items are taken into account. Results are interpreted with intuitive visualization using counterfactual simulations. Furthermore, a predictive model is proposed to estimate daily count in the future. Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) model is used to account for autocorrelation. Its predictive performance is evaluated using cross validation. Finally, proposed methodology is applied to multiple locations in Seattle and identify their unique bicycle travel patterns. This research will help policy makers and transportation planners to better understand the factors that could drive the bike demand and influence bike travel behavior...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The {{levelized cost}} of energy (LCOE) {{approach}} has become popular, {{especially in the}} field of renewable energy. We argue that when assessing levelized cost of energy, different rates should be used for borrowing and discount rates. We further argue that the risk-free rate should be used for discounting when assessing and comparing the cost of energy across different producers and technologies. Recent analyses used the same rate for borrowing and discounting, which leads to underestimation of the cost for risky borrowers and to distorted sensitivities of the cost to financial <b>and</b> non-financial <b>factors.</b> <b>Specifically,</b> it is shown that they may lead to gross underestimation of the importance of solar-to-electricity conversion efficiency when applied to photovoltaics.

While a few previous studies have included moral disengagement as an antecedent of prosocial decision making, we highlight the significance of this factor in the avoidance of moral responsibility towards others in need. The results highlight two ways in which differences in emotional tendencies and moral-cognitive processes may operate in prosocial decision making in high personal cost situations. First, high empathy levels could promote an altruistic response which in turn fosters mature prosocial moral reasoning. Second, personal distress may enhance moral disengagement mechanisms that may facilitate self-centred behaviors...|$|R

40|$|Sirtuin 3 (SIRT 3) is {{a member}} of the sirtuin family of {{proteins}} that promote longevity in many organisms. Increased expression of SIRT 3 has been linked to an extended life span in humans. Here, we have shown that Sirt 3 protects the mouse heart by blocking the cardiac hypertrophic response. Although Sirt 3 -deficient mice appeared to have normal activity, they showed signs of cardiac hypertrophy and interstitial fibrosis at 8 weeks of age. Application of hypertrophic stimuli to these mice produced a severe cardiac hypertrophic response, whereas Sirt 3 -expressing Tg mice were protected from similar stimuli. In primary cultures of cardiomyocytes, Sirt 3 blocked cardiac hypertrophy by activating the forkhead box O 3 a–dependent (Foxo 3 a-dependent), antioxidant–encoding genes manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD) and catalase (Cat), thereby decreasing cellular levels of ROS. Reduced ROS levels suppressed Ras activation and downstream signaling through the MAPK/ERK and PI 3 K/Akt pathways.
