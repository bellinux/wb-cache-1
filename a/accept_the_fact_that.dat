25|$|Another {{powerful}} {{tactic of}} nonviolent intervention invokes public {{scrutiny of the}} oppressors {{as a result of}} the resisters remaining nonviolent in the face of violent repression. If the military or police attempt to repress nonviolent resisters violently, the power to act shifts from the hands of the oppressors to those of the resisters. If the resisters are persistent, the military or police will be forced to <b>accept</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> they no longer have any power over the resisters. Often, the willingness of the resisters to suffer has a profound effect on the mind and emotions of the oppressor, leaving them unable to commit such a violent act again.|$|E

25|$|Though Catherine's {{life and}} reign {{included}} remarkable personal successes, they ended with two failures. Her Swedish cousin (once removed), King Gustav IV Adolph, visited her in September 1796, the Empress's intention being that her granddaughter Alexandra should become Queen of Sweden by marriage. A ball was {{given at the}} imperial court on 11 September, when the engagement {{was supposed to be}} announced. Gustav Adolph felt pressured to <b>accept</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> Alexandra would not be converting to Lutheranism, and though he was delighted by the young lady, he refused to appear at the ball and left for Stockholm. Catherine was so irritated at this, her health was affected. She recovered well enough to begin to plan a ceremony where a favourite grandson would supersede her difficult son on the throne, but she died of a stroke before the announcement could be made, just over two months after the engagement ball.|$|E

25|$|Regarding {{locus of}} control, {{there is another}} type of control that entails a mix among the {{internal}} and external types. People that have the combination of the two types of locus of control are often referred to as Bi-locals. People that have Bi-local characteristics are known to handle stress and cope with their diseases more efficiently by having the mixture of internal and external locus of control. People that have this mix of loci of control can take personal responsibility for their actions and the consequences thereof while remaining capable of relying upon and having faith in outside resources; these characteristics correspond to {{the internal and external}} loci of control, respectively. An example of this mixed system would be an alcoholic who will <b>accept</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> he brought the disease upon himself while remaining open to treatment and/or acknowledging that there are people, mainly doctors and therapists, that are trying to cure his/her addiction, and on whom he should rely.|$|E

500|$|Nick Campbell of TV.com {{wrote that}} the quality of the episode hinged on whether or not the viewer could <b>accept</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> the {{characters}} were unaware of the extent of the footage that the camera crew caught. He wrote that [...] "If you can ride with the Scranton branch not understanding what 'being filmed all the time' means, this might have been a pretty funny episode. If you can't ... then the premise of this episode is pretty awful." [...] He concluded that while [...] "Promos" [...] had [...] "its moments", it was not the most solid of the series' episodes. Alan Sepinwall of HitFix felt that [...] "there was good idea hiding inside of 'The Promo' [...] ", but that much of the episode was undermined by the broad nature of the humor.|$|E

2500|$|In 1963, William O'Dwyer, {{a reserve}} U.S. Air Force major, accidentally {{discovered}} photographs of a 1910 Whitehead [...] "Large Albatross"-type biplane aircraft shown at {{rest on the}} ground. He found the photo collection in the attic of a Connecticut house. He and members of his 9315th U.S. Air Force Reserve Squadron were requested by the Connecticut Aeronautical Historical Association (CAHA) to conduct research to try to learn if Whitehead had made powered flights. O'Dwyer continued his research for years and became convinced that Whitehead did fly before the Wright brothers. In a 1981 conversation with O'Dwyer, former CAHA president Harvey Lippincott said, [...] "I cannot <b>accept</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> he flew 7 miles, but I can <b>accept</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> this airplane of his may have flown 100 – 200 feet, 10–15 feet off the ground.

2500|$|Some critics {{found the}} premise of Never Cry Wolf a bit hard to believe. Vincent Canby, film critic for The New York Times, wrote, [...] "I find it {{difficult}} to <b>accept</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> the biologist, just after an airplane has left {{him in the middle of}} an icy wilderness, in a snowstorm, would promptly get out his typewriter and, wearing woolen gloves, attempt to type up his initial reactions.

[...] In June 2004 an LTSA spokesperson stated, [...] "I think {{the vast majority of people}} <b>accept</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> helmets protect them.

Later, the chief military and civilian figures responsible for the shooting were removed from their positions as the press came to <b>accept</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> the strike dealt with poor conditions and was not a communist-led anti-regime action.
