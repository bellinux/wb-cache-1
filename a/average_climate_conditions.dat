30|$|The {{soil water}} content {{decreases}} noticeably after day 107 {{in an average}} year (Figure  7). In average years, irrigation should not be required before day 107. The climatic water balance gets negative from day 107 onwards because of an increasing evapotranspiration that is not compensated by precipitation. Thus, the calculation of the soil water content within the BewUe model was set to start at day 107 with an actual value of 224.9  l/m 3.

To investigate the relationships between relative fire extent (i.e., widespread vs. local) and inter-annual moisture patterns, we used PDSI in a superposed epoch analysis (SEA) (Baisan and Swetnam 1990). We identified widespread fire years when ≥ 70 % of recording plots scarred, and local fire years when < 70 % of recording plots scarred. The SEA method computed the <b>average</b> <b>climate</b> <b>conditions</b> associated with fire years as well as years {{before and after the}} fire event. We then compared the averages to variation in the entire climate record using Monte Carlo simulations that provided an expected average and confidence intervals (Grissino-Mayer 1995).|$|E
40|$|Studies diverge {{substantially}} on {{the actual}} magnitude of the North American carbon budget. This {{is due to the}} lack of appropriate data and also stems from the difficulty to properly model all the details of the flux distribution and transport inside the region of interest. To sidestep these difficulties, we use here a simple budgeting approach to estimate land-atmosphere fluxes across North America by balancing the inflow and outflow of CO 2 from the troposphere. We base our study on the unique sampling strategy of atmospheric CO 2 vertical profiles over North America from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration/Earth System Research Laboratory aircraft network, from which we infer the three-dimensional CO 2 distribution over the continent. We find a moderate sink of 0. 5  ±  0. 4  PgC y- 1 for the period 2004 – 2006 for the coterminous United States, in good agreement with the forest-inventory-based estimate of the first North American State of the Carbon Cycle Report, and <b>averaged</b> <b>climate</b> <b>conditions.</b> We find that the highest uptake occurs in the Midwest and in the Southeast. This partitioning agrees with independent estimates of crop uptake in the Midwest, which proves to be a significant part of the US atmospheric sink, and of secondary forest regrowth in the Southeast. Provided that vertical profile measurements are continued, our study offers an independent means to link regional carbon uptake to climate drivers...|$|R

40|$|Quantitative {{estimates}} of climate variability are increasingly important in interpretations of archaeological turnovers in arid regions. Variations in lake levels or lake-water oxygen isotope ratios (? 18 O) {{are often used}} to infer droughts or humid periods, along with speleothem ? 18 O, pollen, and windblown dust records. Key examples are the centennial-scale Holocene events associated {{with the end of}} the Bronze Age (? 1200 BCE), the end of the Copper Age (? 4000 BCE), and the onset of Neolithic expansion (? 6200 BCE). Whether explicitly stated or only implied, causality between archaeological turnovers and inferred droughts is often ascribed to a disturbance to food resources, which means a disturbance to the agricultural potential of the study region. In the present study, a simple framework of equations is presented for evaluation of this causality. It quantitatively reveals significant complications. In one example, substantially improved crop-growing potential is found to coincide with dropping lake levels, which reflect significant net drought. The complications mainly arise from: (1) control of annually <b>averaged</b> <b>climate</b> <b>conditions</b> on lake changes versus control of seasonal conditions on the yield potential of fields; and (2) changes in the ratios between the overall catchment area of a lake or field, and the surface area of the lake or field itself. The results demonstrate that lake records per se do not satisfactorily reflect agricultural potential, but also that this gap may be bridged with targeted information collection about the regional setting. In particular, improved results may be obtained from detailed assessments of change in the catchment ratios of the lake(s) and field(s) that are being studied (e. g., using digital elevation models), along with expert opinions on field irrigation potential. The scenarios presented here then allow initial field-based assessments and hypothesis formulation to prompt more sophisticated modelling...|$|R
30|$|Both, {{changes in}} <b>average</b> <b>climate</b> <b>conditions</b> during the main growing season and climate variability, {{particularly}} heat waves and droughts, affect crop growth. The fitting capacity {{to cope with}} climate change depends on the crop type and ecological boundary conditions [[43]]. Thus, additional irrigation requirements can be avoided or reduced by a reasonably adapted choice of the cultivated field crops [[33]]. With an accompanying climate change, dates for sowing could be shifted - to a limited extent - to earlier times in the year to use the natural water supply during the wet months in spring more efficiently [[34]]. At present, irrigation is mainly applied using long-throw sprinkler [[33]]. If irrigation efficiency would be improved by the application of techniques with lower evaporation losses (e.g. drip irrigation), the potential problems might be reduced. In some places the use of surface water for irrigation could also be adequately adjusted {{and contribute to the}} irrigation requirements [[33]].|$|E
30|$|The SEA {{was used}} to {{identify}} the relationship between inter-annual variability in climate and fire. The analysis tests the hypothesis of no relationship between fire years and climate preceding, during, and following the fire year. The SEA compares mean climate (PDSI, NIÑO 3, PDO) in fire years to climate in an eight-year window (i.e., five years before, the fire event year, and {{two years after the}} fire event year). We used autocorrelation functions (ACF) and auto-regressive moving average (ARMA) models to identify and remove serial autocorrelation in PDSI, NINO 3, and PDO (Box et al. 2008). The SEAs were conducted with the model residuals for those time series that exhibited serial autocorrelation. Monte Carlo simulations (1000 runs) were used to calculate confidence intervals for <b>average</b> <b>climate</b> <b>conditions</b> for years in the window and then compare them to randomly selected years in the record (Mooney and Duval 1993, Grissino-Mayer 2001). The analysis was performed for fires of different extent (any site, ≥ 10 %, and ≥ 25 % of sites burned), and for non-fire years.|$|E
30|$|Chapter 4 {{returns to}} the {{institutional}} politics that were behind the growth and maturation of the range succession model that looked to establish fixed stocking rates on rangeland types based on <b>average</b> <b>climate</b> <b>conditions.</b> The aim of applying the model was to manage rangeland systems in their desired states (based on species composition and standing biomass). Despite their limited relevance as a management tool for drier rangelands, there was much in favour of applying fixed stocking rates. Fixed metrics were useful for regulators, and such metrics became increasingly important as the Forest Service’s vision of setting permissible stocking levels for grazing districts became generalized {{with the passage of}} the Taylor Grazing Act of 1934. Stocking rates were also useful tools for ranchers as economic metrics to shape their investments. The chapter traces how range assessment developed to produce necessary carrying capacities of rangelands to meet the needs of state agencies and ranchers alike. In so doing, this chapter carefully traces the logical lapses and unsupported assumptions that facilitated the scalar shifts from empirical data collection, rangeland assessment, and rangeland regulation. This is the chapter that most directly explores the mixing of social and ecological scales in range science.|$|E

This study applied the Soil and Water Assessment Tool model to simulate the effects of land use on annual and monthly runoff in the Middle and Upstream Reaches of Taoerhe River basin, Northeast China, under the wet, <b>average</b> and dry <b>climate</b> <b>conditions</b> through scenario analysis. The results showed that from the early 1970 s to 2000, land use change {{with an increase in}} farmland (17. 0 %) and decreases in forest (10. 6 %), grassland (4. 6 %) and water body (3. 1 %) caused increases in annual and monthly runoff. This effect was more distinct in the wet season or in the wet year, suggesting that land use change from the early 1970 s to 2000 may increase the flood potential in the wet season. Increases in precipitation and air temperature from the average to wet year led to annual and monthly (March and from June to December) runoff increases, while a decrease in precipitation and an increase in air temperature from the average to dry year induced decreases in annual and monthly (all months except March) runoff, and moreover, these effects were more remarkable in the wet season than those in the dry season. Due to the integrated effects of changing land use and <b>climate</b> <b>conditions,</b> the annual runoff increased (decreased) by 70. 1 mm (25. 2 mm) or 197. 4 % (71. 0 %) from the average to wet (dry) year.

40|$|Purpose - The {{purpose of}} this paper is: to track the methods by which farmers access {{groundwater}} for irrigation in the North China Plain (NCP); to explore whether climate factors influence farmers' decisions on the methods of groundwater access for irrigation; and to examine whether the amount of groundwater use for irrigation and crop yield systematically differ across groups of farmers using various methods of groundwater access, and how climate factors affect them. Design/methodology/approach - Descriptive statistical analysis and econometric models are used on household survey data collected over several years and county-level climate data. Findings - Over the past few decades, a significant share of farmers have switched the methods of groundwater access from collective tubewells to own tubewells or groundwater markets. Farmers who bought water from groundwater markets applied less water to wheat plots than those who had their own tubewells. However, wheat yield was not negatively affected. Both <b>average</b> <b>climate</b> <b>conditions</b> and long-term variations were found to be related to farmers' choice of methods of groundwater access for irrigation. More frequent droughts and increasingly volatile temperatures both increased the likelihood of farmers gaining groundwater irrigation from markets.

Applying empirical analysis to identify the impact of the methods by which farmers access groundwater for irrigation on the amount of groundwater use and crop yield will help policy makers design reasonable adaptation policies for the NCP...|$|E

Previous studies show strong feedbacks between drought conditions and surface temperatures, which prompted {{the question of whether}} drought conditions are experiencing larger temperature increases in comparison to the average climate. The objective {{of this study was to}} investigate whether droughts have been warming faster than <b>average</b> <b>climate</b> <b>conditions</b> in the contiguous United States. Using gridded observations and climate models, we compared temperatures during different categories of drought severity on a monthly scale and mapped areas displaying an escalation of temperature with stricter definitions of drought.

Future projections also showed a larger warming shift during dry months in the Southern US between the 20 th and 21 st centuries. In the climate projections, the higher temperature shift was mostly attributed to the summer months. The summer associated temperature shift is rooted in preceding winter and spring precipitation, which influence the surface energy balance in regions with moderate climate.

Detrimental effects for the industry have been projected in numerous studies throughout several continents including, Australia, Asia, Europe and North America. Modeling based studies have revealed shortened ski seasons and increased snowmaking requirements under warmer temperatures. This study uses a climate change analogue approach to examine how a wider range of ski area performance indicators were affected by anomalously warm winters in the New England region of the USA. The record warm winter of 2001 - 02 is representative of projected future <b>average</b> winter <b>climate</b> <b>conditions</b> in the New England region under a high greenhouse gas emission scenario for the 2040 - 69 period and was used as one climate change analogue for this analysis. The 1998 - 99 ski season was also used as a climate change analogue as it represents the last of three consecutive warm winters that are representative of average winter conditions for the 2010 - 39 period. Ski area performance indicators for the 2001 - 02 and 1998 - 99 analogue years were compared to the climatically normal (for 1961 - 90) years of 2000 - 01 and 2004 - 05. The indicators examined include: ski season length, snowmaking (hours of operation and % fuel utilized as a proxy for fuel costs), total skier visits, visitation by time of year, average season passes sold, and operating profit (% of total gross revenue and % of total gross fixed assets). The revealed impact on ski season length during these climate change analogue years is also compared with modeled impacts for the region...|$|R

A comprehensive computer software was developed with a view to assessing the reliability and feasibility of the RWH systems in an urban setup. The software was developed using daily water balance modelling concept, which uses input data like daily rainfall, roof catchment area, runoff losses and tank volume. Three distinct climatic scenarios, i. e. wet, average and dry years were chosen by analysing historical 20 -years daily rainfall data. Typical residential buildings of plot size 2. 5 - 5. 0 katha (168 - 335 m 2) were considered for the study. Results indicated that about 15 - 25 % reliability can be achieved under the wet climatic condition and for catchment sizes varying from 140 m 2 to 200 m 2, 250 kL to 550 kL of rainwater can be harvested each year. Several reliability curves have been presented for two roof catchment sizes (140 m 2 and 200 m 2) under three climatic scenarios and an insignificant increase in the reliability of the RWH system beyond the tank volume of 30 m 3 was observed. The current underground tank sizes of the residential buildings are sufficient to prevent the potential overflow during monsoon.

40|$|Fire is {{a widely}} used tool to prepare deforested areas for {{agricultural}} use in Amazonia. Deforestation is currently concentrated in seasonal forest types along the arc of deforestation, where dry-season conditions facilitate burning of clear-felled vegetation. Interior Amazon forests, however, are less suitable for fire-driven deforestation due to more humid climate conditions. These forests will ultimately come under more intense pressure as the deforestation frontier advances. Whether these regions continue to be protected by humid conditions partly determines land use changes in interior Amazon forests. Here, we present {{a study of the}} climate constraint on deforestation fires in Amazonia under present-day and projected climate conditions. We used precipitation data and satellite-based active fire detections to model fire-driven deforestation potential. Our model results suggest that 58 % of the Amazon forest is too wet to permit fire-driven deforestation under current <b>average</b> <b>climate</b> <b>conditions.</b> Under the IPCC B 1 scenario, the model indicates increased fire potential by 2050 in eastern Amazonia, while dry-season precipitation may provide limitations on projected deforestation by 2050 in central and western Amazonia. However, the entire region is very sensitive to a possible drying with climate change; a reduction in dry-season precipitation of 200 mm/year would reduce the climate constraint on deforestation fires from 58 % to only 24 % of the forest. Our results suggest that dry-season climate conditions will continue to shape land use decisions in Amazonia through mid-century, and should therefore be included in deforestation projections for the region.

40|$|Maize is {{the main}} field crop on arable lands in Croatia. Climatic changes, {{particularly}} temperature regime and precipitation quantities and their distribution during growing season had often adverse effects on maize yield. Therefore, irrigation of maize crops in critical periods is useful considering the variations among annual yields caused by water stressed conditions. Acid soils are covering one-third of agricultural soils in Croatia (about 832. 000 hectares) and correction of pH by liming {{is also an important}} factor for increase and stabilization of annual yield values. The aim {{of this study was to}} review irrigation and liming effects on maize yield in eastern Croatia. Eastern Croatia covers an area of 12. 454 km 2 or 22. 0 % of the State territory. This region is termed as the “granary of Croatia” because 75 % of wheat and 50 % of maize harvested areas of the country are located in this region.

40|$|This study {{introduces}} two {{advances to}} the aggregate productivity index methodology typically employed by ABARES. First, {{it accounts for}} the effects of climate variability on measured productivity by matching spatial climate data to individual farms in the ABARES farm surveys database. Second, a farm-level production frontier estimation technique is employed to facilitate the decomposition of productivity change into several key components, including technical change and technical efficiency change. The study makes use of farm-level data from the ABARES Australian agricultural and grazing industries survey database. An unbalanced panel dataset is constructed containing 13 430 observations (4255 farms) over the period 1977 – 78 to 2007 – 08. Spatial climate data, including winter and summer seasonal rainfall and average maximum and minimum temperatures, were obtained via the Australian Water Availability Project. These data were mapped to individual farms using Geographic Information System methods. The study employed stochastic frontier analysis methods to estimate a production frontier with time varying technical efficiency effects of the form proposed by Battese and Coelli (1992). Production frontiers are estimated {{for each of the three}} major Grains Research and Development Corporation regions: southern, northern and western. Selected climate variables are shown to display a high degree of explanatory power over farm output. The results confirm that deterioration in <b>average</b> <b>climate</b> <b>conditions</b> has contributed significantly to the decline in estimated productivity over the post- 2000 period.

Eutrophication also altered the time scale in which grassland invasion responded to climate, decreasing the importance of long-term climate and increasing that of annual <b>climate.</b> Thus, climatic <b>conditions</b> mediate the responses of native and non-native flora to nutrient enrichment.

40|$|Climate change {{studies for}} West Africa tend to predict a reduced {{potential}} for farming {{that will affect}} the food security situation of an already impoverished population. However, these studies largely ignore farmers' adaptations and market adjustments that mitigate predicted negative effects. The paper attempts to fill some of this gap through a spatially explicit evaluation {{of the impact of}} climate change on farm income in the Oueme River Basin (ORB), Benin. The ORB is in many respects representative for the middle belt of West Africa where the predominantly sparse occupation leaves potential for migration from more densely populated areas. We apply a number of structural, spatially explicit relationships estimated for the whole territory of Benin to simulate conditions in the ORB proper that are similar to those currently prevailing in the drier North, and the more humid South. Our scenario results factor out for the main crops cultivated the constituent effects on yields, area, and revenue per ton. We find that under <b>average</b> <b>climate</b> change <b>conditions</b> the current low yields are not reduced, provided that cropping patterns are adjusted, while price increases partly compensate for the remaining adverse effects on farmer income. Consequently, without any policy intervention, farm incomes remain relatively stable, albeit at low levels and with increased occurrence of crop failures after extreme droughts. Scenario simulations show that there are also beneficial aspects that can, with adequate interventions, even turn losses into gains. Main channel for improvement would be the reduction of fallow, which is particularly promising because it requires few adjustments in prevailing farming practices, exploits the potential of uncultivated land and improves the water use efficiency. It also enables the Basin's capacity to absorb future migrant flows from more severely affected neighboring Sahelian areas. © 2011 The Author(s) ...|$|R

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{analyzes the}} impact of climate, and atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO 2) on crop yields and grain transportation. The analysis of crop yields endeavors to advance the literature by statistically estimating the effects of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO 2) on observed crop yields. This is done using an econometric model estimated over pooled historical data for 1950 - 2009 and data from the free air CO 2 enrichment experiments. The main findings are: 1) yields of soybeans, cotton, and wheat directly respond to the elevated CO 2, while yields of corn and sorghum do not; 2) the effect of crop technological progress on mean yields is non-linear; 3) ignoring atmospheric CO 2 in an econometric model of crop yield likely leads to overestimates of the pure {{effects of climate change}} and technological progress on crop yields; and 4) <b>average</b> <b>climate</b> <b>conditions</b> and climate variability contribute in a statistically significant way to average crop yields and their variability. To examine climate change impacts on grain transportation flows, this study employs two modeling systems, a U. S. agricultural sector model and an international grain transportation model, with linked inputs/outputs. The main findings are that under climate change: 1) the excess supply of corn and soybeans generally increases in Northern U. S. regions, while it declines in Central and Southern regions; 2) the Corn Belt, the largest producer of corn in the U. S., is anticipated to ship less corn; 3) the importance of lower Mississippi River ports, the largest current destination for U.

40|$|Geographical range {{dynamics}} {{are driven}} by the joint effects of abiotic factors, human ecosystem modifications, biotic interactions and the intrinsic organismal responses to these. However, the relative contribution of each component remains largely unknown. Here, we compare the contribution of life-history attributes, broad-scale gradients in climate and geographical context of species' historical ranges, as predictors of recent changes in area of occupancy for 116 terrestrial British breeding birds (74 contractors, 42 expanders) between the early 1970 s and late 1990 s. Regional threat classifications demonstrated that the species of highest conservation concern showed both the largest contractions and the smallest expansions. Species responded differently to climate depending on geographical distribution-northern species changed their area of occupancy (expansion or contraction) more in warmer and drier regions, whereas southern species changed more in colder and wetter environments. Species with slow life history (larger body size) tended to have a lower probability of changing their area of occupancy than species with faster life history, whereas species with greater natal dispersal capacity resisted contraction and, counterintuitively, expansion. Higher geographical fragmentation of species' range also increased expansion probability, possibly indicating a release from a previously limiting condition, for example through agricultural abandonment since the 1970 s. After accounting statistically for the complexity and nonlinearity of the data, our results demonstrate two key aspects of changing area of occupancy for British birds: (i) climate is the dominant driver of change, but direction of effect depends on geographical context, and (ii) all of our predictors generally had a similar effect regardless of {{the direction of the}} change (contraction versus expansion). Although we caution applying results from Britain's highly modified and well-studied bird community to other biogeographic regions, our results do indicate that a species' propensity to change area of occupancy over decadal scales can be explained partially by a combination of simple allometric predictors of life-history pace, <b>average</b> <b>climate</b> <b>conditions</b> and geographical context.

40|$|Convection-permitting {{climate model}} are {{promising}} tools for improved representation of extremes, {{but the number}} of regions for which these models have been evaluated are still rather limited to make robust conclusions. In addition, an integrated interpretation of near-surface characteristics (typically temperature and precipitation) together with cloud properties is limited. The objective {{of this paper is to}} comprehensively evaluate the performance of a ‘state-of-the-art’ regional convection-permitting climate model for a mid-latitude coastal region with little orographic forcing. For this purpose, an 11 -year integration with the COSMO-CLM model at Convection-Permitting Scale (CPS) using a grid spacing of 2. 8 km was compared with in-situ and satellite-based observations of precipitation, temperature, cloud properties and radiation (both at the surface and the top of the atmosphere). CPS clearly improves the representation of precipitation, in especially the diurnal cycle, intensity and spatial distribution of hourly precipitation. Improvements in the representation of temperature are less obvious. In fact the CPS integration overestimates both low and high temperature extremes. The underlying cause for the overestimation of high temperature extremes was attributed to deficiencies in the cloud properties: The modelled cloud fraction is only 46 % whereas a cloud fraction of 65 % was observed. Surprisingly, the effect of this deficiency was less pronounced at the radiation balance at the top of the atmosphere due to a compensating error, in particular an overestimation of the reflectivity of clouds when they are present. Overall, a better representation of convective precipitation and a very good representation of the daily cycle in different cloud types were demonstrated. However, to overcome remaining deficiencies, additional efforts are necessary to improve cloud characteristics in CPS. This will be a challenging task due to compensating deficiencies that currently exist in ‘state-of-the-art’ models, yielding a good representation of <b>average</b> <b>climate</b> <b>conditions.</b> In the light of using the CPS models to study climate change it is necessary that these deficiencies are addressed in future research. status: publishe...|$|E

40|$|In this contribution, we {{perform a}} case study of the German forests. We couple the Frankfurt {{biosphere}} model (FBM) with a model of the age class development (AGEDYN). The coupled model is applied to simulate the temporal development of carbon pools in German forests under the influence of climate change taking into account changes in the age class structure. In the base case, the growth of forest stands is simulated using a temporally <b>averaged</b> <b>climate</b> dataset, being representative for the contemporary <b>climate</b> <b>conditions.</b> To assess the sensitivity of forest growth to changes in environmental conditions, the FBM is run in several scenarios. In these simulations the eVects both of climate change and of the direct eVect of increased levels of atmospheric CO 2 on photosynthesis (CO 2 fertilization) on forest growth are assessed. In another simulation run with the FBM both eVects — climate change and CO 2 fertilization — are combined. In simulations under present day’s <b>climate</b> <b>conditions</b> a good agreement is gained between simulation results and statistical data of the present standing stock carbon density of Germany’s forests. A pure climate change leads to a decrease of the annual increments {{as well as to the}} climax standing stocks. The negative eVect of climate change alone is overcompensated by enhanced photosynthesis in the simulations with combined climate change and CO 2 fertiliza-tion. In the transient case, the coupled model is used in two scenarios describing first a continua-tion of present day’s <b>climate</b> <b>conditions</b> and second a transient climate change from present conditions (1990) to 2 ×CO 2 conditions in 2090. Here, the simulations indicate that changes in the forest’s age class structure can have a stronger influence on the future carbon balance of the forests in the considered region than the combined eVect of climate change and CO 2 fertilization...|$|R
40|$|The {{focus of}} this paper is on the energy {{performance}} and thermo-economic assessment of a small scale (100 kWe) combined cooling, heat and power (CCHP) plant serving a tertiary/residential energy demand fired by natural gas and solid biomass. The plant is based on a modified regenerative micro gas-turbine (MGT), where compressed air exiting the recuperator is externally heated by the hot gases produced in a biomass furnace. The flue gases after the recuperator flow through a heat recovery system (HRS), producing domestic hot water (DHW) at 90 °C, space heating (SH), and also chilled water (CW) by means of an absorption chiller (AC). Different biomass/natural gas ratios and an aggregate of residential end-users in cold, <b>average</b> and mild <b>climate</b> <b>conditions</b> are compared in the thermo-economic assessment, in order to assess the trade-offs between: (i) the lower energy conversion efficiency and higher investment cost when increasing the biomass input rate; (ii) the higher primary energy savings and revenues from feed-in tariffs available for biomass electricity exported into the grid; and (iii) the improved energy performance, sales revenue and higher investment and operational costs of trigeneration. The results allow for a comparison of the energy performance and investment profitability of the selected system configuration, {{as a function of the}} heating/cooling demand intensity, and report a global energy efficiency in the range of 25 - 45 %, and IRR in the range of 15 - 20 % assuming the Italian subsidy framework...|$|R

However, the relative contribution of each component remains largely unknown. Here, we compare the contribution of life-history attributes, broad-scale gradients in climate and geographical context of species’ historical ranges, as predictors of recent changes in area of occupancy for 116 terrestrial British breeding birds (74 contractors, 42 expanders) between the early 1970 s and late 1990 s. Regional threat classifications demonstrated that the species of highest conservation concern showed both the largest contractions and the smallest expansions. Species responded differently to climate depending on geographical distribution—northern species changed their area of occupancy (expansion or contraction) more in warmer and drier regions, whereas southern species changed more in colder and wetter environments. Species with slow life history (larger body size) tended to have a lower probability of changing their area of occupancy than species with faster life history, whereas species with greater natal dispersal capacity resisted contraction and, counterintuitively, expansion. Higher geographical fragmentation of species' range also increased expansion probability, possibly indicating a release from a previously limiting condition, for example through agricultural abandonment since the 1970 s. After accounting statistically for the complexity and nonlinearity of the data, our results demonstrate two key aspects of changing area of occupancy for British birds: (i) climate is the dominant driver of change, but direction of effect depends on geographical context, and (ii) all of our predictors generally had a similar effect regardless of {{the direction of the}} change (contraction versus expansion). Although we caution applying results from Britain's highly modified and well-studied bird community to other biogeographic regions, our results do indicate that a species' propensity to change area of occupancy over decadal scales can be explained partially by a combination of simple allometric predictors of life-history pace, <b>average</b> <b>climate</b> <b>conditions</b> and geographical context.

40|$|Climate comfort {{is often}} taken for granted. However even in {{moderate}} ambient conditions, indoor climates can lack comfort {{without the use}} of appropriate resources. Around Nepal the <b>average</b> <b>climate</b> <b>conditions</b> range from - 10 to 40 °C with relative humilities ranging from 37 % to over 80 %. This is coupled with limited economic resources and access to grid electricity, which restricts the use of active modern conditioning systems (such as heat pump airconditioning). This report explored passive conditioning methods in climates around Nepal to improve climate comfort. These methods include evaporative cooling, use of ground source thermal energy and solar heating. A trombe wall model was then analysed in detail due to a simple design, utilising solar energy to drive convection currents within an air gap. Standards were compared to achievable climate comfort conditions provided by the American Society of Heating, Refrigeration and Air Conditioning Engineers (AHSRAE). A trombe wall model was solved by considering an iterative solution method of onedimensional heat transfer and an efficiency of heat removed by convective airflow. Important inputs included the ambient temperature, room thermal resistivity and solar irradiance. The incident solar irradiance has been modelled as varying throughout the day, according a method outlined by ASHRAE and subsequent locational data. The room temperature was modelled over a day by considering room thermal resistances from 0. 004 K/W to 0. 05 K/W, and the ambient temperature variation. Results showed that a wall area of 1. 4 m x 2. 5 m can provide 6 hours of thermal comfort with ambient daily temperatures between 5. 7 and 15 °C in Okhaldhunga, Nepal, given 0. 03 K/W room thermal resistance. The same comfort condition was achieved for an ambient daily temperature range from - 10. 1 to 6. 9 °C in Lhasa, China with a 5 m x 2. 5 m wall, and 0. 03 K/W room thermal resistance. 6 hours above a minimum ventilation flow rate, as recommended by ASHRAE was also achievable. This was modelled as exhaust flow vented to the outside, with a wall height of 2. 5 m and lengths between 3. 5 m and 4. 1 m depending on location...|$|E
40|$|Today already climate {{variability}} has {{an impact}} on crop yield. Under future climate change, not only <b>average</b> <b>climate</b> <b>conditions</b> will change but also the variability is expected to further increase. Therefore it is crucial to gain an appropriate understanding of the impact of climate variability on crop yield under current climatic conditions. This knowledge will help to identify adaptation strategies to cope with the impact of future climate change. This study identifies the key climate factors influencing the inter-annual variability of maize and winter wheat yields in Europe. In addition, it aims to find the large-scale atmospheric configurations most risky for crop loss under present climate conditions. Crop yield time series, obtained from national statistical offices in Europe, are used in this study. The time series are quality controlled and cover the last 12 to 25 years. Meteorological data is retrieved from the MARS Crop Yield Forecasting System (MCYFS) database, established and maintained by the Joint Research Centre for the purpose of crop yield monitoring and forecasting. Since crop yield is strongly influenced by changes and improvements in agro-management practice, a de-trending procedure (based on LOESS) is applied to crop yield time series. Thus, the filtered time series can be used to estimate the influence of climate variability on the inter-annual variability of crop yield. Partial least square regression (PLSR) analysis is applied to identify those climate factors with the highest impact on the variability of crop yields. PLSR aims at optimising the covariance between response and explanatory variables and is particularly useful when the number of predictors is large compared to the number of observations. De-trended crop yield time series are used as dependent variable and several different climate factors as independent variable. For this purpose, monthly values of cumulated precipitation, total global radiation and mean air temperature are calculated for each month of the grain maize growing season (from April to September) and the winter wheat growing season (from December to July). The second part of this analysis focuses on the identification and characterisation of the large scale atmospheric patterns that are the most risky for crop loss under present climate conditions. The frequency of prevailing weather regimes during the growing period is analysed in years with low yields and compared to the frequency in years with normal or above-average yields. The results reveal that the most influential climate factors and the timing of impact are highly dependent on the region where the crops are grown. Grain maize and winter wheat yield are significantly influenced by weather conditions during the period of flowering. The weather conditions {{at the beginning of the}} growing season have substantial impact on grain maize yield especially over regions with continental climate. This can be explained by the high influence of weather on sowing conditions and therefore also on the length of growing period. Finally, we discuss how these findings can be used in the assessment of climate change impacts. JRC. H. 4 -Monitoring Agricultural Resource...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of a thermo-economic assessment of small scale (100 kWe) Combined Heat and Power (CHP) plants fired by natural gas and solid biomass to serve a residential energy demand, comparing different plant operating strategies. The focus is on dual fuel micro gas turbine (MGT) cycle, where compressed air is heated in the high temperature heat exchanger (HTHE) using the hot gases produced in a biomass furnace, before entering the gas combustion chamber. The hot air expands in the turbine and then feeds the internal pre-heater recuperator, while the biomass combustion flue gases are used for combustion air pre-heating. Various biomass/natural gas energy input ratios are modelled, in order to assess the trade-offs between: (i) lower energy conversion efficiency and higher investment cost when increasing the biomass input rate; (ii) higher primary energy savings and revenues from feed-in tariff available for biomass electricity fed into the grid. The strategies of baseload (BL), heat driven (HD) and electricity driven (ED) plant operation are compared, for an aggregate of residential end-users in cold, <b>average</b> and mild <b>climate</b> <b>conditions.</b> On the basis of the results from thermodynamic assessment, including partial load operation (carried out by Gate Cycle,) CAPEX and OPEX assessment, and Italian energy policy scenario (incentives available for biomass electricity, on-site and high efficiency CHP), the maximum global energy efficiency, primary energy savings and investment profitability is found, as a function of biomass/natural gas ratio, plant operating strategy and energy demand typology...|$|R
