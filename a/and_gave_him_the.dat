Lefèvre, who knew that Garin was {{the star of the}} race, broke the rules <b>and</b> <b>gave</b> <b>him</b> <b>the</b> food, because {{he did not want to}} be responsible for Garin leaving the race because of hunger.|$|E
5|$|The castle briefly {{reverted to}} the Crown again, but in 1247 passed by {{marriage}} to William de Valence, half brother to Henry III. De Valence was a French nobleman from Poitiers and a noted soldier who {{spent most of}} his life fighting in military campaigns; Henry arranged his marriage to Joan de Munchensi, one of the heiresses to the Marshal estate. The marriage made Valence immensely rich <b>and</b> <b>gave</b> <b>him</b> <b>the</b> title of Earl of Pembroke.|$|E

5|$|Two {{years after}} his {{tutoring}} had begun, {{he was sent to}} the Lower Grammar School at Växjö in 1717. Linnaeus rarely studied, often going to the countryside to look for plants. He reached the last year of the Lower School when he was fifteen, which was taught by the headmaster, Daniel Lannerus, who was interested in botany. Lannerus noticed Linnaeus' interest in botany <b>and</b> <b>gave</b> <b>him</b> <b>the</b> run of his garden.|$|E
5|$|Conrad {{seems to}} have been {{involved}} when Henry V revolted against his father in 1105. This would explain his election as Archbishop of Salzburg at the Diet of Mainz on 7 January 1106. At that time the anti-Archbishop Berthold von Moosburg was installed in Salzburg. Conrad came to Salzburg accompanied by his brothers, the counts Otto and Wolfram, with an escort of 1,000 soldiers. Some of these soldiers may well have been servitors, servile rather than free vassals. With this display of force, he was able to force Berthold to abdicate. Pope Paschal II consecrated him as bishop on 21 October 1106 <b>and</b> <b>gave</b> <b>him</b> <b>the</b> pallium.|$|E
5|$|In {{the regular}} season finale of 2001, Favre {{was the target of}} minor {{controversy}} when, in a game against the New York Giants at Giants Stadium, he was sacked by the Giants defensive end Michael Strahan. It was Strahan's lone sack of the game <b>and</b> <b>gave</b> <b>him</b> <b>the</b> NFL's single–season sack record of 22.5, which topped Mark Gastineau's record of 22 set in 1984. The controversy (Favre fell over unusually easily) has followed Strahan continuously since he set the record. Jim Fassel, Strahan's coach in 2001, said that when a respected athlete like Strahan gets close to an all-time record, sometimes opponents want him to break it.|$|E

5|$|Shortly after, on October/November of {{the same}} year, Sahib ibn Abbad, the vizier of Adud al-Dawla's younger brother Mu'ayyad al-Dawla, arrived from Ray to {{negotiate}} a transfer {{of power in the}} city in favor of his master. Adud al-Dawla, recognized his younger brother Mu'ayyad because of his loyalty, <b>and</b> <b>gave</b> <b>him</b> <b>the</b> troops of Fakhr al-Dawla and helped him conquer Tabaristan and Gorgan from Qabus who had betrayed Adud al-Dawla by giving refugee to Fakhr al-Dawla. Mu'ayyad al-Dawla shortly managed to conquer these two provinces.|$|E
5|$|By {{the late}} 1140s the active {{phase of the}} civil war was over, barring the {{occasional}} outbreak of fighting. Many of the barons were making individual peace agreements with each other to secure their war gains and it increasingly appeared as though the English Church was considering promoting a peace treaty. On Louis VII's return from the Second Crusade in 1149, he became concerned about the growth of Geoffrey's power and the potential threat to his own possessions, especially if Henry could acquire the English crown. In 1150, Geoffrey made Henry the Duke of Normandy and Louis responded by putting forward King Stephen's son Eustace as the rightful heir to the duchy and launching a military campaign to remove Henry from the province. Henry's father advised him {{to come to terms with}} Louis and peace was made between them in August 1151 after mediation by Bernard of Clairvaux. Under the settlement Henry did homage to Louis for Normandy, accepting Louis as his feudal lord, <b>and</b> <b>gave</b> <b>him</b> <b>the</b> disputed lands of the Norman Vexin; in return, Louis recognised him as duke.|$|E
5|$|Sargent's break {{came when}} Sir Henry Wood visited De Montfort Hall, Leicester, early in 1921 with the Queen's Hall orchestra. As it was {{customary}} to commission a piece {{from a local}} composer, Wood invited Sargent to write a piece entitled Impression on a Windy Day. Sargent completed the work too late for Wood to {{have enough time to}} learn it, and so Wood called on Sargent to conduct the first performance himself. Wood recognised not only the worth of the piece but also Sargent's talent as a conductor <b>and</b> <b>gave</b> <b>him</b> <b>the</b> chance to make his debut conducting the work at Wood's annual season of promenade concerts, generally known as the Proms, in the Queen's Hall on 11 October of the same year.|$|E

5|$|Sudirman {{was born}} to Karsid Kartawiraji (father) and Siyem while they lived with Siyem's sister Tarsem, one of three women married to the sub-district head Raden Cokrosunaryo, in Rembang, Bodas Karangjati, Purbalingga, Dutch East Indies. According to the family's records, Sudirman– named by his uncle– was born on a pon Sunday {{in the month of}} Maulud in the Javanese calendar; the Indonesian {{government}} later established 24 January 1916 as Sudirman's birthday. As Cokrosunaryo was in a better financial situation, he adopted Sudirman <b>and</b> <b>gave</b> <b>him</b> <b>the</b> title Raden, reserved for Javanese nobility; however, Sudirman was not told that Cokrosunaryo was not his birth father until he was eighteen. When Cokrosunaryo retired from his position as chief in late 1916, Sudirman went with the family to Manggisan, Cilacap, where he was raised. In Cilacap Karsid and Siyem had another son, Muhammad Samingan. Karsid died when Sudirman was six, at which time Siyem left the boys with her brother-in-law and went back to her village at Parakan Onje, Ajibarang.|$|E
5|$|The CIA put {{the plan}} into motion in late 1952. A {{freighter}} {{that had been}} borrowed from the UFC was specially refitted in New Orleans and loaded with weapons {{under the guise of}} agricultural machinery, and set sail for Nicaragua. However, the plan was terminated soon after: accounts of its termination vary. Some sources state that the State Department discovered the plan when a senior official was asked to sign a certain document, while others suggest that Somoza was indiscreet. The eventual outcome was that Secretary of State Dean Acheson called off the operation. The CIA continued to support Castillo Armas; it paid him a monthly retainer of 3000 U.S. dollars, <b>and</b> <b>gave</b> <b>him</b> <b>the</b> resources to maintain his rebel force.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} {{night on}} Raw, Lesnar challenged Goldberg {{to a final}} match at WrestleMania 33. On the February 6 episode of Raw, Goldberg would accept Lesnar's challenge whilst also being named number one contender for Kevin Owens' Universal Championship, which he won at Fastlane thus turning his match with Lesnar into a title match. At WrestleMania 33, Lesnar beat Goldberg to win his fifth world title in WWE and {{the first man to}} have won both the WWE Championship and Universal Championship. Lesnar also became the second person to kick-out from Goldberg's Jackhammer <b>and</b> <b>gave</b> <b>him</b> <b>the</b> first clean singles loss of his professional wrestling career. After several weeks of feuding, Lesnar's first title defense came at the inaugural Great Balls of Fire event on July 9, 2017, where he successfully retained against Samoa Joe, before defeating him a second time for the title at a live event.|$|E

5|$|Skanderbeg's {{view of the}} {{situation}} worsened with news coming from Albania, which strengthened his opinion that his time in Italy was {{becoming more and more}} irrational. His pessimism grew once he found out that Venice was now pressuring Paul into refusing Skanderbeg aid since they wished {{to put an end to}} the war and capitulate Krujë. During the first days of February, news arrived from the Republic of Ragusa that the campaign was nearing its end and that if the necessary actions were not brought up to speed, Albania would fall along with Venice's possessions. Skanderbeg's requests for proper aid were continually rejected on the basis that Italy's peace must first be secured and instead Paul ordered Ferdinand to award to Skanderbeg what tribute would have been given to Rome. Skanderbeg lost all hope and decided to return to Albania before pleas from several cardinals convinced to stay, offering aid from their own pockets and hope in persuading Paul. A third consistory was convened on 13 February 1467 which, like the other two, came to nothing regarding aid to Skanderbeg. Skanderbeg thus began his departure from Rome. Paul met with Skanderbeg <b>and</b> <b>gave</b> <b>him</b> <b>the</b> authority to pull 7,500 ducats from Ferdinand's aforementioned tribute to Rome. This amount had not been gathered, however, and Paul thus offered Skanderbeg 2,300 ducats. Skanderbeg departed from Rome on 14 February and soon received news from Albania: the war was nearing its end and needed Skanderbeg to return; an Ottoman force sent to defeat the League of Lezhë definitively, however, had been defeated. He met with Giosafat Barbaro in Scutari, the Venetian provveditore in Albania Veneta, where he gathered help from Venetian nobles.|$|E
