5|$|Hydrogen is {{sometimes}} placed <b>above</b> lithium, <b>above</b> carbon, <b>above</b> fluorine, <b>above</b> both lithium and fluorine (appearing twice), or left floating <b>above</b> {{the other elements}} and not assigned to any group in the periodic table.|$|E
5|$|A {{permanent}} asymmetric moon {{dust cloud}} exists around the Moon, created by small particles from comets. Estimates are 5 tons of comet particles strike the Moon's surface each 24 hours. The particles strike the Moon's surface ejecting moon dust <b>above</b> the Moon. The dust stays <b>above</b> the Moon approximately 10 minutes, taking 5 minutes to rise, and 5 minutes to fall. On average, 120 kilograms of dust are present <b>above</b> the Moon, rising to 100 kilometers <b>above</b> the surface. The dust measurements {{were made by}} LADEE's Lunar Dust EXperiment (LDEX), between 20 and 100 kilometers <b>above</b> the surface, during a six-month period. LDEX detected an average of one 0.3 micrometer moon dust particle each minute. Dust particle counts peaked during the Geminid, Quadrantid, Northern Taurid, and Omicron Centaurid meteor showers, when the Earth, and Moon, pass through comet debris. The cloud is asymmetric, more dense near {{the boundary between the}} Moon's dayside and nightside.|$|E
5|$|A valley exit jet is a strong, down-valley, {{elevated}} {{air current}} that emerges <b>above</b> {{the intersection of}} the valley and its adjacent plain. These winds frequently reach a maximum of 20m/s (45mph or 72km/h) at a height of 40–200 m <b>above</b> the ground. Surface winds below the jet may sway vegetation, but are significantly weaker.|$|E

5|$|Apart {{from the}} depth and {{consistent}} nature of the alluvium, Mummy Cave is also characterized by extreme dryness. The pointed shape of the cliff <b>above</b> prevents rain and meltwater from percolating through the rock to the cave, {{and there are no}} vertical joints in the rock <b>above.</b>|$|E
5|$|As noted <b>above,</b> the Dyson sphere {{originated}} in fiction, {{and it is}} a concept that has appeared often in science fiction since then. In fictional accounts, Dyson spheres are most often depicted as a Dyson shell with the gravitational and engineering difficulties of this variant noted <b>above</b> largely ignored.|$|E

5|$|Between {{the large}} pendentives {{that support the}} vault are windows, six {{on each side of}} the chapel. There were two more windows in each end of the chapel, now closed, and those <b>above</b> the High Altar covered by the Last Judgement. <b>Above</b> each window is an arched shape, {{referred}} to as a lunette and <b>above</b> eight of the lunettes at the sides of the chapel are triangular spandrels filling the spaces between the side pendentives and the vault, the other eight lunettes each being below one of the corner pendentives.|$|E

5|$|Decimal {{fractions}} can {{be added}} by a simple modification of the <b>above</b> process. One aligns two decimal fractions <b>above</b> each other, with the decimal point in the same location. If necessary, one can add trailing zeros to a shorter decimal {{to make it the}} same length as the longer decimal. Finally, one performs the same addition process as <b>above,</b> except the decimal point is placed in the answer, exactly where it was placed in the summands.|$|E
5|$|Defining {{the top end}} of a clarinet's {{range is}} difficult, since many {{advanced}} players can produce notes well <b>above</b> the highest notes commonly found in method books. G6 is usually the highest note clarinetists encounter in classical repertoire. The C <b>above</b> that (C7 i.e. resting on the fifth ledger line <b>above</b> the treble staff) is attainable by advanced players and is shown on many fingering charts, and fingerings as high as A7 exist.|$|E

In contrast, in Great Britain George had to govern through Parliament.|$|E
5|$|In New York City, {{more than}} 90% {{of the workers}} and {{visitors}} {{who died in the}} towers had been at or <b>above</b> the points of impact. In the North Tower, 1,355 people at or <b>above</b> the point of impact were trapped and died of smoke inhalation, fell or jumped from the tower to escape the smoke and flames, or were killed in the building's eventual collapse. The destruction of all three staircases in the tower when Flight 11 hit made it impossible for anyone <b>above</b> the impact zone to escape. 107 people below the point of impact died as well.|$|E
