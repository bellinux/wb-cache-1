5|$|Enthusiasm {{for game}} {{distribution}} ebbed, <b>and</b> <b>CD</b> Projekt's founders {{wondered if the}} company should continue as a distributor or a game developer after Dark Alliances cancellation. With the game cancelled and its code owned by CD Projekt, the company planned {{to use them to}} develop their first original game. They intended to develop a game series based on Andrzej Sapkowski's Wiedźmin books (which were popular in Poland) and the author accepted the company's development proposal. The franchise rights had been sold to a Polish mobile game studio, but the studio had not worked on anything related to the franchise <b>and</b> <b>CD</b> Projekt acquired the rights to the Wiedźmin franchise.

40|$|Numerical {{taxonomy}} and cladistic {{analysis of}} 19 species of Camellia L. were performed using floral morphology containing continuous and discrete units. The current study mostly supports the classifications of 19 species as proposed in previous works. In addition, it also agrees with combining the following species together: <b>C.</b> oleifera <b>and</b> <b>C.</b> vietnamensis; <b>C.</b> sasanqua <b>and</b> <b>C.</b> hiemalis; <b>C.</b> brevistyla <b>and</b> <b>C.</b> puniceiflora; <b>and</b> <b>C.</b> grijsii <b>and</b> <b>C.</b> shensiensis. Further, we propose that C. maliflora {{be recognized as}} a variety of <b>C.</b> sasanqua, <b>and</b> <b>C.</b> phaeoclada is best placed in sect. Paracamellia. Moreover, we conclude that these species can be combined: <b>C.</b> tenii <b>and</b> <b>C.</b> miyagii; <b>and</b> <b>C.</b> confusa <b>and</b> <b>C.</b> fluviatilis. Our study indicates that the numerical taxonomy and cladistic analysis based on morphological characters of floral organ is useful in species classification, and this technique appreciated in sect. Oleifera and sect. Paracamellia can be used for identification and classification of other taxa...|$|R
