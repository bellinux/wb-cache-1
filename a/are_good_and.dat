5|$|Initially {{contracted}} {{by fellow}} demon hunter Lady, Dante {{has come to}} stop Sanctus’ plan. And with his longtime partner Trish undercover in the Order as the mysterious Gloria, they help lead Nero to discover the truth himself, whereupon he forges a mysterious connection to Yamato, which chooses to aid him in battle. Following a final confrontation against Dante, Dante ultimately decides that Nero's intentions <b>are</b> <b>good,</b> <b>and</b> he allows Nero to keep Yamato for the time being; finally sealing their alliance. Using his newfound power {{in the wake of}} Credo’s betrayal, Nero is able to help Credo turn against The Order after Sanctus successfully captures himself and Kyrie to use as leverage. Though Credo eventually gives his life in a vain attempt to set things right, Dante and Trish promise him that they will save Kyrie and Nero.|$|E

Although not ideally suited to the one-day game, Yallop's ODI figures <b>are</b> <b>good</b> <b>and</b> he played in the World Cups of 1979 and 1983 and toured India in 1984.

(For example, Lowrie unfortunately did not include gemmae sketches for the new pygmy sundews.) The photography is excellent—as in his first two volumes Lowrie skillfully uses depth-of-field and background choices to highlight the plants. The addition of microphotographs is welcome.|$|E
25|$|The {{kings of}} the {{northern}} Kingdom of Samaria are uniformly bad, permitting the worship of other gods and failing to enforce the worship of Yahweh alone, and so Yahweh eventually allows them to be conquered and dispersed among {{the peoples of the}} earth; and strangers rule over their remnant in the northern land. In Judah some kings <b>are</b> <b>good</b> <b>and</b> enforce the worship of Yahweh alone, but many are bad and permit other gods, even in the Holy Temple itself, and at length Yahweh allows Judah to fall to her enemies, the people taken into captivity in Babylon, the land left empty and desolate, and the Holy Temple itself destroyed.|$|E

25|$|Castoriadis {{emphasized}} the need of societies to legitimize their laws or explain, in other words, why their laws <b>are</b> <b>good</b> <b>and</b> just as they claim them to be. Most traditional societies did that through religion, believing that their laws were given by a super-natural ancestor or god and therefore must be true. Modern capitalist societies legitimize their system (capitalism) through 'reason', claiming it makes 'logical sense'. Castoriadis observes that nearly all such efforts are tautological in that they legitimize a system through rules defined by the system itself. So just like the Old Testament and the Koran claim that 'There is only one God, God', capitalism first defines logic as the maximization of utility and minimization of cost, and then bases its own legitimacy on its effectiveness to meet this criterion.|$|E

Preserve and save this year from all evil and from all kinds of destroyers and from all sorts of punishments: and establish for it good hope and as its outcome peace. Spare it and have mercy upon it and all of its harvest and its fruits, and bless it with rains of favor, blessing, and generosity; and let its issue be life, plenty, and peace as in the blessed good years; for Thou, O Eternal, <b>are</b> <b>good</b> <b>and</b> does good and blesses the years.

25|$|At B5, Taylor {{sang and}} played guitar and bass {{on his first}} solo album, Feelings <b>Are</b> <b>Good</b> (<b>And</b> Other Lies), working with {{collaborator}} Steve Jones of the Sex Pistols. The home-grown album was marketed by mail order, and sold its CDs directly via the website. The music and vocals were generally rough and raw, much more akin to grunge and punk music than to Duran Duran, while the lyrics reflected Taylor's chaotic personal life and his ongoing divorce from de Cadenet. He participated in writing an album for the reunited Power Station in late 1996, but his personal problems forced him {{to withdraw from the}} project, which went on to record with Bernard Edwards on bass and toured with a hired bass player. Increasing creative differences within Duran Duran, his move to Los Angeles and a desire to focus on his solo work also led Taylor to reconsider his place in that band. In January 1997 he announced at a Duran Duran fan convention that he was leaving the band.|$|E

5000|$|The dilemma can be {{modified}} to apply to philosophical theism, where {{it is still the}} object of theological and philosophical discussion, largely within the Christian, Jewish, and Islamic traditions. As German philosopher and mathematician Gottfried Leibniz presented this version of the dilemma: [...] "It is generally agreed that whatever God wills <b>is</b> <b>good</b> <b>and</b> just. But there remains the question whether it <b>is</b> <b>good</b> <b>and</b> just because God wills it or whether God wills it because it <b>is</b> <b>good</b> <b>and</b> just; in other words, whether justice and Goodness are arbitrary or whether they belong to the necessary and eternal truths about the nature of things." ...|$|R

500|$|Describing {{the general}} {{tone of the}} show, Teri Fitsell of The New Zealand Herald {{explains}} that [...] "South Park is a vicious social satire that works by spotlighting not the immorality of these kids but their amorality, and contrasting it with the conniving hypocrisy of the adults who surround them." [...] The humor of the show comes from the disparity between the cute appearance of the characters and their crude behavior. However, Parker and Stone said in an early interview that the show's language is realistic. [...] "There are so many shows where little kids <b>are</b> <b>good</b> <b>and</b> sweet, and it's just not real... Don't people remember what they were like in third grade? We were little bastards." ...|$|E

500|$|Ade Irwansyah, {{writing for}} Tabloid Bintang, {{notes that the}} film is a [...] "microcosm" [...] of Indonesia, which has {{numerous}} religious groups that often come into conflict. Irwansyah writes that Bramantyo intended for viewers {{to think of the}} religious conflicts that happen daily, and how to deal with differences in culture and beliefs, while Bramantyo has called the film his own personal interpretation of the country's religious situation. The film critic Eric Sasono noted this was apparent from the film's tagline, [...] "Is it still important that we are different?", and suggested that Bramantyo feared that Indonesia was becoming a monolithic state. According to Sasono, the conflict in ? is settled when the characters begin believing that all religions <b>are</b> <b>good,</b> <b>and</b> all praise God; thus, all religious conflict would end if people were to accept other beliefs.|$|E

[...] Erlewine wrote that These Are Special Times is [...] "an especially successful holiday album since Dion wisely balances" [...] popular carols ("Blue Christmas," [...] "The Christmas Song," [...] "Feliz Navidad") with new songs ("I'm Your Angel," [...] "Don't Save It All for Christmas"), hymns ("Adeste Fideles," [...] "Ave Maria"), and Christmas songs with a distinct religious theme ("The Prayer," [...] "O Holy Night")." ...|$|E
500|$|... "The hope, {{first and}} foremost, {{was to put}} this on people’s radar. Apart from the UN and a few newsreaders who mention this every year, people don’t even know this day exists.

Contributing something positive doesn’t have to be a lifelong commitment; it can just be daily gestures. So, it was about giving the whole issue perspective... One video and a message aren't going to save everything. But when you say things together, maybe the message will be heard and hopefully will provoke action. Inherently people <b>are</b> <b>good,</b> <b>and</b> inherently people are distracted and somewhat lazy, so it comes down to how do you get people’s attention." ...|$|E

500|$|On her new album, {{entitled}} Stripped, Aguilera enlisted a {{wide range}} of songwriters and producers, including Alicia Keys, Scott Storch, and Linda Perry. Perry {{was one of the biggest}} influences to Aguilera during the making of the album. The singer stated, [...] "She taught me that imperfections <b>are</b> <b>good</b> <b>and</b> should be kept because it comes from the heart. It makes things more believable and it's brave to share them with the world." [...] Keys was featured on the track [...] "Impossible", which was recorded at Electric Lady Studios in New York City. Another notable producer is Storch; he wrote and produced a total of seven songs from Stripped, including two singles. He stated that during the making of Stripped, Aguilera was one of his friends that he cared most. However, Storch did not produce her fifth studio album Back to Basics (2006), which started a feud between the two artists, which was stated by Aguilera in one of the track from Back to Basics, [...] "F.U.S.S.".|$|E
500|$|Glasse set out {{her views}} of French cuisine in the book's introduction: [...] "I have indeed given {{some of my}} Dishes French Names to {{distinguish}} them, because they are known by those names; And where there is great Variety of Dishes, and a large Table to cover, so there must be Variety of Names for them; and it matters not whether they be called by a French, Dutch, or English Name, so they <b>are</b> <b>good,</b> <b>and</b> done with as little Expence as the Dish will allow of." [...] An {{example of such a}} recipe is [...] "To à la Daube Pigeons"; a daube is a rich French meat stew from Provence, traditionally made with beef. Her [...] "A Goose à la Mode" [...] is served in a sauce flavoured with red wine, home-made [...] "Catchup", veal sweetbread, truffles, morels, and (more ordinary) mushrooms. She occasionally uses French ingredients; [...] "To make a rich Cake" [...] includes [...] "half a Pint of right French Brandy", as well as the same amount of [...] "Sack" [...] (Spanish sherry).|$|E

[...] Linda Holmes wrote that [...] "After spending most of the book using actual reporting to flesh out the facts, Ortved largely turns the floor over to himself for the part of the book in which he describes the creative decline of the show and tries to figure out whose fault it is by not infrequently simply declaring, among other things, which episodes <b>are</b> <b>good</b> <b>and</b> which are bad, sometimes without explaining himself at all." [...] Michael C. Lorah felt that Ortved's criticism of the later seasons was [...] "disconcerting", noting that [...] "It's not that he's wrong, but it seems unnecessary and at times even petty when cast against his own fawning over the undeniably massive influence of the show on current pop culture and comedy." ...|$|E
