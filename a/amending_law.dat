The Civil Rights Act of 1964 Title VII states: [...] "No person in the United States shall on the grounds of race, color, or national origins, be excluded from participation in, or denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination." [...] In Budinsky v. Corning Glass Works, an employee of Slavic origin was fired after 14 years for speaking up about name-calling and anti-Slavic discrimination by his supervisors. The judge ruled that the statute did not extend beyond [...] "race" [...] and the employment discrimination suit was dismissed because he was therefore not part of a protected class. In the District of Columbia, Kurylas v. U.S. Department of Agriculture, a Polish American bringing suit over equal opportunity employment was told by the court that his case was invalid, as [...] "only nonwhites have standing to bring an action". Poles were also snubbed by the destruction of their Poletown East, Detroit, community in 1981, when eminent domain by corporations triumphed against them in court and displaced their historic town.

40|$|In 2011, the Indonesian Parliament enacted Law 8 of 2011 <b>amending</b> <b>Law</b> 24 of 2003 on the Indonesian Constitutional Court. The {{amendment}} {{was intended to}} limit the Court’s jurisdiction {{after a period of}} sustained activism. The Court responded by declaring substantial parts of the <b>amending</b> <b>law</b> constitutionally invalid. This dissertation examines the timing and nature of this unsuccessful ‘attack’ on the Court’s authority and the reasons behind the apparent ease with which the Court was able to thwart it. Two broad sets of theorisations of judicial power are tested: those that focus on external factors or background political conditions, and those that focus on internal factors or the issue of judicial agency. The dissertation’s central finding is that no single theorization adequately accounts for the events of 2011. Rather, a combination of theoretical perspectives is required. From 2003 - 2008, the Court’s first Chief Justice, Jimly Asshiddiqie, exploited the window of opportunity provided by the groundswell of popular support for constitutionalism in Indonesia to build the Court’s public reputation. His successor, Mahfud MD, was appointed to the Court on promises of returning it to its original jurisdiction. Instead, Mahfud MD pushed the Court in an even more activist direction, dispensing with Asshiddiqie’s careful, scholarly style and introducing a ‘substantive justice’ approach that further exacerbated the Court’s relationship with the political branches. That change explains the timing of the 2011 attack. The Court’s capacity to resist the attack, in turn, was a function of the fragmentation of Indonesian party politics. While {{it was one thing to}} construct the political coalition required to pass the 2011 reforms, it was another to amend the Constitution to counteract the Court’s decisions. While the Court emerges from this story as an apparently strong institution, its somewhat dogmatic stance on judicial independence leaves cause for concern. Paradoxically, the Court’s very success in contributing to the strengthening of Indonesia’s constitutional democracy means that it needs to develop a new understanding of judicial independence, one that is more sensitive to democratic preferences. The thesis concludes by explaining this idea and speculating about the future trajectory of Indonesian constitutional politics...|$|E
40|$|The {{title of}} the thesis is "The data-boxes as a {{delivery}} method in civil proceedings". The thesis describes the significance of data-boxes in civil proceedings and deals with electronization of the legal institute of delivery. Delivery constitutes {{one of the basic}} legal institutes of civil proceedings which has undergone many changes in recent years. The key source of law for the given topic is law No. 99 / 1963 Coll., the Civil Procedure Code, as amended, especially by the <b>amending</b> <b>law</b> No. 7 / 2009 Coll., which has introduced obligatory use of the data-box-system in civil proceedings, and law No. 300 / 2008 Coll., on the Electronic Acts and Authorized Document Conversion, as amended, which has incorporated data-boxes into our legal system. The aim of the thesis is the analysis and subsequent comparison of the advantages of delivery via data-boxes. The thesis compares and evaluates various methods of delivery - delivery by means of a delivering body and by means of the public data network, i. e. particularly by means of an e-mail with electronic signature and by means of a data-box. The thesis is divided into seven chapters. The introductory chapter explains the term delivery within the framework of civil proceedings.

40|$|Not only {{played an}} {{important}} role as the guardian of constitution, the Constitutional Court is also functioned as the guardian of ideology, Pancasila. It means that Pancasila should be used as the basis to examine, nullify and to decide the Constitutionality of laws in Indonesia. This research critically analyses: (i) Why do Pancasila, the Indonesian rechtsidee, should be used as a measuring instrument or as a reviewing tools on the process of constitutional review in the Constitutional Court; (ii) Precedents or decided cases that used Pancasila as the basis to determine the constitutionality of a particular law (especially a judicial review of Acts in the area of politics, economic, social and religion during 2003 - 2013); (iii) The best formula to ensure the Constitutional Court to always use Pancasila as the main basis for judicial review of laws. This research is based on positivism paradigm. A doctrinaire approach is utilized to address the research questions and to reach the objectives of this research. Additionally, a deductive analysis is used in this research. This work has found that: First, there are convincing facts that Pancasila as the national principle was born on 1 June 1945 when Soekarno gave speech in front of BPUPK general assembly. Pancasila was not born on 18 August 1945 at the same time with the ratification of the Constitution (UUD 1945) since the legal position of Pancasila and the Constitution is not equal. Pancasila should be used as a measuring instrument for the Constitutional Court to review the constitutionality of every law considering the legal position of Pancasila as the rechtsidee of Indonesia that has regulatory function to determine the fairness of a particular law. Second, during 2003 - 2013 there are three types of Court decisions from Pancasila perspective: decisions without consider Pancasila as a measuring instrument, decision that not only mentioned articles in the Constitution but also stated about the value of Pancasila but the value of Pancasila are not clearly mentioned as a measuring instrument; and decision that clearly used Pancasila as a measuring instrument. Third, the best formula to ensure the Constitutional Court to always use Pancasila as the main basis for judicial review are by judicial interpretation and by <b>amending</b> <b>Law</b> regarding Constitutional Court...|$|E

40|$|The {{present study}} is on one side devoted to the {{question}} of the legitimacy and constitutionality of the restrictions for violent video games within the framework of the regulatory youth media protection system as well as the penal prohibition of depicted violence in Germany. On the other side it is interested in the more actual legal policies to further restrict such games, too. Insofar such restrictions are generally legitimtated with the allegation that violent video games could yield both directly and indirectly aggression-encouraging effects in the most negative sense, the current body of the violent video games effects research is analysed critically in the first part of the study: Initially it is argued that the discipline as a whole in the light of relatively unelaborated, implausible media violence effects models, an as incoherent as equivocal state of research and most grave (endemic) problems (e. g. with the measuring of the media violence exposure or the operationalizing of aggressive behaviour, physical arousal, aggressive cognitions, emotions and a desensitization to real violence) hasn’t (adequately) investigated the effects of violent video games on the players yet. Theoretical and practical nothing speaks for (practically relevant) harmful effects of such games, too, so that prohibitive measures against the same can’t be legitimated with such effects. Against this background the second part of the study deals with the concrete measures for the protection of minors and the general public against violent video games regarding their legitimacy and constitutionality, i. e. the indexing procedure of the Federal Review Board for Media Harmful to Minors (BPjM), the age rating procedure of the Supreme State Youth Authorities (OLJB) and the penal prohibition of depicted violence according to § 131 StGB. Not only is the legitimacy of the individual indexing decisions and confiscatory orders, but is the constitutionality of the indexing procedure and of the § 131 StGB altogether questioned. It is demonstrated, too, that even the in strictly legal terms voluntary age rating procedure for violent video games, which shall be published for adult players only, shows sings of a constitutionally prohibited censorship; the Pan European Game Information (PEGI) -system is discussed as an alternative. The third and last part of the study addresses the development of the political debates on violent video games in Germany especially within the decade following the so called Erfurt massacre (26. April 2002). The focus is on a discussion of three problems: (1) The draft law for improving the youth protection (JuSchVerbG) tabled by the Bavarian state government in February 2007 after the so called Emsdetten school shooting (20. November 2006), which remains to be the only concrete draft for tightenings of the Youth Protection Act (JuSchG) and a new penal prohibition of depicted violence especially for video games (§ 131 a StGB). (2) The research report no. 101 by the Criminological Research Institute of Lower Saxony (KFN), a spiritus rector for the Bavarian draft and the debate on the whole, which wanted to analyse the appropriateness of the age ratings for violent video games by the German Entertainment Software Self-Regulation Body (USK). (3) The 1 st Youth Protection Act <b>Amending</b> <b>Law</b> (1. JuSchGÄndG), i. e. the actual reform of the JuSchG. Due to the discussed problems of the German youth media protection against violent video games a liberalization of the same finally is put up for renegotiatio...|$|E
