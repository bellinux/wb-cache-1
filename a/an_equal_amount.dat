5|$|A fluffernutter {{is made by}} {{spreading}} peanut butter on a slice of bread, then spreading <b>an</b> <b>equal</b> <b>amount</b> of marshmallow fluff on another slice and finally combining them to form a sandwich. Variations of the recipe include wheat bread instead of white, Nutella hazelnut spread instead of or in addition to peanut butter, {{and the addition of}} sweet ingredients like bananas or savory and salty ingredients like bacon. The Fluffernutter itself is often seen as a variation on the peanut butter and jelly sandwich. Though often seen as a food for children, the Fluffernutter recipe has been adapted to appeal to adult tastes. For example, a New York caterer serves a Fluffernutter hors d'oeuvre in a toasted ice cream cone with a spoon of peanut butter and torched marshmallow fluff on top.|$|E

5|$|An {{independent}} study revealed {{the water to}} be radioactive and potentially dangerous to drink, initially surrounding the project with controversy. Jordan's Ministry of Water and Irrigation has stated that the radioactivity {{is not a problem}} because the water is to be diluted with <b>an</b> <b>equal</b> <b>amount</b> of water from other sources, although it remains disputed if this would be enough to bring the water up to standards. The Ministry said the {{independent study}} was inaccurate, as it did not test water from any of the wells that will be used in the project. The President of the Jordanian Geologists Association Bahjat Al Adwan stated that the radiation is present in the water in the form of Radon, and thus dissipates harmlessly when the water is exposed to air on the surface.|$|E
5|$|In the Sahara, 332 {{plant species}} have been {{recorded}} as food plants of the dromedary. These include Aristida pungens, Acacia tortilis, Panicum turgidum, Launaea arborescens and Balanites aegyptiaca. The dromedary eats Acacia, Atriplex and Salsola when they are available. Feral dromedaries in Australia prefer Trichodesma zeylanicum and Euphorbia tannensis. In India, dromedaries are fed with forage plants such as Vigna aconitifolia, V. mungo, Cyamopsis tetragonolaba, Melilotus parviflora, Eruca sativa, Trifolium species and Brassica campestris. Dromedaries keep their mouths open while chewing thorny food. They use their lips to grasp the food and chew each bite 40 to 50 times. Its long eyelashes, eyebrows, lockable nostrils, caudal opening of the prepuce and a relatively small vulva help the camel avoid injuries, especially while feeding. They graze for 8–12 hours per day and ruminate for <b>an</b> <b>equal</b> <b>amount</b> of time.|$|E
5|$|Reportedly, the Lower East Side Conservancy {{was trying}} to raise an {{estimate}} $4.5 million for repairs, {{with the intent of}} turning the building into an educational center. It was granted $215,000 by the United States Department of Education and was promised <b>an</b> <b>equal</b> <b>amount</b> by the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation. Several years earlier the Conservancy had also been promised a total of $980,000 from New York State, the City Council, Mayor Bloomberg, and the Manhattan Borough President's office, but had yet to receive most of the city funds. The group was also trying to raise $400,000 from private donors for {{the first phase of the}} renovation, which would secure the structure and roof. Led by Greenbaum, Beth Hamedrash Hagodol was down to around 20 regularly attending members, and was sharing facilities with a congregation on Henry Street.|$|E

5|$|The {{division}} of labor for shooting the starship models was decided early on by effects cameramen Peter Daulton and Pat Sweeney. There was <b>an</b> <b>equal</b> <b>amount</b> of work if one crew did all the Enterprise shots and another did the Bird of Prey, Klingon cruiser and Excelsior shots, so the cameramen flipped to decide who worked on which models. Old and new techniques were applied to shooting the models. To make sure the vessels were seamlessly inserted into star fields in post-production, the crew filmed second passes in overexposed yellow light, which reduced light spillage onto the bluescreen backdrop. The yellow overcast was removed by filtration in the optical process, with the result being a clean edge around the ships.|$|E
5|$|The {{prosthetic}} phase begins {{once the}} implant is well integrated (or has a reasonable assurance {{that it will}} integrate) and an abutment is in place to bring it through the mucosa. Even {{in the event of}} early loading (less than 3 months), many practitioners will place temporary teeth until osseointegration is confirmed. The prosthetic phase of restoring an implant requires <b>an</b> <b>equal</b> <b>amount</b> of technical expertise as the surgical because of the biomechanical considerations, especially when multiple teeth are to be restored. The dentist will work to restore the vertical dimension of occlusion, the esthetics of the smile, and the structural integrity of the teeth to evenly distribute the forces of the implants.|$|E

5|$|As {{early as}} the Han dynasty, when the state needed to {{accurately}} measure distances traveled throughout the empire, the Chinese relied on a mechanical odometer. The Chinese odometer was a wheeled carriage, its gearwork being driven by {{the rotation of the}} carriage's wheels; specific units of distance—the Chinese li—were marked by the mechanical striking of a drum or bell as an auditory signal. The specifications for the 11th century odometer were written by Chief Chamberlain Lu Daolong, who is quoted extensively in the historical text of the Song Shi (compiled by 1345). In the Song period, the odometer vehicle was also combined with another old complex mechanical device known as the south-pointing chariot. This device, originally crafted by Ma Jun in the 3rd century, incorporated a differential gear that allowed a figure mounted on the vehicle to always point in the southern direction, no matter how the vehicle's wheels turned about. The concept of the differential gear that was used in this navigational vehicle is now found in modern automobiles in order to apply <b>an</b> <b>equal</b> <b>amount</b> of torque to a car's wheels even when they are rotating at different speeds.|$|E
5|$|Iraq {{achieved}} {{their second}} Gulf Cup of Nations in the 1984 edition in Muscat, with Ammo Baba as the team's manager. Saeed scored the two Iraqi goals in Iraq's first match in a 2–1 victory, scored a hat-trick in Iraq's 4–0 win over Saudi Arabia, and also scored two goals in Iraq's fifth match against Kuwait in a 3–1 win. Iraq were a match away from winning the cup but, unfortunately, Iraq lost against Qatar in a 1–2 defeat. Iraq and Qatar had <b>an</b> <b>equal</b> <b>amount</b> of points which {{led them to}} having a final decisive match. On 28 March, a final match between them was played. The two teams drew in the whole 90 minutes of the game. In extra time, Iraq scored a goal and Qatar leveled, taking the match to penalties where Iraq defeated Qatar 4–3. Saeed was the top goalscorer of the tournament with 7 goals and had received the Best Player of the Tournament award along with Oman's Ghulam Khamis.|$|E
