In 2003, their influence waned and Labour became the largest party on the council. They formed a coalition with the LibDems and Greens. At the May 2007 local elections, Labour lost ground to the Greens in Lancaster and the MBIs in Morecambe, resulting in no overall control, with all parties represented in a PR administration. The 2011 elections saw Labour emerge as the largest party. They reached a joint <b>administrative</b> <b>arrangement</b> with the Greens.|$|E

50|$|Different facts {{showed that}} the {{government}} is requested by the people to give regional autonomy for Sidama people. There are several justifications for this argument. First, Sidama constitutes about 20% of the total population in the Southern region, with a significant economic contribution to the central government. Second, the 40 smaller ethnic groups in the region belong to the three main socio-cultural and linguistic groups namely, Cushitic groups: Sidama, Alaba, Tambaro, Qewenna, Danta (Dubamo), Maraqo, Konso, Hadiya, Kambata; Omotic groups: Wolayta, Gamo, Gofa, Dawuro, Konta, etc., and Semitic group: Gurage. After the fall of the military regime in 1991, the Transitional Government endorsed five separate regions within the current SNNPR. These regions were established based on socio-cultural, linguistic and economic similarities. They followed similar <b>administrative</b> <b>arrangement</b> made by the previous regime shortly before its fall. Sidama, Gedeo and Burji belonged to one of the five independent regions within the current SNNPR. However, those five regions were dissolved without consultation with the peoples of the region. Third, proper <b>administrative</b> <b>arrangement</b> is essential for administrative efficacy, effective delivery of social and economic services and broader economic development.|$|E

In 1992, the Interior Ministry established the Nahal Iron regional council, which included Ein as-Sahla and seven other villages. The locals objected to this <b>administrative</b> <b>arrangement,</b> and sought independent municipal status for each village. To allay local concerns, the Interior Ministry established an investigative committee to examine other options, and in 1996, decided to split the regional council into two local councils, Ma'ale Iron and Basma, which includes Ein as-Sahala.|$|E
50|$|As for sovereignty, neither Hungary nor Croatia {{who were}} {{claiming}} their sovereignty over Fiume were sovereign states nor subjects of international law, that status pertained only to Austria - {{that is to}} the Habsburg monarchy.

In the analysis done by La Difesa and reported on several articles it was inadmissible for Fiume {{to be treated as}} a colony since its status within the Habsburg Empire or the Hungarian Kingdom was comparable to that of Hungary.|$|E
