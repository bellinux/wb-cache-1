As <b>a</b> <b>best-seller,</b> the novel heavily influenced later protest literature.|$|E
5|$|Both {{men were}} incarcerated in Landsberg Prison, where Hitler soon {{began work on}} his memoir, Mein Kampf ("My Struggle"), which he {{dictated}} to fellow prisoners Hess and Emil Maurice.

5|$|The Man {{with the}} Golden Gun is the twelfth novel (and thirteenth book) of Ian Fleming's James Bond series. It was first {{published}} by Jonathan Cape in the UK on 1 April 1965, {{eight months after the}} author's death. The novel was not as detailed or polished as the others in the series, leading to poor but polite reviews. Despite that, the book was <b>a</b> <b>best-seller.</b>|$|E
5|$|A Night to Remember {{was only}} Lord's second book {{but was a}} huge success, thanks {{in no small part}} to the {{aggressive}} advertising campaign carried out by R & W Holt following its launch in November 1955. The book also undoubtedly benefited from the popularity of the 1953 film Titanic and other coverage of the disaster that was published around the same time. Within two months of its publication, the book had sold 60,000 copies and remained listed as <b>a</b> <b>best-seller</b> for six months. The Ladies' Home Journal and Reader's Digest both published condensed versions and it was selected in June 1956 by the Book of the Month Club. The first paperback edition was published by Bantam Books in October 1956.|$|E
5|$|According to series artist Keiji Inafune, Dr. Wily's Revenge was {{the first}} Mega Man game to be {{outsourced}} to a developer separate from Capcom. Critical reception for the game has been favorable, and most sources have denoted it as a competent, if excessively difficult, portable version of the popular NES series. Dr. Wily's Revenge was <b>a</b> <b>best-seller</b> and spawned four sequels of its own on the Game Boy, many of which follow its trend of reusing elements from their home console counterparts. In 2011, Dr. Wily's Revenge was made available as a Virtual Console launch title on Japan's Nintendo eShop for the Nintendo 3DS. It also appeared on PAL region and North American eShops later that year.|$|E

In 1929 Knight was made a Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire, and in June 1931 she received an honorary degree from St. Andrews University. Knight {{was elected president of}} the Society of Women Artists in 1932 and held the post until 1967. In 1936 she became the first woman since 1769 elected to full membership of the Royal Academy. The same year Knight published her first autobiography, Oil Paint and Grease Paint, which became <b>a</b> <b>best-seller,</b> with four hardback editions followed in 1941 by a Penguin paperback printing.|$|E
5|$|A {{supporter}} of the evangelical wing of the Church of England, Wilberforce believed that the revitalisation of the Church and individual Christian observance {{would lead to a}} harmonious, moral society. He sought to elevate the status of religion in public and private life, making piety fashionable in both the upper- and middle-classes of society. To this end, in April 1797, Wilberforce published , on which he had been working since 1793. This was an exposition of New Testament doctrine and teachings and a call for a revival of Christianity, {{as a response to the}} moral decline of the nation, illustrating his own personal testimony and the views which inspired him. The book proved to be influential and <b>a</b> <b>best-seller</b> by the standards of the day; 7,500copies were sold within six months, and it was translated into several languages.|$|E
5|$|In the 1960s, Feynman began {{thinking}} of writing an autobiography, {{and he began}} granting interviews to historians. In the 1980s, working with Ralph Leighton (Robert Leighton's son), he recorded chapters on audio tape that Robert transcribed. The book was published in 1985 as Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman! and became <b>a</b> <b>best-seller.</b> The publication of the book brought {{a new wave of}} protest about Feynman's attitude toward women. There had been protests over his alleged sexism in 1968, and again in 1972. It did not help that Jenijoy La Belle, who had been hired as Caltech's first female professor in 1969, was refused tenure in 1974. She filed suit with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, which ruled against Caltech in 1977, adding that she had been paid less than male colleagues. La Belle finally received tenure in 1979. Many of Feynman's colleagues were surprised that he took her side. He had gotten to know her, and both liked and admired her.|$|E

5|$|Nigella Lucy Lawson (born 6 January 1960) is an English journalist, broadcaster, {{television}} personality, gourmet, {{and food}} writer. She {{is the daughter}} of Nigel Lawson, a former Chancellor of the Exchequer, and Vanessa (née Salmon) Lawson, whose family owned the J. Lyons and Co. food and catering business. After graduating from Lady Margaret Hall, Oxford University, Lawson started work as a book reviewer and restaurant critic, later becoming the deputy literary editor of The Sunday Times in 1986. She then embarked upon a career as a freelance journalist, writing for a number of newspapers and magazines. In 1998, she brought out her first cookery book, How to Eat, which sold 300,000 copies and became <b>a</b> <b>best-seller.</b> She wrote her second book in 2000, How to Be a Domestic Goddess, which won her the British Book Award for Author of the Year.|$|E
5|$|Robert Baden-Powell {{had become}} a {{national}} hero during the Boer War {{as a result of}} his successful defence of the town of Mafeking, which was under siege from October 1899 to May 1900. The Mafeking Cadets, made up of local boys aged 12 to 15, acted as messengers throughout the siege, and had impressed him with their resourcefulness and courage. Baden-Powell had also published a number of popular books on military scouting, including Aids to Scouting for NCOs and Men, published in 1899. Though written for non-commissioned officers, it became <b>a</b> <b>best-seller</b> and was used by teachers and youth organisations. In the years after the war Baden-Powell broached the idea of a new youth organisation with a number of people, including William Alexander Smith, founder of the Boys' Brigade, with whom he discussed setting up a Boys Brigade Scouting achievement. To test his ideas while writing Scouting for Boys, Baden-Powell conceived of an experimental camp, creating a program to take place on Brownsea Island during the summer of 1907. He invited his lifelong friend, Major Kenneth McLaren, to attend the camp as an assistant.|$|E
5|$|Galland's time in Argentina {{was running}} out. For his services, {{he was awarded}} a pilot's wings badge and the title Honorary Argentine Military Pilot. Later that year Galland left South America. By that time, he had begun writing his autobiography, The First and the Last (Die Ersten und die Letzten), and it was {{published}} in 1954 by Franz Schneekluth. It was <b>a</b> <b>best-seller</b> in 14 languages and sold three million copies. It was very well received by the RAF and USAF as a frank and honest statement. Galland returned to Germany and was approached by a commissioner for Chancellor Konrad Adenauer for the purpose of joining the new Bundeswehr now that West Germany was to join NATO as a military power. Galland joined with Steinhoff, and went over the proposal. However, France objected to West Germany's proposal for a pan-European defence pact and chose to go its own way. That changed the organisation structure of the German armed forces. Galland got on with his life as the months rolled by. In 1956 Josef Kammhuber, the leader of the German Nachtjagdgeschwader (Night Fighter Wings) during the war, became the new commander-in-chief of the Bundesluftwaffe. Galland now accepted he had been turned down as a potential leader of, or in, the new air force. Galland suspected that it was more to do with his technically illegal departure from Germany in 1948 and his association with Argentina, a state which was on poor terms with the United States, the dominant partner of NATO.|$|E
