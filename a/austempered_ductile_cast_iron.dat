After subjecting the <b>austempered</b> <b>ductile</b> <b>cast</b> <b>iron</b> to subzero treatment, the austenite was transformed into martensite, and the volume fraction of the martensite increased as the subzero treatment temperature decreased.

Automated analysis of electron backscatter diffraction patterns can be used to determine maps of the crystal phases and the orientation of the grains in the microstructure. Conventional metallographic techniques cannot reliably identify the prior austenite grains in austempered microstructures. This can be done by EBSD analysis of the retained austenite. EBSD combines the benefits of bulk sample analysis, such as large analysed area, with the benefits normally associated with transmission electron microscopy (high resolution, crystal phase identification and orientation measurement). In parallel with X-ray diffraction, it is a useful tool for retained austenite research.

The load-displacement curve for ductile fractured specimens shows that the load (P) steeply increases to the peak value (Pmax; about 10 kN) and then decreases, similar to {{that in the case of}} instrumented Charpy impact test. Even though the absorbed energy of fracture process was in the lower shelf region, the notch-bend strength did not decrease with increasing the strain rate as far as the fracture origin is ductile.

The transformation of retained austenite is also substantiated with an increase of hardness and in several cases the decrease of retained austenite content was directly determined with X-ray quantitative phase analysis.

In this paper the effect of processing type and partial austenitization time on the mechanical properties of Ni-Mo low alloyed ductile cast iron are investigated. In the process of partial austenitization, increasing the heating time above 400 seconds, results in an increase in both the ultimate tensile strength and yield strength. However, impact strength is reduced by an increase in heating time of up to 600 seconds.

Other 16 samples (8 previously annealed) were austempered in two-step process at 245 oC and 300 oC for 5 and 30 minutes, respectively. The samples were analyzed initially by optical microscopy and mechanical tests (Brinell hardness and Vickers microhardness), and after were machined in an universal lathe for machinability tests. The mechanical lathe was instrumented in relation to active power and cutting time, and the machinability evaluation was made with reference to cutting force, cutting pressure and material removal index criteria. The samples austempered at 300 oC for 30 minutes (with annealing) showed the best machinability, impact resistance and lowest hardness in the one-step process. However, the samples in the same temperature and time (with annealing) showed the worst machinability, highest hardness and lowest impact resistance.

The NO 2 - ion can be reduced to nitrogen compounds and these compounds may be absorbed on the surface of graphite. Therefore, since nitrite ion needs to oxidize the surface of matrix and needs to passivate the galvanic corroded area and since it is absorbed on the surface of graphite, a greater amount of corrosion inhibitor needs to be added to <b>ductile</b> <b>cast</b> <b>iron</b> compared to carbon steel. The passive film of carbon steel and <b>ductile</b> <b>cast</b> <b>iron,</b> formed by NaNO 2 addition showed N-type semiconductive properties and its resistance, is increased; the passive current density is thus decreased and the corrosion rate is then lowered. In addition, the film is mainly composed of iron oxide due to the oxidation by NO 2 - ion; however, regardless of the alloys, nitrogen compounds (not nitrite) were detected at the outermost surface but were not incorporated in the inner oxide...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Low thermal {{expansion}} <b>ductile</b> <b>cast</b> <b>iron</b> {{is expected to}} become a new structural material with high dimensional stability against temperature change. We tried {{to develop a new}} low {{thermal expansion}} <b>ductile</b> <b>cast</b> <b>iron</b> by means of adding C and Si to Superinver alloy. In this study we prepared four kinds of <b>ductile</b> <b>cast</b> <b>irons</b> whose Co contents vary from 0 % to 12 %, and investigated about the effects of Co content and solution-treatments on several main characteristics such as coefficient of thermal expansion and mechanical properties. The results obtained are as follows: With increase of Co content the amount of martensite increases but this martensite can be inverse-transformed to austenite totally or greatly by solution-treatment followed with water-quenching. In the case of Co content less than some 9 % the ability of relatively larger plastic deformation can be expected in inverse-transformed austenite...|$|R

The detailed results are presented in two reports. This first report deals with the fatigue performance and comparison of forged steel and <b>ductile</b> <b>cast</b> <b>iron</b> crankshafts. The second report deals with analyses of weight and cost reduction for optimization of the forged steel crankshaft. ii...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} of the research {{was to determine the}} influence of boron on the crystallization process and microstructure of <b>ductile</b> <b>cast</b> <b>iron.</b> In the case of <b>ductile</b> <b>cast</b> <b>iron</b> it is a vital issue because even as little as trace presence of boron changes the properties of <b>ductile</b> <b>cast</b> <b>iron</b> in a significant way. With the use of a new ATD- 4 (TDA) tester and CRYSTALDIGRPAH converter it was possible to measure the crystallization process parameters of the same alloy with four different contents of boron in one mould. Four samples with different boron contents were extracted, their microhardness was measured and quantitative analysis of microstructure was conducted. Obtained results allowed to state that with increasing content of boron the amount of graphite precipitates decreases, the amount of pearlite precipitates increases, the shape of graphite precipitates deteriorates and hardness increases. It is also planned to perform additional testings with boron contents between previously tested values...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} the optimization of the grinding parameters of <b>ductile</b> <b>cast</b> <b>iron</b> in wet conditions {{and with the}} minimum quantity lubrication (MQL) technique. The objective of this project is to investigate the performance of <b>ductile</b> <b>cast</b> <b>iron</b> during the grinding process using the MQL technique and to develop artificial neural network modeling. In this project we used the DOE method to perform the experiments. Analysis of variance with the artificial neural network method is used to investigate significant effects on the performance characteristics and the optimal cutting parameters of the grinding process. <b>Ductile</b> <b>cast</b> <b>iron</b> {{was used in this}} experiment and the ethanol glycol was applied in the conventional method and compared with the MQL method. During conventional grinding, a dense and hard slurry layer was formed on the wheel surface and the performance of the <b>ductile</b> <b>cast</b> <b>iron</b> was very low, threatening the ecology and health of the workers. In order to combat the negative effects of conventional cutting fluids, the MQL method was used in the process to formulate modern cutting fluids endowed with user- and eco-friendly properties. Aluminum oxide was used as the grinding wheel (PSA- 60 JBV). This model has been validated by the experimental results of <b>ductile</b> <b>cast</b> <b>iron</b> grinding. Each method uses two passes - single-pass and multiple-pass. The prediction model shows that depth of cut and table speed have the greatest effect on the surface roughness and material removal rate for the MQL technique with multiple-passes by showing improved surface roughness, preventing workpiece burning and enabling a more friendly environment. Thus, various other parameters need to be added for further experiments, such as the wheel speed, distance from the wheel to the workpiece zone contact, and the geometry of the nozzle...|$|R
