30|$|In Fig. 10, the histograms {{mean the}} <b>average</b> <b>traffic</b> <b>density</b> {{in the parking}} lane and its {{adjacent}} lane of the 4 road segments. The line plots mean the quantity of conflicts in these lanes. From Fig. 10, it can be recognized that the quantity of traffic conflicts which happen in the parking lane and its medial adjacent lane is significantly affected by curb parking. Generally, the traffic density of curb parking road segment is lower then conventional road. If the traffic density {{of this kind of}} road segment is higher frequently, the curb parking should not be allowed. Moreover, a relationship between the quantity of conflicts and the traffic densities of the two lanes above can be seen: for the situation of low traffic density, just like this case, when the traffic density is larger, the quantity of traffic conflicts in the lane increases. In addition, when the density is larger, the speed of conflict increasing is fester as well, resulting in poorer traffic safety.|$|E
40|$|This paper evaluates {{strategies}} for operating buses on signal-controlled arterials using special lanes {{that are made}} intermittently available to general traffic. The advantage of special bus lanes, intermittent or dedicated, is that they free buses from traffic interference; the disadvantage is that they disrupt traffic. We find that bus lanes with intermittent priority (BLIPs), unlike dedicated ones, do not significantly reduce street capacity. Intermittence, however, increases the <b>average</b> <b>traffic</b> <b>density</b> at which the demand is served, {{and as a result}} increases traffic delay. These delays are more than offset by the benefits to bus passengers as long as traffic demand does not exceed by much the maximum flow possible on the non-special lanes; the smaller the excess the better. BLIPs are not intended for roadways nearing or in excess of capacity. The main factors determining whether an intermittent system saves time are: the traffic saturation level; the bus frequency; the improvement in bus travel time achieved by the special lane; and the ratio of bus and car occupant flows. In some scenarios where a dedicated bus lane could not be operated, a BLIP can save to bus and car occupants together as much as 20 persons-min of travel per bus-km. The required conditions for this to happen are quite particular. Typical savings are smaller. Formulae are given. ...|$|E
40|$|Wireless {{access to}} the Internet is {{expected}} to be very valuable for both individuals and the society. However, advances in transmission technology alone may not be sufficient to support the anticipated demand for higher data rates and greater traffic volumes. Fortunately, a low cost means of increasing capacity is to match wireless infrastructures to the non-uniform spatial distribution of traffic. Multiple radio access standards and base station classes, having different cost and performance, could be combined to create a heterogeneous wireless access network which provides the required data rates and capacities where needed (or desired). In the case of a non-uniform spatial distribution of traffic, the traditional technical performance measures of coverage and capacity are no longer adequate for comparing the cost effectiveness of different network configurations. Therefore in this dissertation, we propose a general methodology to evaluate the total cost and capacity of heterogeneous networks. Moreover, a few promising capacity expansion paths, including multiple cellular standards as well as wireless local area network technologies, have been evaluated for urban scenarios. While results show that macro cellular systems are the most cost effective solution for a uniform spatial traffic distribution, a complementary hot spot layer is for non-uniform traffic distributions required even at a moderate <b>average</b> <b>traffic</b> <b>density.</b> The incremental cost, which is modest as compared to current revenues for operators, is shown to be quite insensitive to the choice of technology used in the hot spot layer. Moreover, if high data rates are demanded on the uplink, then dedicated indoor solutions are required. Which in turn implies that network providers should exploit existing broadband infrastructures to provide the required backhaul connectivity. In order to address non-urban scenarios, especially in sparsely populated areas, where there is insufficient revenue to support multiple independent networks, a multi-operator network sharing network architecture should be employed. This dissertation proposes a priority queuing method to achieve fair sharing of radio resources between operators in such an architecture. QC 2010073...|$|E

However, although such proposals may be effective in particular cases, as yet there is no generic framework that provides efficient support for the wide range of partitioning and aggregation operations that a spatio-temporal database management system might be expected to support over both stored and derived data. This paper proposes an algorithmic framework that can be applied to many different forms of aggregation, and presents the results of performance studies on an implementation of the framework.

40|$|Abstract Background Adverse birth {{outcomes}} such as {{low birth}} weight and premature birth have been previously linked with exposure to ambient air pollution. Most studies relied on {{a limited number of}} monitors in the region of interest, which can introduce exposure error or restrict the analysis to persons living near a monitor, which reduces sample size and generalizability and may create selection bias. Methods We evaluated the relationship between premature birth and birth weight with exposure to ambient particulate matter (PM 2. 5) levels during pregnancy in Massachusetts for a 9 -year period (2000 – 2008). Building on a novel method we developed for predicting daily PM 2. 5 at the spatial resolution of a 10 x 10 km grid across New-England, we estimated the average exposure during 30 and 90 [*]days prior to birth as well as the full pregnancy period for each mother. We used linear and logistic mixed models to estimate the association between PM 2. 5 exposure and birth weight (among full term births) and PM 2. 5 exposure and preterm birth adjusting for infant sex, maternal age, maternal race, mean income, maternal education level, prenatal care, gestational age, maternal smoking, percent of open space near mothers residence, <b>average</b> <b>traffic</b> <b>density</b> and mothers health. Results Birth weight was negatively associated with PM 2. 5 across all tested periods. For example, a 10 [*]μg/m 3 increase of PM 2. 5 exposure during the entire pregnancy was significantly associated with a decrease of 13. 80 [*]g [95 % confidence interval (CI) [*]=[*]− 21. 10, - 6. 05] in birth weight after controlling for other factors, including traffic exposure. The odds ratio for a premature birth was 1. 06 (95 % confidence interval (CI) [*]=[*] 1. 01 – 1. 13) for each 10 [*]μg/m 3 increase of PM 2. 5 exposure during the entire pregnancy period. Conclusions The presented study suggests that exposure to PM 2. 5 during the last month of pregnancy contributes to risks for lower birth weight and preterm birth in infants. </p...|$|E
40|$|Wireless access {{networks}} today consume 0. 5 {{percent of the}} global energy. Rapidly growing demand for new services and ubiqutious connectivity, will further increase the energy consumption. This situation imposes a big challenge for mobile operators not only due to soaring cost of energy, but also increasing concern for global warming and sustainable development. This thesis focuses on the energy efficiency issue at the system level and studies how to incorporate energy-awareness into the design of future wireless {{access networks}}. The main contributions have been given {{in the areas of}} energy efficiency assessment, architectural and operational solutions, and total cost of investment analysis. The precise evaluation of energy efficiency is the first essential step to determine optimized solutions where metrics and models constitute the two key elements. We show that maximizing energy efficiency is not always equivalent to minimizing energy consumption {{which is one of the}} main reasons behind the presented contradictory and disputable conclusions in the literature. Further we indicate that in order to avoid the debatable directions, energy efficient network design problems should be formulated with well defined coverage and capacity requirements. Moreover, we propose novel backhaul power consumption models considering various technology and architectural options relevant for urban and rural environments and show that backhaul will potentially become a bottleneck in future ultra-high capacity wireless access networks. Second, we focus on clean-slate network deployment solutions satisfying different quality of service requirements in a more energy efficient manner. We identify that the ratio between idle- and transmit power dependent power consumption of a base station as well as the network capacity requirement are the two key parameters that affect the energy-optimum design. While results show that macro cellular systems are the most energy efficient solution for moderate <b>average</b> <b>traffic</b> <b>density,</b> Hetnet solutions prevail homogeneous deployment due to their ability to increase the capacity with a relatively lower energy consumption and thus enable significant energy savings in medium and high capacity demand regions. Moreover, we investigate the energy saving potential of short-term energy aware management approach, i. e., cell DTX, taking advantage of low resource utilization in the current networks arising from strict QoS requirements. With the help of developed novel quantitative method, we show that Cell DTX brings striking reduction in energy consumption and further savings are achievable if the networks are designed taking into account the fact that network deployment and operation are closely related. Finally, we develop a general framework for investigating the main cost elements and for evaluating the viability of energy efficient solutions. We first reveal the strong positive impact of spectrum on both energy and infrastructure cost and further indicate that applying sustainable solutions might also bring total cost reduction, but the viability highly depends on unit cost values as well as the indirect cost benefits of energy efficiency. Results obtained in this dissertation might provide guidelines for the network designers to achieve future high-capacity and sustainable wireless access networks. QC 20140505 </p...|$|E

Methods: We examined the association between <b>traffic</b> <b>density</b> and childhood leukemia risk for three time periods: birth, time of diagnosis, and lifetime average, based on complete residential history in a case-control study. Cases were rapidly ascertained from participat-ing hospitals in northern and central California between 1995 and 2002. Controls were selected from birth records, individually matched on age, sex, race, and Hispanic ethnicity. <b>Traffic</b> <b>density</b> was calculated by estimating total vehicle miles traveled per square mile within a 500 -foot (152 meter) radius area around each address. We used conditional logistic regression analyses to account for matching factors and to adjust for household income. Results: We included 310 cases of acute lymphocytic leukemias (ALL) and 396 controls in our analysis. The odds ratio for ALL and residential <b>traffic</b> <b>density</b> above the 75 th percentile, compared with subjects with zero <b>traffic</b> <b>density,</b> was 1. 17 [95 % confidence interval (95 % CI), 0. 76 - 1. 81) for residence at diagnosis and 1. 11 (95 % CI, 0. 70 - 1. 78) for the residence at birth.

40|$|Abstract—Monitoring {{the state}} of our roadways has become {{increasingly}} important in order to better manage traffic congestion. Sophisticated traffic management systems are being developed that are able to process both static and mobile sensor data that provide traffic information for the roadway network. In addition to typical traffic data such as flow, <b>density,</b> and <b>average</b> <b>traffic</b> speed, there is now strong interest in environmental factors such as greenhouse gas and pollutant emissions from traffic. It is now possible to combine real-time traffic data along with instantaneous emission models to estimate these environmental measures in real-time. In this paper, we describe a system that can more accurately determine <b>average</b> <b>traffic</b> fuel economy, CO 2, CO, HC, and NOx emissions using a computer vision-based methodology that also incorporates energy/emission profiles from the comprehensive modal emissions model CMEM and EPA’s MOVES emission factor database. The vision system provides information not only on <b>average</b> <b>traffic</b> speed, <b>density,</b> and flow, but also on individual vehicle trajectories and recognized vehicle categories. The vehicle trajectories for the specific identified categories are used by the emissions model to predict environmental parameters. This estimation process provides far more dynamic and accurate environmental information compared to static emission inventory estimation models...|$|R

We report findings from a human-in-the-loop study conducted in the Airspace Operations Laboratory (AOL) at the NASA Ames Research Center. During four afternoons in early 2010, fifteen active and recently retired air traffic controllers and supervisors controlled high levels of traffic in a highly automated environment during three-hour long scenarios, For each scenario, twelve air traffic controllers operated eight sector positions in two air traffic control areas and were supervised by three front line managers, Controllers worked one-hour shifts, were relieved by other controllers, took a 3 D-minute break, and worked another one-hour shift.

One-to-all communication (broadcasting) can also be performed in only [n/ 2] steps, yielding a 50 % improvement in broadcasting time over that of the standard hypercube. All routing algorithms are simple and easy to implement. Correctness proofs for the algorithms are given.

Participants tended to drive significantly faster when <b>traffic</b> <b>density</b> was low, compared {{to the situation in}} which <b>traffic</b> <b>density</b> was high, thus showing a larger decrease directly after the information provision.|$|R
50|$|As {{has been}} made {{consistently}} in 2001, the A1 is also in operation, shifted {{back some of the}} traffic on the originally planned as a transit route highway. This is very well documented by the counting stations of Wünnewil and bull (overland routes), which in 2000 were measured in the average daily volume of 29,000 vehicles, 2002 just over 22,000 vehicles (about 20% less than two years before). The highest <b>traffic</b> <b>densities</b> on the A12 were recorded 2004, in the Fribourg area, with an <b>average</b> daily <b>traffic</b> of 29,000 vehicles.|$|R
30|$|With R= 500 m, Ncs=Nhn is 12 {{vehicles}} for low <b>traffic</b> <b>density,</b> 36 {{vehicles for}} medium <b>traffic</b> <b>density</b> and 66 vehicles for high <b>traffic</b> <b>density.</b> The unsaturated analytical MAC of safety messages for uncoded and repetition coding scenarios have been verified using a network simulator simulation in [20]. However, {{it has not}} been studied yet for raptor codes, which we will cover in the next section of this article.|$|R
40|$|In recent decades, {{vehicular}} networks or intelligent {{transportation systems}} are being increasingly investigated {{and used to}} provide solutions to next generation traffic systems. Road <b>traffic</b> <b>density</b> estimation provides important information for road planning, intelligent road routing, road traffic control, vehicular network traffic scheduling, routing and dissemination. The ever increasing number of vehicles equipped with wireless communication capabilities provide new means to estimate the road <b>traffic</b> <b>density</b> more accurately and in real time than traditionally used techniques. In this thesis, we consider two research problems on road <b>traffic</b> <b>density</b> estimation. First research problem is the estimation algorithm design of road <b>traffic</b> <b>density</b> where each vehicle estimates its local road <b>traffic</b> <b>density</b> using some simple measurements only, i. e. the number of neighboring vehicles. A maximum likelihood estimator of the <b>traffic</b> <b>density</b> is obtained based on a rigorous analysis of the joint distribution {{of the number of}} vehicles in each hop. Analysis is also conducted on the accuracy of the estimation and the amount of neighborhood information required for an accurate road <b>traffic</b> <b>density</b> estimation. Simulations are performed which validate the accuracy and the robustness of the proposed density estimation algorithm. Secondly, we consider the problem of road <b>traffic</b> <b>density</b> estimation based on the use of a stochastic geometry concept—contact distribution function, which obtains density estimates by a probe vehicle traveling within objective area, measuring the inter-contact vehicle numbers and lengths. A maximum likelihood estimator of the <b>traffic</b> <b>density</b> is applied. Analysis is also performed on the accuracy of the estimation and the small sample sizes’ bias has been corrected. Simulations are performed which validate the accuracy and robustness of the proposed density estimation algorithm. Access is restricted to staff and students of the University of Sydney.

30|$|The <b>traffic</b> <b>density</b> {{information}} is distributed to its {{neighborhoods in the}} intersection network through I 2 I communication. AIM mechanism in an intersection manager will coordinate <b>traffic</b> <b>density</b> of itself and its neighborhoods to compute the control output and update the state, using consensus algorithm.|$|R
40|$|In {{the recent}} days, the <b>traffic</b> <b>density</b> {{has risen to}} a very high level. Increase in <b>traffic</b> <b>density</b> has {{resulted}} in spending long hours in traffic for short distances. The solution can be implemented by automating the traffic signals using the concept of “Autonomic Computing”-computing systems that can manage themselves. Using the characteristics of Autonomic computing and Wireless Sensor Networks [8], the traffic signals can me made smarter and intelligent by making it react to the <b>traffic</b> <b>density</b> and thus increasing or decreasing the waiting time accordingly...|$|R
30|$|An {{intersection}} {{acts as the}} centralized controller. Basically, it determines safe trajectories {{and manages}} vehicles crossing an intersection [32, 33]. Using traffic flow model, an intersection manager collects the <b>traffic</b> <b>density</b> on the street network because it is countable and uses to indicate the traffic condition. In practice, an intersection manager knows the <b>traffic</b> <b>density</b> on a street by counting a number of requested messages received from V 2 I communication. We do not concern the <b>traffic</b> <b>density</b> of outgoing vehicles because they are normally the incoming vehicles to other intersections.|$|R
30|$|Wj is {{the weight}} for {{candidate}} one-hop neighbor {{intersection of the}} current intersection; Dp 1 is closeness of candidate neighbor intersection with respect to destination. TD 1 is the <b>traffic</b> <b>density</b> between current intersection and next neighbor intersection. WK is the weight for candidate neighbor intersection of the one-hop neighbor intersection; Dp 2 is closeness of candidate two-hop neighbor intersection w.r.t destination. TD 2 is the <b>traffic</b> <b>density</b> between the one-hop neighbor intersection and its next neighbor intersection. Alpha (α) and beta (β) are the weighting factors for distance and <b>traffic</b> <b>density</b> respectively between the intersections. By adjusting the value of α and β, we can make tradeoff between distance and <b>traffic</b> <b>density</b> when selecting next intersection. <b>Traffic</b> <b>density</b> is {{an important source of}} giving connectivity for dispatching packet towards the destination. H 1 and H 2 are the weighting factors for candidate one-hop neighbor intersection and two-hop neighbor intersection, respectively. An adjustment in the value of H 1 and H 2 can make tradeoff between the importance of candidate one-hop neighbor intersection and two-hop neighbor intersection.|$|R
40|$|Using {{the fact}} that {{effective}} wireless range decraise in inverse function of local <b>traffic</b> <b>density,</b> we show that a variable <b>traffic</b> <b>density</b> impacts the curvature of paths in a dense wireless ad hoc network {{the same way a}} variable optical density bends light paths. We set up the general laws that paths must satisfy in presence of <b>traffic</b> flow <b>density.</b> We quantify the effect and we give some example of configurations treated analytically...|$|R
30|$|Also, {{the link}} {{utilization}} has related with realistic <b>traffic</b> <b>density.</b> Hence, the statistics regarding user’s <b>traffic</b> <b>density</b> levels per zone [13, 25] on the above metric {{will come back}} to use in this metric again. All the Internet backbone nodes have a traffic load on each node to simulate the traffic generated.|$|R
