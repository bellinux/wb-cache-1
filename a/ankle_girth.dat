40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to clear the change of the shape of the calf by {{contraction}} of triceps surae muscle. For the female university students, with the aid of moire topography, it was taken some anthropometrical measurements of the shape of the calf at the time of passive contraction and at the time of active contraction. The result is as follows: 1) The calf girth increased with contraCtion of triceps surae muscle. 2) The <b>ankle</b> <b>girth</b> decreased at the time of passive contraction, and it increased at the time of active contraction on the contrary. 3) The position of the most projected point of the calf moved upward with contraction of triceps surae muscle. 4) Though the muscle venter swelled with contraction of triceps suraemuscle, the quantity of projection of the calf decreased relatively...|$|E
40|$|This study {{examined}} the prediction of scale mass via anthropometric skeletal measurements in a sample from 537 elite Caucasian athletes and controls. Eighteen skeletal dimensions were measured and log transformed, and along with gender, regressed against mass. The prediction was optimised as follows: Ln mass = 0. 6071 (ln head girth) + 0. 65303 (ln femur breadth) + 0. 65062 (ln <b>ankle</b> <b>girth)</b> + 0. 26724 (ln chest breadth) + 0. 17492 (ln A-P chest depth) + 0. 32479 (ln femur length) + 0. 31324 (biacromial breadth) - 5. 4611. Standard error of the estimate = 8. 3 %, R 2 (adjusted) = 84. 5 %, P< 0. 0001. High correlation between skeletal dimensions and body mass showed any of the variables could usefully predict mass, although the standard error of the estimate was higher (11. 7 – 14. 9 %). Variability in prediction accuracy is likely to result from differing muscle mass in this athletic sample, where muscle development is optimised for sports performance. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} the effects of intermittent pneumatic compression (IPC) in patients with chronic venous insufficiency of the lower limbs. Twenty female patients were randomly allocated into two groups, an IPC group and a control group. Both groups received physiotherapy which consisted of lower extremity exercises, walking exercise on a treadmill and manual massage of the lower extremities for a period of four weeks. In addition, patients in IPC group were treated with a sequential pneumatic compression device for thirty minutes daily, five days a week. Assessment parameters were leg pain at rest, leg pain during ambulation and limb heaviness according to visual analog scale (VAS); limb girth measurements at the ankle, calf and thigh levels; maximal and mean blood flow velocities at the popliteal vein measured by a Duplex ultrasound. VAS scores decreased significantly after treatment in both groups but the differences were significantly more in IPC group. There was a significant decrease in limb girth at all levels in IPC group while the only significant change in the control group occurred at the ankle. Although decrease in <b>ankle</b> <b>girth</b> was more in IPC group than the control group, the difference was not statistically significant. Statistically significant increase in maximum and mean popliteal vein blood velocities were observed in IPC group while no significant change occurred in the control group. These data suggest that IPC is effective in patients with chronic venous insufficiency...|$|E
40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{quasi-experimental}} pilot {{study was to explore}} the effects of a reformer Pilates program on the anthropometry, body composition, and somatotype of active adult women after a short non-exercise period. Twenty-eight women (mean age: 40. 21 ± standard deviation of 8. 12 years old) with one to three years of reformer Pilates experience participated in the study. The women participated in a reformer Pilates program for 16 weeks (one hour, twice per week) after 4 weeks of detraining (summer holidays) in 2012. The International Society for the Advancement of Kinanthropometry full profile was assessed before and after the intervention program. Significant decreases (p ≤ 0. 05) from pre- to post-program were observed for triceps, iliac crest, supraspinale, abdominal, front thigh and medial calf skinfold thicknesses, six and eight skinfold thickness sums, forearm and <b>ankle</b> <b>girths,</b> waist/hip ratio, endomorphy, and fat mass. Significant increases (p ≤. 05) were observed for corrected arm, corrected calf girths, and muscle mass. Generally, women showed a mesomorphic endomorph (endomorphy predominant) and mesomorph–endomorph (endomorphy and mesomorphy predominant) in the pre- and posttests, respectively. In conclusion, the practice of reformer Pilates was associated with healthy changes in anthropometric parameters, body composition, and somatotype in Pilates-experienced women after 4 weeks of no physical exercise...|$|R
40|$|Human {{physique}} classification by somatotype {{assumes that}} adult humans are geometric similar to each other. However, this assumption {{has yet to}} be adequately tested in athletic and nonexercising human populations. In this study, we assessed this assumption by comparing the mass exponents associated with girth measurements taken at 13 different sites throughout the body in 478 subjects (279 athletic subjects, and 199 nonexercising controls). Corrected girths which account for subcutaneous adipose tissue at the upper arm, thigh, and calf sites, and which simulate muscle circumference, were also calculated. If subjects are geometrically similar to each other, girth exponents should be approximately proportional to M(1 / 3), where M is the subjects' body mass. This study confirms that human adult physiques are not geometrically similar to each other. In both athletic subjects and nonexercising controls, body circumferences/limb girths develop at a greater rate than that anticipated by geometric similarity in fleshy sites containing both muscle and fat (upper arms and legs), and less than anticipated in bony sites (head, wrists, and <b>ankles).</b> Interestingly, head <b>girths</b> appear to remain almost constant, irrespective of subjects' body size/mass. The results also suggest that thigh muscle girths of athletes and controls increase at a greater rate than that predicted by geometric similarity, proportional to body mass (M(0. 439) and M(0. 377), respectively). These systematic deviations from geometric similarity have serious implications for the allometric scaling of variables such as energy expenditure, oxygen uptake, anaerobic power, and thermodynamic or anthropometric studies involving individuals of differing size...|$|R
40|$|The {{purposes}} of this study were to determine the anthropometric characteristics and physical performance in selected measurements of elite Chinese women volleyball players, identify the differences between the anthropometry and performance profiles of the players at different playing positions, and examine the correlations between the anthropometric characteristics and the physical performance of the players. Thirty anthropometric indices and four physical performance indices were measured for 100 volleyball players recruited from the top eight teams of 2007 - 8 national championship. The results revealed that most of the anthropometric indices were poorly correlated with the physical performance measurements, except that the femur biepicondylar breadth, calf girth and calf length were significantly correlated with the spring jump performance. There were significant differences among the anthropometric profiles of the players at different playing positions, especially in the body mass, stature, standing reach height, radiale-stylion length, acromiale-midstylion length, midstylion-dactylion length, iliospinale height length, tibiale-laterale height length, biacromial breadth, biilocristal breadth, transverse chest breadth and gluteal girth (all P＜ 0. 001). However, the physical performance indices of the players at different positions showed no significant differences except the spring jump performance. The average somatotype of the players was “ 3. 7 - 2. 9 - 4. 0 ”, according to the Heath-Carter anthropometric method, which indicated the type of ecto-endomorph. More specifically, the somatotype of the attackers and liberos belonged to the central type, and that of the second attackers and second setters were endomorphic ectomorph, and that of the setters were endomorph-ectomorph. Overall, the physique of elite Chinese women volleyball players appeared to be tall but well-proportioned. It is recommended that the typical anthropometric indices that should be considered in recruitment for women volleyball players include body mass, stature, sitting height, subscapular skinfold, <b>ankle</b> <b>girth,</b> forearm girth, biacromial breadth, and Achilles’ tendon length...|$|E
40|$|The {{purposes}} of this study were to determine the anthropometric characteristics of elite Chinese women volleyball players, identify the differences in the anthropometric profile and physical performance between the players at different volleyball positions, and examine the correlations between the anthropometric profile and the physical performance of the players. Thirty-one anthropometric indices and four physical performance (medicine ball throwing, running vertical jump, T shuttle run agility test and timed 20 sit ups) were measured for 100 volleyball players recruited from the top eight teams of 2007 - 2008 national championship. The average age of the players was 22. 3 ± 3. 6 (SD) years and the average training age was 9. 7 ± 4. 0 years. For the elite Chinese women volleyball players, the average values of stature, body mass, sitting height, standing reach height, and BMI were respectively 183. 6 ± 5. 8 cm, 70. 5 ± 7. 6 kg, 95. 7 ± 3. 5 cm, 236. 7 ± 7. 8 cm, and 20. 9 ± 2. 0. The overall anthropometric characteristics of these volleyball players can be described as high stature; relatively longer forearm, palm, calf and Achilles’ tendon lengths but a shorter sitting height; wider femur, biiliocristal and biacromial breadths; larger difference between relaxed and tensed arm girth, smaller wrist and ankle girths, smaller <b>ankle</b> <b>girth</b> / Achilles’ tendon length index; and smaller skinfolds. The results also revealed that most of the anthropometric variables were poorly correlated with the selected physical performance measurements, except that the biepicondylar femur breadth, calf girth and calf length indices were significantly correlated with the running jump height. There were significant differences among the anthropometric profiles of the players at different volleyball positions, especially in the indices of body mass, stature, standing reach height, radiale-stylion length, acromiale-dactylion length, midstylion-dactylion length, iliospinale height, tibiale-laterale height length, biacromial breadth, biiliocristal breadth, transverse chest breadth and gluteal girth (all P 3 ̆c 0. 001). However, the physical performance of the players at different positions showed no significant between-position difference except the running jump height. The average somatoype values of elite Chinese women volleyball players were “ 3. 7 - 2. 9 - 4. 0 ”, belonging to endomorph-ectomorph. Their somatoypes were found mainly in four of the 13 categories, with 29...|$|E
