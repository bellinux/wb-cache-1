5|$|On 25 July 1993, {{following}} Hezbollah's {{killing of}} seven Israeli soldiers in southern Lebanon, Israel launched Operation Accountability (known in Lebanon as the Seven Day War), {{during which the}} IDF carried out their heaviest artillery and air attacks on targets in southern Lebanon since 1982. The aim of the operation was to eradicate {{the threat posed by}} Hezbollah and to force the civilian population north to Beirut so as to put pressure on the Lebanese Government to restrain Hezbollah. The fighting ended when an unwritten understanding was agreed to by the warring parties. Apparently, the 1993 understanding provided that Hezbollah combatants would not fire rockets <b>at</b> <b>northern</b> Israel, while Israel would not attack civilians or civilian targets in Lebanon.|$|E

5|$|The current 63rd Street Line was {{the final}} version of {{proposals}} for a northern midtown tunnel from the IND Queens Boulevard Line to the Second and Sixth Avenue lines, which date back to the IND Second System of the 1920s and 1930s. The current plans were drawn up in the 1960s under the MTA's Program For Action. In the original 1960s plans, {{there would have been a}} station (in addition to or as an alternative to 21st Street–Queensbridge) located farther east <b>at</b> <b>Northern</b> Boulevard, one block north of the Queens Plaza station of the Queens Boulevard line.

5|$|There {{were also}} {{plans for an}} {{intermediate}} stop at the current Woodside LIRR station, and an additional 63rd Street line station <b>at</b> <b>Northern</b> Boulevard adjacent to Queens Plaza. The bypass and proposed Woodside station would have necessitated the widening of the LIRR Main Line right-of-way onto private property west of Winfield Junction, where the Main Line merges with the Port Washington Branch, and reorganization of the track layout in the Sunnyside Yards. Later proposals suggested routing the bypass directly to the Archer Avenue line via the LIRR Montauk Branch (which no longer has passenger service).|$|E
