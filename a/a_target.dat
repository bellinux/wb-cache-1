5|$|Aigle {{returned}} to Woolwich in October 1852 {{where she was}} converted to a coal hulk and receiving ship. She moved to Sheerness in September 1869 and in the following August, she became <b>a</b> <b>target</b> for torpedoes before being sold and broken up in November 1870.|$|E
5|$|Because each antenna {{was aimed}} to be {{sensitive}} primarily in a single direction, {{the length of the}} blips depended on the position of the target relative to the fighter. For instance, <b>a</b> <b>target</b> located 35 degrees above the fighter would cause the signal in the upper vertical receiver to be maximized, causing a long blip to appear on the upper trace, and none on the lower trace. Although less sensitive directly forward, both vertical antennas could see {{directly in front of the}} fighter, so <b>a</b> <b>target</b> located dead ahead caused two slightly shorter blips, one on either side of the centreline.|$|E

5|$|During the Russo-Japanese War of 1904–05, Nisshin {{participated in}} the Battle of the Yellow Sea and was damaged in the {{subsequent}} Battle of Tsushima. In addition she frequently bombarded the defenses of Port Arthur. The ship played a limited role in World War I and was used to escort Allied convoys and search for German commerce raiders in the Indian Ocean and Australasia. In 1918, Nisshin was deployed to the Mediterranean and then escorted the surrendered German submarines allocated to Japan from Britain to Japan after the war.

5|$|On 12 November 1934, Hessen was {{withdrawn}} from fleet service {{and placed in}} reserve. On 31 March 1935, Hessen was stricken from the reserve list and converted into <b>a</b> <b>target</b> ship. Her armament was removed, the hull was lengthened, and new machinery was installed. The longer hull allowed room for two additional watertight compartments, which brought the number up to 15 from the original 13. The ship's superstructure was cut down nearly entirely; Hessen retained only a single funnel, a tower foremast, and the two armored barbettes for the main battery turrets. The ship had a crew of 80, but could be operated by remote control when being used as <b>a</b> <b>target.</b>|$|E
