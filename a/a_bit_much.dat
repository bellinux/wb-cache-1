5|$|In August 1999, {{our mother}} had {{died of cancer in}} tragic {{circumstances}} while we were all enjoying ourselves at my eldest son's wedding. For my brother, her death was a catastrophe. He adored her. She had been his protector and greatest admirer since the death of our father in 1947, when Anthony was eight and I was six. When our mother died, it was as though my brother had become an orphan at age 61. Without her, he felt emotionally bereft. He lost his grip on reality. At one point, he had bought a flat in Versailles, and had entirely recreated two rooms from our late mother's house. He had used all the furniture, books and knick-knacks of our childhood in Paris. It was <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> <b>much.</b>|$|E
25|$|John Levesque, Seattle Post-Intelligencer (April 20, 2001) — Like so many {{characters}} in noir-ish {{films of the}} 1940s and 1950s, Wolfe and Goodwin are ebulliently over the top: loud, proud and full of themselves. It's <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> <b>much</b> for anyone expecting the less theatrical performances of today. And yet it fits remarkably well with today's reality programming. Wolfe, after all, is ruder than anyone on Survivor.|$|E

[...] Ryan Schreiber of Pitchfork awarded the album 7.5 out of 10, writing that [...] "Pinkerton might actually be <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> <b>much</b> for fans who were wooed with the clean production and immediately accessible sound of these guys' debut, but if given a chance, it might surprise even some anti-Weezer folk." ...|$|E

500|$|Critical {{opinion was}} divided on Aniston's {{performance}} as Claire. TV Guides Matt Mitovich wrote that Aniston [...] "looked sweet, but the role was juuuuust <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> <b>much...</b> over-the-top." [...] Jeremy Medina of Paste {{said that the}} show did not really {{seem to know what}} to do with Aniston in this episode. Tom Stempel for Slant Magazine said 30 Rock was [...] "smart enough" [...] not to make Claire resemble Aniston's former television character, Rachel, from Friends. Further in his review, Stempel said that Claire was a [...] "great choice of character" [...] for Aniston to play, and praised her for knocking the role [...] "out of the park." [...] Kerrie Murphy for The Australian was equally positive noting that Aniston fits in smoothly as Liz's former roommate. Murphy added, [...] "Not only is it a reminder that Aniston is a gifted comic actor [...] With her, the show's regular cast easily hold their own." ...|$|E
500|$|Following {{the episode}} [...] "Hairography" [...] in which Rachel is badly made-over by Kurt, Mike Hale of The New York Times noted a popular theme amongst critics for {{negatively}} highlighting the way Glee treats its female characters. He {{said that while}} he understood this stance, he generally disagreed with it as the show treats male characters equally poorly. However, he wrote that [...] "it was <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> <b>much</b> when Finn looked at Rachel in her catsuit and frizzy hair and said {{she looked like a}} 'sad clown hooker.' Come on. She looked fantastic." [...] Zap2it's Korbi Ghosh has deemed Rachel's high point on the show romancing of Finn and Puck, commenting: [...] "when we saw Rachel fall for them, she was actually relatable. Likable even. The type-A, uber-talented, self-involved know-it-all who's usually alienating her classmates let her guard down to expose a vulnerable side. And, as a bonus, we got some super solid musical performances from those awkward courtships." ...|$|E
500|$|She {{lived for}} a few months in a flat Starr owned at 34 Montagu Square, central London, but {{returned}} to Kenwood as Lennon and Ono preferred to live there instead, rather than in isolated Weybridge. Lennon and Cynthia had one last short meeting at Kenwood (with Ono alongside Lennon), where Lennon accused her of having an affair in India, saying she was no [...] "innocent little flower". McCartney visited her and Julian that year, and on the way to Kenwood he composed a song in his head which later became [...] "Hey Jude". Talking about their divorce, McCartney later said: [...] "We'd been very good friends for millions of years and I thought it was <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> <b>much</b> for them suddenly to be personae non gratae and out of my life". Cynthia recalled, [...] "I was truly surprised when, one afternoon, Paul arrived on his own. I was touched by his obvious concern for our welfare ... On the journey down he composed 'Hey Jude' in the car. I will never forget Paul's gesture of care and concern in coming to see us." [...] She was once asked if Lennon had written any songs about their time together, and answered: [...] "It was too sloppy when you were young to dedicate anything to anybody. Macho Northern men didn't do that in those days". In contrast, Lennon said he wrote the 1965 song [...] "Norwegian Wood (This Bird Has Flown)" [...] about an affair he was having, but rendered it in [...] "gobbledegook" [...] so Cynthia would not know.|$|E

500|$|Franks {{said that}} after her stint in 2008, many people {{recognised}} her {{in the street and}} asked if she would return. Scenes showing Phil and Rainie taking the drug crack cocaine in 2010 prompted over 200 complaints from viewers who felt the scenes were inappropriate. The BBC responded by saying [...] "EastEnders in no way—and at no point—glamorises or condones the use of drugs, and furthermore we took great care to avoid any demonstration on how to prepare or take drugs. [...] We took care to signal the nature of the episode's content to viewers in advance through programme publicity and billings, and the BBC Action Line was trailed following the episode for anyone affected by the issue. In addition to this, our website includes links to organisations who can offer help and advice on this issue. [...] We worked closely with drug and alcohol charities, including Addaction and DrugScope, throughout the editorial process to ensure that we handled the storyline accurately and sensitively." [...] The Daily Mail asked some viewers about the scenes, including one who said, [...] "I was shocked at the content of the episode. The graphic detail of the drug use with Phil and his friend was terrible and in view of the time that the episode was aired, entirely inappropriate. Viewers do not need to see this kind of storyline. Please, BBC, no more of these horrid storylines." [...] Other viewers said, [...] "They look like they're having a good time. They're in danger of making it look appealing." [...] Finally, [...] "It was <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> <b>much.</b> I've found EastEnders distressing over the last month." [...] The Daily Record described the scenes as 'disturbing'.|$|E

His form was down with the bat and he needed a rest." [...] Bangladesh returned to England for the ODI half of their tour. Bangladesh lost the series 2–1, but their victory in the second match was the first time Bangladesh had beaten England in international cricket. While in Europe, Bangladesh were scheduled to play two ODIs against Ireland, and one each against Scotland and Netherlands. The match against Scotland was abandoned and Bangladesh lost one match to each of Ireland and the Netherlands.|$|E

Friday singles – it's nowhere near as much fun as [...] "Good Friday" [...] or as seductive as [...] "Devil in a New Dress". Amy Sciarretto of Popcrush stated that the track was [...] "great", and that [...] "even with four rappers laying down verses on the song, it's a compact, tightly constructed tune that feels like a series of freestyle raps that flow into one another flawlessly." [...] Corban Goble of Stereogum mused that the song [...] "is a giant, lurching thing where the rappers trade bravado-filled verses around a syrup-music inspired hook." [...] Jayson Rodriguez of XXL stated that [...] "the public may have seen this idea and presentation before, but the music is still next level. It's fitting that Kanye could bring together this cast and execute the finished product this well. Still, Wednesday's spontaneous release of [...] "Cold" [...] was <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> <b>much</b> more exhilarating both musically and dramatically." [...] Josiah Hughes of Exclaim! mused that [...] "the track most likely sounds just as you'd expect, all expensive, epic-sounding production, some slowed-down samples and an aggressive synth beat.
