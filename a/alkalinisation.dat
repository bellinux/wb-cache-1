It {{has been proposed}} that both processes are critically dependent on cell <b>alkalinisation</b> due to increased Na+/H+ exchange; therefore pHi {{may be an important}} mediator of the vascular hypertrophy resulting in an increased peripheral resistance which characterises established hypertension. Resistance artery morphology followed by simultaneous recording of isometric contraction and pH were measured using a myograph in conjunction with a pH sensitive fluorescent probe and microscope capable of exciting the intracellular trapped dye at appropriate wavebands and recording the fluorescence. Mesenteric resistance arteries from the genetically hypertension prone spontaneously hypertensive rat were more alkaline than the normotensive Wistar Kyoto control. However secondary hypertension due to aortic coarctation did not result in mesenteric artery <b>alkalinisation,</b> although pHi regulation was altered. In contrast pHi and its regulation were unchanged in subcutaneous resistance arteries from the gluteal region from untreated hypertensive patients and first degree offspring of hypertensive patients compared to matched controls. Mesenteric arteries displayed anticipated pHi changes to manoeuvres which directly cause <b>alkalinisation</b> and acidification. On the other hand contraction induced intracellular acidification rather than <b>alkalinisation</b> as observed in cells grown in tissue culture conditions. These measurements of pHi carried {{out for the first time}} in human resistance arteries highlight the limitations of using animal models or surrogate cells when studying this potentially crippling vascular disorder...|$|E

40|$|Nutrient secretagogues {{activate}} mitochondria of the pancreatic beta-cell {{through the}} provision of substrate, hyperpolarisation of the inner mitochondrial membrane and mitochondrial calcium rises. We report that mitochondrial matrix pH, a parameter not previously studied in the beta-cell, also exerts an important control function in mitochondrial metabolism. During nutrient stimulation matrix pH alkalinises, monitored by the mitochondrial targeted fluorescent pH-sensitive protein mtAlpHi or (31) P-NMR inorganic phosphate chemical shifts following saturation transfer. Compared with other cell types, the resting mitochondrial pH was surprisingly low, rising from pH 7. 25 to 7. 7 during nutrient stimulation of rat beta-cells. As cytosolic <b>alkalinisation</b> to the nutrient was of much smaller amplitude, the matrix <b>alkalinisation</b> {{was accompanied by a}} pronounced increase of the DeltapH across the inner mitochondrial membrane. Furthermore, matrix <b>alkalinisation</b> closely correlates with the cytosolic ATP net increase, which is also associated with elevated ATP synthesis rates in mitochondria. Preventing DeltapH increases in permeabilised cells abrogated substrate-driven ATP synthesis. We propose that the mitochondrial pH and DeltapH are key determinants of mitochondrial energy metabolism and metabolite transport important for cell activation...|$|E

40|$|An in vivo compartmental pot {{greenhouse}} experiment involving “dwarf ” sunflower and an arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungus {{was designed}} to assess the contribution of non-AM roots (rhizosphere), AM roots and extraradical hyphae (mycorrhizosphere), or strictly extraradical hyphae (hyphosphere) on plant growth, plant metal uptake, and soil parameters using the micronutrient zinc (Zn) as a typical metal contaminant. We observed that, at high soil-Zn concentrations, the mycorrhizosphere treatments had lower Zn concentrations (especially in shoots and flowers) and a lower incidence of leaf chlorosis than the rhizosphere treatments. These phytoprotective effects {{are believed to be}} related to AM-induced biosorption processes that reduce soil metal bioavailability to delay the onset of plant metal toxicity.

40|$|Background—Chronic dietary K+ loading {{increases}} {{the abundance of}} large conductance (210 pS) apical K+ channels in surface cells of rat distal colon, resulting in enhanced K+ secretion in this epithelium. However, the factors involved in the regulation of these K+ channels are at present unclear.  Aims—To evaluate the effect of dietary K+ loading on intracellular pH {{and its relation to}} large conductance apical K+ channel activity in surface cells of rat distal colon.  Methods/Results—As assessed by fluorescent imaging, intracellular pH was higher in K+ loaded animals (7. 48 (0. 09)) than in controls (7. 07 (0. 04); p< 0. 01) when surface cells were bathed in NaCl solution, and a similar difference in intracellular pH was observed when cells were bathed in Na 2 SO 4 solution (7. 67 (0. 09) and 6. 92 (0. 05) respectively; p< 0. 001). Ethylisopropylamiloride (EIPA; an inhibitor of Na+-H+ exchange; 1 µM) decreased intracellular pH when surface cells from K+ loaded animals were bathed in either solution, although the decrease was greater when the solution contained NaCl (ΔpH 0. 50 (0. 03)) rather than Na 2 SO 4 (ΔpH 0. 18 (0. 02); p< 0. 05). In contrast, EIPA had no effect in cells from control animals. As assessed by patch clamp recording techniques, the activity of large conductance K+ channels in excised inside-out membrane patches from distal colonic surface cells of K+ loaded animals increased twofold when the bath pH was raised from 7. 40 to 7. 60. As assessed by cell attached patches in distal colonic surface cells from K+ loaded animals, the addition of 1 µM EIPA decreased K+ channel activity by 50 %, consistent with reversal of Na+-H+ exchange mediated intracellular <b>alkalinisation.</b>  Conclusion—Intracellular <b>alkalinisation</b> stimulates pH sensitive large conductance apical K+ channels in rat distal colonic surface cells as part of the K+ secretory response to chronic dietary K+ loading. Intracellular <b>alkalinisation</b> seems to reflect an increase in EIPA sensitive Na+-H+ exchange, which may be a manifestation of the secondary hyperaldosteronism associated with this model of colonic K+ adaptation. ...|$|E

40|$|Introduction: Vascular {{calcification}} (VC) {{associated to}} {{chronic kidney disease}} (CKD) is a complex phenomenon closely related to mineral bone metabolism disorders. Many are the factors implicated, as the drugs used {{in the treatment of}} CKD. Some in vitro studies suggest that electrolyte and acid–base disorders induced by haemodialysis (HD) may {{play a key role in}} VC. Methods: We analysed electrolyte and acid–base disorders that occur during an HD session in 26 patients randomly assigned to 1. 25  mM or 1. 5  mM calcium bath. Results: There is a calcium load in all the patients, independently of calcium bath concentration or basal serum calcium levels. At the end of the session, 100 % of the patients dialysed with 1. 5  mM calcium bath have calcium serum levels > 1. 3  mM. However, this only occurs in 15 % of the patients dialysed with 1. 25  mM calcium bath. During this calcium load, phosphorus levels persist uncontrolled. Besides, there is a progressive <b>alkalinisation</b> in all the patients. In the end of the session 50 % have serum bicarbonate > 30  mM and 23 % pH > 7. 5. Conclusions: During HD sessions occur electrolyte and acid–base disorders that induce VC: calcium load and alkalisation in presence of elevated phosphorus levels.

40|$|Elevations {{of sperm}} {{intracellular}} pH and Ca 2 + regulate sperm motility, chemotaxis, capacitation and the acrosome reaction, {{and play a}} vital role in the ability of the sperm cell to reach and fertilise the egg. In human spermatozoa, the flagellar voltage-gated proton channel Hv 1 is the main H+ extrusion pathway that controls sperm intracellular pH, and the pH-dependent flagellar Ca 2 + channel CatSper is the main pathway for Ca 2 + entry as measured by the whole-cell patch clamp technique. Hv 1 and CatSper channels are co-localized within the principal piece of the sperm flagellum. Hv 1 is dedicated to proton extrusion from flagellum and is activated by membrane depolarisation, an alkaline extracellular environment, the endocannabinoid anandamide, and removal of extracellular zinc, a potent Hv 1 blocker. The CatSper channel is strongly potentiated by intracellular <b>alkalinisation.</b> Since Hv 1 and CatSper channels are located in the same subcellular domain, proton extrusion via Hv 1 channels should induce intraflagellar <b>alkalinisation</b> and activate CatSper ion channels. Therefore the combined action of Hv 1 and CatSper channels in human spermatozoa can induce elevation of both intracellular pH and Ca 2 + required for sperm activation in the female reproductive tract.

40|$|The pro-survival protein Bcl-x L is {{critical}} for the resistance of tumour cells to DNA damage. We have previously demonstrated, using a mouse cancer model, that oncogenic tyrosine kinase inhibition of DNA damage–induced Bcl-xL deamidation tightly correlates with T cell transformation in vivo, although the pathway to Bcl-x L deamidation remains unknown and its functional consequences unclear. We show here that rBcl-x L deamidation generates an iso-Asp 52 /iso-Asp 66 species that is unable to sequester pro-apoptotic BH 3 -only proteins such as Bim and Puma. DNA damage in thymocytes results in increased expression of the NHE- 1 Na/H antiport, an event both necessary and sufficient for subsequent intracellular <b>alkalinisation,</b> Bcl-x L deamidation, and apoptosis. In murine thymocytes and tumour cells expressing an oncogenic tyrosine kinase, this DNA damage–induced cascade is blocked. Enforced intracellular <b>alkalinisation</b> mimics the effects of DNA damage in murine tumour cells and human B-lineage chronic lymphocytic leukaemia cells, thereby causing Bcl-x L deamidation and increased apoptosis. Our results define a signalling pathway leading from DNA damage to up-regulation of the NHE- 1 antiport, to intracellular alkalanisation to Bcl-x L deamidation, to apoptosis, representing the first example, to our knowledge, of how deamidation of internal asparagine residues can be regulated in a protein in vivo.

Both acidification and <b>alkalinisation</b> were poorly sensitive to 4, 4 ′-diisothiocyanate dihydrostilbene- 2, 2 ′-disulfonic acid, inhibitor of the anion exchanger, but sensitive to amiloride, inhibitor of the Na+/H+ exchanger.

No significant difference in resting pHi and {{in the rate of}} acidification or <b>alkalinisation</b> was observed in clones obtained from U- 2 OS cells by transfection with the MDR 1 gene and overexpressing P-glycoprotein. However, both Vmax and K′ values for intracellular [H+] of the Na+/H+ exchanger were significantly reduced in MDR 1 -transfected clones, in the absence and/or presence of drug selection, in comparison to vector-transfected or parental cell line. NHE 1, NHE 5 and at a lower extent NHE 2 mRNA were detected in similar amount in all U 2 -OS clones.

TASK- 2 is modulated by changes in cell volume and a regulation by direct G-protein interaction has also been proposed.

Distributing the products of olivine dissolution (bicarbonate, silicic acid, iron) uniformly in the global surface ocean has a maximum CDR potential of 0. 57 gC/g-olivine mainly due to the <b>alkalinisation</b> of the ocean, with a significant contribution from the fertilisation of phytoplankton with silicic acid and iron. The part of the CDR caused by ocean fertilisation is not permanent, while the CO 2 sequestered by <b>alkalinisation</b> would be stored in the ocean as long as alkalinity is not removed from the system. For high CO 2 emission scenarios the CDR potential due to the alkalinity input becomes more efficient over time with increasing ocean acidification. The alkalinity-induced CDR potential scales linearly with the amount of olivine, while the iron-induced CDR saturates at 113 PgC per century (on average ~ 1. 1 PgC yr− 1) for an iron input rate of 2. 3 Tg Fe yr− 1 (1 % of the iron contained in 3 Pg olivine).

I investigated {{the effects on}} human sperm [Ca^ 2 +]i and behaviour of CatSper channel activation (alkaline pH and progesterone) and Ca 2 +-store mobilisation (4 -aminopyridine, thimerosal) using a fluorescence plate reader and CASA. Extracellular <b>alkalinisation</b> raised pH¬i (pHi = 6. 9 and 7. 2 at pHo 7. 4 and 8. 5 respectively), caused tonic elevation of [Ca^ 2 +]i, which was partially inhibited by CatSper block and increased the proportion of hyperactivated cells (from 1. 8 ± 0. 5 to 10. 5 ± 1. 6...|$|E
40|$|AbstractOxidative {{cross linking}} of three (hydroxy) proline-rich cell wall proteins, {{known to be}} immobilised during the elicitor-induced {{oxidative}} burst in French bean cells, was modelled using peroxidases with cysteine or H 2 O 2. Further reconstitution of the homologous system was achieved with a 46 kDa bean cell-wall peroxidase using conditions known to appertain in cell walls prior to the immobilisation. Thus, cell wall <b>alkalinisation</b> and secretion of a reductant have been reconstituted by addition of apoplastic fluid to the wall proteins and the 46 kDa peroxidase with resultant cross-linking. This is the first demonstration of the oxidative cross-linking of cell wall glycoproteins without the addition of external H 2 O 2. © 1997 Federation of European Biochemical Societies...|$|E
40|$|SUMMARY Intraluminal {{duodenal}} pH {{was recorded}} using a combined miniature electrode and logged digitally every 10 or 20 seconds {{for five hours}} (basal/meal/drink) in eight control subjects and 11 patients with duodenal ulcer (five on and off treatment with cimetidine). Over the whole test {{there were no significant}} differences in duodenal mean pH or log mean hydrogen ion activity (LMHa) between control subjects and patients with duodenal ulcer, but there were significantly longer periods of duodenal acidification (pH 6) in the duodenal ulcer group compared with controls. After a meal duodenal mean pH and LMHa fell significantly in both controls and patients with duodenal ulcer, with more periods of duodenal acidification and <b>alkalinisation</b> in the duodenal ulcer group. An exogenous acid load (Coca-Cola) significantly increased the periods of duodenal acidification, and reduced <b>alkalinisation,</b> in both groups. Cimetidine significantly increased mean pH and LMHa and abolished the brief spikes of acidification in four of five patients with duodenal ulcer. Peak acid output (but not basal acid output) was significantly correlated with duodenal mean pH and LMHa but not with the periods of duodenal acidification. Smoking did not affect duodenal pH in either group. The role of gastric acid hypersecretion in duodenal ulcer disease is well established, ' but the relative importance of acid load and acidity at the site of ulceration within the duodenum 2 remains poorly documented, largely because of technical and methodological problems. 3 4 A reliable method of digitally recording intraluminal duodenal pH, under near normal conditions, has been developed 5 6 and used in control subjects and patients with duodenal ulceration...|$|E
