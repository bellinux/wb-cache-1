40|$|The present paper {{analyses}} sectoral {{impacts of}} the CEE integration with EU. Adopting a partial equi-librium model we explicitly model the agricultural sector in CEE. The underlying partial equilibrium model {{is based on the}} duality theory. The model captures all key CAP instruments, such as price sup-port, area payments, <b>animal</b> <b>premiums,</b> quotas and set-aside premiums. The policy simulation analysis allows us to track how changes in the CAP affect the supply and demand behaviour of agricultural producers and consumers of food products. Our simulation results suggest that farm income in CEE will rise mainly due to area payments and <b>animal</b> <b>premiums.</b> The impact on consumer welfare is rather small, as decreasing prices for some food products are offset by increasing prices for other agricultural goods...|$|E
40|$|Based on a {{graphical}} model we analyse {{the impacts of}} the Fischler Reform on land prices and the capitalization of single farm payments (sfp) into land values. The model shows that if there are more sfp than eligible land, the capitalization ratio will not decline but rather increase due to the inclusion of <b>animal</b> <b>premiums</b> in the sfp. We can confirm our theoretical results for cross-section data on land rental prices in Bavaria in 2005. Empirical results indicate that sfp of the Fischler reform are more capitalized into rental prices than the coupled direct payments of the time prior to the reform. land rent, capitalisation of payments, CAP Fischler Reform, Agricultural and Food Policy, Public Economics, Q 18, Q 15, H 22,...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the influence of}} <b>animal</b> <b>premiums</b> under the CAP beef and ewe regime on beef and sheep meat farming in the Netherlands concerning instruments like stock density limits, quota on premium rights and premium payments. On the basis of econometric models, equations are estimated for beef cows 1, bulls and ewes. Then, the impacts of the different policy instruments on the stocks are decomposed. At last, prospects of Agenda 2000 on the Dutch beef and ewe sector are calculated up to 2010. For policy makers, the study offers information {{on the effectiveness of}} animal premium instruments to manipulate beef and sheep meat production. For Dutch farmers, the study offers information to what extent premium instruments might influence the decision to incline or reduce their stocks. Agricultural and Food Policy,...|$|E

30|$|An {{important}} consideration {{is that this}} analysis takes no account {{of the value of}} the algal biomass produced. From this, it follows that there is a strong incentive to maximize this value, e.g., by conversion of the biomass to valuable products (nutraceuticals, <b>animal</b> food additive, <b>premium</b> organic fertilizer, etc.), to generate a revenue stream which can help to defray the costs of CO 2 capture/recycle. The size of the markets for algae-derived products is inversely related to the product price. Lower value products such as liquid fuels may be less attractive from a profitability perspective, but a utility-scale installation would produce a quantity of algal biomass that would inevitably oversupply lower volume, higher value product markets. However, there is no reason that utility-scale biomass utilization could not focus on developing both markets; lower value markets to utilize significant volumes, along with limited participation in higher value markets to maximize profits. By doing so, higher value market supply, and hence, profitability will be maintained.|$|R
40|$|At the Copenhagen European Council Meeting in December 2002 the European Union (EU) {{decided to}} enlarge the EU with ten new member states. In this study {{the impact of the}} {{accession}} for each of the EU- 25 member states is analysed. In particular, results of the accession under different policy environments, including the impacts of the recently adopted reform af the Common Agricultural Policy, are presented. The analysis shows that agricultural supply responses will be very different across acceding countries and that the impact of decoupling direct support is significant. The supply response in the new member states will be significantly smaller in the grain sector, when direct support is decoupled. In the old EU member countries, decoupling of <b>animal</b> <b>premiums</b> will lead to a 7 to 10 per cent decline in the production of beef in the EU- 15 and that the lowering of intervention prices in the dairy sector will imply that milk quotas, in some member countries of the EU- 15, are no longer binding.

40|$|Since 2000, the two {{important}} reforms of The EU Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) took place. The Agenda 2000 Berlin Agreement of March 1999 aimed to increase EU agriculture market orientation {{and focuses on}} the grain, oilseed, dairy and the beef sectors. It reduced intervention prices in these sectors and lowered the set-aside requirements for crops and by implementation of non-crop specific compensatory payments. The core of The Luxembourg Agreement from June 2003 was an acceleration of decoupling of farm support initiated by the Agenda 2000 complementary payment. It introduces a system of direct payments (known as single payment scheme - SPS), which are no longer linked to the production (decoupling). This CAP reform also includes commodity specific measures, especially in dairy sector. The Luxemburg Agreement links the direct payments to farmers with farm management practices which maintain environmental and other requirements set at EU and national levels (‘Cross-compliance’). The goal {{of this paper is}} twofold. First, we investigate the impact of the CAP reform on the Dutch agricultural sector in 2004 – 2007; second we examine effects of possible future CAP reform decision on the Dutch agriculture till 2020. The study is based on the AGMEMOD econometric model developed within the framework of projects financed by the European Commission. It reflects a sectoral, dynamic, partial equilibrium model, which takes into account the national specificities and is built up of models for the Member States of the EU 27. The foundation for AGMEMOD is laid in the establishment of country model templates, which must achieve compatibility of the models to be built and the communality of data. The most important differences between the national models are macroeconomic assumptions, components of policies under the CAP and SAPS (in respect with the new Member States) and assumptions on the impact of direct payments on agricultural production (degree of decoupling). On the country level, commodity templates must encapsulate the modeling system to be used. Many components of these templates are based on the information and guidelines delivered by Hanrahan (2001), but then adapted to country-specific conditions. At least, they must contain issues on market and policy description, flow charts, key market and specification of the functional forms of the commodity model. The AGMEMOD model covers all important CAP commodities: grains, oilseeds, potatoes, sugar and sugar beets, livestock products, milk and dairy products. We will investigate the CAP impact on the Dutch agriculture by mean of policy simulations with the Dutch AGMEMOD model. To isolate policy effect in the historical period 2000 - 2007, counterfactual simulations for 2000 - 2007 will be run. To simulate the response of the Dutch agriculture on different policy changes in 2008 - 2020, the no-policy change baseline scenario will be developed and several policy experiments will be conducted: milk quota abolition, biofuel directive implementation and <b>animal</b> <b>premiums</b> decoupling. To indentify the policy effects the policy scenarios will be compared with the baseline.

Using data for 692 pens of Show-Me Replacement Heifers Inc. heifers marketed over the 2001 through 2004 period, we find heavier heifers are priced higher than lighter heifers, artificially inseminated heifer pens were <b>premium</b> priced, Angus <b>animals</b> received a <b>premium,</b> pens {{that are expected to}} calve at optimal period of the year and within a 30 -day window received premiums, calf performance EPD birth weight was positive, only marbling carcass characteristic EPD was positive and significant, buyers prefer larger lots to smaller lots, buyers pay the highest price for lots sold during the mid-point of the sale, and buyers pay a higher price for a pen bred to the same sire. It may be that certain post-weaning carcass characteristics are not of value to buyers because they either sell at weaning or due to the co-mingling of cattle certain expected production capabilities are of little value.

30|$|The {{application}} of E.C. Reg. 1782 / 2003 {{at the beginning}} of 2005 brought a new era in the sector. Full decoupling has been imposed by the Greek government for the sheep and goat sector as it was for most of the Greek agriculture sectors, which meant that production-oriented subsidies would have been paid on a 'historic rights' basis, i.e. a comprehensive subsidy was calculated {{on the basis of the}} unitary 2002 headage payment and the farmer's payment rights (calculated as the average of 3 years) and the amount 'frozen' until 2013. This was expected to have positive impacts by favouring the replacement of specialised crop systems with mixed crop and livestock systems and by returning non-profitable arable land to pasture lands. Sheep and goat farmers who had grazing land in their 'historic records' had to maintain these lands in good condition by grazing (maintaining a density of 1.4 head/ha), while the landless farmers, who used to use 'communal grazing land', had to continue breeding at least 50 % of their <b>animals.</b> The compensatory <b>premium</b> for breeding in the LFAs continued largely unaffected, while some agri-environmental measures (these including extensification and organic farming) were applied sporadically. The implementation of 'cross compliance' rules did not result in many constraints for sheep and goat farmers, except for the animal identification rules, since many traditional farmers were reluctant to enter the system and keep records.|$|R
40|$|Economic values {{derived from}} a {{terminal}} crossbreeding system based on Brahman cows and a tropically adapted composite herd targeted to meet specifications of the grass-finished Japanese market were compared to a straightbred Brahman herd. The model represented a typical individual central Queensland integrated breeding/finishing enterprise or a northern Australian vertically integrated enterprise with separate breeding and finishing properties. Due mainly to a reduced age of turnoff of Crossbred and Composite sale animals and an improved weaning rate in the Composite herd, Crossbred and Composite herds returned a gross margin of $ 7 and $ 24 per Adult Equivalent (AE) respectively above that of the Brahman herd. The benefits of changing 25 % of the existing 85 % of Brahmans in the northern Australian herd to either Crossbreds or Composites over a 10 -year period were also examined, using either no premium or a 5 c per kg premium for carcass quality in Crossbred and Composite sale <b>animals.</b> With no <b>premium,</b> annual benefits were $ 16 m and $ 61 m for Crossbreds and Composites in 2013. The cumulative Present Value (PV) of this shift over the 10 -year period was $ 88 m and $ 342 m respectively, discounted at 7 %. When a 5 c per kg premium for carcass quality was included, differences in annual benefits rose to $ 30 m and $ 75 m and cumulative PVs to $ 168 m and $ 421 m for Crossbreds and Composites respectively...|$|R
40|$|In many {{developing}} countries there has been, and still is, a strong move {{for the government to}} give up or reduce its involvement in ventures that the market can take care of. The ideological basis for this hinges on the belief that the government should not provide goods and services that the private sector is willing and able to provide. Rather, the government should be concerned with providing goods and services that are public in nature but have the potential for market failure. This has been behind the moves for privatisation of veterinary services all over the world. In Ghana, the government has been responsible for the provision of veterinary services to animal owners freely or at subsidised levels since independence. However, there have been arguments against continued free provision or subsidy because the government is facing budgetary and financial difficulties. Another argument is that over-employment is over-extending the ability of government to provide quality services, and that some of those employed by the government have to go into the private sector to ease the burden. A project to help privatise veterinary services was launched in 1993, encouraging veterinarians to go into private practice. However, one factor {{critical to the success of}} the privatisation effort is the willingness of livestock farmers or animal owners to pay the full cost for animal health services. Their willingness to pay is to a large extent influenced by the livestock market structure, since services have to be paid for with cash in most cases. There is, though, no well-defined livestock marketing structure in Ghana. Livestock producers and consumers are therefore at the mercy of middlemen whose aim is to maximise profits by buying animals cheaply and selling meat at high prices to consumers. No formal market structures exist at present. Sometime back, the government set up a Meat Marketing Board that was charged with buying livestock from farmers and processing the meat to sell at reasonably competitive prices. However, the Board is now defunct partly because of low farmer patronage. One reason was that farmers were not paid on time and payments were on a carcass weight basis, which was not attractive. The alternative was for livestock owners to sell on the hoof to middlemen for ready cash. Middlemen too dominant The middlemen they are mainly butchers and influential people from livestock producing communities have a monopoly and therefore dictate what to pay for animals and what the price of meat is. Livestock farmers are not well organised, and therefore lack strong bargaining power to deal with the hegemony of the middlemen. If the prevailing market structure is left to stand, livestock farmers will continue to receive low prices for their animals and will therefore not have the financial power to pay for services rendered by private veterinarians. The effect is that private practice will not be profitable and will thus discourage other veterinarians from going in. Another factor in the market structure with implications for privatisation of services is the value system of livestock owners. Farmers are more concerned about numbers than quality. They are reluctant to sell animals. Animals are therefore sold only when the farmers are in dire need of money or when there is drought or disease. This has serious implications. When animals are sold to get cash for a pressing need, farmers are willing to accept any price, sometimes well below the market value; they therefore lose substantially. Since they do not receive a fair price for their efforts, they tend to be unwilling to invest in their animals. The other implication is that when animals are sold during drought, or when they are in poor shape as a result of poor nutrition or disease, farmers are unable to demand good prices. There is therefore the need to put in place facilities to help farmers know when to cull animals and how to market their <b>animals.</b> Bring in <b>premium</b> prices To help solve the problems of the market structure, livestock farmers should be encouraged to form livestock producer cooperatives, without political prodding or control. These cooperatives can provide inputs more cheaply (on the basis of economies of scale) and also help in marketing. They could also retain veterinarians on a part-time or full-time basis, which could encourage the privatisation efforts. Such an association could also lobby for fair marketing legislation, especially where monopolies abound. Another recommendation for market restructuring is to introduce payment of premium prices for quality. At the moment there is no price differentiation to encourage production of quality goods that will fetch higher prices. There is an urgent need to restructure the market so that farmers will be paid for quality products and will be more willing to invest in their animals knowing that they will be rewarded with higher prices. Once they receive premium prices, they may be more willing to pay for services like health, knowing that they stand to benefit in the end. The last recommendation is to educate farmers on the need to keep quality animals instead of keeping large numbers for social prestige. This can be done through livestock producer associations and through premium pricing. It may be helpful to work with rural anthropologists/ sociologists to help redirect societal values from quantity to quality. These, it is believed, will help in privatisation of veterinary services in the long term.
