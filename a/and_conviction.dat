5|$|Applying the {{proceeds}} of a book deal, the family moved in 2005 from a Hyde Park, Chicago condominium to a $1.6million house in neighboring Kenwood, Chicago. The purchase of an adjacent lot—and sale of part of it to Obama by the wife of developer, campaign donor and friend Tony Rezko—attracted media attention because of Rezko's subsequent indictment <b>and</b> <b>conviction</b> on political corruption charges that were unrelated to Obama.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the trial}} <b>and</b> <b>conviction,</b> Scrushy, Siegelman, and the {{prosecutors}} all indicated they would appeal. Scrushy and Seigelman vowed to appeal their convictions and sentences, while the prosecution announced {{its desire to}} appeal a judge's decision to remove charges of perjury from Scrushy's indictment. The prosecutors quickly dropped their appeal, and United States Attorney Alice Martin indicated they had reconsidered.|$|E

5|$|Katherine Merry Devine, 14, was {{abducted}} on November 25, 1973, {{and her body}} was found the next month in the Capitol State Forest near Olympia, Washington. Brenda Joy Baker, 14, was seen hitchhiking near Puyallup, Washington on May 27, 1974; {{her body was found}} in Millersylvania State Park a month later. Though Bundy was widely believed responsible for both murders, he told Keppel that he had no knowledge of either case. DNA analysis led to the arrest <b>and</b> <b>conviction</b> of William E. Cosden for Devine's murder in 2002. The Baker homicide remains unsolved.|$|E
5|$|Mexican Marines arrested Treviño Morales on 15 July 2013 in {{the state}} of Nuevo León without a single bullet being fired. At the time of his capture, the Mexican {{government}} was offering up to a 30 million pesos (US$2.3 million) reward for information leading to his arrest. The United States Department of State was offering up to US$5 million for information leading to his arrest <b>and</b> <b>conviction.</b> Authorities {{on both sides of the}} border believe that he was succeeded by his younger brother Omar Treviño Morales, a man who was also on the most-wanted list.|$|E
5|$|On 2 December 2007, nine VCs {{were among}} 100 medals stolen from locked, {{reinforced}} glass cabinets at the QEII Army Memorial Museum in Waiouru, New Zealand with {{a value of}} around NZD$20 million. Charles Upham's VC and Bar was among these. A reward of NZ$300,000 was posted {{for information leading to}} the recovery of the decorations <b>and</b> <b>conviction</b> of the thieves, although at the time there was much public debate about the need to offer reward money to retrieve the medals.

5|$|Fleming {{retained}} {{an interest}} in the subject and when Sillitoe suggested to the editor of The Sunday Times, Denis Hamilton, that the paper may want to write a story on the International Diamond Security Organisation, Hamilton offered the story to Fleming. Sillitoe also offered his deputy, retired MI5 officer John Collard, as liaison for Fleming to interview. During World War II, Collard had assisted in the planning of Operation Overlord as part of MI11 and had joined MI5 under Sillitoe at the war's end. Whilst in MI5 he {{played a major role in}} the capture <b>and</b> <b>conviction</b> of the atomic spy Klaus Fuchs, before Sillitoe had approached him in 1954 to work for the International Diamond Security Organisation.|$|E
5|$|In 1983, Mansour {{was offered}} {{money for the}} film rights {{to the story of}} her life. She said that she would accept on {{condition}} that the money was enough to balance Michigan's state deficit, $900,000,000 at that time. No film rights were obtained. Mansour remained director of DSS until 1987. Under her leadership, the department's error rate dropped to its lowest levels in awarding food stamps, Medicaid funds, and Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC). She increased the investigation <b>and</b> <b>conviction</b> of fraud cases, and she achieved the highest national record of locating deadbeat parents for collecting child support. She streamlined office procedures, and she initiated programs to curtail teenage pregnancy and to assist teenage mothers. She broadened the state program benefiting victims of domestic abuse.|$|E
5|$|In the {{governor}}'s absence, or if {{the governor}} dies or is unable to perform the executive duties, the Secretary of State of Puerto Rico takes control of the executive position, as Acting Governor during a temporary absence or inability, and as Governor in case of death, resignation or impeachment <b>and</b> <b>conviction.</b> The elected governor must designate a number of secretaries and other agency heads that will control the individual administrative agencies during his time in office, the selected secretaries {{are in charge of}} the island's health, natural resources, economy, correctional and judicial agencies and the department of consumer concerns, among others. The Governor's four-year term begins on January 2, the day after the New Year's Day holiday.|$|E

5|$|Monroe Edwards (1808– January 27, 1847) was an American slave trader, forger {{and convicted}} {{criminal}} {{who was the}} subject of a well-publicized trial <b>and</b> <b>conviction</b> in 1842. Originally from Kentucky, Edwards moved to New Orleans then settled in Texas. He smuggled slaves into Brazil in 1832, and used the proceeds to purchase land in Texas. In 1836 he was again smuggling slaves, this time into Texas. After attempting to swindle his partner out of the profits of the venture, partly with forged documents, Edwards was forced to flee the Republic of Texas to the United States. He then tried to scam money out of various abolitionists in the United States and the United Kingdom, partly with forged letters of introduction. He traveled to the United Kingdom, but his schemes were mainly unsuccessful and he returned to the United States in mid-1841.|$|E
5|$|Moreover, {{working under}} {{commission}} from the Farnese family, Titian {{would not have}} sought to portray the sitters in an obviously unsympathetic manner. While Paul is shown as old and frail, he is given a broad chest and cunning eyes that indicate his intelligence and guile. Ottavio is presented as cold and impervious, but this was probably a device to show his strength of character <b>and</b> <b>conviction.</b> Alessandro is favoured by his positioning closest to the Pope, yet x-ray analysis reveals he had originally stood {{to the left of}} the pope and was moved, probably on request by Alessandro himself, to a position where his hand was resting on the papal throne, indicating his claim on the papacy.|$|E
5|$|Morrow also demanded {{consistency}} {{from local}} law enforcement officials. In 1921, he removed the Woodford County jailer from office because he allowed a black inmate to be lynched and offered a reward of $25,000 {{for information leading to}} the arrest <b>and</b> <b>conviction</b> of the perpetrators. Citizens of Versailles were more outraged that the jailer had been removed from office than that the prisoner had been lynched. The locals refused to aid in the investigation, and the lynchers were never arrested or charged. Local officials appointed the jailer's wife to finish his term in an attempt to skirt the removal.|$|E

5|$|Prosecution of {{the conspirators}} began in 1990, when {{a federal grand}} jury brought indictments against several of the key players. Some had fled the country, and {{extradition}} proceedings against the perpetrators and subsequent prosecution <b>and</b> <b>conviction</b> was not completed for sixteen years. The final conspirator was convicted in 2006, when Catherine Jane Stork agreed to return to the United States from Germany in order to be allowed to visit her ill son in Australia. Eight perpetrators received sentences ranging from five years probation to five years in federal prison and an additional member of the Rajneesh commune pleaded guilty to murder conspiracy. Rajneesh was never prosecuted in relation to the conspiracy, and left the United States after pleading guilty to immigration fraud and agreeing not to reenter the country without permission from the U.S. Attorney General.|$|E
5|$|The {{bishops of}} Olinda and Belém (in {{the provinces of}} Pernambuco and Pará, respectively) {{were two of the}} new {{generation}} of educated, zealous Brazilian clerics. They had been influenced by the Ultramontanism which spread among Catholics in this period. In 1872 they ordered Freemasons expelled from lay brotherhoods. While European Masonry often tended towards atheism and anti-clericalism, things were much different in Brazil where membership in Masonic orders was common—although PedroII himself was not a Freemason. The government headed by the Viscount of Rio Branco tried on two separate occasions to persuade the bishops to repeal, but they refused. This led to their trial <b>and</b> <b>conviction</b> by the Superior Court of Justice. In 1874 they were sentenced four years at hard labor, although the Emperor commuted this to imprisonment only.|$|E
5|$|He awaited {{execution}} of his sentence at the Union Correctional Institution. Shortly {{after the trial}} <b>and</b> <b>conviction,</b> his wife Debra filed for divorce and their marriage was formally dissolved a year later. Chandler was no longer allowed to see his daughter Whitney, and, in accordance with his ex-wife's wishes, he {{was not allowed to}} see later photographs of her. In July 2008, Chandler was on Florida's short list of executions. Profiling experts speculated that Chandler may have killed previously, {{based on the belief that}} a first-time killer would not be experienced, or bold enough, to abduct and kill three women at once. Chandler remained a suspect in the 1982 murder of a woman found floating off Anna Maria Island until 2011, when the body was identified as 29-year-old Amy Hurst and her husband was arrested and charged with her murder. Chandler was never charged with another murder. All of his appeals of his 1994 conviction were denied; his last was in May 2007.|$|E

5|$|In 2005, the Puerto Rican Nationalist Party {{issued a}} limited amount of {{banknotes}} commemorating the Jayuya Uprising. The series included pesos of six denominations, including $1, $5, $10, $20, $50 and $100 bills. The designs of all banknotes feature Pedro Albizu Campos in the front side while the reverses are adorned with the flags of Puerto Rico, Jayuya and the Nationalist Party. Microprint with the names of Pedro Albizu Campos and Filiberto Ojeda Ríos are found throughout the pesos. On July 10, 2005, Liberty Dollar of Puerto Rico was created by Alfredo Pacheco Martínez. Silver ounces began circulating on October 8, 2005, marking {{the first time that a}} silver coin was distributed in more than a century. After an intervention with parent company Liberty Services concluded with its assets being confiscated, leading to a process that resulted in the indictment <b>and</b> <b>conviction</b> of founder Bernard von NotHaus, Pacheco Martínez continued to circulate the coins under the name of Dólar Boricua. In August 2010, he was also indicted on the same charges faced by Von NotHaus. Pacheco Martínez was found guilty on June 29, 2012, being subsequently sentenced to 19 years in prison.|$|E
5|$|Members of {{the council}} {{had the right to}} speak freely, and {{although}} there is no direct evidence that they voted on affairs of state, {{it is clear that the}} king was at least occasionally pressured to agree to their demands. The assembly was apparently given the right to judge cases of high treason and assign punishments for them, such as when Alexander the Great acted as prosecutor in the trial <b>and</b> <b>conviction</b> of three alleged conspirators in his father's assassination plot (while many others were acquitted). However, there is perhaps insufficient evidence to allow a conclusion that councils and assemblies were regularly upheld or constitutionally grounded, or that their decisions were always heeded by the king. At the death of Alexander the Great, the companions immediately formed a council to assume control of his empire, but it was soon destabilized by open rivalry and conflict between its members. The army also used mutiny as a tool to achieve political ends.|$|E
5|$|Offscreen, Robert Mitchum's arrest <b>and</b> <b>conviction</b> for {{marijuana}} possession—he would serve {{two months in}} jail—was widely assumed to mean career death for RKO's most promising young star, but Hughes surprised the industry by announcing that his contract was not endangered. Of much broader significance, Hughes decided to get the jump on his Big Five competitors by being the first to settle the federal government's antitrust suit against the major studios, which had won a crucial Supreme Court ruling in United States v. Paramount Pictures, Inc. Under the consent decree he signed, Hughes agreed to dissolve the old parent company, Radio-Keith-Orpheum Corp., and split RKO's production-distribution business and its exhibition chain into two entirely separate corporations—RKO Pictures Corp. and RKO Theatres Corp.—with the obligation to promptly sell off one or the other. While Hughes delayed the divorcement procedure until December 1950 and didn't actually sell his stock in the theater company for another three years, his decision to acquiesce {{was one of the}} crucial steps in the collapse of classical Hollywood's studio system.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} is to confirm the validity and reliability of the Milliman, Czaplewski and Ferguson’s measurement model of workplace spirituality/WS, and the Chen and Seng’s measurement model of Earning Management Motivation/EMM, and to test the relationship of WS and EMM. The measurement model test used confimatory factor analyses (CFA) and the relationship test used bivariat correlation. The sample was selected from professionals in the field of accountancy, finance, and audit at University of Tarumanagara. The research findings were: (1) the Milliman, Czaplewski dan Ferguson’s measurement model of WS was valid and reliable; (2) the Chen and Seng’s measurement model of EMM was also valid and reliable as long as the dimentions of the EMM to be modified from the original ones, which consisted of two dimentions (attitude <b>and</b> <b>convictions,</b> pressure from affiliated parties) into five dimentions (attitude <b>and</b> <b>convictions</b> to investors, attitude <b>and</b> <b>convictions</b> to employees, attitude <b>and</b> <b>convictions</b> to legal <b>and</b> regulation,  attitude <b>and</b> <b>convictions</b> to profit target, and  pressure from affiliated parties); (3) this research gave  an empirical evidence that there was a significant negative correlation between WS and EMM. The implication of these findings, is that the learning and training of WS in formal and non formal education institutions become more and more  important as an implementation of WS’s research findings, which prove that increasing spiritual consciousness in workplace can minimize management motivation to manage earning. This can also strengthen the transparancy of a healthy corporate governance...|$|R
