50|$|The {{same three}} images taken through red, {{green and blue}} filters which are used for <b>additive</b> <b>color</b> <b>synthesis</b> may {{also be used to}} produce color prints and {{transparencies}} by the subtractive method, in which colors are subtracted from white light by dyes or pigments. In photography, the dye colors are normally cyan, a greenish-blue which absorbs red; magenta, a purplish-pink which absorbs green; and yellow, which absorbs blue. The red-filtered image is used to create a cyan dye image, the green-filtered image to create a magenta dye image, and the blue-filtered image to create a yellow dye image. When the three dye images are superimposed they form a complete color image.|$|E
50|$|The first {{widely used}} method of color {{photography}} was the Autochrome plate, a process inventors and brothers Auguste and Louis Lumière {{began working on}} in the 1890s and commercially introduced in 1907. It was based on one of Louis Ducos du Hauron's ideas: instead of taking three separate photographs through color filters, take one through a mosaic of tiny color filters overlaid on the emulsion and view the results through an identical mosaic. If the individual filter elements were small enough, the three primary colors of red, blue, and green would blend together {{in the eye and}} produce the same <b>additive</b> <b>color</b> <b>synthesis</b> as the filtered projection of three separate photographs. Autochrome plates had an integral mosaic filter layer with roughly five million previously dyed potato grains per square inch added to the surface. Then {{through the use of a}} rolling press, five tons of pressure were used to flatten the grains, enabling every one of them to capture and absorb color and their microscopic size allowing the illusion that the colors are merged together. The final step was adding a coat of the light capturing substance silver bromide after which a color image could be imprinted and developed. In order to see it, reversal processing was used to develop each plate into a transparent positive that could be viewed directly or projected with an ordinary projector. One of the drawbacks of the technology is an exposure time of at least a second was required during the day in bright light and the worse the light is, the time required quickly goes up. An indoor portrait required a few minutes with the subject not being able to move or else the picture would come out blurry. This was because the grains absorbed the color fairly slowly and that a filter of a yellowish-orange color was added to the plate to keep the photograph from coming out excessively blue. Although necessary, the filter had the effect of reducing the amount of light that was absorbed. Another drawback was that the film could only be enlarged so much until the many dots that make up the image become apparent.|$|E

50|$|Natural Color was a {{term used}} in the {{beginning}} of film and later on in the 1920s, and early 1930s as a color film process that actually filmed color images, rather than a color tinted or colorized movie. The first natural color processes were in the 1900s and 1910s and were two <b>color</b> <b>additive</b> <b>color</b> processes or red and green missing primary <b>color</b> blue, one <b>additive</b> process of time was Kinemacolor. By the 1920s, subtractive color was mostly in use with such processes as Technicolor, Prizma and Multicolor, but Multicolor was mostly never in use in the late 1920s, Technicolor was mostly in use. The only one who cared to mess with Multicolor was William Fox, probably because Multicolor was more cheaper of a process and at the time in 1929 William Fox was in debt. The difference between <b>additive</b> <b>color</b> and subtractive color were that an <b>additive</b> <b>color</b> film required a special projector that could project two components of film at the same time, a green record and a red record. But <b>additive</b> <b>color</b> didn't required a special projector, the two pieces of film were chemically formed together and was projected in one strip of film.|$|R

50|$|Systems of <b>additive</b> <b>color</b> are {{motivated}} by the Young-Helmholtz theory of trichromatic color vision, which was articulated around 1850 by Hermann von Helmholtz, based on earlier work by Thomas Young. For his experimental work on the subject, James Clerk Maxwell is sometimes credited as being the father of <b>additive</b> <b>color.</b> He had the photographer Thomas Sutton photograph a tartan ribbon on black-and-white film three times, first with a red, then green, then blue color filter over the lens. The three black-and-white images were developed and then projected onto a screen with three different projectors, each equipped with the corresponding red, green, or blue color filter used to take its image. When brought into alignment, the three images (a black-and-red image, a black-and-green image and a black-and-blue image) formed a full color image, thus demonstrating the principles of <b>additive</b> <b>color.</b>|$|R

50|$|At {{about the}} same time as Young {{discovered}} <b>additive</b> <b>colors,</b> another British scientist, David Brewster (1781-1868), the inventor of the kaleidoscope, proposed a competing theory that the true primary colors were red, yellow, and blue, and that the true complementary pairs were red-green, blue-orange, and yellow-purple. Then a German scientist, Hermann von Helmholtz, (1821-1894), resolved the debate by showing that colors formed by light, <b>additive</b> <b>colors,</b> and those formed by pigments, subtractive colors, did in fact operate by different rules, and had different primary and complementary colors.|$|R
