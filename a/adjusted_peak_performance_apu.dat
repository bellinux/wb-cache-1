5000|$|The naïve Roofline is {{obtained}} by applying simple bound and bottleneck analysis. In this {{formulation of the}} Roofline model, {{there are only two}} parameters: <b>peak</b> <b>performance</b> and <b>peak</b> bandwidth of the specific architecture; and one variable: arithmetic intensity. The <b>peak</b> <b>performance,</b> in general expressed as GFLOPS, can be usually derived from architectural manuals, while the peak bandwidth, that references to peak DRAM bandwidth to be specific, is instead obtained via benchmarking. The resulting plot, in general with both axes in logarithmic scale, is then derived by the following formula:where [...] is the attainable performance, [...] is the <b>peak</b> <b>performance,</b> [...] is the peak bandwidth and [...] is the arithmetic intensity. The point at which the performance saturates at the <b>peak</b> <b>performance</b> level [...] - i.e. where the diagonal and horizontal roof meet - is defined as ridge point.

40|$|Virtual Machines (VMs) with Just-In-Time (JIT) compilers are {{traditionally}} thought to execute programs in two phases: the initial warmup phase determines which {{parts of a}} program would most benefit from dynamic compilation, before JIT compiling those parts into machine code; subsequently the program {{is said to be}} at a steady state of <b>peak</b> <b>performance.</b> Measurement methodologies almost always discard data collected during the warmup phase such that reported measurements focus entirely on <b>peak</b> <b>performance.</b> We introduce a fully automated statistical approach, based on changepoint analysis, which allows us to determine if a program has reached a steady state and, if so, whether that represents <b>peak</b> <b>performance</b> or not. Using this, we show that even when run in the most controlled of circumstances, small, deterministic, widely studied microbenchmarks often fail to reach a steady state of <b>peak</b> <b>performance</b> on a variety of common VMs. Repeating our experiment on 3 different machines, we found that at most 43. 5 % of pairs consistently reach a steady state of <b>peak</b> <b>performance.</b> Comment: 40 pages, 11 figures, 9 tables, 3 listing...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to build theory on <b>peak</b> <b>performance</b> at the group level. <b>Peak</b> <b>performance</b> transcends {{ordinary}} performance and is associated with a subjective experience in which one loses a sense of time and space as well as feels great joy and bliss. We chose to study this phenomenon at the group level through a methodology of participant observation in an orchestra. We found that groups can be transformed by their own performance in a reflexive process in which virtuosity, or individual <b>peak</b> <b>performance,</b> becomes collective. We offer a propositional model of collective virtuosity in organizations, and offer directions for further research. Copyright Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2007. ...|$|R
40|$|This article {{introduces}} {{a new approach}} to understanding <b>peak</b> <b>performance</b> and dysfunctional performance in sport, correction theory. Correction theory, based within a control theory and dynamical systems perspective, assumes that dynamic balance (a state in which a robust complex system will self-correct in response to imbalance) underwrites individual functioning. The central thesis presented in this article is that an interdependent relationship exists between <b>peak</b> <b>performance</b> and dysfunctional <b>performance</b> in sport. <b>Peak</b> <b>performance</b> is, in part, a (corrective) response to dysfunctional performance and vice versa. An overview of correction theory is presented, based on two propositions relating to balance. Implications of correction theory for understanding sporting performance are briefly considered...|$|R
