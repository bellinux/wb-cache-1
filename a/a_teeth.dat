50|$|A veneer is a {{thin layer}} of {{restorative}} material placed over <b>a</b> <b>tooth</b> surface, either to improve the esthetics of <b>a</b> <b>tooth,</b> or to restore <b>a</b> damaged <b>tooth</b> surface.

50|$|The {{appearance}} and perception of <b>a</b> <b>tooth</b> {{is the result}} of a complex interaction of factors such as lighting conditions, translucency, opacity, light scattering, gloss and the human eye and brain. Of these, the intrinsic pigmentation of <b>a</b> <b>tooth</b> is the most influential, which in turn is determined by genetic and natural factors. Light hitting <b>a</b> <b>tooth</b> undergoes reflection, absorption and transmission by varying degrees in each tissue layer of the tooth substance.

40|$|Dental decay (or caries) {{is common}} disease worldwide. It {{is caused by}} acid which first dissolves enamel and {{afterwards}} dentine, causing pain when stimulated.

This paper investigates the stress distribution between bonding surface of dental filling in enamel and dentine. Finite element analysis was used to perform the numerical analysis on an arbitrarily shaped dental filling inserted on <b>a</b> <b>teeth</b> loaded by a pressure.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to develop an {{ultrasonic}} tooth-whitening apparatus using piezoelectric transducers,which enhance bleaching efficiency by applying ultrasound, while performing <b>a</b> <b>teeth</b> whitening procedure.

The results revealed that the ultrasound whitenerproduced color values that were enhanced by as much as double that of the conventional LED light whiteningmethod.
