In {{conducting research on}} human-computer interaction is then vital to work with cross-medial data collections, namely with data which derive from different collection procedures addressing {{various aspects of the}} interaction and which are combined according to an overarching methodological rationale. The present paper intends to describe some techniques for the collection and displaying of cross-media data, integrating them with some methodological considerations. Three procedures will be illustrated, namely the split-screen technique, that allows the synchronized visualization of different environments on the same screen; the <b>action</b> <b>indicator</b> augmented display, that allows to enrich the visual recording with signals notifying the occurrence of a particular event; the pentagram, which allows to transcribe multiple sequences of events in their reciprocal temporal relationship.

Introduction [...] Theoretical {{framework}} [...] Transitivity in CBI: transitive {{pattern of}} clause organization [...] Transitivity in CBI: ergative pattern of clause organization [...] The reflective experiential aspect of {{meaning of the}} affix -i̲ [...] Revisiting the proposed model of transitivity system of CBI [...] References. Transitivity and the meanings of the verbal affix -i̲ in Bahasa Indonesia have been analysed using various linguistic approaches. The present study uses the systemic functional approach postulated by Halliday (1967, 1968, 1976. 1981, 1985) which demands the description of a language in its own terms: considering linguistic form {{in terms of what}} it achieves in its cultural context and delaying any assumptions about grammatical categories. [...] The systemic functional approach perceives transitivity in terms of paradigmatic and syntagmatic relations in the clause, and not the classification of verbs as 'transitive' and 'intransitive'. [...] Through a transitional stage using English as reference point, the study reveals that there are five types of processes in contemporary Bahasa Indonesia: 'doing'. 'sensing', 'being', 'verbalizing' and 'existing'. [...] From the internal language evidence available, this study reveals that the functional characteristics of the verbal affix -i̲ in the language depend on the type of: 1) base the affix is attached to; 2) process the affix occurs in. [...] Based on the influence of the two factors above, the functions of the affix can be distinguised into unifying and specific functions, the first of which is not influenced whereas the latter is. The unifying functions are as a 'dispositive marker' and an 'internal causative marker' whereas the specific functions are as a: - process former, - intensified process marker, - goal is location of <b>action</b> <b>indicator,</b> - repetitive process marker, - addition of base to Goal indicator, - deletion of base to Goal indicator, and - temporal/spatial relationship between Actor and Goal indicator. [...] Using the description of the functions of the verbal affix -i̲ to revisit the proposed model of transitivity system of contemporary Bahasa Indonesia this study argues that the understaning of the functions of the verbal affix -i̲ cannot be excluded from the interpretation of the system of transitivity of contemporary Bahasa Indonesia.

The aim {{of this study was to}} develop and validate a set of prescribing quality indicators (PQIs) for type 2 diabetes in primary care, and to apply this set in practice. To take into account the stepwise treatment of chronic disease, clinical <b>action</b> <b>indicators</b> were specifically considered. Methods: Potential PQIs were derived from clinical practice guidelines and evaluated using the RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method, a modified Delphi panel. Thereafter, the feasibility of calculating the PQIs was tested in two large Dutch primary care databases including > 80 000 diabetes patients in 2012. Results: 32 PQIs focusing on treatment with glucose, lipid, blood pressure and albuminuria lowering drugs, and on vaccination, medication safety and adherence were assessed by ten experts. After the Delphi panel, the final list of twenty PQIs was tested for feasibility. All PQIs definitions were feasible for measuring the quality of medication treatment using these databases. Indicator scores ranged from 18. 8 % to 90. 8 % for PQIs focusing on current medication use, clinical action and medication choice, and from 2. 1 % to 37. 2 % for PQIs focusing on medication safety. Discussion and conclusions: Twenty PQIs focusing on treatment with glucose, lipid, blood pressure and albuminuria lowering drugs, and on medication safety in type 2 diabetes were developed, considered valid and operationally feasible.

There have been no major research initiatives to determine the implications of climate change for C&I. We evaluated the 46 indicators of the 2003 Canadian Council of Forest Ministers framework. Indicators were evaluated for their relationships with climate, relationships with other indicators, robustness and utility under climate change, and future prospects, including abandonment, improvement, or continued use. An evaluation framework was developed to analyze indicator linkages, direct and indirect climate-change influence, and potential modifications. 12 indicators were considered unaffected by climate change. The remaining 34 indicators were considered to be influenced by climate change. No modification seemed warranted for 23 of these indicators, while modifications for the remaining 11 indicators were recommended.

However, the requirements of individuals and groups often conflict, forcing designers to support one {{at the expense of the}} other. The tradeoff is particularly evident in the design of interaction techniques for shared workspaces. Individuals demand powerful and flexible means for interacting with the workspace and its artifacts, while groups require information about each other to maintain awareness. Although these conflicting requirements present real problems to designers, the tension can be reduced in some cases. We consider the tradeoff in three areas of groupware design: workspace navigation, artifact manipulation, and view representation.

40|$|Reducing {{health disparities}} {{requires}} intervention {{on the social}} determinants of health, {{as well as a}} means to monitor and evaluate these <b>actions.</b> <b>Indicators</b> are powerful evaluation tools that can support these efforts, but they are often developed without the input of those being “measured” and invariably reflect the value judgments of those who create them. This is particularly evident in the measurement of subjective social constructs such as gender equity, and the participation and collaboration of the intended beneficiaries are critical to the creation of relevant and useful indicators. These issues are examined {{in the context of a}} study to develop indicators to measure gender equity in the Nicaraguan Fair Trade coffee cooperative PROCOCER. Recent studies report that Fair Trade cooperatives are not adequately addressing the needs of its women members. Indicators can provide cooperatives with a consistent means to plan, implement, and sustain actions to improve gender equity. This study used participatory and feminist research methods to develop indicators based on focus groups and interviews with women members of PROCOCER, the cooperative staff, and external experts. The findings suggest that the cooperative has a role in promoting gender equity not only at the organizational level, but in the member families as well. Moreover, gender equity requires the empowerment of women in four broad dimensions of measurement: economic, political, sociocultural, and wellbeing. The indicator set proposes 22 objective and subjective indicators for immediate use by the cooperative and 7 indicators for future integration, mirroring its evolving gender strategy. The results also highlight salient lessons from the participatory process of indicator development, where the selected indicators were inherently shaped by the organizational context, the emerging research partnership, and the unique study constraints. These findings speak to the need for continued efforts to develop a critical awareness and organizational response to gender inequities, as well as the importance of providing spaces for women to define their own tools of evaluation...|$|R
