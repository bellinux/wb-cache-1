6000|$|... "The Professor {{spoke up}} like a man," [...] she agreed, [...] "but, Laura, I want to <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> <b>something.</b> Did you notice his servant--that man Craig?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{shall not}} do that. I {{am going to}} <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> <b>something</b> for your own good. You must leave off writing those letters to the English newspapers." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Corporal, may I <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> <b>something?</b> Do {{you plan}} to do this the rest of your life, sit out in the sun on a flat rock? Nothing else?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Great changes {{always bring}} small discomforts," [...] Wolfenden rejoined. [...] "But after all I didn't {{come here to}} talk nonsense. I came to <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> both <b>something.</b> I {{want to know whether}} you fellows are bent upon seeing this thing through?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{does not}} matter," [...] said Poirot, not betraying {{any sign of}} disappointment. [...] "Now I want to <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> about <b>something</b> else. There is a {{saucepan}} in Mrs. Inglethorp's room with some coco in it. Did she have that every night?" ...|$|R
5000|$|... 7. Do nothing, {{sit still}} {{and wait for}} my orders. If there is no order, keep quiet. When I <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> to do <b>something,</b> <b>you</b> must do it right away without protesting.|$|R

6000|$|... "Now I {{have told}} you {{something}} very interesting," [...] she said, [...] "and in return I am going to <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> <b>something.</b> You quarrelled with her, did you not?" ...|$|E

30|$|I {{found it}} quite hard {{to choose a}} bit this time but this part, {{something}} unusual happened, well unusual {{in the sense that}} someone <b>asks</b> <b>you</b> about <b>something</b> and then <b>you</b> go off and follow a path that you never intended to follow I suppose. That’s probably why I picked it.|$|R
5000|$|During the Philadelphia Mob War, Caramandi said, [...] "He'd never <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> to do <b>something</b> he wouldn't do himself. He {{was right}} out there with you (on murder contracts)." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You will {{wonder why}} I begged you to come. I wanted to <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> <b>something.</b> You said I was ignorant. That is true. And what can I do but ask you?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Very good,' pursued Mr Crummles, 'then we'll {{call that}} settled. Now, I want to <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> <b>something</b> else. There's a little--what shall I call it?--a little {{canvassing}} {{takes place on}} these occasions.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, not yet; I wish to <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> <b>something</b> first. Arthur says he {{will come}} down {{as soon as he}} gets my reply. And--I should like Captain Horton to come with him." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "I {{wanted to}} <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> again about <b>something</b> <b>you</b> {{said the other}} day. Perhaps it was half of it your lively way of speaking: I notice that you like to put things strongly; I myself often exaggerate when I speak hastily." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Kilmeny," [...] he said, seriously, [...] "I {{am going}} to <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> to do <b>something</b> for me. I {{want you to take}} me home with you and {{introduce}} me to your uncle and aunt." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Yes, my dear Vernon, I wish to <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> to do <b>something,</b> if <b>you</b> kindly will, {{although}} it is not quite in your line. Old Jackson, the editor of The Judge, is a friend of yours, isn't he?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{would be}} too great a condescension, Señor," [...] and Benicia laughed. [...] "I want a promise {{that is to be}} unconditional. Some day, perhaps, I shall <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> to do <b>something</b> for me. Then you will do it {{whatever}} it is." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And now, Miss Ellison, if {{you feel}} equal to it, would you kindly give us an account of what happened?

6000|$|MRS. CHEVELEY. Oh! I don’t {{care about}} the London season! It is too matrimonial. People are either hunting for husbands, or hiding from them. I wanted to meet you. It is quite true.

6000|$|They {{had reached}} an oaken {{door in a}} mossy wall, and Ingleby stood still. [...] "Yes," [...] he said, slowly, [...] "I intend to make it there. Life holds so much--I {{did not know how}} much a little while ago--and there are {{alluring}} possibilities if one has the courage to break away from the groove prejudice and tradition force him into here. I may never see you again--unless I am successful I think I never shall. Would it be a very great presumption if I <b>asked</b> <b>you</b> for <b>something,</b> a trifle, to carry away with me?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I meant it," [...] {{answered}} his nephew, {{speaking in a}} full, strong voice, [...] "because that girl was right {{when she said that}} you had cheated her, and you know that she was right.
