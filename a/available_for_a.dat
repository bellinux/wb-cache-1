5|$|As the Ottoman Empire {{proposed}} international mediation, Cuza {{took the}} initiative, and, on October 23, 1863, deposed the Kretzulescu cabinet, nominating instead his own selection of men: Kogălniceanu as Premier and Interior Minister, Dimitrie Bolintineanu as Minister of Religious Affairs. In {{order to prevent}} further international tensions, they decided to generalize confiscation to all Eastern Orthodox Church estates, Greek {{as well as those}} of the incipient Romanian Orthodox monasteries. The resolution was passed with 97 out of 100 parliamentary votes. Later, the Greek Church was presented with an offer of 150 million piasters as compensation, which was viewed as two low by its intended recipients, including Patriarch Sophoronius III. Consequently, the Romanian state considered the matter closed. As a direct consequence, one third of the arable land in Moldavia and a fourth of that in Wallachia were made <b>available</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> future land reform (one fifth to one fourth of the total arable land in the state as a whole).|$|E
5|$|From 1840 onwards {{he became}} a leading chess commentator, and won matches against top players of the 1840s. In 1847 he entered a {{parallel}} career as a Shakespearean scholar. Ill health and his two writing careers led him to give up competitive chess after 1851. In 1858 {{attempts were made to}} organise a match between Staunton and Paul Morphy, but they failed. It is often alleged that Staunton deliberately misled Morphy while trying to avoid the match, but it is also possible Staunton overestimated his chances of getting physically fit and of making time <b>available</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> match.|$|E

5|$|Just over a {{year after}} being drafted, Brewer signed his first {{professional}} contract with his draft team, the New York Islanders, in August 1998. Entering the NHL, Brewer {{was regarded as a}} future Norris Trophy candidate, and as a result, his contract was an entry level three-year, $2.775-million deal complemented by a $1-million signing bonus, the highest base salary <b>available</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> rookie. Brewer made his NHL debut on October 10, 1998, against the Pittsburgh Penguins, and on November 5, Brewer scored his first career goal against the Carolina Hurricanes' Trevor Kidd. Throughout his rookie season, Brewer was considered {{an integral part of the}} Islanders' defence, and, along with Zdeno Chára, Kenny Jönsson and Roberto Luongo, was considered untouchable by management at the 1999 NHL trade deadline. Brewer finished his rookie season with eleven points in 63 games.|$|E
5|$|Marriages {{were often}} {{the subject of}} careful negotiations, {{particularly}} higher in society. Marriage lost its sacramental status at the Reformation and irregular marriage continued to be accepted as valid throughout the period. Women managed the household and might work beside their husbands and, although obedience to husbands was stressed, {{this may have been}} limited in practice. Divorce developed after the Reformation and was <b>available</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> wider range of causes and accessed by a much larger section of society than in England. Because of high mortality rates widowhood was a relatively common state, and some women acquired independence and status, but others were forced into a marginal existence and remarriage was common. The elaborate funerals and complex system of prayers for the dead that dominated in late Medieval Scotland were removed at the Reformation and simpler services adopted. Burial inside the church was discouraged. As a result separate aisles for the rich and graveyards with stone markers for the majority became common.|$|E
5|$|Newspapers {{reported}} that Myers had {{a monopoly on}} the making of hydrogen gas balloons and was the only producer in the United States of these balloons for the government. A loft in the Myers house was made <b>available</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> sewing area of balloon materials to make the large balloons. The fabric material was patterned, sewed together into large strips, and made ready for varnishing. He had a patent of a fabric made from sea island cotton that {{was used for the}} varnish application. Myers' patented varnish formula made the fabric impervious to hydrogen. The varnish used to seal the fabric material for the balloon envelopes was prepared in a low pit outdoors in a ravine behind the house. This was below ground level so the fabric being prepared was sheltered from the wind. It also provided a fire-pit in case the flammable material caught on fire. There was a water-hose handy for putting out a fire.|$|E

These scholarships are awarded based on performance in subject specific exams or performances, and {{an interview with the}} headmaster for academic or music scholarships, or the presentation of a portfolio of work for the art scholarship. Until the start of the 2009/2010 academic year, the value of scholarships was substantially higher with the King's Scholarships worth 50% of the fees and a range of lower scholarships between 10–30%.|$|E
5|$|Originally, {{when the}} Wii U console was first {{shown at the}} E3 2011 in Los Angeles, Namco {{announced}} that they would develop a Tekken game for the Wii U, which was untitled at the time.

Tekken Tag Tournament 2: Wii U Edition is amongst the first third-party Wii U games that is available in both retail and as a downloadable format for the Nintendo eShop. In Japan, the downloadable version is <b>available</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> slightly lower price than the retail format.|$|E
5|$|Several {{changes have}} been made to the {{gameplay}} mechanics for Guitar Hero II: hammer-on and pull-off functionality has been improved, and three note chords have been introduced, scored as triple points if played correctly. There are additional statistics <b>available</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> song upon completion, and the scores achieved in either Quick Play or Career mode are saved to the same in-game high-score list. The handedness of the guitar can now be toggled from the Pause menu when playing a song (previously, this was only available from the game's main menu). For the Xbox 360 version, scores can also be compared with other players through Xbox Live via the Leaderboard feature, and there are 50 Achievements that can be earned in the game.|$|E

5|$|Sony {{released}} The Interview for rental or purchase in the United States {{through the}} streaming services Google Play, Xbox Video, and YouTube on December 24, 2014. It was also <b>available</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> limited time on SeeTheInterview.com, a website {{operated by the}} stealth startup Kernel.com, which Sony previously worked with to market The Fifth Wave. Within hours, The Interview spread to file sharing websites after a security hole allowed people to download rather than stream the film. TorrentFreak estimated that The Interview had been downloaded illegally via torrents at least 1.5 million times in just two days. On December 27, the North Korean National Defence Commission released a statement accusing President Obama of forcing Sony to distribute the film. The film was released on iTunes on December 28.|$|E
5|$|The {{development}} of such tools {{has been driven}} by the large amount of genomic and proteomic data <b>available</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> variety of organisms, including the human genome. It is simply impossible to study all proteins experimentally, hence only a few are subjected to laboratory experiments while computational tools are used to extrapolate to similar proteins. Such homologous proteins can be efficiently identified in distantly related organisms by sequence alignment. Genome and gene sequences can be searched by a variety of tools for certain properties. Sequence profiling tools can find restriction enzyme sites, open reading frames in nucleotide sequences, and predict secondary structures. Phylogenetic trees can be constructed and evolutionary hypotheses developed using special software like ClustalW regarding the ancestry of modern organisms and the genes they express. The field of bioinformatics is now indispensable for the analysis of genes and proteins.|$|E
5|$|The {{game had}} {{multiple}} versions for players to purchase. A season pass was announced on November 12, 2015.

A Starter Edition was released on PC in June 2016, featuring all the maps, modes and weapons of the standard edition, and included two operators plus enough Rainbow 6 Credits to purchase two more of the player's choice (players could purchase the rest of the operators with Renown or Rainbow 6 Credits). The Starter Edition was cheaper than the main game, and was initially <b>available</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> limited time.
