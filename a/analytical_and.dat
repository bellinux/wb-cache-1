5|$|Cycle detection, {{the problem}} of {{following}} a path in a functional graph to find a cycle in it, has applications in cryptography and computational number theory, as part of Pollard's rho algorithm for integer factorization and as a method for finding collisions in cryptographic hash functions. In these applications, ƒ is expected to behave randomly; Flajolet and Odlyzko study the graph-theoretic properties of the functional graphs arising from randomly chosen mappings. In particular, a form of the birthday paradox implies that, in a random functional graph with n vertices, the path starting from a randomly selected vertex will typically loop back on itself to form a cycle within O(√n) steps. Konyagin et al. have made <b>analytical</b> <b>and</b> computational progress on graph statistics.|$|E
5|$|Perhaps most important, the Analytical Review {{provided}} {{a forum for}} radical political and religious ideas. Although it aimed at impartiality, its articles were often critical of the British government and supportive of the French revolutionaries. While the journal had low circulation numbers for its day, it still influenced popular opinion and was feared by the conservative government of William Pitt the Younger. In late 1797, the Anti-Jacobin, the self-styled nemesis of the Analytical Review, was founded by supporters {{of the government and}} other reactionary interests; it criticized the radical politics of the <b>Analytical</b> <b>and</b> monitored it for unpatriotic and irreligious sentiments.|$|E
5|$|Vector spaces {{have many}} {{applications}} as they occur frequently in common circumstances, namely wherever functions with values in some field are involved. They {{provide a framework}} to deal with <b>analytical</b> <b>and</b> geometrical problems, or {{are used in the}} Fourier transform. This list is not exhaustive: many more applications exist, for example in optimization. The minimax theorem of game theory stating the existence of a unique payoff when all players play optimally can be formulated and proven using vector spaces methods. Representation theory fruitfully transfers the good understanding of linear algebra and vector spaces to other mathematical domains such as group theory.|$|E
