40|$|In this paper, a tunable {{dispersive}} {{delay line}} using <b>all</b> <b>pass</b> <b>network</b> (APN) in UHF-Band {{has been designed}} using lumped elements. Two stages of second order APN has been cascaded, out of which one stage is fixed, where as the other stage is tuned for its group delay response. Tunability is achieved by replacing capacitors with varactor diodes. This approach gives a fractional bandwidth greater than 30 % along with a tunable negative group delay slope of 8 - 3] ns/GHz over the frequency range of 650 - 850] MHz. The input and output matching is better than 10 dB and insertion loss less than 1. 8 dB. Time domain measurements are carried out to validate the tunability in pulse stretching and compression. Such networks {{can be used for}} group delay engineering based applications such as frequency discriminators, spectrum sensing and reflection as well as transmission type group delay based RFID tags...|$|E
40|$|This project {{addresses}} {{the area of}} self testable analogue integrated filters. A novel methodology for structural testing of analogue integrated filters has been investigated and developed. It {{has been shown to}} be very effective in detecting short and open manufacturing faults with up to 98 % fault coverage. The methodology is based on incorporating a simple <b>all</b> <b>pass</b> <b>network</b> to replicate the filter delay and gain at a specific test frequency. Comparing outputs from the filter and equalising network derives a negligibly small signal if the filter is fault free. However, the filter characteristics will change if it becomes faulty, so the compare output will increase. Processing circuitry derives a pass/fail signal from this change. Whilst the methodology is generic and can be applied to filters using different technologies, this project focuses on operational transconductance amplifier capacitor (OTA-C) filters in order to compare with recently reported work. Building blocks for OTA-C simulated ladder filters are included, leading to the design of a 5 th order Chebyshev filter in both single-ended and fully balanced form. The report outline...|$|E

The proposed MSOs provide voltage output and can readily be used for driving voltage input circuits without increasing component count.

40|$|In this study, an {{iterative}} procedure is developed for designing radio frequency circuits with a specified group delay dispersion (GDD) characteristics over a broad bandwidth. Second order <b>all</b> <b>pass</b> <b>networks</b> (APNs) are cascaded systematically over multiple stages {{to achieve the}} same. The approach is flexible enough to design circuits for various group delay responses. This is demonstrated using two-stage APN with {{both positive and negative}} slopes of linear and non-linear group delay responses for a frequency band of 500 MHz- 1 GHz. The proposed multi-stage design procedure is shown to help extend the bandwidth over which a uniform resolution of frequency discrimination is possible. Practical limitations in implementing this circuit are addressed while developing the prototype. The circuit is realised as a surface mount device-based implementation of modified two-stage APN. The realised circuit has a GDD of - 6 ns/GHz and an insertion loss of 1. 2 dB for 500 MHz- 1 GHz band. The performance parameters such as GDD, insertion loss and device footprint of the proposed approach are significantly better than previously reported...|$|R

50|$|A {{bypass switch}} has four ports. Two network ports create an in-line {{connection}} {{in the network}} link {{that is to be}} monitored. This connection is fully passive; if the bypass switch itself loses power, traffic continues to flow unimpeded through the link. Two monitor ports are used to connect the in-line monitoring appliance. During normal operation, the bypass switch <b>passes</b> <b>all</b> <b>network</b> traffic through the appliance as if it were directly in-line itself. But when the in-line appliance loses power, is disconnected, or otherwise fails, the bypass switch passes traffic directly between its network ports, bypassing the appliance, and ensuring that traffic continues to flow on the network link.|$|R

The aim was to test SNA as a method for analysing the structure of passes leading to goals and {{to determine whether there}} were any differences between the <b>passing</b> <b>networks</b> associated with goals scored, by countries of the two different continents. The passes leading to goals during each tournament were represented as networks and analysed using SNA metrics.

No differences were found for all SNA metrics, network duration, and pitch locations between teams from the 2016 EURO and COPA tournaments.

40|$|Is it {{possible}} to have a unique, recognizable style in soccer nowadays? We address this question by proposing a method to quantify the motif characteristics of soccer teams based on their <b>pass</b> <b>networks.</b> We introduce the the concept of "flow motifs" to characterize the statistically significant pass sequence patterns. It extends the idea of the network motifs, highly significant subgraphs that usually consists of three or four nodes. The analysis of the motifs in the <b>pass</b> <b>networks</b> allows us to compare and differentiate the styles of different teams. Although most teams tend to apply homogenous style, surprisingly, a unique strategy of soccer exists. Specifically, FC Barcelona's famous tiki-taka does not consist of uncountable random passes but rather has a precise, finely constructed structure.
