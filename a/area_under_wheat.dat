5000|$|... 49% {{of people}} in India are {{employed}} in agriculture.The introduction of high-yielding varieties of seeds after 1965 and {{the increased use of}} fertilizers and irrigation are known collectively as the Green Revolution, which provided the increase in production needed to make India self-sufficient in food grains. The program was started {{with the help of the}} United States-based Rockefeller Foundation and was based on high-yielding varieties of wheat, rice, and other grains that had been developed in Mexico and in the Philippines. Of the high-yielding seeds, wheat produced the best results. Production of coarse grains--the staple diet of the poor--and pulses--the main source of protein--lagged behind, resulting in reduced per capita availability.The total area under the high-yielding-varieties program was a negligible 1.9 million hectares in FY 1960. Since then growth has been spectacular, increasing to nearly 15.4 million hectares by FY 1970, 43.1 million hectares by FY 1980, and 63.9 million hectares by FY 1990. The rate of growth decreased significantly in the late 1980s, however, as additional suitable land was not available (see table 32, Appendix).The major benefits of the Green Revolution were experienced mainly in northern and northwestern India between 1965 and the early 1980s; the program resulted in a substantial increase in the production of food grains, mainly wheat and rice. Food-grain yields continued to increase throughout the 1980s, but the dramatic changes in the years between 1965 and 1980 were not duplicated. By FY 1980, almost 75 percent of the total cropped <b>area</b> <b>under</b> <b>wheat</b> was sown with high-yielding varieties. For rice the comparable figure was 45 percent. In the 1980s, the area under high-yielding varieties continued to increase, but the rate of growth overall was slower. The eighth plan aimed at making high-yielding varieties available to the whole country and developing more productive strains of other crops.The Green Revolution created wide regional and interstate disparities. The plan was implemented only in areas with assured supplies of water and the means to control it, large inputs of fertilizers, and adequate farm credit. These inputs were easily available in at least parts of the states of Punjab, Haryana, and western Uttar Pradesh; thus, yields increased most in these states. In other states, such as Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu, in areas where these inputs were not assured, the results were limited or negligible, leading to considerable variation in crop yields within these states. The Green Revolution also increased income disparities: higher income growth and reduced incidence of poverty were found in the states where yields increased the most and lower income growth and little change in the incidence of poverty in other states.|$|E

These include the land policy, wheat pricing policy, high irrigation costs and government protection policies on consumers. As a result farmers have been dropping out of wheat production as itâ€™s no longer a profitable crop to grow. This study is aimed at identifying and quantifying the socio-economic factors affecting wheat production in Nyabira, Zvimba district. The study used primary data collected from a sample of 40 randomly selected household from Nyabira. Descriptive and the Cobb-Douglas production function were used to analyse the socio-economic factors affecting wheat production in Nyabira. The results showed that 85 % of the household head attained secondary education level; therefore most of the household head were literate. The majority of the household head were males (75. 5 %). The regression results showed that fertiliser, <b>area</b> <b>under</b> <b>wheat,</b> distance to the market, price and level of education were positively related to output whilst experience in wheat production was negatively related to output. The farmers also faced so many constraints with power shortages being the highly ranked challenge.

The results revealed that the soil microbial biomass Carbon (Cmic), Nitrogen (Nmic), Phosphorous (Pmic), soil enzymes such as Dehydrogenase (DH) and Alkaline Phosphatase (AP) activity entirely depends on the soil water availability under both cropping systems at all height terraces. The wheat-mung bean cropping systems stored relatively more Nmic, Pmic, AP (activity) and less Cmic, DH (activity) as compared to wheat-millet cropping systems. Regarding the slope gradient under both cropping patterns, high height terraces had retained more Cmic contents, medium height terraces had shown more DH activity and low height terraces had maintained more Pmic contents. In addition to this, Nmic contents and AP activity remained almost similar in all types of terraces under both cropping patterns. Pertaining to seasonal variations under both cropping patterns, the summer season had shown more Cmic, Nmic, Pmic, DH and AP activity as compared to spring, winter and autumn season in all types of terraces. The soil water contents increased down to depth in all types of terraces under both cropping patterns. However, soil water contents remained heterogeneous in all types of terraces under both cropping patterns.

If later adoption phases are included in a duration analysis, the difference in wheat area between adopters and non-adopters vanish.

Hence, less intensive producing farms (with lower yield levels) are much more likely to adopt extensive wheat production, which indicates free-riding effects. In contrast, more intensively producing farms, i. e. those farms that may actually harm the environment, usually not adopt extensive wheat production. Thus, aggregated environmental effects of this programme may not reach its full potential and the effectiveness of voluntary participation in agri-environmental programmes should be re-considered.

In this paper we use such indices to examine changes in the genetic diversity of the winter wheat crop in England and Wales between 1923 and 1995. We find that, except for one period characterized by the dominance of imported varieties, the genetic diversity of the winter wheat crop has been remarkably stable. This agrees with many studies of plant breeding programmes elsewhere. However, underlying {{the stability of the}} winter wheat crop is accelerating varietal turnover without any significant diversification of the genetic resources used. Moreover, the changes we observe are more directly attributable to changes in the varietal shares of the <b>area</b> <b>under</b> winter <b>wheat</b> than to the genealogical relationship between the varieties sown. We argue, therefore, that while genealogical indices reflect how well plant breeders have retained and exploited the resources with which they started, these indices suffer from a critical limitation. They do not reflect the proportion of the available range of genetic resources which has been effectively utilized in the breeding programme: complex crosses of a given set of varieties can yield high indices, and yet disguise the loss (or non-utilization) of {{a large proportion of the}} available genetic diversity...|$|R

The strategies proposed are (a) to increase yields in the current irrigated and rainfed wheat areas and (b) to increase the <b>area</b> <b>under</b> rainfed <b>wheat</b> through land conversion. Crop water consumption, based on satellite remote sensing and crop yield data, was used to estimate crop water productivity (CWP) in irrigated and rainfed wheat areas in five sub-basins. CWP for wheat ranges from 0. 5 � 1. 63 kg m- 3 in irrigated areas to 0. 37 � 0. 62 kg m- 3 in rainfed areas. Conditions indicating water-stress in wheat areas were assessed by relative evapotranspiration (ETa/ETp) and showed that water-stress only had a minimal effect for about 154, 000 ha of irrigated wheat (57 %).

The R- 02 category was assigned to rice (kharif) and pulses (rabi) and R- 03 category was assigned to sugarcane (annual) crop. R- 08, R- 02, and R- 03 occupy 59.58, 32.45, and 1.38  % areas, respectively, in the basin. The management inputs on planting, harvesting and irrigation were obtained from the available literature pertaining to the area (Hobbs et al. 1992; Gangwar and Singh 2011). Considerable part of the Gomti River basin is supplied with canal water from Sharda Sahayak canal system. Therefore, water source for the simulation of the rice, sugarcane, and pulse (lentil) was considered as canal water in HRUs, where canal is located, and SWAT recognized the source as outside unlimited source. For the other rice growing HRUs where canal is not located, source of irrigation was considered as shallow aquifer located in the same sub-basin. For irrigation of wheat, auto irrigation option of SWAT was used in which source of irrigation water was considered as shallow aquifer located in the same sub basin. For auto-irrigation, the plant water stress threshold that triggers irrigation was set to 0.9 initially (Arnold et al. 2012).

40|$|Having {{witnessed}} a fast growth, the agriculture in Punjab {{has reached a}} plateau. To sustain even the existing level, the costs are increasing and natural resources are being depleted due to overuse. This study has examined the use of certain resources {{and its impact on}} the cost of production. The data have been collected from different primary and secondary sources. The fast increase in <b>area</b> <b>under</b> rice and <b>wheat</b> appears to be unsustainable due to the fast decline in water table. Therefore, the cost of pumping out water with electricity has been going up, shortage of electric power has resulted in increase in the number of electric and diesel tubewells, further escalating the cost of production. The replenishment of soil health due to depleting macro and micronutrients and increased pesticide-use have also been observed to increase the cost. Thus, the cost on account of these factors together has gone up by Rs 63 /t in wheat and Rs 189 /t in rice. The varietal diversity of wheat has decreased and that of rice crop has increased during the past two and a half decades. The policy measures to minimize excessive use of natural resources requires suitable input pricing, particularly for water resource, improving input-use efficiency and revamping market forces to encourage diversification of state agriculture from rice to alternative crops.

40|$|Growth in the {{agriculture}} sector {{may well be}} judged by the increase in agricultural production over time. In economic terms, relative changes in prices of different crops also may effect substitution. In the Indian context, rice, wheat, maize, millets and pulses are the major food crops. Oilseeds, sugarcane, cotton, jute & mesta, and potatoes are the major cash crops. Tobacco, chillies, ginger, onion, turmeric, tapioca, sweat potatoes, etc. are minor cash crops. Among plantation crops tea, coffee and rubber are important. We observe that cereals and pulses occupy about 3 / 4 th of the gross area under cultivation. A clear trend in an increase in the percentage area under the cash crops is discernible. Plantation crops occupy a very small percentage (less than 1 %) of the total area under crops. Among the food crops, <b>area</b> <b>under</b> <b>wheat</b> has the highest growth rate followed by maize, rice and pulses in that order. The growth rate of area under millets is negative. Among the major cash crops, area under potatoes has grown fastest, followed by oilseeds, sugarcane, cotton and jute in that order. Among the food crops, wheat exhibited the highest growth rate of yield per hectare. Maize followed wheat. These two crops experienced over three fold increase in the yield rate. Rice experienced a little less than three fold increase in the yield rate. Millets and pulses also showed about 30 - 35 percent increase in the yield rate. Introduction of high yielding varieties in wheat, maize and rice coupled with an improved irrigation facilities led to the said spectacular increase in the yield rates of these crops. Among the major cash crops, cotton, sugarcane and jute exhibited two-fold increase in their yield rates. Minhas-Vaidyanathan decomposition scheme is used with 1991 - 92 prices (Wi) of major crops for decomposition analysis of agricultural growth. The percentage contribution of change (increase) in yield rate (Y) is the most dominant component of agricultural growth. The percentage contribution of change (increase) in the gross area under cultivation was the second most potent factor of agricultural growth. agriculture, food crop, cash crops, major crops, India...|$|E
5000|$|As of March 2012, {{the cost}} of living index in the county was a low 82.2 below the {{national}} average of 100.The main economic activity is centered on petroleum and beef. Livestock farming accounts for 89% of the farm income. In the stockyards of Billings and Lewistown, the ranchers market their livestock and sometimes they sell to buyers directly from their ranches. The two towns also have elevators from where crops grown by the ranchers are marketed. Refineries are located in Billings which receives crude through pipes from the Cat Creek Oil Field and also from the Rattlesnake Butte. Agriculture, forestry, fishing and hunting are attributed to 66% of the population. Mining accounts for 58.2% of people in the county while in educational, health and social services 15.5% of people are engaged.Some of the notable ranches in the county are: McArthur Ranch, Maxwell Ranch, Crooked Creek Campground, Fail Ranch, and Novak Homestead. As of 2012, the average size of farms was 6,045 acres and the <b>area</b> <b>under</b> all harvested <b>wheat</b> grain was 14720 acre. [...] The major crops grown in the county are wheat (both winter wheat and spring wheat) and barley. Alfalfa and grass hay are grown as cattle feed under irrigated conditions along the main river course and also on the banks of creeks such as Flat Willow, Box Elder, and Macdonald.|$|R
