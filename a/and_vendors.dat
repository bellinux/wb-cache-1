40|$|We {{develop an}} {{economic}} model that relaxes assumptions in Property Rights Theory {{to allow for}} investment in innovation that can benefit both client <b>and</b> <b>vendor</b> in an IT outsourcing relationship. Our model offers {{an explanation for the}} empirically observed heterogeneity in asset ownership structure. We find that optimal ownership structure can vary due to the different incentives of the client <b>and</b> <b>vendor</b> <b>and</b> differences in the available set of investment opportunities. We show that scenarios exist where the client <b>and</b> <b>vendor</b> agree on the ownership structure and others where they disagree. When investment in innovation enables new services and features then the client should retain ownership of the assets and when it leads to cost savings then the vendor should own the assets. The client <b>and</b> <b>vendor</b> disagree on the asset ownership structure when the investment opportunities yield similar levels of benefits to both <b>vendor</b> <b>and</b> client. In this case neither party wants to own the assets. When there are multiple investment opportunities, both client <b>and</b> <b>vendor</b> prefer to own the assets. We find that allowing renegotiation leads to different ownership preferences. In the absence of renegotiation, the client <b>and</b> <b>vendor</b> agree on the ownership structure in most cases, however when renegotiation is allowed, they always disagree on the ownership structure. We find that allowing renegotiation leads to greater investment in innovation bu...|$|R

5|$|While {{religion}} {{played a}} role in politics, politics also {{played a role}} in religion. In the year 714, Emperor Xuanzong forbade shops <b>and</b> <b>vendors</b> in the city of Chang'an to sell copied Buddhist sutras, instead giving the Buddhist clergy of the monasteries the sole right to distribute sutras to the laity. In the previous year of 713, Emperor Xuanzong had liquidated the highly lucrative Inexhaustible Treasury, which was run by a prominent Buddhist monastery in Chang'an. This monastery collected vast amounts of money, silk, and treasures through multitudes of anonymous people's repentances, leaving the donations on the monastery's premise. Although the monastery was generous in donations, Emperor Xuanzong issued a decree abolishing their treasury on grounds that their banking practices were fraudulent, collected their riches, and distributed the wealth to various other Buddhist monasteries and Daoist abbeys, and to repair statues, halls, and bridges in the city.|$|E

40|$|This study {{identifies}} {{barriers to}} realizing a stewardship relation {{instead of a}} classic principal–agent relation between client <b>and</b> <b>vendor</b> through implementation of an innovative procurement and risk management method, the Best Value approach. This approach focuses on calculus-based trust development {{through the use of}} metrics and alignment of goals and risks between client <b>and</b> <b>vendor.</b> Barriers to realizing a stewardship relation are analysed {{with the use of a}} theoretical framework that incorporates agency theory and stewardship theory. Data was collected in 2013 and 2014 through project documentation and interviews for four case studies at the Dutch Highways Agency. Collected data was used to analyse the roles of the client <b>and</b> <b>vendor,</b> the scope <b>and</b> level of the products and the overall process of the clarification phase of the Best Value approach to identify barriers in practice. Case study findings are analysed and explained by agency theory and stewardship theory. From a theoretical perspective the Best Value approach shows large similarities with stewardship theory. In practice, however, the cases show that the often traditional background of project teams and the lack of experience with Best Value result in a control-oriented relationship between client <b>and</b> <b>vendor</b> characterized by information asymmetry, lack of transparency and distrust. These characteristics of the relationship between client <b>and</b> <b>vendor</b> inhibit the realization of a stewardship relation using the Best Value approach...|$|R
