5|$|Samuel Johnson (18 September 1709 13 December 1784) was an English author born in Lichfield, Staffordshire. He was <b>a</b> <b>sickly</b> infant who {{early on}} began to exhibit the tics that would {{influence}} how people viewed {{him in his}} later years. From childhood he displayed great intelligence and an eagerness for learning, but his early years were dominated by his family's financial strain and his efforts to establish himself as a school teacher.|$|E
5|$|According to Sean Scalmer, Gandhi in {{his final}} year of life was an ascetic, looked ugly and <b>a</b> <b>sickly</b> {{skeletal}} figure, already caricatured in the Western media. Gandhi's public experiments, as they progressed, were widely discussed and criticised by his family members and leading politicians. However, Gandhi {{said that if he}} would not let Manu sleep with him, it would be a sign of weakness. Nirmalkumar Bose, Gandhi's Bengali interpreter, for example criticised Gandhi, not because Gandhi did anything wrong, but because Bose was concerned about the psychological effect on the women who participated in his experiments. Veena Howard states Gandhi's views on brahmacharya and religious renunciation experiments were a method to confront women issues in his times.|$|E

5|$|Braille {{had always}} been <b>a</b> <b>sickly</b> child, and his {{condition}} worsened in adulthood. A persistent respiratory illness, long believed to be tuberculosis, dogged him, and {{by the age of}} forty, he was forced to relinquish his position as a teacher. Despite the lack of a cure at the time, Braille lived with the illness for 16 years. When his condition reached mortal danger, he was admitted to the infirmary at the Royal Institution, where he died in 1852, two days after he had reached the age of forty-three.|$|E
5|$|Richard was <b>a</b> <b>sickly</b> {{child and}} his parents' reduced {{circumstances}} meant that his education was somewhat sporadic. In {{his early years}} he wandered through the fields and brick yards where he lived, picking wildflowers. His favourites were Germander Speedwell, Creeping Tormentil and Common Chickweed. At {{the age of twelve}} he was apprenticed to a bat maker (the maker of children's small leather shoes) named James Heap, in Port Street, Manchester. About 18months later he went to work with James Hyde, with whom he stayed for a number of years.|$|E
5|$|<b>A</b> <b>sickly</b> child, Gordon Childe {{was educated}} {{at home for}} a number of years, before gaining a private school {{education}} in North Sydney. In 1907, he began attending Sydney Church of England Grammar School, gaining his Junior Matriculation in 1909 and Senior Matriculation in 1910. At school he studied ancient history, French, Greek, Latin, geometry, algebra and trigonometry, achieving good marks in all subjects, but was bullied because of his strange appearance and unathletic physique. In July 1910 his mother died; his father soon took Monica Gardiner as his third wife. Childe's relationship with his father was strained, particularly following his mother's death, and they disagreed on the subject of religion and politics, with the Reverend being a devout Christian and conservative while his son was an atheist and socialist.|$|E

5|$|His {{importance}} had dwindled {{with the}} victory of Agnes and her supporters, and with the accession of Baldwin V, infant son of Sibylla and William of Montferrat. Baldwin was <b>a</b> <b>sickly</b> child and he died the next year. In 1186 he was succeeded by his mother Sibylla and her second husband Guy of Lusignan, ruling jointly. William was probably in failing health by this point. Rudolf Hiestand discovered that the date of William's death was 29 September, but the year was not recorded; whatever the year, {{there was a new}} chancellor in May 1185 and a new archbishop of Tyre by 21 October 1186. Hans E. Mayer concluded that William died in 1186, and this is the year generally accepted by scholars.|$|E
5|$|In Game1, Herb Pennock {{pitched the}} Yankees to a 2–1 {{win over the}} Cards. In Game2, pitcher Grover Cleveland Alexander evened the Series for St. Louis with a 6–2 victory. Knuckleballer Jesse Haines' shutout in Game3 gave St. Louis a 2–1 Series lead. In the Yankees' 10–5 Game4 win, Babe Ruth hit three home runs, a World Series record equaled only four times since. According to {{newspaper}} reports, Ruth had promised <b>a</b> <b>sickly</b> boy named Johnny Sylvester to {{hit a home run}} for him in Game4. After Ruth's three-homer game, the boy's condition miraculously improved. The newspapers' account of the story is disputed by contemporary baseball historians, but it {{remains one of the most}} famous anecdotes in baseball history. Pennock again won for the Yankees in Game5, 3–2.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the main quest of defeating the Gym Leaders, there are side quests in which the player can aid NPCs by fulfilling tasks (usually obtaining items); other side quests involve catching legendary Pokémon. The most prominent subplot involves Team Aqua and Team Magma, crime syndicates who want to use Pokémon to alter the climate of Hoenn. In Ruby, the villains, Team Magma, {{want to use the}} legendary Pokémon Groudon to dry up the oceans of Hoenn and increase the region's landmass; in Sapphire, the Team Aqua are the villains and they try to use Groudon's counterpart, Kyogre, to increase the region's water levels. The player's father also introduces the player to Wally, <b>a</b> <b>sickly</b> young boy whom the player helps capture a Pokémon to be his companion as he moves away from the big city. Wally eventually overcomes his illness and becomes a successful Pokémon trainer, ultimately becoming the final challenger the player must face before the Elite Four.|$|E

60|$|Down {{at their}} feet--they {{had made a}} circuit and were facing London again--began the long lines of feeble lights which lit the great avenues {{stretching}} onward to the city, the lights of suburban thoroughfares, of local railways, and {{here and there a}} more brilliant illumination of some picture palace or place of amusement. Farther away still, the vast glow from {{the heart of the city}} was beginning to flare against the murky sky--here red and threatening, as if from some great conflagration; in other places yellow, with <b>a</b> <b>sicklier</b> light of fog-strangled brilliance.|$|R

5|$|On 19 August 1800, when Anning was 15 months old, {{an event}} {{occurred}} that {{became part of}} local lore. She was being held by a neighbour, Elizabeth Haskings, who was standing with two other women under an elm tree watching an equestrian show being put on by a travelling company of horsemen, when lightning struck the tree killing all three women below. Onlookers rushed the infant home where she was revived in a bath of hot water. A local doctor declared her survival miraculous. Her family {{said she had been}} <b>a</b> <b>sickly</b> baby before the event but afterwards she seemed to blossom. For years afterward members of her community would attribute the child's curiosity, intelligence and lively personality to the incident.|$|E

The toys are then placed into a cart pulled by a sad panda which is driven by {{a man with a}} whip. A man {{shipping}} boxes with The Simpsons logo on the side uses the tongue from a severed dolphin head to fasten shut the packages. Another employee uses the horn of <b>a</b> <b>sickly</b> unicorn to smash the holes in the center of The Simpsons DVDs. The shot zooms out to reveal that sweatshop is contained within a grim version of the 20th Century Fox logo, surrounded by barbed wire, searchlights, and a watchtower.|$|E
5|$|Continuing north, {{they soon}} {{run out of}} gas, but receive help from the Aurora Boreanaz, who instructs them to stay at a nearby cabin. The two survive {{the night in the}} cabin and set out on foot the next morning. They finally make it to Santa's workshop, only to find a dark, gloomy factory in a dreary, polluted, lifeless wasteland; Santa <b>a</b> <b>sickly</b> and {{depressed}} old man, the elves all horribly mutated and inbred due to Santa's attempts {{to keep up with the}} increasing gift demands year after year, and the reindeer carnivorous, feral monsters that eat the elves who wander out into the snow to die of exhaustion. Santa suddenly collapses and is too sick to deliver the presents. Brian and Stewie agree to do it, but end up wasting an hour and a half at their first house after the family discover their presence, before discovering they were in the wrong house. Realizing that they will not be able to complete the delivery in time, and understanding firsthand the impossibility of Santa's job, Stewie and Brian abandon the delivery in lieu of another plan.|$|E

25|$|This initial {{foray into}} {{politics}} and the Brooks affair destroyed his law practice.
