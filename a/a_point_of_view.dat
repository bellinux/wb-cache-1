5|$|I was {{of course}} happy to meet the Hizbullah people, because it is <b>a</b> <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>view</b> that is rarely heard in the United States. I have no problem saying that I do want to express {{solidarity}} with them, and I {{am not going to}} be a coward of (sic) a hypocrite about it. I don't care about Hizbullah as a political organization. I don't know much about their politics, and anyhow, it's irrelevant. I don't live in Lebanon. It's a choice that the Lebanese have to make: Who they want to be their leaders, who they want to represent them. But there is a fundamental principle. People have the right to defend their country from foreign occupiers, and people have the right to defend their country from invaders who are destroying their country. That to me is a very basic, elementary and uncomplicated question.|$|E

40|$|Excerpt] Sound {{labor market}} policy {{requires}} sound labor market models. Sound models have three characteristics. First, from <b>a</b> welfare economic <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>view,</b> the policy judgments are explicit, mutually consistent, and thoroughly worked out. Second, from <b>a</b> theoretical <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>view,</b> the models are sufficiently detailed and suitably rigorous. And third, from <b>an</b> empirical <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>view,</b> the models guide and are guided by solid quantitative evidence. This paper reviews models of labor markets {{in developing countries}} from both a positive and <b>a</b> normative <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>view.</b> The survey is selective in that it exposits {{only some of the}} more significant contributions to the literature and highlights the most important gaps and analytical needs...|$|R

25|$|There is <b>a</b> <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>view,</b> much {{propagated}} by Lev Gumilev, {{that the}} Horde and Russian polities {{entered into a}} defensive alliance against the Teutonic knights and pagan Lithuanians. Proponents {{point to the fact}} that the Mongol court was frequented by Russian princes, notably Yaroslavl's Feodor the Black, who boasted his own ulus near Sarai, and Novgorod's Alexander Nevsky, the sworn brother (or anda) of Batu's successor Sartaq Khan. A Mongol contingent supported the Novgorodians in the Battle of the Ice and Novgorodians paid taxes to the Horde.|$|E
25|$|Boromir's {{attempts}} {{to gain the}} Ring for himself {{have been described as}} well-intentioned but oblivious of the potential danger. His perception of Middle-earth is biased by <b>a</b> <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>view</b> that imagines that divine powers have chosen Gondor to lead the fight against evil. He is always eager to praise the great deeds of Gondor, including his own. When his hubris eventually leads him into attacking Frodo to seize the Ring, Boromir seals his own doom by giving in to the malign power of the Ring. He makes way thereby for Aragorn to become the future king of Gondor, {{in a manner similar to}} Virgil's character Turnus.|$|E
25|$|Modern New Testament {{scholarship}} {{tends to}} view these not as separate statements, but rather one statement that has either been preserved {{in two different}} forms, or has been altered by the Gospel writers to present <b>a</b> <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>view</b> that expresses {{the needs of the}} Christian community at the time. The Gospel of Mark, generally considered the earliest of the Gospels, presents the 'inclusive' formulation, in association with an account of Jesus rebuking his followers for stopping someone from carrying out exorcisms in his name. The Gospel of Matthew has the other, 'exclusive' version, preceded by a story about a strong man; the Gospel of Mark also includes this story, but without the concluding observation. The Luke version presents both versions. There is still lively discussion about which version is the more authentic, see also the Jesus Seminar.|$|E

25|$|Yashovijaya {{stressed}} that neutrality {{does not mean}} acceptance of every position whatever, but acceptance only of those that satisfy at least the minimal criteria of clarity and coherence needed to legitimately constitute <b>a</b> <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>view.</b> Hence he criticised the Carvaka philosophy as being too confused in {{their understanding of the}} topic of liberation even to be said to have a ‘view’. He also confronted the Brahmin scholar Raghunatha Siromani, one of the greatest exponent of modern logic during his time, thus proving his extraordinary talent. Paul Dundas notes that, Yashovijaya also criticized the famous Digambara Jain monk Kundakunda for his more reliance on one standpoint. He also strongly attacked the laity based Adhyatmika sect whose de-emphasis on the role of rituals and ascetics was derived from works of Kundakunda and his commentators. At the same time, Yashovijaya also opposed the views of Svetambara monk Dharmasagara for his supremacist perspective of Jainism and exclusivist refusal to accept validity of any religious path except that of Tapa Gachchha (a sub-sect of Svetambara Jains).|$|E

500|$|Launching {{the online}} {{encyclopedia}} project, Schlafly asserted {{the need for}} an alternative to Wikipedia due to editorial philosophy conflicts. The site's [...] "Conservapedia Commandments" [...] differ from Wikipedia's editorial policies. Wikipedia's policies include following a neutral point of view and avoiding original research. In response to Wikipedia's core policy of neutrality, Schlafly has stated: [...] "It's impossible for an encyclopedia to be neutral. I mean let's take <b>a</b> <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>view,</b> let's disclose that point of view to the reader", and [...] "Wikipedia does not poll the views of its editors and administrators.

Franz Michael, however, claims that they were mere [...] "technical advisors", <b>a</b> <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>view</b> supported by Silas Wu.

500|$|Drake, {{who studied}} English {{literature}} at Cambridge, was particularly {{drawn to the}} works of William Blake, William Butler Yeats and Henry Vaughan, and his lyrics reflect such influences. Drake also employs a series of elemental symbols and codes, largely drawn from nature. The moon, stars, sea, rain, trees, sky, mist and seasons are all commonly used, influenced in part by his rural upbringing. Images related to summer figure centrally in his early work; from Bryter Layter on, his language is more autumnal, evoking a season commonly used to convey senses of loss and sorrow. Throughout, Drake writes with detachment, more as an observer than participant, <b>a</b> <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>view</b> Rolling Stone's Anthony DeCurtis described [...] "as if he were viewing his life from a great, unbridgeable distance." ...|$|E
