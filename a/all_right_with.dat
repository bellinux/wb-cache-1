There is no rule in organized baseball prohibiting their participation and never has been to my knowledge. If Durocher, or if any other manager, or all of them, want to sign one, or twenty-five Negro players, it is <b>all</b> <b>right</b> <b>with</b> me. That is the business of the managers and the club owners. The business of the commissioner is to interpret the rules of baseball, and to enforce them.|$|E

Since this would be his first onscreen kiss, Boone said that he wanted to talk to his wife first, {{to make sure it was}} <b>all</b> <b>right</b> <b>with</b> her.

500|$|... "My Father's Song", {{like the}} {{majority}} of the tracks on Lazy Afternoon, is a [...] "sympathetic" [...] ballad that focuses heavily on Streisand's vocals. According to the official sheet music published by the Warner Music Group, the song is written in the key of D major with a moderately slow beat consisting of 125 beats per minute. In the lyrics of [...] "My Father's Song", Streisand sings about discussions with her father where he claims, [...] "Whatever you are, you're going to be / Whatever you are is <b>all</b> <b>right</b> <b>with</b> me".|$|E

It moved beautifully. Obviously, no one in the cast or crew was willing to take sides, particularly not my side. This was <b>all</b> <b>right</b> <b>with</b> me. I'd had to stand alone before. At least my mother was there to support me in the confrontation with the entire front office, plus Fred Astaire and Mark Sandrich." ...|$|E

500|$|The title song, [...] "Tupelo Honey", is {{a classic}} love ballad in a vein {{established}} with [...] "Crazy Love" [...] from the album Moondance. The two songs both have the same melody, chord progression and are in 4/4 time. [...] Uncut reviewer David Cavanagh wrote that: [...] "On an album where the vocals are exultant to say the least, this song sees Morrison use larynx, diaphragm, teeth and tongue {{to find new ways}} of enunciating the lines 'she's as sweet as Tupelo honey' and 'she's <b>all</b> <b>right</b> <b>with</b> me', seemingly in ever-increasing adoration." [...] Bob Dylan (who performed the song with Morrison during a concert tour in the 1990s) once remarked that [...] "'Tupelo Honey' has always existed and that Morrison was merely the vessel and the earthly vehicle for it". Greil Marcus called the song [...] "a kind of odyssey" [...] evoking Elvis Presley (whose hometown was Tupelo, Mississippi), and [...] "the most gorgeous number on the album" [...] that [...] "was too good not to be true." ...|$|E
500|$|On May 29, Conley {{was interviewed}} for four hours. His new {{affidavit}} said that Frank told him, [...] "he {{had picked up}} a girl back there and let her fall and that her head hit against something." [...] Conley said he and Frank took the body to the basement via the elevator, then returned to Frank's office where the murder notes were dictated. Conley then hid in the wardrobe after the two {{had returned to the}} office. He said Frank gave him $200, but took it back, saying, [...] "Let me have that and I will make it <b>all</b> <b>right</b> <b>with</b> you Monday if I live and nothing happens." [...] Conley's affidavit concluded, [...] "The reason I have not told this before is I thought Mr. Frank would get out and help me out and I decided to tell the whole truth about this matter." [...] At trial, Conley changed his story concerning the $200. He said Frank decided to withhold the money until Conley had burned Phagan's body in the basement furnace.|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} generally mixed reviews. SFX {{described it}} as an [...] "okay" [...] episode that was reminiscent of the earlier episode [...] "The End of the World." [...] Despite praising Pegg, the theme of [...] "media control," [...] and the Jagrafess, they criticised it for [...] " [...] to capture the imagination" [...] because there was [...] "no real palpable sense of threat" [...] and that human culture looked identical to modern day. Rupert Smith of The Guardian wrote, [...] "Anything that satirises the profession of journalism is <b>all</b> <b>right</b> <b>with</b> me, but this did it with style." [...] Arnold T Blumburg of Now Playing gave [...] "The Long Game" [...] a grade of B-, describing it as [...] "entertaining" [...] and a welcome throwback to the classic series. However, he questioned the developing tradition of the Doctor not being {{the hero of the}} episode and noted that there were some dangling threads. Reviewing the episode in 2013, Patrick Mulkern of Radio Times was more positive, writing that it [...] "acts brilliantly as a satire of the media." [...] He also praised the guest cast and characters and Adam's departure. In 2011, Den of Geek's Mark Harrison wrote that [...] "In retrospect, 'The Long Game' is an underrated and perfectly enjoyable mid-series episode," [...] praising Adam's departure.|$|E

500|$|The police {{tried to}} {{restrain}} {{some of the}} crowd, and knocked a few people down, which incited bystanders even more. Some of those handcuffed in the wagon escaped when police left them unattended (deliberately, according to some witnesses). As the crowd tried to overturn the police wagon, two police cars and the wagon—with a few slashed tires—left immediately, with Inspector Pine urging them to return as soon as possible. The commotion attracted more people who learned what was happening. Someone in the crowd declared that the bar had been raided because [...] "they didn't pay off the cops", to which someone else yelled [...] "Let's pay them off!" [...] Coins sailed through the air towards the police as the crowd shouted [...] "Pigs!" [...] and [...] "Faggot cops!" [...] Beer cans were thrown and the police lashed out, dispersing some of the crowd who found a construction site nearby with stacks of bricks. The police, outnumbered by between 500 and 600people, grabbed several people, including folk singer Dave Van Ronk—who had been attracted to the revolt from a bar two doors away from the Stonewall. Though Van Ronk was not gay, he had experienced police violence when he participated in antiwar demonstrations: [...] "As far as I was concerned, anybody who'd stand against the cops was <b>all</b> <b>right</b> <b>with</b> me, and that's why I stayed in... Every time you turned around the cops were pulling some outrage or another." [...] Ten police officers—including two policewomen—barricaded themselves, Van Ronk, Howard Smith (a writer for The Village Voice), and several handcuffed detainees inside the Stonewall Inn for their own safety.|$|E
500|$|Spears {{originally}} envisioned [...] "Sheryl Crow music, but younger more adult contemporary", {{but felt}} <b>all</b> <b>right</b> <b>with</b> her label's producers, since [...] "It made {{more sense to}} go pop, because I can dance to it—it's more me." [...] The album opens with the first single [...] "...Baby One More Time", a teen pop and dance-pop song that begins with a three-note motif in the bass range of the piano. The opening was compared to many other songs, such as [...] "We Will Rock You" [...] (1977), [...] "Start Me Up" [...] (1981), [...] "These Words" [...] (2004) and the theme song of the film Jaws {{due to the fact}} the track [...] "makes its presence known in exactly one second". According to magazine Blender, [...] "...Baby One More Time" [...] is composed by [...] "wah-wah guitar lines and EKG-machine bass-slaps". Claudia Mitchell and Jacqueline Reid-Walsh, authors of Girl Culture: Studying girl culture : a readers' guide (2008), observed that the lyrics of the song [...] "gesture toward [...] longing for the return of an ex-boyfriend." [...] The next song and third single, [...] "(You Drive Me) Crazy" [...] runs through a moderately slow dance beat, and has a rhythm and blues melody mixed with edgy synthesized instrumentals. The third track and second single [...] "Sometimes" [...] is a ballad, that Spears begins with [...] "You tell me you're in love with me/That you can't take your pretty eyes away from me/It's not that I don't wanna stay/But every time you come too close I move away". Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic noted the song has [...] "a catchy hook and endearing melody, with a reminiscent euro-dance rhythm." ...|$|E
500|$|In June 1997, Spears was {{in talks}} with manager Lou Pearlman to join female pop group Innosense. Lynne Spears asked family friend and {{entertainment}} lawyer Larry Rudolph for his opinion and submitted a tape of Spears singing over a Whitney Houston karaoke song along with some pictures. Rudolph {{decided he wanted to}} pitch her to record labels, therefore she needed a professional demo. He sent Spears an unused song from Toni Braxton; she rehearsed for a week and recorded her vocals in a studio with a sound engineer. Spears traveled to New York with the demo and met with executives from four labels, returning to Kentwood the same day. Three of the labels rejected her, arguing audiences wanted pop bands such as the Backstreet Boys and the Spice Girls, and [...] "there wasn't going to be another Madonna, another Debbie Gibson, or another Tiffany." [...] Two weeks later, executives from JIVE Records returned calls to Rudolph. Senior vice president of A Jeff Fenster stated about Spears's audition that [...] "It's very rare to hear someone that age who can deliver emotional content and commercial appeal. [...] For any artist, the motivation—the 'eye of the tiger'— is extremely important. And Britney had that." [...] They appointed her to work with producer Eric Foster White for a month, who reportedly shaped her voice from [...] "lower and less poppy" [...] delivery to [...] "distinctively, unmistakably Britney." [...] After hearing the recorded material, president Clive Calder ordered a full album. Spears had originally envisioned [...] "Sheryl Crow music, but younger more adult contemporary" [...] but felt <b>all</b> <b>right</b> <b>with</b> her label's appointment of producers, since [...] "It made more sense to go pop, because I can dance to it—it's more me." [...] She flew to Cheiron Studios in Stockholm, Sweden, where half of the album was recorded from March to April 1998, with producers Max Martin, Denniz Pop and Rami Yacoub, among others.|$|E

[...] Safin said the main reason for his 25-year-old sister's retirement was a chronic back injury. [...] "Everything is <b>all</b> <b>right</b> <b>with</b> her health. She feels good in everyday life, but (the back injury means) she simply can't play tennis professionally any more."

2500|$|Porter {{began the}} 1950s with Out Of This World (1950), which {{had some good}} numbers but too much camp and vulgarity, and was not greatly successful.

[...] Porter wrote two more film scores and music for a television special before ending his Hollywood career. The film High Society (1956), starring Bing Crosby, Frank Sinatra and Grace Kelly, included Porter's last major hit song, [...] "True Love". The film was later adapted as a stage musical of the same name. Porter also wrote numbers for the film Les Girls (1957), which starred Gene Kelly.
