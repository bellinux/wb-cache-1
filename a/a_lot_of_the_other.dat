25|$|Demolition {{of the old}} Waldorf–Astoria {{began on}} October 1, 1929. Stripping the building's {{materials}} was an arduous process, as the hotel was made of stiffer material than earlier buildings had, and the granite, precious metals, and wood chips used in the old hotel were not in high demand. Most of the wood eventually either went into a woodpile on nearby 30th Street or was burned in a swamp elsewhere. <b>A</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> materials {{that made up the}} old hotel, including the granite and bronze, were dumped into the Atlantic Ocean off the shore of Sandy Hook, New Jersey.|$|E

500|$|The {{following}} week, {{after one}} further substitute appearance, O'Keefe was handed his first league start for Southend by manager Steve Tilson against Leeds United at Elland Road on 27 January 2009. However, this {{proved to be}} his last appearance for the club during the 2008–09 season. Despite this, O'Keefe was nominated for the League One Apprentice of the Year award, eventually losing out to Carlisle United defender Tom Aldred. The following season, O'Keefe featured more regularly for the first team, making nine appearances in total despite missing two months of the season due to a hernia injury sustained in a match against Millwall on 26 January 2010. Following his departure from Roots Hall, the club's head of youth director Ricky Duncan praised O'Keefe's attitude, stating [...] "Stuart was always very driven and single-minded and he was different to <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> lads in that regard." ...|$|E

Of this, Badler said [...] "She is the smiling assassin, but she's irresistible as she has the wit, the brain and the moves to get away with it!" [...] To go with her job and personality, Diana has a glamorous wardrobe, which Badler said is the complete opposite of hers.

IGN's Ramsey Isler rated the episode 7.4/10, explaining the case-of-the-week failed to have [...] "excitement, surprise, and suspense" [...] and lacked [...] "what makes a typical Fringe episode unique and intriguing". While calling certain parts [...] "kind of boring", Isler did however praise the episode's directing, acting, sets, and other technical aspects. He concluded his review by noting the best part of [...] "Dream Logic" [...] was the ending depicting a young Peter, [...] "It's a haunting scene, and it adds yet another stone in this long pathway to revelation that the Fringe team is building up to...
