5|$|Haumea (43.13AU average) is in {{an orbit}} similar to Makemake except {{that it is in}} a 7:12 orbital {{resonance}} with Neptune. It is about the same size as Makemake and has two natural satellites. A rapid, 3.9-hour rotation gives it <b>a</b> <b>flattened</b> and elongated shape. It was named and designated a dwarf planet in 2008.|$|E
5|$|The mouth opens into <b>a</b> <b>flattened</b> pharynx. This {{consists}} of an in-folding of the body wall, and is therefore lined by the animal's epidermis. The pharynx typically runs for about one third {{the length of the}} body before opening into the gastrovascular cavity that occupies the remainder of the body.|$|E
5|$|Toroids : The fossil Vendoglossa tuberculata {{from the}} Nama Group, Namibia, has been {{interpreted}} as a dorso-ventrally compressed stem-group metazoan, with a large gut cavity and a transversely ridged ectoderm. The organism is {{in the shape of}} <b>a</b> <b>flattened</b> torus, with the long axis of its toroidal body running through the approximate center of the presumed gut cavity.|$|E

30|$|Indeed, {{the debate}} about <b>a</b> <b>flattening</b> of the PC in {{advanced}} economies started before the global financial crisis. Borio and Filardo (2007) relate it to a structural change due to globalization and the stringer competitive pressure of Asian economies. Gaiotti (2010), using firm-level data, confirms the existence of <b>a</b> <b>flattening</b> but finds {{that it is not}} related to globalization but is probably related to the moderate dynamics of inflation expectations.|$|R
5|$|In {{addition}} to this primary compression wave, other waves, known as harmonics, are created. Harmonics are caused by factors including the imperfect wobbling and shaking of the reed, the reed sealing the mouthpiece opening {{for part of the}} wave cycle (which creates <b>a</b> <b>flattened</b> section of the sound wave), and imperfections (bumps and holes) in the bore. A wide variety of compression waves are created, but only some (primarily the odd harmonics) are reinforced. These extra waves are what gives the clarinet its characteristic tone.|$|E
5|$|In deposit, {{the spores}} are bright {{yellowish}} orange. Ascospores are smooth, elliptical, and typically measure 20–25 by 12–16µm. Asci (spore-bearing cells) are eight-spored, cylindrical, hyaline (translucent), and measure 225–325 by 15–22.5µm. Paraphyses are septate, and cylindrical with tips that are rounded to club-shaped, and measure 150–275 by 7–15µm. Hyphal cells on sterile ridges are septate, measuring 100–175 by 10–25µm. They are tightly packed {{in an even}} layer. The terminal hyphae are club-shaped to somewhat rectangular with <b>a</b> <b>flattened</b> to broadly rounded tip.|$|E
5|$|Multiple eruptions of silica-rich {{rhyolite}} from 40,000 to 600 {{years ago}} built the Mono Craters. Black Point, {{today on the}} north shore of Mono Lake, is <b>a</b> <b>flattened</b> volcanic cone of basaltic debris that formed under the surface of a much deeper Mono Lake about 13,300 years ago, during the most-recent glacial period. Several eruptive episodes from 1,600 to 270 years before present in Mono Lake formed Negit Island. The magma reservoir feeding the Mono Lake Volcanic Field is unrelated to the Mono Craters magma reservoir.|$|E
40|$|Previous reports using {{stimulus}} intensity {{changes to}} disrupt temporal discrimination have shown {{shifts in the}} psychophysical curve for time, while studies using other disruptors have shown <b>a</b> <b>flattening</b> of the curve. The current study investigated the impact of increases and decreases in stimulus intensity on temporal discrimination in pigeons, to determine if <b>a</b> <b>flattening</b> of the curve could be extended to this disruptor. The brightness of the sample to be timed was manipulated under two procedural variations, in which the response alternatives were differentiated by color or location. Results showed that all subjects in the color procedure, {{and one in the}} location procedure, showed <b>a</b> <b>flattening</b> of the psychophysical curve when they experienced increased stimulus intensity in descending order. No subjects exposed to an ascending order of stimulus intensities, and none of the other subjects in the location procedure, showed any impact of changed stimulus intensity. Minimal disruption was found when test sessions presented decreased stimulus intensity levels in a second series. These results, together with those using other types of disruptors, add to the evidence of <b>a</b> <b>flattening</b> of the psychophysical curve when temporal discrimination is disrupted.

5|$|Nasodigitoacoustic {{syndrome}} is congenital and {{is characterized by}} a number of nasal, facial and cranial features. These include a broad and high, sometimes depressed nasal bridge (top of the nose, between the eyes) and <b>a</b> <b>flattened</b> nasal tip. This can give the nose a shortened, arch-like appearance. Hypertelorism (unusually wide-set eyes), prominent frontal bones and supraorbital ridge (the eyebrow ridge), bilateral epicanthic folds (an extra flap of skin over the eyelids), a broad forehead and an overall enlarged head circumference have also been observed. A bulging of the upper lip with an exaggerated cupid's bow shape, and maxillary hypoplasia (underdevelopment of the upper jaw) with retraction have also been reported.|$|E
5|$|The {{caudal fin}} is homocercal, meaning {{the upper and}} lower lobes are about equal in size. The spine ends at the caudal peduncle, the base of the caudal fin, {{distinguishing}} this group from those in which the spine extends into the upper lobe of the caudal fin, such as most fish from the Paleozoic (541 to 252 million years ago). The neural arches are elongated to form uroneurals which provide support for this upper lobe. In addition, the hypurals, bones that form <b>a</b> <b>flattened</b> plate at the posterior end of the vertebral column, are enlarged providing further support for the caudal fin.|$|E
5|$|The sand devil has <b>a</b> <b>flattened,</b> {{moderately}} {{narrow body}} with greatly enlarged pectoral and pelvic fins. The skin folds {{along the sides}} of the head have smooth margins, without lobes. The large eyes are placed on top of the head and have prominent spiracles behind. The nostrils bear thin, pointed barbels with smooth or slightly fringed margins. The wide mouth is positioned terminally on the head. The jaws contain 10 upper and 9 lower tooth rows on each side, with toothless gaps at the middle. Each tooth has a broad base and a single pointed cusp with smooth edges. There are five pairs of gill slits located {{on the sides of the}} head.|$|E
50|$|Plagiocephaly is {{the word}} {{that is used to}} {{describe}} a diagonal asymmetry across the head shape. This word particularly describes <b>a</b> <b>flattening</b> which is to one side {{at the back of the}} head and there is often some facial asymmetry. Plagiocephaly divides into two groups: synostotic plagiocephaly, with one or more fused cranial sutures, and nonsynostotic (deformational) plagiocephaly. Surgical treatment of these groups includes the deference method; however, the treatment of deformational plagiocephaly is controversial. Brachycephaly describes a very wide head shape with <b>a</b> <b>flattening</b> across the whole back of the head.|$|R
40|$|There are {{currently}} several commercially available radiotherapy treatment units without <b>a</b> <b>flattening</b> filter in the beam line. Unflattened photon beams have an energy and lateral fluence distribution {{that is different}} from conventional beams and, thus, their attenuation properties differ. As <b>a</b> consequence, for <b>flattening</b> filter free (FFF) beams, the relationship between the beam-quality specifier TPR 20, 10 and the Spencer-Attix restricted water-to-air mass collision stopping-power ratios, L̄/ρair (water), may have to be refined in order to be used with equivalent accuracy as for beams with <b>a</b> <b>flattening</b> filter. The purpose of this work was twofold. First, to study the relationship between TPR 20, 10 and L̄/ρair (water) for FFF beams, where the flattening filter {{has been replaced by a}} metal plate as in most clinical FFF beams. Second, to investigate the potential of increasing the accuracy in determining L̄/ρair (water) by adding another beam-quality metric, TPR 10, 5. The relationship between L̄/ρair (water) and %dd(10) x for beams with and without <b>a</b> <b>flattening</b> filter was also included in this study...|$|R

5|$|The {{tetrapods}} {{have their}} {{root in the}} early Devonian tetrapodomorph fish. Primitive tetrapods developed from an osteolepid tetrapodomorph lobe-finned fish (sarcopterygian-crossopterygian), with a two-lobed brain in <b>a</b> <b>flattened</b> skull. The coelacanth group represents marine sarcopterygians that never acquired these shallow-water adaptations. The sarcopterygians apparently took two different lines of descent and are accordingly separated into two major groups: the Actinistia (including the coelacanths) and the Rhipidistia (which include extinct lines of lobe-finned fishes that evolved into the lungfish and the tetrapodomorphs).|$|E
5|$|This group {{contains}} {{shallots and}} potato onions, {{also referred to}} as multiplier onions. The bulbs are smaller than those of common onions, and a single plant forms an aggregate cluster of several bulbs. They are propagated almost exclusively from daughter bulbs, although reproduction from seed is possible. Shallots are the most important subgroup within this group and comprise the only cultivars cultivated commercially. They form aggregate clusters of small, narrowly ovoid to pear-shaped bulbs. Potato onions differ from shallots in forming larger bulbs with fewer bulbs per cluster, and having <b>a</b> <b>flattened</b> (onion-like) shape. However, intermediate forms exist.|$|E
5|$|Mulder goes {{to see the}} Shooter, despite Spender's objections. Mulder {{wants to}} give the Shooter {{immunity}} in exchange for testimony, which the Shooter refuses. Gibson proves his abilities {{to a group of}} clinicians while Scully and Fowley watch. The guard at the prison hands the Shooter <b>a</b> <b>flattened</b> Morley cigarette box that says he's a dead man. Scully visits the Lone Gunmen, wanting them to analyze the data from Gibson. She asks them who Diana is, and they tell her she worked closely with Mulder when he discovered the X-Files. The Smoking Man meets with Jeffrey in the FBI parking lot, but disappears when Mulder spots them talking. Scully and Mulder present to Skinner on Gibson, who displays extraordinary brain activities. Mulder believes that Gibson is the key to everything in the X-Files, and wants to make a deal with the Shooter. Diana and Skinner think this may result in adverse attention from the attorney general, and that the X-Files could be closed down if things go wrong, but Mulder dismisses that risk.|$|E
25|$|Neptune, the {{farthest}} planet from Earth, {{has increased in}} brightness since 1980. Neptune's brightness is statistically correlated with its stratospheric temperature. Hammel and Lockwood hypothesize that the change in brightness includes a solar variation component {{as well as a}} seasonal component, though they did not find a statistically significant correlation with solar variation. They propose that the resolution of this issue will be clarified by brightness observations in the next few years: forcing by a change in sub-solar latitude should be reflected in <b>a</b> <b>flattening</b> and decline of brightness, while solar forcing should be reflected in <b>a</b> <b>flattening</b> and then resumed rise of brightness.|$|R

5|$|Mulder {{meets with}} the Shooter again, who {{tells him that}} Gibson is a missing link. Mulder {{believes}} that Gibson has genes that are dormant in most humans. The Smoking Man dismisses the Well-Manicured Man's concerns about Mulder's actions. At the prison, the guard kills the Shooter. Diana Fowley, protecting Gibson in a hotel room, is shot shortly afterwards, and Gibson is captured by the Smoking Man's minions. Skinner tells Mulder of the Shooter's death, and that <b>a</b> <b>flattened</b> Morley cigarette box was found in his cell. Mulder confronts Spender, accusing him {{of working with the}} Smoking Man. The Smoking Man turns Gibson over to the Well-Manicured Man. Scully is informed by Skinner that the Justice Department is seeking to have the X-Files shut down. Mulder realizes that this was all part of a plan. The Smoking Man takes Samantha's X-File from Mulder's office, and lights the room on fire. As he leaves, he meets Jeffrey, and tells him that he's his father. By the time Mulder and Scully arrive, the X-Files are completely destroyed.|$|E
5|$|The eyes of baleen {{whales are}} {{relatively}} small for their size and are positioned {{near the end of}} the mouth. This is probably because they feed on slow or immobile prey, combined with the fact that most sunlight does not pass , and hence they do not need acute vision. A whale's eye is adapted for seeing both in the euphotic and aphotic zones by increasing or decreasing the pupil's size to prevent damage to the eye. As opposed to land mammals which have <b>a</b> <b>flattened</b> lens, whales have a spherical lens. The retina is surrounded by a reflective layer of cells (tapetum lucidum), which bounces light back at the retina, enhancing eyesight in dark areas. However, light is bent more near the surface of the eye when in air as opposed to water; consequently, they can see much better in the air than in the water. The eyeballs are protected by a thick outer layer to prevent abrasions, and an oily fluid (instead of tears) on the surface of the eye. Baleen whales appear to have limited color vision, as they lack S-cones.|$|E
5|$|The eyes of {{pinnipeds}} {{are relatively}} large for {{their size and}} are positioned {{near the front of}} the head. One exception is the walrus, whose smaller eyes are located on the sides of its head. This is because it feeds on immobile bottom dwelling mollusks and hence does not need acute vision. A seal's eye is adapted for seeing both underwater and in air. The lens is mostly spherical, and much of the retina is equidistant from the lens center. The cornea has <b>a</b> <b>flattened</b> center where refraction is nearly equal in both water and air. Pinnipeds also have very muscular and vascularized irises. The well-developed dilator muscle gives the animals a great range in pupil dilation. When contracted, the pupil is typically pear-shaped, although the bearded seal's is more diagonal. In species that live in shallow water, such as harbor seals and California sea lions, dilation varies little, while the deep-diving elephant seals have much greater variation.|$|E

5|$|Lactarius blennius has <b>a</b> <b>flattened</b> convex {{cap that}} is 4–10cm (1.6–4in) across that later becomes {{depressed}} in the centre. In colour, it is pale olive to a greenish grey, sometimes a dull green or pale grey-sepia, and has blotches of darker colouration in concentric bands, though the colour can vary greatly. Heavily spotted specimens are also known, {{and a very}} brown specimen similar to Lactarius circellatus was recorded in Scotland. The cap is very slimy when moist and has a margin that is curved inwards. The stem is a paler colour than the cap, but also very slimy, and measures from 4–5cm (1.6–2in) tall by 1–1.7cm (0.4–0.7in) thick, tapering a little towards the bottom. The flesh is whitish, similar in colour to the gills, which later become a creamy or pale buff colour. The gills turn a brownish-grey colour when wounded, and are crowded. In shape, they are slightly decurrent or adnate, meaning that they run a small way down the stem in attachment, or that they {{are attached to the}} stem by the whole depth of the gills. The milk is white and dries grey, and is very plentiful. L.blennius spores leave a creamy print, and are elliptic with low warts joined by ridges with a small number of cross-connections, measuring from 6–9 by 5.5–7µm.|$|E
5|$|The goblin shark has a distinctively {{long and}} flat snout, {{resembling}} a sword blade. The proportional {{length of the}} snout decreases with age. The eyes are small and lack protective nictitating membranes; behind the eyes are spiracles. The large mouth is parabolic in shape. The jaws are highly protrusible and can be extended almost {{to the end of}} the snout, though normally they are held flush against the underside of the head. It has 35–53 upper and 31–62 lower tooth rows. The teeth in the main part of the jaws are long and narrow, particularly those near the symphysis (jaw midpoint), and are finely grooved lengthwise. The rear teeth near the corners of the jaw are small and have <b>a</b> <b>flattened</b> shape for crushing. Much individual variation in tooth length and width occurs, in whether the teeth have a smaller cusplet on each side of the main cusp, and in the presence of toothless gaps at the symphysis or between the main and rear teeth. The five pairs of gill slits are short, with the gill filaments inside partly exposed; the fifth pair is above the origin of the pectoral fins.|$|E
