5|$|US2/US141 re-enters Michigan {{where it}} crosses the Menominee River and {{subsequently}} meets M‑95 in Breitung Township north of Iron Mountain and Kingsford. The highways merge in a triple concurrency and run south on Stephenson Avenue into Iron Mountain {{along the west}} side of Lake Antoine, parallel to a branch line of the Escanaba and Lake Superior Railroad (ELS Railroad). The road crosses through a retail corridor and over a flooded pit of the Chapin Mine. In downtown Iron Mountain at Ludington Street, M‑95 turns west off Stephenson Avenue to run <b>across</b> <b>town</b> <b>to</b> Kingsford. US2/US141 exits downtown and turns east along a second retail corridor near the Midtown Mall. The highway re-enters Breitung Township where US141 separates to the south to re-enter Wisconsin. US2 continues eastward parallel to a branch of the Canadian National Railway (CN Railway). Both road and rail travel through the community of Quinnesec, where they pass near the largest paper mill in the UP. The trunkline runs along the main street of Norway, where the highway meets the eastern terminus of US8. Then US2 continues east through rural Dickinson County to Vulcan, passing north of Hanbury Lake through the Copper Country State Forest, before crossing the Sturgeon River in Loretto and passing into Menominee County.|$|E

25|$|When the {{railroad}} {{came to town}} in the 1860s Park Street developed into the major thoroughfare {{of the city and}} the location of the main Alameda train station, residents of Old Alameda pulled up stakes and moved <b>across</b> <b>town</b> <b>to</b> the new downtown. The street's location was chosen by two landowners who wished to attract tenants and development to their land. As a result, they designated their mutual property line as Park Street.|$|E

25|$|According to the Christian Heritage Academy website, {{the school}} began in 1972 {{with a vision}} of Sunnyside Baptist Church and its pastor, Harry Boydstun. Prior to the school's founding, {{demographic}} changes in primary education were taking place in Oklahoma City and in other cities across America. In the 1971 Swann v. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Board of Education ruling, the Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of busing to end school segregation and dual school systems. The federal courts began mandating that enrollment be racially balanced {{in the public school}} systems and be achieved through the forced busing of elementary students. Many parents were alarmed that the public schools were being radically reorganized and their children would be transported miles <b>across</b> <b>town</b> <b>to</b> be taught in some other place than their neighborhood schools. The movement of large numbers of white families to suburbs of large cities, so-called white flight and a string of Supreme Court decisions, reduced the effectiveness of the busing policy.|$|E
500|$|As older {{forms of}} {{transportation}} {{such as the}} canal boat disappeared, new forms arose. One of these, the electric trolley, began operation in Lock Haven in 1894. The Lock Haven Electric Railway, managed by the Lock Haven Traction Company and after 1900 by the Susquehanna Traction Company, ran passenger trolleys between Lock Haven and Mill Hall, about [...] to the west. The trolley line extended from the Philadelphia and Erie Railroad station in Lock Haven to a station of the Central Railroad of Pennsylvania, which served Mill Hall. The route went through Lock Haven's downtown, close to the Normal School, <b>across</b> <b>town</b> <b>to</b> the trolley car barn on the southwest edge of the city, through Flemington, over the Bald Eagle Canal and Bald Eagle Creek, and on to Mill Hall via what was then known as the Lock Haven, Bellefonte, and Nittany Valley Turnpike. Plans to extend the line from Mill Hall to Salona, [...] south of Mill Hall, and to Avis [...] northeast of Lock Haven, were never carried out, and the line remained unconnected to other trolley lines. The system, always financially marginal, declined after World War I. Losing business to automobiles and buses, it ceased operations around 1930.|$|E

500|$|Soon after Landis's appointment, he {{surprised}} {{the major league}} owners by requiring that they disclose their minor league interests. Landis fought against the practice of [...] "covering up", using transfers between two teams controlled by the same major league team to make players ineligible for the draft. His first formal act as commissioner was to declare infielder Phil Todt a free agent, dissolving his contract with the St. Louis Browns (at the time run by Rickey, who soon thereafter moved <b>across</b> <b>town</b> <b>to</b> run the Cardinals); in 1928, he ruled future Hall of Famer Chuck Klein a free agent as he held the Cardinals had tried to cover Klein up. [...] The following year, he freed Detroit Tigers prospect and future Hall of Famer Rick Ferrell, who attracted a significant signing bonus from the Browns. [...] In 1936, Landis found that teenage pitching prospect Bob Feller's signing by minor league club Fargo-Moorhead had been a charade; the young pitcher was {{for all intents and}} purposes property of the Cleveland Indians. However, Feller indicated that he wanted to play for Cleveland and Landis issued a ruling which required the Indians to pay damages to minor league clubs, but allowed them to retain Feller, who went on to a Hall of Fame career with the Indians.|$|E
2500|$|In , Kelly {{returned}} to Cincinnati as {{the captain of}} a newly established American Association club there. The team was generally known as the Reds, but were also often called [...] "Kelly's Killers" [...] in the media due to Kelly's strong presence. The team was in seventh place when it folded in mid-August, and Kelly signed with the Boston Reds, who {{had moved to the}} Association after the Players' League folded. He spent just four games with the Reds before jumping back <b>across</b> <b>town</b> <b>to</b> the Beaneaters to finish out the season.|$|E
2500|$|The {{most popular}} venues for popular music, satire and comic songs {{continued}} to be the stages at the major fairs, where crowds listened to satirical, comical and sentimental songs, though they were only open part of the year. In 1742, the royal government decided that the street singers on the Pont-Neuf were a public nuisance, and were blocking traffic. Only booksellers were allowed to remain, {{and they had to}} pay a fee to the royal government. The street and popular musicians migrated <b>across</b> <b>town</b> <b>to</b> the Boulevard du Temple, a wide street with vestiges of the old city walls on one side, and houses on the other. In 1753, the city authorized the construction of cafés and theaters, at first made of canvas and wood, along the boulevard; and the boulevard quickly became the center of popular theater of Paris, a position it held until the Second Empire.|$|E

2500|$|In 1919, Rickey {{purchased}} an eighteen {{percent stake}} in the Texas League club Houston Buffaloes, then acquired interests in players in two minor leagues {{and a number of other}} teams. [...] From these connections, Rickey blueprinted and revolutionized a farm system –– an assembly line of young talent in the minor leagues which allowed the Cardinals to develop without risk of interference or losing them to other major league clubs. [...] His approach to [...] "farming prospects" [...] supplanted the practice of bidding to acquire top minor league players from independent teams and allowed control of minor leaguers and their development at little cost. [...] To fund the further establishment of the Cardinals farm system, Rickey sold the Cardinals' ballpark, Robison Field –– which had become riddled with defects over the years –– and moved the club <b>across</b> <b>town</b> <b>to</b> Sportsman's Park to become tenants of their American League rivals, the Browns. [...] The Cardinals farm system proved so successful that it led to the franchise's second golden era that persisted throughout Breadon's tenure, including nine World Series appearances between 1926 and 1946. [...] All other 15 major league clubs followed suit, and it is a practice still employed by all Major League teams today and other major professional sports. [...] For this, Rickey is credited with expanding many of the operational and player development techniques that overlap what is common to today's general manager.|$|E
