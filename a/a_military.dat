40|$|<b>A</b> {{model of}} <b>military</b> {{conscription}} with costly deferments is developed.

Among the results are: 1) conscription is socially preferable to <b>a</b> volunteer <b>military</b> only if <b>a</b> large percentage of eligible individuals is demanded by the military; 2) if conscription is used when it is socially cheaper than <b>a</b> volunteer <b>military,</b> welfare is improved if deferments have lower social benefits; and 3) ignoring other costs of conscription (e. g., higher turnover and reduced investment in human capital), the U.
