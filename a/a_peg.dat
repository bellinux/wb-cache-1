Playing {{in a minor}} match at Parkes (in rural NSW) on a matting wicket, he had his nose broken by a {{delivery}} that bounced erratically — it hit <b>a</b> <b>peg</b> accidentally left under the mat when it was laid out. On 6 November 1931, during NSW’s first match of the season at Brisbane, he was struck a severe blow to the temple by a rising ball from fast bowler Pud Thurlow. Taken to hospital, {{he retired from the}} match, but was selected for the first Test against South Africa, but scored only one run. He missed the second Test through injury, while his replacement Keith Rigg scored an impressive century on debut.|$|E
5|$|Aberrations in {{the shape}} of {{operculum}} have been observed. In a specimen from Vouvant in France, and another from a spring near Bar in Montenegro, a double rib was present, but the rib shield was reduced; in a specimen from Ohrid Lake, only the rib shield was reduced. Theodoxus fluviatilis can be distinguished from the other three mentioned species by having a rib pit, which is formed by the rib and the rib shield. The rib shield, and consequently a rib pit, are lacking in Theodoxus transversalis, Theodoxus danubialis and Theodoxus prevostianus. These three species differs in having, in addition to a rib, <b>a</b> <b>peg,</b> which is absent in T. fluviatilis. The visible soft parts of the animal are light yellow with a black head.

Using a three-way regime classification, the estimated effect of switching to <b>a</b> <b>pegged</b> (to <b>an</b> intermediate) regime is around two percentage points (around one percentage point) after 2 years.

5|$|The shell {{shape of}} Theodoxus fluviatilis {{is similar to}} that of Theodoxus transversalis. The shell shape of Theodoxus danubialis is more spherical. The shape of the {{aperture}} of Theodoxus prevostianus is usually descending. However, all of these species display a large morphological plasticity, which makes them difficult to differentiate. The overall outline of the shell is still used for species identification in recent malacological literature. Though the coloration and patterns of the shells cannot be relied upon to identify specimens, opercular characters can be used for a proper identification of Theodoxus fluviatilis. The calcified operculum of T. fluviatilis is D-shaped, light reddish with a red margin, bearing a broad rib (also called a ridge) on its inner surface. The columellar muscle is attached to the rib. The rib is long and thin, attenuated at the base, while the callus is thin; <b>a</b> <b>peg</b> is lacking. The characteristic features of the operculum are already visible in juveniles. There is sexual dimorphism on the border of the rib shield of the operculum, which is straight in females, but curved in males.|$|E

25|$|Prior to 1983, Australia {{maintained}} a fixed exchange rate. The first peg {{was between the}} Australian and British pounds, initially at par, and later at 0.8 GBP (16 shillings sterling).

40|$|This paper {{analyses}} {{the influence}} of the exchange rate regime of a country on the level of tolerated corruption with a special focus on the interdependency of monetary and fiscal policies. Using a simple theoretical framework based on Barro-Gordon-Model I compare independent monetary policy with <b>a</b> tight <b>peg</b> arrangement in order to find out which regime is more likely to induce governments to intensify the fight against corruption. It is shown that if corruption has a considerable positive impact on output, <b>a</b> tight <b>peg</b> regime can increase tolerated corruption. However, if corruption has a negative effect on output, <b>a</b> <b>pegged</b> exchange rate regime will lead to a lower level of tolerated corruption. The issue of particular interest appears to be the finding that a strong positive impact of corruption on output can induce governments to choose <b>a</b> <b>pegging</b> regime while <b>a</b> weak positive impact of corruption (and a negative influence of corruption even more) provides an incentive to keep monetary independence.

25|$|For most of {{its early}} history, the RMB was pegged to the U.S. dollar at ¥2.46 per USD (note: during the 1970s, it was revalued until it reached ¥1.50 per USD in 1980). When China's economy {{gradually}} opened in the 1980s, the RMB was devalued {{in order to improve}} the competitiveness of Chinese exports. Thus, the official exchange rate increased from ¥1.50 in 1980 to ¥8.62 by 1994 (the lowest rate on record). Improving current account balance during {{the latter half of the}} 1990s enabled the Chinese government to maintain <b>a</b> <b>peg</b> of ¥8.27 per USD from 1997 to 2005.|$|E
25|$|After the Allied {{invasion}} of Italy, an exchange rate {{was set at}} US$1 = 120 lire (1 British pound = 480 lire) in June 1943, reduced to 100 lire the following month.

5000|$|<b>A</b> {{crawling}} <b>peg</b> {{attempts to}} combine flexibility and stability using a rule-based system for gradually altering the currency's par value, [...] typically at a predetermined rate or {{as a function}} of inflation differentials. <b>A</b> crawling <b>peg</b> is similar to <b>a</b> fixed <b>peg,</b> however it can be adjusted based on clearly defined rules.

[...] At the margin <b>a</b> crawling <b>peg</b> provides <b>a</b> target for speculative attacks. Among variants of fixed exchange rates, it imposes the least restrictions, and may hence yield the smallest credibility benefits.

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{a desirable}} transition path for East Asian countries given the People's Republic of China's (PRC's) {{transition to a}} new exchange rate regime. It attempts to answer two main questions: (i) Would these countries be better off shifting to either <b>a</b> basket <b>peg</b> or <b>a</b> floating regime following the PRC's transition to <b>a</b> basket <b>peg</b> regime? (ii) How and when should these countries shift to the desired regime? The paper captures {{the influence of the}} PRC's predetermined shift in its exchange rate regime on East Asian countries' decisions regarding their optimal transition policies based on a dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) model of a small open economy. Our calibration exercise using Malaysian and Singapore data from the first quarter (Q 1) of 2000 to Q 4 2012 reveals that a gradual adjustment to <b>a</b> basket <b>peg</b> is the most desirable policy for both countries. A sudden shift to <b>a</b> basket <b>peg</b> is superior to maintaining <b>a</b> dollar <b>peg</b> in Malaysia, but not in Singapore. Finally, a sudden shift to a floating regime is even worse than maintaining <b>a</b> dollar <b>peg</b> in both countries...|$|R

25|$|Reflecting re-orientation {{of trade}} flows in the 1950s and 1960s, Britain had {{decided in the}} late 1960s to re-orientate its trade and {{economic}} policy from the Commonwealth of Nations to the European Economic Community, and the 1960s and early 1970s saw a corresponding further reduction in the economic relationship between Britain and the major realms, including Australia. In 1967, the pound sterling was devalued, but Australia did not follow suit, instead moving to <b>a</b> <b>peg</b> between the Australian dollar and the pound sterling at a different rate. In 1971, Australia switched its peg altogether, to the United States dollar, and in June 1972 Britain responded to this and other changes resulting from Britain's shrinking economic presence {{in the world by}} shrinking the sterling area, effectively ending the former monetary union.|$|E
25|$|Probably {{the oldest}} and most basic method of holding the work is a planing stop or dog ear, which is simply <b>a</b> <b>peg</b> or small piece of wood or metal that stands just above the surface {{at the end of the}} bench top. The work is placed on the bench with the end pushed against the stop. The force of the planing keeps the board in place, so long as the force is always toward the stop. Planing against a stop gives the woodworker good {{feedback}} - he can tell a lot about what is going on just by the pressure, force and balance required. A stop can take the form of a batten attached to the end of the bench, or it can be adjustable, able to be moved up and down according to the size of the work - or pushed down below the surface when not needed. A simple bench dog can serve as a planing stop.|$|E
