5|$|Approximately 8 {{minutes after}} the DC-7 had {{departed}} Los Angeles, a U.S. Air Force F-100F-5-NA Super Sabre jet fighter, serial number 56-3755, took off from Nellis Air Force Base near Las Vegas at 7:45a.m. on a training flight with two pilots on board. In {{the front seat of}} the tandem cockpit was flight instructor and safety pilot Capt. Thomas N. Coryell, 29, and behind him sat his student, 1st Lt. Gerald D. Moran, 24, who as part of his training would spend the flight under <b>a</b> <b>hood</b> that blocked his view outside the aircraft, but allowed him to see his instrument panel.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{rallying}} {{successes of}} the Simca 1000 and the Talbot Sunbeam, PSA launched the Samba Rallye. Fitted with the 1219cc XW version of the X engine, delivering 66kilowatt (90PS), it came in either white or red, with <b>a</b> <b>hood</b> scoop and side stripes. In 1985, a version with the 1360cc unit producing 59kilowatt (80PS) was launched, without the stripes. A special rallye-only Group B model, officially called the Peugeot Talbot Sport Samba Rallye preceded the later Peugeot 205 T16, with a 1285cc, 96kilowatt engine (130PS).|$|E
5|$|In 1894, the {{lighthouse}} was further altered {{to increase the}} amount of light emitted. The four-wick burner and mirrors were exchanged for a Douglass burner with eight wicks and an improved lantern; the power of the light was increased to 35,000 candela. The characteristic of the light changed from fixed to occulting. A foghorn was also installed, with two quick blasts every five minutes. The eight-wick burner was exchanged for a three incandescent mantle burner in 1905. In 1923, the burner was replaced by <b>a</b> <b>Hood</b> petroleum vapour burner with one mantle.|$|E
5000|$|A filter may be {{incompatible}} {{with the use of}} <b>a</b> lens <b>hood,</b> since not all filters have the required threading for <b>a</b> screw-in <b>hood</b> or will allow <b>a</b> clip-on <b>hood</b> to be attached. Adding <b>a</b> lens <b>hood</b> on top of one or more filters may space the hood away from the lens enough to cause some vignetting.|$|R

5|$|Leaders' ideological {{power was}} based on {{apparent}} access to deities and the supernatural. Evidence regarding Norte Chico religion is limited: {{an image of the}} Staff God, a leering figure with <b>a</b> <b>hood</b> and fangs, has been found on a gourd dated to 2250 BC. The Staff God is a major deity of later Andean cultures, and Winifred Creamer suggests the find points to worship of common symbols of gods. As with much other research at Norte Chico, the nature and significance of the find has been disputed by other researchers.|$|E
5|$|Microbes {{feature in}} many highly dramatized films. Hollywood {{was quick to}} exploit the {{possibilities}} of deadly disease, mass infection and drastic government reaction, starting as early as 1922 with Nosferatu, in which a Dracula-like figure, Count Orlok, sleeps in unhallowed ground contaminated with the Black Death, which he brings with him wherever he goes. Another classic film, Ingmar Bergman's 1957 The Seventh Seal, deals with the plague theme very differently, with the grim reaper directly represented by an actor in <b>a</b> <b>hood.</b> More recently, the 1971 The Andromeda Strain, based on a novel by Michael Crichton, portrayed an extraterrestrial microbe contaminating the Earth.|$|E
5|$|The {{black mamba}} is graceful but skittish and often unpredictable. It is agile and can move quickly, it is shy and secretive by nature and, like most snakes, it avoids threats. In the wild, a black mamba seldom tolerates humans {{approaching}} {{more closely than}} about 40 meters. When confronted {{it is likely to}} gape in a threat display, exposing its black mouth and flicking its tongue. It also is likely to form <b>a</b> <b>hood</b> by spreading its neck-flap as cobras do. The mamba's hood however, is narrower than that of a typical cobra. The threat display may be accompanied by audible hissing.|$|E

5|$|Central {{nervous system}} oxygen {{toxicity}} among patients undergoing {{hyperbaric oxygen therapy}} is rare, and is influenced {{by a number of}} a factors: individual sensitivity and treatment protocol; and probably therapy indication and equipment used. A study by Welslau in 1996 reported 16 incidents out of a population of 107,264 patients (0.015%), while Hampson and Atik in 2003 found a rate of 0.03%. Yildiz, Ay and Qyrdedi, in a summary of 36,500 patient treatments between 1996 and 2003, reported only 3 oxygen toxicity incidents, giving a rate of 0.008%. A later review of over 80,000 patient treatments revealed an even lower rate: 0.0024%. The reduction in incidence may be partly due to use of a mask (rather than <b>a</b> <b>hood)</b> to deliver oxygen.|$|E
5|$|Mr. McGregor {{does not}} notice the substitution, and carries the sack home, {{continually}} counting the six rabbits. His wife claims the skins for herself, intending to line her old cloak with them. But when she {{reaches into the}} sack and feels the vegetables and discovers them, she becomes very, very, angry. Then, as a result, she accuses her husband of playing a trick with her. And Mr. Mc Gregor becomes very angry too, and he throws a rotten vegetable marrow out through the window, hitting {{the youngest of the}} eavesdropping bunnies who has been sitting on the window-sill (leaving the Mc Gregors to argue). Their parents decide it is time to go home. At Christmas, they send the heroic little wood mouse a quantity of rabbit-wool. She makes herself a cloak and <b>a</b> <b>hood,</b> and a muff and mittens.|$|E
5|$|The east {{window in}} the chancel is {{in the shape of}} a pointed arch and dates from the 15th century; it has three lights topped with cinquefoils and <b>a</b> <b>hood</b> mould. On the north side of the nave there is a {{rectangular}} window from 1865. The 16th-century south transept has windows in the south and east walls: the south window has three lights topped with trefoils in a 16th-century arch, and the east window is small and rectangular, using some dressings from the 14th century. The wide opening between the transept and the rest of the church is spanned with a large wooden beam.|$|E

5|$|The third villain is Riccardo, who wields a flintlock pistol. For the {{majority}} of the game, Riccardo keeps his face hidden under <b>a</b> <b>hood.</b> Upon revealing himself however, Fiona is shocked to see her dead father's face. Riccardo reveals that he and her father, Ugo, are clones. He murdered Ugo in the car accident as revenge for leaving the castle and marrying Fiona's mother. He plans to use Fiona (by means of her womb and use of her Azoth) to bring about his own rebirth, so that he may live forever. As they fight atop a water tower, Hewie rescues Fiona by attacking Riccardo, causing him to fall from the summit.|$|E
5|$|Shortly before midnight, Taylor was {{led into}} the {{execution}} chamber and strapped to a chair 17 {{feet away from the}} shooters with <b>a</b> <b>hood</b> covering his head. Multiple bright lights covered Taylor. Sandbags were arranged behind him to prevent any ricochets. The captain walked down the aisle, tapping each shooter on the shoulder to check to see if they were ready. At 12:03 a.m. Mountain Standard Time on January 26, 1996, every shooter fired at the count of five and the white cloth target on Taylor's chest flew off. His chest moved upward and his left hand tightened into a fist. His grip gradually loosened and his head fell back. A doctor checked Taylor's neck for a pulse and cut two holes in his hood to check for a pupillary light reflex. Taylor was declared dead at 12:07 a.m. and became the 49th person to be executed in the state of Utah since 1852.|$|E
5|$|The {{trial at}} the upper {{regional}} court in Dresden began on 26 October 2009. It took place under strict security precautions due to alleged death threats to Wiens. All concurrent trials were transferred to other local venues, due to the security concerns, the great interest by the national and international media, and the public. El-Sherbini's widower, brother and parents acted {{in the role of}} 'co-claimant' and were represented by eight lawyers. On {{the first day of the}} trial, the entire prosecution counsel constituted of eight lawyers from Germany, France and Egypt was present in court; the defendant arrived in court shrouded behind a mask, sunglasses, hat and <b>a</b> <b>hood.</b> The judge asked the defendant to remove his head attire and to confirm his name and date of birth. The defendant complied, except for removing his sunglasses, for which he was fined for contempt of court. The defence counsel motioned for the judges to be removed from the trial on the grounds of bias as they were colleagues of witnesses and worked near the crime scene. This was denied by a separate panel that had ruled on this motion.|$|E
