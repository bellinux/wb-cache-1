The result was the arduous Salamaua Campaign, which was fought between June and September, and which at times looked like succeeding <b>all</b> <b>too</b> <b>well,</b> capturing Salamaua and forcing the Japanese back to Lae, thereby throwing Blamey's whole strategy into disarray.|$|E
5|$|The {{power balance}} {{began to change}} after King Rajendra came of age and his grandmother, Tripurasundari, died on 26 March 1832 due to cholera. Bhimsen lost his main support and the court became a stage for a power struggle, which even though started off {{as an attempt to}} assert the King's {{authority}} from the Mukhtiyar, spread to various aristocratic clans and their attempt to secure total authority. It was no secret that Bhimsen was able to maintain his supremacy due to the large standing army under his and his family's command; and in the subsequent years, different factions would attempt to increase their influence based on the strength of the number of battalions under their grip. After Tripurasundari's death, the royal seal by which government orders were approved naturally went {{into the hands of the}} senior queen Samrajya Laxmi, who knew <b>all</b> <b>too</b> <b>well</b> of its powers and wanted to emulate the queens of the past by establishing her own regency. Sensing Samrajya Laxmi's ambition, Ranbir Singh started to stroke her dislike of Bhimsen in the hopes of becoming the mukhtiyar himself. Getting a whiff of this matter, Bhimsen strongly reprimanded Ranbir Singh which caused him to resign from his General's position and live in retirement in his house at Sipamandan. However, Bhimsen later managed to placate his brother, by giving him the title of Chota (Little) General, and send him to Palpa as its governor. Since he could find nobody that he could trust to keep watch over the royal palace, Bhimsen from then on started to live in an ordinary rented house located near the palace premise.|$|E

5|$|This sparks the rumour mill yet again, as {{students}} {{around the school}} suspect Harry of being the Heir of Slytherin (as Slytherin was also a parselmouth), and circumstantial evidence to support this theory arrives {{in the form of}} another attack, this time on Hufflepuff second-year Justin Finch Fletchley and the Gryffindor ghost. Harry, Ron, and Hermione begin to suspect that Draco is behind the attacks, given his family history of remaining well within Slytherin ranks and open hostility toward Muggle-born students, and so Hermione concocts Polyjuice potion, which allows them to become Draco’s boorish lackeys, Vincent Crabbe and Gregory Goyle, for an hour to interrogate him. This comes to nothing, as Draco’s father only told his son the general facts of the previous opening of the Chamber and that it occurred fifty years previously. Meanwhile, Myrtle Warren, an existentially mopey ghost that haunts a bathroom, unwittingly provides a new clue {{in the form of a}} diary deposited in her stall—a diary, moreover, that belonged to Tom Riddle, a student who knows <b>all</b> <b>too</b> <b>well</b> about the Chamber, having been witness to a fellow student’s death fifty years ago. The culprit, he reveals to Harry, was none other than Rubeus Hagrid, now gamekeeper for Hogwarts School; when Hermione is attacked next, alongside a Ravenclaw prefect, the school is put on lockdown, and Dumbledore and Hagrid are forced to leave the premises.|$|E

25|$|The {{common clay}} {{minerals}} are montmorillonite or smectite, illite, and kaolinite or kaolin. These minerals tend {{to form in}} sheet or plate like structures, with length typically ranging between 10−7m and 4x10−6m and thickness typically ranging between 10−9m and 2x10−6m, {{and they have a}} relatively large specific surface area. The specific surface area (SSA) is defined as the ratio of the surface area of particles to the mass of the particles. Clay minerals typically have specific surface areas in the range of 10 to 1,000 square meters per gram of solid. Due to the large surface area available for chemical, electrostatic, and van der Waals interaction, the mechanical behavior of clay minerals is very sensitive to the amount of pore fluid available and the type and amount of dissolved ions in the pore fluid. To anticipate the effect of clay on the way a soil will behave, it is necessary to know the kinds of clays as well as the amount present. As home builders and highway engineers know <b>all</b> <b>too</b> <b>well,</b> soils containing certain high-activity clays make very unstable material on which to build because they swell when wet and shrink when dry. This shrink-and-swell action can easily crack foundations and cause retaining walls to collapse. These clays also become extremely sticky and difficult to work with when they are wet. In contrast, low-activity clays, formed under different conditions, can be very stable and easy to work with.|$|E

500|$|This {{incident}} {{confirms the}} Centre's suspicions that the paratroopers were agents {{of a foreign}} power, but Tintin fears that efforts to trace any leaked information would be futile. The rocket is successfully launched and orbits the moon as planned, but on its return it is then intercepted by the aforementioned foreign power, who have used the leaked information concerning the rocket's radio control. However, Tintin had anticipated this and asked Calculus to rig a self-destruct mechanism for the rocket, and the Centre destroys the rocket {{to prevent it from}} falling into enemy hands. Tintin reasons that there must have been an inside spy who leaked information to the paratroopers, but no suspects are found. Preparations are made for the manned expedition to the moon, but after an argument with Haddock, in which Haddock accuses Calculus of [...] "acting the goat", Calculus becomes irate. Usually misunderstanding everything Haddock says, due to being hard of hearing, Calculus was wearing a hearing aid this time, and understood Haddock <b>all</b> <b>too</b> <b>well.</b> Implacable, Calculus angrily gives Haddock a forced tour of the moon rocket.

On paper, this story is tailor-made for Mr. Spielberg's talents... t becomes less crisp on screen than {{it was on the}} page, with much of the enjoyable jargon either mumbled confusingly or otherwise thrown away." [...] In Rolling Stone, Peter Travers described the film as [...] "colossal entertainment—the eye-popping, mind-bending, kick-out-the-jams thrill ride of summer and probably the year [...] Compared with the dinos, the characters are dry bones, indeed. Crichton and co-screenwriter David Koepp have flattened them into nonentities on the trip from page to screen." [...] Roger Ebert noted, [...] "The movie delivers <b>all</b> <b>too</b> <b>well</b> on its promise to show us dinosaurs. We see them early and often, and they are indeed a triumph of special effects artistry, but the movie is lacking other qualities that it needs even more, such as a sense of awe and wonderment, and strong human story values." [...] Henry Sheehan argued, [...] "The complaints over Jurassic Parks lack of story and character sound a little off the point," [...] pointing out the story arc of Grant learning to protect Hammond's grandchildren despite his initial dislike of them.
