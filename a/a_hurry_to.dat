5|$|Given Huskisson's importance, and the {{potential}} impact {{on the future of}} Liverpool and Manchester's industries and on the embryonic railway industry of any findings of liability {{on the part of the}} railway, a swift determination of the causes of the accident was considered essential. By 9.00am on the morning after the accident, a hastily convened coroner's jury was assembled in the Grapes public house in Eccles. The coroner himself, MrMilne, arrived at 10.00am and was in <b>a</b> <b>hurry</b> <b>to</b> proceed as he had another inquest scheduled that afternoon, but proceedings were unable to begin as Lord Wilton, the only sworn witness scheduled to attend the inquest, could not be found. In the meantime, Milne sent the jury to the vicarage to view Huskisson's body.|$|E
5|$|The three Nasser brothers, William, Elias and George, {{specifically}} requested Pflueger in 1920 {{after they}} received financing {{for a grand}} movie palace on Castro Street. In <b>a</b> <b>hurry</b> <b>to</b> see the 2,000-seat project completed, the Nasser Brothers gave Pflueger a free hand in its design. The Castro Theatre was finished in June 1922 for $300,000 ($ in today's dollars) in a largely Spanish Baroque style which evoked cathedrals in Spain and Mexico. Churrigueresque elements were used sparingly on the facade, and ornate tile detailing was employed in the vestibule, ticket booth and the lobby. A canopy modeled after ancient Roman silk brocade shelters was fashioned of steel lath and plaster and painted with Asian and Buddha figures to overhang the main theater seating area. The whole was an eclectic assemblage of styles.|$|E

When this scandal becomes public, Erica is out of state, and in order to delay Erica from returning quickly and make a counter-statement to the scandal, David has someone sabotage the plane – expecting the pilot to run routine inspection before take-off. Erica, in <b>a</b> <b>hurry</b> <b>to</b> get back to Pine Valley, insists the pilot take off without the pre-flight inspection or filing a flight plan.|$|E

25|$|He bowls {{fast and}} {{obviously}} scorns to conserve his strength. He is in <b>a</b> <b>hurry</b> <b>to</b> {{be at the}} batsman. He turns sharply to begin his run, jumps off at a great pace, throws up his arm high, and then makes a terrifying leap into the air—a leap which one feels should {{be accompanied by a}} yell. At the end of his over he snaps up the ball, if it is anywhere within reach, and passes it hurriedly to the colleague who is having at them at the other end. With it all, his length was under control, and for a time the batsmen could make nothing of him.|$|E
25|$|The {{spring of}} 1870 saw Fort Edmonton {{come under the}} threat of {{violence}} due to a war between the Blackfoot and Cree, resulting from the slaying of Cree Chief Maskipiton. The Blackfoot were unable to ford the North Saskatchewan due to the high spring waters, but they encamped across from Fort Edmonton and harassed it with their muskets nonetheless. Some wagons full of goods had to be abandoned by traders in <b>a</b> <b>hurry</b> <b>to</b> reach safety inside of the fort, and their contents were spoiled by the Blackfoot. Though the fort itself was not invaded, the men within were armed and ready to fight. Chief Factor William J. Christie chose to withstand the Blackfoot and not attack them, fearing that to do so would only invite further violence against the Hudson's Bay Company.|$|E
25|$|The Republicans were in <b>a</b> <b>hurry</b> <b>to</b> {{force the}} city to {{surrender}} as the rainy weather of autumn would prevent any further military action to be taken. Upon his arrival Díaz proclaimed that his intents were to arrest General Márquez, Tomás O'Horán and the former Minister of State. He also stated that he would execute all the Austrian auxiliaries if they were captured. The lives of the Francofon soldiers would be spared since 60% of his own cavalry consisted of French deserters. On 20 April Agnes Salm-Salm, a Prussian princess in Imperial service, appeared at the camp of Díaz and offered the disbandment of the European troops {{in exchange for the}} guarantee of their and Maximilian's lives and free passage back to Europe. Although her offer was not accepted she tried to further convince Díaz by sending word that the Austro-Hungarian troops were put on hold and under the temporary protection of the neutral Prussian flag as of 26th inst.|$|E

25|$|Deepak {{was born}} on 1 April 1984, {{in the city of}} Belgaum, Karnataka. During his early years, he was {{interested}} in playing table tennis, football and cricket. He even won several table tennis tournaments and played at the Karnataka State Level TT Championship. He initially started playing cricket as a bowler. He decided to shift to batting because of a chance knock that he played for his team at Belgaum. He was in <b>a</b> <b>hurry</b> <b>to</b> catch a bus to participate in a table tennis tournament in Bangalore but his side was about to start batting. Seeing his urgency, the coach Mr. Feroz Shaikh asked him to open the innings. Deepak went on to score a big knock and helped his side to win the game. This convinced Deepak that he had more potential to play as a batsman than as a bowler and he also decided to shun table tennis in favour of cricket.|$|E
25|$|Al-Tabari {{reports that}} al-Mahdi {{was just about}} to promote Harun as heir {{apparent}} ahead of Musa when he died, and adds by way of corroboration another report that al-Mahdi set off for Masabadhan in a great hurry. However, it may be doubted that al-Mahdi at the time shared the reporter's subsequent knowledge of his imminent demise there, and none of the other reported circumstances of his death suggest that he was in <b>a</b> <b>hurry</b> <b>to</b> go anywhere. On the contrary, the sources in general make it clear that he had gone to Masabadhan for recreation, and they occasionally say so explicitly. Al-Tabari does say explicitly that envoys were sent to the provinces, where they obtained the oath of allegiance not only to al-Hadi as caliph but also to Harun as heir apparent (wali l-'ahd) (38). This was probably the first occasion on which Harun was so acknowledged. Harun himself, with the advice of al-Rabi', sent out these envoys, and all of this must have been presented to his brother on his return as a fait accompli.|$|E

After hearing about Belknap's predicament, Grant arranged {{a meeting with}} Representative Bass about the investigation. However, Belknap, escorted by Interior Secretary Zachariah Chandler, rushed to the White House and met with Grant before his meeting with Representative Bass. Belknap appeared visibly upset or ill, mumbling something about protecting his wives' honor and beseeching Grant to accept his resignation [...] "at once." [...] Grant, in <b>a</b> <b>hurry</b> <b>to</b> get to a photography studio for a formal portrait, regretfully agreed and accepted Belknap's resignation without reservation.|$|E

500|$|In March 1743 Balchen {{received}} {{the command of}} the Greenwich Naval Hospital and £600 per annum as a pension. Balchen chafed at being forced to remain ashore and was not pleased when he was forcibly retired in April 1744, aged 74. [...] Two months later, however, Balchen was recalled up to the Admiralty. A fleet of 25 British and Dutch ships had been raised in <b>a</b> <b>hurry</b> <b>to</b> rescue a British squadron and convoy under Sir Charles Hardy, which had been trapped in the Tagus by a French Brest squadron. Due to a shortage of officers of sufficient experience and seniority to command a fleet of this kind, Balchen was called up at short notice and rewarded with a knighthood.|$|E
500|$|Ark Royals {{aircraft}} provided {{support to}} the Australian and New Zealand troops at Anzac Cove as they landed on 25 April on the Gallipoli Peninsula. Two days later, the ship was taken under fire by the Ottoman predreadnought , firing across the peninsula, {{and she had to}} move in <b>a</b> <b>hurry</b> <b>to</b> avoid being hit. A month later, the battle on the peninsula had bogged down and the success of the German submarine [...] in sinking two British predreadnoughts forced Ark Royal to move to a safer anchorage at Imbros at the end of May. There she became a depot ship for all the seaplanes in the area, while her own aircraft continued to support operations at Gallipoli. On occasion, aircraft were loaned out to other ships for reconnaissance or observation missions.|$|E
500|$|University {{lecturer}} Zaini Ujang viewed Yesterday and Todays comparisons as {{criticisms of}} society, putting forth {{the question of}} whether people should accept [...] "development" [...] to simply mean discarding the old for the new without regards to its value. [...] Professor Fuziah of the National University of Malaysia interpreted the book's ending as a wakeup call to parents, questioning them if they should deny their children a more relaxed childhood. [...] Lent agreed, saying that Lat had asserted the theme from the start, showing him and his childhood friends [...] "not in <b>a</b> <b>hurry</b> <b>to</b> grow up". [...] Redza hinted that Lat's other goal was to point out the [...] "dehumanising environment" [...] that Malaysian urban children are growing up in.

500|$|In September 1949 Formby {{went on a}} 19 city coast-to-coast Canadian tour, {{from which}} he {{returned}} unwell. While subsequently appearing in Cinderella in Leeds, he collapsed in his dressing room. The attending doctor administered morphine, to which Formby briefly became addicted. Further poor health plagued him into 1950, with a bout of dysentery, followed by appendicitis, after which he recuperated in Norfolk, before giving another royal command performance that April. He undertook two further international tours that year: one to Scandinavia, and a second to Canada. His earnings of Ca$200,000 were heavily taxed: Canadian taxes took up $68,000, and UK taxes took 90% of the balance. Formby complained to reporters {{about the level of}} taxation, saying [...] "That's it. So long as the government keeps bleeding me dry, I shan't be in much of <b>a</b> <b>hurry</b> <b>to</b> work again!"; he and Beryl {{spent the rest of the}} year resting in Norfolk, in temporary retirement.|$|E
500|$|Although Scott is antipathetic towards Richardson's final novel, not {{everyone}} {{was of the}} same opinion; Jane Austen was a devotee of the novel, {{which was part of}} her mental furniture to the point where she could claim to describe [...] "all that was ever said or done in the cedar parlour". She would for example casually compare a flower in a new cap she got to the white feather described by Harriet Byron as being in hers. Nevertheless, throughout her life she also subjected Grandison to much affectionate, even satirical mockery - adapting it into a dramatic lampoon (not published until 1980) around 1800. Her juvenalia also included a heroine who guyed Harriet Byron's frequent fainting, through being “in such <b>a</b> <b>hurry</b> <b>to</b> have a succession of fainting fits, that she had scarcely patience enough to recover from one before she fell into another”. As late as 1813, she would respond to a long letter from her sister Cassandra by exclaiming “Dear me!...Like Harriet Byron I ask, what am I to do with my Gratitude”.|$|E
500|$|Broadwater noted, [...] "given the {{difficulty}} of the task he had set for himself, his stubborn independence, and his lack, by 1787, of any concern for his own political future, {{it is not surprising that}} he left Philadelphia at odds with the great majority of his fellow delegates". Madison recorded that Mason, believing that the convention had given his proposals short shrift in <b>a</b> <b>hurry</b> <b>to</b> complete its work, began his journey back to Virginia [...] "in an exceeding ill humor". Mason biographer Helen Hill Miller noted that before Mason returned to Gunston Hall, he was injured in body as well as spirit, due to an accident on the road. Word of Mason's opposition stance had reached Fairfax County even before the convention ended; most local sentiment was in favor of the document. Washington made a statement urging ratification, but otherwise remained silent, knowing he would almost certainly be the first president. Mason sent Washington a copy of his objections, but the general believed that the only choice was ratification or disaster.|$|E
