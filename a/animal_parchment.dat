The University of Notre Dame still uses <b>animal</b> <b>parchment</b> for its diplomas. Similarly, University of Glasgow and Heriot-Watt University use goat skin parchment for their degrees.|$|E
25|$|In {{the later}} Middle Ages, {{especially}} the 15th century, parchment was largely replaced by paper for most uses except luxury manuscripts, {{some of which}} were also on paper. New techniques in paper milling allowed it to be much cheaper than parchment; it was still made of textile rags and of very high quality. With the advent of printing in the later fifteenth century, the demands of printers far exceeded the supply of <b>animal</b> skins for <b>parchment.</b>|$|R
40|$|This chapter follows up {{on several}} {{preliminary}} tests that {{have shown that}} DNA survives in medieval parchment manuscript leaves and may be extracted and analyzed, and offers suggestions for defining and implementing future genetic studies of parchment. It articulates the need to consider genetic data {{in conjunction with other}} types of evidence—such as historical texts and archaeological data—both in planning tests of parchment and in interpreting the results of such tests. I consider the potential influences of diet, urbanization, market and trade specialization, and changes in agricultural practices and <b>animal</b> husbandry on <b>parchment</b> production, and discuss how genetic analysis can contribute to our knowledge of these topics as well as how historical and archaeological evidence will both complicate and contextualize data derived from genetic testing...|$|R

The source of this parchment, often called "uterine vellum," has been a long-standing controversy in codicology. Use of the Latin term abortivum in many sources has led some scholars to suggest that the skin of fetal calves or sheep was used. Others have argued {{that it would not be}} possible to sustain herds if so many pocket Bibles were produced from fetal skins, arguing instead for unexpected alternatives, such as rabbit. Here, we report a simple and objective technique using standard conservation treatments to identify the <b>animal</b> origin of <b>parchment.</b> The noninvasive method is a variant on zooarchaeology by mass spectrometry (ZooMS) peptide mass fingerprinting but extracts protein from the parchment surface by using an electrostatic charge generated by gentle rubbing of a PVC eraser on the membrane surface. Using this method, we analyzed 72 pocket Bibles originating in France, England, and Italy and 293 additional parchment samples that bracket this period. We found no evidence for the use of unexpected animals; however, we did identify the use of more than one mammal species in a single manuscript, consistent with the local availability of hides. These results suggest that ultrafine vellum does not necessarily derive from the use of abortive or newborn animals with ultrathin hides, but could equally well reflect a production process that allowed the skins of maturing animals of several species to be rendered into vellum of equal quality and fineness...|$|R
