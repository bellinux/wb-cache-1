25|$|Blackfish {{wanted to}} {{continue}} to Boonesborough and capture it since it was now poorly defended, but Boone convinced him that {{the women and children}} were not hardy enough to survive a winter trek as prisoners. Instead, Boone promised that Boonesborough would surrender willingly to the Shawnees the following spring. Boone was improvising, saying <b>anything</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> the Shawnees from attacking Boonesborough. He did not have an opportunity to tell his men what he was doing, however, and many of them concluded that he had switched his loyalty to the British.|$|E

Although she is a loving woman, she is {{extremely}} smart and honest and can tell who is a good person and who is a bad person. She is powerful and strong in her ways and would do <b>anything</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> the Tong family running smoothly with smiles on their faces. She foresees Kam's plotting antics and thus she kicks her out. During her declining health and final days of life, she spent them with her family in a happy manner. Even on her death bed, she was very straightforward in her act of not letting Kam back into her family.|$|E
25|$|Dysdera {{are unable}} to produce webs for shelter causing them {{to be limited to}} the ground and natural shelters. Dysdera inhabit hot humid forest, or {{potentially}} any shelter on and close to the ground. They search for objects to hide under not only because they are ground dwellers but due to the moist earth's footing and keeping the spider warm. Dysdera shelter under objects like gravel with organic material covering it, stones, bark, also sometimes found in suburban gardens, <b>anything</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> them protected from predators during the day. Dysdera unguimannis is considered the most remarkable case of troglomorphism (adaptation to cave life) in the Dysdera genus. They shelter under or in anything they can find but, only during the day due to strictly hunting prey at night.|$|E

500|$|... "Fight for You" [...] is an urban-pop ballad with {{a length}} of four minutes and two seconds. According to Meena Rupani of DesiHits, the song finds Derulo as the male protagonist singing [...] "that he's got a girl in his life he isn't ready {{to let go of}} just yet". The song {{contains}} a sample of the song [...] "Africa" [...] (1982) by American rock band Toto. Lewis Corner of Digital Spy noted that [...] "Fight for You" [...] features [...] "airy synths and bouncy castle-sized beats". During an interview with New! magazine, Derulo explained the concept of [...] "Fight for You", saying: [...] "It's very relationship-based and the line [...] means so much, whatever you believe in you should go for. The song is based on a personal experience, I was in a relationship and I put myself in that place again where you would do <b>anything</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> the relationship together so I went back to that place." ...|$|E

Tom Fontana said of the changes to the series, [...] "We were experimenting with our first nine episodes. Whenever you try something new, you tend to err on the side of breaking ground. But we'd rather have more people watching, so the colors and lighting are slightly brighter, and the camera movements are not as jarring." ...|$|E
500|$|Nielsen {{ratings for}} Homicide: Life on the Street had {{gradually}} declined throughout the , leaving {{the show at}} high risk of cancellation by the time the season concluded. NBC executives asked for several refinements [...] including fewer episode subplots and less camera movements and jump cuts [...] before approving a second season. Executive producer Tom Fontana said he was willing [...] "to do <b>anything</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> NBC from forgetting us", although executive producer Barry Levinson said the show would maintain its realistic visual style, claiming, [...] "We want a camera that's almost a participant in the show."

500|$|According to Joseph, [...] "Freakum Dress" [...] is thematically {{similar to}} [...] "Bills, Bills, Bills" [...] (1999) and [...] "Say My Name" [...] (2000), from the Destiny's Child era. Ann Powers of Los Angeles Times noted that [...] "Freakum Dress" [...] celebrates showing off. Jon Pareles of The New York Times viewed {{the concept of}} the song as not merely having a nice {{wardrobe}} to entice men, but it also serves as [...] "a means of self-assertion." [...] In the song, the female protagonist pulls out her best dress to remind her potentially wandering mate of what he is leaving at home. Jody Rosen of Entertainment Weekly added that Beyoncé also seemingly gives professional advice to women on how to hold a man's attention in a long-term relationship. She sings: [...] "I think I'm ready/ Been locked up in the house way too long / It's time to get it, cause once again he's out doing wrong [...] Wear very skimpy clothes...". Joseph commented that in the song, Beyoncé is capable of wearing <b>anything</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> her man by her side rather than dumping him. Sarah Rodman of The Boston Globe added that after having skirted her best dress, Beyoncé eyes other guys in dance clubs to make her own man jealous, in the hope of regaining his attention but she also makes sure that he really pays when he does her wrong. Beyoncé later refers to her [...] "freakum dress" [...] in [...] "Jealous", a track from her fifth studio album Beyoncé (2013).|$|E

2500|$|There was {{speculation}} that Gable's physically demanding role in The Misfits {{contributed to his}} sudden death soon after filming was completed. In an interview with Louella Parsons, published soon after Gable's death, Kay Gable said, [...] "It wasn't the physical exertion that killed him. It was the horrible tension, the eternal waiting, waiting, waiting. He waited around forever, for everybody. He'd get so angry that he'd {{just go ahead and}} do <b>anything</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> occupied."

2500|$|Other {{residents}} {{complained that}} the new mosque would have a harmful effect on traffic and housing values, noting that it was located in a primarily residential area. Commission officials rejected the criticism, stating that the plans met zoning requirements and that the law did {{not allow them to}} reject a project on religious grounds. The tenor of the opposition attracted criticism, with some residents calling the dispute [...] "one of the ugliest displays of religious intolerance in the county's history."

[...] A misunderstanding of the jury instructions may have also {{played a role in the}} verdict. [...] The jury's understanding of the instructions was that they were required to find all of defendants guilty in order to convict and as they could not agree that all eight were involved they felt required to return a not guilty verdict.|$|E

[...] "We would love him to stay but, obviously, he has made his promise to his family and Helsingborg and I think we should respect that – but I would have done <b>anything</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> him."

Originally emphasizing Chen's inability to establish the Three Links with Mainland China, the Lien-Soong ticket changed its message, in light of the SARS outbreak in mid-2003, to focus more on what they see as Chen's inability to deal with the recession. Until October 2003, the Lien-Soong strategy appeared to be to avoid doing or saying <b>anything</b> controversial <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> its lead. This strategy was widely seen as counterproductive by the end of October when Pan-Green started to pull ahead.|$|R
