5|$|In January 1976, Ochs {{moved to}} Far Rockaway, New York, {{to live with}} his sister Sonny. He was lethargic; his only {{activities}} were watching television and playing cards with his nephews. Ochs saw a psychiatrist, who diagnosed his bipolar disorder. He was prescribed medication, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>told</b> his sister he was taking it. On April 9, 1976, Ochs committed suicide by hanging himself in Sonny's home.|$|E
5|$|Upon Irataba's {{return from}} Washington D.C., {{he met with}} the Mohave while dressed in his major general's uniform, with medals. He wore a European-style hat and carried a long Japanese sword, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>told</b> the Mohave about all the things he had seen. He tried to {{convince}} them that peace with the United States was in their best interests, and that war against them was futile, stressing their dominant military capabilities. Many Mohave were skeptical of his reports, and reacted with disbelief.|$|E
5|$|After her {{engagement}} to Day ended, Sabrina {{spent eight years}} at boarding houses around Birmingham. Day met {{and went on to}} marry an heiress, Esther Milnes, in 1778. Sabrina met an apothecary, Jarvis Wardley, who proposed marriage in an acrostic poem. She contacted Day for advice, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>told</b> her in absolute terms not to marry Wardley, even writing an acrostic poem for her to use in turning him down. In 1783, she had become a lady's companion in Newport, Shropshire. It was there that she was approached by Day's friend, the man who helped choose her at the foundling hospital, John Bicknell. Bicknell was single and had spent the majority of his earnings from his law career in gambling dens. He had not paid much attention to Sabrina since selecting her with Day, but proposed marriage immediately.|$|E

5|$|Throughout {{the evening}} on October 23, {{a series of}} phone calls between Green and Farrar {{escalated}} into a confrontation. Farrar was convinced that Green was continuing to drink heavily while {{she should have been}} caring for the children, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>told</b> Green that he knew she had poisoned him and that Social Services might be called to protect the children if she failed to get her life in order. After the last call between Green and Farrar, Farrar watched television alone in his apartment until about 12:30, when a neighbor's phone call alerted him to the fire.|$|E
5|$|Johnson's work on The Plays of William Shakespeare took {{up most of}} his time. On 8 June 1756, Johnson {{published}} his Proposals for Printing, by Subscription, the Dramatick Works of William Shakespeare, which argued that previous editions of Shakespeare were edited incorrectly {{and needed to be}} corrected. Johnson's progress on the work slowed as the months passed, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>told</b> music historian Charles Burney in December 1757 that it would take him until the following March to complete it. Before that could happen, he was arrested again, for a debt of £40, in February 1758. The debt was soon repaid by Jacob Tonson, who had contracted Johnson to publish Shakespeare, and this encouraged Johnson to finish his edition to repay the favour. Although it took him another seven years to finish, Johnson completed a few volumes of his Shakespeare to prove his commitment to the project.|$|E
5|$|The cricketer {{refused to}} think that his {{candidacy}} was simply there {{to make up the}} numbers, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>told</b> Bolte as much. The start of the election campaign coincided with the 1954–55 grade cricket finals. Loxton took 7 wickets and scored 129 runs to help Prahran claim the title {{for the first time in}} 32 years, and was hailed as a local hero. It capped off a season in which he topped the competition batting averages and took the most wickets. In a close-run contest, the cricketer defeated the sitting ALP member Bob Pettiona by only 14 votes on the two party preferred count. He was aided by preferences from the Democratic Labor Party (DLP), which had broken away from the ALP during the 1950s, claiming that it was too soft towards communism; fears of left-wing influence was causing great concern in Australian society at the time. Loxton polled 35.70% of the first preferences, well behind Pettiona's 47.25%, but received almost all of the DLP's 13.66% of the vote as preferences to end with 50.04%. The result helped bring Bolte's Liberals to power, and they stayed in office until 1982, by which time Loxton had retired.|$|E

25|$|Another {{important}} witness was Ari Ben-Menashe, {{who also}} provided affidavits for Inslaw that Brian had brought both public domain and enhanced versions of Promis to Israel, and eventually sold the enhanced version to the Israeli government. Committee investigators interviewed Ben-Menashe in May 1991, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>told</b> them that Brian sold enhanced Promis to both Israeli intelligence and Singapore's armed forces, receiving {{several million dollars}} in payment. He also testified that Brian sold public domain versions to Iraq and Jordan.|$|E

25|$|It took {{well over}} a year to {{complete}} the painting. The first version of the portrait of Madame Gautreau, with the famously plunging neckline, white-powdered skin, and arrogantly cocked head, featured an intentionally suggestive off-the-shoulder dress strap, on her right side only, which made the overall effect more daring and sensual. Sargent repainted the strap to its expected over-the-shoulder position to try to dampen the furor, but the damage had been done. French commissions dried up <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>told</b> his friend Edmund Gosse in 1885 that he contemplated giving up painting for music or business.|$|E
25|$|The View {{initially}} {{formed around}} a cover band at school, playing their own versions of bands such as Squeeze and the Sex Pistols. Lead singer Kyle Falconer, guitarist Peter Reilly, bassist Kieren Webster and original drummer Michael Annable all attended St John's RC High School, They began by performing {{a number of}} their own songs and cover versions at school talent contests. The deputy head teacher of St John's stated that he knew the band would go far <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>told</b> them {{to push for a}} record deal. The View entered the school talent contest four times but were only successful twice. Following this, the band set up base to write their own material in a back room of The Bayview Pub, a bar owned by Falconer's cousin. They progressed to play more cover gigs and weddings around the Dundee area, including the Centenary Bar in Central Dundee and a caravan park in Arbroath. The band were later ejected from their base in The Bayview, following singer Kyle Falconer reportedly riding a scooter along the bar.|$|E
25|$|Pang De's {{role in the}} Battle of Fancheng (mentioned {{in chapter}} 70) was largely exaggerated for {{dramatic}} effect. Prior to the battle, Pang De volunteered to lead the vanguard of a reinforcement army to relief Cao Ren's forces, who were besieged in Fan by Guan Yu's army. Cao Cao was delighted and he granted Pang De the post. However, when others advised Cao Cao against granting Pang De command of the vanguard due to Pang's past associations with Ma Chao (who {{had become one of}} the Five Tiger Generals under Liu Bei), Pang knelt down in front of Cao and kowtowed until his face was covered in blood. Cao Cao was moved by Pang De's sincerity and he no longer doubted Pang's allegiance towards him, so he appointed Pang as the vanguard. Pang De later ordered a wooden coffin to be built <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>told</b> his men to place Guan Yu's body inside if he succeeded in killing Guan, or place his body inside if he died in battle.|$|E

25|$|Plutarch {{clarified}} {{that those}} who were granted a triumph had to stay outside the city until the celebration, while candidates for the consulship had {{to be present in}} the city. The option of registering in absentia through a friend acting on his behalf was turned down and Caesar opted for the consulship. Like Appian, Plutarch wrote that Cato the Younger was the fiercest opponent of Caesar. He steered the other senators towards rejecting the proposal. In both The Life of Cato and The Life of Pompey he wrote that after the agrarian bill was defeated the hard pressed Pompey resorted to seeking the support of the plebeian tribunes and young adventurers, the worse of whom was Publius Clodius Pulcher (see below). In the former he added that Pompey then won the support of Caesar, who attached himself to him. In the latter he wrote that Caesar pursued a policy of conciliating Crassus and Pompey. Therefore, the two texts seem contradictory. In The Life of Caesar he wrote Caesar started his policy to reconcile Pompey and Crassus soon after entered the city. Caesar pursued this policy because they were the most influential men <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>told</b> them that by concentrating their united strength on him, they could succeed in changing the form of government.|$|E
25|$|In Salta {{he found}} an {{intelligence}} net who was passing information to Goyeneche's royalist army, headed by the city's bishop, whom he forced to leave the territories controlled by the Junta. Even though they suffered from malaria he decided to advance towards Cochabamba. The advanced elements consisting of the battalion of mulattoes and the two cavalry regiments of Hussars and Dragoons, reached Humahuaca, {{while the rest of}} the army positioned itself in Jujuy. He celebrated there the second anniversary of the May Revolution, and he had a new white and light blue flag blessed by the chaplain. The well-planned solemn ceremony helped gain the support of the locals who were distrustful and some supported the royalist army and the dislike of the troops to the Prussian regime imposed by Holmberg. Order was strict and Belgrano ordered capital punishment inflicted for whom disobeyed express orders. One of the deserters due to the strict discipline was Venancio Benavídez, who moved to Goyeneche's forces, which had already taken Cochabamba <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>told</b> of the harsh conditions at Belgrano's army. With that intelligence, Goyeneche, who had just reinforced Pío de Tristán, decided to advance towards the south and press the advantage. Belgrano ordered conscription of all able men, forming a troop of cavalry irregulars, but received the order to retreat towards Córdoba from the Junta in Buenos Aires.|$|E

Naomi and Paul's relationship eventually ended after she had a one-night stand with Josh. Paul asked if they could try and work out their differences, but Naomi declined <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>told</b> her she would not amount to anything.|$|E

500|$|Adamle was {{eligible}} {{to play for}} the Buckeyes again in 1947, but decided to leave school and join the Cleveland Browns of the All-America Football Conference (AAFC). Adamle had been selected with the 105th pick in the 1947 NFL Draft by the Chicago Bears, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>told</b> Cleveland head coach Paul Brown, who coached Ohio State's varsity team between 1941 and 1943, that he would join the Bears if the Browns did not sign him.

[...] Tap dancing's popularity was nearing a new peak as well, with three major American cities (Houston, Texas; Portland, Oregon; Washington, D.C.) hosting tap-dance festivals. In movie theaters, the dance drama Tap was introducing Sims's footwork (and that of his former student Gregory Hines) to audiences who had never had the opportunity to see him perform before.|$|E
