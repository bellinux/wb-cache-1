5|$|In 1986 Bond and Alec Trevelyan—agent 006—infiltrate an illicit Soviet {{chemical}} weapons facility and plant explosive charges. Trevelyan is shot, but Bond escapes {{from the facility}} as it explodes. Nine years later, Bond witnesses the theft by criminal organisation Janus of a prototype Eurocopter Tiger helicopter that can withstand an electromagnetic pulse. Janus uses the helicopter to steal the control disk for the dual GoldenEye satellite weapons, using the GoldenEye to destroy the complex with an electromagnetic pulse; there are two survivors of the attack, <b>a</b> <b>programmer,</b> Natalya Simonova, and Boris Grishenko.|$|E
5|$|According to Sorrell, {{the first}} design {{proposal}} for the game had the working title ‘Dead Man Dan’ and described a game that was initially a fusion of Capcom's Ghost'n Goblins combined with the art style of Tim Burton's The Nightmare Before Christmas. As development progressed, lead artist Wilson pushed the game into more of a Zelda role playing game-influenced direction {{as opposed to the}} original arcade-style concept. Looking to attract a major publishing deal, Millennium Interactive initially began working on multiple platforms including Windows and the Sega Saturn before giving Sony of Europe a working demo of the game. Impressed by the progress, Sony signed MediEvil to be an exclusive PlayStation game and commissioned SCE Cambridge Studio as Sony's second studio in the United Kingdom, after Psygnosis. During the production of the demo, there was <b>a</b> <b>programmer</b> for each platform. Millennium were having financial difficulties and wanted to secure a publisher quickly. Sega and Microsoft were also interested in the game.|$|E

5|$|Born in Sapporo, Japan, Iwata {{expressed}} interest in video games {{from an early age}} and created his first simple game while in high school. He later majored in computer science at the Tokyo Institute of Technology. In 1980, he joined the game developer HAL Laboratory while attending the university. During his early years at HAL Laboratory he worked as <b>a</b> <b>programmer</b> and closely collaborated with Nintendo, producing his first commercial game in 1983. Notable titles to which he contributed at HAL include EarthBound and the Kirby series. Following a downturn and near-bankruptcy, Iwata became the president of HAL Laboratory in 1993 at the insistence of Nintendo President Hiroshi Yamauchi and brought financial stability to the company. In the following years, he assisted {{in the development of the}} Pokémon and Super Smash Bros. series. Iwata joined Nintendo as the head of its corporate-planning division in 2000.|$|E
5|$|In {{the latter}} {{parts of the}} game's development, the largest {{challenge}} was to coordinate Guasti's and his collaborators' work; when Guasti started working as <b>a</b> <b>programmer,</b> he learned about project management, and applied it to AM2R, but still found it challenging to have deadlines and keep people motivated, as everyone {{was working on the}} game for free in their spare time. In late 2014, the project was ported to the newer version GameMaker: Studio, which enabled improved loading times and performance, but required the complete rewriting of some features and changes to the designs of some levels. This move also made bugs faster to fix and new builds easier to make, leaving the development progress in a more expedient and productive state. Later in the same year, the developers worked on improving the visuals, giving the fourth area a new graphics tile set intended to give it more personality.|$|E
5|$|The {{game that}} became Fez {{began in a}} {{collaboration}} between Montreal-based Phil Fish and Toronto-based Shawn McGrath on McGrath's idea for a puzzle game: a four-sided 3D space with each side in 2D, similar to Fish's 3D pixels (voxels) as incorporated into Fez. The entirety of Fez design, lore, and art descends from this game mechanic. Fish provided the project's art and credited his influence to Shigeru Miyamoto and Hayao Miyazaki. Fish and McGrath's partnership crumbled due to creative differences, as Fish {{wanted to create a}} platform game. Fish continued to work on the game in his spare time and announced his search for <b>a</b> <b>programmer</b> on DeviantArt, and the first person to reply, Renaud Bédard, became lead programmer. They were both the same age and living in Montreal. Though Bédard had some hobbyist experience in 3D graphics and was studying computer science, Fez was his first professional game development project. His first task was to write the level editor and game engine.|$|E

5|$|The {{game was}} {{conceived}} when Tetsuya Mizuguchi asked Masahiro Sakurai {{to make a}} falling block puzzle. Believing that the genre had not evolved since Tetris Attack (1995), Sakurai {{came up with the}} idea of having the blocks fall and shooting back up. The game's prototype was created in three days by a designer, <b>a</b> <b>programmer,</b> and a graphic artist. It was inspired by the TV series 24, the film The Matrix, and the Missile Command game. According to Mizuguchi, 24 camera work and the beginning of The Matrix (with dripping, green computer code) were the basis of the puzzle-game concept. In a Famitsu interview, Sakurai said that the opening CG video explaining its backstory was added to provide a sense of the game's world.|$|E
5|$|The {{game was}} their first to receive public appreciation. Boxleiter first {{understood}} its potential when publishers fought for the bid to the game. At the time, it was solely designed for Flash and not iOS, though {{they were interested in}} making bigger games outside the Flash market. They announced the game in mid August 2010, where they revealed that the game would release on Flash (through Kongregate) and iOS simultaneously, which happened on August 29, 2010. Joe Bergeron, <b>a</b> <b>programmer</b> who had previously worked on Dinowaurs with Mikengreg, helped with the iOS version of the game. Solipskier made around $70,000 in its first two months (as compared to $15,000 from the Flash release), which let them work in other non-Flash mediums in the future. They released an Android version three months later.|$|E
5|$|Wakeley, the game's designer, {{considered}} {{making a}} sequel as an action combat game, but thought the concepts behind Blast Corps had been fully exhausted. After praising {{the game in}} a 2010 Rare retrospective feature, Retro Gamer writers craved a sequel. The magazine said the title was proof of the company's inventiveness. Steve Ellis, who was <b>a</b> <b>programmer</b> at Rare, thought Blast Corps {{to be among the}} company's most underrated games, and though its physics were now dated, he continued to find the game fun enough to revisit regularly. Blast Corps is included in Rare Replay, a compilation of 30 Rare titles, released on the Xbox One on August 4, 2015. The release's bonus features included behind-the-scenes interviews with Blast Corps developers. Blast Corps was a standout favorite among Rare Replay reviewers.|$|E

5|$|Warren Davis, <b>a</b> <b>programmer</b> {{hired to}} work on the action game Protector, noticed Lee's ideas, and asked if he could use them to {{practice}} programming randomness and gravity as game mechanic. Thus, he added balls that bounced from the pyramid's top to bottom. Because Davis was still learning how to program game mechanics, he wanted to keep the design simple. He also felt games with complex control schemes were frustrating and wanted something that could be played with one hand. To accomplish this, Davis removed the shooting and changed the objective to saving the protagonist from danger. As Davis worked on the game one night, Gottlieb's vice president of engineering, Ron Waxman, noticed him and suggested to change the color of the cubes after the game's character has landed on them. Davis implemented a unique control scheme; a four-way joystick was rotated 45° to match the directions of Q*bert's jumping. Staff members at Gottlieb urged for a more conventional orientation, but Davis stuck to his decision. Davis remembered to have started programming in April 1982, but the project was only put on schedule as an actual product several months later.|$|E
5|$|The {{localization}} {{staff at}} Square Enix works mainly from Japanese to English, French, German, Spanish, Italian, {{as well as}} Russian, Korean and Mandarin {{for a number of}} titles. In 2016, Final Fantasy XV became the first major title from the company to release in Latin American Spanish and Brazilian Portuguese. Minor titles are occasionally localized from English to European languages. Prior to the merger of Square and Enix in 2003, Enix did not initially have a localization department and outsourced its Western releases to translators who had no close contact with the original development teams, as was the case for Dragon Quest VII. Square also did not initially have a localization department, though a number of localizers such as Kaoru Moriyama and Ted Woolsey worked with them regularly on a contractual basis in the early 1990s. Moriyama described the work at the time as leaving very little leeway for polishing text due to the limitations of the ROM sizes. She also commented Hironobu Sakaguchi was not willing to put extra work for the English version at that time. Following the massive international success of Final Fantasy VII, however, the company looked into improving the quality of its translated products-the game was widely criticized for its rushed English translation, which had been handled entirely by Michael Baskett, the company's only in-house translator at the time. To that end, Square tasked Richard Honeywood, originally <b>a</b> <b>programmer,</b> with creating a dedicated localization team in the Tokyo headquarters. His first major project was Xenogears. While there were only two members at first, including Honeywood, the staff grew to include more than 40 employees by 2007, and over 70 in 2015. The success of Final Fantasy VII also {{led to the creation of}} a London-based European office in 1998, which would handle marketing and quality assurance for the PAL market.|$|E
