5|$|<b>Acquired</b> <b>immunodeficiency</b> <b>syndrome</b> (AIDS) {{is defined}} in terms of either a CD4+ T cell count below 200 cells per µL or the {{occurrence}} of specific diseases in association with an HIV infection. In the absence of specific treatment, around half of people infected with HIV develop AIDS within ten years. The most common initial conditions that alert to the presence of AIDS are pneumocystis pneumonia (40%), cachexia in the form of HIV wasting syndrome (20%), and esophageal candidiasis. Other common signs include recurring respiratory tract infections.|$|E
5|$|The human {{immunodeficiency}} virus (HIV) is a lentivirus (a subgroup of retrovirus) that causes HIV infection and over time <b>acquired</b> <b>immunodeficiency</b> <b>syndrome</b> (AIDS). AIDS is a condition in humans in which progressive failure {{of the immune system}} allows life-threatening opportunistic infections and cancers to thrive. Without treatment, average survival time after infection with HIV is estimated to be 9 to 11years, depending on the HIV subtype. Infection with HIV occurs by the transfer of blood, pre-ejaculate, semen, vaginal fluids, or breast milk. Within these bodily fluids, HIV is present as both free virus particles and virus within infected immune cells.|$|E

25|$|The {{importance}} of helper T cells {{can be seen}} from HIV, a virus that primarily infects CD4+ T cells. In the advanced stages of HIV infection, loss of functional CD4+ T cells leads to the symptomatic stage of infection known as the <b>acquired</b> <b>immunodeficiency</b> <b>syndrome</b> (AIDS). When the HIV virus is detected early in blood or other bodily fluids, continuous therapy can delay the time at which this fall happens. Therapy can also better manage the course of AIDS if and when it occurs. There are other rare disorders such as lymphocytopenia which result in the absence or dysfunction of CD4+ T cells. These disorders produce similar symptoms, many of which are fatal.|$|E
25|$|HIV (human {{immunodeficiency}} virus) {{damages the}} body's immune system, which interferes with {{its ability to}} fight off disease-causing agents. The virus kills CD4 cells, which are white blood cells that help fight off various infections. HIV is carried in body fluids, and is spread by sexual activity. It can also be spread by contact with infected blood, breast feeding, childbirth, and from mother to child during pregnancy. When HIV is at its most advanced stage, an individual {{is said to have}} AIDS (<b>acquired</b> <b>immunodeficiency</b> <b>syndrome).</b> There are different stages of the progression of and HIV infection. The stages include primary infection, asymptomatic infection, symptomatic infection, and AIDS. In the primary infection stage, an individual will have flu like symptoms (headache, fatigue, fever, muscle aches) for about 2 weeks. In the asymptomatic stage, symptoms usually disappear, and the patient can remain asymptomatic for years. When HIV progresses to the symptomatic stage, the immune system is weakened, and has a low cell count of CD4+ T Cells. When the HIV infection becomes life-threatening, it is called AIDS. People with AIDS fall prey to opportunistic infections and die as a result. When the disease was first discovered in the 1980s, those who had AIDS were not likely to live longer than a few years. There are now antiretroviral drugs (ARVs) available to treat HIV infections. There is no known cure for HIV or AIDS but the drugs help suppress the virus. By suppressing the amount of virus in the body, people can lead longer and healthier lives. Even though their virus levels may be low they can still spread the virus to others.|$|E

40|$|Nucleoside analogues {{are first}} line {{chemotherapy}} in various severe diseases: AIDS (<b>acquired</b> <b>immunodeficiency</b> disease <b>syndrome),</b> cytomegalovirus infections, cancer, etc. However, many nucleoside analogues exhibit poor oral bioavailability {{because of their}} high polarity and low intestinal permeability. In order to get around this drawback, prodrugs have been utilized to improve lipophilicity by chemical modification of the parent drug. Alternatively, prodrugs targeting transporters present in the intestine have been applied to promote the transport of the nucleoside analogues. Valacyclovir and valganciclovir are two classic valine ester prodrugs transported by oligopeptide transporter 1. The ideal prodrug achieves delivery of a parent drug by attaching a non-toxic moiety that is stable during transport, but is readily degraded to the parent drug once at the target.

40|$|Abstract Background Reports of <b>acquired</b> <b>immunodeficiency</b> due to autoantibodies against {{interferon}} gamma {{in the adult}} population are increasing. The interleukin- 12 -dependent interferon-gamma axis is a major regulatory pathway of cell-mediated immunity and is critical for protection against a few intracellular organisms, including non-tuberculous mycobacteria and Salmonella spp. We report the first case of a fatal disseminated Mycobacterium colombiense /cytomegalovirus coinfection in an adult woman associated with the acquisition of autoantibodies against interferon-gamma. Case presentation A 49 -year-old woman, born to nonconsanguineous parents in Laos, but {{who had lived in}} Canada for the past 30 years, presented with a 1 -month history of weight loss, fatigue, cough, and intermittent low-grade fever. A thoracic computed tomography scan revealed an 8 × 7 cm irregular mass impacting the right superior lobar bronchus along with multiple mediastinal and hilar adenopathies. On the fourth day of admission, the patient developed fever with purulent expectorations. Treatment for a post-obstructive bacterial pneumonia was initiated while other investigations were being pursued. Almost every culture performed during the patient’s hospitalization was positive for M. colombiense. Given the late presentation of symptoms - at the age of 49 years - and the absence of significant family or personal medical history, we suspected an <b>acquired</b> <b>immunodeficiency</b> due to the presence of anti-interferon-gamma autoantibodies. This was confirmed by their detection at high levels in the plasma and a STAT 1 phosphorylation assay on human monocytes. The final diagnosis was immunodeficiency secondary to the production of autoantibodies against interferon-gamma, which resulted in a post-obstructive pneumonia and disseminated infection of M. colombiense. The clinical course was complicated by the presence of a multiresistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa post-endobronchial ultrasound mediastinitis, cytomegalovirus pneumonitis with dissemination, and finally, susceptible P. aeruginosa ventilator-associated pneumonia with septic shock and multiple organ failure, leading to death despite appropriate antibacterial and anti-mycobacterial treatment. Conclusions Although rare, <b>acquired</b> <b>immunodeficiency</b> <b>syndromes</b> should be considered in the differential diagnosis of patients with severe, persistent, or recurrent infections. Specifically, severe non-tuberculous mycobacteria or Salmonella infections in adults without any other known risk factors may warrant examination of autoantibodies against interferon-gamma because of their increasing recognition in the literature. </p...|$|R

Kaplan-Meier method, Logistic regression and Cox proportional hazards model were applied to identify the related factors of progression to AIDS or death following HIV diagnosis. Results: By the end of February 2012, 181 of 691 HIV infectors developed to AIDS, and 129 of 470 AIDS patients died among whom 289 cases received concurrent HIV/AIDS diagnosis. Compared with men infected through homosexual behavior, injection drug users possessed sharply decreased hazard ratio (HR) for progression to AIDS following HIV diagnosis [HR = 0. 31, 95 % confidence interval (CI), 0. 18 – 0. 54, P = 4. 0161025]. HIV infectors at least 60 years presented 1. 15 -fold (HR = 2. 15, 95 % CI, 1. 15 – 4. 03, P = 0. 017) increased risk to develop AIDS when compared with those aged 17 – 29 years.

Candida infection rarely occurs in healthy individuals but it is frequently associated with patients who suffer from <b>acquired</b> <b>immunodeficiency</b> <b>syndromes.</b> To date, there is no effective vaccine against this fungal infection. Herein we demonstrated the use of immunomics to characterize promiscuous T cell epitope of C. albicans virulence factors by utilizing CandiVF, a C. albicans database previously constructed to be equipped with protein sequence analysis tool, three dimensional structure visualization software, sequence variable analysis program and Hotspot Hunter epitope prediction tool. Secretory aspartyl proteinase (Sap) family was chosen as a model to validate the Hotspot Hunter prediction. Analysis of Saps 1 - 10 protein entries from CandiVF database revealed that a consensus T cell epitope was located at the C-terminal region of Saps 1 - 10. The result of the in silico prediction was subsequently validated by conventional immunological methods. By using overlapping peptides span the predicted consensus T cell epitopes of Saps 1 - 10 as stimulators, it was demonstrated that peptides S 6 and S 7 could stimulate PBMC proliferation in 9 of 12 blood donors. Interestingly, S 2, the predicted T cell epitope of Sap 2, was able to induce proliferation of all donors 2 ̆ 7 PBMC. ELISpot assay for the detection of gamma-interferon producing clones confirmed that the peptide S 2 actually stimulated T cell proliferation.

40|$|We {{investigated}} {{the role of}} intracellular iron on the capacity of Histoplasma capsulatum (Hc) yeasts to multiply within human macrophages (Mphi). Coculture of Hc-infected Mphi with the iron chelator deferoxamine suppressed the growth of yeasts in a concentration-dependent manner. The effect of deferoxamine was reversed by iron-saturated transferrin (holotransferrin) but not by iron-free transferrin (apotransferrin). Chloroquine, which prevents release of iron from transferrin by raising endocytic and lysosomal pH, induced human Mphi to kill Hc. The effect of chloroquine was reversed by iron nitriloacetate, an iron compound that is soluble at neutral to alkaline pH, but not by holotransferrin, which releases iron only in an acidic environment. Chloroquine (40 - 120 mg/kg) given intraperitoneally for 6 d to Hc-infected C 57 BL/ 6 mice significantly reduced the growth of Hc in a dose-dependent manner. At 120 mg/kg there was a 17 - and 15 -fold reduction (P < 0. 01) in CFU in spleens and livers, respectively. The therapeutic effect of chloroquine also correlated with the length of treatment. As little as 2 d of chloroquine therapy (120 mg/kg), when started at day 5 after infection, reduced CFU in the spleen by 50 %. Treatment with chloroquine for 10 d after a lethal inoculum of Hc protected six of nine mice; all control mice were dead by day 11 (P = 0. 009). This study demonstrates that: (a) iron is of critical importance to the survival and multiplication of Hc yeasts in human Mphi; (b) in vitro, chloroquine induces Mphi killing of Hc yeasts by restricting the availability of intracellular iron; and (c) in vivo, chloroquine significantly reduces the number of organisms in the spleens and livers of Hc-infected mice and can protect mice from a lethal inoculum of Hc yeasts.
