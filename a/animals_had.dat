5|$|The History of <b>Animals</b> <b>had</b> a {{powerful}} influence on zoology for some two thousand years. It {{continued to be}} a primary source of knowledge until in the sixteenth century zoologists including Conrad Gessner, all influenced by Aristotle, wrote their own studies of the subject.|$|E
5|$|In May 2005, a {{veterinarian}} named Kris Nelson filed {{a series of}} complaints against the zoo regarding animal care and management. Her complaints were backed by two former zoo employees: a chief veterinarian and an animal nutritionist. The complaints stated that dozens of <b>animals</b> <b>had</b> been harmed or {{died as a result}} of poor management, feeding practices, and quarantine procedures. Another veterinarian, 15-year zoo employee Kathy Orr, discounted many of Nelson's claims as being either invalid, or having been corrected already.|$|E
5|$|In late October 2007, 50 tuatara {{collected}} as {{eggs from}} North Brother Island and hatched at Victoria University were being released onto Long Island {{in the outer}} Marlborough Sounds.

40|$|The question, whether <b>animals</b> <b>have</b> souls, is ambig-uous. Itcan have a {{religious}} or a psychological meaning: • Do <b>animals</b> <b>have</b> (immortal) souls? • Do <b>animals</b> <b>have</b> inner life, i. e., do <b>animals</b> <b>have</b> subjective psychological experiences? At first I {{was not very}} happy with these alternatives, because both questions seemed unpromising for several reasons. I just want to mention two of these reasons: • Whether <b>animals</b> <b>have</b> immortal souls is as incapable of proof as is the existence of God; • That <b>animals</b> do <b>have</b> inner life {{seems to be a}} rather obvious assertion. Upon reflection, though, the second, psychological question doesn't seem so unimportant to me after all. Though today no one would be likely to defend th...|$|R

5|$|In {{the early}} 1920s, {{there was an}} {{outbreak}} of a previously unrecognized cattle disease in the northern United States and Canada. Cattle were haemorrhaging after minor procedures and on some occasions, spontaneously. For example, 21 out of 22 cows died after dehorning and 12 out of 25 bulls died after castration. All of these <b>animals</b> <b>had</b> bled to death.|$|E
5|$|Nothing {{is known}} {{of the history of}} the animals before their {{installation}} in the 1917 carousel assembly. During the 1960s newspaper reports stated that it was believed that the <b>animals</b> <b>had</b> arrived in Indianapolis in 1917, imported from Germany by two brothers named Mangels, but later research revealed the animals were manufactured by the Dentzel carousel company. Also included in the installation were oil paintings on the canopy over the animals and mechanism.|$|E

5|$|The five {{processes}} formed what Aristotle {{called the}} soul: {{it was not}} something extra, but the system consisting exactly of these mechanisms. The Aristotelian soul died with the animal and was thus purely biological. Different types of organism possessed different types of soul. Plants had a vegetative soul, responsible for reproduction and growth. <b>Animals</b> <b>had</b> both a vegetative and a sensitive soul, responsible for mobility and sensation. Humans, uniquely, had a vegetative, a sensitive, and a rational soul, capable of thought and reflection.|$|E
5|$|After {{the death}} of George IV in 1830, a {{decision}} was made to close down the Menagerie. In 1831, most of the stock was moved to the London Zoo which had opened in 1828. The last of the animals left in 1835, relocated to Regent's Park. This decision was made after an incident, although sources vary as to the specifics: either a lion was accused of biting a soldier, or a sailor, Ensign Seymour, had been bitten by a monkey. The Menagerie buildings were removed in 1852 but the Keeper of the Royal Menagerie was entitled to use the Lion Tower as a house for life. Consequently, even though the <b>animals</b> <b>had</b> long since left the building, the tower was not demolished until {{the death of}} Copps, the last keeper, in 1853.|$|E
5|$|As a boy, Georges Cuvier (1769-1832) {{read the}} Comte de Buffon's Histoire Naturelle from the {{previous}} century, as well as Linnaeus and Fabricius. He was brought to Paris by Étienne Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire in 1795, {{not long after the}} French Revolution. He soon became a professor of animal anatomy at the Musée National d'Histoire Naturelle, surviving changes of government from revolutionary to Napoleonic to monarchy. Essentially on his own he created the discipline of vertebrate palaeontology and the accompanying comparative method. He demonstrated that <b>animals</b> <b>had</b> become extinct.|$|E

5|$|Before any troop {{transportation}} {{could be}} undertaken, {{all of the}} ships had to be hastily refitted. Of the fourteen ships, four, including El Occidente, were designated to carry animals and cargo; the other ten were designated to carry human passengers. The four ships designated to carry <b>animals</b> <b>had</b> to have ramps and stalls built. All the ships had to have gun platforms installed, before each ship docked at the Brooklyn Navy Yard to have the guns themselves installed. All the ships were manned by merchant officers and crews but carried two U.S. Navy officers, Navy gun crews, quartermasters, signalmen, and wireless operators. The senior Navy officer on board would take control if a ship came under attack.|$|E
5|$|Darwin was a {{prolific}} writer. Even without {{publication of his}} works on evolution, {{he would have had}} a considerable reputation as the author of The Voyage of the Beagle, as a geologist who had published extensively on South America and had solved the puzzle of the formation of coral atolls, and as a biologist who had published the definitive work on barnacles. While On the Origin of Species dominates perceptions of his work, The Descent of Man and The Expression of the Emotions in Man and <b>Animals</b> <b>had</b> considerable impact, and his books on plants including The Power of Movement in Plants were innovative studies of great importance, as was his final work on The Formation of Vegetable Mould through the Action of Worms.|$|E
5|$|During {{a renewed}} {{investigation}} of the crime in 2005, the Department of Justice exhumed Till's remains to conduct an autopsy and DNA analysis which confirmed the identification of his body. Till was reburied in a new casket later that year. In 2009, his original glass-topped casket was found, rusting in a dilapidated storage shed at the cemetery. The casket was discolored and the interior fabric torn. It bore evidence that <b>animals</b> <b>had</b> been living in it, although its glass top was still intact. The Smithsonian's National Museum of African American History and Culture in Washington, D.C. acquired the casket a month later. According to director Lonnie Bunch III, it is an artifact {{with the potential to}} stop future visitors and make them think.|$|E

In 1995, 50juvenile and 18adult Brothers Island tuatara were moved to Titi Island in Cook Strait, and their establishment monitored. Two years later, {{more than half of the}} <b>animals</b> <b>had</b> been seen again and of those all but one had gained weight. In 1998, 34juveniles from captive breeding and 20 wild-caught adults were similarly transferred to Matiu/Somes Island, a more publicly accessible location within Wellington Harbour. The captive juveniles were from induced layings from wild females.|$|E
5|$|The genus Equus {{was first}} {{described}} by Carl Linnaeus in 1758. It {{is the only}} recognized extant genus in the family Equidae. The first equids were small, dog-sized mammals (e.g. Eohippus) adapted for browsing on shrubs during the Eocene, around 54 million years ago (mya). These <b>animals</b> <b>had</b> three toes on the hind feet and four on the front feet with small hooves in place of claws but also had soft pads. Equids developed into larger, three-toed animals (e.g. Mesohippus) during the Oligocene and Miocene. From there, the tridactyl toes became progressively smaller through the Pleistocene until {{the emergence of the}} single-toed Equus.|$|E
5|$|This {{evidence}} that giant reptiles had lived on Earth {{in the past}} caused great excitement in scientific circles, and even among some segments of the general public. Buckland did describe the jaw of a small primitive mammal, Phascolotherium, that {{was found in the}} same strata as Megalosaurus. This discovery, known as the Stonesfield mammal, was a much discussed anomaly. Cuvier at first thought it was a marsupial, but Buckland later realized it was a primitive placental mammal. Due to its small size and primitive nature, Buckland did not believe it invalidated the overall pattern of an age of reptiles, when the largest and most conspicuous <b>animals</b> <b>had</b> been reptiles rather than mammals.|$|E

5|$|Very {{little is}} known of the soft tissue of temnospondyls. A block of sandstone, {{described}} in 2007 from the Early Carboniferous Mauch Chunk Formation of Pennsylvania, included impressions of the bodies of three temnospondyls. These impressions show, when alive, they had smooth skin, robust limbs with webbed feet, and a ridge of skin on their undersides. Trackways referable to small temnospondyls have also been found in Carboniferous and Permian rocks. The trackways, called batrachichni, are usually found in strata deposited around freshwater environments, suggesting the <b>animals</b> <b>had</b> some ties to the water.|$|E
5|$|Along {{with other}} members of the lipocalin protein family, major urinary {{proteins}} can be potent allergens to humans. The reason for this is not known, however molecular mimicry between Mups and structurally similar human lipocalins has been proposed as a possible explanation. The protein product of the mouse Mup17 gene, known as Musm1, Ag1 or MA1, accounts for much of the allergenic properties of mouse urine. The protein is extremely stable in the environment; studies have found 95% of inner city homes, and 82% of all types of homes in the United States have detectable levels in at least one room. Similarly, Ratn1 is a known human allergen. A US study found its presence in 33% of inner city homes, and 21% of occupants were sensitized to the allergen. Exposure and sensitization to rodent Mup proteins is considered a risk factor for childhood asthma, and is a leading cause of laboratory animal allergy (LAA)—an occupational disease of laboratory animal technicians and scientists. One study found that two-thirds of laboratory workers who had developed asthmatic reactions to <b>animals</b> <b>had</b> antibodies to Ratn1.|$|E
5|$|Beddard (1858–1925) was an English {{zoologist}} {{specializing in}} Annelid worms, but writing much more widely on topics including mammals and zoogeography. He also contributed articles on earthworms, leeches and nematode worms to the 1911 Encyclopædia Britannica. His decision {{to write an}} accessible book on animal coloration falls into this pattern. Beddard wrote Animal Coloration {{at a time when}} scientists' confidence in Charles Darwin's theory of evolution by natural selection was at a low ebb. Beddard's book was part of an ongoing debate among zoologists about how far natural selection affected animals, and how far other forces – such as the direct action of light – might be the causes of observed features such as the colours of animals. Edward Bagnall Poulton's far more strongly pro-Darwinian book The Colours of <b>Animals</b> <b>had</b> appeared just two years earlier in 1890.|$|E
50|$|Provisions {{for animal}} cruelty were {{originally}} enacted in 1892. Cattle and other working <b>animals</b> <b>have</b> more protection than other species.
