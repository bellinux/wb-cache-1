5|$|Almost all jumping spiders are predators, mostly {{preying on}} insects, on other spiders, {{and on other}} arthropods. The most common {{procedure}} is sighting the prey, stalking, fastening <b>a</b> <b>silk</b> safety line to the surface, using the two pairs of back legs {{to jump on the}} victim, and finally biting the prey. Most jumping spiders walk throughout the day, so that they maximize their chances of a catch.|$|E
5|$|England under Henry IV {{was also}} looking to develop <b>a</b> <b>silk</b> industry, but no {{opportunity}} arose until the revocation of the Edict of Nantes the 1680s, when {{hundreds of thousands}} of French Huguenots, many of whom were skilled weavers and experts in sericulture, began immigrating to England to escape religious persecution. Some areas, including Spitalfields saw many high-quality silk workshops spring up, their products distinct from continental silk largely by the colors used. Nonetheless, the British climate prevented England's domestic silk trade from becoming globally dominant.|$|E

5|$|Females of P. labiata and P. schultzi try to {{kill and}} eat their mates during or after copulation, by {{twisting}} and lunging.

Only rarely did these new silk industries grow to any significant size.|$|E

5|$|Soon {{after this}} however, {{in the early}} 7th century, {{as a result of}} extreme {{military}} and political pressure on the Byzantine Empire, public bathing changed from being a common luxury to a rare and infrequent one, and many public facilities and venues began to be used for the austere purposes of the military. They are last attested as being used as baths in 713, before being converted to other uses: part of the building became the prison known as Noumera, while another part appears to have been used as <b>a</b> <b>silk</b> workshop.|$|E

50|$|Another {{result of}} the revolt of Lyon was the {{dramatic}} decrease in wages after {{the suppression of the}} revolt and the introduction of larger-scale industry into the process of silk production. The decrease of specialization of labor in the silk industry greatly lowered the wage rates themselves. With the process of industrialization that occurred, anyone could become <b>a</b> master <b>silk</b> weaver. In some circles, the decrease in wages was seen as a public injustice.1 <b>As</b> <b>silk</b> production in Lyon was being rebuilt, the emphasis was placed more and more on centralized industrial production and less on the traditional artisan system.|$|R

5|$|Born in the Melbourne {{suburb of}} St Kilda on 8June 1919, Bill Newton was the {{youngest}} child of dentist Charles Ellis Newton and his second wife Minnie.

Bill entered Melbourne Grammar School in 1929, but two years later switched to the nearby St Kilda Park Central School as the family income was reduced through {{the impact of the}} Great Depression. In 1934, aged fifteen, he was able to return to Melbourne Grammar where, despite struggling with his schoolwork, he completed his Intermediate certificate. He gave up further study when his father died suddenly of a heart attack at the age of fifty-one, and began working in <b>a</b> <b>silk</b> warehouse.|$|E

5|$|During the 1340s Sir John Radclyffe campaigned with Edward III in France, {{distinguishing}} {{himself at}} the battles of Caen, Crècy and Calais. As a reward for his service, the king allowed Sir John to take some Flemish weavers back to his Ordsall estate, where he built cottages for them to live in. English weaving skills at that time were poor, and textiles from Manchester {{were considered to be}} of particularly poor quality, so the Flemish weavers were employed in instructing the local weavers. They also started up <b>a</b> <b>silk</b> weaving industry, the foundation for Manchester's later cotton industry.|$|E
5|$|Eggs are {{individually}} {{deposited on}} leaf hairs and corn silks (not in reference given). The eggs are initially pale green in color, {{but over time}} they turn yellowish and then grey. Eggs are 0.5mm in height and average about 0.55mm in diameter. They hatch after 66 to 72 hours of development. Once larvae have breached the chorion, they spend up to 85% of their time emerging from their shell. In this eclosion process, the larvae work to make the exit hole larger than their heads. Larvae {{spend the rest of}} the time making <b>a</b> <b>silk</b> meshwork around the exit hole; this both helps them escape the shell and helps them find the shell afterwards so they can feed on it. After feeding on their shell, larvae rest about 3 minutes before they begin feeding on the plant material around them.|$|E
5|$|Furniture {{during the}} Baroque era was {{in keeping with}} the style: ornate, gilded and {{frequently}} with marble used for tabletops. The furniture was transient within the house, frequently moved between rooms as required, while leaving other rooms unfurnished. Sometimes furniture was specifically commissioned for a certain room, for example to match <b>a</b> <b>silk</b> wall panel within a gilt frame. As in the rest of Europe, the furniture would always be left arranged against a wall, to be moved forward by servants if required, never in the later conversational style in the centre of a room, which in the Baroque era was always left empty so as better to display the marble, or more often ceramic, patterned floor tiles.|$|E
