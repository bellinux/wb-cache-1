5|$|The {{structure}} of NATO evolved throughout the Cold War and its aftermath. An integrated military structure for NATO was first established in 1950 {{as it became}} clear that NATO would need to enhance its defences for the longer term against a potential Soviet attack.

The brazen reorganization of German territory by the French risked threatening Prussian influence in the region, if not eliminating it outright. War fever in Berlin rose steadily throughout the summer of 1806. At the insistence of his court, especially his wife Queen Louise, Frederick William III decided to challenge the French domination of Central Europe by going to war.|$|E

5|$|Anton Rubinstein was {{a famous}} Russian pianist who had lived, {{performed}} and composed in Western <b>and</b> <b>Central</b> <b>Europe</b> before he returned to Russia in 1858. He saw Russia as a musical desert compared to Paris, Berlin and Leipzig, whose music conservatories he had visited. Musical life flourished in those places; composers were held in high regard, and musicians were wholeheartedly devoted to their art. With a similar ideal in mind for Russia, he had conceived {{an idea for a}} conservatory in Russia years before his 1858 return, and had finally aroused the interest of influential people to help him realize the idea.|$|E
5|$|Departing Bermuda, Gonzalo {{accelerated}} {{toward the}} waters of the North Atlantic, passing close to southeastern Newfoundland before becoming extratropical on October 19.

A large storm system involving the remnants of Gonzalo battered the British Isles <b>and</b> <b>central</b> <b>Europe</b> on October 21, killing three people in the United Kingdom and severely hindering transportation. The system later played a role in triggering torrential rains over the Balkans, which resulted in severe flooding in Greece and Bulgaria.|$|E

5|$|In Europe, {{occupation}} {{came under}} two forms. In Western, Northern, <b>and</b> <b>Central</b> <b>Europe</b> (France, Norway, Denmark, the Low Countries, and the annexed portions of Czechoslovakia) Germany established economic policies through which it collected roughly 69.5 billion reichmarks (27.8 billion US Dollars) {{by the end}} of the war, this figure does not include the sizeable plunder of industrial products, military equipment, raw materials and other goods. Thus, the income from occupied nations was over 40 per cent of the income Germany collected from taxation, a figure which increased to nearly 40 per cent of total German income as the war went on.|$|E
5|$|The East Germanic Goths and Gepids, {{who lived}} in {{sedentary}} communities, were the first new arrivals. The Goths dominated Moldavia and Wallachia from the 290s, and parts of Transylvania from the 330s. Their power collapsed under attacks by the nomadic Huns in 376. The Huns controlled Eastern <b>and</b> <b>Central</b> <b>Europe</b> from around 400, but their empire disintegrated in 454. Thereafter the regions west of the Carpathian MountainsBanat, Crişana, and Transylvaniaand Oltenia were dominated by the Gepids. Within a century, the lands east of the mountains became important centers of the Antes and Sclavenes. Hydronyms and place names of Slavic origin also prove the one-time presence of Early Slavs in the regions west of the Carpathians.|$|E
5|$|The North Atlantic {{oscillation}} is an atmospheric phenomenon {{affecting the}} weather in Western Europe. When the atmospheric pressure variations in the North Atlantic are large, the springs in Europe are warmer. This brings forward the northward migration of those bird species (including the goldcrest) that winter mainly within western or southern Europe. A general climatic change resulting in more frequent positive North Atlantic oscillation events has led to earlier spring migration of these short-distance migrants since the 1980s. The warmer spring weather brings on plant growth, thus preparing the habitat for returning migrants. The effect is greatest in western <b>and</b> <b>central</b> <b>Europe.</b>|$|E
