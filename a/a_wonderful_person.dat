Some fans speculate that this is a response to the inside tray of Radiohead's album OK Computer which contains the text [...] "I like you. I like you. You are <b>a</b> <b>wonderful</b> <b>person.</b> I'm full of enthusiasm. I'm going places. I'll be happy to help you. I am an important person, would you like to come home with me?" [...] Weezer's official explanation was vague, with webmaster Karl Koch stating [...] "No means no." ...|$|E
500|$|During his career, Ford {{developed}} a reputation as an immensely physical centre-forward, especially toward opposition goalkeepers. His Wales international teammate John Charles commented on his playing style, stating that [...] "He used to bang everybody and knock {{them out of the}} way, he was never frightened" [...] but also described him as <b>a</b> <b>wonderful</b> <b>person.</b> Former England international Gil Merrick accused Ford of maltreating goalkeepers in his autobiography, although Ford later sued Merrick, stating that he had never been cautioned or sent off over his style of play, and received an apology and the withdrawal of the book over the claim. Ford himself stated that his personality was transformed once he stepped onto a football pitch, describing himself as [...] "Like an animal" [...] but also commenting that he was simply [...] "doing his job and doing it well" [...] Billy Bingham later stated [...] "He got some terrible knocks from goalkeepers but he also knew how to dish it out and he never complained to refs".|$|E

While talking to reporters in South Carolina, Thompson said, [...] "I attend church when I'm in Tennessee. I'm [...] in McLean right now. I don't attend {{regularly}} when I'm up there." [...] On occasion, Thompson attended Vienna Presbyterian Church in Vienna, Virginia. He did not speak much about his religion during his campaign, saying, [...] "Me getting up and talking about what <b>a</b> <b>wonderful</b> <b>person</b> I am and that sort of thing, I'm not comfortable with that, and I don't think it does me any good." ...|$|E
2500|$|In an {{interview}} with Alternative Press in September 2010 (in an article praising the album 10 years later) when asked [...] "What's your least favorite thing about the album?" [...] Rodriguez replied: [...] "In a heartbeat I could tell you, one of my only regrets out of everything I've ever done {{is the way that}} record was mixed. People think that was a raw and energetic record, but what they're hearing is nothing compared to what it truly was before it was glossed over and sent through the mixing mill that was Andy Wallace, who is <b>a</b> <b>wonderful</b> <b>person</b> and a very talented mixing engineer and has done great albums – I'm not trying to offend him....and I understand he had the pressure of the label and all the people who had dreams of it being this grandiose thing, and being played on the radio, which it was, (but) that record is ruined by the mix. [...] I just find it the most passive, plastic....It's the one record I still to this day cannot listen to." [...] The album was included in Rock Sounds 101 Modern Classics list at number 4.

6000|$|... "Miss Van Teyl," [...] he declared, [...] "you {{are quite}} <b>a</b> <b>wonderful</b> <b>person.</b> I have never {{believed}} {{very much in}} women before. Perhaps {{that is the reason}} why I have never married." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'You can? My dear young lady, what <b>a</b> <b>wonderful</b> <b>person</b> you are! You {{seem to know}} everybody, and everything. But {{perhaps she}} was at Schlangenbad with Lady Georgina, and you were there also?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, {{you must}} take me home, please," [...] said she. [...] "It was selfish of me. Only Mademoiselle Idiale is such <b>a</b> <b>wonderful</b> <b>person.</b> Do you think that she will want you every night?" ...|$|E
60|$|Strickland {{helped me}} to sort them, {{and he said that}} the writer was either an extreme liar or <b>a</b> most <b>wonderful</b> <b>person.</b> He thought the former. One of these days, {{you may be able to}} judge for yourself. The bundle needed much expurgation and was full of Greek nonsense, at the head of the chapters, which has all been cut out.|$|R
6000|$|... "Of course I do," [...] he admitted. [...] "She's <b>a</b> {{perfectly}} <b>wonderful</b> <b>person,</b> isn't she? Let's {{get out of}} this Victorian environment," [...] he added, {{looking around}} the huge apartment with its formal arrangement of furniture and its atmosphere of prim but faded elegance. [...] "We'll go into the smaller room and tell Brookes to bring us some cocktails and cigarettes. Chalmers won't expect to be received formally, and Mademoiselle Karetsky will appreciate the cosmopolitan note of our welcome." ...|$|R

5000|$|... "This {{is one of}} {{the more}} {{saddening}} times I have experienced. Not only have we lost a great race car driver but <b>a</b> kind and <b>wonderful</b> <b>person</b> as well. I have represented numerous drivers, and Scott was as talented as many of those in the top echelon of NASCAR right now. I extend my deepest sympathy to Scott's family and personal friends." ...|$|R

6000|$|I am in {{the throes}} of a new comedy.

His society is a series of [...] revelations. [...] .|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{really are}} <b>a</b> <b>wonderful</b> <b>person,</b> Philip," [...] she declared. [...] "It's the same play, {{just as you}} used to tell it me, word for word. And yet it isn't.

6000|$|Mary {{would have}} been <b>a</b> <b>wonderful</b> <b>person</b> had she not {{instantly}} and utterly forgotten all her conclusions from Frampton's having declared him gone to Beauchastel for an unlimited time; but all she did was to turn away her crimson tearful face, and reply, 'Your father would not wish it now.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I can't tell. She is <b>a</b> <b>wonderful</b> <b>person</b> {{for keeping}} herself {{composed}} when she ought. I see she has his picture in full view, {{but she says}} not a word, except that mamma saw her to-day, when she thought no one was looking, fondling the little thing, and whispering to it--"Guy's baby!" [...] and [...] "Guy's little messenger!"' Charles gave up the struggle, and fairly cried, but in a moment rallying his usual tone, he went on, half laughing,--'To be sure, what a morsel of a creature it is! It is awful to see anything so small calling itself a specimen of humanity!' ...|$|E
60|$|Anna {{loved to}} watch him. She liked the big, new, {{rambling}} vicarage, desolate and stark on its hill. It was so exposed, so bleak and bold after the Marsh. The Baron talked endlessly in Polish to Mrs. Brangwen; he made furious gestures with his hands, {{his blue eyes}} were full of fire. And to Anna, there was a significance about his sharp, flinging movements. Something in her responded to his extravagance and his exuberant manner. She thought him <b>a</b> very <b>wonderful</b> <b>person.</b> She was shy of him, she liked him to talk to her. She {{felt a sense of}} freedom near him.|$|R
6000|$|... "I do {{not know}} her," [...] he said. [...] "I know who she is, of course,--every one does. She is a Servian, {{and they say that}} she is devoted to her country. She left Vienna at a moment's notice, only a few days ago, and they say that it was because she had sworn never to sing again before the enemies of her country. She had been engaged a long time to appear at Covent Garden, but no one {{believed}} that she would really come. She breaks her engagements just when she chooses. In fact, she is <b>a</b> very <b>wonderful</b> <b>person</b> altogether." ...|$|R
5000|$|Rudisill {{was born}} Edna Marie Faulk in Monroeville, Alabama. Her first marriage, to a Japanese {{man in the}} 1930s, ended in divorce due to her family's disapproval.

He was so talented and such <b>a</b> sweet <b>wonderful</b> <b>person.</b> And I would have been happier with him than I was with the man I married after that." [...] She married James Rudisill in 1939. She wrote, [...] "A man who drinks excessively, it's not a happy marriage. We loved each other, but we had our times."

6000|$|... "I see {{him more}} from the family point of view, I suppose," [...] Letitia observed, [...] "and yet, in a way, he is rather <b>a</b> <b>wonderful</b> <b>person.</b> For instance, I have never seen him hurry, I have never seen him angry, in the {{ordinary}} sense of the word; in fact he has the most amazing complacency I ever knew. Of course, Aunt Caroline," [...] she went on, turning to the Duchess a few moments later, [...] "if {{you want to stay}} with the men, pray do so. If not, you might take into account the fact that I have been trying to catch your eye for the last three minutes." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I know it. Dr. McLeod knows it, or he wouldn't {{be staying}} here, and you've both been too kind to tell me. You've been so kind, Mrs. Maturin--I can't talk about it. But I'm sure I'm going to die, I've really known {{it ever since}} we left Silliston. Something's gone out of me, the thing that drove me, that {{made me want to}} live--I can't express what I mean any other way. Perhaps it's this child, the new life--perhaps I've just been broken, I don't know. You did your best to mend me, and that's one thing that makes me sad. And the thought of Mr. Insall's another. In some ways it would have been worse to live--I couldn't have ruined his life. And even if things had been different, I hadn't come to love him, in that way--it's queer, because he's such <b>a</b> <b>wonderful</b> <b>person.</b> I'd like to live for the child, if only I had the strength, the will left in me--but that's gone. And maybe I could save her from--what I've been through." ...|$|E
5000|$|Reviewers have {{commented that}} {{although}} Lemmy {{has always said}} that the late Wendy O. Williams was <b>a</b> <b>wonderful</b> <b>person,</b> this doesn’t alter {{the fact that this}} is a truly horrible track.|$|E
5000|$|A {{memorial}} in Utah on April 12, 2014 {{was led by}} her brother Randall Bambrough. Bambrough urged people to remember Scott [...] "As <b>a</b> <b>wonderful</b> terrific <b>person</b> who was highly talented and had a very large heart and brought the best out in people.” [...] Her estranged, adoptive sister Jan Shane was also in attendance.

500|$|The Guardian {{called the}} {{recording}} by Capaldi a touching video tribute. CNN characterised the video similarly, as did Digital Spy, ITV News, TV 3, and publications in Spanish and Dutch. The Barcelona newspaper La Vanguardia [...] wrote that Capaldi's video {{was an example}} of bringing joy into someone's life through a small act. The Washington Post called it a touching message. The Daily Dot described the video as inspirational. The Independent contrasted Capaldi's portrayal of the 12th Doctor as one of the darker incarnations of the character with his kinder message as the same character in the video. MTV called Capaldi <b>a</b> most <b>wonderful</b> <b>person</b> for his act, and concluded that the video was quite endearing.|$|R
5000|$|It {{was first}} {{reported}} in December 2008 that Capshaw would be joining {{the cast of}} Grey's Anatomy as pediatric surgeon Arizona Robbins, for a multi-episode arc. Initially scheduled to appear in three episodes of the show's fifth season, series creator Shonda Rhimes later extended Capshaw's contract to appear {{in all of the}} season's remaining episodes, becoming a series regular in the sixth season. Speaking of the new addition, Rhimes said: I love Jessica Capshaw, and when I say love I mean love. She couldn't be <b>a</b> more <b>wonderful</b> <b>person,</b> and I feel like the chemistry Arizona and Callie have feels like the Meredith and Derek chemistry to me. I find them delightful to watch.
