5|$|After the cyclone has passed, devastation often continues. Standing {{water can}} cause the spread of disease, and {{transportation}} or communication infrastructure may have been destroyed, hampering clean-up and rescue efforts. Nearly two million people have died globally due to tropical cyclones. Despite their devastating effects, tropical cyclones are also beneficial, by potentially bringing rain to dry areas and moving heat from the tropics poleward. Out at sea, ships take <b>advantage</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> known characteristics by navigating through their weaker, western half.|$|E
5|$|Cornwallis was {{sensitive}} {{to the fact that}} Tipu was likely to deny the invading army access to local forage and provisions, so he made arrangements for a large supply of provisions and arranged for the use of elephants to assist in the movement of the army's siege equipment. He also encouraged the Marathas and the Nizam to step up their advances to join his army as quickly as possible so that he could take <b>advantage</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> cavalry.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{seeks to}} {{examine the impact of}} the foreign {{activities}} <b>of</b> firms on <b>their</b> international competitiveness. It addresses questions such as: to what extent and under what conditions can firms compensate for deteriorating location <b>advantages</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> home country and maintain their lead in an industry through investment in foreign countries? Under what conditions can firms reap the benefits of a locationally advantageous foreign country? These questions are examined with reference to selected US professional service industries. The findings show that FDI weakens the link between the location <b>advantages</b> <b>of</b> home countries and the ownership <b>advantages</b> <b>of</b> firms, as it enables firms to develop advantages which are not directly related to the location <b>advantages</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> home countries. However, this impact is very moderate, and is exercised through the indirect impact of FDI on the <b>advantages</b> <b>of</b> firms and countries. The ownership advantages which firms develop in their home countries are the most critical determinant <b>of</b> <b>their</b> competitiveness. ...|$|R

They are also used as fish bait in hook and line fishing.|$|E
5|$|Microbiology {{was largely}} ignored by early {{evolutionary}} theory. This {{was due to}} the paucity of morphological traits and the lack of a species concept in microbiology, particularly amongst prokaryotes. Now, evolutionary researchers are taking <b>advantage</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> improved understanding of microbial physiology and ecology, produced by the comparative ease of microbial genomics, to explore the taxonomy and evolution of these organisms. These studies are revealing unanticipated levels of diversity amongst microbes.|$|E

5|$|Apart {{from the}} {{economic}} realities of the conversion to sound, were the artistic considerations. Early sound films were often noted for being too verbose. In 1930, Carl Laemmle criticized the wall-to-wall banter of sound pictures, and director Ernst Lubitsch wondered what the camera was intended for if characters were going to narrate all the onscreen action. The film industry also withstood competition from the home radio, and often characters in films {{went to great lengths}} to belittle the medium. The film industry was not above using the new medium to broadcast commercials for its projects however, and occasionally turned radio stars into short feature performers to take <b>advantage</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> built-in following.|$|E
5|$|Cannon also {{transformed}} naval warfare: the Royal Navy, in particular, took <b>advantage</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> firepower. As rifling {{became more}} commonplace, {{the accuracy of}} cannon was significantly improved, and they became deadlier than ever, especially to infantry. In World War I, a considerable majority of all deaths were caused by cannon; they were also used widely in World War II. Most modern cannon {{are similar to those}} used in the Second World War, including autocannon—with the exception of naval guns, which are now significantly smaller in caliber.|$|E

5|$|During the Polish–Soviet War (1919–1921), {{some one}} hundred Russian ciphers were {{broken by a}} sizable cadre of Polish cryptologists who {{included}} army Lieutenant Jan Kowalewski and three world-famous professors of mathematics — Stefan Mazurkiewicz, Wacław Sierpiński and Stanisław Leśniewski. Russian army staffs were still following the same disastrously ill-disciplined signals-security procedures as had Tsarist army staffs during World War I, to the decisive <b>advantage</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> German enemy. As a result, during the Polish-Soviet War the Polish military were regularly kept informed by Russian signals stations about the movements of Russian armies and their intentions and operational orders.|$|E
5|$|John Hunyadi died on 11 August 1456, {{less than}} three weeks after his {{greatest}} victory over the Ottomans in Belgrade. John's elder sonMatthias's brotherLadislaus became the head of the family. Ladislaus's conflict with Ulrich of Celje ended with Ulrich's capture and assassination on 9 November. Under duress, the King promised he would never take his revenge against the Hunyadis for Ulrich's killing. However, the murder turned most baronsincluding Palatine Ladislaus Garai, Judge royal Ladislaus Pálóci, and Nicholas Újlaki, Voivode of Transylvaniaagainst Ladislaus Hunyadi. Taking <b>advantage</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> resentment, the King had the Hunyadi brothers imprisoned in Buda on 14 March 1457. The royal council condemned them to death for high treason and Ladislaus Hunyadi was beheaded on 16 March.|$|E

30|$|Moreover, even if {{they have}} a product that dominates the market, {{they are less likely to}} {{maintain}} the <b>advantages</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> existing market dominance than larger companies. When firms are in a dominant position in the market, they are likely to refuse to change and try to maintain their position in the existing market, thereby neglecting the importance of innovating and eventually falling behind in the market. However, manufacturing SMEs are less likely to try to maintain the <b>advantages</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> existing market {{even if they}} have a product that dominates the market, thereby continually innovating to keep up with the dynamic environment of the market. Thus, they can cope with market changes more sensitively and thus become more able to meet customer needs faithfully.

Both fee structures offer <b>advantages</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> own. The classic structure tends to attract liquidity removers while the credit structure appeals to liquidity providers. However, since both removers and providers of liquidity {{are necessary to}} create a market, ECNs must choose their fee structures carefully.|$|R
5|$|Tactically, the Persian fleet {{should have}} held the {{advantage}} at sea, since the Athenian {{part of the}} Greek fleet was, despite their efforts at Artemisium and Salamis, still raw in seamanship. However, whether because of their low morale, or {{because they were in}} fact outnumbered, the Persians sought instead the tactical advantage of joining up with the army under Tigranes, and fortifying a position. However, when the Greeks chose to fight on land, the Persians then threw away the <b>advantage</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> fortifications by emerging to fight the Greeks in the open field. Furthermore, as Marathon and Thermopylae had shown, large numbers conferred little advantage against the more heavily armoured hoplites; thus, as the battle began, it was the Greeks who had the tactical upper hand.|$|E
5|$|The Byzantines {{moved quickly}} to take <b>advantage</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> victory: a Byzantine army invaded Arab-held Armenia, and {{sometime}} in October or November, defeated and killed the emir Ali ibn Yahya. Thus, within a single campaigning season, the Byzantines had eliminated the three most dangerous opponents on their eastern border. In retrospect, these successes proved decisive, as the battle permanently destroyed the power of Melitene. The Byzantine victory at Lalakaon altered the strategic balance in the region, and heralded the beginning of Byzantium's century-long offensive in the East.|$|E

If a guard attempted to escape, his colleagues were under instructions to shoot him without hesitation or prior warning; 2,500 did escape to the West, 5,500 more were caught and imprisoned for up to five years, and a number were shot and killed or injured in the attempt.|$|E

The opposing forces were always within range of the Union cavalry carbines, keeping the weapon's seven-shot advantage—and not enabling the Confederate infantry to utilize the <b>advantage</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> longer range weapons.|$|E
5|$|Vahan and his Byzantine commanders did {{not manage}} {{to deal with}} this mounted force and use the sizable <b>advantage</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> army effectively. Their own Byzantine cavalry never played a {{significant}} role in the battle and were held in static reserve for most of the six days. They never pushed their attacks and even when they obtained what could have been a decisive breakthrough on the fourth day, they were unable to exploit it. There appeared to be a decided lack of resolve among the Imperial commanders, though this may have been caused by difficulties commanding the army because of internal conflict. Moreover, many of the Arab auxiliaries were mere levies, while the Muslim Arab army consisted for a much larger part of veteran troops.|$|E
5|$|Earlier in {{the morning}} Dupont had {{proceeded}} with his column south and east along the river, from Marbach, according to instructions. Even {{before the arrival of}} Mortier's courier, he heard the sound of artillery in the distance and sent riders ahead to discover the cause. They came back to report that a Russian column (Dokhturov's) was descending from the mountains to take the road to Dürenstein. Realizing this would separate him from the forward division, Dupont hustled his troops toward the sound of battle and deployed them to take the Russians in the flank. The French assault, heralded by cannon fire, caused Dokhturov's troops to turn their attention from Gazan's beleaguered force to face these new assailants. Although superior in numbers, Dokhturov's column had no supporting artillery, and the narrow space prevented them from taking <b>advantage</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> size. It was Dokhturov's turn to face attackers at his front and rear, until the arrival of Schmitt's column, which wended its way through the mountains in the west.|$|E
