Lentic waters range from ponds to lakes to wetlands, and much of this article applies to lentic ecosystems in general. Lentic ecosystems can be compared with lotic ecosystems, which involve flowing terrestrial waters such as rivers and streams. Together, these two fields form the more general study area of freshwater or <b>aquatic</b> <b>ecology.</b>|$|E
25|$|River {{ecosystems}} are prime examples of lotic ecosystems. Lotic refers to flowing water, from the Latin lotus, washed. Lotic waters range from springs {{only a few}} centimeters wide to major rivers kilometers in width. Much of this article applies to lotic ecosystems in general, including related lotic systems such as streams and springs. Lotic ecosystems can be contrasted with lentic ecosystems, which involve relatively still terrestrial waters such as lakes and ponds.

500|$|A {{stream is}} a flowing {{body of water}} with a current, {{confined}} within a bed and stream banks. In the United States, a stream is classified as a watercourse less than [...] wide. Streams are important as conduits in the water cycle, instruments in groundwater recharge, and they serve as corridors for fish and wildlife migration. The biological habitat {{in the immediate vicinity}} of a stream is called a riparian zone. Given the status of the ongoing Holocene extinction, streams play an important corridor role in connecting fragmented habitats and thus in conserving biodiversity. The study of streams and waterways in general involves many branches of inter-disciplinary natural science and engineering, including hydrology, fluvial geomorphology, <b>aquatic</b> <b>ecology,</b> fish biology, riparian ecology, and others.|$|E

40|$|In {{birds and}} {{feathered}} non-avian dinosaurs, within-feather pigmentation patterns range from discrete spots and stripes to more subtle patterns, but the latter remain largely unstudied. A ∼ 55 million year old fossil contour feather {{with a dark}} distal tip grading into a lighter base was recovered from the Fur Formation in Denmark. SEM and synchrotron-based trace metal mapping confirmed that this gradient was caused by differential concentration of melanin. To assess the potential ecological and phylogenetic prevalence of this pattern, we evaluated 321 modern samples from 18 orders within Aves.

40|$|Despite recent {{advances}} and new applications of molecular and biogeochemical methodology in <b>aquatic</b> microbial <b>ecology,</b> {{our perception of}} the aquatic microbial world remains one dominated by “free-living” bacteria that account {{for most of the}} microbial activities in the pelagic zone. Recent research has, however, shown that there exist vast and hidden “microbial networks” within the water column, connected via various microhabitats such as aggregates, fecal pellets and higher organisms. Bacterial abundance within these networks may rival or exceed that of the “free-living” bacteria. Hence, what we have learned in traditional <b>aquatic</b> microbial <b>ecology</b> represents merely a fraction of the microbial world. Within these networks a bacterium can travel long distances, communicate and closely interact with other bacteria and efficiently exchange genetic information with one another.

40|$|The Ballagan Formation (Late Tournaisian–Early Viséan) {{of central}} Scotland yields an {{ostracod}} fauna of 14 species in ten genera, namely Beyrichiopsis, Cavellina, Glyptolichvinella, Glyptopleura, Knoxiella, Paraparchites, Sansabella, Shemonaella, Silenites and Sulcella. The ostracods, {{in combination with}} palynomorphs, are important biostratigraphical indices for correlating the rock sequences, where other means of correlation, especially goniatites, conodonts, foraminifera, brachiopods or corals are absent. Stratigraphical distribution of the ostracods, calibrated with well-established palynomorph biozones, identifies three informally defined intervals: a sub-CM palynomorph Biozone interval with poor ostracod assemblages including Shemonaella scotoburdigalensis; a succeeding interval within the CM palynomorph Biozone where Cavellina coela, Cavellina incurvescens, Sansabella amplectans and the new species Knoxiella monarchella and Paraparchites discus first appear; and, an upper interval, in the upper CM Biozone, marked {{by the appearance of}} Sulcella affiliata. At least locally in central Scotland, S. affiliata permits a level of resolution equivalent to a sub-zonal upper division of the CM Biozone.
