However, despite {{a large number of}} studies, there is still a significant lack of knowledge regarding the physical processes involved. The present paper aims to address this issue by comprehensive laboratory tests. Two configurations were analysed and both <b>air</b> <b>release</b> <b>valves</b> and orifices were used for air venting. In the first configuration, the air vent was fitted at the downstream end of the pipeline, and the transient showed significant pressure surges consequent to the high velocity impact of the water column on the orifice (or the valve). In the second configuration, the air vent was fitted at an intermediate high point of the pipe profile. In this case, the transient showed very low velocity of the water column at the impact and, consequently, generally negligible pressure surges. © 2016 International Association for Hydro-Environment Engineering and Research...|$|R

40|$|One of {{the main}} issues arising during the rapid filling of a {{pipeline}} is the pressure transient which originates after the entrapped air has been expelled at the <b>air</b> <b>release</b> <b>valve.</b> Because {{of the difference in}} density between water and air, a pressure transient originates at the impact of the water column. Many authors have analyzed the problem, both from the theoretical and the experimental standpoint. Nevertheless, mainly vertical or horizontal pipelines have been analyzed, whereas in real field applications, the pipe profile is a sequence of ascending and descending pipes, with air release/vacuum valves at high points. To overcome lack of knowledge regarding this latter case, laboratory experiments were carried out to simulate the filling of an undulating pipeline, initially empty at atmospheric pressure. The pipe profile has a high point where an orifice is installed for air venting, so as to simulate the <b>air</b> <b>release</b> <b>valve</b> at intermediate high point of a supply pipeline. In the experiments, the diameter of the orifice and the opening degree of both upstream and downstream valves were varied, in order to analyze their effect on the pressure transient. The experiments were also carried out with a longer descending pipe, in order to assess the effects on the pressure surge of the air volume downstream of the orifice...|$|E
40|$|The Shuweihat Water Transmission Scheme (SWTS, UAE) {{consists}} of a twin DN 1600 DI PN 25 pipeline transmitting 150 MIGD over 250 km from Shuweihat Desalination plant to Mussafah (Abu Dhabi city). The Scheme is divided in two subsequent systems, each with a tank farm and a pump station delivering water to downstream terminal reservoirs and direct consumers. The first system (Lot A) transmits water from Shuweihat to Mirfa (100 km). The second (Lot C) is from Mirfa to Mussafah (150 km). The pipeline follows roughly the UAE coastline and the profile is generally flat with a few local high points. The surge study of the Lot C system investigated {{a large number of}} scenarios and resulted in the design of surge protection equipments and control systems. The surge protection equipment {{consists of}} 16 x 121 m 3 (1936 m 3) innovative vertical non-vented air vessels, invented by Deltares. The innovation includes a passive <b>air</b> <b>release</b> <b>valve</b> at a strategic elevation on the air vessel. This <b>air</b> <b>release</b> <b>valve</b> opens if the water level drops below the float level. At this water level the air pressure is super-atmospheric so that air is released from the air vessel to prevent draining. This innovation was driven by the initial findings of the surge analysis where it became apparent that 22 x 220 m 3 (4840 m 3) air vessels would have been required. These large vessels were the result of a double constraint. On the one hand, the initial air mass had to be sufficient to allow a proper expansion of the vessels and thus the protection of the pipeline against excessive negative pressures. On the other hand, a very small initial air mass was required {{due to the lack of}} backpressure. This meant that the air pocket was expanding by a factor exceeding 20, resulting in the emptying of the vessels. In this paper, we will describe the hydraulic model of the hybrid air vessel, detail the benefits of the new design and discuss the cost savings compared to conventional air vessels. It is concluded that the hybrid air vessel has saved over 50 % of the required air vessels total volume. Considering the size of air vessels initially required, the costs savings in terms of surge protection of the SWTS Lot C system were cut in excess of 60 %.

40|$|O presente trabalho tem por finalidade avaliar o volume de ar medido em ligações prediais de água por meio de ensaios de laboratório. Este problema tem gerado várias ações judiciais impetradas pelos consumidores de água, em tramitação na justiça de diversas comarcas brasileiras, que reclamam dos valores cobrados a mais pelos serviços de saneamento em virtude do volume de ar registrado pelos hidrômetros. Devido ao grande interesse pelo tema, este trabalho procura esclarecer alguns pontos desse conflito, por meio de ensaios numa bancada que simula um trecho de rede interligada a um ramal predial. Adicionalmente, foram efetuados testes para avaliar a eficiência e aplicabilidade de válvulas redutoras de ar em ligações prediais, uma vez que a Lei Estadual 12. 645 / 97 permite aos consumidores de água de Minas Gerais a instalação desses equipamentos. Além da avaliação dos aparelhos, verificouse a eficiência de uma ventosa, instalada a montante do ramal predial no ponto mais alto da rede de abastecimento de água. Os resultados obtidos, sob condições normais de abastecimento de água, mostraram que a quantidade de ar na água medida pelos hidrômetros é comparável àquela encontrada na água no meio ambiente. Por outro lado, os resultados dos experimentos com abastecimento de água, logo após esvaziamento da rede interligada ao ramal predial, revelou que o volume de água que chega ao reservatório calibrado está compreendido entre 4 e 9 % do total do volume ar-água registrado pelo hidrômetro, para os experimentos efetuados no intervalo de tempo de teste de 180 s e pressão de 10 mca. Para o mesmo intervalo de tempo, porém com a pressão de 50 mca, o volume de água varia entre 6 e 21 % do volume total registrado pelo hidrômetro. Aumentando-se o intervalo de tempo para 300 s, e mantendo a pressão em 10 mca, o volume de água que efetivamente chega ao reservatório calibrado situa-se entre 7 e 20 % do volume total registrado pelo hidrômetro. Estes resultados evidenciam os erros cometidos pelo hidrômetro ao medir o escoamento bifásico ar e água. Para avaliar a eficiência de aparelhos destinados a reduzir o volume de ar nos ramais prediais, três dispositivos utilizados para reduzir o ar transportado junto com a água foram testados: eliminador de ar, bloqueador de ar e ventosa. Dentre as válvulas testadas, o eliminador de ar apresentou melhor desempenho, em termos de eficiência na retirada de ar, principalmente para as menores vazões. Já o bloqueador de ar, além de possuir desempenho {{inferior}} ao eliminador de ar testado, ao bloquear o ar transportado pela rede de abastecimento pode contribuir para que os bolsões de ar contidos no ramal predial retornem à rede de abastecimento, influenciando assim, no registro de ar por uma outra estrutura de medição próxima. Em relação aos outros aparelhos testados, a ventosa apresentou desempenho inferior ao bloqueador de ar e muito inferior ao desempenho do eliminador de ar. The {{purpose of}} the present work is to evaluate the volume of air measured in domestic water supply pipe connections. It is a current problem as shown by a series of suits running in courts in several cities questioning that the amounts charged by the water supply companies might have been increased by air in the water distribution network. Due to the high level of interest generated by the matter, the present work will try to clarify some conflicting points through essays performed in a hydraulic laboratory counter which simulates a part of a distribution pipe connected to a domestic water supply pipe. Additionally, tests were performed to evaluate the efficiency and applicability of air reducing valves in domestic water supply connections, once the Act 12645 / 97 allows Minas Gerais water consumers to have the installation of such equipment. In addition to the evaluation of such devices, the efficiency of air release valves was checked, installed upstream the domestic water supply pipe at the highest point of the water supply network. The results obtained under regular water supply conditions showed that the quantity of air in the water measured by the hydrometers is comparable to the one found in the environment water. On the other hand, the water supply, right after emptying the network connected to the domestic water supply pipe, revealed that the volume of water which gets to the gauged reservoir, comprehends 4 % and 9 % of the total air-water volume recorded by the hydrometer for the experiments performed in the test time interval of 180 seconds and a 10 mca pressure. For the same time interval, despite the 50 mca pressure, the volume of water varies from 6 % to 21 % of the total volume recorded by the hydrometer. By increasing the time interval to 300 seconds, and keeping the pressure at 10 mca, the volume of water that effectively gets to the gauged reservoir is between 7 % and 20 % of the total volume recorded by the hydrometer. Such results show clearly the mistakes made by the hydrometer when measuring the twophase outflow of water and air. In order to evaluate the efficiency of the apparatus aimed at reducing the volume of air in the domestic water supply, three devices used to reduce the air carried along with the water were tested: air eliminator, air blocker and <b>air</b> <b>release</b> <b>valve.</b> Among the valves tested, the air eliminator presented the best performance in terms of efficiency in the air withdrawal, especially for the smallest outflow. As to the air blocker, in addition to having a lower performance compared to the tested air eliminator, when blocking the air carried by the water supply network it can contribute so as the water pockets contained in the domestic water supply pipe return to the water supply network, therefore influencing in the air registration through another measuring structure next to it. Concerning the other apparatus tested, the <b>air</b> <b>release</b> <b>valve</b> has lower performance than the air blocker and a lot lower than the air eliminator performance. As to the apparatus tested air eliminator, for discharges lower than 0. 18 m 3 /h, the efficiency was 91 % and 99 % for pressures 0. 5 MPa and 0. 1 MPa, respectively. The results also revealed that the hydrometer, even after being specified adequately for the consumption measured, in the presence of air, may operate out of the recommended range, causing its mechanism to wear down and mistakes higher than 5 %. The results obtained cannot be generalized for water supply systems and it is still important to take into account that the volume of air measured in the experiments is peculiar of the tests bench. Therefore, as to the water supply networks, the volume of water carried into the water supply network will depend on the diameter and the pipes length and on the existence or not of devices aimed at eliminating the air out of such networks...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to update earlier studies of Keetmanshoop’s water distribution and to evaluate the performance of Keetmanshoop’s water distribution network and water sector. This includes data such as the level of non-revenue water, pressures in the pipelines and network’s appurtenances. The aim is also to model Keetmanshoop’s water distribution network, and to simulate its performance for different outputs, such as maximum and minimum pressure and net flow. The model would then be used and updated by Keetmanshoop Municipality. Finally, the last objective is to present improvements to Keetmanshoop’s water distribution. The materials and methods used in this study were a literature survey, primarily of the previous studies, semi-structured interviews, observations and conversations, field measurements and Keetmanshoop Municipality’s accounting. The research was mainly conducted in Keetmanshoop in June and July 2015. Moreover, the water distribution network model was constructed with WaterCAD, QGIS and FCGnet software. The minimum pressure of 200 kPa in the whole network isn’t achieved, thus the southern part of the network suffers from excessive pressure. The frequency of pipe breakages is high and indicates the network to be in a poor condition. Pipe breakages mainly occur from the old age of the pipe network, high pressure and lack of <b>air</b> <b>release</b> <b>valves.</b> The level of non-revenue water is 18. 0 %, which is below the 20 %, the main target of this EU funded project. However, it should be higher due to the factors such as the overflowing of the municipality’s reservoirs and high frequency of pipe breakages. These factors also indicate that the municipality’s accounting of billed water is faulty. The water distribution network model doesn’t reliably replicate the actual network. There are many reasons for this, such as the complexity of water demand in the actual network and faulty map elements that the model was based on. The model is still approximate and indicates the performance of the actual network and some problematic areas, e. g. the southern part of the town where the pressure is excessive. Keetmanshoop’s water distribution can be improved in many ways. For instance, the 350 inactive water meters should be replaced and new gate valves, pressure reducing <b>valves</b> and <b>air</b> <b>release</b> <b>valves</b> are needed. The old asbestos cement pipes should be replaced with new plastic (uPVC) pipes as soon as possible. The municipality’s reservoirs need to be protected, isolated and improved, and the use of Oxpass Hill reservoir is questionable. It dampens the pressure in the southwestern part of the network, overflows frequently and doesn’t provide notable extra storage...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} an experimental programme on the dynamic behaviour of air valves {{performed in a}} large-scale pipeline apparatus. Dynamic flow tests were performed at large (full) scale, since previous quasi-steady flow tests at small scale {{did not lead to}} realistic results. Investigations in a large-scale pipeline apparatus lead {{to a better understanding of}} the physical processes associated with the dynamic performance of air valves. Float type air valves of nominal diameter of 50 and 100 mm were tested in geometrically similar 200 and 500 mm test sections, to allow for the assessment of dynamic scale effects and the development of dimensionless parameter groups and dynamic scale laws. The approach in the determination of the dynamic performance of air valves was to measure their response to flow acceleration/ decelerations, which are imposed upon the valve. In this way, the air valve behaviour following events like system start-up, pump trip and pipe rupture is simulated. Key results of the dynamic flow tests, including <b>air</b> <b>release</b> tests (<b>valve</b> slam) and column separation tests (effect of air valve on surge suppression), are presented and discussed...|$|R
40|$|Core {{flooding}} is {{a commonly}} used experimental procedure in the petroleum industry. It involves pressurizing a reservoir rock and flowing fluid through {{it in the}} laboratory. The cylindrical rock, called a core, can be cut from the reservoir during a separate core drilling operation or a formation outcrop. A core flooding apparatus suitable for matrix acidizing was designed and assembled. Matrix acidizing is a stimulation technique in which hydrochloric acid (HCl) is injected down the wellbore below formation fracture pressure to dissolve carbonate (CaCO 3) rock creating high permeability streaks called wormholes. The main components of the apparatus include a continuous flow syringe pump, three core holders, a hydraulic hand pump, two accumulators, a back pressure regulator, and two pressure transducers connected {{through a series of}} tubing and valves. Due to the corrosive nature of the acid, the apparatus features Hastelloy which is a corrosion resistant metal alloy. Another substantial feature of the apparatus is the ability to apply 3000 psi back pressure. This is the pressure necessary to keep CO 2, a product of the CaCO 3 and HCl reaction, in solution at elevated temperatures. To perform experiments at temperature, the core holder is wrapped with heating tape and surrounded by insulation. Tubing is wrapped around a heating band with insulation to heat the fluid before it enters the core. A LabVIEW graphical programming code was written to control heaters as well as record temperature and pressure drop across the core. Other considerations for the design include minimizing footprint, operational ease by the user, vertical placement of the accumulators and core holders to minimize gravity effects, and <b>air</b> <b>release</b> <b>valves.</b> Core floods can be performed at varying injection rates, temperatures and pressures up to 5000 psi and 250 degF. The apparatus can handle small core plugs, 1 ?? diameter X 1 ?? length, up to 4 ?? X 20 ?? cores. The equipment description includes the purpose, relevant features, and connections to the system for each component. Finally documented is the procedure to run a core flooding test to determine permeability and inject acid complete with an analysis of pressure response data...|$|R
50|$|The air {{pressure}} system on a tire changer provides {{the air to}} inflate tires mounted on wheels. The {{air pressure}} system consists of 4 components: air hose, air inflation gauge, inflation pedal and manual pressure bleed valve. The air hose is located {{near the top of}} the tire changer, and it allows compressed air to travel into the tire.

The air inflation gauge displays the air pressure within the tire when the air hose is connected to the valve stem. The air inflation gauge displays the pressure in pounds per square inch (psi). Directly below the air hose on the side of the tire changer is the inflation pedal that enables the inflation of the tire. When the inflation pedal is raised, a burst of <b>air</b> is <b>released</b> from <b>valves</b> next to each rim clamp toward the bottom bead of the tire to help with inflation.

The aim {{of this study was to}} develop a custom made pressure <b>release</b> <b>valve</b> that is suitable for the insufflation devices used for air enema reduction of intussusception and to put this valve into regular clinical practice. Materials and Methods: An adjustable, custom made pressure <b>release</b> <b>valve</b> was assembled by the authors using readily available components. The valve was coupled to a simple air enema insufflation device. The device was used for the trial of reduction of intussusception in a prospective study that included 132 patients. Results: The success rate for air enema reduction with the new device was 88. 2 %. The mean pressure required to achieve complete reduction was 100 mmHg. The insufflation pressure never exceeded the preset value (120 mmHg). Of the successful cases, 58. 3 % were reduced from the first attempt while 36. 1 % required a second insufflation. Only 5. 55 % required a third insufflation to complete the reduction. In cases with unsuccessful pneumatic reduction attempt (18. 1 %), surgical treatment was required. Surgery ranged from simple reduction to resection with a primary end to end anastomosis. No complications from air enema were recorded.
