40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} with understanding the degradation of electrical and electronic components in automobiles due to environmental effects. A special {{emphasis is placed on}} understanding the physical processes underlying the degradation, so that accelerated reliability tests can be specified with increased confidence of their validity. <b>As</b> <b>a</b> <b>first</b> case,printed <b>circuit</b> <b>board</b> (PCB) insulation was selected as a target for investigation. With an increase in the electronics and circuit miniaturization coupled with an increase in voltage in 42 volt as well as hybrid vehicles, PCB reliability has become an important issue. We <b>first</b> provide <b>a</b> broad presentation of insulation degradation theory as well as electrical conduction theory according to existing literature and then narrow our focus towards printed <b>circuit</b> <b>board</b> insulation. We develop a novel first-order mathematical model to describe electrical currents in printed <b>circuit</b> <b>board</b> insulation as a function of temperature, relative humidity, absorbed moisture content, voltage and geometrical characteristics. This model was developed from a series of experiments that were carefully performed under controlled laboratory conditions. In addition to describing the experimental procedure and results, we also explain the details of the experimental setup and measurement instrumentation. Furthermore, we present an intuitive physical explanations for some observations and model responses. by Vasanth Sarathy. Thesis (S. M.)

40|$|Electrical {{components}} are {{the building blocks}} of any electronics. These building blocks when intelligently assembled, form circuits that enforce the electronic to behave in the manner the designer intended. Therefore any error such as defective components and assembly errors will cause the end product to have anomalies.

This translate to finer integrated circuits (more components placed and packed in the same area as it previous would), and thus testing <b>circuit</b> <b>boards</b> manually may no longer be feasible.

50|$|Perhaps {{the most}} common and general such theorem is Lorentz {{reciprocity}} (and its various special cases such as Rayleigh-Carson reciprocity), named after work by Hendrik Lorentz in 1896 following analogous results regarding sound by Lord Rayleigh and light by Helmholtz (Potton, 2004). Loosely, it states that the relationship between an oscillating current and the resulting electric field is unchanged if one interchanges the points where the current is placed and where the field is measured. For the specific case of an electrical network, it is sometimes phrased as the statement that voltages and currents at different points in the network can be interchanged.
