5|$|In {{his first}} full term in Congress, Jennings stepped up his attacks on Harrison, accusing him of using his office for {{personal}} gain, of taking part in questionable land speculation deals, and needlessly raising tensions with the Native American tribes on the frontier. Jennings presented a congressional resolution that intended to reduce Harrison's authority to make political appointments and opposed his policy of purchasing lands from the Indians. When Harrison was up for reappointment as territorial governor in 1810, Jennings sent <b>a</b> <b>scathing</b> letter to President James Madison that argued against his reappointment. Harrison's allies in Washington argued on his behalf and aided in securing his reappointment.|$|E
5|$|The Killers' second album, Sam's Town, was {{released}} in October 2006 under Island Def Jam Music Group. It received a varied response with some critics praising the album {{and the evolution of}} the band and others criticizing and mocking it, most notably it received <b>a</b> <b>scathing</b> review from Rolling Stone. The album sold over 706,000 copies worldwide {{in the first week of}} release, reaching number two on the US Billboard chart and number one on the UK chart. The record has since been certified 5x Platinum in the United Kingdom, 4x Platinum in Ireland, 2x Platinum in Australia, Canada and New Zealand, Platinum in the United States and Gold in Argentina, Belgium, Germany and Russia.|$|E
5|$|Animals is {{the tenth}} studio album by the English rock band Pink Floyd, {{released}} on 23 January 1977 by Harvest Records in the United Kingdom and by Columbia Records in the United States. It {{is a concept}} album that provides <b>a</b> <b>scathing</b> critique of the social-political conditions of late-1970s Britain, and presents a marked change in musical style from their earlier work. Animals was recorded at the band's studio, Britannia Row, in London, but its production was punctuated by the early signs of discord that three years later would culminate in keyboardist Richard Wright leaving the band. The album's cover image, a pig floating between two chimneys of the Battersea Power Station, was conceived by the band's bassist and lead songwriter Roger Waters, and was designed by long-time collaborator Storm Thorgerson of Hipgnosis.|$|E

50|$|Surrounding {{this are}} two prefaces. The Second Preface {{describes}} the quest {{of a former}} writer of UFO books to discover a true manuscript of The Boomer Bible. The First Preface is <b>a</b> rather <b>scathing</b> review of the book.|$|R
5|$|At {{the same}} time, Quisling {{believed}} {{that the only way}} he could win back Hitler's respect would be to raise volunteers for the now-faltering German war effort, and he committed Norway wholeheartedly to German plans to wage total war. For him at least, after the German defeat at Stalingrad in February 1943, Norway now had a part to play in keeping the German empire strong. In April 1943, Quisling delivered <b>a</b> <b>scathing</b> speech attacking Germany's refusal to outline its plans for post-war Europe. When he put this to Hitler in person, the Nazi leader remained unmoved despite Norway's contributions to the war effort. Quisling felt betrayed over this postponement of Norwegian freedom, an attitude that waned only when Hitler eventually committed to a free post-war Norway in September 1943.|$|E
5|$|Elmer {{recounts the}} initial violent {{backlash}} by humanity and how Ben hid {{the three of}} them from groups out to kill chickens. This is followed by retaliation against humans by chickens, chicken-rights groups, and eventually recognition of chickens as humans by the United Nations. During this time, Elmer becomes a syndicated columnist in a newspaper and writes about chicken-related topics, both light-hearted and serious. The peace between humans and chickens is disrupted in the late 1980s by an outbreak of bird flu. Millions of healthy chickens are killed by humans {{to prevent the spread of}} the disease, and Ben hides Elmer and Helen again. When others come for them, Ben intervenes and is accidentally shot protecting Elmer. Once the flu is contained, humanity expresses regret for its rash actions and Elmer writes <b>a</b> <b>scathing</b> editorial about the panic. His journal entries become less frequent after he and Helen have children.|$|E
5|$|In June 2011, after pinning WWE Champion John Cena on Raw, Rey Mysterio at Capitol Punishment {{and finally}} Alberto Del Rio {{again in a}} contendership match (which also {{included}} Mysterio) all within one week, Punk revealed his contract would expire at Money in the Bank and vowed to leave the company with the WWE Championship. After making <b>a</b> <b>scathing</b> yet highly acclaimed on-air speech concerning {{the way in which}} WWE is run and its owner Vince McMahon, he was given a storyline suspension from televised WWE events but was reinstated the following week on Cena's insistence. Upon his return, Punk ceased to appear with the remaining members of Nexus and the group quietly dissolved that month. This helped transition him from a villainous character back to being a fan-favorite. Two weeks later, at Money in the Bank, Punk defeated John Cena to become the WWE Champion on his final night under contract with WWE.|$|E

5|$|The American group wrote <b>a</b> <b>scathing</b> {{response}} {{to the findings of}} the TWG, stating that they had given too much emphasis on the results from the Dubna group. In particular they pointed out that the Russian group had altered the details of their claims several times over a period of 20 years, a fact that the Russian team does not deny. They also stressed that the TWG had given too much credence to the chemistry experiments performed by the Russians and accused the TWG of not having appropriately qualified personnel on the committee. The TWG responded by saying that {{this was not the case}} and having assessed each point raised by the American group said that they found no reason to alter their conclusion regarding priority of discovery. The IUPAC finally used the name suggested by the American team (rutherfordium) which may in some way reflect a change of opinion.|$|E
5|$|The President {{was coming}} into {{increasing}} conflict with Congress on {{the handling of}} the Zone, including the unusual consolidation of power. In addition to not officially restructuring the Commission, Congress increasingly fought or raised questions about the appointments of replacement commissioners. In November 1905, Panama was visited by Poultney Bigelow, a lecturer and writer for the American Geographical Society, who wrote <b>a</b> <b>scathing</b> report on progress in the Canal Zone—a report that was well-publicized in the States. This report criticized the efficiency of the work being performed as well as the quality of its management. Magoon countered this negative press by stressing that Bigelow had visited the Zone for less than two days, one of which was Thanksgiving Day, and that work was naturally lax on the holiday.|$|E
5|$|The debacle at Kasserine Pass {{strained}} {{relations between}} the Allies, and another crisis developed when II Corps reported that enemy aviation was operating at will over its sector because of an absence of Allied air cover. This elicited <b>a</b> <b>scathing</b> response from British Air Marshal Arthur Coningham on the competence of American troops. Eisenhower drafted a letter to Marshall suggesting that Coningham should be relieved of his command since he could not control the acrimony between senior Allied commanders, but Smith persuaded him not to send it. Instead, Air Chief Marshal Arthur Tedder, Major General Carl Spaatz, and Brigadier General Laurence S. Kuter paid Patton a visit at his headquarters. Their meeting {{was interrupted by a}} German air raid that convinced the airmen that General Patton had a point. Coningham withdrew his written criticisms and he apologized.|$|E
5000|$|A {{columnist}} for The Telegraph , however, gave it <b>a</b> rather <b>scathing</b> review calling the novel [...] "swollen", [...] "encyclopedic" [...] and saying further that [...] "character and plot are blithely sacrificed {{on the altar}} of trivia with every turn of the page." ...|$|R

25|$|The book {{is noted}} for its {{colorful}} description of people and places along the Mississippi River.

5|$|Arriving at Batavia in the {{aftermath}} of the engagement, Linois was the subject of criticism from the Dutch governors for his failure to defeat the China convoy. They also refused his requests to make use of the Dutch squadron stationed in port for future operations. Rejoined by Atalante, Linois sold two captured country ships and resupplied his squadron, before sailing for Isle de France, Marengo arriving on 2 April. During the return journey, Linois had detached his frigates and they captured a number of valuable merchant ships sailing independently before joining the admiral at Port Louis, which Decaen had renamed Port Napoleon. On his arrival, Linois was questioned by Decaen about the engagement with the China Fleet and when Decaen found his answers unsatisfactory the governor wrote <b>a</b> <b>scathing</b> letter to Napoleon, which he despatched to France on Berceau. Linois remained at Isle de France for the next two and a half months, eventually departing with Marengo, Atalante and Sémillante in late June, while Belle Poule was detached to cruise independently.|$|E
5|$|Coinciding {{with the}} release of his Letters and Speeches of Oliver Cromwell in 1845, Thomas Carlyle was asked to view the head. He did not, and {{on the basis of a}} friend's visit, wrote <b>a</b> <b>scathing</b> {{dismissal}} of the authenticity of the head: “it has hair, flesh and beard, a written history bearing that it was procured for £100 (I think of bad debt) about 50 years ago...the whole affair appears to be fraudulent moonshine, an element not pleasant even to glance into, especially in a case like Oliver's.” Fitzgibbons 2008, Pearson and Morant agree that Carlyle's dismissal was not based on any historical or scientific fact. Although Carlyle conceded that it was “the head of some decapitated man of distinction”, the only other known man of distinction to be embalmed and then decapitated in such a manner over the previous 200 years was Henry Ireton. George Rolleston had conducted an examination on another skull—called the Ashmolean skull—after claims that it was Cromwell's head. Rolleston was unconvinced by the skull's supposed history, and visited Wilkinson's home to see the skull shortly afterwards. After an examination, he dismissed the Ashmolean skull as a fake and declared that the Wilkinson head was the real head of Cromwell.|$|E
5|$|Joe Kinnear took Luton {{back up at}} {{the first}} time of asking, but was sacked by the club's new owners {{following}} a takeover in May 2003. Mike Newell was appointed as manager, and his side became League One champions in 2004–05. Internal troubles at the club started to intensify {{during the summer of}} 2006, as the club's chairman was revealed by Newell to be making illegal payments to agents—after writing <b>a</b> <b>scathing</b> letter to the board, Newell was sacked in March 2007. Kevin Blackwell was appointed in his stead, but was also sacked {{less than a year later}} on 16 January 2008; former player Mick Harford was made Luton Town's new manager the same day, and he was unable to prevent the club's relegation in 2007–08. After being deducted a total of 30 points by The Football League and The Football Association for 2008–09, Luton were relegated to the Conference Premier; however, the club claimed a Football League Trophy victory during the same season. After two months of the 2009–10 season, Harford left the club by mutual consent, to be replaced a month later by Richard Money. Money's assistant, Gary Brabin, replaced him in March 2011, and managed the club until he was sacked a year later. His replacement, Paul Buckle, took charge in April 2012, and was himself replaced in February 2013 by John Still. Still took Luton back into The Football League in his first full season as manager, breaking a number of club records in the process. Still guided Luton to a comfortable finish in their first season back in League Two, but was sacked by the club in December 2015 following a poor run of form. He was replaced by Nathan Jones in January 2016, who took on his first ever managerial role.|$|E
