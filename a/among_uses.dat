40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the relationship between}} diversification and predation, focusing on the firm's investments in sunk cost assets. Unlike the single product firm, the diversified firm may employ assets that are not sunk to a product. The ability to transfer these assets <b>among</b> <b>uses</b> or locations may lower the costs of predation. The "long-purse" and "multimarket reputation" {{may be viewed as}} special cases of this phenomenon. The likelihood of predation may be reduced when the diversified firm is the target, since it may be able to transfer assets back into an industry when the predator raises the price.

40|$|Water {{supplies}} in Yemen are depleted in an unsustainable manner because of increasing demand from a fast growing population and an expanding agricultural sector. Political efforts should ensure {{a more efficient}} allocation of the scarce resource <b>among</b> <b>uses</b> and users, but little information is available about the likely effects of policy changes on farmers ’ attitudes and practices. This paper shows how an economically based agriculture sector model was combined with a hydrological model {{to serve as an}} analytical and planning instrument. The model is based on micro-level data collected during the 1997 / 98 agricultural season in the delta of Wadi Tuban, located near Aden (13 °N. 45 °E.) and was established using the GAMS-Software package (General Algebraic Modelling System) ...|$|E
40|$|Water {{trading in}} Australia is enabled by much {{historical}} institutional development, which had other objectives {{at the time}} that it was implemented. After 2 decades of institutional reform to enable water markets in the Murray Darling Basin, active markets are reallocating surface water entitlements among irrigation users. However, permanent water trading is currently limited in terms of the volume traded and reallocation <b>among</b> <b>uses.</b> Given these limitations, this paper seeks to assess the success of surface water markets in the Murray-Darling Basin by comparing current practice against the six desirable characteristics for water markets suggested by Howe et al. (1986). Overall, it is argued that, despite the relatively low rate of reallocation, the market performs well against most criteria but that ongoing evolution of institutional arrangements is critical for improved success...|$|E
40|$|Inadequate {{growth in}} food {{production}} and increasingly scarce water pose serious constraints to food security and future {{economic development in}} Southern Africa. ' Much of the region is semi-arid or arid, so that irrigation is required to stabilize or increase agricultural production. The serious droughts {{of the past decade}} have shown how important is the role of controlled water supplies for food security at the local, national, and regional levels. But agricultural water use cannot be developed in isolation; it must be balanced with the increasing water demands for domestic, industrial, livestock, and even environmental uses. Nor can any country balance its own water resources in isolation, because the rivers of the region are intricately interlaced across national boundaries. This situation calls for serious attention to the allocation of water <b>among</b> <b>uses</b> and users. Book chapterNon-PRIFPRI...|$|E

40|$|The Biomass Scenario Model (BSM) is {{a system}} {{dynamics}} model developed by the U. S.

However, it does not currently have the capability to account for allocation of biomass resources among the various end uses, which limits its utilization in analysis of policies that target biomass uses outside the biofuels industry. This report provides a more holistic understanding of the dynamics surrounding the allocation of biomass <b>among</b> <b>uses</b> that include traditional use, wood pellet exports, bio-based products and bioproducts, biopower, and biofuels by (1) highlighting the methods used in existing models' treatments of competition for biomass resources; (2) identifying coverage and gaps in industry data regarding the competing end uses; and (3) exploring options for developing models of biomass allocation that could be integrated with the BSM to actively exchange and incorporate relevant information...|$|E
40|$|The Common Device Interface (CDI) * is {{a popular}} device layer in TINE control systems**. Indeed, a de-facto device server (more {{specifically}} a 'property server') can be instantiated merely by supplying a hardware address database, somewhat reminiscent of an epics IOC. It has in fact become quite popular <b>among</b> <b>uses</b> to do precisely this, although the original design intent anticipated embedding CDI as a hardware layer within a dedicated device server. When control system client applications and central services communicate directly to a CDI server, this places the burden of providing useable, viewable data (and in an efficient manner) squarely on CDI and its address database. In its initial release variant, any modifications to this hardware database needed {{to be made on}} the file system used by the CDI device server. In this report we shall describe some of the many new features of CDI release 2. 0, which have drawn on the user/developer experience over the past eight years...|$|E
40|$|The law and {{administration}} of groundwater are critiqued from both legal and economic perspectives. The {{purposes of this}} dissertation are to examine alternative methods of allocating rights to groundwater and to recommend measures for improving the efficiency and equity of allocating those rights. The Arizona and Nebraska experiences in administering rights to groundwater are examined. ^ Groundwater as an economic resource is reviewed, and the externalities arising {{from the use of}} groundwater are discussed. Alternative methods for allocating groundwater <b>among</b> <b>uses,</b> and users, and over time are analyzed. Those allocative methods include (a) judicial allocation by enforcement of common-law doctrines, (b) political allocation by imposition of permit systems, (c) involuntary transfers of rights to groundwater by condemnation or prescription, (d) taxation of groundwater use, (e) market allocation through the sale of rights to groundwater, and (f) voluntary agreements. The groundwater law {{and administration}} in Arizona and Nebraska are critiqued and compared. A proposal for improving the administration of rights to groundwater is presented. ...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a conceptual framework}} for water accounting and provides generic terminologies and procedures to describe the status of water resource use and consequences of water resources related actions. The framework applies to water resource use at three levels of analysis: a use level such as an irrigated field or household, a service level such as an irrigation or water supply system, and a water basin level that may include several uses. Water accounting terminology and performance indicators are developed and presented with examples at all the three levels. Concepts and terminologies presented are developed to be supportive {{in a number of}} activities including: identification of opportunities for water savings and increasing water productivity; developing a better understanding of present patterns of water use and impacts of interventions; improving communication among professionals and communication to non-water professionals; and improving the rationale for allocation of water <b>among</b> <b>uses.</b> It is expected that with further application, these water accounting concepts will evolve into a robust, supporting methodology for water basin analysis.

40|$|The radio {{spectrum}} {{is a major}} component of the telecommunications infrastructure that underpins the information society. Spectrum management, however, has not kept up with major changes in technology, business practice, and economic policy during the past two decades. Traditional spectrum management practice is predicated on the spectrum being a limited resource that must be apportioned <b>among</b> <b>uses</b> and users by government administration. For many years this model worked well, but more recently the spectrum has come under pressure from rapid demand growth for wireless services and changing patterns of use. This has led to growing technical and economic inefficiencies, as well as obstacles to technological innovation. Two alternative approaches are being tried, one driven by the market (spectrum property rights) and another driven by technology innovation (commons). Practical solutions are evolving that combine some features of both. Wholesale replacement of current practice is unlikely, but the balance between administration, property rights, and commons is clearly shifting. Although the debate on spectrum management reform is mainly taking place in high-income countries, it is deeply relevant to developing countries as well.
