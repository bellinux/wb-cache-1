40|$|Much {{has been}} made of the need to {{undertake}} field testing on proprietary devices to suit localAustralian conditions. The Water by Design MUSIC Modelling Guidelines instruct <b>assessing</b> <b>authorities</b> not to accept models unless the removal efficiencies are justified by rigorous scientific testing and published in credible scientific journals. Yet the guidelines stop short of providing a protocol for acceptable rigorous, scientific testing. For new entrants and existing vendors, this creates a significant cost-benefit issue with no certainty that field test results will be accepted by <b>assessing</b> <b>authorities.</b> The StormWater Equipment Manufacturers Association (SWEMA) in the United States jointly developed a protocol that has been accepted by <b>assessing</b> <b>authorities</b> there. Auckland Regional Council has also developed guidelines that provide a detailed process for vendors wishing to verify removal efficiencies of proprietary stormwater treatment devices. This paper discusses these international protocols and the protocol developed in collaboration with several Universities in south-east Queensland to provide robust, rigorous and defendable performance testing research results for several different proprietary SQIDS. It provides examples of test sites where the protocol is currently being applied in Australia. The arguments for and against field and laboratory testing are considered. The paper concludes with a methodology for <b>assessing</b> <b>authorities</b> to verify that field test data is scientifically robust and statistically valid...|$|R

After the completion of postgraduate study, a student is deemed competent to take the professional practice examination. Success in this examination qualifies a student to be registered as an architect. The competency rating of future professionals in architectural schools in Nigeria is determined through a jury system of scoring based on predetermined grading parameters. However, the grading parameters adopted by <b>assessing</b> <b>authorities</b> (academic professors and practitioners representing the professional body) differ. The difference in the grading parameters employed by the two approved <b>assessing</b> <b>authorities</b> in Nigeria was investigated in this study. Covenant University in Nigeria {{was used as a}} case study. The grading parameters and scores for the 2013 academic session were compared to determine similarities and differences, which might have affected the competency rating of students. Descriptive statistics was employed to analyze the data obtained. Results showed a significant difference in scoring by the two authorities. This difference had a significant consequence on the competency rating of students...|$|R
50|$|The Australian {{government}} evaluates foreign credentials {{depending on}} {{the reason for the}} evaluation. For example, if an evaluation is needed only for immigration purposes the Department of Immigration and Border Protection will assess qualifications. There are designated <b>assessing</b> <b>authorities</b> for specific professions, such as the Australian Institute For Teaching and School Leadership which assesses credentials for school teacher occupations. For most other credential assessments, Overseas Qualifications Units were established in most Australian states and territories to evaluate foreign credentials. The Department of Education and Training can also assess credentials for foreign-born residents of New South Wales and credentials for occupations that do not require registration, licensing, or professional membership.|$|R

40|$|Biodiversity {{has become}} a central concern in {{environmental}} management. As such, {{it is crucial that}} it is included and fully considered in environmental impact assessment (EIA). This paper explores the definitions and perceptions of biodiversity, and the associated management implications, held by those involved in preparing and assessing EIA documents in Western Australia. This State has world-recognised biodiversity values and comprehensive impact assessment processes. These practitioners defined biodiversity in a range of ways from a very basic through to a sophisticated, extended definition. A range of approaches to its assessment was also evident. The most sophisticated practitioners placed biodiversity in its spatial and temporal context as well as being cognizant of community aspirations and the principle of net conservation benefit. The ability to properly consider biodiversity in EIA is dependent on good information, not only on flora and fauna but also on the concepts and processes associated with biodiversity. Clear policy directions, from the <b>assessing</b> <b>authority,</b> regarding the level and detail of assessment required, are also critical...|$|E

40|$|This {{paper offers}} a vantage point {{through which to}} assess the {{phenomenon}} of projects codifying private law that are undertaken by private persons or institutions, distinct from legislatures and state-sponsored codification and law-revision projects. The private institution on which this paper focuses is the American Law Institute (ALI). ALI works in statutory form‚Äîmost notably the Uniform Commercial Code and the Model Penal Code‚Äîas well as through projects that generate ‚ÄúPrinciples ‚Äù to guide legal development within their specific fields and ‚ÄúRestatements‚Äù that authoritatively cover the law in a field. The history of the Restatements sketched in this essay fits within the prototype of Searching for Utopia with which the paper begins. Although the Restatements do not control their subsequent reception by courts, at times Restatements succeed in anticipating legal development. This paper also demonstrates that ambiguity accompanies the underlying terminology of authority and, for that matter, private law. Finally, and for many reasons, contemporary Restatements speak {{to an audience of}} disbelief in the existence of one common law that exists autonomously of invading influences, including statutes. How to <b>assess</b> <b>authority,</b> influence, and success for a Restatement are more interesting question...|$|R

40|$|This essay {{illustrates}} how {{our interest in}} questions of constitutional doctrine {{makes it difficult to}} assess structural arguments about judicial authority. In the past forty years, we have witnessed a shift in American constitutional theory. Scholars once <b>assessed</b> judicial <b>authority</b> based on their expectations of how judges should decide cases. In time, many concluded that discretion is an inevitable consequence of constitutional interpretation and therefore sought to justify such authority. This shift has led some scholars to give greater emphasis to structural arguments. They identify institutional virtues that explain the judiciary‚Äôs role in a well ordered government. Although these scholars are less concerned than their predecessors with how judges should interpret the Constitution, many retain the doctrinal focus of the earlier generation. This essay identifies problems that follow from this focus. Section I traces the evolution in Ronald Dworkin‚Äôs approach to questions of judicial authority. Dworkin‚Äôs work provides a notable example of how doctrinal claims become entangled with structural arguments and confuse our assessment of judicial authority. Section II contrasts Dworkin with scholars who have made claims in which the doctrinal and structural aspects are more readily distinguished. Section III examines the First Things Symposium, in which prominent conservative scholars attack the kind of judicial activism that Dworkin justifies. But the Symposiasts <b>assess</b> judicial <b>authority</b> from the same doctrinal perspective as Dworkin and provide a vivid illustration of how doctrinal controversies obscure structural arguments. Section IV concludes the essay by examining implications this analysis has for debates in constitutional theory...|$|R

40|$|Following the Evangelical Awakening, {{many of the}} Nonconformist traditions {{experienced}} an evolution in their ecclesiastical structure, resulting {{in the formation of}} new associations that frequently acted to establish pragmatic agencies like missionary societies, educational boards and social charities. The transition required new expressions of authority. Understanding the nature of this authority is the chief objective of this study. Chapter One introduces the various themes and goals of the study. Chapter Two explores the Hampshire Congregational Union. In addition to the Union‚Äôs structure, David Bogue and the Gosport Academy were central to this group‚Äôs identity. Chapter Three focuses on the Lancashire Congregational Union in the North West of England, home to William Roby, the central figure within Lancashire Congregationalism. Chapter Four covers the Lancashire and Yorkshire Baptist Association and the later Lancashire and Cheshire Baptist Association, where John Fawcett was the primary influence. The New Connexion of General Baptists, Chapter Five, was under the authoritative direction of Dan Taylor, a former Methodist and a zealous evangelist. Chapter Six analyses the Scotch Baptists. Peculiar among Baptists, it was created under the leadership of Archibald McLean. The British Churches of Christ, Chapter Seven, closely resembled the Scotch Baptists but were different in some fundamental ways. Finally, in Chapter Eight, patterns of associational authority among these associations will be compared and <b>assessed.</b> <b>Authority</b> among Nonconformist associations, particularly those denominations practising congregational polity, was exercised on the grounds of doctrinal purity and evangelistic expansion. As the nineteenth century continued, the organisational structures grew more complex. In turn, increased control was voluntarily granted to the organisations‚Äô governing bodies so they might more efficiently minister. Following the Awakening, these voluntary bodies found new life as a pragmatic expression of Evangelical zeal...|$|R
