5000|$|Colfer's first TV role came in 2009 when he {{was cast}} as Kurt Hummel on Fox's Glee. Kurt is a fashionable gay countertenor who is {{routinely}} bullied at school, not only for being gay, but also for {{being part of the}} very unpopular Glee Club. Colfer auditioned for the part of Artie Abrams, who uses a wheelchair, a role which eventually went to Kevin McHale. The show's creator, Ryan Murphy, was so impressed with Colfer that he created the role of Kurt specifically for him, and in the process, scrapped a planned character called Rajish so they could add Kurt. Murphy explained in the season two finale of the Glee Project that Colfer was the inspiration for the project show because he didn't fit the role he auditioned for but was still [...] "incredible and special" [...] so a role was created for him.In a 2010 interview with Allison Kugel, Colfer stated that:There have been a couple of times when I have gone to Ryan Murphy and told him <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> have happened to me, and then he writes it into the show.

The film opened to {{extremely}} positive reviews and has become a huge success at the box office. Malini Mannath from The New Indian Express in her review wrote: [...] "It’s laudable that the actor doesn’t hesitate to take a role that has him playing a 40-year-old man, greying and with a paunch". The Times of India reviewer N. Venkateswaran cited that [...] "His knack of choosing good roles and working with new directors brimming with ideas will stand him in good stead, as also the work he puts in to portray each character. He put on weight and grew a beard to play Das, and the look fits him to a 'T'". His next release was Idharkuthane Aasaipattai Balakumara, directed by Gokul. It was met with positive reviews by critics and Vijay Sethupathi's performance was highly praised. Haricharan Pudipeddi from The New Indian Express in his review wrote : [...] "Vijay Sethupathi has become a darling of the masses. Scene after scene, the audience hoots and cheers for him in unison." [...] Rediff reviewer S.Saraswathi cited that [...] "His greatest strength lies in being able to counter the stereotypical image of heroes in commercial cinema today. In every film, we see him in a completely different avatar, and his latest film is no different. Vijay Sethupathi seems to have the knack of choosing the right role and script and he effortlessly slips into his character as Kumar." [...] Behindwoods stated that Vijay Sethupathi as Sumar Moonji Kumar has done it yet again, raising his pennant higher, making himself more visible to his fervent fans. The depth in his innocence and the foolhardiness in his love are <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> stand tall in the character he plays, and Vijay Sethupathi has pulled it off in grand style.

40|$|Coming {{from two}} {{different}} language families, the English language differs very much from Hungarian. The word order, the inflection and the spelling are just <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> can cause bigger or smaller difficulties for Hungarian learners of English. One of the biggest {{differences between the two}} is probably the two language system’s notion of time, in other words, the system of tenses. The Hungarian language has three different tenses – past, present and future. About the number of English tenses there is no general agreement, some claim there are more than ten, others argue that there are just two (past and present), and the rest are just aspects; however, the main point is that since the English language has three extra aspects for each “basic” tense, it adds up to nine aspects we don’t seem to make a distinction between in our language. And as it is known, the most difficult case in language learning is when there is something that exists in the target language, but not in the mother tongue, which means that the English tense system really leaves plenty of room for possible misunderstandings for Hungarian learners.

40|$|The most {{frequent}} used method for joining metal structures together is fusion welding. This method {{has largely been}} developed by experiments, i. e. trial and error. The problem of distortion, residual stresses and reduced strength of a structure in and around a welded joint are a major concern of the welding industry, especially in the aerospace industry where safety and economy are important issues. The objective of this thesis is to develop and evaluate a method for introducing a moving heat source into a FE-model. The heat source {{should be able to}} move along any general 3 D curve. The aim is to facilitate the simulation of welding for complex weld paths and geometries. The basic idea is that the user defines the weld path in a CAD-program with the geometry as basis, then information about the weld path is to be exported to a separate file. This file is processed later in the FE-program by user-defined routines in order to create nodal heat input corresponding to the weld for the finite element model. The aim of this work has in general been fulfilled. The method for welding simulation that can follow any general 3 -D curve as welding path fulfils the expectations perfectly. In the whole process of welding simulation there are <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> must be added or corrected. One of these things is that this model gives no feed-back or verification if the correct amount of energy is given into the model. This may wary due to mesh and geometry changes. To be able to do simulations with adequate results this must of course be attended to. This simplification of the process of modelling welding will contribute to make simulations more commonly used by the industry. Validerat; 20101217 (root...|$|E
