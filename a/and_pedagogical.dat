25|$|After the Volta Associates gave several {{demonstrations in}} the City of Washington, {{businessmen}} from Philadelphia created the American Graphophone Company on March 28, 1887, {{in order to}} produce the machines for the budding phonograph marketplace. The Volta Graphophone Company then merged with American Graphophone, which itself later evolved into Columbia Records (co-founded CBS, and now part of the Sony media empire). Bell's portion of the share exchange at that time had an approximate value of US$200,000 (half of the total received by all of the Associates), $100,000 of which he soon dedicated to the newly formed Volta Bureau's research <b>and</b> <b>pedagogical</b> programs for the deaf.|$|E
25|$|A {{widely used}} Roman character-based writing {{system is the}} Double Vowel system devised by Charles Fiero. Although there is no {{standard}} orthography, the Double Vowel system is used by many Ojibwe language teachers because of its ease of use. A wide range of materials {{have been published in}} this system, including a grammar, dictionaries, collections of texts, <b>and</b> <b>pedagogical</b> grammars. In northern Ontario and Manitoba, Ojibwe is most commonly written using the Cree syllabary, a syllabary originally developed by Methodist missionary James Evans around 1840 in order to write Cree. The syllabic system is based in part on Evans' knowledge of Pitman's shorthand and his prior experience developing a distinctive alphabetic writing system for Ojibwe in southern Ontario.|$|E

25|$|Psychology {{was first}} {{recognized}} as a major subject at the university by Professor Imre Sándor, who realized {{that the study of}} psychology {{is just as important as}} that of pedagogy. Accordingly, on 20 October 1926, he filed his petition to the directors of the university for the establishment of a fundamentally different, modern Department of Pedagogy and Psychology. György Málnási Bartók, the Professor of the Department of Philosophy, was an avid supporter of the petition, since the tuition of Psychology had been the responsibility of his department at that period. In his petition, Imre Sándor listed the following fields and branches as belonging to the new Department's sphere of competence: General Psychology, Developmental Psychology, Psychology of Differences, Education of Backward Children, Psychotechnics, <b>and</b> <b>Pedagogical</b> Somatology.|$|E
25|$|Expansion caused {{controversy}} about Yale's new roles. Noah Porter, moral philosopher, was president from 1871 to 1886. During {{an age of}} tremendous expansion in higher education, Porter resisted {{the rise of the}} new research university, claiming that an eager embrace of its ideals would corrupt undergraduate education. Many of Porter's contemporaries criticized his administration, and historians since have disparaged his leadership. Levesque argues Porter was not a simple-minded reactionary, uncritically committed to tradition, but a principled and selective conservative. He did not endorse everything old or reject everything new; rather, he sought to apply long-established ethical <b>and</b> <b>pedagogical</b> principles to a rapidly changing culture. He may have misunderstood some of the challenges of his time, but he correctly anticipated the enduring tensions that have accompanied the emergence and growth of the modern university.|$|E
25|$|Throughout Dijkstra's career, {{his work}} was {{characterized}} by elegance and economy. A prolific writer (especially as an essayist), Dijkstra authored more than 1,300 papers, many written by hand in his precise script. They were essays and parables; fairy tales and warnings; comprehensive explanation <b>and</b> <b>pedagogical</b> pretext. Most were about mathematics and computer science; others were trip reports that are more revealing about their author than about the people and places visited. It was his habit to copy each paper and circulate it to {{a small group of}} colleagues who would copy and forward the papers to another limited group of scientists. His love affair with simplicity came at an early age and under his mother's guidance. He once said he had asked his mother whether trigonometry was a difficult topic. She replied that he must learn all the formulas and that furthermore if he required more than five lines to prove something, he was on the wrong track.|$|E

Lesser, {{in which he}} {{describes}} the production of Sesame Street, and the formation <b>and</b> <b>pedagogical</b> philosophy of the Children's Television Workshop. [...] Lesser was a professor at Harvard University, studying how social class and ethnicity interacted with school achievement {{and was one of}} the first academics in the US who researched how watching television affected children and their development. [...] He was initially skeptical about the potential of using television as a teaching tool, but he was eventually named as the advisory board chairman of the Children's Television Workshop (CTW), the organization created to oversee the production and research of Sesame Street, and was the show's first educational director. [...] Lesser wrote the book early in Sesame Street's history, to evaluate the show's effectiveness, to explain what its writers, researchers, and producers were attempting to do, and to respond to criticism of Sesame Street.|$|E

500|$|Scholars are, however, {{careful to}} note that except for Benjamin Franklin's works and Joel Barlow's pamphlets, Johnson did not print {{anything}} truly revolutionary. He refused to publish Paine's Rights of Man and William Blake's The French Revolution, for example. It {{is almost impossible to}} determine Johnson's own personal political beliefs from the historical record. Marilyn Gaull argues that [...] "if Johnson were radical, indeed if he had any political affiliation ... it was accidental". Gaull describes Johnson's [...] "liberalism" [...] as that [...] "of [...] generous, open, fair-minded, unbiased defender of causes lost and won". His real contribution, she contends, was [...] "as a disseminator of contemporary knowledge, especially science, medicine, <b>and</b> <b>pedagogical</b> practice" [...] and as an advocate for a popular style. He encouraged all of his writers to use [...] "plain syntax and colloquial diction" [...] so that [...] "self-educated readers" [...] could understand his publications. Johnson's association with writers such as Godwin has previously been used to emphasize his radicalism, but Braithwaite points out that Godwin only became a part of Johnson's Circle late in the 1790s; Johnson's closest friends—Priestley, Fuseli, and Bonnycastle—were much more politically moderate. Johnson was not a populist or democratic bookseller: he catered to the self-educating middle class.|$|E
500|$|While Trimmer {{was highly}} {{respected}} for her charity work during her lifetime {{and for her}} books long after her death, her reputation began to wane {{at the end of}} the 19th century and plummeted during the 20th century. One reason for this is that her textbooks, so widely used during the first half of the century, were replaced by secular books in the second half of the century. The tone of her books was no longer seen as consonant with British society. An early scholar of children's literature, Geoffrey Summerfield, describes her this way: [...] "Of all the morally shrill women active in the late 18th and early 19th centuries, she was probably the shrillest. Unbalanced, frenetic, paranoid, she may have been, but no one could deny her energy and perseverance in defending the souls of the children of England from the assaults of the devil." [...] Recently, however, children's literature scholars have attempted to view 18th-century children's literature within its historical context rather than judge it against modern tastes; scholars such as Grenby, Ruwe, Ferguson, Fyfe and Cosslett have reassessed Trimmer's work. Because Trimmer does not fit the mold of 20th-century feminism — that is, since she did not rebel against the social mores of her society as did Mary Wollstonecraft — she did not attract the attention of early feminist scholars. However, as Ruwe points out, [...] "by the confluence of political, historical, <b>and</b> <b>pedagogical</b> events at the turn of the century, a woman such as Trimmer was able to gain a greater visibility in the realm of public letters than was perhaps typical before or after"; Trimmer was a [...] "role model for other women authors", and these later authors often acknowledged their debt explicitly, as did the author of The Footsteps to Mrs. Trimmer’s Sacred History.|$|E
