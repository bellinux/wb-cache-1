It is revealed that <b>Arizona</b> became pregnant via a sperm donor prior to sleeping with Lauren. They decided to try again for a second child, but after agreeing that Callie would carry it, Callie went to see an OB/GYN and discovered that she had developed adhesions in her uterus since Sofia's birth, meaning she can't carry any more children. When she told <b>Arizona,</b> <b>Arizona</b> offered to carry the baby, but Callie decided that since they're still on unsteady footing that if something goes wrong, they won't make it and she doesn't want to put them in that position. They agree to postpone their plans to have another baby.

5|$|From {{the late}} 1840s into the 1870s, Texas stockmen drove their beef cattle through {{southern}} <b>Arizona</b> on the Texas–California trail. Texans {{were impressed with}} the grazing possibilities offered by the Gadsden Purchase country of <b>Arizona.</b> In {{the last third of}} the century, they moved their herds into <b>Arizona</b> and established the range cattle industry there. The Texans contributed their proven range methods to the new grass country of <b>Arizona,</b> but also brought their problems as well. Texas rustlers brought lawlessness, poor management resulted in overstocking, and carelessness introduced destructive diseases. But these difficulties did force laws and associations in <b>Arizona</b> to curb and resolve them. The Anglo-American cattleman frontier in <b>Arizona</b> was an extension of the Texas experience.|$|E

40|$|Secreted proteases play {{integral}} {{roles in}} sexual reproduction {{in a broad}} range of taxa. In the genetic model Drosophila melanogaster, these molecules are thought to process peptides and activate enzymes inside female reproductive tracts, mediating critical postmating responses. A recent study of female reproductive tract proteins in the cactophilic fruit fly Drosophila <b>arizonae,</b> identified pervasive, lineage-specific gene duplication amongst secreted proteases. Here, we compare the evolutionary dynamics, biochemical nature, and physiological significance of secreted female reproductive serine endoproteases between D. <b>arizonae</b> and its congener D. melanogaster. We show that D. <b>arizonae</b> lower female reproductive tract (LFRT) proteins are significantly enriched for recently duplicated secreted proteases, particularly serine endoproteases, relative to D. melanogaster. Isolated lumen from D. <b>arizonae</b> LFRTs, furthermore, exhibits significant trypsin-like and elastase-like serine endoprotease acitivity, whereas no such activity is seen in D. melanogaster. Finally, trypsin- and elastase-like activity in D. <b>arizonae</b> female reproductive tracts is negatively regulated by mating. We propose that the intense proteolytic environment of the D. <b>arizonae</b> female reproductive tract relates to the extraordinary reproductive physiology of this species and that ongoing gene duplication amongst these proteases is an evolutionary consequence of sexual conflict...|$|R
