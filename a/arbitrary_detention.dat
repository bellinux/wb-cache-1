5|$|Many of the {{policies}} and practices which resulted in individuals being punished for peacefully exercising their human rights by sending them to RTL have not fundamentally changed: quite the contrary. There is ample evidence that such policies and practices are continuing in full force. The latest anti-Falun Gong campaign, launched earlier this year and intended to operate for three years, shows that the CCP’s determination to rid China of this spiritual group has not abated. Falun Gong practitioners continue to be punished through criminal prosecution and being sent to “brainwashing centres” {{and other forms of}} <b>arbitrary</b> <b>detention.</b> Petitioners likewise continue to be subjected to harassment, forcibly committed to mental institutions and sent to “black jails” and other forms of <b>arbitrary</b> <b>detention.</b> Human rights defenders, democracy advocates, whistle-blowers and other political activists are also being increasingly targeted through criminal detention, “black jails”, short-term administrative detention, and enforced disappearances, rather than RTL.|$|E

25|$|Myanmar's {{government}} {{has been accused of}} crimes against the Muslim Rohingya minority that are alleged to amount to genocide. It has been alleged that Rohingya are the primary targets of hate crimes and discrimination amounting to genocide fueled by extremist nationalist Buddhist monks and Thein Sein's government. Muslim groups have claimed that they were subjected to genocide, torture, <b>arbitrary</b> <b>detention,</b> cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment.|$|E
25|$|The Carr Center for Human Rights Policy at the John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University and the Hariri Foundation-USA {{launched}} the Gebran G.

25|$|Although China outlawed torture in 1996, {{human rights}} groups say {{brutality}} and degradation are common in Chinese <b>arbitrary</b> <b>detention</b> centres, Laojiao prisons and black jails. People who are imprisoned for their political views, human rights activities or religious beliefs have {{a high risk of}} being tortured. While the existence of black jails is acknowledged by {{at least part of the}} government, the CPC strongly denies facilitating the operation of such jails and officially cracks down on them, leading to at least one trial.|$|E
5000|$|Office central de répression du banditisme (OCRB): OCRB was {{a special}} unit within the police created to fight the looting after the army mutinies in 1996 and 1997.

50|$|First {{two weeks}} of June 1999: Significant {{increase}} in military and police incursions in Zapatista communities; <b>arbitrary</b> <b>detentions</b> of presumed Zapatistas; harassment by military personnel at the military bases; and concentration of troops. Each of the incursions involves the participation of between 100 and 1000 military and police personnel.|$|R
25|$|On 19 December 2016, the UN General Assembly {{adopted a}} Canadian-sponsored {{resolution}} expressing “serious concern” about Iran’s {{high rate of}} executions without legal safeguards, ongoing use of torture, widespread <b>arbitrary</b> <b>detentions,</b> sharp limits on freedom of assembly, expression, and religious belief, and continuing discrimination against women and ethnic and religious minorities.|$|R
25|$|In 1974, {{partially}} {{to assuage}} Mon separatist demands, the theoretically autonomous Mon State was created out of portions of Thaninthayi Division and Bago Division. Resistance continued until 1995, when NMSP and SLORC agreed a cease-fire. In 1996, the Mon Unity League was founded. SLORC troops continued {{to operate in}} defiance of the agreement. The human rights situation in Mon State has not improved. International organizations have repeatedly accused the Myanmar government for massive human rights violations in Mon State, including forced labor, <b>arbitrary</b> <b>detention,</b> population transfer, property confiscation, and rape.|$|E
25|$|Ordinary prisons: These prisons (kyohwaso) {{are also}} {{referred}} to as reeducation camps, and are used for those people that the State deems could be reeducated and released back into society. These prisons include common criminals, but also many political prisoners. The vast majority of inmates are victims of <b>arbitrary</b> <b>detention</b> and imprisonment without due process and fair trial guarantees. Torture, rape, excessive forced labor, and other arbitrary cruelties at the hands of guards and fellow prisoners are widespread and committed with impunity. Prisoners are still recognized as citizens and retain some rights. Their incarceration terms are typically not for life, and family visits are possible.|$|E
25|$|The Euro Med Human Rights Monitor {{published}} a report condemning the Libyan coastguard officers' whipping {{of a group}} of migrants rescued near Libya’s Sabrta. In September 2014, nearly 450 migrants were drowned in the Mediterranean. In 2016, more than 4,578 migrants drowned there, following an agreement between the EU and Turkey and the closure of the Balkan route. According to the report, the migrant smuggled into Libya are subject to human trafficking, torture, forced labor, sexual exploitation and <b>arbitrary</b> <b>detention</b> through their way. The Libyan forces were caught on video while humiliating migrants, including women and children. Besides, Human Rights Watch documented similar cases in which Libyan coastguard forces assaulted them verbally and physically in July 2016.|$|E

25|$|Saddam's defense {{repeatedly}} {{argued for}} a delay in the proceedings, insisting {{that it had not}} been given evidence secured by the prosecution, had not been given sufficient time to review any prosecution documents, but these submissions received no response from the court. International human rights groups, including Human Rights Watch, Amnesty International and UN bodies such as the Working Group on <b>Arbitrary</b> <b>Detention</b> and the High Commissioner for Human Rights stated that the Iraqi Special Tribunal and its legal process did not meet international standards for a fair trial. The United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Anan declined to support the proceeding, expressing similar concerns over fairness as well as over the possibility of a death sentence in the case.|$|E
25|$|Freedom Now, a Washington, D.C.-based {{non-profit}} organisation, was {{retained in}} 2006 {{by a member}} of her family to help secure Aung San Suu Kyi's release from house arrest. The organisation secured several opinions from the UN Working Group on <b>Arbitrary</b> <b>Detention</b> that her detention was in violation of international law; engaged in political advocacy such as spearheading a letter from 112 former presidents and Prime Ministers to UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon urging him to go to Burma to seek her release, which he did six weeks later; and published numerous opeds and spoke widely to the media about her ongoing detention. Its representation of her ended when she was released from house arrest on 13 November 2010.|$|E
25|$|A {{number of}} non-government organisations have accused the Ethiopian {{military}} and police of committing human rights violations. A Human Rights Watch representative compared the actions of Ethiopian security forces to crimes against humanity. Ethiopian soldiers and policemen have reportedly participated in numerous instances of rape, <b>arbitrary</b> <b>detention,</b> selective killings, torture and vandalism. In 2005, Ethiopian troops allegedly destroyed a village populated by the Armak minority, killing the denizens with metal bars. New York Times journalists reporting on the story were detained without charges and had their equipment confiscated. Ethiopia's tight control on the access of independent journalists into the region, has complicated the examination of assertions made by {{both sides of the}} conflict. ONLF activists have also claimed that Ethiopian officials used foreign aid as a form of blackmail, purposefully starving thousands of people. The above accusations have been dismissed by the Ethiopian government, which accused NGOs of acting as propaganda tools while completely ignoring abuses committed by the guerrillas.|$|E

25|$|Jamaica {{stressed}} that, although consensual sex between {{adult males}} remained proscribed by law, {{there was no}} legal discrimination against persons {{on the grounds of}} their sexual orientation. Jamaica pointed out that Jamaican law did not criminalise lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender orientation, nor did the Government condone discrimination or violence against lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender persons. It added that there had been no credible cases of <b>arbitrary</b> <b>detention</b> and/or harassment of such persons by the police, nor was there any such official policy. Likewise, {{there was no evidence of}} any mob-related killing of lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender persons. Jamaica stressed that the issue of male homosexuality was one of great sensitivity in Jamaican society, in which cultural norms, values, religious and moral standards underlay a rejection of male homosexual behaviour by a large majority of Jamaicans; and that the Government was committed to ensuring that all citizens were protected from violence.|$|E
25|$|Lèse-majesté {{complaints}} can {{be filed}} by any person against anyone else, {{and they must}} always be formally investigated. Details of the charges are rarely made public. A section 112 defendant always meets with obstructions {{from the beginning to}} the end of a case, especially when asking for a provisional release. There are months-long pretrial detentions, and those who are charged are routinely denied bail, remaining in prison for many months awaiting trial. In most cases, convictions result in harsh sentences. The United Nations Working Group on <b>Arbitrary</b> <b>Detention</b> determined in August 2012 that the pretrial detention of an alleged lèse-majesté offender violated international human rights law. The courts seem not to recognise the principle of granting the benefit of the doubt to defendants. Judges have said that accusers did not have to prove the factuality of the alleged lèse-majesté material, but only to claim it is defaming in any way. Pleading guilty is seen as a move to seek a royal pardon.|$|E
500|$|The Department of Public Safety is the {{official}} name of the regular police force and handles most day-to-day police activities. It is a highly centralized force and is usually headed {{by a member of}} the royal family. The [...] "secret police", or Mabahith, deals with domestic security and counter-intelligence. It runs the `Ulaysha Prison in Riyadh, where it holds its prisoners. The United Nations' Working Group on <b>Arbitrary</b> <b>Detention</b> has objected to <b>arbitrary</b> <b>detention</b> by the Mubahith at `Ulaysha.|$|E
50|$|Human Rights Watch's 2006 {{report on}} Egypt {{detailed}} serious human rights violations, including routine torture, <b>arbitrary</b> <b>detentions</b> and trials before military and state security courts.
