5|$|Aside {{from the}} {{prosperity}} and modernization PedroII {{left to the}} nation, {{there was also a}} heritage of political and personal values.

5|$|Charles XI has {{sometimes}} been described in Sweden <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>greatest</b> of all the Swedish kings, except for Gustavus II Adolphus, unduly eclipsed by {{his father and his}} son.
