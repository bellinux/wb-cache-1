5|$|Despite this agreement, in 93 or 92BC Parthia fought <b>a</b> <b>war</b> <b>in</b> Syria {{against the}} tribal leader Laodice and her Seleucid ally Antiochus X Eusebes (r.95–92?BC), killing the latter.

5|$|In 1753 the French began {{expanding}} their military control into the Ohio Country, a territory already {{claimed by the}} British colonies of Virginia and Pennsylvania. These competing claims led to <b>a</b> <b>war</b> <b>in</b> the colonies called the French and Indian War (1754–62) {{and contributed to the}} start of the global Seven Years' War (1756–63). By chance, Washington became involved in its beginning.|$|E
5|$|Apparently formidable, the Libyan {{military}} disposition in Chad was {{marred by}} serious flaws. The Libyans were prepared for <b>a</b> <b>war</b> <b>in</b> which they would provide ground and air support to their Chadian allies, act as assault infantry, and provide reconnaissance. By 1987, however, Muammar Gaddafi had lost his allies, exposing Libya's inadequate knowledge of the area. Libyan garrisons came to resemble isolated and vulnerable islands in the Chadian Sahara. Also important was the low morale among the troops, who were fighting in a foreign country, and the structural disorganization of the Libyan army, which was in part induced by Gaddafi's fear of a military coup against him. This fear led him to avoid the professionalization of the armed forces.|$|E

5|$|Descent: FreeSpace – The Great War, {{also known}} as Conflict: FreeSpace – The Great War in Europe, is a 1998 space combat {{simulation}} IBM PC compatible computer game developed by Volition, when it was split off from Parallax Software, and published by Interplay Productions. In 2001, it was ported to the Amiga platform as FreeSpace: The Great War by Hyperion Entertainment. The game places players {{in the role of}} a human pilot, who operates in several classes of starfighter and combats against opposing forces, either human or alien, in various space-faring environments, such as in orbit above a planet or within an asteroid belt. The story of the game's single player campaign focuses on <b>a</b> <b>war</b> <b>in</b> the 24th century between two factions, one human and the other alien, that is interrupted in its fourteenth year by the arrival of an enigmatic and militant alien race, whose genocidal advance forces the two sides into a ceasefire in order to work together to halt the threat.|$|E
5|$|In May 1941, {{following}} {{the construction of}} the central north–south Stuart Highway, the federal government announced its decision to build the east–west highway between Norseman and Port Augusta. A northerly route, close to the Trans-Australian Railway, had been considered, but extensive limestone outcrops made it impractical. Taking a route east from Norseman, with some detours around limestone ridges, would allow a road to be formed quickly and easily. With <b>a</b> <b>war</b> <b>in</b> the Pacific seemingly imminent, construction soon began, in July 1941. The Army was responsible for fuel, food, and communications, while the state government departments of Main Roads (Western Australia) and Highways (South Australia) managed the actual construction.|$|E
5|$|In the 1960s and 1970s, Fluor {{built the}} first all-hydrogen {{refinery}} in Kuwait and the first exclusively offshore power plant for the Atlantic Richfield Company. It also constructed pumps and ports for the Trans-Alaska Pipeline System, which traversed 800 miles from northern Alaska to Valdez, Alaska, and the world's largest offshore facility for natural gas {{on the island of}} Java in Indonesia. In 1976, it was awarded a $5 billion project for ARAMCO in Saudi Arabia, to design facilities that capture sour gas, which is expelled from oil wells as waste, in order to refine it into fuel. That same year a partially completed copper and cobalt mine in Africa was cancelled due to <b>a</b> <b>war</b> <b>in</b> the neighboring region of Angola and declining copper prices. In 1979, Fluor had 13 projects for building United States power plants and had served {{more than half of the}} world's government-owned oil companies.|$|E

5|$|The Mauritius {{campaign}} of 1809–1811 {{was a series}} of amphibious operations and naval actions fought to determine possession of the French Indian Ocean territories of Isle de France and Île Bonaparte during the Napoleonic Wars. The campaign lasted from the spring of 1809 until the spring of 1811, and saw both the Royal Navy and the French Navy deploy substantial frigate squadrons with the intention of disrupting or protecting trade from British India. In <b>a</b> <b>war</b> <b>in</b> which the Royal Navy was almost universally dominant at sea, the campaign is especially notable for the local superiority enjoyed by the French Navy in the autumn of 1810 following the British disaster at the Battle of Grand Port, the most significant defeat for the Royal Navy in the entire conflict. After their victory, the British used the original Dutch name of Mauritius for Isle de France. In 1814, Île Bonaparte was returned to France, who eventually renamed it La Réunion.|$|E
5|$|The {{construction}} of the East–West Telegraph line in the 1870s, along Eyre's route, resulted in a hazardous trail that could be followed for interstate travel. A national highway was called for, but the federal government {{did not see the}} route as important enough until 1941, when <b>a</b> <b>war</b> <b>in</b> the Pacific seemed imminent. The highway was constructed between July 1941 and June 1942, but was trafficable by January 1942. Though originally named Forrest Highway, after John Forrest, by the war cabinet, it was officially named and gazetted Eyre Highway, a name agreed upon by the states' nomenclature committees.|$|E
5|$|The {{missiles}} were launched {{three days after}} Clinton testified on the Monica Lewinsky scandal, and some countries, media outlets, protesters, and Republicans accused Clinton of ordering the attacks as a diversion. The attacks also drew parallels to the then-recently released movie Wag the Dog, which features a fictional president faking <b>a</b> <b>war</b> <b>in</b> Albania to distract attention from a sex scandal. Administration officials denied any connection between the missile strikes and the ongoing scandal, and 9/11 Commission investigators found no reason to dispute those statements.|$|E

Following this Amlaíb and his kin warred with several Irish leaders {{in an attempt}} to expand their kingdom's influence. In later years Amlaíb conducted extensive raids in Scotland, though these were interrupted by <b>a</b> <b>war</b> <b>in</b> 868 against his former ally Áed Findliath when several Viking longphorts along the northern coast were razed. Amlaíb disappears from contemporary annals in 871. Later accounts say he returned to Lochlann to aid his father in a war, and the Pictish Chronicle says he died in battle against Constantine I of Scotland. This event is usually dated to 874.|$|E
5|$|After the German {{invasion}} of Norway and Denmark, {{followed by a}} warning by the new Japanese naval attaché Captain Tadashi Meada that a German attack on the Netherlands was certain, {{it became clear to}} the Dutch military that staying out of the conflict might prove impossible. They started to fully prepare for war, both mentally and physically. Dutch border troops were put on greater alert. Reports of the presumed actions of a Fifth Column in Scandinavia caused widespread fears that the Netherlands too had been infiltrated by German agents assisted by traitors. Countermeasures were taken against a possible assault on airfields and ports. On 19 April a state of emergency was declared. However, most civilians still cherished the illusion that their country might be spared, an attitude that has since been described as a state of denial. The Dutch hoped that the restrained policy of the Entente and Central Powers during the First World War might be repeated and tried to avoid the attention of the Great Powers and <b>a</b> <b>war</b> <b>in</b> which they feared a loss of human life comparable to that of the previous conflict. On 10 April Britain and France repeated their request that the Dutch enter the war on their side, but were again refused.|$|E
5|$|In 88 BC, {{an aristocratic}} senator named Lucius Cornelius Sulla was elected Consul, and soon left for <b>a</b> <b>war</b> <b>in</b> the east. When a Tribune revoked Sulla's {{command of the}} war, Sulla brought his army back to Italy, marched on Rome, secured the city, and left for the east again. In 83 BC he {{returned}} to Rome, and captured the city a second time. In 82 BC, he made himself Dictator, and then used his status as Dictator to pass a series of constitutional reforms that were intended to strengthen the senate. In 80 BC he resigned his Dictatorship, and by 78 BC he was dead. While he {{thought that he had}} firmly established aristocratic rule, his own career had illustrated the fatal weakness in the constitution: that it was the army, and not the senate, which dictated the fortunes of the state. In 70 BC, the generals Pompey Magnus and Marcus Licinius Crassus were both elected Consul, and quickly dismantled Sulla's constitution. In 62 BC Pompey returned to Rome from battle in the east, and soon entered into an agreement with Julius Caesar. Caesar and Pompey, along with Crassus, established a private agreement, known as the First Triumvirate. Under the agreement, Pompey's arrangements were to be ratified, Crassus was to be promised a future Consulship, and Caesar was to be promised the Consulship in 59 BC, and then the governorship of Gaul (modern France) immediately afterwards. In 54 BC, violence began sweeping the city, and in 53 BC Crassus was killed. In January 49 BC, the senate passed a resolution which declared that if Caesar did not lay down his arms by July of that year, he would be considered an enemy of the republic. In response, Caesar quickly crossed the Rubicon with his veteran army, and marched towards Rome. Caesar's rapid advance forced Pompey, the Consuls and the senate to abandon Rome for Greece, and allowed Caesar to enter the city unopposed.|$|E

5|$|The Peace of Thorn of 1466 {{reduced the}} Teutonic Knights, but brought no lasting {{solution}} to the problem they presented for Poland and their state avoided paying the prescribed tribute. The chronically difficult relations had gotten worse after the 1511 election of Albrecht as Grand Master of the Order. Faced with Albrecht's rearmament and hostile alliances, Poland waged <b>a</b> <b>war</b> <b>in</b> 1519; the war ended in 1521, when mediation by Charles V resulted in a truce. As a compromise move Albrecht, persuaded by Martin Luther, initiated a process of secularization of the Order and the establishment of a lay duchy of Prussia, as Poland's dependency, ruled by Albrecht and afterwards by his descendants. The terms of the proposed pact immediately improved Poland's Baltic region situation, and at that time also appeared to protect the country's long-term interests. The treaty was concluded in 1525 in Kraków; the remaining state of the Teutonic Knights (East Prussia centered on Königsberg) was converted into the Protestant (Lutheran) Duchy of Prussia under the King of Poland and the homage act of the new Prussian duke in Kraków followed.|$|E
5|$|While Charles Theodore's {{dream of}} a Burgundian renaissance receded, Joseph {{continued}} on his course to annex part of Bavaria. The widow—Max Joseph's widow or the mother-in-law or both—petitioned Prussia on behalf of Charles II August. Frederick's envoys to the heir presumptive convinced this slighted prince to lodge protests with the Imperial Diet in Regensburg. Joseph's troops remained in portions of Bavaria, even establishing an Austrian administration at Straubing, precipitating a diplomatic crisis. Austrian occupation of Bavaria was unacceptable to Charles August's champion, Frederick. Prussian troops mobilized near Prussia's border with Bohemia, reminiscent of the invasion in 1740 that so endangered Maria Theresa's succession to the Habsburg hereditary lands. Meanwhile, the French wriggled out of their diplomatic obligations to Austria, telling Joseph {{that there would be}} no military support from Paris for a war against Prussia. Britain, Prussia's strongest ally, was already mired in <b>a</b> <b>war</b> <b>in</b> North America, but Prussia's military had recovered from the Seven Years' War and Frederick did not require any help. Prussia's other ally, Saxony, aligned by two marriages with Charles August, was strategically prepared for war against Austria and ready to contribute twenty thousand troops. Watching from St. Petersburg, Catherine II was willing to mop up the spoils of war for the Russian Empire but did not want to get involved in another costly European conflict.|$|E
