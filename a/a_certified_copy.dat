50|$|Steven Marquess {{has posted}} a {{criticism}} that FIPS 140-2 validation {{can lead to}} incentives to keep vulnerabilities and other defects hidden. CMVP can decertify software in which vulnerabilities are found, but it can take a year to re-certify software if defects are found, so companies can be left without <b>a</b> <b>certified</b> product to ship. As an example, Steven Marquess mentions a vulnerability that was found, publicised, and fixed in the FIPS-certified open-source derivative of OpenSSL, with the publication meaning that the OpenSSL derivative was decertified. This decertification hurt companies relying on the OpenSSL-derivative's FIPS certification. By contrast, companies that had renamed and <b>certified</b> <b>a</b> <b>copy</b> of the open-source OpenSSL derivative were not decertified, {{even though they were}} basically identical, and did not fix the vulnerability. Steven Marquess therefore argues that the FIPS process inadvertently encourages hiding software's origins, to de-associate it from defects since found in the original, while potentially leaving the <b>certified</b> <b>copy</b> vulnerable.|$|R
