Also, the microscopic properties of helium-3 cause it to have a higher zero-point energy than helium-4. This implies that helium-3 can overcome dipole–dipole interactions with less thermal energy than helium-4 can.|$|R

For 12C the isotopic mass is exactly 12, since the <b>atomic</b> <b>mass</b> <b>unit</b> is defined as 1/12 of the mass of 12C. For other isotopes, the isotopic mass is usually within 0.1 u of the mass number. For example, 35Cl (17 protons and 18 neutrons) has a mass number of 35 and an isotopic mass of 34.96885.|$|R
500|$|In 1993, the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) {{approved}} {{the use of}} the dalton {{as an alternative to the}} unified <b>atomic</b> <b>mass</b> <b>unit</b> with the qualification that the CGPM had not given its approval. This approval has since been given. Following the proposal to redefine the mole by fixing the value of Avogadro's number, Brian Leonard of the University of Akron, writing in Metrologia proposed that the dalton (Da) be redefined as such that NA = (g/Da)mol, but that the unified <b>atomic</b> <b>mass</b> <b>unit</b> (mu) retain its current definition based on the mass of 12C, ceasing to exactly equal to the dalton. [...] This would result in the dalton and the <b>atomic</b> <b>mass</b> <b>unit</b> potentially differing from each other with a relative uncertainty of the order of 10−10.|$|R

5000|$|Relative <b>atomic</b> <b>mass</b> (symbol: A) is a {{dimensionless}} (number only) physical quantity.
