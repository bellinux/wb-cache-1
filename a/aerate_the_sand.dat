50|$|Aquarium owners may {{like to use}} the {{halloween}} {{hermit crab}} because it is visually unlike other aquarium cleaning crabs. It can eat any left-over food that settles along the bottom, sifts through <b>the</b> <b>sand</b> which <b>aerates</b> <b>the</b> aquarium substrate and is well known to eat cyanobacteria, unsightly brown bacteria, and filamentous green algae efficiently. However, because it can become aggressive towards other tank animals and may even kill fish and other invertebrates, it is wise to feed it meats, such as clams, mussels, scallops and shrimp along with various vegetation. Overall, it can support a healthy aquarium environment.|$|R
50|$|Holothuria edulis {{is mainly}} nocturnal {{and tends to}} hide during the day under rocks or pieces of coral. It is a detritivore and feeds by ingesting sand and debris which has {{accumulated}} on the seabed which it picks up using its feeding tentacles. Sand is pushed into the mouth and any organic matter present, including the biofilm round the grains, is digested as <b>the</b> <b>sand</b> passes through <b>the</b> gut. The indigestible matter is expelled from the anus leaving a <b>sand</b> ridge as <b>the</b> animal moves around. During its feeding activities, the sea cucumber churns up the top few centimetres of seabed and <b>aerates</b> <b>the</b> sediment.|$|R
50|$|The crab's smaller claw {{picks up}} a chunk of {{sediment}} {{from the ground and}} brings it to the mouth, where its contents are sifted through (making the crab a detritivore). After anything edible is salvaged, be it algae, microbes, fungus, or other decaying detritus, the sediment is replaced {{in the form of a}} little ball. The presence of these sediment balls near the entrance to a burrow is a good indication of its occupation. Some experts believe that the feeding habits of fiddler crabs play a vital role in the preservation of wetland environments; by sifting through <b>the</b> <b>sands,</b> they <b>aerate</b> <b>the</b> substrate and prevent anaerobic conditions.|$|R

30|$|Each mixture was {{carefully}} homogenized, moisture was adjusted to 60  % (optimal value for composting) {{and then the}} mixtures were windrowed. Windrows were turned over by hand weekly to <b>aerate</b> <b>the</b> mixture. Homogeneous samples were taken at T 0 (first day of co-composting) and after each airing (<b>aerating</b> <b>the</b> mixture). Homogeneous samples (1  kg) were obtained by careful mixing of several sub samples taken at different points (height and length) of the windrow and quartering. The samples were kept at − 20  °C before analysis.|$|R

40|$|Chromis viridis (green chromis) is {{a species}} of damselfish. It is found in {{tropical}} and subtropical waters. C. viridis is encountered in wild specimens prefer to school in large shoals amongst branching corals like Acropora in sheltered areas such as subtidal reef flats and lagoons. We report {{for the first time}} from Iranian Waters) Persian Gulf, Kish Island), we found it at depth of 2 - 8 m, and Maximum length is 7 cm in Kish Island (Iranian Waters). Adults of this species can grow up to 10 cm at maximum length. When they are breeding, males turn more yellowish. The marriages are a pair matter, but they take place grouped. The males chose for the nest, a small dimple dug in <b>the</b> <b>sand,</b> <b>the</b> dead branch of madrepora or simply, one hospitable seaweed. Then they dance, moving up and down, like if they were jumping inside a virtual column of water, for attracting the attention of the females and show the competitors that is their place. Oviparous, distinct pairing during breeding. Eggs are demersal and adhere to the substrate. Males guard and <b>aerate</b> <b>the</b> eggs. Juveniles closely tied to individual coral heads...|$|R

50|$|An {{ice cream}} maker has to {{simultaneously}} freeze the mixture while churning it {{so as to}} <b>aerate</b> <b>the</b> mixture and avoid ice crystals. As a result, most ice creams are ready to consume immediately. However, those containing alcohol must often be chilled further to attain a firm consistency.|$|R
2500|$|Holes, or [...] "hydraulics", (also {{known as}} [...] "stoppers" [...] or [...] "souse-holes". See also Pillows), are formed when water pours {{over the top}} of a {{submerged}} object, or underwater ledges, causing the surface water to flow back upstream toward the object. [...] Holes can be particularly dangerous - a boater may become stuck under the surface, in the recirculating water, or entertaining play-spots, where paddlers use the holes' features to perform various playboating moves. [...] In high and low volume water flow, holes can subtly <b>aerate</b> <b>the</b> water, enough to allow craft to fall through <b>the</b> <b>aerated</b> water to <b>the</b> bottom of a deep 'hole'.|$|R

50|$|The bike {{was popular}} {{at first but}} soon {{reliability}} problems began to emerge and the problems lay with the Omni-Phase balancer: At high rpm the balance weights would whip oil in the sump into a froth, <b>aerating</b> <b>the</b> oil and starving the crank for lubrication which resulted in bearing failure.|$|R
50|$|One type {{of system}} that {{combines}} secondary treatment and settlement is the cyclic activated sludge (CASSBR), or sequencing batch reactor (SBR). Typically, activated sludge is mixed with raw incoming sewage, and then mixed and <b>aerated.</b> <b>The</b> settled sludge is run off and re-aerated before a proportion is returned to the headworks.|$|R

50|$|Their burrows {{alter the}} {{topography}} and sediment grain {{size of the}} mangrove, and help <b>aerate</b> <b>the</b> sediment. Removing crabs from an area causes significant increases in sulfides and ammonium concentrations, which in turn affects the productivity and reproductive output of the vegetation, supporting the hypothesis that mangrove crabs are a keystone species.|$|R
50|$|According to the Chinese {{biologists}} {{who have}} studied the wildlife of the Hoh Xil (northern part of the Tibetan Plateau), plateau pikas are the favorite food of the area's brown bears. In addition to {{its role as a}} prey base, the plateau pika is important for soil health in meadows; the burrowing of the species helps to <b>aerate</b> <b>the</b> soil. The species is currently considered threatened, mostly due to aggressive poisoning campaigns by Chinese populations, predominantly to eliminate competition for food with livestock.|$|R
50|$|Stichopus chloronotus is a detritivore and sifts {{through the}} {{sediment}} on the seabed with its tentacles and feeds on detritus and other organic matter including {{plant and animal}} remains, bacteria, protozoa, diatoms and faeces.
