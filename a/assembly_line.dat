40|$|Two-sided <b>assembly</b> <b>lines</b> {{are often}} {{designed}} to produce large-sized products, such as automobiles, trucks and buses. In {{this type of}} a production line, both left-side and right-side of the line are used in parallel. In all studies on two-sided <b>assembly</b> <b>lines,</b> the task times {{are assumed to be}} deterministic. However, in real life applications, especially in manual <b>assembly</b> <b>lines,</b> the tasks may have varying execution times defined as a probability distribution. The task time variation may result from machine breakdowns, loss of motivation, lack of training, non-qualified operators, complex tasks, environment, etc. In this paper, the problem of balancing two-sided <b>assembly</b> <b>lines</b> with stochastic task times (STALBP) is considered. A chance-constrained, piecewise-linear, mixed integer program (CPMIP) is proposed to model and solve the problem. As a solution approach a simulated annealing (SA) algorithm is proposed. To assess the effectiveness of CPMIP and SA algorithm, a set of test problems are solved. Finally, computational results indicating the effectiveness of CPMIP and SA algorithm are reported.

5|$|The {{generation}} of new genes can also involve small parts of several genes being duplicated, with these fragments then recombining to form new combinations with new functions. When new genes are assembled from shuffling pre-existing parts, domains act as modules with simple independent functions, {{which can be}} mixed together to produce new combinations with new and complex functions. For example, polyketide synthases are large enzymes that make antibiotics; they contain up to one hundred independent domains that each catalyse one step in the overall process, like a step in an <b>assembly</b> <b>line.</b>|$|E

Thuillier, a former colorist of glass and celluloid products, directed a studio of two hundred people painting directly on film stock with brushes, in the colors she chose and specified. Each worker was assigned a different color in <b>assembly</b> <b>line</b> style, with more than twenty separate colors often used for a single film. On average, Thuillier's lab produced about sixty hand-colored copies of a film.|$|E

5|$|At {{the inauguration}} of its new <b>assembly</b> <b>line,</b> the 767's order backlog {{numbered}} approximately 50, only enough for production to last until 2013. Despite the reduced backlog, Boeing officials expressed optimism that additional orders would be forthcoming. On February 24, 2011, the USAF announced its selection of the KC-767 Advanced Tanker, an upgraded variant of the KC-767, for its KC-X fleet renewal program. The selection followed two rounds of tanker competition between Boeing and Airbus parent EADS, and came eight years after the USAF's original 2003 announcement of its plan to lease KC-767s. The tanker order encompassed 179 aircraft and was expected to sustain 767 production past 2013.|$|E
5|$|Boeing built a final <b>assembly</b> <b>line</b> in Washington at its Renton factory, home of 707, 727, and 737 production, {{to produce}} the 757. Early in the {{development}} program, Boeing, British Airways, and Rolls-Royce unsuccessfully lobbied the British aircraft industry to manufacture 757 wings. Ultimately, {{about half of the}} aircraft's components, including the wings, nose section, and empennage, were produced in-house at Boeing facilities, and the remainder subcontracted to primarily U.S.-based companies. Fairchild Aircraft made the leading edge slats, Grumman supplied the flaps, and Rockwell International produced the main fuselage. Production ramp-up for the new narrow-body airliner coincided with the winding-down of the 727 program, and final assembly of the first aircraft began in January 1981.|$|E
5|$|On 26 April 1990, GM's New Zealand {{subsidiary}} Holden New Zealand {{announced that}} {{production at the}} assembly plant based in Trentham would be phased out and vehicles would be imported duty-free—this came after the 1984 closure of the Petone <b>assembly</b> <b>line</b> due to low output volumes. During the 1990s, Holden, other Australian automakers and trade unions pressured the Australian Government to halt the lowering of car import tariffs. By 1997, {{the federal government had}} already cut tariffs to 22.5percent, from 57.5percent ten years earlier; by 2000, a plan was formulated to reduce the tariffs to 15percent. Holden was critical, saying that Australia's population was not large enough, and that the changes could tarnish the local industry.|$|E
