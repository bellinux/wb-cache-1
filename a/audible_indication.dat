500|$|In September 1964, Raymon Dones, of El Cerrito, California, {{received}} US patent 3150739 {{which was}} the first patent for a subwoofer specifically designed to augment omni-directionally the low frequency range of modern stereo systems. Able to reproduce distortion-free low frequencies down to 15 cycles per second (15Hz), a specific objective of Dones’ invention was to provide portable sound enclosures capable of high fidelity reproduction of low frequency sound waves without giving an <b>audible</b> <b>indication</b> of the direction from which they emanate. Dones' loudspeaker was marketed in the US under the trade name [...] "The Octavium" [...] from the early 1960s to the mid-1970s. The Octavium was utilized by several recording artists of that era, most notably the Grateful Dead, bassist Monk Montgomery, bassist Nathan East, and the Pointer Sisters. The Octavium speaker and Dones' subwoofer technology was also utilized, in a few select theaters, to reproduce low pitch frequencies for the 1974 blockbuster movie Earthquake. [...] During the late 1960s Dones’ Octavium was favorably reviewed by audiophile publications including Hi-Fi News and Audio Magazine.|$|E

40|$|A {{radiation}} dosimeter {{providing an}} indication of the dose of radiation to which the radiation sensor has been exposed. The dosimeter contains features enabling the monitoring and evaluating of radiological risks so that a user can concentrate on the task at hand. The dosimeter provides an <b>audible</b> alarm <b>indication</b> that a predetermined time period has elapsed, an <b>audible</b> alarm <b>indication</b> reminding the user to check the dosimeter <b>indication</b> periodically, an <b>audible</b> alarm indicating that a predetermined accumulated dose has been prematurely reached, and an <b>audible</b> alarm <b>indication</b> prior or to reaching the 3 / 4 scale point...|$|R
50|$|It is well known, {{that when}} two {{consonant}} sounds are heard together, a third sound {{results from the}} coincidences of their vibrations; and that this third sound, which is called the grave harmonic, is always equal to unity, when the two primitive sounds are represented by the lowest integral numbers. This being premised, select two tuning-forks the sounds of which differ by any consonant interval excepting the octave; place the broad sides of their branches, while in vibration, close to one ear, {{in such a manner}} that they shall nearly touch at the acoustic axis; the resulting grave harmonic will then be strongly audible, combined with the two other sounds; place afterwards one fork to each ear, and the consonance will be heard much richer in volume, but no <b>audible</b> <b>indications</b> whatever of the third sound will be perceived.|$|R
5000|$|A {{stop with}} no audible release, {{also known as}} an {{unreleased}} stop or an applosive, is a stop consonant with no release burst: no <b>audible</b> <b>indication</b> {{of the end of}} its occlusion (hold). In the International Phonetic Alphabet, lack of an audible release is denoted with an upper-right corner diacritic (...) after the consonant letter: , , [...]|$|E
50|$|It is {{the wall}} {{situated}} {{in the back of}} the court. It has no markings and is the same size as the front wall. It has 10 centimeter metallic sheets on its rims to give an <b>audible</b> <b>indication</b> of a ball striking outside of the playable area. Many pelota courts lack this wall, and are therefore not used for official competitions.|$|E
50|$|Advanced {{electronic}} variometers in gliders {{can present}} other {{information to the}} pilot from GPS receivers. The display can thus show the bearing, distance and height required to reach an objective. In cruise mode (used in straight flight), the vario can also give an <b>audible</b> <b>indication</b> of the correct speed to fly {{depending on whether the}} air is rising or sinking. The pilot merely has to input the estimated MacCready setting, which is the expected rate of climb in the next acceptable thermal.|$|E
50|$|Certified to have {{no single}} point of failure. That is, no single cause of failure should cause the pump to silently fail to operate correctly. It should at least stop pumping and make at least an <b>audible</b> error <b>indication.</b> This is a minimum {{requirement}} on all human-rated infusion pumps of whatever age. It is not required for veterinary infusion pumps.|$|R
60|$|Mr. Tupman looked round him. The wine, {{which had}} exerted its somniferous {{influence}} over Mr. Snodgrass and Mr. Winkle, had stolen upon the senses of Mr. Pickwick. That gentleman had gradually {{passed through the}} various stages which precede the lethargy produced by dinner, and its consequences. He had undergone the ordinary transitions from the height of conviviality to the depth of misery, and from the depth of misery to the height of conviviality. Like a gas-lamp in the street, with {{the wind in the}} pipe, he had exhibited for a moment an unnatural brilliancy, then sank so low as to be scarcely discernible; after a short interval, he had burst out again, to enlighten for a moment; then flickered with an uncertain, staggering sort of light, and then gone out altogether. His head was sunk upon his bosom, and perpetual snoring, with a partial choke occasionally, were the only <b>audible</b> <b>indications</b> of the great man's presence.|$|R
50|$|The Great Western Railway {{developed}} a system {{referred to as}} Automatic train control (ATC). In its developed form it gave drivers an <b>audible</b> and visual <b>indication</b> in the cab of the aspect of a distant signal as it was approached or passed. If a warning was given and not acknowledged by the driver, the train brakes would be applied. Track equipment near the distant signals operated detection equipment on the locomotive.|$|R
50|$|A {{change of}} ADU display {{to a less}} {{restrictive}} aspect (e.g., double yellow to green) is termed an upgrade, while a change to a more restrictive aspect (e.g., single yellow to red) is called a downgrade. Any change of ADU display {{is accompanied by a}}n <b>audible</b> <b>indication.</b> A momentary audible ‘warble’ sound indicates an upgrade. A downgrade is accompanied by a continuous audible tone and the illumination of the Acknowledge Switch that must be pressed by the driver within 7-seconds to prevent an automatic brake application occurring for one minute. This is not recoverable until the time has expired. Acknowledgement by the driver within the first 7-seconds immediately silences the tone.|$|E
50|$|The game is {{actually}} somewhat non-linear since some tasks {{can be solved}} in a different order, with the gameplay periodically simplified by one-way plot elements. There are only twelve saved-game slots, which may be too few for some players. However, multiple sets of saved games can be retained by manually copying SAVEGAME.* files from the game installation directory. An <b>audible</b> <b>indication</b> of the main character's shrug is needed {{so you have a}} better idea when nothing can be done with an inventory item or hotspot. There are few inventory red herrings since most of the stuff gets used at some point or other. Strong language appears at a few points in the game.|$|E

50|$|At {{this time}} the GWR was {{developing}} its automatic train control (ATC) system. When finalised, track equipment was provided at distant signals which gave an <b>audible</b> and visual <b>indication</b> in the engine cab of whether the distant signal was off or on. If it was on, and the driver failed to acknowledge a warning, the brakes were automatically applied. In the experimental stage on the Lambourn branch, the ATC was provided instead of distant signals; conceptually an early form of cab signalling.|$|R
50|$|A {{train driver}} failing {{to respond to}} a signal's {{indication}} can be disastrous. As a result, various auxiliary safety systems have been devised. Any such system requires installation of some degree of trainborne equipment. Some systems only intervene {{in the event of a}} signal being passed at danger (SPAD). Others include <b>audible</b> and/or visual <b>indications</b> inside the driver's cab to supplement the lineside signals. Automatic brake application occurs if the driver should fail to acknowledge a warning. Some systems act intermittently (at each signal), but the most sophisticated systems provide continuous supervision.|$|R
50|$|SunPass {{portable}} (hard case) transponders can {{be transferred}} between vehicles without damaging the transponder. The original transponders operate on battery power to communicate with toll barrier equipment and to operate <b>audible</b> and visual <b>indications</b> of toll paid, toll low, battery low, and so forth. The Type IIe transponder, {{an updated version of}} the SunPass portable, requires no batteries, but does not have indicator lights or audible beeps. SunPass portable transponders are sold for $19.99 to customers who prefer the portability offered by the transponder. Customers must establish a minimum opening account of $10.00 to fund their tolls. Unused toll fees are only refunded if the user closes the account or takes advantage of a money-back guarantee.|$|R
5000|$|The {{instruments}} {{are designed to}} be hand-held, are battery powered and of low mass to allow easy manipulation. Other features include an easily readable display, in counts or radiation dose, and an <b>audible</b> <b>indication</b> of the count rate. This is usually the “click” associated with the Geiger type instrument, and can also be an alarm warning sound when a rate of radiation counts or dose has been exceeded. For dual channel detectors such as the scintillation detector it is normal to generate different sounds for alpha and beta. This gives the operator rapid feedback on both the level of radiation and the type of particle being detected. These features allow the user to concentrate on manipulation of the meter whilst having auditory feedback of the rate of radiation detected. [...] Meters can be fully integrated with probe and processing electronics in one housing to allow single-handed use, or have separate detector probe and electronics housings, joined by a signal cable. This latter is preferred for checking of convoluted surfaces for radioactive contamination due to the ease of manipulating the probe.|$|E

5000|$|The Rail Safety and Standards Board defines it as:The {{original}} {{concept of}} AWS {{was to provide}} the driver with an <b>audible</b> and visual <b>indication</b> of whether the distant signal was clear or at caution. Should the driver fail {{to respond to a}} warning indication, an emergency brake application will be initiated.Since the introduction of multi-aspect signalling, the majority of signals are fitted with AWS.It should be noted that AWS does not relieve the driver of the responsibility of observing and obeying lineside signals and indicators.It was based on a 1930 system developed by Alfred Ernest Hudd and marketed as the [...] "Strowger-Hudd" [...] system. An earlier contact system, installed on the Great Western Railway since 1906 and known as automatic train control (ATC), was gradually supplanted by AWS within the Western Region of British Railways.|$|R
40|$|The Waste Handling Building Ventilation System {{provides}} heating, ventilation, and {{air conditioning}} (HVAC) for the contaminated, potentially contaminated, and uncontaminated areas of the Monitored Geologic Repository's (MGR) Waste Handling Building (WHB). In the uncontaminated areas, the non-confinement area ventilation system maintains the proper environmental conditions for equipment operation and personnel comfort. In the contaminated and potentially contaminated areas, in addition to maintaining the proper environmental conditions for equipment operation and personnel comfort, the contamination confinement area ventilation system directs potentially contaminated air away from personnel in the WHB and confines the contamination within high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filtration units. The contamination confinement areas ventilation system creates airflow paths and pressure zones to minimize the potential for spreading contamination within the building. The contamination confinement ventilation system also protects {{the environment and the}} public by limiting airborne releases of radioactive or other hazardous contaminants from the WHB. The Waste Handling Building Ventilation System is designed to perform its safety functions under accident conditions and other Design Basis Events (DBEs) (such as earthquakes, tornadoes, fires, and loss of the primary electric power). Additional system design features (such as compartmentalization with independent subsystems) limit the potential for cross-contamination within the WHB. The system provides status of important system parameters and equipment operation, and provides <b>audible</b> and/or visual <b>indication</b> of off-normal conditions and equipment failures. The Waste Handling Building Ventilation System confines the radioactive and hazardous material within the building such that the release rates comply with regulatory limits. The system design, operations, and maintenance activities incorporate ALARA (as low as is reasonably achievable) principles to maintain personnel radiation doses to all occupational workers below regulatory limits and as low as is reasonably achievable. The Waste Handling Building Ventilation System interfaces with the Waste Handling Building System by being located within the WHB and by maintaining specific pressures, temperatures, and humidity within the building. The system also depends on the WHB for water supply. The system interfaces with the Site Radiological Monitoring System for continuous monitoring of the exhaust air; the Waste Handling Building Fire Protection System for detection of fire and smoke; the Waste Handling Building Electrical System for normal, emergency, and standby power; and the Monitored Geologic Repository Operations Monitoring and Control System for monitoring and control of the system...|$|R
