'I strongly support the need for the enhancement of the input to virology in Africa. One only has to look at the problems in Uganda with ACMV 1 sweeping down from the north and BSV 2 advancing from the south. <b>As</b> <b>you</b> <b>pointed</b> out there are three aspects; diagnosis, epidemiology and resistance or control. On the first, I consider that the best approach is for there to be regional diagnostic centres, say southern Africa, eastern Africa and western Africa. Having regional centres overcomes some of the problems of quarantine. These can be set up initially targeted at one crop and then expanded to take in other crops. If they are linked to an industrialised country lab or labs the development of diagnostics can be done by cooperation. The epidemiology is best done by NARS 3 and here, once again, some input from outside the lab is needed. Also, {{there needs to be a}} forum whereby experiences and information can be exchanged on a regular basis - how about an African Society for Plant Pathology? With the increased use of information technology there could also be a website or sites for efficient communication. On control or resistance there is a strong case to be made for the use of transgenic protection against viruses. I have just completed a study on uptake pathways from transgenic rice and it is likely that there will be an initiative for testing RYMV 4 transgenic protection in Africa. So I would support the initial step of having a conference but this needs to have a target. I would suggest that the initial target could be the setting up of an appropriate forum and ad hoc group of people who could advise on how individual countries can benefit from all major advances in tackling their virology problems.

500|$|Law {{professor}} and legal commentator Eugene Volokh commented in 2003 {{that regardless of}} the behavior of real frogs, the boiling frog story is useful as a metaphor, comparing it to the metaphor of an ostrich with its head in the sand. Economics Nobel laureate and New York Times op-ed writer Paul Krugman used the story as a metaphor in a July 2009 column, while pointing out that real frogs behave differently. Journalist James Fallows has been advocating since 2006 for people to stop retelling the story, describing it as a [...] "stupid canard" [...] and a [...] "myth". But following Krugman's column, he declared [...] "peace on the boiled frog front" [...] and said that using the story is fine <b>as</b> long <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>point</b> out it's not literally true.|$|R

50|$|The General tab {{consists}} of: Attacking Skills, Miscellaneous Skills, and Special Skills (which only apply {{if you are}} 4th job or sub class). Attacking {{skills are}} pretty straight forward. These are skills used to hit monsters, but some skills are passives that increase the attack power of your character <b>as</b> soon <b>as</b> <b>you</b> put skill <b>points</b> into it, meaning you don't have to press the skill to activate it. Miscellaneous skills are mostly buffs, support, and passive skills that increase the stat of your character. Special skills have the same idea except these don't require skill <b>points.</b> <b>You</b> can only get one skill from each row {{and to get a}} skill from all four rows requires your character to be at least level 190.

This is the normal appetite of men; I do not say there are not exceptions. There may be saints above the need and philanthropists below it. Opalstein, now he is a duke, may have got used to more than this; {{and when he was}} a convict may have got used to less. But the normality of the thing is enormous.
