5|$|In 1954, Regional Plan Association {{advocated}} for {{an extension of}} the BMT Canarsie Line from Eighth Avenue to Jersey City under the Hudson River.

The RPA also suggested having <b>a</b> <b>parking</b> <b>lot</b> there for access from the Pulaski Skyway and the New Jersey Turnpike. It was suggested that either the New York City Transit Authority, the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey or the Bi-State Metropolitan Rapid Transit Commission would do the construction.|$|E
