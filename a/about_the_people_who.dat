Most outsiders experience Huichol art as tourists in areas such as Guadalajara and Puerto Vallarta, without knowing anything <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> make the items, and the meanings of the designs. There are some notable Huichol artists in the yarn painting and beadwork fields, and both types of work have been commissioned for public display.|$|E

25|$|The {{general public}} are {{familiar}} with the names of the High Secure Hospitals due to the frequency that they are mentioned in the news reports <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> are sent there. Those in England include, Ashworth Hospital in Merseyside; Broadmoor Hospital in Crowthorne, Berkshire and Rampton Secure Hospital in Retford, Nottinghamshire and in Scotland is The State Hospital, Carstairs. Northern Ireland and the Isle of Man have their own Medium and Low Secure units but use the mainland faculties for High Secure, which smaller Channel Islands also transfer their patients to as Out of Area Referrals under the Mental Health Act 1983. Of the Medium Secure units, there are many more of these in number scattered throughout the UK. As of 2009 there were 27 women only units in England alone. Irish units include those at prisons in Portlaise, Castelrea, and Cork.|$|E
25|$|Around 100BC, the Adena {{evolved into}} the Hopewell people, who were named for the farm owned by Captain M. C. Hopewell, where {{evidence}} of their unique culture was discovered. Like the Adena, the Hopewell people participated in a mound-building culture. Their complex, large and technologically sophisticated earthworks {{can be found in}} modern-day Marietta, Newark, and Circleville. They were also a powerful trading society, managing to knit together a network that passed goods throughout a third of the continent. The Hopewell, however, disappeared from the Ohio Valley in about 600AD. Little is known <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> replaced them, although many Siouan-speaking peoples from the Plains & East Coast claim them as ancestors & say they lived throughout the Ohio region until approx. the 13th century. It is possible that the rise of the Mississippian Culture was the downfall of the Hopewell, as they began to rise to prominence on the Mississippi River around {{the same time that the}} Hopewell Culture died out.|$|E

Goodman described Mississippi Burning as [...] "a film that used {{the deaths of the}} boys as a means of solving the murders and the FBI being heroes." [...] Chaney stated, [...] "...the image that younger people got (from the film) about the times, about Mississippi itself and <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> participated in the movement being passive, was pretty negative and it didn't reflect the truth." [...] Stephen Schwerner, brother of Michael Schwerner, stated that Mississippi Burning was a [...] "terribly dishonest and very racist" [...] film that [...] "distorts the realities of 1964".|$|E
500|$|Nonetheless, {{conflicting}} {{accounts of}} Jenner's life continued to propagate {{at least as}} late as 2006. In some accounts of Jenner's evangelism, Jenner {{is referred to as}} [...] "Mr. Genor". One such account was recorded by Ray Comfort on the Living Waters website and then repeated in the 2006 book Spirit-led Evangelism: Reaching the Lost through Love and Power by Ché Ahn. Ahn is one of the storytellers who refers to Jenner as a [...] "little white-haired man", and Ahn concludes his story by writing that Jenner died two weeks after encountering Dixon, who is not named. These details contradict the information provided by Wilson, who writes in his biography that Jenner died more than twenty years after Dixon told him <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> had become Christians {{as a result of his}} evangelism.|$|E

A place that has left its mark on the world's imagination and a place where dreams can actually come true. I made this short film so I could share my thoughts on this incredibly special place and talk to others about theirs. It's {{not so much about}} this particular city but more <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> inhabit it." [...] He further said, [...] "It's a story about hope and dreams. It's a story about people making the impossible possible—whether it's Kanye West, James Franco, or a kid who's living on the streets on Hollywood Boulevard. It's a story about survival and about what it takes to become who you really want to be." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Why I Love You" [...] {{is a song}} by American hip hop artists Kanye West and Jay-Z, {{from their}} first {{collaborative}} album Watch the Throne (2011). The song features pop musician Mr Hudson who is signed to West's GOOD Music label. [...] "Why I Love You" [...] heavily samples French house duo Cassius' 2010 single [...] "I <3 U So", which itself is based upon a sample from the original 1971 version of [...] "I Feel a Song (In My Heart)" [...] by Sandra Richardson. The song almost entirely features Jay-Z rapping and only contains a few lines provided by West. Lyrically, the song is <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> have {{stood in the way}} of Jay-Z throughout the year and expresses themes of victory and anger. The song received positive reviews from critics who generally praised the production.|$|E
500|$|In 1889, Goodman Point Pueblo {{became the}} first pre-Columbian archaeological site in the Mesa Verde region to gain federal protection. It was the first such site to be {{protected}} in the US. Virginia McClurg was diligent in her efforts between 1887 and 1906 to inform the United States and European community {{of the importance of}} protecting the important historical material and dwellings in Mesa Verde. Her efforts included enlisting support from 250,000 women through the Federation of Women's Clubs, writing and having published poems in popular magazines, giving speeches domestically and internationally, and forming the Colorado Cliff Dwellers Association. [...] The Colorado Cliff Dwellers' purpose was to protect the resources of Colorado cliff dwellings, reclaiming as much of the original artifacts as possible and sharing information <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> dwelt there. [...] A fellow activist for protection of Mesa Verde and prehistoric archaeological sites included Lucy Peabody, who, located in Washington, D.C., met with members of Congress to further the cause. Former Mesa Verde National Park superintendent Robert Heyder communicated his belief that the park might have been far more significant with the hundreds of artifacts taken by Nordenskiöld.|$|E

500|$|When Stewie is {{fantasizing about}} murdering and harming Lois, he {{performs}} several karate and kung-fu moves. This is {{a reference to}} an individual whom Mark Hentemann, a writer for Family Guy, used to know. He was the boy who would come to school, car washes or other events and tell stories <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> {{he had been in}} physical fights with. During the scene when Stewie describes Lois as being the female version of Bonnie Hunt, MacFarlane comments that he feels bad about that joke, as just before it was broadcast— Hunt telephoned him on his mobile phone and told him about how much she enjoyed the show, however the gag was not removed due to its expected airing date being so close to when the telephone call was made. On the uncut version of this episode, there is a scene where Peter sleepily mistakes Stewie's mouth for Lois's genitals, muttering, [...] "Oh, you are so ready!" [...] The edited TV version does not have this part, but leaves in the first half, in which Peter sleepily mistakes Stewie's nose for Lois's nipple.|$|E
500|$|The {{controversy}} {{began when}} the industry newsletter [...] "The Jack Myers Report" [...] harshly criticized ABC for selling the doll, and other news outlets reported the snafu. [...] Bob Tedeschi of The New York Times stated, [...] "In the charge toward e-commerce revenues, ABC learned a useful lesson last week: Don't try to sell cuddly rag dolls depicting homicidal rapists". Angela Shapiro, president of ABC, said, [...] "I was insensitive and take total responsibility for it. I should have been sensitive {{to the history of}} the character and I wasn't". Another ABC executive stated, [...] "We didn't exercise proper sensitivity to the history of the character of Todd. [...] We have re-evaluated and decided not to sell the doll". [...] A doll of Todd's daughter, Starr, remained in ABC stores. Richard Roeper of the Chicago Sun-Times commented, [...] "I suppose ABC didn't have much of a choice but to pull the product--but I have to wonder <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> voiced those protests." [...] He added, [...] "It was a stupid SOCK DOLL based on a SOAP OPERA CHARACTER. If you're offended by that, how do you get through the day without succumbing to fits of hysterical outrage every five minutes?" ...|$|E
500|$|Ken Keeler, Bill Oakley, and Josh Weinstein all {{defend the}} episode in its DVD commentary. Keeler asserts, [...] "I am very, {{very proud of}} the job I did on this episode. This is the best episode of {{television}} I feel I ever wrote." [...] He describes the episode as a commentary on [...] "people who like things just the way they are", and remarks, [...] "It never seems to have occurred to anyone that this episode is <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> hate it." [...] However, Keeler says that some of the dialogue was changed from his original draft, making this point less obvious. Oakley and Weinstein explain that they wanted to push the boundaries of the series while working as show-runners, and advise viewers to treat [...] "The Principal and the Pauper" [...] as an [...] "experiment". They surmise that the negative reception was partly {{due to the fact that}} it was not immediately apparent to viewers that this was such an episode (as opposed to, for example, [...] "The Simpsons Spin-Off Showcase"). They also describe the ending of the episode as an attempt to reset the continuity and allow fans to consider the episode as non-canonical, divorced from the larger series.|$|E

500|$|Many reviewers also contrasted its {{portrayal}} of main character Honey {{as a powerful}} figure with how it also shows off her body through her nude transformation sequences. [...] Susan J. Napier, author of , distinguished the series from more pornographic anime such as Wicked City, Twin Dolls, and La Blue Girl. [...] Napier thought that the series [...] "sends mixed messages" [...] because even though Honey has great strength and heroism, her transformations are very sexual in nature. [...] She wrote that [...] "the presumably male viewer is invited in, {{to participate in the}} unclothing and clothing of her nude body, while both male and female viewer alike are allowed the vicarious participation in the ecstatic transformation process", but quickly added: [...] "Despite the regressive and voyeuristic aspects of her characterization, she is still clearly the film's hero, one worthy of admiration and emulation... in the film's several violent scenes she more than holds her own." [...] Dozier did not share that sentiment: she said [...] "Honey does have some appeal as a fighter and as someone who cares very much <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> are important to her, but her android past and her family life aren't explored too deeply—mostly, she's too busy getting into compromising situations and fighting evil." ...|$|E
500|$|At Metacritic, which assigns a {{normalized}} rating out of 100 to {{reviews from}} mainstream critics, the album received an average score of 79, based on 24 professional critic reviews, which indicates [...] "generally favorable reviews". Dan Martin from NME compared the album to Green Day's American Idiot, positing that [...] "it's {{a piece of}} work that will challenge every preconception you ever had <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> made it." [...] Tim Karan of Alternative Press called The Black Parade [...] "MCR's whole raison d'etre rolled up into one mega-decibel calling card". Ed Thompson of IGN stated, [...] "The Black Parade is a rock and roll gem that celebrates everything that was over the top about the 1970s rock scene." [...] David Fricke of Rolling Stone praised the classic rock feel of the album. Entertainment Weekly stated that [...] "On their third studio album, a musical H-bomb of an effort, the Jersey quintet combine the rock-opera pomp of Queen with the darker, dirtier tones of their screamo past: Call it a Bro-hemian Rhapsody. Even without its broad concept — a dying cancer patient seeks revenge and redemption — Parade stands {{as one of the most}} cohesive, engaging rock records of 2006." [...] Robert Christgau gave the album a two-star honorable mention (...) and said, [...] "In prog, a good sense of humor means so much." ...|$|E
500|$|Jacob Acaye, {{the former}} child soldier {{featured}} in the film, supported the video and defended its makers. In response to Ugandans saying that the film was out-of-date, Jacob stated that, [...] "It is not too late, because all this fighting and suffering {{is still going on}} elsewhere. Until now, the war that was going on has been a silent war. People did not really know about it. Now what was happening in Gulu is still going on elsewhere in the Central African Republic and in Congo. What <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> are suffering over there? They are going through what we were going through." [...] It was noted by Los Angeles Times journalists Lindsay Branham and Jocelyn Kelly that a number of people living in the areas where the LRA is currently active have previously called for attention and advocacy to be directed at the issue. Julien Marneffe, a worker for Catholic Relief Services in Goma said [...] "it's been an undeniable success -- and one all humanitarian organizations working in this area can be happy about," [...] but added to [...] "be careful not to oversimplify the issue" [...] and worried that the interest might be short lived when [...] "another crisis or another video will be the next online trend, and I fear that most people will forget about the problems of the LRA." ...|$|E
