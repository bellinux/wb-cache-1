5|$|Similar {{to other}} iguanodonts, {{the teeth of}} Eolambia are {{arranged}} in tightly-spaced and interlocking rows. At any given time, each of the 32 maxillary tooth sockets holds three teeth, while each of the 30 dentary tooth sockets holds four teeth. Out of these, two of the teeth in each socket are replacement teeth like those of Probactrosaurus; the others are active teeth. Rvery <b>active</b> <b>tooth</b> has one wear facet. Like Probactrosaurus, Gongpoquansaurus, Protohadros, and other hadrosauroids, each maxillary tooth crown has only one ridge, which is slightly offset towards the midline of the mouth. Meanwhile, each dentary tooth crown characteristically bears a primary ridge, and an accessory ridge closer to the midline of the mouth, a condition which is also present in Protohadros and other hadrosauroids. All of the crowns also bear small, denticle-like serrations {{on the front and}} rear edges, which is also seen in Probactrosaurus.|$|E
5|$|The slender teeth had {{slightly}} curved crowns, {{which were}} oval in cross-section. The {{teeth in the}} lower jaw may have been 20–30% smaller {{than those in the}} upper jaw, but few are known, and they are of uncertain maturity. Apart from this, the teeth were identical. Under each <b>active</b> <b>tooth</b> there was a column of nine replacement teeth within the jaw. With 68 columns in the upper jaws and 60 columns in the lower jaws, these so-called dental batteries (also present in hadrosaurs and ceratopsians) comprised a total of more than 500 active and replacement teeth. Dental batteries erupted in unison, not each column individually. The enamel on the teeth of Nigersaurus was highly asymmetrical, ten times thicker on the outwards facing side than on the inner side. This condition is otherwise known only in advanced ornithischians.|$|E
50|$|The {{skull of}} Nigersaurus was delicate, {{with the four}} side fenestrae (openings in the skull) larger than in other sauropodomorphs. The total area of bone {{connecting}} the muzzle {{to the back of}} the skull was only 1.0 cm2. These connecting struts of bones were usually less than 2 mm thick. Despite this, the skull was resistant to the sustained shearing of the teeth. Another unique trait it had among sauropodomorphs was a closed supratemporal fenestra. The nasal openings, the bony nostrils, were elongated. Though the nasal bones are not completely known, it appears the front margin of the bony nostril was closer to the snout than in other diplodocoids. The snout was also proportionately shorter, and the tooth row was not at all prognathous, the snout tip not protruding relative to the remainder of the tooth series. The maxillary tooth row was in its entirety transversely rotated, its normal rear 90° everted towards the front. This was matched by an identical rotation of the dentary of the lower jaw. As a result, no other tetrapod had all of its teeth located as far to the front as Nigersaurus.The slender teeth had slightly curved crowns, which were oval in cross-section. The teeth in the lower jaw may have been 20-30% smaller than those in the upper jaw, but few are known, and they are of uncertain maturity. Apart from this, the teeth were identical.

Methods: Twenty patients all requiring first premolar extractions were selected and treated with conventional straight wire mechanotherapy. Canine retraction was done using 125 g Nitinol closed coil springs. The maxillary canine on one side served as the experimental site while the contralateral canine served as the control. GCF was collected from the canines before initiation of retraction, then 1 hour after initiating canine retraction, followed by 1 day, 7 days, 14 days and 21 days. GCF LDH levels were estimated and compared with the control site. Results: The results revealed significantly higher LDH levels on the 7 th, 14 th and 21 st day at the sites where orthodontic force had been applied. The levels also showed a significant increase from 0 hour to the 21 st day. Peak levels were seen on 14 th and 21 st day following initiation of retraction.

40|$|Background: Although caries and {{malocclusion}} {{occur with}} a high prevalence in Chinese school-age children, there were no appropriate instrument to assess the oral health-related quality of life (OHRQoL) for this population. The aim of our study {{was to develop a}} Chinese (Mandarin) version of the Child Oral Health Impact Profile-Short Form 19 (COHIP-SF 19) and provide a preliminary test of its psychometric properties. Methods: The Chinese version of COHIP-SF 19 was developed through a standard translation and back translation procedure. The psychometric properties of the instrument were tested among 644 school-age children in Beijing, China, including the internal consistency, test-retest reliability, discriminant and convergent validity. A Mann-Whitney U test was used to determine the capability of the instrument to differentiate children with different caries and malocclusion outcomes. And partial Spearman correlations were used to determine the relationships between the OHRQoL scores and clinical-severity indicators and self-perceived health ratings, respectively. Results: Chinese school-age children had relatively high OHRQoL scores, {{in spite of the fact}} that oral impacts were quite common (56. 3 %).

40|$|Quietness and reliability, {{together}} with efficiency and lightweight design, are key requirements {{to compete in}} current mechanical industry. Within the latter, gearboxes {{play an important role}} as the usual choice to transmit mechanical power with high energy density, especially when using cylindrical involute gears. Noise and vibration performance are strongly influenced by tooth microgeometry modifications. Typical modifications are applied along the profile and the lead of the teeth. Profile modifications mainly compensate for tooth deflections; lead modifications mainly compensate for angular misalignments. Both modification types yield optimal performance at a given operating condition (e. g. nominal transmitted torque under ideal alignment), minimizing the meshing excitation. One key operating condition for the gear pair is represented by the instantaneous centre distance between the gears. Centre distance variations affect mainly the pressure angle for the transmitted contact force, the total contact ratio and the <b>active</b> <b>tooth</b> height. Furthermore after a change in centre distance, the contacting surfaces on the tooth flanks shift with respect to each other; this yields a mismatch with respect to the theoretical start for the tooth profile modifications. A precision gear test rig, where operating conditions can be varied and tightly controlled, is used in this paper to evaluate the effects of centre distance variations on the dynamic behaviour of a spur gear pair. The dynamic behaviour is characterized relying on the so-called Static Transmission Error (STE). Spectral analysis of the STE provides an indication of the internal excitation generated by gear meshing. Results show that the STE is sensitive to small changes in centre distance (in the order of 0. 1 % of the nominal value). In particular, it is also observed that the transmitted torque for obtaining minimum STE peak to peak value changes significantly {{as a function of the}} centre distance. status: submitte...|$|E
40|$|During the <b>active</b> <b>tooth</b> {{eruption}} process, {{structural changes}} in the lamina propria are necessary to provide extracellular matrix remodelling and {{for the establishment of}} the eruptive pathway. A large number of resident cells, recruited cells and proteases have been demonstrated in the eruptive process, but the participation of MMP- 9 and mast cells has not yet been demonstrated. In this study, we set out to evaluate the intensity of MMP- 9 immunoexpression, the frequency of mast cells and the correlation between the incidence of mast cells and bone resorption in different phases of tooth eruption. Fragments of maxilla containing first molars, obtained from 9 -, 11 -, 13 - and 16 -day-old rats, were fixed in 4 % formaldehyde, decalcified and embedded in paraffin. Sagittal sections were stained with Masson's trichrome or submitted to the tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase method for quantification of osteoclasts. Sections stained by 1 % toluidine blue were used for quantification of metachromatic mast cells mm- 2 of lamina propria. The expression of MMP- 9 in the lamina propria was evaluated by immunohistochemistry. In the 9 -day-old rats, the lamina propria contained few mast cells and occasional osteoclasts were found in the bone surface overlying the occlusal portion of the tooth germs. Otherwise, {{a significant increase in the}} number of mast cells was observed in the intra-osseous phase of tooth eruption (11 -day-old rats), period in which numerous TRAP-positive osteoclasts were found in the bone surface. MMP- 9 immunolabelling was detected in fibroblasts, mast cells and macrophage-like cells of the lamina propria in all ages studied. However, an enhanced immunolabelling was evident in the advanced phase of tooth eruption (16 -day-old rats). During the intra-osseous phase, the parallel between the high frequency of both mast cells and osteoclasts suggests that mast cells could exert a paracrine function on the osteoclasts and then stimulate bone resorption. The immunoexpression of MMP- 9 in different cells of lamina propria, including mast cells, indicates that this enzyme participates in the degradation of ECM, mainly during late phase of mucosal penetration. Thus mast cells and MMP- 9 are involved in the complex process of degradation of the eruptive pathway extracellular matrix...|$|E

40|$|The thesis {{explores the}} canine oral cavity, namely, the teeth {{and the most}} common dental diseases. Dental injury and disease in dogs is a topic of growing {{interest}} in veterinary science. The theoretical section discusses the anatomy of the head, oral cavity and teeth. It presents general knowledge of veterinary dentistry {{and a list of}} the most common oral cavity diseases. The practical section explores the suitability and the effectiveness of two prevention methods against the build-up of dental plaque, respectively, against the spread of periodontitis. 	Diseases affecting the periodontium are increasingly common in dogs; they are deemed to be the most frequent diseases affecting small animals above five years of age. There are two most common periodontal diseases. The first, gingivitis, is a reversible inflammation of the gum. The second, periodontitis, is essentially irreversible without specialized treatment and often leads to loss of teeth. 	The major criterion for maintaining a healthy oral cavity is prevention. Therefore, two methods of home-based prevention are compared in the practical part of the thesis. First, all patients underwent a full-scale dental treatment in a veterinary centre, that is, a comprehensive ultrasonic cleaning and polishing with dental cleaning paste. Then, ascophyllum nodosum, a seaweed also known as Norwegian kelp, was mixed within the daily food ration of half of the patients. In this way, the teeth were being cleaned passively. The second half of the patients had their teeth cleaned with Orozyme, an enzyme-formula oral hygiene gel for dogs, and this way an <b>active</b> <b>teeth</b> cleaning method was explored. Six weeks after the initial dental treatment, a dental plaque identification test was carried out in a veterinary centre. Statistical analysis of the resulting data did not signal substantial differences between the treatment with Norwegian kelp and that of using the oral gel.

40|$|Small {{variations}} in signalling pathways {{have been linked}} to phenotypic diversity and speciation. In vertebrates, teeth represent a reservoir of adaptive morphological structures that are prone to evolutionary change. Cyprinid fish display an impressive diversity in tooth number, but the signals that generate such diversity are unknown. Here, we show that retinoic acid (RA) availability influences tooth number size in Cyprinids. Heterozygous adult zebrafish heterozygous for the cyp 26 b 1 mutant that encodes an enzyme able to degrade RA possess an extra tooth in the ventral row. Expression analysis of pharyngeal mesenchyme markers such as dlx 2 a and lhx 6 shows lateral, anterior and dorsal expansion of these markers in RA-treated embryos, whereas the expression of the dental epithelium markers dlx 2 b and dlx 3 b is unchanged.

40|$|Chitons (class Polyplacophora) are benthic grazing {{molluscs}} with an eight-part aragonitic shell armature. The radula, {{a serial}} tooth ribbon that extends internally {{more than half}} the length of the body, is mineralised on the <b>active</b> feeding <b>teeth</b> with iron magnetite apparently as an adaptation to constant grazing on rocky substrates. As the anterior feeding teeth are eroded they are shed and replaced with a new row. The efficient mineralisation and function of the radula could hypothetically be affected by changing oceans in two ways: changes in seawater chemistry (pH and pCO 2) may impact the biomineralisation pathway, potentially leading to a weaker or altered density of the feeding teeth; rising temperatures could increase activity levels in these ectothermic animals, and higher feeding rates could increase wear on the feeding teeth beyond the animals' ability to synthesise, mineralise, and replace radular rows. We therefore examined the effects of pH and temperature on growth and integrity in the radula of the chiton Leptochiton asellus. Our experiment implemented three temperature (10, 15, 20 °C) and two pCO 2 treatments (400 µatm, pH 8. 0; 2000 µatm, pH 7. 5) for six treatment groups. Animals (n = 50) were acclimated to the treatment conditions for a period of 4 weeks. This is sufficient time for growth of ca. 7 - 9 new tooth rows or 20 % turnover of the mineralised portion.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to compare the effects of active and passive lacebacks on antero-posterior {{position}} of maxillary first molars and central incisors during leveling phase. Twenty-three subjects with Class I and Class II malocclusion were treated with first premolars extraction using preadjusted appliances (MBT 0. 022 -inch brackets). The leveling phase was performed with stainless steel archwires only. The sample was divided into 2 groups: 14 subjects received active lacebacks (Group 1) and 9 subjects received passive lacebacks (Group 2). Lacebacks were made from 0. 008 -inch ligature wire.

Twelve patients requiring all first premolar extractions were selected and treated with conventional straight wire mechanotherapy. Canine retraction was done using Nitinol closed coil springs. Maxillary canine on one side acted as experiment site while the contralateral canine acted as control. GCF was collected from around the canines using periopaper strips before initiation of canine retraction, 1 hour after, 1 day, 7 days, 14 days and 21 days. The collected samples were analyzed quantitatively, clinically, using the Periotron and qualitatively, in the laboratory, using the spectrophotometer for the previously mentioned parameters and the data were analyzed using the SPSS computer program. The GCF volume even though was found to be elevated at the experimental side, it was not statistically significant from the control side. The GCF ALP enzyme showed a variation during orthodontic tooth movement. Its peak level in the experimental side was reached on the 14 th day,however, it decreased again at the 21 st day. The control side also showed increased insignificant elevation throughout the study period. The GCF NTx marker also showed a statistically significant increase in the level on the 14 th and 21 st days at the side which underwent orthodontic tooth movement.

Laser capture microdissection was used to isolate odontoblasts and ameloblasts from human tooth buds (15 - 20 week gestational age) from 4 fetuses. RNA was examined using Agilent 41 k whole genome arrays at 2 different stages of enamel formation, presecretory and secretory. Probe detection was considered against the array negative control to control for background noise. Differential expression was examined using Significance Analysis of Microarrays (SAM) 4. 0 between different cell types and developmental stages with a false discovery rate of 20 %. Pathway analysis was conducted using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis software. We found that during primary tooth formation, odontoblasts expressed 14, 802 genes, presecretory ameloblasts 15, 179 genes and secretory ameloblasts 14, 526 genes. Genes known to be <b>active</b> during <b>tooth</b> development for each cell type (eg COL 1 A 1, AMELX) were shown to be expressed by our approach. Exploring further into the list of differentially expressed genes between the motile odontoblasts and non-motile presecretory ameloblasts we found several genes of interest that could be involved in cell movement (FN 1, LUM, ASTN 1). Furthermore, our analysis indicated that the Phospholipase C and ERK 5 pathways, that are important for cell movement, were activated in the motile odontoblasts. In addition our pathway analysis identified WNT 3 A and TGFB 1 as important upstream contributors. Recent studies implicate these genes in the development of Schimke immuno-osseous dysplasia. The utility of laser capture microdissection can be a valuable tool in the examination of specific tissues or cell populations present in human tooth buds.

Data were analyzed using student t-test (P < 0. 05). CEO, eugenol, and eugenyl-acetate significantly decreased the decalcification of tooth by the apple juice to only 17, 24, and 21 mgL− 1, respectively. Hemolytic activity on human erythrocytes was studied to exclude the possibility of further associated cytotoxicity. It was observed that the CEO and its two lead molecules inhibit the decalcification and/or promote the remineralization caused by the apple juices. The effect of the test compounds appears to be distinct like that of fluoride treatment. CEO may, therefore, serve to be a promisin...|$|R
40|$|After the {{detection}} of Dlx and Msx genes in overlapping domains along maxillary and mandibular processes, a homeobox odontogenic code has been proposed to explain the interaction between different homeobox genes during dental lamina patterning. No role {{has so far been}} assigned to the Hox gene network in the homeobox odontogenic code due to studies on specific Hox genes and evolutionary considerations. Despite its involvement in early patterning during embryonal development, the HOX gene network, the most repeat-poor regions of the human genome, controls the phenotype identity of adult eukaryotic cells. Here, according to our results, the HOX gene network appears to be <b>active</b> in human <b>tooth</b> germs between 18 and 24 weeks of development. The immunohistochemical localization of specific HOX proteins mostly concerns the epithelial tooth germ compartment. Furthermore, only a few genes of the network are active in embryonal retromolar tissues, as well as in ectomesenchymal dental pulp cells (DPC) grown in vitro from adult human molar. Exposure of DPCs to cAMP induces the expression of from three to nine total HOX genes of the network in parallel with phenotype modifications with traits of neuronal differentiation. Our observations suggest that: (i) by combining its component genes, the HOX gene network determines the phenotype identity of epithelial and ectomesenchymal cells interacting in the generation of human tooth germ; (ii) cAMP treatment activates the HOX network and induces, in parallel, a neuronal-like phenotype in human primary ectomesenchymal dental pulp cells...|$|R

30|$|The main {{objective}} of the re-adhesion control strategy is to maintain the slip velocity at the optimal value. It is compulsory to derive or estimate the optimum slip ratio for specific vehicle velocity and environmental conditions. The slip ratio {{can be defined as}} a relative velocity proportion in the contact area. Hence, the evaluation performance of the slip ratio is directly coupled with the integrity of the vehicle speed information. Many methods have been suggested to estimate the railway vehicle velocity by using magnetic sensors such as Hall effect gear <b>tooth</b> <b>active</b> speed sensor, which are very accurate in velocity measurement. However, these methods are very expensive and sensitive to wheel–rail contact conditions (rain, sand, snow, dew, etc.). The other way of acquiring velocity information is to utilize global positioning system (GPS) signals. There are many well-known techniques in the literature that combine GPS information with other sensors such as the wheel speed sensor, accelerometer and inertial measurement unit (IMU) [1, 2, 3, 4]. This kind of information can be also obtained by integrating indirect methods and different estimation approaches. One of these methods is detecting the excitations resulted from track irregularities with acceleration and angular rate measurements at different wheelsets, and another is through measurement of the time shift between the dynamic responses of two wheelsets with respect to the same track irregularity [5]. In addition, robust velocity estimation involving establishment of a dynamic friction model has also been investigated [6]. However, the slip/slide control systems based on vehicle velocity estimation do not meet the safety concerns of industrial applications. These systems demand an additional estimation process to track the optimal slip ratio.|$|R
40|$|Development of the {{mammalian}} tooth {{has been}} intensively studied {{as a model}} system for epithelial/mesenchymal interactions during organogenesis, and {{progress has been made}} in identifying key molecules involved in this signaling. We show that activin βA is expressed in presumptive tooth-germ mesenchyme and is thus a candidate for a signaling molecule in tooth development. Analysis of tooth development in activin βA mutant embryos shows that incisor and mandibular molar teeth fail to develop beyond the bud stage. Activin βA is thus an essential component of tooth development. Development of maxillary molars, however, is unaffected in the mutants. Using tissue recombination experiments we show that activin is required in the mesenchyme prior to bud formation and that although activin signaling from mesenchyme to epithelium takes place, mutant epithelium retains its ability to support tooth development. Implantation of beads soaked in activin A, into developing mandibles, is able to completely rescue tooth development from E 11. 5, but not E 12. 5 or E 13. 5, confirming that activin is an early, essential mesenchyme signal required before tooth bud formation. Normal development of maxillary molars in the absence of activin shows a position specific role for this pathway in development of dentition. Functional redundancy with activin B or other TGFβ family members that bind to activin receptors cannot explain development of maxillary molars in the mutants since the activin-signaling pathway appears not to be <b>active</b> in these <b>tooth</b> germs. The early requirement for activin signaling in the mesenchyme in incisor and mandibular molar tooth germs must be carried-out in maxillary molar mesenchyme by other independent signaling pathways...|$|R
40|$|AIM: The {{purpose of}} this {{randomized}} split-mouth clinical trial {{was to determine the}} active tactile sensibility between single-tooth implants and opposing natural teeth and to compare it with the tactile sensibility of pairs of natural teeth on the contralateral side in the same mouth (intraindividual comparison). MATERIAL AND METHODS: The hypothesis was that the active tactile sensibilities of the implant side and control side are equivalent. Sixty two subjects (n= 36 from Bonn, n= 26 from Bern) with single-tooth implants (22 anterior and 40 posterior dental implants) were asked to bite on narrow copper foil strips varying in thickness (5 - 200 microm) and {{to decide whether or not}} they were able to identify a foreign body between their <b>teeth.</b> <b>Active</b> tactile sensibility was defined as the 50 % threshold of correct answers estimated by means of the Weibull distribution. RESULTS: The results obtained for the interocclusal perception sensibility differed between subjects far more than they differed between natural teeth and implants in the same individual [implant/natural tooth: 16. 7 +/- 11. 3 microm (0. 6 - 53. 1 microm); natural tooth/natural tooth: 14. 3 +/- 10. 6 microm (0. 5 - 68. 2 microm) ]. The intraindividual differences only amounted to a mean value of 2. 4 +/- 9. 4 microm (- 15. 1 to 27. 5 microm). The result of our statistical calculations showed that the active tactile sensibility of single-tooth implants, both in the anterior and posterior region of the mouth, in combination with a natural opposing tooth is similar to that of pairs of opposing natural teeth (double t-test, equivalence margin: +/- 8 microm, P 80 %). Hence, the implants could be integrated in the stomatognathic control circuit...|$|R
40|$|The {{relationship}} between early childhood caries (ECC) and obesity is controversial. This cross-sectional survey investigated this association in children from low-income families in Goiania, Goias, Brazil {{and considered the}} role of several social determinants. A questionnaire examining {{the characteristics of the}} children and their families was administered to the primary caregiver during home visits. In addition, children (approximately 6 years of age) had their height, weight, and tooth condition assessed. The primary ECC outcome was categorized as one of the following: caries experience (decayed, missing, filled tooth: “dmft” index > 0), <b>active</b> ECC (decayed <b>teeth</b> > 0), or active severe ECC (decayed teeth ≥ 6). Descriptive, bivariate and logistic regression analyses were conducted. The participants in the current study consisted of 269 caregiver-child dyads, 88. 5 % of whom were included in the Family Health Program. Caregivers were mostly mothers (67. 7 %), were 35. 3 ± 10. 0 years old on average and had 9. 8 ± 3. 1 years of formal education. The mean family income was 2. 3 ± 1. 5 times greater than the Brazilian minimum wage. On average, the children in the current study were 68. 7 ± 3. 8 months old. Of these, 51. 7 % were boys, 23. 4 % were overweight or obese, 45. 0 % had active ECC, and 17. 1 % had severe ECC. The average body mass index (BMI) of the children was 15. 9 ± 2. 2, and their dmft index was 2. 5 ± 3. 2. BMI was not associated with any of the three categories of dental caries (p > 0. 05). In contrast, higher family incomes were significantly associated with the lack of caries experience in children (OR 1. 22, 95 %CI 1. 01 – 1. 50), but the mother’s level of education was not significantly associated with ECC...|$|R
