An <b>automatic</b> <b>feeding</b> device is often required to convey parts to complete a series of processes in a modern production line. But the traditional <b>automatic</b> <b>feeding</b> device has problems of large volume, high noise and low efficiency. It has reduced the efficiency of production line. So it is necessary to make innovation for the <b>automatic</b> <b>feeding</b> system. A new type of <b>automatic</b> <b>feeding</b> device based on linear servo motor is proposed in the paper. This device overcomes some disadvantages of the traditional <b>automatic</b> <b>feeding</b> device. 1...|$|R

40|$|Aim of {{the current}} study was to {{evaluate}} the clinical/health status of veal calves in 3 farms that adopt large group housing and <b>automatic</b> <b>feeding</b> stations in Italy. Visits were scheduled in three phases of the rearing cycle (early, middle, and end). Results showed a high incidence of coughing, skin infection and bloated rumen particularly in the middle phase while cross-sucking signs were present at the early stage when calves’ nibbling proclivity is still high. Throughout the rearing cycle, the frequency of bursitis increased reaching 53 % of calves at the end. The percentage of calves with a poorer body condition than the mid-range of the batch raised gradually as well, likely due to the non-proportioned teat/calves ratio that increases competition for feed and reduces milk intake of the low ranking animals. The remarked growth differences among pen-mates and the mortality rate close to 7 % showed by the use of <b>automatic</b> <b>feeding</b> devices for milk delivery seem not compensating the lower labour demand, therefore its sustainability at the present status is doubtful both for the veal calves’ welfare and the farm incomes...|$|R
