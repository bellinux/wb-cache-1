25|$|There are no railways, waterways, ports or {{harbours}} on the island. Loading jetties {{are located}} at Kingston and Cascade, but ships cannot {{get close to}} either of them. When a supply ship arrives, it is emptied by whaleboats towed by launches, five tonnes at a time. Which jetty is used depends on the prevailing weather of the day; the jetty on the leeward {{side of the island}} is often used. If the wind changes significantly during unloading/loading, the ship will move <b>around</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> side. Visitors often gather to watch the activity when a supply ship arrives.|$|E
2500|$|The {{search was}} led by Police Inspector Oppegård. On 8 November a team of twenty-eight people started search for the {{aircraft}} in the Hummelfjell area, based on the observations of a large sound. They set up a base of operations at the farm at Brend, {{who were able to}} feed and house the entire group of military and volunteer personnel. They had two M29 Weasel belted vehicles, but these could not be used. A search area of [...] was designated between Gråhøgda and Grøtvolen. Simultaneously a group of Home Guard personnel were sent <b>around</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> side of the mountain, to climb and search it from the Atna side.|$|E

2500|$|Structure 5 (also {{known as}} Palace 5) {{is the highest}} palace {{structure}} at Tamarindito. The palace's interior measured [...] {{and it had a}} vaulted roof. The interior contained only one or possibly two simple rooms without benches. The structure faced north and a single doorway has been uncovered in that side, although it is possible that a second doorway also existed in the north side. Unusually this meant that the building faced away from GroupA's Main Plaza. A wide stairway climbed the structure from the Plaza but it was necessary to walk <b>around</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> side of the structure to gain access. The facade of Structure 5 overlooks Structure 7 immediately to the north. Investigations of the palace have discovered an earlier substructure [...] below a second stucco floor. Structure 5 may be the oldest structure in Group A.|$|E
2500|$|On {{systems with}} {{double-ended}} tram cars capable of running in both directions, the trolley pole {{must always be}} pulled behind the car and not pushed, or [...] "dewiring" [...] is very likely, which can cause damage to the overhead wires. At terminus points, the conductor must turn the trolley pole around to face the correct direction, pulling it off the wire either with a rope or a pole and walking it <b>around</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> end. In some cases, two trolley poles are provided, one for each direction: {{in this case it}} is a matter of raising one and lowering the other. Since the operator could raise the pole at one end whilst the conductor lowered the other, this saved time and was much easier for the conductor. Care had to be taken to raise the downed pole first, to eliminate the damage caused by arcing between the pole and wire. In the US, the dual-pole system was the most common arrangement on double-ended vehicles. However, pushing of the pole (called [...] "back-poling" [...] in the US or [...] "spear-poling" [...] in Australia), was quite common where the trams were moving at slow speeds, such as at wye terminals (also known as reversers) and whilst backing into the sheds.|$|E
2500|$|The {{circular}} rotunda enclosed {{a central}} paved courtyard with a [...] "great well" [...] in the middle. The exterior {{wall of the}} rotunda had six circular towers regularly spaced, apart from the two which protected the main, eastern entrance. The Commissioners reported that the rotunda contained twelve rooms [...] "downstairs" [...] and [...] "about forty rooms from the first story upwards". About 30 yards (27 metres) out from the rotunda was a plain circular curtain wall enclosing a bailey our outer court. The curtain had only two towers which formed a gatehouse for the main entrance at the western side, meaning that any attackers who forced this gate {{would have had to}} make their way <b>around</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> side of the bailey to find the rotunda entrance. The curtain wall was surrounded by a large circular moat. Opposite the rotunda entrance was a postern, a small secondary gate for pedestrians. The postern and the main gate were linked to the rotunda by walled passages which divided the bailey. It is known from the castle records that two stone buildings were built in the bailey from 1369 to 1377, although their form and function are unknown. Records also suggest that the castle had a fish pond and a garden. The whole building was estimated by the Commissioners to [...] "upwards of three acres of land".|$|E

After an aimless couple of months (Nash lost a {{retirement}} match), of just wandering <b>around</b> being pests <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> talent, they won the WCW World Tag Team Championship one last time in December 1999. It did not last, however, as Hall legitimately no-showed an event, thus the title was stripped from them, and the team was dissolved.|$|R

Medway Dragons were one of two clubs based <b>around</b> London <b>to</b> apply, <b>the</b> <b>other</b> being Hemel Stags, and would have joined London Broncos and London Skolars as clubs in the professional structure but pulled out as they chose to continue competing in the London and South League.|$|R
5000|$|Behind {{the back}} Crossover (Also {{known as the}} [...] "Shake and Bake"): Behind the back {{crossover}} {{is the same as}} the usual crossover except the ball is dribbled behind the player. Another version of this move is called the [...] "wraparound," [...] in which the player cups the ball in his hand and brings it <b>around</b> his back <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> side of his body in one quick, smooth motion. Jamal Crawford is known for this trick.|$|R
5000|$|The [...] "shaky cam" [...] {{style was}} named, and given new energy, in 1981. In the film The Evil Dead, {{director}} Sam Raimi ordered Tim Philo, his cinematographer, to bolt a camera to a two-by-four-inch piece of lumber, 22 inches long, and have two strong grips hold it and run down a city block, bumping over fallen bodies, following a female character, {{after which the}} camera was swung roughly <b>around</b> <b>to</b> go <b>the</b> <b>other</b> way. Another shaky camera effect invented on that film was one the crew called [...] "Blank-O-Cam", where the cameraman would lie on a blanket and be carried in it by four grips, the camera pointed forward near ground level to track people's feet. Further shaky cam techniques were employed by Raimi on his subsequent films including Crimewave in 1985.|$|R

500|$|Courses {{range from}} beaches with debris-littered water to swamps and ice-covered mountains. The game has its {{variant of the}} {{traditional}} race track, but also introduces a new course type known as a Suicide course. Instead of being a continuous loop, these tracks have checkpoints {{at either end of}} the course, and the starting grid in the center. [...] Riders race to one end, then turn <b>around</b> <b>to</b> head for <b>the</b> <b>other</b> checkpoint, repeating <b>the</b> process until all laps are complete. [...] This provides a new gameplay dynamic as often the player must navigate oncoming traffic.|$|R
25|$|The closest open {{clusters}} {{can have}} their distance measured directly by one of two methods. First, the parallax (the small change in apparent position {{over the course of}} a year caused by the Earth moving from one side of its orbit <b>around</b> <b>the</b> Sun <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>other)</b> of stars in close open clusters can be measured, like other individual stars. Clusters such as the Pleiades, Hyades and a few others within about 500light years are close enough for this method to be viable, and results from the Hipparcos position-measuring satellite yielded accurate distances for several clusters.|$|R

50|$|Initially {{the rules}} were decided by the Northern Rugby Football Union, today's Rugby Football League, the {{governing}} body for rugby league in the United Kingdom. As <b>the</b> sport spread <b>to</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> world, <b>other</b> rugby leagues were established, notably in Australia, France and New Zealand, a more international approach was adopted. In 1948, the International Rugby League Board (IRLB) was formed. Initially the RFL retained this responsibility for the Laws while it was seen how the new Board would develop. The IRLB was invested with responsibility for the Laws later.|$|R

500|$|Geier {{was ordered}} under the {{contract}} name [...] "F" [...] and was laid {{down at the}} Imperial Dockyard in Wilhelmshaven in 1893. She was launched on 18 October 1894, after which fitting-out work commenced. During her launching ceremony, Vizeadmiral (Vice Admiral) Victor Valois christened the ship. She was commissioned into the German Navy on 24 October 1895 for sea trials. Her trials were completed on 21 January 1896, and she was decommissioned temporarily in Kiel. During construction, her design was slightly modified based on experience from her sister ships that had already completed their sea trials. Geiers displacement was increased slightly by <b>around</b> [...] compared <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> ships of <b>the</b> class and her stern was modified.|$|R
50|$|The {{character}} of Charley is empowering {{in the sense}} that he frees himself rather than someone else freeing him. He also defeats the enemy and refuses to support white societal view of a respectable black man. Throughout the film, he asserts himself against racist white people and gains the admiration of those <b>around</b> him. Similar <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> protagonist in most other Blaxploitation films, Charley has sexual allure and gratifies a woman in the beginning. Furthermore, his sexual act was an act of white defiance in itself as the white men watched. In Blaxploitation films, the protagonist may use sex as white defiance, sometimes by sleeping with white women. Furthermore, Blaxploitation often includes violence, blood, gore and sex to attract an audience. The Legend of Nigger Charley includes all of the above.|$|R
50|$|The {{police found}} {{themselves}} trapped {{at the south}} side of the street because a gang of roughs had raised the bridge.

Here, the mob once again turned <b>around</b> and retreated <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> side of <b>the</b> bridge while being fired upon by the police and beaten by their clubs. Many reporters were at the scene of the conflict and they reported the typical clashes of that day consisted of guerrilla warfare, when cavalry or police approached, a crowd would part and then close behind it while many threw stones and pieces of wood and coal.|$|R
