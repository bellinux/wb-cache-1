60|$|Then {{the call}} came and {{we went into the}} ring. Bill was desperate. He fought like a tiger, a madman. He was fair crazy. He <b>was</b> <b>fighting</b> for more than I <b>was</b> <b>fighting</b> for. I <b>was</b> a rising fighter, and I <b>was</b> <b>fighting</b> for the money and the recognition.

5|$|The Transitional Federal Government was internationally {{recognized}} as the government of Somalia until August 2012, when it {{was replaced by the}} Federal Government of Somalia. It was established in 2004 as a successor to the now defunct Transitional National Government, and currently occupies Somalia's seat in the United Nations. The TFG is allied with the Islamic Courts Union and the Alliance for the Re-liberation of Somalia, and is backed by the United States, the United Nations and the African Union. Its forces <b>are</b> <b>fighting</b> to quell the ongoing insurgency in Somalia and are attempting to gain control of the southern half of the country, as the northern regions are both autonomous and comparatively stable. As a truce, in March 2009, Somalia's newly established coalition government announced that it would implement shari'a as the nation's official judicial system.|$|E
5|$|The story then {{shifts to}} four years later, where Marley forces {{including}} Titan Shifters like Zeke and Reiner, as well as warriors in training to inherit their powers <b>are</b> <b>fighting</b> against another nation called the Mid-East Allied Forces. Though Marley wins the war, they are devastated by the new invention of Anti-Titan artillery which can seriously harm and even kill the most well fortified Titan Shifters. Thus Zeke tells Marley military command that they must once again attempt to steal Eren's Coordinate power or Marley's position as a world hegemony will cease. As the Marleyan military prepares for another attempt to invade Paradis, Eren infiltrates the country by assuming the disguise of a wounded and amputated soldier named Mr. Kruger who uses Falco Grice, one of the prospective warriors who desire to inherit the Armored Titan to gain information.

60|$|We must pause {{here again}} {{for a moment to}} think where we are, and who is with us. The Teutsch Ritters have <b>been</b> <b>fighting,</b> {{independently}} of all states, for their own hand, or St. Adalbert's; partly for mere love of fight, partly for love of order, partly for love of God. Meantime, other Riders have <b>been</b> <b>fighting</b> wholly for what they could get by it; and other persons, not Riders, have not <b>been</b> <b>fighting</b> at all, but in their own towns peacefully manufacturing and selling.|$|R

5|$|They also {{performed}} in Ireland on June 8 and the Netherlands on June 9. Zack de la Rocha had {{stated that it}} was a definite possibility that the band would record a new album, the first time since 2000's Renegades. Morter confirmed this, stating the discussions he and the band had backstage before the Finsbury Park gig saying the band did write new material, but they had no motivation to release them until now. de la Rocha mentioned the very strong reaction from the Download Festival 2010 audience as an incentive for releasing new material. In addition, the band returned to Los Angeles on July 23, 2010 for their first U.S. show in two years and their first hometown show in 10 years. The concert benefited Arizona organizations that <b>are</b> <b>fighting</b> the SB1070 immigration law. On the night of the show, a spokesperson announced to the crowd that ticket sales—all of which are non-profit to the bands—had raised $300,000. The band has been confirmed to do a short South American tour in October, performing at venues such as the SWU Festival in Brazil, the Maquinaria Festival in Chile, and Pepsi Music Festival in Argentina. It {{was the first time the}} band played in those countries.|$|E
5|$|Without speech, the Scoobies {{resort to}} {{gestures}} or writing. Humorous misperceptions arise from this gesturing when, for example, Buffy mimes driving in a stake—as though killing a vampire—too {{close to her}} pelvis, causing the Scoobies to think she is suggesting masturbating to rid the town of The Gentlemen. In the belfry, while Buffy and Riley <b>are</b> <b>fighting</b> The Gentlemen, Buffy indicates that Riley should smash the box from her dream. He misunderstands and breaks a jar beside it, looks up and grins, awaiting Buffy's approval. The clumsiness of the characters' gesturing is in direct contrast to the grace of The Gentlemen, who communicate easily through gestures and other visual signals. Their communication is simple and direct; nods, head tilts, and hand movements, achieve exactly what they want it to. The Scoobies, however, are confused and accomplish {{the opposite of what}} they intend. When they are rendered silent they are also rendered useless, unsure of how to fight The Gentlemen. According to two Buffy essayists, part of the horror stemming from the arrival of The Gentlemen is the silence that makes the people of Sunnydale helpless, easy victims.|$|E
5|$|Valhalla {{is first}} {{mentioned}} in chapter 2 of the Prose Edda book Gylfaginning, {{where it is}} described partially in euhemerized form. In the chapter, King Gylfi sets out to Asgard {{in the guise of}} an old man going by the name of Gangleri to find the source {{of the power of the}} gods. The narrative states that the Æsir foresaw his arrival and had prepared grand illusions for him, so that when Gangerli enters the fortress, he sees a hall of such a height that he has trouble seeing over it, and notices that the roof of the hall is covered in golden shields, as if they were shingles. Snorri then quotes a stanza by the skald Þjóðólfr of Hvinir (c. 900). As he continues, Gangleri sees a man in the doorway of the hall juggling short swords, and keeping seven in the air at once. Among other things, the man says that the hall belongs to his king, and adds that he can take Gangleri to the king. Gangleri follows him, and the door closes behind him. All around him he sees many living areas, and throngs of people, some of which are playing games, some are drinking, and others <b>are</b> <b>fighting</b> with weapons. Gangleri sees three thrones, and three figures sitting upon them: High sitting on the lowest throne, Just-As-High sitting on the next highest throne, and Third sitting on the highest. The man guiding Gangleri tells him that High is the king of the hall.|$|E
60|$|Ben {{could expect}} no aid from his companions, for all were as hotly engaged as himself; indeed, Sorrel more so, for he <b>was</b> <b>fighting</b> three men, while Jeming and Dan Casey, side by side, {{and with their}} backs against a heavy thorn-bush, <b>were</b> <b>fighting</b> {{the balance of the}} detachment.|$|R

As for her--But Oak was generous and true, and dismissed his reflections.|$|R

5|$|While {{talking about}} Chris's {{situation}} with Lois, Peter is suddenly {{confronted by the}} Giant Chicken. This is the third fight between the two. Their epic battle ranges from the Griffin house, through the sewers, onto a subway train, over the girders of a high-rise construction site, and then up into a biplane, crashing into a giant Ferris wheel, which is dislodged from its platform and rolls through the streets. The fight continues atop the rolling wheel until it demolishes a ten-story apartment building. Emerging from the wreckage, Peter and the Chicken realize that neither has any idea what they <b>are</b> <b>fighting</b> about. They apologize to each other, and the Chicken invites Peter to join him and his wife, Nicole, for dinner. At the restaurant, the three have just finished a lovely meal when the check arrives, and both Peter and the Chicken (named Ernie) insists on paying the tab--Peter insists on paying since his order was kind of expensive while Ernie insists on paying {{as a way of}} apologizing to Peter. As they face off, the fight resumes and leads them into the restaurant kitchen. Peter subdues Ernie with a pot of boiling water and beats him unconscious. Peter staggers home, and back in the kitchen, Ernie lies lifeless on the floor, but in a sudden close-up, Ernie's left eye opens as dramatic music plays, foreshadowing another chicken fight. Peter goes home and resumes his conversation with Lois.|$|E

25|$|In {{order for}} the player to attack an enemy {{building}}, they must click near that building with soldiers selected. If the player's units defeat all soldiers stationed in the building, they will occupy it, with the player's territory increasing according to the building's radius. Defense of the player's military buildings is automatic; as enemies attack, any soldiers stationed in the building defend. Any nearby soldiers will also defend the building, unless ordered not to. When soldiers <b>are</b> <b>fighting</b> within their own territory, their strength is always 100%. When they <b>are</b> <b>fighting</b> outside, their strength {{depends on how much}} gold the player has in their stockpile.|$|E
