500|$|The {{recording}} and mixing of [...] "When Love Takes Over" [...] {{took place in}} summer and autumn of 2008. After Rowland heard the instrumental of [...] "When Love Takes Over"—a piano loop-based melody with throbbing percussion—she asked Guetta if she could take the demo and several other tracks to work on. She wrote the lyrics and recorded the vocals in London, within a day. She was aided by Australian songwriters and producers Miriam and Olivia Nervo (The Nervo Twins). However the song remained unfinished until Guetta rediscovered the track while compiling his One Love album. After getting selected for the album, [...] "When Love Takes Over" [...] was given to Frédéric Riesterer who, aside from producing the song with Guetta, was tasked the final audio mixing of the song. However Riesterer decided to give the track to French mixing engineer Veronica Ferraro, who would later go {{on to say that}} [...] "Reisterer was supposed to mix it, but he wanted me to do it <b>and</b> <b>see</b> <b>how</b> <b>it</b> turned out. The first time I heard the track I immediately knew it would be a huge hit." [...] The track was mixed in September 2008, at Ferraro's Super Sonic Scale studio near Paris, the day after her birthday.|$|E
500|$|On his casting in {{the role}} of Fatboy, {{television}} newcomer Ricky Norwood said, [...] "It's an honour to now be a part of [...] show. I am born and bred in the East End [...] it feels like a homecoming." [...] Norwood adapted his own use of slang into the character to [...] "try and bring it and from a true place." [...] Bunmi Mojekwu, who plays Mercy Olubunmi, commented [...] "I feel so blessed to be part of EastEnders: E20. My first day on set was just crazy. I was on Albert Square – a dream come true – I'm enjoying every second." [...] Sam Attwater, who previously appeared in five episodes of Hollyoaks, was cast as boxer Leon Small. On his casting, he commented, [...] "It's a great privilege to be working with such great actors and on such an established show. It's an amazing opportunity and I'm really enjoying tackling a character like Leon who has so much going on," [...] He prepared for the role by attending a gym, as the character has a lot of topless scenes. He said: [...] "As soon as I heard that I was straight down the gym. Lots of crunches. Everyone said don't worry about it, but every time I did one of those scenes I had to watch it back <b>and</b> <b>see</b> <b>how</b> <b>it</b> looked because there will be 10 million people watching it. I {{want to be on the}} best form." ...|$|E

I presume we've got to give some sort of party when we get into the new house, and this gives the chance to ask 'em back again.

500|$|Basu {{wanted to}} cast a new girl from Kolkata for the autistic character. Basu's wife, Tani {{suggested}} Chopra's name for the role. However, Basu feared that audience would see [...] "the Priyanka Chopra" [...] and not the character due to Chopra's stardom. Basu explained [...] "I had the fear that I would see Priyanka Chopra in the character and Jhilmil wouldn’t work. This has happened in many films where known faces have harmed the character." [...] Priyanka Chopra was cast to play the part but, the development was not announced as Basu wanted to workshop first <b>and</b> <b>see</b> <b>how</b> <b>it</b> goes. After three days of workshop, Basu was convinced that Chopra could play the autistic part and reflected that he was glad that he chose Chopra for the role. Later, Basu revealed {{that he did not}} approach any actress other than Chopra for the autistic part. After Chopra was cast in the film, Kaif left the project for unknown reasons. Media reported that she may have opted out of the film because Chopra had been given a stronger role. Later, media reported that Asin was approached {{to play the role of}} the narrator, replacing Kaif. However, Asin was never signed to the project. Media reported that no other actress wanted to sign for the film because according to them, the autistic part was stronger. In July 2010, Mumbai Mirror reported that Chopra was ready to play the role of narrator and leave the autistic role, so that another actress could be cast in the film; Chopra did not want the film to stall. Basu confirmed this development and said, [...] "It’s true we’ve been unable to cast the other part." [...] After facing several casting problems, Basu chose {{to cast a}} completely new fresh face to play the second female role. In early December 2010, Ileana D'Cruz from south Indian films, was finalised for the second female lead, featuring as narrator and Kapoor's first love interest in the film.|$|E
500|$|Co-director Johnson {{would go}} over each {{scene with the}} animators, {{sometimes}} acting out the scene, if necessary. The animators would create a [...] "dope sheet"—in which a shot was broken down, frame by frame—to account for key [...] "hits". The animators would then shoot tests of the scene, often shooting on [...] "2s" [...] or [...] "4s" [...] (meaning shooting just every second or fourth frame of what would appear in the final animation). Johnson explained: [...] "The next day, when they'd finish their test/rehearsal, we'd cut it in <b>and</b> <b>see</b> <b>how</b> <b>it</b> played in the reel and fine-tune from there. We might do some lighting tweaks, performance tweaks or have the art department get in and touch anything that needed it. Then we'd close the curtain and let the animator animate the shot." [...] The animators would sometimes {{make use of the}} voice and/or video recordings of the actors, a practice also common in cel animation. Once photographed, the frames were manipulated by a team of [...] "data wranglers." [...] Using a workflow developed by Chris Watts, the frames were downloaded from the camera image cards as RAW files, converted to Cineon files and processed through a [...] "color cube." [...] Cinematographer Pete Kozachik explained: [...] "The color cube is a 3D lookup table created by FilmLight Ltd. that forces the image data into behaving like a particular Eastman Kodak film stock—in this case, 5248, one of my favorites. With this film emulation, we could actually rate our cameras at ASA 100, then take our light meters and spot meters and, with great confidence, shoot as if we were using 5248. Sure enough, the footage would come back and look just like it." [...] The frames could be processed further to generate a TIFF file for viewing on the lighting station computer monitors so lighting, composition and color could be previewed.|$|E
2500|$|In November 2008, in an {{interview}} with All Headline News, Coldplay lead singer Chris Martin stated that [...] "...I don't think bands should keep going past [...] 33", but later rephrased this to say that what he meant was that they must proceed [...] "as if it's our last, because that's the only way to proceed" [...] in December 2008, adding that he thought the band would never split. Bass guitarist Guy Berryman, who earlier wrote that the band will [...] "just have to start work <b>and</b> <b>see</b> <b>how</b> <b>it</b> shapes up", reported that the band would return to the studio: ...|$|E

The IIG {{discovered}} that what was actually said on the tape day, and what was broadcast to the public were [...] "substantially different in the accuracy. They're getting rid of the wrong guesses... Once you pull back the curtain <b>and</b> <b>see</b> <b>how</b> <b>it's</b> done, it's not impressive at all." ...|$|R
2500|$|There were an {{estimated}} 10,000 people being killed each day by Interhamwe. Steć and four fellow polish officers created a Humanitarian Action Cell to co-ordinate and organise rescue teams. By April 15, 1994 they devised {{a plan for}} the creation of secure zones, the co-ordination of relief agencies and protection of the population. This evoleved into Dallaire's Humanitarian Assistance Cell HAC with Steć, Pazik, two Canadian majors under the command of a Ghanaian Colonel. [...] None of these points was entirely realised because of the pressure from the UN Security Council, or rather from Paris, London, Washington, D.C., and Brussels. [...] "Instead of saving people, we were engaged into talks on impossible ceasefire. Basically it sounded to us like: do not save people, play for time <b>and</b> <b>see</b> <b>how</b> <b>it</b> develops". They created 91 such secure zones in Rwanda, but there were only enough Unamir soldiers to stand guard at four of them.|$|E
2500|$|On 18 April 2017, Mallya {{was arrested}} by the UK Metropolitan Police {{extradition}} unit [...] "on behalf of the Indian authorities in relation to accusations of fraud", and he was then released on bail pending further consideration of the case. On 9 May 2017, the Supreme Court of India found Mallya guilty of contempt of court and summoned him to appear on 10 July. When he failed to appear, the Supreme Court said the contempt case would only proceed further after he is produced before the court. Mallya dismissed the proceedings against him – calling the situation a [...] "witch hunt". He said [...] "I have done absolutely nothing wrong. In fact I am glad that it is finally before a UK court and an impartial court. So we wait <b>and</b> <b>see</b> <b>how</b> <b>it</b> plays out." [...] In the meantime, he {{is not allowed to}} leave Britain, but he said that is no hardship for him. He said [...] "There's nothing to miss" [...] for him about India, since his immediate family has all moved to England or the United States.|$|E
2500|$|After {{graduating from}} high school, Parsons {{received}} a bachelor's degree from the University of Houston. He was prolific during this time, appearing in 17 plays in 3 years. He was {{a founding member of}} Infernal Bridegroom Productions and regularly appeared at the Stages Repertory Theatre. Parsons enrolled in graduate school at the University of San Diego in 1999. He was one of seven students accepted into a special two-year course in classical theater, taught in partnership with the Old Globe Theater. Program director Rick Seer recalled having reservations about admitting Parsons, saying, [...] "Jim is a very specific personality. He's thoroughly original, which is one reason he's been so successful. But we worried, 'Does that adapt itself to classical theater, does that adapt itself to the kind of training that we're doing?' But we decided that he was so talented that we would give him a try <b>and</b> <b>see</b> <b>how</b> <b>it</b> worked out." [...] Parsons enjoyed school and told an interviewer that he would have pursued a doctorate in acting if possible: [...] "school was so safe!.....you frequently would surprise yourself by what you were capable of, and you were not surprised by some things." [...] Parsons graduated in 2001 and moved to New York.|$|E

2500|$|After {{reducing}} Buemi's lead by 22 {{points in}} the preceding New York City ePrix, di Grassi stated that his team had to improve vastly in gaining any hope of winning the championship in Montreal and was feeling more confident that he previously been: [...] "With the experience that I have with Formula E, {{you know that it}} can go from hell to heaven any weekend, any race. We just have to do our best, try and win both races <b>and</b> <b>see</b> <b>how</b> <b>it</b> goes." [...] Buemi, the pre-title favourite, missed the New York City races because of a World Endurance Championship commitment at the Nürburgring, but stated he would prepare for the Montreal events the same way as he would with any other ePrix: [...] "We will try to do the best possible. I hope we can finish this season in style and look forward to it." [...] He created controversy when he raised the issue of his crash with di Grassi at the 2016 London ePrix, saying: [...] "If [...] happens once more like this, what do you think people will think then? It will be very hard to explain for him. He can’t afford anything like that again for his reputation, can he?" [...] Di Grassi responded by noting Buemi lost the first season championship through a driver error and said Buemi had more pressure and another mistake would prevent him from reclaiming the championship: [...] "Everyone feels pressure in a different way of course. He has pressure big time this weekend, much more than me, this is because everyone will be waiting to see if those mistakes come again in Montreal." ...|$|E
