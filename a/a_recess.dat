5|$|Cave 10 {{is located}} {{at a higher level}} than cave 9 and is {{difficult}} to reach as its front is broken. An open veranda with a broken ceiling and floor leads to a middle room through a grooved broken door, which has windows on either side. The right wall of the hall has <b>a</b> <b>recess</b> with a seat. A cell {{to the left of the}} room has a seat in <b>a</b> <b>recess.</b> A door from the cell leads to a half-cell which has <b>a</b> <b>recess</b> and seat. Traces of painting are seen on the ceiling. Outside the veranda to the left is a cistern.|$|E
5|$|Cave 11 is {{difficult}} to reach with a broken front and a hall. To the left of a hall is a cell, lower in height than the hall. The hall has a grooved doorway and <b>a</b> <b>recess</b> with {{a seat at the}} back. Outside the hall is a view seat. The cave bears traces of paint.|$|E
5|$|Cave 3 has an open veranda and a cell. The veranda has a bench {{along the}} back wall. A door leads to a cell, which has a seat in a left recess. In front of the recess, below the seat, are {{vertical}} bands. Between caves 2 and 3 there is {{a seat in the}} front, in <b>a</b> <b>recess.</b>|$|E
50|$|The hull, typically, {{consists}} of four strakes each side, the garboard strakes being wide giving a flat run to the transom whilst having a fairly sharp entry at the stem. There is <b>a</b> <b>recessed</b> rear deck level with side benches and <b>a</b> <b>recessed</b> foredeck. Some models have a small one or two-berth cabin.|$|R
50|$|The {{ground floor}} has <b>a</b> central <b>recessed</b> entry, with double doors and fanlights into a shop either {{side and a}} central foyer. Each shop has a large display window, and <b>a</b> <b>recessed</b> {{entrance}} door, leading to a staircase to the first floor, is situated on the western side. A metal awning is slung from the first floor, which has <b>a</b> <b>recessed</b> loggia and <b>a</b> parapet concealing the roof form, which is possibly shallow, hipped corrugated iron with ridge ventilation.|$|R
50|$|The main facade, {{overlooking}} the village below, is symmetrical, with shingled corners and <b>a</b> <b>recessed</b> veranda. The rear {{wall of the}} porch is finished with board and batten siding, and contains large windows. The second floor above is shingled, and there are three dormers on the upper floor. One of the side facade has two massive chimneys and a small enclosed porch. The rear facade features <b>a</b> <b>recessed</b> kitchen porch.

Above, the second floor has two large bay windows, {{and there is a}} large dormer above.|$|R
5|$|While {{all but one}} justice {{personally}} rejected segregation, {{the judicial}} restraint faction questioned whether the Constitution gave the Court the power to order its end. The activist faction believed the Fourteenth Amendment did give the necessary authority and were pushing to go ahead. Warren, who held only <b>a</b> <b>recess</b> appointment, held his tongue until the Senate confirmed his appointment.|$|E
5|$|As Associate Justices {{left the}} court in {{subsequent}} years, Washington appointed Thomas Johnson, William Paterson, and Samuel Chase. Jay stepped down as Chief Justice in 1795 {{and was replaced by}} Rutledge, who received <b>a</b> <b>recess</b> appointment as Chief Justice. Rutledge served for six months but resigned after his nomination was rejected by the Senate in December 1795. After the rejection of Rutledge's nomination, Washington appointed Oliver Ellsworth as the third Chief Justice of the United States.|$|E
5|$|As {{the first}} President, Washington was {{responsible}} for appointing the entire Supreme Court; he appointed a record ten justices, including two Chief Justices who were confirmed from outside the Court and one former Justice named as Chief Justice by <b>a</b> <b>recess</b> appointment, but not ultimately confirmed to the position. Additionally, Washington nominated Robert H. Harrison, who declined to serve, and nominated William Cushing for elevation to Chief Justice, who likewise declined.|$|E

5|$|Cordray {{was elected}} Ohio Attorney General in November 2008 {{to fill the}} {{remainder}} of the unexpired term ending January 2011. In 2010, Cordray lost his bid for re-election to former U.S. Senator Mike DeWine. On July 17, 2011, President Barack Obama announced he would nominate Cordray to lead the United States Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. On January 4, 2012, the White House announced that it would make <b>a</b> <b>recess</b> appointment of Cordray to the post. On July 16, 2013, the U.S. Senate confirmed Cordray to a five-year term as Director in a 66–34 vote.|$|E
5|$|Facundo Arana and Natalia Oreiro were {{nominated}} {{again at the}} 2007 Martín Fierro Awards. These nominations proved controversial because the program only lasted for a week in 2007 and had no second season, and both actors took <b>a</b> <b>recess</b> from work after it. Neither of them received an award for those nominations. Oreiro won the newly created award for the best dressed actress of the night, which {{is not part of}} the official awards.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, the Underwoods' {{marriage}} is faltering. Underwood gives Claire the ambassador job in <b>a</b> <b>recess</b> appointment, {{but she is}} forced to resign in order to solve a diplomatic crisis. Claire begins to question whether she still loves her husband, and they get into an ugly fight in which he tells her that she is nothing without him. Season 3 ends with Claire leaving Underwood as he prepares for the New Hampshire primary.|$|E

5|$|Representing himself {{during the}} hearing, he {{admitted}} the violation but {{pleaded not guilty}} and hinted at conspiracies. During <b>a</b> <b>recess</b> the judge apparently suggested a psychiatric evaluation to Reich's ex-wife, Ilse Ollendorff, {{but this was not}} communicated to Reich. The jury found him guilty on 7 May 1956, and he was sentenced to two years' imprisonment. Silvert was sentenced to a year and a day, the Wilhelm Reich Foundation was fined $10,000, and the accumulators and associated literature were to be destroyed.|$|E
5|$|When Adam Eckfeldt {{retired in}} 1839, he {{recommended}} Peale as his successor. As the Senate was not sitting, Peale was given <b>a</b> <b>recess</b> appointment as Chief Coiner of the Philadelphia Mint by President Martin Van Buren on March 27, 1839. On January 23, 1840, after the Senate reconvened, Van Buren nominated Peale; the Senate gave its approval on February 17. Despite his retirement, Eckfeldt continued {{to come to}} the mint every day until shortly before his death in February 1852, performing the function of Chief Coiner and leaving Peale with time on his hands.|$|E
5|$|Although Platt desired <b>a</b> <b>recess,</b> Hanna refused, {{wanting the}} {{convention}} to complete its work that day, and the delegates proceeded {{to the presidential}} nomination. McKinley had insisted that Foraker nominate him to demonstrate {{the unity of the}} Ohio Republican Party, and after some reluctance by the senator-elect, who feared blame if anything went wrong, Foraker agreed. McKinley was waiting with family and friends at his house in Canton, being kept up to date by telegraph and telephone. He was able to listen to part of Foraker's speech, and the tremendous reception that met it, over the phone line. McKinley was easily nominated on the first ballot, with Reed his nearest competitor. Canton erupted in celebration, with McKinley making speech after speech to the townsfolk and to those who poured in that day by rail from across Ohio, even from his birthplace of Niles.|$|E

5|$|Higginbotham's {{nomination}} {{was held up}} by Mississippi Senator James Eastland, {{the chairman of the}} Senate Judiciary Committee and a committed segregationist. Eastland delayed the nomination long enough so that, despite being passed by a subcommittee, Higginbotham's nomination lapsed following the death of President Kennedy, and {{the beginning of a new}} congressional term. He was ultimately appointed to the Eastern District of Pennsylvania by President Lyndon Johnson as <b>a</b> <b>recess</b> appointment on January 6, 1964, and was confirmed by the Senate later that year. At the time of his appointment, he was 35 years old. Higginbotham became a trustee of the University of Pennsylvania, of Yale University, and of Thomas Jefferson University.|$|E
5|$|On April 29, {{the last}} day of the {{legislative}} session, the Senate bill was revived in the Hawaii House following a motion by Majority Leader Blake Oshiro. Speaker Calvin Say immediately ordered <b>a</b> <b>recess</b> and after the representatives returned four votes to suspend legislative rules postponing the issue were taken and the bill passed with 31 to 20 votes. Governor Linda Lingle had until July 6 to decide whether to sign or veto the measure. The House vote margin in support is not large enough to override a gubernatorial veto. Lingle vetoed the bill on July 6, arguing civil unions should be decided by referendum. The House had ruled out any attempt to override her vetoes for the legislative session.|$|E
5|$|The {{convention}} reconvened at 11:00 A.M. on June 3. Roscoe Conkling {{submitted a}} motion for <b>a</b> <b>recess,</b> but the motion was rejected. Another New York delegate, Henry R. Pierson from the Committee on Permanent Organization, submitted {{a proposal to}} make the temporary convention assignments permanent. The motion was adopted, and the convention took a four-hour recess until 5:00 P.M. After the recess, a motion was made for the Committee on Rules to be directed to report, but a substitute motion from George H. Sharpe of New York called for the Committee on Credentials to report. The substitute motion was rejected {{by a vote of}} 406 to 318, and the original resolution was laid on the table. At 7:30 P.M., the convention was adjourned until 10:00 A.M. the following morning.|$|E

40|$|The {{effect of}} <b>a</b> <b>recessed</b> liquid oxygen tube in shear coaxial {{injection}} {{has been investigated}} experimentally using an optically accessible subscale rocket combustor operated at pressures between 40 and 60 bar. Different single-shear coaxial injectors {{have been used to}} inject liquid oxygen and methane at relevant operating conditions covering sub-, near-, and supercritical pressures with respect to the critical point of oxygen. Liquid oxygen was injected at 120 K and the injection temperature of gaseous methane was about 275 K. Detection of spontaneous OH and CH chemiluminescene has been performed to characterize the flame-anchoring zone near the liquid oxygen post tip. In addition, the influence of the injector geometry on the combustion roughness and stability has been investigated during steady-state operating points. An increased flame expansion was observed with <b>a</b> <b>recessed</b> injector element. At low momentum flux ratio, the pressure drop accross the injector increases with <b>a</b> <b>recessed</b> liquid oxygen tube compared with a flush tube. Furthermore, <b>a</b> <b>recessed</b> liquid oxygen tube led to be a smoother combustion in general; however, this configuration also led to additional resonant frequencies in the chamber acoustics...|$|R
5|$|Cave 1 {{is divided}} into four parts: a veranda, a middle room, a cell, and a half cell. The veranda has a bench along the right wall. Its front {{possibly}} had two quadrangular pillars, traces of one are seen around the ceiling. A rock beam was present over the pillars, above the beam ribs and a rail pattern could have existed. In <b>a</b> <b>recess</b> below the veranda is an earth-filled cistern. A door with a small window to the left leads into the middle room. The middle room has a bench along the right wall. Towards {{the back of the}} middle room, to the left, is the half cell and to the right the cell. The half-cell has a bench along the right wall and to the left, has a square window connecting it to cave 2. A door with grooves for fitting a wooden frame, leads into the cell which has a bench along its right wall.|$|E
5|$|Keating {{had earlier}} taken several {{measures}} to oppose Gray and the FHLBB, including recruiting {{a study from}} then-private economist Alan Greenspan saying that direct investments were not harmful, and getting President Ronald Reagan to make <b>a</b> <b>recess</b> appointment of a Keating ally, Atlanta real estate developer Lee H. Henkel Jr., to an open seat on the FHLBB. By March 1987, however, Henkel had resigned, upon news of his having large loans due to Lincoln. Meanwhile, the Senate had changed control from Republican to Democratic during the 1986 Congressional elections, placing several Democratic senators in key positions, and starting in January 1987, Keating's staff was putting pressure on Cranston to remove Gray from any FHLBB discussion regarding Lincoln. The following month, Keating began large-scale contributions into Cranston's project to increase California voter registration. In February 1987, Keating met with Riegle and began contributing to Riegle's 1988 re-election campaign.|$|E
5|$|Like Probactrosaurus {{and other}} hadrosauroids, {{the back of}} the maxilla connects to the jugal – which borders the bottom of the eye socket and infratemporal fenestra – through a finger-like {{projection}} that fits into <b>a</b> <b>recess.</b> The bottom margin of the jugal bears a strong flange beneath the level of the infratemporal fenestra; this is also seen in Equijubus, Probactrosaurus, Protohadros, and several other hadrosauroids. Connecting to the jugal from above is the postorbital, which has a roughened surface where it borders the eye sockets (like Protohadros), but the side of the bone is otherwise smooth. At {{the back of the}} skull, the quadrate articulates with the squamosal with a joint that is D-shaped when viewed from the top. The left and right squamosals would have contacted each other extensively, being only separated at the back by a small process of the parietal. The supraoccipital bone, which forms the top portion {{of the back of the}} skull, is flat and nearly vertical, as is the case in Probactrosaurus and other hadrosauroids.|$|E
