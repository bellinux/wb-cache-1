40|$|The {{navigation}} algorithms for the Sea-viewing Wide Field-of-view Sensor (SeaWiFS) {{were designed}} to meet the requirement of 1 -pixel accuracy-a standard deviation (sigma) of 2. The objective has been to extract the best possible accuracy from the spacecraft telemetry and avoid the need for costly manual renavigation or geometric rectification. The requirement is addressed by postprocessing of both the Global Positioning System (GPS) receiver and Attitude Control System (ACS) data in the spacecraft telemetry stream. The navigation algorithms described are separated into four areas: orbit processing, <b>attitude</b> <b>sensor</b> processing, attitude determination, and final navigation processing. There has been substantial modification during the mission of the attitude determination and <b>attitude</b> <b>sensor</b> processing algorithms. For the former, the basic approach was completely changed {{during the first year of}} the mission, from a single-frame deterministic method to a Kalman smoother. This was done for several reasons: a) to improve the overall accuracy of the attitude determination, particularly near the sub-solar point; b) to reduce discontinuities; c) to support the single-ACS-string spacecraft operation that was started after the first mission year, which causes gaps in <b>attitude</b> <b>sensor</b> coverage; and d) to handle data quality problems (which became evident after launch) in the direct-broadcast data. The changes to the <b>attitude</b> <b>sensor</b> processing algorithms primarily involved the development of a model for the Earth horizon height, also needed for single-string operation; the incorporation of improved sensor calibration data; and improved data quality checking and smoothing to handle the data quality issues. The <b>attitude</b> <b>sensor</b> alignments have also been revised multiple times, generally in conjunction with the other changes. The orbit and final navigation processing algorithms have remained largely unchanged during the mission, aside from refinements to data quality checking. Although further improvements are certainly possible, future evolution of the algorithms is expected to be limited to refinements of the methods presented here, and no substantial changes are anticipated...|$|E

Through analyzing the basic navigation equations of DVL, {{we knew that the}} acoustic navigating error was related to on-board <b>attitude</b> <b>sensor</b> error, velocity error and installation deviation error (array deviation angle and array eccentricity error). The author also derived the equations of random navigating errors and measure value errors, giving quantitative analysis of navigation error.

40|$|Estimation of {{satellite}} three-axis attitude using only one sensor data presents an interesting estimation problem.

40|$|The {{applications}} of GPS in space, such as orbit and attitude determination, offer serveral advantages, e. g. complete navigations information on board, low weight, volume and power consumption. Besides this, GPS also influences {{the operations of}} satellites. Ground stations and operations can be reduced, which means a reduction of the total operation cost. GPS based attitude determination has many important advantages like the fast and reliable intial acquisition, the resistance against spin rates and the fact, {{that at least two}} satellites for deterministic attitude determination are always visible during the mission. GPS could also be used as a safe mode sensor. Therefore GPS based attitude determination seems very promising. But due to the achievable accuracy, implied by the baseline length and the signal noise, a GPS <b>attitude</b> <b>sensor</b> cannot be used for missions were high accurate attitude measurements are needed and the baseline lengths are resticted. For these missions, a star sensor will be the adequate <b>attitude</b> <b>sensor.</b> Star sensors are high accurate, obust and have well established algorithms. The disadvantages using star sensors are e. g. resticted field of view, operation only at low angular rates, sensor performance degradation and sometimes problems with the star indentification. Taking all thes individual advantages and disadvantages into account, the combination of a GPS <b>attitude</b> <b>sensor</b> and a star sensor seems extremely promising, because such a sensor combination can be applied to a broad area of missions and their reqiriements of a high accurate attitude. This paper deals with the development of new algorithms for the combination of a GPS attitude sonsor and a star sensor and the investigation of the various possibilities to support each other and therefore improve the attitude solution and the range of applicability. The results of this paper are obtained from an experiment on a tur table with a four antenna GPS <b>attitude</b> <b>sensor</b> and a star sensor on top of it during a ground night experiment. Data were collected for several inclined static and spinning cases. New attitude algorithms for both sensor typers were tested and verified...|$|E
40|$|The Global Positioning System (GPS) {{receivers}} {{are being}} widely utilized for low earth navigation in space. These receivers provide the orbital information {{in real time}} while the <b>attitude</b> <b>sensors</b> provide real time attitude data.

40|$|Abstract. In the {{research}} of remote sensing for precision farming applications, the data quality of the aerial hyperspectral imaging system suffers from geometric distortions. Some of the distortions are caused by aircraft attitude change during the current pushbroom type image scanning. These distortions must be corrected before image data can be geo-referenced and used for field pattern identifications. Development of methods and algorithms for the correction {{of this type of}} remote sensing data distortion is the objective of this study. Three different approaches, namely manual correction, sensor augmentation, and image processing were developed. A Fiber Optic Gyroscope (FOG) <b>attitude</b> <b>sensor</b> was used on board the airplane to measure the real-time image sensor attitude, a polynomial interpolation algorithm was developed, and a reference straight feature was segmented based on the selected training dataset. The performance of all three methods was evaluated and compared.

40|$|Traditionally, {{attitude}} estimation {{has been}} performed {{using a combination}} of external <b>attitude</b> <b>sensors</b> and internal three-axis gyroscopes. There are many studies of three-axis attitude estimation using gyros that read angular rates. Rate-integrating gyros measure integrated rates or angular displacements, but three-axis attitude estimation using these types of gyros has not been as fully investigated. This paper derives a Kalman filtering framework for attitude estimation using <b>attitude</b> <b>sensors</b> coupled with rate- integrating gyroscopes. In order to account for correlations introduced by using these gyros, the state vector must be augmented, compared with filters using traditional gyros that read angular rates. Two filters are derived in this paper. The first uses an augmented state-vector form that estimates attitude, gyro biases, and gyro angular displacements. The second ignores correlations, leading to a filter that estimates attitude and gyro biases only. Simulation comparisons are shown for both filters. The work presented in this paper focuses only on attitude estimation using rate-integrating gyros, but it can easily be extended to other applications such as inertial navigation, which estimates attitude and position...|$|R
