5|$|Cabbages are {{prepared}} {{in many different}} ways for eating. They can be pickled, fermented for dishes such as sauerkraut, steamed, stewed, sautéed, braised, or eaten raw. Cabbage is <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>source</b> <b>of</b> vitamin K, vitamin C and dietary fiber.|$|E
5|$|The {{assemblage}} {{is easily}} dated {{because it contains}} many fine ash-beds, which are <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>source</b> <b>of</b> zircons used in the uranium-lead method of radiometric dating.

5|$|The carrot {{gets its}} characteristic, bright orange colour from β-carotene, and lesser amounts of α-carotene, γ-carotene, lutein and zeaxanthin. α- and β-carotenes are partly metabolized into vitamin A, {{providing}} more than 100% of the Daily Value (DV) per 100 g serving of carrots (right table). Carrots are also <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>source</b> <b>of</b> vitamin K (13% DV) and vitamin B6 (11% DV), but otherwise have modest content of other essential nutrients (right table).|$|E
5|$|The {{chemical}} composition of fruit bodies collected from Turkey has been analyzed, and the dried fruit bodies determined {{to contain the}} following nutritional components: protein, 19.46%; fat, 3.65%; ash, 32.51%; carbohydrates, 44.38% (including 6.71% as non-digestible cellulose). Fresh fruit bodies have a moisture content of 84.4%. The mushrooms are <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>source</b> <b>of</b> the element vanadium, shown in a 2007 study to be present at a concentration of 0.142mg/kg (dry weight).|$|E
5|$|The {{content of}} MFGM in dairy {{products}} {{varies depending on}} the processing involved. During dairy processing such as churning or decreaming, the MFGM is disrupted and preferentially distributed into aqueous phases such as buttermilk, butter serum, or certain type of whey. Thus they can be <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>source</b> <b>of</b> MFGM for addition into food products.|$|E
5000|$|CGM {{is used as}} an {{inexpensive}} protein source for pet foods. CGM is <b>an</b> especially <b>good</b> <b>source</b> <b>of</b> the amino acid cysteine, but must be balanced with other proteins for lysine.|$|R
50|$|Raw figs are <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>source</b> (14% <b>of</b> the Daily Value, DV) {{of dietary}} fiber per 100 gram serving (74 calories), but {{otherwise}} do not supply essential nutrients in significant content (table).|$|R

5|$|Reviews {{of fiction}} and popular science books were published, {{and there was}} a science column which {{endeavored}} to answer readers' questions. These features were at first of good quality, but deteriorated after Lasser's departure, although it is not certain that Lasser wrote the content of either one. An influential non-fiction initiative was the creation of the Science Fiction League, an organization that brought together local science fiction fan clubs across the country. Gernsback took the opportunity to sell items such as buttons and insignia, and it was undoubtedly a profitable enterprise for him as well as <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>source</b> <b>of</b> publicity. It was ultimately more important in becoming one of the foundations of science fiction fandom.|$|E
5|$|Roberto Guerro is {{the main}} {{antagonist}} of Uncharted: Golden Abyss voiced and motion-captured by actor JB Blanc. A decade before Golden Abyss, Roberto Guerro was the military dictator of Panama before being overthrown by a coup d'état. He escaped execution by the new regime and, accompanied by loyalists, formed a revolutionary army to hound government forces and eventually regain power. However, Guerro quickly realised that without <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>source</b> <b>of</b> funds he {{would be unable to}} compete with the military strength of a new government, so he indulged in abductions and drug running to build up the cash.|$|E
5|$|The carrot is a {{biennial}} {{plant in}} the umbellifer family Apiaceae. At first, it grows a rosette of leaves while building up the enlarged taproot. Fast-growing cultivars mature within three months (90 days) of sowing the seed, while slower-maturing cultivars are harvested four months later (120 days). The roots contain high quantities of alpha- and beta-carotene, and are <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>source</b> <b>of</b> vitamin K and vitamin B6, but the belief that eating carrots improves night vision is a myth put forward by the British in World War II to mislead the enemy about their military capabilities.|$|E
50|$|This tree {{helps to}} control erosion and is <b>a</b> <b>good</b> natural <b>source</b> <b>of</b> mulch. However, deforestation, higher demand for {{cultivated}} agricultural {{areas and the}} increasing population reduce numbers of this important forest tree in the African tropics.|$|R
40|$|Total fat and {{fatty acid}} {{composition}} of seven fresh-water and nine marine fish commercially important in Brazil were determined. Palmitic acid was the predominant {{saturated fatty acid}} in both freshwater and marine fish. In the fat from freshwater fish the total C- 16 fatty acids were higher than in marine fish. Oleic acid was the most abundant monounsaturated fatty acid and it was found in higher levels in freshwater fish. The data revealed that most freshwater fish from Brazil examined were a poor <b>source</b> <b>of</b> eicosapentaenoic (20 : 5) and docosahexaenoic (22 : 6) acids. Of the marine fish analysed, only sardine and manjuba could be recommended as <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>sources</b> <b>of</b> n- 3 fatty acids...|$|R

The mulberry leaves are considered as <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>sources</b> <b>of</b> starch, protein, crude fibre, minerals, vitamin-C, β-carotene and were estimated about 6 - 7, 4. 0 - 4. 6,. 0,. 0 - 3. 5, 15 - 132, 00 - 120 mg%, respectively. Moisture, ash, lipid, crude fibre, carbohydrate, {{vitamins and minerals}} content were decreased significantly but protein and phenol content were increased after infected of mulberry leaves with fungus, Phyllectinia corylea...|$|R
5|$|Seaborg's {{theoretical}} {{development of}} the actinide concept resulted in a redrawing of the Periodic Table of the Elements into its current configuration with the actinide series appearing below the lanthanide series. Seaborg developed the chemical elements americium and curium while in Chicago. He managed to secure patents for both elements. His patent on curium never proved commercially viable because of the element's short half-life, but americium is commonly used in household smoke detectors and thus provided <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>source</b> <b>of</b> royalty income to Seaborg in later years. Prior to the test of the first nuclear weapon, Seaborg joined with several other leading scientists {{in a written statement}} known as the Franck Report (secret at the time but since published) unsuccessfully calling on President Truman to conduct a public demonstration of the atomic bomb witnessed by the Japanese.|$|E
