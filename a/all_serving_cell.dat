Structure-activity {{relationship of}} adenine nucleotides as phagostimulants varies between closely-related species of blood feeders.

30|$|From the {{perspective}} of each UE, CC's are associated to a primary cells (PCell) and possibly plural Secondary Cell (SCell's) [21, 22]. The PCell is the only <b>serving</b> <b>cell</b> from which the UE can receive the security input and NAS mobility information for the RRC connection establishment and handover. <b>All</b> the other <b>serving</b> <b>cells,</b> which are allowed at maximum four per UE in release 10, are called SCell's. The PCell assignment is UE-specific, and the change of PCell at each UE can be accomplished only through a handover procedure. The PCell cannot be deactivated, whereas each SCell can be switched on and off dynamically using MAC control element. The PCell {{is responsible for the}} monitoring of broadcast signaling of system information and transmission of random access channel (RACH) and PUCCH. The SCell's convey only the dedicated signaling information, PDSCH, PUSCH, and PDCCH. Meanwhile, the LTE-Advanced is designed to allow cross-carrier scheduling, which means that the PDCCH transmitted from a particular CC may contain the scheduling information on other CC's as well as its own CC. This enables to disperse heavy load of PDCCH transmission in particular CC's.|$|R

40|$|Abstract—In the {{universal}} mobile telecommunication system, the user equipment (UE) communicates with all {{cells in the}} active set through the air interface. Multiple radio links between the UE and the cells may reduce the transmission speed due to interference. In high-speed downlink packet access (HSDPA), only one <b>serving</b> <b>cell</b> is selected in the active set for high-speed downlink transmission. When the radio link quality between the <b>serving</b> <b>cell</b> and the UE degrades below some threshold, the best cell (in terms of the radio characteristics) in the active set is selected as the new <b>serving</b> <b>cell</b> and the UE switches from the old <b>serving</b> <b>cell</b> to the new <b>serving</b> <b>cell.</b> This action {{is referred to as}} frame synchronization. The frame-synchronization information may be delivered through more than one wireless transmission, which in-troduces long delay for the frame-synchronization process. In this paper, we propose an overflow-control scheme with module count for HSDPA, which guarantees that the frame-synchronization information is delivered through one wireless transmission and that when the UE switches wireless link to the new <b>serving</b> <b>cell,</b> no packet frames are lost.

If the TSC related with the max TSC correlation power is not the TSC of the current <b>serving</b> <b>cell</b> (C/I[*]>[*] 0), then the value of TSC correlation power is the reception signal level from co-channel interference cells.
