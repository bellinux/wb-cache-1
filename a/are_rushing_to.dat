6000|$|When, in {{the close}} of my lecture on {{landscape}} last year at Oxford, I spoke of stationary clouds as distinguished from passing ones, some blockheads wrote to the papers to say that clouds never were stationary. Those foolish letters were so far useful in causing a friend to write me the pretty one I am about to read to you, quoting a passage about clouds in Homer which I had myself never noticed, though perhaps the most beautiful {{of its kind in}} the Iliad. In the fifth book, after the truce is broken, and the aggressor Trojans <b>are</b> <b>rushing</b> <b>to</b> the onset in a tumult of clamor and charge, Homer says that the Greeks, abiding them [...] "stood like clouds." [...] My correspondent, giving the passage, writes as follows:-- ...|$|E
60|$|Sir, {{the agents}} and {{distributors}} of falsehoods have, with their usual industry, circulated another lie, {{of the same}} nature with the former. It is this: that the disturbances arose from the account which had been received in America {{of the change in}} the ministry. No longer awed, it seems, with the spirit of the former rulers, they thought themselves a match for what our calumniators choose to qualify by the name of so feeble a ministry as succeeded. Feeble in one sense these men certainly may be called: for, with all their efforts, and they have made many, they {{have not been able to}} resist the distempered vigor and insane alacrity with which you <b>are</b> <b>rushing</b> <b>to</b> your ruin. But it does so happen, that the falsity of this circulation is (like the rest) demonstrated by indisputable dates and records.|$|E
60|$|Look at the Marquis of Carabas {{and his two}} carriages. My Lady Marchioness {{comes on}} board, looks round with that happy air of mingled terror and {{impertinence}} which distinguishes her ladyship, and rushes to her carriage, for it is impossible that she should mingle with the other Snobs on deck. There she sits, and will be ill in private. The strawberry leaves on her chariot-panels are engraved on her ladyship's heart. If she were going to heaven instead of to Ostend, I rather think she would expect to have DES PLACES RESERVEES for her, and would send to order the best rooms. A courier, with his money-bag of office round his shoulders--a huge scowling footman, whose dark pepper-and-salt livery glistens with the heraldic insignia of the Carabases--a brazen-looking, tawdry French FEMME-DE-CHAMBRE (none but a female pen can do justice to that wonderful tawdry toilette of the lady's-maid EN VOYAGE)--and a miserable DAME DE COMPAGNIE, are ministering to the wants of her ladyship and her King Charles's spaniel. They <b>are</b> <b>rushing</b> <b>to</b> and fro with eau-de-Cologne, pocket-handkerchiefs, which are all fringe and cipher, and popping mysterious cushions behind and before, and in every available corner of the carriage.|$|E

6000|$|... "And {{what is the}} result," [...] he cried, [...] "of the {{senseless}} {{insistence on}} the letter instead {{of the spirit of}} the poetry of religion? Matthew Arnold was a thousand times right when he inferred that Jesus Christ never spoke literally and yet he is still being taken literally by most churches, and all the literal sayings which were put into his mouth are maintained as Gospel truth! What is the result of proclaiming Christianity in terms of an ancient science and theology which awaken no quickening response in the minds and hearts of to-day? That!" [...] The librarian thrust a yellow hand towards the pile of books. [...] "The new wine has burst the old skin and is running all over the world. Ah, my friend, if you could only see, as I do, the yearning for a satisfying religion which exists in this big city! It is like a vacuum, and those books <b>are</b> <b>rushing</b> <b>to</b> supply it. I little thought," [...] he added dreamily, [...] "when I renounced the ministry in so much sorrow that one day I should have a church of my own. This library is my church, and men and women of all creeds come here by the thousands. But you must pardon me. I have been carried away--I forgot myself." ...|$|E
6000|$|The Jews {{required}} a sign; a sign from heaven; {{a sign of}} God's power. Thunder and earthquakes, armies of angels, taking vengeance on the heathen; these were the signs of Christ which they expected. A Christ who came in such awful glory as that, they would accept, and follow, and look to him to lead them against the Romans, that they might conquer them, and all the nations upon earth. And all that St. Paul gave them, {{was a sign of}} Christ's weakness. 'He was despised and rejected of men; a man of sorrows, and acquainted with grief. [...] . He hath borne our griefs, and carried our sorrows, yet we did esteem him stricken, smitten of God, and afflicted. He was oppressed, and he was afflicted, yet he opened not his mouth: he is brought as a lamb to the slaughter, and as a sheep before her shearers is dumb, so he opened not his mouth.' Then said the Jews-- This is no Christ for us, this weak, despised, crucified Christ. Then answered St. Paul--Weak? I tell you that what seems to you weakness, is the very power of God. You Jews wish to conquer all mankind: and behold, instead, you yourselves <b>are</b> <b>rushing</b> <b>to</b> ruin and destruction: but what you cannot do, Christ on his cross can do. Weak, shamed, despised, dying man as he seemed, he is still conqueror; and he will conquer all mankind at last, and draw all men to himself. Know that what seems to you weakness, is the very power of God; the power of doing good, and of suffering all things, that he may do good: and that that will conquer the world, when riches and glory, and armies, aye, the very thunder and the earthquake, have failed utterly.|$|E
