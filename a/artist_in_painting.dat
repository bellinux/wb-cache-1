His early (1940s-1960s) works, alongside those of peer, Hernando Ocampo are described as depictions of anguish and dehumanization of beggars and laborers in the city. These include Man and Woman (alternatively known as Beggars) and Gadgets. Primarily because of this early period, critics have further cited Legaspis having [...] "reconstituted" [...] in his paintings [...] "cubisms unfeeling, geometric ordering of figures into a social expressionism rendered by interacting forms filled with rhythmic movement".|$|E
