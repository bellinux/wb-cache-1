5|$|During Hurricane Sandy in October 2012, {{parts and}} {{remnants}} of the storm reached Presque Isle. The park was closed in preparation of the storm and waves for 14 – 18 feet were called for, along with high winds. The storm {{was expected to be}} severe, but luckily was not. Only 8 foot waves were recorded and not as high of winds either. The park made it out with only minor flooding, a few downed trees, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>loss</b> of power at the park marina.|$|E
5|$|Farther east in Florida, high waves caused flooding, beach erosion, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>loss</b> of seawalls {{previously}} {{damaged by}} Elena. The rough surf washed away {{a house on}} Captiva Island. The outskirts of Juan also spawned 15tornadoes along the Florida Panhandle, causing $1million in damage. The tornadoes injured six people, destroyed 19buildings, and damaged about 40others. One of the tornadoes struck Okaloosa Island and Fort Walton Beach, killing a dog and damaging two hotels along U.S. Route 98.|$|E
5|$|General Abercrombie {{reported}} 547 killed, 1,356 wounded, and 77 missing. Lévis in {{one report}} {{claimed that the}} French recovered 800 British bodies, implying that Abercrombie may have underreported the actual death toll. Chartrand estimates the number of British killed (or died of their wounds) at about 1,000 for the main battle, with about 1,500 wounded. The skirmish on July 6 cost the British about 100 killed and wounded, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>loss</b> of General Howe.|$|E

5|$|High-priced oil {{allowed the}} USSR {{to support the}} {{struggling}} economies of the Soviet bloc during the 1974–1981 petrodollar surge, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>loss</b> of income during the 1980s oil glut contributed to the bloc's collapse in 1989. During the 2005–2014 petrodollar surge, OPEC member Venezuela played a similar role supporting Cuba and other regional allies, before the 2014–2017 oil downturn brought Venezuela to its own economic crisis.|$|E
5|$|Historians have divided {{views on}} Stefansson's {{decision}} to leave the ship. Some of the voyage's survivors were critical of his seeming indifference to their ordeal <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>loss</b> of their comrades. He escaped official censure, and was publicly honoured for his later work on the expedition despite the Canadian government's reservations about its overall management. Although Bartlett was criticised by an admiralty commission for taking Karluk into the ice, he was hailed as a hero by the public and by his former Karluk shipmates.|$|E
5|$|In late August {{and early}} September 1943, the {{division}} redeployed again, {{this time to}} Bihać, relieving the 114th Jäger Division which redeployed to the Adriatic coast.

5|$|On the {{strength}} of his performance for the Bees, Umbricht was promoted to the Pirates roster {{near the end of the}} 1959 season. He appeared in only one game, a 7–6 loss to the Cincinnati Reds. He pitched seven innings, giving up five earned runs while striking out three. Umbricht left the game in position for the win, as the Pirates were leading 6–5, but reliever Don Gross gave up two earned runs in the ninth inning for the blown save <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>loss.</b>|$|E
5|$|Overgrazing, {{agriculture}} <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>loss</b> of wetland {{and moist}} grassland {{have reduced the}} availability of suitable habitat for the African crake in many areas, such as {{some parts of the}} southern KwaZulu-Natal coast which have been urbanised or planted with sugarcane. In other areas, grassland may have increased locally in recent years as woodland is cleared. This crake is considered to be good eating, and is killed for food in some regions. Despite these adverse factors, it appears to be under no real threat.|$|E

5|$|Some {{birds and}} insects use {{defensive}} regurgitation {{to ward off}} predators. The northern fulmar vomits a bright orange, oily substance called stomach oil when threatened. The stomach oil is made from their aquatic diets. It causes the predator's feathers to mat, leading {{to the loss of}} flying ability <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>loss</b> of water repellency. This is especially dangerous for aquatic birds because their water repellent feathers protect them from hypothermia when diving for food.|$|E
5|$|The {{attack on}} Truk was {{considered}} successful for the Allied force, with the ships and air units gaining useful experience while suffering two fatalities <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>loss</b> of seven aircraft to combat and accidents.

5|$|The spot-billed pelican has an {{estimated}} population between 13,000 and 18,000 {{and is considered}} to be Near Threatened in the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species.
