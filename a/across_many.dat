5|$|As {{part of the}} U.S. {{national}} defenses, {{to support}} military transport, the National Highway System was expanded with Interstate highways, beginning in 1955, <b>across</b> <b>many</b> parts of the United States. The wider, multi-lane highways allowed traffic to move at faster speeds, with few or no stoplights on the way. The wide-open spaces along the highways became a basis for numerous billboards showing advertisements.|$|E

5|$|A dwarf, in the Dungeons & Dragons (D) fantasy roleplaying game, is a {{humanoid}} race, one of {{the primary}} races available for player characters. The idea for the D dwarf comes from European mythologies and J. R. R. Tolkien's novel The Lord of the Rings (1954-1955), and has been used in D and its predecessor Chainmail since the early 1970s. Variations from the standard dwarf archetype of a short and stout demihuman are commonly called subraces, of which {{there are more than a}} dozen <b>across</b> <b>many</b> different rule sets and campaign settings.|$|E
5|$|A {{series of}} strong low {{pressure}} systems formed across the southern Great Plains on February 4, contributing to record warmth on February 4 and 5 {{in the southern}} Plains and lower Mississippi River Valley. High temperatures <b>across</b> <b>many</b> areas reached the 70s°F (21–26°C), and in Alabama temperatures reached the low 80s°F (27°C) with dew points in the middle 60s° (17–20°C). Dewpoints in the mid 60s°F were recorded {{as far north as}} Memphis. A strong cold front trailing the low pressure area approached the region from the west.|$|E
5|$|Forest covers about 12.6% of the country, {{most of it}} {{designated}} for commercial production. Forested areas typically consist of monoculture plantations of non-native species, which may result in habitats that are not suitable for supporting native species of invertebrates. Remnants of native forest can be found scattered around the island, in particular in the Killarney National Park. Natural areas require fencing to prevent over-grazing by deer and sheep that roam over uncultivated areas. Grazing in this manner {{is one of the}} main factors preventing the natural regeneration of forests <b>across</b> <b>many</b> regions of the country.|$|E

5|$|In {{southern}} Oklahoma City {{and surrounding}} communities, strong straightline winds caused damage to several buildings and downed trees and power {{lines in the}} early morning hours of May 7, with cleanup efforts being complicated due to flooding rains accompanying the storm. About 11,000 homes were without power during the event. There were also reports of floods <b>across</b> <b>many</b> other areas in Oklahoma. Oklahoma Governor Brad Henry had declared a state of emergency for all 77 counties across the state due to all the severe weather including the tornadoes, the flash floods and hail.|$|E
5|$|Normally wary of humans, blacktip sharks {{can become}} {{aggressive}} {{in the presence}} of food and have been responsible for a number of attacks on people. This species is of importance to both commercial and recreational fisheries <b>across</b> <b>many</b> parts of its range, with its meat, skin, fins, and liver oil used. It has been assessed as Near Threatened by the IUCN, {{on the basis of its}} low reproductive rate and high value to fishers.|$|E

5|$|The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has {{assessed}} the Galapagos shark as near threatened, as its low reproductive rate limits {{its capacity to}} withstand population depletion. There is no specific utilization data available, though this species is certainly caught by commercial fisheries operating <b>across</b> <b>many</b> parts of its range. The meat {{is said to be}} of excellent quality. While still common at areas such as Hawaii, the Galapagos shark may have been extirpated from sites around Central America and its fragmented distribution means other regional populations may also be at risk. The populations at the Kermadec and Galapagos Islands are protected within marine reserves.|$|E
5|$|The main mineral {{resource}} known {{on the continent}} is coal. It was first recorded near the Beardmore Glacier by Frank Wild on the Nimrod Expedition, and now low-grade coal is known <b>across</b> <b>many</b> parts of the Transantarctic Mountains. The Prince Charles Mountains contain significant deposits of iron ore. The most valuable resources of Antarctica lie offshore, namely the {{oil and natural gas}} fields found in the Ross Sea in 1973. Exploitation of all {{mineral resource}}s is banned until 2048 by the Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty.|$|E
5|$|A dun-colored {{coat with}} {{primitive}} markings {{that include a}} dorsal stripe and often leg striping and transverse shoulder stripes reflect the wildtype coat and are observed in most wild extant equine species. Only the mountain zebra lacks a dorsal stripe. In domestic horses, dun color and primitive markings exist in some animals <b>across</b> <b>many</b> breeds. The purpose of the bold black-and-white striping of zebras has been a subject of debate among biologists for over a century, but recent (2014) evidence supports the theory {{that they are a}} form of protection from biting flies. These insects appear to be less attracted to striped coats and, compared to other wild equines, zebras live in areas with the highest fly activity. With the exception of the domestic horses, which have long manes that lay over the neck and long tail hair growing {{from the top of the}} tailhead or dock, most equines have erect manes and long tails ending in a tuft of hair. The coats of some equine species undergo shedding in certain parts of their range and are thick in the winter.|$|E

5|$|Assisting {{communication}} <b>across</b> <b>many</b> modern {{optic fibre}} networks is a protocol known as Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM). The ATM protocol {{allows for the}} side-by-side data transmission mentioned in the second paragraph. It is suitable for public telephone networks because it establishes a pathway for data through the network and associates a traffic contract with that pathway. The traffic contract is essentially an agreement between the client and the network about how the network is to handle the data; if the network cannot meet {{the conditions of the}} traffic contract it does not accept the connection. This is important because telephone calls can negotiate a contract so as to guarantee themselves a constant bit rate, something that will ensure a caller's voice is not delayed in parts or cut off completely. There are competitors to ATM, such as Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS), that perform a similar task and are expected to supplant ATM in the future.|$|E
5|$|Culture {{and context}} in infants’ {{linguistic}} environment shape their vocabulary development. English learners {{have been found}} to map novel labels to objects more reliably than to actions compared to Mandarin learners. This early noun bias in English learners is caused by the culturally reinforced tendency for English speaking caregivers to engage in a significant amount of ostensive labelling as well as noun-friendly activities such as picture book reading. Adult speech provides children with grammatical input. Both Mandarin and Cantonese languages have a category of grammatical function word called a noun classifier, which is also common <b>across</b> <b>many</b> genetically unrelated East Asian languages. In Cantonese, classifiers are obligatory and specific in more situations than in Mandarin. This accounts for the research found on Mandarin-speaking children outperforming Cantonese-speaking children in relation to the size of their vocabulary.|$|E
5|$|Despite its poor organization, Emily wrought havoc <b>across</b> <b>many</b> Caribbean nations. Gusty winds {{felled trees}} and heavy rains {{triggered}} widespread flooding throughout the Lesser Antilles; any significant damage in those islands {{was confined to}} Martinique, however, where one fatality occurred. In Puerto Rico, similar floods affected residences and roads, with infrastructural losses in the territory estimated at $5 million. Even after dissipating, the remnants of Emily continued to produce prolonged rainfall over much of Hispaniola. Extensive floods and mudslides in the Dominican Republic displaced over 7,000 residents, and three people drowned {{in the capital of}} Santo Domingo. In neighboring Haiti, hundreds of homes were flooded in the department of Artibonite, prompting evacuations. Only minor wind damage occurred throughout the country's southern peninsula, but one death was reported in the region.|$|E

5|$|Historically, {{this was}} not the case. For most of its history, ain't was {{acceptable}} <b>across</b> <b>many</b> social and regional contexts. Throughout the 17th, 18th, and 19th centuries, ain't and its predecessors were part of normal usage for both educated and uneducated English speakers, and was found in the correspondence and fiction of, among others, Jonathan Swift, Lord Byron, Henry Fielding, and George Eliot. For Victorian English novelists William Makepeace Thackeray and Anthony Trollope, the educated and upper classes in 19th century England could use ain't freely, but in familiar speech only. Ain't continued to be used without restraint by many upper middle class speakers in southern England into the beginning of the 20th century.|$|E
5|$|Larger bodied {{specimens}} of Dimetrodon have larger sails {{relative to their}} size, an example of positive allometry. Positive allometry may benefit thermoregulation because it means that, as individuals get larger, surface area increases faster than mass. Larger-bodied animals generate {{a great deal of}} heat through metabolism, and the amount of heat that must be dissipated from the body surface is significantly greater than what must be dissipated by smaller-bodied animals. Effective heat dissipation can be predicted <b>across</b> <b>many</b> different animals with a single relationship between mass and surface area. However, a 2010 study of allometry in Dimetrodon found a different relationship between its sail and body mass: the actual scaling exponent of the sail was much larger than the exponent expected in an animal adapted to heat dissipation. The researchers concluded that the sail of Dimetrodon grew at a much faster rate than was necessary for thermoregulation, and suggested that sexual selection was the primary reason for its evolution.|$|E
5|$|Over £840 {{million in}} cash from more than 100 UK local {{authorities}} was invested in Icelandic banks. Representatives from each council met {{to try to persuade}} the Treasury to secure the money {{in the same way that}} customers' money in Icesave was fully guaranteed. Of all the local authorities, Kent County Council has the most money invested in Icelandic banks, currently £50 million. Transport for London, the organisation that operates and coordinates transport services within London, also has a large investment at £40 million. Local authorities were working under government advice to invest their money <b>across</b> <b>many</b> national and international banks as a way of spreading risk. Other UK organisations said to have invested heavily include police services and fire authorities, and even the Audit Commission. It is hoped that about one-third of the deposited money will be available fairly rapidly, corresponding to the liquid assets of the UK subsidiaries: liquidation of other assets, such as loans and offices, will take longer.|$|E
