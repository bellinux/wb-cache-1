5000|$|<b>Allophane</b> is an {{amorphous}} to poorly crystalline hydrous {{aluminium silicate}} clay mineraloid. Its chemical formula is Al2O3·(SiO2)1.3-2·(2.5-3)H2O. Since it has short-range atomic order, it is a mineraloid, {{rather than a}} mineral, and can be identified by its distinctive infrared spectrum and its X-ray diffraction pattern. It was first described in 1816 in Gräfenthal, Thuringia, Germany. <b>Allophane</b> is a weathering or hydrothermal alteration product of volcanic glass and feldspars and sometimes has a composition similar to kaolinite but generally has a molar ratio of Al:Si = 2. It typically forms under mildly acidic to neutral pH (5-7). Its structure has been debated, but it is similar to clay minerals and is composed of curved alumina octahedral and silica tetrahedral layers. [...] Transmission electron micrographs show that it is generally made up of aggregates of hollow spherules ~3-5 nm in diameter. <b>Allophane</b> can alter to form halloysite under resilicating aqueous conditions and can alter to form gibbsite under desilicating conditions.

I 0 M and 0. 01 M NaC 1 solutions were determined using 22 Na and 36 C 1 as ion probes. The point of zero net charge (PZNC) values ranged from 4. 1 to 8. 4, increasing with the Al/Si molar ratio for the <b>allophanes,</b> and was highest for imogolite (A 1 /Si = 2. 01). The PZNC values {{were significantly lower}} than the point of zero charge (PZC) values previously determined by microelectrophoresis forthe same material, indicating that Na resided within the shear plane to a greater extent han C 1. The PZNC values of <b>allophanes</b> were lower than their PZSE values, indicating that permanent charge existed in <b>allophanes,</b> and increased as A 1 /Si decreased. Conversely, the PZNC of imogolite was higher than its point of zero salt effect (PZSE) determined by potentiometric t tration. Adsorption of C 1 on imogolite from 0. 1 and 0. 01 M NaCl solutions below pH 8. 4 and of Na from 0. 1 M NaCl solutions between pH 5 and 8. 4 exceeded the proton charge determined by potentiometric titration. There was no direct evidence of permanent charge in imogolite and excess C 1 adsorption could not be entirely explained by simultaneous intercalation ofNa and Cl. Isomorphic substitution of A 1 in tetrahedral sites was shown to increase with decreasing A 1 /Si by 27 A 1 high-resolution solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra of allo-phanes, and was absent in imogolite. The chemical shifts of Al(4) and Al(6) were similar in <b>allophanes</b> (63. 0 - 64. 7 ppm and 6. 1 - 7. 8 ppm, respectively) and the chemical shift of Al(6) was 9. 4 in imogolite...|$|R

The effect ofpH (and metal concentration) on adsorption was qualitatively similar for the synthetic and natural <b>allophanes</b> with relatively minor changes in behavior caused by variable SLOE/ A 1203 ratios. Cu and Co were chemisorbed by aUophane at pH 5. 0 - 5. 5 and 6. 9 - 7. 2 (pH values for 50 % adsorption level), respectively, with concomitant release of 1. 6 - 1. 9 protons/metal ion adsorbed. Quan-titatively, adsorption by imogolite was less than that by the <b>allophanes,</b> presumably because of fewer sites available for chemisorption the tubular structure of imogolite. Electron spin resonance studies of the imogolite and <b>allophanes</b> revealed that Cu 2 § was adsorbed as a monomer on two types of surface sites. The preferred sites were likely adjacent A 1 OH groups binding Cu 2 + by a binuclear mechanism; weaker bonding occurred at isolated A 1 OH or SiOH groups.

In addition, the specific surface area of the samples was measured by ethylene glycol retention, and their morphology examined by high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM). The SANS data indicate that although both <b>allophanes</b> are somewhat polydisperse, the average diameter of their unit particles i significantly different, being 56 and 43 / ~ for allophane-An and allophane-Rh, respectively. Consistent with this observation, the specific surface area of allophane-Rh (897 mVg) is appreciably {{greater than that of}} allophane-An (638 m 2 /g). Under the electron microscope, both samples appear as aggregates of hollow spherules but HRTEM did not clearly distinguish between the two <b>allophanes</b> in that the largest population of spherules had diameters near 50 A. Because of the assumptions and uncertainties involved in the SANS and surface area measurements, the data must be discussed in terms of their respective ratios. On this basis, the spherule diameter ratio is of the same order of magnitude as the inverse ratio of specific surface area. The latter value is also in reasonably good agreement with the corresponding ratios of phosphate adsorption capacity and BET nitrogen areas, derived from earlier studies...|$|R

50|$|There {{are four}} groups of clay: layer silicates; {{crystalline}} chain silicates; metal oxides and hydroxides and oxy-oxides; and amorphous; and <b>allophanes.</b> Most clays are crystalline {{and most are}} made up of three or four planes of oxygen held together by planes of aluminium and silicon by way of ionic bonds that together form a single layer of clay. The spatial arrangement of the oxygen atoms determines clay's structure. Half of the weight of clay is oxygen, but on a volume basis oxygen is ninety percent. The layers of clay are sometimes held together through hydrogen bonds or potassium bridges and as a result will swell less in the presence of water. Other clays, such as montmorillonite, have layers that are loosely attached and will swell greatly when water intervenes between the layers.|$|R

Five distinctive silty-clayey layers were observed in this sequence with <b>allophanes</b> and montmorillonites as the predominant mineralogy.

The adsorption capacities of salmon-sperm DNA on pure synthetic <b>allophane</b> (characterised morphologically and chemically) and on humic-acid-rich synthetic <b>allophane</b> were determined, and the resultant DNA–allophane complexes were characterised using synchrotron-radiation-derived P X-ray absorption near-edge fine structure (XANES) spectroscopy and infrared (IR) spectroscopy. The synthetic <b>allophane</b> adsorbed up to 34 μg mg⁻¹ of salmon-sperm DNA. However, the presence of humic acid significantly lowered the DNA uptake on the synthetic <b>allophane</b> to 3. 5 μg mg⁻¹ by occupying the active sites on <b>allophane</b> so that DNA was repulsed. Both <b>allophane</b> and humic acid adsorbed DNA chemically through its phosphate groups. IR spectra for the allophane–DNA complex showed a chemical change of the Si–O–Al stretching of <b>allophane</b> after DNA adsorption, possibly because of the alteration of the steric distance of the <b>allophane</b> outer wall, or because of the precipitation of aluminium phosphate on <b>allophane</b> after DNA adsorption on it, or both. The aluminol groups of synthetic <b>allophane</b> almost completely reacted with additions of small amounts of DNA (~ 2 – 6 μg mg⁻¹), but the chemical adsorption of DNA on <b>allophane</b> simultaneously {{led to the formation}} of very porous <b>allophane</b> aggregates up to ~ 500 μm in diameter. The formation of the <b>allophane</b> nano- and microaggregates enabled up to 28 μg mg⁻¹ of DNA to be adsorbed (~ 80 % of total) within spaces (pores) between <b>allophane</b> spherules and <b>allophane</b> nanoaggregates (as “physical adsorption”), giving a total of 34 μg mg⁻¹ of DNA adsorbed by the <b>allophane.</b> The stability of the allophane–DNA nano- and microaggregates likely prevents encapsulated DNA from exposure to oxidants, and DNA within small pores between <b>allophane</b> spherules and nanoaggregates may not be accessible to enzymes or microbes, hence enabling DNA protection and preservation in such materials. By implication, substantial organic carbon is therefore likely to be sequestered and protected in allophanic soils (Andisols) in the same way as demonstrated here for DNA, that is, predominantly by encapsulation within a tortuous network of nanopores and submicropores amidst stable nanoaggregates and microaggregates, rather than by chemisorption alone...|$|E

Too often, reagents used to extract particular soil components are evaluated using geological or other specimens that may bear little resemblance to soil minerals formed by pedogenic processes; the investigations of Borggaard (1982) and Chao & Zhou (1983) are two recent examples of such an approach. Insufficient use has been made of difference infrared spectra (Wada & Greenland, 1970) obtained from soil samples.

In the Oxisol extract, no difference in P uptake between both solutions was observed. Also the diffusional flux of P as measured with the DGT technique was larger in the non-filtered than in the 3 -kDa filtered solutions.

The influence of the halloysite particle size and the complexing effect of the acids in relation to the resulting products are discussed.

It is has been detected in surface and groundwater and has been shown to be associated with major human health problems. Atrazine fate in the environment, e. g. sorption, leaching and degradation depends, inter alia, on soil characteristics. Independent static and dynamic experiments were conducted to identify and uncouple the processes governing the fate of atrazine. Two agricultural soils from Mexico with contrasting characteristics in terms of organic matter content and degree of decomposition as well as clay types were selected. Soil organic matter was the main sorbent for atrazine, followed by montmorillonite clays in the Vertisol, and iron oxides and <b>allophanes</b> in the Andosol. Humic acids were predominant in the Andosol's organic matter and favored atrazine sorption, compared to more recalcitrant organic matter such as humin fractions in the Vertisol. Atrazine mobility was enhanced because of the occurrence of preferential flow in the upper layer of the Vertisol and because of the formation of mobile complexes between dissolved organic carbon and atrazine in the Andosol. Our detailed soil characterization and the independent sorption, degradation and transfer experiments allowed identifying the main processes affecting atrazine's fate in the two contrasting soils: In the Vertisol, preferential flow was enhanced because of the lower affinity of the soil's organic matter for atrazine compared to the Andosol.

Topsoil (0 – 5 cm) SOC concentrations were surveyed in a coffee agroforestry watershed (0. 9 km 2) on Andisols in Costa Rica with uniform farm management. We encountered high values and large spatial variations of SOC, from 48. 1 to 172 g kg− 1 in the dry combustion set (SOCref; n = 72) used for calibrating the visible-near-infrared reflectance spectroscopy (VNIRS) samples (SOCVNIRS; 350 – 2500 nm; n = 520). VNIRS using partial least squares regression was effective in predicting SOC (R 2 = 0. 85; a {{root mean square error}} (RMSE) = 12. 3 g kg− 1) and proved an effective proxy measurement. We assessed several topographic, vegetation and andic soil property variables, of which only the latter (metal–humus complexes and <b>allophanes)</b> displayed strong correlations with SOCref concentrations. We compared Random Forest and three geostatistical approaches for the interpolation of SOC in unsampled locations. Ordinary kriging with SOCref yielded an RMSE of 28. 0 g kg− 1. Random Forest was successful in incorporating many weakly and non-linearly correlated covariates with SOC (RMSE = 14. 7 g kg− 1), provided Alp (the sodium pyrophosphate extractable aluminum), the best predictor of SOC (r = 0. 85) but also the most costly variable to acquire. Co-kriging with Alp also showed high reduction in RMSE (16. 0 g kg− 1). Co-kriging with SOCVNIRS only showed marginal reduction in RMSE to 24. 2 g kg− 1 due to the presence of a high nugget effect. Local variability of SOC in this volcanic agroforestry watershed was dominated by andic properties whereas topographic or vegetation variables had very little impact. Estimation of SOC variability is recommended using inexpensive proxy measurements like VNIRS (RMSE = 12. 3 g kg− 1) rather than spatial interpolation techniques. (Résumé d'auteur...|$|R

One of {{the most}} {{interesting}} possibilities of analytical pyrolysis (Py/GC/MS) applied to soil organic matter (SOM) studies lies on identifying ¿pyrolytic markers¿ suitable to forecast ecosystems¿ functional descriptors at high organizational levels, such as SOM biodegradation, water retention, or erosion rates [1]. Concerning the resilience of SOM, it is not clear nowadays whether it depends on its molecular features or, conversely, on organo-mineral interactions, such could be the case of physical protection of non-decomposed SOM or organo-mineral complexes, e. g., those formed with nanoparticle-size <b>allophanes</b> [2]. Up to 200 pyrolytic compounds from humic acids (HA) were identified in volcanic ash soils from Tenerife, Canary Islands (Spain). Simultaneously, soil physico-chemical properties such as the amount of SOM and short-range minerals, total mineralization coefficient (TMC) or aggregate stability were determined. In order to explore the potential of partial least squares regression (PLS) in forecasting soil dependent variables exclusively using the information extracted from analytical pyrolysis, the data matrix consisting of total abundances of pyrolysis compounds was processed. Preliminary results showed that in these volcanic ash soils with large concentration of short-range minerals, the use of pyrolytic signature compounds led to explain a high number of soil emergent properties, e. g., SOM biodegradability, water holding capacity, P retention, or aggregate stability, which coincide with previous research [3], and suggested that formation of stable organomineral complexes and water saturation in nanoparticlesize micropores in thixotropic soils reduce the biodegradation of SOM. On the other hand, the most successful PLS models explaining the biodegradation rates of the SOM (e. g., TMC) using the pyrolytic data as independent variables, showed large importance for projection in the case of compounds corresponding to lignin-derived methoxyphenols and specific alkylbenzenes.
