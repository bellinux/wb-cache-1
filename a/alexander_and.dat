5|$|The {{film was}} {{conceived}} by writers Scott <b>Alexander</b> <b>and</b> Larry Karaszewski {{when they were}} students at the USC School of Cinematic Arts. Irritated at being thought of solely as writers for family films with their work on Problem Child and its sequel, <b>Alexander</b> <b>and</b> Karaszewski {{struck a deal with}} Burton and Denise Di Novi to produce the Ed Wood biopic, and Michael Lehmann as director. Due to scheduling conflicts with Airheads, Lehmann had to vacate the director's position, which was taken over by Burton.|$|E

5|$|After the {{disappearance}} of Olubei from the scene ca. 1458, no princes are known by name until Isaac in 1465, possibly Olubei's son. Isaac was overthrown in 1475 by his brother Alexander due to his pro-Ottoman stance. His reign was brief, as the Ottoman Empire laid siege and conquered Theodoro itself in December. <b>Alexander</b> <b>and</b> his family were taken captive to Constantinople, where the prince was beheaded, his son was forcibly converted to Islam, {{and his wife and}} daughters became part of the Sultan's harem.|$|E
5|$|Afterwards, Alexander {{travelled}} to Ecbatana {{to retrieve}} {{the bulk of the}} Persian treasure. There, his closest friend and possible lover, Hephaestion, died of illness or poisoning. Hephaestion's death devastated <b>Alexander,</b> <b>and</b> he ordered the preparation of an expensive funeral pyre in Babylon, as well as a decree for public mourning. Back in Babylon, Alexander planned a series of new campaigns, beginning with an invasion of Arabia, but he would not have a chance to realize them, as he died shortly thereafter.|$|E
5|$|<b>Alexander</b> <b>and</b> {{his paper}} vocally {{supported}} the old governing {{class of the}} former Confederate States of America and were rabid in {{their opposition to the}} policies of Reconstruction imposed upon the South by the Northern-based Republican Party.

Alexander was forced to liquidate his stake in his money-losing newspaper in 1868.|$|E

5|$|An {{influential}} group {{assembled in}} Britain {{to lobby for}} his release from prison. Headed by Lord Hankey, the group included politicians Lord de L'Isle and Richard Stokes, Field Marshal <b>Alexander</b> <b>and</b> Admiral of the Fleet The Earl of Cork and Orrery, and military historians Basil Liddell Hart and J.

Upon re-gaining the prime ministership in 1951, Winston Churchill, who was {{closely associated with the}} group, gave priority to the quick release of the war criminals remaining in British custody.|$|E
5|$|Ancient authors {{recorded}} that Alexander was {{so pleased}} with portraits of himself created by Lysippos that he forbade other sculptors from crafting his image. Lysippos had often used the contrapposto sculptural scheme to portray <b>Alexander</b> <b>and</b> other characters such as Apoxyomenos, Hermes and Eros. Lysippos' sculpture, {{famous for its}} naturalism, {{as opposed to a}} stiffer, more static pose, is thought to be the most faithful depiction.|$|E
5|$|Attalus was at {{that time}} {{corresponding}} with Demosthenes, regarding the possibility of defecting to Athens.

These summoned creatures include series staples Odin, Shiva, <b>Alexander,</b> <b>and</b> Bahamut, and newcomers Hecatoncheir and Brynhildr. When summoned, the Eidolon stays in combat while the characters accompanying the summoner leave the party. While an Eidolon is summoned, the player can trigger a feature called Gestalt Mode, {{in which the}} Eidolon transforms into a different form and performs different attacks while the summoning character rides them.|$|E
