5|$|After Actium and {{the defeat}} of Antony and Cleopatra, Octavian was in a {{position}} to rule the entire Republic under an unofficial principate—but he had to achieve this through incremental power gains. He did so by courting the Senate and the people while upholding the republican traditions of Rome, appearing that he was not <b>aspiring</b> <b>to</b> dictatorship or monarchy. Marching into Rome, Octavian and Marcus Agrippa were elected as dual consuls by the Senate.|$|E
5|$|By the 18th century, {{four types}} of {{midshipman}} existed: midshipman (original rating), midshipman extraordinary, midshipman (apprentice officer), and midshipman ordinary. Some midshipmen were older men, and while most were officer candidates who failed to pass the lieutenant examination or were passed over for promotion, {{some members of the}} original rating served, as late as 1822, alongside apprentice officers without themselves <b>aspiring</b> <b>to</b> a commission. By 1794, all midshipmen were considered officer candidates, and the original rating was phased out.|$|E

Literature shows that children cannot <b>aspire</b> <b>to</b> attend higher education when they have no knowledge of the opportunities nor realise its purpose. To support this argument, we discuss a project involving primary school students from areas that have been identified as having a low socio-economic status.

5|$|Many central {{government}} officials also began their careers as subordinate officers for commandery-level administrations. There are only rare cases (i.e. involving military merit during rebellions of late Eastern Han) when subordinate officers of county-level administrations {{advanced to the}} level of {{central government}}. Even if one secured an office by these means, an official was still expected to be competent, thus a formal education became the hallmark of those <b>aspiring</b> <b>to</b> fill public office. In addition to private tutoring, the Imperial University was established in 124 BCE which then accommodated only fifty pupils, but by the 2nd century CE the student body had reached about thirty thousand. These students could be appointed by the emperor to various government posts according to their examination grades.|$|E

The Court Astronomer also upheld a literacy test of 9,000 characters for nominees <b>aspiring</b> <b>to</b> become subordinate officials for either the Minister Steward or Palace Assistant Imperial Clerk. These nominees were often recommended subordinates of commandery-level Administrators. Other subordinates of the Minister of Ceremonies reported illegal acts at ancestral temples, prepared sacrificial offerings of food and wine at shrines and temples, and arranged for the music and dancing that accompanied ceremonies.|$|E
5|$|Prior to the {{establishment}} of the Romney Classical Institute in 1846, Romney and its environs had been served by a school as early as 1752, and by Romney Academy, which had been incorporated by the Virginia General Assembly on January 11, 1814. By 1831, Romney Academy had outgrown its educational facilities in an old stone building just north of the Hampshire County Courthouse in Romney. Also at this time, several academies in present-day West Virginia were <b>aspiring</b> <b>to</b> collegiate status, as there were few colleges operating in the region prior to the American Civil War.|$|E

For his secondary education, {{he was sent to}} St. Lawrence College in Ramsgate, Kent, where he joined the Combined Cadet Force (CCF) and eventually rose to senior under-officer. While at school, he developed a dislike of his first name, Francis, after it was mistaken for a girl's and he was invited to a birthday party at which he was the only boy. He eventually switched to his middle name, Richard, when he was fifteen. By then <b>aspiring</b> <b>to</b> become a barrister, Dannatt applied to study law at Emmanuel College, Cambridge but was turned down after an interview, at which point his ambition switched towards a military career.|$|E

5|$|Other powers <b>aspiring</b> <b>to</b> the Livonian Baltic access {{responded by}} {{partitioning}} the Livonian state, which triggered the lengthy Livonian War, fought between 1558 and 1583. Ivan IV of Russia took Dorpat (Tartu) and Narva in 1558, {{and soon the}} Danes and Swedes had occupied {{other parts of the}} country. To protect the integrity of their country, the Livonians now sought a union with the Polish–Lithuanian state. Gotthard Kettler, the new Grand Master, met in Vilnius (Vilna, Wilno) with Sigismund Augustus in 1561 and declared Livonia a vassal state under the Polish king. The Union of Vilnius called for secularization of the Brothers of the Sword Order and incorporation of the newly established Duchy of Livonia into the Rzeczpospolita ("Republic") as an autonomous entity. The Duchy of Courland and Semigallia was also created as a separate fief, to be ruled by Kettler. Sigismund II obliged himself to recover the parts of Livonia lost to Moscow and the Baltic powers, which had led to grueling wars with Russia (1558–1570 and 1577–1582) and heavy struggles also concerning the fundamental issues of control of the Baltic trade and freedom of navigation.|$|E

5|$|The Brazilian {{constitution}} of 1988 {{called for a}} general vote on {{the restoration of the}} monarchy, which was held in 1993. The royalists went to the polls divided, with the press indicating there were actually two princes <b>aspiring</b> <b>to</b> the Brazilian throne (Dom Luiz de Orleans e Bragança and Dom João Henrique); this created some confusion among the voters. Voting tickets further divided the electorate by placing one box for a presidential republic on the ballot and four for a monarchy. Additional anti-monarchial sentiment was generated by several aggressive television commercials claiming that a vote for monarchy would be a vote for the return of slavery for blacks and a loss of Brazil's recent return to democracy after decades of military dictatorship. This result was a loss for the monarchists at the polls.|$|E
5|$|Alexander the Great's {{conquest of}} the Achaemenid Empire in 332 BC {{introduced}} Hellenistic culture to the Middle East. After Alexander's death in 323 BC, his empire split among his generals and in the end, much {{of the land of}} modern-day Jordan was disputed between the Ptolemies based in Egypt and the Seleucids based in Syria. In the south and east, the Nabataeans had an independent kingdom. The Nabataeans were nomadic Arabs who derived wealth from their capital Petra, whose proximity to major trade routes led to it becoming a regional trading hub. Campaigns by different Greek generals <b>aspiring</b> <b>to</b> annex the Nabataean Kingdom were unsuccessful. The Ptolemies were eventually displaced from the region by the Seleucid Empire. The conflict between these two groups enabled the Nabataeans to extend their kingdom northwards well beyond Petra in Edom. The Nabataeans are known for their great ability in constructing efficient water collecting methods in the barren desert and their talent in carving structures into solid rocks — notably the Khazneh (treasury). These nomads spoke Arabic and wrote in Nabataean alphabets, which were developed from Aramaic script during the 2nd century BC, and are regarded by scholars to have evolved into the Arabic alphabet around the 4th century AD.|$|E
