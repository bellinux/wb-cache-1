Members of the subfamily Microraptorinae, such as Microraptor, have been suggested to have been aerodynamic and may have glided. Microraptorines are usually noted for their long and robust forelimbs and large, asymmetrical flight feathers. However, the shortened forelimbs, small furcula, and the transversely wide coracoid in Tianyuraptor suggest that it was not suited for aerodynamic gliding or flight.|$|E

40|$|Prior {{studies have}} argued and {{regularly}} found that cultural distance is {{negatively related to}} bilateral export flows, which are the sum of <b>arm’s</b> <b>length</b> and intra-firm exports. However, these macro-level studies overlook the firm-level insights that <b>arm’s</b> <b>length</b> exports are a substitute for <b>arm’s</b> <b>length</b> affiliate sales, and that firms’ choices between these substitutes are influenced by cultural distance. Moreover, intra-firm exports are a complement to <b>arm’s</b> <b>length</b> affiliate sales and hence likely to respond {{in the same way}} to cultural distance as such sales. The inclusion of intra-firm exports in export flows has thus obscured the effect of cultural distance on aggregate <b>arm’s</b> <b>length</b> exports. We overcome these conceptual and methodological deficiencies by examining how cultural distance influences aggregate <b>arm’s</b> <b>length</b> exports, while simultaneously considering its impact on aggregate <b>arm’s</b> <b>length</b> affiliate sales. Drawing on several strands of firm-level international business (IB) research, we argue that while <b>arm’s</b> <b>length</b> affiliate sales are likely to decline with cultural distance, this is not necessarily the case with <b>arm’s</b> <b>length</b> exports, whichmay in fact increase with cultural distance. Analyzing a panel dataset of US foreign affiliate sales and US exports to unaffiliated parties, we find that cultural distance negatively affects <b>arm’s</b> <b>length</b> affiliate sales but positively affects <b>arm’s</b> <b>length</b> exports. Our study thus shows that the explicit consideration of firm-level entry mode choices helps us better understand and explain macro-level IB activity...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: This paper studies a {{multinational}} firm’s transfer price decisions in imperfectly competitive market settings. It investigates whether the firm’s optimal transfer price {{coincides with the}} <b>arm’s</b> <b>length</b> price and examines how the firm might respond if it is compelled to follow the <b>arm’s</b> <b>length</b> principle. The main findings are: (1) {{in the absence of}} tax transfer incentives, the firm’s optimal transfer price does not coincide with the <b>arm’s</b> <b>length</b> price. If the firm is compelled to follow the <b>arm’s</b> <b>length</b> principle, it has an incentive to circumvent the <b>arm’s</b> <b>length</b> principle by keeping two sets of books, one for internal management, and another for tax reporting purposes; (2) the <b>arm’s</b> <b>length</b> principle can affect the MNF’s decision on whether or not to foreclose its competitor. Absent profit shifting incentives, the firm will foreclose its downstream competitor. Imposing the <b>arm’s</b> <b>length</b> principle induces the firm to supply its competitor, but the firm can revert to its foreclosure decision by keeping two sets of books. If the firm’s upstream and downstream divisions face different tax rates, the firm’s foreclosure decision will be reversed if the <b>arm’s</b> <b>length</b> principle is enforced.

2500|$|Miller {{worked on}} {{increasingly}} larger interferometers, culminating in {{one with a}} [...] (effective) <b>arm</b> <b>length</b> that he tried at various sites, including {{on top of a}} mountain at the Mount Wilson Observatory. To avoid the possibility of the aether wind being blocked by solid walls, his mountaintop observations used a special shed with thin walls, mainly of canvas. From noisy, irregular data, he consistently extracted a small positive signal that varied with each rotation of the device, with the sidereal day, and on a yearly basis. His measurements in the 1920s amounted to approximately [...] instead of the nearly [...] expected from the Earth's orbital motion alone. He remained convinced this was due to partial entrainment or aether dragging, though he did not attempt a detailed explanation. He ignored critiques demonstrating the inconsistency of his results and the refutation by the Hammar experiment. Miller's findings were considered important at the time, and were discussed by Michelson, Lorentz and others at a meeting reported in 1928. There was general agreement that more experimentation was needed to check Miller's results. Miller later built a non-magnetic device to eliminate magnetostriction, while Michelson built one of non-expanding Invar to eliminate any remaining thermal effects. Other experimenters from around the world increased accuracy, eliminated possible side effects, or both. So far, no one has been able to replicate Miller's results, and modern experimental accuracies have ruled them out. Roberts (2006) has pointed out that the primitive data reduction techniques used by Miller and other early experimenters, including Michelson and Morley, were capable of creating apparent periodic signals even when none existed in the actual data. After reanalyzing Miller's original data using modern techniques of quantitative error analysis, Roberts found Miller's apparent signals to be statistically insignificant.|$|E

40|$|The <b>arm’s</b> <b>length</b> {{principle}} has {{now been}} for almost eighty years the basis for business income allocation in international tax. The principle permeates many of {{the provisions of the}} OECD Model, and in particular those who concern the attribution of income to permanent establishments, the relationship between associated enterprises and certain source tax limitations. Also, it is remarkable that, within the OECD Model, the <b>arm’s</b> <b>length</b> principle is attributed, explicitly or implicitly, predominance over non-discrimination provisions. In more recent years, the <b>arm’s</b> <b>length</b> based rules of the OECD Model have been progressively implemented in EU directives and in the Arbitration Convention. Not least, the <b>arm’s</b> <b>length</b> standard has lately become, even though in circumscribed instances, part of the VAT system. Notwithstanding this wide recognition, some difficulties have arisen in the coordination of such principle with the fundamental freedoms guaranteed by the EC Treaty (now TFEU).

However, having framed national <b>arm’s</b> <b>length</b> based legislation in the scheme of the abuse of law may endanger the effectiveness of such legislation and, at the same time, seems to underestimate the necessity to find adequate remedies to double taxation which may derive from unilateral <b>arm’s</b> <b>length</b> based income adjustments. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|M. Comm. The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{determine}} the meaning of 'arm's length transactions' as stated in the Income Tax Act, Act 58 of 1962. Although the meaning of <b>arm's</b> <b>length</b> transactions have been properly interpreted by our courts, no guidelines or policy documents pertaining to this concept, have been issued by the South African Revenue Services in as far as it relates to transfer pricing. Several of the developed countries have adopted the guidelines of the Organisation of Economic Co-ordination and Development regarding transfer prices and the <b>arm's</b> <b>length</b> principle in respect of international transactions. The substance of <b>arm's</b> <b>length</b> transactions : The concept of <b>arm's</b> <b>length</b> is not easy to state: it is not unlike the proverbial elephant which could easily be recognised, but could not be defined. It can be defined by reference to the terms of the transaction in question, or by reference to the relationship between the parties to it, or by reference to both of these factors. Normally, parties enter into an <b>arm's</b> <b>length</b> transaction when each party: • Is independent of the other; and • Strives to get the utmost possible advantage from the transaction for himself. The effects of an <b>arm's</b> <b>length</b> transaction are: • The rights and obligations created by the transaction are more likely to be regarded as normal than abnormal; and • The means and manner employed in entering into the transaction are more likely to be normal than abnormal. It is clear that the meaning of <b>arm's</b> <b>length</b> is defined, but that the effect of such transactions will depend on the facts of each case. What may be normal in one case can be abnormal in another depending on the underlying facts. Although South African transfer pricing legislation includes the <b>arm's</b> <b>length</b> principle in respect of international transactions, legislation on transfer pricing should be more clear as to what is normal or abnormal in respect of international transactions...|$|R

The uncertainty about future success diminishes gradually with the arrival of additional funding. The entrepreneur controls the funds and can divert them. We distinguish between relationship financing, meaning that the entrepreneur's allocation of the funds is observable, and <b>arm's</b> <b>length</b> financing, where it is unobservable. We find that equilibrium funding stops altogether too early relative to the efficient stopping time in both financing modes. We characterize the optimal contracts and equilibrium funding decisions. The financial constraints will typically become tighter over time under relationship finance, and looser under <b>arm's</b> <b>length</b> financing. The trade-off is that while relationship financing may require smaller information rents, <b>arm's</b> <b>length</b> financing amounts to an implicit commitment to a finite funding horizon. The lack of such a commitment under relationship financing implies that the sustainable release of funds eventually slows down.
