25|$|Another {{scene in}} the film recreates the Great Court Run, in which the runners attempt to run around the {{perimeter}} of the Great Court at Trinity College, Cambridge in the time it takes the clock to strike 12 at midday. The film shows Abrahams performing the feat for the first time in history. In fact, Abrahams never attempted this race, and at the time of filming the only person on record known to have succeeded was Lord Burghley, in 1927. In Chariots of Fire, Lindsay, who is based on Lord Burghley, runs the Great Court Run with Abrahams in order to spur him on, and crosses the finish line just <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> <b>too</b> late. Since the film's release, the Great Court Run has also been successfully run by Trinity undergraduate Sam Dobin, in October 2007.|$|E
25|$|Shortly afterwards, John Paul Jones got the {{opportunity}} {{he had been}} striving for—not <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> <b>too</b> soon, as his ship had been holed below the waterline and was becoming increasingly unresponsive. Serapis’ jib-boom caught in the rigging of Bonhomme Richard’s mizzen mast, and Jones immediately led his crew in attaching the two ships together as strongly as they could. Seeing the danger, Pearson dropped anchor. Because both ships were under sail, when Serapis {{came to an abrupt}} halt, Bonhomme Richard would keep going, and with luck, tear free. Jones’ men had been very efficient, so what actually happened was that Bonhomme Richard’s motion was turned into a rotation, and the two ships, still firmly attached, ended up side-by-side, facing in opposite directions, their great guns touching each other’s hull planks. Better still for Jones, Serapis’ spare anchor caught in the woodwork of Bonhomme Richard’s stern, locking the two ships in that extraordinary position. Making a virtue of necessity, Pearson’s crew fired broadsides straight into Bonhomme Richard’s hull, tearing huge holes in its side, and doing terrible damage to the gun-decks. For Jones’s boarding plan to succeed, he needed to drive all the Royal Navy sailors from Serapis’ deck before his ship was destroyed beneath him. He had prepared well for such an eventuality, and his men at stations up the masts were equipped both with small guns and with incendiary grenades. Three 9-pound guns on the quarter-deck (the rear part of the upper deck) were still usable, although one was on the wrong side, and had to be dragged around. Two of these guns were loaded with anti-personnel grapeshot to help drive Pearson’s men from the deck, but the third was used with solid bar-shot (see Naval Artillery page) aimed at Serapis’ main-mast.|$|E
500|$|The Poles' gift of Enigma {{decryption}} {{to their}} Western allies, five {{weeks before the}} outbreak of World War II, came not <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> <b>too</b> soon. Knowledge that the cipher was crackable was a morale boost to Allied cryptologists. [...] The British were able to manufacture at least two complete sets of perforated sheets—they sent one to PC Bruno, outside Paris, in mid-December 1939—and began reading Enigma within months of the outbreak of war.|$|E

60|$|The captain eyed him. Many {{years of}} command at sea {{had given him}} a fine manner, and force of habit was for <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> almost <b>too</b> much for Bill and his friends. But only for <b>a</b> <b>moment.</b>|$|R

500|$|The Poles' gift, {{to their}} western Allies, of Enigma decryption, five {{weeks before the}} {{outbreak}} of World War II, came not <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> <b>too</b> soon. [...] Former Bletchley Park mathematician-cryptologist Gordon Welchman has written: [...] "Ultra would never have gotten off the ground {{if we had not}} learned from the Poles, in the nick of time, the details both of the German military... Enigma machine, and of the operating procedures that were in use." [...] Allied Supreme Commander Dwight D. Eisenhower, at war's end, described intelligence from Bletchley Park as having been [...] "of priceless value to me. It has simplified my task as a commander enormously." [...] Eisenhower expressed his thanks for this [...] "decisive contribution to the Allied war effort." ...|$|E
2500|$|His second album, Not <b>a</b> <b>Moment</b> <b>Too</b> Soon, {{was much}} more successful, {{becoming}} the best-selling country album in 1994. The first single, [...] "Indian Outlaw", caused considerable controversy, as critics argued that it presented Native Americans in a patronizing way. Some radio stations refused to play it, but the controversy helped spur sales, and the song became McGraw's first top 10 country single (getting as high as No.8), and reaching No.15 on the Billboard Hot 100.|$|E
2500|$|The second single {{from the}} album, [...] "Don't Take the Girl", became McGraw's first No.1 country hit, in {{addition}} to reaching number 17 on the Hot 100, and [...] "helped cement his image as a ruggedly good-looking guy with a sensitive side." [...] By year's end, [...] "Down on the Farm" [...] had peaked at number 2 on the country charts; after it, the album's title track became his second number 1 single in early 1995, and [...] "Refried Dreams" [...] reached number 5 afterward. The album sold over 6 million copies, topping the Billboard 200 {{as well as the}} country album charts. [...] On the strength of this success, McGraw won Academy of Country Music awards for Album of the Year and Top New Male Vocalist in 1994. Billboard named Not <b>a</b> <b>Moment</b> <b>Too</b> Soon as the top country album of 1994 on Billboard Year-End.|$|E

2500|$|McGraw began {{singing in}} a neotraditional country style, but {{starting}} with 1997's Everywhere, he developed a more crossover-friendly, country pop sound, making {{him one of the}} first male Country singers of his generation to crossover to Pop. McGraw has released fourteen studio albums (eleven for Curb Records and three for Big Machine Records). 10 of those albums have reached number 1 on the Top Country Albums charts, with his 1994 breakthrough album Not <b>a</b> <b>Moment</b> <b>Too</b> Soon being the top country album of 1994. All of these albums have produced 65 singles, 25 of which have reached number 1 on the Hot Country Songs or Country Airplay charts. Three of these singles — [...] "It's Your Love," [...] "Just to See You Smile," [...] and [...] "Live Like You Were Dying" [...] — were the top country songs of 1997, 1998, and 2004 according to Billboard Year-End. He has also won three Grammy Awards, 14 Academy of Country Music awards, 11 Country Music Association (CMA) awards, 10 American Music Awards, and three People's Choice Awards. His Soul2Soul II Tour with Faith Hill is one of the highest grossing tours in country music history, and one of the top 5 among all genres of music.|$|E
2500|$|Joe Morgenstern of The Wall Street Journal {{gave the}} film a {{positive}} review, saying [...] "Puss made his debut in [...] "Shrek 2," [...] then did {{time in the}} two decreasingly funny sequels. Now he's got a movie of his own, and not <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> <b>too</b> soon." [...] Lisa Kennedy of The Denver Post gave the film {{three out of four}} stars, saying [...] "It would overstate matters to say Puss in Boots leaves its cat holding the bag (we had to get that in). But it also leaves its hero awaiting a richer fable, one befitting his charms and his portrayer's talents." [...] Anna Smith of Time Out gave the film three out of five stars, saying [...] "Puss in Boots is uneven, but when it's on course, cat fans will be in heaven." [...] Amy Biancolli of the Houston Chronicle gave the film three out of five stars, saying [...] "Puss in Boots prances along on three basic truths. One, cats are funny. Two, vain Spanish cats in high-heeled musketeer boots are even funnier. Lastly, booted, vain Spanish cats voiced by a breathy Antonio Banderas are flat-out hilarious." [...] Tasha Robinson of The A.V. Club gave the film a C+, saying [...] "Puss In Boots makes a great theme-park ride, a thrill-a-minute feast for the eyes and the semicircular canals. But while the settings are impressively multidimensional, the characters are flatter than old-school cel drawings." ...|$|E
2500|$|French met General Charles Lanrezac, {{commanding}} the French Fifth Army on his right, at Rethel (17 August)—they {{were met by}} Lanrezac's Chief of Staff Hely d'Oissel, with the words: [...] "At last you’re here: it’s not <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> <b>too</b> soon. [...] If we are beaten we will owe it to you". They conferred in private {{despite the fact that}} Lanrezac spoke no English and Sir John could speak little French, Wilson being eventually called over to translate. [...] French asked whether the German advance forces spotted at Huy would cross the Meuse River (a reasonable question, as a westward crossing of the Meuse exposed the BEF to encirclement from the west)—his inability to pronounce the name [...] "Huy" [...] caused Lanrezac to exclaim in exasperation that the Germans had probably [...] "come [...] [...] [...] to fish"; French understood the tone but not the meaning, and Wilson tactfully translated that the Germans would indeed cross the river. [...] French informed Lanrezac that his forces would not be ready until 24 August, three days later than promised. [...] The French cavalry under André Sordet, which Sir John had previously asked Joffre in vain to be placed under his command, were further north trying to maintain contact with the Belgians. [...] Sir John, concerned that he had only four infantry divisions rather than the planned six, wanted to keep Allenby's cavalry division in reserve and refused Lanrezac's request that he lend it for reconnaissance in front of the French forces (Lanrezac misunderstood that French intended to use the British cavalry as mounted infantry). [...] French and Lanrezac came away from the meeting with a poor relationship. [...] At the time French wrote in his diary that Lanrezac was [...] "a very capable soldier", although he claimed otherwise in his memoirs 1914. [...] Besides their mutual dislike he believed Lanrezac was about to take the offensive, whereas Lanrezac had in fact been forbidden by Joffre to fall back and wanted the BEF moved back further to clear roads for a possible French retreat.|$|E
60|$|Lutchester {{paused for}} <b>a</b> <b>moment.</b> Sonia, <b>too,</b> seemed {{suddenly}} to have awakened {{into a state}} of tense and vivid emotion.

6000|$|This {{time the}} man's mutterings became inaudible. Nicolaes Beresteyn and Stoutenburg could only guess what was passing {{in the narrow}} {{corridor}} of the house opposite.

5000|$|I'm real happy {{poetry is}} on television. My hat {{is off to}} Russell Simmons, who {{has found a way}} to get poems on HBO in a way that feeds his own business.
