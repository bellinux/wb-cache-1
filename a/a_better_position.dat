5|$|Stamford {{branch manager}} Josh Porter (Charles Esten) reveals {{that he has}} {{leveraged}} the situation to obtain <b>a</b> <b>better</b> <b>position</b> at Staples, throwing the restructuring into disarray. The new plan is to close Stamford instead, and Jan offers Jim Halpert (John Krasinski) the number two position in Scranton, but he is reluctant to accept it.|$|E
5|$|In early 1953, North Korean forces {{launched}} a large-scale attack against Hill 812, {{which was then}} {{under the control of}} K Company, 3rd Battalion, 179th Infantry. The ensuing Battle of Hill Eerie was {{one of a series of}} larger attacks by Chinese and North Korean forces which produced heavier fighting than the previous year had seen. These offensives were conducted largely in order to secure <b>a</b> <b>better</b> <b>position</b> during the ongoing truce negotiations. Chinese forces continued to mount concentrated attacks on the lines of the UN forces, including the 45th Infantry Division, but the division managed to hold most of its ground, remaining stationary until the end of the war in the summer of 1953.|$|E
5|$|As the Soviets {{approached}} Berlin, Hitler's {{efforts to}} organise the defence {{of the city}} became ever more meaningless and futile. His last birthday, celebrated at the Führerbunker in Berlin on 20 April 1945, was the occasion for leave-taking for many top Nazis, Göring included. By this time, Carinhall had been evacuated, the building destroyed, and its art treasures moved to Berchtesgaden and elsewhere. Göring arrived at his estate at Obersalzberg on 22 April, {{the same day that}} Hitler, in a lengthy diatribe against his generals, first publicly admitted that the war was lost and that he intended to remain in Berlin to the end and then commit suicide. He also stated that Göring was in <b>a</b> <b>better</b> <b>position</b> to negotiate a peace settlement. In 1941—a week after the start of the Soviet invasion—Hitler had issued a decree naming Göring his successor in the event of his death.|$|E

5|$|In June 1951, {{with peace}} talks {{underway}} in Panmunjom, the Ranger company was employed aggressively in offensive roles {{as a means}} to secure <b>a</b> <b>better</b> <b>position</b> for the UN at the bargaining table. After a number of operations north of the 38th parallel with the 7th Division, on 8 June the Rangers were moved to attack Hill 772, an operation crafted by Allen to win a strategically advantageous high ground position along the front line. That morning, the company, with support from 7th Division artillery, advanced on the hill, which was first blanketed with napalm strikes from U.S. Air Force P-51 Mustangs. Chinese forces resisted sporadically but withdrew {{at the end of the}} day having lost eight men killed and another thirty wounded. Against this the Rangers had lost only seven wounded. On 11 July, the Rangers continued the attack, backed by the 31st RCT who seized high ground near Sanying-ni and forced Chinese troops to retreat further. In this attack, one Ranger was killed and eight were wounded.|$|E
5|$|Later that day, Gale {{received}} {{orders that}} the 49th (West Riding) Infantry Division would take Pont Audemer. Convinced {{he was in}} <b>a</b> <b>better</b> <b>position</b> to capture the crossing over the River Risle there, he ordered the Netherlands Infantry Brigade to move and join the 5th Parachute Brigade in taking the town. On 26August {{the men of the}} parachute brigade, some mounted on the Cromwell tanks of the 6th Airborne Armoured Reconnaissance Regiment, raced towards the bridge from the east while the Dutch headed there from the west. The Dutch brigade arrived first, just minutes after the Germans destroyed the bridge, slightly ahead of the 7th Parachute Battalion. The Dutch brigade moved to secure the heights overlooking the river, while the 5th Parachute Brigade occupied the town.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, 5 Platoon was in dire straits and was {{beginning}} to run low of ammunition, while a number of its M60 machine-guns were also beginning to fail because of the prolonged firing. Moving to outflank the heavily outnumbered Australians, Viet Cong were observed emerging from their bunkers. Indeed, only heavy indirect fire and effective suppressing fire from helicopter gunships prevented them from being overrun. Attempting to gain <b>a</b> <b>better</b> <b>position</b> to direct the fire, the B Company Forward Observer, Lieutenant Ian Mathers, moved forward to 5 Platoon, and was killed almost immediately. However, by 09:15 the remainder of B Company was able to link up with the beleaguered platoon, and after an aerial resupply of ammunition, stabilised the situation temporarily.|$|E

5|$|Strategically, the Allied {{mission was}} simple. The fleet {{needed to protect}} the flank of the army at Thermopylae, whilst not being cut off themselves. For the Persians, the {{strategic}} situation was equally simple, although with more options. They needed to force their way through either one of Thermopylae or Artemisium (since holding both was necessary for the Allied effort), or to outflank either position. Outflanking the Straits of Artemisium was theoretically much easier than outflanking Thermopylae, by sailing around {{the east coast of}} Euboea. The Greek position at Artemisium may have been chosen in order to watch for such attempts. If narrowness of the channel had been the only determinant, the Allies could have found <b>a</b> <b>better</b> <b>position</b> near the city of Histiaea.|$|E
5|$|The game {{begins in}} a city on the planet Efate. Here, as on all explorable planets in this game, the player observes the party and its {{surroundings}} from a directly overhead {{point of view and}} issues commands via hotkeys or clickable icons displayed onscreen. The explorable terrain of planets is limited to certain cities and immediately adjacent regions. Cities feature several types of buildings that are a recurrent feature on most planets, including a store for purchasing or selling armor, weapons and other items, a library, hospital, police station, and a starport for launching and outfitting a spaceship. Some cities host additional visitable buildings which may include a tavern or a hotel in which important non-player characters are located. Building types are color-coded for easier player identification. The player directs the party's movements and issues commands to perform various actions such as communicating with non-player characters, using objects or firing a weapon. Combat takes place in real-time and requires the player to direct individual party members to target opponents and fire their weapons, reload, or move to <b>a</b> <b>better</b> <b>position.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{narrative}} {{shifts to}} 1983; {{in the wake}} of the Falklands War, Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher and her Conservative government enjoy huge public popularity as the general election approaches, while Labour's left-wing election manifesto loses them key voters. Whilst the Conservatives win a landslide victory, building upon their existing majority, Brown is elected as the new Member of Parliament for Dunfermline East. In London, he is shown to his office in the Houses of Parliament. John Smith (Frank Kelly), a senior Labour MP, introduces Brown to Blair, his new office-mate and the new MP for Sedgefield. Blair makes pleasantries with Brown and, though Brown is not initially impressed, the two become friends. Smith soon introduces the pair to Peter Mandelson (Paul Rhys), Neil Kinnock's director of communications. Shortly afterwards, Kinnock appoints Blair to be an assistant Treasury spokesman. Brown turns down a promotion to the Scottish Office, hoping <b>a</b> <b>better</b> <b>position</b> will come along. He and Blair discuss their political futures and both agree that, of the two, Brown would make a better leader of the party.|$|E
40|$|We {{adapt the}} product-space methodological {{approach}} of Hausmann and Klinger {{to the case}} of Italian provinces and regions in order to examine {{the extent to which the}} network connectedness and centrality of a province’s exports is related to its economic performance. We construct a new Product Space Position (PSP) index which retains many of the Hausmann-Klinger features but which is also much better suited to handling regional and provincial data. We also compare PSP performance with two other export composition indices. <b>A</b> <b>better</b> <b>positioning</b> in the export-network product space is indeed associated with <b>a</b> <b>better</b> local economic outcomes...|$|R
40|$|The {{accuracy}} of brackets placement {{is a key}} factor in successful orthodontic therapy. An in vitro study was conducted in ten models from a natural maxillary teeth model in order to compare the {{accuracy of}} brac- kets placement between two direct bonding instru- ments: the Pole-like Bracket Positioning Gauge and the Star-like Bracket Positioning Gauge. Our results have shown that: The Star-like Bracket Positioning Gauge is more precise in placing brackets vertically, whereas the Pole-like Bracket <b>Positioning</b> Gauge al-lows <b>a</b> <b>better</b> angulation of the bracket. Considering each tooth separately, there is no statistically signifi-cant difference between the two positioning gauges, except that the Star-like gauge gives better results in bracket’s height for the second premolar and the ca-nine, whereas the Pole-like gauge allows for <b>a</b> <b>better</b> <b>positioning</b> and <b>a</b> <b>better</b> vertical angulation of the brackets for the lateral incisor. No statistically signi- ficant difference was found between the two gauges on the mesiodistal position. Overall, the Star-like gau- ge showed <b>a</b> <b>better</b> accuracy in <b>positioning</b> brackets...|$|R
5000|$|Following {{his return}} Hofmann got {{injured in the}} first game of the season and {{therefore}} missed half the season.

He is also called [...] "soccer-god" [...] by the fans because of his technical skills, his commitment and his endurance (he did not miss a minute of the 2008 season). Hofmann is also known as a player who rather passes the ball to <b>a</b> <b>better</b> <b>positioned</b> player than having a shoot at goal.|$|R

40|$|The {{effect of}} quantum dot (QD) size on the {{performance}} of quantum dot intermediate band solar cells is investigated. A numerical model is used to calculate the bound state energy levels and the absorption coefficient of transitions from the ground state to all other states in the conduction band. Comparing with {{the current state of the}} art, strong absorption enhancements are found for smaller quantum dots, as well as <b>a</b> <b>better</b> <b>positioning</b> of the energy levels, which is expected to reduce thermal carrier escape. It is concluded that reducing the quantum dot size can increase sub-bandgap photocurrent and improve voltage preservation...|$|R

25|$|In {{spite of}} the rights {{mentioned}} in an official contract, in practice the rights were ineffective. In the case of conflicts matters were often settled out of court, {{not only in the}} case of nonpayment of salary but also in the case of physical abuses. Under the Kafala system a domestic worker might be administratively detained in the event of fleeing the household of the employer. That in turn places the employer in <b>a</b> <b>better</b> <b>position</b> when negotiating the rights of the worker. As a result, the domestic workers often drop the charges against the employer or even refrain from filing a case before the court.|$|E
