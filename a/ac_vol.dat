Spanish bay is quite the same as Caracasbay except that it is less sheltered against the tradewinds. Spanish Port is a narrow channel connecting Spanish Water with the bay and shows the transition in the different nature of the water. This difference has a great influence on the fauna as is shown especially by the coral population. For the rest the coralfauna of the West Indies is extensively described by POURTALÈS (III. Cat. Mus.

DMTCS <b>vol.</b> <b>AC,</b> p. 69 - 82, 2003. International audienceConsider the single server queue with an infinite buffer and a FIFO discipline, either of type M/M/ 1 or Geom/Geom/ 1. Denote by A the arrival process and by s the services. Assume the stability condition to be satisfied. Denote by D the departure process in equilibrium and by r the time spent by the customers {{at the very back}} of the queue. We prove that (D,r) has the same law as (A,s) which is an extension of the classical Burke Theorem. In fact, r can be viewed as the departures from a dual storage model. This duality between the two models also appears when studying the transient behavior of a tandem by means of the RSK algorithm: the first and last row of the resulting semi-standard Young tableau are respectively the last instant of departure in the queue and the total number of departures in the store...|$|R
40|$|The {{electrical}} and dielectric properties of polyamide 6 (PA 6) /multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNT) nanocomposites prepared by melt mixing were investigated by employing dielectric relaxation spectroscopy in broad frequency (10 (- 2) - 10 (6) Hz) and temperature ranges (from - 150 to 150 degrees C). Transmission electron microscopy revealed a good state of CNT dispersion in the polymeric matrix. The percolation threshold (p(c)) {{was found to}} be 1. 7 vol. % by using the dependence of both dc conductivity and critical frequency (f(c)) from dc to <b>ac</b> transition on <b>vol.</b> % concentration in MWCNT. The actual aspect ratio of the nanotubes in the nanocomposites was calculated using a theoretical model (proposed by Garboczi et al.) and the obtained value was correlated with the p(c) value according to the excluded volume theory. Additionally, the contact resistance (R-c) between the conductive nanotubes {{was found to be}} similar to 10 (5) Omega. Investigation of the temperature dependence of conductivity revealed a charge transport which is controlled by thermal fluctuation-induced tunneling for temperatures up to the glass transition. Finally, it was shown that the addition of nanotubes has no significant influence on the relaxation mechanisms of the PA 6 matrix. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|AbstractIn this study, new blended fuels {{were formed}} by adding 3 – 10 vol. % of acetone into a regular gasoline. According {{to the best}} of the author's knowledge, {{it is the first time}} that the {{influence}} of acetone blends has been studied in a gasoline-fueled engine. The blended fuels were tested for their energy efficiencies and pollutant emissions using SI (spark-ignition) engine with single-cylinder and 4 -stroke. Experimental results showed that the <b>AC</b> 3 (3 <b>vol.</b> % acetone[*]+[*] 97 vol. % gasoline) blended fuel has an advantage over the neat gasoline in exhaust gases temperature, in-cylinder pressure, brake power, torque and volumetric efficiency by about 0. 8 %, 2. 3 %, 1. 3 %, 0. 45 % and 0. 9 %, respectively. As the acetone content increases in the blends, as the engine performance improved where the best performance obtained in this study at the blended fuel of AC 10. In particular, exhaust gases temperature, in-cylinder pressure, brake power, torque and volumetric efficiency increase by about 5 %, 10. 5 %, 5. 2 %, 2. 1 % and 3. 2 %, respectively, compared to neat gasoline. In addition, the use of acetone with gasoline fuel reduces exhaust emissions averagely by about 43 % for carbon monoxide, 32 % for carbon dioxide and 33 % for the unburnt hydrocarbons. The enhanced engine performance and pollutant emissions are attributed to the higher oxygen content, slight leaning effect, lower knock tendency and high flame speeds of acetone, compared to the neat gasoline. Finally the mechanism of acetone combustion in gasoline-fueled engines is proposed in this work; two main pathways for acetone combustion are highlighted; furthermore, the CO, CO 2 and UHC (unburnt hydrocarbons) mechanisms of formation and oxidation are acknowledged. Such acetone mechanism is employed for further understanding acetone combustion in spark-ignition engines...|$|R
