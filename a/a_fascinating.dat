5|$|In 2013, Gary Wilkinson {{produced}} and directed The Frank Jenner Question, a documentary film featuring interviews with Jenner's daughter {{and people who}} had become Christians because of Jenner's evangelism. Claire Goodwin encouraged people to emulate Jenner by including an account of his evangelism in her 2013 book Compelled to Tell: <b>A</b> <b>Fascinating</b> Journey from a New York Dead-End Street to a Lifetime of Ministry and Soul-Winning.|$|E
5|$|British Army Captain Walker goes missing {{during an}} {{expedition}} and is believed dead ("Overture"). His widow, Mrs. Walker, {{gives birth to}} their son, Tommy ("It's a Boy"). Years later, Captain Walker returns home and discovers that his wife has found a new lover. The Captain murders this man in an altercation as Tommy watches. Tommy's mother convinces him {{that he did not}} see or hear the incident and must never tell anyone about it; as a result, he becomes deaf, dumb, and blind to the outside world ("1921"). Tommy now relies on his sense of touch and imagination, developing <b>a</b> <b>fascinating</b> inner psyche ("Amazing Journey/Sparks").|$|E
5|$|In 1827, he {{published}} two volumes of Personal Sketches of His Own Times. In 1830, by an address from both Houses of Parliament, he {{was removed from}} the Bench, in consequence of well-proven misappropriation of public moneys. The third volume of Personal Sketches appeared in 1833 as did the delayed volume of his Historic Memoirs. This book was subsequently reproduced in a cheaper form as The Rise and Fall of the Irish Nation. His works are interesting, racy, and valuable – although his statements of fact cannot always be depended on – containing much of personal incident, related in <b>a</b> <b>fascinating</b> style. He died at Versailles on 8 April 1834.|$|E

5|$|With Homer and Lisa re-united, {{he tells}} her that it is all right to take risks in life. The two decide {{to go to the}} museum after all, by {{illegally}} entering since it is now closed. While there, they make <b>a</b> <b>fascinating</b> discovery that the Orb of Isis is a music box which had gone overlooked by scientists and museum staff. Lisa concludes that what her father said about risks was right– until the alarm goes off and guard dogs chase them out of the building.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} of his sudden death in 1940, Scott {{believed}} himself a failure, and Zelda's death in 1948 was little noted. However, interest in the Fitzgeralds surged in the years following their deaths. In 1950, screenwriter Budd Schulberg, who knew the couple from his Hollywood years, wrote The Disenchanted, with characters based recognizably on the Fitzgeralds who end up as forgotten former celebrities, he awash with alcohol and she befuddled by mental illness. It was followed in 1951 by Cornell University professor Arthur Mizener's The Far Side of Paradise, a biography of F. Scott Fitzgerald that rekindled interest in the couple among scholars. Mizener's biography was serialized in The Atlantic Monthly, and a story about the book appeared in Life magazine, then one of America's most widely read and discussed periodicals. Scott was viewed as <b>a</b> <b>fascinating</b> failure; Zelda's mental health was largely blamed for his lost potential.|$|E
5|$|From the {{distance}} of our times, Diefenbaker's role as a prairie populist who tried to revolutionize the Conservative Party begins to loom larger than his personal idiosyncrasies. The difficulties he faced {{in the form of}} significant historical dilemmas seem less easy to resolve than Liberals and hostile journalists opined at the time. If Diefenbaker defies rehabilitation, he can at least be appreciated. He stood for <b>a</b> <b>fascinating</b> and still relevant combination of individual and egalitarian values... But his contemporaries were also right in seeing some kind of disorder near the centre of his personality and his prime-ministership. The problems of leadership, authority, power, ego, and a mad time in history overwhelmed the prairie politician with the odd name.|$|E

5|$|Julius Seelye Bixler {{reviewed}} the book twice, in 1952 and 1953. In his first review {{he wrote that}} he believed Stace was trying to have his {{cake and eat it}} with regards to the truth of both naturalism and mysticism. Bixler also wonders whether the revelation of God can really be free of concepts and thus whether time and eternity are utterly unrelated as Stace maintains. He identifies points in Stace’s thought where there is continuity between these two states and mystical language does appear to refer to concepts. Finally he rejects the book’s analogy of mystical experience to the evocative power of art, maintaining that art must be somewhat related to logic. Nonetheless, Bixler does concur that the book is <b>a</b> <b>fascinating</b> confessio fidei and personal statement. A year later, he reviewed Time and Eternity alongside Religion and the Modern Mind. As well as reiterating the points he had made earlier, Bixler judges the second book more favourably and recommends reading the two together to better understand the problems they address.|$|E

25|$|Terzaghi {{was much}} in demand as a dinner {{companion}} and was <b>a</b> <b>fascinating</b> conversationalist. His striking {{good looks and}} evident power was very attractive to women. In 1928, he met the young Harvard doctoral student in geology, Ruth Dogget, and fell deeply in love.|$|E
25|$|Santa Maria dello Spasimo {{was built}} in 1506 and later turned into a hospital. This church {{inspired}} Raphael to paint his famous Sicilia's Spasimo, now in the Museo del Prado.

The Jameson Raid has been the subject of numerous articles and books, and remains <b>a</b> <b>fascinating</b> historical riddle more than one hundred years after the events of the Raid took place.|$|E
25|$|Designer and {{commentator}} in {{the fields}} of online learning and new media Stephen Downes characterized The Truth According to Wikipedia as <b>a</b> <b>fascinating</b> documentary both about its website of focus and the larger phenomenon of Web 2.0. Downes was critical of the film's use a documentary-style format in order to present its message, and argued that the viewpoints presented were not subsequently backed up by documentation.|$|E
25|$|The Chapel {{includes}} <b>a</b> <b>fascinating</b> play on light, {{as there}} is no artificial light inside the main section of building during the daytime. There is sufficient sunlight to fully light the worship space, as a combination of smooth textures and reflective surfaces maximize all light shone in the building. At night, the lights from outside combined with candles inside the Chapel are more than enough to illuminate the worship area.|$|E

25|$|At the {{beginning}} of the 20th century, American novelists were expanding fiction to encompass both high and low life and sometimes connected to the naturalist school of realism. In her stories and novels, Edith Wharton (1862–1937) scrutinized the upper-class, Eastern-seaboard society in which she had grown up. One of her finest books, The Age of Innocence, centers on a man who chooses to marry a conventional, socially acceptable woman rather than <b>a</b> <b>fascinating</b> outsider.|$|E
25|$|Historically, {{floating}} charges are <b>a</b> <b>fascinating</b> concept {{in that they}} are legal devices created entirely by lawyers in private practice; there is no legislation and no judicial decision that was the genesis of a floating charge. In 1862 in an apparently unconnected decision of Holroyd v Marshall (1862) 10 HL Cas 191 it was held that equity would recognise a charge over after-acquired property as being effective to create a security interest over that property automatically upon its acquisition.|$|E
25|$|Jonathan Livingston Seagull narrated {{the idea}} of {{evolution}} in <b>a</b> <b>fascinating</b> fashion. James Redfield in his novel The Celestine Prophecy suggested that through experiencing a series of personal spiritual insights, humanity is becoming aware {{of the connection between}} our evolution and the Divine. More recently in his book God and the Evolving Universe: The Next Step in Personal Evolution (2002) co-written with Michael Murphy, he claims that humanity {{is on the verge of}} undergoing a change in consciousness.|$|E
