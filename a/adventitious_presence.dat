40|$|According to E. U. regulations, {{the maximum}} {{allowable}} rate of <b>adventitious</b> transgene <b>presence</b> in non-genetically modified (GM) crops is 0. 9 %. We compared four sampling methods {{for the detection}} of transgenic material in agricultural non-GM maize fields: random sampling, stratified sampling, random sampling + ratio reweighting, random sampling + regression reweighting. Random sampling involves simply sampling maize grains from different locations selected at random from the field concerned. The stratified and reweighting sampling methods make use of an auxiliary variable corresponding to the output of a gene-flow model (a zero-inflated Poisson model) simulating cross-pollination as a function of wind speed, wind direction, and distance to the closest GM maize field. With the stratified sampling method, an auxiliary variable is used to define several strata with contrasting transgene presence rates, and grains are then sampled at random from each stratum. With the two methods involving reweighting, grains are first sampled at random from various locations within the field, and the observations are then reweighted according to the auxiliary variable. Data collected from three maize fields were used to compare the four sampling methods, and the results were used {{to determine the extent to}} which transgene presence rate estimation was improved by the use of stratified and reweighting sampling methods. We found that transgene rate estimates were more accurate and that substantially smaller samples could be used with sampling strategies based on an auxiliary variable derived from a gene-flow model...|$|R

40|$|Accurate {{quantification}} of GM {{to ensure}} compliance with labelling thresholds, e. g. the EU limit of 0. 9 %, requires intensive sampling and stringently validated methods. This is normally targeted at bulk consignments {{at one of}} several critical stages of the food/feed chain post farm gate. However, at the field level, following introduction of GM co-existence regimes, instances may arise that pose possible breaches of co-existence rules, {{with the potential for}} high economic impact for producers if precautionary labelling is sanctioned. In such instances, a rapid on-, or near-site, quantitative method for use as a pre-harvest predictive decision tool for <b>adventitious</b> GM <b>presence</b> (AGMP) would be of use. To this end we have adapted a laboratory-based protocol for real-time quantification of the MON 810 GM event in maize kernels (using Taqman¿ technology) for on-site testing using the portable Cepheid SmartCyclerII instrument. The duplex RT-PCR method requires a basic support infrastructure (bench, electricity, small grain mill or blender, water bath and micro-centrifuge) and can be completed in 2 hours (excluding sampling). The adapted method was pre-validated through an international ring-trial in six EU collaborating laboratories (employing only specified portable equipment). Results showed that the adapted method as performed on the portable instrument complied with minimum assay performance requirements as defined by the European Network of GMO Laboratories (RSDr = 18. 5 %; RSDR = 32. 8; Bias = 26. 7 %). Coupled with an appropriate field sampling approach, this technology has the potential to form the basis of an on- or near-site predictive decision tool for pre-harvest MON 810 AGMP in maize production.

40|$|Abstract: Gene {{flow from}} {{transgenic}} glyphosate-resistant crops {{can result in}} the <b>adventitious</b> <b>presence</b> of the transgene, which may negatively impact markets. Gene flow can also produce glyphosate-resistant plants that may interfere with weed management systems. The objective {{of this article is}} to review the gene flow literature as it pertains to glyphosate-resistant crops. Gene flow is a natural phenomenon not unique to transgenic crops and can occur via pollen, seed and, in some cases, vegetative propagules. Gene flow via pollen can occur in all crops, even those that are considered to be self-pollinated, because all have low levels of outcrossing. Gene flow via seed or vegetative propagules occurs when they are moved naturally or by humans during crop production and commercialization. There are many factors that influence gene flow; therefore, it is difficult to prevent or predict. Gene flow via pollen and seed from glyphosate-resistant canola and creeping bentgrass fields has been documented. The <b>adventitious</b> <b>presence</b> of the transgene responsible for glyphosate resistance has been found in commercial seed lots of canola, corn and soybeans. In general, the glyphosate-resistant trait is not considered to provide an ecological advantage. However, regulators should consider the examples of gene flow from glyphosate-resistant crops when formulating rules for the release of crops with traits that could negatively impact the environment or human health...|$|E

The Technical Working Group (TWG) for Soybean of the European Coexistence Bureau (ECoB) analysed the possible sources for potential GM cross-pollination and admixture and agreed on the best practices for coexistence. The terms of reference for this review are presented in Section 1. The scope of the Best Practice Document is coexistence in soybean crop production in the EU. It includes the coexistence between GM soybean cultivation and honey production but excludes coexistence in seed production. The ECoB TWG for Soybean conducted two meetings, one in May 2013 and one in February 2014 examining the state-of-art knowledge from scientific literature, research projects and reports, as well as empirical evidence provided by already existing segregation systems in soybean production. The information reviewed amounts {{to a total of}} 123 references listed in this report. The report summarises the review of available information on <b>adventitious</b> GM <b>presence</b> in soybean crop production covering seed impurities, cultivation, outcrossing to non-GM soybeans, and volunteers. The process management during sowing, harvesting, transportation, drying and storage on farm is also reviewed. Additionally the report analyses existing studies dealing with the presence of soybean pollen in honey. Finally, the TWG for Soybean reviewed {{the state of the art}} for the detection and identification of traces of GM soybean material in non-GM soybean harvests and honey.

Among other things, they allow us to investigate the effects of using different crop varieties, cropping systems and farming practices on the levels of <b>adventitious</b> <b>presence</b> of GM material in conventional crops. We propose to use machine learning methods to analyze the output of simulation models to learn co-existence rules that directly link the above mentioned causes and effects. The outputs of the GENESYS model, designed to study the co-existence of conventional and GM oilseed rape crops, were analysed by using the machine learning methods of regression tree induction and relational decision tree induction. Co-existence and <b>adventitious</b> <b>presence</b> of GM material were studied in several contexts, including gene flow between pairs of fields, the interactions of this process with farming practices (cropping systems), and gene flow in the context of an entire field plan. Accurate models were learned, which also make use of the relational aspects of a field plan, using information on the neighboring fields of a field, and the farming practices applied in it. The use of relational decision tree induction to analyze the results of simulation models is a novel approach and holds the promise of learning more general co-existence rules by allowing us to vary the target field within a chosen field plan, as well as to consider completely different field plans at the same time. status: publishe...|$|E

Flax (Linum usitatissimum L.) is multipurpose oilseed crop in which product diversity and utility could be enhanced for industrial, nutraceutical and pharmaceutical markets through genetic engineering. If GE flax were released commercially, pollen-mediated gene flow will determine in part whether GE flax could coexist without compromising other markets. As a part of pre-commercialization risk assessment, we quantified pollen-mediated gene flow between two cultivars of flax. Field experiments were conducted at four locations during 2006 and 2007 in western Canada using a concentric donor (20 × 20 [*]m) receptor (120 × 120 [*]m) design. Gene flow was detected through the xenia effect of dominant alleles of high α-linolenic acid (ALA; 18 : 3 cisΔ 9, 12, 15) to the low ALA trait. Seeds were harvested from the pollen recipient plots up to a distance of 50 [*]m in eight directions from the pollen donor. High ALA seeds were identified using a thiobarbituric acid test {{and served as a}} marker for gene flow. Binomial distribution and power analysis were used to predict the minimum number of seeds statistically required to detect the frequency of gene flow at specific α (confidence interval) and power (1 −β) values. As a result of the low frequency of gene flow, approximately 4 million seeds were screened to derive accurate quantification. Frequency of gene flow was highest near the source: averaging 0. 0185 at 0. 1 [*]m but declined rapidly with distance, 0. 0013 and 0. 00003 at 3 and 35 [*]m, respectively. Gene flow was reduced to 50 % (O 50) and 90 % (O 90) between 0. 85 to 2. 64 [*]m, and 5. 68 to 17. 56 [*]m, respectively. No gene flow was detected at any site or year > 35 [*]m distance from the pollen source, suggesting that frequency of gene flow was ⩽ 0. 00003 (P= 0. 95).

Production of hybrid corn (Zea mays L) depends on cross-pollination {{between male and female}} inbred parents. As such, reproductive isolation of seed fields is required to ensure genetic purity of the hybrid progeny. Customer demand for improved genetic purity prompted the seed industry to examine the level of genetic purity resulting from current isolation practices. This project was a two-pronged approach: (1) A three-year study was conducted to monitor purity of hybrid seed produced in 291 fields from 24 seed companies in North America; and (2) Evaluate a particulate model to determine whether it could be used to run multiple different seed production scenarios involving meteorological, positional and biological data to evaluate these dynamic elements on the production of genetically pure seed maize. Industry practices that most consistently contributed to high levels of genetic purity were (i) use of 2 ̆ 7 Good 2 ̆ 7 or 2 ̆ 7 Fair 2 ̆ 7 pollen parents, (ii) isolation greater than 165 ft from all potential adventitious pollen sources, (iii) and large (3 ̆e 100 ac) seed field size.

This method includes the design of candidate models, their calibration, selection andevaluation on an independent dataset. A group of models was identified that is sufficiently robust to beused for prediction purpose. The group of models allows to include local information and it reflectsreliably enough the observed variability in the data so that probabilistic model predictions can be performed and used to quantify risk under different scenarios or derive optimal sampling schemes...|$|E
40|$|This article {{looks at}} two 2014 cases {{concerning}} {{the threat to}} organic farming from genetically modified (GM) agriculture. The first, March v. Baxter in the Supreme Court and Court of Appeal of Western Australia, concerned a dispute between two neighboring farmers in which one claimed {{that the loss of}} his organic certification was attributed to the harvesting practices of his GM-producing neighbor. The second, Organic Seed Growers and Trade Association et al. v. Monsanto, concerned an unsuccessful application by a number of farmers’ organizations in the United States seeking a declaration that, should their crops become contaminated by the <b>adventitious</b> <b>presence</b> of patented genetic material, they should not be sued for patent infringement. The Australian case, which was a world’s first between neighboring farmers, made some useful comments on organic certification practices. The US decisions in the Southern District of New York and the Court of Appeals laid to rest some of the concerns that had been raised in the Canadian Schmeiser case about the liability of farmers for innocent patent infringement...|$|E
