5|$|Chadwick's love {{of music}} led him to serve for twenty years as {{chairman}} of the council of Hymns Ancient & Modern Ltd. During this time the company expanded its scope. From producing the hymnbooks Hymns <b>Ancient</b> <b>and</b> <b>Modern</b> (A), and The English Hymnal, it also took ownership of Canterbury Press, SCM Press, and the Church Times, leading to jokes that Chadwick was an ecclesiastical Rupert Murdoch. He was heavily involved in the editorial process leading to the supplements to A, 100 Hymns for Today, More Hymns for Today, Worship Songs <b>Ancient</b> <b>and</b> <b>Modern,</b> and Hymns <b>Ancient</b> <b>and</b> <b>Modern</b> New Standard, which combined the best of the original book with that from the supplements into a single volume, and also the most recent revision, Common Praise. He had particularly argued for the inclusion of the Spiritual, Steal Away, and this was amongst the music used at his funeral.|$|E

5|$|An eclipse is {{a natural}} phenomenon. However, in some <b>ancient</b> <b>and</b> <b>modern</b> cultures, solar eclipses were {{attributed}} to supernatural causes or regarded as bad omens.

5|$|Hogarth {{claimed to}} have long been {{interested}} {{in the story of}} Sigismunda, which had appeared in England in several versions by the mid-18th century.

5|$|Being a key {{animal in}} the history of farming, sheep have a deeply entrenched place in human culture, and find {{representation}} in much modern language and symbology. As livestock, sheep are most often associated with pastoral, Arcadian imagery. Sheep figure in many mythologies—such as the Golden Fleece—and major religions, especially the Abrahamic traditions. In both <b>ancient</b> <b>and</b> <b>modern</b> religious ritual, sheep are used as sacrificial animals.|$|E
5|$|Both <b>ancient</b> <b>and</b> <b>modern</b> {{writers have}} used the Battle of Thermopylae {{as an example of}} the power of a {{patriotic}} army defending its native soil.

50|$|His long epic Clovis (1657) is {{noteworthy}} because Desmarets rejected the traditional pagan background, and maintained that Christian imagery should supplant it.

5|$|Divine command theory (also {{known as}} {{theological}} voluntarism) is a meta-ethical theory which proposes that an action's status as morally good {{is equivalent to}} whether it is commanded by God. The theory asserts that what is moral is determined by what God commands, and that {{for a person to}} be moral is to follow his commands. Followers of both monotheistic and polytheistic religions in <b>ancient</b> <b>and</b> <b>modern</b> times have often accepted the importance of God's commands in establishing morality.|$|E

5|$|The area {{through which}} the Wheeldale {{structure}} runs is predominantly uncultivated heather moorland. Hayes believes its appearance has remained fundamentally unchanged since the Bronze Age when its forest cover was removed to permit cultivation and grazing. Wheeldale Moor is poorly drained in places making it susceptible to flooding in both the <b>ancient</b> <b>and</b> <b>modern</b> eras. The underlying geology consists of patches of sand and gravel on top of mixed sandstone and oolitic limestone, known as Ravenscar Group strata.|$|E
5|$|The ears {{have been}} ornamented with jewelry for {{thousands}} of years, traditionally by piercing of the earlobe. In <b>ancient</b> <b>and</b> <b>modern</b> cultures, ornaments have been placed to stretch and enlarge the earlobes, allowing for larger plugs to be slid into a large fleshy gap in the lobe. Tearing of the earlobe from the weight of heavy earrings, or from traumatic pull of an earring (for example, by snagging on a sweater), is fairly common.|$|E
5|$|<b>Ancient</b> <b>and</b> <b>modern</b> historians {{provided}} different estimations for {{the number}} of ships and troops under the command of Basiliscus, {{as well as for the}} expenses of the expedition. Both were enormous; Nicephorus Gregoras speaks of one hundred thousand ships, the more reliable Cedrenus says that the fleet that attacked Carthage consisted of eleven hundred and thirteen ships, having each one hundred men on board. The most conservative estimation for expedition expenses is of 64,000pounds of gold, a sum that exceeded a whole year's revenue.|$|E

5|$|Celebrating the Christmas season {{had been}} growing in {{popularity}} through the Victorian era. Although the Christmas tree had been introduced in Britain during the 18th century, its use was popularised by Queen Victoria and Prince Albert, and their practice was copied in many homes across the country. In the early 19th century {{there had been a}} revival of interest in Christmas carols, following a decline in popularity over the previous hundred years. The publication of Davies Gilbert's 1823 work Some Ancient Christmas Carols, With the Tunes to Which They Were Formerly Sung in the West of England and William Sandys's 1833 collection Christmas Carols, <b>Ancient</b> <b>and</b> <b>Modern</b> led to a growth in the form's popularity in Britain.|$|E
5|$|In 1985, Canadian {{historian}} William H. McNeill gave {{a series}} of three lectures on polyethnicity in <b>ancient</b> <b>and</b> <b>modern</b> cultures at the University of Toronto. The main thesis throughout the lectures was the argument that it has been the cultural norm for societies to be composed of different ethnic groups. McNeill argues that the ideal of homogeneous societies may have grown between 1750 and 1920 in Western Europe due to a growth in the belief in a single nationalistic base for the political organization of society. McNeill believes that World War I was the point in time when the desire for homogeneous nations began to weaken.|$|E
5|$|Research has disproved {{some common}} misconceptions about the brain. These include both <b>ancient</b> <b>and</b> <b>modern</b> myths. It {{is not true}} that neurons are not {{replaced}} {{after the age of}} two; nor that only ten per cent of the brain is used. Popular culture has also oversimplified the lateralisation of the brain, suggesting that functions are completely specific {{to one side of the}} brain or the other. Akio Mori coined the term game brain for the unreliably supported theory that spending long periods playing video games harmed the brain's pre-frontal region and the expression of emotion and creativity.|$|E
