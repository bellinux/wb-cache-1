40|$|Copyright © 2009 SAE International The {{interior}} noise signature of passenger vehicles {{is a significant}} contributor to a customer’s perception of quality. The vehicle <b>acoustic</b> <b>package</b> {{can be an important}} piece to the acoustic signature, and can be utilized not just to reduce the sound levels inside the vehicle but also to shape the sound such that it meets the expectations of the customer. For this reason the definition, design, and development of an <b>acoustic</b> <b>package</b> can be vital to meeting vehicle-level acoustic targets. In many situations this development is conducted experimentally, requiring the availability of prototype vehicles and <b>acoustic</b> <b>package</b> components. Of more value is the ability to develop components early in the design phase, leveraging analytical tools to define component-level requirements and targets to meet the vehicle-level targets, and ultimately meet the final customer expectations. This paper presents efforts made to further combine the benefits of experimental and analytical approaches to <b>acoustic</b> <b>package</b> design. The benefits of which include the ability to predict interior sound levels for alternative <b>acoustic</b> <b>package</b> configurations early in the design phase, allowing for listening studies to verify component and vehicle-level targets. Additionally, the performance of alternative designs can be quantified in the frequency domain and using sound quality metrics, while minimizing the necessity for physical testing. A current market vehicle was utilized for this development, in which experimental measurements were developed and conducted for optimum cooperation and utilization of analytical tools. The <b>acoustic</b> <b>package</b> was characterized to predict the sound levels for alternate <b>acoustic</b> <b>package</b> designs, listening studies were performed and metrics were calculated for each configuration to verify performance against the vehicle-levels targets, and developed solutions were verified through experimental testing...|$|E

40|$|Abstract — As it {{is often}} assumed that an {{interaction}} with a robot is similar to an interaction with an infant, one would expect similar characteristics in tutoring behavior in human-robot interaction from which the robot’s learning processes can benefit. Especially learning actions can profit {{from the use of}} language. As it has been shown by Hirsh-Pasek and Golinkoff introducing the idea of <b>Acoustic</b> <b>Packaging,</b> language not only serves as a social cue but also provides functional structure. In order to better understand how robot-directed interaction is structured and how the modifications may help to extract cues relevant for learning actions from a tutoring situation, in the present paper we analyzed the structure of <b>Acoustic</b> <b>Packages</b> in the adult-robot situation. Our results indicate that in human-robot interaction, the phenomenon of <b>Acoustic</b> <b>Packaging</b> is similar in adult-child interaction: In both situations, more <b>Acoustic</b> <b>Packages</b> with less content can be found, compared to adult-adult interaction.

40|$|Abstract—In {{order to}} learn and {{interact}} with humans, robots need understand actions and make use of language in social interactions. The use of language for the learning of actions has been emphasized by Hirsh-Pasek & Golinkoff introducing the idea of <b>Acoustic</b> <b>Packaging</b> [1]. Accordingly, {{it has been suggested}} that acoustic information, typically in the form of narration, overlaps with action sequences and provides infants with a bottom-up guide to attend to relevant events and to find structure within them. Following the promising results achieved by Brand & Tapscott for infants who packaged sequences together when acoustic narration was provided, in this paper, we make the first approach towards a computational model of the multimodal interplay of action and language in tutoring situations. For our purpose, we understand events as temporal intervals, which have to be segmented in both the visual and the acoustic signal in order to perform <b>Acoustic</b> <b>Packaging.</b> For the visual modality, we looked at the amount of motion over time via a motion history image based approach. The visual signal is segmented by detecting local minima in the amount of motion. For the acoustic modality, we used a phoneme recognizer, which currently segments the acoustic signal into speech and non-speech intervals. Our <b>Acoustic</b> <b>Packaging</b> algorithm merges the segments from both modalities based on temporal synchrony. First evaluation results show that <b>Acoustic</b> <b>Packaging</b> can provide a meaningful segmentation of tutoring behavior. I...|$|R

40|$|The {{course for}} lighter and more silent cars {{has put a}} strong {{pressure}} on the vibro-acoustic design of vehicles. The different panels surrounding the car interior cavity such as the firewall, the door or floor panels is of key importance to the total noise performance of a vehicle. However, a good panel design in mid-frequencies is difficult, due to the multiple phenomena involved {{and the lack of}} performance metrics. This paper introduces a new target setting for trimmed panel in mid-frequencies, based on the breakdown of those phenomena. Usually, panel targets focus on high-frequency performance, where airborne noise is predominant and input and receiving pattern fields to the panel are assumed homogeneous. Those conditions allow a simplification of the measurements and simulations. Extending panel target setting to mid-frequencies brings up two challenges: first, structureborne and airborne sources need to be both taken into account. A target performance breakdown is required in order to assess the different mechanisms that constitute the final panel performance such as input impedance or damping. Secondly, in mid-frequencies, the assumption of simplified input and receiving fields is not valid anymore. More complex field patterns, representative of the vehicle environment are needed. Numerical studies of a rectangular panel backed by an <b>acoustic</b> <b>package</b> are reported. Different input and receiving field patterns are applied, for both airborne and structureborne excitations. Power, velocity and force quantities and their paths are estimated between input and receiving side. From this breakdown, new metrics are presented to evaluate package performance for the different involved phenomena. Finally, robustness towards field variation is discussed. Those new metrics allow performance target setting for vehicle panels in the mid-frequency range. nrpages: 20 status: publishe...|$|E

Three seismic stratigraphie units are identified. Unit 1 is Pliocene-Quaternary in age and {{is characterized by a}} strongly reflective <b>acoustic</b> <b>package</b> which shows considerable lateral continuity. [...] Unit 2 consists of an acoustically transparent package with few coherent reflectors: it represents the Messinian evaporite succession. Unit 3 is early-late Miocene but pre-Messinian in age and is defined by an acoustically reverberatory package which shows moderate lateral continuity. [...] Detailed interpretation and mapping of the seismic reflection profiles showed that the structural architecture of the Antalya Basin is characterized by 4 - 5 northwest-southeast trending anticline-syncline pairs. The anticlines are invariably cored by north-dipping, south-verging thrusts, thus representing ramp anticlines with the synclines between thrust culminations representing piggy-back basins. Temporal and spatial relationship of these large-scale structures and the stratigraphy and growth strata architecture of Units 1 - 3 successions clearly document a two-phase history for the Miocene to Recent kinematic evolution of the Antalya Basin. The first phase of deformation occurred in the Miocene and affected the entire Antalya Basin. It involves the northwest-trending, southwest-directed fold-thrust structures in Unit 3. A fundamental change in the kinematic regime occurred during the transition from the late Miocene to early Pliocene, when the strain was strongly partitioned both temporally and geographically. The second phase of deformation occurred in the early-Pliocene to Recent. Structures associated with this phase of deformation consist of (1) northwest-trending listric extensional faults involving the Pliocene-Quaternary succession as well as the similarly trending transtensional faults involving the Miocene to Pliocene-Quaternary successions, which occupy the northern portion of the study area extending from the present-day shoreline to the innermost portion of the deep Antalya Basin, (2) re-activated Miocene thrusts involving the Pliocene-Quaternary successions, which occupy the northern and central segments of the Antalya Basin, and (3) northwest-trending transpressional structures involving the Miocene to Pliocene-Quaternary successions, which occupy the southern segment of the deep Antalya Basin.

Therefore, we apply a method for multimodal action segmentation called <b>Acoustic</b> <b>Packaging</b> to a corpus of pairs of users teaching object names to a robot. Going beyond previous use cases, we analyze how the structure of human actions changes if the robot is learning quickly or slowly. Our results reveal differences between action structuring in the conditions such as longer utterances and more motion when the robot learns slowly. We also evaluate how the partners in the pair influence each other's action structuring. The results show a strong correlation between the participants in the pairs, even more so in the trials where the robot is learning slowly. We conclude that the action structuring based on <b>Acoustic</b> <b>Packaging</b> allows robots to differentiate how well the interaction with multiple users is going and is, thus, a vehicle for feedback generation...|$|R

Of particular interest are the three acoustic signals associated with a pipeline fracture. The system is portable (less than 30 lbm) and can be used at all line pressures up to 1000 psig. The PAMP requires a shut-off valve equipped 1 / 2 inch NPT access port in the pipeline. It is fully functional over the typical pressure range found in the natural gas transmission pipelines in the West Virginia, Virginia, Pennsylvania, and Ohio areas.

40|$|A {{new method}} was {{developed}} to provide better metrics for quantifying Mid-Frequency Active Sonar (MFAS) occurrence and levels, and was applied to passive acoustic monitoring data collected in the Southern California (SOCAL) Range Complex. MFAS signals are composed of both tones and frequency swept ‘pings’, often with multiple pings grouped closely in time as packets. These packets often occur repeatedly at intervals> 20 s over periods of hours as wave train events with gaps between events> 1 h. The new approach uses a higher received level packet detection threshold (130 dBpp re 1 µPa) than previous analyses, which limits the detection range to about 20 km, {{reducing the number of}} overall detections but also reducing the false detection rate.

40|$|An {{ensemble}} {{consisting of}} 150 Ziphius cavirostris vocalizations was compiled from acoustic data recorded at two High-frequency <b>Acoustic</b> Recording <b>Package</b> (HARP) locations: the Naval Postgraduate School (NPS) 's Point Sur HARP and Scripps Institution of Oceanography (SIO) 's site H HARP. The ensemble was analyzed via a {{principal component analysis}} (PCA). The results of the PCA verified the statistical robustness of the signal and yielded one dominant mode which accounted for 73 % of the variance. The dominant mode was {{used to create a}} kernel for a matched filter detection scheme. The subsequent detector output was statistically evaluated against a ground truth. The ground truth identified 28, 434 Ziphius clicks by visually inspecting over 170 minutes of data recorded by NPS's Data Acquisition System (DAS) at the Southern California Offshore Range (SCORE). The inability to visually discriminate a signal embedded in noise created a conservatively biased ground truth estimate which increased the detector's false alarm rate. At an acceptable 0. 1 % false alarm rate, the detector had an overall 44 % probability of detection. A further assessment of the detector's performance divided the data into two categories: cluttered and uncluttered. At a false alarm rate of 0. 1 %, the probability of detection was 26 % and 61 %, respectively. US Navy (USN) author...|$|R
40|$|This report {{summarizes}} work {{conducted in}} FY 2009 -FY 2010 to characterize marine mammal sounds related to passive acoustic monitoring in the Hawaii Range Complex. Existing acoustic {{data from the}} Complex were analyzed to provide better descriptions of acoustic signals by species. Recordings were from a boat-based hydrophone or an autonomous bottom-moored High-frequency <b>Acoustic</b> Recording <b>Package</b> (HARP). Recordings were made of pygmy killer whales, melon-headed whales, Risso's dolphins, and rough-toothed dolphins. Echolocation click parameters were calculated for single species recordings during visual and acoustic surveys by boat-based hydrophones, and by using sightings from small boat surveys and locations of satellite tagged individuals near the HARP. Automatic classification of echolocation clicks of false killer whales and short-finned pilot whales was performed using a Gaussian mixture model. An analyst manually screened the HARP data collected off {{the west coast of}} Hawaii during the period ii/ 10 / 2009 -iii/ 9 / 2009. Distinct call types were found for: beaked whales with frequency modulated upsweep echolocation pulses; sperm whales; high frequency clicks of unknown origin; low frequency banded echolocation clicks; and a large number of unidentified echolocation clicks. Odontocetes were acoustically active every day. Beaked whales were detected on 41 % of recording days, but only briefly each day. N 00244 - 08 - 1 - 0028...|$|R
40|$|The {{shallow and}} uniform water {{depth of the}} eastern Bering Sea shelf results in an {{acoustic}} waveguide. Propagation within this waveguide produces waveform dispersion which is dependent upon range. We present a means for using dispersed waveforms to determine range to calling whales from a single autonomous acoustic recording instrument. The predominant North Pacific right whale (Eubalaena japonica) call is frequency upswept from about 90 Hz to around 160 Hz and lasts approximately 1 s. The regional bathymetry of the eastern Bering Sea middle shelf is relatively uniform and shallow (~ 70 meters deep). This geometry provides a plane-layered waveguide in which right whale upswept calls can be detected at ranges over 50 km and have multiple modal arrivals that become dispersed, displaying different propagation velocities for different frequencies. Dispersion characteristics of modal arrivals are dependent on the calling whale’s depth, the receiver’s depth, the water depth, the range from caller to receiver, and various environmental parameters including water and sediment density and sound velocity. A model of sound propagation for the eastern Bering Sea middle shelf is developed from right whale call dispersion recorded on sonobuoys and seafloor <b>acoustic</b> recording <b>packages,</b> using individual calls recorded at multiple instruments. After development of the model, waveform dispersion allows estimation of calle...|$|R
40|$|Abstract – The Wave Glider, a wave-powered {{unmanned}} maritime vehicle (UMV), {{represents a}} novel and unique approach to persistent ocean presence. Wave Gliders harvest the abundant energy contained in ocean waves to provide essentially limitless propulsion. The Wave Glider {{can operate as}} a vessel, covering long distances in the ocean, or as a station-keeping platform. Wave Gliders have demonstrated long open-ocean transits and extended deployments of up to one year. The High-frequency <b>Acoustic</b> Recording <b>Package</b> (HARP) is an autonomous data logging system optimized for long-term, broad-band marine mammal monitoring. The HARP system includes low-power electronics, high-speed data sampling, large capacity data storage, and batteries for self-contained power. In addition to housing the data logger, a hydrophone {{was designed to be}} towed behind the Wave Glider. Together, Scripps Institution of Oceanography and Liquid Robotics combined these two technologies to demonstrate a new approach to marine mammal monitoring. Providing a mobile, long-endurance and fully connected platform for acoustic monitoring, the Wave Glider with HARP enables new scientific results and improved economics. Over a series of engineering and scientific evaluations, the HARP system has proven effective for monitoring marine mammals when deployed on the Wave Glider. In this paper, we give an overview of the Wave Glider platform and integrated HARP system, and present results from the extensive engineering sea trials conducted with several prototype and production versions of the vehicle and data logger...|$|R
40|$|Controlling cabin {{acoustic}} noise {{levels in the}} Crew Module (CM) of the Orion spacecraft is critical for adequate speech intelligibility, to avoid fatigue and to prevent any possibility of temporary and permanent hearing loss. A vibroacoustic model of the Orion CM cabin has been developed using Statistical Energy Analysis (SEA) to assess compliance with acoustic Constellation Human Systems Integration Requirements (HSIR) for the on-orbit mission phase. Cabin noise in the Orion CM needs to be analyzed at the vehicle-level to assess the cumulative acoustic effect of various Orion systems at the crewmember's ear. The SEA model includes all major structural and acoustic subsystems inside the CM including the Environmental Control and Life Support System (ECLSS), which is the primary noise contributor in the cabin during the on-orbit phase. The ECLSS noise sources used to excite the vehicle acoustic model were derived {{using a combination of}} established empirical predictions and fan development acoustic testing. Baseline noise predictions were compared against acoustic HSIR requirements. Key noise offenders and paths were identified and ranked using noise transfer path analysis. Parametric studies were conducted with various <b>acoustic</b> treatment <b>packages</b> in the cabin to reduce the noise levels and define vehicle-level mass impacts. An acoustic test mockup of the CM cabin has also been developed and noise treatment optimization tests were conducted to validate the results of the analyses...|$|R
