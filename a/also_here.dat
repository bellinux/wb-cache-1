Parsons was already representing Adolph Gottlieb, Hedda Sterne and Theodoros Stamos. It was while Pollock showed at Parsons' gallery that he started making his iconic drip-paintings in 1947. It was <b>also</b> <b>here</b> that Barnett Newman exhibited his first breakthrough works in 1950. Rothko, who had arrived at his distinctive mural sized paintings in 1947, first exhibited them at the Parsons Gallery.|$|E
5|$|If {{the player}} saved Curly Brace earlier, the player may find an item to restore her memories. She remembers that the player character's name is Quote, {{and that they}} were not the killer robots who {{slaughtered}} Mimigas in the past. Instead, they were sent to destroy the Demon Crown to prevent its power from falling into the wrong hands. Quote finds Sue's mother, Momorin, who is building a rocket that will allow access {{to the top of the}} island where the Doctor resides. After helping her complete the rocket, Quote confronts Misery and the Doctor. The Doctor has purified the essence of the red flowers into a crystal, which allows him to survive even after Quote destroys his body. The Doctor's spirit possesses the Core of the island, but Quote succeeds in destroying that as well, causing the island to begin falling to Earth. Should the player have saved Curly and restored her memories, they may proceed into a bonus stage called the Bloodstained Sanctuary where Curly can be found and rescued; it is <b>also</b> <b>here</b> that Ballos - creator of the Demon Crown and Jenka's younger brother - is imprisoned. A powerful wizard who went insane and destroyed his homeland after being tortured by a jealous king, Ballos was sealed deep within the island by his sister. At some point, his niece Misery forced him to create the demon crown, but she and Balrog became cursed to serve whoever possessed it. Additionally, it is stated via narration that the Demon Crown will repair itself if it is destroyed, and will only truly lose its power if Ballos is killed, necessitating that Quote and Curly take his life.|$|E

25|$|Also {{the above}} quoted article proposes a relaxed global {{serializability}} solution, while referencing the CO work. The CO solution for global serializability both bridges between different concurrency control protocols with no substantial concurrency reduction (and typically minor, if at all), and maintains {{the autonomy of}} local DBMSs. Evidently <b>also</b> <b>here</b> CO has been misunderstood. This misunderstanding continues to 2010 in a textbook {{by some of the}} same authors, where the same relaxed global serializability technique, Two level serializability, is emphasized and described in detail, and CO is not mentioned at all.|$|E

25|$|By {{the time}} Cutler was {{drumming}} for Henry Cow in 1971, {{he had become}} a perfectly competent, albeit unconventional, drummer. The nature of Henry Cow was to experiment and explore and it was here that Cutler developed and refined his drumming techniques. It was <b>also</b> <b>here</b> that he started to electrify his drum kit. He began by attaching old telephone mouthpieces to drums and cymbals, and connecting them to an amplifier and a reverb unit. He later added a small mixer for four independent inputs. The effect was very basic: a few low-grade inputs with only equalisation and reverberation to manipulate.|$|E
