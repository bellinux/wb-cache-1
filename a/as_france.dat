5|$|After 1700 British {{continental}} {{policy was}} to contain expansion by competing powers such <b>as</b> <b>France</b> and Spain. Although Spain was the dominant global power {{during the previous}} two centuries and the chief threat to England's early transatlantic ambitions, its influence was now waning. The territorial ambitions of the French, however, led to the War of the Spanish Succession and the Napoleonic Wars.|$|E

5|$|Diarra {{earned his}} first call {{up to the}} under-21 team in August 2002 for a {{friendly}} match against Cyprus. He made his debut in the match <b>as</b> <b>France</b> cruised to a 1–0 victory. Diarra featured regularly within the team <b>as</b> <b>France</b> attempted to qualify for both the 2004 UEFA European Under-21 Football Championship and the football tournament at the 2004 Summer Olympics. France failed to qualify for both competitions, {{which resulted in the}} end of Diarra's youth career. He appeared in 10 competitive matches with the team and scored his only goal in a 3–1 UEFA U21 tournament qualification win over Israel. In December 2003, Diarra was called up to the Mali national team to participate in the 2004 Africa Cup of Nations. Diarra turned down the opportunity to represent the nation of his parents in order to continue his career with his home country France.|$|E
5|$|Evra is {{a former}} French youth {{international}} having played for the under-21 team. Due to harboring in Italy during his development years, he failed to earn call-ups with teams below the under-21 level. Evra earned his first call-up to the under-21 team under coach Raymond Domenech on 3 October 2002 for matches against Slovenia and Malta. He made his under-21 debut in the match against Slovenia <b>as</b> <b>France</b> cruised to a 1–0 victory. Evra was forced to miss the match against Malta after suffering an injury in the win over Slovenia. The defender regularly appeared for the team through 2002–2004 <b>as</b> <b>France</b> attempted to qualify for both the 2004 UEFA European Under-21 Football Championship and the football tournament at the 2004 Summer Olympics. France failed to qualify for both competitions, {{which resulted in the}} end of Evra's youth career.|$|E

5|$|Relations with France were {{important}} after World War I {{and in the}} 1920s, <b>as</b> <b>France</b> {{played a leading role}} in the new European security arrangements.

However, during the Winter War France was one of the most important suppliers of military materiel.|$|E
5|$|Blood {{transfusion}} {{was formerly}} the second-most common {{mode of transmission}} for Chagas disease, but {{the development and implementation}} of blood bank screening tests has dramatically reduced this risk in the 21st century. Blood donations in all endemic Latin American countries undergo Chagas screening, and testing is expanding in countries, such <b>as</b> <b>France,</b> Spain and the United States, that have significant or growing populations of immigrants from endemic areas. In Spain, donors are evaluated with a questionnaire to identify individuals at risk of Chagas exposure for screening tests.|$|E
5|$|Diaby played under manager Jean Gallice. Gallice, initially, {{called up}} Diaby at under-18 level for a match against Greece in November 2003. Diaby, however, {{was forced to}} {{withdraw}} from the squad after suffering an injury while playing domestically. He made his youth international debut at under-19 level in a 2–1 friendly match win over Turkey. In qualifying for the 2005 European Under-19 Football Championship, Diaby appeared in all six matches <b>as</b> <b>France</b> finished both the first qualifying round and the Elite Round undefeated. In the tournament, he missed the team's opening 1–1 group stage draw with England due to suspension, but returned to the starting lineup in the team's 3–1 victory over Norway in the second group stage match. Diaby, subsequently, started every remaining match, including the championship match against England. France won the match 3–1 giving the nation its sixth under-19 title and Diaby his first international honor. In total with the under-19 team, he featured in 12 matches and scored no goals. At under-21 level, Diaby made his debut on 28 February 2006 in a friendly match against Slovakia. He appeared as a substitute <b>as</b> <b>France</b> won the match 2–1. Due to suffering a fractured ankle domestically, Diaby missed the 2006 UEFA European Under-21 Football Championship. Due to repetitive injuries, he missed every qualifier for the 2007 UEFA European Under-21 Football Championship and made only one more appearance for the team, which occurred in a 1–1 draw in a friendly match with Armenia.|$|E

5|$|Eichmann did {{not make}} policy, but acted in an {{operational}} capacity. Specific deportation orders came from Reichsführer-SS Heinrich Himmler. Eichmann's office was responsible for collecting information on the Jews in each area, organising the seizure of their property, and arranging for and scheduling trains. His department was in constant contact with the Foreign Office, as Jews of conquered nations such <b>as</b> <b>France</b> could not as easily be stripped of their possessions and deported to their deaths. Eichmann held regular meetings in his Berlin offices with his department members {{working in the field}} and travelled extensively to visit concentration camps and ghettos. His wife, who disliked Berlin, resided in Prague with the children. Eichmann initially visited them weekly, but as time went on, his visits tapered off to once a month.|$|E

5|$|The Way I See It was {{released}} by Columbia Records on September 16, 2008, and was initially overlooked by consumers. It sold steadily and spent 41 weeks on the Billboard 200 albums chart, reaching sales of 282,000 copies in the United States by May 2011. It also performed well in European countries such <b>as</b> <b>France,</b> where it charted for 51 weeks. The Way I See It received generally positive reviews from critics and {{was seen as an}} exemplary release of the classic soul revival at the time. It also garnered Saadiq a newer, more diverse audience as he toured extensively in support of the album, performing concerts in the US, Europe, and Asia.|$|E
5|$|The affair {{substantially}} weakened popular American {{support of}} France. The pro-French Jeffersonians lost support and {{quickly became the}} minority as many began to demand full-scale war. The affair heightened fears of sedition by the administration's opponents and legislation was introduced in response. The president knew that America {{would be unable to}} win a conflict, <b>as</b> <b>France</b> at the time was dominating the fight in most of Europe. Adams therefore pursued a strategy whereby American ships harassed French ships in an effort sufficient to stem the French assaults on American interests. This was the undeclared naval war between the U.S. and France – the Quasi-War which broke out in 1798.|$|E
5|$|The foursome of Ben Arfa, Nasri, Benzema, and Menez {{returned}} to international play together for under-19 duty.

In the first round of qualification for the tournament, Ben Arfa scored his lone goal in the opening match against Wales <b>as</b> <b>France</b> advanced through the round undefeated. Due to injury, Ben Arfa was absent from the final round of qualification for the tournament and, despite going undefeated in the round, France were eliminated after being beaten on points by Scotland. Ben Arfa only made one competitive appearance with the under-21 team, appearing in a 2009 UEFA Under-21 Championship qualification match against Romania.|$|E
