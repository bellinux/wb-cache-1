From animate creatures, such as swarming insects, flocking birds and schooling fish, to inanimate natural {{processes such as}} sedimentation and cloud formation, these phenomena <b>arouse</b> <b>the</b> <b>curiosity</b> of physicists and engineers alike. Early studies using analytical models and experiments in the low Reynolds number helped shed {{the light on the}} intricacies of particle interactions, as in clouds or arrays of spheres. In the intermediate Reynolds number regime however, the unsteadiness introduced by the fluid inertia, coupled to the object dynamics, add to the complexity of the problem. Numerical methods become then the tool par excellence to solve for these dynamics. The goal of this thesis is to lay out the foundations for a better understanding of particle interactions in fluids. Namely, we investigate the two-dimensional dynamics of interacting particles in a viscous fluid, in the intermediate Reynolds number range. We develop a direct numerical scheme based on the Immersed Interface Method to simulate the coupling of the dynamics of freely moving objects with the surrounding fluid. The method is used to study the dynamics of arrays of cylinders settling under gravity, and how these dynamics depend on the number of particles and their initial separation. We then provide a simple force law model which accounts for the initial repulsive force experienced by any two adjacent cylinders, at close range. When the particle density is high, collisions are almost inevitable. To treat close range interactions and resolve the interstitial flow in the narrowing gap between particles or between a particle and a wall, we further extend the immersed interface method {{to take into account the}} lubrication effects. We solve Reynolds equations and use the analytical solution in the lubrication region. Doing so enables us to avoid ad hoc methods where an artificial repulsive force is added or two-dimensional collision equations are used with a modified coefficient of restitution. 2018 - 01 - 2...|$|E
40|$|O fenômeno da gemelaridade é permeado por peculiaridades que despertam a curiosidade e diversos questionamentos. Tais questões são, normalmente, respondidas por meio de estereótipos amplamente divulgados tanto na sociedade como dentro das próprias famílias. Constata-se, entretanto que estudos científicos sobre a temática podem contribuir para romper com pressupostos que afetam negativamente o desenvolvimento de crianças gêmeas e suas famílias, dando lugar à construção de um conhecimento que retrate a realidade vivenciada por esses indivíduos e amplie as possibilidades de desenvolvimento saudável e bem estar {{individual}} e familiar. Assim, adotando a Teoria Familiar Sistêmica, buscou-se como objetivos do estudo a caracterização de familias com crianças gêmeas e a análise da percepção das próprias crianças sobre sua vivência familiar e relacional. Participaram da pesquisa 11 famílias com configurações diversas, mas que tinham com filhos mais novos um par de gêmeo, monozigóticos ou dizigóticos de ambos os gêneros, com idades entre seis e 12 anos. Por meio de um questionário preenchido pelas mães, um inventário respondido, separadamente, pelos irmãos gêmeos e um desenho da família também executado por cada um dos gêmeos, alcançou-se características estruturais e dinâmicas das 11 famílias participantes, além de escolher cinco famílias para realizar estudos de caso. Foram investigadas as configurações familiares e o modo de vida, as redes de relações estabelecidas entre os subsistemas de cada família e a percepção das crianças sobre o seu funcionamento familiar, enfatizando as relações fraternas gemelares. Como principais achados, são apontados: indícios de que a dinâmica familiar dos participantes desta pesquisa ainda permanece seguindo modelos tradicionais que reforçam a pouca participação dos homens nas rotinas domésticas e sobrecarregam as mulheres (avós, mães e filhas mais velhas) [...] . The {{phenomenon of}} twinning is permeated by peculiarities that <b>arouse</b> <b>the</b> <b>curiosity</b> {{as well as}} it arouses many questions. Such questions are usually answered through stereotypes which are largely spread not only in the society but also inside the families. However, it is noted that scientific studies about the topic many contribute to break up the assumption that negatively affect the development of twin children and their families, leading to the construction of knowledgement that portrays the reality experienced by those individuals, and enlarges the possibilities of a healthy development and welfare. Therefore, embracing the Family Systems Theory, we aimed at the characterization of families with twin children and the analysis of the perception of the own children concerning their family life and relation. 11 families with various configurations participated in the survey, however, they had twins as their youngest children, monozygotica or dizygotic of both genres, ages ranging from 6 to 12 years old. Through a questionnaire filled in by the mothers, an inventory answered separatedly by the twins, and a drawing of the family also done by each one of the twins, we achieved structural characteristics and dynamics of the 1 families that participated, besides choosing 5 families, so that studies of cases were performed. Family configurations and lifestyle, the relationship nets established between the sub-systems of each family, and the perception of the children about their family operation were investigated emphasizing the twins relatinship. As the most important discoveries, we point: evidences that the family dynamics of the participants of the survey still follows the traditional patterns that reinforce the little participation of mean in the domestic routine, and overchange women (grandmothers, mothers, and old sisters); that the relationship of the participants with his co-twin is based on ambiguity, specially between the fellowship [...] ...|$|E
