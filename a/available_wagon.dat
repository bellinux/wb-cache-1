50|$|Mazda New Zealand again {{assembled}} {{a range of}} four-door sedan and five-door hatchback models, supplemented by the newly <b>available</b> <b>wagon,</b> and imported the coupe and a top five-door version, both with electronically controlled rear-wheel steering. Ford New Zealand's Telstar line was similar, including the wagon and imported rear-wheel steering models, but without the coupe. The wagon's arrival enabled Ford to drop the UK-sourced Sierra wagon from local assembly, simplifying model sourcing. The NZ-specification cars, though imported CKD, shared much of their specifications with uncatalyzed European models including the modified tail lamp assemblies with the mandatory-for-Europe fog light lenses though the bulbs and wiring were not included. This and later generations would also be imported used from Japan in later years, greatly widening the choice of models and specifications available in this market.|$|E

50|$|The lineup grew for 1960, {{when the}} company {{introduced}} a convertible (Studebaker's first since 1952) and a four-door station wagon. Two-door wagons were fast falling from favor throughout the industry, despite a minor redesign which made the two-door Lark wagon's tailgate and rear side windows more user-friendly, and indeed the four-door quickly proved the more popular of the two <b>available</b> <b>wagons</b> from Studebaker.|$|R
50|$|During the American Civil War, soldier Mike McComb is cashiered {{from the}} army when he disobeys orders {{in order to prevent}} the Confederates from {{stealing}} the one million dollars he is guarding by burning the money. After being publicly humiliated by the townspeople, he and his friend 'Pistol' Porter confiscate gambling equipment and set out to Silver City, Nevada to open a saloon and gambling hall. On his way to St. Joseph, Mike meets Georgia Moore, a beautiful but serious woman that runs the Silver River mine with her husband Stanley and is currently hiring all the <b>available</b> <b>wagons.</b>|$|R

50|$|The E30 was {{the first}} 3 Series to be <b>available</b> in <b>wagon</b> and four-door sedan body styles. It {{was also the first}} 3 Series to offer a diesel engine, and all-wheel drive was {{introduced}} to the 3 Series range with the 325iX model. The BMW Z1 roadster was based on the E30 platform.|$|R
25|$|In {{the early}} hours of the morning of 26 July, Brown ordered Ripley to recover the {{abandoned}} British guns the next day. Reinforcing his exhausted men with detachments which had been left at Chippawa, Ripley moved out at daybreak with 1,200 soldiers but found that Drummond had reoccupied the battlefield with 2,200 men. Ripley withdrew, unmolested. The American army fell back to Fort Erie, first deliberately destroying the old British fortifications along the Chippawa River and burning the bridges behind them. Because they were short of transport, they had to abandon or destroy much equipment and supplies to make room for the wounded on the <b>available</b> <b>wagons.</b> Drummond was later to claim from this that the Americans had retreated in disorder. In fact, after burying some of the British and Canadian dead on the battlefield and burning many American corpses in large funeral pyres, the British had themselves withdrawn to Queenston until Drummond received reinforcements.|$|R
50|$|The Conestoga station wagons {{were built}} on the Studebaker's 116.5 in {{wheelbase}} platform. One body style was <b>available,</b> a two-door <b>wagon</b> with a two-piece tailgate/liftgate configuration for accessing the cargo area.|$|R
50|$|The Latin American Chevettes {{underwent}} {{a series of}} facelifts, in 1978, 1983, and a major one in 1987 which meant new headlights and a black plastic grille. Where <b>available,</b> the station <b>wagon</b> used the Chevette name outside of Brazil.|$|R
50|$|Introduced in 1958 as Chevrolet's mid-priced station wagon, Brookwoods were {{trimmed in}} line with Chevrolet's mid-priced Chevrolet Biscayne models. The Brookwood offered for the 1958 model year was a 4-door station <b>wagon,</b> <b>available</b> in either six- or nine-passenger models.|$|R
50|$|For the 1995 model year, the ES sedan was {{relegated to}} fleet sales, {{leaving only the}} LS sedan and the station <b>wagon</b> <b>available</b> to the general public. For 1996, only the ES and LS sedan {{remained}} and were made available only to rental car companies.|$|R
5000|$|Note: May 2001 and September 2001 updates bear no revised badging, unlike [...] "Series 2"; {{transition}} from 150 kW to 155 kW for 3.5-litre V6 engine from September 2001 update; manual transmission not <b>available</b> in <b>wagons,</b> dedicated LPG or AWD models; all 5-speed automatic transmissions Sports Mode, as on 4-speed automatics from TJ MY02 series, with former transmission only on all AWD range and on Verada from KJ Series 2 upgrade; AWD range fitted only with 16-inch wheels; VR-X sedan only (TJ to TW series).|$|R
60|$|Vincent saluted, and, leading Wildfire, {{followed}} the orderly. When {{he had had}} a meal, he strolled out {{to see what was going}} on. Evidently some movement was in contemplation. Officers were riding up or dashing off from the general's headquarters. Two or three regiments were seen marching down from the plateau on which they were encamped into the town. Bells rang and drums beat, and presently long trains of railway wagons, heavily laden, began to make their way across the bridge. Until next morning the movement continued unceasingly; by that time all the military stores and public property, together with as much private property, belonging to inhabitants who had decided to forsake their homes for a time rather than to remain there when the town was occupied by the enemy, as could be carried on in the <b>available</b> <b>wagons,</b> had been taken across the bridge. A party of engineers, who had been all night hard at work, then set fire both to the railway bridge across the river and the public buildings in the town. The main body of troops had moved across in the evening. The rearguard passed when all was in readiness for the destruction of the bridge.|$|R
50|$|Ford Pinto and Mercury Bobcat 2-door wagons were {{produced}} between 1972 and 1980. American Motors also entered {{the market with}} a wagon version of the AMC Pacer, produced between 1977 and 1980. The last two-door <b>wagon</b> <b>available</b> in America, the Volkswagen Fox, was discontinued in 1991.|$|R
50|$|Volkswagen made {{a choice}} of three and five-door {{hatchback}} or a five-door station <b>wagon</b> <b>available.</b> The European Golf wagon was nearly identical to the North American Jetta Wagon. The only difference {{was the use of}} the Golf front headlights, bumpers, grille, hood, and fenders as these parts are interchangeable between the Mk4 Golf and Bora/Jetta.|$|R
50|$|In {{common with}} other {{countries}} in the Asia Pacific region, Ford New Zealand marketed the Mazda-based Laser and Telstar, which replaced the British Escort and Cortina in the early 1980s. Unlike Australia, however, the Sierra was assembled and sold locally in New Zealand in the mid-1980s and early 1990s, though generally only <b>available</b> as a <b>wagon.</b>|$|R
50|$|The Moskvitch-402 and 407 {{could be}} {{considered}} {{as the first step}} in Soviet and Russian automotive history towards producing customer-adapted trim levels for various uses. While the M-407 provided greater driving comfort at bigger expenses, other trim levels included the M-407-424 station <b>wagon</b> <b>available</b> for the general public, M-431 delivery pick-up/ambulance van and even the 410/411 attempt of creating an SUV-based sedan/station wagon.|$|R
50|$|To {{reduce the}} number of <b>wagons</b> <b>available</b> for bogie {{exchange}} (as wagons had a habit of disappearing interstate and only reappearing when due for maintenance), from 1977 the class was recoded to JCF. Also at this time, a further 15 wagons, 116 through 130, were being assembled in Ballarat Workshops. Released as JCX, they were immediately taken to Newport for reclassification.|$|R
50|$|The 100 wagons {{were built}} over about a year, and they entered service as either the BB or BP classes {{depending}} on the <b>available</b> bogies. BB <b>wagons</b> eventually included 22-29, 39, 41, 43-46, 49, 52 and 57-60. By late 1959 the entire fleet had been upgraded and reclassed as BP, except BB29 and BB45 which were altered in early 1960.|$|R
5000|$|In Turkey, where Tofaş {{built the}} car, {{there were also}} [...] "SX A" [...] and [...] "SX AK" [...] (climate control added) {{versions}} available.

It also saw the introduction of stability control (ASC), traction control (ASC+T) a 6-speed manual transmission and adjustable damping (EDC) to the 5 Series range.|$|R
50|$|An {{anomalous}} {{relative to}} the second generation Impreza is the Saab 9-2X. Manufactured in Japan by Subaru between 2004 and 2005, the Saab variant retailed only in the North American market for the 2005 and 2006 model years and was only <b>available</b> as a <b>wagon.</b> To better integrate with the Saab design language, the 9-2X received redesign of the front- and rear styling and various minor tweaks.|$|R
5000|$|The Brougham and 500 option {{packages}} continued, as did {{the availability}} of the Super-Lite, but the 440 Magnum V8 was dropped. The [...] version 440, <b>available</b> only in <b>wagons</b> for '69, became the new top engine for all Monacos.Despite all of the changes, which cost Chrysler a rather large sum of money, Monaco (and Polara) sales declined with 24,692 Monacos built for the model year.|$|R
5000|$|GLT Turbo (1981-85): Replaced the GT as the sporty model, {{equipped}} with a turbocharged engine, with an intercooler from mid-84.

50|$|In {{order to}} achieve the {{aspiration}} for a capacity of 11,000 goods wagons per day, Maschen was equipped from the beginning with the most modern shunting technology available in the 1970s. The composition of incoming goods trains was transmitted to Maschen before they arrived, so that the hitherto usual practice of handing over the trains in the reception sidings could be done away with. Using the data, train-splitting lists were created, these formed the working basis for the sequence control unit (Ablaufsteuerrechner or ASR). The ASR controls the shunters on the hump yards by radio, giving them the shunting speeds, setting the points for the rolling goods wagons and regulating their speed with retarders, 26 bar-type (Balkengleisbremsen) and 112 rubber retarders being <b>available.</b> 112 <b>wagon</b> transporters (Beidrückanlagen) move the loose wagons onwards within the sidings.|$|R
25|$|There {{is also a}} Japanese {{market model}} (including Axio sedan and Fielder <b>wagon)</b> <b>available</b> under {{parallel}} import status (parallel dealers buy the vehicle overseas and do the shipping, custom declaration, vehicle testing & warranty by themselves) from smaller agencies instead of buying from the local dealer. Grades available are the standard X variant and the higher-spec G variant. The Japanese market model, along with the Japanese market Camry and Wish, are used widely as CNG-fitted taxis.|$|R
5000|$|The 880 {{served as}} the base model line. The two-door sedan was the price leader at $2,404, but {{finished}} with the least sales for the model year. The more popular and better trimmed 990 models were <b>available</b> in sedan, <b>wagon,</b> hardtop, and convertible versions. Options included a vinyl roof, wire wheel covers, AM/FM radio, adjustable steering wheel, and cruise control. A new luxury DPL (short for [...] "Diplomat") two-door hardtop debuted {{at the top of}} the range.|$|R
2500|$|The 4.3L V6 engine {{received}} a [...] boost, rated at [...] The 305cuin engine was unchanged and remained standard on station wagons. Station wagons built after approximately November 1, 1985 came {{equipped with the}} Oldsmobile-built 307cuin engine. After this point, the 305cuin was no longer <b>available</b> in station <b>wagons.</b> This engine was used in all GM B-body station wagons {{from this point on}} to simplify production. The 307cuin was equipped with a four-barrel carburetor and was rated at [...] and [...] The 350cuin diesel engine was discontinued.|$|R
25|$|The ED Falcon came in {{response}} to Holden's new VR Commodore in 1993. The front grille was now elliptical to differentiate it from the EB, and the sports genre (XR6, and XR8) gained an exclusive quad headlamp cluster. Making a comeback in the ED range was the Futura. The safety orientated Futura was marketed towards private buyers, and was equipped with cruise control, anti-lock brakes, and featured body-coloured mirrors. For {{the first time since}} the XF series, the luxurious Fairmont Ghia trim level was not <b>available</b> in station <b>wagon</b> form.|$|R
50|$|The first {{car-carrying wagon}} explcitly {{designed}} by the Victorian Railways for this purpose was constructed in 1958. The wagon was built by recycling the underframe of a scrapped Swing Door type locomotive-hauled carriage, with skeletal truss sides supporting an upper level deck. The frame, constructed in 1902 as part of 1st class passenger carriage 4AA, was recoded 3A in the 1910 recoding then 144B in 1927, when better quality 1st class carriages had been made <b>available.</b> The new <b>wagon</b> had a capacity of three typical vehicles on each deck.|$|R
5000|$|A similar vehicle {{also was}} the four-horse, American-style covered <b>wagon,</b> <b>available</b> with {{material}} canopy and side water barrels. The canopy ("hood") was sometimes plain and sometimes imprinted with cowboy and Native American design. Over the years, boxes also came {{in a variety of}} colors. Later offerings of this covered wagon were [...] "Hawkeye, the Last of the Mohicans", and [...] "Walt Disney's Davey Crockett". This wagon normally appeared with four detachable horses, but at times came with six. Another smaller 3 in covered wagon was also offered (Rixon 2005, p. 68).|$|R
5000|$|Like its {{long-lived}} predecessor, the new 1963 Wagoneer {{took shape}} under industrial designer Brooks Stevens. Willys' engineering staff handled the technical development. The {{cost of development}} was around US$20 million.The original Wagoneer was a full-size body-on-frame vehicle which shared its architecture with the Jeep Gladiator pickup truck. It was originally available in two- and four-door body styles, with the two-door <b>wagon</b> <b>available</b> as a [...] "Panel Delivery" [...] model with windowless sides behind the doors and double [...] "barn doors" [...] in the rear {{instead of the usual}} tailgate and roll-down rear window.|$|R
50|$|Mitsubishi {{launched}} {{the second generation}} Mirage to Japan in 1983, again splitting the range into Mirage (three- and five-door hatchback, plus four-door sedan) and Lancer Fiore (four-door sedan) models. A station wagon version of the Mirage was added in 1985, with a four-wheel drive <b>wagon</b> <b>available</b> from the fall of 1986 with the 1.8-liter gasoline engine. Many export markets sold the hatchbacks as Mirage or Colt, with the sedan and wagon commonly badged Lancer. This wagon model {{went on to become}} very popular in both the commercial and private sectors overseas as well as in Japan.|$|R
50|$|The Suburban {{of today}} is a {{full-size}} SUV with three rows of seating, a full pickup truck frame, and V8 engine. It {{is one of the}} few station <b>wagons</b> <b>available</b> with all bench rows. The Suburban is the same height and width as the Chevrolet Tahoe, although the Suburban is 20 in longer. The extra length provides a full-sized cargo area behind the 9 passenger seating area. From 1973 to 2013 it had been available in half-ton and 3/4-ton versions, the latter discontinued after the 2013 model year, but was revived in 2015 as a fleet-exclusive vehicle for the 2016 model year.|$|R
