40|$|Problem statement: Evidence of {{rejection}} or acceptance by phytophagous pests of citrus plants treated with mineral oils suggests that impacts of oils {{may be related}} to detection by olfactory and/or contact chemoreceptors of repellent oils or plant volatiles. Alternatively, the oils may mask or suppress attractant host plant volatiles. To date, no studies have reported that oils elicit an olfactory response in Diaphorina citri Kuwayama [Hemiptera: Psyllidae]. Therefore, we undertook two studies to determine how oil deposits on citrus leaves influenced the behaviour of D. citri. Approach: The attractiveness of citrus leaves treated separately with an n C 21 horticultural mineral oil and an n C 24 agricultural mineral oil to D. citri was evaluated under laboratory conditions. In the first of two studies, the oils were applied as 0. 5 % <b>aqueous</b> <b>emulsions</b> to mandarin leaves and responses of adults determined after they walked on surfaces saturated with either distilled water or 2 % <b>aqueous</b> <b>emulsions</b> of the oils. In the second study, responses of adult psyllids to host-leaf volatiles, mineral oil volatiles emanating from leaves dipped in 2 % v/v <b>aqueous</b> <b>emulsions</b> of each oil and similarly treated filter paper paired with water-dipped leaves were determined in single, linear-tube olfactometers. Results: In the first study, deposits of both oils significantly reduced the proportion of D. citri attracted to citrus leaves. Prior exposure of the insects to oil deposits did not influence this response. However, prior contact with the HMO slightly reduced the proportion of psyllids alighting on the water-dipped leaves. In the second study, oil volatiles emanating from filter paper significantly reduced the attractiveness of water-dipped mandarin leaves. Conclusion: These results indicate that application of the oils to the mandarin leaves may have: (a) suppressed release of attractant host plant volatiles; (b) masked attractant host plant volatiles; (c) led to the release of repellent volatiles from leaves and/or (d) to adults being repelled by oil volatiles. The results from the study using the olfactometer suggested that detection of mineral oil volatiles by olfactory receptors of adult D. citri contributed to their response to oil deposits on the mandarin leaves...|$|R

40|$|We {{demonstrate}} a simple, low-cost, and green approach to deposit a microstructured coating on the silicone elastomer polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) {{that can be}} coated with gold to produce highly stretchable and conductive films. The microstructured coating is fabricated using an <b>aqueous</b> <b>emulsion</b> of poly(vinyl acetate) (PVAc) : common, commercially available white glue. The aqueous glue emulsion self-assembles on the PDMS surface to generate clustered PVAc globules, which can be conformally coated with gold. The microstructured surface provides numerous defect sites that localize strain when the structure is stretched, resulting in the initiation of numerous microcracks. As the structure is further elongated, the microcracks interact with one another, preventing long-range crack propagation and thus preserving the conduction pathway. The resistance of PDMS/glue/gold structures remains remarkably low (23 x the initial resistance) up to 65 % elongation, making these structure useful as stretchable interconnects. Decreasing the concentration of the PVAc <b>aqueous</b> <b>emulsion</b> reduces the density of defect sites of the microstructure, which increases the change in resistance of the gold films with stretching.

40|$|Abstract The aim of {{this study}} was to measure {{permeation}} of the herbicide dichlobenil in Casoron 4 G through disposable and chemically protective nitrile gloves using an American Society for Testing and Materials-type permeation cell and a closed-loop system employing two different solvents (hexane and water) and two different challenge situations (<b>aqueous</b> <b>emulsion</b> and solid formulation). Capillary gas chromatography–mass spectrometry was used for quantification purposes. The chemically protective glove did not allow any permeation up to 8 h for the solid-formulation and water-collection challenges, but permeation was detected in all other challenges. The disposable glove allowed the most permeation, and the solidformulation challenge with water collection necessitated that a dichlobenil equivalent be calculated because of the presence of its hydrolysis degradation product 2, 6 -dichlorobenzamide. Permeation from the solid formulation was detectable by hexane collection for both the disposable and chemically protective gloves and by water collection for the disposable glove. It was concluded that hexane-solvent collection was not valid for the disposable glove at 4 and 8 h of permeation in the solid Casoron challenge or for the <b>aqueous</b> <b>emulsion</b> challenge at 8 h relative to the watercollection solvent data.

It is shown that relatively monodisperse nanocomposite particles can be produced with typical mean weight-average diameters of 140 – 330 nm and silica contents of up to 39 wt %. The importance of surface functionalization of the silica sol is highlighted, and it is demonstrated that systematic variation of parameters such as the initial silica sol concentration and initiator concentration affect both the mean particle diameter and the silica aggregation efficiency. The nanocomposite morphology comprises a copolymer core and a particulate silica shell, as determined by aqueous electrophoresis, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and electron microscopy.
