25|$|New {{research}} in the related field entomotoxicology is currently studying the effects of drugs {{on the development of}} insects who have fed on the decomposing tissue of a drug user. The effects of drugs and toxins on insect development are proving to be an important factor when determining the insect colonization time. It has been shown that cocaine use can accelerate the development of maggots. In one case, Lucilia sericata larvae that fed in the nasal cavity of a cocaine abuser, grew over 8mm longer than larvae of the same generation found elsewhere on the body. Other researchers in entomotoxicology are developing techniques to detect and measure drug levels in older fly pupae. This research is useful for determining cause of death for bodies that are found during later stages of decay. To this date, bromazepam, levomepromazine, malathion, phenobarbital, trazolam, oxazepam, <b>alimemazine,</b> clomipramine, morphine, mercury, and copper have been recovered from maggots.|$|E

40|$|<b>Alimemazine,</b> DL- 10 -(3 -dimethylamino- 2 -methyl-propyl) {{phenothiazine}} {{is a new}} phenothiazine derivative, and {{has shown}} antihistarninic and antipruritic qualities in clinical studies, but its tranquillizing effect has not been studied clearly. The experimental investigations on various pharmacological properties of this substance were performed mainly on cardiovascular and central effects. From the present series of experiments, it may be summarized as follows : 1) <b>Alimemazine</b> exerts an inhibitory action on isolated heart and causes vasodilatation of peripheral vessels. 2) In unanesthetized rabbit, the intravenous injection of 1 mg/kg or 5 mg/kg of <b>alimemazine</b> causes a fair in blood pressure, and a dose of 1 mg/kg intracarotidly of alimemazin causes a dramatic drop in blood pressure. The intravertebral injection of 0. 2 - 0. 3 mg/kg of <b>alimemazine</b> causes a marked fall in blood pressure. 3) <b>Alimemazine</b> decreases the vasopressor response to adrenaline or vasodepressor response to acetylchline, and decreases the contraction of frog 2 ̆ 7 s rectus muscle by acetylcholine. 4) <b>Alimemazine</b> reduces the fall or rise in blood pressure caused dy excitation of the peripheral or central end of the cut vagus. 5) <b>Alimemazine</b> decreases the contraction of nictitating membrane of cat, which is produced by excitation of the cervical sympathetic nerve or intravenous injection of adrenaline. 6) <b>Alimemazine</b> exert a sedative action on mouse and rabbit. 7) In conscious unrestrained rabbit, the intravenous injection of 5 mg/kg of <b>alimemazine</b> produces the sleep pattern which is not blocked by acoustic stimuli, but this pattern is not longer than that of chlorpromazine. 8) <b>Alimemazine</b> depresses the monosynaptic reflex discharge in soleus muscle of cat...|$|E
40|$|We have {{previously}} demonstrated (J Immunol 1995; 154 : 3593) that MHC class II antigens can be induced on thyroid epithelial cells (TEC) by <b>alimemazine,</b> {{a member of}} the phenothiazine group. Although this expression of MHC class II antigens on TEC confers the theoretical ability to behave as antigen-presenting cells (APC), the simultaneous expression of self antigens and co-receptor(s) must also occur for efficient presentation of self antigens. Therefore, we investigated whether <b>alimemazine</b> applied at pharmacologic doses would modify the expression of thyroid antigens, and simultaneously, the expression of intercellular adhesion molecule- 1 (ICAM- 1), B 7, and LFA- 1 co-receptors in human TEC in culture. Using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification and Northern blot analysis, we showed that <b>alimemazine</b> induces increases in thyroglobulin (Tg) and thyroid-stimulating hormone receptor (TSH-R) cDNA, within the first 2 h following its addition. This phenomenon is followed 48 h later by an increase of Tg and TSH-R protein expression on the surface of TEC. Furthermore, increases in the expression of ICAM- 1 and B 7 co-receptors were concomitantly observed. These results suggest that <b>alimemazine,</b> a drug currently used in paediatrics, could {{play a role in the}} induction and perpetuation of thyroid autoimmune disorders by transforming TEC into functional APC...|$|E
40|$|UNLABELLED: Neuroleptic {{malignant}} syndrome (NMS) {{is a rare}} but serious disorder {{caused by}} antipsychotic medication including phenothiazines. For sedative purposes, increasing doses of <b>alimemazine</b> were administered to a 4 -year-old multiple handicapped girl, with cerebral damage of the basal ganglia. She developed extra-pyramidal motor disturbances, an autonomic disorder, lowered consciousness and hyperthermia, characterising NMS. <b>Alimemazine</b> was stopped and dantrolene and supportive measures, including ventilation under sedation and paralysis with midazolam and vecuronium, were started. As clinical symptoms remained unabated, increasing doses of bromocriptine were administered. Two days after maximal bromocriptine dosage, her clinical condition improved and paralysis and ventilation were stopped. Midazolam and bromocriptine could be gradually decreased and suspended during the following months. A few days after bromocriptine cessation NMS recurred and was complicated by a fatal cardiorespiratory arrest. CONCLUSION: caution must be exercised when prescribing <b>alimemazine,</b> especially to children with basal ganglia damage {{and in the case}} of inexplicable fever and restlessness, neuroleptic malignant syndrome should be considered. Long-term therapy with bromocriptine combined with dantrolene and midazolam may be a successful medical treatment...|$|E
40|$|Objective: {{to reveal}} {{clinical}} and immunological criteria for psychogenic urticaria (PU) {{and to determine}} the therapeutic efficacy of alimemazine in this abnormality. Patients and methods. Ninety-three patients with PU, 46 apparently healthy individuals, and 90 patients with chronic autoimmune urticaria (CAU) were examined. The methods included clinical examination; use of the Goldberg anxiety rating scale; enzyme immunoassay of serum substance P levels. The efficacy of <b>alimemazine</b> was evaluated in an open-label comparative randomized trial for 4 weeks. Results and discussion. Patients with PU significantly more frequently showed a predominance of manifestations of itching over skin rashes and higher levels of anxiety disorders than those with CAU. The mean serum concentration of substance P was 0. 006 ± 0. 005 ng/ml in the patients with CAU, 0. 026 ± 0. 02 ng/ml in healthy individuals, and 8. 46 ± 0. 95 ng/ml in the patients with PU (p< 0. 0001). Addition of standard therapy (second-generation antihistamines, disintoxication) with <b>alimemazine</b> 15 – 30 mg/day ensured statistically significant advantages over the control (standard therapy) in the following indicators: reductions in {{the severity of the}} disease, the degree of anxiety disorders, and the serum levels of substance P. <b>Alimemazine</b> was noted to be satisfactorily tolerated.  Thus, the authors established the following diagnostic criteria for PU: a psychotraumatic situation; dermal manifestations after psychogeny; high anxiety; a predominance of the manifestations of itching over the dermal symptoms of urticaria; and elevated serum substance P concentrations.  Standard therapy added by <b>alimemazine</b> versus that without the drug was found to be effective. There were reductions in the symptoms of urticaria, the degree of anxiety disorders, and the levels of substance P. </p...|$|E

40|$|Background Time-trend {{studies on}} psychotropic drugs among {{children}} and adolescents are scarce, {{and most of them}} are outdated. The purpose of this study was to study prevalences of psychotropic drug use during 2004 – 2014 among Norwegians aged < 18 years, overall and in psychotropic sub-groups. Methods Data were obtained from the Norwegian Prescription Database, which covers all dispensed prescription drugs in Norway from 2004 and onwards. Psychotropic drugs included: antipsychotics (ATC-group N 05 A), anxiolytics (N 05 B), hypnotic/sedatives (N 05 C), antidepressants (N 06 A), stimulants (N 06 BA), and <b>alimemazine</b> (R 06 AD 01). Period (1 -year) prevalence of use, overall and in subgroups of psychotropic drugs, was estimated by identifying individuals < 18 years who had at least one psychotropic drug dispensed during each year. Results Psychotropic drug use increased in 0 – 17 year olds over an 11 -year period, in which the main contributing drugs were stimulants (boys overall; 15. 0 to 20. 8 / 1000, girls overall; 3. 8 to 8. 5 / 1000), hypnotic/sedative drugs in adolescents (boys overall; 4. 2 to 10. 8 / 1000, girls overall; 2. 6 to 8. 8 / 1000) and to some extent antidepressants among adolescent girls (girls overall from 3. 1 to 4. 0 / 1000). Psychotropic drug use was, however, reduced by half in the youngest children, attributed to reduction of <b>alimemazine</b> only (1 -year olds: boys; from 36. 6 to 10. 2 / 1000, girls; 26. 9 to 7. 2 / 1000).

40|$|AbstractThe {{antihistaminic}} drug trimeprazine (1, {{also known}} as <b>alimemazine)</b> is photolabile under UV-A light in aerobic conditions.

The formation of products was explained by the oxidative photodegradation of trimeprazine in an irreversible trapping of the self-photogenerated 1 O 2 by the type II photodynamic action of the drug.

40|$|This article {{presents}} {{a study conducted}} on data containing drug concentrations. The data was obtained from femoral venous blood samples collected at medico legal autopsies in Sweden. Cases positive for antidepressant drugs were scrutinized and divided in to two groups for 15 antidepressant drugs: B‑cases, where {{the cause of death}} was intoxication with more than one drug detected in the blood sample. C‑cases, where {{the cause of death was}} NOT intoxication and at least one drug (the antidepressant) was detected in the blood sample. This data was then processed to find frequencies of concomitant drugs taken together with the antidepressant drugs. Frequencies of the most common concomitant drugs were then compared between B-cases and C-cases for each antidepressant drug. This revealed that the drugs dextropropoxyphene, ethanol, codeine, flunitrazepam, paracetamol, propiomazine and <b>alimemazine</b> were signifcantly more common as concomitant drugs in B-cases (intoxications) than in C‑cases (non‑intoxications). With regards to unknown interactions the most interesting combinations were: Propiomazine with mirtazapine, venlafaxine, citalopram or fluoxetine; Paracetamol with paroxetine; Flunitrazepam with mirtazapine, venlafaxine or citalopram; Codeine with mirtazapine or sertraline.

40|$|International audienceAgitation {{is one of}} the {{diagnostic}} features of catatonia in the DSM IV classification, but permanent forms of agitated catatonia have occasionally been described. We report the case of a 43 -year-old man who had already suffered from undifferentiated schizophrenia for 7 years, and in whom we diagnosed agitated catatonia. While our patient was being treated with a neuroleptic during a second episode of paranoia, a state of agitation was observed which persisted for a further 8 months. During this period, he was treated with several different neuroleptics and benzodiazepines, either alone or in association, without any improvement. No organic cause was found. He was then transferred to our electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) unit, with a diagnosis of schizophrenic agitation resistant to drug therapy. ECT was begun, and he was only given droperidol in case of agitation and <b>alimemazine</b> for insomnia, neither of which had any effect. In view of his persistent agitation without any purpose, echolalia and echopraxia, stereotyped movements with mannerisms and marked mimicking and grimacing, we diagnosed him as having agitated catatonia. After the fourth session of ECT, we decided to stop all treatment and gave him lorazepam at a dose of 12. 5 mg daily. Twenty-four hours later, all symptoms of agitation had disappeared. In our opinion, permanent catatonic agitation is not rare. In our case, the neuroleptic treatment maintained and may even have worsened the symptomatology. Lorazepam {{can be used as a}} therapeutic test for this type of agitation, especially if it does not respond to neuroleptics. This also allows the patient to be sedated rapidly and effectively, thus preventing him from injuring himself further...|$|E

To investigate the pro-arrhythmic potential of antihistamines by combining safety reports of the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) with drug utilization data from 13 European Countries. We identified signals of antihistamine arrhythmogenic potential by analyzing FAERS database for all cases of Torsades de Pointes (TdP), QT abnormalities (QTabn), ventricular arrhythmia (VA) and sudden cardiac death/cardiac arrest (SCD/CA). Number of cases ≥ 3 and disproportionality were used to define alert signals: TdP and QTabn identified stronger signals, whereas SCD/CA identified weaker signals. Drug utilization data from 2005 to 2010 were collected from administrative databases through health authorities and insurance. Antihistamines were reported in 109 cases of TdP/QT prolongation, 278 VA and 610 SCD/CA. Five agents resulted in stronger signals (cetirizine, desloratadine, diphenhydramine, fexofenadine, loratadine) and 6 in weaker signals (<b>alimemazine,</b> carbinoxamine, cyclizine, cyproeptadine, dexchlorpheniramine and doxylamine).

40|$|Background: The use of anti-histaminic agents {{has been}} {{increased}} significantly from last decades and till now no method {{is available for}} quantitation of ALZ in human plasma which can be applied in a bioequivalence study using LC-MS/MS. Objective: The present study {{is concerned with the}} development and validation of ALZ in human plasma by high performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS/MS). Materials and Methods: Sample preparation involved the extraction with liquid-liquid extraction method by using ethyl acetate as an organic solvent. Chromatographic separation was performed on Atlantis; T 3 5 ΅m 4. 6 mm Χ 150 mm column with the mobile phase consisting of acetonitrile: (10 mm ammonium formate buffer: Formic acid: 99. 9 : 00. 1 v/v) 50 : 50 v/v. The interface used with the application programming interface 4000 LC-MS/MS was a turbo ion spray in which positive ions were measured in multiple reaction monitoring mode. The precursor to product ions transition of m/z 299. 30 → 100. 20 amu and 305. 30 → 106. 30 amu were used for ALZ and ALZ D 6 respectively. Results: The method was validated over the concentration range of 20. 013 - 10006. 551 pg/mL. The mean percent recovery of ALZ was found 77. 771 % with a precision of 7. 71 % and the lower limit of quantification was 20. 013 pg/mL. The intra- and inter-day precision of the method at three concentrations was 0. 98 - 4. 50 % and 1. 57 - 5. 72 % while the intra- and inter-day % accuracy was 99. 02 - 93. 82 % and 101. 78 - 106. 96 %. Stability of compounds was established in a series of stability studies. The application of this method was demonstrated in the bioequivalence study and was found suitable in a study of sample size as big as 30 enrolled volunteers.
