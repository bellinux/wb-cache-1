Microdosing is a process whereby volunteers are <b>administered</b> <b>a</b> small dose of a test compound allowing researchers to investigate its pharmacological affects without harming the volunteers. Microdosing can replace the use of animals in pre-clinical drug screening and can reduce the number of animals used in safety and toxicity testing.|$|E

25|$|Alcoholics {{are often}} {{deficient}} in various nutrients, {{which can cause}} severe complications during alcohol withdrawal, such as the development of Wernicke syndrome. To help to prevent Wernicke syndrome, alcoholics should be <b>administered</b> <b>a</b> multivitamin preparation with sufficient quantities of thiamine and folic acid. During alcohol withdrawal, the prophylactic administration of thiamine, folic acid, and pyridoxine intravenously is recommended before starting any carbohydrate-containing fluids or food. These vitamins are often combined into a banana bag for intravenous administration.|$|E
25|$|District {{officials}} were {{appointed by the}} King, {{with a few exceptions}} (local parliaments—sejmiki—chose Chamberlains, District Judges, Deputy District Judges, District Clerks, and in Lithuania also Standard-bearers and District Marshals). Chamberlains, except for the name, had nothing in common with the Court officials of the same name. They <b>administered</b> <b>a</b> court of law (the Chamberlain's Court) which had jurisdiction over property disputes. The District Judge headed the District Court, which had jurisdiction over civil and some criminal matters involving local nobility.|$|E

During the same year, he was a cabinet-appointed inspector of historical monuments in Moldavia. In spring of 1882, shortly before his death, Ghica, {{like many of his}} fellow National Liberals, spoke out against I.

As before, Gothic law was clear. Wamba could no longer be king. So he accepted this change and happily became a monk, abdicating the throne on October 14, 680, to live out the last seven years of his life in seclusion from the world (dying in 687). Erwig became king in his place.|$|E
25|$|A nation-wide manhunt ensued. Sherman {{was found}} {{four days later}} in Toledo, Ohio. He {{explained}} under interrogation that he had eloped with his girlfriend and denied that the handkerchief was his. He was <b>administered</b> <b>a</b> polygraph test, which he passed, and was later cleared. The handkerchief's real owner, Airman Seymour Sherman of New York City, was eventually found. He {{had been out of}} the country when Suzanne Degnan was murdered. He had no idea how it could possibly have ended up in Chicago and the presence of the handkerchief was determined to be a coincidence.|$|E
25|$|Although {{chlorination}} was effective, it {{was difficult}} to manage the pH of the water, as chlorine could cause burning of the skin if wrongly <b>administered.</b> <b>A</b> simple test was devised in 1939 which made chlorination practical. World War II delayed its introduction until the early 1950s. The October 16, 1950 Life magazine had a large illustration of boys swimming together in the indoor pool of New Trier High School in Winnetka, Illinois, and the caption didn't mention they were naked. The practice continued in the states that had a tradition of nude swimming.|$|E

25|$|Both {{miraculously}} {{survived the}} crash, only to face rapid dehydration in the intense desert heat. Their maps were primitive and ambiguous. Lost among the sand dunes {{with a few}} grapes, a thermos of coffee, a single orange, and some wine, the pair had only one day's worth of liquid. They both began to see mirages, which were quickly followed by more vivid hallucinations. By {{the second and third}} days, they were so dehydrated that they stopped sweating altogether. Finally, on the fourth day, a Bedouin on a camel discovered them and <b>administered</b> <b>a</b> native rehydration treatment, which saved Saint-Exupéry's and Prévot's lives.|$|E
25|$|Later, they board a {{submarine}} that carries refugees to Canada. To avoid satellite detection, the submarine abandons and shoots some refugees. Aurora, infuriated {{by the loss}} of life, operates the 30-year-old submarine without training. Sister Rebeka tells Toorop that Aurora could speak nineteen different languages by the age of two, and always seems to know things she has never learned. Three months before leaving with Toorop, she began acting differently. This occurred after a Noelite doctor <b>administered</b> <b>a</b> pill. The doctor tells her to go to New York City and arranges for Toorop to take them.|$|E
25|$|Cullen's first confessed murders {{occurred}} {{while working}} at St. Barnabas. On June 11, 1988, he <b>administered</b> <b>a</b> lethal overdose of intravenous medication to Judge John W. Yengo, Sr, who had been {{admitted to the hospital}} suffering from a photoallergic reaction to a blood-thinning drug. Cullen admitted to killing several other patients at St. Barnabas, including an AIDS patient who died after being given an overdose of insulin. Cullen left St. Barnabas in January 1992 when hospital authorities began investigating who had contaminated IV bags. An internal investigation at St. Barnabas determined that Cullen was most likely responsible for the contaminations, resulting in dozens of patient deaths at the hospital.|$|E

They attempt to obtain financial advantage by pairing off their acquaintance, Fledgeby, first with the heiress Georgiana Podsnap and later with Bella Wilfer. Fledgeby is an extortioner and money-lender, who uses the kindly old Jew, Riah, as his cover, temporarily causing Riah to fall out with his friend and protégée Jenny Wren. Eventually, all attempts at improving their financial situation having failed, the Lammles leave England, Mr Lammle having first <b>administered</b> <b>a</b> sound beating to Fledgeby.|$|E
25|$|Candidate {{destinations}} included Guiana, {{where the}} Dutch had already established Essequibo, or {{somewhere near the}} existing Virginia settlements. Virginia was an attractive destination because {{the presence of the}} older colony might offer better security and trade opportunities. It was thought, however, that they should not settle too near, since that might too closely duplicate the political environment back in England. The London Company <b>administered</b> <b>a</b> territory of considerable size in the region. The intended settlement location was {{at the mouth of the}} Hudson River. This made it possible to settle at a distance which allayed concerns of social, political, and religious conflicts, but still provided the military and economic benefits of relative closeness to an established colony.|$|E
25|$|Holyfield {{made his}} next defense in Atlanta against Bert Cooper, who {{surprised}} {{him with a}} very good effort. Holyfield scored the first knockdown of the fight against Cooper with a powerful shot to the body, but Cooper returned the favor with a good right hand that sent Holyfield against the ropes; while not an actual knockdown, referee Mills Lane gave Holyfield a standing 8-count. Having suffered the first technical knockdown of his professional career, Holyfield regained his composure quickly and <b>administered</b> <b>a</b> beating that left Cooper still on his feet, but unable to defend himself. Holyfield landed brutal power shots, culminated by repeated vicious uppercuts that snapped Cooper's head back. Referee Mills Lane stopped the bout in the seventh.|$|E
