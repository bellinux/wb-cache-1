40|$|Despite its {{endorsement}} by the Treaty of Amsterdam, {{the origins}} {{and content of the}} 'common travel area' between Britain and Ireland remain largely unknown. This article relies upon published and archive material in order to provide a comprehensive analysis of the common travel area. It shows that the common travel area has been founded upon <b>administrative</b> <b>agreements</b> (in 1922 and 1952), that it has influenced the special status of Irish nationals in British law and vice versa, and that it has been reflected in the law on entry to each state from the other and in the enforcement by each state of the other's immigration policy. It goes on to argue that the existence of a land border between the two states has been the primary reason for the common travel area. The implications for the common travel area of the recent increase in immigration to Ireland are then examined. Here, it is shown there have been significant changes to Irish immigration law relating to the common travel area since 1997, and it is suggested that these new circumstances may result in further reform of laws and practices in both Britain and Ireland. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{reform of}} {{administrative}} procedure and the applicable General Administrative Procedure Act (GAPA) calls {{for determining the}} 'open' and 'disputable' issues {{in the application of}} this Act. The process of reforming the administrative legislation does not only imply taking into account the EU standards but also considering the complex, abundant and diverse national administrative practice and case law. The Serbian administrative practice points to some 'open' questions in the application of the current GAPA which should be the cornerstones in the reform of administrative legislation. In that course, it is crucial to start from the current administrative legislation and administrative practice. It is worth noting that the GAPA is already subject to permanent reform through the process of amending the subject-specific substantive provisions governing special administrative proceedings. Such practice should be upheld because the area of special administrative procedure is a dynamic environment where the APA is actually being modeled by amending the special administrative proceedings but in full compliance with the fundamental GAPA principles. Thus, the GAPA should be subject to minimal reform, primarily in the regulation of those procedural matters which have already passed the application test in both national and comparative practice; these 'safe points of reference' significantly improve the process in line with the basic administrative principles and largely contribute to its efficiency, as opposed to other alternative proposals on procedural solutions. The basic presumption for a successful APA reform is the functional analysis of the Draft GAPA. Some of the disputable issues include {{the subject matter of the}} GAPA, the enactment of administrative acts and concluding <b>administrative</b> <b>agreements.</b> In case of expanding the scope of the GAPA subject matter, the legislator is obliged to expressly regulate the administrative proceeding for concluding <b>administrative</b> <b>agreements</b> under the GAPA rules. This can be achieved either by amending the APA or by enacting a subject-specific act. The former option includes a number of possible solutions that we may consider (the Croatian APA, the ghastly Serbian draft GAPA, or the relevant application of the Public Procurement Act, etc.). Another previous and/or related question is what kind of concept of administrative procedure we shall opt for: the narrow (Austrian) or the broader (German) concept, where any action of the public administration is regarded as an administrative proceeding. There is a number of other disputable issues open for further discussion: shall the public authority be delegated only by means of a legislative act or agreement, and who is to scrutinize these processes; what is the inter-relation between the administrative procedure and the inspection procedure (in terms of general and subject-specific administrative procedures, or special administrative proceedings); can the administrative procedure institutes be accordingly applied in the inspection procedure (e. g., 'silence' of the inspection); what is the statutory time limit for the validity of interim administrative decisions; are the extraordinary legal remedies justifiable; is it practicable to shorten the time limit for issuing a decision; is the favorable concept of administrative silence sustainable; what are the legal effects of the E-governance procedure, etc...|$|E
40|$|CHDS State/LocalApproved {{for public}} release, {{distribution}} is unlimitedTo defend American agriculture against foreign or domestic terrorism, {{it is essential}} that states build multi-state partnerships to provide for the collaborative plans, programs and operations needed to protect the nations food security. The National Homeland Security Strategy puts states on the front lines {{in the war against terrorism}} [...] -including the struggle to secure the agriculture industry from potentially devastating attack. The issues surrounding agro-terrorism are vast and complex and the resources of the Federal government to address these issues are limited and overextended. If states attempt to address this threat independently, important opportunities to reduce vulnerability and enhance capability will be lost. To achieve the capabilities needed for agro terrorism detection, mitigation, preparedness and response, states must collaborate to build the partnerships and programs their citizens require. This thesis argues multi-state partnerships are critical to defeating this threat as well as providing a robust response to an attack. Whether intentionally introduced or naturally occurring, infectious diseases can easily cross state borders before an outbreak is even detected. States must be prepared to act quickly to mitigate the effects of any crisis. There is a significant opportunity for states to strengthen their abilities to provide for a stronger agriculture counter terrorism preparedness system. The states can further their ability to combat attacks on agriculture actively by demonstrating leadership in implementing <b>administrative</b> <b>agreements</b> and ultimately adopting compact(s) between states as well as with the private sector.

40|$|During {{the second}} half of the Nineties, the Immigration and Naturalization Service(IND) and the {{immigrant}} chambers of The Hague court had started to fall behind insettling asylum procedures. At that time, many asylum seekers were staying in the Netherlands without a (permanent) residence permit. They ‘congested’ the asylumchain. After heated political and social debates, the decision was made to set up apardon regulation to settle the legacy of the old immigration law. This regulation,which took effect on 15 June 2007, meant that residence permits would be officially granted to a clearly delimited group of asylum seekers. It was coupled to basicprinciples and agreements laid down in an <b>Administrative</b> <b>Agreement</b> between thecentral government and municipalities.

40|$|The {{realization}} of the management tasks by the administrative agencies in conditions of a decentralized model of the economy requires the tools adjusted to {{the wide range of}} self-dependence of enterprises. The instruments which undoubtedly meet the above requirements are a civil law contract and an <b>administrative</b> <b>agreement.</b> The author has carried out the analysis of the said acts defining their characteristic features and pointing out to {{the differences between the two}} insruments. According to the author, common features of both acts are relatively equal status of participants (parties) and their unanimous expression of the will to conclude an act on cooperation. In the author's opinion, the law in force seems to point out to the tendency of a further development of a civil law contract and an <b>administrative</b> <b>agreement</b> as forms of the administrative agencies' activity in the management of the state economy. He indicates that the appearance of new types of bilateral acts and the transformation of the traditional ones is a natural course for the evolution of legal forms of the administrative activity. He stresses the need to work out a consistent conception, expressed in legal norms, of applying those acts by the administrative agencies. He presented some elements of such a conception and formulated some postulates as to the future law. Finally, he is against an excessively detailed legal regulation of the said instruments.
