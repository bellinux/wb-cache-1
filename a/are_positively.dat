5|$|Loggerheads may display {{multiple}} paternity. Multiple paternity {{is possible}} due to sperm storage. The female can store sperm from multiple males in her oviducts until ovulation. A single clutch may {{have as many}} as seven fathers, each contributing sperm to a portion of the clutch. Multiple paternity and female size <b>are</b> <b>positively</b> correlated. Two hypotheses explain this correlation. One posits that males favor large females because of their perceived higher fecundity (ability to reproduce). The other states, because larger females are able to swim more quickly to mating grounds, they have longer mating periods.|$|E

5|$|When a stem is developing, {{the fungus}} is {{negatively}} geotropic, {{so that if}} the axis of the stem is tilted by 90 degrees, it will return to a vertical position within 24 hours. The extending hyphae that form the cap are themselves diageotropic—they will grow {{at right angles to}} the direction of gravity. Finally, the spines <b>are</b> <b>positively</b> geotropic, and will re-orient themselves to point downward if the mushroom orientation changes. Because the second (cap formation) and third (spine formation) geotropic responses overlap, there is a brief period where two different geotropic responses are operating simultaneously. These geotropic transitions help ensure that the final alignment results in optimum spore dispersal.|$|E
5|$|Balaenids rely {{on their}} huge heads, {{as opposed to the}} rorquals' throat pleats, to feed effectively. This feeding {{behavior}} allows them to grow very big and bulky, without the necessity for a streamlined body. They have callosities, unlike other whales, {{with the exception of the}} bowhead whale. Rorquals have a higher proportion of muscle tissue and tend to be negatively buoyant, whereas right whales have a higher proportion of blubber and <b>are</b> <b>positively</b> buoyant. Gray whales are easily distinguished from other extant cetaceans by their sleet-gray color, dorsal ridges (knuckles on the back), and their gray-white scars left from parasites. As with the rorquals, their throat pleats increase the capacity of their throats, allowing them to filter larger volumes of water at once. Gray whales are bottom-feeders, meaning they sift through sand to get their food. They usually turn on their sides, scoop up sediment into their mouths and filter out benthic creatures like amphipods, which leave noticeable marks on their heads.|$|E

A Pearson product-moment correlation was conducted to examine the inter-correlations between the leadership styles, the inter-correlations between the four SEEQ factors of Learning, Breadth, Examinations, and Assignments, {{and the relationship between}} the four SEEQ factors and the leadership styles. Transformational leadership was highly correlated with transactional leadership and passive avoidant leadership style was negatively correlated with transactional leadership and transformational leadership.

It has been found that higher levels of apoE <b>are</b> <b>positively</b> correlated with greater sulfatide depletion. ApoE-associated proteins take sulfatide from the myelin sheath and then degrade sulfatide into various compounds, such as sulfate.
