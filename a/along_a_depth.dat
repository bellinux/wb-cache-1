In recent years, MCEs have gained attention due to their depths that provide protection from natural and anthropogenic stressors and their relative stability over evolutionary time periods, yet ecological structures of fish assemblages in MCEs remain largely un-documented. Here, we investigated composition and trophic structure of reef fish assemblages in the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands (NWHI) <b>along</b> <b>a</b> <b>depth</b> gradient from 1 to 67 m. The structure of reef fish assemblages as a whole showed a clear gradient from shallow to mesophotic depths. Fish assemblages at mesophotic depths had higher total densities than those in shallower waters, and were characterized by relatively high densities of planktivores and invertivores and relatively low densities of herbivores. Fishes that typified assemblages at mesophotic depths included six species that are endemic to the Hawaiian Islands. The present study showed that mesophotic reefs in the NWHI support unique assemblages of fish that are characterized by high endemism and relatively high densities of planktivores. Our findings underscore the ecological importance of these undersurveyed ecosystems and warrant further studies of MCEs...|$|E

40|$|In {{contrast}} to the abundance of literature {{on the relationship between}} fish assemblages and habitat structure in the upper 30 in of coral reefs, the deeper (> 40 m) parts of coral reefs are rarely studied. We examined changes in reef fish diversity and habitat structure <b>along</b> <b>an</b> increasing <b>depth</b> gradient, including the unknown deep reef. We ran visual and video transects <b>along</b> <b>a</b> substantial <b>depth</b> gradient (0 to 65 in) in the northern Red Sea and extended the known depth distribution for 48 reef species. We found a change in assemblage composition highly correlated to both the <b>depth</b> gradient and <b>a</b> reduction in the abundance of branching corals with depth. The number of reef fish species declined with depth and we also measured a high species turnover as measured by beta diversity (beta(t), beta(w)) in the deep reef. This pattern is mainly due to the replacement of the abundant damselfishes in the shallow reef, which prey on zooplankton, by zooplanktivorous sea basses and wrasses in the deep reef. The steep reduction in branching corals, which most damselfishes use for cover, may be the main factor contributing to this change. We found a peak in species richness (alpha diversity) at 30 m, a peak in beta(w) at 50 to 65 in, and peaks in beta(t) at 30 to 50 in and 50 to 65 m. The 30 in depth stratum shows species of both shallow and deep assemblages generating a transition zone with characters of both deep and shallow habitats.

40|$|Nematode assemblages <b>along</b> <b>a</b> Mediterranean <b>depth</b> {{transect}} (160 - 1220 m) and vertically in {{the sediment}} were investigated. The {{station at the}} edge of the continental shelf (160 m) was distinctly different from those situated on the continental slope (280 - 1220 m). On the slope, nematode communities in the upper centimetre differed significantly from communities in the deeper sediment layers, which were dominated by fewer and larger species. Vertical segregation could be a factor explaining the coexistence of several species belonging to the genus Sabatieria, with larger species penetrating deeper into the sediment. Clear differences in buccal morphology suggest food resource partitioning as the dominant factor promoting coexistence of several species belonging to the other dominant genus, Acantholaimus.

In this study, we {{investigate}} phosphorus (P) and iron (Fe) cycling in sediments <b>along</b> <b>a</b> <b>depth</b> transect from within to {{well below the}} oxygen minimum zone (OMZ) in the northern Arabian Sea (Murray Ridge). Pore-water and solid-phase analyses show that authigenic formation of cal-cium phosphate minerals (Ca-P) is largely restricted to where the OMZ intersects the seafloor topography, likely due to higher depositional fluxes of reactive P. Nonetheless, in-creased ratios of organic carbon to organic P (Corg/Porg) and to total reactive P (Corg/Preactive) in surface sediments indi-cate that the overall burial efficiency of P relative to Corg de-creases under the low bottom water oxygen concentrations (BWO) in the OMZ. The relatively constant Fe/Al ratio in surface sediments along the depth transect suggest that corre-sponding changes in Fe burial are limited. Sedimentary pyrit...|$|E

40|$|The subtidal seaweed {{communities}} of the KwaZulu-Natal coast are poorly understood. A recent collaborative research project between Belgian and South African phycologists, however, is currently investigating the diversity and biogeographical affinities of the marine benthic algal flora of this region. The newest leg of the project is focusing on correlating biogeographic patterns with abiotic factors in the area between the St. Lucia estuary and Sodwana Bay, where it has become evident {{that there is a}} huge turnover in species composition. The present study examines seaweed community change <b>along</b> <b>a</b> <b>depth</b> gradient (1 - 30 m depth) at Sodwana Bay on the KwaZulu-Natal (KZN) coast, South Africa. All seaweed cover within 25 x 25 cm quadrats was collected, identified and weighed. The environmental variables, depth and % sand cover, were also measured. Both biomass and presence/absence data were ordinated to show community differentiation related to the environmental variables. The seaweed communities are largely red turfs, with a total of 82 Rhodophyte, 14 Chlorophyte, and 8 Phaeophyte taxa recorded. These turf communities showed exceptional diversity with 105 taxa (> 25 % of recorded KZN flora) occurring in the total sample area of 1. 56 m². Seaweed communities clearly change with depth, but the biggest change occurs between the shallow subtidal zone (approx 1 m depth) and deeper waters (> 5 m depth), mostly likely due to the effects of wave action; thereafter communities do change with depth, but the effects are less pronounced. Biomass (p= 0. 049, significant) and seaweed diversity (p= 0. 078, not significant) were both shown to decrease, and % bare (seaweed-free) cover (p= 0. 002, significant) increased, with increasing depth. It is likely that these changes with increased depth {{can be attributed to the}} effects of increased light attenuation on ecological functioning in the subtidal communities.

40|$|Ecological {{communities}} that occupy similar habitats may exhibit functional convergence despite significant geographical distances and taxonomic dissimilarity. On coral reefs, steep gradients in key environmental variables (e. g. light and wave energy) restrict some species to shallow depths. We show that depth-generalist reef fishes are correlated with two species-level traits: caudal fin aspect ratio and diet. Fishes with high aspect ratio (lunate) caudal fins produce weaker vortices {{in the water}} column while swimming, and we propose that ‘silent swimming’ reduces the likelihood of detection and provides an advantage on deeper reefs with lower light irradiance and water motion. Significant differences in depth preference among trophic guilds reflect variations in the availability of different food sources <b>along</b> <b>a</b> <b>depth</b> gradient. The significance of these two traits across three geographically and taxonomically distinct assemblages suggests that deep-water habitats exert a strong environmental filter on coral reef-fish assemblages. 9 page(s...|$|E

The horizontal movements associated with this event, however, spread over wide areas in central Honshu. Simple dike intrusion models cannot explain these movements. To explain these, I hypothesize that a 20 cm of rapid slip occurred on the detachment {{at the time of this}} event. The abnormal crustal movements in the Tokai-central Honshu-Kanto region then started after the event. I propose that they represent delayed diffusive transfer of the slip on the detachment over surrounding low viscosity layers, such as nearby rupture zones of great earthquakes.|$|R
