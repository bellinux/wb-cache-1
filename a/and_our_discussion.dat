5000|$|A {{very common}} class of tales in Melanesia deals with cannibals and monsters, <b>and</b> <b>our</b> <b>discussion</b> {{of the general}} or more {{miscellaneous}} group of myths may well begin with examples of this type. As told by the Sulka, a Papuan tribe of New Britain, one of these stories runs as follows. Once there was a cannibal and his wife who had killed and eaten a great many persons, so that, fearing lest they should all be destroyed, the people resolved to abandon their village and seek safety in flight. Accordingly, they prepared their canoes, loaded all their property on board, and made ready to leave; but Tamus, {{one of the women}} of the village, was with child, whence the others refused to take her with them, saying that she would only be a burden upon the journey. She swam after them, however, and clung to the stem of one of the canoes, but they beat her off, compelling her to return to the deserted village and to live there alone. In due time she bore a son, and when he grew up a little, she would leave him in her hut while she went out to get food, warning him not to talk or laugh, lest the cannibals should hear and come and eat him. One day his mother left him a dracaena-plant as a plaything, and when she was gone he said to himself, [...] "What shall I make out of this, my brother or my cousin?" [...] Then he held the dracaena behind him, and presently it turned into a boy, with whom he played and talked. Resolving to conceal the presence of his new friend. Pupal, from his mother, he said to her on her return, [...] "Mother, I want to make a partition in our house; then you can live on one side, and I will live on the other" [...] and this he did, concealing Pupal in his portion of the house. From time to time his mother thought that she heard her son talking to someone and was surprised at the quantity of food and drink he required; but though she often asked him if he was alone, he always declared that he was. At last one day she discovered Pupal and then learned how he had come from the dracaena. She was glad that her son now had a companion, and all three lived happily together.|$|E

30|$|Perceived age {{is likely}} to be a {{possible}} confounding variable. Mathes et al. (1985) identified a negative relationship between the age and attractiveness of female faces, regardless of the gender or age of the raters. This correlation of attractiveness of female faces with perceived youth has been confirmed by subsequent studies (Tatarunaite et al. 2005) and a relationship between cuteness and infancy has even been found in the faces of children (Volk et al. 2007). Baby schema features in adult faces may affect attractiveness indirectly through perceived youth. We therefore investigated how perceived age affects attractiveness, beauty, and cuteness. Notably however, we only used images of young adults to reduce the effect of actual age, <b>and</b> <b>our</b> <b>discussion</b> on perceived age may not be extended to the general conclusion.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, we analyse {{the complex}} {{interaction}} between professional advisors and their clients. Our {{aim is to}} summarize and critically review the relevant literature and to outline major directions for future research. There are three competing models that discuss the interaction between professional service providers and their clients: the expert model, the ‘reflective practitioner ’ model and the critical model. After reviewing assumptions underlying these approaches {{as well as their}} contributions and shortcomings, we suggest that the key problem with these models is that they offer only partial insights into the relationship between clients and professional business service providers. Additionally, they have different epistemological foundations and, as such, they are incompatible. Building upon the existing research <b>and</b> <b>our</b> <b>discussion,</b> we outline the major issues of client-consultant interaction that future research need...|$|E
40|$|Traditional {{education}} of literature would do injustice to {{both students and}} the discipline {{in this age of}} globalization.

40|$|Abstract. Dynamic {{analysis}} of structure of rock-soil material is a difficulty in structure {{analysis of}} rock-soil material. Dynamic analysis referred here {{is equivalent to}} plasticity analysis in classical elasticity/plasticity theory. But, for the structure of rock-soil material, the granules form a structure {{in the form of}} network, which makes dynamic analysis especially complex. We attempt to simplify granular form in this study, and construct a Markov model of structural evolution of system according to finite connection modalities between granules. Connection modality distributions for each structural state are obtained using recursion technique. Next, depending on connection modality distribution, we obtain the mechanical and geometric parameters of the system, thus stiffness-strength-displacement relation can be established. This relation serves as the basis for building dynamic constitutive relationship for rock-soil material. Literature on relevant subjects has been rarely found so far, <b>and</b> <b>our</b> <b>discussion</b> is only a tentative exploration...|$|E
