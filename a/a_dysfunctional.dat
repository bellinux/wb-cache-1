5|$|Although Enron's {{compensation}} and performance management system {{was designed to}} retain and reward its most valuable employees, the system contributed to <b>a</b> <b>dysfunctional</b> corporate culture that became obsessed with short-term earnings to maximize bonuses.

5|$|After {{continuing}} {{to search for}} acting work, in 1987, Cartwright auditioned for a role {{in a series of}} animated shorts about <b>a</b> <b>dysfunctional</b> family that was to appear on The Tracey Ullman Show.

The first chapter of the book details Cartwright's life and career prior to 1987. In the second chapter, Cartwright recalls the day she went to audition for a role {{in a series of}} animated shorts on The Tracey Ullman Show.
