The current flag is a modification of the 1951 flag used while the country was a republic of the Soviet Union. In the Soviet version, <b>a</b> <b>hammer</b> and sickle was placed near the top-hoist corner and the ornament colors were inverted. Several flags used by government officials and agencies {{were based on the}} {{national flag}}.|$|E

25|$|Some hand axes {{were formed}} with <b>a</b> hard <b>hammer</b> and {{finished}} with <b>a</b> soft <b>hammer.</b> Blows that result in deep conchoidal fractures (the first phase of manufacture) can be distinguished from features resulting from sharpening with <b>a</b> soft <b>hammer.</b> The latter leaves shallower, more distended, broader scars sometimes with small, multiple shock waves. However, marks left <b>a</b> small hard <b>hammer</b> can leave similar marks to <b>a</b> soft <b>hammer.</b>|$|R

5|$|When {{you throw}} a {{cat in the}} oven, it's easy to have someone in the {{orchestra}} slam <b>a</b> <b>hammer</b> down on an anvil, scaring {{the hell out of}} everyone. The hard part is manipulating the story and accenting the characters. In the beginning, when Todd is laying down the rules, there's a certain repetitive thematic idea you hear. You hear the same music when Dussander is turning the tables on Todd, which makes you remember the first scene... You hope people are subliminally making the connection that the tables are turning back and forth.|$|E

Hamm made a plea deal and completed probation under the terms of a deferred adjudication; the charges were dismissed during August 1995.|$|E
5|$|At street level, three arched entranceways line Broad Street. The central arch is {{slightly}} larger than the others to indicate {{the entrance to the}} main banking hall. Carved into the facade above the center arch is the building's name. Inside the arches and above the doorways are windows designed by d'Ascenzo Studios. Leaded panes of glass of various shades of amber are surrounded by a Renaissance-style border. Below the windows are bronze doors, each with 24 high-relief panels depicting the history of commerce and civilization. Bas-relief figures decorate each of the arches' spandrels. A male figure with <b>a</b> <b>hammer</b> representing industry and a female figure with a beehive representing thrift decorate the center arch. The arch closest to Sansom Street is decorated by two figures with cornucopias to represent abundance. The arch nearer to Walnut Street is decorated by a painter and a sculptor to represent art.|$|E

5|$|Before 1951, several {{different}} flags {{had been in}} use since the Revolution. The earliest flag was plain red, and was used in 1919 during {{the existence of the}} Lithuanian-Byelorussian SSR. After the formation of the Byelorussian SSR, the lettering ССРБ (SSRB) was added in gold to the top hoist. This design was established {{with the passage of the}} first Constitution of the Byelorussian SSR. It was later modified in the 1927 Constitution where the letters were changed to БССР (BSSR) but kept the overall design the same. This design was changed in 1937, when <b>a</b> <b>hammer</b> and sickle and red star were placed above the letters. The flag dimensions were also formally established as 1:2 for the first time. This flag remained in use until the adoption of the 1951 flag, which did away with the letters.|$|E
5|$|Clock {{towers in}} Western Europe in the Middle Ages were also {{sometimes}} striking clocks. The most famous original still standing is possibly St Mark's Clock {{on the top}} of St Mark's Clocktower in St Mark's Square in Venice, assembled in 1493 by the clockmaker Gian Carlo Rainieri from Reggio Emilia. In 1497, Simone Campanato moulded the great bell on which every definite time-lapse is beaten by two mechanical bronze statues (h. 2,60 m.) called Due Mori (Two Moors), handling <b>a</b> <b>hammer.</b> Possibly earlier (1490) is the Prague Astronomical Clock by clockmaster Jan Růže (also called Hanuš) – according to another source this device was assembled as early as 1410 by clockmaker Mikuláš of Kadaň and mathematician Jan Šindel. The allegorical parade of animated sculptures rings on the hour every day.|$|E

5|$|Competitive video gamers and referees {{stress the}} game's {{high level of}} {{difficulty}} compared to other classic arcade games. Winning the game requires patience {{and the ability to}} accurately time Mario's ascent. In addition to presenting the goal of saving Pauline, the game also gives the player a score. Points are awarded for the following: leaping over obstacles; destroying objects with <b>a</b> <b>hammer</b> power-up; collecting items such as hats, parasols, and purses (presumably belonging to Pauline); removing rivets from platforms; and completing each stage (determined by a steadily decreasing bonus counter). The player typically receives three lives with a bonus awarded for the first 7,000 points, although this can be modified via the game's built in DIP switches. One life is lost whenever Mario touches Donkey Kong or any enemy object, falls too far through a gap or off the end of a platform, or lets the bonus counter reach zero.|$|E
5|$|George Orwell's book The Road to Wigan Pier was {{illustrated}} by {{a photograph of}} homes in the Rosehall area of Coatbridge. In 1934 there was an exodus to Corby in England when the local Union Plant relocated. This {{had the effect of}} <b>a</b> <b>hammer</b> blow impact on the town's iron industry and ushered in the end of serious iron production. The decline of the Clydeside shipbuilding industry in the 1950s meant the demand for iron finally collapsed. A legacy of 'devastating' unemployment, appalling housing conditions and some of the worst overcrowding in Scotland left its stamp on the Coatbridge of the early 1930s. As late as 1936 Coatbridge was the most overcrowded place in Scotland.|$|E
5|$|In 1995, Tomás Eloy Martínez {{published}} Santa Evita, a fictionalized work propounding {{many new}} {{stories about the}} escapades of the corpse. Allegations that her body was the object of inappropriate attentions are derived from his description of an 'emotional necrophilia' by embalmers, Coronel Koenig and his assistant Arancibia. Many primary and secondary references to his novel have inaccurately stated that her body had been defiled in some way resulting in the widespread belief in this myth. Also included are allegations that many wax copies had been made, that the corpse had been damaged with <b>a</b> <b>hammer,</b> {{and that one of}} the wax copies was the object of an officer's sexual attentions.|$|E
