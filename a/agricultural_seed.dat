5|$|Louche: The louche (耬車) was {{a mobile}} animal-drawn <b>agricultural</b> <b>seed</b> drill invented by the Chinese agronomist Zhao Guo, a Han {{official}} {{in charge of}} agricultural production {{during the reign of}} Han Wudi in the Han dynasty. According to the records of Political Commentator by the Eastern Han dynasty writer Cui Shi, the Louche consisted of three feet and thus was called three-legged Lou. The three legs had three ditch diggers under it used for sowing. The Louche was animal powered and was pulled by an ox and the leg of the Louche directly dug a ditch in the flattened soil, sowed the seeds, covered the seeds, and pressed the land flat at the same time. The machine was known for its utility and efficiency for serving several agricultural uses at the same time, while saving time and effort.|$|E

50|$|Many of Monsanto's <b>agricultural</b> <b>seed</b> {{products}} are genetically modified, such as for resistance to herbicides, including glyphosate and dicamba. Monsanto calls glyphosate-tolerant seeds Roundup Ready. Monsanto's introduction {{of this system}} (planting glyphosate-resistant seed and then applying glyphosate once plants emerged) allowed farmers to increase yield by planting rows closer together. Without it, farmers had to plant rows far enough apart to allow the control of post-emergent weeds with mechanical tillage. Farmers widely adopted the technology - for example over 80% of maize (Mon 832), soybean (MON-Ø4Ø32-6), cotton, sugar beet and canola planted in the United States are glyphosate-tolerant. Monsanto developed a Roundup Ready genetically modified wheat (MON 71800) but ended development in 2004 due to concerns from wheat exporters about rejection of GM wheat by foreign markets.|$|E

50|$|The {{foundations}} for the inspection services were {{laid in the}} late nineteenth century when a growing demand became apparent for safeguards regarding the quality of propagating material and seed. This need resulted in several inspection initiatives. In 1919 the Central Committee for the Inspection of Plants was established, followed by the Inspection Institute for Seeds and Planting Materials. Both organisations competed in their seed inspection activities. The establishment in 1932 of the Netherlands General Inspection Service for <b>Agricultural</b> <b>Seeds</b> and Seed Potatoes (NAK) signalled the end of the confusion. From then on, the inspection of agricultural crops was centralised. The first merger was between the then Netherlands General Inspection Service for Arboricultural Crops (NAKB) (1941) and the Netherlands General Inspection Service for Floricultural Crops (NAKS) (1947). This resulted in the creation of the NAKB. In 2000 the new NAKB and NAKG (the Netherlands General Inspection Service for Vegetable and Flower Seeds, 1941) merged to form the current Naktuinbouw.|$|R
