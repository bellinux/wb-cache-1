The reason for the failure was not determined by the Board of Inquiry (BoI), but it was suggested by an <b>accident</b> <b>investigator</b> called in by Rolls Royce that the main cause was that the pilot, upon performing the planned aerobatic display, exceeded the prototype's briefed speed and turning rate limits.|$|E

25|$|On 1 June 2005 it was {{announced}} that an inquest into the crash would be held at the Guildhall in Windsor, Berkshire. The inquest was expected to last 12 days, starting on 17 October 2005. A delay ensued over whether {{the families of the victims}} should be granted legal aid. The inquest finally began in October 2007. A policeman who had witnessed the crash, PC Brazier, testified at the inquest. He told the jury that he believed the crash was caused by a suicide attempt. The Forensic <b>Accident</b> <b>Investigator,</b> David Price, told the inquest that he had been able to determine that the car had been parked on the level crossing with its engine switched off, the handbrake fully applied, the vehicle's lights switched off, the steering on a partial left-hand turn (which was not consistent with driving across the crossing), and that its fuel tank still contained at least 8 litres (about 2 gallons) of petrol.|$|E

40|$|The Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI) was {{administered}} and scored for 154 Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) employees kom the US Department of Labor. These employees serve as <b>accident</b> <b>investigators</b> for serious <b>accidents</b> and fatalities {{as part of}} their job duties. During a workshop on stress designed for them, subjects volunteered anonymous written anecdotes, confirming and illustrating the findings. The subjects represented locations across the USA and all mining commodities: coal, metal, non-metal, stone, and sand and gravel. The Maslach Burnout Inventory assesses three aspects of experienced burnout: emotional exhaustion, depersonalisation, and reduced personal accomplishments. The average results of the scores {{for each of the three}} subscales for the study group of MSHA <b>accident</b> <b>investigators</b> fell in the moderate range. These scores show that the subject population was at some risk for emotional exhaustion and depersonalisation, tending toward burnout. The group evidenced a lower sense of personal accomplishment in their jobs, indicating a higher risk for burnout. From this outcome <b>accident</b> <b>investigators</b> may be at moderate (note: this does not mean average) risk for burnout. The authors recommend follow-up with this population - specifically in training to work with grieving families; and greater organisational support for the <b>accident</b> <b>investigators</b> in this area would be appropriate.

In McIntyre's expert opinion, at least 12minutes elapsed between the impact of the shrapnel and the crash of the plane, and the passengers remained conscious throughout.", 60 F.3d 90 (2d Cir. 1995) (decision from the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit Nos. 907, 1057 August Term, 1994 (Argued: April 5, 1995 Decided: July 12, 1995, Docket Nos. 94–7208, 94–7218).|$|E
