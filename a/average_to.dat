5|$|Although {{meteorologist}} David Roth {{assessed the}} storm as making landfall on August19 at Isle Dernière {{to the west}} of New Orleans, a research paper from the American Meteorological Society estimated that the hurricane moved ashore about 40mi (60km) southeast of New Orleans. Modern research suggests the storm was the equivalent of a major hurricane (a Category3 on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale), or with winds of at least , when it made landfall. It passed just southwest of the city, becoming the closest major hurricane to New Orleans. The wind diameter was <b>average</b> <b>to</b> slightly below-average, and the forward speed was normal. Due to its movement, the hurricane likely maintained much of its strength after making landfall and by the time it affected New Orleans. The hurricane gradually weakened over land, passing near Baton Rouge, Louisiana and Natchez, Mississippi on August20. Heavy rainfall was reported in eastern Ohio beginning on August21, potentially from the remnants of the storm merging with a cold front.|$|E

5|$|Météo-France issued their {{seasonal}} {{forecast of}} cyclone activity for the basin on November 12. MFR predicted a slightly below <b>average</b> <b>to</b> average season, citing {{the effects of}} a very strong El Niño event. Compared to an average of ten moderate tropical storms that usually form in the South-West Indian Ocean, a 70% chance was given to the probability of six to ten named storms forming. A 20% chance was given to the formation of only five cyclones or less, and a 10% was given to an above average level of activity. MRF expected that an above average number of named storms would develop in the central region of the basin (from 60°E to 77°E), and that there would be lower than average activity to the east of 77°E. Activity near normal was expected west of 60°E. MFR also predicted that the motion of cyclones during the season would have a stronger meridional component than normal, having a tendency to track south quickly.|$|E
