40|$|Background: A {{reliable}} and valid method for the automatic in situ measurement of hearing thresholds {{is a prerequisite for}} the feasibility of a self-fitting hearing aid, whether such a device becomes an automated component of an audiological management program or is fitted by the user independently of a clinician. Issues that must be addressed before implementation of the procedure into a self-fitting hearing aid include the role of real-ear-to-dial difference correction factors in ensuring accurate results and the ability of potential users to successfully self-direct the procedure. Purpose: The {{purpose of this study was}} to evaluate the reliability and validity of an <b>automatic</b> <b>audiometry</b> algorithm that is fully implemented in a wearable hearing aid, to determine to what extent reliability and validity are affected when the procedure is self-directed by the user, and to investigate contributors to a successful outcome. Research Design: Design was a two-phase correlational study. Study Sample: A total of 60 adults with mild to moderately severe hearing loss participated in both studies: 20 in Study 1 and 40 in Study 2. Twenty-seven participants in Study 2 attended with a partner. Participants in both phases were selected for inclusion if their thresholds were within the output limitations of the test device. Data Collection and Analysis: In both phases, participants performed <b>automatic</b> <b>audiometry</b> through a receiver-in-canal, behind-the-ear hearing aid coupled to an open dome. In Study 1, the experimenter directed the task. In Study 2, participants followed a set of written, illustrated instructions to perform <b>automatic</b> <b>audiometry</b> independently of the experimenter, with optional assistance from a lay partner. Standardized measures of hearing aid self-efficacy, locus of control, cognitive function, health literacy, and manual dexterity were administered. Statistical analysis examined the repeatability of automatic audiometry; the match between automatically and manually measured thresholds; and contributors to successful, independent completion of the <b>automatic</b> <b>audiometry</b> procedure. Results: When the procedure was directed by an audiologist, <b>automatic</b> <b>audiometry</b> yielded {{reliable and}} valid thresholds. Reliability and validity were negatively affected when the procedure was self-directed by the user, but the results were still clinically acceptable: test-retest correspondence was 10 dB or lower in 97 % of cases, and 91 % of automatic thresholds were within 10 dB of their manual counterparts. However, only 58 % of participants were able to achieve a complete audiogram in both ears. Cognitive function significantly influenced accurate and independent performance of the <b>automatic</b> <b>audiometry</b> procedure; accuracy was further affected by locus of control and level of education. Several characteristics of the <b>automatic</b> <b>audiometry</b> algorithm played an additional role in the outcome. Conclusions: Average transducer- and coupling-specific correction factors are sufficient for a self-directed in situ audiometry procedure to yield clinically {{reliable and valid}} hearing thresholds. Before implementation in a self-fitting hearing aid, however, the algorithm and test instructions should be refined in an effort to increase the proportion of users who are able to achieve complete audiometric results. Further evaluation of the procedure, particularly among populations likely to form the primary audience of a self-fitting hearing aid, should be undertaken. 14 page(s...|$|E
40|$|A {{study was}} made to {{determine}} the reliability of Navajo Indian and American Caucasian subjects to air conducted pure tones. Audiograms were obtained on 30 Navajo and 27 Caucasian subjects as they responded to pure tones presented via a conventional audiometric technique and also via an automatic recording technique. One audiogram via conventional audiometry and one audiogram via <b>automatic</b> <b>audiometry</b> were obtained on the same day. Replications of the same tests were administered on the following day. Statistical {{analysis of the data}} was employed to determine the reliability of repeated test measurements. Mean threshold differences, standard deviations, Student 2 ̆ 7 s 2 ̆ 2 t 2 ̆ 2 test and analysis of variance were all utilized in making these determinations. The test results revealed the reliability to be beyond acceptable limits, according to previous research, under all test conditions except condition one. Statistical significance was demonstrated at all four conditions. Significant differences between performance of the two populations involved were not shown. However, differences due to changing conditions were demonstrated...|$|E
40|$|Audioscan <b>automatic</b> <b>audiometry</b> {{is a high}} {{resolution}} method to explore hearing thresholds in the 125 Hz- 16 KHz range offering a resolution of 64 points per octave. This procedure {{makes it possible to}} study hearing threshold levels at intermediate frequencies which are not measured by conventional audiometry. As suggested in the literature, it is possible to identify hearing threshold notches, considered indicators of mild or subclinical cochlear pathology. In clinical practice, the use of a new audiometric technique requires affirmation of reliability, sensitivity and replicability in time. It also requires defining standard criteria for use in various otologic pathologies. The present study examined 50 normal hearing subjects with conventional audiometry and Audioscan (Essilor model) measurements. A standard acquisition protocol was followed where three Audioscan measurements were conducted per subject. Subjects with a history of acute otologic pathology and familiarity for genetic deafness were ruled out of the study. Multiple, pairwise correlation analyses of the audiometric and Audioscan responses indicate that: (1) there are no significant differences between threshold levels measured by Audioscan and conventional audiometry; (2) there are no significant variations in the hearing levels measured by three Audioscan retests. Three mean indicators of the threshold level have been defined, expressing Audioscan normality in three different frequency ranges. The data suggest that there are some difficulties in the subjectivity of the Audioscan method and some technical problems regarding the lower octave frequencies and these need to be addressed. The results obtained in this study confirmed reliability of the Audioscan in the mid and high frequencies. The definition of the standard mi criteria makes it easier to interpret the Audioscan measurements from cases presenting various otologic pathologies. Therefore, the plasticity and high detection sensitivity of hearing loss make the automatic Audioscan audiometry a useful clinical tool for diagnostic and/or preventive purposes...|$|E
40|$|Objectives: The primary {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to determine whether a combination of automatically administered pure-tone audiometry and a tone-in-noise detection task, both delivered via an air conduction (AC) pathway, could reliably and validly predict the presence of a conductive component to the hearing loss. The authors hypothesized that performance on the battery of tests would vary according to hearing loss type. A secondary objective was to evaluate the reliability and validity of a novel <b>automatic</b> <b>audiometry</b> algorithm to assess its suitability for inclusion in the test battery. Design: Participants underwent a series of hearing assessments that were conducted in a randomized order: manual pure-tone air conduction audiometry and bone conduction audiometry; automatic pure-tone air conduction audiometry; and an automatic tone-in-noise detection task. The automatic tests were each administered twice. The ability of the automatic test battery to: (a) predict the presence of an air–bone gap (ABG); and (b) accurately measure AC hearing thresholds was assessed against the results of manual audiometry. Test–retest conditions were compared to determine the reliability of each component of the automatic test battery. Data were collected on 120 ears from normal-hearing and conductive, sensorineural, and mixed hearing-loss subgroups. Results: Performance differences between different types of hearing loss were observed. Ears with a conductive component (conductive and mixed ears) tended to have normal signal to noise ratios (SNR) despite impaired thresholds in quiet, while ears without a conductive component (normal and sensorineural ears) demonstrated, on average, an increasing relationship between their thresholds in quiet and their achieved SNR. Using the relationship between these two measures among ears with no conductive component as a benchmark, the likelihood that an ear has a conductive component can be estimated based on the deviation from this benchmark. The sensitivity and specificity of the test battery vary depending on the size of this deviation, but increase with increasing ABG size, with decreasing test frequency, and when results from multiple test frequencies are taken into account. The individual automatic tests comprising the battery were found to be reliable and valid, with strong, significant correlations between the test and retest results (r = 0. 81 to 0. 99; p < 0. 0001) and between automatic and manual audiometry procedures (r = 0. 98 to 0. 99; p < 0. 0001). Conclusions: The presence of an ABG can be predicted with a reasonably high degree of accuracy using AC tests alone. Applications of such a test battery include any clinical context in which bone conduction audiometry or specialized diagnostic equipment is unavailable or impractical. Examples of these include self-fitting hearing aids, whose efficacy relies on the ability of the device to automatically administer an in situ hearing test; self-administered adult hearing screenings in both clinical and home environments; large-scale industrial hearing conservation programs; and test environments in which ambient noise levels exceed the maximum permissible levels for unoccluded ears. 8 page(s...|$|E
40|$|For {{the purpose}} of {{carrying}} on studies on presbycusis from clinical standpoint the author conducted precise examinations of 137 cases over 40 years old visiting the Okayama National Hospital by conducting various systemic examinations, audiometry, electroencephalogram and <b>automatic</b> <b>audiometry</b> in some. In the pilot study, by classifying the hearing-loss into five new steps and by pursuing {{the relationship between the}} hearing in old age and various functions of different organs, the author odtained the following results. 1. The majority of hearing-loss show high tone-loss, and in the age range of forty and fifty years the disorders are more frequeutly of a mild degree, showing no marked difference in the two groups. However, in the age over 60 years these disorders increase in intensity and iu the age over 70 years this tends to become quite marked. 2. The aortensclerosis (as revealed by roentgenograms), urine protein content, and arteriosclerosis of retina are more frequently pathological along with the progress of hearing-loss clinicaly suggesting the relationship between the hearing disorders in old age and arteriosclerosis. 3. No relationship can be recognized between the hearing-loss and snch findings as the systemic blood pressures, blood pressure of fundus, the ratio detween the systemic blood pressure and that of fundus, cold pressure test, renal function, urine sugar content, heart muscle disturbances as revealed by electrocardiogram and hypertensive changes in the fundus, 4. The majority of the hearing type belong to abrupt type of high tone-loss, followed in the descending order of gradual type, horizontal type and dip type. In the age over 60 years the gradual type tends to increase as compared with the age range in forty and fifty years. In examining 38 cases with presbycusis out of those examined in the part Ⅰ by means of automatic audiometer, the author studied mainly the amplitude in the automatic audiogram, and odtained the following results. Moreover, the classification of the amplitude in the 26 ears of normal adults is divided into the amplitude decreasing type under 4 db, normal type between 5 db to 17 db, and the amplitude increasing type over 18 db. 1. Those showing the amplitude decreasing type amounted to 23 cases (60. 5 %); normal type 12 cases (31. 5 %); and the amplitude increasing type 3 cases (7. 9 %); and the majority of the amplitude decreasing type showed the decrease in the high tone area. 2. The amplitude decreasing type was found mostly in those with mild disorders, and it decreased along with the progress in hearing disorders. 3. The amplitude decreasing type was found mostly in high: while the increasing type in the abrupt type of high-tone-loss, gradual type and in the horirizontal type. 4. The amplitude decreasing type decreased, though slightly, along with the advance in age. 5. The tinnitus had no special association with the amplitude in the audiogram. 6. The amplitude decreasing type decreased along with the advance in the degrees of arteriosclerosis of retina and hypertensive changes. In the electroencephalographic examinations of 130 cases previously mentioned in the Part Ⅰ, the author studied the relationship between the electroencephalogram and the hearing in old age, and obtained the following results: 1. (Irregularity in) the wave legnth and the amplitude of α-wave as well as the breakdown in the wave fomation are revealed more markedly along with the advance in the hearingloss. 2. Of the abnormal waves, slow wave and spike appear in a direct proportion to the degree of hearing-loss. 3. As the hearing-loss in the age range of forty and fifty years are milder, the same holds true of the changes in electroencephalogram in the majority of cases. In the age range over sixty years both tend to be more marked. 4. Most of those belonging to the amplitude decreasing type reveal a milder degree of electroencephalographic changes...|$|E
