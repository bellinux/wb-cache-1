25|$|For {{positive}} real x, y and s, x'y/y → 0, when (x, y) → (0, s). This {{seems to}} justify setting γ(s, 0) = 0 for real s > 0. However, matters are somewhat {{different in the}} complex realm. Only if (a) the real part of s is positive, and (b) values u'v are taken from just a finite set of branches, they <b>are</b> <b>guaranteed</b> <b>to</b> converge to zero as (u, v) → (0, s), and so does γ(u, v). On a single branch of γ(b) is naturally fulfilled, so there γ(s, 0) = 0 for s with positive real part is a continuous limit. Also note that such a continuation {{is by no means}} an analytic one.|$|E
25|$|A player's ranking {{points for}} an event {{must be at least}} 1.2. Players who would get less than this using the above formula get no ranking points. For example, if an event has a ranking of 10 only the leading 12 players (and ties) receive any ranking points since the player in 12th place gets 12% of the event ranking (i.e. 1.2). The player in 13th {{position}} gets no points. Where there is a tie for the final scoring place, those players <b>are</b> <b>guaranteed</b> <b>to</b> receive at least 1.2 points. Using the above example, if there were two or more players tied for 12th place, each would receive 1.2 points. The only exceptions to this system are in the major championships where all players who make the cut get a minimum of 1.5 ranking points.|$|E
25|$|Since the {{inception}} of the second division in 1999, promotion and relegation follow a pattern similar to the European leagues, where the two bottom clubs of J1 and the top two clubs of J2 <b>are</b> <b>guaranteed</b> <b>to</b> move. From the 2004 to 2008 season, the third-placed J2 club entered the Promotion / Relegation Series against the sixteenth-placed J1 club and the winner had a right to play in the top flight in the following year. Starting on the 2009 season, the top three J2 clubs receives J1 promotion by default in place of three bottom J1 clubs. However, promotion or right to play the now-defunct pro/rel series relies on the J2 clubs meeting the requirements for J1 franchise status set by the league. This has generally not been a hindrance, in fact, no club is yet to be denied promotion due to not meeting the J1 criteria.|$|E

25|$|The variable-opt {{method is}} related to, and a {{generalization}} of the k-opt method. Whereas the k-opt methods remove a fixed number (k) of edges {{from the original}} tour, the variable-opt methods do not fix {{the size of the}} edge set to remove. Instead they grow the set as the search process continues. The best known method in this family is the Lin–Kernighan method (mentioned above as a misnomer for 2-opt). Shen Lin and Brian Kernighan first published their method in 1972, and it was the most reliable heuristic for solving travelling salesman problems for nearly two decades. More advanced variable-opt methods were developed at Bell Labs in the late 1980s by David Johnson and his research team. These methods (sometimes called Lin–Kernighan–Johnson) build on the Lin–Kernighan method, adding ideas from tabu search and evolutionary computing. The basic Lin–Kernighan technique gives results that <b>are</b> <b>guaranteed</b> <b>to</b> be at least 3-opt. The Lin–Kernighan–Johnson methods compute a Lin–Kernighan tour, and then perturb the tour by what {{has been described as a}} mutation that removes at least four edges and reconnecting the tour in a different way, then V-opting the new tour. The mutation is often enough to move the tour from the local minimum identified by Lin–Kernighan. V-opt methods are widely considered the most powerful heuristics for the problem, and are able to address special cases, such as the Hamilton Cycle Problem and other non-metric TSPs that other heuristics fail on. For many years Lin–Kernighan–Johnson had identified optimal solutions for all TSPs where an optimal solution was known and had identified the best known solutions for all other TSPs on which the method had been tried.|$|E

500|$|Although no {{maximum length}} for an HDMI cable is specified, signal {{attenuation}} (dependent on the cable's construction quality and conducting materials) limits usable lengths {{in practice and}} certification is difficult to achieve for lengths beyond 13m. HDMI 1.3 defines two cable categories: Category 1-certified cables, which have been tested at 74.5MHz (which would include resolutions such as 720p60 and 1080i60), and Category 2-certified cables, which have been tested at 340MHz (which would include resolutions such as 1080p60 and 2160p30). Category 1 HDMI cables are marketed as [...] "Standard" [...] and Category 2 HDMI cables as [...] "High Speed". This labeling guideline for HDMI cables went into effect on October 17, 2008.

Even though jokes don't always land, there <b>are</b> <b>guaranteed</b> <b>to</b> {{be at least a}} few amusing moments per episode. The stylings haven't changed all that much. There are tasteful homages and cultural references, including loving parodies of classic movies, television, and literature [...] as usual, tons of famous guest stars lend their voices, some as themselves and others as fictional characters". Adam Rayner of WhatCulture wrote that [...] "Season thirteen represents a time when the show was clinging to the classic humour that was derived from situations that were rooted in a reality – albeit a heightened reality – which could happen to you and your family, while slowly descending into the surreal and farcical." [...] Matt Wheeldon of GoodFilmGuide said [...] "the 13th Season another solid, and fairly memorable, effort from the world’s best loved cartoon; even if it isn’t the be all and end all of Simpsons cartooning. DVD Talk's Ryan Keefer gave a season 3.5/5 stars and said [...] "While Jean might not have brought things to previous glory, he certainly righted the ship in Season 13." [...] Blu-Ray.com gave season 13 a 3.5/5 and Casey Broadwater's sentiment was [...] "The hit-to-miss ratio is much better here than in the previous three seasons, and while the episodes are never quite as hilarious as the Simpsons of old—from way back in the early 1990s—season 13 does mark a turning point for the series." [...] Ron Martin of 411 Mania was more critical giving the season a 6.5/10. Part of the verdict was [...] "Season 13 is representative of the chaotic scatterbrained nature the show would take on from here on out."
