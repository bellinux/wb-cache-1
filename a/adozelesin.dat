50|$|<b>Adozelesin</b> and {{bizelesin}} cause genomic DNA lesions by alkylating DNA. <b>Adozelesin</b> induces single-strand DNA lesions, whereas bizelesin induces both single-strand lesions and double-strand DNA cross-links. At equivalent cytotoxic concentrations, {{these agents}} caused different biological responses. Low <b>adozelesin</b> concentrations (e.g., 0.5 nM) induced a transient S-phase block and cell cycle arrest in G(2)-M, {{as well as}} increased induction of p53 and p21, whereas a high drug concentration (e.g., 2.5 nM) caused apoptosis but no p21 induction. In contrast, both low and high bizelesin concentrations enhanced p53 and p21 induction and triggered G(2)-M cell cycle arrest and eventual senescence without significant apoptotic cell death. However, in cells lacking p21, bizelesin, as well as <b>adozelesin,</b> triggered apoptosis, indicating that p21 was crucial to sustained bizelesin-induced G(2)-M arrest. Despite similar abilities to alkylate DNA, <b>adozelesin</b> and bizelesin caused a decrease in HCT116 tumor cell proliferation by different pathways.|$|E
50|$|<b>Adozelesin</b> is an alkylating minor groove DNA binder that {{is capable}} of rapidly {{inhibiting}} DNA replication in treated cells through a trans-acting mechanism and preferentially arrests cells in S phase. It has been shown previously that in cells treated with <b>adozelesin,</b> replication protein A (RPA) activity is deficient, and the middle subunit of RPA is hyperphosphorylated. The adozelesin-induced RPA hyperphosphorylation can be blocked by the replicative DNA polymerase inhibitor, aphidicolin, suggesting that adozelesin-triggered cellular DNA damage responses require active DNA replication forks. These data imply that cellular DNA damage responses to <b>adozelesin</b> treatment are preferentially induced in S phase.|$|E
50|$|The {{synthetic}} analogs of duocarmycins include <b>adozelesin,</b> bizelesin, and carzelesin. As {{members of}} the cyclopropylpyrroloindole family, these investigational drugs have progressed into clinical trials {{for the treatment of}} cancer.|$|E
50|$|<b>Adozelesin</b> is an {{experimental}} antitumor drug of the duocarmycin class. It binds to and alkylates DNA, {{resulting in a}} reduction of both cellular and simian virus 40 (SV40) DNA replication which ultimately reduces the rate of cancer growth.|$|E
50|$|Carzelesin (U-80244) is a cyclopropylpyrroloindole prodrug {{containing}} a relatively nonreactive chloromethyl {{precursor to the}} cyclopropyl function. Activation of carzelesin requires two steps, (a) hydrolysis of a phenylurethane substituent to form U-76073, followed by (b) ring closure to form the cyclopropyl-containing DNA-reactive U-76074. The formation of the DNA-reactive U-76074, via U-76073, from carzelesin was shown to proceed very slowly in phosphate-buffered saline (t1/2 greater than 24 h) but to occur rapidly in plasma from mouse, rat, dog, and human (initial t1/2 values ranging from 18 min for mouse to 52 min for rat) and in cell culture medium (t1/2 approximately 40 min). Although carzelesin was less potent in terms of in vitro cytotoxicity and in vivo optimal dosage and showed low affinity for binding to DNA, it was therapeutically more efficacious against mouse L1210 leukemia than was U-76074 or <b>adozelesin</b> (U-73975), another cyclopropylpyrroloindole analogue which is currently in phase I clinical trials. Carzelesin also {{proved to be more}} efficacious than U-76074 or <b>adozelesin</b> against mouse pancreatic ductal 02 adenocarcinoma, a system reported to be resistant to every agent tested. Carzelesin was highly effective against this tumor and produced 97% tumor growth inhibition. In addition, i.v. administered carzelesin showed significant activity (National Cancer Institute criteria) against i.v. or s.c. implanted Lewis lung carcinoma, i.p. or s.c. implanted B16 melanoma, s.c. implanted colon 38 carcinoma, and five s.c. implanted human tumor xenografts, including clear cell Caki-1 carcinoma, colon CX-1 adenocarcinoma, lung LX-1 tumor, ovarian 2780 carcinoma, and prostatic DU-145 carcinoma. Carzelesin treatment produced 100% complete remissions (no palpable tumor mass at the termination of the experiment) in mice bearing early-stage human ovarian 2780. Pharmacologically, carzelesin proved to be relatively schedule and route independent and was highly active against i.p. implanted L1210 leukemia, regardless of whether the analogue was given i.v., i.p., s.c., or p.o. These results, collectively, suggest that carzelesin is absorbed and distributed well. Both carzelesin and <b>adozelesin</b> caused marked tumor shrinkage in mice bearing human lung LX-1 or advanced-stage human ovarian 2780 carcinoma; however, tumor regrowth occurred shortly after the treatment with <b>adozelesin</b> was stopped. Little or no apparent tumor regrowth occurred after treatment with carzelesin.|$|E
50|$|The work of Dale L. Boger {{and others}} created a better {{understanding}} of the pharmacophore and mechanism of action of the duocarmycins. This research has led to synthetic analogs including <b>adozelesin,</b> bizelesin, and carzelesin which progressed into clinical trials for the treatment of cancer. Similar research that Boger utilized for comparison to his results involving elimination of cancerous tumors and antigens was centered around the use of similar immunoconjugates that were introduced to cancerous colon cells. These studies related to Boger's research involving antigen-specificity that is necessary to the success of the duocarmycins as antitumor treatments.|$|E

40|$|<b>Adozelesin</b> (formerly U 73 - 975, The Upjohn Co.) is a covalent, minor-groove binding {{analogue}} of the antitumour antibiotic (+) CC- 1065. <b>Adozelesin</b> {{consists of}} a cyclopropapyrroloindole alkylating sub-unit identical to (+) CC- 1065, plus indole and benzofuran sub-units which replace the more complex pyrroloindole B and C sub-units, respectively, of (+) CC- 1065. <b>Adozelesin</b> is a clinically important drug candidate, since it does not contain the ethylene bridge moieties on the B and C sub-units which {{are thought to be}} responsible for the unusual delayed hepatotoxicity exhibited by (+) CC- 1065. Sequencing techniques identified two consensus sequences for <b>adozelesin</b> binding as p(dA) and 5 '(T/A) (T/A) T-A*(C/G) G. This suggests that <b>adozelesin</b> spans a total of five base-pairs and shows a preference for A=T base-pair rich sequences, thus avoiding steric crowding around the exocyclic NH_ 2 of guanine and a wide minor groove. In this project, the covalent modification of two DNA sequences, i. e. 5 'd(CGTAAGCGCTTA*CG) _ 2 and 5 '-d(CGAAAAA*CGG) #centre dot# 5 '-d(CCGTTTTTCG), by <b>adozelesin</b> was examined by high-field NMR and restrained molecular mechanics and dynamics. Previous studies of minor groove binding drugs, using techniques as diverse as NMR, X-ray crystallography and molecular modelling, indicate that the incorporation of a guanine into the consensus sequence sterically hinders binding and, more importantly, produces a wider minor groove which is a 'slack' fit for the ligand. The aim of this investigation was to provide an insight into the sequence selective binding of <b>adozelesin</b> to 5 '-AAAAA*CG and 5 '-GCTTA*CG. The " 1 H NMR data revealed that, in both cases, #beta#-helical structure and Watson-Crick base-pairing was maintained on adduct formation. The 5 '-GCTTA*CG adduct displayed significant distortion of the guanine base on the non-covalently modified strand. This distortion resulted from an amalgamation of two factors. Firstly, the presence of a strong hydrogen-bond between the amide linker of the indole and benzofuran sub-units and the carbonyl of a central thymine base plus a second, weaker, hydrogen-bond to the exocyclic NH_ 2 of the guanine. Secondly, covalent modification of an adenine by <b>adozelesin</b> yields a distortional wave which terminates 6 base-pairs upstream in the 5 '-direction. " 1 H NMR data and the resulting molecular model show that <b>adozelesin</b> lies closer to the modified strand as a consequence of this strong hydrogen-bond and perhaps also of the distorted guanine pushing <b>adozelesin</b> to {{the opposite side of the}} groove. No distortion of this kind was noted in the 'A' tract model; however, the " 1 H NMR data shows that the adenine bases remain propeller twisted, which is characteristic of macroscopically bent DNA. This molecular model showed that, within this most preferred sequence, <b>adozelesin</b> lay centrally within this straighter 'A' tract, yielding an improved complementary fit of the drug within the DNA minor groove. No hydrogen-bonds were detected. This study indicates the possible role of the ureylene linker in the selective binding of <b>adozelesin</b> to the unpredicted GC-containing consensus sequence. Various other minor groove binders (cyanomorpholinoadriamycin, DSB- 120 and sibiromycin) also had their sequence-selectivity properties probed with limited success, owing to their inability to yield a single drug-DNA adduct for high-field NMR study. The adozelesin-DNA self-complementary adduct in this study has provided a new and exciting starting point for rational drug design of an <b>adozelesin</b> dimer, a proposed antineoplastic agent with enhanced sequence-selectivity. These adozelesin-DNA adducts have proved to be an excellent model system to investigate the molecular basis for DNA recognition and binding.

40|$|The highly conserved Cdc 6 {{protein is}} {{required}} for initiation of eukaryotic DNA replication and, in yeast and Xenopus, for the coupling of DNA replication to mitosis. Herein, we show that human Cdc 6 is rapidly destroyed by a p 53 -independent, proteasome-, and ubiquitin-dependent pathway during early stages of programmed cell death induced by the DNA-damaging drug <b>adozelesin,</b> or by a separate caspase-dependent pathway in cells undergoing apoptosis through an extrinsic pathway induced by tumor necrosis factor-α and cycloheximide. The proteasome-dependent pathway induced by <b>adozelesin</b> is conserved in the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The destruction of Cdc 6 may be a primordial programmed death response that uncouples DNA replication from the cell division cycle, which is reinforced in metazoans by the evolution of caspases and p 53...|$|E

By using a polymerase chain reaction approach, both compounds show selective binding to A + T rich sequences exactly as reference compound U- 71, 184. In in vitro assays, against L 1210 cell lines, both derivatives showed cytotoxicity in the pM range, values comparable with the natural target compound (+) -CC- 1065.

40|$|In this paper, we analyse the {{in vitro}} sequence-selectivity of two {{synthetic}} analogues of U- 71184 and <b>adozelesin</b> by {{polymerase chain reaction}} (PCR) performed on human genomic DNA. In addition, Dnase footprinting and nucleotide sequence analysis on arrested-PCR products were performed to confirm sequence-selective binding. Finally, the antitumor effects were studied in vitro on human leukemic L 1210 cells. The binding activity of the two newly synthesized compounds to human gene sequences was compared with the CC- 1065 analogue U- 71184, the A+T sequence-selective drug distamycin and the G+C sequence-selective drugs mithramycin and chromomycin. As molecular model systems for in vitro DNA-binding studies we used the human estrogen receptor gene and the Ha-ras oncogene. In some experiments the PCR approach was performed using as target DNA {{a portion of the}} long terminal repeat (LTR) of the human immunodeficiency type 1 virus (HIV- 1). These genomic regions contain sequences that are different with respect to A+T/G+C ratios, being the upstream sequence of the human estrogen receptor gene A+T rich, while the Ha-ras and HIV- 1 LTR sequences contain G+C–rich regions. The first conclusion that can be drawn from the experiments reported in our paper is that the two newly synthetized analogues of U- 71184 and <b>adozelesin</b> inhibit PCR-mediated amplification of genomic regions in a sequence-dependent manner.

40|$|Polyamides are a {{class of}} {{synthetic}} molecules that exhibit high-affinity, sequence-specific reversible binding in the DNA minor groove but are incapable of inducing DNA damage. In cell-free systems, polyamides {{have been shown to}} regulate gene expression by activation, repression, and antirepression. However, effectiveness in cell culture has met with limited success and seems to be cell-dependent. By combining a polyamide with a moiety of a DNA-alkylating agent of the cyclopropylpyrroloindole (CPI) family, a conjugate molecule [polyamide 1 -CBI (1 -(chloromethyl) - 5 -hydroxyl- 1, 2 -dihydro- 3 H-benz[e]indole) conjugate] capable of sequence-specific DNA alkylation was shown to exhibit cellular activity (i. e., cell-growth inhibition and cell-cycle arrest) in mammalian cells. These effects, however, occur at concentrations several orders of magnitude higher than those of its parent CPI agent <b>adozelesin.</b> In addition, 1 -CBI is able to interact sequence-specifically with viral DNA and inhibit SV 40 DNA replication in infected BSC- 1 (African green monkey kidney epithelial) cells, albeit at a greatly reduced ability compared with its CPI parent. On the basis of results from previous studies, we tested whether pretreatment of virus with 1 -CBI, compared with direct treatment of infected cells, would enhance its cellular activity. Therefore, using SV 40 virions as a model system, we examined the ability of this conjugate molecule to penetrate SV 40 virions and damage viral DNA. Our results demonstrate that 1 -CBI is able to damage encapsidated SV 40 DNA. Both DNA replication and virus production are effectively inhibited in a concentration-dependent manner after infection of BSC- 1 cells with 1 -CBI-pretreated virions. It is surprising that, unlike in mammalian cells, the relative activity of 1 -CBI in SV 40 virions is comparable with that of the highly cytotoxic CPI agent <b>adozelesin.</b> Because 1 -CBI is able to efficiently penetrate virions and damage DNA, these findings may provide the framework for the development of polyamide-based antiviral agents with enhanced sequence-preference capabilities...|$|E
40|$|Previous {{structural}} {{studies of}} the cyclopropapyrroloindole (CPI) antitumor antibiotics have shown that these ligands bind covalently edge-on into the minor groove of double-stranded DNA. Reversible covalent modification of the DNA via N 3 of adenine occurs in a sequence-specific fashion. Early nuclear magnetic resonance and molecular modeling studies with both mono- and bis-allcylating ligands indicated that the ligands fit tightly within the minor groove, causing little distortion of the helix. In this study, we propose a new binding model for several of the CPI-based analogues, in which the aromatic secondary rings form pi-stacked complexes within the minor groove. One of the adducts, formed with <b>adozelesin</b> and the d(ATTAAT) (2) sequence, also demonstrates the ability of these ligands to manipulate the DNA of the binding site, resulting in a Hoogsteen base-paired adduct. Although this type of base pairing has been previously observed with the bisfunctional CPI analogue bizelesin, {{this is the first}} time that such an observation has been made with a monoalkylating nondimeric analogue. Together, these results provide a new model for the design of CPI-based antitumor antibiotics, which also has a significant bearing on other structurally related and structurally unrelated minor groove-binding ligands. They indicate the dynamic nature of ligand DNA interactions, demonstrating both DNA conformational flexibility and the ability of two DNA-bound ligands to interact to form stable covalent modified complexes...|$|E
40|$|Consumption of the bracken fern Pteridium aquilinum by cattle {{has been}} shown to induce bladder and {{intestinal}} carcinomas in cattle and to cause a number of diseases in other farm animals. An unstable glucoside named ptaquiloside, containing a reactive cyclopropane ring, has been isolated from the fern and its potent carcinogenicity proven. Nineteen of 31 ferns tested by chemotaxonomic methods in Japan have been found to contain potentially carcinogenic ptaquilosides as have Cheilanthes sieberi and Pteridium esculentum. Hydrolysis of ptaquilosides leads to pterosins; under milder conditions a dienone which {{is believed to be the}} primary carcinogen is obtained. Hypacrone, a sesquiterpine containing a reactive cyclopropane ring, has been isolated from Hypolepis punctata and its structure proved by synthesis. Illudins, structurally similar to ptaquiloside, have been isolated from the basidiomycete Omphalotus illudens. These give anti-tumour activity and similar reactivity with nucleophiles to ptaquiloside. Compound CC- 1065, a highly toxic antibiotic also containing a cyclopropane ring, has been isolated from Streptomyces zelensis. The mechanism of its reactivity with DNA has been compared to that of ptaquiloside and the small structural differences between carcinogenic and anti-tumour activity discussed.

40|$|The pleiotrophic {{cellular}} {{response to}} DNA damage includes activation of cell cycle checkpoints, induction of DNA repair pathways, and initiation of {{programmed cell death}} among others. The fate of cells with damaged DNA depends on the coordination of these different responses. The clinical efficacy of genotoxic therapies is influenced by cell fate and thus by how the DNA damage response is coordinated. While a great deal has been learned about how different DNA lesions activate distinct cell cycle check-points and DNA repair pathways, less is known about whether the type of DNA lesion influences the qualitative and quantitative nature of the cell death response. To address this question, HCT 116 colon carcinoma cells have been treated with equally cytotoxic doses of the anti-tumor DNA alkylating agents <b>adozelesin</b> or bizelesin or the DNA strand scission agent C- 1027. The relative contribution of cell cycle arrest and cell death to measured cytotoxicity varied among the three drugs. Apoptotic cell death accounts for most C- 1027 cytotoxicity while cell cycle arrest and cell death both contribute to the cyto-toxicity of the alkylating agents. Each of the drugs induces a distinct but overlapping pattern of caspase activation. In addition, the cell death response to these drugs is differ-entially dependent on p 53 and p 21. These observations suggest {{that the type of}} DNA lesion influences not only the relative extent of apoptotic cell death at a given cyto-toxic dose but also the qualitative nature of that response.
