The front derailleur, however, switches gears almost 30% faster than Dura-Ace’s mechanical counterpart. On traditional bikes, the front derailleur is problematic because the chain can be under tension and has to make a large vertical jump between chainrings. The electronic system's controlled motion overcomes these problems. The Di2 can also trim the front derailleur to eliminate chain rub and calibrate itself to <b>adjust</b> <b>for</b> <b>wear</b> and tear.

50|$|Changing gear {{with the}} Wilson box {{relied on the}} control of the brake bands that held each epicyclic's annulus in fixed position. The brake band to be {{selected}} was controlled by a rotating cam, moved by the gear shift lever. Only one band was engaged for each gear selection. This small lever could not provide enough power to engage and lock the brake band, thus the need for the pedal The actual movement of the brake bands was controlled by the 'toggle' mechanism, a distinctive feature of the Wilson design. When the pedal was pressed and released, a series or 'busbar' of finger-like levers were pressed upwards by a strong coil spring, against a series of light linkages or 'operating struts'. The position of each linkage was controlled by the gear selection camshaft. If the cam (for each gear) held the linkage in place, rather than allowing it to swing out of the way, the busbar finger would then press, via the operating strut, onto the toggles controlling the brake bands themselves. These toggles provided the additional leverage necessary to hold the brake band in place, under the force of the coil spring, until the pedal was next pressed. A further characteristic of the Wilson design was the use of self-adjusting nuts on each band, to compensate for wear. The action of engaging and disengaging each band was sufficient to advance the ratchet nuts and so <b>adjust</b> <b>for</b> <b>wear</b> by taking up any slack.|$|E

40|$|Objective: To {{evaluate}} {{the relationship between}} physical activity (PA, min/school-day) at school and body mass index (BMI, kg/m 2) among rural elementary-aged children. Methods: Height (cm), weight (kg), and PA were measured for 1767 children (5 – 12  years) enrolled in six rural Oregon elementary schools in fall, 2013. PA at school was measured over four days using Walk 4 Life pedometers. Children with ≥ 3 valid monitoring days (n =  1482) were included in analyses. Means (min/d) were calculated <b>for</b> <b>wear</b> time, total PA (TPA: combined light, moderate, vigorous PA), and moderate to vigorous PA (MVPA: step count >  120 /min). BMI z-scores were calculated and regression models were run {{to examine the relationship}} between PA and BMI z-scores, <b>adjusting</b> <b>for</b> <b>wear</b> time, sex, and grade. Results: Overweight (38. 1 %: BMI ≥  85 th percentile for age and sex) and obesity (19. 4 %: BMI ≥  95 th percentile) prevalence was similar for boys (n =  782) and girls (n =  700).

40|$|Background: Sedentary {{behavior}} {{is associated with}} increased risk of chronic disease and sedentary {{behavior is}} increasing among adolescents. Data on changes in sedentary behavior in developing countries are limited. Purpose: To describe 5 -year longitudinal changes in nonschool sedentary hours among urban adolescents in Ho Chi Minh City, and to identify correlates with this change. Methods: This is a 5 -year longitudinal cohort with systematic random sampling of 759 students from 18 junior high schools. All measures were taken annually between 2004 and 2009. Sedentary behavior was assessed by self-report and accelerometry. Generalized linear latent and mixed models were {{used to analyze the}} data in 2011. Results: Between 2004 and 2009, self-reported time spent in nonschool sedentary behavior increased from 498 to 603 minutes/day. In the 5 th survey year, boys and girls (aged 16 years) were, respectively, 3. 6 times (95 % CI= 2. 3, 6. 0) and 3. 1 times (95 % CI= 1. 8, 5. 0) more likely to spend ≥ 2 hours/day on screen time compared with baseline (aged 12 years).

40|$|Introduction. Childhood {{obesity is}} a {{worldwide}} epidemic, caused {{in large part}} by insufficient physical activity (PA). The majority of children in the United States are not meeting PA guidelines. As PA is inversely associated with weight status, interventions aiming to increase preschoolers’ individual PA levels have proven effective in reducing body mass index (BMI) and preventing the development of childhood obesity. Research suggests PA interventions in preschoolers are more effective when parents are involved. Purpose. The {{purpose of this study was}} to examine the impact of a parental modeling PA intervention on children’s PA levels and weight status as measured by BMI. It was hypothesized that the intervention would result in increased PA levels for children and help them to maintain or decrease their BMI. Methods. This study included 23 parent-child dyads, each randomly placed into either a control (n= 8) or intervention (n= 15) group. In the children, height and weight were measured and BMI and BMI z-scores were calculated pre- and post-intervention. The children also wore an ActiGraph activity monitor for one week pre- and post-intervention. Minutes spent in sedentary behavior, light-, moderate-, and vigorous-intensity PA was determined using ActiLife software. The control group parents were asked to maintain their PA levels for the intervention period (2 months). The intervention group parents were provided educational material, a PA logbook, and weekly motivational phone calls with an intervention coach in aims of increasing their PA alone and with their child. Data analyses were conducted on the children’s data using the intention-to-treat method. Results. A 2 (group) by 2 (visit) ANCOVA found no differences between group (control vs intervention) and visit (pre vs post) for any PA level after <b>adjusting</b> <b>for</b> <b>wear</b> time (p>. 05). Furthermore, a 2 by 2 ANOVA found no differences BMI z-score by group and visit (p>. 05).

40|$|The {{majority}} of U. S. adults perform insufficient amounts {{of physical activity}} to prevent disease and maintain fitness. National recommendations prescribe fixed physical activity goals (e. g. 10, 000 steps per day) that may fall outside of an individual's current physical activity repertoire. Prescribing smaller, more adaptive goals based on participant past behavior may be more efficacious at increasing physical activity to the target level. This study tested a pedometer-based intervention that prescribed adaptive goals and rewarded behavior using a percentile schedule of reinforcement. Five individuals enrolled into the intervention and were evaluated with a single-case withdrawal (ABA) design over 10 weeks. The six -week intervention consisted of one-time educational materials, daily adaptive goals, and contingent financial rewards administered on a percentile schedule. Daily goals were determined by ranking a participant's prior 9 days of physical activity (i. e. step counts) and selecting the 40 th percentile of the distribution on a moving basis. A Lifecorder Plus, combined accelerometer and pedometer, measured moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) minutes per day and steps per day simultaneously. Visual analyses and multilevel statistical models for longitudinal data tested for change across phases. Based on visual analysis, {{four of the five}} women increased their median number of steps/day, and all five increased their median MVPA minutes/day. Participants increased their activity by 851 steps/day (range - 829 to 2, 450 steps) or approximately 5, 957 steps per week, and 3. 34 MVPA minutes/ day (range 1. 93 to 17. 27 minutes) or approximately 23. 38 MVPA minutes per week from baseline to the intervention phase.

40|$|Access {{restricted}} to the OSU CommunityTrochoidal-type machines belong to the category of planetary rotation machines and include pumps, blowers, compressors and engines. In general a trochoidal-type machine is simpler, quieter, lighter and smaller than a comparable reciprocating machine. This thesis focuses on two major aspects of trochoidal-type machines with conjugate envelopes: (i) the geometry and the characteristics {{of different types of}} trochoids and different types of conjugate envelopes; and (ii) methods to determine the contact forces and the contact stresses between the rotor and the chamber. The two types of trochoid are the peritrochoid and the hypotrochoid. For each type of trochoid, there are nine types of conjugate envelope. Conjugate envelopes provide, in general, the best geometry for sealing, high compression ratio and low contact forces and stresses. However, to date only two out of the nine types of conjugate envelope have been studied in any detail. General parametric equations of a conjugate envelope, in continuous form, are not available in the literature. In this thesis, unified and compact equations for the geometry and the geometric properties of trochoids are obtained. An additional type of conjugate envelope is discovered for each trochoid. Closed-form parametric equations for all nine types of conjugate envelopes, and the necessary and sufficient conditions for having a closed type 1 conjugate envelope are derived. A computer-aided design program, incorporating the equations, is developed. The characteristics and relationships of different types of trochoid and conjugate envelope are presented. Reducing the contact stresses in the trochoidal-type machine is very important because the machine can not be <b>adjusted</b> <b>for</b> <b>wear.</b> The main difficulty in calculating the contact forces and stresses is to determine the forces that are transmitted through each contact point. Since there are many contact points, the problem may be considered quasi-statically indeterminate. No satisfactory method of analyzing the contact forces and stresses in a trochoidal-type machine has been developed to date. Two methods to determine contact forces are developed in this thesis. One method is based on a versatile finite element model under quasi-static conditions. This model includes more detail such as the effects of contact friction and deformation, and provides contact forces and stresses everywhere. However, results need careful verification and interpretation. The other method is based on a simplified analytical model under the same conditions. This model provides physical insights to the problem and results to check the finite element model from different approaches. However, the accuracy and availability of the results is limited by additional assumptions. When the effects of contact friction and deformation are ignored, the results from both models are in good agreement. It is hoped that this thesis will prove valuable to the designer of all planetary rotation machines, especially for trochoidal-type machines with conjugate envelopes...|$|R

This study examined concurrent and prospective associations between objective measures of biological maturation, body composition and physical activity (PA) in adolescent males (n= 671) and females (n= 680). Participants born to women recruited to the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children birth cohort study were assessed at 11 and 13 years. Percentage of predicted adult stature was used as an estimate of biological maturation. PA and time sedentary was assessed over 7 consecutive days using Actigraph accelerometers. Body composition was assessed using whole-body DXA scans. At 11 and 13 years, maturity in males was inversely associated with accelerometer counts-per-minute (CPM) and time engaged in light PA, and positively associated with time sedentary. In females, maturity was inversely associated with accelerometer (CPM) at 11 but not 13 years. <b>Adjusting</b> <b>for</b> accelerometer <b>wear</b> times and corresponding activity levels at 11 years, maturity and percentage fat mass at 11 years did not predict any indices of PA or sedentary behavior in males or females at 13 years. Whereas advanced maturation in males is associated with less PA and more sedentary behavior at 11 and 13 years, maturity at 11 does not predict PA or sedentary behavior at 13 years in either sex...|$|R
40|$|AbstractExcessive {{sedentary}} {{behavior is}} associated with negative health outcomes independent of physical activity. Objective estimates {{of time spent in}} sedentary behaviors are lacking among adults from diverse Hispanic/Latino backgrounds. The objective {{of this study was to}} describe accelerometer-assessed sedentary time in a large, representative sample of Hispanic/Latino adults living in the United States, and compare sedentary estimates by Hispanic/Latino background, sociodemographic characteristics and weight categories. This study utilized baseline data from the Hispanic Community Health Study/Study of Latinos (HCHS/SOL) that included adults aged 18 – 74 years from four metropolitan areas (N= 16, 415). Measured with the Actical accelerometer over 6 days, 76. 9 % (n= 12, 631) of participants had > 10 h/day and > 3 days of data. Participants spent 11. 9 h/day (SD 3. 0), or 74 % of their monitored time in sedentary behaviors. <b>Adjusting</b> <b>for</b> differences in <b>wear</b> time, adults of Mexican background were the least (11. 6 h/day), whereas adults of Dominican background were the most (12. 3 h/day), sedentary. Women were more sedentary than men, and older adults were more sedentary than younger adults. Household income was positively associated, whereas employment was negatively associated, with sedentary time. There were no differences in sedentary time by weight categories, marital status, or proxies of acculturation. To reduce sedentariness among these populations, future research should examine how the accumulation of various sedentary behaviors differs by background and region, and which sedentary behaviors are amenable to intervention...|$|R
