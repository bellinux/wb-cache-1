40|$|A {{combination}} of factors lead to the widespread conversion of South African retirement funds from defined benefit to defined contribution across the 1980 ’s and early 1990 ’s. There were minimal legislative and regulatory constraints, particularly where the conversion was achieved by amendment {{to the rules of}} the fund rather than transfer to another fund. There were no South African professional guidance notes. Converting members received their accrued liability within the defined benefit fund using an ongoing fund valuation basis, often with a “sweetener ” to encourage conversion. Any share of the <b>actuarial</b> <b>surplus</b> or of the difference between the fair value of the assets and the actuarial value of the assets was left to be negotiated between stakeholders. In practice much if not all of the <b>actuarial</b> <b>surplus</b> and the difference between the market value and actuarial value was left behind in the conversion, releasing and concentrating <b>actuarial</b> <b>surplus</b> in the residual defined benefit scheme. These residual schemes were usually closed to new entrants. With the passage of time and the outsourcing of existing pensions payable from funds to insurers through the purchase of annuity policies, the membership of the residual schemes has dwindled. Many are now ripe for liquidation, creating the possibility o...|$|E
40|$|Because of the {{profitable}} {{nature of}} risk {{businesses in the}} long term, de Finetti suggested that surplus models should allow for cash leakages, as otherwise the surplus would unrealistically grow (on average) to infinity. These leakages were interpreted as ‘dividends’. Subsequent literature on <b>actuarial</b> <b>surplus</b> models with dividend distribution has mainly focussed on dividend strategies that either maximise the expected present value of dividends until ruin or lead to a probability of ruin that is less than one (see Albrecher and Thonhauser, Avanzi for reviews). An increasing number of papers are directly interested in modelling dividend policies {{that are consistent with}} actual practice in financial markets. In this short note, we review the corporate finance literature with the specific aim of fleshing out properties that dividend strategies should ideally satisfy, if one wants to model behaviour that is consistent with practice...|$|E
40|$|Magister Scientiae - MScPensions are {{essentially}} {{the only source}} of income for many retired workers. It is thus critical that the pension fund manager chooses the right type of plan for his/her workers. Every pension scheme follows its own set of rules when calculating the benefits of the fund’s members at retirement. Whichever plan the manager chooses for the members,he/she will have to invest their contributions in the financial market. The manager is therefore faced with the daunting task of selecting the most appropriate investment strat-egy as to maximize the returns from the financial assets. Due to the volatile nature of stock markets, some pension companies have attached minimum guarantees to pension contracts. These guarantees come at a price, but ensure that the member does not suffer a loss due to poorly performing equities. In this thesis we study four types of mathematical problems in pension fund management,of which three {{are essentially}} optimization problems. Firstly, following Blake [5], we show in a discrete time setting how to decompose a pension benefit into a combination of Euro-pean options. We also model the pension plan preferences of workers, sponsors and fund managers. We make a number of contributions additional to the paper by Blake [5]. In particular, we contribute graphic illustrations of the expected values of the pension fund assets, liabilities and the <b>actuarial</b> <b>surplus</b> processes. In more detail than in the original source, we derive the variance of the assets of a defined benefit pension plan. Secondly,we dedicate Chapter 6 to the problem of minimizing the cost of a minimum guarantee included in defined contribution (DC) pension contracts. Here we work in discrete time and consider multi-period guarantees similar to those in Hipp [25]. This entire chapter is original work. Using a standard optimization method, we propose a strategy that cal- culates an optimal sequence of guarantees that minimizes the sum of the squares of the present value of the total price of the guarantee. Graphic illustrations are included to in-dicate the minimum value and corresponding optimal sequence of guarantees. Thirdly, we derive an optimal investment strategy for a defined contribution fund with three financial assets {{in the presence of a}} minimum guarantee. We work in a continuous time setting and in particular contribute simulations of the dynamics of the short interest rate process and the assets in the financial market of Deelstra et al. [19]. We also derive an optimal investment strategy of the surplus process introduced in Deelstra et al. [19]. The results regarding the surplus are then converted to consider the actual investment portfolio per- taining to the wealth of the fund. We note that the aforementioned paper does not use optimal control theory. In order to illustrate the method of stochastic optimal control, we study a fourth problem by including a discussion of the paper by Devolder et al. [21] in Chapter 3. We enhance the work in the latter paper by including some simulations. The specific portfolio management strategies are applicable to banking as well (and is being pursued independently) ...|$|E
40|$|During {{the late}} 1990 s public pension funds across the United States accrued large <b>actuarial</b> <b>surpluses.</b> The {{seemingly}} flush {{conditions of the}} pension funds led legislators in most states to substantially improve retirement benefits for public workers, including teachers. In this study we examine the benefit enhancements to the teacher pension system in Missouri. The enhancements resulted in large windfall gains for teachers who were close to retirement when the legislation was enacted. By contrast, novice teachers, and teachers {{who had not yet}} entered the labor force, were made worse off. The reason is that front-end contribution rates have been raised for current teachers to offset past liabilities accrued from the enhancements. Total teacher retirement compensation, net of contribution costs, is lower for young teachers today {{as a result of the}} enhancement legislation. Given sharp increases in pension costs in other states, this finding may generalize to young teachers in many other plans...|$|R
40|$|Defined-benefit (DB) {{pension plans}} {{account for the}} {{majority}} of employer pension fund assets. In recent years, a number of DB plans have become underfunded, {{in sharp contrast to the}} 1990 s, when many plans had large <b>actuarial</b> <b>surpluses.</b> The deterioration in the financial health of DB plans has underscored various longer-term structural issues that could make it increasingly difficult for plan sponsors to manage the financial risks of these plans. Tuer and Woodman examine how funding deficits, a greater focus on plan liabilities, a low yield environment, and changing investment beliefs are influencing investment decisions in the Canadian DB pension sector. They review the funding of DB plans, changing views on the equity-risk premium, and the shift towards liability-centred approaches to investment and how these developments are affecting pension sector investment. They also consider additional influences on the pension sector, including the limited supply of long-term bonds, the elimination of the foreign-property rule, and the movement towards fair-value accounting and a financial-economics approach to actuarial valuation, as well as their implications for financial markets. ...|$|R
