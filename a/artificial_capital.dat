50|$|In summary, {{companies}} that had made substantial capital gains had entered into complex and self-cancelling series of transactions that had generated <b>artificial</b> <b>capital</b> losses, {{for the purpose of}} avoiding capital gains tax. The House of Lords decided that where a transaction has pre-arranged artificial steps that serve no commercial purpose other than to save tax, the proper approach is to tax the effect of the transaction as a whole.|$|E
5000|$|The most {{important}} background to Furniss v. Dawson was {{the decision of}} the House of Lords a few years earlier in W. T. Ramsay Ltd. v. Inland Revenue Commissioners 1982 A. C. 300. In the Ramsay case, a company which had made a substantial capital gain had entered into a complex and self-cancelling series of transactions which had generated an <b>artificial</b> <b>capital</b> loss. The House of Lords decided that where a transaction has pre-arranged artificial steps which serve no commercial purpose other than to save tax, then the proper approach is to tax the [...] of the transaction as a whole.|$|E
40|$|Many {{empirical}} {{studies have found}} little relation between sample mean returns of securities and estimated betas. Some of the studies have uncovered variables other than beta (e. g. firm size, ratio of book-to-market value, price/earnings ratio) that have power in explaining the sample cross-sectional variation in mean returns. The present paper shows that a {{possible explanation is that}} market portfolio proxies are mean-variance inefficient. It is shown that inefficiency of the market proxy renders estimates of the regression coefficients of the cross-sectional relationship biased. In order to illustrate the problems an <b>artificial</b> <b>capital</b> market is generated. In this financial market the CAPM is valid. It turns out that the bias of the parameter estimates may be considerable, and inference about the validity of the CAPM or about the significance of "anomalies" based on these estimates may be extremely misleading...|$|E

50|$|The palace {{was three}} stories high and {{built in the}} Empire style. The {{entrance}} was an enormous archway with a coffered ceiling. From there, a staircase decorated with Corinthian columns led to an elegant ballroom with mirrored double-doors, walls clad in white, <b>artificial</b> marble, gilded <b>capitals,</b> frescoes, and a richly decorated parquet. It {{was considered one of}} the best examples of 19th-century architecture.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{explores the}} {{economic}} effects of biodiversity loss on marketable agricultural output for intensive agricultural systems, which require an increasing level of <b>artificial</b> <b>capital</b> inputs. A theoretical bio-economic model {{is used to}} derive a hypothesis {{about the effect of}} the state of biodiversity on the optimal crop output both in the longer run and in the transitional path towards the steady-state equilibrium. The hypothesised positive relationship between biodiversity stock and optimal levels of crop output is empirically tested using a stochastic production frontier approach, based on data from a panel of UK specialised cereal farms for the period 1989 - 2000. The results support the theoretical hypothesis. Increases in biodiversity can lead to a continual outward shift in the output frontier (although at a decreasing rate), controlling for the relevant set of labour and capital inputs. Agricultural transition towards biodiversity conservation may be consistent with an increase in crop output in already biodiversity-poor modern agricultural landscapes.

40|$|The U. S. tax gap is {{estimated}} to exceed $ 450 billion, most of which arises from non-compliance {{on the part of}} individual taxpayers (GAO 2012; IRS 2006). Much is hidden in innovative tax shelters combining multiple business structures such as partnerships, trusts, and S-corporations into complex transaction networks designed to reduce and obscure the true tax liabilities of their individual shareholders. One known gambit employed by these shelters is to offset real gains in one part of a portfolio by creating <b>artificial</b> <b>capital</b> losses elsewhere through the mechanism of “inflated basis” (TaxAnalysts 2005), a process made easier by the relatively flexible set of rules surrounding “pass-through” entities such as partnerships (IRS 2009). The ability to anticipate the likely forms of emerging evasion schemes would help auditors develop more efficient methods of reducing the tax gap. To this end, we have developed a prototype evolutionary algorithm designed to generate potential schemes of the inflated basis type described above. The algorithm takes as inputs a collection of asset types and tax entities, together with a rule-set governing asset exchanges between these entities. The schemes produced by the algorithm consist of sequences of transactions within an ownership network of tax entities. Schemes are ranked according to a “fitness function” (Goldberg in Genetic algorithms in search, optimization, and machine learning. Addison-Wesley, Boston, 1989); the very best schemes are those that afford the highest reduction in tax liability while incurring the lowest expected penalty.
