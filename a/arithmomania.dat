5000|$|Apotropaics are {{objects or}} {{practices}} that {{were intended to}} prevent a recently deceased loved one from turning into an undead revenant, or to occupy a revenant sufficiently enough {{that he will not}} harm the living. Burying a corpse upside-down was widespread, as was placing earthly objects, such as scythes or sickles, near the grave to satisfy any demons entering the body or to appease the dead so that it would not wish to arise from its coffin. This method resembles the Ancient Greek practice of placing an obolus in the corpse's mouth to pay the toll to cross the River Styx in the underworld; {{it has been argued that}} instead, the coin was intended to ward off any evil spirits from entering the body, and this may have influenced later vampire folklore. This tradition persisted in modern Greek folklore about the vrykolakas, in which a wax cross and piece of pottery with the inscription [...] "Jesus Christ conquers" [...] were placed on the corpse to prevent the body from becoming a vampire. Other methods commonly practised in Europe included severing the tendons at the knees or placing poppy seeds, millet, or sand on the ground at the grave site of a presumed vampire; this was intended to keep the vampire occupied by counting the fallen grains at the rate of one grain per year, indicating an association of vampires with <b>arithmomania.</b> Similar Chinese narratives state that if a vampire-like being came across a sack of rice, it would have to count every grain; this is a theme encountered in myths from the Indian subcontinent, as well as in South American tales of witches and other sorts of evil or mischievous spirits or beings.|$|E
40|$|Ewa Pańkowska, BiałystokVictor Pelevin’s novel Numbers {{published}} in 2003 {{as a main}} part of the book DTP /NN/. The Dialectics of the Transition Period from Nowhere into No Place is the subject of an analysis in this article. Pelevin has created in this novel the satirical and grotesque picture of Russia {{at the beginning of the}} twenty-first century, easily recognizable by readers in fine details. The main purpose of the paper is to present the story of Stepan Mikhailov’s life. He is a Russian businessman – a bank manager who runs his business with the help of mystical numerology. The man believes that numbers rule the world (he believes there is some kind of a mystical relationship between numbers and our life). From his point of view, numbers influence people’s behaviour, their decisions. “ 34 ” is Stepan’s lucky number and his invisible “adviser-protector”. Mikhailov is supposed to be a sufferer from some form of an obsessive-compulsive disorder called <b>arithmomania.</b> Sufferers from this disorder have a strong need to count their actions or objects in their surroundings. ela. pankowska@poczta. onet. p...|$|E
