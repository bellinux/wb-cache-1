The album was considered <b>a</b> <b>breath</b> <b>of</b> <b>fresh</b> air in the death metal genre that had run stale for years. It received good reviews from the secular metal press.|$|E

Et klassisk stykke (a classical piece), et svensk hus (a Swedish house). Otherwise the -t is optional. Et friskt pust, or et frisk pust (<b>a</b> <b>breath</b> <b>of</b> <b>fresh</b> air).|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile Valdobrev {{attended}} the High School for Foreign Languages in Stara Zagora. For a Communist country behind the Iron Curtain which Bulgaria {{was at that}} time, this school was like <b>a</b> <b>breath</b> <b>of</b> <b>fresh</b> air – with a discipline not so strict and teachers being lenient and having a personal approach {{to each of the}} students. They soon noticed Valdobrev's wandering mind and lack of concentration in class and created a system which tried to help him study the English language better. They gave him constant tasks to listen to and write down lyrics of new songs, perform them with his guitar in the lessons and translate the words for his classmates. These everyday concerts were the real productive education for him and later, when he was traveling over the Black Sea resorts and Germany as a street musician, he already had a set-list of 300 prepared and well-rehearsed world hit songs of any genre.|$|E
500|$|Upon {{its release}} in the United States Variety praised {{the film as}} an [...] "extravagant piece of science fiction. Despite its obvious horror angles, {{production}} is crammed with incident and suspense". According to Hallenbeck, many US critics found Brian Donlevy's gruff Quatermass <b>a</b> <b>breath</b> <b>of</b> <b>fresh</b> air from the earnest hero scientists of American science fiction films, such as Gene Barry's character in War of the Worlds.|$|E

500|$|Released on November 16, 2012, Omen {{was well}} {{received}} by music critics. They highlighted the drumming on the album, remarking on how Børven {{was able to}} match the skill and intensity of Blomberg. Steven Ecott of Cross Rhythms praised the drumming, guitar work, and harsh vocals. He concluded that [...] "'Omen' is <b>a</b> <b>breath</b> <b>of</b> <b>fresh</b> air in the rather stale and stuffy room that black metal finds itself resting." [...] Scott Waters of HM wrote that [...] "the musicianship is beyond reproach. To simply play that fast and accurate, even for four-minute spurts, requires more than just talent. It requires skill and endurance. Much of the music on Omen display that skill and endurance and definitely accomplishes what it set out to do." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{album was}} met with mostly {{favorable}} reviews. [...] On Metacritic, it was given a score of 72 out of 100 based on 21 reviews. Thom Jurek of AllMusic hailed the album as [...] "raging, forward-thinking heavy metal melding with hardcore thrash", and wrote that Christ Illusion marked a return to [...] "what made them such <b>a</b> <b>breath</b> <b>of</b> <b>fresh</b> air in the first place." [...] Ben Ratliff of The New York Times described the album as possessing [...] "a kind of demented gravity, and the music bears it out: {{it is the most}} concentrated, focused Slayer record in 20 years." [...] PopMatters critic Adrien Begrand called it [...] "Slayer's best album in sixteen years and their most thought-provoking work to date", and the album was placed at number 15 on PopMatters' list of The Best Metal Albums of 2006.|$|E
500|$|On 20 January 1948, Mackenzie King {{announced}} his intent to resign. He also announced a Cabinet reshuffle; both St. Laurent and Howe had urged the Prime Minister to move Howe, {{who had not}} enjoyed {{his work at the}} Ministry of Reconstruction and Supply. Mackenzie King finally yielded, moving James Angus MacKinnon, the Minister of Trade and Commerce to open his place for Howe (the Albertan became Minister of Fisheries). [...] Howe publicly announced that he was [...] "not available" [...] to stand for the leadership, and that he was supporting St. Laurent. The Quebecer was elected Leader of the Liberal Party in August, and Mackenzie King finally resigned on 15 November. [...] At age66, St. Laurent was only seven years younger than Mackenzie King, but was nevertheless seen as <b>a</b> <b>breath</b> <b>of</b> <b>fresh</b> air—except at Cabinet meetings, where he reversed Mackenzie King's smoking ban.|$|E
500|$|On Empire magazine's {{list of the}} 500 {{greatest}} films, Saw ranked 499th.

In light of its measly $1.2 million price tag the film's quality relative to bigger-budget horror films is striking. It also takes itself seriously, which came as <b>a</b> <b>breath</b> <b>of</b> <b>fresh</b> air following the trend of wimpy tongue-in-cheek horror that had dominated the multiplexes post-Scream. More than anything, this twisted morality tale is a film made by horror fans, for horror fans; it's gory, it's depraved, {{and best of all}} it introduced a new horror icon in Jigsaw." [...] The Daily Telegraph listed the film number 14 on their Top 100 list that defined the 2000s.|$|E
6000|$|... "No; {{you miss}} many pleasures," [...] remarked the cab-horse, pityingly.

500|$|Writing for the A.V. Club, Alex McLevy graded {{the episode}} a 'B' and praised Greenberg's script for its [...] "wit and verve" [...] and [...] "sparkling" [...] dialogue. He felt Johnson and her storyline with Reyes benefited {{the most from}} the script, {{and said that the}} further {{development}} of the central team and their newly established status quo covered the [...] "real questions" [...] of the episode despite the various overarching plot developments shown. McLevy felt the introduction of Mace and the surprise twist of his Inhumanity were handled fine, but was even more pleased with the twist of [...] "having the director being a really personable, self-deprecating dork" [...] and O'Mara's performance as such. Joseph McCabe at Nerdist praised O'Mara for [...] "keeping his gravitas a safe distance below the surface", which McCabe found to be <b>a</b> <b>breath</b> <b>of</b> <b>fresh</b> air from previous big introductions to the series.|$|E
500|$|During {{a feature}} on what storylines were working and {{not working for}} the show, a Soap World {{columnist}} praised the character, saying [...] "Naomi Canning has been perhaps the best new character {{of the last few}} years. Her cougar/cub sex fling with Josh is pure hotness and tends towards the controversial, thus providing good watercooler moments for fans." [...] The columnist also enjoyed Naomi's feud with her mother, as it led to some strong scenes between the two women. However, they criticised Naomi's attempts to seduce Toadie, believing that it was not well executed and for a character [...] "designed to be a husband-stealing minx" [...] her pursuit was [...] "tepid at best". During his review of the show in 2014, Digital Spy's Daniel Kilkelly praised O'Reilly's addition to the cast, saying [...] "Naomi has also been <b>a</b> <b>breath</b> <b>of</b> <b>fresh</b> air as a character who will push the boundaries just that little bit more than many of her neighbours!" ...|$|E
500|$|According to Durst, Limp Bizkit would [...] "comb {{the world}} for the illest guitar player known to man" [...] to replace Borland. After holding a {{nationwide}} audition for a new guitarist, [...] "Put Your Guitar Where Your Mouth Is", the band recorded with Snot guitarist Mike Smith. [...] "Mike brought in <b>a</b> <b>breath</b> <b>of</b> <b>fresh</b> air," [...] Durst said. [...] "Creatively, it fit like a glove. It made life easier and more positive. It made us look forward to getting together as a band so much more. The positive effect he had on me just made the whole experience of Limp Bizkit feel like a brand-new entity." [...] Before Smith replaced Borland, Durst played a great deal of guitar. Jon Wiederhorn of MTV wrote, [...] "Limp Bizkit jammed with four finalists after their much-publicized guitarist audition tour, but now it looks like Fred Durst might be taking a cue from his Puddle of Mudd pal Wes Scantlin and handling both vocal and guitar duties himself." ...|$|E
5000|$|The Platform {{gave the}} film a {{positive}} review, stating [...] "The tasteful comedy, with genuine characters and an amalgamation of Asian culture with abject Britishness, makes Finding Fatimah a pleasure - but more importantly, <b>a</b> welcome <b>breath</b> <b>of</b> <b>fresh</b> air. It {{is a film}} {{that should have been}} made a decade ago, and is a welcome release to the tension the media have contributed to propagating about Muslims".|$|R
60|$|That was {{a remarkably}} big desert. There {{was nothing to}} relieve the monotony of view and every minute seemed an hour and every hour a day. Disagreeable fumes and gases rose from the sands, {{which would have been}} deadly to the {{travelers}} had they not been so high in the air. As it was, Trot was beginning to feel sick, when <b>a</b> <b>breath</b> <b>of</b> <b>fresher</b> air filled her nostrils and on looking ahead she saw a great cloud of pink-tinted mist. Even while she wondered what it could be, the Ork plunged boldly into the mist and the other birds followed. She could see nothing for a time, nor could the bird which carried her see where the Ork had gone, but it kept flying as sturdily as ever and in a few moments the mist was passed and the girl saw a most beautiful landscape spread out below her, extending as far as her eye could reach.|$|R
5000|$|In {{contrast}} to Huang, Ken Hanke {{wrote in his}} book, Charlie Chan at the Movies: History, Filmography, and Criticism, [...] "Roland Winters has never received his due ... Winters brought with him <b>a</b> badly needed <b>breath</b> <b>of</b> <b>fresh</b> air to the series." [...] He cited [...] "the richness of the approach and the verve with which the series was being tackled" [...] during the Winters era." [...] Similarly, Howard M. Berlin, in his book, Charlie Chan's Words of Wisdom, commented that [...] "Winters brought <b>a</b> much needed <b>breath</b> <b>of</b> <b>fresh</b> air to the flagging film series with his self-mocking, semi-satirical interpretation of Charlie, which {{is very close to}} the Charlie Chan in Biggers' novels." ...|$|R
500|$|In May 1980, U2 {{released}} [...] "11 O'Clock Tick Tock", {{their first}} international single and their debut on Island Records, but {{it failed to}} chart. Martin Hannett, who produced the single, was scheduled to produce the band's debut album, Boy, but ultimately was replaced with Steve Lillywhite. From July to September 1980, U2 recorded the album at Windmill Lane Studios, drawing from their nearly 40-song repertoire at the time. Lillywhite employed unorthodox production techniques, such as recording Mullen's drums in a stairwell, and recording smashed bottles and forks played against a spinning bicycle wheel. The band found Lillywhite to be very encouraging and creative; Bono called him [...] "such <b>a</b> <b>breath</b> <b>of</b> <b>fresh</b> air", while the Edge said he [...] "had a great way of pulling {{the best out of}} everybody". The album's lead single, [...] "A Day Without Me", was released in August. Although it did not chart, the song was the impetus for the Edge's purchase of a delay effect unit, the Electro-Harmonix Memory Man, which came to define his guitar playing style and {{had a significant impact on}} the group's creative output.|$|E
500|$|Drums on [...] "Satan's Bed" [...] were {{performed}} by Abbruzzese's drum tech Jimmy Shoaf. On {{the day it}} was recorded, Abbruzzese was in the hospital having his tonsils removed. Vedder and Gossard asked for Shoaf's help to get a drum machine working, and after setting it up, the pair asked Shoaf to perform the same beat on the drums. He is credited on the lyric sheet as [...] "Jimmy". Months after finishing the initial recording sessions for Vitalogy, Abbruzzese was fired in August 1994 due to personality conflicts with the band members. Gossard said, [...] "It was the nature of how the politics worked in our band: It was up to me to say, 'Hey, we tried, it's not working; time to move on.' On a superficial level, it was a political struggle: For whatever reason his ability to communicate with Ed and Jeff was very stifled. I certainly don't think it was all Dave Abbruzzese's fault that it was stifled." [...] Jack Irons, the original drummer for the Red Hot Chili Peppers and Abbruzzese's successor, plays drums on [...] "Hey Foxymophandlemama, That's Me". Gossard said, [...] "Jack entered the band right at the end of making Vitalogy. Jack's <b>a</b> <b>breath</b> <b>of</b> <b>fresh</b> air, a family man. Everybody had a strong sense of friendship with him immediately. He was just there to play drums and help out." ...|$|E
500|$|Bill Lamb from About.com cited [...] "4 in the Morning" [...] as {{the best}} song from The Sweet Escape, calling it [...] "beautifully {{performed}} and produced" [...] and noting that Stefani [...] "allows her signature vocals to sensually float and glide through the lyrical content." [...] Similarly, a reviewer for CBBC enjoyed that the song is [...] "a melancholy and reflective ballad about relationships, which is <b>a</b> <b>breath</b> <b>of</b> <b>fresh</b> air for Gwen", praising its [...] "catchy melody and woeful lyrics." [...] Nick Levine of Digital Spy compared it to Robert Palmer's [...] "Addicted to Love", writing that [...] "it confirms what is rapidly becoming a universal truth: Gwen Stefani is far more likeable when she channels her new wave roots than when she tries to mould herself into a ghetto fabulous urban hipshaker." [...] Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine praised Kanal's production for making the song [...] "less forced and much less self-conscious." [...] Quentin B. Huff of PopMatters {{referred to it as}} one of the [...] "few real compositions" [...] from the album. John Murphy of musicOMH agreed, writing that [...] "she sounds great" [...] on [...] "the lovelorn ballad." [...] Pitchfork's Mark Pytlik, however, disapproved of the song, commenting that it destroyed [...] "the mallpop cred that Stefani accrued with L.A.M.B.s impeccable 'Cool'." [...] Spence D. of IGN was also critical with the song, calling it [...] "the most generic, mainstream, and blasé-blah pop song on the entire album." ...|$|E
5000|$|The {{album was}} well received. Channel24 gave the album a 4/5, stating: [...] "Expectedly, {{a lot of}} people might find the album {{exhaustive}} and preachy, and in some cases they might have a point - Tuks does seem to go on a bit. But {{at a time when most}} of local hip hop seems to apologetically fit itself into a commercial mould, Tuks’ impassioned audacity comes as <b>a</b> welcome <b>breath</b> <b>of</b> <b>fresh</b> air." ...|$|R
