40|$|An {{atomizer}} for {{thermal management}} system for efficiently thermally managing {{one or more}} heat producing devices. The atomizer for thermal management system includes a housing having a coolant passage and <b>a</b> <b>dispensing</b> <b>end,</b> an orifice within the dispensing end, and an actuator manipulating a plunger within the housing. The plunger includes a head that is sealable within a recessed portion of the orifice to open or close the orifice. The coolant passes through the coolant passage into the orifice for spraying upon a heat producing device. The actuator may reciprocate so that the coolant spray emitted through the orifice is pulsating. The pulsing frequency may be increased to increase cooling or decreased to decrease cooling of the heat producing device...|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} {{was to investigate the}} association between prenatal selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) exposure and overweight in offspring at 4 - 5 years of age. We conducted a retrospective cohort study using linked records from the Women's and Children's Health Network in South Australia, Australia. Women were eligible to participate if they gave birth to singleton, live-born infants between September 2000 and December 2005. Women were excluded if they received <b>a</b> <b>dispensing</b> for <b>an</b> antidepressant other than SSRIs or an antipsychotic or an anti-epileptic or had a chronic medical condition. Of the 6560 eligible women, 71 received <b>a</b> <b>dispensing</b> for <b>an</b> SSRI (exposed), 204 had a reported psychiatric illness but did not receive <b>a</b> <b>dispensing</b> for any antidepressant (untreated psychiatric illness) and 6285 did not have a reported psychiatric illness and did not receive <b>a</b> <b>dispensing</b> for any antidepressant (unexposed). Childhood overweight was classified as a body mass index > 85 th percentile, based on age and sex. At 4 - 5 years of age, female offspring of exposed mothers {{were less likely to be}} overweight compared with female offspring of mothers with an untreated psychiatric illness [adjusted Prevalence Ratio (aPR) 0. 23; 95 % confidence interval (CI) 0. 05 - 0. 98] and female offspring of unexposed mothers (aPR 0. 27; 0. 07 - 0. 99). No association with overweight was observed among male offspring of exposed mothers compared with male offspring of mothers with an untreated psychiatric illness (aPR 1. 17; 0. 54 - 2. 51) and male offspring of unexposed mothers (aPR 0. 93; 0. 52 - 1. 67).

40|$|OBJECTIVE: This study {{aimed to}} {{investigate}} neonatal outcomes after prenatal exposure to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) during late-gestation. METHODS: A retrospective cohort {{study was conducted}} using linked records from the Women's and Children's Health Network in South Australia, Australia, including the Perinatal Statistics Collection and the Hospital Pharmacy Dispensing Records. Women were eligible to participate if they gave birth to singleton, live-born infants between September 2000 and December 2008 (n = 33, 965). Women were excluded if they received <b>a</b> <b>dispensing</b> for antidepressants other than SSRIs (n = 93) or an antipsychotic (n = 81). We estimated odds ratios (ORs) and 95 % confidence intervals (CIs) for preterm delivery, low birth weight, small-for-gestational age, neonatal hospitalization and length of hospital admission, adjusting for sociodemographic, lifestyle, and medical factors. RESULTS: Two hundred twenty-one women received <b>a</b> <b>dispensing</b> for <b>an</b> SSRI during pregnancy, 1566 had a psychiatric illness but did not receive <b>a</b> <b>dispensing</b> for <b>an</b> SSRI, and 32, 004 {{did not have a}} psychiatric illness and did not receive <b>a</b> <b>dispensing</b> for <b>an</b> SSRI. Compared to infants of women with a psychiatric illness but no SSRI use, infants of women exposed to SSRIs had an increased risk of preterm delivery (adjusted OR, 2. 68; 95 % CI, 1. 83 - 3. 93), low birth weight (adjusted OR, 2. 26; 95 % CI, 1. 31 - 3. 91), admission to hospital (adjusted OR, 1. 92; 95 % CI, 1. 39 - 2. 65), and length of hospital stay longer than 3 days (adjusted OR, 1. 93; 95 % CI, 1. 11 - 3. 36) but not small-for-gestational age (adjusted OR, 1. 13; 95 % CI, 0. 65 - 1. 94). Psychiatric illness but no SSRI use during pregnancy was only associated with an increased likelihood of neonatal hospital admission (adjusted OR, 1. 21; 95 % CI, 1. 07 - 1. 38). CONCLUSIONS: These results add to the growing body of evidence of an association between SSRI exposure during pregnancy and a range of adverse neonatal outcomes, but the potential for confounding according to severity of underlying maternal psychiatric illness requires further investigation.
