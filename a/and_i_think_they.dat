McCready said he started [...] "throwing ideas back and forth. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>they</b> {{just wanted a}} northwest guy to do it, because they were shooting it in the northwest". He elaborated that [...] "My role was smaller than someone who wrote all the music for it, but I think I was none the less integral in there. I mean, it was fun. Chris sent me his cues, and I just kind of rearranged them into guitar ideas".|$|E

The leaders of the Jewish community are influential enough that they could change the direction of where this is going, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>they</b> should". This brought criticism from many of his own party, including, among others, Senate Democratic Leader Tom Daschle and Senator Joe Lieberman. Nancy Pelosi, who was House Minority Leader at the time, remarked that [...] "Moran's comments have no place in the Democratic Party." ...|$|E

They look at me and see someone trying to do that...

500|$|Following his {{involvement}} with this episode, Campbell was considered as a possible contender {{for the role of}} John Doggett, a character that would appear in the eighth season. Over a hundred actors auditioned for the role. Due to a contractual obligation, Campbell could not take any work during the filming of his series Jack of All Trades. On potentially being cast as the series regular, Campbell mused, [...] "I had worked on an X-Files episode before, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>they</b> sort of remembered me from that. It was nice to be involved in that – even if you don't get it, it's nice to hang out at that party." [...] The character was eventually portrayed by actor Robert Patrick. Later in Campbell's novel Make Love! The Bruce Campbell Way, he joked that Patrick [...] "stiffed him out of the role".|$|E
500|$|Aided by Gilmer's findings, Stan Love filed unsuccessfully for conservatorship on May 17, 1990. A {{press conference}} with Stan at the lectern {{featured}} an unexpected appearance from Brian. While {{reading from a}} piece of paper, Brian was given a microphone and said: [...] "I {{have heard of the}} charges made by Stan Love, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>they</b> are outrageous, which means they are out of the ballpark... I feel great." [...] Audree, Carl, Carnie, and Wendy Wilson then contested Landy's control of Brian, pursuing legal action on May 7, 1991. The ruling was finalized on February 3, 1992 when Landy was barred by court order from contacting Brian, leaving his affairs to the hands of conservator Jerome S. Billet. In December 1992, Landy was fined $1,000 for violating the court order when he visited Brian in June for his birthday.|$|E

Picking up where the first part left of, the video follows Jean Noel, a human man who has received plastic surgery from aliens to be transformed into the [...] "perfect specimen". In an interview for The Creators Project, Nilsson explained how the videos were conceptualized: [...] "The concept of this was born after long evenings of me and the band talking about gene technology in contemporary science. We share a mutual excitement in what's happening on the medical scene right now." [...] "The Wave" [...] was filmed before [...] "Paddling Out", although the latter was released first. Wyatt explained to Billboard, [...] "We really liked [...] Andreas's images <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>they</b> go together in a way that feels truthful with what we do ... and you can read into it in different ways." ...|$|E

500|$|Andre Ethier, Russell Martin and Wilson Valdez {{managed to}} each earn three hits each during the Dodgers game. Ethier {{hit a home}} run which drove in the first four runs of the season for the Dodgers, who stole five bases — their most since August 23, 1999 when they stole seven in a game at Milwaukee. [...] "It's kind of cool to have a decent game on Jackie Robinson Day," [...] Martin said. [...] "I’m going to {{remember}} this probably {{for the rest of my}} life." [...] Randy Wolf, who was playing for the Dodgers at the time (currently a free agent) allowed six hits and three runs in six innings and struck out seven. [...] "The whole team wearing No. 42, it kind of goes sour if we don’t win," [...] Wolf said. [...] "It was great. There were a lot of special people here.

500|$|Hoping to {{continue}} the series, Carter introduced a new central character to replace Mulder: Doggett. More than 100 actors auditioned for the role, with only about ten considered by the producers. Lou Diamond Phillips and Hart Bochner were among the auditionees, and Phillips, Bochner and Bruce Campbell were considered for the role. In particular, Campbell, following his involvement with the sixth season episode [...] "Terms of Endearment", was considered, but, due to a contractual obligation, could not take any work during the filming of his series Jack of All Trades. On potentially being cast as the series regular, Campbell mused, [...] "I had worked on an X-Files episode before, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>they</b> sort of remembered me from that.

The Bruce Campbell Way, he joked that Patrick [...] "stiffed him out of the role". In the end, the producers eventually chose Robert Patrick. Reportedly, Patrick was cast {{due to the fact that}} his featured role in [...] (1991) would attract a great 18- to 35-year-old male demographic to the show. In fact, Fox executives reported a 10 percent overall increase in the demographic, solely due to Patrick's casting.|$|E
500|$|A {{music video}} for [...] "No Angel" [...] was {{released}} on December 13, 2013 through the iTunes Store {{in addition to a}} clip for every other track on the parent album. On November 24, 2014 it was also uploaded to the singer's Vevo account. @lilinternet served as the director and Ed Burke was the creative director for the visual filmed in Houston, Texas. After seeing the music video for [...] "Express Yourself" [...] by Diplo which was directed by @lilinternet and featured various shots of New Orleans, Beyoncé expressed her wish to collaborate with him on the visual for [...] "No Angel". Diplo contacted the director, telling him that the singer is interested in a collaboration. Following discussions with Beyoncé's team, he went to Houston with Ben Solomon and visited her team from Parkwood Entertainment to discuss about his work. In an interview with Vice magazine, @lilinternet recalled that the whole project occurred [...] "very rapidly". Beyoncé told the director she wanted to create a tribute to Houston, as he specialized in working on filming various locations and [...] "environmental beauty". Initially, the video was planned to be shot in a span of eight days. Only little narratives were planned; however @lilinternet revealed that the team opted for driving around Houston and filming various locations and people. He stated, [...] "We had so many Houston legends all together in that video, and they all really worked hard to let us capture Houston properly. Beyonce's team hooked us up with the legends. It's her hometown and she wanted its heroes represented. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>they</b> really respected the fact we weren't in and out." [...] He added that the video was completed without any [...] "exaggeration" [...] and felt that there was [...] "so much beauty that kind of just innately was in the people and in the city". The director revealed that {{he had a lot of}} freedom while working on the video and added, ...|$|E

500|$|The filmmakers behind Twilight {{worked to}} create a film that was as {{faithful}} to the novel as they thought possible when converting the story to another medium, with producer Greg Mooradian saying, [...] "It's very important to distinguish that we're making a separate piece of art that obviously is going to remain very, very faithful to the book.... But at the same time, we have a separate responsibility {{to make the best}} movie you can make." [...] To ensure a faithful adaptation, Meyer was kept very involved in the production process, having been invited to visit the set during filming and even asked to give notes on the script and on a rough cut of the film. Of this process, she said, [...] "It was a really pleasant exchange [...] from the beginning, which I think is not very typical. They were really interested in my ideas", and, [...] "...they kept me in the loop and with the script, they let me see it and said, 'What are your thoughts?'... They let me have input on it <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>they</b> took 90 percent of what I said and just incorporated it right in to the script." [...] Meyer fought for one line in particular, one of the most well-known from the book about [...] "the lion and the lamb", to be kept verbatim in the film: [...] "I actually think the way Melissa [...] wrote it sounded better for the movie [...] {{but the problem is that}} line is actually tattooed on peoples' bodies [...] But I said, 'You know, if you take that one and change it, that's a potential backlash situation. Meyer was even invited {{to create a}} written list of things that could not be changed for the film, such as giving the vampires fangs or killing characters who do not die in the book, that the studio agreed to follow. The consensus among critics is that the filmmakers succeeded in making a film that is very faithful to its source material, with one reviewer stating that, with a few exceptions, [...] "Twilight the movie is unerringly faithful to the source without being hamstrung by it." ...|$|E
