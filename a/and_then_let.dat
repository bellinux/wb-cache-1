5|$|The song comes first. And all {{of those}} other things that people remember, the imagistic things, are secondary, or {{certainly}} not as important.

5|$|Burtt {{had visited}} Niagara Falls in 1987 {{and used his}} {{recordings}} from his trip for the sounds of wind. He ran around a hall with a canvas bag up to record the sandstorm though. For the scene where WALL-E runs from falling shopping carts, Burtt and his daughter went to a supermarket and placed a recorder in their cart. They crashed it around the parking lot <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>let</b> it tumble down a hill. To create Hal (WALL-E's pet cockroach)'s skittering, he recorded the clicking caused by taking apart and reassembling handcuffs.|$|E
5|$|Napoleon's divisional commanders were {{immediately}} {{impressed by his}} capacity for hard work, {{from the beginning of}} Italy campaign. Subordinates could never say they would attend to something <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>let</b> it slide, and the staff who had been stationary in Nice for four years suddenly felt pulsating effect of Napoleon's energy. In the nine month between arrival in Nice and the end of 1776 he sent more than eight hundred letters and despatches, covering everything from where drummer-boys should stand in parades to the conditions under which the 'Marseillaise' should be played. Augereu was first of his generals to be won over, followed Massena. 'That little bastard of a general actually frightened me!' Augereau would later tell Massena.|$|E

25|$|According to Robert Zydendos, karma in Jainism can be {{considered}} a kind of system of laws, but natural rather than moral laws. In Jainism, actions that carry moral significance are considered to cause certain consequences in just the same way as, for instance, physical actions that do not carry any special moral significance. When one holds an apple in one's hand <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>let</b> go of the apple, the apple will fall: this is only natural. There is no judge, and no moral judgment involved, since this is a mechanical consequence of the physical action.|$|E

25|$|The {{amount of}} work {{required}} to implement a filter graph depends on several factors. In the simplest case, DirectShow can create a filter graph automatically from a source such as a file or URL. If this is not possible, the developer {{may be able to}} manually create a filter graph from a source file, possibly {{with the addition of a}} custom filter, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>let</b> DirectShow complete the filter graph by connecting the filters together. At the next level, the developer must build the filter graph from scratch by manually adding and connecting each desired filter. Finally, in cases where an essential filter is unavailable, the developer must create a custom filter before a filter graph can be built.|$|E
25|$|Hill took pole {{position}} {{in front of}} his home crowd in Britain ahead of Schumacher, Berger, Alesi, Häkkinen and Barrichello. There was controversy as Schumacher passed Hill on the parade lap, not permitted under the regulations, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>let</b> him resume first position before they came back to the grid to form up. The first start was aborted when Coulthard (returning to the Williams team) stalled on the grid and was forced to start from the back. Irvine retired on the second parade lap with engine problems and at the second start, Brundle's engine blew in a spectacular ball of fire. At the start, Barrichello was the man on the move, getting by Alesi and Häkkinen. Hill led Schumacher, Berger, Barrichello, Alesi and Häkkinen.|$|E
25|$|Tunisian nationalists would {{complain}} that these improvements, e.g., {{the rail and}} mining operations, were intended to benefit primarily France; the French profited most, and the employment opportunities were open more to French colons than to Tunisians. French companies provided their own engineers, technicians, managers, and accountants, {{and most of the}} skilled work force. Another major grievance of nationalist critics regarded the 'flood' of cheap manufactured goods entering the Tunisian market. This competition worked havoc with the large artisan class, until then in good health and vigor, who made comparable goods by hand according to tradition. Here, the French did no more than passively introduce into Tunisia the fruits of advanced production techniques, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>let</b> neutral market forces wreck their destruction on the local merchants, who could not compete on price.|$|E

25|$|On 26 June 1954, Douglas DC-3 was hijacked {{by members}} of the Karen National Defense Organization (KNDO, later the Karen National Liberation Army). After the killing of Saw Ba U Gyi in 1950, the first {{president}} of the Karen National Union (KNU), the group sought to regain both a political initiative and financial leverage. Three KNDO members - Major Saw Kyaw Aye, Captain Thein Kyaw and Captain A Nyein - planned to hijack a plane, and use it to smuggle illegal weapons. They successfully hijacked the plane, and forced its British pilot Captain A.E. Hare to land on a deserted beach, after other group members had failed to build a suitable temporary runway in Karen. Finding 700,000 Burmese kyat in metal chests in the cargo, cash being transported between bank branches, they confiscated this <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>let</b> the plane take off. Censorship banned reporting of the story for over 50 years, but in April 2014 it was the subject of the book The World's First Hijacking, and is being developed into a Hollywood-produced film under the same title.|$|E
25|$|One more {{test flight}} was {{conducted}} at the Island Grounds in 1914, when J. W. Madley, a water works engineer, tested an aircraft assembled by him. He flew it over the Red Hills reservoir to inspect works and shot a couple of aerial photographs of the reservoir from the aircraft. This incident kindled an interest in flying among prominent residents of the city, resulting in {{the arrival of a}} set of aviators in 1911 to display the flying machines they had brought with them to India as a marketing initiative. The aviators included Baron de Caters and Jules Tyck. On 15 February 1911, Tyck flew in a Blériot aeroplane in front of the public. The aircraft was wheeled out by eight men with Tyck seated inside the craft wearing an oilskin coat and goggles. The men held the plane till its engine revved up <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>let</b> go, and the craft darted forward about 20 yards before rising into the air. In the air, the craft made a straight flight only for about three-quarters of the length of the ground and descended due to poor weather. Tyck flew again the next day, this time reaching a height of 2,400feet, which was witnessed by the then Governor of Madras Sir Arthur Lawley. Two days later, on 18 February, another demonstration was given by Baron de Caters, when he flew his aircraft in public.|$|E
500|$|After the {{positive}} {{response to the}} opening sequence by Banksy, creator Matt Groening and Jean came to Kricfalusi {{and asked him if}} he could do something similar. Originally, they only wanted him to do the storyboards <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>let</b> their regular crew animate it, but Kricfalusi insisted on doing the animation himself, explaining that [...] "If we had done it that way, no one would even have known that I {{had anything to do with}} it because it would have ended up on model and all pose to pose". [...] On The Simpsons, the animators draw key poses <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>let</b> tweeners interpolate between those poses. The interpolation however, is a straight a to b animation. That way the animation ends up having the characters just going from pose to pose. Kricfalusi explains that on The Simpsons he [...] "wanted to try moving the characters in crazy fun ways, not just looking funny each time they come to a stop", and further elaborated [...] "that the way things happened was even more important than what was happening in my work. You can’t write visual performance. You have to actually draw it." ...|$|E

500|$|Like Ferraro's {{previous}} albums Night Dolls with Hairspray and Last American Hero, Far Side Virtual explores American {{culture of}} the present and recent past. A writer from French music blog The Drone described Far Side Virtual as a concept album inspired by the ideas of hyperreality and simulacra from the post-modern cultural theorist Jean Baudrillard. Harper wrote, [...] "Up until Far Side Virtual, many of James Ferraro's albums were impressionistic lo-fi portraits of bygone eras – perhaps on Far Side Virtual he decided to represent the present as is <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>let</b> nature take its course, over time, and do the aging for him. Returning to it in ten or twenty years time, we might discover that it was ironically a victim of its own futurist acceleration, and is now about as up-to-date as a ten-year-old carton of milk." ...|$|E
500|$|A joint Congressional {{committee}} {{debated the}} removal of President Washington's body from Mount Vernon to a crypt in the Capitol in early 1832. The crypt was built by architect Charles Bulfinch in the 1820s during {{the reconstruction of the}} burned-out capitol after the British had set it afire in August 1814, during the Burning of Washington. Southern opposition was intense, antagonized by an ever-growing rift between North and South. Congressman Wiley Thompson of Georgia expressed the Southerners' fear when he said, [...] "Remove the remains of our venerated Washington from their association with the remains of his consort and his ancestors, from Mount Vernon and from his native State, and deposit them in this capitol, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>let</b> a severance of the Union occur, and behold the remains of Washington on a shore foreign to his native soil." ...|$|E

500|$|While Radiohead has {{expressed}} anti-war sentiments in the past—including {{a contribution to}} the 1995 War Child charity compilation The Help Album—"Harry Patch (In Memory Of)" [...] marks {{the first time that a}} Radiohead song explicitly refers to war in its lyrics, marking a departure from Yorke's typically abstract writing. The lyrics are from the perspective of a soldier in the midst of First World War trench warfare. Several lines, including [...] "Give your leaders each a gun <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>let</b> them fight it out themselves" [...] and [...] "The next will be chemical but they will never learn", are adapted from quotations by Patch. Both Luke Lewis of NME and Simon Vozick-Levinson of Entertainment Weekly likened the lyrics to Wilfred Owen's First World War-era poem Dulce et Decorum est. Rice referred to Yorke's voice in the song as an [...] "innocent and youthful falsetto"; the NME said his singing is [...] "subdued to the point where you really need to read the lyrics".|$|E
500|$|A breaker boy was a coal-mining {{worker in}} the United States and United Kingdom whose job was to {{separate}} impurities from coal by hand in a coal breaker. Although breaker boys were primarily children, elderly coal miners who could no longer work in the mines because of age, disease, or accident were also sometimes employed as breaker boys. The use of breaker boys began around 1866. For 10 hours a day, six days a week, breaker boys would sit on wooden seats, perched over the chutes and conveyor belts, picking slate and other impurities out of the coal. Breaker boys working on top of chutes or conveyor belts would stop the coal by pushing their boots into the stream of fuel flowing beneath them, briefly pick out the impurities, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>let</b> the coal pass {{on to the next}} breaker boy for further processing. Others would divert coal into a horizontal chute at which they sat, then pick the coal clean before allowing the fuel to flow into [...] "clean" [...] coal bins.|$|E
500|$|Alexander O. Smith, {{who worked}} as a writer on the {{localization}} of the first Ace Attorney game, also worked on the localization of Apollo Justice. Localization of the game was already in progress by August 2007. The name [...] "Apollo Justice" [...] was decided in collaboration between the Japanese and American divisions of Capcom; it took them twenty-two meetings to decide on it. The name refers to how Apollo fights for justice. During the localization, there was some debate about {{the use of the word}} [...] "panties" [...] to describe Trucy's magical bloomers, a prop she uses in her magic shows; some on the localization team felt that it was inappropriate to joke about an underage girl's panties, and wanted them to be localized as [...] "magic pants", while some felt that the joke would be lost if the player already knew that they were massive bloomers. Janet Hsu, one of the staff members working on the localization, made an argument for [...] "emotional accuracy", saying that the Japanese version of the game was trying to make the player feel at unease over looking for what they might imagine to be [...] "sexy lingerie", <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>let</b> the player feel relief at finding out that it is a prop for a magic show.
