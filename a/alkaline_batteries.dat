25|$|Until {{the late}} 1950s the zinc–carbon battery {{continued}} to be a popular primary cell battery, but its relatively low battery life hampered sales. In 1955, an engineer named Lewis Urry, working for Union Carbide at the National Carbon Company Parma Research Laboratory, was tasked with finding a way to extend the life of zinc-carbon batteries, but Urry decided instead that <b>alkaline</b> <b>batteries</b> held more promise. Until then, longer-lasting <b>alkaline</b> <b>batteries</b> were unfeasibly expensive. Urry's battery consisted of a manganese dioxide cathode and a powdered zinc anode with an alkaline electrolyte. Using powdered zinc gave the anode a greater surface area. These batteries hit the market in 1959.|$|E

25|$|<b>Alkaline</b> <b>batteries</b> {{are prone}} to leaking {{potassium}} hydroxide, a caustic agent that can cause respiratory, eye and skin irritation. Risk {{of this can be}} reduced by not attempting to recharge disposable alkaline cells, not mixing different battery types in the same device, replacing all of the batteries at the same time, storing in a dry place and at room temperature, and removing batteries for storage of devices.|$|E
25|$|Old {{rechargeable}} batteries self-discharge {{more rapidly than}} disposable <b>alkaline</b> <b>batteries,</b> especially nickel-based batteries; a freshly charged nickel cadmium (NiCd) battery loses 10% of its charge in the first 24 hours, and thereafter discharges {{at a rate of}} about 10% a month. However, newer low self-discharge nickel metal hydride (NiMH) batteries and modern lithium designs display a lower self-discharge rate (but still higher than for primary batteries).|$|E

5000|$|Disposable, primary {{flexible}} {{primary batteries}} {{which are the}} equivalent of AA and AAA batteries are also of great interest with applicability in smart cards, medical patches, greeting cards, toys, and disposable devices. Advantages of primary batteries with aqueous electrolyte over lithium ion batteries include their eco friendliness and the ease of fabrication. A flexible zinc-carbon battery using single-walled carbon nanotubes as current was reported by Hiraral in 2010; later in 2013 one with conductive polymer and cheaper multiwalled carbon nanotubes was published by Mitra. Et. al. Binders were used to maintain the flexibility and integrity of electrodes, and the carbon nanotubes dramatically reduced electrode resistance. The primary <b>alkaline</b> <b>battery</b> is more durable than conventional zinc-carbon under heavy load. An <b>alkaline</b> <b>battery</b> uses MnO2 as the active material along with zinc anode and KOH is used as an electrolyte here. A flexible alkaline cell offers several challenges because compared to zinc-carbon cells using weak acidic or neutral electrolytes, KOH is more basic and corrosive.

25|$|Battery {{life can}} be {{extended}} by storing the batteries at a low temperature, as in a refrigerator or freezer, which slows the side reactions. Such storage can {{extend the life of}} <b>alkaline</b> <b>batteries</b> by about 5%; rechargeable batteries can hold their charge much longer, depending upon type. To reach their maximum voltage, batteries must be returned to room temperature; discharging an alkaline battery at 250 mA at 0°C is only half as efficient as at 20°C. Alkaline battery manufacturers such as Duracell do not recommend refrigerating batteries.|$|E

25|$|The {{amount of}} current an <b>alkaline</b> <b>battery</b> can deliver is roughly {{proportional}} to its physical size.

A rule of thumb is that an AA <b>alkaline</b> <b>battery</b> can deliver 700 mA without any significant heating. Larger cells, such as C and D cells, can deliver more current. Applications requiring currents of several amperes, such as powerful flashlights and portable stereos, will require D-sized cells to handle the increased load.|$|R
