5000|$|... "Thank you. Thank {{you very}} much. Thank {{you and good}} evening. The sponsor has been identified, but unlike most {{television}} programs, the performer hasn't been provided with a script. As a matter of fact, I have been permitted to choose my own words and discuss my own ideas regarding the choice that we face {{in the next few}} weeks.I have spent most of my life as a Democrat. I recently have seen fit to follow another course. I believe that the issues confronting us cross party lines. Now, one side in this campaign has been telling us that the issues of this election are the maintenance of peace and prosperity. The line has been used, [...] "We've never had it so good."But I have an uncomfortable feeling that this prosperity isn't something on which we can base our hopes for the future. No nation in history has ever survived a tax burden that reached a third of its national income. Today, 37 cents out of every dollar earned in this country is the tax collector's share, and yet our government continues to spend 17 million dollars a day more than the government takes in. We haven't balanced our budget 28 out of the last 34 years. We've raised our debt limit three times in the last twelve months, and now our national debt is one and a half times bigger than all the combined debts of all the nations of the world. We have 15 billion dollars in gold in our treasury; we don't own an ounce. Foreign dollar claims are 27.3 billion dollars. And we've just had announced that the dollar of 1939 will now purchase 45 cents in its total value.As for the peace that we would preserve, I wonder who among us would like to approach the wife or mother whose husband or son has died in South Vietnam and ask them if they think this is a peace that should be maintained indefinitely. Do they mean peace, or do they mean we just want to be left in peace? There can be no real peace while one American is dying some place in the world for the rest of us. We're at war with the most dangerous enemy that has ever faced mankind in his long climb from the swamp to the stars, and it's been said if we lose that war, and in so doing lose this way of freedom of ours, history will record with the greatest astonishment that those who had the most to lose did the least to prevent its happening. Well I think it's time we ask ourselves if we still know the freedoms that were intended for us by the Founding Fathers.Not too long ago, two friends of mine were talking to a Cuban refugee, a businessman who had escaped from Castro, {{and in the midst of}} his story one of my friends turned to the other and said, [...] "We don't know how lucky we are." [...] And the Cuban stopped and said, [...] "How lucky you are? I had someplace to escape to." [...] And in that sentence he told us the entire story. If we lose freedom here, there's no place to escape to. This is the last stand on earth.And this idea that government is beholden to the people, that it has no other source of power except the sovereign people, is still the newest and the most unique idea in all the long history of man's relation to man.This is the issue of this election: whether we believe in our capacity for self-government or whether we abandon the American revolution and confess that a little intellectual elite in a far-distant capitol can plan our lives for us better than we can plan them ourselves.You and I are told increasingly we have to choose between a left or right. Well I'd like to suggest there is no such thing as a left or right. There's only an up or down: up man's old -- old-aged dream, the ultimate in individual freedom consistent with law and order, or down to the ant heap of totalitarianism. And regardless of their sincerity, their humanitarian motives, those who would trade our freedom for security have embarked on this downward course.In this vote-harvesting time, they use terms like the [...] "Great Society," [...] or as we were told a few days ago by the President, we must accept a greater government activity in the affairs of the people. But they've been a little more explicit in the past and among themselves; and all of the things I now will quote have appeared in print. These are not Republican accusations. For example, they have voices that say, [...] "The cold war will end through our acceptance of a not undemocratic socialism." [...] Another voice says, [...] "The profit motive has become outmoded. It must be replaced by the incentives of the welfare state." [...] Or, [...] "Our traditional system of individual freedom is incapable of solving the complex problems of the 20th century." [...] Senator Fulbright has said at Stanford University that the Constitution is outmoded. He referred to the President as [...] "our moral teacher and our leader," [...] and he says he is [...] "hobbled in his task by the restrictions of power imposed on him by this antiquated document." [...] He must [...] "be freed," [...] so that he [...] "can do for us" [...] what he knows [...] "is best." [...] And Senator Clark of Pennsylvania, another articulate spokesman, defines liberalism as [...] "meeting the material needs of the masses through the full power of centralized government."Well, I, for one, resent it when a representative of the people refers to you and me, the free men and women of this country, as [...] "the masses." [...] This is a term we haven't applied to ourselves in America. But beyond that, [...] "the full power of centralized government" [...] -- this was the very thing the Founding Fathers sought to minimize. They knew that governments don't control things. A government can't control the economy without controlling people. And they know when a government sets out to do that, it must use force and coercion to achieve its purpose. They also knew, those Founding Fathers, that outside of its legitimate functions, government does nothing as well or as economically as the private sector of the economy.Now, we have no better example of this than government's involvement in the farm economy over the last 30 years. Since 1955, the cost of this program has nearly doubled. One-fourth of farming in America is responsible for 85% of the farm surplus. Three-fourths of farming is out on the free market and has known a 21% increase in the per capita consumption of all its produce. You see, that one-fourth of farming -- that's regulated and controlled by the federal government. In the last three years we've spent 43 dollars in the feed grain program for every dollar bushel of corn we don't grow.Senator Humphrey last week charged that Barry Goldwater, as President, would seek to eliminate farmers. He should do his homework a little better, because he'll find out that we've had a decline of 5 million in the farm population under these government programs. He'll also find that the Democratic administration has sought to get from Congress an extension of the farm program to include that three-fourths that is now free. He'll find that they've also asked for the right to imprison farmers who wouldn't keep books as prescribed by the federal government. The Secretary of Agriculture asked for the right to seize farms through condemnation and resell them to other individuals. And contained in that same program was a provision that would have allowed the federal government to remove 2 million farmers from the soil.At the same time, there's been an increase in the Department of Agriculture employees. There's now one for every 30 farms in the United States, and still they can't tell us how 66 shiploads of grain headed for Austria disappeared without a trace and Billie Sol Estes never left shore.Every responsible farmer and farm organization has repeatedly asked the government to free the farm economy, but how -- who are farmers to know what's best for them? The wheat farmers voted against a wheat program. The government passed it anyway. Now the price of bread goes up; the price of wheat to the farmer goes down.Meanwhile, back in the city, under urban renewal the assault on freedom carries on. Private property rights are so diluted that public interest is almost anything a few government planners decide it should be. In a program that takes from the needy and gives to the greedy, we see such spectacles as in Cleveland, Ohio, a million-and-a-half-dollar building completed only three years ago must be destroyed to make way for what government officials call a [...] "more compatible use of the land." [...] The President tells us he's now going to start building public housing units in the thousands, where heretofore we've only built them in the hundreds. But FHA Housing Authority and the Veterans Administration tell us they have 120,000 housing units they've taken back through mortgage foreclosure. For three decades, we've sought to solve the problems of unemployment through government planning, and the more the plans fail, the more the planners plan. The latest is the Area Redevelopment Agency.They've just declared Rice County, Kansas, a depressed area. Rice County, Kansas, has two hundred oil wells, and the 14,000 people there have over 30 million dollars on deposit in personal savings in their banks. And when the government tells you you're depressed, lie down and be depressed.We have so many people who can't see a fat man standing beside a thin one without coming to the conclusion the fat man got that way by taking advantage of the thin one. So they're going to solve all the problems of human misery through government and government planning. Well, now, if government planning and welfare had the answer -- and they've had almost 30 years of it -- shouldn't we expect government to read the score to us once in a while? Shouldn't they be telling us about the decline each year in the number of people needing help? The reduction in the need for public housing?But the reverse is true. Each year the need grows greater; the program grows greater. We were told four years ago that 17 million people went to bed hungry each night. Well that was probably true. They were all on a diet. But now we're told that 9.3 million families in this country are poverty-stricken on the basis of earning less than 3,000 dollars a year. Welfare spending is 10 times greater than in the dark depths of the Depression. We're spending 45 billion dollars on welfare. Now do a little arithmetic, and you'll find that if we divided the 45 billion dollars up equally among those 9 million poor families, we'd be able to give each family 4,600 dollars a year. And this added to their present income should eliminate poverty. Direct aid to the poor, however, is only running only about 600 dollars per family. It would seem that someplace there must be some overhead.Now -- so now we declare [...] "war on poverty," [...] or [...] "You, too, can be a Bobby Baker." [...] Now do they honestly expect us to believe that if we add 1 billion dollars to the 45 billion we're spending, one more program to the 30-odd we have -- and remember, this new program doesn't replace any, it just duplicates existing programs -- do they believe that poverty is suddenly going to disappear by magic? Well, in all fairness I should explain there is one part of the new program that isn't duplicated. This is the youth feature. We're now going to solve the dropout problem, juvenile delinquency, by reinstituting something like the old CCC camps Conservation Corps, and we're going to put our young people in these camps. But again we do some arithmetic, and we find that we're going to spend each year just on room and board for each young person we help 4,700 dollars a year. We can send them to Harvard for 2,700! Course, don't get me wrong. I'm not suggesting Harvard is the answer to juvenile delinquency.But seriously, what are we doing to those we seek to help? Not too long ago, a judge called me here in Los Angeles. He told me of a young woman who'd come before him for a divorce. She had six children, was pregnant with her seventh. Under his questioning, she revealed her husband was a laborer earning 250 dollars a month. She wanted a divorce to get an 80 dollar raise. She's eligible for 330 dollars a month in the Aid to Dependent Children Program. She got the idea from two women in her neighborhood who'd already done that very thing.Yet anytime you and I question the schemes of the do-gooders, we're denounced as being against their humanitarian goals. They say we're always [...] "against" [...] things -- we're never [...] "for" [...] anything.Well, the trouble with our liberal friends is not that they're ignorant; it's just that they know so much that isn't so.Now -- we're for a provision that destitution should not follow unemployment by reason of old age, and to that end we've accepted Social Security as a step toward meeting the problem.But we're against those entrusted with this program when they practice deception regarding its fiscal shortcomings, when they charge that any criticism of the program means that we want to end payments to those people who depend on them for a livelihood. They've called it [...] "insurance" [...] to us in a hundred million pieces of literature. But then they appeared before the Supreme Court and they testified it was a welfare program. They only use the term [...] "insurance" [...] to sell it to the people. And they said Social Security dues are a tax for the general use of the government, and the government has used that tax. There is no fund, because Robert Byers, the actuarial head, appeared before a congressional committee and admitted that Social Security as of this moment is 298 billion dollars in the hole. But he said there should be no cause for worry because as long as they have the power to tax, they could always take away from the people whatever they needed to bail them out of trouble. And they're doing just that.A young man, 21 years of age, working at an average salary -- his Social Security contribution would, in the open market, buy him an insurance policy that would guarantee 220 dollars a month at age 65. The government promises 127. He could live it up until he's 31 and then take out a policy that would pay more than Social Security. Now are we so lacking in business sense that we can't put this program on a sound basis, so that people who do require those payments will find they can get them when they're due -- that the cupboard isn't bare?Barry Goldwater thinks we can.At the same time, can't we introduce voluntary features that would permit a citizen who can do better on his own to be excused upon presentation of evidence that he had made provision for the non-earning years? Should we not allow a widow with children to work, and not lose the benefits supposedly paid for by her deceased husband? Shouldn't you and I be allowed to declare who our beneficiaries will be under this program, which we cannot do? I think we're for telling our senior citizens that no one in this country should be denied medical care because of a lack of funds. But I think we're against forcing all citizens, regardless of need, into a compulsory government program, especially when we have such examples, as was <b>announced</b> <b>last</b> <b>week,</b> when France admitted that their Medicare program is now bankrupt. They've come to the end of the road.In addition, was Barry Goldwater so irresponsible when he suggested that our government give up its program of deliberate, planned inflation, so that when you do get your Social Security pension, a dollar will buy a dollar's worth, and not 45 cents worth?I think we're for an international organization, where the nations of the world can seek peace. But I think we're against subordinating American interests to an organization that has become so structurally unsound that today you can muster a two-thirds vote on the floor of the General Assembly among nations that represent less than 10 percent of the world's population. I think we're against the hypocrisy of assailing our allies because here and there they cling to a colony, while we engage in a conspiracy of silence and never open our mouths about the millions of people enslaved in the Soviet colonies in the satellite nations.I think we're for aiding our allies by sharing of our material blessings with those nations which share in our fundamental beliefs, but we're against doling out money government to government, creating bureaucracy, if not socialism, all over the world. We set out to help 19 countries. We're helping 107. We've spent 146 billion dollars. With that money, we bought a 2 million dollar yacht for Haile Selassie. We bought dress suits for Greek undertakers, extra wives for Kenyan government officials. We bought a thousand TV sets for a place where they have no electricity. In the last six years, 52 nations have bought 7 billion dollars worth of our gold, and all 52 are receiving foreign aid from this country.No government ever voluntarily reduces itself in size. So, governments' programs, once launched, never disappear.Actually, a government bureau is the nearest thing to eternal life we'll ever see on this earth.Federal employees -- federal employees number two and a half million; and federal, state, and local, one out of six of the nation's work force employed by government. These proliferating bureaus with their thousands of regulations have cost us many of our constitutional safeguards. How many of us realize that today federal agents can invade a man's property without a warrant? They can impose a fine without a formal hearing, let alone a trial by jury? And they can seize and sell his property at auction to enforce the payment of that fine. In Chico County, Arkansas, James Wier over-planted his rice allotment. The government obtained a 17,000 dollar judgment. And a U.S. marshal sold his 960-acre farm at auction. The government said it was necessary as a warning to others to make the system work.Last February 19th at the University of Minnesota, Norman Thomas, six-times candidate for President on the Socialist Party ticket, said, [...] "If Barry Goldwater became President, he would stop the advance of socialism in the United States." [...] I think that's exactly what he will do.But as a former Democrat, I can tell you Norman Thomas isn't the only man who has drawn this parallel to socialism with the present administration, because back in 1936, Mr. Democrat himself, Al Smith, the great American, came before the American people and charged that the leadership of his Party was taking the Party of Jefferson, Jackson, and Cleveland down the road under the banners of Marx, Lenin, and Stalin. And he walked away from his Party, and he never returned til the day he died -- because to this day, the leadership of that Party has been taking that Party, that honorable Party, down the road in the image of the labor Socialist Party of England.Now it doesn't require expropriation or confiscation of private property or business to impose socialism on a people. What does it mean whether you hold the deed to the -- or the title to your business or property if the government holds the power of life and death over that business or property? And such machinery already exists. The government can find some charge to bring against any concern it chooses to prosecute. Every businessman has his own tale of harassment. Somewhere a perversion has taken place. Our natural, unalienable rights are now considered to be a dispensation of government, and freedom has never been so fragile, so close to slipping from our grasp as it is at this moment.Our Democratic opponents seem unwilling to debate these issues. They want to make you and I believe that this is a contest between two men -- that we're to choose just between two personalities.Well what of this man that they would destroy -- and in destroying, they would destroy that which he represents, the ideas that you and I hold dear? Is he the brash and shallow and trigger-happy man they say he is? Well I've been privileged to know him [...] "when." [...] I knew him long before he ever dreamed of trying for high office, and I can tell you personally I've never known a man in my life I believed so incapable of doing a dishonest or dishonorable thing.This is a man who, in his own business before he entered politics, instituted a profit-sharing plan before unions had ever thought of it. He put in health and medical insurance for all his employees. He took 50 percent of the profits before taxes and set up a retirement program, a pension plan for all his employees. He sent monthly checks for life to an employee who was ill and couldn't work. He provides nursing care for the children of mothers who work in the stores. When Mexico was ravaged by the floods in the Rio Grande, he climbed in his airplane and flew medicine and supplies down there.An ex-GI told me how he met him. It was the week before Christmas during the Korean War, and he was at the Los Angeles airport trying to get a ride home to Arizona for Christmas. And he said that were a lot of servicemen there and no seats available on the planes. And then a voice came over the loudspeaker and said, [...] "Any men in uniform wanting a ride to Arizona, go to runway such-and-such," [...] and they went down there, and there was a fellow named Barry Goldwater sitting in his plane. Every day in those weeks before Christmas, all day long, he'd load up the plane, fly it to Arizona, fly them to their homes, fly back over to get another load.During the hectic split-second timing of a campaign, this is a man who took time out to sit beside an old friend who was dying of cancer. His campaign managers were understandably impatient, but he said, [...] "There aren't many left who care what happens to her. I'd like her to know I care." [...] This is a man who said to his 19-year-old son, [...] "There is no foundation like the rock of honesty and fairness, and when you begin to build your life on that rock, with the cement of the faith in God that you have, then you have a real start." [...] This is not a man who could carelessly send other people's sons to war. And that is the issue of this campaign that makes all the other problems I've discussed academic, unless we realize we're in a war that must be won.Those who would trade our freedom for the soup kitchen of the welfare state have told us they have a utopian solution of peace without victory. They call their policy [...] "accommodation." [...] And they say if we'll only avoid any direct confrontation with the enemy, he'll forget his evil ways and learn to love us. All who oppose them are indicted as warmongers. They say we offer simple answers to complex problems. Well, perhaps there is a simple answer -- not an easy answer -- but simple: If you and I have the courage to tell our elected officials that we want our national policy based on what we know in our hearts is morally right.We cannot buy our security, our freedom from the threat of the bomb by committing an immorality so great as saying to a billion human beings now enslaved behind the Iron Curtain, [...] "Give up your dreams of freedom because to save our own skins, we're willing to make a deal with your slave masters." [...] Alexander Hamilton said, [...] "A nation which can prefer disgrace to danger is prepared for a master, and deserves one." [...] Now let's set the record straight. There's no argument over the choice between peace and war, but there's only one guaranteed way you can have peace -- and you can have it in the next second -- surrender.Admittedly, there's a risk in any course we follow other than this, but every lesson of history tells us that the greater risk lies in appeasement, and this is the specter our well-meaning liberal friends refuse to face -- that their policy of accommodation is appeasement, and it gives no choice between peace and war, only between fight or surrender. If we continue to accommodate, continue to back and retreat, eventually we have to face the final demand -- the ultimatum. And what then -- when Nikita Khrushchev has told his people he knows what our answer will be? He has told them that we're retreating under the pressure of the Cold War, and someday when the time comes to deliver the final ultimatum, our surrender will be voluntary, because by that time we will have been weakened from within spiritually, morally, and economically. He believes this because from our side he's heard voices pleading for [...] "peace at any price" [...] or [...] "better Red than dead," [...] or as one commentator put it, he'd rather [...] "live on his knees than die on his feet." [...] And therein lies the road to war, because those voices don't speak for the rest of us.You and I know and do not believe that life is so dear and peace so sweet as to be purchased at the price of chains and slavery. If nothing in life is worth dying for, when did this begin -- just in the face of this enemy? Or should Moses have told the children of Israel to live in slavery under the pharaohs? Should Christ have refused the cross? Should the patriots at Concord Bridge have thrown down their guns and refused to fire the shot heard 'round the world? The martyrs of history were not fools, and our honored dead who gave their lives to stop the advance of the Nazis didn't die in vain. Where, then, is the road to peace? Well it's a simple answer after all.You and I have the courage to say to our enemies, [...] "There is a price we will not pay." [...] "There is a point beyond which they must not advance." [...] And this -- this is the meaning in the phrase of Barry Goldwater's [...] "peace through strength." [...] Winston Churchill said, [...] "The destiny of man is not measured by material computations. When great forces are on the move in the world, we learn we're spirits -- not animals." [...] And he said, [...] "There's something going on in time and space, and beyond time and space, which, whether we like it or not, spells duty."You and I have a rendezvous with destiny.We'll preserve for our children this, the last best hope of man on earth, or we'll sentence them to take the last step into a thousand years of darkness.We will keep in mind and remember that Barry Goldwater has faith in us. He has faith that you and I have the ability and the dignity and the right to make our own decisions and determine our own destiny.Thank you very much." ...|$|E

40|$|A bad Newspoll result {{suggests}} that Malcolm Turnbull has provoked the economic anxieties of the electorate. The question is: why? NEWSPOLL has shifted two points in two-party-preferred terms {{over the past}} fortnight, putting Labor slightly ahead, at 51 – 49, {{for the first time}} since Malcolm Turnbull became prime minister. Within Australia’s version of the beltway, this has set off several clanging bells. As a general rule, attempting to identify the drivers of fluctuations in individual opinion polls is a mug’s game. Surveys bob up and down for no real reason, or they’re pushed by deeper underlying dynamics or events from weeks or months ago. I’ve noted here before that Newspoll’s preference flows are probably overly generous to Labor; today’s primary vote numbers (Coalition on 41, Labor on 36, Greens 11 and others 12) would at most elections produce a likely 50 – 50 after preferences. And if this were a move from 57 to 55 rather than 51 to 49, no one would be flicking the drama switch. But sometimes, on rare occasions, poll shifts can reasonably be assigned to particular occurrences, and this is very likely one of them.

40|$|Noun Clauses, English GrammarThis {{lesson was}} {{developed}} by John Nelson and Tymofey Wowk, 2012 Making English Grammar Meaningful and Useful Mini Lesson # 16 Noun Clauses: Useful Structures for Gossip The purpose of this lesson is to present characteristics of Noun Clauses. Noun Clauses are word groups that are the subjects or objects of sentences {{in which they are}} found. When they are sentence subjects, they are followed by the main verb of the sentence. When they follow the main verb of a sentence, they are usually objects of the sentences in which they are found. The two possible noun clause types are illustrated with these sentences: That he would speak at the conference was <b>announced</b> <b>last</b> <b>week.</b> Last week the president announced that he would speak at the conference. Notice that the Connector ‘that’ is used for both Noun Clauses. In some cases when the Noun Clause is the object of the sentence, the Connector can be deleted. This is the case with the second example above. You can delete the word ‘that’ from the sentence. Other Connectors often used with Noun Clauses are the words 'if', 'whether' and WH-question words such as 'when', 'where', 'why', etc. Noun Clauses are often used in an English structure known as Reported Speech where a speaker wants to report what another speaker has said. These are some examples of Reported Speech: The student said that the homework was very difficult. The teacher asked how many students had finished the homework. Most of the students said that they had finished the homework. One particular problem with Reported Speech is when a reporter wants to report a question that someone else has asked. There is a tendency to keep the question structure in the reported speech instead of converting it to a statement structure. Look at the following example. The third sentence illustrates this problem. The mother said, "What time did you get home last night?" The mother asked her daughter what time she got home last night. The mother asked her daughter what time did she get home last night. This lesson {{was developed by}} John Nelson and Tymofey Wowk, 2012 Notice that there is only a question when the mother asked it. When the question is reported, it is a statement, not a question. The third sentence is not grammatical. Noun Clauses are often used with verbs like 'hope', 'wish', 'think', ‘know’ 'understand', and similar verbs...|$|E
40|$|There’s {{one area}} where the free trade {{agreement}} could make a big difference, argues John Edwards BECAUSE Australian and US manufacturing tariffs are already very low and because the US concessions in agriculture are limited, I doubt {{the free trade agreement}} between Australia and the US <b>announced</b> <b>last</b> <b>week</b> will have much more than a marginal impact on Australian trade with the US, let alone on economic growth. It is a useful agreement but both its opponents and supporters have wildly exaggerated its significance. It should over time be somewhat easier for Australian firms to compete in the US services markets and new access to the US government procurement market will be helpful, but nothing in the agreement on goods and services will validate Prime Minister John Howard’s claim that it will set Australia up for the next half century. There is, however, {{one area where}} the agreement will make a difference, and that is in the liberalisation of Australia’s foreign investment regime. It is true that Australia has continued to reserve urban land, air transport, telecommunications, defence and media from the new rules, and that it will maintain existing foreign ownership restrictions for Telstra, Qantas, CSL and airports. It is also true that even under the agreement the Australian Treasurer retains the right to reject on national interest grounds proposed takeovers of Australian firms by US firms, although the threshold at which a bid needs to be notified to the Foreign Investment Review Board (FIRB) has been increased from $ 50 m to $ 800 m. And finally it is true that of 4747 foreign investment applications made to FIRB last financial year, only 79 or 2 per cent were rejected, a rate which suggests the FIRB constraint was not binding. All that said, the changes are much more sweeping than has been generally understood. Once the agreement comes into force, there will be no requirement to notify FIRB of any US investment in Australia which does not involve the takeover of any existing company. Currently any such investment of over $ 10 million needs to be notified, which means it is potentially subject to the Treasurer’s power to determine if it is in the national interest. It does not mean the usually environmental or other policies would not apply, but it does mean the proposed US investment would be treated exactly like a proposed Australian investment. While the Treasurer retains the right to reject takeover proposals from US interests for Australian companies, the increase in the notification threshold from $ 50 million to $ 800 million makes a big difference. Most major Australian companies have a market capitalisation considerably greater than $ 800 million. But there are 1400 listed companies on the ASX, and once the top 100 are excluded the average market of the remainder is $ 70 million. This is above the existing threshold, but nowhere near the new threshold. US companies will now be able to make offers for the great majority of Australian listed companies without needing to notify the FIRB. It has been rightly the FIRB approves nearly every application made to it. But of those approved last year, three-quarters were approved only with conditions. For takeovers of industrial companies these conditions may include requirements for a local board, a local CEO, or for commitments to R&D or manufacturing facilities. Under the new rules there will be no conditions for bids under $ 800 m, and no notification will be required. And while a takeover above that threshold requires approval, the acquisition of a blocking sake against other predators may not. Under Australian law an interest can acquire 19 per cent of a listed company before being required to make an offer for the remainder. Under the proposed FTA rules, a US company would presumably acquire 19 per cent of a $ 3. 2 billion company without being required to notify FIRB. Since FIRB notification automatically involves the disclosure to the targeted company of the predators intention, the new rules will be considerably more convenient for predators. When the new rules are operating they will be extremely discriminatory, since they apply only to US firms. When an Australian target is defending against a foreign predator it is quite common to make the case to FIRB that the offer is against the national interest. The target knows the case will be rejected, but it also knows it will achieve a delay which allows it to construct a more effective defence. Under the new rules the US firm will not face this impediment. But if the Australian firm seeks a white knight which happens to be British or New Zealand or German or Japanese, the white knight will be compelled to go through the FIRB processes. It seems to me this is not a sustainable position. It is all the more delicate because Australia already has understandings with New Zealand and with Japan that those countries will enjoy the most favourable investment rules into Australia which apply to any other country. It is highly likely therefore that within a few years the newly liberal rules will apply to all intending investors, and the role of FIRB will be whittled down to very large transactions, and those sectors which continue to be reserved. There is even a possibility that the Treasurer’s discretionary authority to refuse takeovers on national interest grounds will be exposed to some public review, which is not the case today.

40|$|Fears {{that such}} a rights charter would {{infringe}} our liberties ignore {{the voices of the}} vulnerable and dispossessed, writes Caroline FleayWHILE the Rudd government <b>announced</b> <b>last</b> <b>week</b> that it supports calls for human rights education and greater scrutiny of legislation that might breach human rights, it stopped short of supporting a charter of rights. Clearly the government is nervous about being seen to be too supportive of this approach to protecting freedoms and entitlements. This nervousness no doubt reflects the fears that have been publicly expressed since the Brennan committee reported to the federal government last September. The report followed the national human rights consultations held throughout Australia last year and its recommendations include a federal charter of human rights. If you have missed the subsequent commentary, let me give you some of the highlights. In a measured rejection of calls for a human rights charter, earlier this year journalist Paul Kelly argued that the majority of Australians do not want such legislation. In a not-so-measured response, lawyer James Allen described the national human rights consultations process as “one-sided hocus pocus”. Elise Parham from the Centre for Independent Studies {{went so far as to}} declare that adopting such a charter would result in a “Shakespearean tragedy”. She cautioned that, unlike other laws, a charter’s rights could directly influence the actions of government and the judiciary, and indirectly affect the actions of those in business and the community. But surely human rights legislation should set reasonable limits over the actions of government and other actors? This seems to be the crux of the concerns of these critics of a charter, and was made most explicit in Joe Hockey’s claim last month that “personal and social liberties are being trampled in the pursuit of human rights”. The theme emerging is a fear about what will happen if federal legislative protections for human rights in Australia are adopted. Or, to put it less kindly, a desire to incite fear about what will happen if a human rights charter was to be adopted – namely, that our individual liberties would be dangerously limited by any substantive articulation of human rights in federal legislation. This is an understanding of individual liberties rooted in the liberalism of the Enlightenment. For these philosophers it was important that individuals retained a sphere of freedom in their lives within which government could not interfere. Indeed, one of the purposes of government was to protect such a sphere of freedom in order for individuals to be able to pursue their version of the good life. Of course, there ensued much debate about the extent of such individual liberties. John Stuart Mill, Hockey’s favourite philosopher, argued that there should be limits on our individual liberties when their pursuit threatens the liberties of others. That is, individuals should only be free to pursue their version of the good life to the extent that they do not prevent others from doing so. John Stuart Mill was onto something. We need to accept some restraints on our behaviours to ensure we don’t unnecessarily infringe the freedoms of others. But how should we articulate what these restraints should be?  This is where the language of human rights can help. Human rights is based on the assumption that as humans we all share certain rights that need to be realised for us to live a life of dignity. This includes the liberties considered important by the Enlightenment liberals – civil and political rights such as freedoms of expression, religion and association, and the right to participate in the political life of your society. But the human rights language has also evolved to include economic, social and cultural rights, such as rights to adequate housing, education and healthcare, and to access the culture of your community. Similarly, the right to self-determination has come to be considered important for being able to live a life of dignity. It is this broad inclusion of human rights that has given this language its potency for vulnerable members of societies. The language of human rights has been adopted by a growing number of the dispossessed and politically vulnerable to assert their claims for a life of dignity. Some of their voices were heard in the national human rights consultations. By asserting that we are all rights-holders, the language of human rights places obligations on others to respect and protect our rights, particularly governments. Conceiving of everyone as rights-holders gives agency to those who are vulnerable and least able to access what they need to live a life of dignity. It provides an important alternative to notions of charity where resources allocated to the vulnerable depend almost totally on the benevolence of those who can afford or have the power to give. Human rights recognises that how we treat the vulnerable in our society is one of the most important measures of our humanity. In a society that is based on the rule of law, surely we should be interested in passing laws that recognise we all have rights to what we need to live a life of dignity. These laws should include the broad range of human rights – not just the individual liberties articulated in civil and political rights, but also social, economic and cultural rights, and the right to self-determination. Fears {{that such a}} human rights charter would infringe our individual liberties ignore the voices of the vulnerable and dispossessed. They may not be the majority in Australia but it is up to us all to acknowledge their importance as fellow humans. •Caroline Fleay is a lecturer at the Centre for Human Rights Education at Curtin University...|$|E
40|$|Frank Lowy’s move {{to fund a}} {{new policy}} {{institute}} is bold and creative, says Michael Liffman IT MAY BE no coincidence that within days of being listed as one of Australia’s richest men, Frank Lowy <b>announced</b> <b>last</b> <b>week</b> a personal gift of 30 million {{for the establishment of}} a new policy institute focusing on Australia 2 ̆ 7 s place in the world. In so doing Lowy is embodying a local variant of a peculiarly American story. His ascent from refugee holocaust survivor to billionaire property developer and retailer will be admired by many and viewed askance by some, but his willingness to be a bold philanthropist has much to offer this country. For the past century and more, the US has demonstrated a culture and practice of philanthropy on a scale, and a level of maturity, as yet unknown in this country. The consequences, in terms of the enrichment of public facilities for research and education, culture, and policy debate, are embedded in the very fabric of American society. They range from prestigious organisations such as the Ford Foundation to the countless endowments through which college alumni make education more affordable. The foundation Bill Gates established, focused on children 2 ̆ 7 s health in underdeveloped countries, is one of the world’s biggest, and recently CNN founder Ted Turner reaffirmed his intention to contribute US 1 billion (A 1. 5 billion) to the United Nations Foundation during the next 10 years. Some manifestations of America’s traditional commitment to giving would probably strike some as a little bizarre. Ruth Lilly, the 87 -year-old heiress to the Eli Lilly pharmaceutical fortune, recently made a US 100 million (A 150 million) donation to the Modern Poetry Association. But more typical and common, and, by US standards, so unremarkable that it rated only a brief mention in the US-based fortnightly newspaper, The Chronicle of Philanthropy, is the US 220 million (A 340 million) given by Thomas S. Monaghan, the founder of Domino’s Pizza, to create a Catholic university in Florida. American philanthropy is a major force in the nation and, as such, is not without the inevitable complexities of a vigorous and mature industry. Disenchanted donor Paul Glenn is litigating to secure the return of his US 1. 6 million (A 2. 5 million) gift to the University of Southern California, claiming it was not applied to his intended purpose, researching the biology of ageing. A major contributor to another university is demanding its trustees resign on grounds of incompetence, and is ceasing all his support to other causes until they do. The American Association of Museums has issued a code of ethics governing dealings with donors in the face of controversies such as those, which arose when New York’s Guggenheim Museum staged an exhibition of Georgio Armani clothes while receiving a US 15 million (A 23 million) gift from the fashion designer. Some charities are objecting to the activities of a number of charity watch-dogs that have emerged during recent years, which offer potential donors, sometimes for a fee, a detailed financial and performance assessment of the countless charities competing for their dollar. In Congress a debate is looming on the Bush plan to make it easier for religious charities to compete for federal grants, with some critics fearing an inappropriate mix of church and state, and concerned at the possible exclusion of Muslim communities from the first round of funding. Nor does everyone agree with the dominant position held by private giving in the US. Implicit in this role are assumptions many Australians would question as to the responsibilities of government, and the place of private generosity, in shaping the welfare, cultural and public policy arrangements of the state. Nevertheless fund-raisers, and those managing our seemingly evermore unaffordable educational, research and cultural institutions, can only stand in awe of the products of a philanthropic practice so deeply and unapologetically embedded in American society. Yet even here the Americans surprise us. A prominent American recently launched a campaign opposing President George W. Bush’s push to repeal estate (ie, death) duties. The wealthy, he insists, have an obligation to pay a higher share of taxes, as ‘there 2 ̆ 7 s no such thing as a self-made millionaire’. The same forces that are driving philanthropy in the US are increasingly to be seen in Australia: new patterns of wealth and the ascendancy of the privileged ‘baby-boomer’ generation, an awareness that progress in living standards during recent decades has not assuaged the challenges communities the world over face, a retreat by government from social expenditures, and growing pressure on business to demonstrate real corporate citizenship. Australia does have a pantheon of distinguished philanthropists, past and present, sung and unsung, such as Alfred Felton, Sidney Myer and the Myer family, Richard Pratt, and many others. In entering this territory Lowy’s gift, large as it is, is not the largest. More interesting than its size is the fact that it is such a dramatic departure from usual Australian practice in which large donors direct their generosity towards a cause or an existing organisation which is uncontroversial, and whose outcomes will be reasonably evident and assured, and, usually, can be seen in ‘bricks and mortar’. The Lowy donation is closer to the American spirit where philanthropy drives pluralism and social experiment. Australia has few institutions of the sort Lowy is establishing and probably none resourced on as substantial a basis as should be possible for his. Assuming the pursuits of the institute Lowy proposes are open-minded, and its operations transparent, perhaps an equivalent to the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace may result from his vision. Australia will be the better for such far-sighted philanthropy. Dr Liffman is director of the Asia-Pacific Centre for Philanthropy and Social Investment at Swinburne University.
