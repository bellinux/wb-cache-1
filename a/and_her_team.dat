5|$|American Express {{had been}} in discussions to {{potentially}} live stream Lady Gaga's performance during Sunday's ArtRave event. American Express decided not {{to proceed with the}} live stream because of an inability to reach a mutual agreement on the production of the event. However, American Express honored its commitments to Lady Gaga <b>and</b> <b>her</b> <b>team,</b> and the event was able to proceed without an official role for American Express. Lady Gaga is an incredible artist and we hope to work together in the future.|$|E
5|$|During {{offensive}} {{operations at}} Saint-Mihiel, though artillery bombing was in force, Banker <b>and</b> <b>her</b> <b>team</b> of operators manned the switchboards. When the First Army headquarters moved to Bar-le-Duc in September, Banker and her operators {{had to work}} in a place which was damaged extensively. They operated even under heavy bombing by German planes, but no team members were injured. They worked under severe weather conditions without heating, and their barracks leaked, and were later gutted, making conditions even harsher.|$|E
5|$|Henry was Catherine's {{favourite}} son. Unlike his brothers, {{he came to}} {{the throne}} as a grown man. He was also healthier, though he suffered from weak lungs and constant fatigue. His interest in the tasks of government, however, proved fitful. He depended on Catherine <b>and</b> <b>her</b> <b>team</b> of secretaries until the last few weeks of her life. He often hid from state affairs, immersing himself in acts of piety, such as pilgrimages and flagellation.|$|E

After finding the victim's daughter, Jenny (Abigail Hawk) and her husband Dean (Tom Pelphrey) with the victim's money, this leads them to suspect many of Callum's acquantices. Meanwhile, Megan's daughter, Lacey (Mary Mouser), goes to Megan's work, for a school project.|$|E
5|$|After Leo Varadkar succeeded Kenny as Taoiseach in June 2017, McEntee was {{appointed}} as Minister of State for European Affairs, a role with some {{involvement in the}} United Kingdom's Brexit process. She was one of seven women appointed to Varadkar's cabinet. Shortly after taking up the position she travelled with Varadkar to Brussels for an EU leaders summit, which included talks with German Chancellor Angela Merkel <b>and</b> <b>her</b> <b>team.</b> In September 2017, she addressed a conference at Dublin City University to mark {{the foundation of the}} university's Brexit Institute. The event was also attended by UK Labour Party politician Hilary Armstrong.|$|E
5|$|Assuming {{that the}} true mass is the minimum mass, the radius may be {{calculated}} using various models. For example, if Gliese 581c is a rocky planet with a large iron core, it should have a radius approximately 50% larger than that of Earth, according to Udry's team. Gravity on such a planet's surface would be approximately 2.24 times as strong as on Earth. However, if Gliese 581c is an icy and/or watery planet, its radius would be less than 2 times that of Earth, even with a very large outer hydrosphere, according to density models compiled by Diana Valencia <b>and</b> <b>her</b> <b>team</b> for Gliese 876 d. Gravity {{on the surface of}} such an icy and/or watery planet would be at least 1.25 times as strong as on Earth.|$|E
50|$|Most of the {{popularity}} of the series came from the tension of whether Rice <b>and</b> <b>her</b> <b>teams</b> of volunteers would accomplish their tasks before the deadlines set.

5|$|Four years later, with Drumlin {{seeking to}} close SETI, Arroway discovers a signal repeating a {{sequence}} of prime numbers, apparently sent from the star system Vega some 26 light-years away. This announcement causes Drumlin and the National Security Council led by Michael Kitz to attempt {{to take control of}} the facility. Arroway's team then discover a video buried in the signal: Adolf Hitler's opening address at the 1936 Summer Olympics in Berlin. Arroway <b>and</b> <b>her</b> <b>team</b> postulate that this would have been the first television signal strong enough to leave Earth's atmosphere, taking 26 years to reach Vega and then being transmitted back from there.|$|E
5|$|Gair has now {{developed}} a style {{as a body}} painter. Her typical job takes her <b>and</b> <b>her</b> <b>team</b> eight hours, but some jobs take twice that. She does not charge by the hour. Gair is always well prepared for her jobs, but does not generally sketch her work on paper. In fact, she claims to have only had to do so twice in over twenty years of body painting. When she needs to test something out she usually uses her opposite (left) arm or hand.|$|E
5|$|In Asgard, Loki betrays {{and kills}} Laufey, {{revealing}} his true {{plan to use}} Laufey's attempt on Odin's life {{as an excuse to}} destroy Jotunheim with the Bifröst Bridge, thus proving himself worthy to his adoptive father. Thor arrives and fights Loki before destroying the Bifröst Bridge to stop Loki's plan, stranding himself in Asgard. Odin awakens and prevents the brothers from falling into the abyss created {{in the wake of the}} bridge's destruction, but Loki allows himself to fall when Odin rejects his pleas for approval. Thor makes amends with Odin, admitting he is not ready to be king; while on Earth, Jane <b>and</b> <b>her</b> <b>team</b> search for a way to open a portal to Asgard.|$|E

5|$|In the Demi's Birthday Suit August 1992 {{issue of}} Vanity Fair, Moore was {{shown on the}} cover in the body {{painting}} photo by Joanne Gair. The painting is a memorable example of modern body painting artwork. It made Gair an immediate pop culture star as the most prominent body paint artist, which prompted consideration for an Absolut Vodka Absolut Gair ad campaign. The 1992 cover, which required a thirteen-hour sitting for Gair <b>and</b> <b>her</b> <b>team</b> of make-up artists, was a commemoration of the August 1991 photo. Leibovitz could not decide where to shoot, and reserved two mobile homes, four hotel rooms and five houses.|$|E
5|$|In the {{parallel}} universe, Walternate's machine has been detected by the Fringe division and Fauxlivia <b>and</b> <b>her</b> <b>team</b> go to investigate. When Walternate {{tells them to}} stand down, Fauxilivia asks him about her recent mission to the prime universe and the part that she recovered. Walternate admits {{to her that the}} machine has been activated, having sacrificed his own son Peter to allow Fauxlivia's son to live. Fauxlivia becomes distressed at Walternate's actions, and later returns to Liberty Island to obtain the devices to allow her to cross to the prime universe, but is caught before she can use them. Walternate locks her away, seeing her as a traitor to his cause.|$|E
5|$|On {{arrival in}} Paris, Banker <b>and</b> <b>her</b> <b>team</b> were posted to the {{headquarters}} of the Advance Section in Chaumont sur Haute Marne, which was then {{the headquarters of}} General John J. Pershing. Five months later, Baker was asked to move to the war front, to the First Army headquarters at Ligny-en-Barrois, south of Saint-Mihiel. On 25 August 1918, she moved to the war front with only five operators helping her. For this operation at Saint-Mihiel, Banker had to make a choice of the best operators for the job, she selected: Suzanne Prevot, Esther Fresnel, Helen Hill, Berthe Hunt, and Marie Lange. Equipped with gas masks and helmets, the women operated from trenches where the danger was real; despite this, those not chosen to go felt left out.|$|E

5|$|Sixteen {{years before}} Oceanic 815 crashes on the island, Rousseau was a heavily {{pregnant}} {{member of a}} six-person crew aboard a French research vessel three days out of Tahiti. The crew picked up a radio signal emanating from the South Pacific, which was a repeating set of six numbers: 4, 8, 15, 16, 23 and 42. While attempting to find {{the source of the}} signal, the ship ran aground on rocks surrounding the island. Before reaching the shore, Rousseau <b>and</b> <b>her</b> <b>team</b> found Oceanic 815 survivor Jin-Soo Kwon (Daniel Dae Kim) in the water, who had been time-travelling {{as a result of the}} time shifts which had been moving him and the flight survivors through the island's history.|$|E
5|$|The Virgin Tour was {{the debut}} concert tour by American singer-songwriter Madonna. The tour {{supported}} her first two studio albums, Madonna (1983) and Like a Virgin (1984). Although initially planned {{for an international}} audience, the tour was restricted to the United States and Canada. Warner decided to send Madonna on tour after Like a Virgin became a success. After an official announcement on March 15, 1985, Madonna <b>and</b> <b>her</b> <b>team</b> began production plans. She wanted the tour to be a reflection of her own self and collaborated with designer Maripol for the costumes.|$|E
5|$|While {{filming the}} scene where Keller <b>and</b> <b>her</b> <b>team</b> perform a Decompressive {{craniectomy}} on Weir, an actual brain surgeon performed the same procedure on a head model live from ten feet away, and directed the cast on what to do. While following the surgeon, Staite was nervous about doing the scene. After filming was completed, the surgeon's voice {{was removed from the}} final cut. During the sequence where the city travels through a clearing in the asteroid field, the producers wanted {{the scene where}} Atlantis gets hit by the odd asteroid as authentic as possible, so in the control room, not only the cameras, but the screens and tables on the set were shaken slightly as well.|$|E

5|$|Eventually she {{expanded}} beyond make-up artistry to {{body painting}} {{to express her}} own artistic vision. In August 1991, Demi Moore caused international artistic commotion by appearing {{on the cover of}} Vanity Fair seven months pregnant with her daughter Scout LaRue in the photo More Demi Moore, with Gair as the make-up artist and Annie Leibovitz as the photographer. Exactly one year later, she returned to the cover of the same magazine nude as a product of Gair and Leibovitz in a nearly equally as shocking body painting, Demi's Birthday Suit (pictured right). Gair was the primary body painter of this art and the magazine cover art propelled Gair to fame. Fifteen years later, it continues to be considered the most well-known example of modern body painting. The 1992 cover that entailed a thirteen-hour sitting for Gair <b>and</b> <b>her</b> <b>team</b> of make-up artists was a commemoration of the August 1991 photo. The shooting was storied because photographer Annie Leibovitz could not decide where to shoot and reserved two mobile homes, four hotel rooms and five houses. The pop culture attention given to Gair and her body painting led Absolut Vodka to consider an Absolut Gair body painting promotion in 1993.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the titles captured by her team on the ice, Schmirler has been recognized in several different ways off the ice as well. In 2000, Schmirler was awarded the Saskatchewan Order of Merit, becoming the first posthumous recipient. Along with {{the other members of}} her rink, she had been previously awarded an honorary Doctor of Laws degree from the University of Regina. In the fall of 2000, Schmirler was inducted into the Canadian Sports Hall of Fame. Schmirler <b>and</b> <b>her</b> <b>team</b> were inducted into the Saskatchewan Sports Hall of Fame on two separate occasions, once in 1997 for winning three World Curling Championships and once in 2001 for winning the gold medal at the Olympics. At the annual Scotties Tournament of Hearts, the top player in the playoff round is awarded the Sandra Schmirler Most Valuable Player Award.|$|E
5|$|In {{creating}} original music, Shimomura {{wanted to}} create compositions that would make players feel good while playing to accompany the action aspect of Kingdom Hearts. She played the game and looked over scripts and illustrations for inspiration. After coming up with ideas, she discussed them with director Tetsuya Nomura and the game planners. For the PlayStation 2 re-release of Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories, she <b>and</b> <b>her</b> <b>team</b> spent {{much of their time}} working on the fight music; Shimomura wanted the different fight music to reflect different emotions such as happiness and sadness. To handle the large workload for Kingdom Hearts coded, Kingdom Hearts 358/2 Days and Kingdom Hearts Birth by Sleep, Shimomura composed the most prominent themes, while the rest was created by other composers. In retrospect, Shimomura has stated that the Kingdom Hearts series combined the scenes and music well, and she felt very honored her music has entered into people's hearts. She has also commented that she enjoyed working on the project, despite its hardships, and is proud of the work.|$|E
