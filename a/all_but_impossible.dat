5|$|Throughout Western Pennsylvania counties, protesters used {{violence}} and intimidation to prevent federal officials from collecting the tax. Resistance {{came to a}} climax in July 1794, when a U.S. marshal arrived in western Pennsylvania to serve writs to distillers who had not paid the excise. The alarm was raised, and more than 500 armed men attacked the fortified home of tax inspector General John Neville. Washington responded by sending peace commissioners to western Pennsylvania {{to negotiate with the}} rebels, {{while at the same time}} calling on governors to send a militia force to enforce the tax. Washington himself rode at the head of an army to suppress the insurgency, with 13,000 militiamen provided by the governors of Virginia, Maryland, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania. The rebels all went home before the arrival of the army, and there was no confrontation. About 20 men were arrested, but all were later acquitted or pardoned. Most distillers in nearby Kentucky were found to be <b>all</b> <b>but</b> <b>impossible</b> to tax—in the next six years, over 175 distillers from Kentucky were convicted of violating the tax law. Numerous examples of resistance are recorded in court documents and newspaper accounts.|$|E

5|$|While North Korea {{had already}} begun to move from a foreign policy based upon proletarian internationalism at the Conference of Party Representatives in 1966, the WPK {{leadership}} had never explicitly broken with proletarian internationalism as it did at the 6th Congress.

Proletarian internationalism was replaced with a national, independent foreign policy; if a socialist and non-socialist country were at war, North Korea could (in theory) support the non-socialist country if it benefited North Korea. At the 6th Congress, Kim Il-sung attached more importance to relations with Third World countries than to unity in the socialist camp. Nevertheless, North Korea still received massive funds and aid from the Soviet bloc, the People's Republic of China and relations with the United States would remain bitterly cold. While North Korea argues that independence and proletarian internationalism are not exclusive, in orthodox communist theory they are.|$|E

25|$|The {{modulation}} of {{the radio}} emissions by planetary rotation is traditionally {{used to determine the}} rotation period of the interiors of fluid giant planets. In the case of Saturn, however, this appears to be impossible, as the period varies at the timescale of tens years. In 1980–1981 the periodicity in the radio emissions as measured by Voyager 1 and 2 was , which was then adopted as the rotational period of Saturn. Scientists were surprised when Galileo and then Cassini returned a different value—. Further observation indicated that the modulation period changes by as much as 1% on the characteristic timescale of 20–30days with an additional long term trend. There is a correlation between the period and solar wind speed, however, the causes of this change remain a mystery. One reason may be that the saturnian perfectly axially symmetric magnetic field fails to impose a strict corotation on the magnetospheric plasma making it slip relative to the planet. The lack of a precise correlation between the variation period of SKR and planetary rotation makes it <b>all</b> <b>but</b> <b>impossible</b> to determine the true rotational period of Saturn.|$|E
