Her captain recommended that the flying-off deck be lengthened and given a steeper slope to allow gravity to boost the aircraft's acceleration and the ship was accordingly modified at Cammell Laird between November 1915 and early April 1916. The forward funnel was split into two funnels and the flight deck was extended between them and over the bridge to a length of , so that aircraft from both holds could use the flight deck. A canvas windscreen was provided to allow the aircraft to unfold their wings out of the wind, and a kite balloon {{and all of its}} supporting equipment were added in the <b>aft</b> <b>hold.</b> Campania now carried seven Short Type 184 torpedo bombers and three or four smaller fighters or scouts; a Type 184 made its first takeoff from the flight deck on 3 June 1916, also using a wheeled trolley. This success prompted the Admiralty to order the world's first aircraft designed for carrier operations, the Fairey Campania. The ship received the first of these aircraft in late 1917 where they joined smaller Sopwith 1½ Strutter scouts. At various times Campania also carried the Sopwith Baby and Sopwith Pup.|$|E

50|$|The tide {{continued}} to ebb, causing Fenella to slip and heel over to port, exposing the damage incurred. Captain Mylchreest and his officers inspected {{the damage and}} found that a gash had been inflicted on her starboard side that was 10 inches (25.4 cm) long and 1 inch (2.54 cm) wide. The ship's carpenter managed to wedge and plaster the damage with clay so as it was rendered watertight. Two other holes were subsequently discovered on the port side, one seven inches (17.8 cm) long and 1 inch (2.54 cm) wide and the other 15 inches (38.1 cm) long and 1 inch (2.54 cm) wide, {{which led to the}} engine room and <b>aft</b> <b>hold</b> respectively. Fenella′s master engaged the services of a pilot in order to assist with the situation and at 19:00 hours Satanella arrived at the scene.|$|E
50|$|Carried {{out by the}} US Navys Task Force 58, {{with nine}} {{aircraft}} carriers, {{under the command of}} Vice Admiral Marc A. Mitscher, Hailstone was a massive two-day combined air-surface-submarine raid. Although the IJN had moved its aircraft carriers and battleships from Truk a short time earlier, their defenses were unprepared for the scale of the attack, and the remaining navy and merchant vessels were devastated by wave after wave of American warplanes. Heian Maru quickly put to sea and went into evasive maneuvers north of Dublon Island - with Vice Admiral Takeo Takagi and his Sixth Fleet staff on board - but as one of the largest targets in the lagoon, enemy attacks were relentless. At mid-morning two bombs fell close astern, damaging one of her propeller shafts and flooding an <b>aft</b> <b>hold.</b> The crew managed to correct the trim by pumping fuel to her bow tanks, and after sunset Heian Maru returned to Dublon, where Admiral Takagi and some of the ships cargo of Type 95 torpedoes were offloaded.|$|E

Here and there a clump of pines to the westward stood out, black and rugged, against a glow of pink and green; the air was cold and filled with a resinous fragrance. But Geraldine occupied most of Andrew's attention. She stood, gracefully poised, her light dress fluttering in the draught made by the launch's speed, and a clear warm color glowing in her face. Fine spray leaped about the bows, around which there curled a wisp of foam, and the froth streamed back far across the lake.|$|R

50|$|In {{the high}} seas, the rescue ships had {{launched}} lifeboats {{of their own}} to try and take passengers off the stricken Volturno, but the poor weather, the high seas, and the reluctance of Volturnos passengers {{to jump into the}} frigid waters hampered rescue efforts. On board Volturno, the crew and some of the male passengers, unable to extinguish the fire, were at least able to keep it from spreading to the <b>aft</b> cargo <b>holds</b> over which the others on board were gathered.

25|$|After the war, with Japan {{in defeat}} and needing to {{repatriate}} millions of individuals from its former colonies, Sōya {{was removed from}} the navy list and was assigned duties with the nation's repatriation fleet. Modifications at this time included removal of her guns and the installation of facilities for passengers such as toilets in what had been her large forward and <b>aft</b> cargo <b>holds.</b> Spacious wooden accommodation was also built on deck. She undertook numerous missions embarking troops and passengers, including calls at Shanghai, Tinian and Guam. In light of her ice-breaking ability, she was also assigned northerly missions and by 1948 had made 14 voyages to and from Sakhalin (the former Karafuto), evacuating citizens by agreement with the new authorities from what had become part of the Soviet Union.|$|R

The interior was fireproofed with aluminum. Accommodations were spacious with all cabins facing outside and having private baths. Passenger ships of the day also handled cargo, and Santa Rosas two <b>aft</b> cargo <b>holds</b> had side doors and automatic conveyors to quickly move pallets {{on and off the}} ship, thus giving her a rapid turn-around at port.

Shortly before dawn, a large explosion—probably of her boilers—rocked Volturno, and the rescuers felt that the ship, which had not been in imminent danger of sinking up to this point, might founder at any time. The tanker Narragansett turned on her pumps and sprayed lubricating oil on the sea to help calm the surface. The combined effect of the oil and the lessening of the storm allowed many more lifeboats to be sent to Volturnos aid. Kroonland launched two more boats herself and saved 75 more, including Captain Inch, the last person to leave the stricken ship. In all, some 520 passengers and crew were rescued by the ten ships—89 on Kroonland alone. The loss of life was limited to around 130, mostly women and children from the early lifeboat launchings.|$|R
25|$|Characteristically these boats had bluff bows, crew's {{quarters}} with {{table and}} cooking stove in the focsle, {{and a single}} mast with derrick {{in front of the}} large <b>hold,</b> <b>aft</b> of which the funnel and ship's wheel stood above the engine room while the captain had a small cabin in the stern. When publication of the Vital Spark stories began in 1905 the ship's wheel was still in the open, but later a wheelhouse was added aft of the funnel giving the puffers their distinctive image. Their flat bottom allowed them to beach and unload at low tide, essential to supply remote settlements without suitable piers. Typical cargoes could include coal and furniture, with farm produce and gravel sometimes being brought back.|$|R
