5|$|There {{has been}} {{criticism}} {{from a number}} of people that the highly fragmented DG structure wastes a considerable <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>time</b> <b>in</b> s as the different departments and Commissioners compete with each other. Furthermore, the DGs can exercise considerable control over a Commissioner with the Commissioner having little time to learn to assert control over their staff.|$|E
5|$|Bacteriophages are {{a common}} and diverse group of viruses and are the most {{abundant}} form of biological entity in aquatic environments– there are up to ten times more of these viruses in the oceans than there are bacteria, reaching levels of 250,000,000 bacteriophages per millilitre of seawater. These viruses infect specific bacteria by binding to surface receptor molecules and then entering the cell. Within a short <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>time,</b> <b>in</b> some cases just minutes, bacterial polymerase starts translating viral mRNA into protein. These proteins go on to become either new virions within the cell, helper proteins, which help assembly of new virions, or proteins involved in cell lysis. Viral enzymes aid in {{the breakdown of the}} cell membrane, and, {{in the case of the}} T4 phage, in just over twenty minutes after injection over three hundred phages could be released.|$|E
5|$|In FIBA-sanctioned tournaments, {{defending}} team {{players are}} allowed {{to stay on the}} key for an unlimited <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>time.</b> <b>In</b> American professional basketball, defending team players are also prohibited from staying in the key for more than three seconds, unless a player is directly guarding an offensive player. If a player surpasses that time, the defending team will be charged with a defensive three-second violation, which will result in a technical foul where the team with the ball shoots one free throw plus ball possession and a reset of the shot clock. In all cases, the count resets if the shot hits the rim or if the player steps out of the lane.|$|E

5|$|In the finale, {{the main}} {{characters}} spend the longest <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>time</b> <b>in</b> the parallel universe to date. The writers sought to emphasize {{the differences between the}} two worlds: Anna Torv created a unique personality and physical demeanor for her character's doppelgänger, Fauxlivia; DC Comics designed special covers based upon some of their classic editions to display in the Other Side. These and other popular culture differences were noted and appreciated by critics, persuading the writers to add more in the third season. The episodes mark the first appearance of recurring character Lincoln Lee (Seth Gabel), as well as the return of actors Leonard Nimoy and Kirk Acevedo as William Bell and Agent Charlie Francis, respectively.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 1970s Chatwin spent an {{increasing}} <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>time</b> <b>in</b> New York City. He {{continued to have}} affairs with men, {{but most of these}} affairs were short-lived. In 1977 he began his first serious affair with Donald Richards, an Australian stockbroker. Richards introduced him to the gay nightclub scene in New York. During this period Chatwin became acquainted with Robert Mapplethorpe, who photographed him. Chatwin {{is one of the few}} men Mapplethorpe photographed fully clothed. Chatwin later contributed the introduction to a book of Mapplethorpe's photographs, Lady, Lisa Lyon (1983).|$|E
5|$|Moving {{north to}} Auckland, Heaphy's {{new role as}} the chief {{draughtsman}} for the Auckland Survey Office, kept him occupied with the preparation of maps and plans. After a few years, he began to spend a greater <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>time</b> <b>in</b> the field, where he carried out survey work. As he had done when living in Nelson, he supplemented his income with commissioned artworks. He began to build on his geological knowledge, taking a particular interest in vulcanology and wrote an article on Auckland's volcanoes for a geological journal in England. He completed several paintings of volcanoes as well as thermal attractions in the Bay of Plenty including the famous Pink and White Terraces. Hoping to raise his profile, he sent many of his works to London and some remain {{on display at the}} offices of the Geological Society.|$|E

5|$|Another storyline rivalry {{heading into}} Against All Odds {{was for the}} TNA X Division Championship between the champion, A.J. Styles, and the challenger, Christopher Daniels, in a thirty-minute Iron Man match. An Iron Man match {{involves}} two competitors fighting for a predetermined <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>time,</b> <b>in</b> this case thirty-minutes, after which whoever gained more pinfalls or submissions is the victor. The rivalry for this match began on the January 21 episode of Impact!, when Daniels challenged Styles to a match that night, in which if Styles could not defeat him in under ten-minutes then Daniels got a X Division Championship match at Against All Odds. The match ended in a time limit draw, which meant per the pre-match stipulation Daniels gained a championship match at Against All Odds. Dusty Rhodes then entered the arena after the match and announced that the contest would be a thirty-minute Iron Man match.|$|E
5|$|Archaea {{were split}} {{off as a}} third domain {{because of the large}} {{differences}} in their ribosomal RNA structure. The particular RNA molecule sequenced, known as 16s rRNA, is present in all organisms and always has the same vital function, the production of proteins. Because this function is so central to life, organisms with mutations of their 16s rRNA are unlikely to survive, leading to great stability in the structure of this nucleotide over many generations. 16s rRNA is also large enough to retain organism-specific information, but small enough to be sequenced in a manageable <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>time.</b> <b>In</b> 1977, Carl Woese, a microbiologist studying the genetic sequencing of organisms, developed a new sequencing method that involved splitting the RNA into fragments that could be sorted and compared to other fragments from other organisms. The more similar the patterns between species were, the more closely related the organisms.|$|E
5|$|The 3D cutscenes were {{improved}} with motion capture technology {{to create a}} more cinematic experience. The stylized comic-like cut scenes from the first game carried over into the sequel, though they were reserved for bigger moments in the game. The 3D cutscenes were used to tell the story going on in the moment, while the comic-like cutscenes were used to tell a large piece of the story in a short <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>time.</b> <b>In</b> addition to the cut scenes, the moral element of the original also transferred to the sequel. When incorporating the player's Karma decisions from the first game into the second, it was found challenging to balance the effects of importing saves from the original Infamous and keeping the game interesting for those who did not. The melee combat in the game was redesigned from the original with finishing moves being added. A large focus on the melee combat was the presentation, which was meant to make the player feel super-powered.|$|E

25|$|After being {{marched to}} the coast for sale, enslaved people were held in large forts called {{factories}}. The <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>time</b> <b>in</b> factories varied, but Milton Meltzer states in Slavery: A World History that around 4.5% of deaths attributed to the transatlantic slave trade occurred during this phase. In other words, over 820,000 people {{are believed to have}} died in African ports such as Benguela, Elmina, and Bonny, reducing the number of those shipped to 17.5 million.|$|E

From 2005, the BEd began to be phased out and replaced with a BA degree in primary education.|$|E
