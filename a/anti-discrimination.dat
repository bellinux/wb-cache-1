5|$|The Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights regards {{legislation}} as {{an indispensable}} means for realising the rights which {{is unlikely to}} be limited by resource constraints. The enacting of <b>anti-discrimination</b> provisions and the establishment of enforceable rights with judicial remedies within national legal systems are considered to be appropriate means. Some provisions, such as <b>anti-discrimination</b> laws, are already required under other human rights instruments, such as the ICCPR.|$|E
5|$|The {{run up to}} the 1968 presidential {{election}} saw the incumbent president, Lyndon B. Johnson, serving {{during a period of}} great social unrest. There were riots in the major cities despite Johnson's attempts to introduce anti-poverty and <b>anti-discrimination</b> legislation, and there was significant opposition to the ongoing military action in Vietnam.|$|E
5|$|Keating is a {{supporter}} of gay rights. He supported ending the Don't Ask Don't Tell policy and has promised to push nationwide <b>anti-discrimination</b> laws and marriage rights for gays and lesbians. In July 2011, he recorded a video supporting LGBT youth in Massachusetts {{in conjunction with other}} members of Massachusetts' Congressional Delegation and the It Gets Better Project.|$|E
5|$|The International Size Acceptance Association (ISAA) is a {{non-governmental}} organization (NGO) {{which was founded}} in 1997. It has more of a global orientation and describes its mission as promoting size acceptance and helping to end weight-based discrimination. These groups often argue for the recognition of obesity as a disability under the US Americans With Disabilities Act (ADA). The American legal system, however, has decided that the potential public health costs exceed the benefits of extending this <b>anti-discrimination</b> law to cover obesity.|$|E
5|$|An {{employer}} who terminates {{an employee}} {{for being an}} alcoholic is {{in violation of the}} state's <b>anti-discrimination</b> laws unless they can show that person's condition affected their job performance or created a substantial safety risk. No general hospitals may refuse a patient treatment for intoxication or alcoholism, and all individual and group health insurance plans which are regulated by the state of New Jersey are required to offer both inpatient and outpatient treatment for alcoholism. Under federal law, all group health insurances plans for private companies with more than 50 employees must offer insurance coverage for alcoholism that is equal to their insurance coverage for other medical conditions.|$|E
5|$|Hong Kong {{financial}} centre matured in the 1990s, but was greatly {{affected by the}} Asian financial crisis in 1998, and again in 2003 by the SARS outbreak. A revival of external and domestic demand {{has led to a}} strong recovery, as cost decreases strengthened the competitiveness of Hong Kong exports and a long deflationary period ended. Government intervention, initiated by the later colonial governments and continued since 1997, has steadily increased, with the introduction of export credit guarantees, a compulsory pension scheme, a minimum wage, <b>anti-discrimination</b> laws, and a state mortgage backer.|$|E
5|$|In 2013, Lex Wotton, {{as well as}} {{his wife}} Cecilia and Mother Agnes, filed a class action lawsuit on behalf of Aboriginal people who lived on Palm Island against the State of Queensland and the Commissioner of the Police Service, alleging that the police had {{committed}} acts of unlawful racial discrimination in the investigation into Mulrunji's death in custody and in the subsequent police response to the unrest in the community. The Wottons' legal team included Lex Wotton's long-standing lawyer, Stewart Levitt of law firm Levitt Robinson Solicitors, as well as prominent <b>anti-discrimination</b> barrister Chris Ronalds SC, Aboriginal barrister Joshua Creamer, and Queensland barrister Shaneen Pointing.|$|E
5|$|Agnew's {{four-year}} term as county executive saw a moderately progressive administration, {{which included the}} building of new schools, increases to teachers' salaries, reorganization of the police department, and improvements to the water and sewer systems. His <b>anti-discrimination</b> bill passed, {{and gave him a}} reputation as a liberal, but its impact was limited in a county where the population was 97 percent white. His relations with the increasingly militant civil rights movement were sometimes troubled. In a number of desegregation disputes involving private property, Agnew appeared to prioritize law and order, showing a particular aversion to any kind of demonstration. His reaction to the 16th Street Baptist Church bombing in Alabama, in which four children died, was to refuse to attend a memorial service at a Baltimore church, and to denounce a planned demonstration in support of the victims.|$|E
5|$|In 2001, the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights {{released}} an advisory opinion {{calling for an}} end to the use of Native American images and team names by non-Native schools. While recognizing the right to freedom of expression, the commission also recognizes those Native Americans and civil rights advocates that maintain these mascots, by promoting stereotypes, may violate <b>anti-discrimination</b> laws. When found in educational institutions, mascots may also create a hostile environment inconsistent with learning to respect diverse cultures, but instead teach that stereotypes that misrepresent a minority group are permissible. Those schools that claim that their sports imagery stimulate interest in Native American culture have not listened to Native groups and civil rights leaders who point out that even purportedly positive stereotypes both present a false portrayal of the past and prevent understanding of contemporary Native people as fellow Americans.|$|E
5|$|In view {{of growing}} labor shortages, on July 1, 1944 the War Manpower Commission made an {{important}} decision, ruling that {{from then on}} all hiring of male employees in the country was to be done through the United States Employment Service (USES). By that time the USES followed strict <b>anti-discrimination</b> employment practices. The PTC management finally gave in and within a week posted notices about available skilled positions that {{would be open to}} all applicants, regardless of race. The company accepted eight black applicants (three from the USES and five from its own ranks) to train as streetcar coachmen. Their training was to take place in late July, and they were to start taking an empty streetcar on the lines from August 1. It was that impending trial run of the streetcars by the eight black trainees that finally triggered the strike.|$|E
5|$|A reformist, Dunstan brought {{profound}} {{change to}} South Australian society. His socially progressive administration saw Aboriginal land rights recognised, homosexuality decriminalised, {{the first female}} judge appointed, the first non-British governor, Sir Mark Oliphant, and later, the first indigenous governor Sir Douglas Nicholls. He enacted consumer protection laws, reformed and expanded the public education and health systems, abolished the death penalty, relaxed censorship and drinking laws, created a ministry for the environment, enacted <b>anti-discrimination</b> law, and implemented electoral reforms such as the overhaul of the Legislative Council of parliament, lowered the voting age to 18, enacted universal suffrage, and completely abolished malapportionment, changes which gave him a less hostile parliament and allowed him to enact his reforms. He established Rundle Mall, enacted measures to protect buildings of historical heritage, and encouraged a flourishing of the arts, with support for the Adelaide Festival Centre, the State Theatre Company, {{and the establishment of}} the South Australian Film Corporation. He encouraged cultural exchanges with Asia, multiculturalism and an increase in the state's culinary awareness and sophistication. He is recognised for his role in reinvigorating the social, artistic and cultural life of South Australia during his nine years in office, remembered as the Dunstan Decade. However, there were also problems; the economy began to stagnate, and the large increases to burgeoning public service generated claims of waste. One of Dunstan's pet projects, a plan to build a new city at Monarto to alleviate urban pressures in Adelaide, was abandoned when economic and population growth stalled, with much money and planning already invested. After four consecutive election wins, Dunstan's administration began to falter in 1978 following his dismissal of Police Commissioner Harold Salisbury, as controversy broke out over whether he had improperly interfered with a judicial investigation. In addition, policy problems and unemployment began to mount, as well as unsubstantiated rumours of corruption and personal impropriety. Dunstan became increasingly short-tempered, and the strain was increased by the death of his second wife. His resignation from the premiership and politics in 1979 was abrupt after collapsing due to ill health, but he would live for another 20 years, remaining a vocal and outspoken campaigner for progressive social policy.|$|E
25|$|Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe in May 2007 issued {{concern that}} Russia still hasn't adopted {{comprehensive}} <b>anti-discrimination</b> legislation, and the existing <b>anti-discrimination</b> provisions are seldom used {{in spite of}} reported cases of discrimination.|$|E
25|$|The Republican Party {{opposed the}} {{inclusion}} of sexual preference in <b>anti-discrimination</b> statutes from 1992 to 2004. The 2008 and 2012 Republican Party platform supported <b>anti-discrimination</b> statues based on sex, race, age, religion, creed, disability, or national origin, but both platforms were silent on sexual orientation and gender identity.|$|E
25|$|In July 2006, Moise filed a {{complaint}} at the National Council for Combating Discrimination, or CNCD, Romania's <b>anti-discrimination</b> and equality watchdog, claiming {{discrimination on the basis}} of religion under Romania's <b>anti-discrimination</b> law of 2000, and asking for the removal of religious symbols from all Romanian public education institutions.|$|E
25|$|Each of {{the states}} and territories {{introduced}} their own <b>anti-discrimination</b> laws to protect LGBTI people from discrimination before the Commonwealth did so in 2013. The first <b>anti-discrimination</b> protections were enacted in New South Wales by the Wran Government in 1982, {{two years before the}} decriminalisation of homosexuality in that state.|$|E
