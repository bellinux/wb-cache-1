5|$|Mulder {{calls the}} medical {{examiner}} who tells him that Scully has taken Lyle Parker back to the ranch and that Parker's blood test has revealed his father's blood type in his stomach. Mulder and Tskany hurry to the Parker ranch. After firing on the creature which escapes unharmed, Mulder finds Scully hiding upstairs. They search for the creature, and as it lunges to attack them, Tskany shoots it. Scully expresses disbelief on seeing Parker’s body, saying that Parker was in the bathroom, sick, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> attacked by the mountain lion. But Tskany says that the lion {{is still in its}} cage.|$|E

25|$|The {{tradition}} of raising stones that had runic inscriptions {{first appeared in}} the 4th and 5th century, in Norway and Sweden, and these early runestones were usually placed next to graves. The earliest Danish runestones appeared in the 8th and 9th centuries, and there are about 50 runestones from the Migration Period in Scandinavia. Most runestones were erected during the period 950-1100 CE, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> mostly raised in Sweden, and to a lesser degree in Denmark and Norway.|$|E

25|$|An {{observation}} of the Datta study is that the learning group spent 180% more time in SWS than did the control group during the post-trial sleep-recording session. This study shows that after spatial exploration activity, patterns of hippocampal place cells are reactivated during SWS following the experiment. Rats were run through a linear track using rewards on either end. The rats would then {{be placed in the}} track for 30 minutes to allow them to adjust (PRE), then they ran the track with reward-based training for 30 minutes (RUN), <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> allowed to rest for 30 minutes.|$|E
25|$|Many {{guns were}} {{captured}} by the Wehrmacht early in the war, and adopted as 15,2cm sFH 443(r). The Finnish Army captured 45 pieces and further 57 were purchased from Germany in 1944. In Finland the howitzer, designated 152 H 38, was issued to five heavy artillery battalions and actively used in battle. Finns rather liked the gun, but considered it somewhat heavy. After {{the end of the}} hostilities, the M-10 remained in the Finnish service; in the 1980s there were some considerations of modernizing it, but the idea was dropped; the guns were stored in the army depots until 2000 <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> finally retired.|$|E
25|$|At {{forty years}} of age and a very wealthy man, Marks started {{thinking}} about marriage. He returned to Sheffield in England and married Bertha Guttmann, eighteen years his junior. This was an arranged marriage set up by Bertha's father who helped with Sammy's success during the years. Bertha was only 5 years old when Sammy set foot on the Cape's soil. From this union nine children were born, six boys and three girls. Only six children survived infancy. Having himself received a limited schooling, Marks set great store by education and saw to it that the children were taught at home by governesses – boys until the age of eight, girls until the age of twelve <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> sent to private schools in England.|$|E

25|$|It took {{eight to}} twenty hours in soft soil or gravel to {{excavate}} the large firing pit required {{to hold the}} halves of the base box. Six to eight hours were required to actually assemble the gun itself. Each half of the base box was maneuvered into position on rails that ran along {{each side of the}} pit and then it was jacked up off the wagon and the wagon was then removed. Each base box half was jacked down onto wheels that ran on the guide rails <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> bolted together. The complete base box was pulled over the pit, the wheels removed and it was jacked down into the pit. Three rails were placed on top of the base box to guide the carriage wagon into position and the carriage was jacked up while the wagon was removed and it was then jacked down and bolted to the base box. The barrel wagon was guided into place using the same rails and two block and tackles were attached to the barrel clamp. The crew pulled on the ropes and slid the barrel into the cradle. The last steps were to connect the recoil brakes' pistons to the barrel, fill and test the recoil brake and recuperator, and install the roller race. Disassembly took around six hours.|$|E
500|$|The makeup {{time for}} the Borg {{expanded}} from the single hour needed for television to five hours, {{in addition to the}} 30minutes necessary to get into costume and 90minutes to remove the makeup {{at the end of the}} day. While Westmore estimated that a fully staffed production would have around 50 makeup artists, First Contact had to make do with fewer than ten people involved in preparation, and at most 20 artists a day. Despite the long hours, Westmore's teams began to be more creative with the prosthetics even as they decreased their preparation times. [...] "They were using two tubes, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> using three tubes, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> sticking tubes in the ears and up the nose," [...] Westmore explained. [...] "And we were using a very gooey caramel coloring, maybe using a little bit of it, but by the time we got to the end of the movie we had the stuff dripping down the side of [...] faces—it looked like they were leaking oil! So, at the very end , they're more ferocious." ...|$|E

500|$|Although Knowles had {{previously}} {{worked with a}} wide range of high-profile producers and songwriters on earlier projects, she struggled to convince her wishlisted musicians to contribute to Sol-Angel and the Hadley St. Dreams, production-wise. This was due to no producer signing on to the project before hearing any material for the album. [...] "I don't think it was offensive," [...] Knowles admitted. [...] "I understand that these are people that want to take on credible passionate projects. So before I would work with them I would schedule a meeting and play them the record. <b>And</b> <b>then</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> more convinced and willing to get on board." [...] Cee-Lo Green and Mark Ronson were not consulted until late into the production of the album, both having been persuaded by Knowles at the 50th Grammy Awards ceremony: [...] "I had to party with Cee-Lo too to get him to work on the record [...] but once he did [...] he signed on immediately." ...|$|E
500|$|Upon {{arrival at}} Truk on 9 October, the two sisters were {{assigned}} to the Second Carrier Division to begin operations against American forces in the Guadalcanal area as part of the 3rd Fleet. On 15 October, the two carriers reached the vicinity of Malaita Island in the Solomon Islands and their aircraft discovered a resupply convoy for Guadalcanal that was escorted by the destroyer [...] Their aircraft attacked and sank the destroyer. The next day, they found the small seaplane tender, , in Lunga Roads offloading avgas into barges. Dive bombers from the sisters blew the ship's stern off, but failed to sink McFarland. The two carriers were intended to play a prominent role in the Japanese effort to retake Guadalcanal Island and {{were assigned to}} the Advance Force for this operation.

500|$|Fantasy Black Channels track listing and UK CD {{release date}} of 11 August 2008 were {{confirmed}} on 11 June. Faley has claimed that [...] "the album {{fell into place}} itself, like the songs basically told us where {{they wanted to go}} on the album". Late of the Pier picked the record's name at random after first contemplating using Peggy Patch and Her Sequenced Dress. The cover art was designed by a friend of the band members from Brighton, Jon Bergman. A final EP containing material already released in 2007 and 2008, Echoclistel Lambietroy, was released in July 2008 as part of the marketing campaign for the forthcoming album. Potter has summed the record's conception by concluding, [...] "I think in the three years to build up to the album, we never actually thought of a track list, and we never really kind of considered the fact that it should sound like an album. I think we recorded all the songs <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> there and it was like, 'Oh, we have to kind of stitch this together and make it sound like one piece.'" ...|$|E

[...] Lali asked the Afghan government, the United Nations and the international community to ensure the perpetrators were punished in Afghanistan. [...] While visiting one of the affected villages, Hamid Karzai pointed to one of the villagers and said: [...] "In his family, in four rooms people were killed – children and women were killed – <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> all brought together in one room and then set on fire.

500|$|The {{ship was}} {{assigned}} to the Second Carrier Division of the 1st Air Fleet after commissioning and became Rear Admiral Kakuji Kakuta's flagship on 12 August. After spending the next several months working up, Hiyō arrived at Truk, together with her sister , on 9 October to begin operations against American forces in the Guadalcanal area as part of the 3rd Fleet. On 15 October, the two carriers reached the vicinity of Malaita Island in the Solomon Islands and their aircraft discovered a resupply convoy for Guadalcanal that was escorted by the destroyer [...] The A6M Zeros and D3As from the sisters attacked and sank the destroyer. The next day, they found the small seaplane tender, , in Lunga Roads offloading avgas into barges. Nine D3As attacked, blowing the ship's stern off and destroying the barge. McFarland was not sunk, but required months of repairs.

30|$|Dominance depth In this approach, {{solutions}} are grouped in Pareto fronts [23], non-dominated solutions {{in the population}} are assigned the value 1, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> removed from the population.
