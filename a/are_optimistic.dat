25|$|Some {{parents want}} to try to have a baby very soon after the miscarriage. The {{decision}} of trying to become pregnant again can be difficult. Reasons exist that may prompt parents to consider another pregnancy. For older mothers, there may be some sense of urgency. Other parents <b>are</b> <b>optimistic</b> that future pregnancies are likely to be successful. Many are hesitant and {{want to know about the}} risk of having another or more miscarriages. Some clinicians recommend that the women have one menstrual cycle before attempting another pregnancy. This is because the date of conception may be hard to determine. Also, the first menstrual cycle after a miscarriage can be much longer or shorter than expected. Parents may be advised to wait even longer if they have experienced late miscarriage, molar pregnancy or are undergoing tests. Some parents wait for six months based upon recommendations from their health care provider.|$|E
500|$|The Flowering Orchards (also the Orchards in Blossom) {{are among}} the first groups of work {{completed}} after Van Gogh's arrival in Arles in February 1888. The 14 paintings <b>are</b> <b>optimistic,</b> joyous and visually expressive of the burgeoning spring. They are delicately sensitive and unpopulated. He painted swiftly, and although he brought to this series a version of Impressionism, {{a strong sense of}} personal style began to emerge during this period. The transience of the blossoming trees, and the passing of the season, seemed to align with his sense of impermanence and belief in a new beginning in Arles. During the blossoming of the trees that spring, he found [...] "a world of motifs that {{could not have been more}} Japanese".

500|$|According to {{zoologist}} and conservationist Sheila Conant, A. brownii {{is important}} {{due to its}} uniqueness in the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands as [...] "the only Hawaiian endemic in this large genus which contains many economically and nutritionally important species." [...] However, {{in more than a}} decade of field surveys on Nihoa, no living plants have been identified. Wildlife refuge staff have visited the island during the dry season at least 21 times between 1983 and 1996. The absence of the plant in recent field surveys might be explained by the time of visit. Because winter surveys of Nihoa tend to be difficult and dangerous due to poor landing conditions, surveys have not been conducted during the moist, winter growing season from December through March when the plant is easiest to find. Most of the surveys have been completed during the summer months, when it is easiest to visit Nihoa, but during this time, the stems of A. brownii dry up and cannot be distinguished from other herbaceous plants. A seven-day visit to the island in April 2006 still did not find any specimens but botanists <b>are</b> <b>optimistic</b> that the species has survived. Additional winter surveys are required to accurately assess the conservation status of the plant.|$|E

2500|$|Unlike other {{songs on}} the album, [...] "Save the Children" [...] and [...] "I Think I’ll Call It Morning" [...] <b>are</b> <b>optimistic</b> dedications to joy, happiness, and freedom. The title track, {{described}} by journalist and music writer Vince Alleti as the album's best song, is a lyrically cinematic account of a man's breakdown after losing his job as witnessed by his son. Scott-Heron's lyricism on the album has been acclaimed by critics, as the lyrics for [...] "Pieces of a Man" [...] received praise for its empathetic narration. The album's opening track, [...] "The Revolution Will Not Be Televised", is a proto-rap track with lyricism criticizing the United States government and mass media. Considered a classic in the rap genre, the song features many political references, unadorned arrangements, pounding bass lines and stripped-down drumbeats. The song's structure and musical formula would later influence the blueprint of modern hip hop. Because of the song's spoken word style and critical overtones, {{it has often been}} referred to as the birth of rap.|$|E

2500|$|Israel began a {{unilateral}} pullout from Lebanon {{in compliance with}} UN Resolution 425 (1978) in May 2000, which was declared completed on 16 June. The move was widely interpreted by Arabs as an Israeli defeat and was to exercise a profound influence on tactics adopted in the Al Aqsa Uprising. the PLO official Farouk Kaddoumi told reporters: [...] "We <b>are</b> <b>optimistic.</b> Hezbollah's resistance {{can be used as}} an example for other Arabs seeking to regain their rights." [...] Many Palestinian officials have gone on record as saying that the intifada had been planned long in advance to put pressure on Israel.

Israeli's military response demolished a large part of the infrastructure built by the PA during the years following the Oslo Accords in preparation for a Palestinian state. This infrastructure included the legitimate arming of Palestinian forces for the first time: some 90 paramilitary camps had been set up to train Palestinian youths in armed conflict.

60|$|Such {{things are}} not serious, and they are such as no serious man need shrink from, {{but they have a}} bearing upon what I am trying to explain, and in a certain measure they account for a certain {{attitude}} in our literary men. No one likes to have stones, not to say mud, thrown at him, though they are not meant to hurt him badly and may be partly thrown in joke. But it is pretty certain that if a man not in politics takes them seriously, he will have more or less mud, not to say stones, thrown at him. He might burlesque or caricature them, or misrepresent them, with safety; but if he spoke of public questions with heart and conscience, he could not do it with impunity, unless he were authorized to do so by some practical relation to them. I do not mean that then he would escape; but in this country, where there were once supposed to be no classes, people are more strictly classified than in any other. Business to the business man, law to the lawyer, medicine to the physician, politics to the politician, and letters to the literary man; that is the rule. One is not expected to transcend his function, and commonly one does not. We keep each to his last, as if there were not human interests, civic interests, which had a higher claim than the last upon our thinking and feeling. The tendency has grown upon us severally and collectively through the long persistence of our prosperity; if public affairs were going ill, private affairs were going so well that we did not mind the others; and we Americans are, I think, meridional in our improvidence. We are so essentially of to-day that we behave as if to- morrow no more concerned us than yesterday. We have taught ourselves to believe that it will all come out right in the end so long that we have come to act upon our belief; we <b>are</b> <b>optimistic</b> fatalists.|$|E

6000|$|It used to {{be thought}} {{that a man who}} said he liked dry {{champagne}} would say anything. In the same way, some persons may hold that a person who could believe in the recurrent Australian story of [...] "suspended animation"--artificially produced in animals, and prolonged for months--could believe in anything. It does not do, however, to be too dogmatic about matters of opinion in this world. Perhaps the Australian tale of an invention by which sheep and oxen are first made lifeless, then rendered [...] "stiff ones" [...] by freezing, and then restored to life, and reproduced with gravy, may be like the genius of Beethoven. Very few persons (and these artists) believed in Beethoven at first, but now he is often considered to be the greatest of composers. Perhaps great discoveries, like the works of men of original genius, are certain to be received at first with incredulity and mockery. We will not, therefore, take up a dogmatic position, either about the painting or the preserved meats of the future; but will hope for the best. The ideally best, of course, is that the tale from Australia may prove true. In that case the poorest will be able to earn [...] "three square meals a day," [...] like the Australians themselves; and while English butchers suffer (for some one must suffer in all great revolutions), smiling Plenty will walk through our land studying a cookery-book. There <b>are</b> <b>optimistic</b> thinkers, who gravely argue that the serious desires of humanity are the pledges of their own future fulfilment. If that be correct, the Australian myth may be founded on fact. There is no desire more deep-rooted in our perishable nature than that which asks for plenty of beef and mutton at low prices. Again, humanity has so often turned over the idea of conveniently suspended animation before, that there must be something in that conception. If we examine the history of ideas we shall find that they at first exist [...] "in the air." [...] They float about, beautiful alluring visions, ready to be caught and made to serve mortal needs by the right man at the right moment. Thus Empedocles, Lucretius, and the author of [...] "Vestiges of Creation," [...] all found out Darwinism before Mr. Darwin. They spied the idea, but they left it floating; they did not trap it, and break it into scientific harness. Solomon De Caus, as all the world has heard, was put into a lunatic asylum for inventing the steam-engine, though no one would have doubted his sanity if he had offered to raise the devil, or to produce the philosopher's stone, or the elixir vitae. Now, these precious possessions have not been more in men's minds than a system of conveniently suspended animation. There is scarcely a peasantry in Europe that does not sing the ballad of the dead bride. This lady, in the legends, always loves the cavalier not selected by her parents, the detrimental cavalier. To avoid the wedding which is thrust on her, she gets an old witch to do what the Australian romancer professes to do--to suspend her animation, and so she is carried on an open bier to a chapel on the border of her lover's lands. There he rides, the right lover, with his men-at-arms, the bride revives just in time, is lifted on to his saddle-bow, and [...] "they need swift steeds that follow" [...] the fugitive pair. The sleeping beauty, who is thrown into so long a swoon by the prick of the fairy thorn, is another very old example, while [...] "Snow-white," [...] in her glass coffin, in the German nursery tale, is a third instance.|$|E
