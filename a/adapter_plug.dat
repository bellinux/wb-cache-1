40|$|The {{technology}} {{to support the}} fully integrated electricity Smart Grid is mostly available today. Because the capital and installation costs for enabling smart transmission lines and distribution substations are high, utilities and their regulating organizations are reluctant to invest the resources and pass the resulting costs on to the ratepayers. On the demand side {{it is more likely}} that businesses will be able to demonstrate that the costs for upgrading to Smart Grid capable demand response devices, such as Smart Meters and centralized automated control systems, can be recovered and will become bottom line benefits as electric rates increase and demand response and time of use pricing become available. Residential energy use is still a large component of delivered electric power. The residential customer base is large and the ability to drive consumer electric usage behavior to models which will be more efficient and conservative is not well known. This research focuses on residential demand side behaviors and will investigate the market potential for a smart appliance <b>adapter</b> <b>plug,</b> which would help the consumer learn and practice automatic and programmed electric use through a centralized home automation and control console. This smart <b>adapter</b> <b>plug</b> and control console technology will be developed and shown to be capable of enabling consumer behavioral changes which can contribute to a reduced energy use and lowered utility costs. A survey is conducted which will evaluate typical consumer attitudes about conservation, energy efficiency and willingness to use this new capability to actively control the total residential energy use...|$|E

5000|$|As of late 2012, {{the most}} widely {{deployed}} HomePlug devices are [...] "adapters", which are standalone modules that plug into wall outlets (or power strips not surge protectors or extension cords) and provide one or more Ethernet ports. In a simple home network, the Internet gateway router connects via Ethernet cable to a powerline adapter, which in turn plugs into a nearby power outlet. A second <b>adapter,</b> <b>plugged</b> into any other outlet in the home, connects via Ethernet cable to any Ethernet device (e.g., computer, printer, IP phone, gaming station). Communications between the router and Ethernet devices are then conveyed over existing home electrical wiring. More complex networks can be implemented by <b>plugging</b> in additional <b>adapters</b> as needed. A powerline adapter may also be plugged into a hub or switch so that it supports multiple Ethernet devices residing in a common room.|$|R

50|$|These {{accessories}} {{allow the}} Nintendo 64 and model 2 SNES (redesigned after {{the launch of}} the N64) to hook up to the television through RF. It was primarily intended for customers with older televisions that lack AV cable support. Since the Nintendo 64 and model 2 SNES lack built-in RF compatibility, the modulator acts as a special <b>adapter</b> that <b>plugs</b> into the Nintendo 64's AV port to give the Nintendo 64 RF compatibility. The RF switch itself is identical in every way to the RF switches released for Nintendo's prior systems (the NES and the SNES) and can be interchanged if needed. This set was later re-released for the GameCube to give it RF capability. The cables intended for the GameCube will also work with the N64 and SNES.|$|R
