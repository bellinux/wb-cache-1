5|$|The ZX Spectrum +2B and ZX Spectrum +3B were {{functionally}} {{similar in}} design to the Spectrum +2A and +3. The main electronic differences being {{changes to the}} generation of the <b>audio</b> <b>output</b> signal to resolve problems with clipping.|$|E
5|$|At the time, Leigh was road manager, stage manager, chauffeur, {{and head}} of security. Vega, who contributed to the album's packaging, helped out with the road crew as much as possible. Tommy's friend Monte Melnick {{occasionally}} helped with the <b>audio</b> <b>output,</b> but this was typically done by Leigh.|$|E
5|$|PCs with a DVI {{interface}} {{are capable}} of video output to an HDMI-enabled monitor. Some PCs include an HDMI interface and may also be capable of HDMI <b>audio</b> <b>output,</b> depending on specific hardware. For example, Intel's motherboard chipsets since the 945G and NVIDIA’s GeForce 8200/8300 motherboard chipsets {{are capable of}} 8-channel LPCM output over HDMI. Eight-channel LPCM <b>audio</b> <b>output</b> over HDMI with a video card was first seen with the ATI Radeon HD 4850, which was released in June 2008 and is implemented by other video cards in the ATI Radeon HD 4000 series. Linux can drive 8-channel LPCM audio over HDMI if the video card has the necessary hardware and implements the Advanced Linux Sound Architecture (ALSA). The ATI Radeon HD 4000 series implements ALSA. Cyberlink announced in June 2008 that they would update their PowerDVD playback software to allow 192kHz/24-bit Blu-ray Disc audio decoding in Q3-Q4 of 2008. Corel's WinDVD 9 Plus currently has 96kHz/24-bit Blu-ray Disc audio decoding.|$|E

5000|$|The analog {{stereo and}} digital <b>audio</b> <b>outputs</b> can be {{connected}} to a TV's audio input or to an audio receiver with surround sound ...|$|R
5|$|ARC is {{an audio}} link meant to replace other cables between the TV and the A/V {{receiver}} or speaker system. This direction is used when the TV {{is the one}} that generates or receives the video stream instead of the other equipment. A typical case is the running of an app on a smart TV such as Netflix, but reproduction of audio is handled by the other equipment. Without ARC, the <b>audio</b> <b>output</b> from the TV needs to be routed by another cable, typically TOS-Link or coax, into the speaker system.|$|E
5|$|The second {{generation}} Mac Pro has a redesigned configuration of ports. It has a HDMI 1.4 port, dual Gigabit Ethernet ports, six Thunderbolt 2 ports, four USB 3 ports, and combined digital Mini-TOSlink optical / analog 3.5mm stereo mini jack for <b>audio</b> <b>output.</b> It {{also has a}} headphones mini jack (the two are distinctly selectable within the Sound System Preference panel, Output tab). There is no dedicated port for inputting audio. The system has a low-fidelity internal mono speaker. The Thunderbolt 2 ports support up to thirty-six Thunderbolt devices (six per port) and can concurrently support up to three 4K displays. This design requires two GPUs to support the seven display outputs (HDMI and six Thunderbolt). The I/O panel illuminates itself when the unit senses it has been moved {{to make it easier}} for the user to see the ports. Unlike the previous model, it has no FireWire 800 ports, dedicated digital audio in/out ports, a SuperDrive, DVI port, 3.5-inch drive bays for replaceable storage drives, or changeable internal PCIe slots. Instead, there are six Thunderbolt 2 ports to connect high-speed external peripherals, including enclosures for internal PCIe cards.|$|E
25|$|The Mac Mini can be {{used for}} home cinema (theater) applications. The small footprint, multi-format video output, digital <b>audio</b> <b>output,</b> remote control IR {{receiver}} and the relatively powerful Intel CPUs make it easy to use the Mac Mini as part of a home entertainment system.|$|E
5000|$|In {{order to}} create to S-video output, Nintendo's RP2C02 PPU was {{replaced}} by an RGB-output-compatible [...] "RC2C05-99" [...] PPU. Here, RGB video signals generated within the composite outputs were converted to the external S-video signals. At {{the rear of the}} Titler's body, RCA composite-pin video <b>outputs</b> and mono <b>audio</b> <b>outputs</b> were located, and peripheral devices could connect only when the video and <b>audio</b> <b>outputs</b> to the associated TV also employed RF connectors and S-Video. This allowed gamers to enjoy a crisper image.|$|R
5000|$|Each system {{provides}} {{a set of}} video and <b>audio</b> <b>outputs</b> to connect directly to a TV (either standard definition or high definition) and audio system ...|$|R
5000|$|In {{order to}} make a device that plays HDCP-enabled work, the {{manufacturer}} must obtain a license from Intel subsidiary Digital Content Protection LLC, pay an annual fee, and submit to various conditions. For example, the device cannot be designed to copy; it must [...] "frustrate attempts to defeat the content protection requirements"; it must not transmit high definition protected video to non-HDCP receivers; and DVD-Audio works can be played only at CD-audio quality by non-HDCP digital <b>audio</b> <b>outputs</b> (analog <b>audio</b> <b>outputs</b> have no quality limits).|$|R
25|$|The {{album was}} remastered again in 2014 by veteran {{mastering}} engineer Bob Ludwig, {{who has worked}} on much of Springsteen's <b>audio</b> <b>output</b> since 1982, for release as part of The Album Collection Vol. 1 1973–1984, a boxed set composed of remastered editions of his first seven albums. It was later released in remastered form as a single disc as well.|$|E
25|$|Some {{electronic}} stethoscopes feature direct <b>audio</b> <b>output</b> {{that can}} be used with an external recording device, such as a laptop or MP3 recorder. The same connection can be used to listen to the previously recorded auscultation through the stethoscope headphones, allowing for more detailed study for general research as well as evaluation and consultation regarding a particular patient's condition and telemedicine, or remote diagnosis.|$|E
25|$|Because {{the sounds}} are {{transmitted}} electronically, an electronic stethoscope {{can be a}} wireless device, can be a recording device, and can provide noise reduction, signal enhancement, and both visual and <b>audio</b> <b>output.</b> Around 2001, Stethographics introduced PC-based software which enabled a phonocardiograph, graphic representation of cardiologic and pulmonologic sounds to be generated, and interpreted according to related algorithms. All of these features are helpful for purposes of telemedicine (remote diagnosis) and teaching.|$|E
50|$|Many of the Aspire laptops, such as model 8920G, {{have built}} in Blu-ray drives, 5.1 <b>audio</b> <b>outputs</b> and {{transflective}} displays. Acer {{was the first}} to include these drives in laptops.|$|R
50|$|Logitech's own Squeezebox {{hardware}} players {{exist in}} a variety of configurations, offering wired and wireless Ethernet, analog and digital <b>audio</b> <b>outputs,</b> touchscreen interfaces and a variety of remote controlled options.|$|R
50|$|Early {{versions}} of dual processor G5 computers have noise problems. The {{first one is}} ground loop-based interference, which sometimes causes noise leaks into the analog <b>audio</b> <b>outputs.</b> This bug was fixed in Rev. B G5.|$|R
25|$|Wireless {{speakers}} {{are very}} similar to traditional (wired) loudspeakers, but they receive audio signals using radio frequency (RF) waves rather than over audio cables. There is normally an amplifier integrated in the speaker's cabinet because the RF waves alone are not enough to drive the speaker. This integration of amplifier and loudspeaker is known as an active loudspeaker. Manufacturers of these loudspeakers design them to be as lightweight as possible while producing the maximum amount of <b>audio</b> <b>output</b> efficiency.|$|E
25|$|The {{original}} Intel-based Mac Mini {{includes four}} USB 2.0 ports and one FireWire 400 port. Networking is supported {{with a built-in}} Gigabit Ethernet port and an integrated 802.11b/g AirPort card. Bluetooth was also made standard. External displays are supported through a DVI port. While the Mac Mini G4 supports only analog <b>audio</b> <b>output,</b> the Intel-based Mac Mini has separate Mini-TOSLINK/3.5mm mini-jacks that support both analog audio input and output as well optical digital S/PDIF input and output.|$|E
25|$|Following World War II, tubes {{intended}} {{to be used in}} series heater strings were redesigned to all have the same ("controlled") warm-up time. Earlier designs had quite-different thermal time constants. The <b>audio</b> <b>output</b> stage, for instance, had a larger cathode, and warmed up more slowly than lower-powered tubes. The result was that heaters that warmed up faster also temporarily had higher resistance, because of their positive temperature coefficient. This disproportionate resistance caused them to temporarily operate with heater voltages well above their ratings, and shortened their life.|$|E
50|$|Many of the Aspire laptops, such as model 8920G, have {{built-in}} Blu-ray drives, 5.1 <b>audio</b> <b>outputs</b> and Transflective displays. Acer was {{the first}} to include these drives in laptops. Most Aspire laptops have water-resistant screens, such as the 1410 and the 5741 Z.|$|R
50|$|Since the NTIA did {{not require}} CECBs to output MTS stereo signals via their {{radio-frequency}} output, THAT Corporation noted that consumers using RF-only connections with CECBs will lose stereo TV sound. This problem may be avoided by using the converter's line level <b>audio</b> <b>outputs.</b>|$|R
50|$|The Prophet '08 has {{two sets}} of stereo <b>audio</b> <b>outputs.</b> All of the sound comes out set A, unless set B has plugs in it, {{in which case the}} second layer {{in the case of a}} split or stacked program will appear only on set B.|$|R
25|$|A basic karaoke machine {{consists}} of a music player, microphone inputs, a means of altering the pitch of the played music, and an <b>audio</b> <b>output.</b> Some low-end machines attempt to provide vocal suppression so that one can feed regular songs into the machine and remove {{the voice of the}} original singer; however, this is rarely effective. Most common machines are CD+G, Laser Disc, VCD or DVD players with microphone inputs and an audio mixer built in. CD+G players use a special track called subcode to encode the lyrics and pictures displayed on the screen while other formats natively display both audio and video.|$|E
25|$|Accessed {{with the}} Wii Remote's HOME button, the HOME Menu {{displays}} {{information about the}} controller(s) currently being used, and allows the user to configure certain options. At {{the bottom of the}} menu screen, the battery life of all connected controllers is displayed. Below that is a bar labeled Wii Remote Settings. Selecting it brings users to an options screen where they can control the <b>audio</b> <b>output</b> volume, rumble settings, and reconnect the controllers, for example to connect Wii Remotes through one-time synchronization. Depending on when the HOME Menu is accessed, there will be a different amount of buttons displayed.|$|E
25|$|Essentially, amplifying an {{electric}} violin {{is exactly the}} same as amplifying a guitar. They both produce an <b>audio</b> <b>output</b> which is transferred through an audio cable into an amp or PA. For this reason, there are few amps that are specifically for violin, and even those can be repurposed for guitar. Most electric violinists use standard guitar amplifiers. The advantage with using guitar amps is that they have been used for years and their sound is reliable, though not all guitar amps will give a desired tone. Some prefer the more mellow tone of tube amps over solid state amps and digital PA's for violins.|$|E
50|$|This FM synth {{itself has}} stereo <b>audio</b> <b>outputs,</b> an input for a {{purpose-built}} four-octave keyboard, {{and a pair}} of MIDI Input/Output ports {{that could be used for}} normal MIDI on the second revision of the CX5M but only management of data from a Yamaha DX7 on the first model.|$|R
5000|$|PUMA: Protected User Mode Audio (PUMA) {{is the new}} User Mode Audio (UMA) audio stack. Its aim is {{to provide}} an {{environment}} for audio playback that restricts the copying of copyrighted audio, and restricts the enabled <b>audio</b> <b>outputs</b> to those allowed by {{the publisher of the}} protected content.|$|R
50|$|The {{back panel}} has quarter-inch jacks for {{recording}} data to cassette tape (one also doubling as a footswitch input), MIDI {{in and out}} DIN connectors, separate quarter-inch <b>audio</b> <b>outputs</b> {{for each of the}} two sounds and a mix audio out (both sounds combined), a power switch, and a fuse socket.|$|R
25|$|The PS3 {{supports}} numerous SDTV and HDTV resolutions (from 480i/576i up to 1080p) and connectivity options (such as HDMI 1.3a and component video). In {{terms of}} audio, the PS3 supports {{a number of}} formats, including 7.1 digital audio, Dolby TrueHD, DTS-HD Master Audio and others; <b>audio</b> <b>output</b> is possible over stereo RCA cables (analog), optical digital cables, or HDMI. The PS3 slim features an upgraded HDMI chip that allows bitstreaming of lossless audio codecs to an external receiver (earlier versions had to decode the signal internally before outputting it via LPCM). For the optical disc drive, {{a wide variety of}} DVD and CD formats are supported, as well as Blu-ray Discs. A 20, 40, 60, 80, 120, 160, 250, 320, or 500GB 2.5-inch SATA 150 hard disk is preinstalled. In the early 60GB and 80GB configurations, flash memory can also be used, either Memory Sticks; CompactFlash cards; or SD/MMC cards. All models support USB memory devices; flash drives and external hard drives are both automatically recognized. However, they must be formatted with the FAT32 file system. For communication, the system sported four USB 2.0 ports at the front on the 20 and 60GB models as well as the NTSC 80GB model, but the 40GB and 80GB PAL models only have two USB ports. All models (80 and 160GB) released after August 2008 have been reduced to two USB ports, as well as dropping CompactFlash and SD card support. One Gigabit Ethernet port, Bluetooth 2.0 support, and built-in Wi-Fi (except CECHBxx).|$|E
500|$|The Sinclair models {{featured}} audio line in and out, in {{the form}} of an [...] "ear" [...] and [...] "mic" [...] socket. An external tape recorder was needed to load the majority of software released, or the ZX Microdrive. Either socket could be connected to headphones or an amplifier as an <b>audio</b> <b>output,</b> although this would not disable the internal speaker.|$|E
500|$|The DSi {{has more}} RAM and a faster CPU than the DS Lite. [...] Developers {{reported}} the console has a native mode, which runs software {{specifically designed for}} its hardware, access to the system's extra processing and memory resources. The inclusion of a codec integrated circuit (a microchip) amplifies sound signals and converts them from digital to analog. This increases <b>audio</b> <b>output,</b> and depending on the mode, higher audio quality. Unused space on the motherboard was removed; the CPU was relocated, and the battery housing was expanded.|$|E
50|$|The box had {{high-end}} hardware, including HDMI, {{component video}} outputs, and coaxial (SPDIF) and optical (TosLink) digital <b>audio</b> <b>outputs.</b> The box also had USB and Ethernet ports, although {{these were not}} activated in the last release of the firmware. An HDMI or DVI connection was required to watch HD content, which was in 720p resolution.|$|R
50|$|AJA Video Systems IO Express: Starting with Media Composer v5.5, Avid {{has added}} {{support for the}} AJA Video Systems IO Express {{interface}}. This interface will allow SD/HD input and output via SDI and HDMI. It also has analog video and <b>audio</b> <b>outputs</b> for monitoring. It connects to a desktop or laptop computer via PCIe or ExpressCard/34 interface.|$|R
50|$|Windows Sound System (WSS) was a {{sound card}} {{specification}} developed by Microsoft released {{at the end of}} 1992 for Windows 3.1. WSS featured support for up to 16-bit 48 kHz digital sampling, better than the contemporary Sound Blaster Pro. Also, the WSS featured RCA analog <b>audio</b> <b>outputs,</b> an uncommon feature among sound cards of this era.|$|R
