5|$|Lawrence {{attended}} {{the public schools}} of Canton and Pierre, then enrolled at St. Olaf College in Northfield, Minnesota, but transferred after {{a year to the}} University of South Dakota in Vermillion. He completed his bachelor's degree in chemistry in 1922, and his Master of Arts (M.A.) degree in physics from the University of Minnesota in 1923 under the supervision of William Francis Gray Swann. For his master's thesis, Lawrence built an experimental apparatus that rotated <b>an</b> <b>ellipsoid</b> through a magnetic field.|$|E
5|$|The spores are 7.5–9 by 6.5–7.5µm, with <b>an</b> <b>ellipsoid</b> shape. Their {{surfaces}} are ornamented with warts and short ridges {{that do not}} form a reticulum (a network of raised net-like ridges on the surface), with ridges up to 1.0µm high. The spores are hyaline (translucent), and amyloid—they absorb iodine when stained with Melzer's reagent. The basidia (spore-bearing cells) are four-spored, and measure 42 by 9µm. The cap cuticle is a modified ixotrichoderm, meaning that the hyphae are embedded in a slimy or gelatinous layer.|$|E

40|$|We {{improved}} our customized OpenGL-based {{program for}} the interactive, rendered representation of large ensembles of rigid bodies whose shape {{is not necessarily a}} sphere [1], which is useful especially in the coarse-grained simulation of liquid crystals, but also of biologic systems.

5|$|The spores are {{translucent}} (hyaline), smooth, have <b>an</b> <b>ellipsoid</b> shape, with {{dimensions of}} 12–16 by 3–5µm. Spores contain {{one or two}} oil droplets. The imperfect (conidial) form of the fungus produces smooth, hyaline spores that are 3–3.5 by 1–2µm. The asci – sexual spore-bearing cells – have a cylindrical shape, with dimensions of 115–125 by 8–10µm. The paraphyses (sterile filamentous cells interspersed among the asci) are cylindrical with slightly swollen tips, and few branches.|$|E
5|$|The basidiospores are 10.5–13.5 by 6.5–8µm with <b>an</b> <b>ellipsoid</b> shape. The basidia (spore-bearing cells) are 35–55 by 10–15µm, and four-spored. Pleurocystidia (cystidia on the gill faces) are 70–110 by 25–45µm, {{fusiform}} (spindle-shaped), utriform (shaped like {{a leather}} bottle) or lageniform (flask shaped); some have an apical excrescence (outgrowth). Cheilocystidia (cystidia on the gill edge) are 60–75 by 15–27µm, commonly fusiform or utriform; they cover completely the gill edge. The cap cuticle is an ixocutis (parallel hyphae {{embedded in a}} gelatinous matrix). The stipitipellis is a cutis (parallel hyphae not embedded in a gelatinous matrix). Caulocystidia (cystidia on the stipe surface) are sometimes present, and they are 100–360 by 10–20µm and mostly cylindrical.|$|E
5|$|The {{spore print}} is brown. Spores {{typically}} measure 8.0–9.0 by 4.0–5.5µm, and have <b>an</b> <b>ellipsoid</b> to oblong to ovoid shape, {{depending on the}} viewing angle. Basidia (spore-bearing cells) are narrowly club-shaped, four-spored, and have dimensions of 24–40 by 7–12µm. The cheilochrysocystidia (found on the gill edge) are club-shaped, measuring 30–55 by 4–40µm, with a neck that is 2–5µm wide. Pleurochrysocystidia (on the gill face) are 40–60 by 5–18µm with a 2–4µm-wide neck. Clamp connections are abundant in all tissues of S.caerulea. The fungus produces acanthocytes, which are spiny cells produced on short branches on the mycelium.|$|E

5|$|Viewed in deposit, such {{as with a}} spore print, {{the spores}} of A. daucipes are white, cream, or {{yellowish}} in color. Viewed with a microscope, they have <b>an</b> <b>ellipsoid</b> to elongate shape (sometimes kidney-shape, or reniform), and dimensions of 8–11 by 5–7µm. They are translucent (hyaline), with thin walls, and are amyloid, meaning that they absorb iodine when stained Melzer's reagent. The basidia (the spore-bearing cells) are 30–50 by 7–11µm, club-shaped, and 4-spored, with clamps at their bases. The cheilocystidia are abundant, small, roughly spherical to club-shaped cells, with dimensions of 15–40 by 10–28µm. The cap cuticle is between 75 and 180µm thick, and consists of a dense layer of thin-walled, interwoven, and slightly gelatinized hyphae that are 2–5µm in diameter. Clamp connections {{are present in the}} hyphae of this species.|$|E

25|$|The {{geological}} {{history of}} the Moon has been defined into six major epochs, called the lunar geologic timescale.
