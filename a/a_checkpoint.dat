5|$|In 1996, {{the trail}} was rerouted through Pelly Crossing and <b>a</b> <b>checkpoint</b> was added there, and the Lake Laberge stretch was {{replaced}} by a route through Braeburn and along the Dawson-Whitehorse Overland Trail. In 1997, mushers were routed through the Chena River Lakes Flood Control Project and to the Alaska town of North Pole before continuing on to Fairbanks. The North Pole loop was removed before the 2009 race, and mushers were directed through Two Rivers instead. Starting in the 2010 race, the Mile 101 location was upgraded from a dog drop to a full-fledged checkpoint. In the past several races, the Two Rivers checkpoint has changed locations annually: from a lodge to a campground, and then to a gravel pit in 2011.|$|E
40|$|Researchers {{from many}} {{different}} areas have demands for computational power to solve their specific problems. Today, many are successfully using implementations of MPI, a standard message passing interface, on parallel and distributed environments to satisfy their computational requirement. In general, <b>checkpointing</b> <b>a</b> parallel/distributed program {{is more complex than}} <b>checkpointing</b> <b>a</b> sequential program. <b>Checkpointing</b> provides the backbone for rollback recovery (fault-tolerance), playback debugging, process migration and job swapping.

40|$|Abstract — Performance of <b>a</b> <b>checkpointing</b> based {{multiple}} {{fault tolerance}} is low. The main reason is overheads associate with <b>checkpointing.</b> <b>A</b> <b>checkpointing</b> algorithm {{can be improved}} by improved storing strategy and checkpointing scheduling. Improved storage strategy and checkpointing scheduling will reduce the overheads associated with checkpointing. Performance and efficiency is most desirable feature of recovery based on checkpointing. In this paper important critical issues involved in fast and efficient recovery are discussed based on checkpointing. Impact of each issue on performance of checkpointing based recovery is also discussed. Relationships among issues are also explored. Finally comparisons of important issues are done between coordinated checkpointing and uncoordinated checkpointing...|$|R

5|$|Rejected by {{his former}} comrades and hunted by the Allies, Himmler {{attempted}} {{to go into}} hiding. He had not made extensive preparations for this, but he had equipped himself with a forged paybook {{under the name of}} Sergeant Heinrich Hitzinger.

On 21 May, Himmler and two aides were stopped and detained at <b>a</b> <b>checkpoint</b> set up by former Soviet POWs. Over the following two days, he was moved around to several camps and was brought to the British 31st Civilian Interrogation Camp near Lüneburg, on 23 May.|$|E

5|$|Dishonored is an action-adventure {{game played}} from a first-person {{perspective}} {{with an emphasis}} on stealth action and the use of gadgets and the environment to eliminate opposing forces. The game world is a series of self-contained, mission-focused areas designed for multiple avenues of exploration in terms of in-game movement and powers. Between missions, the player is taken to a central hub called the Hound Pits pub where the player character Corvo can meet with his allies, receive mission briefings and alternate objectives, and convert recovered loot into new equipment and upgrades. In-game areas include loading docks, royal estates, poverty-stricken streets, and a bathhouse. The player can save their progress anywhere, and the game includes <b>a</b> <b>checkpoint</b> save system. Saving is disabled during combat. The game has four difficulty levels which modify the effectiveness of health and mana (magic) potions, and enemies' awareness, damage delivered, and responsiveness. In the easy setting, health regeneration is possible.|$|E
5|$|The player {{takes on}} the role of various {{characters}} during a single-player campaign. The characters' involvement in the plot occurs simultaneously and overlaps the events in the game. As such, the player's perspective changes from one character to another between missions. Each mission features a series of objectives; the player is led to each objective with the heads up display, which marks its direction and distance. Some objectives require that the player arrives at <b>a</b> <b>checkpoint,</b> while other objectives require the player to eliminate enemies in a specified location, stand their ground to defend an objective, or plant explosive charges on an enemy installation. After the credits, a special epilogue mission is unlocked for play, featuring a four-man squad retrieving a VIP from terrorists who have hijacked an airliner. The SAS rescue the VIP and escape before the plane is destroyed. The main campaign features 30 collectible pieces of intel that award the player with game cheats and visual filters such as infinite ammunition, cluster grenades, and increased contrast.|$|E

Blazkowicz awakens from his vegetative state as {{he is about to}} be executed, killing the extermination squad and escaping the asylum with Anya. Blazkowicz and Anya drive to her grandparents' farm, where they inform him that the Nazis won the war by forcing the United States to surrender in 1948, and that the members of the ensuing Resistance were captured. Blazkowicz interrogates a captured officer from the asylum (he was hidden in the trunk of a car), learning that the top members of the Resistance are imprisoned in Berlin before brutally executing him with a chainsaw. Anya's grandparents smuggle her and Blazkowicz through <b>a</b> <b>checkpoint</b> in Stettin before they travel to Berlin. During the train ride, Blazkowicz and Anya enter into a romantic relationship. When they arrive, Anya helps Blazkowicz break into the prison, where he rescues the person he spared {{fourteen years}} prior (Fergus or Wyatt) and finds that the Resistance movement is a revived Kreisau Circle led by Caroline Becker (Bonita Friedericy), who was left paralyzed due to her injuries at Isenstadt.|$|E

5|$|A few further violent {{incidents}} occurred until February 22, when Governor-General of French Indochina Pierre Pasquier {{declared that}} the insurrection had been defeated. On February 10, a policeman was injured by a VNQDĐ member at <b>a</b> <b>checkpoint</b> in Hanoi; at night, arts students pelted government buildings with bombs. The buildings were targeted because they symbolised what the students regarded as the colonial state's repressive power. On the night of February 15 and the early morning of February 16, the nearby villages of Phu Duc in Thái Bình Province and Vĩnh Bảo in Hải Dương Province were seized {{for a few hours}} by the leader of the VNQDĐ, Nguyễn Thái Học, and his remaining forces. In the first case, the VNQDD fighters disguised themselves as colonial troops and managed to trick their opponents, before seizing the military post in the town. In the process, they wounded three guards and disarmed the post. In the second village, the local mandarin of the French colonial government, Tri Huyen, was murdered. After being driven out, the VNQDĐ fled to the village of Co Am. On February 16, French warplanes responded by bombarding the settlement. It {{was the first time that}} air power had been used in Indochina. Five wooden Potez 35 biplanes dropped 60 10kg bombs on the village and raked machine-gun fire indiscriminately, killing 200, mostly civilians. On the same day, Tonkin's Resident Superior René Robin, ordered a mopping-up operation involving two hundred Gardes indigènes, eight French commanders and two Sûreté inspectors. The insurrection was officially declared over on February 22, after Hoc and his lieutenants, Pho Duc Chinh and Nguyen Thanh Loi, were apprehended while trying to flee into China. Robin told his officials to publicise the punitive bombing of the village in order to intimidate and dissuade other settlements from supporting the VNQDĐ.|$|E
