The {{purpose of this study}} was to investigate whether persons with pronounced aging signs such as graying of hair, baldness, or facial wrinkles are prone to a shorter life span compared to their contemporaries. Methods. In the Copenhagen City Heart Study comprising a random sample of 20, 000 men and women, we also recorded, in addition to cardiovascular risk factors, data on signs of aging: extent of gray hair, baldness, facial wrin-kles, and <b>arcus</b> <b>senilis</b> (corneal arcus). During 16 years of follow-up, 3, 939 persons (1, 656 women and 2, 283 men) had died. The Cox regression model for proportional hazards, which included age as an explanatory variable, was used for descriptive analysis of the correlation between these aging signs and all-cause mortality. Results. We found no correlation between the mortality and the extent of graying of the hair, or baldness or facial wrinkles in either of the sexes, irrespective of age. A single exception was observed in a small subgroup of men with no gray hair. They had a slightly, but significantly, lower mortality than the rest [relative risk (RR) =. 81, 95 % confi-dence interval (CI). 67 -. 98; p <. 05].

The {{purpose of the study}} was to determine the prevalence of the three major blinding conditions in the elderly, namely senile cataract, chronic open-angle glaucoma and age related macular degeneration. The study population was a random sample of the surviving cohort of the Household Survey, which had previously been carried out by the Department of Community Health. Participants were asked to attend a special eye clinic in Melton Mowbray, where each was examined by an Ophthalmologist and an Ophthalmic Optician. The examination included measurement of visual acuity, refraction slit-lamp examination and fundus examination and photography after mydriasis. 529 persons from a study population of 677, participated in the study a response rate of 78 %. The prevalence of senile cataract was 55. 9 %, chronic open angle glaucoma 4. 5 % and age-related macular degeneration 42 %. Only 1. 1 % of the study participants had diabetic retinopathy.

Ultrastructural study of a skin biopsy specimen and fibroblast pellet showed membrane-bound spherical vacuoles containing lipid material. Cultured fibroblasts stained by filipin, a fluorescent probe that specifically binds unesterified cholesterol, showed abnormal cytoplasmic fluorescent material, suggesting abnormal cholesterol metabolism. The presence of neurological impairment, associated with SCCD in 1 of our cases, may be regarded as coincidental.

Perceived age was recorded by an observer {{and the difference between}} this age and chronological age was analysed according to 20  different variables.  RESULTS—Men had an average perceived age of 0. 37  years older than their actual age and women a perceived age of 0. 54  years younger. In men, looking older was related to greying of the hair, grade of <b>arcus</b> <b>senilis,</b> and grade of baldness. Less expected, looking older was positively related to total serum cholesterol (p= 0. 03) and blood haemoglobin (p< 0. 01).

WVhen one's attention is fixed on the existence of tlhese tumours, one gets the impression that they occur more frequently than one originally expected. TIhe reason that I am giving special attention to the xanthelasmata is the accidental circumstance that I had to treat several members of one familv wlho were not only bearers of these tumours, but were also suffering from various kinds of alllergic diseases, such as asthma, hay fever, urtica-ria, eczema and mzigraine (see pedigree). Whrlien patients with xanthelasmata are carefully interrogated, thley, themselves, show almost without any- exception one or more types of allergy and, if tlhev do not, other members of the family dlo.

The following case gives a good picture of the intimate relation whlich exists between the apparently different kinds of these diseases in one family. A lady with xanthelasmata gets urticaria after eating strawberries or after taking aspirin. In two of her sisters urticaria breaks out after contact with a primula obconica.

40|$|Summary Since Western New Guinea until fairly {{recently}} {{has remained a}} relatively isolated continent and ophthalmological diseases such as trachoma therefore might justifiably be expected to manifest themselves in a 'pure natural history,' {{an attempt was made}} to determine as closely as conditions would permit the prevalence, nature and natural course of trachoma and other eye diseases in this area. To that end, six geographically different regions including coastal mountains, islands, high mountain ranges and swamps, were visited by the author over the years 1961 and I 962. In order to acquaint the reader with the nature of the country of which part of the population was examined, a brief description of each ~f the regions visited has been given in the Introduction. Since Western New Guinea {{is one of the most}} rugged and inaccessible countries of the world, the most divergent means of transport had to be used during the survey. The method of examination had to remain limited to routine ophthalmological investigation. Examination was carried out with the hand slit-lamp, conjunctiva 1 scrapings were taken and photographic documentation was made. Method and procedure have been set out in the Introduction. A representative sample of the population was exarnined, based upon a sampling unit, which was defined as al 1 inhabitants of a village hut. A total of 7963 aborigines, being an estimated I per cent of the entire Papuan population of Western New Guinea, has been examined. Trachoma was present in an average of jj% of the individuals examined. The condition ran a very mild course in the majority of cases. The trachomatous process on the upper eyelid is chiefly located at the upper tarsal border and adjacent supratarsal conjunctiva. A more extensive spread of the process is not exceptional, however. The percentage of active trachoma cases in which tarsal follicles were present ranged from 35 to 86 % in the various regions. Scar formation was in genera 1 only slight and usually remained iimited to the upper tarsal border and adjacent supratarsal conjunctiva. On the lower eyelid, scar formation developed exceptionally and then only to a sight extent. The pannus prevalence rates in the various districts ranged from 0. 3 to 68 per cent of the total number of trachoma cases. The extension of the cornea 1 vascular infiltration usually amounted to only a few milimetres. Among 4237 cases of trachoma only I case of binocular blindness, I case of monocular blindness and 6 cases of (mostly monocular) reduced visual acuity resulting from trachoma were observed. These figures are a positive demonstration of the benign nature of trachoma in Western New Guinea. The average percentage of trachoma in the various regions ranged from j 8 to 67 per cent of those examined. The distribution of trachoma prevalence over the various age groups showed identical characteristics in al 1 regions screened. Below the age of I year the trachoma prevalence already amounts from 30 to 10 per cent. This strongly suggests trachoma to be a domestic infection. The maximal trachoma prevalence is reached at the age of 2 on the average, followed by a continuous fa 11 in prevalence which is steepest before the age of zo and gradually flattens out after that age. The fa 11 in prevalence differs markedly in the various districts. In order to analyze this discrepancy, the prevalence of the different trachoma stages has been determined as wel 1 and represented in graphs. Comparison of the prevalence rate curves of the various trachoma stages clearly shows that the prevalence curves of trachoma stages Mac Callan I + 11 in al 1 regions with advancing age decrease according to a parabolic curve. The Trachoma 111 prevalence rate curves show only minor variations and the rise of the Trachoma IV prevalence rate curves differs markedly in al 1 regions visited. In addition, it could be shown that the difference in decrease of trachoma prevalence at the advanced ages is largely determined by the percentage of spontaneous cures with sequelae (such as scars or pannus) which differs widely from district to district. The percentage of total spontaneous cures, which is the percentage of spontaneous cures with restitutio ad integrum, added to the percentage Trachoma IV as present in an advanced age group, in several areas ranged from 64,~ to 79 % (expressed as percentages of the maximal prevalence of the pertinent area). This percentage is independent of the average trachoma prevalence. The percentage of spontaneous cures which leave no traces is calculated from the difference between maximal and minima 1 trachoma prevalence rates. It is argued that the age groups with minima 1 trachoma prevalence are quite likely to contain an unknown number of clinically visible reinfections. Since we have proceeded from the assumption that the maximum prevalence groups (which are those of the first years of life) do not contain reinfection cases, the calculated percentages of total spontaneous cures are to be regarded as rninirnt/m percentages. A total of 302 conjunctiva 1 smears was made for diagnostic purposes. This explains why they have come mainly from cases in the follicular stage without either pannus or scar formation. In 60 % the smears were positive for inclusions. Those smears which had been obtained from either normal eyes or eyes showing slight papillary hypertrophy only, were als 0 positive for inclusions in resp. 60 and 40 % of the cases. This shows beyond doubt the existente of healthy virus carriers. The distribution of trachoma cases over the sampling units (family units) indicates that in an area with a lower trachoma prevalence, a considerable horizontal distribution of the infection nevertheless is present. For instance, in the Mimika area an average trachoma prevalence of 38 % has been established; yet 80 % of the family units proved to be infected. An even more striking example than this is found in the Upper-Digul region, in which an average trachoma prevalence of 61 % is present. Upon investigation al 1 houses (farnily units) proved to be infected. On the basis of these findings the conclusion is drawn that the virus prevalence considerably exceeds the value which one would be inclined to expect from the trachoma prevalence curves. In al 1 regions the Trachoma I + 11 prevalence rate curves decrease steadily following a parabolic curve, reaching a value of between 9 and 2 j% in the age groups 3 I to jo years. Such a constant feature of the Trachoma I + 11 curves in al 1 regions so highly different from each other, indicates that the Same factors underlie the natura 1 course of trachoma anywhere. These factors are inherent to the disease. Environmental influences at best may modify the manner of healing (with or without leaving scars). After consideration of some epidemiological factors which underlie the spread of an infectious disease within a community, the following conclusion is arrived at: Irrespective of still largely unknown factors such as possible differences between virus strains, the course of the various trachoma prevalence rate curves is deterrnined by the factors infection, re-(super-) infection and immunity. In a certain community in which environmental and living conditions have remained unchanged for a long period of time, this host-virus relationship is balanced. Depending on the intensity of the host-virus circulation this equilibrium may be achieved at different levels, the height of which wil 1 influence the clinical character of trachoma, in particular the frequency and extent of scar formation. The height of this level does not, however, influence the tendency of spontaneous healing, as is proved by the near-identical fa 11 of Trachoma I + 11 prevalence rate curves in areas which diverge widely from an epidemiological point of view. Changes in environmental and living conditions disturb such an equilibrium. This is illustrated by the course of the trachoma prevalence rate curve of the Upper-Digul region. In this area, the population only very recently changed from a nomadic to a settled way of life, which resulted in an increase of inter-personal contacts. Following this, the increased rapidity of virus passage caused a change in the quantitative relation between host and circulating virus, leading to an increase in prevalence. Continuance of this process is to be expected until a new equilibrium at a different level is established. The way of living of the aborigines in the various regions affects the percentage of spontaneous cures with restitutio ad integrum in such a manner that this percentage is in inverse ratio to the chances of reinfection and superinfection. In other words, the character of trachoma in a certain region depends on the frequency and intensity of viral re-and super-infections. It goes without saying that other factors, as yet unknown, may co-determine the course of trachoma. In females, after they have reached the reproductive age, the trachoma prevalence exceeds that of males. This observation is explained by the increased chance of re-(super-) infection because of the intense contact of women with their children. The influence of chronic bacterial super-infections on the course of trachoma could be demonstrated in the densely populated Schouten Islands where trachoma frequently runs a severe course. This can also be explained by the increased chances of viral re- or super-infections. The data obtained by comparison of the various regions provide strong arguments against the assumption of climate, light, sand, dust or flies having a predominent influence on the course of trachoma in Western New Guinea. Study of the features of endernic trachoma leads to the conclusion that trachoma in Western New Guinea is a disease with a high degree of infectivity and a low degree of virulence. Into malignant types it changes only when favoured by very poor hygienic conditions, possibly in combination with other factors such as bacterial superinfection. It is argued that any statement on the maiignancy of trachoma based upon clinica 1 data is deceptive, because the symptom-free cases which in many countries constitute the large majority of cases, are not seen by the clinician. Because of this, the clinica 1 concept of trachoma which emphasizes the malignancy of this disease, is incorrect. Finally some suggestions are made for the planning and policy of mass treatment campaigns. It is stressed that a fundamentally correct knowledge of the real prevalence of trachoma can only be obtained by means of a virus sample survey of a statistically representative sample of the population, including healthy people. The reasons why general therapeutic measures against trachoma in Western New Guinea are not necessary, are set out. An exception to this is made for the Schouten Islands, where a full investigation has not been carried out for various reasons. The preliminary impression of the Schouten Island population however is that malignant types of trachoma occur frequently. A plea is made for closer study of the situation there. In Part 11 the frequency and the causes of blindness in Western New Guinea are dealt with. Excluding the pilot study, only I j blind people were seen among a total of 7808 individuals. The percentage of monocular biindness amounts to 1. 67 %. Senile cataract is the most important cause of blindness. Among the causes of blindness trachoma plays a minor role. The importance of 'preventable diseases,' such as injuries and inflammations in the aetiology of a large number of cases of blindness, is stressed. Because of the slight chances of survival for blind people, and in particular for blind infants, in a primitive society, the 'preventable diseases' assume a still larger importance than one would be led to infer from the table representing the causes of blindness. Part 111 deals with the ocular disorders due to Vitamin A deficiency and with <b>arcus</b> <b>senilis,</b> immature cataract, pterygium, glaucoma and artefacts. Other miscellaneous ocular affections are listed in a table. The presence of eye-disease, due to Vitamin A deficiency has been established. The make-up and primary goal of our mass screening survey, however, did not allow us to acquire a fuller knowledge of the importance of this disorder. The prevalence of <b>arcus</b> <b>senilis</b> in the various age groups of the samples of the various regions has been compared. This inter-regional comparison indicated the prevalence in Western New Guinea to be highest in those regions where harsh conditions of life prevail. This is explained by referring to the rapid ageing of the Western New Guinea natives, especially those who are exposed to extremely unfavourable living conditions. The prevalence of pterygium in the various regions varies considerably. In the Tamrau Mountain population it amounted to I. I of the examined individuals of 41 years and over, whereas in the Radja Ampat archipelago the prevalence amounted to 23 % of the Same age group. The author feels that conti. nuous intensive solar radiation constitutes an important factor in the development of ptergygium. Blindness due to ptergygium is present only in individuals over 35 years of age. ...|$|E
