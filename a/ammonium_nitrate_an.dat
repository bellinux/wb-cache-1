50|$|<b>Ammonium</b> <b>nitrate</b> is <b>an</b> {{important}} fertilizer {{with the}} NPK rating 34-0-0 (34% nitrogen). It is less concentrated than urea (46-0-0), giving <b>ammonium</b> <b>nitrate</b> <b>a</b> slight transportation disadvantage. <b>Ammonium</b> <b>nitrate's</b> advantage over urea {{is that it}} is more stable and does not rapidly lose nitrogen to the atmosphere.

50|$|<b>Ammonium</b> <b>nitrate</b> has <b>a</b> {{critical}} {{relative humidity}} of 59.4%, above {{which it will}} absorb moisture from the atmosphere.

5000|$|Ammonia {{is used in}} its {{anhydrous}} form (i.e., gas form) and the {{nitric acid}} is concentrated. This reaction is violent owing to its highly exothermic nature. After the solution is formed, typically at about 83% concentration, the excess water is evaporated to an <b>ammonium</b> <b>nitrate</b> (<b>AN)</b> content of 95% to 99.9% concentration (AN melt), depending on grade. The AN melt is then made into [...] "prills" [...] or small beads in a spray tower, or into granules by spraying and tumbling in a rotating drum. The prills or granules may be further dried, cooled, and then coated to prevent caking. These prills or granules are the typical AN products in commerce.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to observe, quantify, and compare the amount of {{explosive}} precursors <b>ammonium</b> <b>nitrate</b> (<b>AN)</b> and potassium chlorate (KClO 3) in consecutive fingerprints on three surfaces: filter paper, polypropylene, and polyurethane. For the safety of the participants, only the explosive precursors <b>ammonium</b> <b>nitrate</b> (<b>AN)</b> and potassium chlorate (KClO 3) were used to contaminate fingers. Results indicate that while the amount of residue deposited with successive fingerprints tended to show a decrease, there was significant variability among trials. Some trials suggest that particles may occasionally be deposited in aggregates resulting in some amounts well above the expected trend. Typically, the initial print contained several hundred micrograms of AN or chlorate. The tenth print was significantly reduced but still contained tens to hundreds of nanograms. Of the three surfaces on which prints were made, the highest amounts of AN were recovered from filter paper, while higher amounts of KClO 3 were recovered from polypropylene. ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract [...] In one of {{the natural}} and green {{chemistry}} approach, effective reduction of the emitted nitrogen dioxide (NO 2) was achieved using 20 % bentonite as filler through production of <b>ammonium</b> <b>nitrate</b> (<b>AN)</b> fertilizer. Furthermore, this application serves in minimizing the production losses and make the process more eco-friendly. The final product is neutral (pH = 7. 36), {{so it can be}} used in any type of soil. The new product is identical in grain size and granular form to the usual fertilizer coated with limestone, and does not require any technological modification in the plant systems. Laboratory tests indicate that the emission of NO 2 gas during AN fertilizer manufacturing is effectively decreased with increasing of bentonite filler ratio to about quarter of its original value. Mineralogy and chemical composition of Ca-bentonite were assayed using XRD and XRF techniques. Bentonite reduces the tendency to caking of AN to about 60 % and hence, reduces the need for anti-lithification agent during fertilizer manufacturing by the same ratio due to bentonite inflexibility.

Unfortunately, the inherent signalto-noise {{of the most}} <b>Ammonium</b> <b>Nitrate</b> (<b>AN)</b> is very low, For the purpose of detecting weak NQR echo train from signal which is corrupted by RF interference (RFI) and noise, a NQR signal processing method based on multi-stage wiener filter (MSWF) is presented. MSWF, implementing the wiener filter using a nested chain of scalar wiener filters, is a reduced-rank algorithm. Compared with the standard method of solving Wiener filter, MSWF does not need matrix inversion, effectively reduces the computational complexity. In this work, we employ <b>ammonium</b> <b>nitrate</b> (<b>AN)</b> with different weight as the experimental samples; treat the echo train as reference channel in the condition of no sample, and other conditions as observed channel. Processing steps are as follows, applying MSWF to eliminate noise and RFI by utilizing the correlation between reference channel and observed channel, accumulating a certain times and then using the fast Fourier transformation to transform the signal to frequency domain, clear spectrum peak is achieved at the resonance frequency of AN. The {{results indicate that the}} method eliminates RFI and noise efficiently, obtains stable detection ability, reduces the computational complexity effectively, and makes the real-time NQR signal detection to be possible...|$|E
