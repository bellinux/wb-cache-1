Mentally healthy people don't decide to take such a drastic action based on [...] they had during a drug state. Psychedelics basically amplify <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> own internal stuff. If you're already having some kind of dark thoughts, a psychedelic experience could amplify that, and {{it could lead to}} a problem for some people." ...|$|E

However, Bow, like Charlie Chaplin, Louise Brooks, and most other silent film stars, did not embrace the novelty: [...] "I hate talkies ... they're stiff and limiting. You lose <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> cuteness, because there's no chance for action, and action is the most {{important}} thing to me." [...] A visibly nervous Bow had to do a number of retakes in The Wild Party because her eyes kept wandering up to the microphone overhead. [...] "I can't buck progress [...]. I have to do the best I can," [...] she said. In October 1929, Bow described her nerves as [...] "all shot", saying that she had reached [...] "the breaking point", and Photoplay cited reports of [...] "rows of bottles of sedatives" [...] by her bed.|$|E
