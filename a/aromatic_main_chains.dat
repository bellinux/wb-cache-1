40|$|Polymer {{matrices}} with <b>aromatic</b> <b>main</b> <b>chain</b> {{and side}} chain linked units (polystyrene, polysulfone) {{were employed to}} construct thin films containing maleimidoazobenzene molecules {{in order to develop}} new materials with responsive properties. The photochromic behavior of the active compound was studied both in the solid and solution state for comparison. The thermal cis-trans isomerization of azobenzene chromophores in polymer films follows two different kinetic pathways. A double-exponential relaxation process (fast and slow) took place in polystyrene matrix under 70 ºC while the thermal isomerization at 70 ºC and higher follows a first-order kinetics. The cis isomer content corresponding to the photostationary state was found to be lower in polymer films than in solution...|$|R
40|$|There {{is still}} a need to develop bioresorbable {{polymers}} with high strength and high modulus for load-bearing biomedical applications. Here we investigate the liquid crystalline structural features of poly(desaminotyrosyl-tyrosine dodecyl dodecanedioate), poly(DTD DD), a new bioresorbable poly(ester amide) that is currently studied in vivo as a slow-degrading implantable biomaterial for load bearing applications. Thermally induced structural changes in poly(DTD DD) were studied using simultaneously differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and X-ray scattering. The hexatic SmB organization of the polymer chains that exists at room temperature becomes progressively disordered upon heating, changing into a SmF phase and then into a smectic C phase at 60 °C before turning into a free-flowing melt at 130 °C. X-ray scattering data and thermal analysis indicate {{the presence of a}} 2 D ordered structure in the polymer melt. A structural model with an interesting 3 -fold symmetry in the packing of the side chains around the rigid <b>aromatic</b> <b>main</b> <b>chain,</b> and the packing of these chains into fibrils is proposed. The liquid crystalline behavior of poly(DTD DD) makes it possible to melt process it at low temperatures without thermal degradation. This is a noteworthy advantage for the use of poly(DTD DD) as a high strength, readily processable, yet biodegradable polymer...|$|R

40|$|Abstract <b>Main</b> <b>chain</b> torsions of alanine {{dipeptide}} are pa-rameterized into coupled 2 -dimensional Fourier expansions {{based on}} quantum mechanical (QM) calculations at M 06 2 X/aug-cc-pvtz//HF/ 6 - 31 G* * level. Solvation effect is con-sidered by employing polarizable continuum model. Utilization of the M 06 2 X functional leads to precise potential energy surface that {{is comparable to}} or even better than MP 2 level, but with much less computational demand. Parameterization of the 2 D expansions is against the full <b>main</b> <b>chain</b> torsion space instead {{of just a few}} low energy conforma-tions. This procedure is similar to that for the development of AMBER 03 force field, except unique weighting factor was assigned to all the grid points. To avoid inconsistency between quantum mechanical calculations and molecular modeling, the model peptide is further optimized at molecular mechanics level with <b>main</b> <b>chain</b> dihedral angles fixed before the calcula-tion of the conformational energy on molecular mechanical level at each grid point, during which generalized Born model is employed. Difference in solvation models at quantum me-chanics and molecular mechanics levels makes this parameter-ization procedure less straightforward. All force field parameters other than <b>main</b> <b>chain</b> torsions are taken from existing AMBER force field. With this new <b>main</b> <b>chain</b> torsion terms, we have studied the <b>main</b> <b>chain</b> dihedral distributions of ALA dipeptide and pentapeptide in aqueous solution. The re-sults demonstrate that 2 D <b>main</b> <b>chain</b> torsion is effective in delineating the energy variation associated with rotations along <b>main</b> <b>chain</b> dihedrals. This work is an implication for the necessity of more accurate description of <b>main</b> <b>chain</b> torsions in the future development of ab initio force field and it also raises a challenge to the development of quantum mechanical methods, especially the quantum mechanical solvation models...|$|R

40|$|The <b>main</b> <b>chain</b> of teichoic acids can be {{assembled}} in cell-free membrane preparations by {{the transfer of}} residues from the appropriate nucleotide precursors to an incompletely characterized amphiphilic molecule, lipoteichoic acid carrier (LTC). However, in the cell wall, the <b>main</b> <b>chain</b> is attached to peptidoglycan through a linkage unit which is synthesized independently.

Thus, in these systems, there appear to be two routes to the biosynthesis of teichoic acid-linkage unit complexes, one by direct assembly of the <b>main</b> <b>chain</b> on linkage unit lipids and the other by transfer of the preassembled <b>main</b> <b>chain</b> from LTC to the linkage unit.

40|$|This paper {{provides}} an overview on some metal containing polymers that contain heterocyclic systems and metal complexes on the <b>main</b> <b>chain.</b> Heterocycles such as 1, 3, 4 -oxadiazoles, quinoxaline, dipyridophenazine, and benzimidazole may enhance the electron carrier mobilities of the polymers, while the incorporation of ruthenium or rhenium diimine complexes to a conjugated polymer may change the photophysical properties of the resulting polymers significantly. The heterocyclic conjugated <b>main</b> <b>chain</b> can be constructed by condensation ring closure or metal catalyzed coupling reactions. Polymers that contain bidentate or tridentate ligands on the <b>main</b> <b>chain</b> were used for metal coordination. These metal containing polymers have found potential applications in organic opto-electronic devices such as light emitting diodes, optical detectors, and photovoltaic cells. Some metal containing rigid rod polymers based on non-conjugated <b>main</b> <b>chain</b> will also be presented. Metal containing polyimides, polyamides, and polyesters exhibit good thermal stability due to the rigid <b>main</b> <b>chain.</b> Some of them also exhibit thermotropic and lyotropic liquid crystal properties.
