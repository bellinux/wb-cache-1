40|$|This paper proposes {{architectural}} {{solutions that}} deal {{with two of the}} most crucial performance requirements imposed by the MPEG- 4 standard, namely high data throughput and high computational power. To obtain higher data throughput, we define a new data storage facility with a specific data organization and a new <b>addressing</b> <b>mode</b> <b>called</b> two-dimensional block <b>addressing.</b> To achieve higher computational power, we propose an instruction set extension, bene tting from this addressing mode. This is illustrated by the implementation of a new instruction called "ACcepted Quality" (ACQ). This instruction supports the identically named ACQ function, which {{is an essential part of}} the shape encoding process in MPEG- 4. We have implemented the ACQ function on a dedicated systolic structure and its FPGA realization suggests 62 ns operating latency. Utilizing this result, we have made performance evaluations with a benchmark software (MPEG- 4 shape encoder) by a cycle-accurate simulator. The simulation results indicate that the performance is increased by up to 10 %...|$|R
40|$|In this article, we {{introduce}} {{the concept of}} a dielectric nanolaser that is nanoscopic in all spatial dimensions. Our proposal is based on dielectric nanoparticles of high refractive index, e. g., silicon, acting as a (passive) cavity (without intrinsic gain) that is decorated with a thin film of organic gain media. Its resonance frequencies can be tuned over the entire visible range and bright and dark modes can be <b>addressed.</b> So <b>called</b> "magnetic" <b>modes</b> can be utilized, which makes this dielectric nanolaser a complementary source of coherent nearfields similar to the surface plasmon laser (which exploits electric modes). The small intrinsic losses in silicon yield relatively high quality factors and low non-radiative decay rates of emitters close to the cavity, both of which will lead to low thresholds. As we show in this work, the dielectric nanolaser exhibits certain advantages relative to nanowire lasers and spasers, such as reduced laser threshold, short switch-on times, size and design flexibility. The dielectric nanolaser is compatible with standard lithographic fabrication approaches and its relative simple design may allow for easy testing and realization of the concept. Thus, the silicon nanolaser might soon find many applications in nanooptics and metamaterials...|$|R
