5|$|Burial 265 {{was found}} {{at the base of}} the {{stairway}} of Terrace 1 Structure 2 in the acropolis. Ceramics associated with the burial have been dated to the Middle Preclassic Period. This burial is the only evidence yet found of such early activity at the site. It consists of the burial of a seated infant together with a newborn. The burial was laid out upon a layer of large stones and was accompanied by <b>a</b> <b>plate</b> <b>and</b> other ceramics as a funerary offering. The child's skull was found underneath the plate itself. Burnt stones and earth were found next to the burial.|$|E
5|$|The {{calutron}} {{is a type}} of sector mass spectrometer, {{an instrument}} in which a sample is ionized and then accelerated by electric fields and deflected by magnetic fields. The ions ultimately collide with <b>a</b> <b>plate</b> <b>and</b> produce a measurable electric current. Since the ions of the different isotopes have the same electric charge but different masses, the heavier isotopes are deflected less by the magnetic field, causing the beam of particles to separate out into several beams by mass, striking the plate at different locations. The mass of the ions can be calculated according to the strength of the field and the charge of the ions. During World War II, calutrons were developed to use this principle to obtain substantial quantities of high-purity uranium-235, by taking advantage of the small mass difference between uranium isotopes.|$|E

25|$|Choosing {{the right}} heat {{exchanger}} (HX) requires {{some knowledge of}} the different heat exchanger types, {{as well as the}} environment where the unit must operate. Typically in the manufacturing industry, several differing types of heat exchangers are used for just one process or system to derive the final product. For example, a kettle HX for pre-heating, a double pipe HX for the ‘carrier’ fluid and <b>a</b> <b>plate</b> <b>and</b> frame HX for final cooling. With sufficient knowledge of heat exchanger types and operating requirements, an appropriate selection can be made to optimise the process.|$|E
25|$|Poke {{is a local}} cuisine that {{originally}} involved preserving raw fish or other seafood such as octopus with sea salt and rubbing it (lomi) with seasonings or cutting it into small pieces. Seasonings made of seaweed, kukui nut, and sea salt were traditionally used for the Hawaiian poke. Since first contact with Western and Asian cultures, scallions, chili peppers, and soy sauce have become common additions to it. Poke is different from sashimi, since the former is usually rough-cut and piled onto <b>a</b> <b>plate,</b> <b>and</b> {{can be made with}} less expensive pieces of fish.|$|E

25|$|In {{her junior}} year, Krieger made 20 {{appearances}} for Penn State, ten of those appearances being in conference matches. She made seven {{goals in the}} season, which tied for second in the season at Penn State. Three of those goals were game winning goals. Penn State was the 2004 Big Ten Conference regular season champion and was No.1 seed in the Big Ten Women's Soccer Tournament. They {{made it to the}} quarterfinals of the tournament, when they were defeated by Michigan on November 3. Penn State earned the No. 1 seed in the NCAA Tournament, its highest seed ever. However, two days before the tournament, Krieger broke her leg while playing against a men's soccer team in preparation for the tournament. The injury required surgery, where they inserted <b>a</b> <b>plate</b> <b>and</b> five screws in her leg. A few months later in January, after traveling to visit her family, Krieger began experiencing shortness of breath and checked into the hospital as a precaution. As a result of her broken leg and subsequent plane rides, she had developed blood clots in her legs that traveled up to her lungs and caused a pulmonary embolism, affecting her blood flow and triggering multiple mini-heart attacks. The doctor informed her that if she had gone to sleep that night, there as a high probability that she would not have woken up. She was required to do a series of self-injections of enoxaparin for several months, but eventually made a full recovery and joined the Nittany Lions for her senior season. At the end of her shortened 2004 season, Krieger was given NSCAA All-America First Team honors, NSCAA All-Mid-Atlantic Region First Team honors, All-Big Ten First Team honors, and Academic All-Big Ten honors.|$|E

2500|$|A third type of heat {{exchanger}} is <b>a</b> <b>plate</b> <b>and</b> shell {{heat exchanger}}, which combines {{plate heat exchanger}} with shell and tube heat exchanger technologies. The heart of the heat exchanger contains a fully welded circular plate pack made by pressing and cutting round plates and welding them together. Nozzles carry flow {{in and out of}} the platepack (the 'Plate side' flowpath). The fully welded platepack is assembled into an outer shell that creates a second flowpath ( [...] the 'Shell side'). Plate and shell technology offers high heat transfer, high pressure, high operating temperature, uling and close approach temperature. In particular, it does completely without gaskets, which provides security against leakage at high pressures and temperatures.|$|E
2500|$|Editor of Mysore Gazettes Srikantaiah has listed 156 temples {{to which}} Tipu {{regularly}} paid annual grants.

Between 1782 and 1799 Tipu Sultan issued 34 [...] "Sanads" [...] (deeds) of endowment to temples in his domain, while also presenting many of them with gifts of silver and gold plate. The Srikanteswara Temple in Nanjangud still possesses a jewelled cup presented by the Sultan. He also gave a greenish linga; to Ranganatha temple at Srirangapatna he donated seven silver cups and a silver camphor burner. This temple was hardly a stone's throw from his palace from where he would listen with equal respect to the ringing of temple bells and the muezzin's call from the mosque; to the Lakshmikanta Temple at Kalale he gifted four cups, <b>a</b> <b>plate</b> <b>and</b> Spitoon in silver.|$|E
2500|$|That same month, Harrison Ford {{fractured}} his leg while filming at Pinewood after {{a hydraulic}} {{door on the}} Millennium Falcon set fell on him and {{was taken to a}} hospital. According to Abrams, Ford's ankle [...] "went to a 90-degree angle". Production was suspended for two weeks to accommodate Ford's injury. Ford's son Ben stated that the ankle would likely need <b>a</b> <b>plate</b> <b>and</b> screws and that filming could be altered slightly, with the crew needing to shoot Ford from the waist up for a short time until he recovered. A month later, Jake Steinfeld, Ford's personal trainer, said that Ford was recovering rapidly. Abrams also suffered a fractured vertebra in his back when he was trying to help lift the door after Ford's accident. However, he kept this to himself and did not tell anyone about it for over a month. In February 2016, it was reported that the Health and Safety Executive brought four criminal charges against Disney subsidiary Foodles Production (UK), Ltd. for alleged health and safety breaches relating to Ford's accident. Foodles Production (UK) Ltd was subsequently fined $1.95 million in October 2016 for two health and safety breaches, after admitting the counts at an earlier hearing.|$|E

2500|$|Ford reprised {{the role}} of Han Solo in the sequel [...] (2015). During filming on June 11, 2014, Ford {{suffered}} what {{was said to be}} a fractured ankle, when a hydraulic door fell on him. He was rushed to hospital for treatment. Ford's son Ben released details on his father's injury, saying that his ankle would likely need <b>a</b> <b>plate</b> <b>and</b> screws, and that filming could be altered slightly with the crew needing to shoot Ford from the waist up for a short time until he recovered. Ford made his return to filming in mid-August, after a two-month layoff as he recovered from his injury. Ford's character was killed off in The Force Awakens; however, it was subsequently announced, via a casting call, that Ford would return in some capacity as Han Solo in Episode VIII. In February 2016, when the cast for Episode VIII was confirmed, it was indicated that Ford would not reprise his role in the film. When Ford was asked if his character could come back in [...] "some form", he replied, [...] "Anything is possible in space." [...] A Han Solo spin-off movie is scheduled to be made, but Ford is not involved in the production.
