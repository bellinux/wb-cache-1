40|$|Micro {{assembly}} {{is typically}} characterised by positioning tolerances below a few micro meters. In {{the case of}} the assembly of hybrid micro systems, such as optical glass fibres, micro ball lenses or micro probes for measurement tasks, even positioning accuracies in the sub-micrometer range have to be achieved. In case of positioning devices with less than 6 degrees of freedom, flexibility in terms of adaptation to the orientation of the objects is required. The flexibility of existing gripping systems is often reduced by the design of the utilized end effector. In case of mechanical <b>gripping</b> <b>devices,</b> the achievable precision in the field of micro and precision assembly is strongly defined by the shape of the end effector surfaces. Introducing flexibility, combined with precision into that kind of <b>gripping</b> <b>device</b> has {{to be seen as a}} challenge, most important when talking about gripping micro products in different shapes, size and based on different materials. Using vacuum based <b>gripping</b> <b>devices,</b> an appropriate end effector surface design is required to ensure a defined orientation of the manipulated object. In order to combine precision with flexibility, the precisely defined end effector shape has to be replaced by a solution, allowing the gripping of objects like micro parts, small lenses and other small components well defined and same time being able to adapt to object size, shape and orientation. On behalf of this background the Fraunhofer IPT conducts research on a concept to realize a highly flexible, fast and cost-efficient micro assembly based on conventional assembly systems combined with a six axis fine positioning assembly head.

40|$|The {{delicate}} tuning of digit {{forces to}} object properties can be disrupted {{by a number}} of neurological and musculoskeletal diseases. One such condition is Carpal Tunnel Syndrome (CTS), a compression neuropathy of the median nerve that causes sensory and motor deficits in a subset of digits in the hand. Whereas the effects of CTS on median nerve physiology are well understood, {{the extent to which it}} affects whole-hand manipulation remains to be addressed. CTS affects only the lateral three and a half digits, which raises the question of how the central nervous system integrates sensory feedback from affected and unaffected digits to plan and execute whole-hand object manipulation. We addressed this question by asking CTS patients and healthy controls to grasp, lift, and hold a <b>grip</b> <b>device</b> (445, 545, or 745 g) for several consecutive trials. We found that CTS patients were able to successfully <b>adapt</b> <b>grip</b> force to object weight. However, multi-digit force coordination in patients was characterized by lower discrimination of force modulation to lighter object weights, higher across-trial digit force variability, the consistent use of excessively large digit forces across consecutive trials, and a lower ability to minimize net moments on the object. Importantly, the mechanical requirement of attaining equilibrium of forces and torques caused CTS patients to exert excessive forces at both CTS-affected digits and digits with intact sensorimotor capabilities. These findings suggest that CTS-induced deficits in tactile sensitivity interfere with the formation of accurate sensorimotor memories of previous manipulations. Consequently, CTS patients use compensatory strategies to maximize grasp stabilit...|$|R
