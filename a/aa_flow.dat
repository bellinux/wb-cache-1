However, conventional non-invasive (Doppler) recordings have not shown similar aging change. Aim: To illustrate changes in <b>AA</b> <b>flow</b> and carotid pressure waves in an apparently normal cohort, using cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMRI). Methods: Fifty subjects (aged 21 – 70 years; 28 males) underwent velocity-encoded CMRI of the thoracic aorta using a 1. 5 T system (Signa, GEMS, Waukesha, USA). <b>AA</b> <b>flow</b> was measured non-invasively by subtracting simultaneous forward and backward flow velocity across the AA cross-section. DR⅓ was determined as ratio of difference in flow velocity between systolic peak and one-third of deceleration phase to peak flow velocity. Comparisons were made between young (≤ 50 years; n= 30) and older subjects (> 50 years; n= 20). Results: Peak <b>AA</b> <b>flow</b> velocity decreased substantially (P 50 years) (P< 0. 001). These features are explicable {{on the basis of}} LV impairment from early and increased wave reflection during systole, and suggest reduction of wave reflection as a strategy for treating heart failure in the elderly.

Aim: To determine AA impedance from cardiac {{magnetic resonance imaging}} (CMRI) flow recorded non-invasively and carotid pressure tonometry, and compare results with previously reported invasive data and realistic arterial model (O’Rourke and Avolio, Circ Res 1980; 46; 363 – 372). Methods: Fifty apparently normal subjects (aged 21 – 70 years; 28 males) underwent velocity-encoded CMRI of the thoracic aorta using a 1. 5 T system (Signa, GEMS, Waukesha, USA). <b>AA</b> <b>flow</b> was measured non-invasively by subtracting simultaneous forward and backward flow velocity across the AA cross-section. Impedance was determined by relating in modulus and phase, corresponding frequency components of the <b>AA</b> <b>flow</b> waveforms with tonometric carotid pressure waveforms (used as surrogate of AA pressure) and recorded sequentially after CMRI. Data were presented in 5 age groups: 21 – 30, 31 – 40, 41 – 50, 51 – 60 and 61 – 70 years. Results: Values of impedance modulus and phase {{were similar to those}} previously reported for invasive studies, and with impedance modulus being higher in older than younger subjects up to 3 Hz (reflecting higher peripheral resistance in older subjects, and impedance phase crossed from negative to positive values between 3 and 4. 5 Hz. Characteristic impedance (taken as average modulus 5 – 6 Hz) was 710 dyne. s. cm⁻³. Values of AA impedance fall within the range calculated for a realistic model of the arterial system between age 20 and 80 years. Conclusion: AA impedance values calculated non-invasively from AA CMRI flow waveforms and carotid pressure waveforms show the same pattern as seen with invasive studies in older and younger subjects and lie within the same range as predicted form models at age 20 to 80 years.

40|$|Lava flows can be {{considered}} as hot viscous cores within thinner, solidified crusts. Interaction between crust and core determines a flow's morphological and dynamical evolution. When the lava core dominates, flow advance approaches a steady state. When crusts are the limiting factor, advance is more irregular.

Aa and budding pahoehoe lavas are used as examples of core- and crustal-dominated flows, respectively. A simple model describes the transition between pahoehoe and <b>aa</b> <b>flow</b> in terms of lava discharge rate, underlying slope, and either the thickness or velocity of the flow front.

40|$|Barren Island (India) is a {{relatively}} little studied, little known active volcano in the Andaman Sea, and the northernmost active volcano of the great Indonesian arc. The volcano is built of prehistoric (possibly late Pleistocene) lava flows (dominantly basalt and basaltic andesite, with minor andesite) intercalated with volcaniclastic deposits (tuff breccias, and ash beds deposited by pyroclastic falls and surges), which are exposed along a roughly circular caldera wall. There are indications of a complete phreatomagmatic tephra ring around the exposed base of the volcano. A polygenetic cinder cone has existed at {{the centre of the}} caldera and produced basalt-basaltic andesite aa and blocky aa lava flows, as well as tephra, during historic eruptions (1787 - 1832) and three recent eruptions (1991, 1994 - 95, 2005 - 06). The recent aa flows include a toothpaste <b>aa</b> <b>flow,</b> with tilted and overturned crustal slabs carried atop an aa core, as well as locally developed tumuli-like elliptical uplifts having corrugated crusts. Based on various evidence we infer that it belongs to either the 1991 or the 1994 - 95 eruptions. The volcano has recently (2008) begun yet another eruption, so far only of tephra. We make significantly different interpretations of several features of the volcano than previous workers.

The first experiment was designed to study the dietary N excretion pattern at the ileum subsequent to the ingestion of a single 15 N-labeled meal. In a second experiment, we compared ileal endogenous AA outputs and true AA digestibility estimates obtained in pigs ingesting 15 N-labeled dietary proteins in a single meal vs. intravenous infusion of [15 N]Ieucine for 10 d during the ingestion of a pea-based diet and a protein-free starch diet. The proportion of endogenous N found in the ileal digesta differed when the label was delivered orally (50 %) vs. intravenously (72 %) and changed with time. As a consequence, the true ileal AA digestibilities measured with labeled diets were lower. A third experiment demonstrated that this was due to the rapid recycling of labeled dietary N in endogenous moieties, because 15 N was found in blood within 10 min of consuming the labeled meal, within 50 min of consumption in pancreatic enzymes, 90 min in bile and 4 h in ileal mucins. We conclude that the use of 15 N-labeled meals for determination of true ileal AA digestibilities is limited by the fast recycling of dietary N in endogenous secretions following a single 15 N-labeled meal. The accuracy of results will depend on meaningful estimates of <b>AA</b> <b>flow</b> during a limited period and accurate estimates of 15 N in AA...|$|E

Endogenous AA flows determined with the use of protein-free diet were considerably lower (P 0. 05), except for the flow of arginine, which was lower (P < 0. 05) in the EHC method. Glutamic acid, aspartic acid, threonine and glycine were the predominant endogenous AA present in digesta from the distal ileum. The contents of methionine, histidine and cystine were lower compared with other AA. The method of determination had no effect on the AA composition of endogenous protein, except for threonine, glutamic acid, lysine, arginine and cystine. The concentrations of threonine and arginine were lower (P < 0. 05) and that of lysine was higher (P < 0. 05) with the EHC method compared with the other two methods. The concentration of glutamic acid was greater (P < 0. 05) and that of cystine was lower (P < 0. 05) in the EHC and GuC methods compared with the protein-free diet method. The results showed that the ileal endogenous flows of N and AA are markedly enhanced by the presence of protein and peptides, above those determined following feeding of a protein-free diet.

40|$|The {{lactating}} {{dairy cow}} is fairly inefficient at converting dietary nitrogen to milk protein. When cows are fed to National Research Council (NRC, 2001) requirements, they convert approximately 25 % of dietary nitrogen to milk protein. There {{may be some}} inherent limitations to the efficiency {{that can be achieved}} by a ruminant; however, examination of the NRC model with respect to available data suggest several areas where requirement or supply predictions could be improved. Ruminally degradable protein (RDP) requirements appear to be too high. Reducing these requirements would allow reductions in dietary protein and improved animal efficiency. Amino acid (<b>AA)</b> <b>flow</b> to the small intestine appears to be predicted with good accuracy provided diets are within current NRC requirements for RDP. Absorption of AA from the gut lumen is not constant across AA within an ingredient or across ingredients as assumed by NRC. Thus, absorbed AA may be predicted with bias. The gut tissues as represented in the portal-drained viscera and the liver remove approximately 2 / 3 of the available AA on a daily basis, and this removal is dependent on supply. Variable use by these maintenance tissues violates the NRC assumption of fixed maintenance use and introduces a significant bias in our current predictions. Mammary AA removal is highly regulated and counters supply, i. e. as supply declines, transport activity increases and vice versa. Variable transport activity with respect to AA supply violates the NRC assumption of fixed conversion efficiencies for absorbed AA and introduces bias into predictions. Thus, our ability to successfully balance diets for adequate AA while minimizing dietary nitrogen inputs is currently hampered by a lack of data with respect to AA digestibility in the small intestine and poor representations of postabsorptive use of AA. Amino acid digestibility coefficients for individual ingredients are needed to address the first challenge and an alternate representation of postabsorptive use and recycling of AA is required to address the second challenge...|$|E

40|$|AbstractIn this review, the {{definition}} and terminology of amino acid (AA) digestibility and ileal endogenous losses of AA (IAAend) in poultry and swine nutrition are discussed. Compared with apparent (AID) and true (TID) ileal digestibility, standardised ileal digestibility (SID) of AA {{is recommended for}} the expression of digestible AA contents of feed ingredients and for describing nutritional requirements of poultry and swine. To determine the SID of AA, total ileal flow of AA should be corrected for basal IAAend. Therefore, the measurement of basal IAAend is of great importance for the accuracy of the SID estimation in feed ingredients. The techniques for measuring basal IAAend in poultry and swine include the use of a nitrogen-free diet (NFD), a highly digestible or enzyme hydrolyzed protein diet, and the regression method. The classic method for basal IAAend determination involves the feeding of a NFD to experimental animals and measuring the ileal <b>AA</b> <b>flow.</b> This IAAend output is considered as basal IAAend, and it is assumed that the excretion of basal IAAend depends only on DM intake, regardless of dietary composition. There are criticisms with the NFD method about the abnormal physiological state induced by severe AA deficiency. Although this AA deficiency may affect the estimate of basal IAAend for dispensable AA, especially proline and glycine because of the degradation of body protein, the NFD method is still the most widely used method for basal IAAend measurements. According to {{the definition}} of basal IAAend, the NFD should be the preferred methodology in SID determination, because the basal IAAend should be only related to dry matter intake. Additionally, the SID coefficients in feed ingredients generated by NFD method are considered to be additive in a complete diet. However, the results generated from NFD method can vary among studies due to the variance in the experimental animals and diet composition. To improve the accuracy of estimating the SID of AA in feed ingredients, it is suggested that a mandatory NFD be included in individual studies to generate basal IAAend for correcting total ileal amino acid flow in determining SID of AA. In addition, research is needed to investigate the standard diet formulation of NFD...|$|E
40|$|Two {{trials were}} {{conducted}} {{to determine the effects}} of rumen degradable protein (RDP) level and source on the duodenal essential amino acid (AA) composition of Dohne Merino wethers. The animals had ad libitum access to wheat straw (32 g crude protein (CP) /kg DM; 742 g neutral detergent fibre (NDF) /kg DM) and water. In the first experimental treatments casein provided 0, 40, 80, 120 and 160 g supplemental RDP/d. In experiment two, urea-nitrogen replaced 0, 25, 50, 75 and 100 % of the true protein in the isonitrogenous treatments. Expressing essential AA concentration as a percentage of duodenal protein indicated that increasing RDP levels tended to decrease arginine, but significantly increased tryptophan concentrations. Histidine, isoleucine, leucine, lysine, methionine, phenylalanine, threonine, valine and total essential AA concentrations were not affected by dietary RDP level. Increasing the urea-N content of RDP supplements significantly decreased isoleucine, leucine, lysine, phenylalanine, tryptophan, valine and total essential amino acid (TEAA) concentrations. Histidine and threonine proportions also tended to decrease with higher non-protein N levels. When the essential AA profile is expressed in relation to lysine, the concentrations of histidine, leucine, phenylalanine and threonine decreased significantly. Arginine and valine showed a decreasing trend and tryptophan increased significantly as RDP levels were raised. The largest differences appeared between 0 and 40 g RDP supplementation, while the AA patterns for the rest of the treatments remained relatively constant. Substituting urea for true RDP induced a variable response in arginine and isoleucine, but did not affect any of the other AA's. Increasing RDP intakes significantly increased the duodenal flow of every essential AA, except arginine, and showed a strong tendency to increase TEAA flow as well. Replacing true RDP with urea significantly reduced the flow of methionine and tryptophan and also tended to decrease lysine availability in the duodenum. Individual AA and TEAA flow to the duodenum were also numerically decreased by a minimum of 34 % as urea-N was increased. It appears that the qualitative duodenal essential AA profile in sheep fed low quality forages is relatively insensitive to RDP level or source.
