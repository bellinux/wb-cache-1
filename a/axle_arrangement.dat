25|$|Based {{partly on}} {{contemporary}} British railway practice, {{the experience of}} Sir Charles Fox and Sons on the Queensland Railways, and Carl Abraham Pihl's work in Norway, the early rolling stock was intended to consist of short four-wheel boxcars, and longer six-wheel flat and passenger cars using Clark's radial <b>axle</b> <b>arrangement.</b> The four-wheel boxcars were reliable and suited the traffic at first, but became {{too small for the}} increasing traffic, and were not added to after 1874. Many became wayside grounded tool vans after gauge standardisation. The first longer flatcars were built using imported sets of Clark's radial gear and put into service with the construction contractors. The intention was that they would go more easily around tight curves. Whether through bad design, poor assembly, or abuse and heavy uneven loading by the construction gangs, the six-wheel cars proved disastrously prone to derailment and were soon put aside in favour of cars re-equipped with two standard North American four-wheel trucks (bogies). The passenger cars were never used in six-wheel form due to safety concerns.|$|E
2500|$|The {{production}} car changed little from the prototype, although the full-width rear bumper was dropped {{in favour of}} two part-bumpers curving round each corner, with overriders. Mechanicals were basically stock Herald with the notable addition of front disc brakes. The engine was an [...] four-cylinder with a pushrod OHV cylinder head and two valves per cylinder, mildly tuned for the Spitfire, fed by twin SU carburettors. Also from the Herald came the {{rack and pinion steering}} and coil-and-wishbone front suspension, and at the rear a single transverse-leaf swing <b>axle</b> <b>arrangement.</b> This ended up being the most controversial part of the car: it was known to [...] "tuck in" [...] and cause violent over steer if pushed too hard, even in the staid Herald. In the sportier Spitfire (and later the six-cylinder Triumph GT6 and Triumph Vitesse) it led to severe criticism. Known fixes for this include things like camber compensators (essentially a single leaf spring suspended beneath the vertical links), or simply achieving more negative camber to the rear wheels can help the handling become more manageable. The body was bolted to a much-modified Herald chassis, the outer rails and the rear outriggers having been removed; little of the original Herald chassis design was left, and the Spitfire used structural outer sills to stiffen its body tub.|$|E

50|$|The UIC has {{established}} {{systems for the}} classification of locomotives and their <b>axle</b> <b>arrangements,</b> coaches and goods wagons.|$|R
2500|$|Unlike the Whyte {{notation}} and AAR system, both {{of which}} are used to classify wheel arrangements, and the UIC classification of locomotive <b>axle</b> <b>arrangements,</b> the Swiss system, in both its original and updated forms, takes into account a number of other variables, including track gauge, motive power type, and maximum speed. [...] The Swiss system is also less precise than those other systems in the way it deals with axles, because it refers only to numbers, rather than to <b>arrangements,</b> of powered <b>axles,</b> and axles as a whole. [...] The Swiss system is therefore more a method of classifying locomotive and railcar types and series than a method of classifying wheel or <b>axle</b> <b>arrangements.</b>|$|R
50|$|The main {{notation}}s are the Whyte notation (based on {{counting the}} wheels), the AAR wheel arrangement notation (based on counting either the axles or the bogies), and the UIC classification of locomotive <b>axle</b> <b>arrangements</b> (based on counting either the axles or the bogies).|$|R
50|$|Independent front {{suspension}} {{represented an}} advance over the rigid front <b>axle</b> <b>arrangement</b> of the predecessor model.|$|E
50|$|The {{diesel engines}} built from 1951 to 1965 were given their own numbers {{starting}} from 10001 and 20001. These locomotives were supplied to the Saar Railway amongst others, that later {{ended up in}} the Deutsche Bundesbahn. In the 10,000 range, mainly engines with a B-dh <b>axle</b> <b>arrangement,</b> the works number 10199 was reached. Of the 20,000 series, with a C-dh <b>axle</b> <b>arrangement,</b> only 23 engines were made.|$|E
50|$|NWE Nos. 6 and 7, later Class 99.610, are {{narrow gauge}} tank {{locomotives}} with a C <b>axle</b> <b>arrangement</b> {{that belonged to}} the Nordhausen-Wernigerode Railway.|$|E
50|$|Passenger {{locomotives}} (type Bo′Bo′ {{according to}} UIC classification of locomotive <b>axle</b> <b>arrangements)</b> shall provide a {{continuous tractive effort}} of more than 240 kN, freight locomotives (Co′Co′) more than 480 kN and all weather adhesion shall be at least 33%.Passenger locomotives shall be equipped to provide head end power (HEP) to the train.|$|R
50|$|Under the British and Imperial {{classification}} scheme of locomotive <b>axle</b> <b>arrangements,</b> which {{is related to}} the UIC classification, 1Co+Co1 is a classification code for a locomotive wheel arrangement of two eight-wheeled bogies with an articulated inter-bogie connection, each with three axles powered by a separate traction motor per axle and with the fourth non-powered axle in an integral leading pony truck to reduce the axle load. The similar 1Co-Co1 classification is in the same axle configuration, but without the inter-bogie connection.|$|R
40|$|Canada (FERIC) {{undertook}} {{a series of}} studies to investigate the potential of using a combination of technologies to extend log hauling operations during the traditional spring break-up period. During spring break-up, thin pavement roads are weakened, resulting in the application of government-imposed load restrictions to prevent road damage from heavy haul traffic. These load restrictions typically result in the suspension of log hauling operations for a period of six to ten weeks. The undertaken studies examined the use of Central Tire Inflation (CTI) systems in combination with a variety of <b>axle</b> <b>arrangements</b> on log trucks to minimize road damage while hauling full loads during the traditional load restriction period...|$|R
50|$|The company {{procured}} a {{total of}} eight locomotives from various manufacturers that were all fired with wood. All had interior cylinders and a 1A1 <b>axle</b> <b>arrangement.</b>|$|E
50|$|SS7E use {{lightweight}} design, however its <b>axle</b> <b>arrangement</b> is Co'Co '. Each axis {{axle load}} 21 tons, and support head-end power. Its maximum speed is 170 km/h.|$|E
50|$|The W24’s {{structural}} basis was a {{box frame}} chassis. At the back it employed a swing <b>axle</b> <b>arrangement</b> copied {{from the popular}} small cars produced by sister brand DKW of Auto Union.|$|E
5000|$|Back-halved - a bodied drag {{racing car}} {{that has had}} its stock rear {{suspension}} removed and replaced with a four-link or ladder bar rear suspension, and narrowed rear <b>axle.</b> This <b>arrangement</b> allows for larger tires and better adjustability.|$|R
5000|$|... "1B-1B" [...] {{means there}} are two trucks with a leading idler axle in front of two powered <b>axles.</b> This <b>{{arrangement}}</b> was used to upgrade the B-B arrangement of two EMC 1800 hp B-B locomotives owned by the Santa Fe Railroad in 1938, for greater stability at speed.|$|R
50|$|The {{valve gear}} {{is of the}} Heusinger type, with {{internal}} link motion driven by flycrank on the left wheel of the rear coupled <b>axle.</b> This <b>arrangement</b> proved itself very reliable in contrast to maintenance problems with the Gresley conjugated valve gear and was used for all subsequent Czechoslovak three-cylinder locomotives except of one series (Class 486.1).|$|R
50|$|The Saxon Class I (Sächsische I) was a {{class of}} steam {{locomotive}} operated by the Royal Saxon State Railways with a 1B <b>axle</b> <b>arrangement.</b> The engines were supplied by various manufacturers for mixed duties.|$|E
50|$|The railbuses had a B'2' <b>axle</b> <b>arrangement,</b> thus two of {{the four}} axles were driven. The engine was {{technically}} very {{similar to that of the}} four-wheeled Lokalbahn (branch line) locomotives of Bavarian Class ML 2/2.|$|E
50|$|The overall {{arrangement}} of SS6 {{is similar to}} SS3. The main circuit of SS6 {{is influenced by the}} 6K, an electric locomotive model imported from Japan. The power supply was industrial-frequency single-phase AC, and the <b>axle</b> <b>arrangement</b> Co-Co.|$|E
50|$|The {{locomotive}} was {{the only}} unit to be built of a planned series of standard superheated steam locomotives with the <b>axle</b> <b>arrangements</b> 1'C1', 1'D1' and 1'E1', that the Nordhausen-Wernigerode Railway Company (NWE), the Gernrode-Harzgerode Railway Company and the South Harz Railway Company had ordered from Friedrich Krupp AG for replacing their older, less economic saturated steam engines. In standardising their designs, it was envisaged that as {{many parts of the}} locomotives as possible would be used across the whole range in the interests of economic production, simplified spare part stock holdings and easier maintenance and servicing. But because the development order was not given by the Deutsche Reichsbahn and because different construction conventions were followed in some cases, these were not seen as Einheitsloks, the standard locomotives produced by the DR between the wars. As a result of the outbreak of World War II, however, ony the prototyped of the 1'C1' version was built in 1939 by Krupp; orders for the other engines were cancelled.|$|R
50|$|A {{difficulty}} with coupling rod drive from a jackshaft {{is the need}} to allow for vertical suspension movement of the <b>axles.</b> Several mechanical <b>arrangements</b> have been used to allow this.|$|R
50|$|All {{of these}} railcars {{had a single}} powered <b>axle</b> (1A-A1 wheel <b>arrangement).</b> Those built in 1930 used a 12V generator, but all {{subsequent}} ones used 24V, after Sentetsu opted to standardise with the L3-type 24V, 900W axle-mounted generator.|$|R
50|$|Electric {{locomotive}} EP1 is a Russian {{electric locomotive}} {{which has been}} produced by Novocherkassk Electric Locomotive Plant since 1998. It is the first Russian passenger electric locomotive with the 2o-2o-2o or Bo-Bo-Bo <b>axle</b> <b>arrangement.</b> There are, as December 2016, 866 of these locomotives.|$|E
50|$|The Shaoshan 4 (Chinese: 韶山4) {{is a type}} of {{electric}} locomotive used on the People's Republic of China's national railway system. This locomotive was built by the Zhuzhou Electric Locomotive Works. The power supply was industrial-frequency single-phase AC, and the <b>axle</b> <b>arrangement</b> Bo-Bo+Bo-Bo.|$|E
50|$|Bogies {{for the new}} {{locomotives}} were of Bo-Bo-Bo wheel arrangement. This {{differed from}} the diesel-electrics of the day which had Co-Co wheel arrangement. This three bogie, two <b>axle,</b> <b>arrangement</b> gave better weight distribution of the much heavier locomotives as well as better tractive effort and wheel flange wear.|$|E
2500|$|... "1B-1B" [...] {{means there}} are two trucks with a leading idler axle in front of two powered <b>axles.</b> [...] This <b>{{arrangement}}</b> was used to upgrade the B-B arrangement of two EMC 1800 hp B-B locomotives owned by the Santa Fe Railroad in 1938, for greater stability at speed.|$|R
50|$|Because, today, {{locomotives}} {{no longer}} {{tend to have}} separate driving and carrying <b>axles</b> (see wheel <b>arrangement),</b> as was formerly common with steam locomotives, but usually have bogies where all axles are driven, the term running gear is (inaccurately) superseding the term 'driving gear' {{in some parts of}} the world.|$|R
50|$|In some buses the {{rearmost}} axle {{is connected}} to the steering, with the rear most set steering in the opposite direction to the front <b>axle.</b> This steering <b>arrangement</b> makes it possible for the longer triple axle buses to negotiate corners with greater ease than would otherwise be the case.|$|R
50|$|The Shaoshan 3 (Chinese: 韶山三) {{is a type}} of {{electric}} locomotive used on the People's Republic of China's national railway system. This locomotive was the third Chinese electric main line locomotive, built by the Zhuzhou Electric Locomotive Works. The power supply was industrial-frequency single-phase AC, and the <b>axle</b> <b>arrangement</b> Co-Co.|$|E
50|$|The engines had an {{external}} frame with outside drive and valve gear. They had the smallest wheel diameter (1,828 mm) of any locomotive {{of this type}} {{in the whole of}} Germany. Between 1869 and 1871 all the engines were rebuillt in Regensburg and were given a 1 B <b>axle</b> <b>arrangement.</b> They were then given locomotive numbers 1081-1092.|$|E
5000|$|In the Polish State Railways (Polskie Koleje Państwowe or PKP) {{locomotive}} classification system, locomotives with a 2C1 (4-6-2 [...] ) <b>axle</b> <b>arrangement</b> {{were identified}} with the letter [...] "m" [...] in the class prefix. Express locomotives therefore had a [...] "Pm" [...] prefix, passenger locomotives an [...] "Om" [...] prefix and tank passenger locomotives an [...] "OKm" [...] prefix.|$|E
50|$|In the Whyte notation, a 6-2-0 is a {{railroad}} steam locomotive {{that has an}} unpowered three-axle leading truck followed by a single powered driving <b>axle.</b> This wheel <b>arrangement</b> {{is associated with the}} Crampton locomotive type, and in the USA the single class were sometimes referred to as Cramptons.|$|R
50|$|The F-Alpha is an {{automobile}} platform from Nissan Motor Company {{which is used}} in their trucks and SUV's. The latest version of the platform {{is the basis for}} the Nissan Frontier and Titan pickup trucks as well as the Nissan Xterra, Pathfinder (2005-2012), Armada and Infiniti QX56 (2004-2010) SUVs, and Nissan NV series van. A modified version of this platform is also used for the Suzuki Equator. This platform can be configured with an independent suspension or solid <b>axle</b> suspension <b>arrangement</b> as well as larger engines, some with variable valve timing.|$|R
2500|$|For {{locomotives}} where a high {{starting torque}} and low speed were required, the conventional direct drive approach was inadequate. [...] "Geared" [...] steam locomotives, {{such as the}} Shay, the Climax and the Heisler, were developed to meet this need on industrial, logging, mine and quarry railways. The common feature of these three types was the provision of reduction gearing and a drive shaft between the crankshaft and the driving <b>axles.</b> This <b>arrangement</b> allowed the engine to run {{at a much higher}} speed than the driving wheels compared to the conventional design, where the ratio is 1:1.|$|R
