5|$|At {{the head}} of the {{principal}} staircase an Anteroom divides the former Great Chamber from what would have been the main bedroom. During the 19th century, this room was furnished as an armoury. The adjoining bedroom, the Garden Chamber, was used as <b>a</b> <b>bedroom</b> by Lord Curzon during the early 20th century, and as such was equipped with a plumbed bath hidden in a wardrobe, one of the few in the house.|$|E
5|$|On February 11, 2015, Brosnan's $18 million Malibu mansion caught fire, {{sustaining}} $1 {{million in}} damages.

5|$|On {{the first}} floor is the upper hall and the captain's chamber, used in the 16th century as a living and working space by the castle's commander, and {{converted}} into a dining room and <b>a</b> <b>bedroom</b> in the 19th century. On the opposite side to the captain's private chamber are two other bedrooms, possibly originally {{for the use of}} the castle's lieutenant.|$|E
5|$|According to Kate, Farrar {{had moved}} out of the family home and spurned Green's desire for an amicable separation. Kate {{stressed}} that she loved and respected her mother and that all of the children had had good relationships with her, but that she was angry at her father for upsetting her mother by leaving. Pressed, she acknowledged that her mother had begun to drink large quantities of alcohol. She denied that she had ever seen matches in the house and expressed surprise that Tim had not escaped by the same route she had, which was via <b>a</b> <b>bedroom</b> window onto the roof.|$|E
5|$|After {{returning}} from South Africa in 1950, Harvey {{was offered a}} job in captain Lindsay Hassett's sports store. Harvey accepted immediately because sports stores gave more flexible arrangements for leave to play cricket. Harvey was sponsored by Stuart Surridge to use their cricket equipment. He was paid Â£300 a year, but nevertheless lived at home and shared <b>a</b> <b>bedroom</b> with his brothers Brian and Ray until he married, due to poverty. He used the same cricket uniforms {{for more than five}} years.|$|E
50|$|Residents {{can choose}} to live in <b>a</b> private <b>bedroom</b> within <b>an</b> 8-person suite, <b>a</b> double <b>bedroom</b> within <b>an</b> 8-person suite or <b>a</b> double <b>bedroom</b> within <b>a</b> 4-person suite. <b>Bedrooms</b> come {{equipped}} with a standard twin size bed, desk and chair, cable box, and wardrobe. All bedrooms have windows and blinds and a private lock.|$|R
50|$|The private rooms {{comprise}} <b>a</b> master <b>bedroom</b> {{and second}} bedroom opening off the central hall, and a side passage leading west {{from the central}} hallway to the dressing room, bathroom, and another <b>bedroom.</b> <b>A</b> small <b>bedroom</b> at {{the northwest corner of}} the house is accessed from the now enclosed rear verandah. There is another room, possibly <b>a</b> former <b>bedroom,</b> which also opens off the back verandah, but has been modified substantially.|$|R
5000|$|The {{rectangular}} {{rooms on}} the second floor were probably <b>a</b> master <b>bedroom,</b> <b>a</b> boys' <b>bedroom,</b> <b>a</b> girls' <b>bedroom,</b> and <b>a</b> servant's or guest's bedroom. Their use today is essentially the same, with the exceptions that a few closets have been added, and that one of the children's <b>bedrooms</b> now contains <b>a</b> full bath. The open, triangular area above the front entryway features an original, wrap-around balcony. The opposite triangular room, which is now a full-bath, is located over the former, rear entryway. Therefore, the room may have once contained the upper terminus of the other spiral stairway.|$|R
5|$|As <b>a</b> <b>bedroom</b> community, the {{majority}} of Coquitlam residents commute to work in Vancouver, Burnaby, and other Metro Vancouver suburbs. Coquitlam's main industrial area lies in the southern Maillardville/Fraser Mills area near the Fraser River. Among the largest employers within Coquitlam are the City of Coquitlam with approximately 850 employees, Art in Motion with approximately 750 employees, and Hard Rock Casino with approximately 600 employees. Other major employers include Coca-Cola, Sony, and the Marine Propulsion division of Rolls-Royce.|$|E
5|$|At 5:17pm on 30 January 1948, Gandhi {{was with}} his grandnieces {{in the garden of}} the former Birla House (now Gandhi Smriti), on his way to address a prayer meeting, when Nathuram Godse fired three bullets from a Beretta 9mm pistol into his chest at point-blank range. According to some accounts, Gandhi died on the spot. In other accounts, such as one {{prepared}} by an eyewitness journalist, Gandhi was carried into the Birla House, into <b>a</b> <b>bedroom.</b> There he died about 30 minutes later as one of Gandhi's family members read verses from Hindu scriptures.|$|E
5|$|Before urban development, {{the damage}} caused by {{overgrazing}} during the Spanish period was still considered capable of recovery. However, the completion of Interstate 5 through the middle of the San Juan Creek watershed in the 1950s transformed the area into <b>a</b> <b>bedroom</b> community for Los Angeles and permanently erased many remaining grassland, meadow and riparian zones. The percent of urbanized land increased from 3percent in 1964 to 18percent in 1988. In the 1990s, the watershed was 32 percent urbanized. With continuing development in east San Juan Capistrano and Rancho Mission Viejo, the projected growth by 2050 is 50 percent.|$|E
50|$|<b>A</b> Two <b>Bedroom</b> Villa is {{the same}} as <b>a</b> One <b>Bedroom,</b> plus <b>an</b> {{additional}} <b>bedroom</b> off the living room, which is almost 100% comparable to a Studio. The only exception is that in some of the Two Bedroom Villas there is an additional walk-in closet in place of the studio entrance door and an additional sink in place of the kitchenette.|$|R
40|$|Housing costs {{comprise}} {{a major part}} of most household budgets. Larger households require greater space than do smaller households but do not necessarily have larger incomes. The cost of extra housing space (e. g. the cost of <b>an</b> extra <b>bedroom)</b> may vary across different locations, both absolutely (dollars per week) and proportionately (percentage of overall costs). If this is the case, differential regional costs of additional space may provide an incentive for different sized households to locate in particular areas where housing costs most appropriately fit their needs. Our analysis uses tenancy bond rental data to analyse the cost of renting <b>an</b> extra <b>bedroom</b> in different locations throughout New Zealand. It discusses the theory of what determines rents. We then examine the nature of regional rental costs, testing whether the documented patterns fit with theoretical predictions. Finally, we reflect on what the results may imply for social outcomes and housing policy in New Zealand. To give a flavour of the issues, consider the following. In 2003, the average weekly rental cost of <b>a</b> two <b>bedroom</b> dwelling in Auckland was $ 37 more than for <b>a</b> one <b>bedroom</b> dwelling. The cost of <b>a</b> third <b>bedroom</b> was <b>an</b> extra $ 50 and the cost of <b>a</b> fourth <b>bedroom</b> was <b>an</b> additional $ 90. Thus weekly rental cost for <b>a</b> four <b>bedroom</b> dwelling exceeded that of <b>a</b> one <b>bedroom</b> dwelling by $ 177. In Manawatu-Wanganui, the cost of <b>a</b> two <b>bedroom</b> dwelling was $ 38 more than for <b>a</b> one <b>bedroom</b> dwelling - almost identical to the margin in Auckland. But the cost of additional bedrooms was much lower than in Auckland: $ 29 for <b>a</b> third <b>bedroom</b> and $ 33 for <b>a</b> fourth <b>bedroom.</b> This raw data might suggest that it would be beneficial for larger households to locate in Manawatu-Wanganui and for smaller households to locate in Auckland. However, the interaction with other factors has {{to be taken into account}} before such a conclusion can be reached. At the minimum, the data suggests there is a material issue to be addressed relating to disparities in regional housing costs for different sized households.

5|$|Beginning in 1747, Fownes Luttrell made {{numerous}} and significant alterations to Dunster Castle, redecorating and redesigning {{it in the}} Rococo style. He renovated the Great Parlour, converted <b>a</b> <b>bedroom</b> over it into a Drawing Room in 1758, created a Breakfast Room over the Hall in 1772, remodelled {{the southern part of}} the castle, and altered the Great Staircase in 1773. His changes to the dÃ©cor of the castle are also noteworthy, particularly for his use of newly-fashionable wallpaper.|$|E
5|$|Bowman {{finds himself}} in <b>a</b> <b>bedroom</b> {{appointed}} in the neoclassical style. He sees, and then becomes, older versions of himself, first standing in the bedroom, middle-aged and still in his spacesuit, then dressed in leisure attire and eating dinner, and finally as an old man lying in the bed. A monolith appears {{at the foot of}} the bed, and as Bowman reaches for it, he is transformed into a fetus enclosed in a transparent orb of light. The new being floats in space beside the Earth, gazing at it.|$|E
5|$|Employment {{possibilities}} within El Hatillo â <b>a</b> <b>bedroom</b> {{community of}} Caracas â are reduced; {{businesses in the}} municipality are almost strictly commercial, and the economy has not expanded in other directions. Office space underdevelopment has resulted {{from a lack of}} land for large scale office construction, making it costly to locate large offices or businesses in the area. Those seeking employment in offices or larger businesses must look outside of El Hatillo, contributing to the high traffic to, from, and in El Hatillo.|$|E
50|$|The {{site is a}} prime location. It has {{direct access}} to Brockwell Park and good {{communications}} with Gatwick airport and St Pancras International. In such a location a developer could plan on selling <b>a</b> two <b>bedroom</b> apartment for between half and {{three quarters of a}} million pounds. In a similar scheme in at the Heygate Estate, Elephant and Castle, <b>a</b> one <b>bedroom</b> apartment sells for Â£569,000, and <b>a</b> two <b>bedroom</b> apartment for Â£801,000.|$|R
50|$|The {{property}} has {{an average}} stocking rate of approximately 6,500 head of cattle. It {{is equipped with}} <b>a</b> three <b>bedroom</b> homestead, <b>a</b> four <b>bedroom</b> staff house, workers quarters, workshop, sheds, cattle yards and is divided into 14 paddocks.|$|R
50|$|Since {{work was}} completed, {{the main body}} of the castle has been {{converted}} into <b>a</b> nine <b>bedroom</b> hotel. The old Gate Lodge at the entrance to the property has also been converted into <b>a</b> two <b>bedroom</b> standalone holiday cottage.|$|R
5|$|Fred Keenor {{was born}} in Cardiff, Wales, as one of eleven children. He {{was raised in the}} family home, a terraced house in Theodora Street in Roath, a suburb in Cardiff, by his father Robert Keenor and his mother Mary. His father worked as a stonemason in the city, working long hours {{in order to be able}} to afford the {{employment}} of Elizabeth Maler, a live-in nanny, to help his wife care for their children. Although they were not regarded as being in poverty, the family lived in cramped conditions, Keenor sharing <b>a</b> <b>bedroom</b> with three of his brothers in a house which did not have an inside toilet.|$|E
5|$|Later {{extensions}} {{were installed}} to both 10 Downing Street and the specially constructed Transatlantic Telephone Room within the Cabinet War Rooms. Churchill's office-bedroom included BBC broadcasting equipment; Churchill made four wartime broadcasts from the Cabinet War Rooms. Although the office room was also fitted out as <b>a</b> <b>bedroom,</b> Churchill rarely slept underground, preferring {{to sleep at}} 10 Downing Street or the No.10 Annexe, a flat in the New Public Offices directly above the Cabinet War Rooms. His daughter Mary Soames often slept in the bedroom allocated to Mrs Churchill.|$|E
5|$|The Demi-Virgin is a three-act play {{written by}} Avery Hopwood. Producer Albert H. Woods staged it on Broadway, {{where it was}} a hit during the 1921â22 season. The play is <b>a</b> <b>bedroom</b> farce about former couple Gloria Graham and Wally Deane, both movie actors, whose {{marriage}} was so brief that the press speculated about whether Gloria was still a virgin. She attempts to seduce Wally when {{they are forced to}} reunite for a movie, but after playing along he surprises her by revealing that their divorce is not valid.|$|E

5|$|The {{first of}} Ravel's two operas, the one-act comedy L'heure espagnole was premiered in 1911. The {{work had been}} {{completed}} in 1907, but {{the manager of the}} OpÃ©ra-Comique, Albert CarrÃ©, repeatedly deferred its presentation. He was concerned that its plot â <b>a</b> <b>bedroom</b> farce â would be badly received by the ultra-respectable mothers and daughters who were {{an important part of the}} OpÃ©ra-Comique's audience. The piece was only modestly successful at its first production, and it was not until the 1920s that it became popular.|$|E
5|$|The front entry {{leads into}} the living room where {{polished}} wood is found throughout as well as 19th century furnishings. The front room is part of the original building which consisted of one room. The room acted as the Deere's kitchen, living room, bedrooms, essentially everything. Deere eventually added onto the house, including <b>a</b> <b>bedroom</b> and an upstairs loft. The first floor bedroom would have been used for John and his wife, and possibly a couple of the children while the upstairs room would was used {{for the rest of the}} children. The Deeres left the home in 1847 when they moved to Moline, Illinois.|$|E
5|$|The grandest apartment, which {{belonged to}} Horodecki, {{consisted}} of a study, a great room and a living room, a dining room, a boudoir, <b>a</b> <b>bedroom,</b> a children's room, a room for a governess, a guest room, three rooms for servants, a kitchen, dishwashing room, bathroom, two toilets, and two storage rooms. On the floor above was an apartment similar in size and design to Horodecki's apartment. The apartment {{on the top floor}} had one less room; to make up for this, there was a connecting terrace which provided a panoramic view of the city.|$|E
