5|$|A further {{survey in}} late 2015 by {{watchdog}} Transport Focus, found that satisfaction levels had increased; 89% of passengers {{surveyed said they}} were either ‘very’ or ‘fairly’ satisfied with their overall journey, up from 83% in 2013, but still {{below the national average}} of 92%. It <b>also</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> 58% felt the service was value for money. The national average rating for value for money on all tram networks was 69%.|$|E
5|$|An {{analysis}} by British staff {{officers of the}} initial period of the Normandy campaign found that 7% of all German tanks destroyed by British forces were knocked out by PIATs, compared to 6% by rockets fired by aircraft. However, they <b>also</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> once German tanks had been fitted with armoured skirts that detonated hollow-charge ammunition before it could penetrate the tank's armour, the weapon became much less effective.|$|E
5|$|Asch {{found that}} some 1/4 of all {{subjects}} successfully withstands this form of social pressure, 1//20 completely succumbs, while the remainder conforms to the majority's manifestly incorrect opinion only in some experimental rounds. Asch suggested that this procedure created a doubt in the participants' mind about the seemingly obvious answer. Participants reported that the correct but rejected line was almost but not quite equal to the standard line. Asch <b>also</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> {{the effectiveness of the}} group pressure increased significantly from 1 person to 3 people unanimously responding incorrectly. However, there was not much increase after that. He <b>also</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> when one confederate responded correctly, the power of the majority to influence the subject decreased substantially.|$|E

5|$|Despite {{the poor}} press {{surrounding}} the release, an independent study of select iOS users by Kantar Group {{found that in}} January 2015, 23% of music listeners played at least one song by U2, {{more than any other}} artist for that month. The study <b>also</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> of those who listened to U2 music, 95% of them accessed at least one track from Songs of Innocence.|$|E
5|$|Google has {{questioned}} the proposal, saying the prohibitions {{would be too}} broad. It is strongly opposed by free speech groups. A poll conducted by McNair Ingenuity Research for the Hungry Beast television program found that 80% of their 1,000 respondents were in favour {{of the concept of}} the plan. The survey <b>also</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> 91% were concerned about the government's intent to keep the list of filtered websites a secret.|$|E
5|$|In 2008 a {{research}} team including Alena Grabowski, Rodger Kram and Hugh Herr conducted a follow-up study of single amputees with running blades {{which was published}} in Biology Letters. Each of six amputees' affected leg performance was compared against that of their biological leg. The team measured leg swing times and force applied to the running surface on a high-speed treadmill at the Biomechanics Laboratory of the Orthopedic Specialty Hospital, and also studied video of sprint runners from the Olympics and Paralympics. They found no difference in leg swing times at different speeds, and recorded leg swing times similar to that of non-disabled sprinters. They <b>also</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> single running blades reduced the foot to ground force production of the tested runners by an average of 9 percent. Because force production is generally considered the most significant factor in running speed, the researchers concluded that this reduction in force limited the sprinters' top speed. Grabowski <b>also</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> amputees typically increased their leg swing times to compensate for the lack of force.|$|E
50|$|Since then, {{a number}} of other {{departments}} have been set up: Electrical Engineering, Economics (both in 1990), Medicine (1991), Psychology & Methodology (1995). In 1995, the Faculty of Manufacturing Engineering was split into the Faculty of Technologic Engineering and the Faculty of the Science and Engineering of Materials. Two colleges were <b>also</b> <b>founded</b> <b>that</b> year, that of Forestry and that of 'Economics and Computer Science'.|$|R

5000|$|The {{information}} {{obtained from the}} expedition helped with the further study of glaciology, meteorology, and geology. It <b>found</b> <b>that</b> the world's [...] "sea-level was principally controlled {{by the state of}} the Antarctic ice-sheet." [...] It also improved the understanding {{of the impact of the}} Antarctic ice-sheets on the regulation of the world's climate. It <b>also</b> <b>found</b> evidence <b>that</b> suggest a portion of Antarctica (Dronning Maud Land) was once joined to southern Africa. Further scientific studies have <b>also</b> <b>found</b> strong evidence <b>that</b> eastern Antarctica was adjacent to southern Africa until the late Jurassic period.|$|R
5|$|In 2016, a study {{published}} in the Lancet reported that state laws only requiring background checks or permits for gun sales at gun shows were associated with higher rates of gun-related deaths. The same study <b>also</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> state laws that required background checks for all gun sales were strongly associated with lower rates of gun-related deaths.|$|E
5|$|In nature, it was {{observed}} that males would venture away from the nest in order to attract females. The males would press their gastral sterna against a perch and rub their mandibular against it. This is used to attract females, and females were observed to visit these branches and sample the scents. Interestingly, it was <b>also</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> on some occasions, males were attracted to other male scents.|$|E
5|$|Investigators <b>also</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> the deicing {{procedures}} at LaGuardia were substandard. While the jet {{encountered a}} delay {{of up to}} 35 minutes, {{they found that the}} deicing fluid that was being used at the airport, and by the majority of commercial airlines across the United States, was effective for only fifteen minutes. The accident led to a number of studies into the effect that ice has on aircraft, and several recommendations into prevention techniques.|$|E

5|$|It was {{reported}} that discussions over different types of deicing fluid were discussed, along with different deicing equipment and techniques. They <b>also</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> the pilot in command was the ultimate authority for take off decisions, but that all operators had to provide proper training and criteria for the pilot in command to base a proper decision on.|$|E
5|$|Most {{people should}} like their name. Those {{that do not}} should not like their name letters. Hoorens and Nuttin tested this and found that most people rated their name {{relatively}} highly.

5|$|Van der Aue {{worked on}} {{procedures}} for surface decompression and oxygen {{use in the}} early 1950s and during his research found problems with the 1937 tables for long dive times. He <b>also</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> the fast tissues which had been dropped in the 1930s would control decompression in some cases, so he re-introduced the fast compartments to the model, and added an extra slower compartment to better model long-duration dives.|$|E
5|$|A 2017 {{histological}} {{study of}} growth lines {{found that the}} Portuguese Baryonyx specimen had died between the age of 23 and 25 years old, and was close to its maximum size and skeletal maturity. This contradicted a younger age indicated by the neurocentral sutures not being fused, {{and the presence of}} both mature and sub-adult traits may be due to paedomorphosis (where juvenile traits are retained into adulthood). Paedomorphic traits may be related to swimming locomotion, as they have been suggested in other extinct animals thought to have been aquatic (such as plesiosaurs and temnospondyls). The study <b>also</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> the animal had reached sexual maturity at the age of 13 to 15 years, due to a decrease in growth rate at this point.|$|E
50|$|With {{the signing}} of Treaty no. 3 in 1873 to 1916, site area was homesteaded by the Rainy Lake First Nations. Evidence of cabins and farm {{buildings}} were <b>also</b> <b>found</b> from <b>that</b> time on the site.|$|R
