5|$|Enraged by the deception, Fionna {{takes out}} the crystal sword to fight. The sword {{turns out to be}} another one of Ice Queen’s tricks and turns into a ball of ice around Fionna’s hands. Cake hears noises from downstairs and senses Fionna is in trouble. Undaunted, Fionna uses the ice to beat Ice Queen over the head. Ice Queen pushes her off with a burst of snow which allows Fionna to get close to enough to break Prince Gumball free and knock out the Ice Queen with a broken icicle. Cake bursts in and sees Gumball {{standing}} next to Fionna in her torn dress; she jumps to the wrong conclusion and lunges at him but Fionna stops Cake and tells her it was the Ice Queen all <b>along.</b> <b>Just</b> then Ice Queen recovers and blasts Cake away from Fionna only to have Fionna knock her magic tiara off which negates her powers. The real Gumball asks Fionna on a date and is turned down; Fionna notes that she does not need a boyfriend at the moment.|$|E

Hook thanks Emma, but Emma says that there's no need to. Hook apologizes for what he said on his ship, and when Emma asks if he meant his saying that he didn't love her, or refusing to accept who she now was, {{he says that he}} still did and will always love her. When Emma asks Hook what he wants, he says that he wants to help her, and asks who Nimue is. She says that Nimue doesn't matter anymore, and that it will all be over tomorrow. Hook asks why she needs the sword. Emma walks away and Hook says he knows she has reasons for doing this, and Emma tells Hook that she does, and that she’s doing all of this for him, before disappearing.|$|E

2500|$|The {{songs on}} Dylan's 1975 album Blood on the Tracks have been {{described}} by several of Dylan's biographers and critics as arising from the tension as his marriage to Sara collapsed. The album was recorded soon after the couple's initial separation. Dylan biographers Robert Shelton and Clinton Heylin have cautioned against interpreting the album as naked autobiography, arguing that Blood On The Tracks works on many levels—musical, spiritual, poetic—as well as a personal confession. [...] Dylan himself denied {{at the time of}} the album's release that Blood on the Tracks was autobiographical, but Jakob Dylan has said, [...] "When I'm listening to 'Subterranean Homesick Blues' I'm grooving <b>along</b> <b>just</b> like you.

2500|$|The English word [...] "construct" [...] has the {{connotation}} of systematically {{building the}} thing constructed. The most common way presented {{to construct a}} regular polyhedron is via a fold-out net. To obtain a fold-out net of a polyhedron, one takes {{the surface of the}} polyhedron and cuts it <b>along</b> <b>just</b> enough edges so that the surface may be laid out flat. This gives a plan for the net of the unfolded polyhedron. Since the Platonic solids have only triangles, squares and pentagons for faces, and these are all constructible with a ruler and compass, there exist ruler-and-compass methods for drawing these fold-out nets. The same applies to star polyhedra, although here we must be careful to make the net for only the visible outer surface.|$|E
2500|$|To {{determine}} the team match-ups {{in the tournament}} a representative of each team entered a Battle royal where the order of elimination determined when the team would wrestle {{in the first round}} [...] the first two wrestlers eliminated would face off, then the next two and the next two, with the final two men in the ring facing off in the last of the opening round matches. The first Battle Royal, on February 17, included Euforia, Kraneo, La Mascara, Mascara Dorada, Maximo, Mr. Aguila, Mr. Niebla and Valiente. The match ended with La Mascara and Valiente as the last two wrestlers in the ring, which meant their teams would meet in the final first round match that evening. In the first round 2010 and 2011 winner Máscara Dorada formed a very well functioning, high flying team with Volador Jr. to defeat the team of Guerrero Maya Jr. and Euforia. The Parejas increibles concept was really highlighted in the second tournament match as Maximo, who plays an Exotico character, a character who is displays openly homosexual tendencies. During the match Maximo tried to kiss his opponents to distract them, but when denied he kissed his partner Mephisto instead. This enraged Mephisto who attacked his own partner and knocked him out, leaving him easy prey for La Sombra and Mr. Águila {{to move on to the}} next round. The other half of the 2010 and 2011 tournament winner put his differences with Mr. Niebla aside to allow the team to defeat Brazo de Plata and Kraneo, putting them in the second round. The final first round match saw Averno team up with the man that had forced him to unmask in 2011 at CMLL's Juicio Final ("Final Justice") show. The two got <b>along</b> <b>just</b> long enough to defeat Valiente and Olímpico. During the first of two second round matches Volador Jr. landed wrong during a leaping move and had to actually be taken from the arena on a stretcher while the match was still going on. It is unclear if Volador Jr.'s injury forced a change to the original plans or if La Sombra and Mr. Águila had been booked to win the match from the beginning. CMLL may have wanted the 2010 and 2011 winners to face off in the semifinal but due to Volador Jr.'s injury that matchup never happened. In the other first round match. The final second round match saw Atlantis continue his Parejas Increibles tournament success as Atlantis and Mr. Niebla defeated Averno and La Mascara. The third round saw more success for Atlantis and Mr. Niebla as they earned a spot in the finals when they disposed of La Sombra and Mr. Águila in their one fall match.|$|E
