The observed effects were sex, litter size, month of birth, year of birth, mother's age, father's line, and mother's father line. There was found <b>a</b> statistically highly <b>significant</b> difference in the monitoring of sex influence in male lambs (34, 69 kg). <b>A</b> statistically <b>significant</b> difference was found in singles (35, 14 kg) when evaluating the influence of litter size. There was found <b>a</b> statistically <b>significant</b> differences between the lambs born in May (36, 78 kg) and February (37, 29 kg), according to the influence of the month of birth.

40|$|AbstractThis {{research}} has been performed {{with the aim of}} determining the relation between emotional intelligence (EI) and self-efficacy of the staff of the Hamedan Branch of Islamic Azad University. The static domain of the research is composed of the staff of the mentioned university. In gathering the data the field method has been used and the measuring tools of emotional intelligence (EI), Questionary of Siber and vertical self-efficacy Questionary of Sherer and colleagues have been used. The data have been analyzed with the help of Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, Pearson Correlation, co efficacy of Espirmen Watson test and linear analysis of Verrison. The results obtained from Pearson Correlation showed that there is <b>a</b> positive <b>significant</b> correlation between emotional intelligence (EI) and self-efficacy (r = 0. 7). Also Pearson Correlation shows that there is <b>a</b> positive <b>significant</b> correlation between self-awareness and self-efficacy (r = 0. 7) and <b>a</b> positive <b>significant</b> correlation between self-control and selfefficacy (r = 0. 5). Also from Pearson Correlation it was found <b>a</b> positive <b>significant</b> correlation between intimacy and self-efficacy (r = 0. 4) and <b>a</b> positive <b>significant</b> correlation social skills and self-efficacy (r = 0. 5).
