5|$|In 1956, Allen became {{chairman}} of the MCC's Cricket Committee. The committee looked <b>at</b> <b>ways</b> <b>to</b> improve cricket, for example analysing whether reducing {{the size of the}} ball would help bowlers. Allen also began to pursue bowlers with illegal bowling actions; commentators were aware that this was a growing issue but no action had been taken, and Allen took the lead. Three English bowlers were no-balled for throwing in 1959 and another five in 1960. Geoff Griffin, a bowler who toured England with the South African team in 1960, was perceived to have a suspect action; when the bowler was no-balled for throwing in a Test match, the South African press suggested that Allen had played a prominent part. Later that year, Allen met Bradman, Australia's representative at the Imperial Cricket Conference (ICC); the pair wanted to ensure that bowling actions would be fair in future, and the ICC agreed to take action. When Australia toured England in 1961, no bowlers whose actions had been questioned were included in either team. Allen later took the lead in re-drafting the law on throwing.|$|E

The study considered Cape May City withdrawing from the regional district or {{the dissolution of the}} district, converting Lower Township's existing PreK-6 district to serve PreK-12, as the regional district's school facilities are located in the township. Cape May City and West Cape May could see annual savings approaching a combined $6 million from the dissolution.|$|E
25|$|Current {{research}} is looking <b>at</b> <b>ways</b> <b>to</b> consider tumor marker proteomics {{in combination with}} other indicators of disease (i.e. radiology and/or symptoms) to improve diagnostic accuracy. The challenge in such an approach is that the disparate prevalence of ovarian cancer means that even testing with very high sensitivity and specificity will still lead to a number of false positive results, which in turn may lead to issues such as performing surgical procedures in which cancer is not found intraoperatively. Genomics approaches have not yet been developed for ovarian cancer.|$|E

With the enforced break in construction, and its new authority over the entire road, the commission began to look <b>at</b> <b>ways</b> <b>to</b> improve what had already been built, {{especially in light of}} the road's growing role as a regional artery. The Hawthorne Circle, where the Taconic, Saw Mill River Parkway and NY100 intersected, was the major problem. It had become a magnet for accidents and congestion. A 1944 study recommended it be replaced with a three-level grade-separated interchange.|$|E

25|$|This type {{of therapy}} uses {{a blend of}} cognitive, {{behavioral}} and some humanistic training techniques to target the stressors of the client. This usually is used to help clients better cope with their stress or anxiety after stressful events. This is a three-phase process that trains the client to use skills that they already have to better adapt to their current stressors. The first phase is an interview phase that includes psychological testing, client self-monitoring, {{and a variety of}} reading materials. This allows the therapist to individually tailor the training process to the client. Clients learn how to categorize problems into emotion-focused or problem-focused, so that they can better treat their negative situations. This phase ultimately prepares the client to eventually confront and reflect upon their current reactions to stressors, before looking <b>at</b> <b>ways</b> <b>to</b> change their reactions and emotions in relation to their stressors. The focus is conceptualization.|$|E

500|$|The early 19th {{century has}} been seen as a time of decline for the society; of 662 fellows in 1830, only 104 had contributed to the Philosophical Transactions. The same year, Charles Babbage {{published}} [...] Reflections on the Decline of Science in England, and on Some of Its Causes, which was deeply critical of the Society. The scientific Fellows of the Society were spurred into action by this, and eventually James South established a Charters Committee [...] "with a view to obtaining a supplementary Charter from the Crown", aimed primarily at looking <b>at</b> <b>ways</b> <b>to</b> restrict membership. The Committee recommended that the election of Fellows take place on one day every year, that the Fellows be selected on consideration of their scientific achievements and that the number of fellows elected a year be limited to 15. This limit was increased to 17 in 1930 and 20 in 1937; it is currently 52. This had a number of effects on the Society: first, the Society's membership became almost entirely scientific, with few political Fellows or patrons. Second, the number of Fellows was significantly reduced—between 1700 and 1850, the number of Fellows rose from approximately 100 to approximately 750. From then until 1941, the total number of Fellows was always between 400 and 500.|$|E
500|$|Reception of {{the race}} was mainly negative. Italian {{newspaper}} Corriere dello Sport – Stadio called it [...] "boring", while fellow Italian paper Corriere della Sera wrote of [...] "Formula One like a sleeping pill". Sky Sports described the race as [...] "mundane" [...] and [...] "soporific". Spanish newspaper Sport highlighted Max Verstappen's [...] "spectacular" [...] overtaking as bringing [...] "the only colour" [...] into the race. The Independent wrote, referring to Hamilton's desperate attempts to pass Rosberg: [...] "If {{there was ever a}} race which confirmed that Formula One should be looking <b>at</b> <b>ways</b> <b>to</b> facilitate overtaking, this was it." [...] In the wake of his experience, Hamilton called for Formula One to adjust rules to enhance overtaking, saying: [...] "I guess for fans it's probably not too exciting to watch. Of course, it's always nice when you're at the front, as we have been for some time now - but still, being able to race is what... and also down the back, {{the rest of the field}} is probably what fans want to see. That's probably a change that would be looked positively on." [...] Sebastian Vettel agreed, calling for more grip created by the tyres to make it easier to follow a car closely.|$|E
500|$|The {{sound design}} team {{began working on}} the game early in development, {{in order to achieve}} the best results; they {{immediately}} realised that it would be challenging. Early in development, Druckmann told the sound team to [...] "make it subtle", and underplay ideas. Audio lead Phillip Kovats was excited to completely create all sounds; no sounds were carried across from previous games. The team looked <b>at</b> <b>ways</b> <b>to</b> create sounds from a naturalistic point-of-view, and how to introduce minimalism into a game. By doing so, they found that it added feelings of tension, loss and hope, and that the game appeared to be a typical [...] "action game" [...] without the minimalism approach. They used a high dynamic range, allowing them the opportunity to inform players on tactical information, and locations to explore. The game's sound design was created to reflect a more [...] "grounded" [...] and subtle mood than Uncharted, particularly focusing on the lack of sound. Taking inspiration from No Country for Old Men, the team attempted to [...] "do more with less"; Kovats said that the team was trying to tell a story by [...] "going for a reductive quality". Straley stated that the audio is vital to some scenes in the game; [...] "It's more about the psychology of what's happening on the audioscape than what you're seeing," [...] he stated. He felt that this decision allowed a more impactful and meaningful effect with sound occurred. The sound team also attempted to portray the game's dark themes through sound. The team felt {{that it was important to}} let sounds play for as long as possible in the game, drawing tension. The team used a propagation technique to help players determine the exact locations of enemies, using this as a tactical advantage. This system, created by the team at Naughty Dog, is processed at random in the game engine. For the game's audio, the engine throws out 1500–2500 ray casts per frame; though most games avoid this, the game's engine allowed it to work. The team spent a lot of time recording sounds for the game, namely doors, and rusty metal. Sound designer Neil Uchitel traveled to Rio de Janeiro, discovering locations to record sounds; he recorded chickens, which were used in the game as the voices of rats. The team continued to add and change the game's sounds until the end of development.|$|E

Non-logistic models peak not necessarily <b>at</b> half <b>way</b> (but <b>at</b> some other point) {{to the ultimate}} recovery (see table 1). Peaking of logistic and non-logistic models are functions of the models, and not geology.

2500|$|In {{the years}} {{immediately}} following World War II, bus operators in the United Kingdom faced a downturn {{in the numbers of}} passengers carried and manufacturers began looking <b>at</b> <b>ways</b> <b>to</b> economise. [...] A few experimental rear-engined buses had been produced before the war but none successfully made it beyond the prototype stage. [...] The need to minimise the intrusion of the engine into passenger carrying space was a priority, leading to several underfloor-engined single-deck designs. [...] However, such designs raised the height of the floor of the vehicle, forcing additional steps at the entrance. On double decker buses, these problems were amplified, causing either an increase in the overall height of the vehicle or an inadequate interior height.|$|E
2500|$|With {{the land}} {{surfaces}} still sinking, the Commissioners looked <b>at</b> <b>ways</b> <b>to</b> improve {{the discharge of}} the engines in 1919, but did not take any immediate action. Instead, they considered {{the replacement of the}} steam engines by oil engines, and in 1924 asked Blackstone and Company Limited to supply two [...] oil engines, each with a [...] Gwynne rotary pump, capable of pumping 150 tons per minute. The engines were to be erected alongside the existing engines, which could then still be used as a backup in an emergency. The new Brandon engine was installed by Autumn 1925, but the completion of the Lark engine was celebrated in a much grander style, with all taxpayers from the district being invited to the opening, which was followed by a lunch party.|$|E
2500|$|In 1995, the Great Falls Public Schools {{commissioned}} a study which looked <b>at</b> <b>ways</b> <b>to</b> alleviate overcrowding at GFHS {{as well as}} make the school IDEA-compliant.

Too few voters turned out in balloting on April 2 and June 4, 1996, for a valid election to occur. A third election was successful, however. The bond issue funded construction of 13 new classrooms and the elevator. The classroom addition to Bison Fieldhouse (known as [...] "South Campus") opened in the summer of 1998. The elevator began operation the same year. [...] In 1999, a local attorney and his family donated $300,000 to GFHS to build a one-story addition to the northern end of the school to accommodate wrestling training and weight-lifting facilities.|$|E

2500|$|The {{section of}} I-81 between {{the village of}} Adams {{and the city of}} Watertown was {{constructed}} in the late 1950s. At the time, I-81 connected to the hamlets of Rices and Watertown Center via Rices Road, a local highway that went north from the I-81 interchange and made a sharp eastward turn to cross the railroad tracks at Rices before continuing northeastward to US11. Rices Road was acquired by the state of New York [...] and designated NY232. In 1965, the New York State Department of Transportation began looking <b>at</b> <b>ways</b> <b>to</b> eliminate the turn and grade crossing at Rices. The results of the study led the state to develop a project moving NY232 onto a new, more southerly alignment that bypassed the turn at Rices and crossed the rail line on an overpass. Construction on the road began June14, 1968, and was completed in November 1969 at a cost of $1.36million (equivalent to $ in [...] ).
