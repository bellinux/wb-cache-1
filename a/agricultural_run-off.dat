Despite {{of the lack of}} systematic data limiting an accurate and detailed assessment of the scope of the problems, there is a consensus that: (i) the overall poor quality of surface, groundwater and coastal water resources {{is the result of a}} lack of waste water management and <b>agricultural</b> <b>run-off,</b> causing health problems that disproportionally affect the poor; (ii) water scarcity is a regional problem resulting from poor demand management in irrigation, urban water supply and tourist infrastructure in drier regions; (iii) weak watershed management leads to soil erosion and amplifies the damage and frequency of flooding; and (iv) the overall lack of solid waste management pollutes water sources, causes disease and is a nuisance for inhabitants and visitors alike. The DR government is in the process of reducing its role as main investor for water resources infrastructure and services provider decentralizing some responsibilities to local and regional government, water users organizations, and private companies.|$|E

30|$|In 1987, all the {{countries}} around the Baltic Sea agreed that by 1995, {{there should be a}} reduction of 50 % of the nutrient load reaching the Sea. This goal is still unachieved and the environmental degradation of the Baltic Sea continues (HELCOM 2011). From all the input sources, agriculture is the biggest one and accounts for almost 50 % of all the nutrients leaching to the sea. Almost half of those <b>agricultural</b> <b>run-offs</b> come from Poland, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania and their share is likely to increase. The dissolution of the Soviet block in 1989 and the consequent entry into market economy had a significant effect on the economies of the Central and Eastern European countries (CEEC). The subsequent crash in farm-gate prices of most agricultural products and the reorganisation of the agricultural sector resulted in a more extensive land use where the utilisation of pesticides and chemical fertilizers was dramatically reduced (Petersen and Hoogeveen 2004). However, as their economies recover, their agricultural practices are predicted to intensify again, a fact that is noticeable in the Baltic States (HELCOM 2011).|$|R
30|$|According to {{a review}} by Stolze et al. (2000), organic farming {{achieves}} higher biodiversity than conventional agriculture, {{due to the}} bans on pesticide, higher habitat heterogeneity and more extensive land use overall. Furthermore, organic farming generally decreases soil erosion, and conserves soil fertility and soil system stability to a higher degree than conventional farming. These properties can decrease the amount of nutrients leaching from agricultural land that result in eutrophication (Stolze et al. 2000; Larsson and Granstedt 2010). In turn, this has indirect, yet significant, effects on fisheries and tourism sectors (HELCOM 2004; Diaz and Rosenberg 2008). HELCOMa stresses {{that in the future}} “the EU agricultural policy will {{play a major role in}} the development of the condition of the Baltic Sea” (HELCOM 2011, p. 86).

As a result, cypermethrin has been the centre of attention of many researches dealing with susceptibility of fish to <b>agricultural</b> <b>run-offs.</b> Type II pyrethroids are extensively used for pest management because of their relatively low toxicity to birds and mammals.

3000|$|A {{habitable}} {{aquatic ecosystem}} requires a good supply of dissolved {{oxygen in the}} water system (Davis 1975). Along the Mara River basin, the mean dissolved oxygen was highest in the river followed by rock pools, while the lowest was recorded in swamps. A significant difference in mean dissolved oxygen was observed among the different habitat types. Faster flowing sections of rivers and drying stream and sections that flow through riffles or small waterfalls have better oxygenated waters than slow flowing sections of rivers or rivers that have been modified as straight channels. Dissolved oxygen concentration in water is dependent on physical, chemical, biological and microbiological processes. Low dissolved oxygen concentrations (< 3 mg/L) in fresh water ecosystems are indicative of high pollution levels (Okbah and Tayel 1999). However, in the current study, some aquatic habitats recorded dissolved oxygen levels insufficient to support aquatic life. Analysis to determine preferable level of dissolved oxygen range required by both mosquito larvae and predators in the shared habitat indicated that values ranging between 6.0 mg/L, and 6.5 mg/L were most preferred. However, some mosquito larvae were found in water samples with dissolved oxygen concentration as low as 2.3 mg/L. The {{most common cause of}} low oxygen levels is the off-load of organic material into the water system (such as <b>agricultural</b> <b>run-offs).</b> Nevertheless, more mosquito larvae were collected in slow-flowing drying stream and swamps where the mean oxygen was relatively low. The majority were mainly Culex spp., however Anopheles species were also higher as compared to the ephemeral habitats. previous studies reported Culex spp. to occur in habitats with wide range of [...] dissolved oxygen (DO) levels (Opoku et al. 2007).This may also suggest that majority of predators were unable to survive in polluted water or the water volume was sufficient to maintain high number of mosquitoes beyond predator’s capacity. Also, streams and rivers have burrows at the banks which can help in refuge of the mosquitoes. In fact, majority of the mosquitoes were captured {{at the edges of the}} streams, most of which are vegetated.|$|R
40|$|The {{dynamics}} and peculiarities {{of the heavy}} metals (Cu, Pb, Zn, As, V, Cr, Ni) migration were established in {{the system of the}} river Uzh bottom deposits. An excess in maximum permissible concentration among such elements as Zn, V, As, and Cu was detected in surface waters. We may connect the elevated level of Cu and Zn with natural (metals appearing in ground water run-off, ablation from iron ore, the reaction of interstitial water), anthropogenic (sewage disposals from communal households and manufacturing plants, <b>agricultural</b> <b>run-offs),</b> and hydrochemical (pH of water medium, methylation of non-organic metal compounds, metals release from the organic compounds composition, ingress from bottom deposits) factors. The high concentrations of vanadium in water as well as in bottom deposits are most probably induced by the leaching of elements from the regional volcanic rocks. The plumbum content did not exceed the higher-than-normal rates; however, significant element accumulation was detected in bottom deposits outside the city of Uzhgorod which {{may be the result of}} ecotoxicant ingress along with land runoff from the riverside highways laid parallel to the water course. In comparison with background measures, the highest chromium and nickel concentrations were detected near the streamlet Domoradzh and, therefore, it is assumed that the industrial wastewaters serve here as a source of heavy metals. The reservoir in the lowland is above all enriched by arsenic. Areas under agricultural use are significantly concentrated in lowlands. Runoffs from these areas are the main source of the ore supply. However, the impact of municipal domestic waste water which contains arsenic-containing detergents should not be excluded. Moreover, we found a relationship between the relief heterogeneity of the study area and distribution of heavy metals in the hydro-ecosystem. The accomplished comparative analysis of the territories under study indicates the significant pollution level of the surface waters in technologically transformed areas, whereas the largest accumulation of pollutants is concentrated in bottom deposits of the river, which indicates a constant supply of pollutants to the streamflow...|$|R

Pastoralists voiced concerns about water quality and quantity, linking problems with water to human population expansion and changing land use patterns. For example, in addition to increasing competition for available water, new agricultural development has physically blocked livestock access to surface water sources. Destruction of forests for charcoal production and farming as well as increased harvest of remaining trees near water sources for cooking fuel were identified as important drivers of decreased water quality.

30|$|The organotin {{tributyltin}} (TBT) is {{a widely}} used component of paints, which {{has been reported to}} mount up in fish and marine wildlife due to extensive harbor activities, fishing, etc. Several studies have reported that high levels of TBT persist in coastal waters and seafoods (Jiang et al. 2001). TBT has been evidenced to bioaccumulate as conjugates in organisms with biomagnification in the food web and thus affecting human health and environment. Among the various possible sources of contamination, metal-based antifouling agents evidently contribute greatly (Loganathan et al. 2001). TBT is commonly used as a biocide in antifouling paints and as wood preservatives. It is also used as an antifungal agent in textiles, industrial water systems (such as cooling towers and refrigeration water systems), wood pulp, paper mill systems, and breweries (Kimbrough 1976). TBT is a toxic contaminant of marine bionetwork causing irreversible damage to the marine life (Zuo et al. 2012; Revathi et al. 2013). Several studies report that TBT inflicts immunotoxicity, reproductive toxicity, embryotoxicity, genotoxicity (Antizar-Ladislao 2008) and endocrine disrupting effects (Lagadic et al. 2007). Accretion of industrial effluents and <b>agricultural</b> <b>run-offs</b> in water bodies {{has turned out to be}} the most important disquiet in freshwater ecosystems (FAO 1986). TBT exposure, been reported to have negative impact on survival, growth, reproduction, and development of marine species (Gibbs and Bryan 1986; Maguire 1987). However, the potential effect of TBT toxicity and impairment on male fertility of marine wildlife is not yet clearly known (Lewis and Ford 2012). The current and upcoming restrictions will not immediately remove TBT and its degradation products from the marine environment, since these compounds are persistent in the sediments. Hence, article was aimed at finding the impact of TBT in male Syrian hamster as the model organism adopting biochemical and histological analysis of major target organs with a view that the outcome can potentially reflect in the biological processes such as growth and reproduction. This can also throw light on early effects of the toxicant in/on the cells of organs such as liver, kidney, testis, etc. (Hinton et al. 1992; Mohan Raj 2007). Biochemical parameters are considered to be the best early indicators of oxidative stress condition caused by xenobiotics (Emmanouil et al. 2008). Antioxidant reactions of living organisms are the central defense mechanisms recruited to circumvent the effects of toxicants. Several reports suggest that these responses can be used as biomarkers that reflect pollution levels of such toxic substances (Huang et al. 2005 a, b). Enzymatic anti-oxidants such as SOD, CAT and GPx, and non-enzymatic antioxidants such as GSH, vitamin C and vitamin E constitute the antioxidant defense system against reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the cells whereas AST, ALP, and ALT are the serum indicators of tissue injury.|$|R
40|$|Faecal {{contamination}} of aqueous environments remains a significant environmental problem. Faecal pollution causes degradation of both chemical and microbial water quality, exposing {{the public to}} a variety of pathogenic organisms. Contamination may originate from direct and indirect faecal sources. Direct sources of faecal contamination include piggery and dairy pond effluents, sewage, birds, bathers, or grazing animals with direct access to waterways. Indirect sources may comprise <b>agricultural</b> <b>run-offs,</b> or leaking septic tanks or sewage distribution systems. Discrimination of the origin of faecal contamination would enable monitoring agencies to predict associated disease risks more accurately, as well as implement strategies to mitigate the contaminating source. Escherichia coli, faecal coliforms and enterococci are extensively used as indicators of faecal pollution in water. These organisms are, however, widely distributed in the intestines of warm-blooded animals and hence enumeration does not define faecal origin. It has been suggested that bacterial strains may adapt to their environmental niche and consequently, host association of strains may be apparent. The development of highly discriminatory molecular fingerprinting techniques provides an opportunity to distinguish closely related strains. These techniques may be suitable for locating host associative factors and hence defining the source of faecal contamination. The scope the research described in this thesis was to develop a method capable of discriminating sources of faecal contamination in the environment. Agricultural faecal sources were primarily targeted as they represent a significant source of faecal contamination in New Zealand waterways. Two molecular fingerprinting techniques — Randomly Amplified Polymorphic DNA and Amplified Fragment Length Polymorphism — were investigated for their ability to detect genotypic markers in E. coli. A polymorphic fragment (714 bp) indicative of dairy cattle faecal isolates was identified by AFLP analysis. To facilitate rapid screening of isolates, PCR primers were designed to amplify a segment (462 bp) of the polymorphic fragment. The marker was specific for dairy cattle faecal isolates and was present in approximately half of the strains. Field study results demonstrated that the marker provided a feasible approach for monitoring "special interest" samples such as monitoring significant pollution incidences, supporting prosecution cases or identifying an illusive source of persistent water quality degradation at a particular site. In these instances the diagnostic marker may assist by verifying or eliminating suspected contaminating sources. AFLP analysis was used to locate a marker diagnostic of faecal origin, and indicated that further markers could be identified. Although RAPD-PCR analysis did not locate a diagnostic marker, the technique appeared to corroborate the AFLP results. The inability to obtain a highly specific marker using RAPD analysis may have been a function of the limited primer combinations that were screened. The AFLP technique could be used to construct a library of markers, enabling differentiation {{of a wide range of}} contaminating sources...|$|R
