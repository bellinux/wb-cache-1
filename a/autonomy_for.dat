40|$|Objective. Based on {{tenets of}} {{self-determination}} theory, the present manuscript examined {{the hypothesis that}} a physical activity intervention programme that supported the universal psychological need <b>for</b> <b>autonomy</b> would motivate {{a large proportion of}} young individuals to engage in physical activity. In contrast, we hypothesized that interventions that did not support the universal psychological need <b>for</b> <b>autonomy</b> would motivate a smaller proportion of young individuals to endorse the physical activity programme. Method. A field experiment was conducted. Participants were randomly allocated to an intervention that supported the psychological need <b>for</b> <b>autonomy</b> and two conditions that did not support the psychological need <b>for</b> <b>autonomy</b> (rationale-only or forced-choice conditions). Results. It was demonstrated that more young individuals initiated and completed a physical activity intervention programme when the programme supported the psychological need <b>for</b> <b>autonomy</b> than when the programme did not support the psychological need <b>for</b> <b>autonomy.</b> Conclusions. Results of the present study provide additional evidence to a growing body of literature recognizing the importance of universal psychological needs in motivating health-related behaviours.

A number of factors distinguished the attitudes of Aleppo's elite and populace from those of Damascus. For one, the economic well-being of Aleppo's inhabitants was dependent on open, commercial access to Aleppo's Anatolian hinterland, which was predominantly populated by Turks; southwestern Anatolia was the principal market for Aleppo's goods and the principal supplier of its food and raw materials.|$|E

Support for a strong, centralized Argentine government was based in Buenos Aires, and gave rise to two opposing groups. The wealthy and educated of the Unitarian Party, such as Sarmiento, favored centralized government. In opposition to them were the Federalists, who were mainly based in rural areas and tended to reject European mores. Numbering figures such as Manuel Dorrego and Juan Facundo Quiroga among their ranks, they were in favor of a loose federation with more <b>autonomy</b> <b>for</b> the individual provinces.|$|E

The delegation's mission was to present a memorandum to the great powers concerning the implementation of reforms in the Armenian provinces of the Ottoman Empire. The delegation's main goal was to secure substantial reforms in the Armenian provinces that would be supervised by European powers—which meant Russia in reality, as its troops where stationed in parts of Armenia. Armenians hoped that Russian pressure (and threat of intervention) would force the Ottoman government to improve conditions in the Armenian provinces. The Armenian delegation furthermore demanded some form of <b>autonomy</b> <b>for</b> the Armenian provinces, similar to the Maronite autonomy in Mount Lebanon, but did not advocate breakup of the Ottoman Empire or annexation of the Armenian provinces into Russia.|$|E
40|$|Introduction: Smoking {{is one of}} {{the leading}} causes of illness and death in the western world. 27 % of the German adult {{population}} are smokers. Thus primary and secondary preventive measures are of utmost importance to public health. A possible preventive measure is the implementation of tobacco control interventions in emergency departments (ED). One means to improve the outcome of tobacco control interventions in EDs could be the increasing consideration of patient autonomy in patient-doctor-relationships. However, to date no studies have been conducted concerning smokers’ desire <b>for</b> <b>autonomy</b> in the patient-doctor-relationship in an ED setting. Therefore the aim of this study was to determine predictive factors for the desire <b>for</b> smokers’ <b>autonomy</b> in the patient-doctor-relationship in an inner city emergency department. Methods: During 15 months, 1012 smokers (nicotine consumption ≥ 1 cigarette per day), who attended the inner city ED of the Charité University Medicine Berlin, Campus Mitte, were screened for their smoking habits and their desire <b>for</b> <b>autonomy</b> in the patient-doctor-relationship (by means of the “Decision Making Preference Scale” (DMPS) of the Autonomy Preference Index (API)) using a computerized questionnaire. Results: Predictive factors for the desire <b>for</b> <b>autonomy</b> in the patient-doctor-relationship were gender and school education: women and smokers with a high school diploma had a higher desire <b>for</b> <b>autonomy</b> than men and smokers without a high school diploma. This association was independent of smoking variables. Concerning the multivariate statistics, a finite mixture model identified two subpopulations within the study population: 78 % of the study population showed lower desire <b>for</b> <b>autonomy</b> in the patient-doctor-relationship, opposed to 22 % who showed high desire <b>for</b> <b>autonomy</b> in the patient-doctor-relationship. Conclusion: Predictors for the desire <b>for</b> <b>autonomy</b> in the patient-doctor-interaction in predominantly young attendees of an inner-city emergency department were gender and school education. There was no association between smoking variables and the desire <b>for</b> <b>autonomy</b> in the patient-doctor-relationship. Within the study population we identified - independently from already known variables like sex or school education – two clinically distinct subpopulations concerning the desire <b>for</b> <b>autonomy</b> in the patient-doctor-relationship. Consideration of the individual desire <b>for</b> <b>autonomy</b> in the patient-doctor-relationship in this specific population may lead to more efficient tobacco control interventions in this particular setting...|$|R
40|$|In the mixed-motive dyad of the headquarters-subsidiary relationship, {{subsidiaries}} often request more autonomy than headquarters concede. To {{shed light}} on subsidiaries' desire <b>for</b> <b>autonomy,</b> the authors investigate its consequences and determinants by drawing on reactance theory to develop an integrative framework focusing on marketing decision making in subsidiaries. The authors empirically test this framework with 133 international headquarters-subsidiary dyads from 29 countries. The findings show that a subsidiary's desire <b>for</b> <b>autonomy</b> can significantly impair the headquarters-subsidiary relationship. While the centralization and importance of marketing decision making can amplify this harmful desire <b>for</b> <b>autonomy,</b> the headquarters' competence in marketing decision making can reduce this desire. Thus, to minimize subsidiaries' desire <b>for</b> <b>autonomy,</b> headquarters should credibly display high competence while allowing subsidiaries to participate in decision making whenever possible. ...|$|R

The party began to organize itself in the Ottoman Empire in the early 1890s and held its first major meeting in Tiflis, Russian Empire, in 1892. At that meeting, the party adopted a decentralized modus operandi according to which the chapters in different countries were allowed to plan and implement policies in tune with their local political atmosphere.

A 1993 strike by miners in the region called for a federal Ukraine and economic <b>autonomy</b> <b>for</b> Donbass. This was followed by a 1994 consultative referendum on various constitutional questions in Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts, held concurrently with the first parliamentary elections in independent Ukraine. These questions included whether Russian should be enshrined as an official language of Ukraine, whether Russian should be the language of administration in Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts, whether Ukraine should federalise, and whether Ukraine should have closer ties with the Commonwealth of Independent States. Close to 90% of voters voted in favour of these propositions. None of them were adopted: Ukraine remained a unitary state, Ukrainian was retained as the sole official language, and the Donbass gained no autonomy.|$|E

He nevertheless agreed to a referendum on regional autonomy, held in July 2006; the four eastern departments voted in favor of autonomy, but Bolivia as a whole voted against it by 57.6%. In September, autonomy activists launched strikes and blockades across eastern Bolivia, resulting in violent clashes with MAS activists. In January 2007, clashes in Cochabamba between activist groups led to fatalities, with Morales' government sending in troops to maintain the peace.

5|$|Exercising its {{sovereignty}} {{once again on}} 29 October 1918, the Sabor decided on independence from Austria–Hungary and formation of the State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs. The council of the newly established state voted to form the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes; however, the Sabor never confirmed that decision. The 1921 constitution defining the new kingdom as a unitary state, and the abolition of historical administrative divisions, effectively ended Croatian <b>autonomy</b> <b>for</b> {{the time and the}} Sabor did not convene until the 1940s. The Cvetković–Maček Agreement of August 1939 established the autonomous Province of Croatia, or Banovina of Croatia, in which the Yugoslav government retained control of defence, internal security, foreign affairs, trade, and transport, while other matters were left to the Croatian Sabor and a crown-appointed ban (Viceroy or governor). Before any elections were held, the establishment was made obsolete with the beginning of World War II and the establishment of the Independent State of Croatia which banned all political opposition. In 1942, three sessions of an unelected Sabor were held in the Independent State of Croatia; these were held between 23 February and 28 December 1942, when it was formally dissolved. The assembly had no real power as the state was under the direct rule of (the fascist) Ante Pavelić.|$|E
5|$|For six years, Tamar was a co-ruler {{with her}} father upon whose death, in 1184, Tamar {{continued}} as the sole monarch and was crowned a second time at the Gelati cathedral near Kutaisi, western Georgia. She inherited a relatively strong kingdom, but the centrifugal tendencies fostered by the great nobles were far from being quelled. There was considerable opposition to Tamar's succession; this was sparked by a reaction against the repressive policies of her father and encouraged by the new sovereign's other perceived weakness, her sex. As Georgia had never previously had a female ruler, {{a part of the}} aristocracy questioned Tamar's legitimacy, while others tried to exploit her youth and supposed weakness to assert greater <b>autonomy</b> <b>for</b> themselves. The energetic involvement of Tamar's influential aunt Rusudan and the Georgian Catholicos-Patriarch Michael IV Mirianisdze was crucial for legitimizing Tamar's succession to the throne. However, the young queen was forced into making significant concessions to the aristocracy. She had to reward the Catholicos-Patriarch Michael's support by making him a chancellor, thus placing him at the top of both the clerical and secular hierarchies.|$|E
