50|$|Each line is {{identified}} by a name, an <b>alphanumeric</b> <b>index</b> (usually consisting {{of just a}} number) and a colour. The colour assigned to each line for display on maps and signs is its colloquial identifier, except for the nondescript greens and blues assigned to the Kakhovskaya, the Zamoskvoretskaya, the Lyublinsko-Dmitrovskaya, and Butovskaya Lines (route 11, 2, 10, and 12).The upcoming station is announced by a male voice on inbound trains to the city center (on the Circle line, the clockwise trains) and by a female voice on outbound trains (counter-clockwise trains on the Circle line).|$|E
40|$|Efficient and {{accurate}} information retrieval {{is a key}} issue in image databases. Since image databases use image features for retrieval, traditional <b>alphanumeric</b> <b>indexing</b> methods are not particularly suitable for content-based retrieval. Therefore, new indexing methods must be designed and implemented specifically for image retrieval. In this paper, we propose to use competitive learning clustering algorithm to produce an indexing structure for Montage, which is an image database supporting content-based retrieval using color, texture, sketch, and shape for Hong Kong's fashion, textile, and clothing industry. Competitive learning is a stochastic and efficient clustering method which provides good cluster center approximation for image database indexing. Using synthetic data, we demonstrate the Recall and Precision performance of nearest neighbor feature retrieval based on the indexing structure generated by competitive learning clustering and show that the algorithm works well. 1 Introd [...] ...|$|R
40|$|Efficient and {{accurate}} information retrieval {{is one of}} the main issues in image databases. Since traditional <b>alphanumeric</b> <b>indexing</b> methods are not particularly suitable for image database indexing, new indexing methods are designed specially for image retrieval. In this paper, we are going to discuss four partitioning methods: VP-tree, k-means, Competitive Learning (CL), and Rival PenalizedCompetitive Learning (RPCL) for image database indexing. Our aim is to evaluate and compare the performances of these methods for information retrieval in image database based on the performance measurements: Recall, Precision, and Speed. From the result of some performance experiments, it is concluded that RPCL followed by CL are the most appropriate to be used for image retrieval among these four methods. 1 Introduction Efficient {{and accurate}} information retrieval is a key issue in image databases. Since image databases use image contents such as color, texture, sketch, and shape for retr [...] ...|$|R
40|$|DOI: 10. 1300 /J 103 v 19 n 01 _ 02 The article {{examines}} the weaknesses and strengths of the economics database, EconLit. Comparison is made with other social science databases with especial emphasis on the <b>alphanumeric</b> classification and <b>indexing</b> system unique to EconLit. The general conclusion is that, despite the high value of its information content, EconLit would benefit by adhering closer to the indexing practices of other mainline social science databases...|$|R
40|$|A {{large number}} of coastal {{aquifers}} worldwide are impacted by seawater intrusion. A major aim of European Directives 2000 / 60 /EC and 2006 / 118 /EC is to achieve good ecological status in groundwater bodies, including coastal aquifers. To this goal, information is needed about the current state of, and changes over time in, individual aquifers. This information {{can be obtained by}} applying methods that determine the status of aquifers in an uncomplicated manner. Methods for this type of assessment must comply with three essential criteria. First, calculation of the index must be straightforward and should be based on easy-to-obtain or commonly available data. Next, the index should be able to highlight important characteristics in understandable terms. Finally, the results should be objective and should be expressed {{in such a way that}} different time periods and different aquifers can be compared. In this paper we describe the development of a method to characterize seawater intrusion that meets these criteria and is based on four basic parameters: surface area, intensity, temporality, and evolution. Each parameter is determined by specific calculations derived from the groundwater chloride concentrations. Results are specified as a numerical <b>index</b> and an <b>alphanumeric</b> code. This <b>index,</b> known as SITE, has been applied to four Mediterranean coastal aquifers. The standardized results allowed us to discriminate between, and objectively compare the status of these groundwater bodies. Further, this index will make it possible to prioritize management actions and evaluate the effectiveness of these actions over time...|$|R
