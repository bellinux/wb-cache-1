There are different methods available to computing systems to ensure a proper authentication of a user. <b>Authentication</b> <b>mechanisms</b> can use simple user-generated passwords to complicated combinations of passwords and physical characteristics of the user (i. e., voice recognition device, retina scanner, signature recognition device, etc.). This thesis looks at the various <b>authentication</b> <b>mechanisms</b> available to a security manager. It describes how different <b>authentication</b> <b>mechanisms</b> operate and {{the advantages and disadvantages}} associated with each mechanism.
