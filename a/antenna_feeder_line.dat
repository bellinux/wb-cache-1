2500|$|After a {{supporter}} purchased for McIntire a World War II vintage wooden-hulled Navy minesweeper named Oceanic (which McIntire renamed Columbus), {{he tried to}} broadcast outside the three-mile limit near Cape May, calling the floating station [...] "Radio Free America." [...] The station began broadcasting at 12:22 PM Eastern Time on September 19, 1973, but was only on the air for ten hours—the ship began to smoke from {{the heat of the}} <b>antenna</b> <b>feeder</b> <b>line,</b> and the signal interfered with that of radio station WHLW in Lakewood, New Jersey which broadcast on a neighboring frequency of 1170kHz. [...] Nevertheless, the notion of a Christian pirate radio station off the United States caught the attention of the media. [...] "I became a very famous man out of that," [...] McIntire later recalled, [...] "People stood along the coast to see me. [...] It was a crazy thing to do, but it was dramatic." ...|$|E
40|$|A new {{theoretical}} {{approach to the}} problem of the symmetrical linear antenna driven by a two-wire line is presented. Then symmetrical linear <b>antenna</b> and the <b>feeder</b> <b>line</b> are treated as a unique boundary-value problem leading to a system of two simultaneous integral equations containing antenna and line currents as unknown sub-integral functions. The integral equations are approximately solved by the so-called point-matching method. Due to the mutual coupling between the antenna and the line, a new conveniently defined apparent driving-point admittance is to be introduced. The method is applied on several types of linear antennas: Centre driven symmetrical dipole antenna, Centre-driven V-antenna, Cage antenna, H-antenna and System of two parallel non-staggered dipoles antennas, positioned in the air over semi-conducting ground. Then theoretical results for admittances were compared with the experiments and remarkably good overall agreement has been found. On the contrary, a comparison with the corresponding theoretical results obtained with the idealized delta-function generator revealed remarkable discrepancies...|$|R

40|$|The {{time between}} Failures {{distribution}} observed on four selected <b>feeder</b> <b>lines</b> {{in the distribution}} system of Southwestern Nigeria was investigated in this study. Starting with data gathered on the selected <b>feeder</b> <b>lines,</b> the graphical representation of the time between failure distributions on each of them was presented. Least square plot, Bartlet test and Maximum Likelihood estimator technique were used to establish that the distributions were exponential. The distribution parameter, failure rate denoted by, λ, obtained from the least square plot of the <b>feeder</b> <b>lines</b> are 0. 0054 f/h, 0. 0071 f/h, 0. 0177 f/h and 0. 026 f/h.
