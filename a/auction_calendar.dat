40|$|We {{examine the}} returns to UK {{government}} bonds before, during {{and between the}} phases of quantitative easing to identify the side effects for the market itself. We show that the onset of QE led to a sustained reduction in the costs of trading and removed some return regularities. However, controlling {{for a wide range}} of market activity, including issuance and QE announcements, we find evidence that investors could have earned excess returns after costs by trading in response to the purchase <b>auction</b> <b>calendar.</b> Drawing on economic theory, we explore the implications of these findings for both the efficiency of the market and the costs of government debt management in both the short and long run...|$|E
40|$|On April 30, 2000, Christie’s Hong Kong {{mounted a}} sale {{designated}} the Imperial Sale. The Sale {{was the latest}} in an annual event in the <b>auction</b> <b>calendar</b> ﬁrst established in 1996. 1 The Imperial Sale offered, as the name implies, Chinese works of art of imperial quality with a suggested if not always conﬁrmed imperial provenance. Back in 1996, the Catalogue’s Introduction {{made clear that the}} contents of the sale were “... devoted entirely to Imperial works of art originating from the Imperial palaces... ” and included objects provenanced to the so-called Old Summer Palace of Yuanmingyuan. 2 Subsequent annual Imperial Sales in Hong Kong followed a similar pattern. In 2000, the Sale was codenamed “Yuanmingyuan” and included two of the 12 zodiac heads (the monkey and the ox), which had been cast in bronze for the fountain situated in front of the Haiyantang (Hall of Calm Seas) within the Xiyanglou (Western palace area) within the Yuanmingyuan (see Tythacott, Chapter 1 and Hevia, Chapter 2). 3 For the ﬁrst time the Sale provoked a reaction from the Chinese Government, which accused Christie’s of taking advantage of Hong Kong’s “one country, two systems” designation and demanded that the objects be withdrawn from sale. The auction house made clear that legal title was not in doubt and the sale proceeded. The two heads (along with other alleged Yuanmingyuan objects sold shortly afterwards by Sotheby’s Hong Kong, including another bronze head, the tiger), were purchased by the China Poly Group, a former commercial wing of the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) and now sit in the Poly Art Museum in Beijing. ...|$|E

40|$|Online auctions {{have been}} the subject of many {{empirical}} research efforts in the fields of economics and information systems. These research efforts are often based on analyzing data from Web sites such as eBay. com which provide public information about sequences of bids in closed auctions, typically in the form of tables on HTML pages. The existing literature on online auctions focuses on tools like summary statistics and more formal statistical methods such as regression models. However, there is a clear void in this growing body of literature in developing appropriate visualization tools. This is quite surprising, given that the sheer amount of data that can be found on sites such as eBay. com is overwhelming and can often not be displayed informatively using standard statistical graphics. In this article we introduce graphical methods for visualizing online auction data in ways that are informative and relevant to the types of research questions that are of interest. We start by using profile plots that reveal aspects of an auction such as bid values, bidding intensity, and bidder strategies. We then introduce the concept of statistical zooming (STAT-zoom) which can scale up to be used for visualizing large amounts of auctions. STAT-zoom adds the capability of looking at data summaries at various time scales interactively. Finally, we develop <b>auction</b> <b>calendars</b> and <b>auction</b> scene visualizations for viewing a set of many concurrent auctions. The different visualization methods are demonstrated using data on multiple auctions collected from eBay. com. Key Words: Bid data; eBay. com; Profile plots; STAT-zoom. 1...|$|R
