40|$|The {{increasing}} {{importance of}} the carbon sequestration issue calls the researchers to investigate if the <b>agri-environmental</b> <b>support</b> (AES) to extensive mountain grazing granted under Regulations 2078 / 92, 1257 / 99 and 1698 / 2005 is still efficient. AES {{may have contributed to}} the maintenance of low carbon stocks in extensive grazing areas, which might otherwise have been abandoned and revegetated by species that assist carbon sequestration. We evaluate benefits and costs of supporting the maintenance of pastureland through cattle grazing in an Italian Alpine pasture for 2004. We focus on three non-commodity outputs of Alpine grazing –landscape-recreation amenities, carbon sequestration and contribution to economic vitality of the area- and three groups of agents: visitors, local community and EU households. The efficiency of supporting mountain grazing is demonstrated by a net benefit of euro 228, 613. Landscape-recreational benefits are the key variable, as their value (euro 205, 377) is large enough to justify the grazing activity and the related support. The value of carbon sequestration achievable with reforestation (euro 62, 491) could not compensate the loss in tourism benefits. Net beneficiaries of the agri-environmental policy are not the farmers but the visitors and the local community. Transforming of the intangible goods (both landscape-recreational amenities and carbon sequestration) into tangible ones would favour the local community. The overall convenience of supporting the maintenance of Alpine pastureland through cattle grazing depends on the number and the types of benefits and costs we consider. When a complete evaluation of all the benefit and cost flow is impossible or when an aspect, previously considered as irrelevant, suddenly increases its importance (such in the case of carbon sequestration), an approach inspired by the precautionary principle is absolutely necessary and wise. <b>agri-environmental</b> <b>support,</b> mountain grazing, carbon sequestration, Environmental Economics and Policy,...|$|E

Futhermore, the study provides a more detailed look on the French CTE (Contral Territorial d'Exploitation) system, which represents one of the pioneer application within the Common Agricultural Policy in the field of the provision of public goods through voluntary agreements. The study defines the various types of public goods produced in agriculture in the joint production process, illuminates problems that are encountered in the social decision-making process related to public goods, offers an insight into the difficulties faced in the monetary valuation of public goods, and gives a brief introduction concerning alterative public measures and control instruments to promote the provision of the public goods. The study also explains the reasoning behind the use of voluntary agreements, provides a more detailed look into the principalagent framework and the related key concepts of information economics, and reviews resolutions available to the participation and incentive problems inherent in voluntry agreement schemes. It is not possible to prove unambiguously that voluntary agreement function more efficiently than other policy measures in the provision of agriculture related public goods. However, there is evidence that properly designed voluntary agreements can reduce information asymmetry between a principal (government) and an agent (farmer), and thus advance socially desirable production of public goods in agriculture. The provision of agriculture related public goods i agriculture. The provision of agriculture related public goods is site-specific and may even depend on characteristics of an individual farm. In these circumstances government authorities need a policy instrument which can be tailored and targeted to meet varying needs.

The exercise evaluates the effect of buffer zone width on reducing phosphorus losses using the model ICECREAM DB and Swedish data. The study then analyzes how the parameters that influence the effectiveness of different widths may impact the cost-effectiveness of policy alternatives. What emerges is that the width of a buffer might not be that influential as other site conditions when looking at the cost-efficiency in reducing the load of phosphorous from agricultural fields. Eventually, a more down-scaled and differentiated payment scheme for buffer zones (of different designs) based on more localized and easy-to-establish parameters (such as climate and soil type, but also the load of P and reduction targets) would produce a more cost-effective approach...|$|E

This study is an attempt to estimate and aggregate the costs of the GAEPS. The main costs at the farm level consist of investments to manure and silage storage, crop losses due to reduced use of nitrogen and phosphorus fertilisers, and landscape management. Other major sources of additional costs are the plant cover criterion, regular soil fertility testing, and nutrient analyses of manure. Filter strips, testing of pesticide sprayers, and making an environmental management plan for the farm are also cost-creating activities. According to the calculations, the total cost of the adaptation of the GAEPS are ca. FIM 850 million annually. This corresponds to the a priori cost estimates that were made at the planning stage of the GAEPS.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this article is to {{describe}} manifestations and consequences of the impact of the environmental policy of the European Union on selected tools of the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP). The author used descriptive analysis of the EU strategic documents related to both policies. The descriptive analysis also refers to the accompanying legislation and to factual material based on statistical data on the implementation of the CAP instruments shaped under the influence of environmental policy. Other data shows the changes in the impact of agriculture on environment. The main mechanism of the impact of environmental policy on the CAP is based on the principle of integration of environmental policies with sectoral policies. It was reinforced in subsequent EU environment action programmes. Thanks to the implementation of that principle, the environmental implications were reflected in the changes of CAP. Special attention has been paid to the latest solutions: seventh EU environmental action programme and climate and energy package. They have affected both the development of an environmental policy and its relations with the CAP. As a result, the EU modified the instruments of I and II pillar (direct payments, <b>agri-environmental</b> programmes, <b>support</b> for organic farming) in such a way as to have a more beneficial impact on the environment. This also applies to the standards directly applicable to farmers (cross-compliance).

European rural policy faces economic, environmental and demographic challenges. Its recent development has shifted emphasis towards <b>agri-environmental</b> schemes and <b>support</b> for organic farming, refinement of structural funding programmes, and Community Initiatives such as LEADER. At the same time, a transformation and refinement in consumer demand for food is leading to greater market emphasis on the health, environmental conservation and ethical qualities of products.

This paper presents a framework for the study of organic marketing initiatives (OMIs), their interaction with the communities and overall environment of the regions in which they are located, with the aim of improving the capacity of organic agriculture to generate positive social, economic and environmental effects on rural development, which are of particular policy relevance in the peripheral, disadvantaged regions of Europe. ...|$|R

The {{components of the}} framework are to: (1) determine the private, i. e. farmers’, and public benefits associated to agro-landscapes, consisting of an agricultural land-use system, according to its performance for several market and non-market functions. Market forces determine the market benefits and preferences of society the non-market benefits; (2) explore and select potential sustainable agro-landscapes based on {{the private and public}} benefits associated with possible land-use alternatives; (3) define efficient public policy mechanisms for improving social net benefit of agro-landscapes. The framework is illustrated with a case study in a small dairy farming dominated agro-landscape in The Netherlands, with gross margin, landscape quality, nature value and environmental health as the analysed ecosystem functions. Alternative landscapes consisting of hedgerow configurations and grassland management practices were explored, yielding a set of alternatives representing the solution space in terms of change in private and public benefits.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{examines the}} economic efficiency of nutrient abatement measures in agriculture, {{focusing on the}} case of Finland. The thesis consists of an introductory article and four separate studies, which consider the nutrient abatement problem from different angles. Nutrient abatement was put on the environmental policy agenda decades ago because of the adverse impacts of eutrophication in surface waters, and remains there as water quality, in Europe and elsewhere, has not reached satisfactory levels. In particular, the Water Framework Directive of the European Union requires the member states to reach a good surface water status. In Finland, agriculture accounts for a major share of nutrient loads and could {{play an important role in}} achieving the water quality targets. However, the current environmental policy, relying on subsidies paid to farmers, has not met the abatement targets set for agriculture. As the European farm subsidy regime is shifting, new environmental policies could be adopted. For identifying the policies that would reach water protection targets, more information on costs-efficient measures is required. The objective of this dissertation is to estimate nutrient abatement costs in agriculture and to rank the measures in terms of cost-efficiency. The focus is on the measures that have been considered in the <b>agri-environmental</b> <b>support</b> scheme. The dissertation relies on empirical numerical models that are based on microeconomic theory. Numerical representative farm models were developed for dairy and crop production. Abatement costs were found to fluctuate, depending on the target abatement levels, environmental and market conditions as well as production structure of agriculture. It is argued that reaching the national abatement targets, set by the government for 2015, is unlikely; extending the measures currently common in Finland is insufficient. For such a high abatement targets, policies should aim at increasing the share of green fallow, which can be effective in cutting down both nitrogen and phosphorus loads and increases biodiversity.

40|$|The {{results of}} the {{evaluation}} of the Finnish National Biodiversity Action Plan 1997 - 2005 indicate clear changes towards better consideration of biodiversity in the routines and policies of many sectors of the administration and economy. There are many indications that actors across society have recognized the need to safeguard biodiversity and have begun to adjust their practices accordingly. Several concrete measures have been undertaken in forests, agricultural habitats and in other habitats significantly affected by human activities. Biodiversity research has expanded significantly and the knowledge of Finland´s biological diversity has increased. In general, the Action Plan has supported public discussion of the need to safeguard biodiversity and this discussion has resulted in more positive attitudes towards nature conservation. So far, however, the implemented measures have not been sufficiently numerous or efficient to stop the depletion of original biological diversity. Many habitats remain far from their original state. More species will become endangered in the immediate future unless more effective and far-reaching measuresare taken. The objective of the EU to halt the decline of biodiversity by 2010 will not be achieved given the current development. Although the deterioration in biodiversity may have slowed down in several cases, many economic activities continue to {{have a negative impact on}} biodiversity. The scale of these activities is normally greater than that of the measures taken to manage and restore biodiversity. The evaluation focused on detecting changes in the administration of key sectors, analysing the recent development of biodiversity and observing interlinkages between these two. The analysis of administrative measures was based on interviews and on examining policy documents, reports and other relevant literature. The analysis covered changes in the administration of nature conservation, forestry,  agriculture, land use and regional and development cooperation. The analysis of the development of biodiversity was based on employing 75 pressure, state, impact and response indicators. There were 5 to 15 indicators for each of the nine major habitat types of Finland. Three separate case studies were made to provide further insights into some key issues: 1) A GISanalysis was made of the development of land use patterns in North Karelia and south-west Finland between 1990 and 2000, 2) two scenarios on the development of forest structure in North Karelia until 2050 were developed using a special MELA-model and 3) the cost-effectiveness of the <b>agri-environmental</b> <b>support</b> scheme was examined by comparing different land allocation choices and their effects on biodiversity on an average farm in southern Finland.

In this paper we investigate whether the conversion subsidy schemes may attract ‘subsidy-hunters’ who are not, in general, the most efficient farmers.

In this paper, we estimate the private value to farmers of agrobiodiversity in home gardens.

We first consider the second best where the regulator is able to observe all individuals decisions in terms of inputs and individual profit, but not the individual farming labor supply. We characterized the generalized transfer in function of the desire to redistribute and the underlying characteristics of the production process. In a second step, we assume that the regulator has only information on aggregate consumption of inputs and hence can only tax/subsidy linearly inputs and output. However, because the accounting profit remains observable, a non linear transfer of profit is still part of the optimal policy.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{contribute}} further insights into individuals' agri-environmental attitudes. In particular, the empirical analysis focuses on how citizens think agri-environmental property rights should be assigned. This has been done by surveying how individuals consider the environmental policy should promote the implementation of a group of agri-environmental measures, allowing us to examine the determinants of individuals' opinions about this matter. Results indicate that higher level of income and education support the implementation of obligatory agri-environmental measures with no financial support (property rights should rest on society) except for measures to improve public access to land for leisure activities and ecological farming which are seen more of the voluntary kind (property rights should rest on farmers). Additionally, rural residency has strong significant effect on agri-environmental attitudes as rural residents are more likely to support the implementation of voluntary (with/without financial <b>support)</b> <b>agri-environmental</b> measures.

Weeds and nitrogen deficiency are considered to be the most serious threat inducing lowest grain yield under organic production. The choice of cultivar, green manure, fertilization and intercropping legumes – grain or forage – are efficient ways to obtain high grain quality and quantity. The economic viability of wheat production in Europe is also affected by subsidies from European Union <b>agri-environmental</b> programs. <b>Support</b> has been granted to organic farming since the beginning of the 1990 s. Direct payments from European regulation combined with premium prices paid by consumers had compensated the lowest crop production. In the European Union, the current cycle of the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) is due to end in 2013. Discussions are now under way to support the policy for the period 2014 – 2020. With the increasing consumer awareness of their food, the growth of the organic sector may continue in the near future. However, financial crisis in some countries may lead to stagnation or even decline of consumer demand. The development of the organic grain sector is actually confronted to others challenges as quality and safety value. Technological ways of milling and baking may also improve baking quality and nutritional value of organic flour, as well as it prevents mycotoxin contamination. For instance, milling process strongly influences flour characteristics. Stone milling improves nutritive value when characteristics remain very stable independently of the milling yield while flour characteristics from roller milling appear very susceptible to the milling yield. The economic efficiency of the bread wheat sector is also influences by the existence of an adequate marketing structure answering consumers’ requirements.

A key aspect of collaborative approaches is the potential to help stakeholders share and integrate expert science and local knowledge with their beliefs and values. This process creates a vernacular knowledge {{that is necessary to}} address the quasi-scientific characteristics of complex environmental problems. Stakeholder networks have an important role in collaborative processes, and the creation and sharing of knowledge. The manner in which stakeholder networks form, function, and contribute to the creation and sharing of knowledge, both internally and externally, is not well understood from both a theoretical and empirical perspective. The purpose of this research is to provide insight concerning this gap in the literature by addressing three research objectives: (1) to develop a conceptual framework for evaluating the creation and sharing of vernacular knowledge by a stakeholder network within collaborative problem-solving processes; (2) to use the conceptual framework to evaluate the contribution of stakeholder networks to the creation and sharing of vernacular knowledge in an actual example of a collaborative problem-solving processes; and (3) to develop recommendations for the design of collaborative problem-solving processes in order to facilitate the creation and sharing of vernacular knowledge using stakeholder networks. A case study was used to evaluate a multi-stakeholder problem-solving process that has involved stakeholder network representatives at the watershed and provincial scales in Ontario, Canada. This was undertaken through an extensive literature review, and the analysis of data collected through participant observation, survey questionnaire, and a review of publicly available documents using a mixed methods research approach. The research focused on the evaluation of the formation and function of an agri-environmental network composed of representatives from key provincial farm organizations and the provincial agricultural ministry. This research seeks to provide insight concerning the role of stakeholder networks in the creation and sharing of vernacular knowledge within collaborative problem-solving processes, and provide insights for both theoretical and practical applications of collaborative approaches to problem-solving. This addresses questions in the literature regarding the effectiveness of stakeholder networks to contribute knowledge to problem-solving within forums that are intended to be collaborative in nature, but may also include elements of a regulatory approach. Further, this <b>agri-environmental</b> network has <b>supported</b> the development and function of a diverse group of farm community representatives involved in a prescribed environmental problem-solving process. The research demonstrates that this network has been effective in contributing to the creation and sharing of vernacular knowledge in a coordinated fashion at the local and provincial scale. This responds to questions in the literature concerning how stakeholder networks communicate and cooperate across different scales and administrative, physiographic and political boundaries. The study also provides recommendations for practice concerning the selection of community representatives, the creation of vernacular knowledge, and the promotion of stakeholder network involvement as part of collaborative approaches to problem-solving. Although the research results are situated in an Ontario context, {{the results of the study}} can be applied in other jurisdictions where stakeholder networks exist or may emerge to participate in collaborative approaches to environmental problem-solving...|$|R

This {{dissertation}} {{on the environmental}} liability of agriculture first provides information about the circumstances and specific nature of the agriculture as an occupation and as elementary production, {{as well as its}} connection to certain basic human rights, and generally looks at rural law and environmental law and their intertwined relationship in current agricultural policy in addition to the relationship between agri-environmental liabilities and property rights. The study then concentrates on the legislative environmental directing of agricultural activities especially within cultivation and the various relevant principles represented in the agri-environmental sector of law. The last part is comprised of the main results of the study with some de lege ferenda proposals for addressing obvious shortcomings in the efficiency of current agri-environmental legislation. The dissertation adopts a broad concept of agricultural environmental liability that includes both compulsory and voluntary based legal obligations to prevent and minimize pollution, and to compensate for environmental damage or restore contaminated or polluted environments. Elements of the environment subjected to pollution include surface and ground water and soil, as well as air and even climate. Agricultural activities causing pollution are mainly fertilizing, manure spreading and storage, cattle pasturing and the use of pesticides. For watercourses it is mostly a diffuse type of pollution, appearing as eutrophication, and for ground water and soil it is usually point source pollution and contamination. Environmental protection has since 1980 s and 1990 s significantly modified the Common Agricultural Popolicy (CAP) of the EU and its legislation. The CAP was strongly shaped by the Uruguay Round with its WTO Agricultural Agreement, and is still {{under the influence of the}} prolonged Doha Round, which aims to renegotiate that agreement for the further liberalization of trade. The latest reform of the CAP created the Single Payment System (SPS) by Council Regulation (EC) 1782 / 2003, with the aim of decoupling the CAP supports from production. The SPS includes additional aid conditions the purpose of which are to ensure that fields are kept in good condition with regard to the environment and further cultivation. In addition, special <b>agri-environmental</b> <b>supports</b> – also of a voluntary nature, though based on legislation – have alongside LFA aid and special national support allowed to Finland after joining the EU in 1995, played a central role in the national adaptation to the CAP. The compulsory agri-environmental legislation, based on the targets and principles of article 174 of the EC Treaty, is mainly comprised of the measures of Directive 91 / 676 /EEC that concerns the protection of waters against pollution caused by nitrates from agricultural sources. It is implemented nowadays in pursuance to the Environmental Protection Act (86 / 2000, EPA) by Government Decree 931 / 2000, which stipulates that the actions in it, including instructions for good agricultural practices, refer to the Nitrate Directive´s action programme. The programme is being put into effect throughout the country. Finland thus chose to free itself from the obligation to identify specific vulnerable zones in accordance with article 3 (5) article of the directive. The provisions of the Nitrate Decree concern the volume and other conditions for storage of animal manure, and the use of manure and nitrogen fertilizers having seasonal, areal and quantitative restrictions. For instance, animal manure may be applied on a field as fertilizer equivalent to a maximum of 170 kg/ha/year of nitrogen. The use of maximum amounts of nitrogen on fields as fertilizer, contained in mineral fertilizer, animal manure and organic fertilizers, is allowed, for example, as follows: for grassland and pasture, silage and horticultural plants, 250 kg of nitrogen/ha/year (highest); for winter cereals, up to 200 kg of nitrogen/ha/year, of which normally 30 kg are used in the autumn and 170 kg in the spring; and for spring cereals, sugar beet, oilseed crops and other crops, up to 170 kg /ha/year. In addition, Annex 3 of the decree makes some special recommendations on procedures related to the use of animal manure. The Nitrate Directive is now connected to the water policy framework Directive 2000 / 60 /EC (with its planning system and action programmes) which is implemented mainly by the Act on Arrangement of Water Management (1299 / 2004). This system does not hinder the developing and tightening of the rules of the nitrate legislation also separately, if needed. The role of private law measures is restricted in the agricultural sector mainly to the Act of Compensation for Environmental Damage (737 / 1994) and the Adjoining Properties Act (26 / 1920). Both of these are based on objective liability. The principles in the Environmental Protection Act (86 / 2000) are not understood quite in the same way as the environmental principles in article 174 (2) of the treaty. This particularly concerns the principle of caution and care in section 4. 1. 2 of the act compared to the precautionary principle of the treaty with its heavier weight and larger area of application, as conventionally interpreted in the European Court of Justice. Environmental principles, in any case, work very much towards common goals. From a systematic point of view it would be reasonable in Finnish law to combine the principle of prevention together with that principle of caution and care into a larger main principle, a “principle of prevention and precaution”, for instance. The results from agri-environmental measures in Finland have been insufficient. Although the use of nitrogen fertilizing has generally decreased – the average balance of nitrogen in fields been reduced from 80 kg to 50 kg per hectare and the nitrogen flow potential for watercourses has decreased especially in eastern and middle Finland – the least and most insufficient decrease has occured in the coastal areas, where in many rivers and especially in the Archipelago Sea and Gulf of Finland no reductions in the nitrogen load has been found. The reason is due to national circumstances, the overly high maximum amounts of nitrogen fertilizing allowed in the Nitrate Decree, actually already in the Nitrate Directive, and the fact that Finland by choosing to establish and apply the action programme relating to article 5 of the directive throughout its national territory exempted itself from the obligation to identify specific vulnerable zones. Additionally, the Nitrate Directive and Decree do not regulate or directly affect the use of phosphorous fertilizers. Therefore, reaching more concrete results in the protection of watercourses against eutrophication caused by agriculture is left to be managed by the agri-environmental aid scheme, which covers over 90 per cent of all active farms in Finland but has not in this respect been effective enough. Neither the polluter pay- principle and the precautionary principle nor the principle of prevention have sufficiently materialized for Finnish farming in terms of the protection of surface waters. Instead of the polluter pays principle prevails, through the scheme of agri-environmental aid the so-called provider gets principle. On the other hand, the ground water and soil situation is good, thanks to the ground water pollution and soil contamination prohibitions in section 7 and 8 of the EPA, as well as the prohibitions, warnings and measures prescribed for the use of plant protection and bioside products in accordance with the harmonized legislation in these areas. Still, a lack of harmony is noticeable between environmental aid payed on the basis of the “agreements for cultivation of ground water areas” and the groundwater pollution prohibition in the EPA. The recommendations forming part of the Nitrate Decrees regulations should be transformed into regulations. Limits for maximum nitrogen fertilization should be lowered in watercourse zones especially vulnerable to pollution, as well as to those parts of the country from which the heaviest loads still issue into the Archipelago Sea and Gulf of Finland. Conditions for all agri-environmental aid should include more onerous conditions for phosphorous fertilization. The aid should also be based more on agreements tailored and negotiated to fit the activities and special characteristics of each farm. There are also grounds for lowering the limits of livestock installations requiring environmental permits for their establishment or enlargement, and for placing on these permits – in accordance with the principle that damage should as a priority be rectified at the source, and to enhance agricultural structure – the condition of having in one´s possession, by ownership or long-term lease, sufficient field area for the application of manure near enough to the installation. One possible economical measure to alleviate the diffuse pollution into waters could be a payment system that would be based on the arable land area under active cultivation and each farm´s number of livestock and thus on the farm´s estimated yearly surplus balance of nitrogen and phosphorous fertilization. In general, it would be reasonable in terms of achieving a more genuine application of the polluter pays principle and also the principles of prevention and precaution to put more weight on using the compulsory legal measures and additional conditions in the CAP as well as national agri-aid instead of special agri-environmental aid. The trend of rising cereal prices, as well as possible increasing demand for other agricultural products, could help in the adoption of these measures. Agri-environmental aids should in the long run be mainly used temporarily and as an incentive during transitional periods for the implementation and adaptation of new and stricter legal environmental obligations...|$|R
