5|$|Bowling {{a mixture}} of medium pace and his new style of off spin, Macaulay played 27 matches in 1921. After taking wickets {{steadily}} {{at the start of}} the season, in his fourth game he took six wickets for ten runs as Warwickshire were bowled out for 72. Four more wickets in the second innings gave Yorkshire <b>a</b> <b>big</b> <b>victory</b> and Macaulay had match figures of ten wickets for 65 runs, the first time he had taken ten wickets in a match. Macaulay then came to wider public attention by taking six wickets for three runs to bowl out Derbyshire for 23 runs. He later took ten wickets in the match against Surrey in a losing cause, and in total that season he took 101 first-class wickets at an average of 17.33, placing him third in the Yorkshire bowling averages. With the bat, he scored 457 runs at an average of 22.59, surprising commentators with his ability. This included a maiden first-class century against Nottinghamshire. His innings of 125 not out took Yorkshire from 211 for seven wickets when he came in to bat (228 for eight soon after) to a total of 438 for nine declared, a lead of 264; Yorkshire went on to a comfortable win. His overall success in the season meant that his place in the team was secure.|$|E
25|$|He {{was again}} called {{up for the}} Australian team prior to Australia's tour of Sri Lanka in 2015. Despite his {{presence}} in the team as consultant, Australia couldn't win {{any of the three}} Test matches, and lost the series 3–0. The Murali's acceptance of the rival side made a huge controversy throughout the country and Sri Lanka Cricket and Muralitharan have traded caustic verbal blows following an altercation between Murali and the Sri Lanka team manager. The Head of SLC Thilanga Sumathipala warned Muralitharan for attempting to coach the Australian team, the team which gave more pressure to Muralitharan in the past due to his bowling actions.Muralitharan also said that the team which was totally against him now called him to coach them to play against Sri Lanka was <b>a</b> <b>big</b> <b>victory</b> in his career.|$|E
25|$|Sussex {{recorded}} <b>a</b> <b>big</b> <b>victory</b> at Hove, smacking the Bangladeshi bowlers at will before bowling {{them out}} twice for a pittance, {{which did not}} exactly give the Bangladeshis confidence {{a week before the}} first Test at Lord's. Michael Yardy was the star of the match, notching up 35 fours and two sixes in a towering 257 - the highest score of the English first class season so far - which led Sussex to 549 for 7 declared. In reply, Habibul Bashar got hit by a bouncer from Jason Lewry when on 22 not out, and thus had to retire, and things only went downhill from there. The Bangladeshis could only manage a total of 323 runs from two innings (127 and 196), with 16-year-old wicketkeeper Mushfiqur Rahim the only one who passed forty runs with a two-hour 63 in the second innings, before being stumped off a delivery by the Man of the Match, Yardy - who recorded his first career five-wicket haul, taking five for 83.|$|E

500|$|The film {{is based}} on the concept of reincarnation and eternal love. According to Rediff, the rewritten script's basic storyline is that [...] "Love remains eternal and it will follow generations and generations. There is always <b>a</b> <b>big</b> <b>victory</b> for Love." [...] The film's {{flashback}} sequences were used as a flip switch between the film's olden and present day eras. Initially the film featured a scene in which the present day heroine accidentally receives a dupatta preserved in a museum that is used in the flashbacks as the dupatta Bhairava and Ranadheer race for. However, separate dupattas were used in the film as Rajamouli felt that getting the dupatta from the flashback would complicate the narrative.|$|E
500|$|It was a {{journalist}} on a motorbike {{who managed to}} get up to me. He was shouting 'Not that way! Not that way!' And I turned round in the road and I rode back beneath the outside wall of the grandstand and I saw a gateway that went into the track, a gateway for journalists. And that's the way I went, except that it came out {{on the other side of}} the track from the proper entrance. The bunch came in and Serse won the sprint. But then his brother told Serse to go to the judges to object. He told Serse that I hadn't ridden the entire and precise course and that therefore I should be déclassé. But that was below him. Coppi wanted his brother to have <b>a</b> <b>big</b> <b>victory.</b> He was a great champion, Coppi, but to do what he did, to protest like that to get a victory for his brother, that wasn't dignified for a champion. That was below him. A champion like that should never have stooped that low. I never spoke to him about it. Never did. Why should I? ...|$|E
500|$|Australia won the {{remaining}} games {{to win the}} series. In the third match, Crawford scored his only half-century of the series, hitting 62 out of England's 363 to help his team build up a first innings lead. However, Australia scored 506 at the second attempt, during which Crawford bowled nearly 46 overs to take three for 113. The series was settled in the fourth Test; Australia recorded <b>a</b> <b>big</b> <b>victory</b> after rain affected the pitch and created difficult batting conditions during England's first innings. On the first day, Crawford took five for 48, his best Test figures, as Australia were bowled out for 214 on a very good pitch. Wisden noted Crawford [...] " [...] up his pace with remarkable skill". By {{this stage of the}} tour, the press looked on him much more favourably, and he received praise for his performances. However, his heavy workload with the ball affected his health; he lost a stone in weight during the tour, and before the final Test a Melbourne doctor diagnosed that he had [...] "strained {{the right side of his}} heart" [...] and advised that he see a specialist. Crawford played in that game, won by Australia, despite his ill health, with several other players unfit, and the tour manager later wrote that he looked poorly throughout and should not have played. Nevertheless, he bowled 54 overs and took eight wickets in the match.|$|E

The Philippines did not accept 154 recommendations of other UN member-states, including a condition-less visit for UN special rapporteur on extrajudicial killings Agnes Callamard and a thorough investigation of the deaths in connection with the war on drugs.|$|E

[...] Reimann was an outspoken advocate of banning alcohol from college campuses and in 1916 published an article in the YMCA publication Association Men on the topic of alcohol and athletics. [...] He noted the prevalence of alcohol on Michigan's campus:"It was customary after <b>a</b> <b>big</b> <b>victory</b> and when thousands of visitors were in town for the average student to go downtown to celebrate. He got filled with 'spirit,' but not the kind that helped his university's reputation. Scenes were enacted that caused the loyal and serious minded student to hang his head in shame. The visitors were not slow in spreading their impressions of the school." ...|$|E

2500|$|The British {{attack was}} to fulfil {{complementary}} objectives. Political discontent in London would be muted by <b>a</b> <b>big</b> <b>victory,</b> as would doubts of British commitment by its allies and British {{loyalty to the}} Chantilly strategy of 1915 would be upheld. The capture of Beaumont Hamel and Serre would go some way to redeem the failure of 1 July and obtain ground on which the British would have a tactical advantage. The attack was {{the largest in the}} British sector since September and had a seven-day preliminary bombardment, which was twice as heavy as that of 1 July. Beaumont Hamel, St Pierre Divion and Beaucourt were captured, which threatened the German hold on Serre further north. Edmund Blunden called the battle [...] "a feat of arms vieing (sic) with any recorded. The enemy was surprised and beaten". Four German divisions had to be relieved due to the number of casualties they suffered and over [...] troops were taken prisoner.|$|E

2500|$|On the Raw Is War after Austin won the WWF Championship, Vince McMahon {{presented}} him with a new title belt and warned Austin {{that he did not}} approve of his rebellious nature and that things could be done [...] "the easy way or the hard way". Austin gave his answer in the form of another Stone Cold Stunner. This led to a segment a week later where Austin had pledged a few days prior in a meeting to [...] "play ball" [...] with McMahon, appearing in a suit and tie, with a beaming McMahon taking a picture of himself and his new corporate champion. The entire thing was a ruse by Austin who {{in the course of the}} segment proceeded to tear off the suit, tell McMahon it was the last time he would see Austin dressed like this, punch his boss in the [...] "corporate grapefruits" [...] and take another picture of the two of them while McMahon was doubled over in pain. In April 1998, it appeared Austin and McMahon were going to battle out their differences in an actual match, but the match was declared a no contest when Dude Love made an appearance. This led to a match between Dude Love and Austin at , where Austin hit McMahon with a steel chair, then the following month they had a rematch at [...] for the WWF Championship.
