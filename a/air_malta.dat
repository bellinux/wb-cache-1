25|$|The PA 103 {{investigators}} {{learned that}} the baggage for <b>Air</b> <b>Malta</b> Flight KM 180 was processed {{at the same time}} as the bags for Libyan Arab Airlines Flight 147 to Tripoli. They later discovered that Megrahi had been a passenger on this flight, having arrived in Malta two days earlier using a false passport. As he declined to take the stand during his trial, his explanation for his presence in Malta, and his reason for using a fake Identity card, was never heard.|$|E
25|$|The later half of {{the decade}} {{witnessed}} further expansion of PIA's fleet {{with the introduction of}} Boeing 747s through either leased or purchased aircraft. During this decade PIA was regarded as Asia's best airline. For the first time since its inauguration, PIA started providing technical and administrative assistance or leased aircraft to foreign airlines including Somali Airlines, Philippine Airlines, <b>Air</b> <b>Malta</b> and Yemenia. A subsidiary of PIA also started providing hotel management services in United Arab Emirates {{towards the end of the}} decade.|$|E
25|$|In week 11, Mebo lawyer Dieter Neupert {{filed an}} {{official}} criminal complaint against the Crown {{over what he}} alleged was a 'forged fragment of MST-13 timer'. Tony Gauci of Mary's House, Sliema in Malta, testified that he had sold a number of items of clothing {{to one of the}} defendants, Megrahi. Wilfred Borg, Ground Operations Manager at Malta's Luqa airport, was questioned about Luqa's baggage handling procedures. A Mr Ferrugia confirmed that he had been a passenger on <b>Air</b> <b>Malta</b> flight KM 180 to Frankfurt on 21 December 1988.|$|E
50|$|Also {{supporting}} the NAAF were the RAF Middle East Command, <b>Air</b> Headquarters <b>Malta,</b> RAF Gibraltar, and the No. 216 (Transfer and Ferry) Group, which were subdivisions of MAC {{under the command}} of Tedder.

At the time, the 9th Air Force was a sub-command of RAF Middle East Command under Air Chief Marshal Sir Sholto Douglas. Middle East Command, like NAAF and <b>Air</b> H.Q. <b>Malta,</b> were sub-commands of MAC under Tedder who reported to Eisenhower for NAAF operations and to the British Chiefs of Staff for <b>Air</b> H.Q. <b>Malta</b> and Middle East Command operations.|$|R
25|$|In 1972 Malta {{abandoned}} the sterling system and adopted the Maltese pound, where 10 mils = 1 cent and 100 cents = 1 pound. An issue showing the new coins was issued, {{and this was}} followed by three overprints on the 1965 definitive. A new definitive issue showing various local scenes was issued on 31 March 1973, and an airmail set commemorating the setting up of <b>Air</b> <b>Malta</b> was issued a year later. All these were designed by Emvin Cremona, who had by now become a Knight of Malta, but by now his designs were looking dated and tired. In October 1974 the Posts & Telephones Department moved the GPO to Auberge d'Italie, while the Central Mail Room, registered letter branch and Poste Restante were relocated to the former Garrison Chapel.|$|E
2500|$|However, <b>Air</b> <b>Malta</b> {{issued a}} {{statement}} in 1989, denying that an unaccompanied suitcase could have been carried on Flight KM 180: [...] "39 passengers checked in 55 pieces of baggage; 55 pieces of baggage were loaded onto Flight KM 180; and, 39 passengers travelled on the flight. <b>Air</b> <b>Malta</b> has been informed that all 55 pieces of baggage have been accounted for and {{that every one of}} the 39 passengers has been identified," [...] <b>Air</b> <b>Malta</b> declared.|$|E

2500|$|Frankfurt International Airport {{records for}} December 21, 1988, had been saved, only by chance, by {{computer}} programmer Bogomira Erac, who had kept {{a copy of}} the records {{on the spur of the}} moment [...] "... in memory of the people who were on the plane". These records were to show that an unaccompanied bag had been routed from <b>Air</b> <b>Malta</b> Flight KM 180 out of Luqa Airport to Frankfurt, where it had been loaded onto Pan Am 103A, the feeder flight to London. A properly marked <b>Air</b> <b>Malta</b> baggage tag would have routed the suitcase through the interline system from Malta to Frankfurt, Frankfurt to London, and London to New York City.|$|E
2500|$|... the {{so-called}} primary suitcase being introduced as unaccompanied baggage at Luqa Airport in Malta, conveyed by <b>Air</b> <b>Malta</b> flight KM180 to Frankfurt International Airport, transferred there onto feeder flight PA 103A to Heathrow Airport, {{loaded into the}} interline baggage container AVE 4041PA at Heathrow, and put on board PA 103 in the forward cargo hold.|$|E
2500|$|GB Airways {{operated}} a service between Gibraltar and London {{and other cities}} for many years. The airline initially flew under the name [...] "Gibraltar Airways". In 1989, and in anticipation of service to cities outside the UK, Gibraltar Airways {{changed its name to}} GB Airways with the belief that a new name would incur fewer political problems. As a franchise, the airline operated flights in full British Airways livery. In 2007,GB Airways was purchased by easyJet, which began operating flights under their name in April 2008 when British Airways re-introduced flights to Gibraltar under their name. EasyJet have since added Bristol and Manchester and also operated flights to Liverpool between 2011 and 2012. Monarch Airlines operates scheduled services between Gibraltar and Luton, London Gatwick, Birmingham and Manchester. It has the largest number of flights between the United Kingdom and Gibraltar. The Spanish national airline, Iberia, {{operated a}} daily service to Madrid which ceased for lack of demand. In May 2009, Ándalus Líneas Aéreas opened a Spanish service, which also ceased operations in March 2010. An annual return charter flight to Malta is operated by Maltese national airline, <b>Air</b> <b>Malta.</b>|$|E

50|$|The {{remaining}} {{units were}} only Nos 13 and 39 Squadrons, both at Luqa flying photo-reconnaissance Canberras. The {{organisation and administration}} of the remaining units was passed to RAF Luqa, where an Air Commodore with the title of <b>Air</b> Commander <b>Malta</b> was installed, while overall control passed to Near East Air Force in Cyprus. <b>Air</b> Commander <b>Malta</b> assumed direct command of RAF units assigned to Malta. On 1 February 1969 No. 203 Squadron RAF was transferred from RAF Ballykelly to Hal Far, though it soon moved to Luqa. Reequipment of the squadron from Shackletons to BAe Nimrods soon began. Thereafter 39 Squadron was moved back to Wyton in the UK in October 1970.|$|R
2500|$|Prior to the {{abandonment}} of Megrahi's second appeal against conviction and while new evidence could be still tested in court, there had been few calls for an independent inquiry into the Lockerbie bombing. Demands for such an inquiry have increased since, and become more insistent. On 2 September 2009, former MEP Michael McGowan demanded that the UK government call for an urgent, independent inquiry led by the UN {{to find out the}} truth about Pan Am flight 103. [...] "We owe it {{to the families of the}} victims of Lockerbie and the international community to identify those responsible," [...] McGowan said. Two online petitions were started: one calling for a UK public inquiry into the Lockerbie bombing; the other a UN inquiry into the murder of UN Commissioner for Namibia, Bernt Carlsson, in the 1988 Lockerbie bombing. In September 2009, a third petition which was addressed to the President of the United Nations General Assembly demanded that the UN should [...] "institute a full public inquiry" [...] into the Lockerbie disaster. On 3 October 2009, Malta was asked to table a UN resolution supporting the petition, which was signed by 20 people including the families of the Lockerbie victims, authors, journalists, professors, politicians and parliamentarians, as well as Archbishop Desmond Tutu. The signatories considered that a UN inquiry could help remove [...] "many of the deep misgivings which persist in lingering over this tragedy" [...] and could also eliminate Malta from this terrorist act. Malta was brought into the case because the prosecution argued that the two accused Libyans, Abdelbaset al-Megrahi and Lamin Khalifah Fhimah, had placed the bomb on an <b>Air</b> <b>Malta</b> aircraft before it was transferred at Frankfurt airport to a feeder flight destined for London's Heathrow airport, from which Pan Am Flight 103 departed. The Maltese government responded saying that the demand for a UN inquiry was [...] "an interesting development that would be deeply considered, although there were complex issues surrounding the event." ...|$|E
50|$|After {{the opening}} of Malta International Airport in 1992, <b>Air</b> <b>Malta</b> created CargoSystems, which {{includes}} the air transportation of cargo on <b>Air</b> <b>Malta</b> planes. In 1994, <b>Air</b> <b>Malta</b> inaugurated a cargo center at the airport. It was also during this time that a codesharing agreement with Trans World Airlines began.|$|E
5000|$|In 1988, Gulf Air sent several Boeing 727-200 jetliners to Malta in the Mediterranean for {{a six-month}} [...] "sub-service contract" [...] with <b>Air</b> <b>Malta.</b> The flight attendants and pursers were <b>Air</b> <b>Malta</b> {{employees}} while the flight crews were Gulf Air Transport pilots.
