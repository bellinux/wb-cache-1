5|$|Metroid Prime Pinball is a pinball {{video game}} themed after the Metroid series. The game uses the {{graphical}} style and various story elements from Metroid Prime. It {{was developed by}} Fuse Games for the Nintendo DS handheld game console, and released by Nintendo in North America and Australia in 2005, in Japan in 2006, and in Europe in 2007. Metroid Prime Pinball uses the basic mechanics of pinball, along with typical pinball items. New mechanics are introduced, such as wall jumping {{and the ability to}} fire weapons. The Nintendo DS's touchscreen can be nudged with <b>a</b> <b>finger</b> <b>to</b> alter the pinball's trajectory while in motion.|$|E
5|$|Though not aggressive, {{the common}} {{stingray}} can inflict an excruciating wound with its serrated, venomous tail spine. The ancient Greeks and Romans greatly feared its venom, with authors such as Aelian (175–235 AD) stating that stingray wounds were incurable. The Roman naturalist Pliny the Elder (23–79 AD), in his Natural History, asserted that its spine {{was capable of}} killing trees, piercing armor like an arrow, and corroding iron. Greek poet Oppian (172–210 AD) claimed that the touch of stingray venom could even dissolve stone. In Greek mythology, Hercules {{was said to have}} lost <b>a</b> <b>finger</b> <b>to</b> the bite of a stingray, and Circe was said to have armed her son Telegonus with a spear tipped with a stingray spine, with which he accidentally slew his father Odysseus.|$|E

Some climbers use gloves made out of athletic tape to protect their hands.|$|E

25|$|In August 1896 Dr. HD. Hawks, a {{graduate}} of Columbia College, suffered severe hand and chest burns from an x-ray demonstration. It was reported in Electrical Review and led to many other reports of problems associated with x-rays being sent in to the publication. Many experimenters including Elihu Thomson at Edison's lab, William J. Morton, and Nikola Tesla also reported burns. Elihu Thomson deliberately exposed <b>a</b> <b>finger</b> <b>to</b> an x-ray tube {{over a period of}} time and suffered pain, swelling, and blistering. Other effects were sometimes blamed for the damage including ultraviolet rays and (according to Tesla) ozone. Many physicians claimed there were no effects from x-ray exposure at all.|$|E
25|$|The January 22, 1973 {{broadcast}} of the CBS Evening News saw Cronkite break {{the news of the}} death of another notable American political figure: former president Lyndon B. Johnson. At approximately 6:38pm Eastern Time, while a pre-recorded report that the Vietnam peace talks in Paris had been successful was being played for the audience, Cronkite received a telephone call in the studio while off camera. The call was from Tom Johnson, former spokesman to Lyndon Johnson (no relation), who at the time was also in charge of KTBC, CBS' Austin, Texas affiliate, which the former president owned. During the conversation the production staff cut away from the report back to the live camera in studio as Cronkite was still on the phone. After he was made aware that he was back on camera, Cronkite held up <b>a</b> <b>finger</b> <b>to</b> let everyone watching know he required a moment to let Johnson finish talking. Once Cronkite got what he needed, he thanked Johnson and asked him to stay on the line. He then turned to the camera and began to relay what Johnson had said to him.|$|E
500|$|Ahead of the June 1961 Vienna summit between Kennedy and Khrushchev, Robert F. Kennedy {{spoke with}} the Soviet {{ambassador}} to the US, who suggested that progress on a test ban was possible in a direct meeting between the leaders. President Kennedy subsequently announced to the press that he had [...] "strong hopes" [...] for progress on a test ban. In Vienna, Khrushchev suggested that three inspections per year {{would have to be}} the limit, as anything more frequent would constitute espionage. Khrushchev privately believed allowing three inspections to be a significant concession to the West, as other Soviet officials preferred an even less intrusive system, and was angered by US resistance. Khrushchev later told his son, [...] "hold out <b>a</b> <b>finger</b> <b>to</b> them—they chop off your whole hand." ...|$|E

500|$|One of {{the wealthiest}} stars in Hollywood, Grant owned houses in Beverly Hills, Malibu, and Palm Springs. He was immaculate in his {{personal}} grooming, and Edith Head, the renowned Hollywood costume designer, appreciated his [...] "meticulous" [...] attention to detail and considered him {{to have had the}} greatest fashion sense of any actor she had worked with. McCann attests his [...] "almost obsessive maintenance" [...] with tanning, which deepened the older he got, to Douglas Fairbanks, who also had a major influence on his refined sense of dress. [...] McCann notes that because Grant came from a working-class background and was not well educated, he made a particular effort {{over the course of his}} career to mix with high society and absorb their knowledge, manners and etiquette to compensate and cover it up. His image was meticulously crafted from the early days in Hollywood, where he would frequently sunbathe and avoid being photographed smoking, despite smoking two packs a day at the time. Grant quit smoking in the early 1950s through hypnotherapy. He remained health conscious, staying very trim and athletic even into his late career, though Grant admitted he [...] "never crook <b>a</b> <b>finger</b> <b>to</b> keep fit". He confessed that he did [...] "everything in moderation. Except making love".|$|E

2500|$|Latin {{had such}} a wealth of words for men outside the {{masculine}} norm that some scholars argue {{for the existence of}} a homosexual subculture at Rome; that is, although the noun [...] "homosexual" [...] has no straightforward equivalent in Latin, literary sources reveal a pattern of behaviors among a minority of free men that indicate same-sex preference or orientation. Plautus mentions a street known for male prostitutes. Public baths are also referred to as a place to find sexual partners. Juvenal states that such men scratched their heads with <b>a</b> <b>finger</b> <b>to</b> identify themselves.|$|E

I believe we have not the materials for it, and that the show of constitutional power we possess was exactly devised by our enemies to delude us into an endless and drift agitation. We have miserable franchises, and every day makes them worse. We have a government that first makes us poor, and then tempts our poverty with bribes and promises. We have few men of public virtue and national spirit, and in a sinking and debased province we cannot hope to rear such men more abundantly." ...|$|E
2500|$|The main {{character}} of NOW. Practitioner of the [...] "Sashinmu" [...] (사신무) killing style. He has distinct silver colored hair. He was the adopted grandson of North Star, and holds himself responsible for North Star's death. He {{seems to be}} developing a crush on Rin. Bi-Ryu is a rather simple young man, unable {{to catch up with}} the times on his own. This is shown when he and Ah-Rin prepare to embark on their quest. She asks if he is all packed, and if so, where are his things. He casts <b>a</b> <b>finger</b> <b>to</b> Cho-Ryung in response. He also had casually walked in on Yhun Ah-Rin and Cho Ryung in a bath, Bi Ryu asked directions and left as though she was not naked, Cho Ryung seems to have the same casualness. However, he is merciless in combat, referring to himself as a Sa-Shin, a death god. He has been shown to descend into a ferocious killing rage during battle, with Ah-Rin being the only one able to return him to normal.|$|E
2500|$|Cerebellar tremor (also {{known as}} {{intention}} tremor) is a slow, broad tremor of the extremities that {{occurs at the}} end of a purposeful movement, such as trying to press a button or touching <b>a</b> <b>finger</b> <b>to</b> the tip of one’s nose. Cerebellar tremor is caused by lesions in or damage to the cerebellum resulting from stroke, tumor, or disease such as multiple sclerosis or some inherited degenerative disorder. [...] It can also result from chronic alcoholism or overuse of some medicines. In classic cerebellar tremor, a lesion on one side of the brain produces a tremor in that same side of the body that worsens with directed movement. Cerebellar damage can also produce a “wing-beating” type of tremor called rubral or Holmes’ tremor— a combination of rest, action, and postural tremors. The tremor is often most prominent when the affected person is active or is maintaining a particular posture. Cerebellar tremor may be accompanied by other manifestations of ataxia, including dysarthria (speech problems), nystagmus (rapid, involuntary rolling of the eyes), gait problems and postural tremor of the trunk and neck. [...] Titubation is tremor of the head and is of cerebellar origin.|$|E
