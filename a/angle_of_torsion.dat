40|$|Introduction: <b>Angle</b> <b>of</b> femoral <b>torsion</b> is {{a normal}} torsion or twist present in femur that plays an {{important}} role in stability and function of the hip joint. The <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> femoral <b>torsion</b> can be defined as the angle formed by femoral condyle′s plane (bicondylar plane) and a plane passing through center of neck and femoral head. Abnormal <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> femoral <b>torsion</b> has been implicated in the etiology of hip osteoarthrosis and developmental dysplasia of hip joint. Materials and Methods: This study was carried out on unpaired 280, adult human femora devoid of any gross pathology, 139 male (65 right and 74 left), and 141 female (71 right and 70 left) from bone banks of three medical colleges of Maharashtra. The gender of each specimen was determined by the established practice. Femora were evaluated by Kingsley Olmsted method, and data were tabulated and statistically analyzed. Results: The average <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> femoral <b>torsion</b> 13. 39 ° and 11. 23 ° on the right and left side respectively in male, 16. 21 ° and 13. 23 ° on the right and left side, respectively, in female.

These variations are extremely significant in view of alignment guides such as those related to rotational landmarks of tibia in total knee arthroplasty. Further, precise knowledge and information pertaining to <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> tibial <b>torsion</b> also helps in correction of traumatic malunion or congenital maltorsion of tibia. Methods: The present study was carried out to determine the <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> tibial <b>torsion</b> in 100 adult dry tibia bones in the Department of Anatomy, Government Medical College, Amritsar. The study group comprised 50 males and 50 females with equal number of right- and left-sided bones. The measurements were meticulously recorded and the data were subjected to statistical analysis. The results were analyzed and discussed {{in the light of}} existing literature. Results: On the right side, it was found to be 29. 84 ° ± 4. 86 °° (range = 22. 00 ° - 38. 00 °) in males and 28. 92 ° ± 5. 10 °° (range = 15. 00 °- 38. 00 °) in females.

The normal leg of unilateral deformities served as the control. For the bilateral cases, only the right side {{was included in the}} study. The angle between the bicondylar axis of the tibia and the bimalleolar axis was the index <b>of</b> tibiofibular <b>torsion.</b> There were 34 clubfeet in the first series, treated with a posteromedial release, and 40 clubfeet in the second series, treated with a modified Ponseti method, whereas the third series included 16 clubfeet, treated with the original Ponseti method. All 90 clubfeet were graded at birth as group 3 according to the Manes classification. No patient had previous treatment. The patients of the first and the second series were followed up to maturity, whereas the patients of the third series were followed up to a maximum of 11 years of age. In the congenital clubfoot, the tibia and the fibula were externally rotated, in comparison with the normal leg; in fact, the average value <b>of</b> the <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> tibiofibular <b>torsion</b> was 32. 2 ° in the first series, 23. 9 ° in the second series, and 21. 1 ° in the third series. In the normal tibiae, the average value <b>of</b> the <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> tibiofibular <b>torsion</b> was 21. 4 °.

40|$|BACKGROUND Rotational {{deformities}} of {{the lower}} limbs are very common. There is increasing evidence that abnormal torsion in the tibia is associated with severe knee and ankle arthritis. Primary knee osteoarthritis is {{a leading cause of}} disability in older persons. Varus or valgus alignment increases the risk of osteoarthritis. Coexistence of tibial torsional deformity may increase the risk further. Variability in the tibial torsion has been reported and is due to the torsional forces applied on tibia during development. The aim of the study is to estimate the <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> tibial <b>torsion</b> on both sides and both sexes. The present study was an attempt to provide baseline data <b>of</b> tibial <b>torsion</b> in the East and South Indian population. MATERIALS AND METHODS The study was conducted mechanically on 100 dry adult unpaired human tibia, i. e. 50 male and 50 female bones. The measurements were recorded and statistically analysed using Student’s unpaired t-test using GraphPad Prism 5. 0 (free trial version). RESULTS Out of the 100 tibia undertaken, mean value <b>of</b> tibial <b>torsion</b> <b>angle</b> obtained is 25. 8 °. In males, it is 23. 68 ° and in females it is about 27. 86 °. Statistical analysis revealed significant greater average <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> tibial <b>torsion</b> in female bones. The <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> the right-sided bones was more and this was statistically significant. CONCLUSION The gender variation for the angle could be the result of the difference in lifestyle in day-to-day activities.

When the length of the beam section becomes longer, the value of the rotation angle increases. In general, the value of the angle of rotation for all shapes and sizes is close to the value of the angle of rotation for a FW profile without opening.

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages [74]- 77). This project examined humeral torsion in extant hominoids and humans. Torsion {{has been}} used in paleontological studies as an indicator of phylogenetic relationships and locomotor behavior. The <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> <b>torsion</b> and other features of the proximal humerus of juvenile and adult hominoid humeri were measured and compared to assess the degree to which these osteological traits change in the course of development. Statistical analysis revealed that some features of the proximal humerus? torsion and greater tuberosity angle?are ontogenetically stable, remaining relatively constant regardless of age. Other traits, such as lesser tuberosity angle and intertuberosity angle, exhibit more plasticity in the course of development. It has been suggested that a high level of humeral torsion evolved in African apes to accommodate the upper torso and shoulder anatomy of a hylobatid-like hominoid to the mechanical demands of terrestrial quadrupedalism. Examination of extant hominoid torsion values shows that while the evidence for such a correlation is convincing for gorillas, the form-function relationship for chimpanzees is more tenuous because their torsion values are more similar to those of orangutans than to gorillas. Humeral torsion values are relevant to proto-hominid behavior since the torsion values for three early hominid specimens are either very near or within the range for chimpanzees. Therefore, one cannot conclude that the locomotor repertory of proto-hominids did not include terrestrial quadrupedalism. M. A. (Master of Arts...|$|E

The goal of this project is to systematically enumerate feasible conformations (three-dimensional configurations) of a flexible molecule, subject to a given set of constraints on the distances between atoms and on the torsional <b>angles</b> <b>of</b> rotatable bonds. Without any constraints, the conformation space of a flexible molecule is astronomical (exponential in the number of degrees of freedom). Thus any naive, exhaustive search would be intractable. However, depending on the given set of constraints, the region of conformation space that satisfies the constraints may be small enough to search systematically. Motivation: There are many molecular modeling goals and medically important problems involving molecular structure determination that can be expressed as determining the set of structures that satisfy a given set of constraints. [3] For example, NMR spectroscopy data can provide bounds on certain interatomic distances in a protein.

One potential way of increasing the contact surface between the implants and osteoporotic bone is injection of bone cement (methyl-metacrilat, Palakos) into a prepared screw bed. This method of osteosynthesis was therefore subjected to experimental research to prove that application of modified osteosynthesis using bone cement in treatment of fractures in osteoporotic patients has advantage over the standard method of osteosynthesis because this modified method enables significantly greater firmness and stability of the osteosynthesis, which is the essential precondition of a successful fracture healing.

40|$|International audienceWe {{consider}} {{in this work}} general curved rods with a circular cross-section of radius. Our aim is to study the asymptotic behaviour of such rods as δ→ 0, {{in the framework of}} the linear elasticity according to the unfolding method. It consists in giving some decompositions of the displacements of such rods, and then in passing to the limit in a xed domain. A first decomposition concerns the elementary displacements of a curved rod which characterize its translations and rotations, and the residual displacements related to the deformation of the cross-section. The second decomposition concerns the displacements of the middle-line of the rod. We prove that such a displacement can be written as the sum of an inextensional displacement and of an extensional one. An extensional displacement will modify the length of the middle-line, while an inextensional displacement will not change this length in a rst approximation. We show that the H 1 -norm of an inextensional displacement is of order 1, while that of an extensional displacement is in general, of order δ. A priori estimates are established and convergence results as δ→ 0, are given for the displacements. We give their unfolded limits, as well as the unfolded limits of the strain and stress tensors. To prove the convergence of the strain tensor, the introduction of elementary and residual displacements appears as essential. By passing to the limit as δ→ 0 in the linearized system of the elasticity, we obtain on the one hand, a variational problem that is satis ed by the limit extensional displacement, and on the other hand, a variational problem coupling the limit of inextensional displacements and the limit of the <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> <b>torsion...</b>|$|E

The research activity has been carried out under the FutureWings project, funded by the European Commission within the 7 th Framework. Design/methodology/approach – The paper describes the basic assumptions made to define specimen geometries and to carry out experimental tests. Finite element (FE) results and experimental data (laser technique measurements) have been compared: it shows very good agreement for the displacements’ distribution along the specimens. Findings – Within the objectives of the project, the study of passive and active deformation characteristics of the hybrid composite material has provided reference technical data and has allowed for the correct adaptation of the FE models. More in particular, using the hybrid specimens, both the bending deformations and the torsion deformations have been studied. Practical implications – The deformation capability of the hybrid specimens will be used in the development of prototypical three-dimensional structures, that, through the electrical control of the MFC patches, will be able to change the curvature of their cross section or will be able to change the <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> <b>torsion</b> along their longitudinal axis. Originality/value – The design of nonstandard specimens and the tests executed represent a novelty in the field of structures using piezoelectric actuators. The numerical and experimental data of the present research constitute a small step forward in the field of smart materials technology...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. We have {{developed}} a prototype device which demonstrates the feasibility of using ns-duration laser pulses in a laser microthruster. Relative to the ms-duration thrusters which we have demonstrated in the past, this change offers {{the use of any}} target material, the use of reflection-mode target illumination, and adjustable specific impulse. Specific impulse is adjusted by varying laser intensity on target. In this way, we were able to vary specific impulse from 200 s to 3, 200 s on gold. We used a Concepts Research, Inc. microchip laser with 170 mW average optical power, 8 kHz repetition rate and 20 µJ pulse energy for many of the measurements. Thrust was in the 100 nN- 1 µN range for all the work, requiring development of an extremely sensitive, low-noise thrust stand. We will discuss the design of metallic fuel delivery systems. Ablation efficiency near 100 % was observed. Results obtained on metallic fuel systems agreed with simulations. We also report time-of-flight measurements on ejected metal ions, which gave velocities up to 80 km/s.

40|$|The Problem: The goal of {{this project}} is to {{systematically}} enumerate feasible conformations (three-dimensional con-figurations) of a flexible molecule, subject to a given set of constraints on the distances between atoms and on the torsional <b>angles</b> <b>of</b> rotatable bonds. Without any constraints, the conformation space of a flexible molecule is astro-nomical (exponential {{in the number of}} degrees of freedom); thus, any naive, exhaustive search would be intractable. However, depending on the given set of constraints, the region of conformation space that satisfies the constraints may be small enough to search systematically. Motivation: NMR (nuclear magnetic resonance) spectroscopy experiments yield constraints on the conformations of biologically interesting molecules. For example, NMR data might provide bounds on certain interatomic distances in a protein. Our most immediate motivation is to use systematic conformational search for interpreting NMR data about a small peptide called fMLF. Solid-state NMR experiments performed by collaborators are yielding constraints on interatomic distances, <b>torsion</b> <b>angles,</b> and pairs <b>of</b> <b>torsion</b> <b>angles</b> for fMLF. More generally, there are many molecular modeling goals and structure determination problems that can be expressed as determining the set of structures that satisfy a given set of constraints. Previous Work: A number of systematic conformational search methods have been developed as greater computa-tional resources have become available.

The bimalleolar plane generally makes a smaller angle (a) with the bicondylar plane than does the plane of the posterior tibial surface (A). However, posterior displacement of the fibula (broken lines) increases the <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> external tibiofibular <b>torsion</b> as measured between the bicondylar and bimalleolar planes. deformity is {{at the level of the}} ankle, or in the tibia itself, the axis of the tibiotalar articulation is internally rotated in respect to the axis of the knee. In congenital talipes equinovarus (CTEV) patholog-ical adduction of the metatarsal and tarsal bones is we!! recognised (Irani and Sherman 1963; Ritsil#{ 228 } 1969). However, there has been less agreement about the anatomy ofthe ankle and the tibia. Previous studies have examined the relationship of the proximal bicondylar axis to the bimalleolar axis (Fig. 1).
