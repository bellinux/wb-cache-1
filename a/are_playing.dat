5|$|Abbott {{has created}} several games, {{including}} card games, board games, and one equipment game. As a whole, his games {{are not of}} particular fame, although they have some unique elements that set them apart from mainstream games. For instance, the card game Metamorphosis is a complex trick-taking game. As you play the game, the rules change three times, so {{it is as if}} you <b>are</b> <b>playing</b> four different games that are threaded together.|$|E
5|$|Charing Cross was {{a central}} staging post for coaches, but the {{congested}} narrow road was a frequent scene of accidents; here, a bonfire has caused the Salisbury Flying Coach to overturn.

A link-boy blows on the flame of his torch, street-urchins <b>are</b> <b>playing</b> with the fire, and one of their fireworks is falling in at the coach window.|$|E

5|$|Bambi is a {{roe deer}} fawn {{born in a}} thicket to a young doe in late spring one year. Over {{the course of the}} summer, his mother teaches him about the various {{inhabitants}} of the forest and the ways deer live. When she feels he is old enough, she takes him to the meadow which he learns is both a wonderful but also dangerous place as it leaves the deer exposed and in the open. After some initial fear over his mother's caution, Bambi enjoys the experience. On a subsequent trip, Bambi meets his Aunt Ena, and her twin fawns Faline and Gobo. They quickly become friends and share what they have learned about the forest. While they <b>are</b> <b>playing,</b> they encounter princes, male deer, for the first time. After the stags leave, the fawns learn that those were their fathers, but that the fathers rarely stay with or speak to the females and young.|$|E

5|$|The {{relationship}} between river flows and Murray cod recruitment {{are more complex}} than first thought, and in less regulated rivers, Murray cod {{may be able to}} recruit under a range of conditions including stable low flows. (Significant recruitment of Murray cod in low-flow conditions in less regulated lowland rivers has now been proven.) This information also suggests that nonriver-regulation-related causes of degradation <b>are</b> <b>playing</b> a larger role in the survival and recruitment of Murray cod larvae than first thought; competition from extremely large numbers of invasive carp larvae are negatively affecting the survival and recruitment of Murray cod larvae to a much greater degree than first thought; and that decades of overfishing is playing a far larger role in the current state of Murray cod stocks, through depletion of spawning adults, than first thought.|$|E

5|$|Valhalla {{is first}} {{mentioned}} in chapter 2 of the Prose Edda book Gylfaginning, {{where it is}} described partially in euhemerized form. In the chapter, King Gylfi sets out to Asgard {{in the guise of}} an old man going by the name of Gangleri to find the source {{of the power of the}} gods. The narrative states that the Æsir foresaw his arrival and had prepared grand illusions for him, so that when Gangerli enters the fortress, he sees a hall of such a height that he has trouble seeing over it, and notices that the roof of the hall is covered in golden shields, as if they were shingles. Snorri then quotes a stanza by the skald Þjóðólfr of Hvinir (c. 900). As he continues, Gangleri sees a man in the doorway of the hall juggling short swords, and keeping seven in the air at once. Among other things, the man says that the hall belongs to his king, and adds that he can take Gangleri to the king. Gangleri follows him, and the door closes behind him. All around him he sees many living areas, and throngs of people, some of which <b>are</b> <b>playing</b> games, some are drinking, and others are fighting with weapons. Gangleri sees three thrones, and three figures sitting upon them: High sitting on the lowest throne, Just-As-High sitting on the next highest throne, and Third sitting on the highest. The man guiding Gangleri tells him that High is the king of the hall.|$|E
