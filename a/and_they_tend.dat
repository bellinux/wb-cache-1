5|$|The seductive details {{effect has}} {{primarily}} been demonstrated {{at the point}} of knowledge acquisition (initial learning); its impact on transfer performance has not been clearly shown. Theory in text comprehension suggests that seductive details might be detrimental for recall but advantageous for transfer performance because of the schematic representation of information that trainees form during instruction. Researchers have described the seductive details effect as having a damaging effect on recall because it distracts trainees from learning <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>tend</b> to form inappropriate schemas to organize information. However, when learners are applying knowledge, empirical studies suggest that the distortion of the macro structure or schema of the instructional material is beneficial.|$|E
5|$|Cirrocumulus clouds form in {{patches and}} cannot cast shadows. They {{commonly}} appear in regular, rippling patterns or in rows of clouds with clear areas between. Cirrocumulus are, like {{other members of}} the cumuliform and stratocumuliform categories, formed via convective processes. Significant growth of these patches indicates high-altitude instability and can signal the approach of poorer weather. The ice crystals in the bottoms of cirrocumulus clouds tend to be in the form of hexagonal cylinders. They are not solid, but instead tend to have stepped funnels coming in from the ends. Towards the top of the cloud, these crystals have a tendency to clump together. These clouds do not last long, <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>tend</b> to change into cirrus because as the water vapor continues to deposit on the ice crystals, they eventually begin to fall, destroying the upward convection. The cloud then dissipates into cirrus. Cirrocumulus clouds come in four species which are common to all three genus-types that have limited-convective or stratocumuliform characteristics: stratiformis, lenticularis, castellanus, and floccus. They are iridescent when the constituent supercooled water droplets are all about the same size.|$|E

5|$|Horses, plains zebras and {{mountain}} zebras live in stable, closed family groups or harems consisting of one adult male, several females and their offspring. These groups {{have their own}} home ranges which overlap <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>tend</b> to be nomadic. The stability of the group remains even when the family stallion dies or is displaced. Plains zebra groups gather into large herds and may create temporarily stable subgroups within a herd, allowing individuals to interact with those outside their group. Among harem-holding species, this behavior has only otherwise been observed in primates like the gelada and the hamadryas baboon. Females of harem species benefit as males give them more time for feeding, protection for their young, as well as protection from predators and harassment by outside males. Among females in a harem, a linear dominance hierarchy exists based on the time at which they join the group. Harems travel in a consistent filing order with the high-ranking mares and their offspring leading the groups followed by the next highest ranking mare and her offspring and so on. The family stallion takes up the rear. Social grooming (which involves individuals rubbing their heads against each other and nipping with the incisors and lips) is important for easing aggression and maintaining social bonds and status. Young of both sexes leave their natal groups as they mature; females are usually abducted by outside males to be included as permanent members of their harems.|$|E

Many species of birds are permanent residents of CPNWR, while many others migrate through during the spring and fall.

25|$|The {{extent of}} Philo's {{knowledge}} of Hebrew is debated. His numerous etymologies of Hebrew names—which are {{along the lines}} of the etymologic midrash to Genesis and of the earlier rabbinism, though not modern Hebrew philology—suggest some familiarity. Philo offers for some names three or four etymologies, sometimes including the correct Hebrew root (e.g., , descent, as the origin of the name Jordan). However his works do not display much understanding of Hebrew grammar, <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>tend</b> to follow the translation of the Septuagint more closely than the Hebrew version.|$|E
5|$|Six {{species of}} honeyeater have been {{observed}} feeding at its flowers, as have insects including honeybees, ants, butterflies, beetles and native bees. Both birds and insects function as pollinators, but honeybees are probably not very effective: in one study only about 4% of honeybees collected pollen, <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>tended</b> to move from inflorescence to inflorescence on the same plant, rather than moving between plants.|$|R

25|$|Besides these routes, {{there are}} tractor routes along the {{climbing}} routes. These tractor routes {{are used to}} bring food and other materials to huts on the mountain. Because the tractors usually take {{up most of the}} width of these paths <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>tend</b> to push large rocks {{from the side of the}} path, the tractor paths are off-limits to the climbers on sections that are not merged with the climbing or descending paths. Nevertheless, one can sometimes see people riding mountain bikes along the tractor routes down from the summit. This is particularly risky, as it becomes difficult to control speed and may send some rocks rolling along the side of the path, which may hit other people.|$|E
25|$|The {{importance}} {{of how a}} woman perceives her behavior should not be underestimated. Many women perceived sex as a chore {{as opposed to a}} pleasurable experience, <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>tend</b> to consider themselves sexually inadequate, which in turn does not motivate them to engage in sexual activity. Several factors influence a women's perception of her sexual life. These can include: race, her gender, ethnicity, educational background, socioeconomic status, sexual orientation, financial resources, culture, and religion. Cultural differences are also present in how women view menopause and its impact on health, self-image, and sexuality. A study has found that African American women are the most optimistic about menopausal life; Caucasian women are the most anxious, Asian women are the most inhibited about their symptoms, and Hispanic women are the most stoic.|$|E

500|$|An ontological {{argument}} is a philosophical {{argument for the}} existence of God that uses ontology.

500|$|An {{interview}} in the August 2006 issue of PC Gamer magazine revealed that the Hunter stands [...] tall. Erik Johnson, the game's project lead, states that the Hunters are [...] "big and impressive, but they can go anywhere the player can go", as the player can encounter them both indoors and outdoors. Ted Backman, senior artist for Valve, talks about how the Hunter can express emotions, being a somewhat non-human character. [...] "We want the Hunter {{to be able to}} express nervousness or aggression, [...] whether it's aggressive, hurt, or mad." [...] Hunters are very aggressive <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>tend</b> to operate in packs, but can also be found supporting other Combine troops. Late in the game, they can be found escorting Striders, using their flechette guns to protect the Striders that the player is trying to attack.|$|E
