5|$|The NTSB {{concluded}} that the crash occurred due to the TWA flight crew's inability to successfully <b>abort</b> takeoff due to {{the speed of the}} aircraft, and that a runway overrun was unavoidable at the 707's speed. The disabled DC-9, a Delta Air Lines flight which had reported that it had cleared the runway when in fact it had not, was a contributing factor in the crash. The NTSB recommended that the FAA establish and publicize standards of safe clearance from runway edges for both aircraft and ground vehicles which also take into account the exhaust fumes of jet engines. The board also recommended a reevaluation of training manuals and aircraft procedures in regard to <b>abort</b> procedures.|$|E

40|$|Ninety-one pregnant, {{crossbred}} Angus heifers <b>aborted</b> {{after receiving}} an injection of a prostaglandin analog {{at an average}} of 50, 75, 100, or 122 days of gestation. Weight change in the first 3 weeks after abortion and subsequent estrous cycles were observed. No detrimental effects were noted in those heifers <b>aborting</b> at 50 or 75 days of gestation, and growth rate was not altered. Those heifers <b>aborting</b> at 100 days of gestation exhibited a decreased growth rate; those <b>aborted</b> at 122 days lost weight. There was more udder development, vaginal discharge, and retained membranes in heifers <b>aborted</b> later in gestation. Typically, heifers exhibited estrus within 5 days after abortion, then had 8 - to 12 -day cycles until a normal cycle occurred. Heifers <b>aborted</b> at 50 days of gestation required an average of 7. 5 days prior to the estrus of their first normal cycle, 13. 2 days if <b>aborted</b> at 75 days, 16. 7 days if <b>aborted</b> at 100 days, and 24. 7 days if <b>aborted</b> at 122 days...|$|R
50|$|Cycles of {{committed}} transactions can {{be prevented}} by <b>aborting</b> an undecided (neither committed, nor <b>aborted)</b> transaction on each cycle in the precedence graph of all the transactions, which can otherwise turn into a cycle of committed transactions (and a committed transaction cannot be <b>aborted).</b> One transaction <b>aborted</b> per cycle is both required and sufficient number to break and eliminate the cycle (more <b>aborts</b> are possible, and can happen in some mechanisms, but unnecessary for serializability). The probability of cycle generation is typically low, but nevertheless, such a situation is carefully handled, typically with a considerable overhead, since correctness is involved. Transactions <b>aborted</b> due to serializability violation prevention are restarted and executed again immediately.|$|R
5|$|The {{majority}} opinion {{presented by the}} NTSB accident report determined {{that the cause of}} the accident was the TWA flight crew's inability to successfully <b>abort</b> takeoff procedures due to an excess of speed. The NTSB recommended revisions and expansions to airline <b>abort</b> procedures and new FAA regulations defining runway clearance and procedures, taking into account jet engine exhaust. In his minority report, Mr. McAdams' said that he would have found the probable cause of the accident to be the Delta crew's failure to adequately advise the tower of the proximity to the runway, and the tower's failure to request additional and precise information prior to clearing TWA 159 for takeoff.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of {{infestation}} by this aphid, leaves of sugar beet become swollen, roll, and cease developing. The roots grow poorly and the sugar content is reduced. In some other plants the leaves do not become distorted but growth is affected and flowers <b>abort</b> due to {{the action of the}} toxic saliva injected by the aphid to improve the flow of sap.|$|E
5|$|Attacks may {{be brought}} on by {{physical}} exertion, drinking alcohol, or eating food high in carbohydrates or salt. This may explain why attacks are more common in summer, when more people drink sugary drinks and engage in exercise. Exercise-related attacks tend to occur {{during a period of}} rest immediately after exercise; exercise may therefore be recommended to <b>abort</b> an attack.|$|E
5000|$|In this example, {{although}} F2 is recoverable, it {{does not}} avoid cascading <b>aborts.</b> It {{can be seen that}} if T1 <b>aborts,</b> T2 will have to be <b>aborted</b> too {{in order to maintain the}} correctness of the schedule as T2 has already read the uncommitted value written by T1.|$|R
30|$|Obviously, the {{deadlock}} solving {{strategy is}} not unique, and the optimal strategy {{is the one}} that <b>aborts</b> the least number of tasks. However, other factors (e.g., cost, operating state, urgency degree, priority, etc.) may be different with each task. For example, if the costs of <b>aborting</b> T 1, T 2, and T 3 are 2, 3, and 4, respectively, then the cost of <b>aborting</b> T 1 and T 2 is 5, but the cost of <b>aborting</b> T 3 is 4, so the latter is a better strategy. In this paper, we try to identify the optimal deadline solving strategy considering both quantity of <b>aborted</b> tasks and their cost.|$|R

The observed difference between <b>aborted</b> fetuses and control group is significant (P < 0.05).

The crew was on board when the postponement was called at the T-minus 5minute mark at approximately 7:51am EST (12:51UTC).|$|E
40|$|In Transactional Memory (TM) if any two {{concurrently}} executing transactions perform {{conflicting data}} accesses, {{one of them}} is <b>aborted.</b> The transaction to be <b>aborted</b> is usually selected by some form of contention manager. <b>Aborted</b> transactions waste computing resources, and reduce performance. Ideally, concurrent execution of transactions would be ordered to minimize <b>aborts,</b> but such an ordering is often either complex, or unfeasible, to obtain. This paper presents introduces a new technique called stealon-abort, which aims to improve transaction ordering at runtime. When a transaction is <b>aborted,</b> it is typically restarted immediately. However, due to close temporal locality, the immediately restarted transaction may repeat its conflict with the same transaction that <b>aborted</b> it the first time, leading to another <b>aborted</b> transaction. In steal-on-abort, the <b>aborted</b> transaction is stolen by the non-aborted transaction, and queued behind it, thus preventing the two transactions from conflicting again. Steal-on-abort operates at runtime, and requires no applicationspecific information or offline pre-processing. In this paper, steal-on-abort is considered for eager-validation TM systems, and evaluated using a sorted linked list, red-black tree, and STAMP-vacation with different contention managers. The evaluation reveals a range of improvements in throughput performance, and in the transactional metrics wasted work, and aborts-per-commit (APC). 1...|$|R

40|$|Background. The {{outcome of}} {{patients}} undergoing a single-lung transplant {{in the setting}} of an <b>aborted</b> bilateral lung transplant is unclear. Methods. A retrospective review of single lung transplants at an institutional program. Results. Of the 543 lung transplants performed over the last 10 years, 31 (5. 7 %) were single-lung transplants. Nineteen of 31 (61 %) were planned single-lung transplants, while 12 / 31 (39 %) were intraoperatively <b>aborted,</b> double lung transplants converted to single-lung transplants. The <b>aborted</b> and planned groups were similar in age, lung allocation score and NYHA status. The reasons for <b>aborted</b> double lung transplantation were cardiac/hemodynamic instability 4 / 12 (33 %), difficult pneumonectomy 3 / 12 (25 %), size mismatch 4 / 12 (33 %), and technical issues 1 / 12 (8 %). The <b>aborted</b> group had higher CPB utilization (5 / 12 versus 1 / 19, =. 02), similar ischemic times (260 versus 234 [*]min) and similar incidence of grade 3 primary graft dysfunction (6 / 12 versus 3 / 19, =. 13). ECMO was required for graft dysfunction in 2 patients in the <b>aborted</b> group. The one and two-year survival was 84 % and 79 % in the planned group and 62 % and 52 % in the <b>aborted</b> group, respectively. Conclusions. Patients undergoing single-lung transplantation {{in the setting of}} an <b>aborted</b> bilateral lung transplant may be at a higher risk of worse outcomes...|$|R
40|$|An {{immunohistochemical}} {{examination of}} <b>aborted</b> bovine tissues, collected from two dairy farms {{that had a}} high abortion rate (7 %), detected the organism Neospora caninum (NC).

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a twin-page storage method, {{which is an}} alternative to the TWIST (twin slot) approach by Reuter, for rapid transaction-undo recovery. In contrast to TWIST, our twin-page approach allows dirty pages in the buffer to be written at any instant onto disk without the requirement of undo logging, and, when a transaction is <b>aborted,</b> no explicit undo is required. As a result, all locks accumulated by the <b>aborted</b> transaction can be released earlier, allowing other transactions waiting for the locks to proceed. Through maintenance of <b>aborted</b> transaction identifiers, invalid pages written by the <b>aborted</b> transaction coexist with other valid pages and are guaranteed not be accessed by subsequent transactions. Instead of an explicit undo, most of the invalid pages are overwritten by subsequent normal updates. Performance in terms of disk I/O and CPU overhead for transaction-undo recovery is analyzed and compared with TWIST. It is shown that our scheme is particularly suited for applications where there are a large number of updates written onto disk when transactions are <b>aborted,</b> and there are frequent <b>aborts.</b> The approach, however, is not as applicable to environments where transactions are typically short or rarely <b>aborted,</b> or most updates are not written onto disk before a commitment...|$|R

5|$|Davies' {{next project}} was The Grand, a period soap drama {{set in a}} Manchester hotel during the interwar period. It was {{designed}} to be a valuable show in a ratings war with the BBC and was scheduled at 9pm on a Friday night. After the original writer abandoned the series, Granada approached him to write the entire show. His scripts for the first series reflect the pessimism of the period; each episode added its own emotional trauma on the staff, including a soldier's execution for desertion, a destitute maid who threatens to illegally <b>abort</b> her unborn child to survive, and a multi-episode storyline centred on the chambermaid, Monica Jones (Jane Danson), who kills her rapist in self-defence, is arrested, and eventually hanged for murder. The show was renewed for a second series despite the first's dark tone.|$|E

40|$|This is {{the first}} {{investigation}} into what matters to British women when they think about donating an <b>aborted</b> fetus to research, and how stem cell research and therapies might influence their views. Tissue derived from the <b>aborted</b> fetus is considered "the right tool for the job" in some stem cell laboratories. Research using tissue derived from <b>aborted</b> fetuses is permitted in Britain, while deliberate abortion to provide fetal tissue for research is illegal. Investigators are advised to seek women's agreement to donate the fetus after they have signed the consent form for the abortion, and stem cell researchers seek fetuses <b>aborted</b> under the 'social' grounds of the Abortion Act 1967. This research was based on focus groups with women who had both had a termination and {{had not had a}} termination. It found that initial enthusiasm for the donation of the <b>aborted</b> fetus for medical research, which was understood as a good thing, diminished as participants gained information and thought more carefully about the implications of such a decision. Lack of knowledge about how <b>aborted</b> fetuses are treated as scientific objects in the stem cell laboratory provoked concerns about mishandling, and invoked in some participants what we have called the duty of care which women feel towards babies and children. The duty of care might apply to other research using <b>aborted</b> fetuses. But what makes stem cell research more troubling is its association with renewal, regeneration, and immortality which participants understood as somehow reinstating and even developing the fetus' physical existence and social biography, the very thing abortion is meant to eliminate. By the end of the focus groups, participants had co-produced a tendency to refuse to donate <b>aborted</b> fetuses.
