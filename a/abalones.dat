25|$|The maximum shell {{length of}} this species is up to 12cm, but it more {{commonly}} grows up to about 9cm. The shell of Haliotis asinina has a distinctly elongated contour, in clear resemblance to a donkey ear, hence the common name. Its outer surface is smooth and almost totally covered by the mantle in life, making encrustations of other animals (such as barnacles) quite uncommon in comparison to other <b>abalones.</b> The shell of H. asinina presents 5 to 7 ovate open holes {{on the left side}} of the body whorl. These holes collectively make up what is known as the selenizone which form as the shell grows. Its spire is somewhat conspicuous, with a mostly posterior apex. The color may variate between green olive or brown externally, with distinct roughly triangular patches.

40|$|Wild <b>abalone</b> populations {{throughout}} the world have declined dramatically over the past 40 years due primarily to market demands for the mollusc 2 ̆ 7 s edible foot. Northern <b>abalone</b> (Haliotis kamtschatkana), the only <b>abalone</b> species occurring in British Columbia (B. C.), is widely thought to be threatened by potential population collapse {{as a result of}} low adult densities that impair reproductive potential. This study examined the hypothesis that the abundance of wild northern <b>abalone</b> populations are below a critical density required for successful reproduction and assessed two techniques that may aid the 2 ̆ 7 recovery 2 ̆ 7 of northern <b>abalone</b> in B. C. In the first study, I created dense aggregations of mature <b>abalone</b> during the reproductive period to test whether <b>abalone</b> preferred high density spawning aggregations that theoretically enhance reproductive potential. Twelve weeks following the manipulations, transplanted <b>abalone</b> had dispersed from enhanced densities at different rates and one year later, <b>abalone</b> densities had returned to pre-treatment levels. Slower rates of transplanted <b>abalone</b> dispersal at specific locations indicated that artificially aggregated <b>abalone</b> may have an enhanced theoretical reproductive potential. However, transplanted <b>abalone</b> dispersing to pre-treatment densities indicated that wild populations do not necessarily suffer from impaired reproductive potential. In the second study, I installed artificial habitats that provided standardized surrogate habitat for juvenile <b>abalone</b> and surveyed surrounding natural habitats to determine an index of juvenile <b>abalone</b> abundance. Juvenile <b>abalone</b> used artificial structures at greater mean densities than nearby natural habitat and juvenile <b>abalone</b> abundance was significantly different between sites but not within sites, suggesting artificial structures showed promise in their ability to detect area specific differences in recruitment and to easily measure juvenile <b>abalone</b> abundance.

25|$|Humans have {{harvested}} black <b>abalones</b> {{along the}} California Coast {{for at least}} 10,000 years. On San Miguel Island, archaeological evidence shows that the Island Chumash people and their ancestors ate black abalone for millennia and also used the shells to make fishhooks, beads, and ornaments. After the Chumash and other California Indians were devastated by European diseases, and sea otters were nearly eradicated from California waters by the historic fur trade, black abalone populations rebounded and attracted an intensive intertidal fishery conducted primarily by Chinese immigrants from the 1850s to about 1900.|$|E

40|$|Australian <b>abalone</b> {{production}} has {{been affected by}} outbreaks of <b>abalone</b> viral ganglioneuritis (AVG) caused by a herpesvirus (AbHV). In this study, we undertook experimental transmission trials by immersion to study the <b>abalone</b> immune response to infection with AbHV. Representative cellular and humoural immune parameters of <b>abalone,</b> including total haemocyte count (THC), superoxide anion (SO) and antiviral activity against herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV- 1), were examined in apparently healthy (sub-clinical) and moribund <b>abalone</b> after challenge. In the early infection, sub-clinical stage (days 1 – 3), THC was found to increase significantly in infected <b>abalone.</b> TaqMan qPCR confirmed 20. 5 % higher viral load in moribund <b>abalone</b> compared to apparently healthy <b>abalone,</b> indicating that the abundance of AbHV within <b>abalone</b> is linked to their clinical signs.

In contrast, red <b>abalone,</b> Haliotis rufescens (Swainson, 1822), populations in northern California continue {{to sustain a}} 1, 100 1 per year free-diving recreational fishery. We used standardized <b>Abalone</b> Recruitment Modules (ARMs) made of half cinder blocks (area = 2. 6 m(2)) to compare the recruitment of juvenile <b>abalone</b> in northern California. where stocks are abundant, with southern California where stocks have declined.

2500|$|Black abalone have {{dramatically}} declined in numbers throughout their historical range, and are locally extirpated in certain areas. [...] This decline was initiated by overfishing. [...] Following World War II, the California abalone fishery was not managed for individual species.

[...] Black abalone were the last to be targeted, with the peak harvest occurring in the 1970s. Additionally, improved harvesting technologies that expanded the harvesting areas and supported larger harvests per unit effort were not initiated. Now, all abalone fisheries in California are managed by the California Department of Fish and Game, which restricts the size of <b>abalones</b> caught, and the season in which harvesting can take place. In Mexico, there is a total allowable catch limit for black <b>abalones.</b> Even though harvesting black abalone is [...] regulated in California, poaching still occurs.
