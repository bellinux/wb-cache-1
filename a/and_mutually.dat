5|$|In 1613 Sigismund III Vasa {{reached an}} {{understanding}} with Matthias, Holy Roman Emperor, based on which both sides agreed to cooperate <b>and</b> <b>mutually</b> provide assistance in suppressing internal rebellions. The pact neutralized the Habsburg Monarchy {{in regard to}} the Commonwealth's war with Russia, but had resulted in more serious consequences after the Bohemian Revolt gave rise to the Thirty Years' War in 1618.|$|E
5|$|The book {{presents}} {{case histories}} {{of all the}} twin-pairs studied and the raw data from the analyses. Its last chapters put the results {{in the context of}} existing studies, and presented a new theory and model to explain the causes and continuance of the disorder. The environmental aspects the researchers checked drew on existing literature, and multiple judgments were pooled to both compare <b>and</b> <b>mutually</b> cancel differing criteria for diagnosing schizophrenia. The theory in the book was that many genes work together to dispose a person to the disorder under certain environmental pressures. The model provided no specific therapeutic insight, but was useful as a guideline for further study.|$|E

The Eastbourne business community is well connected <b>and</b> <b>mutually</b> supportive. The Chamber of Commerce is strong with around 600 members and holds many networking events to facilitate local B2B links. There are many business events for local entrepreneurs to promote their goods and services. Large revenues are generated through tourism and conference tourism with reports showing a £365 million revenue from visitors in 2010, 3.1% greater than 2009 and estimated to support 7,160 jobs. The council's blueprint for future development in the town centre maps out a strategy for further boosting these numbers by attracting even more residents, shoppers and visitors to the town.|$|E
5|$|On 19 January 1957, Jordan {{signed the}} Arab Solidarity Agreement (ASA) with Saudi Arabia, Egypt and Syria which entailed those countries' {{financial}} assistance to replace the annual British aid to Jordan that ended with the abrogation of the Anglo-Jordanian Treaty in November 1956 (the treaty was officially <b>and</b> <b>mutually</b> abrogated in March 1957). However, implementation of the ASA was hindered by Egypt and Syria's inability or unwillingness to subsidize the Jordanian army, whose budget rivaled that of their own armies. Furthermore, by then, Abu Nuwar was steadily losing Hussein's confidence due to dissatisfaction with Abu Nuwar among the army brass and the negative effects that his anti-Western hostility was having on relations with Jordan's principal Western allies, the UK and US; Hussein viewed the latter two as much-needed alternatives of financial support to Jordan in lieu of his disappointment with the ASA.|$|E

Agnes and Knaths shared artistic leanings <b>and</b> <b>mutually</b> influenced each other's increasing use of abstraction in their work.|$|E
25|$|Ben Shahn’s social-realist vision {{informed}} {{his approach}} to art. Shahn’s examination {{of the status quo}} inspired his creative process. Although he often explored polemic themes of modern urban life, organized labor, immigration and injustice, he did so while maintaining a compassionate tone. Shahn identified himself as a communicative artist. He challenged the esoteric pretensions of art, which he believed disconnect artists and their work from the public. As an alternative, he proposed an intimate <b>and</b> <b>mutually</b> beneficial relationship between artist and audience.|$|E
25|$|On the whole, though, sign {{languages}} {{are independent of}} spoken languages and follow their own paths of development.

The grammars of sign languages do not usually resemble those of spoken languages {{used in the same}} geographical area; in fact, in terms of syntax, ASL shares more with spoken Japanese than it does with English.|$|E

40|$|As a prolegomenon to {{understanding}} {{the sense in which}} dualities are theoretical equivalences, we investigate the intuitive `equivalence' of hyper-regular Lagrangian and Hamiltonian classical mechanics.

25|$|These {{approaches}} {{utilize the}} concepts of molecular self-assembly and/or supramolecular chemistry to automatically arrange themselves into some useful conformation through a bottom-up approach. The concept of molecular recognition is especially important: molecules can be designed so that a specific configuration or arrangement is favored due to non-covalent intermolecular forces. The Watson–Crick basepairing rules are {{a direct result of}} this, as is the specificity of an enzyme being targeted to a single substrate, or the specific folding of the protein itself. Thus, two or more components can be designed to be complementary <b>and</b> <b>mutually</b> attractive so that they make a more complex and useful whole.|$|E
25|$|The 6th Army began {{attacks from}} Arras north to Armentières in late October, which were {{faced by the}} BEF III Corps from Rouges Bancs, past Armentières north to the Douve river beyond the Lys. During desperate <b>and</b> <b>mutually</b> costly German attacks, the III Corps, with some British and French reinforcements, was pushed back several times, in the 6th Division area on the right flank but managed to retain Armentières. The {{offensive}} of the German 4th Army at Ypres and the Yser was made the principal German effort and the attacks of the 6th Army were reduced to probes and holding attacks {{at the end of}} October, which gradually diminished during November.|$|E
25|$|As {{changes since}} the fall of Communism in 1989 have redrawn the map of Europe, Poland has tried to forge strong <b>and</b> <b>mutually</b> {{beneficial}} relationships with its seven new neighbours, this has notably included signing 'friendship treaties' to replace links severed by the collapse of the Warsaw Pact. Poland has forged a special relationships with Ukraine, with whom it co-hosted the UEFA Euro 2012 football tournament, in an effort to firmly anchor the country within the Western world and provide it with an alternative to aligning itself with the Russian Federation. Despite many positive developments in the region, Poland has found itself in a position where it must seek to defend the rights of ethnic Poles living in the former Soviet Union; this is particularly true of Belarus, where in 2005 the Lukashenko regime launched a campaign against the Polish ethnic minority.|$|E
