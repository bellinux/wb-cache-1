40|$|Summary. This chapter {{presents}} the theory, implementation, {{and application of}} a novel operations system for <b>articulated</b> <b>robots</b> with large numbers (10 s to 100 s) of degrees-of-freedom (DoF), based on virtual articulations and kinematic abstractions. Such robots are attractive in some applications, including space exploration, due to their application flexibility. But operating them can be challenging: {{they are capable of}} many different kinds of motion, but often this requires coordination of many joints. Prior methods exist for specifying motions at both low and high-levels of detail; the new methods fill a gap in the middle by allowing the operator to be as detailed as desired. The presentation is fully general and can be directly applied across a broad class of 3 D <b>articulated</b> <b>robots.</b> ...|$|R

50|$|Victor David Scheinman (December 28, 1942 - September 20, 2016) was {{a pioneer}} in the field of {{robotics}} born in Augusta, Georgia. He was a graduate of the now-defunct New Lincoln High School in New York. In the late 1950s, and while in high school, Scheinman engineered a speech-to-text machine as a science fair project. In 1969, while at Stanford University, Scheinman invented the Stanford arm, an all-electric, 6-axis <b>articulated</b> <b>robot</b> designed to permit an arm solution in closed form. This allowed the robot to accurately follow arbitrary paths in space under computer control and widened the potential use of the robot to more sophisticated applications such as assembly and arc welding. In 1973, Scheinman started Vicarm Inc. to manufacture his robot arms. In 1977, Scheinman sold his design to Unimation, who further developed it, with support from General Motors, as the Programmable Universal Machine for Assembly (PUMA). He served briefly as General Manager of Unimation's West Coast division before joining Automatix as a cofounder and vice-president in 1980. While at Automatix, Scheinman developed RobotWorld, a system of cooperating small modules suspended from a 2-D linear motor. The product line was later sold to Yaskawa.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the application of}} a recent approach to path planning for robots with many degrees of freedom (dof) to <b>articulated</b> <b>robots</b> moving in two or three dimensional static environments. The planning approach, which itself is not restricted to <b>articulated</b> <b>robots,</b> consists of a preprocessing and a planning stage. Preprocessing is done only once for a given environment and generates a connected network of randomly, but properly selected, collision-free configurations (nodes). Planning then connects any given initial and final configurations of the robot to two nodes of the network and computes a path through the network between these two nodes. We show that af- ter paying the preprocessing cost (on the order of minutes on a DEC Alpha workstation), planning is extremely fast (ranging from {{a fraction of a second}} to, at most, a few seconds) for many difficult examples involving 7 -dof and 12 -dof robots. The approach is particularly attractive for many-dof robots which have to perform many successive point-to-point motions in the same environment...|$|R

We present a novel framework for motion planning of rigid and <b>articulated</b> <b>robots</b> in complex, dynamic, 3 D environments and demonstrate its application to virtual prototyping. It is based on transforming the motion planning problem into the simulation of a dynamical system. Motion of each rigid robot is subject to the influence of virtual forces induced by all type of geometric constraints. These may include constraints to enforce joint angle limit and connectivity constraints for <b>articulated</b> <b>robots,</b> constraints to enforce a spatial relationship between multiple collaborative robots, or constraints to have the robot follow an estimated path to perform certain tasks in a sequence. The resulting algorithm uses all contributing forces to move the robot along the estimated path, while avoiding collision with obstacles and enforcing joint and positional constraints. Our algorithm works well in dynamic environments with moving obstacles and is applicable to challenging planning scenarios where multiple robots must move simultaneously to achieve a collision free path. We demonstrate its effectiveness on parts removal, automated car painting, and assembly line planning.
