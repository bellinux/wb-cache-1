In this paper, {{we present a}} new discrete scheme for Gaussian curvature, which converges <b>at</b> the <b>regular</b> vertex with valence greater than 4. We show {{that it is impossible}} to build a discrete scheme for Gaussian curvature which converges <b>at</b> the <b>regular</b> vertex with valence 4 by a counterexample. We also study the convergence property of other discrete schemes for Gaussian curvature and compare their asymptotic errors by numerical experiments...|$|R

5|$|Adult frogs {{lay their}} eggs in moist places, {{including}} on leaves, in plants, among exposed roots, and elsewhere. Once the eggs hatch, the adult piggybacks the tadpoles, one at a time, to suitable water, either a pool, or the water gathered in the throat of bromeliads or other plants. The tadpoles remain there until they metamorphose, fed by unfertilized eggs laid <b>at</b> <b>regular</b> intervals by the mother.|$|E

5|$|Decompression may be {{continuous}} or staged, {{where the}} ascent {{is interrupted by}} stops <b>at</b> <b>regular</b> depth intervals, but the entire ascent {{is part of the}} decompression, and ascent rate can be critical to harmless elimination of inert gas. What is commonly known as no-decompression diving, or more accurately no-stop decompression, relies on limiting ascent rate for avoidance of excessive bubble formation.|$|E

The Installation ceremony took place on 22 July 1913 in the Henry VII Chapel, and Installations have been held <b>at</b> <b>regular</b> intervals since.|$|E

RESCU operators monitor the cameras for emergency purposes; local radio and television media use the service for traffic reports.|$|E

5|$|The {{interior}} of the fort was artificially raised by the Romans, using earth dug from the foundation ditch, {{to bring it up}} {{to the level of the}} projecting step on the back of the wall. No evidence of significant buildings within the fort has been found by excavators. A number of Roman hearths are situated <b>at</b> <b>regular</b> intervals in the centre of the fort's interior, suggesting that they may have been the site of wooden barrack blocks. The buildings are conjectured to have been largely timber-framed wattle and daub structures which have left little trace.|$|E
5|$|The present {{building}} {{incorporates the}} chancel from a 13th-century church {{which may have}} replaced a wooden building {{of two or three}} centuries earlier. Additions in the 14thcentury included stone effigies representing a knight and his wife, considered to be excellent examples of such sculptures. More structural changes took place <b>at</b> <b>regular</b> intervals, and a major Victorian restoration by architect Somers Clarke included an extension to the nave and a new tower. English Heritage has listed the church at Grade I because of its architectural and historical importance.|$|E

5|$|The {{principal}} melody in {{this movement}} (E) {{is taken from}} an old Hussar song, for which Prokofiev provided an optional baritone part. The melody first appears in a slow and somewhat dissonant statement, after which the pace quickens: sleigh bells, rapid pizzicato strings, and piano combine {{to give the impression}} of a fast winter's journey by means of the troika, a traditional Russian three-horse sled. The ride is accompanied <b>at</b> <b>regular</b> intervals by the song theme, which brings the movement to its close with a slow repetition of its final phrase.|$|E
5|$|The {{sandstone}} sighting tower, {{the north}} and south portals and the retaining walls to the south portal are all Grade II listed structures. The portals are on Network Rail land with no public access. The southern portal at the Horsforth end is a plain sandstone horseshoe-shaped arch with rusticated voussoirs below a cornice and a parapet. It is approached by a slightly curved 300-metre cutting faced with sandstone retaining walls. They have a concave batter, slightly-projecting piers <b>at</b> <b>regular</b> intervals and are topped with square coping stones.|$|E
