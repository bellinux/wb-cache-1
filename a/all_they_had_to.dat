500|$|Compared to the {{graphical}} changes, {{the artificial}} intelligence (AI) of the computer-controlled characters {{was only slightly}} changed. The justification given was that the team felt the AI worked very well for the first game. <b>All</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> do was to tweak it a little and fix some bugs. There was, however, {{a lot of work}} done in improving the multiplayer portion of the game. For FreeSpace 2, the player's personal computer was assigned a greater role in predicting the possible consequences for other players' actions. This reduced the amount of data needed to be transferred between the computers, which would result in a smoother playing experience. Beta testers were recruited to stress test and troubleshoot the multiplayer mode as well. SquadWar was implemented as an attempt to establish a sense of continuity among the players {{in the form of a}} persistent online territorial fight, along with pilot statistics and ladder rankings. Volition hoped this concept would help to establish a strong, online community and build up the game's lifespan. The process of fixing the bugs detected was even publicly published on the game's official website as the [...] "Bug Fix of the Day" [...] feature.|$|E

[...] He felt that the [...] "biggest shock of all" [...] was the reveal of Rudy as Dexter's brother, and described their confrontation as [...] "riveting". Goldman gave the episode an [...] "incredible" [...] rating of 9.5 out of 10. Paula Paige of TV Guide was [...] "impressed" [...] by Michael Hall's [...] "incredible acting ability," [...] praising his ability to transform from a [...] "stoic killer to overwrought brother {{in a matter of}} moments." [...] She said that the series went [...] "from being a good show to a fantastic show in the course of one season," [...] and hoped that [...] "the sophomore season will be just as terrific." [...] Jonathan Toomey of TV Squad felt {{that it would be a}} [...] "shame" [...] if Hall did not win a Golden Globe Award, saying that he [...] "certainly deserves it." [...] He understood why Rudy wanted to make Debra the brothers' first victim together; Rudy was jealous of the life that Dexter received and killing Debra was the symbol of that life dying. Although Toomey said that the episode was [...] "really well written," [...] he was troubled that no one made the connection between Dexter and Rudy when <b>all</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> do was read Rudy's file, but Toomey speculated that it could be discovered the next season.|$|E

Thus was invented the Show Girl, whose job, unlike the Chorus Girl, was simply to be {{beautiful}} and to model clothes. The Duff Gordon models were already trained in the Lucile Slither to which Ziegfeld added the Ziegfeld Walk, which enabled a girl to descend a staircase in full costume in such a way as to accentuate her natural attributes without appearing ungainly.|$|E
2500|$|After {{the demise}} of the Sr. Huskies, Durham decided to pursue a Junior hockey team. From the early days the team was dubbed the Huskies as well, <b>all</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> do was find a league to play in.

2500|$|Woodhull {{learned how}} to {{infiltrate}} the all-male domain of national politics and arranged to testify on women's suffrage before the House Judiciary Committee. Woodhull argued that women already {{had the right to}} vote— <b>all</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> do was use it— since the 14th and 15th Amendments guaranteed the protection of that right for all citizens. The simple but powerful logic of her argument impressed some committee members.

I wrote the lyric in a few days, then I presented the lyric to Jud." [...] Friedman, who was inspired by Rich's lyric wrote most of the music, then they finished the song together. When it was completed, they recorded a very simple demo with just piano, guitar samples and strings and then brought in Valerie Pinkston to sing the demo.|$|E

John Bratt, the Keystone Cattle Company, and the Bosler Brothers had penetrated along the south rim of the Sandhills, but it wasn't until the spring of 1879 that the economic importance of the Sandhills were discovered. That year storm-driven cattle from the Newman Ranch disappeared South into the Sandhills area previously avoided by cattlemen. An expedition was organized, with ranch foreman Billy Irwin in charge, to venture into the Sandhills and round-up the scattered cattle. During the roundup of those cattle other wild cattle were found, the wild cattle had grown fat even though untended during several winters. On the fourth week out and running low on provisions, the Newman cowboys camped along a lake where <b>all</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> eat was bean soup. They called the lake Bean Soup Lake, four miles (6km) east of what would later become the headquarters of the Spade Ranch. One of the Newman cowboys on the 1879 round-up, was later Omaha mayor James Dahlman.|$|E
