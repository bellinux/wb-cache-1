40|$|AbstractStructural {{changes of}} the brain have been {{detected}} in many early-onset eye diseases, whereas {{little is known about}} whether changes could occur if the onset age is <b>after</b> <b>the</b> sensitive <b>development</b> <b>period.</b> High Myopia {{is a prime example of}} neural plasticity after development, whose case history is usually long. To investigate potential morphological changes in the brain of high myopic patients, we compared a group of 30 adults with high myopia and 30 control subjects using high-resolution anatomic MRI in combination with vision tests. No difference in gray matter (GM) concentration was detected. However, increased concentration of white matter (WM) was observed in patients with high myopia, primarily in the calcarine area. Another three comparatively smaller regions were in the prefrontal and parietal lobe. It can be inferred that cortices developed normally and refractive error in high myopic patients may be compensated by strengthening the correlation between visual cortex and visual related areas. Our study suggests that besides early-onset diseases, the late-onset eye diseases can also affect the structure of brain...|$|R
40|$|Reproductive {{performance}} was evaluated in beef heifers born over a 2 -yr period {{to determine the}} effects of target breeding weight (TBW) and development system (SYS) on growth and subsequent reproductive efficiency. Spring-born Angus heifers (253 ± 0. 7 kg) were randomly allocated over 2 consecutive yr (yr 1, n = 80; yr 2, n = 96) to be developed to either 55 % (350 kg) of mature BW (moderate gain, MG) or 62 % (395 kg) of mature BW (high gain, HG). Each MG and HG group was further assigned to 1 of 2 replicated systems: (1) bale graze bromegrass-alfalfa round bales in field paddocks (BG) or (2) fed bromegrass-alfalfa round bales in drylot pens (DL). Heifers were fed a diet of bromegrassalfalfa hay (56. 9 % TDN; 9. 8 % CP) and barley grain supplement (85. 1 % TDN; 12. 3 % CP). <b>After</b> <b>the</b> 202 -d <b>development</b> <b>period,</b> heifers were exposed to bulls for a 63 -d breeding season. Target BW × SYS interactions were not detected for any measured parameters. During <b>the</b> winter <b>development</b> <b>period,</b> MG heifers had lower (P = 0. 01) ADG than HG heifers and MG heifers had lighter (P = 0. 01) BW at breeding. The proportion of heifers attaining puberty by 14. 5 mo of age was less (P = 0. 05) in MG (20 ± 4 %) than HG heifers (52 ± 3 %). From the end of <b>the</b> 202 -d <b>development</b> <b>period</b> to pregnancy diagnosis, ADG was greater (P = 0. 04) in MG heifers than HG heifers (0. 83 vs. 0. 71 kg/d). First-calf pregnancy rates were 86 and 88 % for MG and HG heifers, respectively (P = 0. 41). Second- and third-calf pregnancy rates of cows, developed in either a MG or HG system as heifers, were not different (P = 0. 74; 94. 7 vs. 95. 9 % and 93. 8 vs. 93. 9 %, respectively). Economic analysis revealed a $ 58 reduced development cost for heifers developed to 55 % compared with 62 % of mature BW without a loss in reproductive performance...|$|R

30|$|The {{results showed}} that <b>the</b> <b>development</b> <b>period</b> was in inverse {{proportion}} to temperature. In other words, as the temperature increases to upper threshold, growth is accelerated {{and the length of}} <b>the</b> <b>development</b> <b>period</b> is reduced. During the growth process, the base threshold temperature for any stage was increasing {{in such a way that}} the minimum threshold of growth temperatures for the egg to first larval instar, first to second instar, second to third instar, third larval to pupal and pupal to adult were considered as 9.72  °C, 11. 14 °C, 13 °C, 14.48  °C and 14.317  °C, respectively. In C.albiceps, the length of <b>the</b> <b>development</b> of each stage relative to <b>the</b> total <b>development</b> <b>period</b> at <b>the</b> temperatures 25 °C and 30 °C were as follows: egg to first larval (9 %, 6. 25 %), first to second larvae (9 %, 12. 5 %), second to third larvae (18 %, 12. 5 %), third larva to pupa (27 %, 25 %), pupal to adult stage (45. 5 %, 44 %) and first larvae to adult was (90 %, 94 %). For C.vicina, the greatest contribution of <b>the</b> <b>development</b> <b>period,</b> in temperatures 15 and 20 °C, is assigned to the pupal to adult period that accounted for 62 and 56 percentage of <b>the</b> total <b>development</b> <b>period,</b> respectively. <b>The</b> <b>development</b> time of third instar larvae to pupa stage were calculated 24 and 25 percentage of the total pre-mature time at 15 °C and 20 °C respectively. Also, <b>the</b> <b>development</b> time from egg to the end of third instar larvae were observed about 14. 24 and 18.57 percentage of the total time at 15 °C and 20 °C respectively. Similar to C.albiceps, the greatest contribution of <b>the</b> <b>development</b> <b>period</b> of C.vicina is assigned to the pupal period. It was quite evident that temperature had a key role, especially in low temperatures, in making significant differences in temperature requirement of growth of ADD in C.vicina at 15 °C and 20 °C. For C.albiceps, the majority of required ADD was related to the immature period, and the same applied to C.vicina. As <b>the</b> larvae <b>development,</b> <b>the</b> amount of ADD increased too such a way that, at temperatures 15 °C and 25 °C, the amount of ADD for the third larvae were determined as 104 °C and 90 °C respectively, and for the pupal stage, it was similar and equal to 234 °C (Table 2).|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT The {{serotoninergic system}} {{controls}} key events related to proper nervous system <b>development.</b> <b>The</b> neurotransmitter serotonin and the serotonin transporter {{are critical for}} this control. Availability of these components is minutely regulated during <b>the</b> <b>development</b> <b>period,</b> and <b>the</b> environment may affect their action on the nervous system. Environmental factors such as undernutrition and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors may increase the availability of serotonin in the synaptic cleft and change its anorectic action. The physiological responses promoted by serotonin on intake control decrease when requested by acute stimuli or stress, demonstrating that animals or individuals develop adaptations {{in response to the}} environmental insults they experience during <b>the</b> <b>development</b> <b>period.</b> Diseases, such as anxiety and obesity, appear {{to be associated with the}} body’s response to stress or stimulus, and require greater serotonergic system action.
