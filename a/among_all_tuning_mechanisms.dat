40|$|While {{reproducing}} {{experimental results}} of research articles is standard practice in mature domains of science, such as physics or biology, {{it has not}} yet become mainstream in computer architecture. However, recent research shows that the lack of a fair and broad comparison of research ideas can be significantly detrimental to the progress, and thus the productivity, of research. At the same time, the complexity of architecture simulators and the fact that simulators are not systematically disseminated with novel ideas are largely responsible for this situation. While this methodology has a fundamental impact on research, it is by essence a practical issue. In this article, we present and put to task an atypical approach which aims at overcoming this practical methodology issue, and which {{takes the form of a}}n open and continuous exploration through a server-side web infrastructure. First, rather than requiring from a researcher to engage in the daunting task of seeking, installing and running the simulators of many alternative mechanisms, we propose that researchers upload their simulator to the infrastructure, where the corresponding mechanism is automatically compared against all known ideas so far. Second, the comparison takes the form of a broad compiler/hardware exploration, so that a new mechanism is deemed superior only if it can outperform a <b>tuned</b> baseline and <b>all</b> known <b>tuned</b> <b>mechanisms,</b> for a given area and/or power budget. These two principles considerably facilitate a fair and quantitative comparison of research ideas. The web infrastructure is now publicly open, and we put the overall approach to task with a set of data cache mechanisms. We explain how the tools and methodological issues of contributed simulators can be overcome, and we show that this broad exploration can challenge some earlier assessments about data cache research. 1...|$|R

40|$|Tunable fiber Bragg {{gratings}} (FBGs) are {{key components}} for optical communications and sensing applications. Current <b>tuning</b> <b>mechanisms</b> include on-fiber electric heating, the piezo-electric effect, and mechanical stretching and bending. Unfortunately, <b>all</b> of these <b>tuning</b> <b>mechanisms</b> rely on external electrical power supplied by non-optical means. Additional electrical cabling increases manufacturing cost {{and the risks}} of failure associated with additional on-fiber electrical contacts and fragile packaging, which are susceptible to electromagnetic interference. These limitations make current fiber components no longer suitable for use in hostile environments, such as extreme temperature, corrosive, and humid environments. The research herein presents a tunable fiber Bragg grating device without sophisticated packaging and external electrical wiring. Shown for the first time, the resonance wavelength, spectrum width, and chirp can be directly controlled by in-fiber light as well as spectral responses of metal-coated fiber Bragg gratings. In-fiber diode laser light at 910 -nm was leaked from the fiber and absorbed by the surrounding metallic coating to raise the grating's temperature and to change the background refractive index distribution of the gratings. Wide tunability of the resonance wavelength and spectral width was demonstrated in both uniform and linear chirped gratings. Applications of in-fiber light-powered active grating sensors are demonstrated for dual function temperature and flow sensors based on self-heated optical hot wire anemometry. A grating flow sensor has been experimentally evaluated for different grating lengths and input laser powers. The grating flow sensor demonstrated a minimum measurable flow velocity for nitrogen gas flow of 0. 35 -m/s at atmosphere pressure, which is comparable to or better than most MEMS-based flow sensors. Optical fiber is not used only for optical signal delivery, {{but also as a}} multi-function cable that can deliver optical power for on-fiber self-heating. This one-fiber solution provides a new dimension to designing multifunctional fiber sensors without compromising their intrinsic advantages, which include immunity to electromagnetic fields, low cost, long lifetime, and the capability to function in harsh environments...|$|R

40|$|Uncooled microbolometers have {{attracted}} significant interest {{due to their}} small size, low cost and low power consumption. As the application range of microbolometers broadens, increasing the dynamic range becomes {{one of the main}} objectives of microbolometer research. Targeting this objective, tunable thermal conductance microbolometers have been proposed recently, in which the thermal conductance is tuned by electrostatic actuation. Being a new concept in the field, the current tunable thermal conductance microbolometers have significant potential for improvement in design and performance. In this thesis, an extensive analysis of tunable thermal conductance microbolometers is made, an analytical model is constructed for this purpose, and solutions are proposed to some potential problems such as in-use stiction and variation in spectral response. The current thermal conductance <b>tuning</b> <b>mechanisms</b> use the substrate for electrostatic actuation, which does not support pixel-by-pixel actuation. In this thesis, a new thermal conductance <b>tuning</b> <b>mechanism</b> is demonstrated, that enables pixel-by-pixel actuation by using the micromirror as an actuation terminal instead of the substrate. In addition, a stopper mechanism is used to decrease the risk of in-use stiction. With this new mechanism, the thermal conductance can be tuned by a factor of three at relatively low voltages, making it a promising thermal conductance <b>tuning</b> <b>mechanism</b> for adaptive infrared detectors. Effective estimation of the performance parameters of a tunable thermal conductance microbolometer in the design state requires an analytical model that combines the physics of infrared radiation detection and the thermal conductance <b>tuning</b> <b>mechanisms.</b> As a part of this research, an extensive analytical model is presented, which includes the electrostatic-structural modeling of the thermal conductance <b>tuning</b> <b>mechanism,</b> and electromagnetic and thermal modeling of the microbolometer. The accuracy of the thermal model is of significant importance as the operation of the <b>tuning</b> <b>mechanism</b> within the desired range should be verified in the design stage. A thermal model based on the solution of the microbolometer heat conduction equation is established, which is easily applicable to conventional and tunable thermal conductance microbolometers of various shapes. The constructed microbolometer model is validated by experiments and finite element model simulations. Furthermore, the effect of thermal conductance tuning on spectral response is analyzed. The present thermal conductance <b>tuning</b> <b>mechanisms</b> result in variations in spectral response, which is an undesired effect in many applications. As a solution, a new microbolometer architecture is proposed, in which the spectral response is not affected by thermal conductance. The microbolometer is designed using an analytical model and its performance is characterized by finite element model simulations. To realize the proposed design, a fabrication process flow is offered. It is shown that the proposed microbolometer exhibits high performance, tunable thermal conductance and constant spectral response...|$|R

40|$|Large {{spectral}} tuning of a water–glycerol microdroplet {{standing on}} a superhydrophobic surface by local heating with a focused infrared laser is studied both experimentally by optical spectroscopy and computationally using a lumped system formulation of the mass and heat transfer between the microdroplet and the chamber. The effects of optical scattering force, chamber humidity, size of microdroplet and laser power on the <b>tuning</b> <b>mechanism</b> are examined. The reversibility of the <b>tuning</b> <b>mechanism</b> is also studied. In spite of its negligibly small volatility {{compared to that of}} water, irreversibility is found to be mainly caused by evaporation of glycerol. It is also found that reversibility increases dramatically with the relative water and glycerol humidities, and spectral tuning can be made almost fully reversible when the chamber is saturated with glycerol vapor and the relative water humidity approaches unity. Some hysteresis effects are observed, especially in large microdroplets, and this behavior is attributed to the whispering-gallery mode resonances in laser absorption. The time response of the <b>tuning</b> <b>mechanism</b> is also analyzed both experimentally and computationally. The technique presented can find applications in optical communication systems, and can be used in fundamental studies in cavity quantum electrodynamics and in characterizing liquid aerosols on a surface.

40|$|The shortwave-sensitive class I {{of visual}} {{pigments}} in vertebrates has the widest variation in peak sensibility, ranging from ultraviolet (355 - 390 nm) to violet (390 - 440 nm). Phylogenetic {{evidence indicates that}} the ancestral pigment was probably UV-sensitive (UVS) and that the shifts between violet and UV have occurred several times throughout vertebrate evolution. These appear to be two major <b>tuning</b> <b>mechanisms</b> present in vertebrates: one in the non-avian vertebrates {{and one in the}} avian group. Avian UVS pigments have Cys 90 while VS pigments have Ser 90. Non-avian UVS pigments have Phe 86, which is replaced in VS pigments. The objective of this project has been to extend our understanding of the molecular basis of SWS 1 pigment tuning by addressing whether the effect of the residues present at these sites are consistent across different vertebrate orders. Within the mammalian order, it has been possible to elucidate the SWS 1 <b>tuning</b> <b>mechanism</b> within the rodent lineage, showing that the VS pigment in the grey squirrel has a different <b>tuning</b> <b>mechanism</b> compared to the guinea pig and that nocturnal flying squirrels have dispensed with colour vision. The visual system of the platypus, a montreme from the bases of the mammalian radiation has also been investigated and shown to have retained colour vision by a different route from all other mammals. An analysis of the <b>tuning</b> <b>mechanism</b> of primate VS pigments has shown that violet-sensitivity was achieved though a unique mechanism. In the avian order the results have shown that the ancestral avian pigment became VS through a Ser 86 substitution and only later did extant bird species utilize site 90 to re-create UV sensitivity. The presence of UVS pigments has also been investigated in long-lived parrot species; partial sequences have revealed that all species possess Cys 90, indicating the presence of a UVS pigment in fifteen species of parrots...|$|R
40|$|We used a noise-masking {{paradigm}} {{to investigate}} the number and properties of chromatic mechanisms involved in image segmentation. Observers were presented with a pattern of dynamic random squares, each independently modulated along a certain direction in DKL color space, either in the isoluminant plane or in the L j M luminance plane. A signal consisting of a rectangular region of squares, oriented horizontally or vertically, {{was added to the}} noise. The signal squares were spatially and temporally aligned to the noise squares, excluding the possibility of phase offsets to mediate segmentation performance. Noise and signal color directions were independently varied, and the signal contrast was measured at which an observer could reliably indicate the orientation of the signal. In a second set of experiments, the noise was simultaneously varying in two directions, symmetrically arranged around the signal direction. Masking was generally highest when signal and noise were modulated along the same direction and minimal for orthogonal noise. No difference was found between signals modulated along cardinal directions or intermediate directions. However, measured tuning widths critically depended on the type of noise: Noise modulated along one direction results in narrow tuning, whereas two-sided noise results in broad tuning. A chromatic detection model with multiple broadly <b>tuned</b> <b>mechanisms</b> successfully accounts for the experimental findings, both for narrow and broad tuning curves. Models with four broadly <b>tuned</b> cardinal <b>mechanisms</b> or multiple narrowly <b>tuned</b> <b>mechanisms</b> failed to reproduce the data.
