5|$|Fox {{ran with}} an unusual gait, as he was {{required}} to hop-step on his good leg due to the extra time the springs in his artificial leg required to reset after each step. He found the training painful as the additional pressure he had to place on both his good leg and his stump led to bone bruises, blisters and intense pain. Fox found that after about 20minutes of each run, he crossed <b>a</b> <b>pain</b> threshold and the run became easier.|$|E
5|$|Quwatli had a {{heart attack}} shortly after the Six Day War (5–10 June 1967). Feeling <b>a</b> <b>pain</b> in his chest he was taken to a {{hospital}} on 29 June. He died in Beirut on 30 June. According to Syrian historian Sami Moubayed, Quwatli died after learning of the defeat of the Syrian and Arab armies. The Ba'athist-dominated government refused to allow Quwatli's body to be buried in Damascus and only relented after diplomatic pressure from King Faisal of Saudi Arabia. An honorary funeral organized by the state was held for him on 1 July.|$|E
5|$|Writing in the Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy, Michael Tooley {{rejected}} the Irenaean theodicy as unsatisfactory. He {{argued that the}} magnitude of suffering experienced by some people is excessive, supporting Eleanor Stump's view that the suffering endured by those with terminal illnesses cannot be for moral development, and that such illnesses do not fall more often upon those seemingly immoral or in need of development. He also challenged the suffering both of animals and of young children. Neither of these instances of suffering serve any useful purpose, as they cannot lead to moral development. Finally, he questioned whether the current universe is the best possible world for the moral development of humans. Citing the examples of those who die young and those who experience too great <b>a</b> <b>pain</b> to learn from it, {{as well as people}} who suffer too little to learn anything, he suggested that this world is not ideally suited to human development.|$|E

40|$|Piezosurgery® is a {{recently}} developed system for cutting bone with microvibrations. The {{objective of this}} study was to compare the severity of pain over the first 10 postoperative days in a group of 70 patients who underwent intact canal wall mastoidectomy, with the piezoelectric device, and to compare the results with traditional method by means of microdrill (70 patients). The subjective perception of pain was evaluated on a scale from 0 to 10, such that 0 represented no pain and 10 represented maximum pain; the severity was recorded as null when the score was 0; slight, when it was 1 - 4; moderate, when it was 5 - 7; or severe, when it was 8 - 10. Compared with microdrill, the patients that underwent surgery with the piezoelectric device showed a significant (P < 0. 05) lower postoperative pain on day 1 (52 vs. 26 patients presented <b>a</b> slight <b>pain,</b> 12 vs. 37 presented <b>a</b> moderate <b>pain,</b> and 6 vs. 7 presented <b>a</b> severe <b>pain)</b> and day 3 (68 vs. 44 patients presented <b>a</b> slight <b>pain,</b> 2 vs. 23 presented <b>a</b> moderate <b>pain,</b> and 0 vs. 3 presented <b>a</b> severe <b>pain).</b> These results highlight as the piezoelectric device is a safe and minimally invasive tool...|$|R
25|$|Menthol's {{analgesic}} {{properties are}} mediated through a selective activation of κ-opioid receptors.

25|$|In Eastern culture, opium is more {{commonly}} used {{in the form of}} paregoric to treat diarrhea. This is a weaker solution than laudanum, an alcoholic tincture which was prevalently used as <b>a</b> <b>pain</b> medication and sleeping aid. Tincture of opium has been prescribed for, among other things, severe diarrhea. Taken thirty minutes prior to meals, it significantly slows intestinal motility, giving the intestines greater time to absorb fluid in the stool.|$|E

25|$|The {{drug was}} first marketed {{to the general}} public by Sertürner and Company in 1817 as <b>a</b> <b>pain</b> medication, and also as a {{treatment}} for opium and alcohol addiction. It was first used as a poison in 1822 when Dr. Edme Castaing of France was convicted of murdering a patient. Commercial production began in Darmstadt, Germany in 1827 by the pharmacy that became the pharmaceutical company Merck, with morphine sales being a large part of their early growth. In the 1850s Alexander Wood reported that he had injected morphine into his wife as an experiment; his wife died from respiratory depression.|$|E
25|$|Early {{symptoms}} are malaise and lethargy. Even earlier might be <b>a</b> <b>pain</b> {{in a section}} of the gums which interferes with digestion. After 1–3 months, patients develop shortness of breath and bone pain. Myalgias may occur because of reduced carnitine production. Other symptoms include skin changes with roughness, easy bruising and petechiae, gum disease, loosening of teeth, poor wound healing, and emotional changes (which may appear before any physical changes). Dry mouth and dry eyes similar to Sjögren's syndrome may occur. In the late stages, jaundice, generalized edema, oliguria, neuropathy, fever, convulsions, and eventual death are frequently seen.|$|E
25|$|Morphine is <b>a</b> <b>pain</b> {{medication}} of the opiate type {{which is}} found naturally {{in a number}} of plants and animals. It acts directly on the central nervous system (CNS) to decrease the feeling of pain. It can be taken for both acute pain and chronic pain. Morphine is frequently used for pain from myocardial infarction and during labour. It can be given by mouth, by injection into a muscle, by injecting under the skin, intravenously, into the space around the spinal cord, or rectally. Maximum effect is around 20minutes when given intravenously and 60min when given by mouth, while duration of effect is between 3h and 7h. Long-acting formulations also exist.|$|E

25|$|It was {{not until}} the Tudors, {{specifically}} the reign of Henry VIII (1506-1547), that crown control started to once again extend throughout Ireland. Having declared himself King of Ireland in 1541, Henry VIII went about converting Irish chiefs into feudal subjects of the crown with land divided into districts, which were eventually amalgamated into the modern counties. County boundaries were still ill-defined; however, in 1543 Meath was split into Meath and Westmeath. Around 1545, the Byrnes and O'Tooles, both native septs who had constantly been <b>a</b> <b>pain</b> for the English administration of the Pale, petitioned the Lord Deputy of Ireland to turn their district into its own county, Wicklow, however this was ignored.|$|E
25|$|At {{his first}} {{competition}} of the season, Skate Canada Autumn Classic International, he received 112.72 points for his short program. Hanyu cleanly executed the quadruple Salchow, the triple Axel and the quadruple toe loop-triple toe loop combination, breaking {{the world record}} he had set previously at the 2015-16 Grand Prix Final (110.95). In this competition, due to <b>a</b> <b>pain</b> in his right knee, the quadruple loop jump {{was replaced by the}} quadruple Salchow. During the free skating, Hanyu popped the opening jump into a single Lutz and fell on a triple Axel, which was uncharacteristic for him. He also had troubles with other jumps and his quadruple toe loop was downgraded for a two-footed landing. He got a score of 155.52 points, and was surpassed by Fernández.|$|E

25|$|In 1958, Hughes {{told his}} aides {{that he wanted}} to screen some movies at a film studio near his home. He stayed in the studio's darkened {{screening}} room for more than four months, never leaving. He ate only chocolate bars and chicken and drank only milk, and was surrounded by dozens of Kleenex boxes that he continuously stacked and re-arranged. He wrote detailed memos to his aides giving them explicit instructions not to look at him nor speak to him unless spoken to. Throughout this period, Hughes sat fixated in his chair, often naked, continually watching movies. When he finally emerged in the summer of 1958, his hygiene was terrible. He had not bathed nor cut his hair and nails for weeks; this may have been due to allodynia, which results in <b>a</b> <b>pain</b> response to stimuli that would normally not cause pain.|$|E
25|$|In April 1413 a {{group of}} Midlands gentry, led by William Lichfield, Cornwall's son-in-law, made mainprise of £100 for him at Westminster and he undertook, under <b>a</b> <b>pain</b> of £500, to do no harm to anyone. This was a prelude to a case tried at Court of King's Bench at Shrewsbury in Trinity term. Henry V was present in person, along with William Hankford, the Chief Justice of the King's Bench, in {{response}} to complaints about the prevalence of bad governance and murder in Shropshire made at the Fire and Faggot Parliament in Leicester, earlier that year. The business was dominated by the aftermath of large-scale violence between the Arundel affinity and the followers of Lord Furnival in 1413. However, Cornwall was accused of procuring Henry Cornwall of Catsley, possibly his own illegitimate son, to commit a murder and of harbouring him after the event. Henry {{seems to have had}} a reputation for violence, as he was also accused of a serious assault on a cleric in 1412. The murder had taken place in August 1413 at Sir John Cornwall's own manorial court in Kinlet, emphasising the likelihood of his complicity.|$|E
