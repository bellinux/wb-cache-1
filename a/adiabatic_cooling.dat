5|$|A tornado is not {{necessarily}} visible; however, the intense low pressure caused by the high wind speeds (as described by Bernoulli's principle) and rapid rotation (due to cyclostrophic balance) usually cause water vapor {{in the air to}} condense into cloud droplets due to <b>adiabatic</b> <b>cooling.</b> This results in the formation of a visible funnel cloud or condensation funnel.|$|E
5|$|There {{are four}} main {{mechanisms}} for cooling {{the air to}} its dew point: <b>adiabatic</b> <b>cooling,</b> conductive cooling, radiational cooling, and evaporative cooling. <b>Adiabatic</b> <b>cooling</b> occurs when air rises and expands. The air can rise due to convection, large-scale atmospheric motions, or a physical barrier such as a mountain (orographic lift). Conductive cooling occurs when the air comes into contact with a colder surface, usually by being blown from one surface to another, for example from a liquid water surface to colder land. Radiational cooling occurs due to the emission of infrared radiation, either by the air or by the surface underneath. Evaporative cooling occurs when moisture {{is added to the}} air through evaporation, which forces the air temperature to cool to its wet-bulb temperature, or until it reaches saturation.|$|E
5|$|Orographic or relief {{snowfall}} {{is caused}} when masses of air pushed by wind are forced {{up the side}} of elevated land formations, such as large mountains. The lifting of air {{up the side of}} a mountain or range results in <b>adiabatic</b> <b>cooling,</b> and ultimately condensation and precipitation. Moisture is removed by orographic lift, leaving drier, warmer air on the descending, leeward side. The resulting enhanced productivity of snow fall and the decrease in temperature with elevation means that snow depth and seasonal persistence of snowpack increases with elevation in snow-prone areas.|$|E

Surface corrugation has a relatively obvious influence on the laterally-averaged <b>adiabatic</b> film <b>cooling</b> effectiveness in the region where the effusion film layer is developed, but has little influence in the front region.

5|$|All winds on Venus are {{ultimately}} driven by convection. Hot air {{rises in the}} equatorial zone, where solar heating is concentrated, and flows to the poles. Such an almost-planetwide overturning of the troposphere is called Hadley circulation. However, the meridional air motions are much slower than zonal winds. The poleward limit of the planet wide Hadley cell on Venus is near ±60° latitudes. Here air starts to descend {{and returns to the}} equator below the clouds. This interpretation is supported by the distribution of the carbon monoxide, which is also concentrated in the vicinity of ±60° latitudes. Poleward of the Hadley cell a different pattern of circulation is observed. In the latitude range 60°–70° cold polar collars exist. They are characterised by temperatures about 30–40K lower than in the upper troposphere at nearby latitudes. The lower temperature is probably caused by the upwelling of the air in them and by the resulting <b>adiabatic</b> <b>cooling.</b> Such an interpretation is supported by the denser and higher clouds in the collars. The clouds lie at 70–72km altitude in the collars—about 5km higher than at the poles and low latitudes. A connection may exist between the cold collars and high speed midlatitude jets in which winds blow as fast as 140m/s. Such jets are a natural consequence of the Hadley–type circulation and should exist on Venus between 55–60° latitude.|$|E

25|$|<b>Adiabatic</b> <b>cooling</b> {{occurs when}} {{one or more}} of three {{possible}} lifting agents – cyclonic/frontal, convective, or orographic – causes air containing invisible water vapor to rise and cool to its dew point, the temperature at which the air becomes saturated. The main mechanism behind this process is <b>adiabatic</b> <b>cooling.</b> If the air is cooled to its dew point and becomes saturated, it normally sheds vapor it can no longer retain, which condenses into cloud. Water vapor in saturated air is normally attracted to condensation nuclei such as dust and salt particles that are small enough to be held aloft by normal circulation of the air.|$|E

40|$|The {{effects of}} blowing and suction on the steady {{compressible}} boundary-layer flow with adverse pressure gradient and heat transfer over a wedge are numerically examined. The fluid {{is considered to}} be a compressible, viscous and Newtonian ideal gas (air) and it is subjected to a constant velocity of suction/injection applied globally to the wedge or locally to specific slots on the surface. The Reynolds-Averaged Boundary-Layer (RABL) equations and their boundary conditions are transformed using the compressible Falkner-Skan transformation. The resulting coupled and nonlinear system of PDEs is solved using the Keller box method. For the eddy-kinematic viscosity the turbulent models of Cebeci-Smith and Baldwin-Lomax are employed. For the turbulent Prandtl number the extended model of Kays-Crawford is used. Numerical calculations are carried out for the case of an <b>adiabatic,</b> <b>cooled</b> or heated wall and for different values of the dimensionless pressure-gradient parameter (m).

The present study aims at numerical investigation of <b>adiabatic</b> film <b>cooling</b> effectiveness over the cylindrical hole exit flat plate test model. The hole inclination angle of 20 ° with stream wise direction is considered. The test model has 35 film cooling holes arranged in two rows in a staggered configuration with the coolant hole length to diameter ratio of 5. 4 and pitch to diameter ratio of 4. During the experimental analysis, the <b>adiabatic</b> film <b>cooling</b> effectiveness is found at five different blowing ratios in the range of 0. 5 to 2. 5 with the coolant to mainstream density ratio at 1. 6. The laterally averaged film cooling effectiveness is calculated along the stream wise direction at these blowing ratios. The realizable k-epsilon turbulence model with enhanced wall function is used to solve the flow field. The CFD obtained results are validated with the experimental results at a blowing ratio of 1. 0. Further, the CFD analysis is done for other blowing ratios in the range of 0. 5 to 4. 0 at density ratios of 1. 6, 1. 8 and 2. 0. From the CFD results, the laterally averaged film cooling effectiveness is found to be increasing with the increase in blowing ratio up to 1. 5 immediately downstream of the coolant holes.

40|$|There {{have been}} several studies on {{biopolymer}} synthesis under hydrothermal conditions. Although dimer and short oligomers were obtained from a monomer unit, few of longer oligomers were obtained.

The linear dispersion relation derived for electrostatic waves demonstrates a weak dependence of the phase speed on physical conditions of positrons in appropriate ranges of parameters. The Sagdeev's pseudopotential approach is used to obtain the existence of electrostatic solitary wave structures, focusing on how their characteristics depend on the physical conditions of positrons and suprathermal electrons. Both negative and positive polarity electrostatic solitary waves are found to exist in different ranges of Mach numbers. As the positrons constitute {{a small fraction of}} the total number density, they slightly affect the existence domains. However, the positrons can significantly change the wave potential at a fixed soliton speed. The results indicate that the positive potential can greatly be grown by increasing the electron suprathermality (lower κ) at a fixed true Mach number. It is found that a fraction of positrons maintain the generation of positive polarity electrostatic solitary waves in the presence of suprathermal electrons in pair plasmas.
