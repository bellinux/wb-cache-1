5|$|French {{breeding}} of the Mérens is divided between two schools of thought. The first is traditional breeders seeking {{to preserve the}} original type, that of a light draft horse living high in the mountains year-round and retaining the hardiness for which the breed is known. The second comes from {{the conversion of the}} Mérens to a leisure horse in the 1980s, <b>and</b> <b>aims</b> to transform the physical type of the breed into a more sports-oriented horse to ensure the survival of the breed. This dichotomy has become a source of tension between farmers and users of the breed.|$|E

The end <b>and</b> <b>aim,</b> he says, of hearing Christ, the end <b>and</b> <b>aim</b> of {{learning}} the truth {{as it is in}} Jesus, is this--that we may be renewed in the spirit of our minds, and put on the new man, which after God is created in righteousness and true holiness. To put on the new man; the new pattern of manhood, which is after the pattern of the Son of man, Jesus Christ, and therefore after the pattern and likeness of God. To be followers, that is, copiers and imitators of God, that (so says St. Paul) is the end <b>and</b> <b>aim</b> of religion. In one word, we are to be good; and religion, according to St. Paul, is neither more nor less than the act of becoming good, like the good God.|$|R

5|$|Libraries in Denmark {{are also}} {{cultural}} and community centres.

Dokk1 also includes civil administrations and services, commercial office rentals and a large underground robotic car park <b>and</b> <b>aims</b> to be a landmark for the city and a public meeting place. The building of Dokk1 and the associated squares and streetscape is also collectively known as Urban Mediaspace Aarhus and it is the largest construction project Aarhus municipality has ever undertaken.

5|$|Many {{problems}} in data analysis concern clustering, grouping data items into clusters of closely related items. Hierarchical clustering is {{a version of}} cluster analysis in which the clusters form a hierarchy or tree-like structure rather than a strict partition of the data items. In some cases, this type of clustering may be performed {{as a way of}} performing cluster analysis at multiple different scales simultaneously. In others, the data to be analyzed naturally has an unknown tree structure and the goal is to recover that structure by performing the analysis. Both of these kinds of analysis can be seen, for instance, in the application of hierarchical clustering to biological taxonomy. In this application, different living things are grouped into clusters at different scales or levels of similarity (species, genus, family, etc). This analysis simultaneously gives a multi-scale grouping of the organisms of the present age, <b>and</b> <b>aims</b> to accurately reconstruct the branching process or evolutionary tree that in past ages produced these organisms.|$|E

It may spin in the vertical axis, horizontal axis, or just fly without spinning. The spin may also vary in speed. A lethal throw is given a spin <b>and</b> <b>aimed</b> at the neck. A non-lethal throw is given a spin <b>and</b> <b>aimed</b> at the ankles or knees. This is to capture a fleeing victim. A simple hurting blow {{does not have any}} spin.|$|R
