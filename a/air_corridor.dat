25|$|Macdonald–Cartier Airport {{is part of}} Canada's busiest <b>air</b> <b>corridor</b> between Ottawa, Montreal, and Toronto, {{which is}} {{commonly}} referred to as the Eastern Triangle. The airport is also a gateway for flights to the eastern Arctic via Iqaluit. While Ottawa's airport serves many major North American airlines and has flights to Europe, and several cities in the United States, Ottawa is the largest metropolitan area of Canada which is not a hub for any airline.|$|E
25|$|Slowly, however, an airlift of {{unprecedented}} scale {{began to take}} shape. Construction of four new bases was begun in 1942, and by 1944 the operation flew from six all-weather airfields in Assam. By July 1945 the <b>air</b> <b>corridor</b> from India began at thirteen airfields strung out along the Northeast Indian Railways in the Brahmaputra valley, with seven in Assam, four in the Bengal valley, and two near Calcutta, and terminated at six Chinaside airfields around Kunming.|$|E
25|$|With the {{beginning}} of the Berlin Airlift in 1948 this, however, changed radically. The Western allies, the United States, the United Kingdom and France, were looking for additional air bases that could be utilised for the airlift. Strategically, Celle offered favourable conditions for supply flights being located {{at the end of the}} middle <b>air</b> <b>corridor</b> to Berlin and having the shortest distance to Berlin. Unlike other air bases, Celle was not completely handed over to the United States Air Force but remained under the control of the Royal Air Force even though the aircraft using the airfield were American.|$|E

25|$|At 2340 GMT, {{when the}} DC-4 was {{cruising}} at 9,000ft and roughly 10 {{miles east of}} the international <b>air</b> <b>corridor</b> line off Hainan Island and only 31 minutes from Hong Kong, two Lavochkin La-11 fighters (of the 85th Fighter Regiment, People's Liberation Army Air Force), appeared behind VR-HEU, one above it on the DC-4's starboard rear side and the other on its port side. At approximately 2344 GMT, the fighters opened fire and the two outboard engines (numbers 1 and 4) were hit and caught fire. The number 4 engine's auxiliary and main fuel tanks were also ablaze.|$|E
25|$|In {{an attempt}} to gain a {{presence}} on the busy Washington–New York–Boston commuter <b>air</b> <b>corridor,</b> the Ransome acquisition was accompanied by the $100million purchase of New York Air's shuttle service between Boston, New York, and Washington, D.C. This parallel move was intended to enable Pan Am to provide a high-frequency service for high-yield business travelers in direct competition with the long-established, successful Eastern Air Lines Shuttle operation. The renamed Pan Am Shuttle began operating out of LaGuardia Airport's refurbished historic Marine Air Terminal in October 1986. However, it {{did not address the}} pressing issue of Pan Am's continuing lack of a strong domestic feeder network.|$|E
25|$|On 29 April 1952 an Air France Douglas C-54A (registration F-BELI) {{operating}} {{an internal}} German scheduled service from Frankfurt Rhein-Main Airport to Berlin Tempelhof Airport came under sustained attack from two Soviet MiG 15 fighters while passing {{through one of}} the Allied air corridors over East Germany. Although the attack had severely damaged the plane, necessitating the shutdown of engines number three and four, the pilot in command of the aircraft managed to carry out a safe emergency landing at Tempelhof Airport. A subsequent inspection of the aircraft's damage at Tempelhof revealed that it had been hit by 89 shots fired from the Soviet MiGs during the preceding air attack. There were no fatalities among the 17 occupants (six crew, eleven passengers) despite the severity of the attack. The Soviet military authorities defended this attack on an unarmed civilian aircraft by claiming the Air France plane was outside the <b>air</b> <b>corridor</b> at the time of attack.|$|E

25|$|The {{visit of}} Pope John Paul II to Ireland in September {{proved to be}} a welcome break for Lynch from the day-to-day running of the country. In November, just before Lynch {{departed}} on a visit to the United States he decided that he would resign {{at the end of the}} year. This would allow him to complete his term as President of the European Community. The defining event which made up his mind was the news that Fianna Fáil had lost two by-elections in his native Cork (Cork City and Cork North-East, both on 7 November). In addition during the trip Lynch claimed in an interview with the Washington Post that a five-kilometre <b>air</b> <b>corridor</b> between the border was agreed upon during the meeting with Thatcher to enhance security co-operation This was something highly unsavoury to many in Fianna Fáil. When Lynch returned he was confronted openly by Síle de Valera, Dr Bill Loughnane, a noted hardline Republican backbencher, along with Tom McEllistrim, a member of Haughey's gang of five, at a parliamentary party meeting. Lynch stated that the British did not have permission to overfly the border. Afterwards Loughnane went public with the details of the meeting and accused Lynch of deliberately misleading the party. An attempt to remove the whip from Loughnane failed. At this stage Lynch's position had become untenable, with supporters of Haughey caucusing opinion within the party.|$|E

2500|$|For {{commercial}} and operational reasons, the airlines had their flights routed through the centre corridor whenever possible {{as this was}} the shortest of the three air corridors, thereby minimising the time aircraft spent cruising at [...] At such a low altitude, modern jet aircraft could not attain an efficient cruising speed. This extended flight times and increased fuel consumption. Therefore, use of the centre <b>air</b> <b>corridor</b> was the least uneconomical option.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to these recommendations, the NTSB also recommended that the Department of Defense restrict high-speed, low-altitude aircraft operation in civilian <b>air</b> <b>corridors,</b> consider collision avoidance technologies on military aircraft, and make military pilots aware of the FAA's radar advisory service.|$|R
50|$|The new civil {{aviation}} authority began to exercise control over airports, <b>air</b> <b>corridors</b> and routing, ground aviation infrastructure and the responsibility for entering into and signing aviation accords with other states.

500|$|Congressmen Sherman P. Lloyd (R-Utah) and Henry S.

In actuality, the 360° aileron roll maneuver the fighter pilot executed was to observe any air traffic above or below the aircraft. Lloyd said that military aircraft should be required to establish contact with air traffic controllers when entering high-traffic <b>air</b> <b>corridors</b> and around airports, while Reuss advocated the complete ban of military aircraft from any high-traffic civilian <b>air</b> <b>corridors.</b> Senator Frank Moss (D-Utah) sponsored a bill in December that would require the installation of anti-collision gear on all aircraft by 1975.|$|R

2500|$|In particular, Iran {{expressed}} {{skepticism about}} claims of mis-identification, noting that Vincennes had advanced Aegis radar that correctly tracked the flight and its Mode III beacon; two other U.S. warships in the area, Sides and Montgomery, identified the aircraft as civilian; {{and the flight}} was well within a recognized international <b>air</b> <b>corridor.</b> It {{also noted that the}} crew of Vincennes was trained to handle simultaneous attacks by hundreds of enemy aircraft.

2500|$|Contemporary {{air traffic}} control {{procedures}} prohibited overtaking in the air corridors to ensure a safe operating environment inside these narrow air lanes and to prevent aircraft from accidentally straying into East German airspace. This compelled jet aircraft crews to reduce their speed if the preceding aircraft was a slower-flying piston or turboprop plane.
