5|$|Apatosaurus louisae {{was named}} by Holland in 1916, being first known from a partial {{skeleton}} {{that was found}} in Utah. The holotype is CM3018, with referred specimens including CM3378, CM11162, and LACM52844. The former two consist of a vertebral column; the latter two consist of a skull and a nearly complete skeleton, respectively. Apatosaurus louisae specimens <b>all</b> <b>come</b> <b>from</b> the late Kimmeridgian of Dinosaur National Monument. In 2015 Tschopp etal. found the type specimen of Apatosaurus laticollis to nest closely with CM3018, meaning the former is likely a junior synonym of A.louisae.|$|E
5|$|Lagrivea is {{a fossil}} genus of {{squirrel}} from the Middle Miocene of France. The single species, L. vireti, is known from three mandibles (lower jaws) and two isolated teeth. <b>All</b> <b>come</b> <b>from</b> the fissure filling (a fossil deposit formed when a rock fissure filled with sediment) of La Grive L5, {{part of the}} La Grive-Saint-Alban complex in Saint-Alban-de-Roche, southeastern France. Lagrivea was a large tree squirrel with flat lower incisors and a large, triangular fourth lower premolar (p4). Each of the four cheekteeth (p4 and three molars, m1 through m3) bears a deep basin {{in the middle of}} the crown. The m3 is about rectangular in shape, but rounded at the back. Although m1 and m2 have two roots, m3 has three.|$|E
5|$|Among the {{surviving}} Early Middle Ages sources, {{there are six}} that mention Helmichis by name. Of these, the only contemporary one is the Chronica of Marius of Avenches, written in the 580s. Marius was bishop of Aventicum, a town located in the western Alps in the Frankish Kingdom of Burgundy. Because of the small distance from Aventicum to the Italian peninsula, the chronicler had easy access to information regarding northern Italy. For this reason, historian Roger Collins considers the Chronica, though short, to be reliable on Italian matters. The remaining sources <b>all</b> <b>come</b> <b>from</b> Italy and were written in later centuries. Two of them were written in the 7th century, the Continuatio Havniensis Prosperi and the Origo Gentis Langobardorum, both anonymous. The Continuatio is a chronicle written around 625 that has reached us in a single manuscript. As its name suggests, it {{is a continuation of}} the 5th century chronicle of Prosper of Aquitaine. Derived in considerable measure from the Chronica Majora of Isidore of Seville, it blames the Romans for their inability to defend Italy from foreign invaders, and praises the Lombards for defending the country from the Franks. This is the earliest surviving work to name Rosamund, the queen of the Lombards who plays a central role in Helmichis' attested biography. The other 7th century work, the Origo, is a brief prose history of the Lombards that is essentially an annotated king list, although it begins with a description of the founding myth of the Lombard nation. Giorgio Ausenda believes that the Origo was written around 643 as a prologue to the Edictum Rothari, and continued to be updated till 671. According to Walter Pohl, the author's motives are mostly political: the Origo serves to consolidate the Lombards' national identity by emphasising a shared history. Apart from the origin myth, the only more detailed account is the one concerning the death of Alboin, and thus Helmichis.|$|E

25|$|The white wines {{made from}} the Moscato Bianco (also known as Muscat Blanc à Petits Grains) are most noted for their frizzante and {{sparkling}} spumante styles but some still wines are produced as well. Located northeast of Alba, the wines from the Asti region {{are known for their}} delicate light bodies, low alcohol content and slightly sweet nature. Like many sparkling wines, Asti are not vintage dated even though a majority of the grapes might <b>all</b> <b>come</b> <b>from</b> the same vintage year.

25|$|Vinyl acetate {{polymers}} include polyvinyl acetate, {{polyvinyl alcohol}} and polyvinyl acetal; <b>all</b> <b>come</b> <b>from</b> reaction products of vinyl acetate. Some forms of acetates {{are known to}} be acidic and will do damage to an object with direct contact. Additionally, polyvinyl acetate mixtures tend to degrade in storage and release acetic acid, which in some cases can corrode lead. This compound's coloring ranges from clear/white to a soft yellow. As it ages, it will change to a deeper yellow. It can have a similar appearance to rubber adhesives but the difference is that PVA turns white when comes into contact with water. Warm water and acetone are typically used as solvents.|$|E

25|$|Piraeus {{possessed a}} primary seaport, Cantharus, and, {{due to the}} foreign {{influence}} of trade and the mercenary garrison on Munychia hill, the city was also entry point for new cults in Attica. It has been theorized that this cache was a shipment {{that may have been}} overtaken when the Roman general, Sulla, sacked Piraeus in 86 B.C.E. However, since the various statues date from a time span of approximately five centuries, it could not have been shipped on private commission. It is possible that these bronze cult statues <b>all</b> <b>come</b> <b>from</b> one sanctuary that had been dedicated over the centuries before the collection was removed in the first century B.C.E. The cache could have been transported to Piraeus from almost anywhere, though as there are two representations of Artemis and one of Apollo, it's thought that the cache may be from Delos, the divine twins' birthplace.|$|E

500|$|English {{desert and}} its Romance {{cognates}} (including Italian and Portuguese deserto, French désert and Spanish desierto) <b>all</b> <b>come</b> <b>from</b> the ecclesiastical Latin dēsertum (originally [...] "an abandoned place"), a participle of dēserere, [...] "to abandon". The correlation between aridity and sparse population {{is complex and}} dynamic, varying by culture, era, and technologies; thus {{the use of the}} word desert can cause confusion. In English before the 20th century, desert was often used in the sense of [...] "unpopulated area", without specific reference to aridity; but today the word is most often used in its climate-science sense (an area of low precipitation). Phrases such as [...] "desert island" [...] and [...] "Great American Desert" [...] in previous centuries did not necessarily imply sand or aridity; their focus was the sparse population.|$|E

500|$|Germanic [...] is {{generally}} {{agreed to be}} cognate with the Latin albus ('(matt) white'), Old Irish ailbhín ('flock'); Albanian elb ('barley'); and Germanic words for 'swan' such as Modern Icelandic álpt. These <b>all</b> <b>come</b> <b>from</b> an Indo-European base *albh-, and seem to be connected {{by the idea of}} whiteness. The Germanic word presumably originally meant [...] "white person", perhaps as a euphemism. Jakob Grimm thought that whiteness implied positive moral connotations, and, noting Snorri Sturluson's ljósálfar, suggested that elves were divinities of light. This is not necessarily the case, however. For example, because the cognates suggest matt white rather than shining white, and because in medieval Scandinavian texts whiteness is associated with beauty, Alaric Hall has suggested that elves may have been called [...] "the white people" [...] because they were regarded as beautiful.|$|E
500|$|Within {{the genus}} Inocybe, I.godeyi has been {{classified}} {{in a number}} of ways. In 1986, mycologist Thom Kuyper placed the species in the supersection Marginatae (subgenus Inocybe), along with species including I.abietis, I.calospora and I.praetervisa. Rolf Singer considers Marginatae a section in subgenus Inocybe, but he placed I.godeyi in the section Geophyllinae (in the subgenus Inocibium) along with species including I.agglutinata and I.pudica. A 2002 phylogenetic study found that Singer's Geophyllinae is probably monophyletic (that is, the taxa <b>all</b> <b>come</b> <b>from</b> a common, recent ancestor) and suggested that I.godeyi forms a clade with species including I.abietis, I.corydalina, I.agglutinata and I.pudica.
