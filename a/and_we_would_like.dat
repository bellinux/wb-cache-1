2500|$|To {{handle the}} case where both mean and {{variance}} are unknown, we could place independent priors over the mean and variance, with fixed estimates of the average mean, total variance, number of data points used to compute the variance prior, and sum of squared deviations. [...] Note however that in reality, the total variance of the mean depends on the unknown variance, and the sum of squared deviations {{that goes into the}} variance prior (appears to) depend on the unknown mean. [...] In practice, the latter dependence is relatively unimportant: Shifting the actual mean shifts the generated points by an equal amount, and on average the squared deviations will remain the same. [...] This is not the case, however, with the total variance of the mean: As the unknown variance increases, the total variance of the mean will increase proportionately, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>would</b> <b>like</b> to capture this dependence.|$|E

2500|$|Reagan and Soviet General Secretary Mikhail Gorbachev had {{achieved}} closer relations during Reagan's second term, but Bush was initially skeptical of Soviet intentions. In 1989, {{just after the}} fall of the Berlin Wall, Bush met with Gorbachev in a conference on the Mediterranean island of Malta. The administration had been under intense pressure to meet with the Soviets, but not all initially found the Malta Summit to be a step in the right direction; Scowcroft, among others, was apprehensive about the meeting, saying that it might be [...] "premature" [...] due to concerns where, according to Condoleezza Rice, [...] "expectations [...] set that something was going to happen, where the Soviets might grandstand and force [...] into agreements that would ultimately not be good for the United States." [...] But European leaders, including François Mitterrand and Margaret Thatcher, encouraged Bush to meet with Gorbachev, something that he did December 2 and 3, 1989. Though no agreements were signed, the meeting was viewed largely as being an important one; when asked about nuclear war, Gorbachev responded, [...] "I assured the President of the United States that the Soviet Union would never start a hot war against the United States of America. <b>And</b> <b>we</b> <b>would</b> <b>like</b> our relations to develop in such a way that they would open greater possibilities for cooperation....

FCC Commissioner Michael Powell, appearing before a Senate panel, called the Super Bowl incident [...] "a new low for prime time television".

2500|$|Following ALFs conclusion, Clausen was {{unemployed}} {{for seven}} months. Clausen's friend suggested {{him to a}} producer from the Fox animated series The Simpsons who {{were looking for a}} new composer. Clausen [...] "had no interest in doing animation" [...] and [...] "wanted to be a drama composer." [...] However, the show's creator Matt Groening told him [...] "we don't look upon this as being a cartoon but a drama where the characters are drawn, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>would</b> <b>like</b> it scored that way." [...] Clausen took the job. Groening told Clausen that the [...] "emotion [...] scored first and the action scored second", unlike many other cartoons, and that [...] "scoring the emotions of the characters" [...] was the primary aim for The Simpsons. Clausen's first episode was [...] "Treehouse of Horror", the third episode of season two, in 1990. It served as an audition and he was hired permanently after that. He has since scored almost all of the music and songs which have appeared on the show, across a wide range of musical styles {{through the end of the}} 28th season. He conducted a 35 piece orchestra for the music, a rarity for television shows, and recorded the score for an episode every week. Clausen wrote an episode's score during the week, recorded it on a Friday, with some variation if vocals are required. The limited timeframe proved the most challenging aspect of the job for Clausen; he was once required to write 57musical cues in one week. For the show's original songs production is much longer; Clausen records the music to the writers' lyrics, over seven or eight months the scene is animated, and then Clausen can re-record the song with a full orchestra. The full orchestra allows easy transition between the wide range of musical styles required for the show. Clausen noted: [...] "The greatest composing challenge has been to try to make some kind of musical sense out of the cues when I have only a few seconds to make a musical statement. We have a joke on the scoring stage that I can make you feel five ways in thirteen seconds. We say it in jest, but the reality of the situation is that I am required to do just that quite often." [...] Clausen intentionally opted against composing themes for each character, with some exceptions such as Mr. Burns, and instead [...] " [...] each story its own theme and thematic development...That approach helps to give each story its own special identification, more like individual mini-movies." [...] He supplements the orchestra with additional instruments, such as extra brass for the episode [...] "Cape Feare", for which Clausen composed Sideshow Bob's theme, which continued to be played whenever Bob gets out of prison in subsequent episodes. It is based on the score of the movie Cape Fear, composed by Bernard Herrmann. The musical requests of the writers range from rerecord a specific piece of music to compose something based on this character's emotion in a scene.|$|E

60|$|It {{would be}} a poor sort of make-believe if this {{survivor}} pretended any lasting indignation with Valladolid because of the stench of Cervantes's house. There are a great many very bad smells in Spain everywhere, {{and it is only}} fair to own that a psychological change toward Valladolid had been operating itself in me since luncheon which Valladolid was not very specifically to blame for. Up to the time the wedding guests left us we had said Valladolid was the most interesting city we had ever seen, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>would</b> <b>like</b> to stay there a week; then, suddenly, we began to turn against it. One thing: the weather had clouded, and it was colder. But we determined to be just, and after we left the house of Cervantes we drove out to the promenades {{along the banks of the}} Pisuerga, in hopes of a better mind, for we had read that they were the favorite resort of the citizens in summer, and we did not know but even in autumn we might have some glimpses of their recreation. Our way took us sorrowfully past hospitals and prisons and barracks; and when we came out on the promenade we found ourselves in the gloom of close set mulberry trees, with the dust thick on the paths under them. The leaves hung leaden gray on the boughs and there could never have been a spear of grass along those disconsolate ways. The river was shrunken in its bed, and where its current crept from pool to pool, women were washing some of the rags which already hung so thick on the bushes that it was wonderful there should be any left to wash. Squalid children abounded, and at one point a crowd of people had gathered and stood looking silently and motionlessly over the bank. We looked too and on a sand-bar near the shore we saw three gendarmes standing with a group of civilians. Between their fixed and absolutely motionless figures lay the body of a drowned man on the sand, poorly clothed in a workman's dress, and with his poor, dead clay-white hands stretched out from him on the sand, and his gray face showing to the sky. Everywhere people were stopping and staring; from one of the crowded windows of the nearest house a woman hung with a rope of her long hair in one hand, and in the other the brush she was passing over it. On the bridge the man who had found the body made a merit of his discovery which he dramatized to a group of spectators without rousing them to a murmur or stirring them from their statuesque fixity. His own excitement in comparison seemed indecent.|$|E
