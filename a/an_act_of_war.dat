5|$|The {{commander}} of Fort Sumter, South Carolina, Major Robert Anderson, sent {{a request for}} provisions to Washington, and the execution of Lincoln's order to meet that request was seen by the secessionists as <b>an</b> <b>act</b> <b>of</b> <b>war.</b> On April 12, 1861, Confederate forces fired on Union troops at Fort Sumter, forcing them to surrender, and began the war. Historian Allan Nevins argued that the newly inaugurated Lincoln made three miscalculations: underestimating {{the gravity of the}} crisis, exaggerating the strength of Unionist sentiment in the South, and not realizing the Southern Unionists were insisting there be no invasion.|$|E

5|$|The three {{beings are}} {{discovered}} to be reptilian humanoids, {{and in a}} scuffle, they capture Elliot and strike Tony with a venomous forked tongue; the Doctor and Rory subdue one while the other two retreat with Elliot back into the earth. The Doctor realises the beings are {{a new form of}} Silurians, and that they have relented in their attack since both sides hold a hostage. The captured Silurian calls herself Alaya; {{she is a member of}} the warrior caste, awoken by the drill. Alaya believes, as do all Silurians, that the Earth still belongs to them, that the drilling was a form of attack by the humans, and that they will defeat humanity eventually. Tony, suffering from the effects of the venom, says they should dissect Alaya, but the Doctor warns that it would be seen as <b>an</b> <b>act</b> <b>of</b> <b>war.</b> The Doctor decides to travel in the TARDIS down the drilling shaft to talk to the rest of the Silurians and work out a truce; Nasreen accompanies him.|$|E

25|$|Despite {{initiating}} the war, Argentina had not prepared {{a plan for}} the subsequent defence of the islands. The military dictatorship that governed the country at the time regarded the seizure of the Falklands as a political act to obtain a diplomatic bargaining position, and not as <b>an</b> <b>act</b> <b>of</b> <b>war.</b> Consequently they were taken by surprise when the British responded with a large-scale mobilization, and a task force to retake the islands.|$|E
25|$|The Qur'an {{commands}} Muslims to make {{a proper}} declaration of war prior to the commencement of military operations. Thus, surprise attacks are illegal under the Islamic jurisprudence. The Qur'an had similarly commanded Muhammad to give his enemies, who had violated the Treaty of Hudaybiyyah, a time period of four months to reconsider their position and negotiate. This rule, however, is not binding if the adversary has already started the war. Forcible prevention of religious practice is considered <b>an</b> <b>act</b> <b>of</b> <b>war.</b>|$|E

50|$|After some debate, {{permission}} to engage General Belgrano {{was sent to}} the submarine from the Royal Navy's fleet command centre in Northwood in the United Kingdom. In the intervening period, General Belgrano had retired from its attack position and turned west, since Veinticinco de Mayo was not yet ready to engage the British fleet. This later caused some controversy, although General Belgranos captain and the Argentine government later acknowledged that the attack was <b>a</b> legitimate <b>act</b> <b>of</b> <b>war.</b>|$|R

25|$|Early on 19 April the refuelled and now {{heavily armed}} Georgette {{returned}} and came alongside the whaler, demanding {{the surrender of}} the prisoners and attempting to herd the ship back into Australian waters.

Ignoring the demand to surrender, Anthony had raised, and then pointed towards, the U.S. flag, informed the Georgette that {{an attack on the}} Catalpa would be considered <b>an</b> <b>act</b> <b>of</b> <b>war</b> against the USA, and proceeded westward.|$|E
25|$|On {{the same}} day, in {{unconnected}} circumstances, {{two members of}} the Royal Irish Constabulary guarding gelignite were killed in the Soloheadbeg Ambush by members of the Irish Volunteers. Although it had not ordered this incident, the course of events soon drove the Dáil to recognise the Volunteers as the army of the Irish Republic and the ambush as <b>an</b> <b>act</b> <b>of</b> <b>war</b> against Great Britain. The Volunteers therefore changed their name, in August, to the Irish Republican Army. In this way the 1918 elections led to the outbreak of the Anglo-Irish War, giving the impression that the election sanctioned the war.|$|E
25|$|The Secretariat of the Committee for Peaceful Reunification, Rodong Sinmun and the National Defense Commission have {{repeatedly}} condemned the South Korean government's policy on North Korea. The state of North Korea holds {{the government of}} South Korea responsible for the balloon drops, and has demanded for harder actions against the activists. North Korea has also threatened military action. On 1 December 2012, the Secretariat issued a statement demanding then presidential candidate Park Geun-hye to terminate president Lee Myung-bak's policy and to fulfill her presidential election pledge. The Secretariat of the Committee for Peaceful Reunification warned that provokers will be held fully accountable and that the relations of the two states would be again pushed to a catastrophe {{in the event that}} the launch would be allowed to happen.

50|$|Within Franco's Spain, {{and among}} artists in exile {{and in the}} image of Spain abroad, the Spanish Civil War (1936-39) was perpetuated as a {{reference}} to Spain's cultural life. The destruction of the Spanish artistic heritage had been of great magnitude, not only as <b>a</b> result <b>of</b> <b>acts</b> <b>of</b> <b>war,</b> but particularly by the iconoclastic fury of the Republican rearguard. These events were widely publicized in the new state, which in turn exhibited as an achievement its own recovery the most important collections of the Museo del Prado, except at Geneva, where Spain obtained from Vichy France two emblematic pieces from Spain under different circumstances (La Inmaculada de Soult and La dama de Elche, 1941).|$|R
50|$|However, {{the note}} left Japan an {{alternative}} to war, concession to American demands, {{and it did not}} express even an intention to cease negotiations. Thus, it cannot be seen as an ultimatum from the perspective of international law. While the Japanese may have felt that they could not accede to such demands and so were provoked into war, the note cannot be considered to be <b>a</b> first <b>act</b> <b>of</b> <b>war,</b> and some may not think it sufficient provocation to relieve Japan of the responsibility for initiating {{the use of force in}} this conflict.|$|R
50|$|Alan Dershowitz, {{professor}} of Law at Harvard Law School, {{wrote that the}} legality of blockades as <b>a</b> response to <b>acts</b> <b>of</b> <b>war</b> “is not subject to serious doubt.” He likened Israel’s maritime blockade of Gaza to U.S. naval actions in Cuba during the Cuban Missile Crisis, which the U.S. had deemed lawful though not part of an armed conflict.|$|R
25|$|From 1965 to 1973, {{very few}} {{men in the}} US were convicted of burning their draft cards. Some 25,000 others went unpunished. Before 1965, the act of burning a draft card was already {{prohibited}} by US statute—the registrant was required to carry the card at all times, and any destruction of it was thus against the law. Also, it was entirely possible {{for a young man}} to destroy his draft card and still answer his country's call to service by appearing at an induction center and serving in the military. And it was possible for a registrant to faithfully keep his card on his person but fail to appear when called. The draft card was not {{an essential part of the}} government's ability to draft men into the military. Thus draft-card burning was <b>an</b> <b>act</b> <b>of</b> <b>war</b> resistance more than it was draft resistance.|$|E
25|$|In 1863 Bulloch {{contracted}} with the Laird shipyard {{for the construction}} of two ironclad rams to be used against the Union blockade. However, if it could be proven that the contract (or commission) for building these ships was in violation of Britain's neutrality law, the ships could be seized. The Union's minister to Britain, Charles F. Adams, tried to do just that; but he could only gather circumstantial evidence, as Bulloch {{went to great lengths to}} conceal his movements. Adams threatened the British government with reprisal: that if the rams escaped, the United States would consider it <b>an</b> <b>act</b> <b>of</b> <b>war.</b> After further consideration, British authorities seized the two vessels and from that point on kept a close watch on Bulloch and other such propositions made by the Confederate government, forcing C.S.A. officials to turn to the French for future commissions. Following that turn of events Bulloch then commissioned a shipbuilder in France to construct the Stonewall, an other armored ram.|$|E
25|$|On 29 October 1914, {{after the}} pursuit of Goeben and Breslau, Breslau bombarded the Russian Black Sea port of Theodosia.

Russian Minister of Foreign Affairs Sergey Sazonov said it was too late and that Russia considered the raid <b>an</b> <b>act</b> <b>of</b> <b>war.</b> The Cabinet tried to explain that hostilities were begun without its sanction by German officers serving in the navy. The Allies insisted on reparations to Russia, the dismissal of German officers from the Goeben and Breslau, and the internment of the German ships {{until the end of the}} war, but before the Ottoman government could respond, Great Britain and France declared war on the Ottoman Empire on 5 November. The Ottoman Committee of Union and Progress's official Declaration of War came on 14 November.|$|E
50|$|Not surprisingly, {{the owners}} {{objected to the}} seizure and the issue was taken up in the papal court.

The painting was never returned. Instead, it was donated by three Danzig patricians, Sidinghusen, Balandt and Niederhof, to the St. George Brothers church in Danzig, whence it came to Danzig's St. Mary's Church. The Burgundian Duke, under whose flag the St. Thomas had run, brokered a peace between war-weary England and the Hanseatic League, restoring their trading rights.|$|R

Findings in children (n= 816) and adults (n= 801) from postwar Bosnia are analyzed. One of the most traumatic experiences was having a missing relative, particularly a father: not knowing the fate of a close relative is an ongoing stressor that alters cognitive-emotional processes and reduces self esteem and interactional competence, whether in children or in adults.
