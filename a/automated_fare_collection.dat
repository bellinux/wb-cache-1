50|$|Notably, Canada also {{produces}} <b>fare</b> <b>collection</b> devices for various transit agencies in North America. Trapeze Group., located in Mississauga, Ontario, currently manufactures and develops high tech <b>fare</b> <b>collection</b> solutions. They are best-known {{for having the}} most modular and customizable products available {{on the market today}} with an offering called the <b>Automated</b> Transit <b>Fare</b> <b>Collection</b> System (AFC).|$|R
5000|$|The Lahore Metrobus {{meets the}} {{criteria}} {{laid out by}} the Institute for Transportation and Development Policy. It has barrier-controlled, <b>automated</b> off-board <b>fare</b> <b>collection,</b> a service interval of less than 2 minutes during peak hours, stations with well-designed signage and information systems and a precision bus docking system (See: Guided Bus). The terminal approach system has escalators and underground, subway-styled approach tubes. Due to these approach tubes, prospective passengers don't have to cross high-speed roads {{to get to the}} stations, but go below them instead, an example of a segregated Right-of-way. [...] The stations have parking spaces for motorbikes and cycles while the two terminals provide car-parking facilities as well.|$|R
50|$|Use of the Bus Rapid Transit System costs one yuan (or, if a Changzhou Bus Card is used, either {{three or}} six jiao {{depending}} on the type of card) and provides access throughout Changzhou. The BRT has the following specifications: separate bus lanes or bus-only roadways, a vast network of routes and corridors, high capacity buses operating both outside and inside these corridors, greater passenger volume as compared to that in mixed traffic lanes (-3000 pphpd), enhanced station environments (not just simple bus shelters), <b>automated</b> pre-boarding <b>fare</b> <b>collection</b> and <b>fare</b> verification, street level boarding and alighting, low emission vehicle technology (Euro III or higher), weather protection on station platforms, centralized system controls, real-time next bus information display, a distinctive marketing identity, high-quality passenger service at bus stations, segregated bike lanes along main corridor(s) as well as station access for disabled persons. The BRT is also located in the following cities: Beijing, Chongqing, Dalian, Guangzhou, Jinan, Hangzhou, Hefei, Kunming, Xiamen, Zhengzhou. and Wulumuqi. A metro network is nevertheless in planning stage.|$|R
25|$|The CharlieCard is a MIFARE-based {{contactless}} {{smart card}} used for <b>automated</b> <b>fare</b> <b>collection</b> by the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority (MBTA). The CharlieCard was {{made available to the}} general public beginning December 4, 2006.|$|E
25|$|Production <b>Automated</b> <b>Fare</b> <b>Collection</b> (AFC) {{implementation}} {{began in}} 1994. New turnstiles, including unstaffed high wheels, and floor-to-ceiling service gates, featured {{lessons learned from}} trials. As AFC equipment was rolled out, evasion plummeted. Fare abuse agents, together with independent monitoring, were eliminated.|$|E
25|$|Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority v. Anderson, et al., Civil Action No. 08-11364, was a {{challenge}} brought by the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority (MBTA) to prevent three Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) students from publicly presenting a security vulnerability they discovered in the MBTA's Charlie Card <b>automated</b> <b>fare</b> <b>collection</b> system. The case concerns {{the extent to which}} the disclosure of a computer security flaw is a form of free speech protected by the First Amendment to the United States Constitution.|$|E
40|$|The {{impact of}} fare {{policies}} and fare structure on {{the selection of}} equipment was investigated, <b>fare</b> <b>collection</b> systems are described, hardware and technology related problems are documented, and the requirements of a <b>fare</b> <b>collection</b> simulation model are outlined. Major findings include: (1) a wide variation in the <b>fare</b> <b>collection</b> systems and equipment, caused primarily by historical precedence; (2) the reliability of AFC equipment used at BART and WMATA discouraged other properties from considering use of similar equipment; (3) existing equipment may not meet the <b>fare</b> <b>collection</b> needs of properties in the near future; (4) the cost of <b>fare</b> <b>collection</b> operation and maintenance is high; and (5) the relatively small market in <b>fare</b> <b>collection</b> equipment discourages new product development by suppliers. Recommendations for <b>fare</b> <b>collection</b> R&D programs include development of new hardware to meet rail transit needs, study of impacts of alternate fare policies increased communication among policymakers, and consensus on fare policy issues...|$|R
50|$|In the past, public {{transport}} systems were often implemented using standalone, proprietary <b>fare</b> <b>collection</b> systems. In such cases, each <b>fare</b> <b>collection</b> system employed unique fare media (such {{as its own}} style of ticket printed on card) and data management systems. Because <b>fare</b> <b>collection</b> systems did not interoperate with each other, payment schemes and tokens varied widely between local and regional systems, and new systems were often costly to develop and maintain.|$|R
50|$|More {{efficient}} on-board <b>fare</b> <b>collection,</b> or preferably prepaid <b>fare</b> <b>collection</b> {{can reduce}} dwell time at stops and greatly speed up service. Multiple-door, level-boarding setups can also greatly reduce stop durations, {{as demonstrated by}} the best Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) services.|$|R
25|$|The <b>automated</b> <b>fare</b> <b>collection</b> {{equipment}} is also {{compatible with the}} MBTA's CharlieTicket, a paper card with a magnetic stripe that operates as a stored-value card or time-period (monthly, weekly, or daily) pass. The MBTA first implemented the stored-value CharlieTicket on the Silver Line in February 2005. The ticket is inserted into a slot in the gate or farebox, the fare is deducted, and the remaining balance is displayed on a small screen. The ticket is {{then returned to the}} rider even if there is no remaining value.|$|E
25|$|Each MetroCard stored value card is {{assigned}} a unique, permanent ten-digit serial number {{when it is}} manufactured. The value is stored magnetically on the card itself, while the card's transaction history is held centrally in the <b>Automated</b> <b>Fare</b> <b>Collection</b> (AFC) Database. When a card is purchased and fares are loaded onto it, the MetroCard Vending Machine or station agent's computer stores {{the amount of the}} purchase onto the card and updates the database, identifying the card by its serial number. Whenever the card is swiped at a turnstile, the value of the card is read, the new value is written, the customer is let through, and then the central database is updated with the new transaction as soon as possible. Cards are not validated in real time against the database when swiped to pay the fare. The AFC Database is necessary to maintain transaction records to track a card if needed. It has actually been used to acquit criminal suspects by placing them away from the scene of a crime. The database also stores a list of MetroCards that have been invalidated for various reasons (such as lost or stolen student or unlimited monthly cards), and it distributes the list to turnstiles in order to deny access to a revoked card.|$|E
500|$|With Japan's ODA {{amounting to}} 75 billion yen in total, the {{construction}} of the LRT Line 2 began in the 1990s, and the first section of the line, from Santolan to Araneta Center-Cubao, was opened on April 5, 2003. [...] The second section, from Araneta Center-Cubao to Legarda, was opened exactly a year later, with the entire line being fully operational by October 29, 2004. [...] During that time the LRT-1 was modernized. [...] <b>Automated</b> <b>fare</b> <b>collection</b> systems using magnetic stripe plastic tickets were installed; air-conditioned trains added; pedestrian walkways between Lines 1, 2, and MRT-3 Lines completed. [...] In 2005, the LRTA made a profit of ₱68million, the first time the agency made a profit since the LRT-1 became operational in 1984.|$|E

2500|$|Ventra is an {{electronic}} fare payment {{system for the}} Chicago Transit Authority and Pace that replaced the Chicago Card and the Transit Card <b>automated</b> <b>fare</b> <b>collection</b> system. [...] Ventra (purportedly Latin for [...] "windy," [...] though the actual Latin word is ventosa) launched in August 2013, with a full system transition slated for July 1, 2014. The Ventra payment system includes several options of payment, including a contactless smart card powered by RFID, a single day or use ticket powered by RFID, any personal bank-issued credit card or debit card that has an RFID chip, and a compatible mobile phone. Ventra is operated by Cubic Transportation Systems.|$|E
2500|$|In May 2008, MIT {{students}} Zack Anderson, Russell J. Ryan, Alessandro Chiesa, and Samuel G. McVeety {{presented a}} final paper in Professor Ron Rivest's 6.857: Computer and Network Security class demonstrating {{weaknesses in the}} MBTA's <b>automated</b> <b>fare</b> <b>collection</b> system. The report identified four problems: the value is stored on the card {{and not in a}} secure database, the data on the card can be easily read and overwritten, there is no cryptographic signature algorithm to prevent forgeries, and there is no centralized card verification system. Anderson, Ryan, and Chiesa submitted a presentation entitled [...] "Anatomy of a Subway Hack: Breaking Crypto RFID's and Magstripes of Ticketing Systems" [...] to the DEF CON hacker convention which claimed to review and demonstrate how to reverse engineer the data on the magstripe card, several attacks to break the MIFARE-based Charlie Card, and brute force attacks using FPGAs.|$|E
5|$|The {{contract}} for Metro's <b>fare</b> <b>collection</b> system was awarded in 1975 to Cubic Transportation Systems. Electronic <b>fare</b> <b>collection</b> using paper magnetic stripe cards started on July 1, 1977, {{a little more}} than a year after the first stations opened. Prior to electronic <b>fare</b> <b>collection,</b> exact change fareboxes were used. Metro's historic paper farecard system is also shared by Bay Area Rapid Transit, which Cubic won a {{contract for}} in 1974. Any remaining value stored on the paper cards was printed on the card at each exit, and passes were printed with the expiration date.|$|R

40|$|This study {{presents}} a comparative analysis of <b>fare</b> <b>collection</b> systems for inter-city bus operation. One {{of the important}} issues in the bus scheduling model is stops of buses in the bus stations (called dwell time -where buses have to stop for boarding and alighting passengers in the bus station). This issue has {{a direct impact on}} increased travel time. Subsequently, increased travel time for one bus mission can cause delay in the loops of bus scheduling. This article describes a survey of <b>fare</b> <b>collection</b> systems for bus operations, covering two <b>fare</b> <b>collection</b> systems: paying cash and using the touch-n-go card. We studied this issue in a real case inter-city bus operation. It has been highlighted that a <b>fare</b> <b>collection</b> system using the touch-n-go card has higher efficiency than other the cash method in relation to reducing dwell time of buses in the bus station...|$|R
