5|$|In the 1960s, Hergé became {{increasingly}} annoyed at {{the success of}} René Goscinny and Albert Uderzo's <b>Asterix</b> comic book series, which various commentators had described as eclipsing The Adventures of Tintin as the foremost comic in the Franco-Belgian tradition. Hoping to imitate {{the success of the}} recent animated films <b>Asterix</b> the Gaul (1967) and <b>Asterix</b> and Cleopatra (1968), Hergé agreed to the production of two animated Belvision films based on the Adventures of Tintin. The first, Tintin and the Temple of the Sun (1969), was based on pre-existing comics, whereas the second, Tintin and the Lake of Sharks (1972) was an original story written by Greg. In 1982 the American filmmaker Steven Spielberg requested the film rights for a live-action adaptation of one of The Adventures of Tintin, a prospect that excited Hergé, but the project never came to fruition at the time.|$|E
5|$|Schumacher {{had a voice}} role in the Disney/Pixar film Cars. His {{character}} is himself as a car (Ferrari F430). The French film <b>Asterix</b> and Obelix at the Olympic Games features Schumacher in a cameo role as a chariot driver called Schumix.|$|E
5|$|Parker also {{appeared}} in the 2008 French film <b>Asterix</b> at the Olympic Games as Tonus Parker, {{and he has been}} given token roles in various TV series like En aparté (2005), in addition to the French series On n'est pas couché (2011). He also played himself in the short film The Angels (2011), directed by Stéphane Marelli. He has participated in a number of episodes of Fort Boyard.|$|E
50|$|Dogmatix {{appears to}} be <b>Asterix's</b> dog in the movie, not Obelix's.|$|R
50|$|Another {{convention}} {{is to put}} the foreign speech in a distinctive lettering style; for example, <b>Asterixs</b> Goths speak in blackletter.|$|R
50|$|Story of {{the village}} {{on the day of}} <b>Asterixs</b> and Obelixs birth, which {{interrupts}} a quarrel among their friends fathers.|$|R
5|$|Hergé's {{depiction}} of the San Theodoran carnival was drawn largely from images of the Nice Carnival. Among the revelers, he included those dressed in the costumes of various different cartoon and film characters, such as Mickey Mouse, Donald Duck, <b>Asterix,</b> Snoopy, Groucho Marx, and Zorro. Hergé also included a band known as the Coconuts into the carnival scene; these were not developed by Hergé himself but were rather the creations of his friend and colleague Bob de Moor, who had devised them for his own comic series, Barelli. The street that they were marching down, Calle 22 de Mayo, was named after Hergé's own birthday, 22 May.|$|E
25|$|In <b>Asterix</b> and Obelix All at Sea, <b>Asterix,</b> Obelix and Getafix go to {{the remains}} of Atlantis (said to be the present-day Canaries) to seek the secret of age {{reversal}} as Obelix was accidentally reverted to childhood. At Atlantis, except for the high priest, everyone {{is in a state}} of childhood.|$|E
25|$|A {{group of}} hapless pirates, in {{themselves}} parodies {{of the characters}} of Redbeard, often run into <b>Asterix</b> and are subsequently beaten up and usually sunk.|$|E
50|$|The book {{describes}} <b>Asterix's</b> and Obelix's {{voyage to}} the Middle East. It is mainly inspired by James Bond films and biblical tales.|$|R
5000|$|Influenza {{is called}} 'Zaza' for short (a {{possible}} reference to Zsa Zsa Gabor), and therefore interprets <b>Asterix's</b> victory over Tremensdelirius, {{in which he}} cut the letter 'Z' in Tremensdelirius' clothing, as dedicated to her. In fact the Z is a reference to Zorro; the TV series was often shown on TV in continental Europe. <b>Asterix's</b> dialogue during the swordfight is a reference to Cyrano de Bergerac. (In the English translation it includes references to the climactic swordfight in Hamlet.) ...|$|R
50|$|One of <b>Asterix's</b> most {{recognizable}} features is his winged helmet, its wings often falling into positions that match his expressions. It closely resembles the winged helmet featured on packets of Gauloises cigarettes.|$|R
25|$|The <b>Asterix</b> comics, set {{during the}} time of Julius Caesar and written {{in the second half of}} the twentieth century, are set in Armorica, now Brittany.|$|E
25|$|Benigni {{played one}} of the main {{characters}} in <b>Asterix</b> and Obelix vs Caesar as Detritus, a corrupt Roman provincial governor who wants to kill Julius Caesar, thereby seizing control of the Roman Republic.|$|E
25|$|In Goscinny and Uderzo's 1965 comic <b>Asterix</b> in Britain, Caesar has {{successfully}} conquered Britain because the Britons stop fighting every afternoon {{for a cup}} of hot water with milk, tea not yet having been brought to Europe.|$|E
5000|$|The money itself {{falls into}} the ship and {{possession}} of the pirates. At <b>Asterix's</b> village, a celebration is held {{for the return of}} the two heroes and the recovery of their honour.|$|R
50|$|Dogmatix {{helps the}} village rooster (national bird of France) defeat an eagle (symbol of Rome) terrorizing the local animals, by {{stealing}} <b>Asterixs</b> gourd of potion {{to provide the}} rooster with the necessary advantage.|$|R
50|$|Although {{in several}} {{countries}} of Continental Europe, Redbeard is a popular comic series in its own right, the popularity of <b>Asterix's</b> pirates {{is one of the}} few occasions when parody figures have overshadowed their originals.|$|R
25|$|Again, comics {{published}} for the Hungarian {{minorities in}} Yugoslavia ranged {{on a much}} larger scale: Hägar, larger selection of <b>Asterix</b> and Lucky Luke (in album format), Prince Valiant, Biblical comics, etc. These were popular {{on both sides of}} the border, imported both legally and illegally to Hungary.|$|E
25|$|In 1955, {{following}} a contractual dispute with his publisher Dupuis, Franquin {{went for a}} short stint at rival Tintin magazine. This {{led to the creation}} of Modeste et Pompon, a gag series which included contributions from René Goscinny (of <b>Astérix</b> fame) and Peyo. Franquin later returned to Spirou, but his contractual commitment to Tintin meant that he had to contribute to both magazines, an unusual arrangement in the comic industry. The series was later passed on to authors such as Dino Attanasio and Mittéï (Jean Mariette).|$|E
25|$|This {{extraordinary}} instrument, a prehistoric-looking {{combination of}} horn and harp created by Gaston, produces a sound so terrible and loud that it causes physical destruction all around and panics animals and even fighter jet pilots. Like {{the voice of}} the bard Cacofonix in <b>Asterix,</b> it horrifies everyone except its originator. The first time the instrument appears, the plucking of just one string causes the floor to collapse. Gaston has also created at least one other instrument in the same vein, and an electric version of the Gaffophone. Fantasio has tried several times {{to get rid of the}} Gaffophone, without success.|$|E
5000|$|The Jews are all {{depicted}} as Yemenite Jews, with dark skin and black eyes and beards, {{a tribute to}} Marc Chagall the famous painter whose painting of King David hangs at the Knesset (Israeli Parliament). <b>Asterix's</b> and Obelix's visit to Jerusalem is full of references to the Bible.|$|R
50|$|In {{a village}} similar to <b>Asterix's,</b> two rival chiefs, Cleverdix and Majestix, {{have been elected}} and a ditch dug through the village, {{dividing}} it into {{the party of the}} left (led by Cleverdix) and the party of the right (ruled by Majestix), which contest the leadership of the entire village. Histrionix, the son of Cleverdix, and Melodrama, the daughter of Majestix, are the only villagers who do not agree with the fight. After a failed attempt by both chieftains to persuade the other side, Majestix's advisor Codfix offers to invite the local Roman garrison in exchange for Melodrama's hand in marriage (while planning secretly to overthrow Majestix and become chief himself).|$|R
5000|$|This {{happens in}} the {{original}} as well, as with Geriatrix (French: Agecanonix — canonical age — a French expression meaning very old or ancient), {{but it is not}} common, while absurd names in English, such as Dubius Status, are reserved for minor or one-story characters. Fictional place names however tend to be equally silly in all translations, for example the four camps (castra) which surround <b>Asterix's</b> village: Compendium, Aquarium, Laudanum and Totorum (Tot o' rum, colloquial English for shot of rum) — in French this camp is called [...] "Babaorum", a pun on baba au rhum or rum baba, a popular French pastry. (In one of the American translations, one of these camps is named Nohappimedium.) ...|$|R
25|$|Hungarian {{comic book}} artists found {{themselves}} in a very new and alien situation: while comics were having their heyday, young readers' interest drifted from Hungarian comics to the much more modern and spectacular superhero comics. Attila Fazekas, whose Star Wars adaptations were printed in 300,000 copies a decade earlier, now tries every way to remain on the surface. He produced and published his own magazine, Botond. These comic books comprised all kinds of stories, from historical to action. Every issue had a story of Botond, a character based on Hungarian legends and <b>Asterix.</b> He also experimented with erotic (or rather pornographic) comics – with surprisingly small success.|$|E
25|$|The {{popularity}} of comics streaming {{into the country}} made many ask the question: why are not there individual comic book series published? (N.B. {{at the time the}} main field of Hungarian comics were still newspapers, magazines.) The Ministry of Culture, the Office of Information and the General Directory of Publishing previously never authorized such attempts. The less harsh tone of the mid- and late-eighties (see Glasnost) brought some changes in the field of comics. Some foreign comics were allowed to be published in Hungarian, not just comics from the Eastern Bloc (e.g. Mozaik) or comics from communist French publisher L'Humanité (Vaillant, Pif Gadget), but some politically 'harmless' series as <b>Asterix</b> and Lucky Luke (as Wilám Will) in Alfa, Tom and Jerry (as Tom és Jerry since 1987), Mickey Mouse (as Miki egér from 1988) and Swedish Bobo and Góliát (both from 1986), Tumak, Pink Panther, Nils Holgerson, etc. One of the most important magazines of the era was Kockás, that selected stories from Pif and its predecessor Vaillant.|$|E
25|$|Many {{third party}} {{operating}} {{systems have been}} developed for the C64. As well as the original GEOS, two third-party GEOS-compatible systems have been written: Wheels and GEOS megapatch. Both of these require hardware upgrades to the original C64. Several other operating systems are or have been available, including WiNGS OS, the Unix-like LUnix, operated from a command-line, and the embedded systems OS Contiki, with full GUI. Other less well known OSes include ACE, <b>Asterix,</b> DOS/65 and GeckOS. A version of CP/M was released, but this requires the addition of an external Z80 processor to the expansion bus. Furthermore, the Z80 processor is underclocked to be compatible with the C64's memory bus, so performance is poor compared to other CP/M implementations. C64 CP/M and C128 CP/M both suffer a lack of software; although most commercial CP/M software can run on these systems, software media is incompatible between platforms. The low usage of CP/M on Commodores means that software houses saw no need to invest in mastering versions for the Commodore disk format. The C64 CP/M cartridge is also not compatible with anything except the early 326298 motherboards.|$|E
50|$|Uderzo {{was born}} in Fismes (Marne, France), to parents, Silvio (of Venetian descent) and Iria Crestini (of Tuscan descent), who had {{recently}} immigrated from La Spezia, Italy. His childhood ambitions were to become an aircraft mechanic, despite his talents in art becoming apparent at an early age. Uderzo obtained French citizenship in 1934, and during World War II, the teenaged Uderzo left Paris and {{spent a year in}} Brittany, where he worked on a farm and helped with his father's furniture business. He loved Brittany, both for its scenery and its people. In fact, many years later, when the time came to choose a location for <b>Asterix's</b> village, Goscinny left the decision entirely to Uderzo, only stipulating that it should be near the sea in case the characters needed to travel by boat. Uderzo had no hesitation in choosing Brittany.|$|R
30|$|Contrary to {{the current}} {{scientific}} and technological imagination, contemporary bioethical concepts, as well as certain practices of enhancement, may turn {{out not to be}} so new in their basic notion. This is particularly true of investment in the possibility of “chemical” enhancement of humans. Even a glance through the history of ethnology is rather sufficient to find myriad practices of using magic potions. From Gilgamesh’s quest for immortality, the shamanic and Pythian vapors, the fountain of youth and the elixir of life, the Holy Grail and holy water, to <b>Asterix's,</b> Smurfs' and Red Bull mixtures that give supernatural strength – it seems that a possibility of chemical intoxication for the sake of temporary or permanent “enhancement” represents a civilization archetype and that it is an imperishable motif of diverse textual and visual performances. The wish to regain youth, or more generally speaking, to overcome the natural limitations of the human body, could really be regarded in that sense as “the oldest hope of mankind,” as well as a cross-cultural and pan-historical motif, which persists into modernity through scientific projects, such as discovering the human genome [9]. 1 In that sense, the “scientific” understanding of enhancement only extends the same line of human dreams and attempts, which may be as “authentic” as biological determinacy. However, it does this in a qualitatively different way.|$|R
5000|$|In {{a review}} of the album Under My Skin, David Browne of Entertainment Weekly said [...] "Lavigne herself sounds more burdened; ... the sk8erboi of the first album {{has turned out to be}} a selfish, nasty creep who leaves when she won't go to bed with him" [...] in {{reference}} to Don't Tell Me. Blender Music wrote that unlike Sk8er Boi the up-with-abstinence single “Don’t Tell Me” finds her kicking him out of bed. The Guardian was mixed: [...] "Current single Don't Tell Me at least has some relevant advice to impart to her pubescent female fans: it depicts a confused and angry Lavigne fending off an over-eager boyfriend." [...] PopMatters was favorable: [...] "The first single, [...] "Don't Tell Me", is probably the best song on the album, with the kind of wonderfully effusive movement that makes the best pop so damn irresistible. It starts slow and quiet, building to the first chorus, ebbs back, builds to another chorus, drops down into a bridge before coming back with a skull-crunching third chorus that leaves the riff firmly implanted in your skull. One or two reprises and we're out like a light, end of song. At that point you're either convinced or not." [...] Rolling Stone was positive: [...] "The lead single, [...] "Don't Tell Me," [...] might be her most Avril-ish song yet, a petulant kiss-off to a horny boy. As the guitars get revved up behind her, she asks, [...] "Did I not tell you that I'm not like that girl/The one who gives it all away, yeah/Did you think that I was going to give it up to you?" [...] The syntax may be tortured, but the singer sounds just fine: a righteous prude, confidently fending off the creeps." [...] Yahoo Music! liked the song but was angry because there are spelling mistakes in booklet: [...] "we now have a stronger, more confident Avril - forthright in her determination not to lose her cherry on [...] "Don’t Tell Me", which coyly spells ‘ass’ with an ‘a’ and two <b>asterixes</b> on the CD booklet, bitterly writing songs about doomed relationships." ...|$|R
25|$|The boar as {{a warrior}} also appears in Scandinavian, Germanic and Anglo-Saxon culture, with its image having been {{frequently}} engraved on helmets, shields and swords. According to Tacitus, the Baltic Aesti featured boars on their helmets, {{and may have}} also worn boar masks. The boar and pig were held in particularly high esteem by the Celts, who considered them to be their most important sacred animal. Some Celtic deities linked to boars include Moccus and Veteris. It {{has been suggested that}} some early myths surrounding the Welsh hero Culhwch involved the character being the son of a boar god. Nevertheless, the importance of the boar as a culinary item among Celtic tribes may have been exaggerated in popular culture by the <b>Asterix</b> series, as wild boar bones are rare among Celtic archaeological sites, and the few that occur show no signs of butchery, having probably been used in sacrificial rituals. The boar also appears in Vedic mythology. A story present in the Brāhmaṇas has Indra slaying an avaricious boar, who has stolen the treasure of the asuras, then giving its carcass to Vishnu, who offered it as a sacrifice to the gods. In the story's retelling in the Charaka Samhita, the boar is described as a form of Prajāpti, and is credited with having raised the earth from the primeval waters. In the Rāmāyaṇa and the Purāṇas, the same boar is portrayed as an avatar of Vishnu.|$|E
500|$|The comics of Québec, {{also known}} as [...] "BDQ" [...] (bande dessinée québécoise), have {{followed}} a different path than those of English Canada. While newspapers tend to populate their funny pages with syndicated American comic strips, in general comics there have followed Franco-Belgian comics, with The Adventures of Tintin and <b>Asterix</b> being particularly popular and influential. Comics {{also tend to be}} printed in the comic album format that is popular in Europe. Aside from humorous parodies, there is no superhero tradition in Québec comics.|$|E
500|$|Laurent {{visited the}} set of <b>Asterix</b> and Obelix with her friend and the latter's father. Her acting career began when actor Gérard Depardieu, seeing Laurent there, {{asked her if she}} wanted to be in films. Laurent replied, [...] "Why not?". He {{strongly}} advised her not to take acting classes because he believed she already had the necessary skills. When Laurent was 16, Depardieu gave her a part in The Bridge, a drama he starred in and co-directed with Fréderic Auburtin. Laurent played the role of Lisbeth Daboval, the daughter of one of the protagonists of the film, Claire Daboval.|$|E
500|$|On {{the other}} hand, Retro Gamer praised the system's PAL library, {{referring}} {{to it as}} a [...] "superb library of interesting ports and excellent exclusives" [...] which offered significantly greater depth than what was available in North America and provided a [...] "drip-feed of quality titles" [...] that continued to be released in Europe up until the mid-1990s. Such titles ranged from 8-bit entries of Mega Drive franchises such as Sonic the Hedgehog and Streets of Rage to dozens of exclusive PAL releases such as Lucky Dime Caper, <b>Asterix,</b> Ninja Gaiden, Master of Darkness and Power Strike II.|$|E
500|$|In the 1960s, {{the term}} [...] ("drawn strips") came into wide use in French to denote the medium. [...] Cartoonists began {{creating}} comics for mature audiences, and the term [...] "Ninth Art" [...] was coined, as comics began to attract public and academic attention as an artform. [...] A group including René Goscinny and Albert Uderzo founded the magazine Pilote in 1959 to give artists greater freedom over their work. [...] Goscinny and Uderzo's The Adventures of <b>Asterix</b> appeared {{in it and}} {{went on to become the}} best-selling French-language comics series. [...] From 1960, the satirical and taboo-breaking Hara-Kiri defied censorship laws in the countercultural spirit that led to the May 1968 events.|$|E
500|$|Stephen Russell Davies {{was born}} on 27 April 1963 at Mount Pleasant Hospital in Swansea. His father, Vivian Davies (1925–2015), and his mother, Barbara (1929–1999), were teachers. Davies was the {{youngest}} of three children and their only son. Because he was born by C-section, his mother was placed on a morphine drip and was institutionalised after an overdose resulted in a psychotic episode. He described his mother's experience as [...] "literally ... like science fiction" [...] and an early inspiration for his writing career. As a child, Davies was almost always referred to by his middle name. He grew up in a household that [...] "never switched the TV off" [...] until after closedown, and he subsequently became immersed in dramas such as I, Claudius and Doctor Who. One of his first memories, at the age of three, was the 1966 Doctor Who serial The Tenth Planet. He was also an avid cartoonist and comics enthusiast, and purchased series such as <b>Asterix</b> and Peanuts.|$|E
