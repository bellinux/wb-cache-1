5|$|Pik Wan Road and Lin Tak Road {{were also}} built in 1992 to {{facilitate}} transport to newly built areas higher up Lam Tin Hill. Because it hangs off a precipice and carries only two-lanes, Lin Tak Road {{was surrounded by}} both questions of convenience <b>and</b> <b>concerns</b> <b>about</b> its safety.|$|E
5|$|On 2 May 1945 {{news was}} {{received}} that all German forces {{west of the}} Isonzo River had surrendered. While this did not officially end the fighting in Italy, it was all but over. Five days later, {{on the night of}} 7 May, the battalion received the news that Germany had surrendered unconditionally to the Allies, and that the war in Europe was over. Nevertheless, tensions remained high <b>and</b> <b>concerns</b> <b>about</b> the intentions of Yugoslavia regarding the disputed province of Istria meant that the 28th (Māori) Battalion remained on high alert. This continued until early June when an agreement was reached and Yugoslavia withdrew its troops east of the Isonzo River.|$|E
5|$|The Volt has won several awards, {{including}} the 2009 Green Car Vision Award, 2011 Green Car of the Year, 2011 North American Car of the Year, 2011 World Green Car, 2012 European Car of the Year, and 2016 Green Car of the Year. Controversies regarding the Volt include {{the extent to}} which the U.S. federal government may have participated in the Volt’s development, which continued through General Motors' 2009 government-led bankruptcy, <b>and</b> <b>concerns</b> <b>about</b> the battery pack fire risk following a crash test that the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) performed on a Volt in 2011. At the completion of its investigation NHTSA concluded that no discernible defect trend exists.|$|E

5|$|Fueled {{by events}} such as the Waco Siege in 1993, the murders and suicides {{associated}} with the Order of the Solar Temple, and the 1995 Aum Shinrikyo incidents in Japan, German fears <b>and</b> <b>concerns</b> <b>about</b> new religious movements gained in intensity in the 1990s, with Scientology attracting particular attention. Perceptions that Scientology had a totalitarian character were reinforced when Robert Vaughn Young, an American ex-Scientologist and former PR official in the Church of Scientology, visited German officials in late 1995 and wrote an article in Der Spiegel, a widely read weekly magazine, describing Scientology as a totalitarian system operating a gulag – the Rehabilitation Project Force – for members of Scientology's Sea Org found guilty of transgressions. From the mid-1990s onward, press articles, reports and essays on Scientology appeared on an almost daily basis, accompanied by books and television programmes that reached a mass audience.|$|E
5|$|Royal Oak sank {{with up to}} 3,000tons of {{fuel oil}} aboard, the precise amount being unknown since such records were lost with the ship. Oil leaked from the {{corroding}} hull at an increased rate during the 1990s <b>and</b> <b>concerns</b> <b>about</b> the environmental impact led the Ministry of Defence to consider plans for extracting it. Royal Oaks status as a war grave required that surveys and any proposed techniques for removing the oil be handled sensitively: plans in the 1950s to raise and salvage the wreck had been dropped in response to public opposition. In addition to the ethical concerns, poorly managed efforts could destabilise the wreck, resulting in a mass release of the remaining oil; the ship also contains many tons of unexploded ordnance.|$|E
5|$|There were {{calls for}} {{platform}} screen doors {{to be installed}} at above-ground stations after several incidents in which passengers were killed by oncoming trains when they fell onto the railway tracks at above-ground stations. Underground stations already featured platform screen doors since 1987. The authorities initially rejected the proposal by casting doubts over functionality <b>and</b> <b>concerns</b> <b>about</b> the high installation costs, but made an about-turn when the government announced plans to install half-height platform screen doors on the above-ground stations in January 2008, citing lower costs due to it becoming a more common feature worldwide. They were first installed at Jurong East, Pasir Ris and Yishun stations in 2009 under trials to test their feasibility.|$|E

5000|$|The Polaris Music Prize can be {{the subject}} of intense {{scrutiny}} from fans, media and music industry insiders. A number of recurring debates have emerged throughout Polaris history. Some of these include: perception the prize is either too [...] "indie" [...] or too [...] "mainstream," [...] <b>concern</b> <b>about</b> gender balance amongst nominees <b>and</b> jurors, <b>concern</b> <b>about</b> racial balance amongst nominees <b>and</b> jurors, <b>concern</b> <b>about</b> geographical representation amongst nominees <b>and</b> jurors, <b>and</b> <b>concern</b> <b>about</b> fair representation of specific musical genres.

5|$|As he had as {{governor}} of Kentucky, Ford gave attention to improving the efficiency of government. While serving on the Joint Committee on Printing during the One Hundred First and One Hundred Third Congresses, he saved the government {{millions of dollars in}} printing costs by printing in volume and using recycled paper. In 1998, Virginia senator John Warner sponsored the Wendell H. Ford Government Publications Reform Act of 1998; Ford signed on as a co-sponsor. The bill would have eliminated the Joint Committee on Printing, distributing its authority and functions among the Senate Rules Committee, the House Oversight Committee, and the administrator of the Government Printing Office. It would also have centralized government printing services and penalized government agencies who did not make their documents available to the printing office to be printed. Opponents of the bill cited the broad powers granted to the printing office <b>and</b> <b>concerns</b> <b>about</b> the erosion of copyright protection. The bill was reported favorably out of committee, but was squeezed from the legislative calendar by issues related to the impending impeachment of Bill Clinton. Warner did not return to his chairmanship of the Joint Committee on Printing in the next congress, Ford retired from the Senate, and the bill was not re-introduced.|$|E
5|$|No {{congressional hearing}} was convened to {{investigate}} the misallocation of funds by Powell, and neither Cope nor Marsh was held responsible for any of their mistakes, but some of Ballou's charges against Marsh came {{to be associated with}} the Survey. Facing anti-Survey sentiment inflamed by western drought <b>and</b> <b>concerns</b> <b>about</b> takeovers of abandoned western homesteads, Powell found himself the subject of larger scrutiny before the House Appropriations Committee. Galvanized to action by Marsh's perceived extravagance with Survey funds, the Appropriations Committee demanded the Survey's budget be itemized. When his appropriation was cut off in 1892, Powell sent a terse telegram to Marsh demanding his resignation, a personal slight as well as a financial one. At the same time, many of Marsh's allies were retiring or had died, lessening his scientific credence. Just as Marsh's extravagant lifestyle was catching up with him, Cope received a position on the Texas Geological Survey. Cope, still reeling from the personal attacks levied at him during the Herald affair, did not take advantage of the change in fortunes to press his personal attacks. Cope's fortunes continued to look up throughout the early 1890s, as he was promoted to Leidy's position as Professor of Zoology and was elected President of the American Association for the Advancement of Science the same year that Marsh stepped down as head of the Academy of Sciences. Towards the latter part of the decade, Cope's fortunes began to sour once more as Marsh regained some of his recognition, earning the Cuvier Medal, the highest paleontological award.|$|E
5|$|Pierce {{was sent}} back to Buffalo for the 1946 season, now with Gabby Hartnett as his manager (Harris having moved to the team's front office), but missed most of the year with a back injury which was {{attributed}} to overwork. After the 1947 season in Buffalo, where Richards was now his manager, he returned to Detroit in 1948, spending most of the season in the bullpen but making five starts and posting a 3–0 record; he had yet added very little weight since his high school days, being still at 148 pounds. He made his first start, and earned his first major league victory, on August 8 against the Washington Senators, pitching 7⅔ innings and striking out six in a 6–5 victory in which he also drove in a run with a triple and scored. However, Pierce also issued 51 walks in 55⅓ innings that year, <b>and</b> <b>concerns</b> <b>about</b> his pitching control led the Tigers to trade him to the White Sox on November 10 for catcher Aaron Robinson and $10,000, in what most baseball historians consider {{to be one of the}} most one-sided trades in baseball history. Talks had initially centered on Chicago acquiring Pierce's high school teammate Ted Gray, although sources differ as to whether it was White Sox general manager Frank Lane or his Detroit counterpart Billy Evans who switched the focus to Pierce; the Tigers tried to call off the deal one day after it was completed upon fully realizing what they had given up, even offering $50,000 to get Pierce back, but Lane had no intention of giving up the steal he had accomplished in his first trade as general manager.|$|E

40|$|The main {{interest}} {{of this study}} is to observe the sociodemographic (gender, age, education and occupational status) differences in personal exposure, perceived annoyance <b>and</b> <b>concern</b> <b>about</b> air pollution, for the purpose of reducing such differences. Another important aim is to compare the measured exposure data with perceived annoyances <b>and</b> <b>concern</b> <b>about</b> air pollution. The target population of this study was adult (25 - 55 y) inhabitants of Helsinki region. Personal exposures to (n= 201) and microenvironment concentrations of fine particles (PM 2. 5) and nitrogen dioxide (NO 2) were measured during the EXPOLIS study in 1997 - 1998.

40|$|Cardiac {{screening}} {{programs are}} ineffective when participants with abnormal findings fail to seek treatment and, {{to a lesser}} extent, when participants with normal findings use medical facilities unnecessarily because of continuing <b>concern</b> <b>about</b> heart disease. Age, sex, measure of <b>concern</b> <b>about</b> cardiac symptoms <b>and</b> life stress, and abnormal test results were used to predict the use of physician services in the 3 months following screening. Abnormal test results predicted the use of physician services after screening, as did being older, and having life stress <b>and</b> <b>concern</b> <b>about</b> cardiac symptoms. Being older, male, <b>and</b> <b>concerned</b> <b>about</b> cardiac symptoms predicted having at least one abnormal test result. Participants with normal findings {{and high levels of}} <b>concern</b> <b>about</b> cardiac symptoms were as likely to see a physician after the screening as were persons with abnormal findings and low levels of <b>concern</b> <b>about</b> cardiac symptoms. Emphasizing participants' <b>concern</b> <b>about</b> symptoms of heart disease or feelings of stress failed to produce an increase in followup for persons who had abnormal screening outcomes...|$|R
