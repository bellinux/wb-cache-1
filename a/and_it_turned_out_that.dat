25|$|Cobb {{announced}} his retirement after a 22-year career as a Tiger in November 1926, and headed home to Augusta, Georgia. Shortly thereafter, Tris Speaker also retired as player-manager of the Cleveland Indians. The retirement of two great players {{at the same time}} sparked some interest, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>turned</b> <b>out</b> <b>that</b> the two were coerced into retirement because of allegations of game-fixing brought about by Dutch Leonard, a former pitcher managed by Cobb.|$|E
25|$|For a long time, lattice {{simulations}} {{seemed to}} indicate that the modified gluon and ghost propagators proposed by Gribov and Zwanziger were correct. In 2007, however, computers had become sufficiently strong to probe the region of low momenta, where the propagators are most modified, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>turned</b> <b>out</b> <b>that</b> the Gribovndash&Zwanziger picture is not correct. Instead, the gluon propagator goes to a constant value when the momentum is taken to zero, and the ghost propagator still goes like 1/k2 at low momenta. This is the case for both 3 and 4 space-time dimensions. A solution to this discrepancy has been proposed, adding condensates to the Gribovndash&Zwanziger action.|$|E
25|$|Asus {{was founded}} in Taipei in 1989 by T.H. Tung, Ted Hsu, Wayne Hsieh and M.T. Liao, all four having {{previously}} worked at Acer as hardware engineers. At this time, Taiwan had yet to establish a leading position in the computer-hardware business. Intel Corporation would supply any new processors to more established companies like IBM first, and Taiwanese companies {{would have to wait}} for approximately six months after IBM received their engineering prototypes. According to the legend, the company created a prototype for a motherboard using an Intel 486, but it had to do so without access to the actual processor. When Asus approached Intel to request a processor to test it, Intel itself had a problem with their motherboard. Asus solved Intel's problem <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>turned</b> <b>out</b> <b>that</b> Asus' own motherboard worked correctly without the need for further modification. Since then, Asus was receiving Intel engineering samples ahead of its competitors.|$|E

25|$|Science and {{mathematics}} in the Islamic world during the Middle Ages followed various models {{and modes of}} funding varied based primarily on scholars. It was extensive patronage and strong intellectual policies implemented by specific rulers that allowed scientific knowledge to develop in many areas. Funding for translation of scientific texts in other languages was ongoing throughout the reign of certain caliphs, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>turned</b> <b>out</b> <b>that</b> certain scholars became experts in the works they translated and in turn received further support for continuing to develop certain sciences. As these sciences received wider attention from the elite, more scholars were invited and funded to study particular sciences. An example of a translator and mathematician who benefited from this type of support was al-Khawarizmi. A notable feature of many scholars working under Muslim rule in medieval times {{is that they were}} often polymaths. Examples include the work on optics, maths and astronomy of Ibn al-Haytham.|$|E
500|$|The lyrics {{were written}} with Hoppus and DeLonge going into {{separate}} rooms—Hoppus writing the choruses and DeLonge writing the verses. The two {{had not spoken}} {{to each other about}} the lyrics ahead of time, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>turned</b> <b>out</b> <b>that</b> the two had both written about sex. When put together, the song represents the lustful side of sex during the verses, the passionate side in the bridge and the romantic side in the chorus, creating a juxtaposition between both voices. It has been interpreted as a description for failed romance, one that [...] "illustrates a scenario of lust, ambivalence and regret." [...] For Barker, the song's drum track was [...] "super in respect to John Bonham. [...] We were kind of messing around with the verse. It’s like, 'Well, I want to do a four-bar drum intro and just see how it works for the song.' And we never second-guessed it. We were like, 'That sounds rad.'" ...|$|E
2500|$|Stranger in a Strange Land {{was written}} in part as a {{deliberate}} attempt to challenge social mores.

Heinlein completed writing it ten years after he had plotted it out in detail. He later wrote, [...] "I had been in no hurry to finish it, as that story could not be published commercially until the public mores changed.

And the Baraita deduced from the words [...] "that they may learn" [...] in [...] that a mute person was not required to appear at the assembly. But the Gemara questioned the conclusion that one who cannot talk cannot learn, recounting the story of two mute grandsons (or others say nephews) of Rabbi Johanan ben Gudgada who lived in Rabbi's neighborhood. Rabbi prayed for them, and they were healed. <b>And</b> <b>it</b> <b>turned</b> <b>out</b> <b>that</b> notwithstanding their speech impediment, they had learned halachah, Sifra, Sifre, and the whole Talmud. Mar Zutra and Rav Ashi read the words [...] "that they may learn" [...] in [...] to mean [...] "that they may teach," [...] and thus to exclude people who could not speak from the obligation to appear at the assembly.

6000|$|Lothair {{was greeted}} with general kindness; but nobody seemed aware {{that he had been}} long and unusually absent from them. Some had {{themselves}} not come up to town till after Easter, and had therefore less cause to miss him. The great majority, however, were so engrossed with themselves that they never missed anybody. The Duke of Brecon appealed to Lothair about something that had happened at the last Derby, and was under the impression, until better informed, that Lothair had been one of his party. There were some exceptions to this general unacquaintance with events which an hour before Lothair had feared fearfully engrossed society. Hugo Bohun was doubly charmed to see him, [...] "because we were all in a fright one day {{that they were going to}} make you a cardinal, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>turned</b> <b>out</b> <b>that,</b> at the very time they said you were about to enter the conclave, you happened to be at the second cataract.

The time came at last, and now this grand remembrancer bears Schiller's name in huge letters upon its face. Curiously enough, this rock was not degraded or defiled in any way. It is said that two years ago a stranger let himself down from the top of it with ropes and pulleys, and painted all over it, in blue letters bigger than those in Schiller's name, these words: [...] "Try Sozodont;" [...] "Buy Sun Stove Polish;" [...] "Helmbold's Buchu;" [...] "Try Benzaline for the Blood."

60|$|But {{the error}} {{was seen to}} have been in the choice of the lecturer. Our members were no longer {{interested}} in the causes of the war. The topic was too old.

60|$|One other episode we {{must tell}} of past times. Previous to his father's death, Dr Thorne was in love.

At that time his name stood well in Barchester. His father was a prebendary; his cousins and his best friends were the Thornes of Ullathorne, and the lady, who shall be nameless, was not thought to be injudicious in listening to the young doctor. But when Henry Thorne went so far astray, when the old doctor died, when the young doctor quarrelled with Ullathorne, when the brother {{was killed in a}} disgraceful quarrel, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>turned</b> <b>out</b> <b>that</b> the physician had nothing but his profession and no settled locality in which to exercise it; then, indeed, the young lady's friends thought that she was injudicious, and the young lady herself had not spirit enough, or love enough, to be disobedient.

The letter gave no evidence either one way or the other; but it confirmed to her the news which had reached her through Parson John, that her former lover intended to abandon that special career, his choice of which had made it necessary that they two should abandon their engagement. When at Loring he had determined that he must go to India. He had found it to be impossible that he should live without going to India. He had now been staying a few weeks at Dunripple with his uncle, and with Edith Brownlow, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>turned</b> <b>out</b> <b>that</b> he need not go to India at all.
