5|$|Kei Iwasaki of {{the band}} Sekaiichi, writing for Musica, felt that Ichiro Yamaguchi's dual love of 1990s pop music and {{electronic}} musicians such as Daft Punk and Cornelius strongly expressed itself throughout the album. He lauded Sakanaction's efforts to mix electronica and pop, but felt that mixing these two genres was <b>a</b> <b>double-edged</b> sword that invariably influenced the composition of songs. Because of this, he felt that Night Fishing might be more successful musically if the songs were re-recorded.|$|E
5|$|Vermigli's Eucharistic {{views were}} {{accepted}} in Zürich, but {{he ran into}} controversy over his doctrine of double predestination. Similarly to John Calvin, Vermigli believed {{that in some way}} God wills the damnation of those not chosen for salvation. Vermigli attempted to avoid confrontation over the issue, but Bibliander began to openly attack him in 1557, at one point allegedly challenging him to a duel with <b>a</b> <b>double-edged</b> axe. Bibliander held the Erasmian view that God only predestines that those who believe in him will be saved, not the salvation of any individual. Reformed theologians during this time held a variety of beliefs about predestination, and Bullinger's position is ambiguous, but they agreed that God sovereignly and unconditionally chooses whom to save. They believed salvation is not based on any characteristic of a person, including their faith. Bullinger and the Zürich church did not necessarily agree with Vermigli's double predestinarian view, but Bibliander's view was deemed unallowable. He was dismissed in 1560, in part to assure other Reformed churches of the Zürich church's orthodoxy. Vermigli was involved in predestinarian controversy again when Zanchi, who had remained in Strasbourg when Vermigli left for Zürich, was accused of heretical teachings on the Eucharist and predestination by the Lutheran Johann Marbach. Vermigli was selected to write the official judgement of the Zürich church on the matter in a statement signed by Bullinger and other leaders December1561. His affirmation of a strong doctrine of predestination represented the opinion of the Zürich church as a whole.|$|E

25|$|On 23 May 1793, the Coalition army {{defeated}} the French in the Battle of Famars. The Coalition lost 1,100 casualties out of 53,000 while the 27,000-strong French army, now under Lamarche, lost 3,000 killed and wounded, plus 300 men, 17 guns, 14 ammunition wagons and three colors captured. One {{consequence of the}} battle was that the Coalition began the Siege of Valenciennes. The isolated garrison at Condé communicated with the French armies via messages sent by balloons.

25|$|The {{imperial}} {{factor was}} <b>a</b> <b>double-edged</b> sword: Rhodes {{did not want}} the bureaucrats of the Colonial Office in London to interfere in the Empire in Africa. He wanted British settlers and local politicians and governors to run it. This put him {{on a collision course with}} many in Britain, as well as with British missionaries, who favoured what they saw as the more ethical direct rule from London. Rhodes prevailed because he would pay the cost of administering the territories to the north of South Africa against his future mining profits. The Colonial Office did not have enough funding for this. Rhodes promoted his business interests as in the strategic interest of Britain: preventing the Portuguese, the Germans or the Boers from moving into south-central Africa. Rhodes' companies and agents cemented these advantages by obtaining many mining concessions, as exemplified by the Rudd and Lochner Concessions.|$|E
25|$|Cancer cells exhibit greater ROS stress {{than normal}} cells do, {{partly due to}} oncogenic stimulation, {{increased}} metabolic activity and mitochondrial malfunction. ROS is <b>a</b> <b>double-edged</b> sword. On one hand, at low levels, ROS facilitates cancer cell survival since cell-cycle progression driven by growth factors and receptor tyrosine kinases (RTK) require ROS for activation and chronic inflammation, a major mediator of cancer, is regulated by ROS. On the other hand, {{a high level of}} ROS can suppress tumor growth through the sustained activation of cell-cycle inhibitor and induction of cell death as well as senescence by damaging macromolecules. In fact, most of the chemotherapeutic and radiotherapeutic agents kill cancer cells by augmenting ROS stress. The ability of cancer cells to distinguish between ROS as a survival or apoptotic signal is controlled by the dosage, duration, type, and site of ROS production. Modest levels of ROS are required for cancer cells to survive, whereas excessive levels kill them.|$|E
25|$|As in Campaign 139, the PAVN {{pulled up}} {{just short of}} {{overrunning}} Long Tieng and ending the Laotian Civil War. The Royalists were battered and in questionable shape to undertake an offensive. With further North Vietnamese offensives in the offing, the American government found itself presented with <b>a</b> <b>double-edged</b> dilemma. L'Armee Clandestine was the only Lao military force still ready to fight in northern Laosbut barely ready. Continued defense of Long Tieng could lead to their defeat and loss of the war. On the other hand, removing the Hmong from their traditional homeland might irretrievably break their fighting spirit, and lose the war. However, Ambassador G. McMurtrie Godley, who actually directed the war, believed that with the PAVN being attrited by air strikes, the Hmong could endure. Besides, Vang Pao had returned from hospital, and Hmong morale consequently perked up. On the other hand, CIA Chief of Station Hugh Tovar believed that the Lao were becoming disgusted with the Americans risking only money and supplies while Lao were being killed.|$|E
