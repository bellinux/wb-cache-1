40|$|The Chinese {{judicial}} system {{has long been}} criticized for its rampant local protectionism and corruption and its lack of protections for foreign parties. To avoid litigation in China, most foreign investors insist on arbitration clauses in their contract. But even if they win the arbitration, foreigners must return to the Chinese courts to enforce the arbitration awards. Western lawyers, scholars and business people have repeatedly criticized the Chinese courts for their unwillingness to enforce arbitration awards in favor of foreign investors in favor of Chinese parties. Over the last ten years, the Chinese Supreme People’s Court has attempted to address this dilemma by promulgating a series of regulations, including the 1995 Reporting Mechanism; the 1995 Judges Law; 1998 Regulations Regarding the Issues of Fees and Investigation Periods; and the 2003 Directive Limiting Jurisdiction over Arbitration Awards with Foreign Elements. Furthermore, the Chinese government has taken the unprecedented step of allowing Western educational programs within its borders to educate Chinese judges, attorneys and legal officials {{in order to improve}} judicial fairness for foreign investors. The Chinese government has also recently permitted domestic tribunals to accept foreign-related arbitral disputes, resulting in increased competition and quality among the <b>arbitral</b> <b>bodies.</b> In this paper I will briefly describe the history of arbitration in China and the current Chinese arbitration bodies, including the rapidly growing presence of domestic arbitral tribunals such as the Beijing Arbitration Commission (BAC). I will then describe the structural and procedural weaknesses in the Chinese {{judicial system}} which may lead to foreigners’ difficulty in collecting arbitration awards. I will describe the steps taken by the Chinese government, judicial system <b>arbitral</b> <b>bodies,</b> including CIETAC and BAC, in order to improve the climate for foreign businesses, as well as foreign parties’ attempts to assist in this process.

40|$|International {{arbitration}} is {{the process}} of resolving disputes between or among transnational parties through the use of one or more arbitrators rather than through the courts. It requires the agreement of the parties, which is usually given via an arbitration clause that is inserted into the contract or business agreement. The decision is usually binding. Arbitration is today most commonly used for the resolution of commercial disputes, particularly in the context of international commercial transactions (International Commercial Arbitration). It is also used in some countries to resolve other types of disputes, such as labour disputes, consumer disputes, and for the resolution of certain disputes between states and between investors and states. As the number of international disputes mushrooms, so too does the use of arbitration to resolve them. There are essentially two kinds of arbitration, ad hoc and institutional. An institutional arbitration is one that is entrusted to one of the major arbitration institutions to handle, while an ad hoc one is conducted independently without such an organization and according to the rules specified by the parties and their attorneys. Ad hoc, or unadministered, arbitration is flexible, relatively cheap and fast way of dispute settlement – if the parties co-operate. When parties are not able to co-operate, the assistance of an institution to move the arbitration forward is necessary. One reason for the growth of arbitration is that there are now many <b>arbitral</b> <b>bodies,</b> and parties can select one that is best suited to their needs. Some organizations welcome any type of dispute. In contrast, there are organizations that specialize in particular types of disputes, such as those involving investments (e. g. ICSID) or that focus on a particular topic, such as intellectual property disputes (e. g. WIPO Arbitration and Mediation Center), sports-related disputes (e. g. Court of Arbitration for Sport). Some <b>arbitral</b> <b>bodies</b> also specialize in disputes in particular industries (e. g. Society of Maritime Arbitrators). Another factor in selecting an institution {{is the nature of the}} party: One institution may be open only to states or member governments (e. g. WTO Dispute Settlement System), while another may be available to states or private parties (e. g. Permanent Court of Arbitration) ...|$|R
40|$|In 1958, the New York Convention was {{introduced}} by 24 signatories, superseding the previous international instruments and ushering {{in a new era}} of transnational commercial arbitration. The Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards, also referred to as the New York Convention (NYC), was created to encourage the settlement of international disputes through arbitration. It has been characterised as “one of the boldest attempts to enhance … arbitration and to achieve unification in state practice …”. This is buttressed by the fact that courts are perceived as having a pre-bias against hearing arbitration appeals. Ultimately, this is rooted in the objectives of the NYC and the courts’ respect for the contractual autonomy of the parties; thus courts exercise their discretion when faced with arbitral appeal. Party autonomy represents the autonomous will of the parties to a contract. However, the mere fact that parties contracted to go to arbitration can then appeal their award in national courts, demonstrates the extent to which arbitration is undeveloped as an independent, alternative dispute resolution mechanism. It is not surprising, therefore, that scholars have voiced concern over continued judicial intervention in arbitration under the umbrella of delocalisation theory. Thus, delocalisation supports the premise that arbitration should be wholly independent. However, without an appeal <b>arbitral</b> <b>body,</b> {{it would be difficult to}} give practical significance to this theoretical view. This raises the question of whether a diluted version of delocalisation, where court intervention is limited by the presence of an arbitral appeal body, is possible, and, if so, which form should it take? As a solution, we consider the possibility of creating an international appeal body modelled upon the international Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID) Additional Facility, which provides for appeal in international investment disputes. Against that background, the aim of this article is twofold. First, it will explore the development of the delocalisation theory with particular emphasis on the theoretical debate for and against continued court intervention. The aim is to find justification for delocalisation by limiting court intervention in arbitration. Secondly, it will explore the scope for reform through the institution of an appeal body. The aim is to consider implementing an international commercial <b>arbitral</b> <b>body</b> to complement ICSID Additional Facility. Last but not least, a circumspect conclusion will be reached in regards to the direction of future legal development in this area...|$|E
40|$|Historically, {{the commissioners}} of the U. S. {{professional}} sports league {{have had a}} duty to preserve {{the integrity of the}} leagues. Developing from this concept through collective bargaining between the leagues and players’ associations, the disciplinary systems of the leagues are designed to keep conflicts out of the U. S. courts. Recently, these systems have come under considerable public scrutiny questioning their fairness and effectiveness and, in some cases, the integrity of the commissioners and sports. Specifically, there have been issues with conflict of interest of the commissioners and arbitrary decision-making in disciplining players. This Comment explores the disciplinary systems of the four major U. S. professional sports leagues to determine whether they currently preserve justice. It then examines some of the most successful international sports disputes systems as a comparison. To preserve the public’s faith in the integrity of sport, this Comment proposes a new independent <b>arbitral</b> <b>body,</b> the American Sports Arbitral Tribunal (ASAT), which would hear the disciplinary appeals from these U. S. professional sports leagues, at least removing the potential conflict of interest within the current systems. Finally, this Comment concludes that the leagues and players’ associations would have to help create and incorporate this ASAT, but likely will not because nearly all of the collective bargaining negotiations involve mainly monetary distribution. Unfortunately, this may lead to the public losing faith in these sports leagues...|$|E
40|$|The Court of {{arbitration}} {{in sport}} represents an <b>arbitral</b> <b>body</b> whose {{task is to}} resolve the most significant disputes in the international community, within the autonomy of sport. With its adaptation to the contemporary system of sovereign states, by applying the classical principles of arbitration, {{with some degree of}} correction due to the specificity of sport, as well as the application of appropriate norms of international public law, achieved a situation that arbitration decisions of the Court are final. Despite its importance in the international community, domestic legal theory does not pay adequate attention to the above phenomenon. The task {{of this paper is to}} draw attention of the wider legal population to the existence of the Court of Arbitration in Sport, as well as pointing out the specifics of the Court of Arbitration in Sport to those skilled in classic commercial arbitration. Smaller or greater variations from the classical principles of commercial arbitration are conditioned by the specificity of social relations in sport. The focus of the analysis is placed primarily on issues of the legal fiction of arbitral tribunal seat, mandatory clause of acceptance of jurisdiction, the existence of the closed list of arbitrators and the lack of choice of arbitrators in the case of Ad hoc divisions, prohibition of addressing to the ordinary courts to establish a temporary measures and exclusive jurisdiction of CAS in a given matter, the publication of arbitral awards and 24 -hour deadline for the application of the prescribed procedures and decision-making in the case of Ad hoc divisions...|$|E
40|$|Global Legal Pluralism is now {{recognized}} as an entrenched reality of the international and transnational legal order. Indeed, wherever one looks, there is conflict among multiple legal regimes. Some of these regimes are state-based, some are built and maintained by non-state actors, some fall within the purview of local authorities and jurisdictional entities, and some involve international courts, tribunals, <b>arbitral</b> <b>bodies,</b> and regulatory organizations. It has been approximately 20 years since scholars first began pushing the insights of legal pluralism into the transnational and international arena. During those two decades, a rich body of work has established pluralism as a useful descriptive and normative framework for understanding a world of overlapping jurisdictional assertions, both state and non-state. Indeed, {{there has been a}} veritable explosion of scholarly work on legal pluralism, soft law, global constitutionalism, the relationships among relative authorities, and the fragmentation and reinforcement of territorial boundaries. Thus, {{the time has come for}} a survey and analysis of this literature in order to understand the evolution of global legal pluralism as a scholarly trope. In this chapter, I seek to begin such a task by separating out some of the descriptive and normative strands in the scholarly discourse. In addition, I tackle challenges and criticisms of global legal pluralism and aim to refine the field based on recent research. The result, I hope, will be to re-energize and engage global legal pluralism scholarship and push its trajectory forward into another two decades of innovation...|$|R
40|$|With the {{new wave}} of claims against {{corporations}} for human rights violations – particularly in the context of aiding and abetting government abuse – there are unusually difficult problems of joint tortfeasor liability. In many circumstances, one tortfeasor – the corporation – is a deep-pocketed defendant, easily subject to suit, but only marginally involved in the unlawful conduct. Another tortfeasor – the sovereign – is a central player in the unlawful conduct, but, with limited exceptions, is immune from suit under the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act. A third tortfeasor – the low-level security personnel – accused of actually committing the atrocity, is beyond the jurisdictional reach of the forum and is an insolvent, judgment-proof defendant. How should an adjudicator apportion responsibility among these joint tortfeasors? Does it matter that the principal players are immune or insolvent, while the marginal player is not? In apportioning responsibility, is it relevant that one tortfeasor simply knew of the misconduct or was negligent with respect to its likely occurrence, although it did not intend for the violation to occur? Despite the saliency of these questions, international law does not provide the answers. These problems are only exacerbated by the fact that international law violations can be pursued in multiple arenas – in national courts, international tribunals, and international <b>arbitral</b> <b>bodies.</b> As a general rule, international tribunals will resolve the question of apportioning liability using public international law, while domestic courts will resolve the question by recourse to private international law, and arbitral panels will rely on the governing law of the contract. The approach for resolving questions of apportionment will differ in these contexts, although each will resort to domestic tort law in one way or another...|$|R
50|$|BAC {{headquarters}} {{is located in}} the Central Business District (CBD) of Beijing. The office includes multiple international arbitration halls equipped with simultaneous translation systems and videoconferencing for oral hearings or international seminars. The BAC Committee — the BAC's governing body — is composed of one Chairman, four Vice-Chairpersons, and ten Committee Members. Many of the previous and current Vice-Chairpersons and Members are experienced specialists in law, economics, and trade. The Members' responsibilities include formulating and revising the BAC's Constitution and rules, creating a Panel of Arbitrators, and selecting and dismissing arbitrators. In pursuit of fair and unbiased arbitrations, the Commission does not participate in specific arbitral proceedings. The <b>Arbitral</b> Tribunal, a <b>body</b> of arbitrators independent of the Commission, alone determines awards of specific cases. The Commission's involvement only occurs when an arbitral tribunal makes technical and major substantive errors.

40|$|The {{international}} athletic community’s {{preference for}} arbitration over traditional domestic courts {{to settle disputes}} between individual athletes and their respective sports governing bodies {{has led to the}} development of an authority specializing in international sports dispute resolution—the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS). Originally created in 1984 by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) to hear Olympic disputes, CAS has developed into the exclusive <b>arbitral</b> <b>body</b> for international sports disputes, and clauses granting CAS exclusive authority are found in essentially all contracts between individual athletes and their respective athletic federation. Although, CAS functions as the “Supreme Court” of Sports and is credited for developing a set of principles and rules in international sports law, CAS has been criticized for its close ties to the IOC. Individual athletes have increasingly challenged CAS’ independence and impartiality. In a case captivating the international athletic community, world-class German speed skater Claudia Pechstein challenged her suspension in her domestic courts, which for the first time reached her nation’s highest court. If domestic courts question CAS’ authority, declaring the forum is not independent and impartial, it would encourage other athletes to follow suit and ultimately lead to the destruction of international sports law. This Note will examine whether CAS is the most objective forum to settle international sports disputes. In order for CAS to function as international sport’s “Supreme Court” and continue the essential development of international sports law, institutional reforms must be implemented. This Note begins by discussing international arbitration and highlighting how CAS evolved into the primary forum for settling international sports disputes. The Note will then examine Claudia Pechstein’s case in her national courts and the European Court of Human Rights, which threaten to destroy CAS’ supreme authority and expose the forum’s deficiencies of impartiality and independence. The Note will then compare CAS arbitration to dispute resolution processes utilized by professional sports leagues in Europe and the United States, concluding that CAS should reform its arbitrator selection methods to be modeled after the United Kingdom’s “Sport Resolutions. ” Arbitration selection clauses should be redesigned to implement tripanel arbitrations to facilitate more balanced and independent arbitral decisions. Further, this Note will propose that CAS give precedential value in published award decisions to compel consistent and fair rulings...|$|E
40|$|Council Regulation (EC) No 44 / 2001 on {{jurisdiction}} and {{the recognition}} and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters (the Brussels I Regulation) has been considered the most important legal document {{in the area of}} civil procedure on EU level. Article 1 (2) (d) of the Regulation excludes arbitration from the scope of application of the Brussels I Regulation. However, the ECJ interpreted the arbitration exclusion narrowly in Case C- 185 / 07 Allianz SpA & Generali Assicurazioni Generali SpA v. West Tankers Inc. (2009) ECR I- 663. In practice, this preliminary ruling watered down the arbitration exclusion in the Regulation, and thereby caused an intensive debate on the influence of EU legislation on international arbitration. Case law of the ECJ has shown that the scope of application of the Regulation and the arbitration exclusion in it depends on the substantive subject matter of the dispute in question. If that subject matter falls within the scope of the Regulation, a court which has jurisdiction under the Regulation is entitled to examine whether the arbitration exception applies and, depending on its assessment of the validity of the arbitration agreement, to refer the case to the <b>arbitral</b> <b>body</b> or adjudicate the matter itself. The revised Regulation (EU) No 1215 / 2012 becomes applicable on matters issued as of 10 January 2015. The result of the revision is that the arbitration exclusion remains unchanged, however with an added recital (12) in the preamble. This has left the arbitration audience and legal scholars somewhat confused concerning the reasons for keeping the arbitration exclusion unaltered in the revised Regulation. This thesis examines the factors that have led to the current legal situation in the area of EU civil procedure, in particular concerning arbitration. It also provides an analysis of what the revision of the Regulation signifies in practice. Lastly, it contemplates what the standpoint of the CJEU potentially will be in future arbitration proceedings in the light of i. e. West Tankers and based on the revised Regulation. The revised Regulation introduces some key changes originally aiming to make the {{recognition and enforcement}} of judgments given by the Member States’ courts easier and more effective. However, contrary to the arbitration community’s expectations, the Regulation has not fully clarified the interface between the Regulation and arbitration. The added recital only provides assistance to some extent, and it seems that we stand before a revision that chose status quo instead of presenting any revolutionary renovations to the arbitration exclusion...|$|E
