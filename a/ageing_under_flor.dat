5000|$|Amontillado is {{a variety}} of Sherry that is first <b>aged</b> <b>under</b> <b>flor</b> but which is then exposed to oxygen, {{producing}} a sherry that is darker than a Fino but lighter than an Oloroso. Naturally dry, they are sometimes sold lightly to medium sweetened but these {{can no longer be}} labelled as Amontillado.|$|R
50|$|Palo Cortado {{is a rare}} {{variety of}} sherry that is {{initially}} <b>aged</b> <b>under</b> <b>flor</b> to become a fino or amontillado, but inexplicably loses its veil of flor and begins aging oxidatively as an oloroso. The result is a wine {{with some of the}} richness of oloroso and some of the crispness of amontillado. Only about 1-2% of the grapes pressed for sherry naturally develop into palo cortado.|$|R

In 1910 (other sources give the year 1915) Ernest Schuyten emigrated to the USA, settled in New Orleans and later became a naturalized citizen of the United States.

He created the Collegium Musicum there, developing {{his interest in}} Renaissance and Baroque music, later expanding his activities to include the Classical and early Romantic eras. He is now in demand as a fortepianist in concert halls across Europe, where he {{is known for his}} refined sensitivity to the rhetorical aspects of music and for his skills in improvisation. (His cadenzas were singled out in reviews of his Beethoven concerto recordings.) Over the years, he has acquired a unique collection of period keyboard instruments, which travel with him for concerts and CD recordings.|$|R
