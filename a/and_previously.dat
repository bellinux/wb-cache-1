5|$|An American Museum of Natural History {{expedition}} led by Sydney Anderson {{collected the}} first three specimens of Oecomys sydandersoni in 1964 and 1965. The material was mentioned in passing in {{a report on the}} chiggers of the region and tentatively identified as O.concolor in publications of the 1990s. During studies in the Noel Kempff Mercado National Park (NKMNP) from 1997 to 2006, Smithsonian zoologist Louise Emmons and coworkers obtained large series of Oecomys, including four species—Oecomys bicolor, Oecomys roberti, Oecomys trinitatis, and a fourth species they could not identify to species level. In 2009, Michael Carleton, Louise Emmons, and Guy Musser described the latter as a new species, Oecomys sydandersoni, referring to it the specimens collected in the 1960s <b>and</b> <b>previously</b> identified as O.concolor. They named the new species after Sydney Anderson in honor of his work on the Bolivian mammal fauna, including the first collection of O.sydandersoni.|$|E

5|$|At the intersection, Routes957 and958 become {{concurrent}} along a westbound residential street, until leaving Lottsville, {{where the}} two routes turn to the southwest in fields. As Routes 957 and958 approach a railroad line used by Norfolk Southern (<b>and</b> <b>previously</b> the Erie Railroad), Route958 forks to the north, paralleling and soon crossing the rails northwest of Lottsville. The distinctively rural surroundings for Route958 return, and the Norfolk Southern line parallels to the east as the highway curves northwestward. Soon, Route958 returns to a farming region and curves away from the railroad on a mountainside. After passing a large pond, the route intersects Greeley Street a t-intersection in Bear Lake, where Route958 turns eastward through the rural areas before intersecting with North Road, where the route turns northward and reaches the New York state line near Niobe, New York. Route958 terminates here, and the right-of-way continues northward as Chautauqua County Route33 (PanamaBear Lake Road).|$|E
