5|$|Pest species adapt {{readily to}} a variety of environments, but prefer warm {{conditions}} found within buildings. Many tropical species prefer even warmer environments. Cockroaches are mainly nocturnal and run away when exposed to light. An exception to this is the <b>Asian</b> <b>cockroach,</b> which flies mostly at night but is attracted to brightly-lit surfaces and pale colors.|$|E
50|$|Blattella asahinai, the <b>Asian</b> <b>{{cockroach}}</b> is {{a species}} of cockroach that was first described in 1981 from insects collected on Okinawa Island, Japan.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Asian</b> <b>cockroach</b> {{is nearly}} {{identical}} to the German cockroach (Blattella germanica) {{except for a few}} minor morphological differences. Like the German cockroach, it is about 1.6 cm long, is tan to brown in color, and has wings. However, its wings are longer than the German cockroach, and {{there is a difference between}} a groove in the abdomen between the two species. There are other differences. The quickest way to tell the difference between the two species is that the <b>Asian</b> <b>cockroach</b> is a strong flyer (almost like a moth) and is attracted to light, unlike the German cockroach. This species tends to prefer the outdoors, whereas the German cockroach prefers living indoors.|$|E
50|$|According to {{entomologist}} Bob Pfannenstiel (Beneficial Insects Research Unit, Weslaco, Texas), this omnivorous species also feeds, {{under certain}} conditions, on the eggs of lepidopteran pests of annual crops. <b>Asian</b> <b>cockroaches</b> ventured west into Texas in 2006, {{and became the}} most common predator of bollworm eggs in the state's Rio Grande Valley region. The bollworm threatens cotton, soybean, corn and tomato crops.|$|R
40|$|The {{hydrocarbon}} {{components of}} <b>Asian</b> and German <b>cockroaches</b> showed consistent differences by gas chromatography (GC) {{that did not}} depend on geographic origin, sex or age, and that did reliably identify individuals of these otherwise morphologically similar species. European honey bee workers and drones showed consistent GC patterns. Race-specific similarities in GC patterns were present in Africanized workers and drones from Central and South America. Principal components analysis separated data from different races. Comb waxes reflected the genetic ancestry of the workers that produced that wax. GC data was used to construct phenetic comparisons of 26 species and subspecies of tsetse flies using dried museum and fresh specimens...|$|R
40|$|The {{identification}} of various life stages of three species of cockroaches {{was accomplished by}} using gas chromatography for the quantitative determination of cuticular hydrocarbon components. Dried and frozen specimens of wild and laboratory samples of the closely related species, Blattella asahinai Mizukubo and B. germanica (L.), were identified by inspection of chromatographic data. The cuticular hydrocarbons of each species were identified by mass spectrometry and found to be quite unlike those of the distantly related B. vaga Hebard. A statistical technique is described that provides a quantitative approach to numerical pattern recognition of chromatograms for identifying <b>Asian</b> and German <b>cockroaches.</b> In an experiment conducted to evaluate the operational efficiency of this technique for species identification, 63 blind samples of whole cockroaches (37), oothecae (6), and legs, wings, or cast skins (20) from German-like cockroaches including hybrids, were successfully identified...|$|R
50|$|The German {{cockroach}} (Blattella germanica) {{is a small}} {{species of}} cockroach, typically about 1.1 to 1.6 cm long. In colour it varies from tan to almost black, and it has two dark, roughly parallel, streaks on the pronotum running anteroposteriorly from behind the head {{to the base of}} the wings. Although Blattella germanica has wings, it can barely fly, although it may glide when disturbed. Of the few species of cockroach that are domestic pests, it probably is the most widely troublesome example. It is very closely related to the <b>Asian</b> <b>cockroach,</b> and to the casual observer the two appear nearly identical and may be mistaken for each other. However, the <b>Asian</b> <b>cockroach</b> is attracted to light and can fly rather like a moth, while the German cockroach cannot.|$|E

50|$|Blattella asahinai {{is found}} in {{tropical}} and subtropical climates, and was first identified in the United States in 1986 in Lakeland, Florida. It has since expanded throughout much of Florida and is spreading into other southern states. In addition to Florida, it is reported in Alabama, Georgia, South Carolina, and Texas. Its population reaches its zenith in late August and declines rapidly {{with the onset of}} cool weather (Snoddy and Appel 2007). During adverse weather conditions such as cold weather or dry conditions, the <b>Asian</b> <b>cockroach</b> will burrow down into the leaf litter (Snoddy and Appel 2007).|$|E
40|$|The <b>Asian</b> <b>cockroach,</b> Blattella asahinai Mizukubo, a close {{relative}} of the German cockroach, B. germanica (L.), has been discovered in over 900 km 2 from Tampa to Lakeland, Fla., and is prevalent in citrus groves, wooded areas, lawns, and homes. Differentiation of the two species is best accomplished by the diagnostic behavior of the Asian cockroach-it is crepuscular (sunset) and nocturnal, readily flies, is attracted at sunset to light-colored or brightly lit surfaces, and lives outdoors in large numbers. Analyses of microhabitat composition of 86 trap sites indicate that the principal habitat of the <b>Asian</b> <b>cockroach</b> is leaf litter in shaded areas. Here, the densities of nymphs and females bearing oothecae were highest. All other adults were more diffusely distributed. Asian cockroaches {{may be difficult to}} control because of the mobility of the species and the common occurrence of feral reservoirs...|$|E
40|$|Differentiation of Blattella asahinai Mizukubo, Blattella vaga Hebard, and Blattella germanica (L.) was {{investigated}} using polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP). DNA fragments corresponding to mitochondrial CO 1,CO 1 /TL 2 (small and large fragments), and ITS 2 regions were amplified using PCR. The universal primers used for amplifying mitochondrial CO 1 and CO 1 /TL 2 (small and large fragments) were CO 1 -J- 1718 /CO 1 - N- 2191, CO 1 -J- 2441 /TL 2 -N- 3014, and CO 1 -J- 1751 /TL 2 -N- 3014. Amplification was observed with all primer combinations, but diagnostic patterns were found only with AluI digested amplicons of CO 1 and CO 1 /TL 2 (large fragments) regions. Both inter/intraspecific polymorphism was observed for the 517 bp CO 1 region between German (A, B) and Asian (A, B, C) cockroach populations. Polymorphic form B of the <b>Asian</b> <b>cockroach</b> (374 and 179 bp fragments) was {{nearly identical to}} the field cockroach (370 and 178 bp fragments). The CO 1 amplicon (517 bp) differentiated German and field cockroaches but not Asian and field cockroaches. The CO 1 /TL 2 amplicons (1275 bp) digested with AluI clearly differentiated all three species. The <b>Asian</b> <b>cockroach</b> had a distinct 540 bp fragment, whereas the field cockroach had a 403 bp fragment and the German cockroach lacked both fragments. Intraspecific polymorphs for CO 1 /TL 2 amplicons (1275 bp) were observed with the German cockroach only. Portions of the CO 1 and TL 2 genes were sequenced, revealing 76 % identity among German, Asian, and field cockroaches. Sequence data also revealed that German and Asian cockroaches were {{more closely related to}} each other than to the field cockroach...|$|E
