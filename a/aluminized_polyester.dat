50|$|A 20 ft tall {{stainless}} steel tree, a sculpture by Dartmouth artist Dawn MacNutt, {{was installed in}} the main foyer in early 2008. Entitled Together We Stand, it is suspended in the 3-storey atrium at the axis {{of the building and}} is made of steel wiring with leaves of <b>aluminized</b> <b>polyester</b> woven in Switzerland. Works of similar construction by the same artist can be found at Alderney Landing. The piece was originally located {{in the lobby of the}} Infirmary building at the nearby Queen Elizabeth II Health Sciences Centre until renovations there necessitated its donation to the school.|$|E
40|$|The NASA/USAF {{program on}} the Environmental Charging of Spacecraft Surfaces consists, in part, of {{experimental}} efforts directed toward evaluating the response of materials to the environmental charged particle flux. Samples of thermal blankets of the type to be used on the Global Positioning System Flight Space Vehicles were tested to determine their response to electron flux. The primary result observed was that no discharges were obtained with the quartz-fiber-fabric-covered multilayer insulation specimen. The taped <b>aluminized</b> <b>polyester</b> grounding system used on all specimens {{did not appear to}} grossly deteriorate with time; however, the specimens require specific external pressure to maintain constant grounding system resistance...|$|E
40|$|Holograms gives a three {{dimensional}} perception {{by including}} {{information on the}} depth. Electro forming technique has been utilized for duplicating the holoW 3 pbic designs produced on the optical glass. For the reproduction of the 3 D images on the <b>aluminized</b> <b>polyester</b> film hard electrofomled nickel stampers are produced from sulphamate bath. Nickel can be deposited either as a soft coating characterized by excellent ductility or as a hard coating to resist wear and tear depending on the applications. ntis could be achieved by proper conditioning of the sulphamate bath and also by tbe use of suitable addition agents.

40|$|Parabolic and spherical mirrors are {{constructed}} of <b>aluminized</b> PET <b>polyester</b> film on urethane foam. During construction, the chosen {{shape of the}} mirror is created by manipulating the elastic/plastic behavior of the film with air pressure. Foam is then applied to the film and, once hardened, air pressure is removed. At an f-number of 0. 68, preliminary models have an optical angular spread of less than 0. 25 degrees, a factor of 3. 3 smaller than that for a perfectly spherical mirror. The possibility exists for creating large-lightweight mirrors with excellent shape and stiffness. These "film-on-foam" construction techniques may also be applicable to parabolic-trough solar concentrators but {{do not appear to}} be suitable for optical imaging applications because of irregularities in the film.

30|$|In 2002, Pellegrino [29] {{from the}} University of Cambridge, {{developed}} an elastic ribs driven membrane antenna with {{a diameter of}} 1.5 m, which achieved a surface accuracy of 2.0 mm RMS, as shown in Figure  4. The reflector was composed of 12 elastic ribs, a central hub, and <b>aluminized</b> <b>polyester</b> film. When the antenna was folded, the ribs and film were twisted on the central hub and bound by rope. Once the rope was cut, the ribs released elastic potential energy to drive the membrane reflector deployment. Pellegrino designed the antenna diameter, focal length, surface accuracy, and membrane stress distribution and performed the deployment experiment. However, several elastic ribs were damaged because of an improper folding approach, and, in consequence, the 12 elastic ribs were deployed simultaneously. Therefore, further study is needed in antenna folding approaches.|$|E
40|$|Candidates for {{reflector}} panel design concepts, including materials and configurations, were identified. The large {{list of candidates}} was screened and reduced to the five most promising ones. Cost and technical factors were used in making the final choices for the panel conceptual design, which was a stiffened steel skin substrate with a bonded, acrylic overcoated, <b>aluminized</b> <b>polyester</b> film reflective surface. Computer simulations were run for the concentrator optics using the selected panel design, and experimentally determined specularity and reflectivity values. Intercept factor curves and energy to the aperture curves were produced. These curves indicate that surface errors of 2 mrad (milliradians) or less {{would be required to}} capture the desired energy for a Brayton cycle 816 C case. Two test panels were fabricated to demonstrate manufacturability and optically tested for surface error. Surface errors in the range of 1. 75 mrad and 2. 2 mrad were measured...|$|E
40|$|The {{magnetic}} field noise in superconducting quantum interference devices (SQUIDs) used for biomagnetic research such as magnetoencephalography or ultra-low-field {{nuclear magnetic resonance}} is usually limited by instrumental dewar noise. We constructed a wideband, ultra-low noise system with a 45 mm diameter superconducting pick-up coil inductively coupled to a current sensor SQUID. Thermal noise in the liquid helium dewar is minimized by using <b>aluminized</b> <b>polyester</b> fabric as superinsulation and aluminum oxide strips as heat shields, respectively. With a magnetometer pick-up coil {{in the center of}} the Berlin magneti- cally shielded room 2 (BMSR 2) a noise level of around 150 aT Hz^- 1 / 2 is achieved in the white noise regime between about 20 kHz and the system bandwidth of about 2. 5 MHz. At lower frequencies, the resolution is limited by {{magnetic field}} noise arising from the walls of the shielded room. Modeling the BMSR 2 as a closed cube with continuous μ-metal walls we can quantitatively reproduce its measured field noise. Comment: 4 pages, 3 figure...|$|E
40|$|The flour {{from the}} presscake in the {{production}} of Cucurbita pepo var. styriaca seed virgin oil has features that make it interesting for use in baked goods and pasta production because of its characteristic green color, intense flavor and nutritional benefits. To determine the nutritional composition of this new product, elaborations of flour were made with seeds from Uruguay and Europe. They were analyzed for moisture, fat content, protein, ash, fiber, sodium, vitamin B 1, vitamin E, fatty acid profile, sterols, amino acids and total carbohydrates. Physicochemical and microbiological stability have been studied for  12 months at ambient conditions with the flour packaged with a polyethylene, polyester and aluminum tri-laminate. The flour is characterized as a vegetable protein product (48, 3 %) and as an important source of fiber (11 %). It has 21, 7 % of lipids of which  38 % are MUFA and 53, 4 % are PUFA, highlighting the oleic and linoleic acid contents what makes it desirable from nutritional and culinary standpoints. It features 3, 7 mg of vitamin E per 100 g and 2967 mg / kg of sterols. In flour from the presscake in the production of pumpkin seed virgin oil acidity and moisture remains stable, while the fungi and yeasts number decrease during  12 months in ambient conditions used in this study, with trilaminate polyethylene <b>aluminized</b> <b>polyester...</b>|$|E
40|$|Abstract. For medium range {{temperature}} applications, focusing type collectors like Compound Parabolic Concentrator (CPC) {{are most}} commonly used. Consi-derable research {{work has been}} carried out to improve the performance of the two-dimensional compound parabolic concentrator (2 D CPC). The three-dimensional compound parabolic concentrator (3 D CPC) was found to be more efficient than 2 D CPC because of the higher concentration ratio. In the present work a 3 D CPC was fabricated with a half acceptance angle of 4 ◦ for a spherical absorber of radius 100 mm. UV stabilized <b>aluminized</b> <b>polyester</b> foil having high reflectivity (0 · 85) was pasted on the reflector for a total height of 441 mm and an aperture width of 540 mm. The optical efficiency was estimated theoretically and compared with the experimental value. Experimentally determined values of optical and thermal efficiencies were in good agreement with theoretically predicted value. The exper-imental results shown that the optical efficiency obtained from the 3 D CPC (0 · 626) was significantly higher than that of the 2 D CPC (0 · 570) of similar dimensions. Since the optical efficiency of the 3 D CPC was increased, the thermal efficiency of the collector was also increased. In addition to that, time constant of the concen-trator was also calculated. The time constant of the 3 D CPC (431 s) was fairly high when compared with the 2 D CPC (110 s). An attempt was made to generate low pressure steam using 3 D CPC in the in situ steam generation mode. The efficiency of the steam generation was about 38 %, {{which was one of the}} possible applications of 3 D CPC module...|$|E
