So he said, 'Oh, {{you want to do that}} happy stuff? All right, all right.' He was not into doing it.

[...] "We used vocals from {{the song that}} didn't make the Thriller album", stated {{producer}} Rodney Jerkins. [...] "He [...] had more vocals and ad-libs that were never heard, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>used</b> {{the ones that were}} not heard." [...] Jackson hand delivered his original masters to Monica, who, as a longtime Jackson fan, was touched by the move.|$|E

It felt like two summers before that shit blew up.” [...] "Thanda Thanda Pani" [...] (Cold Cold Water) by Baba Sehgal was inspired heavily by Vanilla Ice's music and style. Rapper Riff Raff has mentioned in interviews that Vanilla Ice {{was one of his}} biggest influence.|$|E

500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "Kitty Kat" [...] was {{directed}} by Melina Matsoukas and co-directed by Knowles for the B'Day Anthology Video Album, which was released the same month. It was the first video of the eight videos shot in two weeks for the album. The music video for [...] "Kitty Kat" [...] is only one-minute long and it serves as the introduction for the music video of [...] "Green Light". On the other hand, Matsoukas said that the half-day shoot for [...] "Kitty Kat", by comparison, [...] "was a breeze." [...] Elaborating on the conception of the video, Knowles said: [...] "We had the oversized kitty cat , which was so cute! I had to pretend it was there, because I was really {{in front of the}} green screen — I'd be on a big giant wooden cow and they superimposed a kitten. <b>And</b> <b>we</b> <b>used</b> leopard-print makeup and the catsuit and the nails to make me more like a cat. I really am a cat person".|$|E
500|$|The other {{material}} on Eat a Peach comes from live recordings. Dowd later said, [...] "When we recorded At Fillmore East, {{we ended up}} with almost a whole other album's worth of good material, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>used</b> [...] tracks on Eat a Peach. Again, there was no overdubbing". Dowd started the mixing process for Eat a Peach but had run overtime and was called to commitments with Crosby, Stills and Nash; longtime Allman friend and colleague Johnny Sandlin took over for the remaining mixes. Sandlin later said of the mixing process, [...] "As I mixed songs like [...] "Blue Sky," [...] I knew, of course, that I was listening to the last things that Duane ever played and there was just such a mix of beauty and sadness, knowing there's {{not going to be any}} more from him". He was particularly proud of his mixing work on the album, but was angry because he did not receive credit, only a [...] "special thanks." ...|$|E
500|$|First-time X-Files {{director}} Paul Shapiro was {{tasked with}} directing the episode. Many {{of the physical}} effects in the episode were coordinated by Danny Weselis, who noted that the episode contained several scenes featuring extensive stunt work. He explained, [...] "during the bar explosions we had {{a room full of}} stunt people showered with broken glass. <b>And</b> <b>we</b> <b>used</b> stunt people for much of the missionary and special agent fights." [...] The final scene, featuring a stadium full of people attacking each other after the Templetons make an appearance, was filmed at the Grand Olympic Auditorium in Los Angeles. Several hundred extras were contacted via ads on the internet and in select publications. The scene took two days to completely film. The crowd supplemented sixteen stuntmen and over 200 cardboard cutouts to give the stadium a filled-out feel. In order to create a mock fight, staff members gave the several hundred extras soft props to hit each other with. Producer Harry Bring later noted, [...] "a few of [...] members got carried away and we had to tell them to settle down." [...] During the finished episode, a split screen was inserted as a way to enhance the scene and allow the viewer to [...] "focus on various angles of action".|$|E

500|$|For {{the timing}} of {{introducing}} the new characters, the showrunners decided to introduce the Punisher immediately and hold back on Elektra briefly, with Ramirez explaining that [...] "one of the pitfalls when we have this many great characters to play with is wanting to throw them at the wall", but {{it was important to}} take the time to introduce the new characters properly to the audience, particularly to the people who weren't already familiar with them. Elaborating on the aim to keep the story focused on Murdock, Petrie revealed that the writers would often come up with [...] "amazing stuff" [...] for the season, but then realize that they had forgotten about Murdock and had to [...] "completely turn it over and look at how this affects Matt and filter it through that prism." [...] Ramirez added,It could easily become The Punisher story or the Elektra story that Matt cameos in, and not vice versa. So, we built it like a Matt story, in terms of what we wanted to put him through, where we wanted to get him, by the end of the season, and what we wanted to have him learn about himself, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>used</b> an Elektra and Frank story throughout, to get him there... we talked about when we watch shows in 13 episode stretches, how do we watch them? What is an exciting structure that we would like to think about here? Do we divide it right down the middle? Do we do a three-act structure?...If you were to sit and watch 13 episodes, you would absolutely feel a structure, much like in the comics. That’s what we did this season.|$|E
500|$|Before the 2002–03 NBA season, Don Nelson and Mark Cuban {{put more}} {{emphasis}} on defense in the training drills, specialising in a zone defense anchored by prolific shotblockers Raef LaFrentz and Shawn Bradley. The Mavericks won their first eleven games, and Finley, Nash and Nowitzki were voted [...] "Western Conference Players of the Month" [...] in November 2002. In that season, Nowitzki lifted his averages again, now scoring 25.1 points, 9.9 rebounds and 3.0 assists per game. In addition, the German had 41 double-double games, the seventh highest figure that season. By averaging 25.1, {{he became the first}} European to score 2,000 points in a season. As a reward, he was voted into the All-Star Game and the All-NBA Second Team again, and was also runner-up in the [...] "German Athlete of the Year" [...] election, only losing to ski jumper Sven Hannawald. He led the Mavericks to a franchise-high 60–22 record, which earned them the third seed: as a result, the Mavericks had to play sixth seed Portland Trail Blazers in the 2003 NBA Playoffs. Now playing in a best-of-seven series instead of the former best-of-five, the Mavericks quickly won the first three games, but then completely lost their rhythm and the next three. In Game 7, Portland held the game close, but Nowitzki hit a clutch three to make it 100–94 with 1:21 left and the Mavericks won 107–95. [...] "This was the most important basket of my career", he later said, [...] "I was not prepared to go on vacation that early." [...] He later added in an ESPN interview: [...] "We had to be more physical in the paint and rebound the ball. We worked hard all season to get the home-court advantage <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>used</b> that advantage today." ...|$|E

2500|$|The album's working {{title was}} Strawberries for Pigs, a name {{inspired}} by the reception the band's newer music received from some of their older fans. As Vanian explained, [...] "we were playing {{a lot of new}} material, and we had an audience that didn't want to hear about anything, they just wanted to hear Neat Neat Neat and New Rose nothing else. And they wanted to just smash everything. And they weren't interested in hearing music at all.

This procedure produces extraneous solutions, but when we have found the correct ones by numerical means we can also write down {{the roots of the}} quintic in terms of square roots, cube roots, and the Bring radical, which is therefore an algebraic solution in terms of algebraic functions of a single variable mdash& an algebraic solution of the general quintic.|$|E
2500|$|Photography for {{the album}} was done by George DuBose, who had also done {{photography}} for the band's previous three releases: Subterranean Jungle, Too Tough to Die, and Animal Boy. The front cover's picture was taken in Chinatown, New York City, in an old stairwell where they had DuBose's cousin and his cousin's friend—who are credited as [...] "Husky Bros." [...] on the Halfway to Sanity liner notes— blocked off the crowd while the photo session was in place. By 4:30 pm, DuBose and other crew members had set up red lighting and a fog machine. After DuBose's camera went through three reels of photos, Johnny insisted that was enough, to which DuBose replied that the record company was paying {{him a lot of}} money for the shoot, so they should make it worth while. The photo session, however, only lasted about ten to fifteen minutes, and was done in a poorly lit area, which Johnny said was [...] "pretty good not to make us look old, and it was getting harder and harder." [...] The back cover photograph was also shot by DuBose, which features green tombstones in a Jewish cemetery. He also took the inner sleeve photos, which depict [...] "Peking ducks hanging in the window of a restaurant, with glaze dripping off their tails, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>used</b> them for the inner sleeve," [...] according to DuBose.|$|E
