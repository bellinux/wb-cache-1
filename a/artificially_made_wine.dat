Within the Kančí obora floodplain forest the most diversified assemblage was found in the new made complex of three pools, the Palachy (16 species) because of its permanent connection with hydrological systém. The species Rutilus rutilus, Scardinius erythrophthalmus, Blicca bjoerkna occured most. In the original pool U svaleného dubu (14 species) were the R. rutilus, S. erythrophthalmus species most frequent. Within the Soutok area in the <b>artificially</b> <b>made</b> complex of two pools, the Kesle, 9 fish species were found. The species Abramis ballerus occured most. In the original pool, the Krumpava, 10 fish species were found with A. ballerus occuring most as well.

50|$|The 14C isotope is {{important}} in distinguishing biosynthetized materials from man-made ones. Biogenic chemicals are derived from biospheric carbon, which contains 14C. Carbon in <b>artificially</b> <b>made</b> chemicals is usually derived from fossil fuels like coal or petroleum, where the 14C originally present has decayed below detectable limits. The amount of 14C currently present in a sample therefore indicates the proportion of carbon of biogenic origin.|$|R
