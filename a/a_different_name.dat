5|$|St Georges Stadium {{also played}} host to Ruislip Manor F.C. between 1938 and 2008, (when the ground was known by <b>a</b> <b>different</b> <b>name)</b> before the non-league club folded {{following}} a period of financial uncertainty during its latter two trading years.|$|E
5|$|In 1985, guitarist Fredrik Thordendal {{formed a}} band in Umeå, a college town in {{northern}} Sweden {{with a population}} of 105,000. The band, originally named Metallien, recorded a number of demo tapes, after which it disbanded. Thordendal, however, continued playing under <b>a</b> <b>different</b> <b>name</b> with new band members.|$|E

25|$|In {{addition}} to these studios, BBC News used a number of studios for the frequent news bulletins. These studios have <b>a</b> <b>different</b> <b>naming</b> system owing to their permanent usage and were not included on most studio lists, as they were unavailable for hire.|$|R
5|$|The {{paper was}} founded by a Huguenot family, the de la Fonts, and passed {{into the hands of}} another Huguenot family, the Luzacs, in 1738. Sources vary on the exact date it was founded, {{suggesting}} 1660, 1667 1669 or 1680; they all agree the publication continued to 1798 (or 1811 under <b>a</b> <b>different</b> <b>name).</b>|$|E
5|$|In 1875, Goldfaden {{headed for}} Munich, {{intending}} to study medicine. This {{did not work}} out, and he headed for Lvov/Lemberg in Galicia, where he again met up with Linetsky, now editor of a weekly paper, Isrulik or Der Alter Yisrulik (which was well reputed, but was soon shut by the government). A year later, {{he moved on to}} Chernivtsi in Bukovina, where he edited the Yiddish-language daily Dos Bukoviner Israelitishe Folksblatt. The limits of the economic sense of this enterprise can be gauged from his inability to pay a registration fee of 3000 ducats. He tried unsuccessfully to operate the paper under <b>a</b> <b>different</b> <b>name,</b> but soon moved on to Iaşi on the invitation of Isaac Librescu (1850–1930), a young wealthy communitary activist interested in theatre.|$|E
5|$|In 1997, Antestor {{recorded}} a promotional CD titled Kongsblod. The promo-CD caught {{the interest of}} British Cacophonous Records, {{one of the biggest}} labels with experience in the black metal style and helped established groups such as Cradle of Filth and Dimmu Borgir start their career. Cacophonous signed a record deal for 2 albums with Antestor. In 1998, Cacophonous released Kongsblod under <b>a</b> <b>different</b> <b>name,</b> The Return of the Black Death, and changed the original cover art of a famous Norwegian painting to artwork by Joe Petagno, a well-known American heavy metal cover art creator.|$|E
50|$|QuarkXPress 2015 was {{the first}} version to use <b>a</b> <b>different</b> <b>naming</b> scheme. It was {{completely}} 64-bit and added fixed-layout ePub and Kindle export as well as exporting layouts as PDF/X-4. Quark claimed to have added the top 10 of all user-requested features.|$|R
50|$|Since the 1953 Iranian coup, the Usuli ulama {{have made}} countless transgressions from Wilayat al-Faqih to Ittihad Bayn al-Muslimeen (at {{the cost of}} Shia beliefs). The {{convergence}} of these trends can be seen heading towards the caliphate of mujtahideen, although with <b>a</b> <b>different</b> <b>naming</b> scheme.|$|R

5|$|Rat urine also {{contains}} homologous urinary proteins; {{although they were}} originally given <b>a</b> <b>different</b> <b>name,</b> α2u-globulins, they have since become known as rat Mups. Rats have 9 distinct Mup genes and a further 13 pseudogenes clustered together across 1.1 megabases of DNA on chromosome 5. Like in mice, the cluster formed by multiple duplications. However, this occurred independently of the duplications in mice, meaning that both rodent species expanded their Mup gene families separately, but in parallel.|$|E
5|$|Sam Black (Gabrielle Anwar) {{replaced}} Julie as {{the head}} of the graphics team in the second series. Sam is very fashion conscious and a flirt, and is surprised when an actor rejects her advances in favour of Sarah. Anwar had auditioned for the role of Lynda. (Many actors who unsuccessfully auditioned for main characters were invited back later for guest roles.) Moffat had expanded the role of Julie after the first series, but Lucy Benjamin was unavailable for series two. Sam, therefore, was basically the character of Julie under <b>a</b> <b>different</b> <b>name,</b> especially in her earlier episodes.|$|E
5|$|The head is {{enclosed}} in a hard, heavily sclerotized, unsegmented, exoskeletal head capsule, or epicranium, which contains {{most of the}} sensing organs, including the antennae, ocellus or eyes, and the mouthparts. Of all the insect orders, Orthoptera displays the most features found in other insects, including the sutures and sclerites. Here, the vertex, or the apex (dorsal region), is situated between the compound eyes for insects with a hypognathous and opisthognathous head. In prognathous insects, the vertex is not found between the compound eyes, but rather, where the ocelli are normally. This is because the primary axis of the head is rotated 90° to become parallel to the primary axis of the body. In some species, this region is modified and assumes <b>a</b> <b>different</b> <b>name.</b>|$|E

5|$|The {{history of}} the National Forest System is very complicated. Forests have been {{transferred}} between agencies, renamed, divided, consolidated, discontinued, established from parts of existing forests, had portions ceded to other forests, expanded from other lands, among various other actions. The date given represents the day: that forest was established as is, a predecessor forest with the same boundaries was established under <b>a</b> <b>different</b> <b>name,</b> or the earliest date of establishment of a forest that was combined in whole with another forest.|$|E
5|$|The {{life cycle}} of Urnula craterium allows for both an {{imperfect}} (making asexual spores, or conidia) or perfect (making sexual spores) form; as has often happened in fungal taxonomy, the imperfect form was given <b>a</b> <b>different</b> <b>name,</b> because {{the relationship between the}} perfect and imperfect forms of the same species was not then known. The imperfect stage of Urnula craterium is the plant pathogenic species Conoplea globosa, known to cause a canker disease (Strumella canker) of oak and several other hardwoods.|$|E
5|$|Uppland {{was granted}} arms created for Gustav Vasa's funeral in 1560, and the royal orb symbolises spiritual and worldly power. Historically, Uppland ranked as a duchy and the {{coat of arms}} was {{represented}} with a ducal coronet. Despite the fact that Uppsala län has <b>a</b> <b>different</b> <b>name</b> and a smaller territory, it was granted the same coat of arms in 1940, but with a royal crown {{in place of the}} ducal crown of the landskap arms. Blazon: Gules, a royal orb Or.|$|E

5|$|Because he {{acts as a}} {{link between}} the other main {{characters}} of the series, Kakashi is rarely featured prominently in promotional artwork, instead appearing in the background while his students are the focus of the scene. In an interview in Shōnen Jump's, Kishimoto said that if he were to make an extra story from the manga with a different character, such character would be Kakashi. In early 2014, Kishimoto commented he wanted to reveal Kakashi's face but was not sure whether {{it would be in the}} manga or an upcoming movie. The Raikiri, one of Kakashi's most common techniques, had <b>a</b> <b>different</b> <b>name,</b> but the author forgot about its original name. Nevertheless, he found the name Raikiri fitting for this lightning-based technique. Kakashi's Sharingan was introduced to give the character mystery as only members from the Uchiha clan could possess it. By chapter 16 of the manga, Kishimoto had already decided how Kakashi obtained the Sharingan. He also added that Kakashi's face was difficult to draw since it is covered by a mask.|$|E
5|$|HMS Vindex was a Royal Navy {{seaplane}} carrier {{during the}} First World War. The ship spent {{the bulk of}} her career operating the North Sea, where she twice unsuccessfully attacked the German Zeppelin base at Tondern and conducted anti-Zeppelin patrols. One of her Bristol Scout aircraft made the first take-off from an aircraft carrier in late 1915. Another made the first interception of an airship by a carrier-based aircraft on 2 August 1916, when it unsuccessfully attacked the Zeppelin LZ17. Vindex {{was transferred to the}} Mediterranean in 1918 and was sold back to her original owners in 1920. She was requisitioned again in 1939 and served through the Second World War as a troopship under <b>a</b> <b>different</b> <b>name.</b> After the end of the war, the ship was returned to her owners and was sold for scrapping in 1954.|$|E
5|$|The 1985–86 {{season was}} one of Al-Talaba and Saeed's best season in their history where Al-Talaba {{achieved}} their third league title after beating their rivals at the time, Al-Rasheed, in front of 50,000 spectators, with Saeed's only goal from a penalty, finishing in 1st with 25 points from 15 matches. Saeed finished the season as the top goalscorer of the league along with Al-Zawra'a's Ahmed Radhi and Al-Jaish's Rahim Hameed where, for the first time, {{every one of them}} scored 9 goals in the league. As of that season, Saeed was also made the club's vice president. In the 1986 Saddam International Tournament, Saeed played for Baghdad XI, rather than Al-Talaba, because Baghdad XI was essentially the Iraq national team under <b>a</b> <b>different</b> <b>name.</b> Baghdad XI won all of their group matches including a victory over Saeed's club Al-Talaba to qualify for the semi-finals where they thrashed Al-Zawra'a to reach the final. However, Baghdad XI lost the final 2–1 to Al-Rasheed; Saeed scored Baghdad XI's only goal in the final in the 78th minute with a penalty. Saeed returned to Al-Talaba for the 1986 Al-Muthabara Cup between Al-Talaba and Al-Rasheed; Al-Rasheed won the match 2–1. In the 1986–87 season, Al-Talaba finished mid-table in 6th place at 49 points. The {{second half of the season}} witnessed the retirement of the team captain, Jamal Ali, in 1987, when Saeed was named the new captain of the team, although he only participated in the first stage of the league due to an association punishment against him. The 1987–88 season was the only season where Saeed hasn't scored any goals due to him not participating in many matches because of national duty. They finished, for the first time since 1977–78, in 8th place at 30 points. Saeed wasted Al-Talaba's hope in achieving the league title in 1988–89 when he missed his penalty in the final of the league against their rivals, Al-Rasheed, after a 1–1 draw. The score was 4–3 to Al-Talaba but with Saeed's miss they got the equalizer and with his teammate missing the fifth penalty, Al-Rasheed won 5–4. Saeed returned to the top three goalscorers of the league table in 3rd with 12 goals along with Al-Zawra'a's Saad Abdul-Raheem.|$|E
5000|$|The US Army used <b>a</b> <b>different</b> <b>naming</b> {{system from}} the Navy. Instead of using the usual Army system of Model or M-numbers, they {{referred}} to the LVTs by Mark number using Roman numerals rather than Arabic numerals. Hence the LVT-4 was the [...] "Mark IV" [...] (which {{was not the same}} as the [...] "M4").|$|R

25|$|Ethiopians have <b>a</b> <b>different</b> <b>naming</b> {{system to}} the family name-based Western system. Children add the given names of their father and {{paternal}} grandfather consecutively to their own given name. For compatibility purposes, as is done in passports, the grandfather's given name is taken as a family surname, and a person's given name and his/her father's given name form the first name.|$|R
5000|$|Some {{languages}} may use <b>a</b> <b>different</b> <b>naming</b> convention {{for this}} type of loop.
