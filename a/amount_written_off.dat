40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{addresses the}} goodwill impairment test under IFRS, which prescribes that goodwill is not amortized and instead tested for impairment {{at least once}} a year. The objective of introducing this impairment-only approach in 2004 was to provide more useful information to financial statement users. The dissertation is thereforemotivated by the ongoing debate on the decision usefulness and reliability of goodwill impairment tests, as the IASB’s recent post-implementation review on business combinations shows, and the high practical relevance of this topic for firms, auditors, enforcement institutions, and regulators. Against this background, the dissertation (1) sets forth and critically discusses the accounting requirements for goodwill, (2) develops an audit approach for goodwill impairment tests, (3) empirically assesses whether goodwill impairment tests are used as a device for earnings management, and (4) performs two empirical studies to analyze how goodwill impairments are perceived by capital market participants. Based on the requirements of international and German auditing standards and the author’s practical audit experience, a risk-based audit approach is developed that outlines the different audit steps necessary to verify the reasonableness of goodwill impairment tests including practical application guidance for auditors. Using a sample of German listed firms for the periods 2006 to 2013, the main findings of the three empirical studies are that (1) the likelihood to recognize goodwill impairments and the magnitude of impairment losses are influenced by earnings management incentives, (2) investors perceive goodwill impairments as value relevant, but not timely recognized, and (3) the announcement of goodwill impairments leads to a negative capital market reaction, but the reaction is considerably smaller than the goodwill <b>amount</b> <b>written</b> <b>off.</b> Moreover, the perceived timeliness of goodwill impairments is shown to be influenced by auditor characteristics, which serve as a proxy for perceived audit quality. Overall, the empirical results therefore indicate that the concept of impairment testing might generally have merits in reflecting the economic value and consumption of goodwill, but that current accounting requirements might not be sufficient to ensure a rigorous impairment test providing adequate decision useful information. Hence, improvements of the current approach or the implementation of a different approach, e. g. based on certain amortization requirements with indication-based impairment testing, should be discussed...|$|E

40|$|Correspondence {{issued by}} the Government Accountability Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "The Indian Health Service (IHS), an agency in the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), provides health care services to American Indians and Alaskan Natives. For fiscal year 2009, Congress appropriated approximately $ 3. 6 billion for health care services to be made available through IHS. The agency provides direct medical care, including primary care services, ancillary services, and some specialty services, through its network of facilities, including hospitals, health centers, and clinics. IHS also provides funding to direct care facilities that are operated by tribes. IHS headquarters oversees 12 area offices that cover 161 service units in 35 states. The Indian Health Care Improvement Act of 1976, as amended, authorizes IHS to collect reimbursement for services provided at IHS facilities from third-party insurers, including Medicare, the federal health insurance program for elderly and disabled individuals; Medicaid, a joint federal and state health financing program for certain low-income families and individuals; and private health insurers. IHS is allowed to retain funds collected from these insurers without a corresponding offset against its appropriations, so that all revenue collected by a facility remains with that facility, supplementing its appropriations. For fiscal year 2008, IHS reported that it collected about $ 795 million from all third-party insurers, of which about $ 94 million, or 12 percent, was collected from private insurers. The remaining 88 percent was collected from the Medicare and Medicaid programs. According to IHS, these funds were used to purchase new medical equipment and medical supplies, and to provide compensation and benefits for IHS employees. Given {{the importance of these}} collections to IHS's mission, Congress asked us to examine several areas related to IHS's billings and collections activities. Specifically, Congress asked us to review IHS's policies and procedures for <b>writing</b> <b>off</b> <b>amounts</b> owed to the agency by private insurers, internal control procedures related to billing and collection, and the amounts and reasons for denied claims and claims <b>written</b> <b>off</b> as uncollectible by IHS. Because IHS was unable to provide much of the information we requested on the amounts of denied and adjusted claims and <b>amounts</b> <b>written</b> <b>off</b> for more than 6 months after our requests for these data, this report examines (1) the design of IHS's policies and procedures for billing and collecting revenue from private insurers including write-offs of uncollectible claims, and (2) the adequacy of IHS headquarters' monitoring of area office and service unit compliance with policies and procedures for the billing and collection of revenue from private insurers. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{main purpose}} of this paper is to develop and test a {{procedure}} for measuring the impact of credit regulation on consumer credit availability. The two types of regulations considered, rate ceilings and restrictions on creditor remedies, can lead to restrictions in credit availability. The incidence of these restrictions is not random in the population, but is dependent on the characteristics of consumers. The extent of the restriction depends on the severity of the regulations and the degree of successful evasion. The first sections of the paper are devoted to the construction of a simple model of supply and demand that illustrates how credit is rationed to consumers in a market restricted by regulations. Based on this lnodel, predictions are made which can be tested using consumer surveys conducted in four market areas which differ widely with respect to the regulations of interest. The empirical tests are presented in the final section of the paper. The Supply of Credit In order to simplify the analysis, assume that consumer credit is a homogeneous product characterized by a fixed sum of money for a fixed maturity (say, $ 1, 000 for one year). The cost of producing this product can be characterized as a fixed cost, which includes the cost of capital to the firm, overhead costs, paperwork costs and the like, and a variable cost, which is the expected loss on a loan made to a given risk. In this context, the product is viewed as "leased " or rented to the customer. The expected loss on the loan is the expense incurred collecting delinquent <b>amounts</b> and <b>writing</b> <b>off</b> any bad debts. Thus, the firm will "lease " funds according to a risk-price schedule as illustrated in Figure 1 an...|$|R
