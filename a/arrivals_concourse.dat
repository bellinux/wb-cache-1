25|$|The North Terminal was {{previously}} {{the site of}} Concourses A, B, C, and D, each a separate pier. Concourse D {{was one of the}} airport's original 1959 concourses, having opened as Concourse 5. After modifications similar to that of former Concourse C during the mid-1960s, it was extended in 1984, and the original portion was completely rebuilt from 1986 to 1989 and connected to the immigration and customs hall in Concourse E, allowing it to handle international <b>arrivals.</b> <b>Concourse</b> D FIS currently provides immigration and customs services instead of the now-closed Concourse E FIS. Along with former Concourses B and C, the concourse once housed the Eastern Air Lines base of operations. Another Texas Air Corporation affiliate joined the eastern side during the 1980s; Continental Airlines used gates {{on the west side of}} the concourse during the 1980s.|$|E

50|$|Terminal 5 {{opened in}} 2008 for JetBlue Airways, the manager and primary (then only) tenant of the {{building}} and serves as the base of their large JFK hub. This particular terminal handles (except for Aer Lingus flights to Ireland and TAP Portugal flights to Lisbon) exclusively North American regional flights—American domestic flights, Caribbean flights and Hawaiian Airlines flights to Honolulu, Hawaii. The terminal was re-designed by Gensler and constructed by Turner Construction, and it is known for its many gift shops and gourmet restaurants, including a steak house and a sushi restaurant. It sits behind the preserved Eero Saarinen-designed terminal originally known as the TWA Flight Center, which is now connected to the new structure and is considered part of T5. Currently closed for refurbishment, the Saarinen building is planned to reopen in 2018 as a hotel. Saarinen also designed the terminal at Washington Dulles International Airport. The active T5 building (including the international arrivals section named T5i) has 29 gates (26 until November 2014): 1-12 and 14-30 (with gates 25-30 handling international flights that are not precleared; gates 28-30 opened in November 2014). The terminal is also used by Hawaiian Airlines, which partnered with JetBlue and began service in Terminal 5 in June 2012, and Irish flag carrier Aer Lingus, whose flights arriving into JFK have already been pre-cleared in Ireland. Aer Lingus previously used Terminal 4 prior to the introduction of preclearance in Ireland, moving to T5 on April 3, 2013. On November 12, 2014, JetBlue opened the International <b>Arrivals</b> <b>Concourse</b> (T5i) at the terminal. TAP Portugal has used Terminal 5 since reinstating its JFK-Lisbon service on July 1, 2016. Airspace Lounge opened an airport lounge near Gate 24 in July 2013 and Aer Lingus opened an airport lounge in 2015. In August 2016, AIRMALL USA was selected by JetBlue as the concessions developer to help attract and manage concessions tenants that align with JetBlue’s vision for T5.|$|E

During the 1980s, the {{existing}} concourse was rebuilt and expanded, and a new immigration and customs hall {{was built in}} the Concourse B section of the terminal, allowing the concourse to process international <b>arrivals.</b> Along with <b>Concourse</b> C and most of Concourse D, it served as Eastern Air Lines' historical base of operations.|$|R
25|$|Concourse C opened as Concourse 6 in 1959, serving Eastern Air Lines. During the mid-1960s, Concourse C {{received}} {{an extension of}} its second floor and was equipped with air conditioning. Since then, it did not receive any major interior modifications or renovations. Following the renumbering of gates and concourses in the 1970s, Concourse C had Gates C1 to C10. The opening of an international <b>arrivals</b> hall in <b>Concourse</b> B during the 1980s saw Gate C1 receive the ability to process international arrivals.|$|R
