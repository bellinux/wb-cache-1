40|$|A new {{approach}} to estimate shaft capacity of bored piles in sandy soils, based on numerical analysis, is presented. The topic is relevant as current design methods often largely underestimate the shaft capacity of piles in sands, thus resulting in an over-conservative design. The proposed approach is based on explicitly modelling the thin cylinder of soil surrounding the pile, where strain localization concentrates (shear band), and on the fundamental mechanic behaviour of sandy soils (e. g. dilatancy, softening). This approach is both simple and easy to apply. Results of a broad parametric study involving axially loaded single piles embedded in different sandy soils are presented, highlighting that relative density and grain size distribution mainly affect the shaft capacity. The capability of the procedure to predict shaft friction is checked against data from a well-documented full-scale <b>axial</b> <b>load</b> <b>test</b> on instrumented pile.

40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{research}} is to find an improved method of predicting the failure behavior of Glass Reinforced Epoxy (GRE) pipe-work at long times under complex stress states which include a combination of internal pressure and axial load. The procedure currently used to qualify GRE tubing (as in ISO 19464 and ASTM 2992) is expensive and time-consuming, as it involves constant pressure stress-rupture tests, carried out over a period of more than 15 months. If the design of pipe is changed the procedure needs to be repeated. Another problem is that the current method only quantifies the behavior accurately when the pipe is under pure hydrostatic stress. The technique used to allow for the effect of axial loads can be quite inaccurate. The present work will attempt to develop a more effective method of predicting long term failure behavior under combinations of internal pressure and axial load. New models will be developed to quantify the growth of pipe wall damage that occurs under these conditions. An important question to be answered is whether or not there are stress levels below which no damage takes place and whether these stress levels would form a suitable basis for design. To date a novel type of pipe test specimen has been developed, which will enable the pipe to be easily subjected to combinations of internal pressure and <b>axial</b> <b>load.</b> <b>Test</b> spools have been manufactured and supplied by Future Pipe Industries and testing should begin shortly.

Experimental investigation to study the behaviour of the panel under axial load is undertaken. The panel consists of two lightweight foamed concrete wythes and a polystyrene insulation layer in between the wythes. The concrete panels are reinforced with 9 mm diameter high tensile steel bars. The rebars are tied to {{each other through the}} insulation layer by shear connectors which are made of 6 mm mild steel bars bent to 45 º angle. Total number of four specimens was tested with one specimen; PA 1 was cast without capping at both ends. It was used as a pilot test. The other three specimens are capped with normal concrete at both ends to avoid end crushing during axial loading. <b>Axial</b> <b>load</b> <b>test</b> was conducted and the results are presented here, which include the ultimate load capacity, crack pattern and failure mode, strain distribution and load-deflection curve of the panels. The experimental ultimate strength achieved recorded lesser percentage difference with the formulae by Pillai and Parthasarathy when compared to formulae in BS 8110. It is also observed that the strength of the panels are affected by the compressive strength of the foamed concrete forming the wythes, the presence of concrete capping at panel’s ends and the slenderness ratio, H/t. Specimens with capping at both ends recorded higher ultimate loads with no premature crushing. Failure of panels with slenderness ratio, H/t < 18 were by premature buckling near the supports whereas for panels with higher H/t ratio, slight bending was observed in the middle zone.

40|$|Recent {{research}} and development in prosthetics have aimed at improving socket designs and components to mimic more efficiently the human body. One such innovation is the Aperture Socket, a low-cost volume adjustable prosthetic socket. During the validation stage of its development, the Aperture Socket successfully demonstrated that it could compensate for volume changes, but various improvements on use and comfort were identified. This project develops and tests a redesign of the Aperture Socket previously developed for amputees in developing countries and subsequently patented and licensed to LIMBS International, Inc. ^ The first phase {{of this study was}} the creation of various prototypes to improve the existing mechanism for adjusting the prosthetic socket. The adjustment system was redesigned to improve ease of use and provide a more stable coupling between the socket and the remaining prosthetic components. The second phase consisted of creating a new socket wall design that implements struts with a flexible inner socket. The new socket system was designed to provide greater support to the residual limb, to improve user comfort, to simplify the manufacturing process, and to lengthen the lifecycle of the product. The third phase was experimentally testing the prototype with mechanical compression machines, following guidelines dictated by the ISO 10328 : 2006, and user feedback. One experienced transtibial amputee rated at the K 3 activity level was selected to validate comfort, volume adjustability, and ease of adjustment of the redesigned Aperture Socket while performing the L-Test of functional mobility [7]. ^ The results of the ISO 10328 ultimate strength test showed that the socket design struts are not capable of supporting the ultimate load applied during the late stages of the gait cycle (P 5 level, condition II). However, the <b>axial</b> <b>load</b> <b>test</b> of the ultimate strength force was successfully passed, which shows that the socket system is capable of withstanding the ultimate strength force of 4025 N.

40|$|Micropiles {{are used}} in various applications, {{including}} low capacity micropile networks, underpinning and seismic retrofitting of existing foundations and high capacity foundations for new structures. They facilitate fast installation {{with a high degree}} of ground improvement. The current Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) design guidelines designate hollow bar micropiles as Type B micropiles, even though their construction technique is different than typical Type B, which results in overly conservative design. In addition, the current practice for construction of hollow bar micropiles is limited to drilling bit/hollow bar diameter ratio of 2. 5 or less. In this thesis, full-scale load tests were conducted in order to: evaluate the suitability of FHWA design guidelines to hollow bar micropiles installed in cohesive soil; and to evaluate the performance of hollow bar micropiles constructed with drilling bit/hollow bar diameter ratio of 3. The load tests included axial monotonic and cyclic axial loading and monotonic lateral loading. Eight micropiles were constructed using 76 mm (3 in) hollow bars (76 mm OD and 48 mm ID) with air/water flushing technique and advanced to a depth of 5. 75 m: six micropiles were installed using 228 mm (9 in) drill bit and two micropiles were installed using 178 mm (7 in) drill bit. All micropiles were instrumented with vibrating wire strain gauges to measure the axial strain at three stations along the micropile shaft. The <b>axial</b> <b>load</b> <b>test</b> results are presented and discussed in terms of load-displacement curves and load transfer mechanism. The load tests results showed that the grout/ground bond strength values proposed by FHWA (2005) for Type B micropiles grossly underestimate the bond strength for calculating the ultimate capacity. In addition, the toe resistance can be significant for micropiles resting on sand due to the increased toe diameter. No stiffness degradation was observed in the micropile capacity after applying 15 load cycles. Finally, lateral capacity of micropiles is moderate due to their small diameter. However, the larger drilling bit resulted in enhanced lateral performance and increased capacity due to the larger diameter. In addition, using fibre reinforced grout can increase the micropile lateral capacity and enhance its ductility...|$|E
40|$|CLINICAL PRESENTATION 2 ̆ 6 EXAM: In TFCC cases, {{the patient}} usually reports {{injury to the}} {{triangular}} fibrocartilage and pain on the ulnar side of the wrist. This pain is associated to a specific occurrence of falling on an outstretched hand, from a forearm hyper rotation or an axial load and distraction injury to the ulnar boarder of the forearm. This type of falling and acute injury is common in many sports. Pain is especially pronounced when loading the wrist in extension or when supinating/pronating the wrist. In contrast, loading the wrist in a neutral position does not tend to cause pain. Deep aching pain with gripping, weakness and mechanical symptoms of clicking with pronation –supination can be experienced. The pain is typically described as being sharp and in one spot, frequently accompanied by clicking noises and visually unstable wrist. Though the wrist may show swelling early on, this can quickly subside. Repetitive pronation and supination lead to progressive degenerative changes of the proximal and distal aspects of the horizontal portion of the TFCC. ANATOMY 2 ̆ 6 PATHOPHYSIOLOGY: TFCC is a constellation of many structures that support the triangular fibrocartilage proper, located between the distal ulna and ulnar carpus, arising from the distal aspect of the sigmoid notch of the radius, inserting {{in the base of}} the ulnar styloid process and ulnar carpus via the ulnolunate, ulnotriquetral, and ulnar collateral ligaments. The triangular fibrocartilage is the main ligament that stabilizes the distal radio-ulnar (RU) joint. The distal RU joint is the part of the wrist joint that lies between the two bones of the forearm and allows forearm rotation. The TFCC also functions as a shock-absorber for the wrist, like a meniscus in the knee. When the TFCC is torn, the distal RU joint becomes unstable, which causes the patient pain. TFCC is classified either as Class 1 - Traumatic or Class 2 – Degenerative. DIAGNOSTIC TESTING 2 ̆ 6 CONSIDEERATIONS: Imaging is not very successful at diagnosing TFCC cases. X ray’s are negative because there is often no bone damage present during TFCC injuries, and MRI’s frequently show a false negative. A thorough physical examination is needed to diagnose TFCC. Immediate examination of the wrist would not present any obvious abnormalities because swelling often recedes quickly. During palpation, the patient would frequently report tenderness along the ulnar side of the wrist, as well as lack range of motion in both supination and pronation, as well as ulnar and radial deviation, An <b>axial</b> <b>load</b> <b>test</b> would need to be performed, which would cause pain on the ulnar side of the wrist if a TFCC tear is present. The patient would also be subjected to a Sharpey’s test, which, if a TFCC tear is present, would result in a distinct clicking noise and the ulna translating inferiorly. TREATMENT 2 ̆ 6 RETURN TO ACTIVITY: Conservative treatment would consist of rest, immobilization in a wrist splint, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medication, corticosteroid injections and change in work environment and sport activity. If this fails to resolve pain, physical therapy can then be prescribed. If these conservative treatment options continue to prove unsuccessful, then surgery can be considered. This would usually consist of arthroscopic debridement, total or partial excision, ulnar recession, partial or complete resection of the distal ulna and arthrodesis of the distal radio-ulnar joint followed by an open repair surgery for the TFCC in order to stabilize the distal radio-ulnar joint...|$|E

The complete mechanism of shear degradation followed by the reinforcement phase is interpreted based on the competition between two mechanisms which are the mean normal effective stress decrease due to cyclic contractancy phenomenon, responsible for cyclic softening, and the progressive densification of the sand within the interface zone around the probe, which becomes predominant after a certain number of cycles, resulting in a cyclic hardening mechanism due to partially constrained dilatancy phenomenon. © 2012 Académie des sciences...|$|R

In practice, the loads applied on piles are often a combination of both vertical and lateral loads.

40|$|Hong Kong is now {{recognized}} as an area of moderate seismic hazard. It is necessary to assess the confinement action provided by existing transverse reinforcement detailing in local reinforced concrete columns. In this study, two types of non-seismic detailing have been considered. Type L detailing incorporates 900 hooks, whereas type M detailing allows both 900 hooks and crossties not effectively anchored to the main reinforcements. Sectional analyses using OpenSees have been conducted to predict the stress-strain relationships of confined concrete with {{these two types of}} non-seismic detailing. The results are compared with those obtained from the experiments carried out in previous <b>axial</b> <b>loading</b> <b>tests.</b> The minimum volumetric transverse reinforcement ratios ρs for type L and type M detailing are suggested to be 0. 5 % and 1. 1 % respectively. Stress-strain relationships of confined concrete for non-seismic detailing are proposed by modifying the Mander’s model with a reduction factor β. Appropriate values for type L and type M detailing are β= 71. 6 % (when ρs> 0. 5 %) an...|$|R
40|$|This report {{discusses}} the fundamental action of shear deformation of the flanges {{on the basis}} of simplifying assumptions. The theory is developed to the point of giving analytical solutions for simple cases of beams and of skin-stringer panels under <b>axial</b> <b>load.</b> Strain-gage <b>tests</b> on a tension panel and on a beam corresponding to these simple cases are described and the results are compared with analytical results. For wing beams, an approximate method of applying the theory is given. As an alternative, the construction of a mechanical analyzer is advocated...|$|R

40|$|In {{order to}} {{delineate}} effects of surface roughness {{on the unit}} shaft resistance of piles embedded in a dry natural fine sand mass, a research program comprising 25 <b>axial</b> <b>loading</b> <b>tests</b> was carried out on 44 mm diameter model piles with different surface roughness. In order to provide piles with different surface roughness they were wrapped with sandpapers with different grits. The results indicate that when the average abrasive particles size of sandpapers varies from 18. 3 to 425 microns, the lateral earth pressure coefficient increases from 0. 95 to 1. 75. This implies that pile surface roughness enhances the tendency of the sand to dilate during loading, which increases magnitude of the radial effective stress against the pile surface. Also, it was disclosed that when the average abrasive particles size of sandpapers varies from 18. 3 to 425 microns, the unit shaft resistance increases from 2. 5 to 9. 1 kPa. These {{results indicate that the}} pile shaft resistance increases due partially {{to the fact that the}} sand mass-sand paper interface friction angle increases as the sand paper roughness increases. However, it also depends on the rise of radial effective stress due to dilation of sand during loading...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of experimental and analytical investigations on the structural performance of high performance reinforced concrete (HPC) columns subjected to monotonic <b>axial</b> <b>loading.</b> Reinforced columns made of self-consolidating concrete (SCC), engineered cementitious composite (ECC) and ultra-high performance concrete (UHPC) were tested to failure under <b>axial</b> <b>loading.</b> The <b>test</b> variables included concrete strength and length/slenderness of columns (classified as short and long columns). The UHPC and ECC columns demonstrated excellent ductility and higher energy absorbing capacity compared to their SCC counterparts. UHPC columns also illustrated higher ultimate load capacity compared to both ECC and SCC columns. The efficiency of UHPC and ECC columns was also judged based on strength and ductility ratio compared to their SCC counterparts. Existing models and other Code based equations were used to predict the <b>axial</b> <b>load</b> capacity as a part of analytical investigation. The predictions suggested the need for the modification of existing models/Code based equations for UHPC and ECC columns...|$|R
