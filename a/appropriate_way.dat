5|$|The {{critical}} {{reception for}} the episode was mostly positive. Many reviewers {{commented that the}} dark tone of the final episode was characteristic of the series, and that killing off the protagonist was an <b>appropriate</b> <b>way</b> to conclude.

5|$|In {{individuals}} with developmental disabilities, occurrence of self-harm is often demonstrated {{to be related}} to its effects on the environment, such as obtaining attention or desired materials or escaping demands. As developmentally disabled individuals often have communication or social deficits, self-harm may be their way of obtaining these things which they are otherwise unable to obtain in a socially <b>appropriate</b> <b>way</b> (such as by asking). One approach for treating self-harm thus is to teach an alternative, appropriate response which obtains the same result as the self-harm.|$|E
5|$|Matsueda {{is noted}} for her jazzy style, which she often {{incorporated}} into the soundtracks she worked on; she also touched on genres like jazz fusion, lounge, and ambient. For the scores that she collaborated on with Eguchi, she was {{responsible for most of}} the jazzy tracks, while Eguchi provided the majority of the electronic music. Matsueda has said that the best qualities of a composer are their curiosity and sensitivity, and that watching many things, listening, touching, and feeling are important factors in composition. When asked why she creates music, Matsueda replied that she feels it is an <b>appropriate</b> <b>way</b> to express herself.|$|E

5|$|Abi invites Dot to Christmas in Exeter but Dot insists she {{has plans}} of her own. The {{launderette}} closes on Christmas Eve, but everyone is {{too busy to}} visit her. She finds a Christmas mixtape recorded by her now-deceased friend Heather Trott (Cheryl Fergison), and takes in a stray cat, which she eventually names Dave. She spends Christmas Day alone, but when Patrick realises she has not gone to Exeter, he invites her to The Queen Victoria pub where everyone is celebrating Christmas, and her neighbours present her with the gift of a washing machine. When Ronnie, the wife of Dot's former stepson, Jack Branning (Scott Maslen), and her sister Roxy Mitchell (Rita Simons), mother of one of Jack's children, both die, Dot tells the children {{that they are in}} heaven, helping them to understand after Jack struggles to find an <b>appropriate</b> <b>way</b> to tell them. When Jack is unable to take Dot to the garden centre, she decides to drive herself with her great-grandson, Matthew Mitchell Cotton, but drives through a no entry sign into oncoming traffic and ends up in the verge. Dot is surprised when Charlie returns {{but it turns out that}} he's only back for his son. Dot's step granddaughter Abi Branning (Lorna Fitzgerald) lives with her for a while but moves out with Dot's blessing. Dot is surprised when Charlie returns but is left upset when Charlie leaves to go back to Ireland with Mathew, also upsetting Jack. Dot and Jack are unaware this is part of Max Branning's (Jake Wood) evil revenge for his false imprisonment.|$|E

25|$|Protestant and Roman Catholic {{propaganda}} {{during the}} Reformation attempted to sway the public into adopting or continuing religious practices.

25|$|Property dualism {{asserts that}} an ontological {{distinction}} {{lies in the}} differences between properties of mind and matter, and that consciousness is ontologically irreducible to neurobiology and physics.

Hence, it is a sub-branch of emergent materialism. What views properly fall under the property dualism rubric is itself a matter of dispute.

In addition to many of the professional bodies that previously issued the consensus statement, signatories included the UK Association of Christian Counsellors, the Royal College of General Practitioners, NHS England and NHS Scotland. The signatory organisations recognised a shared commitment to protecting the public from the risks of conversion therapy.

The Resolution gives {{for the first}} time, a special recognition to all humanitarian and United Nations and associated personnel who have worked in {{the promotion of the}} humanitarian cause and those who have lost their lives in the cause of duty and urges all Member States, entities of the United Nations within existing resources, {{as well as the other}} International Organizations and Non-Governmental Organizations to observe it annually in an <b>appropriate</b> <b>way.</b> It marks the day on which the then Special Representative of the Secretary-General to Iraq, Sergio Vieira de Mello and his 21 colleagues were killed following the bombing of the UN Headquarters in Baghdad.|$|E
25|$|Dr Michael Dixon was {{appointed}} the Foundation's medical director. From 2005 to 2007, FIH received {{a grant from}} the Department of Health to help organise the self-regulation of complementary therapies. There had been concern that with {{a large proportion of the}} public turning to complementary approaches, there were few safeguards in place to ensure that non-statutorily regulated therapists were safe, trained and would act in an <b>appropriate</b> <b>way.</b> FIH worked to bring together the representative bodies of many complementary professions to talk and agree standards. The result was the formation of the Complementary and Natural Healthcare Council (CNHC) which had hoped to register 10,000 practitioners of complementary medicine by the end of 2009 but which by September 2009 had succeeded in enrolling less than a tenth of that number due to lack of interest on the part of some of their professional associations. The Department of Health is currently continuing to fund the CNHC but future funding will be dependent on substantial progress being made towards the target (which has now been reduced to 2,000). Alternative medicine campaigners argued that the move toward regulation conferred undue respectability on unproven and possibly unsafe CAM approaches.|$|E
