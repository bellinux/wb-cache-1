5|$|American Type Founders {{created a}} revival of the Imprimerie Nationale fonts from around 1917, which was {{designed}} in-house by its design department led by Morris Fuller Benton under the influence of its historian and advisor Henry Lewis Bullen. It received <b>a</b> <b>sumptuous</b> showing, marketed especially towards advertisers, in ATF's 1923 specimen book. Also involved in the design's development was book and advertising designer T.M. Cleland, who created a set of matching borders and ornaments, and according to Warde and Garnett also designed the swash characters.|$|E
5|$|The new {{building}} {{was designed for}} attractiveness and modernity to contrast with the traditional gloomy decor associated with the funeral industry. A narrow four-storey building on Westminster Bridge Road held the LNC's offices. Behind it was the main terminal; this held a communal third-class waiting room, mortuaries and storerooms, the LNC's workshops, and <b>a</b> <b>sumptuous</b> oak-panelled Chapelle Ardente, intended for mourners unable to make the journey to Brookwood {{to pay their respects}} to the deceased. This building led onto the two platforms, lined with waiting rooms and a ticket office.|$|E
5|$|First class mourners {{entered through}} the {{driveway}} under {{the office building}} which turned sharply left to run beneath a glass canopy parallel to Westminster Bridge Road; this stretch was faced with glazed white brick and lined with palm and bay trees. The driveway ran past mortuaries and storerooms to the lifts and stairs to the platforms, and also to a secondary entrance on Newnham Terrace (off Hercules Road). Above the mortuaries and storerooms were the LNC's workshops. Lifts and an elaborate wrought-iron staircase led from the lower two floors to platform level on the second floor. This upper level housed <b>a</b> <b>sumptuous</b> oak-panelled Chapelle Ardente, intended for mourners unable to make the journey to Brookwood {{to pay their respects}} to the deceased. A short and wide pathway led to the first class platform, lined with waiting rooms and a ticket office; the first class platform was equipped with five separate waiting rooms to keep mourners from different funeral parties separate.|$|E

5|$|In 875, the unwarlike and pleasure-loving Aghlabid emir Muhammad II ibn Ahmad (r. 864–875) died, and was {{succeeded by}} his more {{energetic}} brother, Ibrahim II (r. 875–902). The new Emir of Ifriqiya {{was determined to}} finally capture Syracuse. He appointed a new governor for the island, Ja'far ibn Muhammad, and sent a fleet from Ifriqiya to his assistance. Ja'far began his campaign in 877, raiding the Byzantine territories and occupying some outlying forts around Syracuse, before settling down to besiege the city. The Muslims, well supplied with siege weapons, launched incessant attacks on the city's defenders, but Syracuse received scant reinforcements from Constantinople, where {{the bulk of the}} imperial fleet was apparently occupied with carrying building materials for <b>a</b> <b>sumptuous</b> new church built by Emperor Basil. During nine months of siege, the Arabs gradually occupied the outer defences, and finally, on 21 May 878, stormed the city. The population was massacred or enslaved, and the city thoroughly looted over two months.|$|E
5|$|In architecture, {{the huge}} profits of the spice trade financed <b>a</b> <b>sumptuous</b> {{composite}} {{style in the}} first decades of the 16th century, the Manueline, incorporating maritime elements. The primary painters were Nuno Gonçalves, Gregório Lopes and Vasco Fernandes. In music, Pedro de Escobar and Duarte Lobo produced four songbooks, including the Cancioneiro de Elvas. In literature, Sá de Miranda introduced Italian forms of verse. Bernardim Ribeiro developed pastoral romance, plays by Gil Vicente fused it with popular culture, reporting the changing times, and Luís de Camões inscribed the Portuguese feats overseas in the epic poem Os Lusíadas. Travel literature especially flourished: João de Barros, Castanheda, António Galvão, Gaspar Correia, Duarte Barbosa, and Fernão Mendes Pinto, among others, described new lands and were translated and spread with the new printing press. After joining the Portuguese exploration of Brazil in 1500, Amerigo Vespucci coined the term New World, in his letters to Lorenzo di Pierfrancesco de' Medici.|$|E
5|$|Shortly after, Gaudí {{received}} an important new commission from Güell: {{the construction of}} his family house, in the Carrer Nou de la Rambla in Barcelona. The Palau Güell (1886–1888) continues the tradition of large Catalan urban mansions {{such as those in}} Carrer Montcada. Gaudí designed a monumental entrance with a magnificent parabolic arch above iron gates, decorated with the Catalan coat of arms and a helmet with a winged dragon, the work of Joan Oñós. A notable feature is the triple-height entrance hall; it is the core of the building, surrounded by the main rooms of the palace, and it is remarkable for its double dome, parabolic within and conical on the outside, a solution typical of Byzantine art. For the gallery on the street facade Gaudí used an original system of catenary arches and columns with hyperbolic capitals, a style he used only here. He designed the interior of the palace with <b>a</b> <b>sumptuous</b> Mudejar-style decoration, where the wood and iron coffered ceilings stand out. The chimneys on the roof are a remarkable feature, faced in vividly coloured ceramic tiles, as is the tall spire {{in the form of a}} lantern tower, which is the external termination of the dome within, and is also faced with ceramic tiles and topped with an iron weather vane.|$|E
60|$|It was one o'clock, and the {{refreshment}} rooms {{had just}} opened. Fan was conducted into the glittering dining-saloon, and was persuaded {{to join her}} companion in <b>a</b> rather <b>sumptuous</b> luncheon, and to drink a glass of champagne.|$|R

50|$|During {{the early}} 1870s, H. G. Davis {{contracted}} {{to build a}} series of cottages on the hotel property, with the first one becoming John W. Garrett’s cottage. Later, this became the caretaker’s cottage, and Garrett had <b>a</b> more <b>sumptuous</b> summer home built to {{the west side of}} the hotel; he died there in the summer of 1884.|$|R

25|$|Another notable grave was the Oseberg Ship in Norway that {{revealed}} {{two women who}} had received <b>a</b> <b>sumptuous</b> burial. One of the women was most likely a high-ranking lady {{who knew how to}} practice seiðr as she had been buried with a wand of wood. In the grave, there were also four cannabis seeds, which probably had been in the pillows that supported the corpses. Additional cannabis seeds were discovered in a small leather pouch.|$|E
25|$|Portuguese Late Gothic {{architecture}} is characterised {{by the development}} of <b>a</b> <b>sumptuous</b> style called Manueline in honour of King Manuel I, under whose reign (1495–1521) most buildings of the style were built or begun. Manueline mixes aspects of Late Gothic with Renaissance architecture and decoration, revealing influences from Spanish (Plateresque, Isabelline), Italian and Flemish contemporary art, as well as elements borrowed from Islamic (Mudéjar) tradition. Manueline buildings are also often decorated with naturalistic motifs typical of the Age of Discovery, like spiralling motifs that remind of ropes used in ships, as well as a rich array of animal and vegetal motifs.|$|E
25|$|The Royal Convent of La Encarnación is an Augustinian Recollect convent. The institution, which {{belonged to}} {{ladies of the}} nobility, was founded by Queen Margaret of Austria, wife of Philip III of Spain, in the early 17th century. Due to the frescoes and sculptures it houses, {{it is one of}} the most {{prominent}} temples in the city. The building's architect was Fray Alberto de la Madre de Dios, who built it between 1611 and 1616. The façade responds to an inspiring Herrerian style, with great austerity, and it was imitated by other Spanish churches. The church's interior is <b>a</b> <b>sumptuous</b> work by the great Baroque architect Ventura Rodriguez.|$|E

60|$|Angela {{shook her}} head, and, looking but {{partially}} convinced, {{led the way}} down the passage, and into the room, where, to her astonishment, she perceived that the dinner-table was furnished with <b>a</b> more <b>sumptuous</b> meal than she had seen upon it for years, the fact being that Pigott had received orders from Philip which she did not know of, not to spare expense whilst Arthur was his guest.|$|R
25|$|In {{the western}} mound were found {{the remains of}} a man and animals, {{probably}} for food during the journey. The remains of a warrior's equipment were found. Luxurious weapons and other objects, both domestic and imported, show that the buried man was very powerful. These remains include a Frankish sword adorned with gold and garnets and a board game with Roman pawns of ivory. He was dressed in a costly suit made of Frankish cloth with golden threads, and he wore a belt with <b>a</b> <b>sumptuous</b> buckle. There were four cameos from the Middle East which were probably part of a casket. The finds show the distant contacts of the people of Uppland in the 6th century.|$|E
25|$|The book Coleridge {{was reading}} before {{he fell asleep}} was Purchas, his Pilgrimes, or Relations of the World and Religions Observed in All Ages and Places Discovered, from the Creation to the Present, by the English clergyman and {{geographer}} Samuel Purchas, published in 1613. The book contained {{a brief description of}} Xanadu, the summer capital of the Mongol ruler Kublai Khan. The text about Xanadu in Purchas, His Pilgrimes, which Coleridge admitted he did not remember exactly, was: In Xandu did Cublai Can build a stately Pallace, encompassing sixteen miles of plaine ground with a wall, wherein are fertile Meddowes, pleasant Springs, delightfull streames, and all sorts of beasts of chase and game, and in the middest thereof <b>a</b> <b>sumptuous</b> house of pleasure, which may be moved from place to place.|$|E
25|$|In late June 1658, Louis became gravely ill. Presumed to have typhoid, Louis {{was almost}} {{pronounced}} dead when, in mid-July, {{he began to}} recover. The illness made Philippe, heir presumptive to the throne, the centre of attention. For fear of infection, Philippe could not see his brother. During the crisis, Queen Anne became closer to her younger son, showing him more affection. After Louis's recovery, Philippe was once again left to his own devices. Later in 1658, Philippe made his most significant purchase, the Château de Saint-Cloud, a building about 10 kilometres west of Paris. On 8 October 1658, its proprietor Barthélemy Hervart organised <b>a</b> <b>sumptuous</b> feast at Saint Cloud in honour of the royal family. Some two weeks later, on 25 October, Philippe bought the estate for 240,000 livres. He immediately began to organise improvements to {{what was then a}} small villa.|$|E

25|$|Leopold Anthony Stokowski (18 April 188213 September 1977) was an English {{conductor}} of Polish and Irish descent. One {{of the leading}} conductors of the early and mid-20th Century, he {{is best known for}} his long association with the Philadelphia Orchestra and for appearing in the film Fantasia.

50|$|The castle was {{established}} from a primitive medieval edifice which, at this location, closed {{the valley of}} the Célé.

Today, there remains only a few stretches of wall and some architectural features. The castle was effectively razed in the 19th century to allow the construction of a spa-type house which has now disappeared.|$|R
