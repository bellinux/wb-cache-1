5|$|Batman: The Ultimate Evil {{is a novel}} {{written by}} Andrew Vachss and {{published}} in 1995 by the Warner Aspect imprint of Warner Books. Vachss was an attorney specializing in child <b>abuse</b> <b>cases,</b> {{as well as a}} crime novelist best known for his series of books featuring the character Burke, a private investigator who also takes on child <b>abuse</b> <b>cases.</b> A representative from DC Comics approached Vachss about the possibility of writing a novel featuring Batman. Viewing {{this as an opportunity to}} reach a completely different audience, Vachss agreed and wrote a draft. He continued with his themes concerning child sexual abuse and explored the topic of child sex tourism. The publisher required Vachss to follow certain rules, like making a clear distinction between fiction and reality and prohibiting the Batman character from killing, cursing, or having sex.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Abuse</b> <b>case</b> [...] is a {{specification}} {{model for}} security requirements {{used in the}} software development industry. The term <b>Abuse</b> <b>Case</b> is an adaptation of use case. The term was introduced by John McDermott and Chris Fox in 1999, while working at Computer Science Department of the James Madison University. As defined by its authors, an <b>abuse</b> <b>case</b> {{is a type of}} complete interaction between a system and one or more actors, where the results of the interaction are harmful to the system, one of the actors, or one of the stakeholders in the system. We cannot define completeness just in terms of coherent transactions between actors and the system. Instead, we must define abuse in terms of interactions that result in actual harm. A complete <b>abuse</b> <b>case</b> defines an interaction between an actor and the system that results in harm to a resource associated with one of the actors, one of the stakeholders, or the system itself.|$|R
5|$|Mayor Daley and all law {{enforcement}} officials who had been deposed {{were excluded from the}} report. Also, the 75 credible <b>abuse</b> <b>cases</b> were overlooked; the report focused on doubts about the torture of the four pardoned death row inmates. Among the final costs were $6.2 million for the investigation and $7 million to hire outside counsel for Burge and his cohort. Many activists were disappointed to learn that the statute of limitations meant that Burge would not be prosecuted for torture. Debates in the op-ed pages continued for days. Egan explained his report to the public with legal theories and federal jurisdiction issues.|$|E
5|$|The 400-page report made 108 {{recommendations}} in child protection reform. Regional and local committees {{for children and}} families are to be set up, with members from all groups involved in child protection. Previously each local authority managed their own child protection register, a list of children believed to be at risk, and no national register existed; this, combined with local authorities' tendency to suppress information about child <b>abuse</b> <b>cases,</b> led to the implementation of the child database. Two organisations to improve the care of children, the General Social Care Council and the Social Care Institute for Excellence, had already been set up by the time the report was published.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} of publication, Vachss worked as an attorney, in New York City, specializing in child abuse cases; {{he also had a}} career as a novelist. The duality of Vachss' work as a lawyer prosecuting and {{defending}} real cases and as a crime fiction author writing about fictional criminals resulted in Vachss being compared to the Bruce Wayne/Batman character. Vachss' eighth novel, Footsteps of the Hawk, in the Burke series featuring a vigilante private investigator of child <b>abuse</b> <b>cases,</b> was released just two months before the publication of Batman: The Ultimate Evil. He had wanted to approach the topic of sex tourism in southeast Asia, but had been unable to find a way for the Burke character to go there; the Batman character offered the chance for him to write about the topic.|$|E

The Government of Karnataka announced the launch of a 24/7 dedicated helpline (1091) to be operated by the state police to register sexual abuse complaints from women. It also is checking the possibility of setting up fast-track courts to dispose of pending cases pertaining to crimes against women. The Government of Tamil Nadu also announced a 13-point action plan to ensure safety of women in Tamil Nadu and said that incidents of sexual assault would be treated as a grave crime, and probes would be entrusted to top police officials. The chief minister also said that daily hearings would be conducted in all sexual <b>abuse</b> <b>cases</b> in the state for speedy trials at specially constituted fast-track courts, and women prosecutors would be appointed as government counsels. The Jammu and Kashmir government also announced plans to change the state's laws against sexual offences and gender crimes.

25|$|As Cardinal Ratzinger was Prefect of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith (CDF), {{the sexual}} abuse of minors by priests was his {{responsibility}} to investigate from 2001, when that charge {{was given to the}} CDF by Pope John Paul II.

As Prefect of the CDF, Canon Law directed Bishops to report sexual <b>abuse</b> <b>cases</b> involving priests in their diocese to Cardinal Ratzinger.

An <b>abuse</b> <b>case</b> scenario {{was performed to}} risk assess the PBAF approach against guessing attacks. Research studies [20, 25] suggest that challenge questions can be vulnerable to blind, focused and informed guessing attacks by adversaries, acquaintances, friends and colleagues. To evaluate the resilience of challenge questions to informed guessing attack by friends and colleagues, we performed an <b>abuse</b> <b>case</b> scenario involving pairs of friends and colleagues from the existing participants.

In a follow-up <b>abuse</b> <b>case</b> scenario, we circulated a list of 10 participants requesting them to identify their colleagues and friends from the first cohort, who participated in the learning and examination phases of the study.

25|$|Some {{sources have}} {{discussed}} {{a double standard}} regarding the conduct of female versus male teachers. When it comes to sexual harassment or sexual <b>abuse</b> <b>cases</b> involving a male teacher as the perpetrator to a female student, severe punishments are often the result. According to David Ring, a lawyer working with sexual <b>abuse</b> <b>cases,</b> {{it is not uncommon}} for the male teachers to be convicted, face jail time, or owe partial civil damages to the student victim depending on the severity of the case. When a female teacher is the perpetrator of sexual harassment to a male student, there are arguments that the female teachers are given lighter sentences and the male victims are given lower amounts of compensation due to the reasoning that teenage males would be willing to have sexual encounters with older, female teachers as a response to changes in their hormones.|$|E
