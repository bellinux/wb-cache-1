This research also examined the different interpretivist perceptions and experiences held by the three groups of stakeholders within each school: principals, <b>Talent</b> <b>Development</b> <b>Initiative</b> (TDI) coordinators and focus groups (classroom teachers) both {{during and after the}} TDI’s implementation. A qualitative methodology was employed for this small scale research. Three principals and three TDI coordinators were interviewed using a semi-structured interview format. All six of these participants had {{played a key role in}} the implementation of a TDI in their respective schools since its inception. Thirty classroom teachers across five focus groups, in three different schools, were involved where responses to questions were discussed within a group. In this way the findings were less likely to be intentionally influenced by the interviewer. The findings in this research have revealed that the issues of sustaining an initiative after external funding had ceased are complex. Issues include: decision-making processes and ownership, professional development and induction, and initiative overload. The modification of these issues either contributed to or hindered the level of ownership experienced by all stakeholders. Among all stakeholders there were perceptions or assumptions of the change processes that were viewed differently according to where a member was situated managerially in their school structure. However the perceptions or assumptions of an initiative’s implementation that are held by all stakeholders were not so easily aligned and unless questioned, appear to influence the complexities and tensions inherent in sustaining an initiative. How one group interprets the actions of another group and how they are constructed into perceptions and assumptions is the essence of what makes sustainability such a complex issue...|$|R

This article examines factors such as attachment difficulties and maternal depression as these may contribute to underachievement. The article reviews past and current practices of gifted identification and argues that schools {{have an important role}} in the early identification of socioemotional problems and learning difficulties, as these can create barriers to learning and achievement.

40|$|Objective: Successfully {{negotiating}} transitions between {{stages of}} development might determine future success more than how athletes perform within the stages. This process {{must be based on}} an understanding of the challenges inherent in the transition and the techniques which best counter these. Accordingly, {{the purpose of this study}} was to explore the experiences of 6 young high-level athletes during the normative transition to university and identify what factors prepared them to cope with the challenges faced. Specifically, investigation focused on the possession and deployment of Psychological Characteristics of Developing Excellence (PCDEs, MacNamara, Button, & Collins, 2010) as skills which have been previously proposed to facilitate progression. Design and Method: A quasi-longitudinal design was adopted and semi-structured interviews were conducted with a purposeful sample of student-athletes (n ¼ 6) and significant others pre and post the transition to university. An inductive and deductive content analysis was conducted following the recommendations of Côté, Salmela, Baria, and Russell (1993). Results and Conclusions: The transition to university was perceived as a process rather than an event, with considerable pre-emptive work taking place in the lead up to the move. Results suggest that, while these athletes experienced transitional challenges consistent with previous literature (Wylleman & Lavallee, 2004), the possession and appropriate deployment of a range of PCDEs allowed them to successfully negotiate these challenges. A case is made to include PCDEs in <b>talent</b> <b>development</b> <b>initiatives</b> so that aspiring elites develop these skills in advance of meeting the key challenges of development, thus smoothing the pathway to success and reducing the incidence of dropout...|$|R
40|$|This study {{investigated}} {{the evolution of a}} cluster concept involving primary schools that collaborated in a rural region of New Zealand {{to solve the problem of}} disadvantage for gifted and talented children. The principals formed a management committee to direct the implementation of a programme to ensure geographic isolation did not mean high ability children missed out on learning opportunities for the fulfilment of personal potential. As a collective provision, the cluster was an inaugural <b>Talent</b> <b>Development</b> <b>Initiative</b> and resourced by the Ministry of Education for six years from 2003 – 2008. One landmark feature was the partnership with an independent, rural education provider responsible for the facilitation and co-ordination. The literature revealed no evidence of similar provisions, so this paucity of research indicated the cluster management model was unique in Aotearoa-New Zealand. The purpose of this case study was to gain an insight from the perceptions of the principals into the ways the cluster was managed; the effectiveness of the provision; and the central ethos. The methodology was based on a phenomenological approach. Data was generated through a focus group because this forum paralleled the decision-making mode of leadership. The key finding for this investigation was that the cluster was an applicable and effective mechanism to provide for gifted and talented students in New Zealand. This success as a TDI was premised on the core principles for the creed of the cluster. Passion and commitment were essential. Professional development was critical to grow a teacher knowledge base and improve outcomes for students. Good funding was crucial to enhance talent and enable sustainability. It was important to develop a special concept of giftedness befitting the values of the cluster community and reflecting a child-centred approach integral to the shared philosophy. A significant component was the external facilitation to co-ordinate the programme and to weld the group into a cluster team. The ethos at the centre was the extraordinary spirit of collegiality and camaraderie binding the cluster together. These findings from this study confirm the cluster as a model of best practice in the field of New Zealand gifted and talented education...|$|R

40|$|The New Zealand Government {{recognises}} {{the importance}} of supporting all students in their learning to assist them to reach their full potential. This recognition is inclusive {{of gifted and talented}} students. Furthermore, boards of trustees, through their principal and staff, are required under the National Administration Guidelines, to demonstrate how they are catering for gifted and talented students. Notwithstanding this requirement, The Education Review Office (2008) report entitled Schools’ Provision for Gifted and Talented Students, confirms that a major challenge for school leadership is sustaining momentum of gifted and talented provisions and programmes. Despite this mandated intent, what happens in practice at the school level remains problematic. Teachers and schools welcomed the <b>Talent</b> <b>Development</b> <b>Initiative</b> (TDI), a Ministry of Education (MOE) Initiative, as it held some promise for developments in gifted and talented education. The first round of the initiative ran between 2003 and 2005 and the second from 2006 to 2008. Funding to support innovation and special developments in gifted education has been provided to 38 programmes nationwide. This initiative serviced some schools and educational bodies but a large number of others were left without an extra layer of support beyond their schools’ leadership actions. This study focuses on the school level, in particular teachers who are given additional responsibility, namely those with a coordination role. Moreover, my thesis is about how work {{to meet the needs of}} gifted and talented students can be sustained in schools to ensure the gifted and talented ‘torch’ can continue to ‘burn brightly’ over time. To gain an understanding of coordinators’ insights on what it takes to overcome the problem of sustaining provisions and programmes, this study adopts a qualitative, case study approach. I selected a purposive sample of six teachers with experience working in a gifted and talented coordinator role. The main source of data collection was individual semi-structured interviews (refer to Appendix A). I asked them questions about their role and how provisions were made for gifted and talented students at their schools. Further questions were asked about the support they received for their roles, particularly professional learning and development to enhance their practice. My findings show the responses from participants highlighted the important connection between leadership and learning. Knowledge and passion to do their best for gifted and talented students, although important, was not sufficient. The leadership actions and support provided by others in their setting and beyond their setting were likewise needed. My analysis revealed a range of strategies was deemed necessary to support the leadership of learning in classrooms, specifically the need for dialogue amongst teachers about identification, planning and evaluating provisions and programmes. All too often these gifted and talented coordinators worked alone in their roles, in isolation from others, and at times without the support they needed. Thus the success or failure of provisions and programmes for gifted and talented students rested on their ongoing commitment and drive. My study includes recommendations for practice. These recommendations suggest that provisions for gifted and talented students must be integrated into curriculum delivery and learning areas and be part of schools’ cultures in order for them to take hold and be sustained over time. Furthermore, there is a need to develop clarity of these provisions through job descriptions and for schools to undertake regular if not annual reviews of written documentation to guide ongoing work in gifted and talented education...|$|R
