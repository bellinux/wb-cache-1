5|$|Newnes {{stipulated that}} Borchgrevink's {{expedition}} must sail under the British flag, and be styled the British Antarctic Expedition. Borchgrevink readily <b>agreed</b> <b>to</b> <b>this,</b> even though {{only two of}} the entire expedition party were British. This increased the hostility and contempt of Markham, who chastised RGS librarian Hugh Robert Mill for attending the Southern Cross Expedition launch.|$|E
5|$|Although {{authorised}} {{the second}} half of the project – known as Drax Completion – was deferred, because during the project's gestation the Board's energy mix policy shifted to working towards a majority nuclear system. The Board decided in 1977 that construction of the final three units would commence in 1979 with the target of commissioning in 1985/6, as part of meeting load growth with an adjusted mix policy aiming for a balance of coal, nuclear, and oil. However later that year in July, the Government requested that Drax Completion proceed immediately, ahead of requirements, in order to secure jobs in the North East's heavy manufacturing industries. The Board <b>agreed</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> subject to being compensated.|$|E

5|$|At the {{beginning}} of 1839, Ranjang Pande was made the sole mukhtiyar. However, knowledge about Ranjang's war preparations and his communication with other princely states of India, fomenting anti-British sentiments, alarmed the Governor-General of the time, Lord Auckland, who mobilized some British troops near the border of Nepal. In order to resolve this diplomatic fiasco, Bhimsen was recalled from Gorkha {{and the rest of}} his confiscated property was also released. Bhimsen suggested some of the battalions under Ranjang's command to be given to other courtiers, thus severely weakening Ranjang's military power, and in the process convincing the British that Nepal was not on the path to war. The King <b>agreed</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> arrangement; however this aroused a strong suspicion in Samrajya Laxmi, who determined to eradicate Bhimsen's influence permanently.|$|E
5|$|Because of {{the need}} to defend against these incursions, the Byzantines could not afford to use all their forces against the Persians. Heraclius sent an envoy to the Avar Khagan, saying that the Byzantines would pay a tribute in return for the Avars to {{withdraw}} north of the Danube. The Khagan replied by asking for a meeting on 5 June 623, at Heraclea in Thrace, where the Avar army was located; Heraclius <b>agreed</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> meeting, coming with his royal court. The Khagan, however, put horsemen en route to Heraclea to ambush and capture Heraclius, so they could hold him for ransom.|$|E
5|$|In February 1942, Casterman {{suggested}} to Hergé that his books {{be published in}} a new format; 62-pages rather than the former 100 to 130 pages, and now in full colour rather than black-and-white. He <b>agreed</b> <b>to</b> <b>this,</b> and in 1943 The Crab with the Golden Claws was re-edited and coloured for publication as an album in 1944. Due to the changes in how the adventure had been serialised at , the album at this juncture was only 58 pages long, and thus Hergé filled the missing pages with four full-page colour frames, thus bringing {{it up to the}} standard 62-page format.|$|E

5|$|In early 1980, Singapore lodged {{a formal}} protest with Malaysia in {{response}} to a map published by Malaysia in 1979 claiming Pedra Branca. In 1989 Singapore proposed submitting the dispute to the ICJ. Malaysia <b>agreed</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> in 1994. In 1993, Singapore also claimed the nearby islets Middle Rocks and South Ledge. In 1998 the two countries agreed on the text of a Special Agreement that was needed to submit the dispute to the ICJ. The Special Agreement was signed in February 2003, and the ICJ formally notified of the Agreement in July that year. The hearing before the ICJ was held over three weeks in November 2007 under the name Sovereignty over Pedra Branca/Pulau Batu Puteh, Middle Rocks and South Ledge (Malaysia v. Singapore).|$|E
5|$|Leiva wrote a {{constitutional}} code {{to regulate the}} actions of the Junta. It stipulated that the Junta could not exercise judicial power, which was reserved for the Royal Audiencia of Buenos Aires; that Cisneros could not act without the support of {{the other members of the}} Junta; that the Cabildo could dismiss anyone who neglected his duty; that the Cabildo's consent would be required to create new taxes; that the Junta would sanction a general amnesty for those who had aired opinions at the open cabildo; and that the Junta would invite the other cities to send delegates. The commanders of the armed forces, including Saavedra and Pedro Andrés García, <b>agreed</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> code. The Junta swore the oath of office that afternoon.|$|E
5|$|On 28 January 2008, Hooper {{signed a}} one-month loan deal with League Two club Hereford United. He made his debut {{two days after}} signing for them, {{starting}} in a 2–1 loss to Barnet. He scored in his next match for the club, a 1–0 win over Rotherham United. He played five more times, scoring four goals, before his loan deal was due to expire on 28 February. However, manager Graham Turner agreed a deal to keep him {{until the end of}} the season. Southend manager Steve Tilson <b>agreed</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> despite having two strikers out injured at the time. Hooper's 11 goals in 19 appearances for Hereford helped them finish third in League Two and secure promotion.|$|E

5|$|The Athenians seem to {{have offered}} Philip Pydna in {{exchange}} for Amphipolis, perhaps during the later stages of the siege, {{but it is not}} clear whether Philip <b>agreed</b> <b>to</b> <b>this.</b> By this stage, the Social War of 357–355 BC had broken out between Athens and their erstwhile allies, and they would now have been unable to intervene to help Amphipolis. Philip eventually succeeded in breaching the walls of Amphipolis, through the use of siege engines and battering rams; his forces then stormed and captured the city. Philip expelled those who were hostile to him but, according to Diodorus, treated the rest of the population considerately.|$|E
5|$|The first Prussian corps {{to arrive}} in {{strength}} was Bülow's IV Corps. Bülow's objective was Plancenoit, which the Prussians intended {{to use as a}} springboard into the rear of the French positions. Blücher intended to secure his right upon the Châteaux Frichermont using the Bois de Paris road. Blücher and Wellington had been exchanging communications since 10:00 and had <b>agreed</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> advance on Frichermont if Wellington's centre was under attack. General Bülow noted that the way to Plancenoit lay open and that the time was 16:30.|$|E
5|$|The two Roman forces met on {{the banks}} of the Euphrates near Melitene, amidst scenes of mutual grief; while Corbulo lamented the undoing of his achievements, Paetus tried to {{convince}} him to attempt to reverse the situation by invading Armenia. Corbulo however refused, claiming that he did not have the authority to do so, and that either way the army was too worn out to be able to campaign effectively. In the end, Paetus retired to Cappadocia and Corbulo to Syria, where he received envoys from Vologases, who demanded that he evacuate his bridgehead over the Euphrates. In turn, Corbulo demanded the Parthian evacuation of Armenia. Vologases <b>agreed</b> <b>to</b> <b>this,</b> and both sides withdrew their forces, leaving Armenia once again masterless but de facto under Parthian control, until a Parthian delegation could travel to Rome.|$|E

5|$|When the Eretrians had {{discovered}} that the Persian task force was heading to attack them, they had appealed to the Athenians to send reinforcements. The Athenians <b>agreed</b> <b>to</b> <b>this,</b> and instructed the 4,000 Athenian colonists from the nearby Euboean city of Chalcis to aid the Eretrians. These colonists had been planted on Chalcidian land after Athens had defeated Chalcis some 20 years previously. However, when these Athenians arrived at Eretria, they were told by a leading citizen, Aeschines, of the divisions amongst the Eretrians, and he advised them to leave and save themselves. The Athenians followed Aeschines' advice and sailed to Oropus, thus avoiding {{the fate of the}} Eretrians.|$|E
5|$|At {{some point}} in 1940 or early 1941, Treloar {{requested}} that he be appointed to command the War Records Section, which formed part of the Second Australian Imperial Force's administrative headquarters. The Cabinet <b>agreed</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> during February 1941. Treloar's responsibilities in this role were to coordinate and control the collection of material {{to be included in}} the AWM as well as to supervise the official war artists and photographers; these duties were similar to those he and Bean had undertaken during World War I. While Treloar was appointed to the rank of lieutenant colonel, he primarily worked for the AWM, which reimbursed the Army for his salary and allowances. This arrangement gave Treloar less influence with the Army than he had enjoyed as head of the AWRS during World War I. General Thomas Blamey, the commander of the AIF, subsequently redesignated the War Records Section the Military History and Information Section (MHIS) on the grounds that its original name had not adequately described the unit's role. In contrast to the DOI's propaganda activities, the MHIS focused on collecting records, images and items that would be useful to historians.|$|E
5|$|During the Duke's {{march to}} the Danube Emperor LeopoldI offered to make Marlborough a prince of the Holy Roman Empire in the small principality of Mindelheim. The Queen enthusiastically <b>agreed</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> elevation, but after the successes of 1704, the {{campaign}} of 1705 brought little reason for satisfaction on the Continent. The planned invasion of France via the Moselle valley was frustrated by friend and foe alike, forcing the Duke to withdraw back towards the Low Countries. Although Marlborough penetrated the Lines of Brabant at Elixheim in July, Allied indecision and considerable Dutch hesitancy (concerned as they were {{for the security of}} their homeland), prevented the Duke from pressing his advantage. The French and the Tories in England dismissed arguments that only Dutch obstructionism had robbed Marlborough of a great victory in 1705, confirmed in their belief that Blenheim had been a lucky strike and that Marlborough was a general not to be feared.|$|E

5|$|In February 1761 Blackstone was {{considered}} as a potential Tory candidate for the rotten borough of Hindon in Wiltshire. After consultation with friends, he <b>agreed</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> prospect – {{at the same time}} refusing the offer of appointment as Lord Chief Justice of Ireland. On 30 March 1761 he was returned for Hindon, and took his seat. This did not limit his legal work, initially, with the seat being given without a requirement to attend or vote in a particular way, and the grant of a patent of precedence at the same time actually increased the demand on his time. Court records show him pleading before Lord Mansfield in the Court of King's Bench soon after his election, and acting as counsel in Tonson v Collins, a copyright case, Thiquet v Bath, an important case on international law, and R v d'Eon, acting for the prosecution in a feud over Louis XV's newly appointed cross-dressing Ambassador to the United Kingdom.|$|E
5|$|Issues arose {{after the}} {{erection}} of the memorial concerning the names {{inscribed on the}} Cenotaph. The committee had identified 1,793 names of Southampton men, {{and a number of}} women, who had died during the war and these had been inscribed on the Cenotaph. After the unveiling of the monument various relatives approached the committee requesting that additional names be added; after a newspaper campaign in the Southern Daily Echo newspaper, Kimber <b>agreed</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> and 203 additional names were inscribed in 1921. Another name was added in 1922, bringing the total to 1,997. More controversy surrounded the exclusion of the Jewish war dead from the memorial. Jews in Southampton had donated to the committee on the understanding that the memorial would commemorate not only Christian casualties but Jewish ones as well: one in ten adult male Jews in Southampton died during the conflict, twice the proportion for Southampton as a whole. Following the final decision on the design of the Cenotaph, however, which featured a prominent Christian cross, Jewish names were predominantly excluded from the memorial and only one Jewish name was finally inscribed on it.|$|E
5|$|One {{month after}} moving to Diego-Suarez, Jaojoby entered a local talent {{competition}} and managed to win despite singing unaccompanied and without a microphone.

The uncle with whom he was lodging sent word of Jaojoby's activities to the young singer's parents, who consulted a priest before giving their son permission to continue exploring his musical talents {{on the condition that}} he continue to perform well at school. Jaojoby <b>agreed</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> provision, studying during the day and performing at night for several years. In 1972 he began singing with Los Matadores, the well-established house band of the Saigonais nightclub in Diego-Suarez. This group catered to the club's primarily Western clientele by performing cover songs and rhythm and blues compositions in French and English, occasionally incorporating traditional instruments like kabosy and drums, or experimenting with local musical styles using electric guitar, bass, and drum kit, accompanied by traditional Malagasy language vocal performance.|$|E
