5|$|India ranks first {{worldwide}} in farm output. Agriculture and allied sectors like forestry, logging and fishing accounted for 18.6% of the GDP in 2005, employed 60% {{of the total}} workforce and despite a steady decline of its share in the GDP, is still the largest economic sector and {{plays a significant role}} in the overall socio-economic development of India. Yields per unit area of all crops have grown since 1950, due to the special emphasis placed on agriculture in the five-year plans and steady improvements in irrigation, technology, application of modern agricultural practices and provision of <b>agricultural</b> <b>credit</b> and subsidies since the green revolution.|$|E
5|$|In 1972, UPCA {{requested}} Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos {{to allow}} the college to secede from the University of the Philippines due to the alleged withholding of its budget and the disapproval of curricular proposals. However, UP President Salvador P. Lopez strongly opposed the idea. A survey {{found that there was}} very little support for complete independence at UPCA. As a compromise, Lopez proposed the transformation of UP into a system of autonomous constituent universities. Finally, on 20 November 1972, Presidential Decree No. 58 was signed, establishing UPLB as UP's first autonomous campus, with UPCA, College of Forestry, <b>Agricultural</b> <b>Credit</b> and Cooperatives Institute, Dairy Training and Research Institute, and the Diliman-based Agrarian Reform Institute as its first academic units. New colleges and research centers were created over the next few years, while the College of Veterinary Medicine was likewise transferred to UPLB from UP Diliman.|$|E

40|$|The European Union’s {{policy on}} {{sustainable}} rural development {{is based on}} increased productivity in European agriculture and the insurance of financing resources, inclusively from banking credits. The need for credits in agriculture is bigger than in other sectors. Analyzing the volume of <b>agricultural</b> <b>credits</b> granted in the European space and the accessibility degree of these, we ascertain that the <b>agricultural</b> <b>credit’s</b> weight granted by Romanian and French banks is relatively reduced given the credits total volume. This situation requires the existence of some regulation mechanisms at international level, which offer a chance of development and progress to cultivators from all the European countries...|$|R
50|$|Duplessis favoured {{rural areas}} over city {{development}} and introduced various <b>agricultural</b> <b>credits</b> {{during his first}} term.

25|$|To back up {{the impact}} of the price shocks, the {{government}} declared that it would keep its own expenditure within the limit of current revenue and stop the other two large streams of Central Bank credit creation: Central Bank financing for <b>agricultural</b> <b>credit</b> and for the system of subsidies supporting differential exchange rates. The multiple exchange rates in effect under García were to be unified, and the unified rate was to be determined by market forces. Further, competition from imports to restrain inflation and access to imported supplies for production would both be improved by taking away quantitative restrictions and reducing tariff rates.|$|E
25|$|The new {{government}} decided {{to concentrate on}} developing agriculture, while doing little to help the industrial sector. Agriculture responded well with stricter quality-control being introduced and the passing of a Land Act to help farmers buy their farms. Also, the Irish Sugar Company and the <b>Agricultural</b> <b>Credit</b> Corporation were established to encourage growth. However, the economic depression that hit in the 1930s soon undid the good work of Cosgrave and his ministers. Industry was seen as secondary to agriculture and little was done to improve it. The loss of the industrialised north-east of Ireland had a bad effect on {{the country as a}} whole. However, the Electricity Supply Board, with the first national grid in Europe, was established to provide employment and electricity to the new state.|$|E
25|$|The Modern Architecture is {{characterized}} by being free of ornamental designs that identify the buildings of the Republican period, and the trend toward architectural rationalism in concrete. Among the most valuable examples of modern architecture in the city include the National Building (1945), seat of the judicial branch, designed by German architect Leopoldo Rother, Queen Mary's Cathedral (begun in 1955) and the old building of the <b>Agricultural</b> <b>Credit</b> Bank (1964), located {{on the top of}} Paseo de Bolívar and designed by architect Fernando Martínez Sanabria. Also, worth mentioning is the Sena buildings, the elegant building of Telecom (with a sculpture by Alejandro Obregón in the square of access), the buildings of the Universidad del Atlantico and the Mayor building in the Paseo de Bolívar, a former building of the Bank of the Republic.|$|E

25|$|Rodezno and {{his wife}} held land estates {{scattered}} across Spain: in Navarre, Extremadura and Andalusia. Some authors refer to him as “grande terrateniente” “cacique terrateniente”, “grandee proprietor” or “prominent landowner”, an exemplary case of link between landownership and power, though exact size of his holdings is unclear and probably did not exceed 500 ha combined. He was head of Federacion Catolico Agraria de Navarra, co-founder of Asociación de Terratenientes de Navarra and member of Asociacion de Propietarios de Alcornocales. On behalf {{of some of these}} pressure groups he held talks with various ministers, publishing also analytical studies on <b>agricultural</b> <b>credit</b> and land ownership. In his opinion in terms of rural property the Navarrese structure was close to ideal, almost reaching the objective “que todos los agricultores fueran propietarios”.|$|E
25|$|Pakistan is a net food exporter, {{except in}} {{occasional}} years when its harvest is {{adversely affected by}} droughts. Pakistan exports rice, cotton, fish, fruits (especially Oranges and Mangoes), and vegetables and imports vegetable oil, wheat, pulses and consumer foods. The country is Asia's largest camel market, second-largest apricot and ghee market and third-largest cotton, onion and milk market. The economic importance of agriculture has declined since independence, when its share of GDP was around 53%. Following the poor harvest of 1993, the government introduced agriculture assistance policies, including increased support prices for many agricultural commodities and expanded availability of <b>agricultural</b> <b>credit.</b> From 1993 to 1997, real growth in the agricultural sector averaged 5.7% but has since declined to about 4%. Agricultural reforms, including increased wheat and oil seed production, {{play a central role}} in the government's economic reform package.|$|E
25|$|Although the {{government}} reduced its total spending, it managed {{to support a}} new public works program to provide temporary employment and to direct more resources to rural producers as intended in its program for structural change. Three lines of policy helped especially to raise rural incomes. The first was to use generous guaranteed prices for key food products. The second was to provide greatly increased <b>agricultural</b> <b>credit,</b> financed essentially by credit from the Central Bank. The third was to exempt most of the non-guaranteed agricultural prices from controls, allowing their prices to rise sharply relative to those of industrial products from the modern sector. From July 1985 to December 1986, prices {{of goods and services}} not under control increased more than three times as much as those under control. Wholesale prices in manufacturing increased 26 percent, but those for agricultural products increased 142 percent.|$|E

25|$|India ranks second {{worldwide}} in farm output. Agriculture and allied sectors like forestry, logging and fishing accounted for 17% of the GDP and employed 49% {{of its total}} workforce in 2014. As the Indian economy has diversified and grown, agriculture's contribution to GDP has steadily declined from 1951 to 2011, yet {{it is still the}} country's largest employment source and a significant piece of its overall socio-economic development. Crop-yield-per-unit-area of all crops has grown since 1950, due to the special emphasis placed on agriculture in the five-year plans and steady improvements in irrigation, technology, application of modern agricultural practices and provision of <b>agricultural</b> <b>credit</b> and subsidies since the Green Revolution in India. However, international comparisons reveal the average yield in India is generally 30% to 50% of the highest average yield in the world. The states of Uttar Pradesh, Punjab, Haryana, Madhya Pradesh, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Bihar, West Bengal, Gujarat and Maharashtra are key contributors to Indian agriculture.|$|E

2500|$|After {{nine years}} in bankruptcy, the C. & N. W. was reorganized in 1944. It had turned rapidly to diesel power, {{established}} a huge diesel shop in Chicago. Its Proviso freight classification yard in Chicago was {{the largest in the}} world, with 224 miles of trackage, capacity to handle more than 20,000 cars. Potatoes from the West were a main crop loading of the C. & N. W., and its potato sheds in Chicago were the largest in the country. It also carried western sugar beets and huge amounts of corn and wheat. This road, like other lines depending heavily on crop movements, was adversely affected by government <b>agricultural</b> <b>credit</b> policies which sealed up a lot of products on the farms where they were produced. Although it stood sixteenth in operating revenue in 1938, it was eighth in passenger revenue among American roads.

This move did not please the Residence which denounced the [...] "convicted diligence" [...] of Chenik. The colonial administration thus decided to seal his bank accounts. Despite this, there was no reaction in public opinion or among nationalists, even though the Tunisian members of the Great Council were collaborating with the protectorate. Only Bourguiba disapproved of the reaction of his friends, that he qualified as primary, writing: [...] "I had there a first-hand witness who would give me weapons against the Protectorate and means to strengthen my position towards this regime.

40|$|This {{study is}} about {{political}} business cycles (PBC) and investigates the Tur-kish {{case in the}} 1977 - 2001 period. The PBC literature has been developed in the last four-five decades and links economics and politics in several ways. In {{the first part of}} the study, developments in the literature are mentioned and the link between New Classical Economics and New Political Economics is introdu-ced. In the second part, Turkish case is analyzed in details to determine whether there have been PBC during the above mentioned period. The results show that there have been political cycles in some macroeconomic variables which are currency issued, broad money (M 1), public sector <b>credits</b> and <b>agricultural</b> <b>credits</b> extended by Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey (CBRT), and tax revenues. CBRT has not allowed PBC especially on the targeted variables (CBRT balance sheet size, net domestic assets and monetary base), after 1989. Due to the high legal ceilings of CBRT credits to the pub-lic sector, CBRT was not able to limit those credits, especially before 1991 general ele-ctions. There had been similar PBC on <b>agricultural</b> <b>credits</b> which had been extended in the 1977 - 1991 period by CBRT. In addition to the regression analysis, comparative tables and figures for personnel expenditures of State Economic Enterprises (SEEs), <b>agricultural</b> <b>credits</b> which had been extended by Agricultural Bank of the Republic of Turkey (ABRT) in the 1964 - 1998 period and agricultural prices which had been dec-lared by governments in the 1986 - 1999 period are provided in the paper.
