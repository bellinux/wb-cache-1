40|$|We {{investigated}} experimentally non-equilibrium {{state of}} a {{two-dimensional electron gas}} (2 DEG) in the quantum Hall effect (QHE) regime, studying the hysteresis of magnetoresistance of a 2 DEG with a constriction. The large amplitude of the hysteresis enabled us to make the consistent phenomenological description of the hysteresis. We studied the dependence on the magnetic field sweep prehistory (minor loop measurements), recovered the <b>anhysteretic</b> <b>curve,</b> and studied the time dependence of the magnetoresistance. We showed that the hysteresis of magnetoresistance of a 2 DEG in the QHE regime has significant phenomenological similarities with the hysteresis of magnetization of ferromagnetic materials, showing multistability, jumps of relaxation, and having the <b>anhysteretic</b> <b>curve.</b> Nevertheless, we revealed the crucial difference, manifested itself in an unusual inverted (anti-coercive) behavior of the magnetoresistance hysteresis. The time relaxation of the hysteresis has fast and slow regimes, {{similar to that of}} non-equilibrium magnetization of a 2 DEG in QHE regime pointing to their common origin. We studied the dependence of the hysteresis loop area on the lithographic width of the constriction and found the threshold value of width ∼ 1. 35 μm beyond which the hysteresis is not observed. This points to the edge nature of the non-equilibrium currents (NECs) and allows us to determine the width of the NECs area (∼ 0. 5 μm). We suggest the qualitative picture of the observed hysteresis, based on non-equilibrium redistribution of the electrons among the Landau level states and assuming huge imbalance between the population of bulk and edge electronic states.

Our investigation consists of developing an analytical model to consider these magnetic properties while modelling electromagnetic systems. From rotational measurements, the <b>anhysteretic</b> <b>curves</b> are interpolated in order to extract the magnetic energy density for different directions and amplitudes of the magnetic flux density. Furthermore, the analytical representation of this energy is suggested based on statistical distribution which aims to minimize the intrinsic energy of the material.

Magnetic quantities (isothermal magnetisation, initial and high-field susceptibilities, FC/ZFC curves) were obtained between 10 and 400 K using an extraction method and vibrating-sample magnetometry. Magnetisation curves exhibit an apparent superparamagnetic behaviour {{with a small}} hysteresis which disappears above 270 K. FC/ZFC curves become separate below 50 K. <b>Anhysteretic</b> <b>curves</b> are fitted by a Langevin function with a single, temperature-dependent magnetic moment.

40|$|An automated, {{non-destructive}} anhysteretic magnetization {{characterization method}} for studying and modeling soft magnetic materials. This measurement method employs a “reading-waveform” that allows multiple points of reference {{to be established}} in tracing out the B waveform. In using the reference values from this waveform, the components of B that cannot be measured directly may be calculated with precision. In turn, the initial magnitude of the B waveform is identified as the unknown component of the anhysteretic state. The processes can be repeated for different values of static fields {{as well as a}} function of temperature to produce a family of <b>anhysteretic</b> magnetization <b>curves.</b> The core characterization was performed without physically altering the core, so that the true <b>anhysteretic</b> magnetization <b>curve,</b> and the true B-H loop under applied bias H, is measured...|$|R

40|$|The {{magnetic}} {{order of}} La 0. 7 Sr 0. 3 MnO 3 nanoparticles (NPs) fabricated in a SPEX D 8000 mill was systematically studied. The La 0. 7 Sr 0. 3 MnO 3 nanocrystals grow from the milled constituent oxides during the milling processes. The magnetization {{data obtained by}} using a SQUID magnetometer show the NPs as a superparamagnet in terms of <b>anhysteretic</b> <b>curves</b> near room temperature. Unoverlaping of the scaled M(H-ext, T) /M-s vs. H-ext, T plots and the dc susceptibility obeying the Curie-Weiss behavior rather than the Curie law at high temperatures provide evidence that the NPs are interacting superparamagnetic ensembles. A mean-field correction to the Langevin function L ([H-ext + alpha M]/k(B) T) worked well for the magnetic ordering of the NPs. By means of the Langevin fitting, {{the diameter of the}} NP was estimated to be lower than 15 nm, depending oil the milling time. The saturation magnetization of NPs varied from 48. 5 em/g to 19 emu/g, with the higher value corresponding to a larger particle size. A core-shell structure of the NP was adopted, with the NP having the core-shell magnetically-effective mass density. This is applicable to the variation of the saturation magnetization with particle size. Comment: 10 pages, 5 figure...|$|R

Two standard non-oriented grades and a high-silicon grade (Si content of 6. 5 %) made by CVD are analyzed. An excellent match is obtained using the double Langevin function, whereas the classical solutions are less appropriate. Thereby, problems such as those due to propagation of approximation errors observed in hysteresis modeling can be bypassed...|$|R
40|$|International audienceSome soft {{magnetic}} materials are strongly dependent of the temperature, because oftheir low Curie temperature. In order to predict their behavior in electrical devices,engineers need hysteresis models able {{to take into account}} the temperature. TheVector Play static hysteresis model is an interesting hysteresis model that can bemodified in order {{to take into account the}} thermal behavior (F. Sixdenier, O. MESSAL,A. HILAL, C. Martin, M. A. Raulet R. Scorretti, ”Temperature dependent extensionof a static hysteresis model”, IEEE Transactions on Magnetics, Volume:PP, Issue: 99) where variations of some parameters with temperature are issued orbuild thanks to the literature. The purely magnetic behavior showed some errors for”complex” low amplitude signals. These errors could be explained by (1) used toapproximate measured <b>anhysteretic</b> <b>curves,</b> which is known to be not so accurate. Accuracy might be improved by numerically interpolating measured anhystereticcurves at different temperatures Man(h, T). This last technique will be tested inthis paper. A qualitative and quantitative analysis of results will be made in orderto qualify the method as a valid extension of the vector play model in order to takeinto account the thermal behavior.

50|$|Another kind of {{laboratory}} remanence is anhysteretic remanence or anhysteretic remanent magnetization (ARM). This is induced by exposing a magnet {{to a large}} alternating field plus a small dc bias field. The amplitude of the alternating field is gradually reduced to zero to get an anhysteretic magnetization, and then the bias field is removed to get the remanence. The <b>anhysteretic</b> magnetization <b>curve</b> is often close {{to an average of}} the two branches of the hysteresis loop, and is assumed in some models to represent the lowest-energy state for a given field. ARM has also been studied because of its similarity to the write process in some magnetic recording technology and to the acquisition of natural remanent magnetization in rocks.|$|R
40|$|An {{extension}} {{to the model}} of hysteresis has been presented earlier which included the effect of anisotropy in the modeling of the <b>anhysteretic</b> magnetization <b>curves</b> of uniaxially anisotropic single crystalline materials. Further exploration of this extension shown here considers different kinds of crystal anisotropy in materials. Theory considers that the differential susceptibility at any given field {{is determined by the}} displacement of the prevailing magnetization from the anhysteretic magnetization. Thus, {{it has been shown that}} the effect of anisotropy on magnetic hysteresis in materials can be incorporated into the model of hysteresis through the anisotropic anhysteretic. This extension is likely to be particularly useful in the case of hard magnetic materials which exhibit high anisotropy...|$|R
40|$|Dipole-dipole {{interactions}} {{in a square}} planar array of sub-micron magnetic disks (magnetic dots) have been studied theoretically. Under a normal magnetic field the ground-state of the array undergoes many structural transitions between the limiting chessboard antiferromagnetic state at zero field and the ferromagnet at a threshold field. At intermediate fields, numerous ferrimagnetic states having mean magnetic moments between zero {{and that of the}} ferromagnetic state are favorable energetically. The structures and energies of a selection of states are calculated and plotted, as are the fields required to optimally reverse the magnetic moment of a single dot within them.

The results confirm earlier studies that show the sign of the derivative dM/dσ changes at different locations on the M,H plane, and can even change {{as a result of a}} monotonic increase of stress either in compression or tension. The observed behavior can be explained on the basis of a recent theory which predicts that the irreversible changes in magnetization resulting from changes in applied stress cause the magnetization to approach the <b>anhysteretic</b> magnetization <b>curve</b> at the given applied field strength...|$|R

40|$|An energy based {{stochastic}} model for temperature dependent <b>anhysteretic</b> magnetization <b>curves</b> of ferromagnetic materials is proposed and bench marked against experimental data. This {{is based on}} the calculation of macroscopic magnetic properties by performing an energy weighted average over all possible orientations of the magnetization vector. Most prior approaches that employ this method are unable to independently account for the effect of both inhomogeneity and temperature in performing the averaging necessary to model experimental data. Here we propose a way to account for both effects simultaneously and benchmark the model against experimental data from ~ 5 K to ~ 300 K for two different materials in both annealed (fewer inhomogeneities) and deformed (more inhomogeneities) samples. This demonstrates that the independent accounting for the effect of both inhomogeneity and temperature is necessary to correctly model temperature dependent magnetization behavior.

40|$|A new {{transformer}} {{model has}} been developed for the implementation in a harmonic load-flow program. It is obtained by coupling the electrical equations with a magnetic equivalent circuit, which allows computing the currents in the primary and the secondary windings, and thus the magnetizing current, {{on the basis of}} the applied voltages. The equations are developed in the frequency domain and, for three-phase transformers, symmetrical components are used. The saturation of both legs and yokes is represented by <b>anhysteretic</b> magnetization <b>curves.</b> The model can be applied for various core topologies and connections of the windings. By way of illustration, both a single-phase transformer and a three-phase three-legged transformer are discussed in detail.

40|$|The anhysteretic {{magnetization}} of the granular metallic alloy Cu(90) Co(10) is experimentally studied {{over a wide}} {{temperature range}} (2 - 700 K). The measurements definitely exclude that this alloy is a simple superparamagnet, even in the high-temperature limit, although some features of granular systems [such as the typical Langevin-like form of the <b>anhysteretic</b> magnetization <b>curves</b> M(H) ] are often taken as evidence of superparamagnetism. A phenomenological theory is proposed, explicitly considering that particle moments interact through long-ranged dipolar random forces, whose effect is pictured {{in terms of a}} temperature T*, adding to the actual temperature T in the denominator of the Langevin function argument. This simple formula explains all features of the experimental M(H) curves. The theory indicates that the actual magnetic moments on interacting Co particles are systematically larger than those obtained fitting the magnetic data to a conventional Langevin function. The Cu(90) Co(10) granular alloy is therefore identified as an "interacting superparamagnet" ISR The ISP regime appears as separating the high-temperature, conventional superparamagnetic phase from the low-temperature, blocked-particle regime. In this way, a magnetic-regime diagram can be drawn for each granular system. The competition between single-particle and collective blocking mechanisms is briefly analyzed. The proposed interpretation is thought to be applicable to other fine particle systems; its main features and intrinsic limits are discussed...|$|R

40|$|Magnetic {{responses}} of superparamagnetic nanoparticles to high-frequency AC magnetic fields with sufficiently large amplitudes are numerically simulated to exactly clarify the phenomena occurring in magnetic particle imaging. When the magnetic anisotropy energy inevitable in actual nanoparticles is {{taken into account}} in considering the magnetic potential, larger nanoparticles exhibit a delayed response to alternations of the magnetic fields. This kind of delay is rather remarkable in the lower-amplitude range of the field, where the assistance by the Zeeman energy to thermally activated magnetization reversal is insufficient. In some cases, a sign inversion of the third-order harmonic response was found to occur at some specific amplitude, despite the lack in DC bias magnetic field strength. Considering the attenuation of the AC magnetic field generated in the human body, {{it is possible that the}} phases of the signals from nanoparticles deep inside the body and those near the body surface are completely different. This may lead to artifacts in the reconstructed image. Furthermore, when the magnetic/thermal torque-driven rotation of the anisotropic nanoparticles as well as the magnetic anisotropy energy are taken into account, the simulated results show that, once the easy axes are aligned toward the direction of the DC bias magnetic field, it takes time to randomize them at the field-free point. During this relaxation, the third-order harmonic response depends highly upon the history of the magnetic field. This is because non-linearity of the <b>anhysteretic</b> magnetization <b>curve</b> for the superparamagnetic nanoparticles varies with the orientations of the easy axes. This history dependence may also lead to another artifact in magnetic particle imaging, when the scanning of the field-free point is faster than the Brownian relaxations...|$|R
40|$|The {{existence}} of high-temperature ferromagnetism in thin films and nanoparticles of oxides containing small quantities of magnetic dopants remains controversial. Some regard these materials as dilute magnetic semiconductors, while others {{think they are}} ferromagnetic only because the magnetic dopants form secondary ferromagnetic impurity phases such as cobalt metal or magnetite. There are also reports in d 0 systems and other defective oxides that contain no magnetic ions. Here, we investigate TiO 2 (rutile) containing 1 - 5 % of iron cations and find that the room-temperature ferromagnetism of films prepared by pulsed-laser deposition is not due to magnetic ordering of the iron. The films are neither dilute magnetic semiconductors nor hosts to an iron-based ferromagnetic impurity phase. A new model is developed for defect-related ferromagnetism which involves a spin-split defect band populated by charge transfer from a proximate charge reservoir {{in the present case}} a mixture Fe 2 + and Fe 3 + ions in the oxide lattice. The phase diagram for the model shows how inhomogeneous Stoner ferromagnetism depends on the total number of electrons Ntot, the Stoner exchange integral I and the defect bandwidth W; the band occupancy is governed by the d-d Coulomb interaction U. There are regions of ferromagnetic metal, half-metal and insulator as well as nonmagnetic metal and insulator. A characteristic feature of the high-temperature Stoner magnetism is an an <b>anhysteretic</b> magnetization <b>curve</b> which is practically temperature independent below room temperature. This is related to a wandering ferromagnetic axis which is determined by local dipole fields. The magnetization is limited by the defect concentration, not by the 3 d doping. Only 1 - 2 % of the volume of the films is magnetically ordered. Comment: 22 pages, 6 figure...|$|R
40|$|The {{magnetism}} of nanoparticles {{and thin}} films of wide-bandgap oxides that include no magnetic cations is an unsolved puzzle. Progress has been hampered {{both by the}} irreproducibility {{of much of the}} experimental data, and the lack of any generally-accepted theoretical explanation. The characteristic signature is a virtually <b>anhysteretic,</b> temperature-independent magnetization <b>curve</b> which saturates in an applied field that is several orders of magnitude greater than the magnetization. It appears as if a tiny volume fraction, < 0. 1 %, of the samples is magnetic and that the energy scale of the problem is unusually high for spin magnetism. Here we investigate the effect of dispersing 4 nm CeO 2 nanoparticles with powders of gamma-Al 2 O 3, sugar or latex microspheres. The saturation magnetization, Ms ~ 60 A/m for compact samples, is maximized by 1 wt% lanthanum doping. Dispersing the CeO 2 nanopowder reduces its magnetic moment by up to an order of magnitude. There is a characteristic length scale of order 100 nm for the magnetism to appear in CeO 2 nanoparticle clusters. The phenomenon is explained in terms of a giant orbital paramagnetism that appears in coherent mesoscopic domains due to resonant interaction with zero-point fluctuations of the vacuum electromagnetic field. The theory explains the observed temperature-independent magnetization curve and its doping and dispersion dependence, based on a length scale of 300 nm that corresponds to the wavelength of a maximum in the UV absorption spectrum of the magnetic CeO 2 nanoparticles. The coherent domains occupy roughly ten percent of the sample volume...|$|R
