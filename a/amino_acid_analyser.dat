40|$|The {{starting}} point of the current work is the hypothesis that amino acids are being synthesized abiotically in the hydrogen sulphide bearing anoxic Lake Nakanoumi (Kimoto and Fujinaga, 1988, 1990). Kimoto and Fujinaga claimed to have detected amino acids in an experiment modelling the lake. The <b>amino</b> <b>acid</b> <b>analyser</b> (HPLC), however, is considered an inappropriate analytical instrument in this case as it is dedicated primarily to the analyses of amino acids and not to other organic molecules. Analyses by HPLC confirmed the reported data, however gas chromatography and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analyses, including selected ion monitoring, failed to verify the presence of amino acids. Some of the compounds identified (amines and carbon/sulphur- and carbon/sulphur/nitrogen ring systems) might account for false detection of amino acids by the <b>amino</b> <b>acid</b> <b>analyser</b> and can, unlike amino acids, {{be obtained from the}} starting materials by known chemical reactions.

The study consisted of eighteen patients (female/male: 10 / 8; age: 73. 1 ± 4. 1) with acute IS that was confirmed by way of computed tomography, while twelve sex and age matched individuals were assigned as control group. During the study period, the patients did not receive any supplemental <b>amino</b> <b>acids</b> therapy that could affect the obtained results. The venous blood was obtained after > 3 hours fasting at two time-points; time-point 1 – at admission to the hospital; time-point 2 – on day 5 from stroke onset. The blood for control purposes was collected only once, and the blood collection at time-point 1 was done before thrombolytic treatment (nine patients). The <b>amino</b> <b>acids</b> were identified using the <b>Amino</b> <b>Acids</b> <b>Analyser</b> (AAA 400) by INGOS Corp., Praha, Czech Republic. Our results revealed a statistically significant increase of glutamate, cystine and methionine on day 1 of stroke, in comparison to control, whereas, proline level was decreased on day 1 of stroke – in comparison to control serum. On comparing day 5 to the initial day of IS, elevation was observed of levels of asparagine, glycine, tyrosine, arginine, threonine, valine, leucine and phenylalanine. It can be said, then, that ischemic stroke induces both essential and nonessential <b>amino</b> <b>acid</b> fluctuations. Moreover, the decrease in proline and glutamine serum level with the simultaneous increase in the concentration of branch chain <b>amino</b> <b>acids,</b> Glu and Thr suggests a violent mobilization of the body’s proteins.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} the isolation from reduced collagen {{of two new}} amino acids believed to be involved, in their non-reduced form, as intermolecular cross-links stabilizing the collagen fibre. The reduction of intact collagen fibrils with tritiated sodium borohydride was found to stabilize the aldehyde-mediated cross-links to acid hydrolysis and thus allowed their location and isolation from acid hydrolysates on an automatic <b>amino</b> <b>acid</b> <b>analyser.</b> Comparison of the radioactive elution patterns from the autoanalyser of collagen treated in various ways before reduction permitted a preliminary classification of the peaks into cross-link precursors, intramolecular and intermolecular cross-links. The techniques employed to isolate the purified components {{on a large scale}} and to identify them structurally are described in detail. Two labile intermolecular cross-links were isolated in their reduced forms, one of which was identified by high-resolution mass spectrometry as N∈-(5 -amino- 5 -carboxypentyl) hydroxylysine. The structure of this compound was confirmed by chemical synthesis. The cross-link precursor α-aminoadipic δ-semialdehyde was isolated in its reduced form, ∈-hydroxynorleucine, together with its acid degradation product ∈-chloronorleucine. A relatively stable intermolecular cross-link was isolated and partially characterized by mass spectrometry as an aldol resulting from the reaction of the δ-semialdehyde derived from lysine and hydroxylysine...|$|E
40|$|The {{accumulation}} {{and behavior}} of various <b>amino</b> <b>acids</b> in the pool of Pseudomonas aeruginosa (ATCC 9027) were investigated. Patterns of pool formation and maintenance varied with different <b>amino</b> <b>acids</b> tested and were dependent, to a considerable extent, upon {{the ability of the}} organism to catabolize the particular <b>amino</b> <b>acid.</b> The establishment of steady-state <b>amino</b> <b>acid</b> pool levels depended upon the activity of the <b>amino</b> <b>acid</b> permease involved and upon the rate of protein synthesis. The presence of a relatively large specific <b>amino</b> <b>acid</b> pool did not affect the formation of a pool of a structurally different <b>amino</b> <b>acid,</b> and a preformed steady-state pool was not displaced by structurally unrelated <b>amino</b> <b>acids.</b> Steady-state <b>amino</b> <b>acid</b> pools decreased rapidly in the presence of inhibitors of energy metabolism and at 0 C. Steady-state internal <b>amino</b> <b>acid</b> pools were found to be in equilibrium with the corresponding external <b>amino</b> <b>acid,</b> present at low levels. A multiplicity of proline pools was demonstrated...|$|R

5|$|Organisms vary {{in their}} ability to {{synthesize}} the 20 common <b>amino</b> <b>acids.</b> Most bacteria and plants can synthesize all twenty, but mammals can only synthesize eleven nonessential <b>amino</b> <b>acids,</b> so nine essential <b>amino</b> <b>acids</b> must be obtained from food. Some simple parasites, such as the bacteria Mycoplasma pneumoniae, lack all <b>amino</b> <b>acid</b> synthesis and take their <b>amino</b> <b>acids</b> directly from their hosts. All <b>amino</b> <b>acids</b> are synthesized from intermediates in glycolysis, the citric acid cycle, or the pentose phosphate pathway. Nitrogen is provided by glutamate and glutamine. <b>Amino</b> <b>acid</b> synthesis depends on the formation of the appropriate alpha-keto acid, which is then transaminated to form an <b>amino</b> <b>acid.</b>|$|R
