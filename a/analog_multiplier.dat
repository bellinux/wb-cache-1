40|$|Using memristive {{properties}} {{common for}} the titanium dioxide thin film devices, we designed a simple write algorithm to tune device conductance {{at a specific}} bias point to 1 % relative accuracy (which is roughly equivalent to 7 -bit precision) within its dynamic range even {{in the presence of}} large variations in switching behavior. The high precision state is nonvolatile and the results are likely to be sustained for nanoscale memristive devices because of the inherent filamentary nature of the resistive switching. The proposed functionality of memristive devices is especially attractive for analog computing with low precision data. As one representative example we demonstrate hybrid circuitry consisting of CMOS summing amplifier and two memristive devices to perform <b>analog</b> <b>multiply</b> and accumulate computation, which is a typical bottleneck operation in information processing.

40|$|Abstract—This paper {{demonstrates}} a computational image sensor capable of implementing compressive sensing operations.

We implement compressive imaging on the sensor by using pseudo-random vectors called noiselets for the measurement basis. This choice allows us to reconstruct the image from {{only a small percentage of}} the transform coefficients.

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{the application of}} a computational image sensor, capable of performing separable 2 -D transforms on images in the analog domain, to compressive sensing. Instead of sensing and transmitting raw pixel data, this image sensor first projects the image onto a separable 2 -D basis set. The inner products computed in these projections are computed in the analog domain using a computational focal-plane and a computational <b>analog</b> vector-matrix <b>multiplier.</b> Since this operation is performed in the analog domain, components such as the analog-to-digital converters can be taxed less when a only subset of correlations are performed. Compressed sensing theory prescribes the use of a pseudo-random, incomplete basis set, allowing for sampling at less than the Nyquist rate. This can reduce power consumption or increase frame rate.

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThe {{purpose of this}} project was the design, construction and testing of a fiber optic communication link for the simultaneous transmission of five audio signals using the technique of frequency division multiplexing. The five subcarrier frequencies were between 1 and 10 MHz. Amplitude modulation with two sidebands and suppressed carrier using an <b>analog</b> voltage <b>multiplier</b> (AD 834) was chosen for efficient transmission through the fiber. The unwanted image signals and intermodulation products from the mixing operation were removed using active bandpass filters. An interesting result was the successful design and operation of active filters at the high frequencies using the Generalized Immitance Converter (GIC) configuration.
