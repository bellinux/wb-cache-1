5|$|In Ardis, Maryland, a {{high-speed}} police chase unfolds at a waterfront. The {{driver of the}} car, Dr. William Secare, is cornered by officers but fights them off with surprising ease. Secare is shot <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>runs</b> up a gangplank and leaps off a ship into the water. The police fail to locate him but discover that his blood is green.|$|E
5|$|Asylum {{digitally}} created {{weapons for}} various scenes. In {{the scene in}} which Nolan is killed suddenly by {{a shot in the}} head from Jason's arrow, Asylum created the arrow in post-production. Another scene involved Jason hurling a hatchet at Lawrence <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>runs</b> away, striking him in the back. The shot of a hatchet flying through the airin one instance appearing in the same frame as the actorwould be too difficult to achieve practically. Asylum rendered a complete 3D model of the hatchet then inserted the model into the frames leading up to the frame in which it hits the character in the back. One of the final images added by Asylum was for Trent's death scene. Here, Asylum digitally created a metal spike that bursts through Trent's chest as Jason slams him onto the back of a tow truck.|$|E
25|$|A {{drawing in}} Return of the Bunny Suicides {{features}} the Fourth Doctor escaping a Dalek <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>runs</b> into the TARDIS. On {{top of the}} TARDIS is a bunny with a slipknot tied round its neck in order to hang itself once the TARDIS has dematerialized.|$|E

25|$|A chip kick {{can be used}} to put {{the ball}} behind the {{defensive}} line so that either the kicker himself or a teammate can chase or regather it. Sometimes the kicker himself will attempt to regather after an extremely short chip kick over or past the defenders whilst running towards them. Upon kicking, a player is deemed to have relinquished possession of the ball and thus may not be tackled or interfered with by the defence. The kicker's already-existing momentum <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>runs</b> towards the opposition's in goal area gives him an advantage over defenders who must turn and chase. However this chip and regather is risky as it is difficult to perform successfully and good defending fullbacks will usually be lurking behind the defensive line, waiting for just this type of kick.|$|E
500|$|The {{scene where}} Cruise enters the closet is {{referenced}} in the South Park {{segment of the}} opening of the 58th Primetime Emmy Awards on August 27, 2006, in which Conan O'Brien is {{trying to get to the}} show, but suddenly appears in Stan's room in an animated form. Stan begins yelling at him <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>runs</b> into the nearby closet. Immediately following the entrance, he exits the closet and says, [...] "There's someone else in there", referring to Cruise, and leaves the door open. Cruise then pops out and closes the door.|$|E
500|$|Braid {{is played}} by solving {{physical}} puzzles in a standard platform game environment. The player controls the protagonist Tim <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>runs,</b> jumps, and climbs across the game's levels. Tim jumps and stomps on enemies to defeat them, and can collect keys to unlock doors or operate levers to trigger platforms. A defining game element is the player's unlimited ability to reverse time and [...] "rewind" [...] actions, even after dying. The game is divided into six worlds, which are experienced sequentially and can be entered from different rooms of Tim's house; the player can return to any world previously visited to attempt to solve puzzles they missed.|$|E

25|$|John 'Jackie' Duddy, age 17. Shot <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>ran</b> {{away from}} {{soldiers}} in the car park of Rossville Flats. The bullet struck him in the shoulder and entered his chest. Three witnesses said they saw a soldier take deliberate aim at the youth <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>ran.</b> <b>He</b> was the first fatality on Bloody Sunday. Like Saville, Widgery also concluded that Duddy was unarmed. His nephew is boxer John Duddy.|$|R
60|$|Then, for my sake, <b>he</b> <b>ran.</b> How noble <b>he</b> looked <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>ran.</b> Brave heart! <b>he</b> {{dared not}} stay and risk the {{outburst}} of his anger.|$|R
500|$|Amir tells Sohrab of {{his plans}} {{to take him back}} to America and {{possibly}} adopt him. However, American authorities demand evidence of Sohrab's orphan status. Amir tells Sohrab that he may {{have to go back to}} the orphanage for a little while as they encounter a problem in the adoption process, and Sohrab, terrified about returning to the orphanage, attempts suicide. Amir eventually manages to take him back to the United States. After his adoption, Sohrab refuses to interact with Amir or Soraya until the former reminisces about Hassan and kites and shows off some of Hassan's tricks. In the end, Sohrab only gives a lopsided smile, but Amir takes it with all his heart <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>runs</b> the kite for Sohrab, saying, [...] "For you, a thousand times over." ...|$|E
500|$|Behind {{the goal}} {{at the north}} end of Goodison Park, the Gwladys Street Stand is divided into Upper Gwladys and Lower Gwladys. This stand is the [...] "Popular End", holding the most boisterous and vociferous home supporters. It is known colloquially as [...] "The Street End". If Everton win the toss before {{kick-off}} the captain traditionally elects to play towards the Gwladys Street End in the second half. One of the traditions of the stand is also to applaud the visiting goalkeeper <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>runs</b> out to the goal of the stand. The stand has a capacity of 10,611 and gives its name to Gwladys Street's Hall of Fame. On the 12th July 2016 it was announced that the Gwladys Street End would be renamed the Howard Kendall Gwladys Street End, in honour of Everton's most successful manager, Howard Kendall.|$|E
500|$|The {{television}} advert for Homme by David Beckham, {{which was}} directed by Anthony Mandler, opens to see Beckham [...] "showing off his physical prowess" [...] <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>runs</b> topless along a platform. As he reaches {{the edge of the}} platform, Beckham dives into a vat of the fragrance. In the next scene he is fully dressed in one of his trademark tailored suits. Beckham appeared in a sketch on The Ellen DeGeneres Show to promote the fragrance. In the sketch he is [...] "almost unrecognisable" [...] as he stood in the cosmetics aisle at a Target store, offering passing customers a sample spray of the scent. Homme by David Beckham was included in Esquires list of the best colognes for men in 2011. Digital Spy included the fragrance in their 2012 Christmas gift guide, commenting that: [...] "The man in your life may not look like Mr Beckham– but at least he can smell like him".|$|E

After Sandy reads it, she and Patrick show remorse.|$|E
500|$|The book {{is divided}} into five chapters. Each chapter {{is divided into}} five parts, each {{describing}} events {{from the perspective of}} one of the five main characters: Karen, Rick, Luke, Rachel, and Player One. The first chapter, [...] "Hour One: Cue the Flaming Zeppelin", has Karen arriving at the Toronto airport on a flight from Winnipeg to meet a man she met online. She sits on a stool at the airport hotel bar in which Rick is the bartender, Rachel is at a computer terminal, and Luke is sitting at a table drinking scotch. Rachel is there with the expectation to meet a man who can father her child and approaches Luke. Karen's date goes badly as she finds the man too assertive physically and too distant intellectually. A self-help guru, Leslie Freemont, enters with his assistant Tara to welcome Rick into his empowerment program; Leslie gives a speech to the group, takes Rick's money, and leaves. Meanwhile, oil prices rapidly increase and explosions start to occur outside. With the power unreliable, Karen, Rick, Luke, and Rachel run to Rick's vehicle to listen to the radio. Karen's date, Warren, is killed by a sniper <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>runs</b> to the group, who quickly return to the bar lounge where they barricade themselves in.|$|E
500|$|Steins;Gate: Hen'i Kuukan no Octet is a non-canon {{extension}} of the True End of the original game. Unlike the modern visual novel format of the original game, this retro game mimics the style of graphical text adventure games from the 8-bit PC era (e.g. PC-88), with the player typing short commands to interact with and explore the game world. It features all backgrounds and characters drawn in a low-color pixelated style with emulated scanlines, and chiptune music played through an emulated FM chip with no voice acting. The premise of the game features Rintarō Okabe receiving a D-Mail from himself in 2025 that states that he must save the future by reclaiming an IBN 5100 from a person under of the alias [...] "Neidhardt". This person is Takumi Nishijō of Chaos;Head, <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>runs</b> under the same player name in his favorite MMORPG, and the D-Mail stating that [...] "Neidhardt" [...] lives in Shibuya and has [...] "inherent, supernatural abilities", a reference to his power as a gigalomaniac. Although non-canon, the game contains many easter eggs and references that connect Chaos;Head and Steins;Gate together. The game was released on October 28, 2011 as a PC exclusive. A game demo is currently available. An official manga adaptation of the game's story has also been released.|$|E

[...] Like the other candidates, he has experience with the farming industry, <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>runs</b> an agricultural consulting business specializing in dairy. [...] One of his specific environmental concerns is thermal pollution from electric power generation. [...] Lampman resides outside of Calmar.|$|E
2500|$|The {{audio quality}} earned an almost full mark, where the [...] "24-bit 48 kHz {{lossless}} PCM serves voices well, and excels in more treble-prone sounds... Perhaps the most audibly dynamic sequence is the dawn chase scene after Moss returns with water. Close {{your eyes and}} listen to Moss's breathing and footsteps <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>runs,</b> the truck in pursuit as it labors over rocks and shrubs, {{the crack of the}} rifle and hissing of bullets as they rip through the air and hit the ground... the entire sequence and the film overall sounds very convincing." ...|$|E
2500|$|Some photographers {{have found}} {{creative}} ways around these limitations. Louie Liotta of The New York Post told John Tierney {{he holds his}} camera near the ground, pointing upward, and walks with it for a short distance, {{in order to get}} a shot of the defendant's face as he or she is ducking downwards to avoid the cameras. Andrew Savulich of the Daily News looks for unusual angles and juxtapositions, once putting the station house's sleeping cat in the foreground. To catch the defendant's face, he stands near the front door at the top of the steps. [...] "For some reason, even when a guy has decided to duck his head, he usually lifts it for a second when he starts to go down steps", he explains. [...] "You sometimes catch this lost-in-space look, the eyes fixed at a distance, as if he's trying very hard to be somewhere else." [...] Jim Estrin of the Times says the police officers at the door sometimes block that shot for him, so he starts in the middle, shooting <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>runs,</b> and then gets on the other side of the police car for a shot as the defendant enters.|$|E

2500|$|As with {{previous}} Sega Genesis Sonic games, Sonic 3D Blast includes [...] "special stages", {{in which the}} player collects Chaos Emeralds. Obtaining all seven Emeralds allows the player to play the final boss battle and discover the true ending of the game. To access these stages, the player must find one of Sonic's friends (either Tails or Knuckles the Echidna) hidden within a level, and stand next to them with at least 50 rings collected. Doing so allows the player to exchange the rings {{in order for the}} chance to play the game's special stage. These levels follow the same basic premise as Sonic the Hedgehog 2s special stages; the camera shifts to behind Sonic <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>runs</b> down a preset path and must collect rings while avoiding obstacles that, when run into, make him lose rings. A certain number of rings need to be obtained at certain checkpoints to continue through the stage, and ultimately {{be able to make it}} to the end in order to receive a Chaos Emerald. If all seven Chaos Emeralds are collected, the Special Stages can still be played for extra lives. Collecting all seven Chaos Emeralds is the only way to reach the [...] "Final Fight" [...] level, consisting of the final boss fight and the good ending of the game.|$|E
