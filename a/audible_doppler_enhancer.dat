40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{determine}} {{the accuracy of}} audible arterial foot signals with an <b>audible</b> handheld <b>Doppler</b> ultrasound for identification of significant peripheral arterial disease as a simple, quick, and readily available bedside screening tool. METHODS: Two hundred consecutive patients referred to an interprofessional wound care clinic underwent <b>audible</b> handheld <b>Doppler</b> ultrasound of both legs. As a control and comparator, a formal bilateral lower leg vascular study including the calculation of Ankle Brachial Pressure Index and toe pressure (TP) was performed at the vascular lab.

Medium pulse repetition frequency (PRF) reflected microwave signals fall between 1,500 and 15,000 cycle per second, which is audible. This means a helicopter sounds like a helicopter, a jet sounds like a jet, and propeller aircraft sound like propellers. Aircraft with no moving parts produce a tone. The actual size of the target can be calculated using the audible signal.|$|R
30|$|The {{effect of}} the {{temporary}} artery uterine clamp was first demonstrated in our institution in 2004, when a 43 -year-old woman with menorrhagia, dysmenorrhea and pelvic pain of several years’ duration with a uterus enlarged by fibroids {{to the size of}} a 16 -week pregnancy was treated [43]. Her uterine arteries were non-invasively identified transvaginally and occluded for 6  h with a clamp that was guided by <b>audible</b> <b>Doppler</b> ultrasound. Following removal of the clamp, blood flow in the uterine arteries returned immediately. Three months after treatment, the uterine volume had decreased by 49 % and the dominant fibroid volume by 54 %. Even though fibroid-related symptoms may effectively be relieved by interference with the blood supply to the uterus, there seems to be no substantial effect in patients with dysfunctional bleeding.|$|R
30|$|Through either voice {{commands}} or a toolbar button, {{the user}} interface permits switching between translation and rotation modes. In {{both cases the}} HoloLens ‘air-tap and hold’ gesture {{was used as a}} source of 3 D motion input. Having been employed successfully in other image guidance applications [20], the ‘rolling ball’ control mechanism [21] was adopted as it provides a very intuitive way of manipulating orientation that is independent of observer viewpoint. The spatial scale information embedded in each CTA scan was retained throughout the segmentation and object building process, so that no scale adjustments were required following HoloLens model import. The required procedural changes were minimal. Having annotated the skin with a sterile marker pen under HoloLens guidance, the target positions were compared to the sites of the perforator vessels as subsequently identified by <b>audible</b> <b>Doppler</b> ultrasound and surgical appearances.|$|R
40|$|Twenty-two {{patients}} with a median age of 79 years had 24 amputations about knee joint level. The patients were randomised to undergo either Gritti-Stokes or through-knee amputations. In two-thirds of limbs transcutaneous oxygen was less than 4. 65 KPa (35 mmHg) or there were no <b>audible</b> <b>Doppler</b> signals at the ankle, indicating that a below-knee amputation {{would have been at}} risk of failing to heal, and in the remainder an amputation at the knee joint was considered the preferable site for a variety of reasons. Nine of 12 (75 %) Gritti-Stokes amputations underwent uncomplicated primary healing compared with only 2 of 12 (17 %) through-knee procedures (P = 0. 04). Two through-knee amputations required revision to above the knee (17 %) while all Gritti-Stokes amputations healed. Three patients in each group became mobile on a prosthesis, the remainder being bilateral amputees or unable to manage an artificial limb...|$|R
30|$|It was {{possible}} to construct valuable AR models from CTA scans of the lower leg perforators and to use these models {{in a series of}} reconstructive surgeries over six cases. The HoloLens proved to be a powerful tool that has the potential to reduce anaesthetic time and morbidity associated with surgery as well as to improve training and provide remote support for the operating surgeon. Detailed feedback from the surgical team verified that this new approach is more reliable and therefore considerably less time-consuming than <b>audible</b> <b>Doppler</b> ultrasound, the prevailing standard method of navigation. The specific challenges addressed in this preliminary report include the provision of a practical user interface for spatial model manipulation, streamlining of the data preparation pipeline for high-resolution volumes and the export of reference coordinates for arrow localisation. One limitation is that presently a technical assistant is required initially to help with preoperative data preparation and later in the operating theatre to assist with application launch and approximate spatial model positioning before involvement of the operating surgeon.|$|R
30|$|Precision and {{planning}} {{are key to}} reconstructive surgery. Augmented reality (AR) can bring the information within preoperative computed tomography angiography (CTA) imaging to life, allowing the surgeon to ‘see through’ the patient’s skin and appreciate the underlying anatomy without making a single incision. This work has demonstrated that AR can assist the accurate identification, dissection and execution of vascular pedunculated flaps during reconstructive surgery. Separate volumes of osseous, vascular, skin, soft tissue structures and relevant vascular perforators were delineated from preoperative CTA scans to generate three-dimensional images using two complementary segmentation software packages. These were converted to polygonal models and rendered {{by means of a}} custom application within the HoloLens™ stereo head-mounted display. Intraoperatively, the models were registered manually to their respective subjects by the operating surgeon using a combination of tracked hand gestures and voice commands; AR was used to aid navigation and accurate dissection. Identification of the subsurface location of vascular perforators through AR overlay was compared to the positions obtained by <b>audible</b> <b>Doppler</b> ultrasound. Through a preliminary HoloLens-assisted case series, the operating surgeon was able to demonstrate precise and efficient localisation of perforating vessels.|$|R
40|$|Impotence is {{a common}} problem that has great impact {{on the quality of}} life. Clinical {{evaluation}} usually can exclude endocrinologic imbalance, neurogenic dysfunction, and psychological problems as the etiology. A patient who fails to get an erection after vasoactive medications which are injected probably, has hemodynamic impotence. Dynamic studies that include imaging techniques are now available to discriminate between arterial and venous pathology. Doppler ultrasound with color flow and spectral analysis,dynamic infusion corpus cavernosometry and cavernosography, and selective internal pudendal arteriography are outpatient diagnostic procedures that will differentiate, image and quantify the abnormalities in patients with hemodynamic impotence. Not all tests are needed in every patient. Each of these examinations is preceded with the intracavernosal injection of vasoactive medication. Papaverine hydrochloride, phentolamine mesylate, or prostaglandin El will overcome normal sympathetic tone and produce an erection by smooth muscle relaxation and arterial dilatation in a normal patient. Color-flow Doppler and spectral analysis will showthe cavernosal arteries and can identify the hemodynamic effects of stricture or occlusion. Peak systolic velocity is measured. Normal ranges are well established. Spectral analysis also is used to predict the presence of venous disease. Sizable venous leaks in the dorsal penile vein are readily imaged. While the technique may not adequately identify low-grade venous pathology, it will identify the size and location of fibrous plaque formation associated with Peyronie's disease. Cavernosography or cavernosometry is a separate procedure that will quantitate the severity of venousincompetence as well as specifically identify the various avenues of systemic venous return that must be localized if venous occlusive therapy is chosen. In this study, the peak arterial systolic occlusion pressure is quantified during erection,and the presence of arterial pathology can be confirmed. The arterial data are not as reliable as the ultrasound-obtained data because they rely on <b>audible</b> <b>Doppler,</b> which can be obscured in the underlying "noise" heard with erection. The arterial data obtained with both of these examinations are quantitative and replace the qualitative <b>audible</b> <b>Doppler</b> used previously. Specialized equipment allows dynamic data acquisition, ensuring that the needed information is obtained at peak stimulation. Arteriography is done only if reconstructive surgery is contemplated. The examination includes subselective catheterization of the internal pudendal arteries, magnification technique, and evaluation of the recurrent epigastric arteries, which will be harvested for revascularization. An arterial operation is usually successful in younger patients with perineal trauma with a single point of stenosis or occlusion but has been least successful in those patients with atherosclerosis because of the multifocal nature of this disease. Diagnostic information available today is more specific and reliable {{than at any time in}} the past and can realistically estimate the severity of the hemodynamic disorder and allow individual treatment options. Ongoing studies will show whether the data these studies provide make an important difference in the treatment of vascular impotence...|$|R
30|$|Air-filled agents, named first-generation {{contrast}} agents (for example, SHU 508, Levovist®), can be {{used with}} high mechanical index intermittent. The microbubbles can be disrupted, releasing a strong, but transient irregular harmonic signal that increases the Doppler signal intensity on colour Doppler sonography. Indeed, such contrast agents are not true contrast agents but rather vascular <b>Doppler</b> signal <b>enhancers.</b> Rupture of the microbubbles due to high pressure is a significant limitation for real-time imaging, so currently these contrast agents are not used in clinical practice.|$|R
40|$|AbstractObjective: Radial artery {{harvesting}} for {{coronary artery}} bypass may lead to digit ischemia if collateral hand circulation is inadequate. The modified Allen's test {{is the most common}} preoperative screening test used. Unfortunately, this test has high false-positive and false-negative rates. The {{purpose of this study was}} to compare the results of a modified Allen's test with digit pressure change during radial artery compression for assessing collateral circulation before radial artery harvest. Methods: One hundred twenty-nine consecutive patients were studied before {{coronary artery bypass}} operations. A modified Allen's test was performed with Doppler ultrasound to assess blood flow in the superficial palmar arch before and during radial artery compression. A decreased <b>audible</b> <b>Doppler</b> signal after radial artery compression was considered a positive modified Allen's test. First and second digit pressures were measured before and during radial artery compression. A decrease in digit pressure of 40 mm Hg or more (digit ΔP) with radial artery compression was considered positive. Results: Seven of 14 dominant extremities (50 %) and 8 of the 16 nondominant extremities (50 %) with a positive modified Allen's test had a digit ΔP of less than 40 mm Hg (false positive). Sixteen of 115 dominant extremities (14 %) and 5 of 112 nondominant extremities (4 %) with a negative Allen's test had a digit ΔP of 40 mm Hg or more with radial artery compression (false negative). Conclusion: Use of the modified Allen's test for screening before radial artery harvest may unnecessarily exclude some patients from use of this conduit and may also place a number of patients at risk for digit ischemia from such harvest. Direct digit pressure measurement is a simple, objective method that may more precisely select patients for radial artery harvest. Additional studies are needed to define objective digital pressure criteria that will accurately predict patients at risk for hand ischemia after radial harvest.

40|$|AbstractContrast-enhanced {{endoscopic}} ultrasound (CE-EUS) represents {{a new technique}} {{that can be used}} in conjunction with radial or linear EUS scopes, coupled with the corresponding ultrasound system. The technique is based on a second-generation blood-pool ultrasound contrast agent injected through a peripheral vein, which subsequently can be visualized through the microcirculation in the early arterial and late venous phase, especially when used with contrast harmonic imaging techniques (low mechanical index techniques). Contrast agents can be used as a <b>Doppler</b> signal <b>enhancer</b> (high mechanical index techniques), although this technique is particularly prone to artifacts. Both techniques can be used in conjunction with 3 D acquisition modes, in order to quantify the vascularity of tumors or to better delineate the relationship with surrounding vessels. The CE-EUS techniques have been used mostly for pancreatic examinations, i. e., for the differential diagnosis of focal pancreatic masses. Thus, pancreatic adenocarcinoma has a hypovascular (hypoenhanced) appearance, whereas neuroendocrine tumors are usually hypervascular (hyperenhanced). Also, pseudotumoral chronic pancreatitis and autoimmune pancreatitis have an iso- or hypervascular appearance. All these techniques are described in the present article, with emphasis on the examination modes and technical details. This article is part of an expert video encyclopedia...|$|R
40|$|AbstractObjectives. The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to evaluate the effect of a transpulmonary contrast agent on Doppler flow signals in the left heart chambers. Background. Echo contrast agents are good ultrasound reflectors and could be used as <b>Doppler</b> signal <b>enhancers.</b> Sonicated albumin microbubbles are transpulmonary echo contrast agents and could enhance left heart Doppler signals after peripheral venous injection. Methods. Thirty-one patients with various heart diseases without intracardiac shunts were assessed with Doppler echocardiography before and after injection of sonicated albumin. Results. After an intravenous injection, pulsed Doppler signals of transmitral flow became more intense in all 16 patients examined, although flow velocity itself was not changed. In Doppler color flow imaging, the maximal mitral regurgitant signal area increased from 312 ± 405 mm 2 to 434 ± 465 mm 2, an average increase of 59 ± 40 % in all 17 patients with mitral regurgitation (p < 0. 01). These effects were considered to be due to improvement of signal to noise ratio by the enhancement of Doppler flow signals. The duration of enhancement of pulsed Doppler transmitral flow signals was significantly longer than that of the left ventricular echocardiographic opacification (44 ± 11 s vs. 17 ± 7 s, p < 0. 01). Conclusions. Intravenous injection of sonicated albumin can enhance the Doppler flow signals in the left heart chambers. This effect may be useful to improve the sensitivity of the Doppler system for detecting abnormalities of left heart blood flow such as mitral regurgitation...|$|R
40|$|AbstractPurpose: Carotid endarterectomy (CEA) {{performed}} with continuous transcranial Doppler monitoring provides {{a unique opportunity}} to determine the number of cerebral microemboli and to relate their occurrence to the surgical technique. The {{purpose of this study was}} to assess in CEA the impact of cerebral microembolism on clinical outcome and brain architecture. We also evaluated the influence of the <b>audible</b> transcranial <b>Doppler</b> signal on the surgeon and his or her technique. Methods: In a prospective series of 301 patients, CEA was monitored with electroencephalography and transcranial Doppler ultrasonography of the ipsilateral middle cerebral artery. Preoperative and intraoperative risk factors were entered in a logistic regression analysis program to assess their correlation with cerebral outcome. To evaluate the impact of cerebral microembolism on brain architecture, we compared preoperative and postoperative computed tomography scans or magnetic resonance images of the brain in two subgroups of 58 and 40 patients, respectively. Results: Seven (2. 3 %) patients had intraoperative transient ischemic symptoms, three (1 %) had intraoperative strokes, 1 (0. 3 %) had transient ischemic symptoms after operation, and 10 (3. 3 %) had postoperative strokes. Four (1. 3 %) patients died. Microemboli (> 10) noticed during dissection were related to both intraoperative (p 10 microemboli) during dissection shows a statistically significant relationship with perioperative cerebral complications and with new ischemic lesions on magnetic resonance images of the brain. Moreover, microembolism during shunting is also related to intraoperative complications. Surgeons can be guided by the audio Doppler and emboli signals by changing their technique. This change may result in a decrease of microembolism and consequently in a decline of the intraoperative stroke rate. (J VASC SURG 1995; 21 : 963 - 9. ...|$|R
40|$|AbstractPurpose:Although the {{technical}} feasibility of pedal artery bypass for limb salvage is now well established, questions remain about its most appropriate use and its long-term durability. Methods:We reviewed our experience over an 8 -year period in 367 consecutive patients undergoing 384 vein bypass grafts to the dorsalis pedis for limb salvage. Results:Ninety-five {{percent of the}} patients had diabetes mellitus. Infection complicated ischemia at initial presentation in 55. 2 % of patients. The preoperative arteriogram demonstrated a patent dorsalis pedis in 362 extremities (92. 8 %). Four hundred two patients underwent exploration for bypass, including 29 patients without demonstrated arteries on the arteriogram but <b>audible</b> pedal <b>Doppler</b> signals. Successful bypasses were carried out in 357 of 362 cases, where preoperative arteriography demonstrated a patent dorsalis pedis artery (98. 6 %), 16 of 28 cases explored {{on the basis of a}} Doppler signal alone (57 %), and 11 of 12 patients where angiographic status was unknown. All procedures were performed with vein: in situ 38. 5 %, reversed 29 %, onreversed 18 %, arm vein 7 %, and composite vein 8 %. Inflow was taken from the common femoral artery in 34 %, superficial femoral or popliteal arteries in 60 %, a previously placed graft in 5 %, and a tibial artery in 1 %. There were seven erioperative deaths (1. 8 %) and 21 myocardial infarctions (5. 4 %). Twenty-nine grafts failed within 30 days (7. 5 %), but 19 were successfully revised. Eight of the 10 failed grafts resulted in major amputation (80 %). Over the remaining study period, there were 39 additional graft failures, of which 17 were successfully revised, and 17 additional major amputations. Actuarial primary and secondary patency and limb salvage rates were 68 %, 82 %, and 87 %, respectively, at 5 years' followup. The actuarial patient survival rate was 57 % at 5 years. Patency rates were similar for in situ and translocated saphenous vein grafts. Conclusions:Dorsalis pedis arterial bypass is an effective limb salvage procedure with long-term durability comparable to distal vein grafts placed into more proximal arteries.

40|$|Pulsed Doppler {{echocardiography}} {{was used}} to determine prospectively the prevalence of mitral, aortic, tricuspid and pulmonary regurgitation in 80 consecutive patients with mitral valve prolapse and 85 normal subjects with similar age and sex distribution. Mitral valve prolapse was defined by posterior systolic displacement of the mitral valve on M-mode echocardiography of 3 mm or more (40 patients), the presence of one or more mid- or late systolic clicks (61 patients), or both. Mitral regurgitation, detected by pulsed Doppler techniques in 53 patients with prolapse, was holosystolic in 24, early to mid-systolic in 6, late systolic in 15 and both holosystolic and late systolic behind different portions of the valve in 8. Definitive M-mode findings were present in only 27 of the 53 patients, and only 21 had mitral regurgitation audible on physical examination. Tricuspid regurgitation was evident by pulsed Doppler echocardiography in 15 patients (holosystolic in 9, early to mid-systolic in 1, late systolic in 4 and both holosystolic and late systolic in 1); 12 of these 15 patients, including all with an isolated late systolic pattern, had an echocardiographic pattern of tricuspid prolapse, but none had audible tricuspid regurgitation. A Doppler pattern compatible with aortic regurgitation was recorded in seven patients, all without echocardiographic aortic valve prolapse and only two with audible aortic insufficiency. A Doppler shift in the right ventricular outflow tract in diastole, suggestive of pulmonary regurgitation, was recorded in 16 of the 78 patients with an adequate Doppler examination; only 1 of the 16 had audible pulmonary insufficiency. Of the 85 normal subjects without <b>audible</b> regurgitation, pulsed <b>Doppler</b> examination detected mitral regurgitation in 3 subjects (holosystolic in 1 and early to mid-systolic in 2), aortic regurgitation in none, tricuspid regurgitation in 9 (holosystolic alone in 8 and both holosystolic and late systolic in 1) and right ventricular outflow tract turbulence compatible with pulmonary insufficiency in 15. The prevalence of valvular regurgitation, detected by pulsed Doppler echocardiography, is high in patients with mitral valve prolapse. Regurgitation may involve any of the four cardiac valves and is clinically silent in the majority of patients. The prevalence rates of mitral and aortic regurgitation are significantly higher in patients with mitral prolapse than in normal subjects, suggesting that alterations in underlying valve structure in the prolapse syndrome may indeed be responsible for this regurgitation. While tricuspid regurgitation is more frequent in patients with prolapse (19 %) than in normal control subjects (11 %), this difference is not statistically significant. A Doppler signal of isolated late systolic tricuspid regurgitation, however, was detected only in patients with mitral valve prolapse who had echocardiographic signs of tricuspid valve prolapse. The prevalence of Doppler signals compatible with pulmonary regurgitation did not differ in patients with prolapse and normal subjects...|$|R
