40|$|The {{main goal}} {{of this paper is}} to analyse whether the fiscal policy of the Czech Republic is <b>anti-cyclical.</b> This {{analysis}} is carried out through decomposing the government’s balance into its cyclical and structural part. The first differences of the structural part are then put in relation to the output gap to determine whether the fiscal policy is pro- or <b>anti-cyclical.</b> Moreover, the correlation of government expenditures and revenues with the business cycle is also subject of our analysis. We also examine whether the fiscal rules which the Czech Republic would have to adhere to once it enters the euro area limit fiscal policy as a stabilizing mechanism. The paper concludes that the fiscal policy in the Czech Republic was for the most part rather of a random character than <b>anti-cyclical</b> during the examined period 1998 – 2013. This conclusion has two implications. Firstly, there is still room for improvement in fully and consistently utilizing fiscal policy to stabilise the Czech economy throughout economic cycles. Secondly, fiscal rules would not limit the Czech government to practice <b>anti-cyclical</b> fiscal policy if they have been implemented since 1998...|$|E

40|$|Includes bibliographyThis article {{studies the}} effect of the {{stabilization}} of fiscal expenditure and the <b>anti-cyclical</b> use of taxes as stabilization variables in the Chilean economy, through the calibration of a basic macroeconomic model adapted to the actual conditions of that economy. The results show that some 25 % of the variability of economic growth could be eliminated by obviating fiscal cyclical impulses through constant growth of public investment and consumption and through <b>anti-cyclical</b> taxes. On the one hand, it is proposed that a system of stabilization of the growth of fiscal expenditure should be established, through a system of rules and degrees of flexibility subject to specific clauses. An important element in the implementation of stabilization policies is a tax revenue stabilization fund which would register and store up the counter-cyclical reactions of the fiscal authorities and make fiscal expenditure independent of the revenue obtained at any particular point in the economic cycle. On the other hand, an analysis is made of both the feasibility and the efficacy of fixing the value added tax (IVA); in a more flexible manner, as well as the problems of inconsistency over time that this would cause. For this latter reason, an analysis is also made of {{the costs and benefits of}} supplementing more flexible application of the IVA with greater flexibility as regards income tax or tax incentives for investment. It is concluded that the State has a variety of instruments that could be used to implement an <b>anti-cyclical</b> policy, such as the possibility of establishing rules for the growth of expenditure, stabilization funds, and greater flexibility of taxes...|$|E

The results of cross-wavelet analysis indicate that covariance between oil price and exchange rate {{are unable to}} give clear-cut results but both variables have been in phase and out phase (i. e. they are <b>anti-cyclical</b> and cyclical in nature) in some or other durations. However, results of squared wavelet coherence disclose that both variables are out of phase and real exchange rate was leading during the entire period studied, corresponding to the 10 ~ 15 months scale. These results are the unique contribution of the present study, which would have not been drawn if one would have utilized any other time series or frequency domain based approach. This finding provides evidence of <b>anti-cyclical</b> relationship between oil price and real effective exchange rate.

40|$|We {{formulate}} and estimate {{a simple}} fiscal policy reaction function for the euro area and individual euro area countries. Our reaction function allows for primary surpluses to feature three components: an <b>anti-cyclical</b> response of primary surpluses to the output gap, {{a response to}} the debt-GDP ratio, and an exogenous fiscal policy shifter. In line with the cyclical adjustment literature and in contrast with much of the previous time-series literature, we find a consistently strong <b>anti-cyclical</b> response of primary surpluses to the output gap for the euro area. We also find a consistently strong positive response of primary surpluses to the debt-GDP ratio. Our estimates are robust to different output gap measures and to different assumptions regarding the order of integration of observables. In addition, we provide statistical evidence in favor of our specification of a fiscal policy reaction function which features persistent fiscal policy shocks as opposed to an alternative specification found in the literature which features fiscal policy smoothing. Altogether, our results help to reconcile widely differing estimates from the literature, and we argue that our results may therefore provide guidance to forecasters and policymakers...|$|E

40|$|The {{issue of}} use of {{expansive}} fiscal instruments {{in order to encourage}} the growth has produced in the past as it does today, a significant division among economists. This division is reflected in the doctrinal and practical aspects. Doctrinal aspect touches different approaches to state interventionism. While its supporters within Keynesian teachings believe that the recession could become a permanent condition if the state does not reach for <b>anti-cyclical</b> policies, the supporters of the infallibility of the market believe that it would result in inflation without affecting growth. This paper presents, with inevitable reference to the genesis of bipolar thinking, the results of empirical studies and our own research on the value of the relevant fiscal multipliers as realistic measures of effectualization of fiscal stimulus to economic growth. Conferring a direct connection between appropriate fiscal stimulus packages with the growth of economic activity will give an answer to the issue about the effectiveness of cyclic measures. It turned out that the results are different for developed countries compared to those who belong to the group of developing countries. It has been proved that for developing countries it is much more useful to rely on public investment in relation to the growth of public spending. It should serve as a guide to the holders of economic power in composing the measures that will form the <b>anti-cyclical</b> economic policies during the current crisis...|$|E

40|$|The need to {{innovate}} rating methodologies toward an integrated approach {{is crucial in}} the Italian financial contest. Currently, the banking system and the economic actors are unable to create effective and efficient information flows {{to react to the}} crisis. Banks weakness derives from the adopted rating models, which are mainly based on credit tendencies. They produce cyclical effects on credit availability and are not able to anticipate <b>anti-cyclical</b> firms’ trends. The separation between financial and industrial analysis might be a driver of such an inefficient flow of information. The aim of the paper is to show a framework for an original rating methodology derived from the integration of industrial and financial analysis, in order to identify best performers in crisis scenarios (i. e. anti-cyclically). Industrial analysis is based on firm heterogeneity approaches to measure three dimension of analysis: innovation, internationalization and growth. Financial analysis focuses on operational return and risks measures and develops an integrated classification of firms using standardized XBRL financial data. Further integration of the two methodologies is used to create the effective set of information needed for an original rating system based on a certainty equivalent model. The case of the very competitive manufacturing firms in Vicenza was considered. Results suggest the efficacy of the proposed methodology in order to identify clusters of best performing firms in crisis scenarios, while the validation test on the post crisis timeframe, confirms the <b>anti-cyclical</b> capacity of an integrated rating methodology...|$|E

40|$|Purpose of the article: All {{national}} economies {{go through their}} economic cycle and partial sectors of these economies go through their market life cycle, too. But {{the course of the}} market life cycle doesn’t have to ever be the same {{as in the case of}} the economic cycle. So, there exist sectors with different sensitivities to economic cycle. The sector sensitivity can considerably influence many financial quantities, especially quantities describing the entrepreneurial risk, which can be expressed in form of cost of capital. The main aim of this article is to find out the structure of cost of equity, which is required in sectors with different sensitivity to the economic cycle. Methodology/methods: There are used and analyzed secondary data for periods from I. 2007 to II. 2011, gotten from materials published by the Czech Statistical Office and the Czech Ministry of Industry and Trade. The sector sensitivity is measured according to the correlation between gross domestic product (GDP), used for considering the economic cycle, and amount of sales reached on the sector, used for identifying the market life cycle. The structure of owner’s risk rewards is calculated with the use of the constructional model by the Czech Ministry of Industry and Trade. Scientific aim: There is selected one cyclical, one neutral and one <b>anti-cyclical,</b> ever with the extreme value of the coefficient of correlation. By each of these three sectors there is calculated the structure of cost of equity to know shares of partial owner’s risk rewards. Findings: Highest values of all risk rewards are reached in the <b>anti-cyclical</b> sector. On the contrary there is reached the lowest value of risk reward to the size of the company (rLA) in the cyclical sector and of the risk reward to entrepreneurial risk (rPOD) in the neutral sector. The risk reward to financial stability (rFINSTAB) and to financial structure (rFINSTRU) were required in both sectors approximately on the same level. Conclusions: From the findings there can be derived, that investments in companies acting in <b>anti-cyclical</b> sectors is the most risky. But there are some limits, that follow from used methods. There were used data, that are valid only for czech sectors and only for selected periods. And furthermore, there isn’t considered the life cycle of companies, acting in selected sectors, and their market position, derived from corporate- and market life cycle...|$|E
