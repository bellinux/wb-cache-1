We examined effects of <b>asbestos</b> (<b>chrysotile)</b> <b>fibre</b> on the proliferation of PHA-stimulated lymphocytes and the PHA binding activity of lymphocytes in vitro. The incorporation of 3 H-thymidine and the expression of interleukin- 2 receptor were depressed when the cells were exposed to 50 micrograms/ml of <b>chrysotile</b> <b>fibre.</b> The PHA binding activity of lymphocytes was significantly enhanced after <b>chrysotile</b> <b>fibre</b> exposure, as compared with non-exposed group.

40|$|Lipid peroxidation in rat liver microsomes {{induced by}} <b>asbestos</b> <b>fibres,</b> {{crocidolite}} and <b>chrysotile,</b> is greatly {{increased in the}} presence of NADPH, leading to malondialdehyde levels comparable with those induced by CCl 4, a very strong inducer of lipid peroxidation. This synergic effect only occurs during the first minutes and could be explained by an increase or a regeneration of the ferrous active sites of asbestos by NADPH, which in turn could rapidly be prevented by the adsorption of microsomal proteins {{on the surface of the}} fibres. It is not inhibited by superoxide dismutase, catalase and mannitol, indicating that oxygen radicals are not involved in the reaction. It is also not inhibited by desferrioxamine, indicating that it is not due to a release of free iron ions in solution from the fibres. Lipid peroxidation in NADPH-supplemented microsomes is also greatly increased upon addition of magnetite.

40|$|The {{modification}} of the chemistry of <b>asbestos</b> <b>chrysotile</b> <b>fibres</b> (Mg 3 (Si 2 O 5) (OH) 4) after their ingestion by cultured cells has been studied. Two types of cells involved in asbestos related pulmonary disease were used, rabbit alveolar macrophages (AM), recovered by bronchoalveolar lavage, and pleural mesothelial cells (PMC) obtained from the rat parietal pleura. Chemical characterisation of intracellular fibres was performed on unstained ultrathin sections by electron probe microanalysis. The results showed a progressive leaching of Mg, characterised by a time dependent decrease of Mg/Si. AM were more efficient than PMC at leaching intracellular <b>chrysotile</b> <b>fibres</b> since it took longer to obtain the same proportion of leached fibres with PMC than with AM.

The data show that the kinetic of leaching by AM was comparable with leaching at pH 4. The leaching by PMC was of the same order as leaching at pH 7. When membranes were adsorbed on to the fibres, a delayed leaching was observed.

One mechanism by which <b>asbestos</b> <b>fibres</b> may cause polymorphonuclear leucocytes to be attracted to the alveolar structures is by induced release of neutrophil chemotactic factor by alveolar macrophages. When exposed in vitro to short or intermediate <b>chrysotile</b> <b>fibres</b> or amosite or crocidolite fibres guinea-pig alveolar macrophages released appreciable amounts of neutrophil chemotactic factor. The release of this chemotactic factor was augmented when the <b>asbestos</b> <b>fibres</b> had been previously exposed to normal serum.

Over the last 10 years, some of these have been found and reported in a series of papers in this journal. The “missing ” data from the study were largely concerned with the potential chronic effects of short <b>fibre</b> <b>chrysotile</b> but also dealt with the alleged ability of a single, high dose exposure to long <b>fibre</b> <b>chrysotile</b> to produce a risk of disease for life (so-called “irreversibil-ity”).

40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{compare the}} {{concentrations}} of inorganic fibres in the lungs in cases of mesothelioma and controls: to determine whether concentrations of retained <b>asbestos</b> <b>fibres</b> differ with the different exposures identified from interview; and to investigate {{the existence of a}} cut off point in concentrations of <b>asbestos</b> <b>fibres</b> that indicates occupational exposure. METHODS: Case-control study; 147 confirmed cases of mesothelioma and 122 controls identified from deaths occurring in four districts of Yorkshire between 1979 and 1991. Surviving relatives were interviewed to determine lifetime exposure history to <b>asbestos.</b> Mineral <b>fibre</b> analysis was carried out on lung tissue from postmortem examinations. RESULTS: Odds on high concentrations of retained <b>asbestos</b> <b>fibres</b> were greater in cases than controls. After excluding subjects with occupational and paraoccupational exposure, the odds on high concentrations were still greater in cases than controls, but only significantly so for amphiboles. There was only a weak relation between probability of occupational exposure to asbestos and concentrations of retained <b>asbestos</b> <b>fibres,</b> and no significant difference in fibre concentrations was found between subjects who had been exposed to asbestos through different routes: these comparisons were only based on small groups. There was considerable overlap in concentrations of retained <b>asbestos</b> <b>fibres</b> between cases and controls with and without histories of occupational exposure.

Goats grazing in the contaminated areas inhale <b>asbestos</b> <b>fibres.</b> We used this natural animal model to study whether these exposures actually result in increased fibre burdens in the lungs and parietal pleura. METHODS: Ten goats from areas with asbestos outcrops and two from other areas were slaughtered. Fibre content of lung and parietal pleural samples was determined by analytical transmission electron microscopy. RESULTS: Both <b>chrysotile</b> and tremolite <b>fibres</b> were detected. In the exposed goats, the geometric mean concentrations of <b>asbestos</b> <b>fibres</b> longer than 1 microm were 0. 27 x 10 (6) fibres/g dry lung tissue and 1. 8 x 10 (6) fibres/g dry pleural tissue. <b>Asbestos</b> <b>fibres</b> were not detected in the lungs of the two control goats. <b>Chrysotile</b> <b>fibres</b> shorter than 5 microm were predominant in the parietal pleura.

40|$|The {{present study}} {{analysed}} the asbestos lung burden in necroscopic samples from 55 subjects free from asbestos-related diseases, collected between 2009 and 2011 in Milan, Italy. Multiple lung samples were analysed by light microscopy (asbestos bodies, AB) and EDXA-scanning electron microscopy (<b>asbestos</b> <b>fibres</b> and other inorganic <b>fibres).</b> <b>Asbestos</b> <b>fibres</b> were detected in 35 (63. 6 %) subjects, {{with a higher}} frequency for amphiboles than for chrysotile.

METHODS: Estimates of cumulative, mean, and peak exposures to asbestos were available for 54 workers. Necropsy records and lung tissue samples were obtained from hospital files. Matched control cases were selected from consecutive necropsies performed at the same hospitals. The extent and severity of pulmonary fibrosis was graded on tissue sections. Mineral fibres in lung tissue were characterised by transmission electron microscopy combined with x ray spectroscopy. RESULTS: A significant positive correlation (r = 0. 67, P < 0. 0001) was found between lifetime cumulative exposure to asbestos and total lung burden of <b>asbestos</b> <b>fibres.</b> This relation was also found for the individual types of asbestos associated with the exposure: chrysotile and tremolite. Pulmonary fibrosis was correlated with both cumulative exposure to asbestos (r = 0. 60, P < 0. 01) and the concentration of <b>asbestos</b> <b>fibres</b> in the lung (r = 0. 62, P < 0. 0001). The concentration of tremolite fibres in the lung provided a better estimate of lung fibrosis than did the concentration of chrysotile. Asbestosis was usually present in asbestos textile workers with more than 20 fibre-years cumulative exposure. The lengths and aspect ratios of chrysotile asbestos, but not amphibole asbestos, were greater in the lungs of <b>asbestos</b> <b>fibre</b> workers than in the control population.

Since the 1970 s, <b>asbestos</b> <b>fibres</b> have been considered carcinogenic in humans i. e as a known cancer-causing agent. In the environment, <b>asbestos</b> <b>fibres</b> are inactive and naturally resist biodegradation. In time, fibres can only be ground into smaller particles by mechanical force.

Among these are diseases with long latency periods of 10 to 40 years such as: asbestosis, mesothelioma and lung cancer. Asbestos is the generic, industrial name for a group of six minerals determined by common size and inherent physical properties. Crocidolite, amosite, anthophyllite, tremolite and actinolite are all asbestos minerals from the amphibole mineral group.

40|$|Carbon {{nanotubes}} (CNTs), {{the product}} of new technology, {{may be used in}} a wide range of applications. Because they present similarities to <b>asbestos</b> <b>fibres</b> in terms of their shape and size, it is legitimate to raise the question of their safety for human health. Recent animal and cellular studies suggest that CNTs elicit tissue and cell responses similar to those observed with <b>asbestos</b> <b>fibres,</b> which increases concern about the adverse biological effects of CNTs. While asbestos fibres' mechanisms of action are not fully understood, sufficient results are available to develop hypotheses about the significant factors underlying their damaging effects. This review will summarize the current state of knowledge about the biological effects of CNTs and will discuss to what extent they present similarities to those of <b>asbestos</b> <b>fibres.</b> Finally, the characteristics of asbestos known to be associated with toxicity will be analyzed to address the possible impact of CNTs...|$|R
50|$|Traditionally, such mats {{were made}} of asbestos, often {{reinforced}} with a metal mesh, but fiberglass or other substitutes are now used because of the toxicity of <b>asbestos</b> <b>fibres.</b>|$|R
40|$|<b>Fibre</b> {{concentrations}} of <b>asbestos</b> were {{measured in the}} air of a communal dining room in which the damaged ceiling had a sprayed on coating of insulation containing asbestos. The average concentration of crocidolite <b>asbestos</b> <b>fibres</b> was 4 f/cm 3, 20 times the highest air concentration that appears to have been reported previously for a public building. It is concluded that although air {{concentrations of}} <b>asbestos</b> <b>fibres</b> in public buildings containing asbestos insulation materials are usually low, high concentrations can occur. This may have implications for the risk of exposed persons developing diseases associated with asbestos...|$|R
50|$|Fibre cement were {{probably}} amongst the latest materials {{on the market}} to have contained large quantities of asbestos. The {{reason is that the}} <b>asbestos</b> <b>fibres</b> are intimately bound to the cement matrix and were first considered to be well immobilized in the cement and less prone to be released in the environment, suspended in the air, and inhaled in the lung than in other materials or applications such as thermal insulation or flocking in which bare <b>asbestos</b> <b>fibres</b> were used. However, <b>asbestos</b> <b>fibres</b> are inevitably released during machining operations of the objects made of fibre-cement and by long-term erosion of the materials exposed to atmospheric weathering and wind when cement degrades. Occupational health concerns and the protection of workers in the fibre-cement factories have finally led to the progressive elimination of asbestos from these products. For health reasons, it is recommended that existing fibre-cement products that are in good condition are left undisturbed and possibly encapsulated, to prevent fibre release.|$|R
