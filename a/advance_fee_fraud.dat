40|$|The paper {{seeks to}} discuss an {{overview}} on the <b>advanced</b> <b>fee</b> <b>fraud</b> offences {{as well as}} cybercrime in Nigerian. The aims of the paper focus on discussing the <b>advanced</b> <b>fee</b> <b>fraud</b> under the related provisions of <b>Advanced</b> <b>Fee</b> <b>Fraud</b> Act 2006 {{on the success of}} the law in addressing the practices of crimes in relation to information technology. The paper also discusses the cybercrimes in Nigeria with a brief look out on the Cybercrime (Prohibition and Prevention) Act 2015. Further, it also aims at examining the application of the law in the fraud offences which raises an issue of the regulatory framework of the cybercrime. The methodology adopted by the paper is doctrinal approach method wherein both primary and secondary sources of data were analysed, particularly the local laws and other relevant documents. The finding of the paper reveals that the relevant section of the in the <b>Advanced</b> <b>Fee</b> <b>Fraud</b> Act that deals with electronic communication has not been invoked. This is because the discussed relevant law under the <b>advanced</b> <b>fee</b> <b>fraud</b> did not in any away deal with cases concerning electronic communication under section 13. The paper recommends {{that there is a need}} to strengthen the adequacy of the legal framework on the Cybercrimes so as to checkmate such practices in Nigeria...|$|R

25|$|Some <b>advance</b> <b>fee</b> <b>fraud</b> scams on the Internet {{are based}} on lotteries. The fraud starts with spam congratulating the {{recipient}} on their recent lottery win.

500|$|Internationally, Nigeria is infamous for {{a form of}} bank fraud dubbed 419, a type of <b>advance</b> <b>fee</b> <b>fraud</b> (named after Section 419 of the Nigerian Penal Code) {{along with}} the [...] "Nigerian scam", a form of {{confidence}} trick practised by individuals and criminal syndicates. These scams involve a complicit Nigerian bank (the laws being set up loosely to allow it) and a scammer {{who claims to have}} money he needs to obtain from that bank. The victim is talked into exchanging bank account information on the premise that the money will be transferred to him, and then he'll get to keep a cut. In reality, money is taken out instead, and/or large fees (which seem small in comparison with the imaginary wealth he awaits) are deducted. In 2003, the Nigerian Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (or EFCC) was created, ostensibly to combat this and other forms of organised financial crime.|$|E
2500|$|Spam {{can be used}} {{to spread}} {{computer}} viruses, trojan horses or other malicious software. The objective may be identity theft, or worse (e.g., <b>advance</b> <b>fee</b> <b>fraud).</b> Some spam attempts to capitalize on human greed, while some attempts {{to take advantage of the}} victims' inexperience with computer technology to trick them (e.g., phishing). On May 31, 2007, one of the world's most prolific spammers, Robert Alan Soloway, was arrested by US authorities. Described as one of the top ten spammers in the world, Soloway was charged with 35 criminal counts, including mail fraud, wire fraud, e-mail fraud, aggravated identity theft, and money laundering. Prosecutors allege that Soloway used millions of [...] "zombie" [...] computers to distribute spam during 2003. This is the first case in which US prosecutors used identity theft laws to prosecute a spammer for taking over someone else's Internet domain name.|$|E

5000|$|Another {{variant of}} <b>advanced</b> <b>fee</b> <b>fraud</b> {{is known as}} a pigeon drop. This is a {{confidence}} trick in which the mark, or [...] "pigeon", is persuaded to give up a sum of money in order to secure the rights to a larger sum of money, or more valuable object. In reality, the scammers make off with the money and the mark is left with nothing. In the process, the stranger (actually a confidence trickster) puts his money with the mark's money (in an envelope, briefcase, or bag) which the mark is then apparently entrusted with; it is actually switched for a bag full of newspaper or other worthless material. Through various theatrics, the mark is given the opportunity to leave with the money without the stranger realising. In reality the mark would be fleeing from his own money, which the con man still has (or has handed off to an accomplice).|$|R
40|$|This paper explores {{why people}} respond to {{unsolicited}} invitations for upfront payments to secure a deferred financial benefit that later prove to be fraudulent. Fraud is Australia 2 ̆ 7 s most costly form of crime with the Australian Institute of Criminology estimating that in excess of 8. 5 b was lost to fraud in 2005 (Rollings 2008).  Consumer fraud alone {{has been found to}} cost Australians almost 1 b each yaer (ABS 2008 c).  Most types of consumer fraud entail the use of so-called 2 ̆ 7 <b>advance</b> <b>fee</b> 2 ̆ 7 techniques in which individuals are tricked into paying money - an 2 ̆ 7 <b>advance</b> <b>fee</b> 2 ̆ 7 - upfront in roder to secure an anticipated financial or other benefit at a later date.  However, the promises of wealth are false and victims invariably lose their payments in full.  Such scams had had a huge impact globally, with Ultrascan (2008) estimating that US 4. 3 b was lost to adance <b>fee</b> <b>fraud</b> in 2006.  To date, however, there has been only limited research on how and why {{people respond to}} such unsolicited invitations and become victims.
