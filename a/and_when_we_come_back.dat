6000|$|Fanny still {{keeps her}} sofa; the first enthusiasm of her affliction [...] has worn away, {{and she has}} nothing to sustain her now but {{planning}} [...] our expeditions about the city. She has got the map and the history [...] of Quebec by heart, and she holds us to the literal fulfilment of her [...] instructions. On this account, she often has to send Dick and me out [...] together when {{she would like to}} keep him with her, for she won't [...] trust either of us alone, <b>and</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>come</b> <b>back</b> she examines us [...] separately to see whether we have skipped anything. This makes us [...] faithful in the smallest things. She says she is determined that [...] Uncle Jack shall have a full and circumstantial report from me of all [...] that he wants to know about the celebrated places here, and I really [...] think he will, if I go on, or am goaded on, in this way. It's pure [...] devotion to the cause in Fanny, for you know she doesn't care for [...] such things herself, and has no pleasure in it but carrying a point. [...] Her chief consolation under her trial of keeping still is to see how [...] I look in her different dresses. She sighs over me as I appear in a [...] new garment, and says, O, if she only had the dressing of me! Then [...] she gets up and limps and hops across the room to where I stand [...] before the glass, and puts a pin here and a ribbon there, and gives [...] my hair (which she has dressed herself) a little dab, to make it lie [...] differently, and then scrambles back to her sofa, and knocks her lame [...] ankle against something, and lies there groaning and enjoying herself [...] like a martyr. On days when she thinks she is never going to get [...] well, she says she doesn't know why she doesn't give me her things at [...] once and be done with it; and on days when she thinks she is going to [...] get well right away, she says she will have me one made something [...] like whatever dress I have got on, as soon as she's home. Then up [...] she'll jump again for the exact measure, and tell me the history of [...] every stitch, and how she'll have it altered just the least grain, [...] and differently trimmed to suit my complexion better; and ends by [...] having promised to get me something not in the least like it. You [...] have some idea already of what Fanny is; and all you have got to do [...] is to multiply it by about fifty thousand. Her sprained ankle simply [...] intensifies her whole character.|$|E
5000|$|Speaking {{about the}} album's title, Puff Daddy {{said that because}} of The Notorious B.I.G.’s death on March 9, 1997, he had felt that there is 'no way out' of things the way we were. The album's lyrical content is filled {{with some of his}} {{emotions}} that he felt while mourning the loss of his close friend. In the song, titled “Is This the End?”, he raps about experiencing the drive-by shooting that happened in Los Angeles, California, which took The Notorious B.I.G.'s life. The album was originally called Puff Daddy & The Goodfellas, then slated to be titled Hell Up in Harlem, but following the death of The Notorious B.I.G., he decided to switch the album's title to No Way Out. As discussed in [...] "Unbelievable: The Life, Death, and Afterlife of The Notorious B.I.G." [...] by Cheo Hodari Coker, the weight of the East Coast/West Coast rivalry and the accompanying threats had taken its toll on Combs and those around him. It was decided that they needed to get away and become focused on making hits. So, Combs brought producers Steven [...] "Stevie J." [...] Jordan, Deric [...] "D-Dot" [...] Angelettie, Nashiem Myrick and Ron [...] "AMEN-RA" [...] Lawrence as well as engineers Axel Niehaus and Tony Maserati down to the Caribbean Sound Basin studio in Maraval, Trindad, along with everything that they needed to craft hits. In the book, Puffy is quoted as saying, [...] "For the next two years, I wanna have radio on lock. Call the girlfriend, wifey, or whatever, and let ‘em know that you’re not gonna be around for a few weeks. We’re gonna get away from all this drama, put our heads together, <b>and</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>come</b> <b>back,</b> we’re coming back with hits." [...] The material would later be used on No Way Out, Life After Death and other Bad Boy albums from 1997 to 1999.|$|E

40|$|Traffic {{issues are}} an {{important}} topic in science, not only {{because there is a}} lot of research going on, but mostly because it affects our daily life when we drive to the office <b>and</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>come</b> <b>back</b> home. In this bachelor thesis, we discuss two kinds of traffic situations: a two one-way crossroads and a roadblock. Both situations are modeled and optimized by defining and then minimizing the total waiting time. This way of traffic optimization is not always the best, especially if one thinks from the driver’s perspective. Therefore, in the second part of my work, both traffic scenarios (two one-way crossroads and a roadblock) are discussed from a very dif-ferent angle – the driver’s perspective. Obviously, now quantities like maximum capacity of a road, maximum traffic flux, minimum waiting time are less relevant. Instead, we focus on the driver’s irritation produced by the surrounding traffic. We use a discrete traffic flow model to capture the effect of the traffic lights policy on both queue lengths and on the driver’s irritation. Our simulation results recover real-life data de-scribing the traffic flow on the Leidsestraat in Hillegom, The Netherlands...|$|E
