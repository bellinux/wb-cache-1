5|$|You are right. I did {{not think}} anything. I wasn’t thinking. I was feeling and I was dying. And then I was just like, You can’t go down like this! You have to turn this into music. You have to try, <b>at</b> <b>least.</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> so embarrassed by just everything. I just didn’t {{want to be that}} person that just went down after all of that. A lot of the time in the sessions, they weren’t letting me write. They were giving me tracks and doing it all. I was like, Why am I here? Then I got the perfect {{combination}} of people to really support me and make me feel confident. It was an amazing awakening. I walked into the session and I was like, You gotta know, I don’t care about anything except the truth right here.|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} with the Sheffield University Paper in May 1965, Dylan explained the change that had occurred in his songwriting over the previous twelve months, noting [...] "The big difference is that the songs I was writing last year ... they were what I call one-dimensional songs, but my new songs I'm trying to make more three-dimensional, you know, there's more symbolism, they're written on more than one level." [...] In late 1965, Dylan commented on the writing of [...] "My Back Pages" [...] specifically during {{an interview}} with Margaret Steen for The Toronto Star: [...] "I was in my New York phase then, or <b>at</b> <b>least,</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> just coming out of it. I was still keeping the things that are really really real out of my songs, for fear they'd be misunderstood. Now I don't care if they are." [...] As Dylan stated to Nat Hentoff at the time that [...] "My Back Pages" [...] and the other songs on Another Side of Bob Dylan were written, [...] "There aren't any finger pointing songs ... Now {{a lot of people are}} doing finger pointing songs. [...] You know, pointing to all the things that are wrong. [...] Me, I don't want to write for people anymore. You know, be a spokesman." ...|$|E
60|$|The {{question}} startled me. However, I could honestly answer that, in {{this respect}} <b>at</b> <b>least,</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> not like other men.|$|E
60|$|Now, I {{have said}} no more than this,--in fact, never quite so much as this; <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> {{sustained}} by Mr. Jefferson.|$|R
6000|$|... 'O, {{that they}} would,' said Violet, eagerly; 'or if not mamma herself, <b>at</b> <b>least,</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> sure, Matilda {{would come to}} me, or Annette.' ...|$|R
60|$|Am I joking? Yes, and yet no; for {{you know}} that when <b>I</b> joke <b>I</b> <b>am</b> usually most in earnest. <b>At</b> <b>least,</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> now.|$|R
6000|$|We rode our {{two miles}} in silence, and wide apart. <b>At</b> <b>least</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> silent, though Bascom cuffed {{his horse and}} cursed him a good deal, {{notwithstanding}} the horse was behaving well enough. When I branched off homeward, Bascom said: ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'And {{you thought}} she did? Then <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> {{not quite a}} fool? I fancied that there was {{response}} enough to what seems to have shown in spite of me to warrant the dream that if ever a time came--!' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, sir. I trust I {{have too}} much self-respect," [...] he answered, [...] "and, <b>at</b> <b>least,</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> never tempted. She won't come, she dislikes, {{she seems to have}} {{conceived}} a positive distaste for me, and yet I was considered an indulgent husband." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'It will, I think,' {{said the}} Doctor, 'to one <b>at</b> <b>least.</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> comforted {{to see you}} so brave. I longed to come sooner, but--' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I do not know. <b>At</b> <b>least</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> not certain. My {{knowledge}} of criminal law is very slight, but I should suppose {{it would be}} transportation for--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "If we do," [...] he answered, [...] "we {{are done}} for--I <b>am</b> <b>at</b> <b>least.</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> in Canadian Pacifics too deep. If I cannot {{keep the ball}} rolling here, I can never pull through." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, yes," [...] said Saxton, drily. [...] "Twice, <b>at</b> <b>least.</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> {{three days}} without food the last time. One {{has to take}} his chances in the ranges, and you don't pick up dollars without trouble anywhere. Still, we'll talk of that afterwards. Had enough?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Apparently she was," [...] replied her husband; [...] "but {{although}} I {{might have}} excused her, considering {{how much better}} suited this stranger was to her, in point of years <b>at</b> <b>least,</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> not willing to withdraw and leave her to another, especially as {{he might be a}} person entirely unworthy of her.|$|E
6000|$|I {{was sitting}} rather disconsolately by an upper window of Uncle Kenneth Morrison's log house at Arrow Creek. Below was what in dry weather--so, <b>at</b> <b>least,</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> told--was merely a pretty, grassy little valley, but {{which was now}} a {{considerable}} creek of muddy yellow water, rising daily. Beyond was a cheerless prospect of sodden prairie and dripping [...] "bluff." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Thats who <b>I</b> <b>am.</b> <b>At</b> <b>least</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> {{what is left}} of Miss Susanna. You dont look overjoyed to make my acquaintance; but <b>I</b> <b>was</b> as good-looking as you once. Take my advice, Mrs. Ned: dont drink {{champagne}}. The end {{of champagne}} is brandy; and the end of brandy is----" [...] Susanna made a grimace and indicated herself.|$|R
6000|$|... "In this <b>at</b> <b>least,</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> 'truth itself,' when I say that, {{whatever}} [...] {{the situation}} may be, {{there is no}} one whose society is dearer to me, [...] or can contribute more to my happiness." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Indeed, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> rather gratified {{by observing}} {{that you could}} not meet us again without emotion. I thought it told well for your heart, which I always {{believed}} to <b>be</b> most kind, <b>at</b> <b>least,</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> sure, to us.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, that's {{all very}} well. But I think I shall do Ricker's letters for him this winter <b>at</b> <b>least.</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> {{thinking}} {{of it on the}} way down. It'll be work, but it'll be money, too, and if I have something coming in I sha'n't feel as if I were ruined every time my play gets back from a manager." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I {{am not a}} fish at all,' {{said the}} new-comer, {{swallowing}} {{a great deal of}} salt water as she spoke; for you cannot learn how to be a proper fish all in a moment. 'I am not a fish at all, but a girl; <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> a girl a few minutes ago, only--' And she ducked her head under the waves so that they should not see her crying.|$|E
60|$|I re-entered the coach, {{which was}} to {{take me back to}} mine own humble lodgings in Passy. Here <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> alone--alone with my gloomy thoughts. My heart was full of wrath against the woman who had so basely tricked me, and I viewed with dismay amounting almost to despair the {{prospect}} of spending {{the rest of my life}} in her company. That night I slept but little, nor yet the following night, or the night after that. Those days I spent in seclusion, thankful for my solitude.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Oh, but--' said Robina, to {{whom the}} {{communication}} began to feel so momentous, {{that she could not}} help toying round it before coming to the point--'I know; <b>at</b> <b>least,</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> sure he will want to see her particularly.' ...|$|R
60|$|But men {{are of a}} coarser clay. <b>At</b> <b>least</b> <b>I</b> <b>am,</b> {{and nearly}} twenty years had elapsed, and here <b>was</b> <b>I</b> {{burdened}} under a load of affection, {{like a sack of}} returned love-letters, with no lap into which to dump them.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Do you know, Helen,' said Elizabeth, who {{had been}} {{pursuing}} her own thoughts, rather than listening to her sister's words, 'I do {{believe that we should}} all have been more like her if she had lived; <b>at</b> <b>least,</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> sure <b>I</b> should.' ...|$|R
60|$|But, Uncle Pumblechook, who was omnipotent in that kitchen, wouldn't {{hear the}} word, wouldn't {{hear of the}} subject, imperiously waved it all away with his hand, and asked for hot gin and water. My sister, who had begun to be alarmingly meditative, had to employ herself {{actively}} in getting the gin the hot water, the sugar, and the lemon-peel, and mixing them. For the time being <b>at</b> <b>least,</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> saved. I still {{held on to the}} leg of the table, but clutched it now with the fervor of gratitude.|$|E
60|$|Then {{she told}} lies. <b>At</b> <b>least</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> {{informed}} {{that they were}} lies later on by the real man of the world. They related to herself and her people, and if untrue must have been motiveless, for all was sordid and sorrowful, though she tried to gild the page with a book of photos which linked her to her past. Not being {{a man of the}} world, I prefer to believe that the tales were true, and thank her for the honour she did me in the telling.|$|E
6000|$|I am {{not quite}} sure that I ought to address you like that; but [...] I always shall unless you tell me not. We have been expecting a [...] letter from you every day since you went. Your friend from Ennis [...] came here, and brought us the news of your uncle's death. We [...] were very sorry; <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> certainly. I liked to think of [...] you a great deal better as my own Fred, than as a great lord. [...] But you will still be my own Fred always; will you not? ...|$|E
60|$|Friday.--À la bonne heure! I hear {{where you}} are and that you are {{apparently}} fairish well. That <b>is</b> good <b>at</b> <b>least.</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> full of Reformation work; up to the eyes in it; and begin to feel learned. A beautiful day outside, though something cold.|$|R
60|$|It is very wearisome, {{sitting in}} a chair. The weeks pass, the months come and go, the seasons change, the {{servants}} replace each other, while I remain. I only remain. It is a strange life <b>I</b> lead, but <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>at</b> peace.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well," [...] she said, [...] "I suppose I did, and I had {{my chances}} in two Town seasons. Perhaps <b>I</b> <b>was</b> {{unreasonably}} fastidious, but I was--if it wasn't more than that--fond of Reggie, and, <b>at</b> <b>least,</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> willing {{to bear the}} cost of my foolishness now." ...|$|R
6000|$|The day of {{the final}} dawned bright and clear. <b>At</b> <b>least,</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> not awake {{at the time to}} see, but I suppose it did; for at nine o'clock, when I came down to breakfast, the sun was shining brightly. The first {{eighteen}} holes were to be played before lunch, starting at eleven. Until twenty minutes before the hour Vincent Jopp kept me busy taking dictation, partly on matters connected with his wheat deal and partly on a signed article dealing with the Final, entitled [...] "How I Won." [...] At eleven sharp we were out on the first tee.|$|E
60|$|THE ARCHBISHOP. No. Nothing of the kind. They simply {{believed}} that mankind could live {{any length of}} time it knew to be absolutely necessary to save civilization from extinction. I did not share their belief: <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> not conscious of sharing it: I thought I was only amused by it. To me my father-in-law and his brother were a pair of clever cranks who had talked one another into a fixed idea which had become a monomania with them. It was not until I got into serious difficulties with the pension authorities after turning seventy that I began to suspect the truth.|$|E
60|$|Second, of course, {{and by all}} means, charge {{corrections}} on the Samoa book to me; {{but there}} are not near so many as I feared. The Lord hath dealt bountifully with me, and I believe all my advisers were amazed to see how nearly correct I had got the truck, <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>I</b> <b>was.</b> With this you will receive the whole revise and a type-written copy of the last chapter. And the thing now is Speed, to catch a possible revision of the treaty. I believe Cassells are to bring it out, but Baxter knows, and the thing has to be crammed through prestissimo, à la chasseur.|$|E
6000|$|... "I seek liberty, which {{hitherto}} {{you have}} refused to me, Ithiel. I must travel to Rome as fast as ships and horses can carry me. <b>I</b> desire to <b>be</b> present at that auction of the captives. <b>At</b> <b>least,</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> rich and can purchase Miriam--unless <b>I</b> <b>am</b> too late." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I like you, Mr. Godall," [...] {{returned}} the young man; [...] "you inspire {{me with a}} natural confidence; and I have not the slightest objection to your friend the Major, whom <b>I</b> take to <b>be</b> a nobleman in masquerade. <b>At</b> <b>least,</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> sure he is no soldier." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "How I should hate you, if you did! Not that I {{believe their}} fine stories about themselves. <b>At</b> <b>least,</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> certain it's {{only half the}} story. They have their quarrels, my dear, just as you and I have but they {{take care not to}} put them into poetry." ...|$|R
