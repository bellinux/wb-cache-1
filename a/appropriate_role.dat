5|$|Before the 2014 season, the Phillies signed Mayberry to a {{guaranteed}} $1.5875 million contract. Mayberry entered the season {{a member of}} the Phillies bench who some writers thought was not worth his salary, but made the opening day roster. Mayberry was successful early in the season, particularly as a pinch hitter – as of June 13, he was 9-for-19 with three home runs and 11 RBIs. He also started several games at first base, predominantly against left-handed pitchers. This success led some to suggest the Mayberry would have value in a potential trade, as the Phillies were not expected to make the playoffs, and thus might prefer to get a prospect for future seasons. However, some attributed Mayberry's success {{to the fact that the}} Phillies used him in an <b>appropriate</b> <b>role,</b> rather than trying to utilize him every day.|$|E
5|$|There are {{competing}} views over the <b>appropriate</b> <b>role</b> {{of the judiciary}} in matters concerning preventive detention under the ISA. A related concern is whether the judicial process is suitable for such matters. The legislative and constitutional amendments relating to judicial review under the ISA were intended to limit {{the role of the}} courts in national security matters. In 1989, Law Minister S. Jayakumar argued in Parliament that the amendments were needed because the courts would effectively be responsible for national security matters if judicial review was permitted. The subjective test was deemed necessary to reserve to the executive the responsibility for national security matters, and to enable the Government to deal effectively with security threats.|$|E

The essential elements of her educational theory emerged from this work, described in The Montessori Method in 1912 and in The Discovery of the Child in 1948. Her method was founded on the observation of children at liberty to act freely in an environment prepared to meet their needs. Montessori {{came to the conclusion}} that the children's spontaneous activity in this environment revealed an internal program of development, and that the <b>appropriate</b> <b>role</b> of the educator was to remove obstacles to this natural development and provide opportunities for it to proceed and flourish.|$|E

25|$|The formal {{education}} {{of girls and}} women began {{in the middle of}} the 19th century and was intimately tied to the conception that society had of the <b>appropriate</b> <b>role</b> for women to assume in life. Republican education prepared girls for their future role as wives and mothers and taught religion, singing, dancing, literature, etcetera. Academic education prepared girls for their role as community leaders and social benefactors and had some elements of the education offered boys. Seminaries educated women for the only socially acceptable occupation: teaching. Only unmarried women could be teachers. Many early women's colleges began as female seminaries and were responsible for producing an important corps of educators.|$|E
25|$|In {{accordance}} with ISKCON GBC Governing Body Commission resolutions March 1978 Satsvarupa dasa Goswami {{along with other}} eleven Governing Body Commissioners assumed duties and services of initiating disciples in assigned zones {{after the death of}} Prabhupada. Initial preaching areas in the United States and Caribbean were expanded with an addition of Ireland in 1982 where he became a zonal acharya. The assumption of equal status to Srila Prabhupada and the title of acharya are still surrounded in a controversy. While following the direction of Governing Body Commission, Satsvarupa dasa Goswami was one of the pioneers who attempted to reform the system, by assuming more humble and <b>appropriate</b> <b>role</b> of a guru as per recorded instructions of the founder-acharya. While imitation of Prabhupada was criticised, despite these warnings, specifically by Satsvarupa dasa Goswami, such imitation sometimes resulted in curious side-effects and many devotees adopted Prabhupada's mannerisms. This remained evident especially among the older American devotees who even now speak with an Indian accent and display many of Prabhupada's gestures like turning one's head or moving one's hand in a certain way.|$|E
