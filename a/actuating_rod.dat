50|$|On 3 July 1968, Airspeed Ambassador G-AMAD crashed at London Heathrow Airport when a flap <b>actuating</b> <b>rod</b> failed due to metal fatigue. Six of {{the eight}} on board and eight horses being transported were killed. Two Hawker Siddeley Tridents were hit by the {{crashing}} Ambassador.|$|E
50|$|The cataract's <b>actuating</b> <b>rod</b> {{also had}} a screw adjuster, which acted to vary the water {{injection}} time (Newcomen) or the phasing between the inlet and exhaust valves (Cornish). This {{could be used to}} give a longer and more effective condensation time, if the condensing water supply was warm, as in the Summer. This adjustment appears to have been poorly understood though, and little used by the engine drivers.|$|E
5000|$|... 3 July 1968: a BKS Air Transport Ambassador crashed at London Heathrow Airport. All {{but two of}} {{its crew}} {{as well as several}} horses which were being transported and their grooms, were killed. A parked Trident {{airliner}} was damaged beyond repair and another Trident had its tail torn off before the airliner hit terminal buildings and came to rest. The accident was found to have been caused by the failure of a flap <b>actuating</b> <b>rod</b> in the Ambassador's port (left) wing. Coincidentally, the Trident which suffered the damaged tail (G-ARPI) was subsequently repaired and later involved in an (unconnected) fatal accident in June 1972.|$|E

50|$|Geared {{locomotives}} {{were built}} for power, not for speed, and were popular with logging companies {{who had to}} move heavy trains up and down grades safely. Four types of logging locomotives were utilized {{in the early twentieth}} century: the common rod engine, the Shay, the Heisler, and the Climax locomotives. The rod configuration has steam pistons which <b>actuate</b> <b>rods</b> attached to the wheels which, in turn, provide locomotion. The Shay configured geared-locomotive had two or more pistons that are mounted perpendicular to the boiler. Instead of <b>actuating</b> <b>rods</b> for locomotion, the pistons turned a crankshaft which ran the length of the engine on one side and engaged each of the wheels with a crown gear. The Heisler configured geared-locomotive always had two pistons cradling the boiler and is mounted to a central axle. This central axle was attached to the locomotive wheels much like a modern truck. The rarest of the logging locomotives is the Climax configured geared-locomotive. Climax locomotives have pistons that flank the boiler at a 45-degree angle. These pistons turn a flywheel which is connected to a central axle, thus providing locomotion. All of these geared locomotives are rare but there are only three Climax engines that can be seen today in working order.|$|R

50|$|It {{was invented}} around 1800 by Jonathan Hornblower. His valve {{is in the}} form of a hollow {{cylinder}} provided with two seats of nearly equal diameter, at A and B in the diagram. The cylinder is connected to the <b>actuating</b> <b>rod</b> by a web. The force required to lift the valve depends on the difference between diameters D and d: the smaller this difference can be made, the less the force necessary to open the valve. In Hornblower's valve, the steam flows past seat B only. In later developments of the valve, the central portion is waisted so that the flow can pass at A as well, so increasing the valve opening area for the same amount of lift.|$|E
5000|$|The M47TUD20 {{introduced}} new common failure points. Chief {{among these}} {{was a new}} 'swirl flap' mechanism embedded in the inlet manifold. This consisted {{of a number of}} butterfly valves within each individual inlet tract, which are secured to an <b>actuating</b> <b>rod</b> via two small screws. It has become clear that over time these screws can come loose via vibration etc. When this happens they can end up being drawn into the respective cylinder, causing significant damage to piston, cylinder head and valves. If unlucky further damage can be caused to the turbo if the screw then makes its way through the exhaust valve into the manifold and subsequently into the turbo. These failures have occurred in such quantity that a number of specialist BMW magazines have featured articles on the problem including information on how to remove the swirl flaps. [...] For those who wish to perform some preventive maintenance on the M47TUD20 engine, there are companies who supply and/or fit blanking plugs to allow the removal of these swirl flaps altogether. BMW addressed the problem by introducing stronger swirl flaps and larger diameter spindles - made from plastic - in 2006.|$|E
50|$|A new Mercedes 5-speed {{transaxle}} {{was designed}} with the rear suspension {{in mind and}} the previous longitudinal spring/damper design of the C9 was abandoned in favour of a transverse layout, <b>actuated</b> by push <b>rods.</b> This allowed for a better integrated rear end that was much stiffer than before, according to designer Leo Ress. The front suspension remained similar to the older car with inboard transverse coil spring/damper units <b>actuated</b> by push <b>rods.</b> The brakes were Brembo and tyres were switched from Michelin to Goodyear.|$|R

Please report any quality issues you encounter to digital@library. tamu. edu, referencing the URI of the item. Includes bibliographical references. Issued also on microfiche from Lange Micrographics. Shape Memory Alloys (SMAS) may be combined with elastomers to produce composites with unique material and structural behavior. Because of the high damping characteristics of the low temperature SMA phase, the addition of SMA particles to an elastomer may produce a composite with a damping capacity more thermally stable than the elastomer alone. Effective composite properties from micromechanics and the correspon dence principle from viscoelasticity are used to predict the damping capacity of an SMA particulate-elastomeric matrix composite. The embedding of Ni-Ti SMA wire actuators into flexible silicone rubber rods can affect the composite structural behavior by causing the rods to deflect upon heating and shape recovery of the SMA wires. The wires were at first prepared and <b>actuated</b> in the <b>rods</b> according to the shape memory effect, but the relaxed shape of a rod after actuation was different from the original shape. A procedure to train Ni-Ti wire to exhibit the twoway shape memory effect, a behavior involving a thermally induced and zero-stress reversible transformation strain, was established. Rods fabricated with two two-way trained wires deflected in one of two opposite, yet planar directions, according to the SMA wire being heated, and they relaxed to the straight, undeformed shape upon cooling of the SMA wires. Modelling of the response of the flexible rods with embedded actuators included both a closed-form solution of the fully actuated state and an incremental formu lation that accounts for different temperature histories. The deflections of fully <b>actuated</b> <b>rods</b> were predicted within a reasonable accuracy...|$|R

50|$|The cockpit is ideally minimal, {{equipped}} with instrumentation for simple, day, VFR flying. Aileron and elevator control is affected {{through use of}} a side stick. This makes ingress/egress of the tight cockpit simpler and prevents leg movements from imparting motion to the stick inflight. Rudder control is by use of a rudder bar rather than individual pedals, thus reducing complexity. Flight controls are attached and <b>actuated</b> with push <b>rods</b> rather than cables.|$|R
50|$|Knight's design had two {{cast-iron}} sleeves per cylinder, one sliding {{inside the}} other with the piston inside the inner sleeve. The sleeves were operated by small connected <b>rods</b> <b>actuated</b> by an eccentric shaft. They had ports cut out at their upper ends. The design was remarkably quiet, and the sleeve valves needed little attention. It was, however, more expensive to manufacture due to the precision grinding required on the sleeves' surfaces. It also used more oil at high speeds and was harder to start in cold weather.|$|R

The heads were individually detachable for each cylinder. The design was remarkably quiet and the sleeve valves needed little attention.

The bolt is locked by a rising bolt lock. The gun fires {{from an open}} bolt. The spring-powered cartridge casing extractor is contained in the bolt and a fixed ejector is installed in the trigger group. The BAR is striker fired (the bolt carrier serves as the striker) and uses a trigger mechanism with a fire selector lever that enables operating in either semi-automatic or fully automatic firing modes. The selector lever {{is located on the}} left side of the receiver and is simultaneously the manual safety (selector lever in the [...] "S" [...] position - weapon is [...] "safe", [...] "F" [...] - [...] "Fire", [...] "A" [...] - [...] "Automatic" [...] fire).

40|$|Locomotion {{provides}} superb {{examples of}} cooperation among neuromuscular systems, environmental reaction forces, and sensory feedback. As {{part of a}} program to understand the neuromechanics of locomotion, here we construct a model of anguilliform (eel-like) swimming in slender fishes. Building on a continuum mechanical representation of the body as an viscoelastic <b>rod,</b> <b>actuated</b> by a traveling wave of preferred curvature and subject to hydrodynamic reaction forces, we incorporate {{a new version of}} a calcium release and muscle force model, fitted to data from the lamprey Ichthyomyzon unicuspis, that interactively generates the curvature wave. We use the model to investigate the source of the difference in speeds observed between electromyographic waves of muscle activation and mechanical waves of body curvature, concluding that it is due to a combination of passive viscoelastic and geometric properties of the body and active muscle properties. Moreover, we find that nonlinear force dependence on muscle length and shortening velocity may reduce th...|$|R
40|$|Three {{different}} models of motile systems are studied: a vibrating legged robot, a snake-like locomotor, and {{two kinds of}} agellar microswimmers. The vibrating robot crawls by modulating the friction with the substrate. This also leads {{to the ability to}} switch direction of motion by varying the vibration frequency. A detailed account of this phenomenon is given through a fully analytical treatment of the model. The analysis delivers formulas for the average velocity of the robot and for the frequency at which the direction switch takes place. A quantitative description of the mechanism for the friction modulation underlying the motility of the robot is also provided. Snake-like locomotion is studied through a system consisting of a planar, internally <b>actuated,</b> elastic <b>rod.</b> The rod is constrained to slide longitudinally without slipping laterally. This setting is inspired by undulatory locomotion of snakes, where frictional resistance is typically larger in the lateral direction than in the longitudinal one. The presence of constraints leads to non-standard boundary conditions, that lead to the possibility to close and solve uniquely the equations of motion. Explicit formulas are derived, which highlight the connection between observed trajectories, internal actuation, and forces exchanged with the environment. The two swimmer models (one actuated externally and the other internally) provide an example of propulsion at low Reynolds number resulting from the periodical beating of a passive elastic filament. Motions produced by generic periodic actuations are studied within the regime of small compliance of the filament. The analysis shows that variations in the velocity of beating can generate different swimming trajectories. Motion control through modulations of the actuation velocity is discusse...|$|R
40|$|Insects carry {{a pair of}} {{antennae}} {{on their}} head: multimodal sensory organs that serve {{a wide range of}} sensory-guided behaviours. During locomotion, antennae are involved in near-range orientation, for example in detecting, localising, probing and negotiating obstacles. Here we present a bionic, active tactile sensing system inspired by insect antennae. It comprises an <b>actuated</b> elastic <b>rod</b> equipped with a terminal acceleration sensor. The measurement principle is based on the analysis of damped harmonic oscillations registered upon contact with an object. The dominant frequency of the oscillation is extracted to determine the distance of the contact point along the probe, and basal angular encoders allow tactile localisation in a polar coordinate system. Finally, the damping behaviour of the registered signal is exploited to determine the most likely material. The tactile sensor is tested in four approaches with increasing neural plausibility: First, we show that peak extraction from the Fourier spectrum is sufficient for tactile localisation with position errors below 1 %. Also, the damping property of the extracted frequency is used for material classification. Second, we show that the Fourier spectrum can be analysed by an Artificial Neural Network which can be trained to decode contact distance and to classify contact materials. Thirdly, we show how efficiency can be improved by band-pass filtering the Fourier spectrum by application of non-negative matrix factorisation. This reduces the input dimension by 95 % while reducing classification performance by 8 % only. Finally, we replace the FFT by an array of spiking neurons with gradually differing resonance properties, such that their spike rate {{is a function of the}} input frequency. We show that this network can be applied to detect tactile contact events of a wheeled robot, and how detrimental effects of robot velocity on antennal dynamics can be suppressed by state-dependent modulation of the input signals...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} the research, mechanical {{design and construction}} of {{the lower half of}} a biped robot. In the long run this work will be developed further to build a service robot to perform repetitive (and often dangerous) tasks and to help disabled people to carry out everyday tasks. The aim of this research project is to develop a humanoid with the agility of a ‘high end’ robot but on a very low budget in comparison. In order to achieve this, several unique mechanical attributes have been proposed and implemented such as dual push <b>rod</b> <b>actuated</b> joint articulation. This technique produces a larger joint torque and reduces leg inertia allowing for the implementation of WCK serial controlled servo modules for actuation. To further increase human-like similarities a toe joint is implemented. This gives the humanoid the ability to stride more elegantly, increase speed control, and reduce energy used for each step. All the parts of this robot have been manufactured from scratch and most have been CNC machined. Solidworks is used as a 3 D modelling package to produce a simulated version of the humanoid to determine dimensions and dynamics before construction takes place. SolidCAM is a computer aided machining package which was used to specify machining paths to produce G-Code. An additional 4 th axis was added to the CNC machine solely {{for the purpose of this}} project as many parts were too intricate and complex for the standard 3 axis machine. A biped humanoid requires several types of sensors for balancing. High accuracy and resolution is of paramount importance for the successful control of the humanoid. Various force sensors are reviewed and their advantages and disadvantages are discussed. Gyroscopes and attitude heading reference systems (AHRS) are investigated and tests are performed on all units to obtain operational characteristics and accuracy. Visual Basic. net has been used for developing software for controlling and monitoring all sensors and actuator modules. Essentially a humanoid platform has been developed with appropriate software allowing for the next stage of development, the development of the gait control algorithms...|$|R
