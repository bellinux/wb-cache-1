According to the columnist Barthélémy Mouffle d'Angerville in 1721 Claude Dupin helped the eldest {{daughter of the}} family, Jeanne-Marie-Thérèse de Fontaine, when she passed through Berry. She married with François II de Barbançois, Seigneur de Celon on 21 August 1720 [...] and, returning from the baths of Bourbon-l'Archambault and in considerable pain, she received the hospitality of Claude Dupin. Once his guest was recovered, Dupin was persuaded to accompanied her to Paris, where he met Samuel Bernard, who impressed by his kindness, offered him the hand of Louise, aged only sixteen. In his forties, a widower and father of a six-year-old son Louis-Claude (who became in the grandfather of the novelist George Sand), this move was unexpected and he readily agreed, because with this proposal came the <b>appointment</b> <b>of</b> <b>Receiver</b> General of finances in Metz and Alsace.|$|E

2500|$|Though Gowen's {{powers as}} {{president}} were eclipsed by the <b>appointment</b> <b>of</b> <b>receivers,</b> {{his position as}} the one receiver who had close knowledge of the overall operations of the combined rail and coal businesses placed {{him in the middle}} of revitalization efforts. However, his hitherto support from the McCalmont Brothers banking concern was about to unravel through a series of discords into downright enmity. The McCalmonts owned at the time two-thirds of the Reading's stock and half of its bonds, and they formed their own committee to look after the interests of (especially British) bondholders. Initially this committee, chaired by a former Lord Chancellor, approved with reservations Gowen's inclusion as a receiver on the bases that [...] "he proprietors of the bonds and stocks of the company in America have evinced their satisfaction with the choice of receivers," [...] and that his [...] "action... as receiver will be controlled by his colleagues and by the court." ...|$|R

2500|$|Strictly speaking, {{it is not}} {{possible}} to enforce a floating charge at all - the charge must first crystallise into a fixed charge. [...] In the absence of any special provisions in the relevant document, a floating charge crystallises either upon the <b>appointment</b> <b>of</b> a <b>receiver</b> or upon the commencement of liquidation. [...] It has also been suggested, relying upon obiter dictum comments by Lord Macnaghten in Government Stocks and Securities Investments Co Ltd v Manila Rly Co that a charge should also crystallise upon the company ceasing to trade as a going concern. [...] However, this view is not yet supported by judicial authority.|$|R
50|$|A {{company does}} not have to be {{insolvent}} at the time of the presentation of the petition; the court can take account of a future event which is likely to have an adverse effect on the company's ability to discharge its debts. However, an examiner cannot be appointed to a company which is already in liquidation. The existence of a winding up petition does not, in itself, prevent the <b>appointment</b> <b>of</b> an examiner. Where a receiver stands appointed for a continuous period of three days or more, an examiner cannot be appointed. The period of three days runs from the <b>appointment</b> <b>of</b> the <b>receiver</b> and it is not open to a petitioner to argue that the period has not started to run based on an alleged infirmity in the appointment.|$|R

5000|$|A fixed {{equitable}} charge confers a {{right on the}} secured party to look to (or appropriate) a particular asset {{in the event of}} the debtor's default, which is enforceable by either power <b>of</b> sale or <b>appointment</b> <b>of</b> a <b>receiver.</b> It is probably {{the most common form of}} security taken over assets. Technically, a charge (or a [...] "mere" [...] charge) cannot include the power to enforce without judicial intervention, as it does not include the transfer of a property proprietary interest in the charged asset. If a charge includes this right (such as private sale by a receiver), it is really an equitable mortgage (sometimes called charge by way of mortgage). Since little turns on this distinction, the term [...] "charge" [...] is often used to include an equitable mortgage.|$|R
50|$|The {{application}} for the <b>appointment</b> <b>of</b> a <b>receiver</b> was denied and all proceedings {{in the suit}} were suspended, upon request of the Conciliation Commissioner for Christian County appointed under section 75 of the Bankruptcy Act, stating that Radford desired to avail himself of the provisions of that section. Radford filed a petition asking {{for an opportunity to}} submit a composition of his debts, in the federal court for Western Kentucky. The petition was promptly approved and a meeting of the creditors was held, but Radford failed to obtain the acceptance of the requisite majority in number and amount to the composition proposed. Then, the Bank offered to accept a deed of the mortgaged property in full satisfaction of the indebtedness to it and to assume the unpaid taxes. Radford refused to execute the deed; on June 30, 1934, the state court ordered a foreclosure sale.|$|R
