40|$|Aspiration of gastric {{contents}} to {{the lungs}} {{is a major}} hazard of general anaesthesia [1, 2]. The incidence of death in relationship to pulmonary aspiration of gastric content is higher in children than in adults [1]. Risk factors in children are the short oesophagus and the insufflation of gas to the stomach when using an <b>anaesthetic</b> <b>face</b> <b>mask</b> [3]. The increase in intragastric pressure in this situation may cause incompetence of the cardio-oesophageal junction and regurgitation of gastric content. It has been demonstrated in adults {{that the increase in}} intragastric pressure {{is directly related to the}} intensity of suxamethonium-induced muscle fasciculations [4]. However, Salem, Wong and Lin [5] did not find any significant increase in intragastric pressure after suxamethonium in children. In that study, the incidence of muscle fasciculations was low, possibly because anaes-thesia was induced with halothane in 67 % of the children and with thiopentone in the re-mainder. Therefore, the intensity of muscle fas-ciculations may have been inhibited because halothane, like enflurane [6], decreases suxa-methonium-induced depolarization at the myo-neural junction [7]. Moderate or even violent muscle fasciculations have been seen in 80 - 100 % of children given suxamethonium after thio-pentone [8 - 10]. It has been demonstrated that fentanyl 1 or 2 ug kg" 1 [9] and alfentanil 10, 25 or 50 ugkg- ' [10] inhibit muscle fasciculations caused by suxa-methonium in children in a dose-dependent manner. The present study evaluated the change in intragastric pressure in children during muscle fasciculations caused by suxamethonium with or without pretreatment with alfentanil 50 ug kg" 1...|$|E
40|$|AbstractObjectivesTo {{evaluate}} {{the impact of}} an infection control educational programme in anaesthetic practice on the clinical performance of the personnel working in anaesthetic field and anaesthetic work place bacterial contamination. MethodsThis study was conducting on 35 personnel involved in 500 operations over two and half months. Their compliance towards handling of anaesthetic equipments, wearing of protective tools and hand hygiene was evaluated using a 13 items check list pre and post delivering of an educational infection control programme (intervention). Of 500 operations 300 were randomly selected for evaluation of bacterial contamination. Two swabs were taken from anaesthetic place before induction of general anaesthesia (T 0) and 30 min intraoperative (T 1) pre and post intervention. Another swab was taking from anaesthetists’ hands 15 min after induction of anaesthesia (T 2). ResultsThe intervention programme influenced positively the attitude of junior anaesthetists and nurses regarding {{the proper use of}} protective tools, anaesthetic equipments and hand hygiene. Senior anaesthestists’ compliance with hand hygiene, frequency use of gloves and anaesthetic filter did not change after intervention. But their attitude towards handling of laryngoscope, <b>anaesthetic</b> <b>face</b> <b>mask</b> and catheter for suction improved after intervention. The adherence of housekeepers to hand hygiene, frequency of gloves use and anaesthetic equipments’ disinfection improved significantly after intervention. Ninety-two (63 %) swabs were positive for bacteria at T 0 before intervention. They reduced to 9 (6. 3 %) positive swabs after intervention. The number of positive swabs at T 1 was 121 (82. 9 %) before intervention, reduced to 68 (47. 2 %) after intervention. One hundred and eight (74 %) swabs from hands of anaesthetists were positive for bacteria before intervention. They lowered significantly to 55 (38. 2 %) after intervention. Bacterial cross infection between anaesthetic machine and anaesthetists’ hands existed pre and post intervention. In conclusion, infection control programme enhanced personnel clinical compliance and reduced bacterial contamination in anaesthetic place...|$|E

40|$|Introduction. The {{laryngeal}} mask airway (LMA) was recently introduced in general anesthesia {{as an alternative}} to the <b>face</b> <b>mask</b> or tracheal intubation for airway maintenance. &# 13; Methods. The effects of LMA insertion, <b>face</b> <b>mask</b> or tracheal intubation on homodynamic status were studied in 195 normotensive patients who underwent elective transurethral lithotripsy (TUL). The patients were monitored with blood pressure measurement and pulse oximetry. Anesthesia was induced with sodium thiopental, succynilcholine and fentanyl and maintained with halothane, nitrous oxide and oxygen. &# 13; Findings. The heart rate (HR) and mean arterial pressure increased after LMA insertion. <b>face</b> <b>mask</b> or tracheal intubation, compared with baseline (P< 0. 05). The hemodynamic changes were significantly greater after tracheal intubation and <b>face</b> <b>mask</b> than after LMA insertion (P< 0. 05). &# 13; Conclusion. We conclude that insertion of LMA is associated with less hemodynamic disturbances than <b>face</b> <b>mask</b> or tracheal intubation in normotensive patients undergoing elective operations...|$|R

During the influenza A(H 1 N 1) pandemic, antiviral prescribing was limited, vaccines {{were not available}} early, {{and the effectiveness of}} nonpharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) was uncertain. Our study examined whether use of <b>face</b> <b>masks</b> and hand hygiene reduced the incidence of influenza-like illness (ILI). Methods. A randomized intervention trial involving 1437 young adults living in university residence halls during the 2006 – 2007 influenza season was designed. Residence halls were randomly assigned to 1 of 3 groups— <b>face</b> <b>mask</b> use, <b>face</b> <b>masks</b> with hand hygiene, or control — for 6 weeks. Generalized models estimated rate ratios for clinically diagnosed or survey-reported ILI weekly and cumulatively. Results. We observed significant reductions in ILI during weeks 4 – 6 in the mask and hand hygiene group, compared with the control group, ranging from 35 % (confidence interval [CI], 9 %– 53 %) to 51 % (CI, 13 %– 73 %), after adjusting for vaccination and other covariates. <b>Face</b> <b>mask</b> use alone showed a similar reduction in ILI compared with the control group, but adjusted estimates were not statistically significant. Neither <b>face</b> <b>mask</b> use and hand hygiene nor <b>face</b> <b>mask</b> use alone was associated with a significant reduction in the rate of ILI cumulatively. Conclusions.

40|$|Abstract The {{development}} of textile industry in Indonesia can potentially increase some occupational diseases that caused by waste products. One of those waste products from textile industry is cotton dust, {{which can cause}} byssinosis. There {{are several ways to}} reduce cotton dust exposure, such as using <b>face</b> <b>mask.</b> This research aim to describe the relationship between employee's knowledge  about byssinosis with <b>face</b> <b>mask</b> utilization in spinning department of a textile factory. This research is a descriptive study with cross sectional approach. The subjects of this research are employees working on Spinning Department.

40|$|BACKGROUND [...] The {{factors that}} {{influence}} nocturnal compliance among patients prescribed low flow oxygen therapy were determined and tolerance of nasal cannulae and Venturi <b>face</b> <b>masks</b> compared. METHODS [...] Two studies were performed: (1) a prospective study of 99 hospitalised patients prescribed low flow oxygen therapy, 49 on nasal cannulae and 50 on Venturi face mask; and (2) a prospective study of 20 separate patients with an acute respiratory disorder requiring low flow oxygen therapy who were given nasal cannulae and Venturi <b>face</b> <b>mask</b> on successive nights in random order. RESULTS [...] In study 1, 49 patients dislodged their device at least once during the night. Those using Venturi <b>face</b> <b>masks</b> and those over 75 years of age had the most dislodgements.

40|$|Thesis (MCur) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2013. Surgical <b>face</b> <b>masks</b> {{have been}} {{designed}} to protect health care professionals from the splashes of the patients’ blood or body fluids and also to minimise the transmission of oro- and nasopharyngeal bacteria from the surgical team to the patient’s wounds, thereby decreasing the likelihood of postoperative surgical site infections during a surgical procedure. However, there are several ways in which surgical <b>face</b> <b>masks</b> could potentially contribute to contamination of the wound during a surgical procedure in the operating room. The objectives of this study were to explore and describe the effectiveness of surgical <b>face</b> <b>masks</b> as a protective barrier during a surgical procedure in the operating room in the public hospitals in the North West Province, South Africa and to formulate recommendations regarding surgical <b>face</b> <b>masks</b> worn by health care professionals during a surgical procedure in the operating rooms. A systematic review was conducted, followed by a quantitative, explorative, descriptive and contextual approach. The motivation for a systematic review was to search evidence on surgical <b>face</b> <b>mask</b> efficiency. A search strategy was conducted in February and March 2012 and the total initial search was 9, 933 research articles. Screening of articles on effectiveness of surgical <b>face</b> <b>masks</b> during a surgical procedure was done. After six months the search was updated and the final sample of six relevant articles (n= 6) was obtained. Studies that met the inclusion criteria were critically appraised based on the scores using standardised critical appraisal tools. The findings of this research project were synthesised and evaluated in order to come to conclusions. Conclusions were integrated and synthesised as the basis of developing a clear overview of the best quality empirical evidence about effectiveness of surgical <b>face</b> <b>masks</b> during a surgical procedure in the operating room. Recommendations were formulated for the nursing practice, education and research focussing on wearing a surgical <b>face</b> <b>mask</b> during a surgical procedure in the operating room. Reviewer’s conclusion: From the limited results it is unclear whether wearing surgical <b>face</b> <b>masks</b> during a surgical procedure in the operating room serve as a protective device for both surgical team and the patient.

25|$|A full <b>face</b> <b>mask</b> {{is lighter}} and more {{comfortable}} for swimming than a helmet or band mask, and usually provides an improved field of vision, {{but it is not}} as secure, and does not provide the same level of protection as the heavier and more sturdily constructed equipment. The two types of equipment have different ranges of application. Most full <b>face</b> <b>masks</b> are adaptable for use with scuba or surface supply. The full <b>face</b> <b>mask</b> does not usually have a bailout block fitted, and this is usually attached to the diver's harness, with a single hose to supply the mask from main or bailout gas which is selected at the block. The strap arrangement for full <b>face</b> <b>masks</b> is usually quite secure, but not as secure as a bandmask or helmet, and it is possible for it to be dislodged in the water. However it is also quite practicable for a trained diver to replace and clear a full <b>face</b> <b>mask</b> under water without assistance, so this is more an inconvenience than a disaster unless the diver is rendered unconscious at the same time.|$|R

The purpose of this study was to investigate changes in the craniofacial structure of children with maxillary retrognathism following <b>face</b> <b>mask</b> treatment by means of thin-plate spline analysis. Methods: Thirty children with skeletal Class III malocclusions who had been treated with <b>face</b> <b>masks</b> were compared with a group of 30 untreated gender-matched, age-matched, observation period-matched, and craniofacial configuration-matched subjects. Average geometries, scaled to an equivalent size, were generated by means of Procrustes analysis. Thin-plate spline analysis was then performed for localization of the shape changes. Results: <b>Face</b> <b>mask</b> treatment induced a forward displacement of the maxilla, a counterclockwise rotation of the palatal plane, a horizontal compression of the anterior border of the symphysis and the condylar region, and a downward deformation of the menton. The cranial base exhibited a counterclockwise deformation as a whole. Conclusion: We conclude that thin-plate spline analysis is a valuable supplement to conventional cephalometric analysis...|$|R
