Heat mustard oil in a pan to smoking point. Cool and heat again. Add cumin seeds and asafoetida and cook on medium heat till the cumin seeds change colour. Add onion and sauté for three to four minutes or till the onion turns light golden. Add ginger-garlic paste and sauté for a minute. Add a little water and stir. Add tomatoes and sauté for a minute.

50|$|Energy {{pervades the}} work of art, and the more that energy is clarified, intensified, and concentrated, the more {{compelling}} {{the work of}} art should be. Dewey gives the example of young children intending to act a play. “They gesticulate, tumble and roll, each pretty much on his own account, with little reference to what others are doing.” This is contrasted with the “well-constructed and well-executed” play. However, it does not necessarily follow that the latter play will be better than the former. This is merely an extreme case of contrasting aesthetic values based on different organizations of energy. The organization of energy manifests itself in patterns or intervals, now more now less. This patterning is related to Dewey’s earlier ideas on rhythm. He writes that instances of energy are “piecemeal, one replacing another…And thus we are brought again to rhythm.” However, the organization of energies {{is not the same as}} rhythm. The organization of energy is important as “the common element in all the arts” for “producing a result.” Artistic skill exemplifies skillful organization of energy. An over-emphasis of a single source of energy (at the expense of others sources of energy) in a work of art shows poor organization of energy. At the end of the chapter, Dewey states that art is, in fact, “only definable as organization of energies.” The power of art to “move <b>and</b> <b>stir,</b> <b>to</b> calm and tranquilize” is intelligible only when “the fact of energy” is made central to an understanding of art. The qualities of order and balance in works of art follow from the selection of significant energy. Great art, therefore, finds and deploys ideal energy.|$|E
