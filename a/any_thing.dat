5|$|This little work, if Mary {{had never}} {{produced}} <b>any</b> <b>thing</b> else, would serve, with persons of true taste and sensibility, {{to establish the}} eminence of her genius. The story is nothing. He that looks into the book only for incident, will probably lay it down with disgust. But the feelings are of the truest and most exquisite class; every circumstance is adorned with that species of imagination, which enlists itself under the banners of delicacy and sentiment.|$|E
5|$|It is counted {{little better}} than a kite, for it is of ravenous quality, and is very mischievous; it will steal and carry away <b>any</b> <b>thing</b> it finds about the house, that is not too heavy, tho' not fit for its food; as knives, forks, spoons and linnen cloths, or {{whatever}} it can fly away with, sometimes they say it has stolen bits of firebrands, or lighted candles, and lodged them in the stacks of corn, and the thatch of barns and houses, and set them on fire; but this I only had by oral tradition.|$|E

50|$|The {{definition}} {{must not}} be too wide or too narrow. It must be applicable to everything to which the defined term applies (i.e. not miss anything out), and to nothing else (i.e. not include <b>any</b> <b>things</b> to which the defined term would not truly apply).|$|R
60|$|Though I miscarried {{so much in}} my {{design for}} large pots, yet I made several smaller things with better success; such as little round pots, flat dishes, pitchers, and pipkins, and <b>any</b> <b>things</b> my hand turned to; and {{the heat of the}} sun baked them quite hard.|$|R

25|$|Mr. Broome is {{the founder}} of the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals; the very {{establishment}} is a proof of, and honour to, the advance of civilisation. <b>Any</b> <b>thing</b> from so earnest a friend of so good a cause must be acceptable.|$|E
25|$|I {{have nowhere}} in <b>any</b> <b>thing</b> I may have written {{declared}} {{myself to be}} a Republican; nor should I think it worth while to be a martyr and a confessor to any form or mode of government. But what I have staked health and wealth, name and fame upon, and am ready to do so again and to the last gasp, is this, {{that there is a}} power in the people to change its government and its governors.|$|E

60|$|So much, then, for the {{inference}} that Judge Douglas draws, that I am {{in favor of}} setting the sections at war with one another.

25|$|In {{exercise}} of the powers conferred upon me by the Defence (requisition of land) Regulations, made under the Emergency Powers Defence Act 1940, on the 28th day of December AD 1940, I do authorize all persons who shall be engaged by the United States Government or its agents and contractors on the construction for that government of any naval, military or air works at Argentia to do any work on any land or place <b>any</b> <b>thing</b> in, on, or over any land upon the Argentia Peninsula, insofar as it shall be necessary for any such person so {{to do for the}} carrying out of any such work of construction including any preliminary work in relation thereto.|$|E
25|$|The formal {{cause is}} its form, i.e., the {{arrangement}} of that matter. It tells us what a thing is, that <b>any</b> <b>thing</b> {{is determined by the}} definition, form, pattern, essence, whole, synthesis or archetype. It embraces the account of causes in terms of fundamental principles or general laws, as the whole (i.e., macrostructure) is the cause of its parts, a relationship known as the whole-part causation. Plainly put, the formal cause is the idea existing in the first place as exemplar {{in the mind of the}} sculptor, and in the second place as intrinsic, determining cause, embodied in the matter. Formal cause could only refer to the essential quality of causation. A simple example of the formal cause is the mental image or idea that allows an artist, architect, or engineer to create a drawing.|$|E
25|$|The general {{military}} {{character of}} the country is that of extreme difficulty. Immediately {{at the front of the}} hills the plain is covered with the Great Saul Forest, for an average width of ten or twelve miles; the masses of the mountains are immense, their sides steep, and covered with impenetrable jungle. The trenches in these ridges are generally water-courses, and rather chasms or gulfs than <b>any</b> <b>thing</b> that deserves the name of a valley. The roads are very insecure, and invariably pathways over mountains, or the beds of rivers, the usual means of transport throughout the country being by hill porters. Notwithstanding this general description, spaces comparatively open and hollow, and elevated tracts of tolerably level land, are to be met with, but so completely detached as to contribute but little to facilitate intercourse.|$|E

25|$|I {{thank you}} heartily for the pamphlet, {{and for the}} {{authorities}} you give me for the doctrines I have sworn by, long and long since: I know not how long, they have been my creed: I believe, before even my happiness in your acquaintance and friendship, tho' they have certainly been strengthen'd and confirm'd by your conversation and instruction—in support of these principles I trust I shall ever act, and I shall continue to attempt their general propagation;—whether by the best means, is matter of speculation: but by the best, according to my judgement—nothing can make me a disciple of Paine or Priestley, nor <b>any</b> <b>thing</b> induce me to proclaim, that I am not so, but in the mode I myself think the best to resist their mischief—private conversation and private insinuation may best suit the extent of my abilities, the turn of my temper, {{and the nature of}} my character...|$|E
25|$|Wheras one Rayner hath publish'd {{a strange}} Medley of Nonsense, under the Title of the Welch Opera, {{said to be}} written by the Author of the Tragedy of Tragedies; and also hath impudently affirm'd {{that this was a}} great Part of the Grub-Street Opera, which he {{attempts}} to insinuate was stopt by the Authority: This is to assure the Town, that what he hath publish'd is a very incorrect and spurious Edition of the Welch Opera, a very small Part of which was originally written by the said Author; and that it contains scarce <b>any</b> <b>thing</b> of the Grub-street Opera, excepting the Names of some of the Characters {{and a few of the}} Songs: This later Piece hath in it above fifty entire new Songs; and is so far from having been stopt by Authority (for which there could be no manner of Reason) that it is only postponed to a proper Time, when it is not doubted but the Town will be convinced how little that Performance agrees with the intolerable and scandalous Nonsense of this notorious Paper Pyrate.|$|E
25|$|When such a {{complete}} convulsion has shaken the State, and hardly left <b>any</b> <b>thing</b> whatsoever, either in civil arrangements, {{or in the}} Characters and disposition of men's minds, exactly where it was, whatever shall be settled although in the former persons and upon old forms, will be in some measure a new thing and will labour under something of the weakness {{as well as other}} inconveniences of a Change. My poor opinion is that you mean to establish what you call 'L'ancien Régime,' If any one means that system of Court Intrigue miscalled a Government as it stood, at Versailles before the present confusions as the thing to be established, that I believe will be found absolutely impossible; and if you consider the Nature, as well of persons, as of affairs, I flatter myself you must be of my opinion. That was tho' not so violent a State of Anarchy as well as the present. If it were even possible to lay things down exactly as they stood, before the series of experimental politicks began, I am quite sure that they could not long continue in that situation. In one Sense of L'Ancien Régime I am clear that nothing else can reasonably be done.|$|E
