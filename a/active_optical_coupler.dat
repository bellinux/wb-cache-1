40|$|The {{integration}} of optical micro-systems and high speed electronics {{has been of}} great interest {{in the last few}} years. Optical fibres offer attractive advantages for the transmission of information over distances, from a few centimetres up to some kilometres, but they also suffer from the accuracy requirements for the adjusting of coupling systems. In order to make more efficient, faster and smaller interconnects the application of MOEMS (Micro Opto-Electro-Mechanical Systems) to this type of communication systems is mandatory. In this thesis, the {{integration of}} micro-optical and electronic devices is investigated. The contributions of the author are: ­	Design of a novel optical micro-coupler: several mechanical and optical systems are embedded in a monolithic construction that facilitates the adjustment of the optical and electronic devices by using self-guiding structures. ­	Implementation of a simulation tool using the angular spectrum method: the propagation of plane waves between tilted planes described by Brenner [36] was implemented in order to predict the characteristics of the <b>optical</b> <b>coupler.</b> With regard to the simulations, the adjusting systems were designed and constructed, and the fabrication accuracies for the <b>optical</b> <b>coupler</b> were set. ­	Examination of GRIN-rod lenses properties: considering the focusing properties of this type of lenses, theoretical and laboratory results were compared in order to predict the improvement on the coupling efficiency by using the GRIN-rod lenses in the designed coupling concept. ­	Fabrication of the optical coupler: based on the design and simulation results the <b>optical</b> <b>coupler</b> was manufactured using plastic replication of metal masters. ­	Construction of an <b>active</b> <b>optical</b> cable (AOC) : the microelectronic systems for the integration with the manufactured <b>optical</b> <b>coupler</b> were designed and fabricated. ­	Design and construction of the integration system: a concept for the integration of the optical with the electronic systems was developed. The adjustment was simplified by including alignment structures {{in the design of the}} optical and electronic systems. ­	Design and construction of a high speed video transfer system: to test the optical systems, electronic boards were designed and manufactured. The characteristics of the electrical transmission lines are determined for the specific design, and some strategies to minimise negative effects inherent to the construction are suggested. ­	At the end of the thesis, some forward-looking models are presented, to show how the concept could be implemented in the future. ...|$|R

40|$|An {{optoelectronic}} system utilizes wavelength-dependent {{scattering of}} light {{for measuring the}} density and mass flow of a two-phase fluid in a pipe. The apparatus was invented for original use in measuring the mass flow of a two-phase cryogenic fluid (e. g., liquid hydrogen containing bubbles of hydrogen gas), but underlying principles of operation can readily be adapted to non-cryogenic two-phase fluids. The system (see figure) includes a laser module, which contains two or more laser diodes, each operating at a different wavelength. The laser module also contains beam splitters that combine the beams at the various wavelengths so as to produce two output beams, each containing all of the wavelengths. One of the multiwavelength output beams is sent, via a multimode fiberoptic cable, to a transmitting <b>optical</b> <b>coupler.</b> The other multiwavelength output beam is sent, via another multimode fiber-optic cable, to a reference detector module, wherein fiber-optic splitters split the light into several multiwavelength beams, each going to a photodiode having a spectral response that is known and that differs from the spectral responses of the other photodiodes. The outputs of these photodiodes are digitized and fed to a processor, which executes an algorithm that utilizes the known spectral responses to convert the photodiode outputs to obtain reference laser-power levels for the various wavelengths. The transmitting <b>optical</b> <b>coupler</b> is mounted in (and sealed to) {{a hole in the}} pipe and is oriented at a slant with respect to the axis of the pipe. The transmitting <b>optical</b> <b>coupler</b> contains a collimating lens and a cylindrical lens that form the light emerging {{from the end of the}} fiber-optic cable into a fan-shaped beam in a meridional plane of the pipe. Receiving <b>optical</b> <b>couplers</b> similar to the transmitting <b>optical</b> <b>couplers</b> are mounted in the same meridional plane at various longitudinal positions on the opposite side of the pipe, approximately facing the transmitting <b>optical</b> <b>coupler</b> along the same slant. Light collected by each receiving <b>optical</b> <b>coupler</b> is sent, via a multimode fiber-optic cable, to a detector module similar to the reference detector module. The outputs of the photodiodes in each detector module are digitized and processed, similarly to those of the reference detector module, to obtain indications of the amounts of light of each wavelength scattered to the corresponding receiving position. The value for each wavelength at each position is also normalized to the reference laser-power level for that wavelength. From these normalized values, the density and the mass flow rate of the fluid are estimated...|$|R

40|$|A four-pass <b>optical</b> <b>coupler</b> affords {{increased}} (in {{comparison with}} related prior two-pass <b>optical</b> <b>couplers)</b> utilization of light {{generated by a}} laser diode in side pumping of a solid-state laser slab. The original application for which this coupler was conceived involves a neodymium-doped yttrium aluminum garnet (Nd:YAG) crystal slab, which, when pumped by a row of laser diodes at a wavelength of 809 nm, lases at a wavelength of 1, 064 nm. Heretofore, typically, a thin laser slab has been pumped in two passes, the second pass occurring by virtue of reflection of pump light from a highly reflective thin film on the side opposite the side through which the pump light enters. In two-pass pumping, a Nd:YAG slab having a thickness of 2 mm (which is typical) absorbs about 84 percent of the 809 -nm pump light power, leaving about 16 percent of the pump light power to travel back toward the laser diodes. This unused power can cause localized heating of the laser diodes, thereby reducing their lifetimes. Moreover, if the slab is thinner than 2 mm, then even more unused power travels back toward the laser diodes. The four-pass <b>optical</b> <b>coupler</b> captures most of this unused pump light and sends {{it back to the}} laser slab for two more passes. As a result, the slab absorbs more pump light, as though it were twice as thick. The gain and laser cavity beam quality of a smaller laser slab in conjunction with this <b>optical</b> <b>coupler</b> can thus be made comparable to those of a larger two-pass-pumped laser slab...|$|R
