5|$|Archaeologists {{divide the}} pre-European American contact {{period of the}} region into three {{cultural}} phases. The Crane Flat phase lasted from 1000BCE to 500CE and is marked by hunting with the atl atl <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>use</b> of grinding stones. The Tarmarack phase lasted from 500 until 1200, marked by a shift to using smaller rock points, indicating {{development and use of}} the bow and arrow. The Mariposa phase lasted from 1200 until contact with European Americans.|$|E
5|$|As {{feathers}} grow at variable rates, these variations lead to visible {{dark and}} light bands in the fully formed feather. These so-called growth bars and their widths {{have been used to}} determine the daily nutritional status of birds. Each light and dark bar correspond to around 24 hours <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>use</b> of this technique has been called ptilochronology (analogous to dendrochronology).|$|E
5|$|Aspects of Raonic's game {{which have}} been criticized include his return of serve, quickness and mobility, backhand, short game, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>use</b> of {{backspin}} or sidespin. His above-average height—196cm (6ft 5in)—is linked to his strong serve, but is said to limit his movement around the court.|$|E

5|$|Chopin's mazurkas and waltzes {{are all in}} {{straightforward}} ternary or episodic form, {{sometimes with}} a coda. The mazurkas often show more folk features than many of his other works, sometimes including modal scales and harmonies <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>use</b> of drone basses. However, some also show unusual sophistication, for example Op.63 No.3, which includes a canon at one beat's distance, a great rarity in music.|$|E

5|$|During the 1593 Siege of Pyongyang, 40,000 Ming troops {{deployed}} {{a variety}} of cannon against Japanese troops. Despite their defensive advantage <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>use</b> of arquebus by Japanese soldiers, the Japanese were at a severe disadvantage due to their lack of cannon. Throughout the Japanese invasions of Korea (1592–98), the Ming-Joseon coalition used artillery widely in land and naval battles, including on the turtle ships of Yi Sun-sin.|$|E
