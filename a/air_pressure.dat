5|$|The lip {{position}} and pressure, shaping of the vocal tract, choice of reed and mouthpiece, amount of <b>air</b> <b>pressure</b> created, and evenness of the airflow account {{for most of}} the clarinetist's ability to control the tone of a clarinet. A highly skilled clarinetist will provide the ideal lip and <b>air</b> <b>pressure</b> for each frequency (note) being produced. They will have an embouchure which places an even pressure across the reed by carefully controlling their lip muscles. The airflow will also be carefully controlled by using the strong stomach muscles (as opposed to the weaker and erratic chest muscles) and they will use the diaphragm to oppose the stomach muscles to achieve a tone softer than a forte rather than weakening the stomach muscle tension to lower <b>air</b> <b>pressure.</b> Their vocal tract will be shaped to resonate at frequencies associated with the tone being produced.|$|E
5|$|Altimeter {{setting is}} a term and {{quantity}} used in aviation. The regional or local <b>air</b> <b>pressure</b> at mean sea level is called the altimeter setting, and the pressure which will calibrate the altimeter to show the height above ground at a given QNH airfield.|$|E
30|$|For {{experimental}} tests, we employed an {{air compressor}} (JUN-AIR 3 - 4) and an electro-pneumatic regulator (SMC ITV 2030) to provide constant <b>air</b> <b>pressures.</b> We experimentally tested {{the performance of}} different actuators under different <b>air</b> <b>pressures</b> and different soft grippers grasping the paper container filled with food materials.|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} the effect of the changes that occur in the leg muscle activity of unstable surface with different levels of <b>air</b> <b>pressures.</b> Three groups of college students have been placed randomly on unstable surfaces with different <b>air</b> <b>pressures</b> at group 1. 0 psi (n 1 = 36), group 1. 4 psi (n 2 = 40), and group 1. 8 psi (n 3 = 40). Using surface electromyography, the recruitment of the tibialis anterior, peroneus longus, and the gastrocnemius was measured. Maximal voluntary isometric contraction was measured at the different <b>air</b> <b>pressures</b> based on the manual muscle test, then normalizing the value to %maximal voluntary isometric contraction (%MVIC). The tibialis anterior muscle activity was significant change from the unstable surface with difference levels of <b>air</b> <b>pressures</b> between group 1. 0 psi and 1. 8 psi and between group 1. 4 psi and 1. 8 psi. peroneus longus muscle activity was significan...|$|R

5|$|Station model plots use {{an internationally}} {{accepted}} coding convention {{that has changed}} little since August 1, 1941. Elements in the plot show the key weather elements, including temperature, dew point, wind, cloud cover, <b>air</b> <b>pressure,</b> pressure tendency, and precipitation.|$|E
5|$|The {{atmosphere}} on Mir {{was similar}} to Earth's. Normal <b>air</b> <b>pressure</b> on the station was 101.3kPa (14.7psi); the same as at sea level on Earth. An Earth-like atmosphere offers benefits for crew comfort, and is much safer than the alternative, a pure oxygen atmosphere, because of increased fire risk such as occurred with Apollo 1.|$|E
5|$|The organ {{has four}} manuals, 88speaking stops and 4565pipes. It works {{by way of}} <b>air</b> <b>pressure,</b> {{controlled}} by an electric current and operated by the keys of the organ console; this opens and closes valves within the wind chests, allowing the pipes to speak. This type of motion is called electro-pneumatic action.|$|E
50|$|<b>Air</b> <b>pressures</b> for the jet usually {{vary from}} 60 to 100 psig (4-7 bar). The carbon {{electrode}} {{can be worn}} away by oxidation from heat buildup. This can be reduced by coating the carbon electrodes with copper.|$|R
50|$|Haldane pioneered {{study of}} the {{reaction}} of the body to low <b>air</b> <b>pressures,</b> such as that experienced at high altitudes. He led an expedition to Pike's Peak in 1911, which examined the effect of low atmospheric pressure on respiration.|$|R
5000|$|Standard {{isobaric}} surfaces: the height, temperature, dewpoint depression, wind speed, {{and wind}} direction at the surface, and {{at where the}} following <b>air</b> <b>pressures</b> are found as the dropsonde is descending: 1000, 925, 850, 700, 500, 400, 300, 250 hectopascals (hPa).|$|R
5|$|After takeoff, Cooper told Mucklow to {{join the}} rest of the crew in the cockpit and remain there with the door closed. As she complied, Mucklow {{observed}} Cooper tying something around his waist. At approximately 8:00pm, a warning light flashed in the cockpit, indicating that the aft airstair apparatus had been activated. The crew's offer of assistance via the aircraft's intercom system was curtly refused. The crew soon noticed a subjective change of <b>air</b> <b>pressure,</b> indicating that the aft door was open.|$|E
5|$|Although Fran passed {{near the}} Azores as a hurricane, winds {{on the islands}} only reached 45mph (75km/h) and no damage was recorded. On October12, a French ship {{encountered}} the storm, recording sustained winds of 40mph (65km/h) and an <b>air</b> <b>pressure</b> of 981mbar (hPa; 28.97inHg). Ships near the English and French coastlines recorded winds up to 60mph (95km/h) as the extratropical remnants of Fran passed through the region.|$|E
5|$|Although {{extrapolated}} {{peak maximum}} sustained winds based on whatever reports are available exist for every storm in 1860, estimated minimum central barometric <b>air</b> <b>pressure</b> listings are only {{present for the}} three storms that made landfall in the United States. As the three landfalling storms moved inland, information on their meteorological dissipation was limited. As a result, the intensity of these storms after landfall and until dissipation {{is based on an}} inland decay model developed in 1995 to predict the deterioration of inland hurricanes.|$|E
50|$|Aerosinusitis, {{also called}} barosinusitis, sinus squeeze or sinus {{barotrauma}} is a painful inflammation and sometimes bleeding of the membrane of the paranasal sinus cavities, normally the frontal sinus. It {{is caused by}} a difference in <b>air</b> <b>pressures</b> inside and outside the cavities.|$|R
5000|$|Early {{aircraft}} {{had a few}} sensors. [...] "Steam gauges" [...] converted <b>air</b> <b>pressures</b> into needle deflections {{that could}} be interpreted as altitude and airspeed. A magnetic compass provided a sense of direction. The displays to the pilot were as critical as the measurements.|$|R
40|$|A {{positive}} streamer {{in a weak}} {{electric field}} in <b>air</b> at ground <b>pressure</b> is investigated by utilizing a recently developed photoionization model based on the radiative transfer theory. The modeling results on the streamer emissions demonstrate that blue emissions of the second positive band system of N 2 dominate the streamer spectra, in contrast to streamers in predominately red sprite discharges observed at low <b>air</b> <b>pressures</b> at high altitudes in the Earth's atmosphere...|$|R
5|$|Evidence {{suggests}} that barotrauma is causing bat fatalities around wind turbines. Bats have typical mammalian lungs, which {{are thought to}} be more sensitive to sudden <b>air</b> <b>pressure</b> changes than the lungs of birds, making them more liable to fatal rupture. In addition, {{it has been suggested that}} bats are attracted to these structures, perhaps seeking roosts, and thereby increasing the death rate. Acoustic deterrents may help to reduce bat mortality at wind farms.|$|E
5|$|General {{aviation}} {{activities at the}} airport gradually increased. In the early 1960s, sailplanes became popular at the airport. The aerodrome is located with good wind and <b>air</b> <b>pressure</b> conditions for sailplane flying, and Oslo Flyklubb stationed two of its sailplanes at Tuven. Ronald Stensrud established a pilot school in 1966, but was forced to close after failing to make ends meet.|$|E
5|$|In September 2014, Elgato {{announced}} a home monitoring system called Eve, which monitors a home's <b>air</b> <b>pressure,</b> water usage, temperature, air quality and other factors. Elgato said the product won't be available until the HomeKit software, {{which is expected}} to come with Apple iOS 8, is released. It also introduced smart light bulbs, which communicate with iOS devices through Bluetooth and allow users to adjust home lighting from their mobile device.|$|E
40|$|This work covers {{energy and}} exergy, and exergoeconomic and {{environmental}} of a Combined Cycle Power Plant (CCPP). To assess {{the effects of}} <b>air</b> compressor <b>pressure</b> ratio on efficiency, economic and environment of the system a parametric study is performed. To have reasonable results, the <b>air</b> compressor <b>pressure</b> ratio is varied while all other design parameters are kept constant. Results show by increasing the <b>air</b> compressor <b>pressure</b> ratio the exergy efficiency of gas cycle is increased while the total efficiency is reduced. Consequence, the total cost and CO 2 emission are increased...|$|R
40|$|An {{experimental}} {{evaluation of}} main shaft seals for helicopter gas turbine engines {{was conducted with}} shaft speeds to 213 m/s(700 ft/sec), <b>air</b> <b>pressures</b> to 148 N/sq cm (215 psia), and air temperatures to 645 K (675 F). Gas leakage test results indicate that conventional seals will not be satisfactory for high-pressure sealing because of excessive leakage. The self-acting face seal, however, had significantly lower leakage and operated with insignificant wear during a 150 -hour endurance test at sliding speeds to 145 m/s (475 ft/sec), <b>air</b> <b>pressures</b> to 124 N/sq cm (180 psia), and air temperatures to 408 K (275 F). Wear measurements indicate that noncontact operation was achieved at shaft speeds of 43, 000 rpm. Evaluation of the self-acting circumferential seal was inconclusive because of seal dimensional variations...|$|R
40|$|This study {{presents}} a double-side diaphragm peristaltic pump for efficient medium transport without the unwanted backflow and the lagging {{effect of a}} diaphragm. A theoretical model was derived to predict the important parameter of the micropump, i. e., {{the motion of the}} valves at large deformations, for a variety of <b>air</b> <b>pressures.</b> Accordingly, we proposed an easy and robust design to fabricate a Polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) -based micropump. The theoretical model agrees with a numerical model and experimental data for the deformations of the PDMS membrane. Furthermore, variations of the generated flow rate, including pneumatic frequencies, actuated <b>air</b> <b>pressures,</b> and operation modes were evaluated experimentally for the proposed micropumps. In future, the theoretical equation could provide the optimal parameters for the scientists working on the fabrication of the diaphragm peristaltic pump for applications of cell-culture...|$|R

Ordinary urban buildings experiencing it will be crushed, toppled, or gutted {{by the force of}} <b>air</b> <b>pressure.</b> The picture at right shows the effects of a nuclear-bomb-generated 5 psi pressure wave on a test structure in Nevada in 1953.|$|E
5|$|When Karl {{became a}} {{hurricane}} on November 25, the 1980 season became notable for having two November hurricanes; {{the other was}} Jeanne. This tied 1932 and 1969 for {{the record of the}} most November hurricanes, which was later accomplished during the 1994 season. Later, 2001 broke this record with three hurricanes. The cyclone never affected land, and as a result, no deaths or damages occurred. One ship to the northwest of Karl's center recorded 35mph (55km/h) winds and an <b>air</b> <b>pressure</b> of 993 mbar.|$|E
5|$|A {{more recent}} {{development}} is the electric action which uses low voltage DC to control the key and/or stop mechanisms. Electricity may control the action indirectly through <b>air</b> <b>pressure</b> valves (pneumatics), {{in which case the}} action is electro-pneumatic. In such actions, an electromagnet attracts a small pilot valve which lets wind go to a bellows ("pneumatic") which opens the pallet. When electricity operates the action directly without the assistance of pneumatics, it is commonly referred to as direct electric action. In this type, the electromagnet's armature carries a disc pallet.|$|E

5|$|A {{pneumothorax}} (collapsed lung) is {{an abnormal}} collection of {{air in the}} pleural space that causes an uncoupling of the lung from the chest wall. The lung cannot expand against the <b>air</b> <b>pressure</b> inside the pleural space. An easy to understand example is a traumatic pneumothorax, where air enters the pleural space from outside the body, as occurs with puncture to the chest wall. Similarly, a scuba diver ascending while holding their breath with their lungs fully inflated can cause air sacs (alveoli) to burst and leak high pressure air into the pleural space.|$|E
5|$|A {{station model}} is a {{symbolic}} illustration showing the weather occurring at a given reporting station. Meteorologists created the station model to plot a number of weather elements in a small space on weather maps. Maps filled with dense station-model plots {{can be difficult to}} read, but they allow meteorologists, pilots, and mariners to see important weather patterns. A computer draws a station model for each observation location. The station model is primarily used on surface-weather maps, but {{can also be used to}} show the weather aloft. A completed station-model map allows users to analyze patterns in <b>air</b> <b>pressure,</b> temperature, wind, cloud cover, and precipitation.|$|E

40|$|The {{aerodynamic}} {{forces on}} bodies of arbitrary shape were investigated under conditions {{such that the}} mean free path of the air molecule {{is greater than the}} dimensions of the body. <b>Air</b> <b>pressures</b> and friction forces were calculated from gas kinetic theory for surfaces facing both toward and away from the air stream at any angle. Air forces for an atmosphere of definite composition (molecular hydrogen) were calculated {{as a function of the}} flight velocity. The results indicate that the friction stresses between the air and the body surface are of the same magnitude as the dynamic pressure and as the <b>air</b> <b>pressures</b> normal to the surface. The application of the general method to the specific cases such as thin airfoils and projectiles leads to high drag coefficients and poor glide ratios even for the theoretically best wing sections...|$|R
