The SR209 designation then made a right turn onto Cañon Street, curved to the southeast, and went downhill to the bayside location of the old La Playa Trail. At the intersection with Rosecrans Street, the designation made a turn to the northeast at a right angle onto Rosecrans.|$|E

5|$|In 1956, MD32 was {{extended}} east on Guilford Road from US1 to the Howard Anne Arundel county line at Annapolis Junction. The state highway was relocated to its present alignment from Glenelg to Clarksville between 1961 and 1964, bypassing Ten Oaks Road. MD32 was expanded to a four-lane divided highway in West Friendship when its interchange with I-70 was reconstructed as a diamond interchange in 1973. MD32 {{was extended}} east into Anne Arundel County in 1969 when the designation {{was extended to}} {{just east of the}} BaltimoreWashington Parkway on the edge of Fort George G. Meade. The first two sections of what would become the Patuxent Freeway opened in 1972. A short section of divided highway opened from just west of Oakland Mills Road in Guilford to <b>a</b> <b>turnaround</b> just west of Vollmerhausen Road that included MD32's modern interchange with I-95. The other section was a two-lane road from MD175 in Odenton northeast along Sappington Station Road and then east along the current alignments of MD32 and I-97 to MD178 just east of I-97 Exit 5 in Crownsville. The eastern section, which from 1972 to 1977 was one of the three disjoint sections of mainline MD32 between Crownsville and Taneytown, included an interchange with MD3 in Millersville. As of 1978, MD32's interchange with the BaltimoreWashington Parkway was a partial cloverleaf interchange with four ramps {{on the north side of}} MD32due to the state highway closely paralleling the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad's spur to the military baseand a fifth ramp from the northbound Parkway to eastbound MD32. The MD3 interchange included the ramps to and from MD32 in the direction of Fort Meade plus a ramp from westbound MD32 to northbound MD3.
