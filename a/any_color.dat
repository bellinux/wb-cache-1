Germany won the most medals overall with 36, of which 12 were gold. Host nation the United States won 34 medals, 10 of them gold. Athletes from 24 of the 77 {{participating}} NOCs won at least one medal; and competitors from 18 won at least one gold medal. Athletes from Australia and China won their respective nations' first Winter Olympic gold medals, while the Croatian and Estonian delegations each won their first Winter Olympic medals of <b>any</b> <b>color.</b> Of the 407 medalists, 55 athletes won more than one medal of <b>any</b> <b>color</b> at the Games.

5|$|All colors {{other than}} Appaloosa are allowed for registration. Welara Sport Ponies {{may be of}} <b>any</b> <b>color</b> or size, without the {{restrictions}} of the purebred Welara. The mix of Arabian and Welsh blood gives the breed refinement, spirit and hardiness, as well as good movement. The head is small and slightly , the neck is arched (and prone to be cresty in stallions). The shoulders and croup are long and the back short. Welaras are used mainly in English riding, especially in hunter classes. They are also seen in show jumping, three-day eventing, pleasure driving and as general leisure riding horses. Welara/Thoroughbred crosses are popular mounts for riders competing in hunter and jumper classes.|$|E
5|$|The {{outside of}} the mantle may be <b>any</b> <b>color,</b> {{typically}} red, while the inside is white or sometimes yellow to distinguish it from a secular mantle. David Johnson suggested that the mantle of all bishops should be white inside, excepting only patriarchs who use ermine, to indicate that all bishops are equally bishops. Above the mantle is a mitre (of the Eastern style) between a processional cross and a crosier. The earliest examples of the arms of Orthodox hierarchs have the cross to the dexter of the mitre and the bishop's staff to sinister, but opposite examples exist. An abbot (archimandrite or hegumen) should display a veiled abbot's staff to distinguish it from the bishop's staff.|$|E

We show that for any integers r, g≥ 2 there is an r-uniform hypergraph of girth at least g such that in <b>any</b> <b>coloring</b> of its vertices there is either a monochromatic or a rainbow (totally multicolored) edge.
