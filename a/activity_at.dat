5|$|A recent calm period, {{with almost}} no {{earthquake}} or magmatic <b>activity</b> <b>at</b> Hualālai, has seen the growth of homes, businesses, and resorts on the mountain's flanks. The most recent major <b>activity</b> <b>at</b> the volcano was in 1929, when an intense earthquake swarm rocked Hualālai, most likely caused by magmatic action near the volcano's peak. Although it has been relatively placid in the recent past, Hualālai is still potentially active, {{and is expected to}} erupt again within the next 100years.|$|E
5|$|During December 1965, more {{submarine}} activity occurred 0.9km (0.56mi) {{southwest of}} Surtsey, and another island was formed. It was named Jólnir, {{and over the}} following eight months it appeared and disappeared several times, as wave erosion and volcanic activity alternated in dominance. <b>Activity</b> <b>at</b> Jólnir was much weaker than the <b>activity</b> <b>at</b> the main vent, and even weaker than that seen at Syrtlingur, but the island eventually grew to a maximum size of 70m (230ft) in height, covering an area of , during July and early August 1966. Like Syrtlingur, though, after activity ceased on 8 August 1966, it was rapidly eroded, and dropped below sea level during October 1966.|$|E
5|$|Eruptive <b>activity</b> <b>at</b> Mentolat {{has been}} ongoing since the Pleistocene, with the {{earliest}} explosive eruptions occurring over 17,340 years ago.

At {{the same time the}} Post-Olympics Use Committee was established to ensure <b>activity</b> <b>at</b> the venues after the Olympics.

5|$|Calabozos {{is similar}} in age to Cerro Azul and Descabezado Grande, and its eruptions may {{correspond}} to past <b>activity</b> <b>at</b> both volcanoes. Eruption products of very similar composition (including mafic andesite, agglutinates, and dacite) make up the volcanoes. There is also a similarity in size (all are between 40 and 70 cubic kilometers in volume).|$|E
5|$|Eruptive {{activity}} in the Mount Cayley volcanic field is typical of past volcanism elsewhere in the Garibaldi Belt. Large earthquakes would occur under the volcanic field weeks to years in advance as molten rock intrudes through the Earth's rocky lithosphere. The extent of earthquakes and the local seismographs in this region would warn the Geological Survey of Canada and possibly cause an upgrade in monitoring. While molten rock breaks through the crust, {{the size of the}} volcano vulnerable to an eruption would probably swell and the area would rupture, creating much more hydrothermal <b>activity</b> <b>at</b> the regional hot springs and the formation of new springs or fumaroles. Small and probably significant rock avalanches may result and could dam the nearby Squamish River for a limited amount of time, such as those that occurred in the past without seismic activity and deformation related to magmatic <b>activity.</b> <b>At</b> some point the subsurface magma will produce phreatic eruptions and lahars. At this time Highway 99 would be out of service and the residents of Squamish would have to travel away from the eruptive zone.|$|E
