5|$|By {{the close}} of the first day, the 7th Army was still largely mobilising and concentrating, and fifth column actions meant that nearly all the {{fighting}} was conducted by border troops. The 38th Infantry Division Dravska was deployed along the southern bank of the Drava, with the 128th Infantry Regiment and <b>an</b> <b>artillery</b> battalion around Ptuj, the 45th Infantry Regiment and <b>an</b> <b>artillery</b> battalion around Maribor and the 112th Infantry Regiment and <b>an</b> <b>artillery</b> battalion were at Slovenj Gradec and marching east towards Dravograd. German and Italian air attacks interfered with the deployment of troops and command was hampered by reliance on civilian telegraph and telephone services.|$|E
5|$|Dartmouth Castle is <b>an</b> <b>artillery</b> fort, {{built to}} protect Dartmouth harbour in Devon, England. The {{earliest}} {{parts of the}} castle date from the 1380s, when, {{in response to the}} threat of a French attack, the civic authorities created a small enclosure castle overlooking the mouth of the Dart estuary. This was intended to engage enemy ships with catapults and possibly early cannon, and incorporated the local chapel of Saint Petroc within its walls. At the end of the 15th century, the castle was expanded with <b>an</b> <b>artillery</b> tower and an iron chain which could be stretched across the harbour to a tower at Godmerock; this addition formed the oldest known purpose-built coast artillery fort in Britain. Further gun batteries were added during the French invasion scare of the 1540s.|$|E
5|$|New Western Tower (or the Great Tower), {{built in}} 1544 and {{which served as}} a bastion. The tower {{contained}} one of the castle's printing presses, and also provided <b>an</b> <b>artillery</b> platform to cover the vast fields surrounding it. It was damaged in a severe storm in 2011.|$|E

5|$|The Panzerbeobachtungswagen IV (Pz.Beob.Wg.IV) was <b>an</b> <b>artillery</b> {{observation}} vehicle {{built on}} the Panzer IV chassis.

5|$|The chassis {{was used}} for both a command tank (Panzerbefehlswagen 35(t)) which {{featured}} extra radios (20 built) and also as <b>an</b> <b>artillery</b> tractor (Artillerie Schlepper 35(t)) by removing the turret and upper hull and covering the gap with canvas (49 converted from March 42 onwards).|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} day, Wolfe's troops {{landed on}} the south {{bank of the river}} at Point Levis, nearly directly across the river from Quebec; <b>an</b> <b>artillery</b> battery was established there in early July that nearly levelled the lower town by bombardment.|$|E

5|$|A famous story, {{possibly}} apocryphal, {{states that}} during the Battle of Princeton, when Alexander Hamilton, then the commander of <b>an</b> <b>artillery</b> battery, ordered his cannons to fire upon the British soldiers taking refuge in Nassau Hall, one of the cannonballs was shot through {{the head of the}} portrait of King George II that hung in the chapel, which was subsequently replaced with a portrait of George Washington.|$|E
5|$|Ali Abu Nuwar (surname also spelled Abu Nuwwar, Abu Nawar or Abu Nowar; 1925 – 15 August 1991) was a Jordanian army officer, {{serving as}} chief of staff in May 1956 – April 1957. He participated in the 1948 Arab–Israeli War as <b>an</b> <b>artillery</b> officer in the Jordanian army's predecessor, the Arab Legion, but his vocal {{opposition}} to British influence in Jordan led to his virtual exile to Paris as military attaché in 1952.

5|$|Around 1 p.m., from 150 to 170 Confederate guns began <b>an</b> <b>artillery</b> {{bombardment}} {{that was}} probably the largest of the war. In order to save valuable ammunition for the infantry attack that they knew would follow, the Army of the Potomac's artillery, under the command of Brig. Gen. Henry Jackson Hunt, at first did not return the enemy's fire. After waiting about 15 minutes, about 80 U.S. cannons added to the din. The Army of Northern Virginia was critically low on artillery ammunition, and the cannonade did not significantly affect the Union position.|$|E
5|$|Around midday the Germans {{opened up}} <b>an</b> <b>artillery</b> and mortar barrage that caused {{casualties}} among the ridge's defenders and lasted {{for the entire}} afternoon. At about the same time, Kampfgruppe Weidinger seized an important road junction northeast of Coudehard. Several units of the 10th SS, 12th SS, and 116th Panzer Divisions managed to clear a corridor past Point 262N, and by mid afternoon about 10,000 German troops had passed out of the pocket.|$|E
5|$|At 05:45, Lieutenant-Colonel Mehmet Sefik of the Turkish 27th Infantry Regiment {{received}} {{orders to}} move his 1st and 3rd Battalions {{to the west and}} support the 2nd Battalion around Gaba Tepe. The two battalions were already assembled, having spent that night carrying out military exercises. They could not be sent to Ari Burnu as it was not marked on the Turkish maps. Colonel Halil Sami, commanding the 9th Division, also ordered the division's machine-gun company and <b>an</b> <b>artillery</b> battery to move in support of the 27th Infantry Regiment, followed soon after by an 77mm artillery battery. At 08:00 Lieutenant-Colonel Mustafa Kemal, commanding the 19th Division, was ordered to send a battalion to support them. Kemal instead decided to go himself with the 57th Infantry Regiment and <b>an</b> <b>artillery</b> battery towards Chunuk Bair, which he realised was the key point in the defence; whoever held those heights would dominate the battlefield. By chance, the 57th Infantry were supposed to have been on an exercise that morning around Hill 971 and had been prepared since 05:30, waiting for orders.|$|E

5|$|At 1:55p.m., {{just before}} the start of the war, a {{reconnaissance}} force swam to the east bank of the Suez Canal, two kilometers south of Fort Lahtzanit, and laid two ropes across the canal to facilitate the crossing of friendly forces. At 2:05p.m., as Operation Badr began, <b>an</b> <b>artillery</b> barrage was initiated against the fort using just the 85mm guns and B-10 recoilless rifles of the brigade's anti-tank company; the use of high trajectory artillery guns was forbidden since a number of Egyptian aircraft were flying over this area.|$|E
5|$|By 1944, the Free Belgian {{forces in}} the United Kingdom {{numbered}} some 4,500 men.

5|$|Calshot Castle is <b>an</b> <b>artillery</b> fort {{constructed}} by Henry VIII on the Calshot Spit, Hampshire, England, between 1539 and 1540. It formed {{part of the}} King's Device programme to protect against invasion from France and the Holy Roman Empire and defend Southampton Water as it met the Solent. The castle had a keep at its centre, surrounded by a curtain wall and a moat. Initially heavily armed, it had a garrison of 16 men {{and as many as}} 36 artillery guns. The castle continued in use for many years, surviving the English Civil War intact and being extensively modernised in the 1770s. During the 19th century, Calshot Castle was used by the coastguard as a base for combating smuggling. In 1894, however, fresh fears of a French invasion led to it being brought back into use as <b>an</b> <b>artillery</b> fort: a large coastal battery was constructed alongside the older castle and a boom built across Southampton Water, controlled from the castle.|$|E
