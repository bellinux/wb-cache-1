40|$|Head {{stabilization}} {{is fundamental}} for many animals survival. Its posture {{and the way}} it compensates the movements of {{the other part of the}} body as the torso, especially during everyday basic movements like walking or running, are crucial to give a stable reference frame for the two essential perceptual systems for detection of self-motion relative to space: the visual and vestibular systems. Vision is the most useful sensor for many animals to provide information about the surrounding environment and is an important function for protection from enemies. The vestibular informations operate to create an inertial guidance system determining the spatial orientation in order to coordinate movements and balance. Another advantage of head stabilization during movements and locomotion is in maintaining gaze stability and preserving visual acuity. The head/trunk coordination helps the interpretation of the inputs from the sensors, as the visual and vestibular receptors are stimulated as soon as the head moves, in order to maintain equilibrium while standing or walking. In vestibular injured patients however, this compensation was not observed. This brought to understand the role of the vestibular information for the head stabilization and the existence of the vestibulocollic reflex (VCR), a reflex loop wich stabilize the head in the inertial space. This works is based on the analysis and the study of the existent models of this mechanism, both the biological ones and the robotic ones and presents a new bio-inspired controller for the iCub robot head based on above-mentioned study. In particular, the Recurrent Architecture was employed wich is inspired by the recurrent connection found in the cerebellum and so it is a good candidate to simulate the role of the cerebellum and its plasticity in the learning process. The structure is as an adaptive filter. In the cerebellar modelisation, the inputs of the system (Figure 1) (represented by the vector y) are carried by MossyFibers (MF), which converge in the Granule Cells (GC). Each GC receives input from several MFs and from recurrent connections (not shown) and its output is distributed along a Parallel Fiber (PF). Attached to the bundle of PFs there are Purkinje Cells (PC). Each PC receives input from all the PFs and receives an additional input from a Climbing Fiber (CF). This additional input is assumed to act as a teaching signal ii Figure 1 : Schematic diagram of the organization of the cerebellar microcircuit (taken from Porril et al. 2004) for the weights wij of the PC-PF synapse. If we see the model as an adaptive filter, GC are modelled as filters with transfer function Gi and PC perform a weighted sum of signals pi carried by Parallel Fibers. The learning algorithm used in this approach is the decorrelation control, implemented in the cerebellum block. The sensory error here is due to a incorrect motor response: when there is no more correlation between the two cerebellar input (sensory error and efferent motor copy) the learning stops because is no more possible reducing the sensory error. In decorrelation control, mossy-fibre inputs are predictor variables, to be decorrelated from the target determined by the CF signal, processing of the MF input y(t) by the granule cell layer is meant as analysis by a bank of linear filters Gi so that the PFs carry signals pi(t) = Giy(t). PC output is modelled as z(t) = ∑ wi ∗ pi(t) of these PF inputs, so the PC implements a linear filter C = ∑ wi ∗ Gi. The CF input is interpreted as a training signal e(t), which adapts synaptic weights using learning rule δwi = −β ∗ e ∗ pi. Using this architecture in the cerebellar block in Figure 2 was possible to create a controller for the head of humanoid robot iCub really biologically inspired. Like the human head with its vestibular system, iCub head own an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) wich is able to sense the linear acceleration and the angular velocities around the three axes. Using the iCub kinematics and dynamics and the cerebellar architecture described above was possible to implement in Matlab Simulink the controller. This model has as input the angular velocities of the head, more precisely the difference between a reference velocity and the one estimated by the cerebellum. The Inverse Jacobian transforms the command from the operative space to the joint space and it goes as input to the robot. The error used as a teaching signal is the velocity measured by the inertial sensor. The reference velocity vr is an estimation of the torso velocity obtained by the difference between the <b>angular</b> <b>pitch</b> velocity of the head and the one misured by the inertial sensor. iii Figure 2 : Block diagram of the model. The validation of the model has been tested on a single axis of rotation, in this case the pitch. It was done giving as a disturb for the system single sinusoids at different frequencies and also a sum of sinusoid. The range of frequency used is between 0. 1 and 1 Hz that is the oscillatory range of frequency distinctive of the locomotion with a time sampling of 100 Hz. In the figure 3 we can see in red the error decreasing fo both the single sinusoid and the sum and the head velocity compensates the torso. In this range the system converges. The convergence time is a parameter we used to verify the quality of the system. It represent the time needed to the system to reach a stabile condition. In this case it increase when the frequency of the disturbs increase, but, at a given frequency, it results more or less the same for al the weights. Head pitch velocity compensates the torso pitch velocity, as happen in human body trough the VCR action. a) b) Figure 3 : Head and torso angular velocities and error for a single sinusoid input at 1 Hz a and for a sum of sinusoids b). The system was trained with a sum of sinusoid for 100 s. The coefficients of the weights obtained after the training (figure 4) were used to set the coefficient of a new session. Simulating the system with a single sinusoid at 0. 5 Hz in input, we can notice that system is stabilised faster and reach easily the convergence. (Figure 5) iv Figure 4 : The evolution of the weights during the training set In conclusion, a bionspired controller, working in velocity, has been implemented and tested and we demonstrate it is able to stabilize the head when an external disturb occour.

The readout strips {{have a special}} zigzag geometry and run along the radial direction with an azimuthal pitch of 1. 37 mrad to measure the azimuthal phi-coordinate of incident particles. The zigzag geometry of the readout reduces the required number of electronic channels {{by a factor of}} three compared to conventional straight readout strips while preserving good angular resolution. The average crosstalk between zigzag strips is measured to be an acceptable 5. 5 %. The detection efficiency of the detector is (98. 4 +- 0. 2) %. When the non-linearity of the zigzag-strip response is corrected with track information, the angular resolution is measured to be (193 +- 3) urad, which corresponds to 14 % of the <b>angular</b> strip <b>pitch.</b> Multiple Coulomb scattering effects are fully taken into account in the data analysis {{with the help of a}} stand-alone Geant 4 simulation that estimates interpolated track errors.

40|$|We {{study the}} {{position}} sensitivity of radial zigzag strips intended to read out large GEM detectors for tracking at future experiments. Zigzag strips can cover a readout area with fewer strips than regular straight strips while maintaining good spatial resolution. Consequently, they {{can reduce the}} number of required electronic channels and related cost for large-area GEM detector systems. A non-linear relation between incident particle position and hit position measured from charge sharing among zigzag strips was observed in a previous study. We significantly reduce this non-linearity by improving the interleaving of adjacent physical zigzag strips. Zigzag readout structures are implemented on PCBs and on a flexible foil and are tested using a 10 cm by 10 cm triple-GEM detector scanned with a strongly collimated X-ray gun on a 2 D motorized stage. Angular resolutions of 60 - 84 urad are achieved with a 1. 37 mrad <b>angular</b> strip <b>pitch</b> at a radius of 784 mm. On a linear scale this corresponds to resolutions below 100 um.

40|$|Abstract. Using the multi-body {{simulation}} software SIMPACK as platform, a whole CHANGHE mini-car model was built. A fuzzy controller was adopted based on MATLAB/SIMULINK software {{to control the}} full car model. Pulse input running test simulation was carried out under co-simulation of SIMAT. The results showed that compared to passive suspension, with the speed 40 km/h, the body vertical acceleration, body <b>pitch</b> <b>angular</b> velocity, standard deviation and peak were respectively decreased by 10. 76 %, 18. 03 % and 20. 48 %, 12. 13 %. The semi-active suspension system with fuzzy controller had better performance than passive suspension, reduced vibration effectively and improved automotive ride comfort...|$|R
