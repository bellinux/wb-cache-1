40|$|The {{rainbow trout}} (Oncorhynchus mykiss) is {{considered}} {{as an important}} fish in the freshwater aquaculture and {{play a significant role}} in the human diet. The final quality of fish depends on the chemical and microbiological quality of fish at the time of freezing as well as on other factors including storage temperature and processing. The purpose of the study was to determine the microbiological status of 30 samples cooled and frozen trouts collected from <b>approved</b> <b>farm</b> in the Turiec region, territory of middle Slovakia. Total viable counts (TVCs), psychrotrophic bacteria, Pseudomonas spp. and also total volatile base-nitrogen (TVB-N) and pH were measured in samples of fresh (1. and 7. day of storage at 0 - 2 °C) and frozen whole trout and trout fillets. Frozen samples were stored at - 18 °C during 1, 3, and 6 months. Samples were collected from the skin, muscles (sterile) and muscles after filleting. The microbiological quality of samples varied between fresh and frozen (6 th month of storage) regarding TVCs and also between samples taken from the skin and muscles after filleting compared to muscle samples collected sterile regarding all tested bacteria. A large number of bacteria (pathogens and spoilage bacteria) enter with the raw material and in particular the skin contamination had a negative impact on the increase of microbial load in fillets. All processing techniques and procedures including filleting therefore must be designed and aimed to minimise contamination and growth of microorganisms in fish. However, based on the results of TVB-N analysis, differences between fresh and frozen samples were found, but all the samples were suitable for human consumption. <! [...] [endif] [...] ...|$|E

40|$|Milk {{quality is}} {{assessed}} using bulk milk analysis and by farm audits in the Netherlands. However, {{the extent of}} the effect that dairy farm audits have on milk quality is unknown. Data from over 13, 000 audits performed on 12, 855 dairy farms from February 2006 to April 2008 were merged with laboratory test results of 325, 150 bulk milk samples collected 6 mo before and after the audit. A linear mixed model with the method of restricted maximum likelihood was conducted to study whether the total bacterial counts (TBC) of bulk milk were lower during the periods before and after the dairy farm audit. Results showed that TBC values were 2 to 6 % lower (i. e., 0. 010 to 0. 026 log cfu/mL) for a period from 1. 5 to at least 6 mo after an audit. Additionally, several variables were significantly associated with bulk milk TBC values: seasonality, total number of attention points (given if some checklist points were not appropriate), audit type, audit result, and the categories milking equipment maintenance, and utility room-tank maintenance. The TBC values increased with a higher level of attention points. Furthermore, the farms rejected based on the audit results had the highest average TBC values and the <b>approved</b> <b>farms</b> had the lowest values. If dairy farms had an overall negative audit assessment and consequently needed a re-audit in the following year, the TBC values of bulk milk {{were more likely to be}} higher. Auditing may provide dairy farmers the opportunity to receive advice about factors that influence bulk milk TBC values, for a period of at least 6 mo following the audit.

40|$|To {{evaluate}} {{the occurrence of}} Toxoplasma gondii and to genetically characterize its isolates in carcasses of industrial fattening pigs, blood, diaphragm, and heart samples were collected from 375 carcasses of pigs slaughtered to be processed for Parma ham production. Pigs had been bred on <b>approved</b> <b>farms</b> (n = 75) located in the so-called Food Valley in Italy. Sera were examined for immunoglobulin G antibodies to T. gondii by modified agglutination test (MAT). Both heart and diaphragm samples from seropositive carcasses were processed {{for the presence of}} T. gondii DNA (B 1 locus) by real-time PCR and high resolution melting (HRM) assay. Anti-Toxoplasma antibodies were detected in 2. 1 % of pig carcasses, with titers from 1 : 10 to 1 : 320. T. gondii DNA was detected in all (eight) seropositive carcasses and in 11 (5 heart and 6 diaphragm samples) of 16 samples; that is, it was detected in heart tissue in two subjects, in diaphragm tissue in three subjects, and in both muscle tissues in three subjects. Toxoplasma genotypes were determined in seven of eight carcasses: type III was identified in four carcasses, type II in two, and both III and II in one carcass. The serological findings and the molecular detection of T. gondii strains suggest that cured meat products obtained from industrially bred pigs may be potential sources of toxoplasmosis for humans. Our results provide novel, important information regarding the seroprevalence and molecular prevalence of T. gondii in intensively reared pigs within this specific region of Italy, particularly because Parma ham from this region is known and consumed worldwide. On-farm preventive measures combined with slaughterhouse monitoring of carcasses of pigs bred for cured meat production should never be overlooked to prevent the introduction of T. gondii into the food chain and to ensure safety for consumers of these products...|$|R

40|$|The current {{increase}} in the organic agriculture sector {{has created a new}} market for fertilisers <b>approved</b> for organic <b>farming.</b> Off-farm N sources for organic farming are scarce considering the restriction on the use of chemical fertilisers. Thus, when some commercial products are allowed for organic agriculture, commercial opportunities became available. In this study we compare the behaviour of Vegethumus (Veg) and Phenix (Phe), which are two manures allowed for organic farming, with several other manures, ammonium nitrate (AN) and control treatments. A three year field trial and a pot experiment were carried out in order to estimate dry matter yield, N uptake, and N nutritional status of the crops, as well as soil N availability by using anion exchange membranes inserted into the soil. Apparent N recoveries in the field trial were 6. 3 % and 58. 2 % in Veg and AN plots, respectively, after the application of 380 kg N/ha in the previous 5 growing seasons. In the pot experiment the ANR of Veg and Phe were- 5. 0 % and 13. 6 %, respectively, while in AN pots it was 37. 1 %. The other organic manures used in the pot experiment gave higher apparent N recoveries than Veg and Phe if their C:N ratios or inorganic-N contents were taken into account.

40|$|The {{mandatory}} monitoring {{concept of}} offshore wind farm {{effects on the}} marine environment (StUK) prescribes extensive investigations on soft-bottom benthos and fouling assemblages of the wind turbine foundations. StUK and studies beyond StUK in the test field alpha ventus (North Sea, German Bight) were carried out to evaluate the German monitoring concept. Our investigations show a massive colonization of turbine foundations by fouling organisms and an aggregation of megafauna around constructions, both resulting in a local increase in biomass and species richness of the benthos, but no direct turbine effects on the soft-bottom benthos at the scale investigated. Temporal variations of sediment conditions and benthic communities were similar {{inside and outside the}} wind farm area. During the alpha ventus case-study, limits of benthic ecological studies according to StUK became evident and recommendations were elaborated for future improvements. Beyond our field studies, an aggregated database of StUK data from <b>approved</b> wind <b>farms</b> and data from scientific projects serves as the base for large scale ecosystem analysis.
