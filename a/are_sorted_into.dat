5|$|Aerophones, {{which produce}} a sound with a {{vibrating}} column of air; they <b>are</b> <b>sorted</b> <b>into</b> free aerophones {{such as a}} bullroarer or whip, which move freely through the air; flutes, which cause the air to pass over a sharp edge; reed instruments, which use a vibrating reed; and lip-vibrated aerophones such as trumpets, for which the lips themselves function as vibrating reeds.|$|E

5|$|Chordophones, {{which produce}} sound by {{vibrating}} {{one or more}} strings; they <b>are</b> <b>sorted</b> <b>into</b> according {{to the relationship between}} the string(s) and the sounding board or chamber. For example, if the strings are laid out parallel to the sounding board and there is no neck, the instrument is a zither whether it is plucked like an autoharp or struck with hammers like a piano. If the instrument has strings parallel to the sounding board or chamber and the strings extend past the board with a neck, then the instrument is a lute, whether the sound chamber is constructed of wood like a guitar or uses a membrane like a banjo.|$|E
5|$|In New York City, a {{group of}} {{teenagers}} audition to study at the High School of Performing Arts, where they <b>are</b> <b>sorted</b> <b>into</b> three different departments: Drama, Music and Dance. Accepted in the Drama department are Montgomery MacNeil, a closeted homosexual, Doris Finsecker, a shy Jewish girl, and Ralph Garci, who succeeds after failed auditions for Music and Dance. In the Music department, Bruno Martelli is an aspiring keyboardist whose electronic equipment horrifies Mr. Shorofsky, a conservative music teacher. Lisa Monroe is accepted in the Dance department, despite having {{no interest in the}} subject. Coco Hernandez is accepted in all three departments because of her all-around talent. Leroy Johnson goes to the school, performing as part of a dance routine for an auditioning friend, but the dance teachers are more impressed by his talents than hers.|$|E

To {{evaluate the}} residual effects of secondary task interactions on DRT RT, {{performance in the}} off-task segments of the drive <b>was</b> <b>sorted</b> <b>into</b> 3 -s bins relative to {{the time that the}} off-task interval began.

25|$|As {{another example}} of a divide and conquer {{algorithm}} that did not originally involve computers, Donald Knuth gives the method a post office typically uses to route mail: letters <b>are</b> <b>sorted</b> <b>into</b> separate bags for different geographical areas, each of these bags is itself sorted into batches for smaller sub-regions, and so on until they are delivered. This is related to a radix sort, described for punch-card sorting machines as early as 1929.|$|E

25|$|The {{families}} <b>are</b> <b>sorted</b> <b>into</b> {{a somewhat}} novel sequence unlike that in older works, where e.g. Corvidae are placed last. This is {{because so many}} reallocations have taken place since about 2005 that a definite taxonomy has not been established yet, although the phylogeny is by and large resolved. The present sequence {{is an attempt to}} preserve as much of the traditional sequence while giving priority to adequately addressing the phylogenetic relationships between the families. Based on John Boyd's Taxonomy in Flux Checklist 3.5.|$|E
25|$|Year 1 {{students}} <b>are</b> <b>sorted</b> <b>into</b> houses by class. In {{the early}} years of RI's history, there were ten houses, including a sixth Philips house (purple), later disbanded. House allocations used to be student-based, instead of class-based. Each House is led by a House Captain, a Year 4 student, who carries out his role along with the respective House Committee. The Houses participate in inter-house tournaments and activities, notably including the annual Inter-House Sports Carnival, Dramafeste and the Inter-House Debate tournament, with points earned from each activity contributing to the House Championship which is awarded {{at the end of the}} school year.|$|E
25|$|Trains <b>are</b> <b>sorted</b> <b>into</b> various {{categories}} that dictate {{the number of}} stops along their route, the priority they enjoy on the network, and the fare structure. Each express train is identified by a five-digit number, the first digit as 1 and 2 for long-distance Express trains. If the first digit is 0, then the train is a Special. The first digit as 5 denotes a passenger train. The second digit indicates the zone that operates the train, the third the division within the zone that controls the train and is responsible for its regular maintenance and cleanliness, and the last two digits are the train's serial number. The system was changed from four digits from 20 December 2010, to accommodate {{an increasing number of}} trains.|$|E

50|$|The 2nd {{part of this}} is {{the same}} as the 1st, but instead using numbers rather than shapes. For example, when the number 48 is displayed, it must <b>be</b> <b>sorted</b> <b>into</b> one {{category}} - this would <b>be</b> <b>sorted</b> <b>into</b> “0-250”. However, this exercise also develops as time passes; for example, if the sum of the digits of the number displayed is greater than 10, or if a particular digit appears twice in the given number, it must <b>be</b> <b>sorted</b> as if it were in the category “250-500”, and so forth.|$|R
25|$|Ballads {{dating back}} to the 15th century are the oldest {{existing}} form of the Robin Hood legends, although none of them were recorded {{at the time of the}} first allusions to him, and many are from much later. They share many common features, often opening with praise of the greenwood and relying heavily on disguise as a plot device, but include a wide variation in tone and plot. The ballads <b>are</b> <b>sorted</b> <b>into</b> three groups, very roughly according to date of first known free-standing copy. Ballads whose first recorded version appears (usually incomplete) in the Percy Folio may appear in later versions and may be much older than the mid-17th century when the Folio was compiled. Any ballad may be older than the oldest copy that happens to survive, or descended from a lost older ballad. For example, the plot of Robin Hood's Death, found in the Percy Folio, is summarised in the 15th-century A Gest of Robyn Hode, and it also appears in an 18th-century version.|$|E

Ron and Hermione <b>are</b> also <b>sorted</b> <b>into</b> Gryffindor. Draco <b>is</b> <b>sorted</b> <b>into</b> Slytherin, like his whole family before him.|$|R

2500|$|The Sorting Hat {{claims that}} blood purity {{is a factor}} in {{selecting}} Slytherins, although this is not mentioned until the fifth book. There is no reason to believe, however, that Muggle-born students are not sorted there, merely that pure-blooded students are more desirable to that house, as there are several examples of half-bloods in the house (such as Snape and Voldemort). In Deathly Hallows, a group of Snatchers claim that [...] "not many Mudbloods" [...] <b>are</b> <b>sorted</b> <b>into</b> Slytherin.|$|E
2500|$|The size {{distribution}} of {{gravel and sand}} particles are typically measured using sieve analysis. The formal procedure is described in ASTM D6913-04(2009). A stack of sieves with accurately dimensioned holes between a mesh of wires is used to separate the particles into size bins. A known volume of dried soil, with clods broken down to individual particles, is put {{into the top of}} a stack of sieves arranged from coarse to fine. The stack of sieves is shaken for a standard period of time so that the particles <b>are</b> <b>sorted</b> <b>into</b> size bins. This method works reasonably well for particles in the sand and gravel size range. [...] Fine particles tend to stick to each other, and hence the sieving process is not an effective method. If {{there are a lot of}} fines (silt and clay) present in the soil it may be necessary to run water through the sieves to wash the coarse particles and clods through.|$|E
