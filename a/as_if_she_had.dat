5|$|In 1940 Ye Qianyu met {{the dancer}} Dai Ailian in Hong Kong. An {{overseas}} Chinese born in Trinidad, Dai {{had come to}} Hong Kong to support the war effort. Although Dai could not speak Chinese and Ye spoke little English, {{they fell in love}} and got married within a few weeks. Soong Ching-ling, the widow of President Sun Yat-sen, presided over their wedding. Because of a botched surgery in Hong Kong, Dai was unable to have children. According to Ye Qianyu's daughter Mingming, who lived with her father and was initially hostile to her stepmother, Dai treated her <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> been her own child.|$|E

Later, Kevin overexerts himself at the gymnasium and goes into shock; Noah saves his life by injecting him with Kevin's EpiPen. Claire receives flowers from Noah, and she confronts him about this. Noah witnesses Claire and Garrett on a date together, which escalates his obsession with her.|$|E
5|$|Excavators {{found the}} body of the Haraldskær Woman in a supine {{position}} in an excellent state of preservation. She was naked and her clothes, consisting of a leather cape and three woolen garments, had been placed on top of her. Hurdles of branches and wooden poles pinned the body down. The complete skin envelope and the internal organs were both intact. The body had a lancing wound to the knee joint area, where some object (possibly one of the sharp poles) penetrated to some depth. Her skin was deeply bronzed with a robust skin tone due to tannins in the peat, and all the body joints were preserved with overlying skin in a state <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> died only recently. Doctors determined she had been about 50 years old when she died and in good health without signs of degenerative diseases (such as arthritis) which are typically found in human remains of that age.|$|E

Once again, she finds herself alone in another unrecognizable place, a small office in the Barge City, and looks for a magic map.|$|E
25|$|The {{position}} of women under Welsh law differed significantly {{to that of}} their Norman-English contemporaries. A marriage could be established in two basic ways. The normal way was that the woman would be given to a man by her kindred; the abnormal way was that the woman could elope with a man {{without the consent of}} her kindred. In this case her kindred could compel her to return if she was still a virgin, but if she was not she could not be compelled to return. If the relationship lasted for seven years she had the same entitlements <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> been given by her kin.|$|E

500|$|American vocalist Barbra Streisand {{recorded}} {{a version of}} [...] "Didn't We" [...] in 1972 for her second live album, Live Concert at the Forum. It was originally performed at a concert benefitting George McGovern's unsuccessful 1972 presidential campaign. Streisand's monologue {{before and after the}} performance consisted of her acting <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> taken marijuana. Her version peaked at number 82 in the United States, and also entered the Adult Contemporary charts in both the aforementioned country and Canada. She has since included an earlier version of [...] "Didn't We" [...] on her 2012 compilation album, Release Me. Other artists like Matt Monro and Frank Sinatra also recorded renditions of [...] "Didn't We".|$|E

[...] Evan Sawdey from PopMatters said that Gaga's vocals sounded {{like those of}} Shakira in the song's chorus. Ben Patashnik from NME called the song light-hearted. Michael Hubbard of MusicOMH complimented the song as [...] "brilliantly catchy, deceptively simple and wonderfully melancholy," [...] while Sarah Hajibagheri from The Times dismissed it for being a [...] "painful Latino warble [...] a would-be Eurovision reject." [...] The Boston Globes James Reed also gave a negative review of the song, writing that it is [...] "a tepid dance track in which she trills the song's title {{over and over again}} <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> nothing better to say." [...] The song won Best Pop Dance Track at the Annual International Dance Music Awards, the major event held during the Winter Music Conference 2011.|$|E
500|$|Born to a Jewish-American {{family in}} Texas, Frank {{was raised in}} New York and {{earned a degree in}} {{mechanical}} engineering from Cornell University before moving to Atlanta in 1908. Marrying in 1910, he involved himself with the city's Jewish community and was elected president of the Atlanta chapter of the B'nai B'rith, a Jewish fraternal organization, in 1912. Although antisemitism was not locally common, there were growing concerns regarding child labor at factories owned by members of the Jewish community. One of these children was Mary Phagan, who worked at the National Pencil Company where Frank was director. The girl was strangled on April 26, 1913, and found dead in the factory's cellar the next morning. Two notes, made to look <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> written them, were found beside her body. Based on the mention of a [...] "night witch", they implicated the night watchman, Newt Lee. Over the course of their investigations, the police arrested several men, including Lee, Frank, and Jim Conley, a janitor at the factory.|$|E

500|$|Maurizio Costanzo and Ghigo De Chiara {{wrote the}} lyrics of [...] "Se telefonando" [...] ("If Over the Phone") as the theme for the TV program [...] in spring 1966. The lyrics were {{composed}} in a dark, Hal David mode. The serialist composer Ennio Morricone was asked to compose the music. Mina and the three songwriters met in a RAI rehearsal room at Via Teulada, Rome. Morricone started to repeat a short musical theme of just three notes (by his term a micro-cell) on an upright piano. He had copied the snippet of melody from the siren of a police car in Marseilles. After a few bars Mina grabbed the lyrics sheet and started to sing <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> known the tune before. Composed in this way, [...] "Se telefonando" [...] is a pop song with eight transitions of tonality that builds tension throughout the chorus. Morricone's arrangement featured a sophisticated combination of melodic trumpet lines, Hal Blaine-style drumming, a string set, a 1960s Europop female choir, and intense subsonic-sounding trombones.|$|E
500|$|The episode {{featured}} one of {{the first}} scenes in which Maslany plays multiple characters interacting in the same shot. To construct the scene in which Sarah and Alison meet in the soccer field shed, Maslany and her stunt double Kathryn Alexandre first shot a master version of the scene using a Technodolly, a programmable camera crane that can memorise camera movements. Two versions of the scene were then re-filmed without Alexandre, with Maslany playing each of the characters. To simulate Alison placing her hand on Sarah's shoulder, a grip stand was used in the place of Sarah's shoulder for Maslany to hold when playing Alison, and to simulate Sarah slapping Alison's arm away, Maslany slapped the air when playing Sarah and reacted <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> been hit when playing Alison. The final scene was created through digital compositing, whereby both versions of the scene—with Maslany playing both characters separately—are combined to produce a single shot. Maslany felt that, as one of her early attempts at sharing a scene with herself, she over-thought the process: [...] "I think I was trying too hard to get it right. Nobody's there when you're shooting these things, so you overcompensate." ...|$|E
500|$|Tenar {{begins to}} {{question}} her beliefs {{when she hears}} Kossil defying the Nameless Ones, and sees {{that they do not}} punish her. She has a conversation with Penthe, her only friend, who expresses an [...] "unfaith" [...] in the divinity of the God-king. Though Tenar reacts to this with shock, the incident opens a new perspective to her. In her own thoughts, [...] "she felt <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> looked up and suddenly seen a whole new planet hanging huge and populous right outside the window, an entirely strange world, one in which the gods did not matter." [...] Ged acts as a catalyst for this stream of thought, because he is completely alien to her; he is male, brown-skinned, and has a picture of the world is so different from Tenar's own. After speaking to him, she begins to wonder whether the Nameless Ones, despite their power, deserve her worship, and begins to lose faith in them and in all the things she has been taught. She expects to find only evil in Ged, according to what she has been taught; but instead she finds light and love, further challenging her belief.|$|E

500|$|In June 1945, {{all of her}} {{secondary}} {{guns and}} about half of her anti-aircraft armament was moved ashore, together with her rangefinders and searchlights. Her crew was accordingly reduced to less than 1,000 officers and enlisted men. On 18 July 1945, the heavily camouflaged ship was attacked by fighter bombers and torpedo bombers from five American carriers as part of Admiral William Halsey, Jr.'s campaign to destroy the IJN's last surviving capital ships. Nagato was hit by two bombs, the first [...] bomb struck the bridge and killed Otsuka, the executive officer, and twelve sailors when it detonated upon hitting {{the roof of the}} conning tower. The second 500-pound bomb struck the deck aft of the mainmast and detonated when it hit No. 3 barbette. It failed to damage the barbette or the turret above it, but blew a hole nearly [...] in diameter in the deck above the officer's lounge, killing 21 men and damaging four Type 96 [...] guns on the deck above. A dud rocket of uncertain size hit the ship's fantail, but failed to do any significant damage. To convince the Americans that Nagato had been badly damaged by the attack, her damage was left unrepaired and some of her ballast tanks were pumped full of seawater to make her sit deeper in the water <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> sunk to the harbor bottom.|$|E
500|$|Stafford was {{admired by}} critics and the {{listening}} {{public for the}} purity of her voice, and {{was considered one of}} the most versatile vocalists of her era. Peter Levinson said that she was a coloratura soprano, whose operatic training allowed her to sing a natural falsetto. Her style encompassed a number of genres, including big band, ballads, jazz, folk and comedy. The music critic Terry Teachout described her as [...] "rhythmically fluid without ever sounding self-consciously 'jazzy' [...] ", while Rosemary Clooney said of her, [...] "The voice says it all: beautiful, pure, straightforward, no artifice, matchless intonation, instantly recognizable. Those things describe the woman too." [...] Writing for the New York Sun, Will Friedwald described her 1947 interpretation of [...] "Haunted Heart" [...] as [...] "effective because it's so subtle, because Stafford holds something back and doesn't shove her emotion in the listener's face." [...] Nancy Franklin described Stafford's version of the folk song [...] "He's Gone Away" [...] as [...] "wistful and tender, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> picked up a piece of clothing once worn by a loved one and begun singing." [...] Frank Sinatra said, [...] "It was a joy to sit on the bandstand and listen to her". The singer Judy Collins has cited Stafford's folk recordings as an influence on her own musical career. The country singer Patsy Cline was also inspired by Stafford's work.|$|E
500|$|The 15-year-old King fell {{seriously ill}} in February 1553. His sister Mary {{was invited to}} visit him, the Council doing [...] "duty and obeisance to her <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> been Queen of England". The King {{recovered}} somewhat, and in April Northumberland restored Mary's full title and arms as Princess of England, which she had lost in the 1530s. He also kept her informed about Edward's condition. About this time a set of drawn-out marriage negotiations came to conclusion. On 21 May 1553 Guildford Dudley, Northumberland's second youngest son, married Lady Jane Grey, the fervently Protestant daughter of the Duke of Suffolk and, through her mother Frances Brandon, a grandniece of Henry VIII. Her sister Catherine was matched with the heir of the Earl of Pembroke, and another Katherine, Guildford's younger sister, was promised to Henry Hastings, heir of the Earl of Huntingdon. Within a month {{the first of these}} marriages turned out to be highly significant. Although marked by magnificent festivities, at the time they took place the alliances were not seen as politically important, not even by the Imperial ambassador Jehan de Scheyfye, who was the most suspicious observer. Often perceived as proof of a conspiracy to bring the Dudley family to the throne, they have also been described as routine matches between aristocrats.|$|E

500|$|A {{short film}} {{directed}} by Boyle and {{produced by the}} BBC, called Happy and Glorious (after {{a line in the}} national anthem), featured the character James Bond, played by current Bond actor Daniel Craig, entering the front gate of Buckingham Palace in a London black cab. [...] His entrance (accompanied by an arrangement of Handel's 'The Arrival of the Queen of Sheba') is noticed by Brazilian children (a nod to Rio de Janeiro, which was to be the next summer Games host city) in the throne room. Bond escorted Queen Elizabeth II (who played herself, acknowledging Bond with the words, [...] "Good evening, Mr Bond") out of the building and into a waiting AgustaWestland AW139 helicopter. The film followed the helicopter across London, with shots of a cheering crowd on The Mall, Nelson's Column, the Palace of Westminster with an animated Winston Churchill statue in Parliament Square, and of the Thames past the London Eye, St Paul's Cathedral, the financial district City of London (with 30 St Mary Axe in the background). [...] The helicopter then passed through Tower Bridge, accompanied by the Dambusters March. The film finished with Bond and the Queen apparently jumping from a real helicopter live above the stadium, accompanied by the [...] "James Bond Theme". The Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh, along with Rogge, were then introduced to the audience. [...] The Queen was wearing the same dress as in the film, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> just arrived with James Bond.|$|E
