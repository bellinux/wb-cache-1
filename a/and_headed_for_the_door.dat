5000|$|At {{the funeral}} {{service of a}} noble General Authority, H. Verlan Andersen, a tribute was {{expressed}} by a son. He related that, years earlier, he had a special school date on a Saturday night. He borrowed from his father the family car. As he obtained the car keys <b>and</b> <b>headed</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>door,</b> his father said, “Remember, tomorrow is Sunday. The car will need more gas before then. Be sure to fill the tank before coming home.”Elder Andersen’s son then related that the evening activity was wonderful. Friends met, refreshments were served, and all had a good time. In his exuberance, however, he failed to follow his father’s instruction and add fuel to the car’s tank before returning home. He simply forgot.Sunday morning dawned. Elder Andersen discovered the gas gauge showed empty. The son saw his father put the car keys on the table. In the Andersen family the Sabbath day was a day for worship and thanksgiving, and not for purchases.As the funeral message continued, Elder Andersen’s son declared, “I saw my father put on his coat, bid us good-bye, and walk the long distance to the chapel, that he might attend an early meeting.” Duty called. Truth was not held hostage to expedience.In concluding his funeral message, Elder Andersen’s son said, “No son ever was taught more effectively by his father than I was on that occasion. My father not only knew the truth, but he also taught the truth and lived the truth.” ...|$|E
5000|$|In 1951, the New York Herald Tribune {{sent him}} to do an article on illegal {{immigration}} to the United States. He was flown to Mexico on a small airplane and {{came back into the}} United States with a group crossing the border illegally. Once the story was complete, his editor told him that a room was waiting for him at The Beverly Hills Hotel. [...] "Take a break, and if {{you get a chance to}} interview any movie stars, go for it." [...] Asked by a man seated at the hotel's pool what he was doing at the hotel, he replied that he was supposed to interview movie stars. [...] "How would you like to interview Humphrey Bogart?" [...] was the reply from what turned out to be Bogart's press agent. When Hyams arrived, Bogart was behind the bar and offered him a drink. Hyams asked for a Coke and Bogart reacted angrily: “I don’t trust any bastard who doesn’t drink, especially a pipe-smoking newspaperman… or a man who has more hair than I have.” At this, Hyams pocketed his notebook <b>and</b> <b>headed</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>door.</b> “I don’t drink,” he said on his way out, “and I certainly have more hair on my head than you do.” Bogart liked the courage of the reply and not only granted Hyams an interview, but as soon as it appeared invited him to lunch. [...] In addition to the interview with Humphrey Bogart, within the week Hyams had interviewed Lauren Bacall, Katharine Hepburn, Frank Sinatra and Spencer Tracy. The Herald Tribune had him relocated to Los Angeles. He covered Hollywood as a syndicated columnist from 1951 to 1964.|$|E
