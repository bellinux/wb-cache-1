60|$|While thus engaged, an old sailor on a chest {{just under}} me was puffing out volumes of tobacco smoke. My supper finished, he brushed {{the stem of}} his sooty pipe against {{the sleeve of his}} frock, and politely waved it toward me. The {{attention}} was sailor-like; as for the nicety of the thing, no man who has lived in forecastles is at all fastidious; and so, after a few vigorous whiffs to induce repose, I turned over and tried my best to forget myself. But in vain. My crib, instead of extending fore and aft, as it should have done, was placed <b>athwart</b> <b>ships,</b> that is, at right angles to the keel, and the vessel, going before the wind, rolled to such a degree, that-every time my heels went up and my head went down, I thought I was on the point of turning a somerset. Beside this, there were still more annoying causes of inquietude; and {{every once in a while}} a splash of water came down the open scuttle, and flung the spray in my face.|$|E
50|$|Any long heavy {{items are}} stowed fore and aft. If they are stowed <b>athwart</b> <b>ships</b> they {{are liable to}} shift if the ship rolls heavily and pierce {{the side of the}} ship.|$|E
50|$|For the Large Floating Platform, 300 {{pounds of}} HBX-1 is placed 20 feet under {{water and the}} {{distances}} are 110, 80, 65, and 50 feet from the barge with the first shot Fore-and-aft {{and the other three}} shots <b>athwart</b> <b>ship.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "What {{sort of a}} man! Why {{a fellow}} with his arms rigged <b>athwart</b> <b>ship,</b> and his legs stepped like those of all other Christians, to be sure: but, now you speak of it, I {{remember}} {{that he had a}} bit of a sheep-shank in one of his legs, and rolled a good deal as he went ahead." ...|$|R
50|$|True stitch {{and glue}} designs {{generally}} have few bulkheads, relying {{instead on the}} geometry of the panels to provide shape, and forming a monocoque or semi-monocoque structure. But larger stitch and glue boats may have many <b>athwart</b> <b>ship</b> (sideways) or longitudinal (lengthwise) bulkheads in effect egg crating the interior with these members also fused into the final structure with {{the same type of}} glass tape and epoxy joints as the major hull seams.|$|R
50|$|To {{ensure that}} the rail tracks on the train ferry or car float and the linkspan align {{precisely}} {{it is necessary for}} the ship to have a ledge at its stern onto which the linkspan is rested. To be certain that the rail tracks do not have a step at the junction of ship and linkspan, this ledge or shelf must be of a depth {{the same as that of}} the end of the linkspan. It is also fitted with a locating pin that ensures the linkspan is in the exact <b>athwart</b> <b>ships</b> (sideways) position.|$|E
5000|$|Wooden barrels are stowed {{on their}} sides on [...] "beds" [...] of dunnage which keeps {{the middle of the}} side (the bilge) off the deck and they are stowed with the bung at the top. To prevent {{movement}} wedges called quoins are put in on top of the [...] "beds". Barrels should be stowed fore and aft and not <b>athwart</b> <b>ships.</b> Once the first tier has been loaded the next tier of barrels fits into the hollows between the barrels, this is known as stowing [...] "bilge and cantline".Barrels which are also known as casks or tuns are primarily use for transporting liquids such as wine, water, brandy, whiskey, and even oil. They are usually built in spherical shape {{to make it easier to}} roll and have less friction when changing direction.|$|E
40|$|Shock load {{caused by}} {{underwater}} explosion in naval battles {{can lead to}} malfunction of the equipment on-board naval vessels. It makes the ships vulnerable and they can lose the ability to accomplish their missions. This study presents a shock analysis, using the dynamic design analysis method (DDAM), of a naval ship stern ramp subjected to a non-contact underwater explosion. The objective is to evaluate {{the performance of the}} ramp subjected to a shock load, identify areas for structural improvements and recommend design changes. The DDAM in the commercial software ANSYS is used in the evaluation of the ramp. The structural response to the shock load is estimated by combined modal and response spectrum analyses. The shock load is applied in three directions (vertical, fore and aft, <b>athwart</b> <b>ships)</b> and the results show that the vertical direction is the most severe loading direction and critical to the functionality of the ramp. A parametric study is presented which shows which parameters that influence the most the structural response. The results from this study are used to suggest improvements of the ramp structure to make it more resistant to shock loads...|$|E
50|$|The Barge Test or Heavyweight Test {{requires}} the item under test to be {{mounted on a}} floating barge. For the Standard Floating Platform, 60 pounds of HBX-1 explosive is placed 24 feet under water at various distances from the barge and detonated. There are four 'shots'. The first {{is placed on the}} Fore-and-Aft axis, 40 feet from the barge. Shots 2, 3, and 4 are placed <b>athwart</b> <b>ship</b> at distances of 30, 25 and 20 feet. The distance refers to the near side of the floating platform.|$|R
50|$|As built {{specifications}} include: length overall, including bowsprit 344 ft, length overall, hull 303 ft, beam, molded 35 ft, depth, side, molded 35 ft, normal cruising draft 15 ft, loaded draft 16 ft, {{gross tonnage}} Custom House Measurement 1,148. The hull was divided from main deck down by seven watertight steel bulkheads <b>athwart</b> <b>ship</b> and two similar bulkheads extending from lower deck down {{to divide the}} vessel into eighteen water tight compartments. A vertical triple expansion steam engine with cylinders of 28 in, 43.25 in and 70 in with a stroke of 38 in was designed for 3,200 horsepower at about 132 revolutions drove a four bladed right hand bronze propeller cast as a single piece.|$|R
40|$|Shallow water effects {{change the}} flow around a ship {{significantly}} which {{can affect the}} optimum design of the hull. This paper describes a study into the optimization of the aft ship region for various water depths. The research focuses on variations of the following parameters of a hull form: The <b>athwart</b> <b>ship’s</b> propeller location, the tunnel top curvature, the flat-of-bottom shape in the stern region and the stern bilge radius. All hull form variants are valuated in 3 different water depths using a viscous flow solver, and a surrogate model is created for each water depth. Pareto plots are used to present the trade-off between the optimization for one or another water depth. Finally, specific hull forms are chosen and the differences in flow behavior among hull forms and water depths are explained. Ship Design, Production and Operation...|$|R
50|$|Over {{the next}} few months, Asterion {{underwent}} an extensive overhaul, involving the strengthening of her whole structure and modification of her armament. Inspection after her sixth cruise raised considerable doubt as to her ability to remain afloat if hit by even a single torpedo because she had three large holds. A representative of the New York Navy Yard conferred with the Bureau of Ships, Damage Section, who confirmed the opinion {{that she could not}} successfully withstand a torpedo hit, and that such a hit would result not only in her eventual sinking but also in such a quick list that her battery would be ineffective. (This weakness almost certainly was responsible for the rapid sinking of Atik.) A conference held {{in the office of the}} Vice Chief of Naval Operations decided to increase flotation by building five transverse bulkheads. It was estimated that this would take three months and that it would cost about US $200,000. The work took much longer and cost much more than estimated. Not until 27 September was the overhaul completed—more than eight months after the end of Asterion&#39;s latest cruise. The overhaul included re-subdivision by longitudinal and <b>athwart</b> <b>ship</b> bulkheads, the filling of her holds with 16,772 empty steel flotation drums. The Supervising Constructor estimated that the vessel could be completely flooded and 25% of the barrels completely crushed before her well decks would be awash. Thus it seemed probable that she had an excellent chance of remaining afloat if a U-boat made a successful attack on her.|$|R
50|$|Lynch next cruised <b>athwart</b> {{the transatlantic}} <b>shipping</b> lanes. On 27 September she ran across {{a fleet of}} 120 sail {{bringing}} a division of Hessians to reinforce General Howe. Frigate HMS Unicorn peeled off the convoy and chased the schooner. Lynch only managed to escape by jettisoning her guns and water, enabling her {{to stay out of}} range until darkness allowed her to slip away. The schooner was laid up after reaching Boston.|$|R
5000|$|... 1 January 1943 saw Growler sail from Brisbane. Entering her patrol area, again <b>athwart</b> the Truk-Rabaul <b>shipping</b> lanes, on 11 January, {{she waited}} only {{five days before}} {{sighting}} an enemy convoy. Maneuvering inside the escorts, Growler launched two torpedoes and saw them hit; then, as her war diary reports, {{she was in the}} unfortunate predicament of being about 400 yd from the destroyer and had to dive without being able to continue the attack. She was credited with sinking Chifuku Maru, a passenger/cargo ship.|$|R
5000|$|Gunnar wins his atgeirr {{early in}} Njáls saga: [...] "Hallgrímr lagði til hans atgeirinum. Slá ein var um þvert skipit, ok hljóp Gunnar aptr yfir öfugr; skjöldr Gunnars var fyrir framan slána, ok lagði Hallgrímr í gegnum hann ok svá í slána. Gunnar hjó á hönd Hallgrími, ok lamðiz handleggrinn, en sverðit beit ekki, fell, þá niðr atgeirinn; Gunnar tók atgeirinn ok lagði í gegnum Hallgrím. Gunnar bar atgeirinn jafnan síðan." [...] In English: [...] "Hallgrim thrust {{at him with}} his bill. There was a boom <b>athwart</b> the <b>ship,</b> and Gunnar leapt nimbly back over it, Gunnars shield was just before the boom, and Hallgrim thrust his bill into it, and through it, and so on into the boom. Gunnar cut at Hallgrims arm hard, and lamed the forearm, but the sword would not bite. Then down fell the bill, and Gunnar seized the bill, and thrust Hallgrim through..." ...|$|R
60|$|Accordingly we {{shortened}} sail, and as {{we expected}} her upon our lee-side, we being then upon our starboard tack, brought eighteen of our guns to the larboard side, resolving to give him a broadside that should warm him. It was about half-an-hour before he came up with us, all which time we luffed up, that we might keep the wind of him, by which he was obliged to run up under our lee, as we designed him; when we got him upon our quarter, we edged down, and received the fire of five or six of his guns. By this time you may be sure all our hands were at their quarters, so we clapped our helm hard a-weather, let go the lee-braces of the maintop sail, and laid it a-back, and so our <b>ship</b> fell <b>athwart</b> the Portuguese <b>ship's</b> hawse; then we immediately poured in our broadside, raking them fore and aft, and killed them a great many men.|$|R
5000|$|The {{speed of}} the new ships caused the United States postal service to choose NDL far more often than other carriers. It was the {{beginning}} of the contest for speed in the Atlantic. In addition, their greater size - the Elbe was half again as large as the type which had been the norm in the Atlantic trade, which had not much changed in twenty years - [...] was accompanied by a change in layout which became the new norm. Until the Elbe, liners had almost universally had four decks, the two lowest devoted to cargo, the third to steerage passengers, and the top deck housing cabins; second-class accommodations were forward, first-class aft, each consisting of cabins to port and starboard of a small longitudinal saloon. On the Elbe there was a fifth deck on which a smoking room and ladies' drawing room were located, and the grand saloon was located <b>athwart</b> the <b>ship</b> from one side to the other, separated from the cabins. She resembled the Guion Line's SS Alaska, but was wider and thus more comfortable. This was also the beginning of the designing of ever more luxurious liner interiors designed to cause the passengers, at least in first and second class, to forget they were aboard ship. The Elbe was the first ship to have its interior designed by Johann Poppe, the most distinguished architect and designer in Bremen, who was to design the interiors of all NDL's liners for the next 25 years. In 1892, a voyage on , the last ship of the Rivers class, prompted Mark Twain to call it [...] "the delightfulest ship I ever saw" [...] and publish an essay contrasting modern German steamships with their [...] "dull, plain, graceless, gloomy and horribly depressing" [...] predecessors as embodied by Cunard's [...]The final two ships in the class, [...] and , were ordered in response to the first express liners placed in service by the rival Hamburg America Line (HAPAG), the Augusta Victoria class. They entered service in 1890. Unlike their predecessors, they were built in Germany, by AG Vulcan of Stettin. However, like their predecessors and unlike the HAPAG liners, they were single-screw, and therefore did not meet the expectation of being faster.|$|R
60|$|I {{found the}} night as full of beauty as the day, when caprice led me from the brilliancy of St. Mark's and the {{glittering}} streets of shops that branch away from the Piazza, and lost me in the quaint recesses of the courts, or the tangles of the distant alleys, where the dull little oil- lamps vied with the tapers burning before the street-corner shrines of the Virgin, [Footnote: In the early times these tapers were the sole means of street illumination in Venice.] in making the way obscure, and deepening the shadows about the doorways and under the frequent arches. I remember distinctly among the beautiful nights of that time, the soft night of late winter which first showed me the scene you may behold from the Public Gardens {{at the end of}} the long concave line of the Riva degli Schiavoni. Lounging there upon the southern parapet of the Gardens, I turned from the dim bell-towers of the evanescent islands in the east (a solitary gondola gliding across the calm of the water, and striking its moonlight silver into multitudinous ripples), and glanced <b>athwart</b> the vague <b>shipping</b> in the basin of St. Mark, and saw all the lights from the Piazzetta to the Giudecca, making a crescent of flame in the air, and casting deep into the water under them a crimson glory that sank also down and down in my own heart, and illumined all its memories of beauty and delight. Behind these lamps rose the shadowy masses of church and palace; the moon stood bright and full in the heavens; the gondola drifted away to the northward; the islands of the lagoons seemed to rise and sink with the light palpitations of the waves like pictures on the undulating fields of banners; the stark rigging of a ship showed black against the sky, the Lido sank from sight upon the east, as if the shore had composed itself to sleep by the side of its beloved sea to the music of the surge that gently beat its sands; the yet leafless boughs of the trees above me stirred themselves together, and out of one of those trembling towers in the lagoons, one rich, full sob burst from the heart of a bell, too deeply stricken with the glory of the scene, and suffused the languid night with the murmur of luxurious, ineffable sadness.|$|R
