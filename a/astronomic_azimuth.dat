40|$|We study tectonic {{deformation}} in the Southern Coast Range, California. We use triangulation and <b>astronomic</b> <b>azimuth</b> {{data collected}} since 1875, trilateration since 1970, and {{global positioning system}} data collected from 1986 to 1987. Two modeling techniques have been used. An elastic block-fault model is applied to study the tectonic motion of the San Andreas Fault and the San Gregorio-Hosgri Fault. Station velocities are modeled to study regional deformations. Results show that the regional deformation is predominantly controlled by deep strike-slip motion along the San Andreas Fault, {{at a rate of}} 33 +/- 2 mm/yr. Deep slip along the San Gregorio-Hosgri Fault is about 0 - 4 mm/yr, assuming a locked suit to a depth of 20 km. Convergence normal to the San Andreas Fault in the Southern Coast Ranges is not greater than 0. 02 microrad/yr...|$|E
40|$|The azimuths {{obtained}} from astronomic observation and GPS survey were evaluated to show significant differences. Astronomic observation {{was used in}} azimuth determination for old surveys in the Philippines, but is gradually being replaced {{by the use of}} the GPS, because of its rapid measuring capability and weather independency. However, GPS provides a different type of azimuth as compared to astronomic observation. The relationship and precision of both techniques were tested on various baselines located {{in different parts of the}} country. Nine baselines in five cities from around the Philippine Archipelago were chosen as test sites to compare the difference between the measured GPS azimuth and <b>astronomic</b> <b>azimuth.</b> Dual frequency GPS receivers were used to measure geodetic azimuth using static GPS technique while the astronomic observations made use of series of solar observations using a Wilde T 2 theodolite. The differences in measured azimuth were analyzed and evaluated using the standards of project control accuracy in the Philippines. The results derived from the two methods yielded comparative difference of amounts less than 15 seconds in all test sites, the minimum requirement of PE for tertiary project controls. This means that in the establishment of project controls of at least tertiary control requirements, azimuth from GPS and astronomi...|$|E
40|$|The {{knowledge}} of the azimuth of the reference mark is of crucial importance in {{the determination of the}} declination which is defined as the ellipsoidal (geodetic) azimuth of the geomagnetic meridian. The accuracy of the azimuth determination has direct impact on the accuracy of the declination. The orientation of the Declination-Inclination Magnetometer is usually carried out by sighting the reference mark in two telescope faces in order to improve the reliability of the observations and eliminate some instrumental errors. In this paper, different coordinate as well as azimuth determination methods using GNSS (Global Navigation Satellite System) observation techniques within VPPS (High-Precision Positioning Service) and GPPS (Geodetic-Precision Positioning Service) services of the CROPOS (CROatian POsitioning System) system were explained. The azimuth determination by the observation of the Polaris was exposed and it was subsequently compared with the observation of the Sun using hour-angle and zenith-distance method. The procedure of the calculation of the geodetic azimuth from the <b>astronomic</b> <b>azimuth</b> was explained. The azimuth results obtained by different methods were compared and the recommendations on the minimal distance between repeat station and azimuth mark were given. The results shown in this paper were based on the observations taken on the POKU_SV repeat station. </p...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. We combine 6 {{years of}} Global Positioning System (GPS) data with 20 years of {{trilateration}} data and {{a century of}} triangulation, taped distance, and <b>astronomic</b> <b>azimuth</b> measurements to derive 66 interseismic station velocities in the greater Los Angeles region. We interpolate the velocities to construct a regional strain rate map beyond the Los Angeles basin. Our results generally agree with the model proposed by the Working Group on California Earthquake Probabilities in 1995. Important regional {{findings of this study}} are as follows: (1) There is a significant N-S convergence and E-W extension, about 0. 22 and 0. 17 •: 0. 05 #strain/yr, respectively, for the two components, along the southern frontal fault system ofthe San Gabriel Mountains. (2) The crustal deformation around the Big Bend of the San Andreas fault (SAF) cannot be explained solely by wrench-style motion across the SAF. Remaining motion could be part of a NW-SE extension which is the response to NF•SW compression i the central Transverse Ranges region. Alternatively, it could be caused by left-lateral faulting on an oblique blind thrust beneath the San Gabriel Mountains. (3) Low strain rates axe found along the Elsinore fault and Newport-Inglewood fault. (4) North-south compression decreases from the Raymond Hill fault westward to the Santa Monica fault. There is little east-west extension along this fault system...|$|E
40|$|The {{direction}} {{is very important}} for Muslims, because one of the requirements for the lawful conduct daily prayers. Qibla according to Shari'a law is facing the Qibla direction which is defined as a person's whole body or body facing towards the Kaaba in Mecca is Al - Mukarraomah which is the center for the perfect pedestal Muslims praying. The issue facing the Qiblah emerge from {{the people who live in}} geographically remote areas of the city of Mecca. They can not directly facing the Ka'ba as the distance adrift issue, so many mosques and prayer houses found that the direction of the qibla bebarapa degrees deviated from the actual direction of Qibla, the error also occurred in Indonesia. Based on data from the Ministry of Religious Affairs of the Republic of Indonesia in 2009, from 800 thousand mosques in the country, about 170 thousand mosque qibla direction wrong. Most direction deviated from 2 to 20 degrees from the shrine of newspaper quoted Jakarta, dated March 23, 2010. Through this article, took this topic of the" making of the determination of the direction of Qibla application program using the programming language C # Visual Studio 2010 ". The purpose in making this application program is to simplify and speed up the calculation determining the Qiblah direction in the field with accuracy approaching towards the Kaaba. This application has two calculations to determine the Qibla, ie Qibla Direction with reference Astronomical Azimuth and Qibla Direction with Magnetic Azimuth reference. In calculating the azimuth of the sun Astronomical observations made by the method of corner time. The data required in the calculation is the determination of the direction of Qibla; geographical coordinates of observation points, the geographic coordinates of the Kaaba, hours of observation of the sun and the sun of Ephemeris Data Hisab Rukyat Ministry of Religious Affairs of the Republic of Indonesia. After the test results of some data calculations determining the direction of Qibla application programs with the <b>astronomic</b> <b>azimuth</b> range manual calculation errors have 0 ¬ o 0 ' 0 " to 0 ¬ ° 0 ' 1. 4 ".
