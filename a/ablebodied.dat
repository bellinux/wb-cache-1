60|$|This {{description}} {{of them is}} not wholly contemptuous. Whoever has intelligently observed the tramp, or visited the <b>ablebodied</b> ward of a workhouse, will admit that our social failures are not all drunkards and weaklings. Some of them are men who do not fit the class they were born into. Precisely the same qualities that make the educated gentleman an artist may make an uneducated manual laborer an <b>ablebodied</b> pauper. There are men who fall helplessly into the workhouse because they are good far nothing; {{but there are also}} men who are there because they are strongminded enough to disregard the social convention (obviously not a disinterested one {{on the part of the}} ratepayer) which bids a man live by heavy and badly paid drudgery when he has the alternative of walking into the workhouse, announcing himself as a destitute person, and legally compelling the Guardians to feed, clothe and house him better than he could feed, clothe and house himself without great exertion. When a man who is born a poet refuses a stool in a stockbroker's office, and starves in a garret, spunging on a poor landlady or on his friends and relatives rather than work against his grain; or when a lady, because she is a lady, will face any extremity of parasitic dependence rather than take a situation as cook or parlormaid, we make large allowances for them. To such allowances the <b>ablebodied</b> pauper and his nomadic variant the tramp are equally entitled.|$|E

60|$|Not {{very far}} north of a spot {{at which the}} high road {{over one of the}} passes crosses a tunnel on the railway from Malaga to Granada, is one of the {{mountain}} amphitheatres of the Sierra. Looking at it from the wide end of the horse-shoe, one sees, a little to the right, {{in the face of the}} cliff, a romantic cave which is really an abandoned quarry, and towards the left a little hill, commanding a view of the road, which skirts the amphitheatre on the left, maintaining its higher level on embankments and on an occasional stone arch. On the hill, watching the road, is a man who is either a Spaniard or a Scotchman. Probably a Spaniard, since he wears the dress of a Spanish goatherd and seems at home in the Sierra Nevada, but very like a Scotchman for all that. In the hollow, on the slope leading to the quarry-cave, are about a dozen men who, as they recline at their cave round a heap of smouldering white ashes of dead leaf and brushwood, have an air of being conscious of themselves as picturesque scoundrels honoring the Sierra by using it as an effective pictorial background. As a matter of artistic fact they are not picturesque; and the mountains tolerate them as lions tolerate lice. An English policeman or Poor Law Guardian would recognize them as a selected band of tramps and <b>ablebodied</b> paupers.|$|E
6000|$|There was {{the less}} excuse for my {{blindness}} because I {{was at that}} very moment laying the foundations of my high fortune by the most ruthless disregard of all the quack duties which lead the peasant lad of fiction to the White House, and harness the real peasant boy to the plough until he is finally swept, as rubbish, into the workhouse. I was an <b>ablebodied</b> and ableminded young man in the strength of my youth; and my family, then heavily embarrassed, needed my help urgently. That I should have chosen to be a burden to them instead was, according to all the conventions of peasant lad fiction, monstrous. Well, without a blush I embraced the monstrosity. I did not throw myself into the struggle for life: I threw my mother into it. I was not a staff to my father's old age: I hung on to his coat tails. His reward was to live just long enough to read a review of one of these silly novels written in an obscure journal by a personal friend of my own (now eminent in literature as Mr. John Mackinnon Robertson) prefiguring me to some extent as a considerable author. I think, myself, that this was a handsome reward, far better worth having than a nice pension from a dutiful son struggling slavishly for his parent's bread in some sordid trade. Handsome or not, it was the only return he ever had for the little pension he contrived to export from Ireland for his family. My mother reinforced it by drudging in her elder years at the art of music which she had followed in her prime freely for love. I only helped to spend it. People wondered at my heartlessness: one young and romantic lady had the courage to remonstrate openly and indignantly with me, [...] "for the which" [...] as Pepys said of the shipwright's wife who refused his advances, [...] "I did respect her." [...] Callous as Comus to moral babble, I steadily wrote my five pages a day and made a man of myself (at my mother's expense) instead of a slave. And I protest that I will not suffer James Huneker or any romanticist to pass me off as a peasant boy qualifying for a chapter in Smiles's Self Help, or a good son supporting a helpless mother, instead of a stupendously selfish artist leaning with the full weight of his hungry body on an energetic and capable woman. No, James: such lies are not only unnecessary, but fearfully depressing and fundamentally immoral, besides being hardly fair to the supposed peasant lad's parents. My mother worked for my living instead of preaching that it was my duty to work for hers: therefore take off your hat to her, and blush.[A] ...|$|E

40|$|Throughout the 1940 ’s the Swedish {{government}} {{conducted a}} series of studies (published as a part of what is known as The Swedish Government Official Reports) concerning the “partially ablebodied” and their access to vocational training and vocational therapy. During this period, Sweden experienced an economic boom which created a lack of labour force. At the same time the Swedish welfare state was being built. The official reports {{can be seen as a}} way for the government to explore the possibility of including the partially <b>ablebodied</b> in the labour force. This can be understood as a part of specific demands and rights that were connected to citizenship at this time. This paper investigates discourses regarding the body, using both official reports and life narratives from persons who had polio during the first half of the twentieth century in Sweden. Because of the very different nature of the two materials – one stemming from experiences and one expressing a more strategic and official view – a wide range of possibilities for analyses is opened up. In this paper I focus on how, in these discourses, a body with impairments is constructed as being (partially) able to perform something defined as “labour”. My hypothesis is that the governmental studies constantly express an insecurity regarding what kind of duties a partially <b>ablebodied</b> person should be expected to perform. This created a complex power relation between the state and the partially <b>ablebodied,</b> which also can be detected in the life narratives...|$|E

Despite satisfactory classification rates are frequently obtained through supervised machine learning (ML) algorithms, there are some issues mostly related to the data acquisition which are not properly addressed in current studies.

To address this issue we propose a stage of pre-processing capable of being adapted {{on a variety of}} classifiers. The proposed method is capable of identify this two anomalies in the signal and provide the data to retrain the classifier, discarding the problematic channels.

40|$|There is a {{major need}} in the {{developing}} world for a low-cost prosthetic knee that enables users to walk with able-bodied kinematics and low energy expenditure. To efficiently design such a knee, the relationship between the inertial properties of a prosthetic leg and joint kinetics and energetics must be determined. In this paper, using inverse dynamics, the theoretical effects of varying the inertial properties of an above-knee prosthesis on the prosthetic knee moment, hip power, and absolute hip work required for walking with <b>ablebodied</b> kinematics were quantified. The effects of independently varying mass and moment of inertia of the prosthesis, as well as independently varying the masses of each prosthesis segment, were also compared. Decreasing prosthesis mass to 25 % of physiological leg mass increased peak late-stance knee moment by 43 % and decreased peak swing knee moment by 76 %. In addition, it reduced peak stance hip power by 26 %, average swing hip power by 76 %, and absolute hip work by 22 %. Decreasing upper leg mass to 25 % of its physiological value reduced absolute hip work by just 2 %, whereas decreasing lower leg and foot mass reduced work by up to 22 %, with foot mass having the greater effect. Results are reported in the form of parametric illustrations that can be utilized by researchers, designers, and prosthetists. The methods and outcomes presented have the potential to improve prosthetic knee component selection, facilitate <b>ablebodied</b> kinematics, and reduce energy expenditure for users of low-cost, passive knees in developing countries, as well as for users of advanced active knees in developed countries.

40|$|Abstract — Individuals {{with chronic}} disabilities often use {{compensatory}} coordination patterns learned during the recovery phase, even after their individual muscular control returns. Although these compensatory movements limit {{their ability to}} complete tasks, these individuals {{are not able to}} relearn the correct synergistic coordination patterns because doing so would temporarily compromise task performance. Following our previous work using feedback distortion in a virtual rehabilitation environment to increase the strength and range of motion of disabled individuals, we address the use of this same feedback distortion environment to alter movement coordination patterns. In this paper, we present the methodology and preliminary results showing that (1) <b>ablebodied</b> individuals could be trained to use a different coordination pattern to produce pinching movements, and (2) feedback distortion can alter movements for individual fingers separately during a coordinated movement. These results indicate that our distorted virtual environment may be a powerful rehabilitation tool to convert compensatory movements into movements that utilize all muscles in the normal synergistic patterns...|$|E

40|$|There is a {{great effort}} {{during the last decade}} towards {{building}} control interfaces for robots that are based on signals measured directly from the human body.

However, this kind of interface demands an accurate decoding technique for the translation of EMG signals to human motion. This paper presents a methodology for estimating human arm motion using EMG signals from muscles of the upper limb, using a decoding method and an additional filtering technique based on a probabilistic model for arm motion. The decoding method can estimate, in real-time, arm motion in 3 -dimensional (3 D) space using only EMG recordings from 11 muscles of the upper limb. Then, the probabilistic model realized through a Bayesian Network, filters the decoder's result in order to tackle the problem of the uncertainty in the motion estimates.

40|$|Electricalmyography or myoelectric {{signal is}} used to voluntarily control current {{commercial}} electric prosthetic modules in the upper limb prosthetics. One of the technological questions that are rarely discussed is the assessment of fitting or tuning the EMG sensors to gain suitable and robust control signal. Such methods are mostly neglected by laboratory researchers because workable signals can be obtained {{through trial and error}} for short-period experiments, and for clinical use, humans are more adaptable then machines. However, the reliability of the interface is a key feature for promising everyday use of a device, and therefore, an assessment strategy and a design method for assembling a durable myoelectrically controlled prosthetic arm is expected. Furthermore, quantitative data is advisable for product design which requires robustness in long life use. In this paper, we applied a Quality Engineering technique [1] to investigate the factors in installing EMG sensors for generating activation (ON/OFF) control signal.

40|$|Mobile {{phones and}} {{personal}} digital assistants (PDAs) are incredibly popular pervasive technologies. Many {{of these devices}} contain touch screens, which can present problems for users with motor impairments due to small targets and their reliance on tapping for target acquisition. In order to select a target, users must tap on the screen, an action which requires the precise motion of flying into a target and lifting without slipping. In this paper, we propose a new technique for target acquisition called barrier pointing, which leverages the elevated physical edges surrounding the screen to improve pointing accuracy. After designing a series of barrier pointing techniques, we conducted an initial study with 9 <b>ablebodied</b> users and 9 users with motor impairments in order to discover the parameters that make barrier pointing successful. From this data, we offer an in-depth analysis {{of the performance of}} two motor-impaired users for whom barrier pointing was especially beneficial. We show the importance of providing physical stability by allowing the stylus to press against the screen and its physical edge. We offer other design insights and lessons learned that can inform future attempts at leveraging the physical properties of mobile devices to improve accessibility.

The simulation presented in this study starts from a model of the body determined with user-specific parameters, individualized with respect to the lengths, masses, inertia, muscle and joint properties. The trajectory used for simulation was recorded from an <b>ablebodied</b> subject while walking with ankle-foot orthoses. A discrete mathematical model and dynamic programming were used to determine the optimal control. A cost function was selected as the sum of the squares of the tracking errors from the desired trajectories, and the weighted sum of the squares of agohist and antagonist activations of the muscle groups acting around the hip and knee joints. The aim of the simulation was to study plausible trajectories keeping in mind the limitations imposed by the spinal cord injury or stroke (e. g., spasticity, decreased range of movements in some joints, limited strength of paralyzed, externally activated muscles). If the muscles were capable of generating the movements required and the trajectory was achieved, then the simulation provided two kinds of information: 1) timing of the onset and offset of muscle activations with respect to the various gait events and 2) patterns of activation with respect to the maximum activation.

(1) Persons with lesion above T- 6 are susceptible to develop autonomic dysreflexia during cystoscopy and urethral catheterisation over a guide wire; nifedipine 5 – 10 milligrams may be administered sublingually {{just prior to the}} procedure to prevent autonomic dysreflexia. (2) Spinal cord injury patients are at increased risk for getting urine infections as compared to <b>ablebodied</b> individuals. Therefore, antibiotics should be given to patients who get haematuria or urethral bleeding following urethral catheterisation over a guide wire. (3) Some spinal cord injury patients may have a small capacity bladder; in these patients, the guide wire, which is introduced into the urinary bladder, may fold upon itself with the tip of guide wire entering the urethra. If this complication is not recognised and a catheter is inserted over the guide wire, the Foley catheter will then be misplaced in urethra despite using cystoscopy and guide wire. 1...|$|E
