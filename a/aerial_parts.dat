500|$|A major {{critique}} {{came during}} the 19th century from James Clerk Maxwell (1831-1879), who maintained that different rotation between {{the inner and outer}} parts of a ring could not allow condensation of material. Astronomer Sir David Brewster also rejected Laplace, writing in 1876 that [...] "those who believe in the Nebular Theory consider it as certain that our Earth derived its solid matter and its atmosphere from a ring thrown from the Solar atmosphere, which afterwards contracted into a solid terraqueous sphere, from which the Moon was thrown off by the same process". He argued that under such view, [...] "the Moon must necessarily have carried off water and air from the watery and <b>aerial</b> <b>parts</b> of the Earth and must have an atmosphere". Brewster claimed that Sir Isaac Newton's religious beliefs had previously considered nebular ideas as tending to atheism, and quoted him as saying that [...] "the growth of new systems out of old ones, without the mediation of a Divine power, seemed to him apparently absurd".|$|E

Seven doses of potassium were used as substrates (0, 50, 100, 150, 200, 250 and 300 mg/dm³) combined with five levels of sulfur (0, 20, 40, 60 and 80 mg/dm³), which were applied in four applications: 0, 30, 60 and 90 days after the first thinning.

Wilting increased dry matter concentration from 25 % to 27. 7 %, without changing the concentration of soluble carbohydrates (33. 3 and 35. 5 % in the PAS and PAE, respectively), as well as buffer capacity (204 mmol kg- 1 DM in PAS and 195 mmol kg- 1 DM in PAE). Neither pH (3. 57 in fresh silage and 3. 60 in PAE) nor the ADIN concentration (11. 32 % of total nitrogen in PAS and 9. 99 % of total nitrogen in PAE) differed between the silages, but ADIN concentration was higher in hay (15. 39 %).
