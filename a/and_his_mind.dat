25|$|Antero {{stands at}} the head of modern Portuguese poetry after João de Deus. His {{principal}} defect is monotony: his own self is his solitary theme, and he seldom attempts any other form of composition than the sonnet. On the other hand, few poets who have chiefly devoted themselves to this form have produced so large a proportion of really exquisite work. The comparatively few pieces in which be either forgets his doubts and inward conflicts, or succeeds in giving them an objective form, are among the most beautiful in any literature. The purely introspective sonnets are less attractive, but equally finely wrought, interesting as psychological studies, and impressive from their sincerity. His mental attitude is well described by himself as the effect of Germanism on the unprepared mind of a Southerner. He had learned much, and half-learned more, which he was unable to assimilate, <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>mind</b> became a chaos of conflicting ideas, settling down into a condition of gloomy negation, save for the one conviction of the vanity of existence, which ultimately destroyed him. A healthy participation in public affairs might have saved him, but he seemed incapable of entering upon any course that did not lead to delusion and disappointment. The great popularity acquired, notwithstanding, by poetry so metaphysical and egotistic is a testimony to the artistic instinct of the Portuguese.|$|E
500|$|Swift lists Paul McCartney, The Rolling Stones, Bruce Springsteen, Emmylou Harris, Kris Kristofferson, and Carly Simon as {{her career}} role models: [...] "They've taken chances, but they've {{also been the}} same artist for their entire careers". McCartney, both as a Beatle and a solo artist, makes Swift feel [...] "as if I've been let into his heart <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>mind</b> ... Any {{musician}} could only dream of a legacy like that". She admires Springsteen for being [...] "so musically relevant after such {{a long period of}} time". She aspires to be like Harris as she grows older: [...] "It's not about fame for her, it's about music". [...] " [...] shines in songwriting... He's just {{one of those people who}} has been in this business for years but you can tell it hasn't chewed him up and spat him out", Swift says. She admires Simon's [...] "songwriting and honesty ... She's known as an emotional person but a strong person".|$|E
500|$|In {{a renewed}} attempt to {{retrieve}} his memory, House has his team re-enact the bus crash. House overdoses on physostigmine, a medication for Alzheimer's disease, <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>mind</b> flashes {{back to the}} bus scene before the accident. [...] "The answer" [...] reminds House that, since he values reason above all else, {{there must be a}} reason for her presence in his mind. She keeps asking House what her necklace is made from, until he realizes that it's made of amber. [...] "The answer" [...] transforms into Amber Volakis, and when Wilson and Cuddy manage to resuscitate House from his overdose-induced cardiac arrest, he immediately informs Wilson that Amber's life is in danger as he now remembers the crash. In the crash, Amber was injured with a bar through her leg and House later saw her being carried away to an ambulance. Wilson has not spoken to Amber since before the accident. Thirteen (Olivia Wilde) checks the patient roster and sees that a patient admitted to a different hospital matches Amber's description.|$|E

500|$|Even so, {{the narrator}} pulls his chair {{directly}} in front of the raven, determined to learn more about it. He thinks for a moment in silence, <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>mind</b> wanders back to his lost Lenore. He thinks the air grows denser and feels the presence of angels, and wonders if God is sending him a sign that he is to forget Lenore. [...] The bird again replies in the negative, suggesting that he can never be free of his memories. [...] The narrator becomes angry, calling the raven a [...] "thing of evil" [...] and a [...] "prophet". Finally, he asks the raven whether he will be reunited with Lenore in Heaven. When the raven responds with its typical [...] "Nevermore", he is enraged, and, calling it a liar, commands the bird to return to the [...] "Plutonian shore"—but it does not move. Presumably at the time of the poem's recitation by the narrator, the raven [...] "still is sitting" [...] on the bust of Pallas. The narrator's final admission is that his soul is trapped beneath the raven's shadow and shall be lifted [...] "Nevermore".|$|E
500|$|Watts' {{return to}} the AFL saw his form improve, {{particularly}} his average disposal count, which increased by six a match in the five weeks from rounds eight to twelve, compared with the first six weeks of the season; he credited {{the opportunity to play}} in the VFL as a key reason to his improved form <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>mind</b> frame was more [...] "calm and relaxed" [...] heading into matches. He continued his good form playing on both the wing and in the forward line and after his performance in the thirty-seven point win against Collingwood at the MCG in round eighteen where he recorded twenty-six disposals—eleven of which were contested—four marks and a goal, Herald Sun journalist, Chris Vernuccio, stated he was starting to [...] "fulfil his potential and silence the doubters" [...] and The Age journalist, Michael Gleeson, noted he may have finally [...] "turned a corner". The next few weeks saw Melbourne suffer heavy defeats and as Melbourne's form diminished, so did Watts' and he was omitted from the side for the final round clash against Greater Western Sydney at Etihad Stadium. Watts finished the season playing twenty matches in total.|$|E

I'm not a Stalinist, Mr. Norman, know that. I was with Leiba Trotsky." [...] Manea also wrote: [...] "What struck about [...] was the contradiction between the extraordinary mobility of spirit and the Affixed Idea. [...] How did he pacify his disappointments and regenerate his militantism after having seen with his eyes, <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>mind,</b> and his heart the nightmarish masquerade of the totalitarian state?" [...] He added: [...] "The socialist tension between the 'conserved' ideal and the putrid reality maintained in those who gave up neither contempt nor complicity a sort of narcissistic and megalomaniac blindness." ...|$|E
2500|$|At {{a typical}} moment of penury, Charlotte {{was offered the}} leading male role of Punch (of Punch & Judy fame) in a new puppet theatre {{proposed}} by a Mr. Russell, due to her recognised abilities as both a comic performer and a proven manipulator of difficult stringed marionettes. The short season was an artistic and financial success for Charlotte, but {{before it could be}} repeated the theatre's founder was arrested for debts and confined to Newgate Prison, where he died after having lost his fortune <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>mind.</b> Charlotte attempted to buy her friend's puppets from Russell's landlord, who had claimed them, but she could not meet his asking price and the little company likewise passed out of existence. An unproduced script Russell had written was also kept by the dead man's creditors as collateral, thus preventing Charlotte from staging it as she had promised its author. [...] The script was thereafter lost as well.|$|E
2500|$|When the adept first {{begins to}} fast, the air he {{swallows}} does not penetrate sufficiently, {{and he is}} constantly subjected to the mischief of the Three Worms. This causes frequent moods of depression and anxiety. He also becomes easily tempted to indulge in sensual or culinary pleasures. He must therefore make a constant effort to resist and overcome these woes and temptations. Quoting a certain Taishang shengxuan jing, the commentary explains that the fast is a process during which the Three Worms are successively exterminated; the Upper Worm dies after thirty days, the Middle Worm dies after sixty days, and the Lower Worm dies after ninety days. After 100 days, the adept's body becomes healthy and strong, <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>mind</b> becomes [...] "pure." [...] He {{is no longer in}} danger of falling prey to his desires.
