5|$|The {{interchange}} with Highway403 also initially remained unmodified {{from the}} design constructed in 1969, with access between westbound Highway403 and eastbound on the parkway being {{provided by a}} loop ramp and access between westbound on the parkway and westbound Highway403 requiring a left turn at <b>a</b> <b>traffic</b> <b>light.</b>|$|E
5|$|West of MN252, {{the freeway}} {{construction}} started in June 1997. The freeway was opened to traffic in 2000, with <b>a</b> <b>traffic</b> <b>light</b> {{at the intersection}} of MN610 and US169 initially. Construction on the second bridge over the Mississippi River for eastbound traffic started in 1999, to be completed in 2002.|$|E

5|$|WSDOT is {{studying}} several different proposed {{changes to the}} SR224 / SR225 intersection to improve traffic flow. Several proposals have been introduced to alleviate the situation, including replacing the stop sign at the intersection with <b>a</b> <b>traffic</b> <b>light,</b> reconfiguring the intersection and the off ramp from I-82, and implementing several options featuring roundabouts. WSDOT favors the roundabout options and estimates costs will range between $2 and $7.4million to construct.|$|E
5|$|East of NY198, {{the road}} becomes more open {{as it passes}} through neighborhoods with a more {{suburban}} residential feel to them. Along this stretch, NY33 connects to several streets, including Bailey Avenue (U.S. Route62 or US62) and Harlem Road (NY240). Past Harlem Road, the expressway makes a slight curve to the south as it prepares to meet a toll-free section of the New York State Thruway (I-90) at a cloverleaf interchange. Beyond I-90, the expressway veers to the south again, traversing an S-curve before connecting to Union Road (NY277) {{by way of a}} partial interchange. After another , NY33 curves south under Genesee Street before joining it at <b>a</b> <b>traffic</b> <b>light</b> in front of the Buffalo Niagara International Airport.|$|E
5|$|For {{the next}} several miles, NY33 runs {{parallel}} to the Thruway and very close to it, with both roads visible from the other. Much of this section of Lancaster has remained rural in character; however, that began {{to change in the}} mid-1990s when Tops Friendly Markets, the regional supermarket chain headquartered in nearby Williamsville, chose a site near the Gunnville Road intersection for a major distribution center. It necessitated the widening of the highway and construction of <b>a</b> <b>traffic</b> <b>light</b> and turn lanes at its entrance.|$|E

The highway heads towards the southwest, passing homes as Sentinel Road. At the {{intersection}} with Mill Pond Road, NY73 passes a small pond, crossing over an associated creek. For that short time, the highway takes on a more southerly direction, mainly to the southeast. The surroundings of the highway remain the same as NY73 leaves Lake Placid via Cascade Road.|$|E
5|$|On {{the weekend}} of August17–18, 2009, another serious traffic jam occurred, in which it took some drivers two hours {{to get to the}} Thruway from the mall. Officials cited several factors: the heavy traffic on Route17 that weekend for both the 40th anniversary of the Woodstock Music Festival in Sullivan County and the observances of the anniversary of Rabbi Joel Teitelbaum's death in Kiryas Joel, a few miles to the west. <b>A</b> <b>traffic</b> <b>light</b> that had been {{malfunctioning}} after a recent lightning strike may also have contributed.|$|E
5|$|By 1954, traffic {{entering}} {{the city by}} the Causeway had doubled, leading to renewed calls for a new bridge further west at The Narrows. That bridge was eventually built as the Narrows Bridge. Opened in 1959, the Narrows Bridge alleviated the traffic problems at the Causeway; the Narrows and the Causeway continued {{to be the only}} road crossings of the Swan River between Fremantle and Maylands until the Windan Bridge of the Graham Farmer Freeway opened in 2000. The opening of the latter eastern bypass coincided with the conversion of the Causeway's two centre lanes to bus lanes. It also lowered traffic levels on the Causeway from 107,000 cars per day to 70,000 within six months. The western roundabout, the state's worst black spot since 1989, was also remodelled in 2000 into <b>a</b> <b>traffic</b> <b>light</b> controlled raindrop roundabout, in conjunction with the other works on the Causeway.|$|E

5|$|On December 12, 2004, Route 83 was {{dedicated}} as the Trooper Bertram T. Zimmerman III Memorial Highway {{in honor of}} a New Jersey State Police trooper who was killed on the route {{earlier in the year}} while responding to an armed robbery. In the 2000s, plans were made to improve the intersections at both termini of Route 83. The intersection with Route 47 saw realignment and the installation of <b>a</b> <b>traffic</b> <b>light,</b> along with improvements to Route 47, that cost $6.7 million and was completed in July 2007. In 2006, reconstruction of the Yintersection of US 9 and Route 83 to a T intersection and a new traffic light was planned following a school bus accident. The reconfigured intersection was completed on June 10, 2008.|$|E
5|$|Route 33 Business {{begins at}} the {{interchange}} with Route 33, its parent route, in Manalapan Township, New Jersey. A short distance after, the interchange from Route 33 eastbound merges into Route 33 Business, and the route passes {{to the south of}} Monmouth Battlefield State Park and enters Freehold Township. Soon after entering the borough of Freehold, Route 33 Business interchanges with U.S. Route 9. Route 33 Business turns to the southeast, passing to the north of Freehold Raceway. A short distance later, Route 33 Business intersects at <b>a</b> <b>traffic</b> <b>light</b> with New Jersey Route 79 (South Street) in downtown Freehold. At the intersection with Fairfield Road, Route 33 Business enters the interchange with Route 33 and the freeway, where the designation terminates.|$|E
5|$|Route 83 {{begins at}} <b>a</b> <b>traffic</b> <b>light</b> with Route 47 in South Dennis, {{heading to the}} east on a four-lane divided highway. The route crosses over the Cape May Seashore Lines {{railroad}} line and narrows to a two-lane undivided highway. After this bridge, it intersects West Avenue and then crosses over County Route 628 (Dennisville Road/School House Road). Route 83 then intersects County Road, which heads west to parallel the route to the south. It later crosses Gravel Hole Road, which provides access to County Route 657 (Court House-Dennisville Road). Past that intersection, Route 83 continues to the east through a mix of residential development and woodland. It passes under a set of power lines and comes to an intersection with County Route 608 (Kings Highway). The route continues east to its eastern terminus at a signalized intersection with US 9 in Clermont.|$|E
50|$|An {{example of}} a strong {{situation}} is <b>a</b> red <b>traffic</b> <b>light.</b> <b>Traffic</b> rules dictate how people are supposed to act {{when they see a}} red light, and this influence often prevents people from engaging in behaviors that are consistent with their personality. For example, most people, no matter whether they are daring or cautious, will stop in front of <b>a</b> red <b>traffic</b> <b>light.</b> Therefore, one could not reasonably predict how a person would behave with personality in this situation.|$|R

5|$|Route177 {{began at}} <b>a</b> <b>traffic</b> <b>light</b> {{intersection}} with U.S. Route 206 {{in the city}} of Somerville. At the intersection, southbound traffic on Route206 had to use a jughandle to connect to Route177. The state highway went northeastward, progressing along as South Bridge Street through a curve. Heading northward, the route passed the Somerville Old Cemetery before intersecting with Fifth Street. There, state-maintenance ended, and the designation of Route177 terminated. Entering downtown Somerville, South Bridge Street continued northward into a large residential community. Passing to the east and west of several residential homes, South Bridge Street continued into the downtown portion, crossing the current-day Raritan Valley Line tracks maintained by New Jersey Transit and served the Somerville train station. After a couple of blocks of residential homes and businesses, South Bridge Street came to an intersection with New Jersey Route 28, where it switched to North Bridge Street.|$|E
5|$|Super Mario Kart is a kart racing game {{featuring}} several {{single and}} multiplayer modes. During the game, players {{take control of}} one of eight Mario franchise characters and drive karts around tracks with a Mario franchise theme.

When the light turns green, the race or battle officially begins. During a race, the player's viewpoint is from behind his or her kart. The goal of the game is to either finish a race ahead of other racers, who are controlled by the computer and other players, or complete a circuit in the fastest time. There is also a battle mode in which the aim is to attack the karts of the other human players.|$|E
5|$|The {{locations}} are themed around {{the idea of}} a traditional Southern U.S. general store. Items used to decorate each store are authentic artifacts, including everyday objects from the early 1900s and after. Each restaurant features a front porch lined with wooden rocking chairs, a wooden peg solitaire game on every table, and a stone fireplace with a deer head displayed above the mantel. In fact, each location has five common items: a shotgun, a cookstove, a deer head, a telephone, and <b>a</b> <b>traffic</b> <b>light.</b> The peg games have been present in Cracker Barrel since the opening of the first store, and continue to be produced by the same family in Lebanon, Tennessee. The decor at each location typically includes artifacts related to the local history of the area, including antique household tools, old wall calendars and advertising posters, and antique photographs; these are centrally stored in a warehouse in Tennessee, where they are cataloged and stockpiled for future use by individual store locations.|$|E
