40|$|Liberty in the {{constitutional}} sense is <b>always</b> a <b>right</b> against state interference (a “freedom from”). The First Amendment begins {{by saying that}} “Congress shall make no law”; it forbids Congress to license or fine or jail people for speaking, or publishing, or assembling. Liberty is also, <b>always,</b> a <b>right</b> to do something (a “freedom to”) : to speak, to assemble, to practice religion, to get married, etc. So “freedom from” and “freedom to” are always parts of the same idea, just as “flying from” and “flying to” are aspects of the same airplane trip. Freedom is <b>always</b> the <b>right</b> to do some particular act without government restraint...|$|R

25|$|In 1847 Syme was {{accepted}} {{the chair of}} clinical surgery at University College, London left vacant after Liston's death. He began practice in London in February 1848; but early in May the same year difficulties {{with two of his}} colleagues at Gower Street and a desire to escape from animosity and contention led him to give up his appointment. He returned to Edinburgh in July, and was reinstated in his old chair, to which the crown authority had meanwhile found a difficulty in appointing.

25|$|At {{the same}} time, Scaliger had made {{numerous}} enemies. He hated ignorance, but he hated still more half-learning, {{and most of}} all dishonesty in argument or in quotation. Himself the soul of honour and truthfulness , he had no toleration for the disingenuous argument and the misstatements of facts of those who wrote to support a theory or to defend an unsound cause. His pungent sarcasm soon reached the ears of the persons who were its object, and his pen was not less bitter than his tongue. He was conscious of his power, and not always sufficiently cautious or sufficiently gentle in its exercise. Nor was he <b>always</b> <b>right.</b> He trusted much to his memory, which was occasionally treacherous. His emendations, if often valuable, were sometimes absurd. In laying the foundations of a science of ancient chronology he relied sometimes on groundless or even absurd hypotheses, often based on an imperfect induction of facts. Sometimes he misunderstood the astronomical science of the ancients, sometimes that of Copernicus and Tycho Brahe. And he was no mathematician.|$|E
25|$|Kala (Susanne Blakeslee) - If his woes {{become too}} great or his {{thoughts}} too burdensome, Tarzan seeks seclusion and the calm council of his gorilla mother, Kala. A sympathetic ear when Tarzan needs someone wise to talk to, Kala {{acts as the}} voice of the apes, always reminding Tarzan of his unique obligations to the family. She is also Jane's closest confidant. The two share a warm, strong bond, and Jane regards her mother-in-law as her only kindred spirit in the jungle. From Kala's point of view, Jane is the human daughter she never had. Kala was Kerchak's mate, and perhaps the only one besides Tarzan that ever openly defied him without repercussions. Her open mind is a well of great wisdom and she is almost <b>always</b> <b>right.</b> Even though Kerchak is gone, she is still highly respected. Although kind and motherly to Tarzan, Jane, and all the gorillas, Kala is almost undoubtedly the bravest gorilla in the family. When the family was trapped in a cave by Tublat, Kala bravely stood up to the villain, and encouraged all the other gorillas to be brave as well. Her presence and support keeps the family together and ensures that they are always there for each other even in the most dire situations.|$|E

500|$|In a {{positive}} review for Rolling Stone, Greil Marcus wrote in 1969 that Morrison's lyrics were thoughtful and deeply intellectual, [...] "in {{terms of the}} myths and metaphors that exist within the world of rock and roll". He believed both the music and lyrics captured the spirit of Bob Dylan's 1967 album John Wesley Harding, while calling Astral Weeks a [...] "unique and timeless" [...] record. Rolling Stone later named it the album of the year. Melody Maker also called {{it one of the}} year's best records, featuring Morrison's [...] "small harsh voice" [...] backed by an attractive musical combo that [...] "verges on genius" [...] during [...] "Madame George". When his third album Moondance was released in 1970, Warner Bros. ran full-page advertisements remarking on the unavailability of Astral Weeks in record stores, calling it a [...] "damn shame" [...] that it [...] "ended up as what you might call a critically acclaimed but obscure album ...

500|$|In his {{survey of}} cricket laws, Gerald Brodribb {{suggests}} that [...] "no dismissal has produced so much argument as lbw; {{it has caused}} trouble from its earliest days". Among {{those who do not}} follow cricket, the law has the reputation of being extremely difficult to understand, of equivalent complexity to association football's offside rule. Owing to the difficulty of its interpretation, lbw is regarded by critics as the most controversial of the laws but also a yardstick by which an umpire's abilities are judged. In his book Cricket and the Law: The Man in White Is <b>Always</b> <b>Right,</b> David Fraser writes that umpires' lbw decisions are frequently criticised and [...] "arguments about bias and incompetence in adjudication inform almost every discussion about lbw decisions". Problems arise because the umpire has not only to establish what has happened but also to speculate over what might have occurred. Controversial aspects of lbw decisions include the umpire having to determine whether the ball pitched outside leg stump, and in certain circumstances whether the batsman intended to hit the ball or leave it alone. Umpires are frequently criticised for their lbw decisions by players, commentators and spectators. Historically, trouble ranging from protests and arguments to crowd demonstrations occasionally arose from disputed decisions. For example, a prolonged crowd disturbance, in which items were thrown onto the playing field and the match was delayed, took place when Mohammad Azharuddin was adjudged lbw during a 1996 One Day International in India.|$|E

The most important intellectual influence on the young Papen were the books of General Friedrich von Bernhardi, who wrote war is [...] "not only {{an integral part of}} humanity, but the great civilizing influence of the world". Throughout his life, recurring themes of Papen's philosophy were an intense militarism, a belief that Germany had to wage war on others to be great in the Social Darwinian competition of nations, and that [...] "might is right".|$|E
