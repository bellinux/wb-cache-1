5|$|Whereas the {{staircases}} on {{the first}} three quadrangles are marked with Arabic numerals, the Island site is marked with Roman numerals. Both sites have the numbering running <b>anticlockwise</b> around each quadrangle {{and there are two}} staircase eighteens − Mary Quad's staircase numbering finishes at 18 and O'Brien Quad's staircase numbering begins with XVIII.|$|E
5|$|Neuman and EUROSEC {{official}} Lise Hartman (Loni von Friedl) interrogate Ross, who {{denies that}} he aborted the mission. Shortly after, Kane dies from his injuries. Eventually, Ross concludes {{that he is}} not on Earth, but is on the unknown planet – a Counter-Earth that is a mirror image of his. Signs of this reversal include a clock whose hands move <b>anticlockwise,</b> a tape deck's reels that turn clockwise and an oscilloscope that scans from right to left.|$|E
5|$|Some {{cylinder}} valve models have axial spindles - {{in line with}} the cylinder axis, and are not handed. Standard side-spindle valves have the valve knob on the diver's right side when back-mounted. Side-spindle valves used with manifolds must be a handed pair - one with the knob to the right and the other with the knob to the left, but in all cases the valve is opened by turning the knob <b>anticlockwise,</b> and closed by turning it clockwise. This is the convention with almost all valves for all purposes. Left hand side-spindle valves are used by sidemount divers.|$|E
5|$|The {{station is}} in London fare zone 1. On the District and Circle lines, {{the station is}} between St James's Park and Embankment, and, on the Jubilee line, it is between Green Park and Waterloo. Train {{frequencies}} vary throughout the day, but generally District line trains operate every 26 minutes from approximately 05:25 to 00:38 eastbound and 05:49 to 00:37 westbound; they are supplemented by Circle line trains every 812 minutes from approximately 05:49 to 00:24 clockwise and 05:36 to 00:19 <b>anticlockwise.</b> Jubilee line trains operate every 25 minutes from approximately 05:28 to 00:48 eastbound and 05:38 to 00:31 northbound.|$|E
5|$|The term Cyclone {{was coined}} by Henry Piddington of the British East India Company to {{describe}} the devastating storm of December 1789 in Coringa, India. A cyclone forms around a low-pressure area. Anticyclone, the term {{for the kind of}} weather around a high-pressure area, was coined in 1877 by Francis Galton to indicate an area whose winds revolved in the opposite direction of a cyclone. In British English, the opposite direction of clockwise is referred to as <b>anticlockwise,</b> making the label anticyclones a logical extension.|$|E
5|$|On 6 November 2014, the {{low-level}} circulation {{centre of}} Qendresa formed near Kerkennah Islands. As {{the system was}} moving north-northeastwards and combining with an upper-level low from Tunisia early on 7 November, the system occluded quickly and intensified dramatically with an eye-like feature, thanks to favourable conditions. Qendresa directly hit Malta when it had lost its fronts with a more well-defined eye, with ten-minute sustained winds at 110.9km/h (68.9mph) and the gust at 153.7km/h (95.5mph). The central pressure was presumed to be 978 hPa (28.88 inHg). Interacting with Sicily, the cyclone turned northeastwards and started to make an <b>anticlockwise</b> loop. On 8 November, Qendresa crossed Syracuse {{in the morning and}} then significantly weakened. Turning southeastwards then moving eastwards, Qendressa moved over Crete, before dissipating over the island on November 11.|$|E
5|$|The region spans a {{wide variety}} of {{cultures}} with distinct cuisines, in particular (going <b>anticlockwise</b> around the region) the Maghrebi, Levantine, Ottoman (Turkish), Greek, Italian, Provençal (French), Spanish, and Portuguese. However, the historical connections of the region, as well as the impact of the Mediterranean Sea on the region's climate and economy, mean that these cuisines share dishes beyond the core trio of oil, bread, and wine, such as roast lamb or mutton, meat stews with vegetables and tomato (for example, Spanish andrajos and Italian ciambotta), and the salted cured fish roe, bottarga, found across the region. Spirits based on anise are drunk in many countries around the Mediterranean.|$|E
5|$|The {{station is}} in London fare zone 1. On the District and Circle lines, {{the station is}} between Gloucester Road and Sloane Square, and on the Piccadilly line, it is between Gloucester Road and Knightsbridge. South Kensington is the easternmost {{interchange}} between these three lines. Train frequencies vary throughout the day, but generally District line trains operate every 26 minutes from approximately 05:15 to 00:30 eastbound and 05:45 to 00:45 westbound; they are supplemented by Circle line trains every 812 minutes from approximately 05:30 to 00:30 clockwise and 05:40 to 00:15 <b>anticlockwise.</b> Piccadilly line trains operate every 26 minutes from approximately 05:40 to 00:25 eastbound and 05:50 to 00:40 westbound.|$|E
5|$|The {{station is}} in London fare zone 1. On the District and Circle lines, {{the station is}} between Westminster and Temple, and, on the Northern and Bakerloo lines, it is between Charing Cross and Waterloo. The Circle and District lines serve the same {{platforms}} at Embankment, but the Bakerloo and Northern lines each have their own platforms. Train frequencies vary throughout the day, but generally District line trains operate every 2–6 minutes from approximately 05:27 to 00:40 eastbound and 05:47 to 00:35 westbound; they are supplemented by Circle line trains every 8–12 minutes from approximately 05:39 to 00:18 clockwise and 05:51 to 00:23 <b>anticlockwise.</b> Northern line trains operate every 2–5 minutes from approximately 05:57 to 00:35 southbound and 05:42 to 00:37 northbound. Bakerloo line trains operate every 2–5 minutes from approximately 05:58 to 00:35 southbound and 05:42 to 00:28 northbound.|$|E
5|$|Plant spirals {{can be seen}} in phyllotaxis, the {{arrangement}} of leaves on a stem, and in {{the arrangement}} (parastichy) of other parts as in composite flower heads and seed heads like the sunflower or fruit structures like the pineapple and snake fruit, {{as well as in the}} pattern of scales in pine cones, where multiple spirals run both clockwise and <b>anticlockwise.</b> These arrangements have explanations at different levels – mathematics, physics, chemistry, biology – each individually correct, but all necessary together. Phyllotaxis spirals can be generated mathematically from Fibonacci ratios: the Fibonacci sequence runs 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13... (each subsequent number being the sum of the two preceding ones). For example, when leaves alternate up a stem, one rotation of the spiral touches two leaves, so the pattern or ratio is 1/2. In hazel the ratio is 1/3; in apricot it is 2/5; in pear it is 3/8; in almond it is 5/13. In disc phyllotaxis as in the sunflower and daisy, the florets are arranged in Fermat's spiral with Fibonacci numbering, at least when the flowerhead is mature so all the elements are the same size. Fibonacci ratios approximate the golden angle, 137.508°, which governs the curvature of Fermat's spiral.|$|E
5|$|Wind blowing {{over the}} surface of the sea causes {{friction}} at the interface between air and sea. Not only does this cause waves to form but it also makes the surface seawater move {{in the same direction as}} the wind. Although winds are variable, in any one place they predominantly blow from a single direction and thus a surface current can be formed. Westerly winds are most frequent in the mid-latitudes while easterlies dominate the tropics. When water moves in this way, other water flows in to fill the gap and a circular movement of surface currents known as a gyre is formed. There are five main gyres in the world's oceans: two in the Pacific, two in the Atlantic, and one in the Indian Ocean. The North Atlantic gyre that produces the Sargasso Sea accumulates salinity levels as high as 38‰. Other smaller gyres are found in lesser seas and a single gyre flows around Antarctica. These gyres have followed the same routes for millennia, guided by the topography of the land, the wind direction, and the Coriolis effect. The surface currents flow in a clockwise direction in the Northern Hemisphere and <b>anticlockwise</b> in the Southern Hemisphere. The water moving away from the equator is warm, while that flowing towards it has lost most of its heat. These currents tend to moderate the Earth's climate, cooling the equatorial region, and warming regions at higher latitudes. Global climate and weather forecasts are powerfully affected by the world ocean, so global climate modelling makes use of ocean circulation models as well as models of other major components such as the atmosphere, land surfaces, aerosols, and sea ice. Ocean models make use of a branch of physics, geophysical fluid dynamics, that describes the large-scale flow of fluids such as seawater.|$|E
25|$|When {{viewed from}} the north {{celestial}} pole (i.e., from the approximate direction of the star Polaris) the Moon orbits Earth <b>anticlockwise</b> and Earth orbits the Sun <b>anticlockwise,</b> and the Moon and Earth rotate on their own axes <b>anticlockwise.</b>|$|E
25|$|Potentially, {{an angle}} denoted, say, ∠BAC might refer {{to any of}} four angles: the {{clockwise}} angle from B to C, the <b>anticlockwise</b> angle from B to C, the clockwise angle from C to B, or the <b>anticlockwise</b> angle from C to B, where {{the direction in which}} the angle is measured determines its sign (see Positive and negative angles). However, in many geometrical situations it is obvious from context that the positive angle {{less than or equal to}} 180 degrees is meant, and no ambiguity arises. Otherwise, a convention may be adopted so that ∠BAC always refers to the <b>anticlockwise</b> (positive) angle from B to C, and ∠CAB to the <b>anticlockwise</b> (positive) angle from C to B.|$|E
25|$|The {{inertial}} rotation will be clockwise (<b>anticlockwise)</b> in {{the northern}} (southern) hemisphere.|$|E
25|$|The line then {{continues}} to Edgware Road where trains terminate, then reverse to traverse the loop in an <b>anticlockwise</b> direction to Hammersmith.|$|E
25|$|The Birmingham SuperPrix circuit {{was laid}} down on public roads, {{just to the}} {{south-east}} of Birmingham City Centre. It starts on the A38 road, and takes in the A4540 road. Slightly unusually the circuit ran <b>anticlockwise.</b>|$|E
25|$|An earlier gold event 2660-2655 Ma was {{associated}} with major extension (normal faulting and granite doming) resulting {{in the formation of}} late basins and the intrusion of mantle-derived magmas (syenites and Mafic-type granites/porphyries) and tight <b>anticlockwise</b> PTt paths.|$|E
25|$|The above {{mathematics}} {{gives no}} clue whether the cyclostrophic rotation ends {{up to be}} clockwise or <b>anticlockwise,</b> meaning that the eventual arrangement {{is a consequence of}} effects not allowed for in the relationship, namely the rotation of the parent cell.|$|E
25|$|A {{positive}} Verdet constant {{corresponds to}} L-rotation (<b>anticlockwise)</b> when {{the direction of}} propagation {{is parallel to the}} magnetic field and to R-rotation (clockwise) when the direction of propagation is anti-parallel. Thus, if a ray of light is passed through a material and reflected back through it, the rotation doubles.|$|E
25|$|The 4×4×4 {{and larger}} cubes use an {{extended}} notation {{to refer to}} the additional middle layers. Generally speaking, uppercase letters (F B U D L R) refer to the outermost portions of the cube (called faces). Lowercase letters (f b u d l r) refer to the inner portions of the cube (called slices). An asterisk (L*), a number in front of it (2L), or two layers in parentheses (Ll), means to turn the two layers at the same time (both the inner and the outer left faces) For example: (Rr)l2f means to turn the two rightmost layers <b>anticlockwise,</b> then the left inner layer twice, and then the inner front layer <b>anticlockwise.</b> By extension, for cubes of 6x6 and larger, moves of three layers are notated by the number 3, for example 3L.|$|E
25|$|Another {{notation}} {{appeared in}} the 1981 book The Simple Solution to Rubik's Cube. Singmaster notation was not widely known {{at the time of}} publication. The faces were named Top (T), Bottom (B), Left (L), Right (R), Front (F) and Posterior (P), with + for clockwise, - for <b>anticlockwise</b> and 2 for 180-degree turns.|$|E
25|$|On 5 January 1973, the GM 34 {{irregular}}s {{began an}} <b>anticlockwise</b> sweep back towards Thakhek, searching for any stray Vietnamese units. After some skirmishes, the irregular force dispersed, to rendezvous in Thakhek for further deployment. However, during January, the Royalist held positions at Thateng, Salavan, and Lao Ngam {{fell to the}} Communists.|$|E
25|$|The {{passenger}} {{is encouraged}} to travel around Hong Kong Island either in a clockwise or <b>anticlockwise</b> direction starting at Central or North Point, stopping at Stanley on the way. As long as he uses an Octopus Card and takes the bus in the correct sequence of routes, he will receive a $1 interchange discount on the 2nd and 3rd rides.|$|E
25|$|The system {{describes}} {{itself as}} two lines, the Outer Circle and Inner Circle, but this simply {{refers to the}} double track, having trains running clockwise and <b>anticlockwise</b> respectively around the same route although in separate tunnels. Stations {{use a variety of}} platform layouts including single island platforms, opposing side platforms and in some stations such as Hillhead one side and one island platform.|$|E
25|$|Once a sign {{convention}} has been chosen, {{it has to}} be maintained for the whole structure. The traditional engineer's {{sign convention}} is not used in the calculations of the moment distribution method although the results can be expressed in the conventional way. In the BMD case, the left side moment is clockwise direction and other is <b>anticlockwise</b> direction so the bending is positive and is called sagging.|$|E
25|$|The {{cross product}} {{can be used}} to {{calculate}} the normal for a triangle or polygon, an operation frequently performed in computer graphics. For example, the winding of a polygon (clockwise or <b>anticlockwise)</b> about a point within the polygon can be calculated by triangulating the polygon (like spoking a wheel) and summing the angles (between the spokes) using the cross product {{to keep track of the}} sign of each angle.|$|E
25|$|Bus {{services}} in Guildford are primarily operated by Arriva, with some additional services by Buses Excetera , Safeguard and Stagecoach. Most routes are centred {{on the bus}} station, next to the Friary shopping centre. Many local bus services are circular routes (starting and ending at the bus station) with different numbers for the clockwise and <b>anticlockwise</b> services. There are also buses to many surrounding towns and villages such as Woking and Aldershot.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} Cambrian, the supercontinent Pannotia broke up and Avalonia drifted off northwards from Gondwana. This {{independent}} movement of Avalonia started from a latitude of about 60° South. The {{eastern end of}} Avalonia collided with Baltica, a continental plate occupying the latitudes from about 30°S to 55°S, as the latter slowly rotated <b>anticlockwise</b> towards it. This happened {{at the end of}} the Ordovician and during the early Silurian.|$|E
25|$|Air within {{high-pressure}} systems rotates in {{a direction}} such that the Coriolis force is directed radially inwards, and nearly balanced by the outwardly radial pressure gradient. As a result, air travels clockwise around high pressure in the Northern Hemisphere and <b>anticlockwise</b> in the Southern Hemisphere. Air around low-pressure rotates in the opposite direction, so that the Coriolis force is directed radially outward and nearly balances an inwardly radial pressure gradient.|$|E
25|$|This {{pattern of}} deflection, and the {{direction}} of movement, is called Buys-Ballot's law. In the atmosphere, the pattern of flow is called a cyclone. In the Northern Hemisphere the direction of movement around a low-pressure area is <b>anticlockwise.</b> In the Southern Hemisphere, the direction of movement is clockwise because the rotational dynamics is a mirror image there. At high altitudes, outward-spreading air rotates in the opposite direction. Cyclones rarely form along the equator due to the weak Coriolis effect present in this region.|$|E
25|$|Snake has {{connotation}} {{with the}} Moon’s nodes known in Hindu astrology. The {{head of the}} snake is represented by Rahu ("Dragon's head") and its tail by Ketu ("Dragon's tail"). If in the zodiacal chart of an individual all the seven major planets are hemmed between Rahu and Ketu in the reverse order (<b>anticlockwise)</b> {{it is said to}} denote Kalasarpa dosha (Defect due to black snakes), which forebodes ill luck and hardship in an individual's life and therefore appeased by offering worship to the snakes on Naga Panchami day.|$|E
25|$|Each Group {{was split}} into several Sectors, which handled {{operations}} {{for one or}} more airfields. This formed {{the lowest level of}} the hierarchy, based at the Sector Controls, normally co-located at one of the sector's airfields. For instance, 11 Group was split into sectors A through F running <b>anticlockwise</b> from the south-west to north-east, along with Sector Z to the northwest. A typical sector, Sector C which saw considerable action, was controlled out of Biggin Hill, but also contained another major airbase at West Malling (Maidstone). Telephone links from Sector to Group allowed the Group's version of the map to be re-created at the Sector, again filtering out information that was not of interest in that area.|$|E
25|$|In physics, the Coriolis {{force is}} an {{inertial}} force that acts on {{objects that are}} in motion relative to a rotating reference frame. In a reference frame with clockwise rotation, the force acts {{to the left of}} the motion of the object. In one with <b>anticlockwise</b> rotation, the force acts to the right. Deflection of an object due to the Coriolis force is called the Coriolis effect. Though recognized previously by others, the mathematical expression for the Coriolis force appeared in an 1835 paper by French scientist Gaspard-Gustave de Coriolis, in connection with the theory of water wheels. Early in the 20th century, the term Coriolis force began to be used in connection with meteorology.|$|E
25|$|A {{typical circuit}} usually {{features}} {{a stretch of}} straight road on which the starting grid is situated. The pit lane, where the drivers stop for tyres, aerodynamic adjustments and minor repairs (such as changing the car's nose due to front wing damage) during the race, retirements from the race, and where the teams work on the cars before the race, is normally located next to the starting grid. The layout {{of the rest of}} the circuit varies widely, although in most cases the circuit runs in a clockwise direction. Those few circuits that run <b>anticlockwise</b> (and therefore have predominantly left-handed corners) can cause drivers neck problems due to the enormous lateral forces generated by F1 cars pulling their heads in the opposite direction to normal.|$|E
25|$|As an example, {{suppose a}} {{spacecraft}} equipped {{with two or}} more dual-gimbal CMGs experiences a transient unwanted torque, perhaps caused by reaction from venting waste gas, tending to make it roll clockwise about its forward axis and thus increase its angular momentum along that axis. Then the CMG control program will command the gimbal motors of the CMGs to slant the rotors' spin axes gradually more and more forward, so that the angular momentum vectors of the rotors point more nearly along the forward axis. While this gradual change in rotor spin direction is in progress, the rotors will be creating gyroscopic torques whose resultant is <b>anticlockwise</b> about the forward axis, holding the spacecraft steady against the unwanted waste gas torque.|$|E
25|$|The first beam was {{circulated}} {{through the}} collider {{on the morning}} of 10 September 2008. CERN successfully fired the protons around the tunnel in stages, three kilometres at a time. The particles were fired in a clockwise direction into the accelerator and successfully steered around it at 10:28 local time. The LHC successfully completed its major test: after a series of trial runs, two white dots flashed on a computer screen showing the protons travelled the full length of the collider. It took less than one hour to guide the stream of particles around its inaugural circuit. CERN next successfully sent a beam of protons in an <b>anticlockwise</b> direction, taking slightly longer at one and a half hours due to a problem with the cryogenics, with the full circuit being completed at 14:59.|$|E
