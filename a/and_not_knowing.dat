5|$|The plant {{develops}} {{the ability to}} speak and demands that Seymour feed it. Now anemic <b>and</b> <b>not</b> <b>knowing</b> what to feed the plant, Seymour takes a walk along a railroad track. When he carelessly throws a rock to vent his frustration, he inadvertently knocks out a man who falls on the track and is {{run over by a}} train. Miserably guilt-ridden but resourceful, Seymour collects the body parts and feeds them to Audrey Jr. Meanwhile, at a restaurant, Mushnick discovers he has no money with him, and when he returns to the shop to get some cash, he secretly observes Seymour feeding the plant. Although Mushnick considers telling the police, he procrastinates by the next day when he sees the line of people waiting to spend money at his shop.|$|E
5|$|Beginning about 6:45, {{many members}} of the public began calling NBC network and {{affiliate}} switchboards. Some demanded the game be shown to its conclusion; others wanted to know if Heidi would start on time. These calls jammed the switchboards, and even blew repeated fuses in them, preventing the executives from getting through to each other to resolve the situation. NBC protocol required an operations order from Connal, to countermand the midweek written orders, but Cline received no call from the increasingly desperate Connal, who was frustrated by the switchboard issues. Without such an order, <b>and</b> <b>not</b> <b>knowing</b> of Goodman's approval, Cline made the decision that Heidi would start on time. The television audience saw Smith return Turner's kickoff out of the end zone to the Oakland 22-yard line with 1:01 remaining. Burbank BOC played the closing football theme and gave the word cue, to the outraged shock of Ellis and Connal, and the connection was irretrievably broken. Although the western United States continued to view the game, the eastern half of the nation instead saw a little girl on a Swiss mountain and was unaware that Oakland was in the course of scoring two touchdowns to win the game.|$|E

25|$|Without {{much hope}} of dialog, Maldonado began {{his return to}} Mexico City under hostile conditions. When passing by the Ejido, San Miguel, a Zapatista patrol beckoned them to stop. Maldonado, {{surprised}} <b>and</b> <b>not</b> <b>knowing</b> what was happening, was handed a radio. Using it, Maldonado and Marcos resumed their dialog, and made agreements {{in accordance with the}} law to start the formal peace talks. Marcos convinced the Zapatista movement to put aside their arms and begin the talks to reach a peace agreement.|$|E
25|$|The prince {{next came}} across a railway {{switchman}} who told him how passengers constantly rushed {{from one place to}} another aboard trains, never satisfied with where they were <b>and</b> <b>not</b> <b>knowing</b> what they were after; only the children among them ever bothered to look out the windows. A merchant then talked to the prince about his product, a pill that eliminated thirst, which was very popular, saving people fifty-three minutes a week. The prince replied that he would instead gladly use that extra time to go around finding fresh water, again underscoring the materialism and lack of spirituality of a world that knows the price of everything and the value of nothing.|$|E

25|$|Price {{continued}} his cartage towards Fort Scott, Kansas. In {{the late afternoon}} of October 25, Price's supply train had difficulty crossing the Marmiton River ford and just as at Mine Creek earlier that afternoon, Price had to make another stand. Brig. Gen. John McNeil, commanding two brigades of Pleasonton's cavalry, engaged troops that Price and his officers had rallied from the earlier battles, including a sizable contingent of unarmed men. Observing the large Confederate force <b>and</b> <b>not</b> <b>knowing</b> that many were unarmed, McNeil refrained from an all-out assault. After about two hours of skirmishing Price recommenced his retreat, while McNeil could not mount an effective pursuit. Price's army was utterly broken by this time; now {{it was simply a}} question of whether he could escape, and how many men he could successfully evacuate to friendly territory.|$|E
25|$|On Tuesday, February 7, 2006, a UPS Douglas DC-8 {{cargo plane}} {{suffered}} an in-flight cargo fire {{and made an}} emergency landing at Philadelphia International Airport after filling with smoke. There were no injuries other than smoke inhalation affecting the crew, but the plane burned {{on the ground for}} hours into the night, though most of the cargo survived, the aircraft was a total loss, with multiple holes burned through the roof skin. According to the NTSB, the firefighting crew did not have adequate training on using their skin-piercing extinguishing equipment <b>and</b> <b>not</b> <b>knowing</b> how to open the main cargo door, attempted to force the handle and broke the latch, rendering the door unopenable. There were also difficulties in obtaining the cargo manifest to determine what if any hazardous materials were on board, due to confusion about protocol. However, despite these failings, the airport staff, including the firefighting staff, managed the incident successfully without injury or major disruption of the airport. The NTSB suspected lithium ion batteries were the source of ignition and made recommendations for more stringent rules and restrictions on their air transport, especially on passenger aircraft (unlike this one). For a cause of the incident, the NTSB focused on the delayed indication of fire by the required onboard fire detection system and criticized the standards to which such systems are tested, noting that the tests use an empty cargo hold and do not represent the real-world performance of the detection systems with the hold full of cargo, which significantly changes the flow patterns of hot air and smoke. The crew and air traffic control personnel were found to have behaved properly (with minor exceptions) and not to be at fault for the incident or its outcome.|$|E

500|$|Erik Adams of The A.V. Club {{compared}} Dwight and Clark's {{relationship to}} that of the mythical characters of King Laius and Oedipus, respectively. The story, which was later turned into a popular play Oedipus Rex by Greek writer Sophocles, tells of how Laius hears of a prophecy that his son will kill him. Fearing the prophecy, Laius abandons his son, Oedipus', who is raised in the city of Thebes. Oedipus later crosses paths with Laius and gets into a fight <b>and,</b> <b>not</b> <b>knowing</b> that Laius is his father, kills him. Adams, thus, states that the [...] "break-room conversation" [...] Dwight and Clark share starts to make Dwight paranoid and fear that Clark is after his job.|$|E
500|$|In an April 2007 {{interview}} with Entertainment Weekly, Fey revealed {{that she was}} once called [...] "the c word" [...] by one of her writers.

[...] In another interview, she was asked whether the c-word was based on experience, to which she said, [...] "It {{was a little bit}}. It was a little bit based on the experience of having someone call you that <b>and</b> <b>not</b> <b>knowing</b> how to deal with it.".

500|$|The two U.S. carrier groups swept {{around to}} the north of the Santa Cruz Islands on October 25 searching for the Japanese naval forces. A U.S. PBY Catalina based in the Santa Cruz Islands located the Japanese main body {{carriers}} at 11:03. However, the Japanese carriers were about [...] from the U.S. force, just beyond carrier aircraft range. Kinkaid, hoping to close the range to be able to execute an attack that day, steamed towards the Japanese carriers at top speed and, at 14:25, launched a strike force of 23 aircraft. But the Japanese, knowing that they had been spotted by U.S. aircraft <b>and</b> <b>not</b> <b>knowing</b> where the U.S. carriers were, turned to the north to stay out of range of the U.S. carriers' aircraft. Consequently the U.S. strike force returned to their carriers without finding or attacking the Japanese warships.|$|E
500|$|Though interested, yet {{frustrated}} {{about the}} writing style <b>and</b> <b>not</b> <b>knowing</b> {{what is going}} to happen next, upon starting, Armitage was told by co-star Peter Firth to learn to run with it, as well as learn the lines and political jargon quickly. He also thought the scripts are [...] "quite a workout for the brain." [...] Armitage was also coached on his [...] "serious face" [...] and the [...] "Spooks lean" [...] by Rupert Penry-Jones. The numerous tattoos on Lucas's torso were actually transfers planted on Armitage, and took a couple of hours to apply. However, he was often told not to move much, as they could rub off quite easily. Armitage was also one of only two actors, along with Hermione Norris, who plays Ros Myers, who went to Moscow, Russia in the series' first overseas shoot in August 2008.|$|E
500|$|Morris plays Brittany as [...] "literally insane", {{but also}} entirely well-meaning and goodhearted. She {{has said that}} Brittany [...] "love everybody, no matter who they are"; she is {{frequently}} smiling and being nice to people. Brittany's character traits include her finding recipes confusing, cheating off intellectually disabled classmates, thinking her cat, Lord Tubbington, is reading her diary, <b>and</b> <b>not</b> <b>knowing</b> her right hand from her left. These facts are often presented in one-liners delivered by Morris, many of which she has ad-libbed. Brittany's one-liners are regularly celebrated in reviews of Glee. The character's lack of intelligence and forthright manner of speaking means, as Morris puts it, that [...] "Brittany {{is used by the}} series' writers to say things no other character would". The character has also received positive reviews related to her romantic storyline with her closeted best friend Santana (Naya Rivera). While Brittany is bisexual, and is unashamed of that, Santana has trouble accepting her lesbianism. Brittany has continued to support Santana and urged her to be true to herself.|$|E

500|$|In {{a review}} for IGN, Matt Fowler wrote, [...] "With Jon's final choice in [...] "Oathbreaker," [...] the show {{seemed to make}} a huge step forward into the endgame. One where we might see {{things that have been}} set up for a long time start to pay off. Not everyone's story is firing on all {{cylinders}} at the moment, Tyrion was actively bored while waiting for news this week, but enough {{is going on in the}} North and at King's Landing to carry the series right now." [...] Likewise, Todd VanDerWerff of Vox wrote, [...] ""Oathbreaker" [...] is a crisp, lean, nicely paced episode of Game of Thrones. It's one of those episodes where the characters are mostly being positioned for future episodes, but it's a solidly executed version of that basic template." [...] Alyssa Rosenberg of the Washington Post wrote that she believed this was [...] "The strongest episode of the sixth season of Game of Thrones to date." [...] While Erik Kain of Forbes noted [...] "The season has been full of revelations, but things are still building. That's okay. I love the tension <b>and</b> <b>not</b> <b>knowing</b> exactly what's coming." ...|$|E
500|$|Busoni {{was elected}} in 1881 to the Accademia Filharmonica of Bologna, the {{youngest}} person to receive this honour since Mozart. In the mid 1880s he was based in Vienna where he met with Karl Goldmark and helped to prepare the vocal score for the latter's 1886 opera, Merlin. He also met Johannes Brahms, to whom he dedicated two sets of piano Etudes, and who recommended him to undertake study in Leipzig with Carl Reinecke. During this period he supported himself by giving recitals, and also by the financial support of a patron, the Baronin von Tedesco. He also continued to compose, and made his first attempt at an opera, Sigune, which he worked on from 1886 to 1889 before abandoning the project. [...] In a letter he describes how, finding himself penniless in Leipzig, he appealed to the publisher Schwalm to take his compositions. Schwalm demurred but said he would commission a fantasy on Peter Cornelius's opera The Barber of Baghdad for fifty marks down, and a hundred on completion. The next morning Busoni turned up at Schwalm's office, and asked for 150 marks, handing over the completed work: [...] "I worked from nine at night to three thirty, without a piano, <b>and</b> <b>not</b> <b>knowing</b> the opera beforehand." ...|$|E
500|$|Some of Brittany's {{most memorable}} lines are unscripted, and are instead devised by Murphy during filming, or improvised by Morris. Morris portrays Brittany as being [...] "literally insane." [...] She {{is used by}} the series' writers to say things no other {{character}} would, to the point that Morris considers some of her lines nonsensical. Brittany's character traits include her finding recipes confusing, cheating off intellectually disabled classmates, thinking her cat is reading her diary, <b>and</b> <b>not</b> <b>knowing</b> her right hand from her left. She is friendly towards all the other characters, and Morris has explained that Brittany [...] "love everybody, no matter who they are", so she is frequently smiling and being nice to people. Morris bases her portrayal of Brittany on the character Karen Smith from the film Mean Girls. She plays Brittany as being very innocent, rather than stupid. In the episode [...] "A Night of Neglect", Brittany participates in an academic decathlon as a seat warmer, but surprisingly ends up contributing to the win {{due to the fact that}} she is somewhat of an idiot savant on the topic of cat diseases. It is also revealed in [...] "Britney/Brittany" [...] that Brittany is also [...] "Britney Spears" [...] as her middle initial is [...] "S" [...] making her [...] "Brittany S. Pierce." ...|$|E
