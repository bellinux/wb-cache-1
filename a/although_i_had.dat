5|$|That {{first night}} of my {{imprisonment}} was the longest night I have ever passed in my life; {{it seemed as though}} the dawn of day would never come. I found in my bag a small Book of Common Prayer according to the ritual of the Episcopal Church. It was a great comfort to me, and before retiring to rest Mrs. Clark and I spent a few minutes in the devotions appropriate to the evening. Here, perhaps, I may say, that <b>although</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> been a regular attendant on the Presbyterian worship since my childhood, a constant contributor to all the missionary societies, and had helped to build their churches and ornament the walls, giving my time and my musical ability freely to make their meetings attractive to my people, yet none of these pious church members or clergymen remembered me in my prison. To this (Christian ?) conduct I contrast that of the Anglican bishop, Rt. Rev. Alfred Willis, who visited me {{from time to time in}} my house, and in whose church I have since been confirmed as a communicant. But he was not allowed to see me at the palace.|$|E
500|$|Tillman {{told the}} Senate, [...] "as {{governor}} of South Carolina, I proclaimed that, <b>although</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> taken {{the oath of}} office to support the law and enforce it, I would lead a mob to lynch any man, black or white, who ravished a woman, black or white." [...] He told his colleagues, [...] "I have three daughters, but, so help me God, I had rather find either one of them killed by a tiger or a bear [...] than to have her crawl to me and tell me the horrid story that she had been robbed of the jewel of her womanhood by a black fiend." [...] In 1907, he told the senators about the Ellenton riot of 1876, [...] "it was then that we shot them; it was then that we killed them; it was then that we stuffed the ballot-boxes." ...|$|E
500|$|The bottom {{section of}} Tilden's [...] "promontory" [...] extension, {{the dining room}} {{contains}} the original suite of table and dining chairs designed by Heal's to Churchill's exacting requirements – (see box). An early study for an planned picture by William Nicholson entitled Breakfast at Chartwell hangs in the room. Nicholson, a frequent visitor to Chartwell who gave Churchill painting lessons, drew the [...] study for a finished picture which {{was intended as a}} present for the Churchills' Silver Wedding anniversary in 1933 but, disliking the final version, Nicholson destroyed it. The picture depicts the Churchills breakfasting together, which in fact they rarely did, and Churchill's marmalade cat, Tango. The tradition of keeping a marmalade cat at Chartwell, which Churchill began and followed throughout his ownership, is maintained by the National Trust in accordance with Churchill's wishes. In a letter to Randolph written in May 1942, Churchill wrote of a brief visit to Chartwell the previous week, [...] "the goose and the black swan have both fallen victim to the fox. The Yellow Cat however made me sensible of his continuing friendship, <b>although</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> not been there for eight months".|$|E

[...] "It's strange <b>I</b> <b>have</b> never heard the story before; <b>although</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> had whispers of the scandal from several quarters. It seems to be a sort of {{skeleton}} in the closet' for the Challoners." ...|$|R
500|$|The {{story was}} an embarrassment for Trueblood and the university. In his memoirs, Handy {{recalled}} being summoned to Trueblood's office: [...] "His desk was {{piled high with}} letters...and clippings...from around the country...and {{he also had a}} copy of the McCutcheon cartoon. (He) was taking all of this as ridicule, <b>although</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> publicized the story with sincere enthusiasm for a new advance in education of which I felt the University of Michigan should be proud." [...] The faculty voted unanimously to suspend Handy for a year for [...] "publishing false and injurious statements affecting the character of the work of one of the Professors." [...] In addition to the suspension, Handy was charged as a [...] "faker" [...] in the press: Henry J. Handy, the student-correspondent at the University of Michigan who sent a sensational story to the Chicago newspapers, relating how Professor Thomas C. Trueblood had a class in love-making, has been suspended for one year and the story has been branded as a 'fake.' [...] Handy based the story on an incident that occurred during the rehearsal of a drama, when Professor Trueblood showed one of the students how to kneel to propose.|$|E
500|$|The {{species was}} first {{collected}} by the botanist William Russell Dudley in October 1888, in Tompkins County, New York. American mycologist Charles Horton Peck, who described it in the 1894 Annual Report of the New York State Botanist, named it Peziza Dudleyi after its discoverer. Peck noted a physical resemblance to P.aurantia (now known as Aleuria aurantia) and P.inaequalis, and said {{that it could be}} distinguished from those species by its yellow hymenium and larger spores. Several mycologists have considered the species to be synonymous with S.coccinea. However, as was later pointed out by Harrington (1990), [...] "the importance of fresh material for species diagnosis, especially for noting ascospore guttulation, cannot be overstated. <b>Although</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> examined material (dried herbarium specimens) from western North America I was not prepared to recognize that group as a species distinct from the two, large eastern North American species until I saw fresh (living) material." [...] As is the case with many fungi, microscopic differences between similar species can only be accurately determined by examining fresh material. Harrington analyzed herbarium specimens and fresh material of North American specimens of [...] "S.coccinea", and found that both S.dudleyi and S.austriaca were commonly misidentified. These results echoed a similar 1984 analysis of European specimens, performed by Hans-Otto Baral.|$|E

2500|$|Dungan {{announced}} his retirement from baseball in January 1906 at age 39. Dungan later recalled: [...] "I was fed up on baseball <b>although</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> {{one of my best}} years in 1905. I made up my mind I didn't want to follow the game indefinitely, limping {{from one place to another}} as my ability declined. And I had no managerial aspirations. So I just up and quit." ...|$|E
2500|$|I {{can still}} {{close my eyes}} and {{visualize}} its blue and purple label. It was a Bessie Smith recording of 'The Bleeding Hearted Blues,' with 'Midnight Blues' on the other side. The first time I laid the needle down on that record I felt cold chills and an indescribable excitement. It was my first exposure to jazz and the blues, <b>although</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> no idea at the time what to call those magical sounds. I just knew I had to hear more of them! — Frankie Laine ...|$|E
2500|$|Regarding {{most people}} not knowing {{she is the}} actual artist of the artwork, Ward stated: And who am I going to tell that I am behind the artwork? I don’t think most people {{think about all the}} work that happens behind the scenes. And it should be that way. The viewers should be caught up in the show. Anyway, it doesn’t come up much. I do have a niece who thinks it’s pretty cool. And I {{impressed}} a bunch of third-graders at career day at my daughter’s school. But they were much more excited by the work I did for the [...] Go figure...And drawing for [...] was exceptional. It wasn’t just a one-time gig for a movie that is out in theaters for a couple weeks. It was ongoing and evolving. <b>Although</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> {{nothing to do with the}} concepts behind Peyton’s art, and her drawings are a tiny part of the show, I have to admit I have loved hearing that people out there have connected with the artwork. I have received e-mails from [...] fans who say they love to draw and the artwork on the show is really important to them. How cool is that?! ...|$|E

2500|$|In 2004 Michael said [...] "I used {{to sleep}} with women quite {{a lot in the}} Wham! days but never felt it could develop into a {{relationship}} because I knew that, emotionally, I was a gay man. I didn't want to commit to them but I was attracted to them. Then I became ashamed that I might be using them. I decided I had to stop, which I did when I began to worry about AIDS, which was becoming prevalent in Britain. <b>Although</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> always had safe sex, I didn't want {{to sleep with}} a woman without telling her I was bisexual. I felt that would be irresponsible. Basically, I didn't want to have that uncomfortable conversation that might ruin the moment, so I stopped sleeping with them." [...] In the same interview, he added : [...] "If I wasn't with Kenny , I would have sex with women, no question". He said he believed that the formation of his sexuality was [...] "a nurture thing, via the absence of my father who was always busy working. It meant I was exceptionally close to my mother", though he stated that [...] "there are definitely those who have a predisposition to being gay in which the environment is irrelevant." ...|$|E
2500|$|The cabinet which Papen formed {{was known}} as the [...] "cabinet of barons" [...] or as the [...] "cabinet of monocles" [...] and was widely {{regarded}} with ridicule by Germans. Papen had virtually no support in the Reichstag; the only parties committed to supporting him was the far-right/national conservative German National People's Party (DNVP) and German People's Party. However, Papen became very close to Hindenburg. The French Ambassador André François-Poncet reported to his superiors in the Quai d'Orsay about Papen's influence on Hindenburg that [...] "It's he [...] who is the preferred one, the favorite of the Marshal; he diverts the old man through his vivacity, his playfulness; he flatters him by showing him respect and devotion; he beguiles him with his daring; he is in [...] eyes the perfect gentleman." [...] Papen first met Hitler in June 1932, and found him a ridiculous figure. Papen always spoke his German with an aristocratic, Westphalian accent and found Hitler with his lower-class Austrian accent of German to be an absurd man, deserving only of contempt. Papen wrote about his meeting with Hitler:"I found him curiously unimpressive. I could detect no inner quality which might explain his extraordinary hold on the masses. He was wearing a dark blue suit and seemed the complete petite-bourgeous. He had an unhealthy complexion, and with his little moustache and curious hair style had an indefinable bohemian quality. His demeanor was modest and polite, and <b>although</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> heard much about the magnetic quality of his eyes, I do not remember being impressed by them...As he talked about his party's aims I was struck by the fanatical insistence with which he presented his arguments. I realized that the fate of my Government would depend to a large extent on the willingness of this man and his followers to back me up, and that this would be the most difficult problem with which I should have to deal. He {{made it clear that he}} would not be content with a subordinate role and intended in due course to demand plenary powers for himself. 'I regard your Cabinet only as a temporary solution, and will continue my efforts to make my party the strongest in the country. The Chancellorship will then devolve on me', he said".|$|E
