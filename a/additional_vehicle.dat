5|$|The A2 is a tolled motorway, {{based on}} the vehicle {{classification}} in Croatia, using a closed toll system. As of July 2011, the toll charged along the A2 route between the Zaprešić and Trakošćan mainline toll plazas varies depending {{on the length of}} route travelled, ranging from 1.00 kuna (0.13 euros) to 42.00 kuna (5.48 euros) for passenger cars and 47.00 kuna (6.13 euro) to 187.00 kuna (24.40 euro) for semi-trailer trucks. The toll is payable in either Croatian kuna or euros and by major credit and debit cards. A prepaid toll collection system is also used. The A2 is the only motorway in Croatia which does not provide for use of the ENC—an electronic toll collection (ETC) system shared by most motorways in Croatia that provides drivers with discounted toll rates for dedicated lanes at toll plazas. In addition to the vehicle classification in Croatia, the motorway operator maintains an <b>additional</b> <b>vehicle</b> category for motorbikes, which are charged from 7.00 kuna (0.91 euros) to 25.00 kuna (3.26 euros) toll. The southernmost Jankomir–Zaprešić section of the motorway is not tolled, as {{it is part of the}} Zagreb bypass.|$|E
25|$|Eight Z06-R were {{constructed}} by Callaway Competition GmbH in Leingarten, Germany, for the 2006 season. The French team Riverside campaigned a three car team. In {{an effort to}} achieve parity among the disparate participants of the GT3 Series, three forms of handicapping were applied by the FIA regulators: <b>additional</b> <b>vehicle</b> weight, ride height, and tire compound selection. The Corvettes were raced with all three handicaps employed. The Z06R won the FIA GT3 European Championship in its second year of entry. By 2011, all Z06-R teams discontinued their racing efforts in GT3, ending the car's FIA career. Z06-Rs are also campaigned in national championships.|$|E
25|$|The East New York Depot, {{also called}} the East New York Base Shops, is located at One Jamaica Avenue/25 Jamaica Avenue at Bushwick Avenue in the Broadway Junction area of East New York, Brooklyn, {{just east of the}} New York City Subway's East New York Yard. The five-story {{structure}} is steel-framed with a brick exterior, with two stories for bus storage and repair shops. The facility was built to perform heavy maintenance, and served as New York City Bus' central maintenance facility until the opening of the Zerega and Grand Avenue facilities. Buses enter and exit the complex via numerous doors on Jamaica Avenue, with an <b>additional</b> <b>vehicle</b> entrance {{at the north end of}} the complex at Bushwick Avenue. The depot was built to house over 300 buses. It currently has space for around 280 buses, including two additional outdoor parking lots south of the depot: Havens Lot at Havens Place between Herkimer Street and Atlantic Avenue, and Herkimer Lot at Herkimer Street and Williams Place underneath the BMT Canarsie Line. The depot also features a paint shop, which is decommissioned and has been used to store buses at times. The north end of the depot (1720 Bushwick Avenue) is used to maintain the museum bus fleet along with Amsterdam Depot, and contains a repair shop for MTA Bus. Also, plans are underway to modify this depot to accommodate articulated-buses in the very near future.|$|E

By collecting the six Mystery Eggs and Ice Key in the Xbox Live Arcade re-release of Banjo-Kazooie, players will be able to find special vehicle part crates in Nuts & Bolts overworld, which can be used to unlock novelty vehicle parts, such as a disco ball or fuzzy dice.

500|$|Gameplay in the {{top-down}} perspective {{consists of}} a series of labyrinths in which players defeat enemies along the way. The player switches between the 2D platforming mode and the top-down perspective by leaving the tank and entering small doorways located throughout the game. While in the top-down perspective, players can move Jason in any direction and destroy mutants with a gun or with hand grenades. In this mode, players upgrade the gun by collecting gun capsules, but the gun degrades by one point if Jason receives damage from mutants or hazardous objects. Here players obtain <b>additional</b> <b>vehicle</b> functions by destroying bosses; these functions include weapon upgrades as well as abilities to swim freely underwater, drive on walls and ceilings, and hover above the ground. The game has a glitch – colloquially known as the [...] "grenade glitch" [...] – to easily defeat four of the game's underbosses. To exploit this glitch, the player throws a grenade at the boss, and while the grenade is exploding and causing damage on the boss, the player pauses the game. While the remainder of the action on the screen freezes, the grenade remains active, continuing to damage the boss. After fifteen seconds the player unpauses the game to find that the boss is destroyed.|$|E
2500|$|Mainstream {{transport}} {{planning in}} Europe has, by contrast, never {{been based on}} assumptions that the private car was the best or only solution for urban mobility. For example, the Dutch Transport Structure Scheme has since the 1970s required that demand for <b>additional</b> <b>vehicle</b> capacity only be met [...] "if the contribution to societal welfare is positive", and since 1990 has included an explicit target to halve {{the rate of growth}} in vehicle traffic. Some cities outside Europe have also consistently linked transport to sustainability and to land-use planning, notably Curitiba, Brazil, Portland, Oregon and Vancouver, Canada.|$|E

2500|$|In September 1989, the ES 250 and the {{flagship}} LS 400 {{went on sale}} in the United States. The ES 250 was marketed as the [...] "luxury sedan of sports sedans," [...] and carried a U.S. market suggested base price of approximately $22,000. During {{the first month of}} release, the ES 250 logged 1,216 units in sales. However, these numbers were eclipsed by the larger LS sedan, which unlike the ES was built on a unique and all-new platform. The original LS had been envisioned as a standalone model, but Lexus dealerships had asked for an <b>additional</b> <b>vehicle</b> to accompany its launch. Due to its similarities to the Camry, some viewed the ES 250 as a placeholder product of badge engineering and the vehicle ultimately did not sell as well as its larger counterpart. Initial perception of the ES led some to believe all the development time and research spent creating the larger LS showed that they overlooked {{one of the reasons the}} LS was developed, which was the 1986 Acura Legend, so it seems that the appearance of the LS was shrunk to fit the ES so as to compete with the Legend.|$|E
