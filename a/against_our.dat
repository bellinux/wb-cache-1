5|$|This bill {{establishes}} {{a weapon of}} violence <b>against</b> <b>our</b> citizenry far more wicked than anything ever known in recorded history — far worse than the Siberian prison camps of the Czars or the Communists, or {{the violence of the}} Spanish Inquisition … The plot of wickedness revealed in this bill fairly reeks of the evil odor of the black forces of the Jesuits who dominate the Vatican, and, through officiates in our Government, dominate our politics.|$|E
5|$|We should, however, be recreant to our duty, be {{unworthy of}} our gallant forefathers, and commit base treason <b>against</b> <b>our</b> posterity, should we permit Cuba to be Africanized {{and become a}} second St. Domingo (Haiti), with all its {{attendant}} horrors to the white race, and suffer the flames to extend to our own neighboring shores, seriously to endanger or actually to consume the fair fabric of our Union.|$|E
5|$|There is a race {{prejudice}} {{that exists}} between the white and Negro races wherever the Negroes are found in large numbers.... Just this week the announcement comes {{as a shock to}} the people of Oklahoma that the Secretary of the Interior... has appointed a Negro from Kansas to come to Oklahoma and take charge of the supervision of the Indian schools of this State. There is no race of people on earth that has more antipathy for the Negro race than the Indian race, and yet these people, numbering many of the best citizens of this State and nation, are to be humbled and their prejudices and passions are to be increased by having this outrage imposed upon them... If your organization would interest itself to the extent of seeing that such outrages as this are not perpetrated <b>against</b> <b>our</b> people, there would be fewer lynchings in the South than at this time...|$|E

5|$|Nietzsche {{rejected}} fundamental {{components of}} Kant's ethics, particularly his argument that morality, God, and immorality, {{can be shown}} through reason. Nietzsche cast suspicion {{on the use of}} moral intuition, which Kant used as the foundation of his morality, arguing that it has no normative force in ethics. He further attempted to undermine key concepts in Kant's moral psychology, such as the will and pure reason. Like Kant, Nietzsche developed a concept of autonomy; however, he rejected Kant's idea that valuing our own autonomy requires us to respect the autonomy of others. A naturalist reading of Nietzsche's moral psychology stands contrary to Kant's conception of reason and desire. Under the Kantian model, reason is a fundamentally different motive to desire because it has the capacity to stand back from a situation and make an independent decision. Nietzsche conceives of the self as a social structure of all our different drives and motivations; thus, when it seems that our intellect has made a decision <b>against</b> <b>our</b> drives, it is actually just an alternative drive taking dominance over another. This is in direct contrast with Kant's view of the intellect as opposed to instinct; instead, it is just another instinct. There is thus no self-capable of standing back and making a decision; the decision the self-makes is simply determined by the strongest drive. Kantian commentators have argued that Nietzsche's practical philosophy requires the existence of a self-capable of standing back in the Kantian sense. For an individual to create values of their own, which is a key idea in Nietzsche's philosophy, they must be able to conceive of themselves as a unified agent. Even if the agent is influenced by their drives, he must regard them as his own, which undermines Nietzsche's conception of autonomy.|$|E

25|$|He {{wrote that}} Mr. Yeltsin added, “I {{think we have}} {{committed}} a crime <b>against</b> <b>our</b> people by making {{their standard of living}} so incomparably lower than that of the Americans.” An aide, Lev Sukhanov was reported to have said that it was at that moment that “the last vestige of Bolshevism collapsed” inside his boss.|$|E

25|$|On 24 August 2016 a draft {{law for the}} ban of {{commercial}} surrogacy was cleared by the Union Cabinet and announced by Sushma Swaraj, the Minister of External Affairs (India).

25|$|Len Hutton was delirious with happiness. He, England's first {{professional}} captain, was leading a triumphant team – in Australia!...He frowns on 'sleeping with the enemy' and counsels <b>against</b> <b>our</b> {{going into the}} Aussie dressing-room to fraternise with our affable opponents. In Melbourne, however, he could afford to be magnanimous. After the game he threw {{open the door of}} the English dressing room. The champagne flowed, flooding well into the night.|$|E

25|$|The {{position}} of Irish Catholics is a cruel one. We are enslaved by a Protestant power. The penal laws <b>against</b> <b>our</b> religion {{are not yet}} abolished in full. The injurious social and economic results of these anti-Catholic laws will not be overcome for generations. To the present day we suffer political injury {{inside and outside of}} Ireland, simply and solely because we are practising Catholics. Sons of martyrs, we are known in every Masonic lodge and every anti-Catholic country as 'Papists', and par-excellence, the most devoted of all the children of the Holy See.|$|E
25|$|Today, the Senate sent {{a strong}} {{signal to the}} terrorists that we will {{continue}} using every element of national power to pursue our enemies and to prevent attacks on America. The Military Commissions Act of 2006 will allow the continuation of a CIA program that {{has been one of}} America's most potent tools in fighting the War on Terror. Under this program, suspected terrorists have been detained and questioned about threats <b>against</b> <b>our</b> country. Information we have learned from the program has helped save lives at home and abroad. By authorizing the creation of military commissions, the Act will also allow us to prosecute suspected terrorists for war crimes.|$|E
25|$|In 2013, in {{a lawsuit}} <b>against</b> <b>our</b> church, a woman accused my husband and three others of molesting her twenty-five years earlier. She didn’t {{remember}} the alleged “abuses” before her thirties, and then believed she was recovering lost memories. She also imagined that 18 people witnessed the abuse, and she listed them by name. However, none of those named supported her stories of abuse. Montgomery County police investigated and filed no charges. After eighteen months, an independent investigator concluded her accusations likely never happened. But that didn’t spare us from a witch hunt. In the initial months, the accused were labeled child sex offenders {{and the story of}} the abuse, truth be damned, was aggressively promoted in news, radio and social media.|$|E

500|$|In France, a Wehrmacht {{propaganda}} company frequently accompanied Rommel on his inspection {{trips to}} document {{his work for}} both domestic and foreign audiences. In May 1944, the German newsreels reported on Rommel's speech at a Wehrmacht conference, where he stated his conviction that [...] "every single German soldier will make his contribution against the Anglo-American spirit that it deserves for its criminal and bestial air war campaign <b>against</b> <b>our</b> homeland." [...] The speech led to an upswing in morale and sustained confidence in Rommel.|$|E
500|$|Georgia's defense, ranked {{fifth in}} the SEC, was no less a concern for Virginia Tech's offense. [...] "Defense {{is one of the}} major aspects of the SEC", said Georgia center Nick Jones before the game. [...] "You face great {{defenses}} week in and week out, and we face a great one week in and week out in practice <b>against</b> <b>our</b> defense. We've been up against great defenses and great personnel, so it's nothing new for us." [...] Heading into the game, Georgia was ranked ninth in total defense, giving up only 264yards per game, and 22nd in scoring defense, allowing an average of just 17.1points a game.|$|E
500|$|Paul Golding, {{leader of}} Britain First and former British National Party councillor, was {{announced}} via Facebook as their intended candidate. The announcement (which was later removed) said that Britain First [...] "will not rest until every traitor is punished for their crimes <b>against</b> <b>our</b> country. And by punished, I mean good old-fashioned British justice {{at the end}} of a rope!" [...] Britain First had several of their proposed running slogans banned by the Electoral Commission for being offensive. Golding, who was convicted of harassment in 2015, was on police bail during the election campaign after being arrested for wearing a military uniform with political objective.|$|E

500|$|Fisher {{recommended}} Louis as First Sea Lord: [...] "He is {{the most}} capable administrator in the Admiralty's list by a long way", but elements of the British press were against his appointment {{on the grounds that}} he was a German. Horatio Bottomley said it was [...] "a crime <b>against</b> <b>our</b> Empire to trust our secrets of National Defence to any alien-born official". In December 1911, Louis did return to the Admiralty but as Second rather than First Sea Lord. As Second Sea Lord, Louis pushed through improvements in working conditions for the ratings, and created an Admiralty War Staff that would prepare the navy's plans in case of war. He was promoted to full admiral on 13 July 1912.|$|E
500|$|For Bhattacharya, Ahalya is {{the eternal}} woman who {{responds}} to her inner urges and the advances {{of the divine}} ruler, a direct contrast to her ascetic husband, who did not satisfy her carnal desire. The author regards Ahalya as an independent woman who makes her own decisions, takes risks and is driven by curiosity to experiment with the extraordinary and then accept the curse imposed on her by patriarchal society. It is this undaunted acceptance of the curse that makes the Ramayana praise and venerate her. V. R. Devika, author of Ahalya: Scarlet Letter, asks, [...] "So is it right to condemn adultery and physical encounters as modern afflictions and <b>against</b> <b>our</b> [...] culture? Or do we learn from Ahalya who made a conscious choice to fulfil her need and yet has been extolled?" ...|$|E
500|$|Starting in 1967 and {{continuing}} until 1986, the Albanian government {{carried out a}} policy of [...] "bunkerisation" [...] that saw the construction {{of hundreds of thousands}} of bunkers across the country. They were built in every possible location, ranging from [...] "beaches and mountains, in vineyards and pastures, in villages and towns, even on the manicured lawns of Albania's best hotel". Hoxha envisaged Albania fighting a two-front war against an attack mounted by Yugoslavia, NATO or the Warsaw Pact involving a simultaneous incursion by up to eleven enemy airborne divisions. As he put it, [...] "If we slackened our vigilance even for a moment or toned down our struggle <b>against</b> <b>our</b> enemies in the least, they would strike immediately like the snake that bites you and injects its poison before you are aware of it." ...|$|E
