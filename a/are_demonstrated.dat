25|$|From an {{evolutionary}} perspective, {{it has been}} hypothesized that the executive system may have evolved to serve several adaptive purposes. The prefrontal lobe in humans has been associated both with metacognitive executive functions and emotional executive functions. Theory and evidence suggest that the frontal lobes in other primates also mediate and regulate emotion, but do not demonstrate the metacognitive abilities that <b>are</b> <b>demonstrated</b> in humans. This uniqueness of the executive system to humans implies that there was also something unique about the environment of ancestral humans, which {{gave rise to the}} need for executive functions as adaptations to that environment. Some examples of possible adaptive problems that would have been solved by the evolution of an executive system are: social exchange, imitation and observational learning, enhanced pedagogical understanding, tool construction and use, and effective communication.|$|E
25|$|A science {{documentary}} by EBS {{has revealed}} that Chang Bogo-class submarines undergo major generational overhaul and refit every eight to twelve years. The overhaul and refit involves periodic cutting, complete disassembly, and rewelding of the hull for the upgrade or total replacement of the submarine's old engines, navigational equipment, batteries, and other essential equipment with their modern counterparts. Hull stretch may also {{have taken place in}} some of the Chang Bogo-class vessels since the early 2000s, but it has neither been completely confirmed nor denied. Some Chang Bogo-class vessels <b>are</b> <b>demonstrated</b> to have sub-Harpoon launching capability when previously the class was lacking it.
