5000|$|Aerophagia (var. <b>aerophagy)</b> is a {{condition}} of excessive air swallowing, which goes to the stomach. Aerophagia may also refer to an unusual condition where the primary symptom is excessive flatus, belching is not present, and the actual mechanism by which air enters the gut is obscure. [...] Aerophagia in psychiatry is sometimes attributed to nervousness or anxiety.|$|E
50|$|Some of {{the gases}} are {{produced}} by bacteria which live in symbiosis within the large intestines of humans and other mammals. The gases are created as a by-product of the bacteria's digestion of food into relatively simpler substances. The oxygen and nitrogen component of flatus can {{be accounted for by}} <b>aerophagy,</b> while the CO2 component results from the reaction of stomach acids (HCl) with pancreatic bile (NaHCO3).|$|E
40|$|Gastric Dilatation is a {{potentially}} fatal gastrointestinal pathology caused by <b>aerophagy.</b> It is {{mainly caused by}} rapid consumption of food, excitation or exercising near the time of feeding, which promotes the entrance of air into the stomach (Robbins et al, 2011). 	With this work we aim to emphasize the care given by veterinary nurses in this pathology. FCT e CI&DETS (Pest â€“ OE/CEU/UI 4016 / 2011...|$|E
40|$|The {{introduction}} of proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) {{was a huge}} step forward {{in the treatment of}} gastric acid-related disorders such as reflux disease and gastric ulcers. Despite the strong effectiveness of PPIs, in a small number of patients reflux symptoms are not adequately relieved by these drugs. The amount of acid inhibition that can be achieved using a PPI depends on a number of different factors, such as Helicobacter pylori infection, genetic variation in metabolizing enzymes, and lack of compliance. Nocturnal gastric acid breakthrough {{does not appear to be}} important in the pathogenesis of therapy-resistant reflux symptoms. Not all reflux from the stomach into the oesophagus appears to be acidic. Episodes of non-acid reflux may also elicit typical reflux symptoms. This can be established by impedance measurements of the oesophagus. However, most patients whose symptoms do not respond satisfactorily to PPI therapy appear not to have reflux disease but instead be suffering from other conditions such as functional dyspepsia, <b>aerophagy</b> or rumination. Careful history-taking is pivotal in patients with reflux symptoms and should always precede additional investigations such as upper endoscopy and if necessary 24 -hour reflux monitorin...|$|E
40|$|In {{the early}} days of {{abdominal}} surgery, surgeons particularly dreaded two post-operative complications: one was pulmonary embolus and the other acute gastric dilatation. The mortality rate of all reported cases of acute gastric dilatation analysed in 1907 was 72 %. Doolin, in 1918, reported reduction in mortality to 7 % with the use of postural treatment and gastric lavage. Today this condition is not common, and is almost never the sole cause of death. This is almost entirely due to the routine use of gastric suction during and after major abdominal operations. However, it is probable that acute gastric dilatation is more common than the records show. Many mild cases go undiagnosed or are misdiagnosed as persistent post-anaesthetic vomiting, excessive post-operative vomiting, ileus, mild peritonitis, gastric retention, excessive <b>aerophagy</b> or just a epigastric distress, thought to be "normal " after an operation on the abdomen. It {{is important to remember that}} 15 - 20 % of all cases of acute gastric dilatation occur following conditions other than abdominal surgery. In the following discussion, one should keep in mind that this problem, like that of carcinoma of the cervix, is not so much one of diagnosis as one of maintenance of a high index of suspicion. DESCRIPTION Acute gastric dilatation is a condition in which there is sudden dilatation of the stomach with retention in the atonic dilated stomach of gastric, of duodenal, biliary and pancreatic secretions, as well as air, 75 % of which is swallowed. In the untreated case, this results in regurgitant vomiting of hematin-tinged vomitus, progressive de-hydration, hypovolemia, hypochloremia, alkalosis, shock, coma and death. INCIDENCE 65 to 70 % of cases of acute post-operative dilatation of the stomach follow abdominal operations. A few cases occur during operation due to the forcing of an-aesthetic gases into the stomach. The remaining situations when one sees acute gastric dilatation are: 1. After operations on the extemities; 2. After abdominal injury...|$|E
