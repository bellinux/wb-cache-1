5|$|The {{estimated}} {{prevalence of}} active epilepsy (as of 2012) {{is in the}} range 3–10 per 1,000, with active epilepsy defined as someone with epilepsy {{who has had a}} least one unprovoked seizure in the last five years. Epilepsy begins each year in 40–70 per 100,000 in developed countries and 80–140 per 100,000 in developing countries. Poverty is a risk and includes both being from a poor country and being poor relative to others within one's country. In the developed world epilepsy most commonly starts either in the young or in the old. In the developing world its onset is more common in older children and young adults due to the higher rates of trauma and infectious diseases. In developed countries the number of cases a year has decreased in children and increased <b>among</b> <b>the</b> <b>elderly</b> between the 1970s and 2003. This has been attributed partly to better survival following strokes in the elderly.|$|E
5|$|People with {{epilepsy}} are at {{an increased}} risk of death. This increase is between 1.6 and 4.1 fold greater than that of the general population and is often related to: the underlying cause of the seizures, status epilepticus, suicide, trauma, and sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP). Death from status epilepticus is primarily due to an underlying problem rather than missing doses of medications. The risk of suicide is increased between two and six times in those with epilepsy. The cause of this is unclear. SUDEP appears to be partly related to the frequency of generalized tonic-clonic seizures and accounts for about 15% of epilepsy related deaths. It is unclear how to decrease its risk. The greatest increase in mortality from epilepsy is <b>among</b> <b>the</b> <b>elderly.</b> Those with epilepsy due to an unknown cause have little increased risk. In the United Kingdom, it is estimated that 40–60% of deaths are possibly preventable. In the developing world, many deaths are due to untreated epilepsy leading to falls or status epilepticus.|$|E

40|$|Introduction. Poor {{oral health}} among elderly is most common dental problem nowadays, {{especially}} <b>among</b> <b>the</b> institutionalized persons. Aim. To detect DMFT index <b>among</b> <b>the</b> institutionalized <b>elderly.</b> Material and Method. Oral examination {{was made to}} make adequate evaluation. A total number of 70 subjects were evaluated. DMFT index has been detected only with dental mirror and probe, without using additional instruments and methods. Results. Average value of DMFT index in our survey was 24. 84 ± 4. 56 (with Confidence interval from 23. 77 to 25. 89). M-component was dominant - 21. 56 ± 7. 79 (with Confidence interval from 15. 74 to 23. 38). D-component indicated by carious teeth and persistent roots had value 2. 60 ± 3. 54 (with Confidence interval from 1. 77 to 3. 42). Mean value of teeth with definitive fillings (F-component of DMFT index) was 0. 34 ± 1. 42 (with Confidence interval from 0. 33 to 1. 01). Conclusion. DMFT index <b>among</b> <b>the</b> institutionalized <b>elderly</b> {{had one of the}} biggest values in the literature. M-component was dominant and indicator of the absence of many teeth.

25|$|By the 1950s, it {{appeared}} that absolute poverty was a minor problem although pockets did remain, for example <b>among</b> <b>the</b> <b>elderly,</b> but {{it was believed that}} increased welfare benefits would soon eradicate this lingering poverty.

40|$|This study {{determined}} {{the prevalence of}} oral mucosal alterations and associated factors <b>among</b> <b>the</b> institutionalized <b>elderly</b> in Brazil.

25|$|Members of {{the plant}} family Cucurbitacea, which {{includes}} zucchini/marrows, pumpkins and cucumbers, can contain toxins called cucurbitacins. These are chemically classified as steroids; they defend the plants from predators, and have a bitter taste to humans. Cultivated cucurbitaceae are bred for low levels of the toxin and are safe to eat. However, ornamental pumpkins can {{have high levels of}} cucurbitacins, and such ornamental plants can cross-fertilize edible cucurbitaceae—any such cross-fertilized seeds used by the gardener for growing food in the following season can therefore potentially produce bitter and toxic fruit. Also, dry weather conditions/irregular watering can stress the plant and favor the production of the toxin. The toxin is not destroyed by cooking. Humans with an impaired sense of taste (particularly <b>among</b> <b>the</b> <b>elderly)</b> should therefore ask a younger person to taste the zucchini for them.|$|E

25|$|Government {{safety net}} {{programs}} {{put in place}} since the War on Poverty have helped reduce the poverty rate from 26% in 1967 to 16% in 2012, according to a Supplemental Poverty Model (SPM) created by Columbia University, while the official U.S. Poverty Rate has not changed, as the economy by itself {{has done little to}} reduce poverty. According to the 2013 Columbia University study which created the (SPM) method of measuring poverty, without such programs the poverty rate would be 29% today. An analysis of the study by Kevin Drum suggests the American welfare state effectively reduces poverty <b>among</b> <b>the</b> <b>elderly</b> but provides relatively little assistance to the working-age poor. A 2014 study by Pew Charitable Trusts shows that without social programs like food stamps, social security and the federal EITC, the poverty rate in the U.S. would be much higher. Nevertheless, the U.S. has the weakest social safety net of all developed nations. Sociologist Monica Prasad of Northwestern University argues that this developed because of government intervention rather than lack of it, which pushed consumer credit for meeting citizens' needs rather than applying social welfare policies as in Europe.|$|E
25|$|Assuming {{that low}} turnout is a {{reflection}} of disenchantment or indifference, a poll with very low turnout may not be an accurate reflection of the will of the people. On the other hand, if low turnout {{is a reflection}} of contentment of voters about likely winners or parties, then low turnout is as legitimate as high turnout, as long as the right to vote exists. Still, low turnouts can lead to unequal representation among various parts of the population. In developed countries, non-voters tend to be concentrated in particular demographic and socioeconomic groups, especially the young and the poor. However, in India, which boasts an electorate of more than 814 million people, the opposite is true. The poor, who comprise the majority of the demographic, are more likely to vote than the rich and the middle classes, and turnout is higher in rural areas than urban areas. In low-turnout countries, these groups are often significantly under-represented in elections. This has the potential to skew policy. For instance, a high voter turnout <b>among</b> <b>the</b> <b>elderly</b> coupled with a low turnout among the young may lead to more money for retirees' health care, and less for youth employment schemes. Some nations thus have rules that render an election invalid if too few people vote, such as Serbia, where three successive presidential elections were rendered invalid in 2003.|$|E
