500|$|Shepherd's death {{came as a}} {{shock to}} the {{audience}} and was a major topic of discussion among critics, who gave polarising views on the character's exit. Janalen Samson, a contributing Writer for BuddyTV noted the episodes generation of shock in the times of the omnipresent media saying, [...] "Genuine surprise is a rare occurrence in television viewing these days", and added, [...] "Imagine my amazement, then, when I sat down to watch [...] "How to Save a Life"". Calling the death a [...] "lightning bolt" [...] David Hinckley of New York Daily News wrote, [...] "In one of the most stunning moments from a high-mortality television season, [...] "Grey's Anatomy" [...] killed off Patrick Dempsey's Dr. Derek Shepherd". <b>Also</b> <b>talking</b> about the shock value Shepherd's death in her New York Post review Lindsay Putnam wrote, [...] "“Grey’s Anatomy” did the unthinkable, killing off {{one of the few remaining}} original cast members", additionally putting up the question of the future of the series asking, [...] "with Derek out of the picture, what will become of the rest of the Grey Sloan Memorial Hospital family? Is there still a future for “Grey’s Anatomy”?" [...] The sentiment was echoed by Slate writer Aisha Harris who weighed heavily upon importance of the death and its impact saying that despite the show’s ensemble cast, [...] "Meredith has always remained the central figure of Grey’s, so this death marks a very important turning point in the show". Optimistic of the prospects for the show, she added, [...] "if anyone can come out of this tragedy as a tougher, better character than ever, it’s Meredith Grey." ...|$|E

2500|$|There {{was no real}} consensus, {{at least}} among {{surviving}} Roman texts and epitaphs, {{of what happened to}} a person after death or the existence of an afterlife. Pliny the Elder in his Naturalis Historia claims that most people are of the opinion that after death one returns to the non-sensing state that occurred before birth but admits, however scornfully, {{that there are people who}} believe in the immortality of the soul. Seneca the Younger seems to be less consistent, arguing both sides, indicating that death brings about utter annihilation while <b>also</b> <b>talking</b> about some survival of the spirit after it escapes from the prison of the body. Tacitus at the end of Agricola takes the opposite opinion to Pliny, and claims that the wise believe the spirit does not die with the body, although he may be specifically referring to the pious [...] – which harkens to the mythological idea of Elysium. It is important to keep in mind that these are the opinions of a select few well-educated elite males and may not be characteristic of all of Roman views.|$|E

60|$|D'Aguilar was a {{pleasant}} cavalier <b>also,</b> <b>talking</b> of many things grave and gay, until at length even Castell forgot his thoughts, and grew cheerful as they cantered forward through the fresh spring morning by heath and hill and woodland, listening to the singing of the birds, and watching the husbandmen at their labour. This ride was but {{the first of several}} that they took, since d'Aguilar knew their hours of exercise, even when they changed them, and whether they asked him or not, joined or met them in such a natural fashion that they could not refuse his company. Indeed, they were much puzzled to know how he came to be so well acquainted with their movements, and even with the direction in which they proposed to ride, but supposed that he must have it from the grooms, although these were commanded to say nothing, and always denied having spoken with him. That Betty should speak of such matters, or even find opportunity of doing so, never chanced to cross their minds, who did not guess that if they rode with d'Aguilar in the morning, Betty often walked with him in the evening when {{she was supposed to be}} at church, or sewing, or visiting her aunt upon the wharf at Westminster. But of these walks the foolish girl said nothing, for her own reasons.|$|E
