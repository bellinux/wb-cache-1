5|$|The Whole Object <b>Assumption</b> <b>is</b> {{the belief}} that labels refer to whole objects instead of parts or {{properties}} of those objects. Children are believed to hold this assumption because they typically label whole objects first, and parts of properties of objects later in development.|$|E

5|$|A {{mirror on}} the back wall {{reflects}} the upper bodies and heads of two figures identified from other paintings, and by Palomino, as King PhilipIV(10) and Queen Mariana(11). The most common <b>assumption</b> <b>is</b> that the reflection shows the couple in the pose they are holding for Velázquez as he paints them, while their daughter watches; and that the painting therefore shows {{their view of the}} scene.|$|E
50|$|Explicit <b>assumptions</b> <b>are</b> fully {{revealed}} without vagueness, implication, or ambiguity—though in a plan, {{they often}} rely on implicit <b>assumptions.</b> Implicit <b>assumptions</b> <b>are</b> not expressed and may go undetected. If implicit <b>assumptions</b> <b>are</b> wrong, this can damage projects.|$|R

5|$|Although less used, the {{separability}} <b>assumption</b> <b>is</b> {{considered more}} general because every stochastic process has a separable version. It {{is also used}} {{when it is not}} possible to construct a stochastic process in a Skorokhod space. For example, separability is assumed when constructing and studying random fields, where the collection of random variables is now indexed by sets other than the real line such as -dimensional Euclidean space.|$|E
5|$|Another {{hypothesis}} is that the Anahim hotspot is supplied by a miniplume. These mantle plumes have their roots in the upper mantle but they may later originate from the lower mantle. Arguments for an Anahim miniplume are centred {{on the existence of}} two small dike swarms at the western (hence oldest) end of the Anahim Volcanic Belt. This <b>assumption</b> <b>is</b> in turn based on the notion that giant dike swarms mark the arrival of deep-seated mantle plumes.|$|E
5|$|As all {{the stars}} of a {{globular}} cluster are at approximately the same distance from us, their absolute magnitudes differ from their visual magnitude by about the same amount. The main-sequence stars in the globular cluster will fall along a line that {{is believed to be}} comparable to similar stars in the solar neighborhood. The accuracy of this <b>assumption</b> <b>is</b> confirmed by comparable results obtained by comparing the magnitudes of nearby short-period variables, such as RR Lyrae stars and cepheid variables, with those in the cluster.|$|E
30|$|The {{convexity}} <b>assumptions</b> <b>are</b> {{standard in}} the context of GNEPs. The smoothness <b>assumptions</b> <b>are</b> also very natural since our aim is to develop locally fast convergent methods for the solution of GNEPs.|$|R
50|$|Building a model {{requires}} abstraction. <b>Assumptions</b> <b>are</b> used in modelling {{in order}} to specify the domain of application of the model. For example, the special theory of relativity assumes an inertial frame of reference. This <b>assumption</b> <b>was</b> contextualized and further explained by {{the general theory of}} relativity. A model makes accurate predictions when its <b>assumptions</b> <b>are</b> valid, and might well not make accurate predictions when its assumptions do not hold. Such <b>assumptions</b> <b>are</b> often the point with which older theories are succeeded by new ones (the general theory of relativity works in non-inertial reference frames as well).|$|R
5000|$|Beyond paradoxes, stuff {{just does}} not add up, unless more <b>assumptions</b> <b>are</b> {{introduced}} into Marx's examples, raising {{the question of}} which <b>assumptions</b> <b>are</b> legitimate to make, and whether they can solve anything without creating further inconsistencies.|$|R
5|$|If the {{official}} <b>assumption</b> <b>is</b> confirmed, Flight 370 {{was at the}} time of its disappearance the deadliest aviation incident in the history of Malaysian Airlines, surpassing the 1977 hijacking and crash of Malaysian Airline System Flight 653 that killed all 100 passengers and crew on board, and the deadliest involving a Boeing 777, surpassing Asiana Airlines Flight 214 (3 fatalities). In both of those categories, Flight 370 was surpassed 131 days later by Malaysia Airlines Flight 17, another Boeing 777-200ER, which was shot down on 17 July 2014, killing all 298 people aboard.|$|E
5|$|The {{absolute}} {{minimum requirement}} of any body of Freemasons {{is that the}} candidate must be free, and considered to be of good character. There is usually an age requirement, varying greatly between Grand Lodges, and (in some jurisdictions) capable of being overridden by a dispensation from the Grand Lodge. The underlying <b>assumption</b> <b>is</b> that the candidate should be a mature adult.|$|E
5|$|The {{arterial}} bubble <b>assumption</b> <b>is</b> {{also consistent}} with the accidental production of arterial bubbles. One scenario considers a shunt at the heart or lung level that passes bubbles from the venous to the arterial side. A patent foramen ovale (PFO) is thought to only open in certain conditions. A PFO conveniently explains neurological accidents after recreational air diving without any procedure violation, {{but it does not}} explain vestibular hits in deep diving. Vestibular symptoms can appear very early in the decompression, long before the massive bubble production required to overload the system.|$|E
5000|$|Shared basic <b>assumptions</b> <b>are</b> {{the deeply}} embedded, taken-for-granted {{behaviours}} {{which are usually}} unconscious, but constitute the essence of culture.

50|$|If the <b>assumptions</b> <b>are</b> violated, a {{possible}} {{solution is to}} use the Greenhouse & Geisser or the Huynh & Feldt adjustments to the degrees of freedom because they can correct for issues that can arise should the sphericity of the covariance matrix <b>assumption</b> <b>be</b> violated.|$|R
5|$|The {{arterial}} bubble <b>assumption</b> <b>is</b> {{that the}} filtering {{capacity of the}} lung has a threshold radius {{of the size of}} a red blood cell and that sufficiently small decompression bubbles can pass to the arterial side, especially during the initial phase of ascent. Later in the ascent, bubbles grow to a larger size and remain trapped in the lung. This may explain why conventional Doppler measurements have not detected any bubbles in the arterial circulation.|$|E
5|$|The {{instructions}} in Compendium ferculorum are succinct and often vague, lacking such elements of modern culinary recipes as lists of ingredients used, measurements or proportions, and cooking times. The underlying <b>assumption</b> <b>is</b> {{that they are}} to be used by a professional chef rather than a person with little cooking experience. The recipe for stewed meat in saffron sauce, cited below, is typical is this regard.|$|E
5|$|Albatrosses {{combine these}} soaring {{techniques}} {{with the use}} of predictable weather systems: albatrosses in the Southern Hemisphere flying north from their colonies will take a clockwise route, and those flying south will fly counterclockwise. Albatrosses are so well adapted to this lifestyle that their heart rates while flying are close to their basal heart rate when resting. This efficiency is such that the most energetically demanding aspect of a foraging trip is not the distance covered, but the landings, take-offs and hunting they undertake having found a food source. A common <b>assumption</b> <b>is</b> that albatrosses must be able to sleep in flight, although no direct evidence has ever been obtained.|$|E

5|$|As {{a thought}} {{experiment}} in economics, many international trade economists {{have found this}} simplified and idealized {{version of the story}} important due to its ability to simplify the complexities of the real world. The implicit <b>assumption</b> <b>is</b> that the study of a one agent economy will provide useful insights into the functioning of a real world economy with many economic agents. This article pertains to the study of consumer behaviour, producer behaviour and equilibrium as a part of microeconomics. In other fields of economics, the Robinson Crusoe economy framework is used for essentially the same thing. For example, in public finance the Robinson Crusoe economy is used to study the various types of public goods and certain aspects of collective benefits. It is used in growth economics to develop growth models for underdeveloped or developing countries to embark upon a steady growth path using techniques of savings and investment.|$|E
5|$|Interest rate parity {{rests on}} certain assumptions, the first being that capital is mobile - investors can readily {{exchange}} domestic assets for foreign assets. The second <b>assumption</b> <b>is</b> that assets have perfect substitutability, following from their similarities in riskiness and liquidity. Given capital mobility and perfect substitutability, investors {{would be expected}} to hold those assets offering greater returns, be they domestic or foreign assets. However, both domestic and foreign assets are held by investors. Therefore, it must be true that no difference can exist between the returns on domestic assets and the returns on foreign assets. That {{is not to say that}} domestic investors and foreign investors will earn equivalent returns, but that a single investor on any given side would expect to earn equivalent returns from either investment decision.|$|E
5|$|Knowing that Cleomenes got {{the money}} to pay for his mercenaries from Ptolemy, Antigonus, {{according}} to Peter Green, seems to have ceded some territory in Asia Minor to Ptolemy in return for Ptolemy withdrawing his financial support of Sparta. Whether this <b>assumption</b> <b>is</b> accurate or not, Ptolemy certainly withdrew his support, which left Cleomenes without money to pay for his mercenaries. Desperate, Cleomenes freed all helots able to pay five Attic minae; in this way he accumulated 500 talents of silver. He also armed 2,000 of the ex-helots in Macedonian style to counter the White Shields, the Macedonian crack troops, before planning a major initiative.|$|E

5|$|P.acicularis is {{probably}} the most abundant species of the genus. Most specimens have been found on the west coast of North America as far north as Alaska, but it has been reported most frequently from British Columbia and Washington. The species is found in China, Japan, Korea, and Taiwan, and has also been reported from the Russian arctic. In general, P.acicularis seems to prefer an oceanic climate without extremely low temperatures, at least in comparison with other species of the genus. This <b>assumption</b> <b>is</b> supported by the fact that P.acicularis is found more southerly (34 findings in California) than all other species and is less frequently found in northern Alaska where, for example, P.robustus and P.vegae are more common. P.acicularis is rare east of the Rocky Mountains.|$|E
5|$|The {{growth rate}} hypothesis, {{also known as}} the {{resource}} availability hypothesis, states that defense strategies are determined by the inherent growth rate of the plant, which is in turn determined by the resources available to the plant. A major <b>assumption</b> <b>is</b> that available resources are the limiting factor in determining the maximum growth rate of a plant species. This model predicts that the level of defense investment will increase as the potential of growth decreases. Additionally, plants in resource-poor areas, with inherently slow-growth rates, tend to have long-lived leaves and twigs, and the loss of plant appendages may result in a loss of scarce and valuable nutrients.|$|E
5|$|It {{took some}} time before a Bishop of Lithuania was {{appointed}} because of various conflicts of interest. The Bishop of Gniezno appointed Vito (Lithuanian: Vitas), a monk of the Dominican Order, to this position, {{but he was not}} recognized by Mindaugas or accepted by the populace. The activities of Vito in Lithuania are unknown, although he is sometimes associated with Mindaugas' Cathedral. Finally, in 1254, Christian (Lithuanian: Kristijonas) from the Livonian Order was appointed. Mindaugas endowed him with some lands in Samogitia, but not much is known about his activities. Historical sources do not mention any sponsorship of missionaries, education of priests, or construction of churches during that time, and Bishop Christian went back to Germany in 1259, where he died in 1271. The establishment of Mindaugas' Cathedral remains problematic, but recent archeological research found the remains of a 13th-century brick building {{on the site of the}} present-day Vilnius Cathedral. The general <b>assumption</b> <b>is</b> that the remains are those of Mindaugas Cathedral, built to satisfy the agreement with the pope. However, as later events showed, Lithuanians resisted Christianization, and Mindaugas' baptism had only a temporary impact on further developments.|$|E
