5|$|Of the 50 {{recovered}} episodes, several <b>are</b> <b>missing</b> short segments – due {{either to}} overseas censorship or to {{damage to the}} surviving film print. The following table shows all affected episodes, and the total duration of missing material.|$|E

5|$|Some American {{alligators}} <b>are</b> <b>missing</b> an inhibited {{gene for}} melanin, {{which makes them}} albino. These American alligators are extremely rare and almost impossible {{to find in the}} wild. They could only survive in captivity, as they are very vulnerable to the sun and predators.|$|E
5|$|The type {{specimen}} of Kritosaurus navajovius is only {{represented by a}} partial skull and lower jaws, and associated postcranial remains. The greater portion of the muzzle and upper beak <b>are</b> <b>missing.</b>|$|E
5|$|As for {{the most}} clues {{possible}} in a Sudoko while still not rendering a unique solution, it is four short of a full grid (77). If two instances of two numbers each <b>are</b> <b>missing</b> and the cells they are to occupy are the corners of an orthogonal rectangle, and exactly two of these cells are within one region, {{there are two ways}} the last digits can be added (two solutions).|$|E

5|$|Investigating further, Mulder and Scully {{learn that}} Fiore, Barbala, Felder and Morris had all worked closely {{together}} in the past. They also find that Fiore's wife Anita keeps a collection of origami animals made by her first husband—Charlie Morris. Anita tells the agents that Fiore hasn't returned home from the previous night; meanwhile, the agents find that pages <b>are</b> <b>missing</b> from the file on Morris' murder, and Fiore {{was the last one}} to have checked the file out.|$|E
5|$|Of all ongoing BBC series {{from the}} 1960s, only Steptoe and Son {{has a better}} {{survival}} record, with all episodes existing in some form. Doctor Who is also comparatively rare amongst contemporaries in that all of its 1970s episodes exist as masters or telerecordings, while other series such as Z-Cars and Dixon of Dock Green <b>are</b> <b>missing</b> episodes from as late as 1975.|$|E
5|$|Paralympic {{cross-country}} ski {{competition is}} {{an adaptation of}} cross-country skiing for athletes with disabilities. Paralympic cross-country skiing includes standing events, sitting events (for wheelchair users), and events for visually impaired athletes under {{the rules of the}} International Paralympic Committee. These are divided into several categories for people who <b>are</b> <b>missing</b> limbs, have amputations, are blind, or have any other physical disability, to continue their sport.|$|E

50|$|Enkidu's {{interpretation}} <b>is</b> <b>missing</b> here, but as {{with the}} other dreams, it is assumed he puts a positive spin on the volcanic dream. The fourth dream <b>is</b> <b>missing,</b> but Enkidu again tells Gilgamesh that the dream portends success in the upcoming battle. The fifth dream <b>is</b> also <b>missing.</b>|$|R
50|$|Because one wooden pillow <b>was</b> <b>missing,</b> the {{carpenter}} blamed himself for being careless and insincere. Then, the child returned the wooden pillow he had hidden, but {{the carpenter}} didn’t use {{it because he}} thought it was contaminated. He completed the construction of the building even though one pillow <b>was</b> <b>missing.</b> That’s why even now the Main Buddha Hall <b>is</b> <b>missing</b> one wooden piece among its brackets.|$|R
5|$|Some {{overseas}} viewing {{prints were}} physically edited for content by local censor boards, before transmission for reasons such as excessive violence, fright-inducing material, and, in some cases, the conservative personal {{views of the}} censors. Hence, episodes recovered from these sources (Australia, New Zealand) <b>are</b> <b>missing</b> these segments.|$|E
5|$|The {{contemporary}} rhetorician Libanius delivered Julian's funeral oration in 363, whose text survives. This {{contains some}} {{details about the}} battle which <b>are</b> <b>missing</b> in Ammianus, which he presumably learnt from members of Julian's entourage. But because his oration {{was intended as a}} eulogy, not a historical narrative, his account of Julian's campaign is unreliable, and Ammianus' version is to be preferred where there is a contradiction.|$|E
5|$|The opisthosoma {{consists}} of twelve or fewer segments that originally formed two groups, a mesosoma of seven segments and a metasoma of five, terminating with a telson or spike.

5|$|The work is unfinished; {{a number}} of details, most noticeably the pope's right hand, <b>are</b> <b>missing.</b> Other {{passages}} are bland and uniform, with some key areas still blocked by the underdrawing. Many of Titian's characteristic finishing touches are missing; Paul's fur-lined sleeves do not contain the polishing white strokes of the 1543 portrait, or his usual final overglaze or glossing.|$|E
5|$|There are spiders with {{a reduced}} number of eyes, of these those with six-eyes {{are the most}} {{numerous}} and <b>are</b> <b>missing</b> a pair of eyes on the anterior median line, others species have four-eyes and some just two.

5|$|While large {{portions}} of the Old Testament <b>are</b> <b>missing,</b> {{it is assumed that}} the codex originally contained the whole of both Testaments.

5|$|A {{few days}} {{after the end of the}} Battle of Vukovar, there were 2,000 detainees in the camp. Detainees usually spent several days in the camp, during which some of them were interrogated, beaten and killed. Up to 10,000 detainees passed through the camp before it was closed in March 1992, when the United Nations Protection Force {{deployed}} to the area. Anywhere between 15 and 800 inmates may have been killed at the camp, though the latter figure includes approximately 700 people who <b>are</b> <b>missing</b> and presumed dead. The events in the camp formed part of three indictments issued by the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia. , two of the trials are ongoing, while the trial of Slobodan Milošević was terminated following his death.|$|E
