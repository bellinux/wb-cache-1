40|$|The {{purpose of}} this article is to {{investigate}} the relationship between <b>organizational</b> <b>and</b> professional commitment of project workers. We first present (1) role-conflict theory and exchange theory to establish the multiple dimensions of commitment (affective, continuance, and normative) and (2) social identity theory to support our argument for different foci of commitment—organization and profession. Building on these theoretical lenses, we present the literature review that compares <b>organizational</b> <b>and</b> professional commitment of project workers with respect to the three dimensions of commitment. Adopting a positivist approach and a sample of 141 project workers, we use Pearson’s correlation to identify the relationship between affective <b>organizational</b> <b>and</b> affective professional, continuance <b>organizational</b> <b>and</b> continuance professional, <b>and</b> normative <b>organizational</b> <b>and</b> normative professional commitment. We report significant correlation between affective <b>organizational</b> commitment <b>and</b> affective professional commitment of project workers. The correlations between continuance <b>organizational</b> commitment <b>and</b> continuance professional commitment <b>and</b> normative <b>organizational</b> commitment <b>and</b> normative professional commitment are moderate.
