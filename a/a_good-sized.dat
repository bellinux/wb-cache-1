25|$|The {{desirability}} of hiring directors over 60 is fairly diminished in this marketplace. At the same time, I hadn't had <b>a</b> <b>good-sized</b> hit {{in quite a}} while. And, frankly, I went {{through a couple of}} experiences that left me pretty disgusted with it all, and I was thinking the time had passed. I was just sitting at home reading magazines and looking out the window — a couple of projects I had had just fallen apart — when I got a call from Sly, who had sent me a script.|$|E
25|$|<b>A</b> <b>good-sized</b> mining camp {{developed}} at the site, which included a blacksmith shop, butcher shop, electric lighting, and at least 150 homes. There were four mining shafts, and a period photo of Shaft #1 shows a large enclosed headframe (shafthouse) tram and {{what appears to be}} a reduction works of some kind (smokestack and large building). It is said the mine produced about 100 tons of pyrite a day, and the iron sulfide was used to produce sulfuric acid, a commercially important chemical. Charlemont claims to be the first electrified town in Massachusetts, so it is possible that power was then run to the mining camp. The miners are said to have earned $12–15 per day (that claim has not been verified), which in those days was excellent pay.|$|E
25|$|Glaum {{began her}} acting career in stock stage productions. She {{was in the}} cast of Crucifixus, a Passion play, which opened on November 12, 1907, at the , 1044 South Hope Street, in Los Angeles, before <b>a</b> <b>good-sized</b> audience. In early June 1908, she {{appeared}} in the Owen Davis play How Baxter Butted In, a melodramatic comedy, at the Los Angeles Theatre on Spring Street. The cast included Lulu Warrenton {{and a number of}} others. Glaum then toured as an ingenue with a road show in Why Girls Leave Home. She earned $25 a week and furnished her own gowns, which she made herself. After reaching Chicago, she played ingenues in the Imperial Stock Company there {{for a year and a}} half, appearing in The Lion and the Mouse and The Squaw Man, among other plays. While performing in a summer stock engagement in Toledo, she created the ingenue role in Officer 666. Its playwright, Augustin MacHugh, her theatre director in Toledo, tried it out there before Broadway ever saw the successful farce.|$|E

One is on Shingle Cabin Brook as it enters Kitchen Creek just south of Waters Meet; the other, Kitchen Creek Falls, is {{directly}} below the PA 118 highway bridge, which obscures much of the view. There are also several unnamed falls in the park, such as <b>a</b> <b>good-sized</b> unnamed waterfall on {{a tributary of the}} Ganoga Glen branch of Kitchen Creek, or the [...] "forgotten falls" [...] on the South Branch Bowman Creek.|$|E
500|$|Among {{a flurry}} of revivals after 1945 was Paul Hindemith's edition, a full period {{reconstruction}} of the work prepared in 1943, which was staged and recorded at the Vienna Festival in 1954. This performance had {{a great impact on}} the young Nikolaus Harnoncourt, and was hailed as a masterpiece of scholarship and integrity. The first staged New York performance, by the New York City Opera under Leopold Stokowski on 29 September 1960, saw the American operatic debut of Gérard Souzay, one of several baritones who have sung the role of Orfeo. The theatre was criticised by New York Times critic Harold C. Schonberg because, to accommodate a performance of Luigi Dallapiccola's contemporary opera Il prigioniero, about a third of L'Orfeo was cut. Schonberg wrote: [...] "Even the biggest aria in the opera, [...] "Possente spirito", has <b>a</b> <b>good-sized</b> slash in the middle ... is long enough, and important enough, not to mention beautiful enough, to have been the entire evening's opera." ...|$|E

2500|$|A {{visitor to}} Maude in early 1879 {{described}} [...] "the little township of Maude" [...] as situated [...] "on the river bank", consisting of [...] "four habitations, among {{which are a}} hotel and store, both kept by Mr. [...] Murphy, and a police station, where a solitary trooper dreams his life away, praying, doubtless, for the Kellys to come and end his dreary lot". [...] He added that [...] "there is a punt crossing the river here, and <b>a</b> <b>good-sized</b> wool store, both {{in the hands of}} the almost solitary resident of the city, D. Murphy". [...] The writer pointed out [...] "that considerable traffic occurs through this place across the river, but great inconvenience is experienced after any heavy rains, owing to the billabong by which the township is surrounded becoming too deep to cross".|$|E
2500|$|William Comstock {{stayed in}} the home valley of the Spade Ranch headquarters, which is {{approximately}} [...] north of Ellsworth. Comstock had a sod house at the headquarters, another soddie as a ranch office, <b>a</b> <b>good-sized</b> bunkhouse, the log cookhouse (the log building moved from the Newman Ranch), a barn, feed yards, large corrals for working with cattle, breaking horses, branding, and dipping cattle, a blacksmith shop, a machine shop and the ranch store. The ranch store featured staple groceries, clothing, supplies, {{and a place to}} pick up mail carried from the Ellsworth post office. Later Comstock built a large frame house in the center of Spade operations. One additional house was built as a home for Spade foreman, Mike Peterson. Peterson worked for the Spade for several years, but rather than work for a wage, he received both land and stock.|$|E
2500|$|Welch {{suggests}} that some paintings were made in Qazvin by older artists, such as Aqa Mirak and Muzaffar Ali, who remained there and sent to Mashhad., but the account by another of the prince's calligraphers, Qazi Ahmad, though admittedly full of extravagant praise, {{makes it clear that}} Ibrahim Mirza took <b>a</b> <b>good-sized</b> contingent of artists and craftsmen with him to his posts, and spent much time among them. [...] Other artists working on the manuscript have been given the titles of painters A and D, from their work on earlier manuscripts for Tahmasp. Ibrahim Mirza may also have commissioned manuscripts in Qazvin in the 1570s, the best period of production there. [...] The miniatures in the book are crowded with figures, and in the example opposite textiles, too much so for many critics,. [...] It appears Ibrahim Mirza identified himself with Yusuf (Joseph) and the images of him are probably intended as portraits. [...] The manuscript has been described as [...] "the last truly great one produced under the Safavid dynasty".|$|E

60|$|To {{see such}} a glowing, {{sparkling}} apparition as this come sailing out of {{the depths of the}} dark forest, was grand! Rectus said he felt like bursting into poetry; but he didn't. He wasn't much on rhymes. He had opportunity enough, though, to get up <b>a</b> pretty <b>good-sized</b> poem, for we were kept awake a long time after we went to bed by the boughs of the trees on shore scratching and tapping against the outside of our state-room.|$|R
60|$|Fifteen yards {{further back}} the ground rose {{abruptly}} to {{a height of}} thirty or forty feet; the ground around was covered with bushes, through which <b>a</b> few <b>good-sized</b> trees rose. The two men had dug through two feet of alluvial soil, and about five feet of sand. Altogether, {{it was a place}} which seemed to afford no promise whatever; and although, at the first impulse, some miners who were doing badly had marked out claims next to those staked out by Frank and his party, no steps were taken to occupy them.|$|R

On the way we passed a seal-net belonging to {{the owner of the}} boat, and at our request he visited it, and found seven or eight fine seals in it: they were all dead, and full of water. Seal-nets are made the same as salmon-nets, except that the mesh is larger, the seal having <b>a</b> pretty <b>good-sized</b> cranium of his own. After a good deal of unravelling and pulling, we got them all out of the net, and proceeded onward with our cargo.|$|R

So long as the people that own the barns and fences don't object, I don't see what the public has got to do with it.

I wish {{some of the people that}} talk about the landscape, and WRITE about it, had to bu'st one of them rocks OUT of the landscape with powder, or dig a hole to bury it in, as we used to have to do up on the farm; I guess they'd sing a little different tune about the profanation of scenery.
