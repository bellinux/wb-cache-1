5|$|Amino acids {{are made}} into {{proteins}} by being joined {{together in a}} chain of peptide bonds. Each different protein has a unique sequence of amino acid residues: this is its primary structure. Just as {{the letters of the}} alphabet can be combined to form an almost endless variety of words, amino acids can be linked in varying sequences to form a huge variety of proteins. Proteins are made from amino acids that have been activated by attachment to a transfer RNA molecule through an ester bond. This aminoacyl-tRNA precursor is produced in an ATP-dependent reaction carried out by an <b>aminoacyl</b> <b>tRNA</b> <b>synthetase.</b> This aminoacyl-tRNA is then a substrate for the ribosome, which joins the amino acid onto the elongating protein chain, using the sequence information in a messenger RNA.|$|E
5|$|As {{both the}} amine and {{carboxylic}} acid groups of amino acids can {{react to form}} amide bonds, one amino acid molecule can react with another and become joined through an amide linkage. This polymerization of amino acids is what creates proteins. This condensation reaction yields the newly formed peptide bond and a molecule of water. In cells, this reaction does not occur directly; instead, the amino acid is first activated by attachment to a transfer RNA molecule through an ester bond. This aminoacyl-tRNA is produced in an ATP-dependent reaction carried out by an <b>aminoacyl</b> <b>tRNA</b> <b>synthetase.</b> This aminoacyl-tRNA is then a substrate for the ribosome, which catalyzes the attack of the amino group of the elongating protein chain on the ester bond. As {{a result of this}} mechanism, all proteins made by ribosomes are synthesized starting at their N-terminus and moving toward their C-terminus.|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Leishmania major, a {{protozoan}} parasite, is the causative {{agent of}} cutaneous leishmaniasis. Due {{to the development}} of resistance against the currently available anti-leishmanial drugs, there is a growing need for specific inhibitors and novel drug targets. In this regards, <b>aminoacyl</b> <b>tRNA</b> <b>synthetases,</b> the linchpins of protein synthesis, have received recent attention among the kinetoplastid research community. This is the first comprehensive survey of the <b>aminoacyl</b> <b>tRNA</b> <b>synthetases,</b> their paralogs and other associated proteins from L. major. Results A total of 26 <b>aminoacyl</b> <b>tRNA</b> <b>synthetases</b> were identified using various computational and bioinformatics tools. Phylogenetic analysis and domain architectures of the L. major <b>aminoacyl</b> <b>tRNA</b> <b>synthetases</b> suggest a probable archaeal/eukaryotic origin. Presence of additional domains or N- or C-terminal extensions in 11 <b>aminoacyl</b> <b>tRNA</b> <b>synthetases</b> from L. major suggests possibilities such as additional tRNA binding or oligomerization or editing activity. Five freestanding editing domains were identified in L. major. Domain assignment revealed a novel asparagine <b>tRNA</b> <b>synthetase</b> paralog, asparagine synthetase A which has been so far reported from prokaryotes and archaea. Conclusions A comprehensive bioinformatic analysis revealed 26 <b>aminoacyl</b> <b>tRNA</b> <b>synthetases</b> and five freestanding editing domains in L. major. Identification of two EMAP (endothelial monocyte-activating polypeptide) II-like proteins similar to human EMAP II-like proteins suggests their participation in multisynthetase complex formation. While the phylogeny of <b>tRNA</b> <b>synthetases</b> suggests a probable archaeal/eukaryotic origin, phylogeny of asparagine synthetase A strongly suggests a bacterial origin. The unique features identified in this work provide rationale for designing inhibitors against parasite <b>aminoacyl</b> <b>tRNA</b> <b>synthetases</b> and their paralogs. </p...|$|R

25|$|An <b>aminoacyl</b> <b>tRNA</b> <b>synthetase</b> (aaRS) is {{an enzyme}} that {{attaches}} the appropriate amino acid onto its tRNA. It does so by catalyzing the esterification {{of a specific}} cognate amino acid or its precursor to one of all its compatible cognate tRNAs to form an aminoacyl-tRNA. In humans, the 21 different types of aa-tRNA are made by the 21 different aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases, one for each amino acid of the genetic code.|$|E
500|$|The {{process of}} synthesizing a protein from an mRNA {{template}} {{is known as}} translation. The mRNA is loaded onto the ribosome and is read three nucleotides at a time by matching each codon to its base pairing anticodon located on a transfer RNA molecule, which carries the amino acid corresponding to the codon it recognizes. The enzyme <b>aminoacyl</b> <b>tRNA</b> <b>synthetase</b> [...] "charges" [...] the tRNA molecules with the correct amino acids. The growing polypeptide is often termed the nascent chain. Proteins are always biosynthesized from N-terminus to C-terminus.|$|E
500|$|The chief {{characteristic}} of proteins that also allows their diverse {{set of functions}} is their ability to bind other molecules specifically and tightly. The region of the protein responsible for binding another molecule {{is known as the}} binding site and is often a depression or [...] "pocket" [...] on the molecular surface. This binding ability is mediated by the tertiary structure of the protein, which defines the binding site pocket, and by the chemical properties of the surrounding amino acids' side chains. Protein binding can be extraordinarily tight and specific; for example, the ribonuclease inhibitor protein binds to human angiogenin with a sub-femtomolar dissociation constant (<10−15 M) but does not bind at all to its amphibian homolog onconase (>1 M). Extremely minor chemical changes such as the addition of a single methyl group to a binding partner can sometimes suffice to nearly eliminate binding; for example, the <b>aminoacyl</b> <b>tRNA</b> <b>synthetase</b> specific to the amino acid valine discriminates against the very similar side chain of the amino acid isoleucine.|$|E

The reactions are catalyzed by an ancient group of 20 enzymes (one for each amino acid) known as <b>aminoacyl</b> <b>tRNA</b> <b>synthetases</b> (AARSs). Surprisingly, the etiology of specific diseases—including cancer, neuronal pathologies, autoimmune disorders, and disrupted metabolic conditions—is connected to specific <b>aminoacyl</b> <b>tRNA</b> <b>synthetases.</b> These connections include heritable mutations in the genes for <b>tRNA</b> <b>synthetases</b> that are causally linked to disease, with both dominant and recessive disease-causing mutations being annotated. Because some disease-causing mutations do not affect aminoacylation activity or apparent enzyme stability, the mutations are believed to affect functions that are distinct from aminoacylation. Examples include enzymes that are secreted as procytokines that, after activation, operate in pathways connected to the immune system or angiogenesis. In addition, within cells, synthetases form multiprotein complexes with each other or with other regulatory factors and in that way control diverse signaling pathways.

5000|$|Charging tRNAs {{with their}} {{respective}} amino-acids - the enzyme that charges the tRNA is called <b>aminoacyl</b> <b>tRNA</b> <b>synthetase.</b> This enzyme utilizes a high energy intermediate state {{to increase the}} fidelity of binding the right pair of tRNA and amino-acid.

5000|$|Aside {{from the}} obvious {{necessity}} of wobble, that our bodies {{have a limited}} amount of tRNAs and wobble allows for broad specificity, wobble base pairs have been shown to facilitate many biological functions, most clearly proven in the bacterium Escherichia coli. In fact, in a study of E. colis tRNA for alanine there is a wobble base pair that determines whether the tRNA will be aminoacylated. When a tRNA reaches an <b>aminoacyl</b> <b>tRNA</b> <b>synthetase,</b> the job of the synthetase is to join the t-shaped RNA with its amino acid. These aminoacylated tRNA's go on to the translation of an mRNA transcript, and are the fundamental elements that connect to the codon of the amino acid. The necessity of the wobble base pair is illustrated through experimentation where the Guanine- Uracil pairing is changed to its natural Guanine- Cytosine pairing. Oligoboronucleotides were synthesized on a Gene Assembler Plus, and then spread across a DNA sequence known to code a tRNA for Alanine, 2D-NMR's are then run on the products of these new tRNA's and compared to the wobble tRNA's. The results indicate that with that wobble base pair changed, structure is also changed and an alpha helix can no longer be formed. The alpha helix was the recognizable structure for the <b>aminoacyl</b> <b>tRNA</b> <b>synthetase</b> and thus the synthetase does not connect the amino acid Alanine with the tRNA for Alanine. This wobble base pairing is essential {{for the use of the}} amino acid Alanine in E. Coli and its significance here would imply significance in many related species.
