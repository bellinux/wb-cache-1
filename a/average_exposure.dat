30|$|The {{finding that}} the opinionated {{neighborhood}} size generally has an inhibitory effect on the likelihood of expressing any opinionated sentiment (Figure  2 A-D) is difficult to interpret {{in the context of}} a standard contagion framework, because contagion is normally associated with spread, rather than inhibition. For example, it makes intuitive sense that a larger number of negative followees should lead to a reduction in the expression of positive sentiments. The finding that it also leads to a reduction in the expression of negative sentiments is harder to interpret, but nevertheless agrees with the general pattern of inhibition. When looking at the <b>average</b> opinionated <b>exposure</b> intensity (Figure  2 E-H), a different picture emerges. The results are rather sensitive to misclassification of the messages, but the most stable result (64 % of all network realizations, Figure  2 E) is that increased <b>average</b> negative <b>exposure</b> intensity does predict increased negative sentiment expression, in line with the expectation of social contagion. Surprisingly, the second most stable result (44.5 % of all network realizations, Figure  2 G) is that the <b>average</b> positive <b>exposure</b> intensity does also predict increased negative sentiment expression. Equally surprisingly, the third most stable result (33.5 % of network realizations, Figure  2 H) is that higher <b>average</b> positive <b>exposure</b> intensity predicts decreased positive sentiment expression. Taken together, the results suggest that exposure to negative sentiment is contagious - by which we merely mean predictive of future negative sentiment expression - while exposure to positive sentiments is generally not. They also suggest that exposure to increased intensity of opinionated sentiments has on balance led to increased negative sentiment expression and decreased positive sentiment expression, overall favoring the spread of negative vaccination sentiments.|$|R

5000|$|The {{regulations}} {{introduced a}} number of exposure limits in relation to noise in the workplace.

40|$|Objectives: To assess {{potential}} infant {{exposure to}} bupropion and its active metabolites in breast milk such as would occur during treatment to prevent post-partum relapse to tobacco use, and {{to compare the}} concentrations of bupropion in urine and saliva with plasma and breast milk. Design and setting: Cohort study, outpatient clinical research centre. Subjects: Ten healthy post-partum volunteers who agreed to take bupropion for seven days, pump and discard their breast milk, and have samples of breast milk, plasma, saliva, and urine analysed. Intervention: Bupropion 150 mg a day {{for three days and}} then 300 mg a day for four days. Main outcome measures: Concentrations of bupropion and its active metabolites (hydroxybupropion, erythrohydrobupropion, threohydrobupropion) in breast milk, plasma, saliva, and urine. Determination of <b>average</b> infant <b>exposure.</b> Results: The calculated average dosage of bupropion in breast milk was 6. 75 mg/kg/day.
