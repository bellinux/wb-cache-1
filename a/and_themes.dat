5|$|The {{game was}} created to not have direct {{connections}} to the first Shin Megami Tensei, {{to ensure that it}} was interesting independently; this led character designer Kazuma Kaneko to create the concept of a story vaguely based on Shin Megami Tensei future.

5|$|Although the prequel/sequel to Superstar Saga, the game's plot is {{completely}} unrelated {{to that of}} its predecessor with more emphasis on the time-traveling theme, which involves the protagonists traveling in between {{the past and present}} of the Mushroom Kingdom.

The gameplay centers on the co-operation between the quartet, who must use their specific qualities and skills to solve puzzles to progress through and features multiple role-playing game elements, but with a turn-based battle system focused on timing accuracy. The game is considerably darker in tone than its predecessor, especially in its plot <b>and</b> <b>themes.</b>|$|E
5|$|Brushstrokes {{series is}} the name {{for a series of}} {{paintings}} produced in 196566 by Roy Lichtenstein. It also refers to derivative sculptural representations of these paintings that were first made in the 1980s. In the series, the theme is art as a subject, but rather than reproduce masterpieces as he had starting in 1962, Lichtenstein depicted the gestural expressions of the painting brushstroke itself. The works in this series are linked to those produced by artists who use the gestural painting style of abstract expressionism made famous by Jackson Pollock, but differ from them due to their mechanically produced appearance. The series is considered a satire or parody of gestural painting by both Lichtenstein and his critics. After 1966, Lichtenstein incorporated this series into later motifs <b>and</b> <b>themes</b> of his work.|$|E
