5|$|At the university, Holmboe again met Christopher Hansteen, who {{had become}} a {{professor}} there in 1816. In 1835, Hansteen published his own mathematics textbook for secondary schools. A reaction to Holmboe's books and method of teaching, it was more practically oriented. Holmboe wrote <b>a</b> <b>review</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> book for the newspaper Morgenbladet, in which he advised schools not to use it. A public debate followed, with contributions from other mathematicians. It has been claimed {{that this was the}} first debate on the subject of school textbooks in Norway. Hansteen's textbook was not reprinted.|$|E

Competition would favor the wolf, which is known to kill dogs, however wolves tend to live in pairs or in small packs in areas where they are highly persecuted, giving them a disadvantage facing large groups of dogs.|$|E

The report recommended improvements to some of the banks, but funding for the work was not available, and so no work was done at the time.|$|E
