5|$|In recent years, {{this latter}} {{argument}} has been fortified by {{the theory of}} connectionism. Many connectionist models of the brain have been developed in which the processes of language learning {{and other forms of}} representation are highly distributed and parallel.

50|$|The first dialogue, titled, “Philo and Sophia on Love and Desire” is a contemplation on {{the distinctions}} between love <b>and</b> <b>desire,</b> or the types of love and {{the true nature of}} love. In Sophia’s opinion, love <b>and</b> <b>desire</b> are exclusive; however, Philo argues that love <b>and</b> <b>desire</b> mix in things we find pleasurable, <b>and</b> that <b>desire</b> assumes {{knowledge}} of its object and, thus, its existence. Philo defines desire as that which seeks to become united with its object and love as that which, in union with its object, is enjoyed. When love <b>and</b> <b>desire</b> intersect, there are three different qualities of objects: useful, pleasant and good. Useful objects are not loved <b>and</b> <b>desired</b> together. Useful objects are those that are possessed. Meanwhile, love <b>and</b> <b>desire</b> of pleasant objects grows and perishes at the same time; pleasant objects exist because of privation. Good objects, on the other hand, exist when love <b>and</b> <b>desire</b> have no limit.|$|R

5|$|Considering mental {{states as}} three-place {{relations}} in this way, representative realism {{makes it possible}} to hold together all of the elements necessary to the solution of this problem. Further, mental representations are not only the objects of beliefs <b>and</b> <b>desires,</b> but are also the domain over which mental processes operate. They can be considered the ideal link between the syntactic notion of mental content and the computational notion of functional architecture. These notions are, according to Fodor, our best explanation of mental processes.|$|E
40|$|This {{thesis is}} an {{investigation}} of smara. Smara is a Sanskrit word and means memory <b>and</b> <b>desire.</b> It has no equivalent in the English language and so the attempt to understand smara becomes both a linguistic and an ontological task. The reader is introduced to the similarities and idiosyncrasies between Western and Indian notions of memory <b>and</b> <b>desire</b> <b>and</b> then invited into {{the search for the}} junction between memory <b>and</b> <b>desire</b> in Indian thought. Analysis of anthropological and philosophical texts as well as a semantic mapping of Kalidasa's masterpiece entitled Sakuntala: The Ring of Recollection, reveals not only the co-existence of memory <b>and</b> <b>desire</b> in smara but also the notion of smara as a process...|$|R
40|$|Introduction. Sexual arousal <b>and</b> <b>desire</b> are {{integral}} {{parts of the}} human sexual response that reflect physiological, emotional, and cognitive processes. Although subjective and physiological aspects of arousal <b>and</b> <b>desire</b> tend to be experienced concurrently, their differences become apparent in certain experimental and clinical populations in which {{one or more of}} these aspects are impaired. There are few subjective scales that assess sexual arousal <b>and</b> <b>desire</b> specifically in both men and women...|$|R

5|$|Fodor {{argues that}} mental states, such as beliefs <b>and</b> <b>desires,</b> are {{relations}} between individuals and mental representations. He maintains that these representations {{can only be}} correctly {{explained in terms of}} a language of thought (LOT) in the mind. Furthermore, this language of thought itself is an actually existing thing that is codified in the brain and not just a useful explanatory tool. Fodor adheres to a species of functionalism, maintaining that thinking and other mental processes consist primarily of computations operating on the syntax of the representations that make up the language of thought.|$|E
5|$|In the United States, unbearably {{inadequate}} {{housing and}} overcrowded neighborhoods pushed working {{men out of}} the home and into saloons where they congregated for drink and discussion.

George Pullman and William Halliday implemented a policy of tolerance in their towns identical to that of Robert Owen.

40|$|Pleasure <b>and</b> <b>desire</b> {{have been}} {{important}} components of the vision for sexuality education for over 20 years. This book argues {{that there has been}} a lack of scrutiny over the political motivations that underpin research supportive of pleasure <b>and</b> <b>desire</b> within comprehensive sexuality education. In this volume, key researchers in the field consider how discourses related to pleasure <b>and</b> <b>desire</b> have been taken up internationally. They argue that sexuality education is clearly shaped by specific cultural and political contexts, and examine how these contexts have shaped the development of pleasure’s inclusion in such programs. Via such discussions, this volume incites a re-configuration of thought regarding sexuality education’s approach to pleasure <b>and</b> <b>desire...</b>|$|R

As with most other ancient Chinese philosophers, Laozi often explains his ideas by way of paradox, analogy, appropriation of ancient sayings, repetition, symmetry, rhyme, and rhythm. In fact, the whole book can be read as an analogy – the ruler is the awareness, or self, in meditation and the myriad creatures or empire is the experience of the body, senses <b>and</b> <b>desires.</b>|$|E

In the Abdhidharmic analysis of mind, the ordinary thought is defined as prapañca ('conceptual proliferation'). According to this theory, perceptual experience is bound up in multiple conceptualizations (expectations, judgments <b>and</b> <b>desires).</b> This proliferation of conceptualizations form our illusory superimposition of concepts like self and other upon an ever changing stream of aggregate phenomena.|$|E

40|$|The {{psychological}} {{experience of}} the sexual response cycle has, in recent years, been theoretically redefined {{to take into account}} the multidimensional nature of its different stages and the important biopsychosocial factors that influence them. The first chapter of this thesis advocates a four-dimensional model to describe the subjective experience of sexual arousal <b>and</b> <b>desire</b> in both men and women, with three positive dimensions including an evaluative, a motivational, and a physiological factor, as well as a fourth aversive or inhibitive negative factor. An adjective-rating questionnaire, called the Sexual Arousal <b>and</b> <b>Desire</b> Inventory (SADI), was developed to evaluate this multidimensional model of sexual arousal <b>and</b> <b>desire.</b> A sample of 195 women and 195 men completed the questionnaire to convey their subjective experiences of sexual arousal <b>and</b> <b>desire.</b> Results supported the four-factor model to describe men and women's experiences of sexual arousal <b>and</b> <b>desire,</b> suggesting they involve similar experiences. Further inquiry into the questionnaire's psychometric properties as a measure of subjective sexual arousal <b>and</b> <b>desire</b> <b>and</b> of the four-dimensional model revealed excellent reliability and validity, and is covered in chapter one as well. Chapter two examines whether the presence or absence of specific sexual cues, including the ejaculation ending and the soundtrack of an erotic film segment, would alter the subjective experience of sexual arousal <b>and</b> <b>desire</b> of men <b>and</b> women. The third and final chapter of this thesis introduces a Quebec French translation of the SADI. In a preliminary study, 310 women and 59 men completed the questionnaire. Results supported the four-factor model in this French version of the SADI and suggested that this model is adequate to describe the subjective experience of sexual arousal <b>and</b> <b>desire</b> of Quebec Francophone populations. A more equal sample of men and women will need to be evaluated in order to confirm the validity of these results in both sexes...|$|R

5|$|As with A Wizard of Earthsea, The Tombs of Atuan is a bildungsroman or coming-of-age story, {{this time}} from the {{perspective}} of a female character, Tenar. Though she nominally has a position of high authority, Tenar feels trapped by her duties as priestess, <b>and</b> <b>desires</b> to escape to a place where she can make her own choices. In contrast to Ged, whose journey was chiefly a private quest, Tenar's choices have direct social consequences. While Ged's growth is traced through the various adventures he experiences in the first volume of the series, Tenar's development is shown through her exploration of her own domain. The labyrinth, in particular, with its twists and turns, is a metaphor for Tenar's exploration of her own thoughts. In this reading of the novel, the labyrinth symbolizes the imprisonment of the women, and the darkness and unacknowledged thoughts within Tenar, which she begins to struggle through after feeling guilt over killing the prisoners sent to her.|$|E

The discussion escalates into a fight, during which Megan makes a hurtful remark about Don's mother, and Don storms out and drives off without her. Don returns sometime later and begins to worry when he can't find Megan. He spends hours looking for and waiting for her, calling Peggy (the other side of the conversation from the first part of the episode) as well as Megan's mother in Montreal.|$|E
5|$|Adapted from The Old Curiosity Shop by Charles Dickens, {{the film}} has been {{shortened}} and streamlined for the single reel format. The film focuses on a grandfather who gambles himself into poverty. He dotes on his granddaughter, Little Nell, <b>and</b> <b>desires</b> to give her every luxury. The grandfather turns to gambling to try and earn money, firmly believing that luck would favor him. His gambling results in losing everything and Nell fears {{that he will be}} taken away to an asylum. At night, Nell flees with him and they find refuge and shelter with Mrs. Jarley. The grandfather, seeking to win money, robs Nell of her money and proceeds to gamble it away. The grandfather is coerced by men to steal to pay the debts, but Nell intervenes and flees with her grandfather again. Exhausted and feeble in health, Nell meets a kind schoolmaster and appeals to him for aid before falling unconscious at his feet. The schoolmaster takes the two in, but it is too late to save Nell and she dies. Her grandfather is brokenhearted and is found dead on her grave several days later.|$|E

5|$|During the 1970s, South Korea's film {{industry}} {{was at a}} low point due to government censorship and underfunding. Because of the poor state of the local {{film industry}}, cinema attendance in South Korea had dropped drastically since its high-point in the 1960s. Kim Ki-young, however, working independently in B-movie-like genre films, began to produce {{some of his most}} innovative and personal works at this time. Kim fully regained his auteurist spirit with Woman of Fire (1971), the second of his Housemaid trilogy. The use of color, particularly reds and blues to express the anxiety <b>and</b> <b>desires</b> of the film's characters, distinguished this film from the original Housemaids dark, shadowy black-and-white photography. For this film, Kim was named Best Director at the Blue Dragon Film Awards and actress Youn Yuh-jung was given Special Mention for Best Actress at the Festival de Cine de Sitges. Not only popular with the critics, Kim's independently produced films were box-office successes during this era in which most films were harmed through heavy governmental interference. In 1972 Kim's Insect Woman was the only film to sell more than 100,000 tickets in Seoul and won Kim the Best Director prize at the Baeksang Arts Awards in 1973.|$|E
5|$|During the {{formative}} years of women's rights movements, {{the difference between}} the sexes was more or less taken for granted in that their roles, functions, aims <b>and</b> <b>desires</b> were different. As a result, they were not only to be reared differently but treated differently also. Over the course of time, this difference itself became a major reason for initiating women's movements. Early 19th century reformers argued that the difference between men and women was no reason for the subjection of women in society. However, later reformers were of the opinion that indeed it was this particular difference that subjugated women to their roles in society, for example, as mothers. Therefore, there was a need for the proper care of women's rights. With the formation of women's organisations and their own participation in campaigns, their roles as mothers was again stressed but in a different light: this time the argument was for women's rights to speech, education and emancipation. However, the image of women with the mother as a symbol underwent changes over time – from an emphasis on family to the creation of an archetypal mother figure, evoking deep, often atavistic images.|$|E
5|$|Lockheed Martin, Thales, STN Atlas, and Raytheon were {{approached}} to provide tenders {{to design and}} assemble a new combat system for the submarines, with all four submitting proposals during early 2000. In May 2000, after the Defence Science and Technology Organisation tested operational versions of the proposed combat software packages, the Lockheed and Thales tenders were eliminated, despite the Thales proposal being rated better than Raytheon's. After indepth testing of the remaining systems and observations of the systems in action, the German STN Atlas ISUS 90-55 aboard an Israeli Dolphin-class submarine and the American Raytheon CCS Mk2 aboard a USN Los Angeles-class submarine, {{it was decided that}} the STN Atlas system was the best for the class. However, political pressure from both the United States and Australia, questions about the security problems and possible leaks involved with a European combat system linked to American weapons, <b>and</b> <b>desires</b> to increase the political and military ties between Australia and the United States resulted in the cancellation of the tender program in July 2001 and the decision to enter a joint development program with the United States, with a formal agreement signed on 10 September 2001 at the Pentagon.|$|E
