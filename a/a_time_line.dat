2500|$|After 1965, Brown's bandleader and {{arranger}} was Alfred [...] "Pee Wee" [...] Ellis. Ellis credits Clyde Stubblefield's {{adoption of}} New Orleans drumming techniques, {{as the basis}} of modern funk: [...] "If, in a studio, you said 'play it funky' that could imply almost anything. But 'give me a New Orleans beat' – you got exactly what you wanted. And Clyde Stubblefield was just the epitome of this funky drumming." [...] Stewart states that the popular feel was passed along from [...] "New Orleans—through James Brown's music, to the popular music of the 1970s." [...] Concerning the various funk motifs, Stewart states: [...] "This model, it should be noted, is different from <b>a</b> <b>time</b> <b>line</b> (such as clave and tresillo) in that it is not an exact pattern, but more of a loose organizing principle." ...|$|E

One might think that the purpose of such a classification is to expand the range of alcoholism and include as many people as possible under the [...] "disease concept"; but, contrary to what the title suggests, Jellinek's 1960 magnum opus in fact tries to limit the scope of the [...] "disease concept", stating that most of the types described might be alcoholics, but they are not diseased – because they do not suffer from [...] "loss of control".|$|E
2500|$|In the 1624 English Village {{section of}} the museum, first-person interpreters {{have been trained to}} speak, act, and dress {{appropriately}} for the period, whereas third-person (or modern) interpreters have been trained to answer inquiries that guests may have which those in character are unable to answer while in their respective roles.

In a related development, the underlying rhythms of American popular music underwent a basic, yet generally unacknowledged transition from triplet or shuffle feel to even or straight eighth notes.
