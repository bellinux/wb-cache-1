5|$|Coffin did {{not enjoy}} being {{in the public eye}} and {{considered}} his job soliciting financial aid as begging for money, which he thought to be demeaning. He stated in his autobiography that he gladly gave up the position once a new leader for the organization was selected. Coffin became concerned <b>about</b> <b>giving</b> money freely to all blacks, some of whom he was believed {{would never be able to}} care for themselves unless adequate education and farms were provided. He also believed the Society should give their limited resources only to those who were best able to benefit from them. The Society continued to operate until 1870, the same year that black men were guaranteed the right to vote under the Fifteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution.|$|E

The next day Truman {{met with the}} chairman of the United States Atomic Energy Commission, Gordon Dean, and arranged for the transfer of nine Mark 4 nuclear bombs to military control. Dean was apprehensive about delegating the decision on how they should be used to MacArthur, who lacked expert technical knowledge of the weapons and their effects. The Joint Chiefs were not entirely comfortable <b>about</b> <b>giving</b> them to MacArthur either, for fear that he might prematurely carry out his orders. Instead, they decided that the nuclear strike force would report to the Strategic Air Command.|$|E
5|$|The star is {{estimated}} to be less than a billion years old. Because of its relative youth, Epsilon Eridani has a higher level of magnetic activity than the present-day Sun, with a stellar wind 30 times as strong. Its rotation period is 11.2days at the equator. Epsilon Eridani is smaller and less massive than the Sun, and has a comparatively lower level of elements heavier than helium. It is a main-sequence star of spectral class K2, which means that energy generated at the core through nuclear fusion of hydrogen is emitted from the surface at a temperature of <b>about</b> , <b>giving</b> it an orange hue.|$|E

5|$|In early April 1951, the Joint Chiefs became {{alarmed by}} the build up of Soviet forces in the Far East, {{particularly}} bombers and submarines. On 5 April 1951, they drafted orders for MacArthur authorizing attacks on Manchuria and the Shantung Peninsula if the Chinese launched airstrikes against his forces originating from there. The next day Truman met with {{the chairman of the}} United States Atomic Energy Commission, Gordon Dean, and arranged for the transfer of nine Mark 4 nuclear bombs to military control.

The Joint Chiefs were not entirely comfortable <b>about</b> <b>giving</b> them to MacArthur either, for fear that he might prematurely carry out his orders. Instead, they decided that the nuclear strike force would report to the Strategic Air Command (SAC). This time the bombers deployed with the fissile cores. SAC did not intend to attack air bases and depots; the bombers would target industrial cities in North Korea and China. Deployments of SAC bombers to Guam continued {{until the end of the}} war.|$|E
5|$|Notably, {{during the}} 1960s, the Soviet General Secretary Nikita Khrushchev asked the {{communist}} leader of Albania Enver Hoxha <b>about</b> <b>giving</b> autonomy to the minority, but this initiative was without any result. The autonomy question {{remains one of}} the main issues on the diplomatic agenda in Albanian-Greek relations, {{after the collapse of the}} communist regime in Albania (1991). Moreover, a certain degree of autonomy, based on the terms of the Protocol of Corfu, is the main objective of the organization Omonoia, as well as the Unity for Human Rights Party, which represents the Greek minority in the Albanian government. Such proposals were rejected in 1991 by the Albanian government, thus spurring Omonoia's radical wing to call for Union with Greece. In another incident, in 1993, Omonoia’s chairman was immediately arrested by the Albanian police, after explaining in public that the goal of the Greek minority was autonomy inside the Albanian borders, based on the terms of the Protocol.|$|E
5|$|The {{autonomy}} {{question remains}} on the diplomatic agenda in Albanian-Greek relations {{as part of the}} Northern Epirote issue. In 1925, Albania's borders were fixed by the Protocol of Florence, and the Kingdom of Greece abandoned all claims to Northern Epirus. In the 1960s, Soviet General Secretary Nikita Khrushchev asked his Albanian counterpart <b>about</b> <b>giving</b> autonomy to the Greek minority, with no results. In 1991, {{after the collapse of the}} communist regime in Albania, the chairman of Greek minority organization Omonoia called for autonomy for Northern Epirus, on the basis that the rights provided for under the Albanian constitution were highly precarious. This proposal was rejected, spurring the minority's radical wing to call for a union with Greece. Two years later, Omonoia’s chairman was arrested by the Albanian police after publicly stating that the Greek minority goal was the creation of an autonomous region inside the Albanian borders, based on the provisions of the Protocol of Corfu. In 1997, Albanian analysts stated that the possibility of a Greek minority-inspired breakaway Republic still exists.|$|E

5|$|The {{whole town}} goes cold turkey {{and begins to}} suffer from intense sugar withdrawal. Homer joins a secret group led by Garth Motherloving and Mr. Burns to smuggle sugar from the island of San Glucos. After {{arriving}} back in Springfield, and evading a police boat, Homer brings the sugar to the docks. Marge pleads Homer to dump the cargo. There Homer is presented with two choices: to obey Marge and press the button Drop Cargo or bring the sugar to Garth Motherloving by pressing the button Obey Bad Guy. After contemplating, Homer drops the cargo and all the sugar falls to the Springfield docks' water. All Springfielders, even those who seemed happier and healthier without sugar, jump into the harbor and drink the sugar water. Judge Snyder then declares the ban over and dives in with everyone else. Marge is upset and she thinks <b>about</b> <b>giving</b> up changing the world. However, Homer tells her that he loves her when she tries to make a world a better place.|$|E

Stewart was enjoying Hollywood life and had no regrets <b>about</b> <b>giving</b> up the stage, as he worked {{six days a week}} in the MGM factory. In 1936, he acquired big-time agent Leland Hayward, who would eventually marry Sullavan.

The third time he auditioned, he earned a regular spot on the show. He spent seven years as a regular on Whose Line Is It Anyway? and remained a cast member until the show's end in 1998.|$|E
