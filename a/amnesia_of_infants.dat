40|$|Brief CommunicationInternational audienceThis study {{evaluated}} whether olfactory preconditioning is functional in newborn {{rabbits and}} based on joined or independent memory of odorants. First, after exposure to odorants A+B, the conditioning of A led to high responsiveness to odorant B. Second, responsiveness to B persisted after <b>amnesia</b> <b>of</b> A. Third, preconditioning was also functional with two overlapping pairs of odorants (A+B and B+C) and <b>amnesia</b> <b>of</b> one odorant did not affect memory of the others. Thus, incidental pairing of odorants allows reinforcement of one odorant to implicitly reinforce the others, the bond then vanishes, {{and the memory of}} each element becomes independent...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we examine the}} impact <b>of</b> <b>amnesia</b> and <b>of</b> levels of {{processing}} on implicit memory by using a well-established fragmented picture-naming test with proven adequate reliability. A group <b>of</b> patients with <b>amnesia</b> <b>of</b> non-Korsakoff etiology was compared to a control group. While amnesic patients showed a deficit in perceptual priming, both groups showed a comparable level of processing effect. Our results confirm that when a reliable implicit memory test is used <b>amnesia</b> and levels <b>of</b> processing can both be shown to affect implicit memory performance. Thus, functional dissociations between explicit and implicit memory tests may be the consequence of a methodological artifact, that is, {{a difference in the}} reliability of the tests...|$|R

50|$|Causes <b>of</b> <b>infant</b> {{mortality}} directly {{lead to the}} death. Environmental {{and social}} barriers prevent access to basic medical resources and thus contribute to an increasing infant mortality rate; 99% <b>of</b> <b>infant</b> deaths occur in developing countries, and 86% of these deaths are due to infections, premature births, complications during delivery, and perinatal asphyxia and birth injuries. Greatest percentage reduction <b>of</b> <b>infant</b> mortality occurs in countries that already have low rates <b>of</b> <b>infant</b> mortality.Common causes are preventable with low-cost measures. In the United States, a primary determinant <b>of</b> <b>infant</b> mortality risk is infant birth weight with lower birth weights increasing the risk <b>of</b> <b>infant</b> mortality. The determinants of low birth weight include socio-economic, psychological, behavioral and environmental factors.|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to compare the test results of normal 4 -month-old infants on the Movement Assessment <b>of</b> <b>Infants</b> with the {{published}} Movement Assessment <b>of</b> <b>Infants</b> a priori profile. We tested 50 healthy 4 -month-old infants (24 white, 20 black, 6 other races) on 65 Movement Assessment <b>of</b> <b>Infants</b> items, encompassing the categories of muscle tone, primitive reflexes, automatic re-actions, and volitional movements. The total-risk score was a sum of categorical risk scores. A between-group analysis of variance showed that the total-risk scores did not differ significantly by sex or race. Thirty percent <b>of</b> the <b>infants</b> we tested had total-risk scores greater than 7, which differed significantly from the 15 % in the original Movement Assessment <b>of</b> <b>Infants</b> data.

40|$|The {{factors that}} {{contribute}} to individual differences in the reward value <b>of</b> cute <b>infant</b> facial characteristics are poorly understood. Here we show that the effect of cuteness on a behavioral measure of the reward value <b>of</b> <b>infant</b> faces is greater among women reporting strong maternal tendencies. By contrast, maternal tendencies did not predict women’s subjective ratings of the cuteness <b>of</b> these <b>infant</b> faces. These results show, for the first time, that the reward value <b>of</b> <b>infant</b> facial cuteness is greater among women who report being more interested in interacting with infants, implicating maternal tendencies in individual differences in the reward value <b>of</b> <b>infant</b> cuteness. Moreover, our results indicate that the relationship between maternal tendencies and the reward value <b>of</b> <b>infant</b> facial cuteness is not due to individual differences in women’s ability to detect infant cuteness. This latter result suggests that individual differences in the reward value <b>of</b> <b>infant</b> cuteness are not simply a byproduct of low cost, functionless biases in the visual system...|$|R

40|$|This study {{explored}} {{the relationship between}} the age of development of 5 locomotor behaviors, the level <b>of</b> <b>infant</b> activity for the locomotor behaviors, and the performance of the sample <b>of</b> <b>infants</b> on standardized indices <b>of</b> <b>infant</b> development (Fagan Test <b>of</b> <b>Infant</b> Intelligence, FTII; Bayley Scales <b>of</b> <b>Infant</b> Development, BSID-II). A total <b>of</b> 157 <b>infants</b> were assessed at 6, 9, and 12 months for their activity levels on the 5 locomotor behaviors of interest, and the age at which each locomotor behavior occurred was obtained through records maintained by each infants 2 ̆ 7 caregiver. The results of the regression path analysis indicates that the timing of acquisition of locomotor behaviors is reciprocally related to how active infants are, and that over time these factors contribute to how infants perform on more global measures of development. The main implications of these findings are that the rate of development <b>of</b> future <b>infant</b> locomotor behavior was influenced by how active the infant was in a current locomotor behavior. The acquisition of specific locomotor behaviors (i. e., standing unsupported and walking supported) was significantly and negatively correlated with infant performance on a Psychomotor Development Index of a standardized measure <b>of</b> <b>infant</b> development (BSID-II, Bayley, 1993). ...|$|R

40|$|The {{perception}} <b>of</b> <b>infant</b> emotions is {{an integral}} part of sensitive caregiving within the mother-child relationship, a maternal ability which develops in mothers during their own attachment history. In this study we address the association between maternal attachment representation and brain activity underlying the perception <b>of</b> <b>infant</b> emotions. Event related potentials (ERPs) of 32 primiparous mothers were assessed during a three stimulus oddball task presenting negative, positive and neutral emotion expressions <b>of</b> <b>infants</b> as target, deviant or standard stimuli. Attachment representation was assessed with the Adult Attachment Interview during pregnancy. Securely attached mothers recognized emotions <b>of</b> <b>infants</b> more accurately than insecurely attached mothers. ERPs yielded amplified N 170 amplitudes for insecure mothers when focusing on negative infant emotions. Secure mothers showed enlarged P 3 amplitudes to target emotion expressions <b>of</b> <b>infants</b> compared to insecure mothers, especially within conditions with frequent negative infant emotions. In these conditions, P 3 latencies were prolonged in insecure mothers. In summary, maternal attachment representation was found associated with brain activity during the perception <b>of</b> <b>infant</b> emotions.
