25|$|In mid–2011, the Hungarian Natural History Museum was {{threatened}} with eviction from its building (known as the Ludovika Campus), which it received {{after the fall}} of communism in 1989. The government wanted to turn the premises into a university for the military or police, similar to its function prior to 1945, and thereby relocate the 70 staff and 10 million artifacts into a yet undecided space. A few days <b>after</b> <b>this</b> <b>news,</b> the government's Office of Public Affairs issued a joint press release with the museum that addressed the issue. They explained that in spite of two decades of effort, the museum still operates in three separate locations. Additionally, the move of the proposed National Civil Servant University into unutilized space in the Ludovika Campus would make it possible for the museum to receive additional space elsewhere, thereby improving its current situation by reducing the number of sites where it operates. The museum would keep the current space in the Ludovika's former stables and the underground rooms that it uses. The museum's leadership would also take part in the preparatory work regarding the renovations of the Ludovika Campus. Long–term plans involve moving the Hungarian Natural History Museum to the completed Museum Quarter.|$|E
25|$|The Grand Duke {{informs the}} King that Cinderella, who remains anonymous, has escaped, {{and that the}} Prince wishes to marry her. The lost glass slipper is the only piece of evidence. The King issues a royal {{proclamation}} ordering every maiden in the kingdom to try on the slipper for size {{in an effort to}} find the girl. <b>After</b> <b>this</b> <b>news</b> reaches Cinderella's household, Tremaine realizes her stepdaughter is that girl when hearing her humming the waltz played at the ball and locks her in her attic bedroom. Later, the Duke arrives at the château, and Jaq and Gus steal the key from Tremaine's dress pocket and take it up to the attic as Anastasia and Drizella unsuccessfully try on the slipper. Tremaine's cat, Lucifer, ambushes the mice, but Bruno chases him out of the house, allowing the mice to free Cinderella. As the Duke is about to leave, Cinderella appears and asks to try on the slipper. Knowing it will fit, Lady Tremaine trips the footman as he brings the Duke the slipper, causing it to shatter on the floor. Much to her horror, Cinderella presents the Duke with the other slipper, which fits perfectly. The film ends with a now-married Prince and Cinderella at their wedding, sharing a kiss as they leave.|$|E

6000|$|Friedrich's orderings and adjustings, dated Lubben, {{where his}} Army rested <b>after</b> <b>this</b> <b>news</b> from Berlin, were manifold; {{and a good}} deal still of wrecks from the Berlin Business fell to his share. For instance, one thing he had at once ordered: [...] "Your Bill of a Million-and-half to the Russians, don't pay it, or any part of it! When Bamberg was ransomed, Spring gone a year,--Reich and Kaiser, did they respect our Bill we had on Bamberg? Did not they cancel it, and flatly refuse?" [...] Friedrich is {{positive}} on the point, [...] "Reprisal our clear remedy!" [...] But Berlin itself was in alarm, for perhaps another Russian visit; Berlin and Gotzkowsky were humbly positive the other way. Upon which a visit of Gotskowsky to the Royal Camp: [...] "Merchants' Bills are a sacred thing, your Majesty!" [...] urged Gotzkowsky. Who, in his zeal for the matter, undertook dangerous visits to the Russian Quarters, {{and a great deal of}} trouble, peril and expense, during the weeks following. Magnanimous Gotzkowsky, [...] "in mere bribes to the Russian Officials, spent about 6,000 pounds of his own," [...] for one item. But he had at length convinced his Majesty that Merchants' Bills were a sacred thing, in spite of Bamberg and desecrative individualities; and that this Million-and-half must be paid. Friedrich was struck with Gotzkowsky and his view of the facts. Friedrich, from his own distressed funds, handed to Gotzkowsky the necessary Million-and-half, commanding only profound silence about it; and to Gotzkowsky himself a present of 150,000 thalers (20,000 pounds odd); [Archenholtz, ii. 146.] and so the matter did at last end.|$|E
