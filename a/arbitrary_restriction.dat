6000|$|These strange conceits are {{connected}} with a highly characteristic example of M. Comte's frenzy for regulation. He cannot bear that anything should be left unregulated: {{there ought to be}} no such thing as hesitation; nothing should remain arbitrary, for l'arbitraire is always favourable to egoism. Submission to artificial prescriptions is as indispensable as to natural laws, and he boasts that under the reign of sentiment, human life may be made equally, and even more, regular than the courses of the stars. But the great instrument of exact regulation for the details of life is numbers: fixed numbers, therefore, should be introduced into all our conduct. M. Comte's first application of this system was to the correction of his own literary style. Complaint had been made, not undeservedly, that in his first great work, especially {{in the latter part of}} it, the sentences and paragraphs were long, clumsy, and involved. To correct this fault, of which he was aware, he imposed on himself the following rules. No sentence was to exceed two lines of his manuscript, equivalent to five of print. No paragraph was to consist of more than seven sentences. He further applied to his prose writing the rule of French versification which forbids a hiatus(the concourse of two vowels), not allowing it to himself even at the break between two sentences or two paragraphs; nor did he permit himself ever to use the same word twice, either in the same sentence or in two consecutive sentences, though belonging to different paragraphs: with the exception of the monosyllabic auxiliaries.[27] All this is well enough, especially the first two precepts, and a good way of breaking through a bad habit. But M. Comte persuaded himself that any <b>arbitrary</b> <b>restriction,</b> though in no way emanating from, and therefore necessarily disturbing, the natural order and proportion of the thoughts, is a benefit in itself, and tends to improve style. If it renders composition vastly more difficult, he rejoices at it, as tending to confine writing to superior minds. Accordingly, in the Synthèse Subjective, he institutes the following [...] "plan for all compositions of importance." [...] "Every volume really capable of forming a distinct treatise" [...] should consist of [...] "seven chapters, besides the introduction and the conclusion; and each of these should be composed of three parts." [...] Each third part of a chapter should be divided into [...] "seven sections, each composed of seven groups of sentences, separated by the usual break of line. Normally formed, the section offers a central group of seven sentences, preceded and followed by three groups of five: the first section of each part reduces to three sentences three of its groups, symmetrically placed; the last section gives seven sentences to each of its extreme groups. These rules of composition make prose approach to the regularity of poetry, when combined with my previous reduction of the maximum length of a sentence to two manuscript or five printed lines, that is, 250 letters." [...] "Normally constructed, great poems consist of thirteen cantos, decomposed into parts, sections, and groups like my chapters, saving the complete equality of the groups and of the sections." [...] "This difference of structure between volumes of poetry and of philosophy is more apparent than real, for the introduction and the conclusion of a poem should comprehend six of its thirteen cantos," [...] leaving, therefore, the cabalistic numeber seven for the body of the poem. And all this regulation not being sufficiently meaningless, fantastic, and oppressive, he invents an elaborate system for compelling each of his sections and groups to begin with a letter of the alphabet, determined beforehand, the letters being selected so as to compose words having [...] "a synthetic or sympathetic signification," [...] and as close a relation as possible to the section or part to which they are appropriated.|$|E

5000|$|DNA binding sites can be {{categorized}} according to their biological function. Thus, we can distinguish between transcription factor-binding sites, restriction sites and recombination sites. Some authors have proposed that binding sites could also be classified according to their most convenient mode of representation. On the one hand, restriction sites can be generally represented by consensus sequences. This is because they target mostly identical sequences and restriction efficiency decreases abruptly for less similar sequences. On the other hand, DNA binding sites for a given transcription factor are usually all different, {{with varying degrees of}} affinity of the transcription factor for the different binding sites. This makes it difficult to accurately represent transcription factor binding sites using consensus sequences, and they are typically represented using position specific frequency matrices (PSFM), which are often graphically depicted using sequence logos. This argument, however, is partly <b>arbitrary.</b> <b>Restriction</b> enzymes, like transcription factors, yield a gradual, though sharp, range of affinities for different sites [...] and are thus also best represented by PSFM. Likewise, site-specific recombinases also show a varied range of affinities for different target sites.|$|E

40|$|The dynamic {{stochastic}} general equilibrium (DSGE) {{models that}} are used to study business cycles typically assume that exogenous disturbances are independent autoregressions of order one. This paper relaxes this tight and <b>arbitrary</b> <b>restriction,</b> by allowing for disturbances that have a rich contemporaneous and dynamic correlation structure. Our first contribution is a new Bayesian econometric method that uses conjugate conditionals and Gibbs sampling to make the estimation of DSGE models with correlated disturbances feasible. This provides a useful check for model misspecification in the search for models with structural disturbances. Our second contribution is a re-examination of U. S. business cycles. We find that allowing for correlated disturbances resolves some conflicts between estimates from DSGE models and those from vector autoregressions, and that treating government spending as exogenous in spite of its clear countercyclicality in the data is the main source of misspecification. According to our estimates, government spending and technology disturbances play a larger role in the business cycle than previously ascribed, while changes in markups are less important. ...|$|E
40|$|In {{contrast}} to traditional philosophy, Habermas does not view his 'postmetaphysical thought' as {{a conception of}} reality that claims to be true. Actually, however, his 'postmetaphysical thought' is a metaphysical dualism, which stands {{in opposition to the}} metaphysical naturalism proposed by other contemporary philosophers. In a specific way, he draws upon the Kantian idea of the constitutive function of reason. He holds, as other constructivists, an idealistic metaphysics that leads him to the construction of an epistemic dualism, contrasting the objective world of the natural sciences with the 'Lebenswelt'. It turns out that he is unable to solve the problems connected with this view. Metaphysical realism, which avoids these problems, is rejected by him. His 'postmetaphysical thought', Habermas tells us, does not presume to decide what is reasonable or not in religious teachings. The core of religious experience, he suggests, is 'opaque' and therefore immune to criticism. Faith and knowledge are, as it seems, incommensurable, so that a reasonable critique of religion is impossible. Thus, he consents to an <b>arbitrary</b> <b>restriction</b> of the use of reason, as proposed also by Joseph Ratzinger.

40|$|Modern {beta}-ray spectrometers {{are based}} upon the concept, first {{introduced}} by Svartholm and Siegbahn in 1946, of focusing in both the radial and vertical directions. The theory of axially symmetric devices has been carefully studied by {{a large number of}} workers, culminating in the analysis, in 1956, of Lee-Whiting and Taylor. These last authors calculate aberrations through the sixth order and show that by appropriate choice of the magnetic field a spectrometer can be designed with a relatively large transmission and a high resolution. The acceptable transmission is remarkable because the second-order 'spherical' aberration in the median plane of the image cannot be made to vanish identically, and consequently the design is forced to a tall thin aperture (or a slightly less advantageous short wide aperture) which a priori would seem to imply a low transmission. It is the purpose of this communication to show that if the <b>arbitrary</b> <b>restriction</b> to axially symmetric fields is removed, then both the radial and the vertical contributions to the 'spherical' aberration can be made to vanish in second order.

40|$|This study {{examines}} the political implication of "Directive Principles of Fundamental State Policies" {{in the context}} of Thailand's constitution, in comparison with other countries' constitutions. Democratization in Thailand accelerated in the 1990 s. As pointed out in many previous studies, the urban middle class and traditional elite began increasingly to express their frustration with the democratically elected government, citing, among others, corrupt politicians and electoral fraud as problems. A new constitution was promulgated in 1997 with the ostensible goal of resolving these issues, and this goal has been inherited by the current 2007 constitution. "Constitutionalism" was declared a keyword of the political reform, and it was expected that the judiciary would be the institution responsible for resolving these issues. Careful examination of the 1997 and 2007 constitutions reveals that they codify various efforts aimed at constraining the National Assembly, comprising representatives of the citizens, and the Council of Ministers. In contrast to Western-style constitutionalism, in which the constitution and laws are employed to protect citizens' rights and to prevent the arbitrary use of state power while respecting democracy in the sense of rule by the majority, Thailand's constitution is structured {{in such a way that}} it enables <b>arbitrary</b> <b>restriction</b> of state power, and particularly that of the Council of Ministers, by the judiciary. Further, I point out that, as such, the 1997 and 2007 constitutions both serve to suppress the popular will that is expressed through elections...|$|E
40|$|Arrest in flagrante delicto {{is one of}} {{the cases}} in which the {{international}} and national legal framework allows the restriction of the right to freedom. Currently, the individual and his fundamental rights are in the focus of human society. Some of them are absolute and some others have a relative character. The right to freedom, notwithstanding its importance, is a right of relative character but with cases of its restriction exhaustively defined. The protection of this right is extended both in horizontal perspective versus the actions of other persons, providing a legal-criminal defense and in vertical context, in the face of repressive power of the state, which adopted the most significant position in the case of someone’s arrest or detention. The latter constitute an indicator of an incomparable relation between the force of state power and a person’s vulnerability. The exact meaning of arrest in flagrante delicto and its application only in the conditions and criteria set out by the criminal procedural legislation prevents <b>arbitrary</b> <b>restriction</b> of the right to freedom. A key importance in the analysis of this institute is attached to ECtHR jurisprudence that is consolidated and detailed in addressing the right to freedom. The respect and application of standards affirmed by this court on part of the state institutions directly affects the consolidation of rule of law. The criminal procedural legislation has consented to the general principle according to which “only the judge has the power to apply a security measure restricting personal liberty, a measure that has continuous effects over time, although such measures have a specific maximum duration”. According to this approach, the arrest in flagrante delicto is qualified due to its character, as a temporary measure applied in situations of emergency when the procedure for security measure cannot be effectively applied. As already known, it is linked with the power of judicial police to take, in extraordinary, emergent, indispensable and compulsory cases provided by law, a provisional restrictive measure against an individual’s freedom, without prejudicing the need for a guarantee by the judicial authority...|$|E
40|$|LL. M. Chapter 1 {{investigates the}} {{requirement}} of praedia utilitas. The continuing existence of this requirement is considered desirable and therefore the broad interpretation thereof by van Oven and others is rejected. Their approach involves a disregard of the benefit requirement. Attention is drawn {{to the fact that}} in South African law (unlike Roman law), not only is the natural condition of the dominant tenement taken into account, but also its arrangement. in deciding whether the benefit requirement is complied with. Several criteria for the benefit requirement (from common law, Dutch and South African authors and cases) are discussed. The conclusion is reached that no decisive criterium has yet been found nor is it probable that one will be found. The different criteria have to be weighed up against each other. One has to accept that economic, social and historical considerations, apart from these criteria. can play a part in the decision whether or not an alleged praedial servitude satisfies the benefit requirement. Some of these are briefly discussed. In a supplement Dutch cases on {{the requirement of}} praedia utilitas are discussed. Chapter 2 investigates the requirement of perpetua causa. Three different aspects of this requirement are considered. Some authors deduct from the first part of D 8 2 28 the principle that the possibility of exercising a praedial servitude may not be dependent on an act by the owner or user of the servient tenement. This aspect of the requirement is rejected as there is almost no authority for it in South African law and because it is undesirable in terms of legal policy. The second aspect of the requirement demands the eternal capability of the servient tenement to provide a benefit to the dominant tenement, whilst the dominant tenement must have a corresponding eternal need in this regard. Different author's views on the relationship between this aspect of the requirement of perpetua causa and the requirement of praedia utilitas, are discussed. The confusion of others concerning the difference between a causa perpetua and a causa continuam is indicated. It is pointed out that the requirement of perpetua causa is not properly founded in common law. In Roman law a causa perpetua was only required for servitudes concerning water, which had to be aqua viva to satisfy this requirement. In South African law aqua viva is not required and therefore the requirement of perpetua causa became obsolete. The position in modern Dutch law is researched. On grounds of legal policy the perpetua causa-requirement is considered undesirable, as it constitutes an <b>arbitrary</b> <b>restriction</b> on socially beneficial real burdens. The abolishment of the requirement will be in accordance with the recent attempts by South African jurists to adopt a more social definition of the concept of ownership. The third aspect of the requirement (that a praedial servitude may not be constituted under a resolutive condition or period fixture), has been abolished long ago. Chapter 3 investigates the requirement of vicinitas. The view is taken that a great distance between the dominant and servient tenements is not per se in conflict with this requirement. The requirement is seen merely as a manifestation of the utilitas-requirement with regard to the distance between the tenements. Support for this viewpoint is found in common law, modern Dutch, English and South African law. The dominant and servient tenements may be any distance apart, provided the servient tenement can properly benefit the dominant tenement. According to D 8 3 7 1, de a 1 i ng with rura 1 servitudes, an intermediate tenement must be subject to an appropriate servitude. The validity of this rule in common law, modern Dutch and South African law is investigated. The position of the owner of the dominant tenement who has the competence to use the intermediate tenement precario, is discussed with reference to English and Dutch cases. The conclusion is reached, on authority and grounds of policy, that the rule in Q 8 3 7 1 should not be followed in South African law. The existence of a praedial servitude is admissible if the servitude, having regard to the factual situation, will probably benefit the dominant tenement, notwithstanding the presence of any unburdened intermediate tenements...|$|E
