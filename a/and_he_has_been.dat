In his book Planet Simpson, Chris Turner describes Bart as a nihilist, a philosophical position that argues that existence is without objective meaning, purpose, or intrinsic value.|$|E
5|$|Chopin's music, {{his status}} as one of music's {{earliest}} superstars, his association (if only indirect) with political insurrection, his love life and his early death have made him a leading symbol of the Romantic era in the public consciousness. His works remain popular, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> the subject of numerous films and biographies of varying degrees of historical accuracy.|$|E

5|$|Five large stelae {{were raised}} in 741, {{although}} {{the name of the}} king responsible is illegible on all of them <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> labelled as Ruler Y. Calakmul's presence in the wider Maya area continued to wane, with two of the city's major allies suffering defeats at the hands of Tikal. El Peru was defeated in 743 and Naranjo a year later and this resulted in the final collapse of Calakmul's once powerful alliance network, while Tikal underwent a resurgence in its power.|$|E
5|$|In contrast, Somerset's {{successor}} John Dudley, Earl of Warwick, made Duke of Northumberland in 1551, {{was once}} regarded by historians {{merely as a}} grasping schemer who cynically elevated and enriched himself {{at the expense of}} the crown. Since the 1970s, the administrative and economic achievements of his regime have been recognised, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> credited with restoring the authority of the royal Council and returning the government to an even keel after the disasters of Somerset's protectorate.|$|E

5|$|By 1953 Quatermass is {{the head}} of the British Experimental Rocket Group, which has a {{programme}} to launch a manned rocket into space from a base in Tarooma, Australia. Although Quatermass succeeds in launching a three-man crew, the rocket vastly overshoots its projected orbit and returns to Earth much later than planned, crash-landing in London. Only one of the crew, Victor Carroon, remains, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> taken over by an alien presence, eventually forcing Quatermass to destroy him and the other two crewmembers who have been absorbed into him in a climax set in Westminster Abbey.|$|E

5|$|Many of Sorabji's {{works are}} {{written for the}} piano or have an {{important}} piano part. His writing for the instrument was influenced by that of composers such as Liszt, Alkan and Godowsky, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> described as a composer-pianist in their tradition, partly because {{he was one of}} the 20th century's most prolific piano composers. It exhibits particularly the influence of Godowsky, specifically in its polyphony and its use of polyrhythms and polydynamics. This necessitated the regular use of systems of more than two staves in Sorabji's keyboard parts, reaching its peak on page 124 of the manuscript of his Third Organ Symphony (1949–53), which uses 11 staves, as well as frequent calls for use of the sostenuto pedal.|$|E
5|$|Noam Chomsky (1928) {{was born}} in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, to Jewish {{immigrants}} from Eastern Europe. Becoming academically involved {{in the field of}} linguistics, Chomsky eventually secured a job as Professor of Department of Linguistics & Philosophy at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. In the field of linguistics, he is credited as the creator or co-creator of the Chomsky hierarchy, the universal grammar theory, and the Chomsky–Schützenberger theorem. Politically, Chomsky had held radical leftist views since childhood, identifying himself with anarcho-syndicalism and libertarian socialism. He was particularly known for his critiques of U.S. foreign policy and contemporary capitalism, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> described as a prominent cultural figure.|$|E
5|$|The breed {{remained}} relatively unknown {{outside of the}} borders until 1815 when Sir Walter Scott's novel Guy Mannering was published. Scott had spent time in the area whilst the Sheriff of Selkirkshire and had learned of the prowess {{of these types of}} specialist terriers for working both fox and otter. When he wrote Guy Mannering, he included a character by the name of Dandie Dinmont who owned a number of terriers named Pepper and Mustard after the colours of their coats. The Dinmont character was partly based on the real life farmer and terrier owner, James Davidson, who too used the generic terms of Pepper and Mustard for his dogs depending on their coats. Davidson's dogs came {{from a variety of sources}} including the dogs of the Allan, Anderson and Faas families. Davidson documented his breeding, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> accepted as the originator of the modern breed.|$|E

5|$|Walker finally meets Konrad at his penthouse. Konrad {{appears to}} be the charismatic, villainous force behind the atrocities that Walker was hoping for, until Walker finds his {{decaying}} corpse on the penthouse deck. Walker finds that Konrad committed suicide after his failed evacuation effort, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> communicating with a traumatic hallucinatory Konrad, created in his mind as a dissociative disorder upon the aftermath of the white phosphorus strike. Rationalizing the actions he had witnessed and carried out, Walker distorted many subsequent events of the game to make Konrad look responsible. With this revelation, 'Konrad' forces Walker, at gunpoint, to decide once and for all if he is to blame for his actions in Dubai.|$|E
5|$|Wilde's life {{continues}} to fascinate, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> {{the subject of}} numerous biographies since his death. The earliest were memoirs by those who knew him: often they are personal or impressionistic accounts which can be good character sketches, but are sometimes factually unreliable. Frank Harris, his friend and editor, wrote a biography, Oscar Wilde: His Life and Confessions (1916); though prone to exaggeration and sometimes factually inaccurate, it offers a good literary portrait of Wilde. Lord Alfred Douglas wrote two books {{about his relationship with}} Wilde. Oscar Wilde and Myself (1914), largely ghost-written by T. W. H. Crosland, vindictively reacted to Douglas's discovery that De Profundis was addressed to him and defensively tried to distance him from Wilde's scandalous reputation. Both authors later regretted their work. Later, in Oscar Wilde: A Summing Up (1939) and his Autobiography he was more sympathetic to Wilde. Of Wilde's other close friends, Robert Sherard; Robert Ross, his literary executor; and Charles Ricketts variously published biographies, reminiscences or correspondence. The first more or less objective biography of Wilde came about when Hesketh Pearson wrote Oscar Wilde: His Life and Wit (1946). In 1954 Wilde's son Vyvyan Holland published his memoir Son of Oscar Wilde, which recounts the difficulties Wilde's wife and children faced after his imprisonment. It was revised and updated by Merlin Holland in 1989.|$|E

Sungmin realizes the skipping rope had caused him more harm than good, <b>and</b> ultimately <b>he</b> throws it into the Han River.|$|R
50|$|The records {{held in the}} Birmingham Archive {{show that}} Hardman's were not always {{punctual}} in delivery, and General Fitzgerald refused {{to pay the bill}} for the windows until alterations <b>had</b> <b>been</b> made <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> supplied with a drawing of the design.|$|R
5000|$|Davis {{was born}} in Chestertown, Maryland, on August 13, 1847. He {{received}} his education and graduated in 1866 at Washington College in his native State.
