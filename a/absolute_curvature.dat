40|$|One of the {{remaining}} challenges when reconstructing a surface from a finite sample is recovering non-smooth surface features like sharp edges. There is practical evidence showing that a two step approach could be an aid to this problem, namely, first computing a polyhedral reconstruction isotopic to the sampled surface, and secondly minimizing the <b>absolute</b> Gaussian <b>curvature</b> of this reconstruction globally. The first step ensures topological correctness and the second step improves the geometric accuracy of the reconstruction {{in the presence of}} sharp features without changing its topology. Unfortunately it is computationally hard to minimize the <b>absolute</b> Gaussian <b>curvature</b> globally. Hence we study a local variant of <b>absolute</b> Gaussian <b>curvature</b> minimization problem which is still meaningful in the context of surface fairing. <b>Absolute</b> Gaussian <b>curvature</b> like Gaussian curvature is concentrated at the vertices of a polyhedral surface embedded into mathbbR^ 3.
