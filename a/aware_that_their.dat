5|$|Lindwall {{was born}} at Mascot, Sydney, New South Wales, the fourth of five children. He had one younger sister, two older sisters {{one of which was}} Eileen Lindwall who married Frank Weston and an older brother. The {{grandson}} of Swedish and Irish immigrants, Lindwall had a difficult childhood with his mother Catherine dying of pneumonia when he was seven. His father Arthur had a job at the Water and Sewerage Board, but the children were <b>aware</b> <b>that</b> <b>their</b> father could not financially support them beyond school-leaving age.|$|E
5|$|The {{aggressive}} Weyrother persuaded Archduke John and Lauer {{to launch}} an offensive. The Austrian chief of staff planned to strike {{in the direction of}} Landshut. From there, the Austrians would either wheel left to smash the French left flank or possibly get across their enemies' line of communications to the west of Munich. However, in the last days of November, the Austrian army proved unable to advance with the necessary speed to turn the French north flank. <b>Aware</b> <b>that</b> <b>their</b> adversaries were also advancing, Lauer convinced the archduke to convert the flank march into a direct advance on Munich.|$|E
5|$|A {{week later}} with the skies clearing, birds began to appear, {{signalling}} a proximity to land. On 28 May, the Great Barrier Reef was sighted; Bligh found a navigable gap and sailed the launch into a calm lagoon. Late that afternoon, he ran the boat ashore on a small island which he named Restoration Island, where the men found oysters and berries in plentiful supply {{and were able to}} eat ravenously. Over the next four days, the party island-hopped northward within the lagoon, <b>aware</b> <b>that</b> <b>their</b> movements were being closely monitored by natives on the mainland. Strains were showing within the party; following a heated disagreement with Purcell, Bligh grabbed a cutlass and challenged the carpenter to fight. Fryer told Cole to arrest their captain, but backed down after Bligh threatened to kill him if he interfered.|$|E

50|$|Blogging {{and social}} {{networking}} have become effective tools to register protest and grievances. Protests can express views, news and use viral networking {{to reach out}} to thousands of people. With protests on the rise from the election season of 2016 going into 2017, protestors became <b>aware</b> <b>that</b> using <b>their</b> social media during protest could make them an easier target for government surveillance.|$|R
5000|$|With the {{ambition}} {{for it to}} become London's sole burial site in perpetuity, the LNC were <b>aware</b> <b>that</b> if <b>their</b> plans were successful, their Necropolis would become a site of major national importance. As a consequence, the cemetery was designed with attractiveness in mind, {{in contrast to the}} squalid and congested London burial grounds and the newer suburban cemeteries which were already becoming crowded.|$|R
5|$|After a brief {{stay with}} her still grieving parents in heavily bombed Portsmouth, Manning moved into a London flat. Reggie arrived {{during the summer of}} 1945, and found a job in the Features Department of the BBC. He was {{identified}} as a Communist spy by MI5 in 1947, and placed under surveillance. According to his file, Reggie had been working to increase Soviet influence in Romania and the Middle East throughout the war. Manning did not share her husband's political beliefs, but was quite <b>aware</b> <b>that</b> <b>their</b> phone was being tapped and feared that his open support for Communism would lead to him being sacked from the BBC. Reggie was soon transferred away from Features to the less politically sensitive Drama department. The surveillance stopped when he resigned from the Communist Party after the Russian invasion of Hungary in 1956.|$|E
5|$|At the {{beginning}} of 1916, Stevens announced the policy that the CUWS had organized in twenty-two states and planned on recruiting delegates {{for each of the}} 435 House Districts. The delegates were required to form committees to press Congressional Members to favor suffrage and make them <b>aware</b> <b>that</b> <b>their</b> constituents were in favor of women attaining the vote. Another strategy Stevens began implementing early in 1916 required CUWS members to go to other states in which women were allowed to vote, establish residence and register to vote. In this way, they could vote in state and national elections in the hope of filling the legislature with legislators who favored suffrage. Stevens registered to vote in Kansas that year. On 5 June 1916, the CUWS became the National Woman's Party (NWP), having a single platform to acquire a constitutional amendment for national women's suffrage. After attending the NWP convention in Chicago in June, Stevens headed to a convention in Colorado. By October, Stevens was organizing and managing the NWP election campaign in California.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} the Garfield {{administration}} assumed office in 1881, the Navy's condition had deteriorated still further. A review conducted {{on behalf of the}} new Secretary of the Navy, William H. Hunt, found that of 140 vessels on the Navy's active list, only 52 were in an operational state, of which a mere 17 were iron-hulled ships, including 14 aging Civil War era ironclads. Hunt recognized the necessity of modernizing the Navy, and set up an informal advisory board to make recommendations. Also to be expected, morale was considerably down; officers and sailors in foreign ports were all too <b>aware</b> <b>that</b> <b>their</b> old wooden ships would not survive long in the event of war. The limitations of the monitor type effectively prevented the United States from projecting power overseas, and until the 1890s the United States would have come off badly in a conflict with even Spain or the Latin American powers.|$|E

But she reminds him of her duty as a committed wife to accompany him wherever he was. Overcome by hunger and thirst, she rests her head on her husband’s lap and sleeps.|$|R

25|$|The Spanish {{branch of}} the Habsburg royal family was noted for extreme consanguinity. Well <b>aware</b> <b>that</b> they owed <b>their</b> power to {{fortunate}} marriages, they married between themselves to protect their gains. Philip and Mariana were actually uncle and niece; therefore, Charles was not only their son, but was also Mariana's first-cousin and Philip's great-nephew.|$|R
5|$|The Romans {{were well}} <b>aware</b> <b>that</b> <b>their</b> victory was still fragile, {{and that as}} soon as the Parthian king had dealt with the Hyrcanian rebellion, he would turn his {{attention}} to Armenia. Despite Vologases' reluctance to risk an all-out conflict with Rome, in the end, he was forced to act when Tigranes raided the Parthian province of Adiabene in 61. The enraged protests of its governor Monobazus, and his pleas for protection, could not be ignored by Vologases, whose prestige and royal authority were at stake. Vologases therefore hastily concluded a treaty with the Hyrcanians so as to be free to campaign against Rome, and called an assembly of the grandees of his realm. There he publicly reaffirmed Tiridates' position as king of Armenia by crowning him with a diadem. In order to reinstall his brother on the Armenian throne, the Parthian king assembled a force of picked cavalry under Monaeses, complemented by infantry from Adiabene.|$|E
25|$|Additionally, the WGA {{appealed to}} members of crew and {{industry}} craft unions, including the Teamsters, and IATSE, some of whom {{may not have been}} <b>aware</b> <b>that</b> <b>their</b> union also received residuals to pay for health and pension programs, and that they were expected to directly benefit from residual gains made by the WGA.|$|E
25|$|Aripiprazole is a {{substrate}} of CYP2D6 and CYP3A4. Coadministration with {{medications that}} inhibit (e.g. paroxetine, fluoxetine) or induce (e.g. carbamazepine) these metabolic enzymes {{are known to}} increase and decrease, respectively, plasma levels of aripiprazole. As such, anyone taking aripiprazole should be <b>aware</b> <b>that</b> <b>their</b> dosage of aripiprazole {{may need to be}} adjusted.|$|E
2500|$|The Carthaginian fleet was sailing at a {{slow pace}} to give Himilco more time to catch up. The Carthaginian fleet at this time {{contained}} 300 triremes and 200 transports. To maximize the fighting potential of the fleet, the Carthaginians had armed the transports, (which were slower than the warships) with rams. [...] The Punic fleet arrived at Catana, <b>aware</b> <b>that</b> without <b>their</b> army present, they were vulnerable to the Greek army when they beached their ships at night. If the fleet anchored at sea, they would be vulnerable to bad weather.|$|R
50|$|In {{the current}} case, the Court found that earlier {{argument}} facile and explained <b>that</b> Congress was <b>aware</b> <b>that</b> businesses produce <b>their</b> goods without thought {{to where they}} will go, and product is pulled and shipped to meet the orders of the day. The Court also concluded that the requirement to keep records was entirely appropriate, {{as a matter of}} enforcing the Act.|$|R
50|$|In a Joan centric episode, “The Fixer”, we {{see that}} Joan worked in a {{different}} prison, and was having a relationship {{with one of the}} inmates, Jianna. Jianna's baby was taken away from her, and Joan blamed Will Jackson, then a social worker, for Jianna’s death. Joan wasn’t <b>aware</b> <b>that,</b> because of <b>their</b> relationship, Jianna was, in fact, killed by the other prisoners.|$|R
25|$|Unsuccessful {{negotiations}} {{were followed by}} strike action, and more than 3,000 AUPE members hit the bricks {{in the summer of}} 1980 — fully <b>aware</b> <b>that</b> <b>their</b> action was illegal. AUPE won that strike, effectively challenging existing arbitration rules and the ban on strikes. By AUPE’s fifth annual convention in October 1980, membership stood at over 41,000 — half of them women.|$|E
25|$|Rural {{parents were}} {{generally}} well <b>aware</b> <b>that</b> <b>their</b> children had limited opportunities {{to further their}} education. Some parents saw little use in having their children attend even primary school, especially after {{the establishment of the}} agricultural responsibility system. Under that system, parents preferred that their children work to increase family income - and withdrew them from school - for both long and short periods of time.|$|E
25|$|Ackerman {{championed the}} issue of newborn testing after {{discovering}} that 45 states, including New York, tested babies for HIV but used the data solely to track the prevalence of the disease in the population, and did not disclose the results to the mothers. As a result, thousands of mothers brought their infants home from the hospital, never <b>aware</b> <b>that</b> <b>their</b> children had tested positive for HIV. Ackerman stopped the anonymous testing from being reinstated in years that followed.|$|E
50|$|Allowing the {{wrongful}} birth {{cause of}} action may increase the rate of abortion, a practice some consider unethical. Doctors under threat of being sued for wrongful birth {{have an incentive to}} be vigilant in detecting the risk that prospective parents will have a congenitally diseased child, in disclosing any risks to the prospective parents, and in recommending various tests to determine the risk or existence a congenital abnormality. Thus, more prospective parents will become <b>aware</b> of <b>that</b> <b>their</b> fetuses have congenital abnormalities, giving them reason to abort.|$|R

25|$|Studies and {{experiments}} cited on the Jewish {{internet site}} Chabad.org include one conducted in 1994 by Dr. Temple Grandin - an Associate Professor of Animal Science at Colorado and a study completed in 1992 by Dr. Flemming Bager, Head of the Danish Veterinary Laboratory, {{which showed that}} when the animals were slaughtered in a comfortable position they appeared to give no resistance {{and none of the}} animals attempted to pull away their head. The studies concluded that the animals had no pain and were not even <b>aware</b> <b>that</b> <b>their</b> throats were cut.|$|E
25|$|Louis XII of France {{determined}} {{to break the}} siege. In July a force of 800 Albanians commanded by Captain Fonterailles pushed through the besieger's lines and successfully delivered gunpowder and supplies including bacon to {{the gates of the}} town, leaving 80 soldiers as reinforcements. Fonterailles was helped by covering artillery fire from the town. Reports sent to Venice mentioned 300 English casualties or more, and Fonterailles' statement that the town could hold out till the feast day of the Nativity of the Virgin, on 8 September. The Venetians were <b>aware</b> <b>that</b> <b>their</b> French sources might have been misrepresenting the situation to gain their support.|$|E
25|$|The {{majority}} {{of individuals with}} micropsia are <b>aware</b> <b>that</b> <b>their</b> perceptions do not mimic reality. Many can imagine the actual sizes of objects and distances between objects. It is common for patients suffering from micropsia {{to be able to}} indicate true size and distance despite their inability to perceive objects as they actually are. One specific patient was able to indicate the dimensions of specific objects with her hands. She was also able to estimate the distances between two objects and between an object and herself. She succeeded in indicating horizontal, vertical, and 45 degree positions and did not find it difficult to search for an object in a cluttered drawer, indicating that her figure-ground discrimination was intact despite suffering from micropsia.|$|E
50|$|The warlords gladly {{followed}} Chiang's orders, {{and they}} were eager to prove themselves. They were <b>aware</b> <b>that,</b> due to <b>their</b> collaboration with the Japanese during the Second Sino-Japanese War, they were hated by the general Chinese population (including those nationalists who had refused to surrender to, or stop fighting, the Japanese). The order from Chiang not to surrender, and to fight the communists, was a lifeline for them.|$|R
2500|$|Non-Australian {{citizens}} who are Australian permanent residents should be <b>aware</b> <b>that</b> during <b>their</b> stay on Norfolk Island they are [...] "outside of Australia" [...] {{for the purposes of}} the Migration Act. This means that not only will they need a still-valid migrant visa or Resident return visa to return from Norfolk Island to the mainland, but also the time spent in Norfolk Island will not be counted for satisfying the residence requirement for obtaining a Resident return visa in the future. On the other hand, as far as Australian nationality law is concerned, Norfolk Island is a part of Australia, and any time spent by an Australian permanent resident on Norfolk Island will count as time spent in Australia for the purpose of applying for Australian citizenship.|$|R
5000|$|In The God Delusion, anti-religion activist Richard Dawkins {{uses the}} term [...] "consciousness raising" [...] for several other things, {{explicitly}} describing these as analogous to the feminist case. These include replacing references to children as Catholic, Muslim, etc. with references to children of the adults {{who are members of}} these religions (which he compares to our using non-sexist terminology) and Darwin as [...] "raising our consciousness" [...] in biology to the possibility of explaining complexity naturalistically and, in principle, raising our consciousness to the possibility of doing such things elsewhere (especially in physics). Earlier in the book, he {{uses the term}} (without explicitly referring to feminism) to refer to making people <b>aware</b> <b>that</b> leaving <b>their</b> parents' faith is an option.|$|R
25|$|Some {{people with}} OCD perform {{compulsive}} rituals because they inexplicably {{feel they have}} to, while others act compulsively so as to mitigate the anxiety that stems from particular obsessive thoughts. The person might feel that these actions somehow either will prevent a dreaded event from occurring or will push the event from their thoughts. In any case, the individual's reasoning is so idiosyncratic or distorted that it results in significant distress for the individual with OCD or for those around them. Excessive skin picking, hair-pulling, nail biting and other body-focused repetitive behavior disorders are all on the obsessive–compulsive spectrum. Some individuals with OCD are <b>aware</b> <b>that</b> <b>their</b> behaviors are not rational, but feel compelled {{to follow through with}} them to fend off feelings of panic or dread.|$|E
25|$|For many years, {{movie studios}} were {{careless}} with old props, costumes, scripts, and other materials, unaware of their increasing value as memorabilia. Often, workers would just keep props as souvenirs without permission, <b>aware</b> <b>that</b> <b>their</b> employers did not particularly care. One {{of the more}} notorious of these was costumer Kent Warner, who amassed a large private collection and supplemented his income with sales. It was he who found the slippers in February or March 1970 while helping {{to set up a}} mammoth auction of MGM props and wardrobe. They had been stored and forgotten in the basement of MGM's wardrobe department. One pair became the centerpiece of the auction. Warner kept the best pair for himself, size 5B, and apparently sold the rest.|$|E
25|$|People with NPD tend {{to exaggerate}} {{their skills and}} accomplishments {{as well as their}} level of {{intimacy}} with people they consider to be high-status. Their sense of superiority may cause them to monopolize conversations and to become impatient or disdainful when others talk about themselves. In the course of a conversation, they may purposefully or unknowingly disparage or devalue the other person by overemphasizing their own success. When they are <b>aware</b> <b>that</b> <b>their</b> statements have hurt someone else, they tend to react with contempt and to view it as a sign of weakness. When their own ego is wounded by a real or perceived criticism, their anger can be disproportionate to the situation, but typically, their actions and responses are deliberate and calculated. Despite occasional flare-ups of insecurity, their self-image is primarily stable (i.e., overinflated).|$|E
2500|$|In 2013, Microsoft {{launched}} an advertising campaign to attack Google for scanning email messages, arguing that most consumers are not <b>aware</b> <b>that</b> Google monitors <b>their</b> personal messages to deliver targeted ads. Microsoft claims that its email service Outlook does not scan {{the contents of}} messages and a Microsoft spokesperson called the issue of privacy [...] "Google's kryptonite." [...] Other concerns include the unlimited period for data retention that Google's policies allow, {{and the potential for}} unintended secondary uses of the information Gmail collects and stores.|$|R

Michael Slezak questioned Lucious and Cookie getting along would work {{in the long term}} because they are [...] "fun adversaries." [...] Chaiken said the writers were well <b>aware</b> of <b>that</b> <b>their</b> reunion would come, but had a plan in place once it did.

30|$|Mere 10 out of {{the sample}} of 45 {{regional}} carriers maintain an official FB page. This does not come as a surprise. Business model of regional airlines is based on providing feeder services to large full-service carriers. They are relatively unknown and many passengers of US majors are not even <b>aware</b> <b>that</b> some of <b>their</b> local flights are operated by third-party airlines. Regional carriers typically do not sell flight tickets, they do not offer pre- and post-flight customer service and therefore {{they do not need}} a strong PR strategy of which presence on social networks would be a part.|$|R
