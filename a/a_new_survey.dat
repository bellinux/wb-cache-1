5|$|At the time, the River Slea was not navigable beyond Kyme, as {{the channel}} was inadequate, {{and there were}} fish weirs and water mills on its course. Three {{attempts}} were made to obtain an Act of Parliament to authorise improvements, but all were defeated. In 1791, William Jessop and John Hudson were commissioned to prepare <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>survey</b> and plans. Jessop was a canal engineer of some repute, with experience of several navigations, including the River Trent at Newark, while Hudson was less well known, but had experience of canal building in eastern England and Yorkshire. Their report was published on 25 November 1791, and estimated that the improvements would cost £9,979.|$|E

Building work across the Scilly Isles continued, expanding to include the neighbouring island of St Mary's, and at least 540 oak trees from South Wales were dispatched to the islands in early 1550, since the islands lacked suitable sources of timber of their own. Orders were given in 1551 to send bows, arrows and the ingredients required to make gunpowder to the islands, where construction teams were kept at work through to the end of 1552.|$|E

25|$|Despite many proposals, the {{railhead}} {{remained in}} Culverden {{for a number}} of decades. In 1902, the Culverden - Waiau Railway Extension League was formed, and it created enough pressure to encourage <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>survey</b> of a route from Culverden to Waiau in 1908. It wasn't until 10 June 1914, however, that work on this extension finally began, and despite delays, work continued through World War I, with the line opened to Waiau on 15 December 1919. It was then proposed that the line could be extended to Kaikoura and then through to Marlborough, and some formation was built, but this work ultimately ground to a halt and the line's terminus remained in Waiau. The line effectively became a branch of the Main North Line when approval was given to extend the Parnassus Branch up the coast as the main line; this was completed in 1945.|$|E
25|$|The Trustees next {{asked the}} civil {{engineer}} John Rennie {{to assess the}} state of the project. His inspection was carried out {{in the presence of the}} Trustees on 13–15 December 1791, and he produced a report within a week. He reported that the section from Stowmarket and Needham Market, the other main town on the waterway, was almost complete, but advised that the towpath would need to be raised in places. There were three turf and timber locks, but he suggested that further locks should be made of brick. He felt that while Jessop had laid out the plans prior to the obtaining of the initial Act of Parliament, there had been a failure to adequately survey the river and detail the works that would be required to construct the navigation. He particularly criticised Lenny's lack of accuracy, and recommended that <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>survey</b> should be made, so that the work needed could be identified.|$|E
500|$|On 9 December 1864, Basilisk {{returned}} to Dänholm, {{where she was}} decommissioned for a boiler overhaul. In 1865, the boat's 24-pounder was replaced with a rifled [...] 68-pounder gun. At {{the start of the}} Austro-Prussian War in June 1866, Basilisk was mobilized for wartime service. She was transferred to Danzig by a shipyard crew, received her crew, and joined a squadron stationed in the North Sea. The Austrian fleet was unable to leave the Adriatic Sea, owing to Prussia's alliance with Italy, and so Basilisk did not see action during the conflict. From 1867 to 1868, she took part in <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>survey</b> of the German coast in the North Sea; this duty lasted from 26 October 1867 to 21 April 1968. In May, she conducted a survey of the harbor at Tönning and the waters around Heligoland. On 6 November, Basilisk was decommissioned for a second time, this time in Geestemünde.|$|E

500|$|John Dallaway, who {{had been}} {{appointed}} as a commissioner under the 1730 Act, commissioned the engineer Thomas Yeoman to make <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>survey</b> in 1754, and his new plan was published the following year. It was for a navigation from Wallbridge to the Severn, estimated to cost £8,145, which would require 16 locks and four stanks (which were probably half-locks or staunches). In order to placate the millers, water for {{the operation of the}} locks would be provided by a reservoir below Wallbridge, which would cover [...] and be filled on Sundays, when the mills were inactive and would not be needing the water. Tolls were set at a more realistic level. While support and finance for the scheme were being gained, John Kemmett, Arthur Wynde, James Pynock and Thomas Bridge devised a scheme which used cranes at each mill weir to transfer cargo, stored in boxes, from a boat on one level to another {{on the other side of}} the weir. An Act was obtained in 1759 which authorized Kemmett and the others to construct the canal without any locks to avoid loss of water to the mills. The Act allowed two years for completion of the scheme, and although some progress had been made by April 1761, Kemmett was given an extension of six years at that time. After about [...] of river had been improved, the works were abandoned as being too costly.|$|E

[...] Bray concluded that a six-to-ten year restoration was needed to do a [...] "decent restoration". On June 1, 1984, a report was made for a $3.62 million dollar restoration spanning four years, from 1986-1989. On June 7, it was reported that an allocation for $1,013,100 for fiscal year 1985 for the restoration and a celebration marking its National Historic Landmark status followed the next day. The restoration however was delayed due to concerns with costs and staffing, but a recommendation to build a protective cover was implemented.

2500|$|When Louisiana {{became a}} state in 1812, the {{remaining}} territory was renamed Missouri Territory [...] to avoid confusion. Arkansas Territory, which included the present State of Arkansas plus {{most of the state}} of Oklahoma, was created out of the southern part of Missouri Territory in 1819. Originally the western border of Missouri was intended to extend due south to the Red River. However, during negotiations with the Choctaw in 1820, Andrew Jackson ceded more of Arkansas Territory to the Choctaw than he realized, resulting in a bend in the border between Arkansas and Oklahoma at Ft. Smith, Arkansas. The General Survey Act of 1824, allowed a survey that established the western border of Arkansas Territory well inside the present state of Oklahoma, where the Choctaw and Cherokee tribes had previously begun to settle. The two nations objected strongly, and in 1828 <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>survey</b> redefined the western Arkansas border.
