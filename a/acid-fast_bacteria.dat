40|$|In vivo {{growth of}} syngeneic tumour {{cells in the}} peritoneal cavity was {{strongly}} inhibited by intraperitoneal injection of a liposome-encapsulated, mycolic acid-containing glycolipid, trehalose 2, 3, 6 '-trimycolate (TTM), derived from a non-pathogenic, <b>acid-fast</b> <b>bacterium.</b> Gordona aurantiaca. Peritoneal macrophages from mice after this treatment lysed tumour cells in vitro at a low effector/target ratio, and their culture supernatant inhibited tumour cell growth. The supernatant inhibited growth of not only tumour necrosis factor (TNF) -sensitive tumour cells, but also TNF-insensitive tumour cells. This inhibitory activity was enhanced by addition of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) to the culture medium of the macrophages. The macrophages released more superoxide (O 2 -), TNF and interleukin- 1 (IL- 1) on LPS triggering, and the releases of these compounds were further increased by addition of recombinant interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) to the medium. Moreover, splenic T cells of TTM liposome-primed mice were found to produce eight times more IFN-gamma upon stimulation with LPS. These results indicated that priming with TTM liposomes resulted in strong activation of macrophages, which lysed tumour cells directly and also inhibited tumour cell growth by released factors...|$|R

40|$|To {{confirm or}} refute the {{proposed}} link between nocardiae and Parkinson’s disease (PD), we investigated {{the presence of}} acid-fast spherical structures similar to filterable nocardiae at the midbrain nigral lesions of three patients with PD.

These clusters were present in the vicinity of melanin-pigmented neurons in the three PD patients studied. Examination of adjacent hematoxylin-and-eosin-stained sections indicated that they consisted of yellow-green granules, bodies, and aggregates in ballooned glial cells. On the other hand, no clusters of acid-fast lipochrome bodies were observed at the compacta region of three control patients. Our results suggest that the immunological and genetic relationship between the acid-fast lipochrome bodies and filterable nocardiae should be investigated.

In addition to inhibiting microorganisms by itself, (+)-totarol exhibits inhibitory synergy with currently used antimicrobial drugs: (+)-totarol potentiates isonicotinic acid hydrazide against various Mycobactiera.; methicillin against Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Staphylococcus aureus; and anacardic acid and erythromycin against Staphylococcus aureus.

40|$|Bovine {{tuberculosis}} is {{a chronic}} bacterial disease of cattle that occasionally affects {{other species of}} mammals. This disease is a significant zoonosis that can spread to humans, typically by the inhalation of aerosols or the ingestion of unpasteurized milk. In developed countries, eradication programs have reduced or eliminated tuberculosis in cattle, and human disease is now rare; however, reservoirs in wildlife can make complete eradication difficult. Bovine tuberculosis is still common in less developed countries, and severe economic losses can occur from livestock deaths, chronic disease and trade restrictions.

40|$|Objective: Tuberculosis (TB) is a {{zoonotic}} {{infectious disease}} common to {{humans and animals}} that {{is caused by the}} rod-shaped <b>acid-fast</b> <b>bacterium</b> Mycobacterium bovis. Rapid and sensitive detection of TB is promoted by specific antigens. Virulent strains of the TB complex from M. bovis contain 16 regions of difference (RD) in their genome that encode important proteins, including major protein of Mycobacterium tuberculosis 64 (MBT- 64, which is a primary immune-stimulating antigen encoded by RD- 2. In this study, we cloned, expressed, and purified MPT- 64 as a potent M. bovis antigen in a prokaryotic system for use in future diagnostic studies. Methods: The antigenic region of the Mpt 64 gene was investigated by bioinformatics methods, cloned into the PQE- 30 plasmid, and expressed in Escherichia coli M 15 cells, followed by isopropyl β-d- 1 -thiogalactopyranoside induction. The expressed protein was analyzed sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and purified using a nickel-affinity column. Biological activity was confirmed by western blot using specific antibodies. Results: Our data verified the successful cloning of the Mpt 64 gene (687 -bp segment) via the expression vector and purification of recombinant MPT- 64 as a 24 -kDa protein. Conclusion: These results indicated successful expression and purification of recombinant MPT- 64 protein in a prokaryotic system. This protein can be used for serological diagnosis, improved detection of pathogenicity and non-pathogenicity between infected cattle, and for verification of suspected cases of bovine TB...|$|R

40|$|The {{occurrence}} of branching forms of <b>acid-fast</b> <b>bacteria</b> was first emphasized by {{the classification of}} this group of microor-ganisms by Lehmann and Neumann in 1896 in their family "Hyphomycetes " and genus "Mycobacterium.

These morphological studies were all made on organisms stained with carbol fuchsin. A minute accuracy is not possible under these conditions, since apparent branching may be due to a hazy outline of the cell boundaries; to capsular material staining con-tinuously with the cell wall; and to the destruction of stereo-rela-tionships so that it cannot be determined whether a cell lying at right angles to another cell is a branch on that cell or merely lying beside, underneath, or above it. Miehe (1909) was the first to watch <b>acid-fast</b> <b>bacteria</b> develop-ing in broth microcultures. He concluded that a saprophytic form, the "Ham " bacillus, did not branch, but that the human tubercle bacillus branched by budding, occasionally.

40|$|Objective/Background: Johne's disease, {{also called}} paratuberculosis, {{is a very}} {{important}} chronic infectious disease of ruminants worldwide. The causative agent is an <b>acid-fast</b> <b>bacterium,</b> Mycobacterium avium paratuberculosis (MAP). Finding a precise method for detecting MAP is essential for the control and eradication of this disease in small ruminant herds. Methods: In this study, appropriate samples were obtained from the ileum, cecum, colon, and mesenteric lymph nodes of 10 suspected naturally infected goats. Each sample was divided to two parts: the first part was stored at − 20 °C for bacteriologic culture and the second part was placed in 10 % neutral formalin for molecular and histopathologic examination. To isolate MAP, the double incubation method was used for decontaminating the tissues and Middlebrook 7 H 9 broth-based culture associated with OADC (oleic acid, albumin, dextrose, and catalase) supplement with/without mycobactin J were used. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR; IS 900) was performed for media with positive acid-fast staining. Results: Acid-fast staining was positive in 40 % of ileum samples, 50 % of cecum samples, 40 % of colon samples, and 50 % of lymph node samples with mycobactin J and in 60 % of ileum samples, 60 % of cecum samples, 40 % of colon samples, and 40 % of lymph node samples without mycobactin J. All samples were confirmed by IS 900 PCR assay. Diffuse granulomatous enteritis with multibacillary lesions and paucibacillary multifocal lymphadenitis associated with calcification were diagnosed histopathologically.

Results obtained by direct DST were compared with those obtained by indirect DST to establish accuracy and time sav-ings by this approach. Of a total of 360 AFB smear-positive sputum specimens set up for direct DST at four sites in three differ-ent countries, 307 (85 %) specimens yielded reportable results.
