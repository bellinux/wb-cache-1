The volume stress and particle radius conditions for cavitation can be calculated, giving the theoretical minimum particle radius for cavitation, useful for practical applications in rubber toughening.Typically cavitation will occur when the <b>average</b> <b>stress</b> on the rubber particles is between 10 and 20 megapascal. The volume strain on the particle is relieved and voiding occurs. The energy absorption due to this increase in volume is theoretically negligible. Instead, it is the consequent shear band formation that accounts for increased toughness. Before debonding, as the strain increases, the rubber phases is forced to stretch further strengthening the matrix. Debonding between the matrix and the rubber reduces the toughness, creating the need for strong adhesion between the polymer and rubber phases.|$|E

Two-dimensional stress trajectory topologies were generated {{for each of}} seven problems. The problems include: cantilever beam with shear end loading; two simply supported beams, one using the elasticity solution and an identical problem using the strength of materials solution; a disk under diametric compression; and a plate with a central stress free hole under equal biaxial, uniaxial and unequal biaxial loadings. The stress trajectory topologies were generated using MATLAB and the problems were simulated using Abaqus, a commercial finite element package. In each problem results from the stress trajectory topology were compared to other alternate topologies that came from random or uniform generation or from another problem. The {{purpose of this study}} was to determine if stress trajectory cellular topologies would reduce the maximum and <b>average</b> <b>stresses</b> in comparison to control and uniform topologies. It is believed that a topology aligned with the stress trajectories will carry and distribute the stresses better than a random topology which often has localized areas of high stress. In the beam and disk problems, the topology effect was investigated by comparing the stress trajectory topology to a uniform topology. In the plate problems, the effect of element size in the ST topologies as well as the effect of the topology was investigated. The effect of the size of the element was investigated by comparing three different ST topologies of various densities. The effect of the topology was investigated by comparing the medium stress trajectory topology to two random topologies and the medium topologies of other plate problems. For all cases it was found that stress trajectory topologies are better than other alternate topologies. The stress trajectory topology lowered the maximum and <b>average</b> <b>stresses</b> in the beam and disk problems. In the plate problems it was found that the size of the element has little effect as the maximum and <b>average</b> <b>stresses</b> were about the same.
