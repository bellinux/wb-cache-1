500|$|Flanagan {{promoted}} the Marngrook theory {{in his novel}} The Call (1996), an historical imagining into Wills' life, and argued in an essay addressed to Wills {{that he must have}} known Aboriginal games as it was in his nature to play: [...] "There's two things about you everybody seems to have agreed on—you'd drink with anyone and you'd play with anyone." [...] He quotes Lawton Wills Cooke, a descendent of Horace Wills (Tom's brother), who said a family story had been passed down <b>about</b> <b>Tom</b> playing Marngrook as a boy. Family historian T. S. Wills Cooke disputed that such a story existed, calling the Marngrook link [...] "a bridge too far" [...] and a politically correct attempt to rewrite hsitory. Despite a lack of hard evidence in its favour, the theory is often presented as factual. In Moyston, the self-proclaimed birthplace of Australian football, stands an AFL-endorsed monument, unveiled by historian Col Hutchinson, commemorating Wills' childhood in the area playing Marngrook.|$|E
500|$|In {{a review}} of South Park: The Complete Ninth Season, The Denver Post stated the jokes <b>about</b> <b>Tom</b> Cruise [...] "work splendidly and reveal their depth on {{repeated}} viewings, much like the show in general." [...] IGN stated that [...] "Perhaps the largest weakness of this season is that the most notorious episodes Best Friends Forever and Trapped in the Closet just don't carry the eye-popping impact that they did when they were ripped from the headlines", giving the DVD a rating of 7.0. The San Francisco Chronicle wrote that Matt Stone and Trey Parker [...] "probably hit their zenith when they made fun of Tom Cruise and Scientology". An article in The Times wrote that South Park [...] "infamously satirized" [...] texts by L. Ron Hubbard [...] "available only to Operating Thetans". TV Guide ranked the episode #17 on its 2009 list of [...] "TV's Top 100 Episodes of All Time".|$|E

Heinle has stated on many occasions that she had [...] "serious doubts" [...] about taking over Tom's role. In 2013, she recalled on what intimidated her <b>about</b> <b>Tom,</b> saying: [...] "Heather is pure backbone, and that's probably what intimidated me about following in her footsteps because that's not me naturally." [...] In 2008, she took maternity leave and was off-screen for weeks. In March 2011, Heinle announced that she had signed a new contract which would secure her in the role for an unspecified period.

500|$|The Daily Mirror {{described}} {{the program as}} [...] "far too funny". A review in The Daily Mirror was positive, commenting, [...] "If {{you want to see}} a brilliant spoof <b>about</b> <b>Tom</b> Cruise's faith in Scientology and his relationship with Katie Holmes, look no further than C4's Star Stories." [...] She commented, [...] "It's so absurd, even Tom will laugh." [...] The Advertiser described Star Stories as [...] "a surprisingly funny sendup of movie stars and pop groups", and noted of the episode's title, [...] "This week's episode is titled Being Tom Cruise [...] - How Scientology isn't in Any Way Mental, which should give you some idea of the vein of humour mined." [...] The Sunday Times observed, [...] "Just when you thought you might go a week without seeing a mention of brand Beckham, here is a documentary on their best friends, brand Tom Cruise, as recorded by the least reverential writers and least convincing lookalikes on the planet. Scientologists might prefer something on the Sci-fi channel." [...] Victoria Segal, Sally Kinnes and Sarah Dempster of The Sunday Times highlighted the episode in their [...] "Critics' Choice" [...] column. They commented that the show's producers [...] " [...] their own account of his career, his love life and his religion: It's all about aliens. Comedy so broad it barely fits on the screen, it is hard not to be amused". Cameron Adams of the Herald Sun highlighted the program as his [...] "Top Choice". Adams commented, [...] "This ruthless but spot-on parody re-enacts Cruise's life and career through Hollywood gossip, rumour and exaggeration (his father is a midget, Katie Holmes a robot, Nicole Kidman a beer-swilling bogan), but is an antidote to every interview he's ever done." [...] Writing for The Newcastle Herald, Anita Beaumont commented, [...] "This is really silly stuff, but it is amusing enough to enliven a fairly dull night of TV." [...] The Sunday Mirror wrote that the program [...] "was as subtle as a sledge hammer". Simon Hoggart of The Spectator called the program [...] "a magnificently over-the-top anti-celebrity festival".|$|E

2500|$|Tolkien says little <b>about</b> <b>Tom</b> Bombadil's origins, and he {{does not}} fit neatly into the {{categories}} of beings Tolkien created. Bombadil calls himself the [...] "Eldest" [...] and the [...] "Master". He claims to remember [...] "the first raindrop and the first acorn", and that he [...] "knew the dark under the stars when it was fearless—before the Dark Lord came from Outside". [...] When Frodo asks Goldberry just who Tom Bombadil is, she responds simply by saying [...] "He is", which some have taken as a reference to God's statement [...] "I Am that I Am" [...] in the Book of Exodus. But Tolkien rejected this notion, saying that in Middle Earth [...] "there is no embodiment of the One, of God, who indeed remains remote, outside the World", and he carefully differentiated Goldberry's response from the Biblical [...] "I Am that I Am". Others, such as Robert Foster, have suggested that Bombadil is one of the Ainur, angelic beings who shaped the earth: Foster's The Complete Guide to Middle Earth describes him as [...] "a Maia 'gone native'".|$|E
2500|$|Felix Felicis, more {{commonly}} known as Liquid Luck, grants whoever drinks it unusually good luck. The time span of this luck depends on the amount imbibed. Liquid Luck {{is one of the}} hardest potions to make, as noted by Horace Slughorn; [...] "It has to be cooked for 6 months on an extremely complicated formula, and if you make a tiniest mistake, the consequences are severe". Because of its properties, it is banned in all sporting events, competitions and examinations. In Rowling's original narrative, the potion looks akin to liquid gold. However, in the movie adaptation it is clear and water-like. Slughorn also noted that excessive consumption results in side effects that include giddiness and overzealousness, among other effects that are related to overconfidence. In Half-Blood Prince, Harry pretends to give some to Ron so that he will do well at Quidditch. Ron's luck turns for the better, with the confidence working as a placebo. Harry does use most of it later in the same novel in order to extract the true memory <b>about</b> <b>Tom</b> Riddle and Horcruxes from Slughorn (though it also has the pleasant side effect of causing Dean Thomas and Ginny Weasley to end their relationship), and the rest is shared between Ron, Hermione, Neville Longbottom and Ginny the night Death Eaters break into Hogwarts.|$|E
2500|$|The second {{return of}} Derrick Rose gave the Bulls and their fans {{optimism}} for the 2014–15 season. With 2-time NBA Champion Pau Gasol {{and a deep}} bench consisting of Taj Gibson, Nikola Mirotić, Tony Snell, Aaron Brooks, Doug McDermott, Kirk Hinrich, among others, the Bulls {{were one of the}} two favorite teams {{to come out of the}} Eastern Conference along with the Cleveland Cavaliers. The Bulls started off the season in style with a blowout win of the New York Knicks, and then winning 7 of their first 9 games (losses coming to the Cleveland Cavaliers and Boston Celtics). The emergence of Jimmy Butler as a primary scorer for the Bulls was a major surprise and he surged into the forefront of the [...] "Most Improved Player of the Year" [...] award race. Butler's statistical jump was noted by many as one of the greatest in NBA History, going from scoring just 13 points per game in 2013–14 to scoring 20 points per game in 2014–15. Pau Gasol was considered a huge asset for the Bulls and averaged a double-double throughout the season. Both Butler and Gasol ended up making the Eastern Conference All-Star team. The Bulls' second half of the season was marred by inconsistency and frustration set in with Derrick Rose blasting the team for not being on the same page. Tension between management and Tom Thibodeau continued to be a dark cloud hanging over the organization. The Bulls finished with a 50–32 record and the 3rd seed in the Eastern Conference. They faced the Milwaukee Bucks in the first round, and took advantage of the young and inexperienced Bucks by going up a quick 3–0 in the series. However, inconsistency and not being on the same page yet again plagued the Bulls as the Bucks won the next two games, sending a scare to Chicago. The Bulls bounced back with fury in Game 6 however, beating the Bucks by a playoff record 54 points winning the series 4–2. The next round saw the Bulls facing their arch-rival Cleveland Cavaliers, and their biggest nemesis, LeBron James, who had beaten the Bulls in all three of their previous playoff meetings. The Bulls shocked the Cavs in Game 1 dominating them and never trailing. The Cavs answered back in Game 2 in the same fashion, never trailing the entire game. In a pivotal Game 3 in Chicago, the Bulls and Cavs battled closely all the way through, but the Bulls prevailed on a last-second buzzer beating 3-pointer by Derrick Rose. In Game 4, the Cavs would answer once again, with LeBron James hitting the buzzer-beating shot to win the game. The Bulls lack of consistency and poor offensive showing doomed them once again as the Cavs won the next 2 games handily and closed out the series 4–2. After the series, speculation erupted <b>about</b> <b>Tom</b> Thibodeau's job security due to escalating feud between Thibodeau and Bulls front office managers Gar Forman and John Paxson.|$|E
