5|$|The {{ability of}} the {{tympanum}} and stapes to effectively transmit vibrations is called impedance matching. Early tetrapods like temnospondyls have thick stapes with poor impedance matching, so it is now {{thought that they were}} not used for hearing. Instead, these thick stapes may have functioned to support the tissue that covers the otic notch. Early temnospondyls, like Dendrerpeton, could not hear <b>airborne</b> <b>sound</b> but {{would have been able to}} detect vibration in the ground. Later temnospondyls like Doleserpeton had otic regions adapted to hearing. Doleserpeton has a structure in the inner ear called the perilymphatic duct, which is also seen in frogs and is associated with hearing. Its stapes is also a better transmitter of sound. The hearing system of Doleserpeton and related temnospondyls was able to detect <b>airborne</b> <b>sound</b> and may have been ancestral to that of living amphibians.|$|E
5|$|The {{transition}} from an aquatic, lobe-finned fish to an air-breathing amphibian {{was a significant}} and fundamental one in the evolutionary history of the vertebrates. For an organism {{to live in a}} gravity-neutral aqueous environment, then colonize one that requires an organism to support its entire weight and possess a mechanism to mitigate dehydration, required significant adaptations or exaptations within the overall body plan, both in form and in function. Eryops, an example of an animal that made such adaptations, refined many of the traits found in its fish ancestors. Sturdy limbs supported and transported its body while out of water. A thicker, stronger backbone prevented its body from sagging under its own weight. Also, through the reshaping of vestigial fish jaw bones, a rudimentary middle ear began developing to connect to the piscine inner ear, allowing Eryops to amplify, and so better sense, <b>airborne</b> <b>sound.</b>|$|E
25|$|Most labyrinthodonts {{had special}} sense organs in the skin, forming a lateral line organ for {{perception}} of water flow and pressure, like {{those found in}} fish {{and a number of}} modern amphibians. This would enable them to pick up the vibration of their prey and other waterborne sounds while hunting in murky, weed filled waters. Early labyrinthodont groups had massive stapes, likely primarily anchoring the brain case to the skull roof. It is a question of some doubt whether early terrestrial labyrinthodonts had the stapes connected to a tympanum covering their otic notch, and if they had an aerial sense of hearing at all. The tympanum in anurans and amniotes appear to have evolved separately, indicating most, if not all, Labyrinthodonts were unable to pick up <b>airborne</b> <b>sound.</b>|$|E
40|$|This study investigates how ground {{vibrations}} (underground <b>sounds)</b> and <b>airborne</b> <b>sounds</b> {{that are}} produced by rocks in a river bed differ from each other. <b>Airborne</b> and underground <b>sounds</b> were simultaneously received at three microphones and three geophones, respectively. These sound signals were then analyzed using both the Fast Fourier Transform and the Gabor Transform to represent them in both the frequency and time-frequency domains. Experimental data indicate that the frequency of both <b>airborne</b> and underground <b>sounds</b> produced by the impact of rocks against the river bed is in the range 10 – 150 Hz. Furthermore, the high-frequency band of underground sounds decays much more rapidly than that of <b>airborne</b> <b>sounds.</b> The spatial decay rate of <b>airborne</b> <b>sounds</b> was also determined and compared with theoretical values. The lower spatial decay rate of <b>airborne</b> <b>sounds</b> than that of underground sounds suggests that monitoring of <b>airborne</b> <b>sounds</b> may be more efficient in the detection of debris flows or other natural hazards that generate both <b>airborne</b> and underground <b>sounds...</b>|$|R

50|$|Cacops {{provides}} the oldest {{evidence of a}} tympanic membrane in terrestrial vertebrates. Among modern amniotes, sensory perception requires a specialized middle ear that collects airborne sounds through a tympanic membrane and delivers the vibrations to the inner ear via multiple structures, including the stapes. Thus, {{the discovery of a}} slender stapes in Cacops aspidephorus suggested that Cacops had an ability to hear <b>airborne</b> <b>sound.</b> The presence of a tympanum in contemporary amniotes is a difference between these terrestrial vertebrates that suggests these two groups had very different abilities to hear <b>airborne</b> <b>sound.</b> This type of hearing is important for both prey detection and intraspecific communication.|$|E

40|$|SYNOPSIS. The male prairie mole cricket, Gryllotalpa major, {{native of}} the tallgrass prairie of the south central U. S., {{constructs}} a specialized acoustical burrow in the spring in the prairie soil from which he generates an airborne calling song that attracts flying females for mating. Males do not phonorespond to manipulations involving playbacks of <b>airborne</b> <b>sounds.</b> At the same time, vibrations with the same temporal scale and pattern as the airborne signal are produced in the substrate through an unknown mechanism. These ground vibrations can be distinguished from background vibrations in the soil at distances up to 3 m depending on soil conditions and conditions that control the background vibration environment (e. g., wind, highway traffic). We hypothesize that males use the vibration component of the call as information for spacing as they form display arenas, or leks. We used modified field recordings of soil vibrations from singing males with an electrome-chanical vibration exciter to simulate the vibration component of a calling song in playback experiments. <b>Airborne</b> <b>sounds</b> of males were monitored for two minutes before and two minutes after {{the introduction of the}} ground vibration stimulus with a tape recorder microphone placed 20 cm from the burrow opening.

5000|$|It is {{generally}} thought that aposematic coloration {{is most effective}} in deterring predators when insects group together. Indeed, the most common mode of active defense among social caterpillars is aposematic display, often combined with synchronous body rearing, flicking, and “en masse” regurgitation of toxic or unpalatable chemicals. Studies indicate that [...] the spread of alarm through colonies of social caterpillars is mediated largely by tactile and, possibly, visual cues. Caterpillars can detect the <b>airborne</b> <b>sounds</b> generated by the beating wings of flying wasps and flies and respond with rapidly jerking movements.

5000|$|Documented {{cases of}} {{vibrational}} communication are almost exclusively restricted to Rayleigh waves or bending waves. Seismic {{energy in the}} form of Rayleigh waves transmits most efficiently between 10 and 40 Hz. This is the range in which elephants may communicate seismically. In areas with little to no human-generated seismic noise, frequencies around 20 Hz are relatively noise-free, other than vibrations associated with thunder or earth tremors, making it a reasonably quiet communication channel. Both airborne and vibrational waves are subject to interference and alteration from environmental factors. Factors such as wind and temperature influence <b>airborne</b> <b>sound</b> propagation, whereas propagation of seismic signals are affected by the substrate type and heterogeneity. <b>Airborne</b> <b>sound</b> waves spread spherically rather than cylindrically, attenuate more rapidly (losing 6 dB for every doubling of distance) than ground surface waves such as Rayleigh waves (3 dB loss for every doubling of distance), and thus ground surface waves maintain integrity longer.

40|$|Abstract—This paper formulates a new {{approach}} for ambigu-ous surface clutter suppression for ice sounding radars. While surface clutter from the non-orthogonal direction is reduced by means of Doppler and/or SAR processing, the residual surface contributions from across-track may still mask the reflection of internal layers and the bedrock, both coming from the nadir direction. The suggested approach involves several repeated acquisitions separated by certain baselines. It uses a geometry model to derive a synthesized sparse array diagram with adaptive nulls {{in the direction of}} the ambiguities. Initial performance evaluations for a P-band space-borne mission indicates that clutter can be suppressed by 30 - 40 dB.
