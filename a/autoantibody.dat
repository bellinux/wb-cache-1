25|$|The ANA test detects the autoantibodies {{present in}} an individual's blood serum. The common tests used for {{detecting}} and quantifying ANAs are indirect immunofluorescence and {{enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay}} (ELISA). In immunofluorescence, the level of autoantibodies is reported as a titre. This is the highest dilution of the serum at which autoantibodies are still detectable. Positive <b>autoantibody</b> titres at a dilution {{equal to or greater}} than 1:160 are usually considered as clinically significant. Positive titres of less than 1:160 are present in up to 20% of the healthy population, especially the elderly. Although positive titres of 1:160 or higher are strongly associated with autoimmune disorders, they are also found in 5% of healthy individuals. <b>Autoantibody</b> screening is useful in the diagnosis of autoimmune disorders and monitoring levels helps to predict the progression of disease. A positive ANA test is seldom useful if other clinical or laboratory data supporting a diagnosis are not present.|$|E

(TTP also can be a genetic disorder characterized by mutations in the ADAMTS13 gene leading to severe ADAMTS13 deficiency. This congenital cause of ADAMTS13 deficiency is called Upshaw-Schülman syndrome.) A lab test showing ADAMTS13 activity levels of ≤5% is indicative of TTP.|$|E

A significant number of patients are diagnosed as systemic lupus erythematosus or undifferentiated connective tissue disease largely based on a positive ANA. In case no defined <b>autoantibody</b> can be detected (e.g. anti-ENA antibodies), the testing of anti-DFS70 antibodies is recommended to verify the diagnosis. Anti-DFS70 antibody tests are available as CE-marked tests. Until now, no FDA cleared assay is available.|$|E
5000|$|The {{appearance}} of diabetes-related <b>autoantibodies</b> {{has been shown}} to be able to predict the {{appearance of}} diabetes type 1 before any hyperglycemia arises, the main ones being islet cell <b>autoantibodies,</b> insulin <b>autoantibodies,</b> <b>autoantibodies</b> targeting the 65-kDa isoform of glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD), <b>autoantibodies</b> targeting the phosphatase-related IA-2 molecule, and zinc transporter <b>autoantibodies</b> (ZnT8). By definition, the diagnosis of diabetes type 1 can be made first at the appearance of clinical symptoms and/or signs, but the emergence of <b>autoantibodies</b> may itself be termed [...] "latent autoimmune diabetes". Not everyone with <b>autoantibodies</b> progresses to diabetes type 1, but the risk increases with the number of antibody types, with three to four antibody types giving a risk of progressing to diabetes type 1 of 60%-100%. The time interval from emergence of <b>autoantibodies</b> to clinically diagnosable diabetes can be a few months in infants and young children, but in some people it may take years - in some cases more than 10 years.

40|$|Abstract BACKGROUND: We {{compared}} {{the prevalence of}} organ-specific <b>autoantibodies</b> {{in a group of}} Helicobacter pylori infected children and a group of uninfected children and investigated the relationship between the presence of relevant <b>autoantibodies</b> and the status of the target organs. PATIENTS AND METHODS: One hundred and twenty-four children with dyspepsia (54 boys, 70 girls; mean age 10. 5 years; range 4 - 19) underwent gastroscopy: 56 had H. pylori infection (31 girls, 25 boys), while 68 (37 girls and 31 boys), were H. pylori-negative. All sera were tested for the presence of: parietal cell <b>autoantibodies</b> (PCA), intrinsic factor <b>autoantibodies</b> (IFA), microsomial <b>autoantibodies,</b> thyroglobulin <b>autoantibodies,</b> islet cell <b>autoantibodies,</b> glutamic acid decarboxylase <b>autoantibodies,</b> adrenal cortex <b>autoantibodies,</b> steroid-producing cell autoantibodies; gastrin, pepsinogen A, pepsinogen C and anti-H. pylori antibodies. The histological features and the ureA and cagA genes were also considered. RESULTS: The frequency of organ-specific <b>autoantibodies</b> was higher in patients with H. pylori infection than in uninfected patients (chi 2 -test p <. 0001). Specifically gastric <b>autoantibodies</b> were significantly higher: seven of the 56 H. pylori-positive children were PCA-positive and one was IFA-positive (chi 2 -test p =. 0004). The presence of <b>autoantibodies</b> was not associated with any clinical or biohumoral signs of disease. CONCLUSIONS: Our study detected a relationship between H. pylori infection in childhood and the presence of organ-specific <b>autoantibodies</b> unassociated with any clinical or biohumoral signs of disease. Helicobacter pylori infection in childhood could trigger the onset of clinical autoimmune gastritis, and/or other clinical autoimmune diseases...|$|R

25|$|A puzzling {{feature of}} the {{documented}} loss of tolerance seen in spontaneous human autoimmunity {{is that it is}} almost entirely restricted to the <b>autoantibody</b> responses produced by B lymphocytes. Loss of tolerance by T cells has been extremely hard to demonstrate, and where there is evidence for an abnormal T cell response it is usually not to the antigen recognised by autoantibodies. Thus, in rheumatoid arthritis there are autoantibodies to IgG Fc but apparently no corresponding T cell response. In systemic lupus there are autoantibodies to DNA, which cannot evoke a T cell response, and limited evidence for T cell responses implicates nucleoprotein antigens. In Celiac disease there are autoantibodies to tissue transglutaminase but the T cell response is to the foreign protein gliadin. This disparity has led to the idea that human autoimmune disease is in most cases (with probable exceptions including type I diabetes) based on a loss of B cell tolerance which makes use of normal T cell responses to foreign antigens in a variety of aberrant ways.|$|E
25|$|Atypical {{hemolytic}} uremic syndrome (aHUS) is {{an extremely}} rare, life-threatening, progressive disease that frequently has a genetic component. In most cases it is caused by chronic, uncontrolled activation of the complement system, {{a branch of the}} body’s immune system that destroys and removes foreign particles. The disease affects both children and adults and is characterized by systemic thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA), the formation of blood clots in small blood vessels throughout the body, which can lead to stroke, heart attack, kidney failure, and death. The complement system activation may be due to mutations in the complement regulatory proteins (factor H, factor I, or membrane cofactor protein), or is occasionally due to acquired neutralizing <b>autoantibody</b> inhibitors of these complement system components, for example anti–factor H antibodies. Despite the use of supportive care, historically an estimated 33–40% of patients died or developed end-stage renal disease (ESRD) with the first clinical bout of aHUS. Including subsequent relapses, a total of approximately two-thirds (65%) of patients died, required dialysis, or had permanent renal damage within the first year after diagnosis despite plasma exchange or plasma infusion (PE/PI).|$|E

40|$|<b>Autoantibodies</b> play a {{key role}} in {{diagnostic}} laboratories as markers of autoimmune diseases. In addition to their role as markers they mediate diverse effects in vivo. <b>Autoantibodies</b> with protective effect have been described. Natural protective IgM <b>autoantibodies</b> against tumour-antigens of malignant cells or their precursors may contribute to increased survival rates of carcinoma patients. In a mouse model of systemic lupus erythematosus it has been shown that anti-dsDNA IgM <b>autoantibodies</b> protect from glomerular damage. In contrast, a direct pathogenic role of <b>autoantibodies</b> has been well established e. g. in myasthenia gravis or in Goodpasture syndrome. Similarly <b>autoantibodies</b> against SSA Ro 52 are detrimental in neonatal lupus erythematosus with congenital heart block. Moreover, putatively protective <b>autoantibodies</b> may become pathogenic during the course of the disease such as the onconeuronal <b>autoantibodies</b> whose pathogenicity depends on their compartmentalisation. In patients with paraneoplastic syndromes tumour cells express proteins that are also naturally present in the brain. Anti-tumour <b>autoantibodies</b> which temporarily suppress tumour growth can provoke an autoimmune attack on neurons once having crossed the blood-brain barrier and cause specific neurological symptoms. Only a restricted number of <b>autoantibodies</b> are useful follow-up markers for the effectiveness of treatment in autoimmune diseases.

The presented papers show that immunization against alloantigens is a principal factor for autoimmunization. Alloantibodies to RBC are 22 -fold more frequent in patients with <b>autoantibodies,</b> and alloimmunization explains <b>autoantibodies</b> in 81 % of these cases.
