5|$|It is {{possible}} that the age of fusion–evaporation reactions to produce superheavy elements {{is coming to an end}} due to the increasingly short half-lives to spontaneous fission and the looming proton drip line, so that new techniques such as nuclear transfer reactions (for example, firing uranium nuclei at each other <b>and</b> <b>letting</b> <b>them</b> exchange protons, potentially producing products with around 120 protons) would be required to reach the superactinides. On the other hand, many changes in techniques have been needed to synthesise transuranium elements, from neutron capture (until Z = 100) to light-ion bombardment (until Z = 110) to cold fusion (until Z = 113) and now hot fusion with 48Ca (until Z = 118), not to mention the essential difference before and after uranium between finding the elements chemically or spectroscopically in nature and synthesising them. In spite of this, the rate of discovery of new elements has remained at one every two and a half years on average for the past two and a half centuries.|$|E
5|$|The abdomen {{consists}} of ten segments and contains the gut and genital organs. The front eight segments have spiracles and the terminal segment is modified for reproduction. The male has {{a pair of}} clasping organs attached to a ring structure, and during copulation, a tubular structure is extruded and inserted into the female's vagina. A spermatophore is deposited in the female, following which the sperm {{make their way to}} a seminal receptacle where they are stored for later use. In both sexes, the genitalia are adorned with various spines, teeth, scales and bristles, which act to prevent the butterfly from mating with an insect of another species. After it emerges from its pupal stage, a butterfly cannot fly until the wings are unfolded. A newly emerged butterfly needs to spend some time inflating its wings with hemolymph <b>and</b> <b>letting</b> <b>them</b> dry, during which time it is extremely vulnerable to predators.|$|E
5|$|We {{all had a}} {{collective}} feeling like we'd had enough {{of this kind of}} shit. It wasn't anything tangible anybody said to anyone else, it was just kind of like everything over the years had come to a head on that one particular night in the one particular place, and it was not an organized demonstration... Everyone in the crowd felt that we were never going to go back. It was like the last straw. It was time to reclaim something that had always been taken from us.... All kinds of people, all different reasons, but mostly it was total outrage, anger, sorrow, everything combined, and everything just kind of ran its course. It was the police who were doing most of the destruction. We were really trying to get back in and break free. And we felt that we had freedom at last, or freedom to at least show that we demanded freedom. We weren't going to be walking meekly in the night <b>and</b> <b>letting</b> <b>them</b> shove us around—it's like standing your ground {{for the first time and}} in a really strong way, and that's what caught the police by surprise. There was something in the air, freedom a long time overdue, and we're going to fight for it. It took different forms, but the bottom line was, we weren't going to go away. And we didn't.|$|E

500|$|Shakespeare's Lady Macbeth {{appeared}} to be a composite of two personages found in the account of King Duff and in the account of King Duncan in Holinshed's Chronicles (1587). In the account of King Duff, one of his captains, Donwald, suffers the deaths of his kinsmen at the orders of the king. Donwald then considers regicide at [...] "the setting on of his wife", who [...] "showed him the means whereby he might soonest accomplish it." [...] Donwald abhors such an act, but perseveres at the nagging of his wife. After plying the king's servants with food and drink <b>and</b> <b>letting</b> <b>them</b> fall asleep, the couple admit their confederates to the king's room, where they then commit the regicide. The murder of Duff has its motivation in revenge rather than ambition.|$|E
500|$|Conan brought Schwarzenegger {{worldwide}} {{recognition as}} an action star and established {{the model for}} most of his film roles: [...] "icy, brawny, and inexpressiveyet somehow endearing." [...] The image of him as the barbarian was an enduring one; when he campaigned for George H. W. Bush to be president, he was introduced as [...] "Conan the Republican"a moniker that stuck with him throughout his political career and was often repeated by the media during his term as Governor of California. [...] Schwarzenegger was aware of the benefits the film had brought to him, acknowledging the role of Conan as [...] "God's gift to [...] career." [...] He embraced the image: when he was Governor of California, he displayed his copy of the Atlantean sword in his office, occasionally flourishing the weapon at visitors <b>and</b> <b>letting</b> <b>them</b> play with it. [...] More than once, he spiced up his speeches with Conan's [...] "crush your enemies, see them driven before you and hear the lamentations of their women".|$|E

500|$|Bloomberg View {{columnist}} William Pesek said: [...] "Japan's {{corporate culture}} of denial, of ignoring problems <b>and</b> <b>letting</b> <b>them</b> fester, keeps running {{up against a}} globalized world that values agility, innovation and transparency. Olympus demonstrates all too painfully how much Old Japan tolerates a lack of accountability among senior executives; inadequate disclosure; a disinclination to challenge authority and absolute deference to corporate boards regardless of share performance." [...] While he also observed that {{the independence of the}} directors was inadequate, he said Japanese executives were much more moderately paid compared to American ones. [...] "Shareholders assume directors are smart, devoted people working for the good of Japan Inc. Tough questions are rarely asked." [...] Errol Oh of The Star said a company apology for a fall in the share price [...] "trivialises the possible wrongdoings and misplaces emphasis on an effect rather than the cause ... Takayama's remark on the 'inconvenience' of a fall in share price reflects a common flaw in the mindset of the people who run listed companies. Somehow, they {{lose sight of the fact}} that they manage businesses, not share prices." ...|$|E
500|$|Bush's {{method of}} {{management}} at the OSRD was to direct overall policy, while delegating supervision of divisions to qualified colleagues <b>and</b> <b>letting</b> <b>them</b> do their jobs without interference. He attempted to interpret {{the mandate of the}} OSRD as narrowly as possible to avoid overtaxing his office and to prevent duplicating the efforts of other agencies. Bush would often ask: [...] "Will it help to win a war; this war?" [...] Other challenges involved obtaining adequate funds from the president and Congress and determining apportionment of research among government, academic, and industrial facilities. His most difficult problems, and also greatest successes, were keeping the confidence of the military, which distrusted the ability of civilians to observe security regulations and devise practical solutions, and opposing conscription of young scientists into the armed forces. This became especially difficult as the army's manpower crisis really began to bite in 1944. In all, the OSRD requested deferments for some 9,725 employees of OSRD contractors, of which all but 63 were granted. In his obituary, The New York Times described Bush as [...] "a master craftsman at steering around obstacles, whether they were technical or political or bull-headed generals and admirals." ...|$|E
500|$|The 100-page {{screenplay}} detailed plot {{developments and}} many of the visual traits, but very little dialogue was scripted, so the actors were asked to improvise their lines. Noé explained this approach: [...] "For me, directing actors is just finding the right people and putting them in the right mood on the set <b>and</b> <b>letting</b> <b>them</b> go. ... I think the energy has to come on the set at the very last minute." [...] Locations were used in Kabukichō and other parts of Shinjuku. Since much of the film was set in neighbourhoods known for gambling and prostitution, the producers made agreements with the Yakuza crime syndicates before filming some of the on-location scenes. Criminal organisations were not involved in the actual production. Studio scenes set in Tokyo were filmed at Toho Studios. More scenes than originally planned had to be filmed in the studio because of the many complicated crane arrangements. Some of the overhead sequences took a full day to arrange and film. The scenes where Oscar is alive were mostly shot on location, but the crane shots were exclusively taken in the studio; this included revisits to some of the previous locations, which were replicated as large indoor sets. Other shots were taken from helicopters flying over the city. Much attention was paid to the continuity of the geography, and filming was overseen by a supervisor from the visual-effects team.|$|E
