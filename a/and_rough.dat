5|$|Hurricane Florence {{produced}} strong swells {{and dangerous}} surf conditions {{along the northern}} Lesser Antilles, Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico, Hispaniola, and Bermuda. Later in its duration, the tight pressure gradient between Florence and a high-pressure system over southeastern Canada produced strong winds <b>and</b> <b>rough</b> waves along the East Coast of the United States. The hurricane also caused strong swells <b>and</b> <b>rough</b> ocean conditions, including rip currents, in the Bahamas and Atlantic Canada. In South Carolina, high waves produced severe beach erosion on several beaches.|$|E

40|$|SummaryCell {{adhesion}} {{is essential}} for morphogenesis; however, the mechanisms by which cell adhesion coordinates precisely regulated morphogenesis are poorly understood. Here we analyze the morphogenetic processes that organize the interommatidial precursor cells (IPCs) of the Drosophila pupal eye. We demonstrate that the Drosophila immunoglobulin superfamily members Hibris <b>and</b> <b>Roughest</b> are essential for IPC morphogenesis in the eye. The two loci are expressed in complementary cell types, <b>and</b> Hibris <b>and</b> <b>Roughest</b> proteins bind directly in vivo. Primary pigment cells employ Hibris to function as organizers in this process; IPCs minimize contacts with neighboring IPCs <b>and</b> utilize <b>Roughest</b> to maximize contacts with primaries. In addition, we provide evidence that interactions between Hibris <b>and</b> <b>Roughest</b> promote junction formation and that levels of Roughest in individual cells determine their capacity for competition. Our results demonstrate that preferential adhesion mediated by heterophilic interacting cell-adhesion molecules can create a precise pattern by minimizing surface free energy...|$|R

5|$|During an {{extended}} stay at Astor's, Irving met the explorer Benjamin Bonneville, who intrigued Irving with his maps and {{stories of the}} territories beyond the Rocky Mountains.

5|$|Four {{days prior}} to Vamei moving ashore, the Malaysian Meteorological Department (MetMalaysia) issued storm {{advisories}} for potentially affected areas.

5|$|October 9, 1990- Hurricane Klaus dissipates to {{the east}} of the state, though its {{remnants}} result in moderate winds throughout the state <b>and</b> <b>rough</b> seas in eastern Florida. Klaus causes beach erosion and heavy rain squalls, as well.|$|E
5|$|September 15, 1999- Once {{predicted}} {{to make a}} landfall on {{the state as a}} major hurricane, Hurricane Floyd parallels the eastern coastline about 115miles (185km) offshore.

5|$|Shortly {{after first}} developing, the {{government}} of Mexico issued a tropical storm warning from Salina Cruz to Acapulco, and later was extended to Zihuatanejo. Though the National Hurricane Center never forecast it to make landfall, one computer model predicted Carlotta to move ashore; due to the threat, the Mexican government also issued a hurricane watch from Puerto Angel to Zihuatanejo. Outer rainbands <b>and</b> <b>rough</b> surf affected the southwestern coast of Mexico for an extended duration; officials evacuated about 100families in potentially flooded areas of Acapulco as a precaution. Precipitation and clouds were reported in every Mexican state along the Pacific Ocean, resulting in flooding in some areas. No stations in Mexico reported sustained tropical storm force winds; however, Bahías de Huatulco International Airport in Oaxaca reported a wind gust of 44mph (71km/h). Heavy rainfall <b>and</b> <b>rough</b> seas were also reported on Socorro Island.|$|E
5|$|Shortly after forming, gale {{warnings}} {{were issued}} for Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, the Netherlands Antilles of the Leeward Islands, Saint Kitts and Nevis, and Anguilla. Klaus {{was the first}} tropical cyclone on record to hit the Leeward Islands from the west, {{and as a result}} many were unprepared for the strong winds <b>and</b> <b>rough</b> seas from the southwest.|$|E

5|$|There are two distinct, though connected, {{regions of}} ER that differ in {{structure}} and function: smooth ER <b>and</b> <b>rough</b> ER. The {{rough endoplasmic reticulum}} is so named because the cytoplasmic surface is covered with ribosomes, giving it a bumpy appearance when viewed through an electron microscope. The smooth ER appears smooth since its cytoplasmic surface lacks ribosomes.|$|E
30|$|The GaN-based LEDs with PQC {{structure}} on p-GaN surface <b>and</b> n-side <b>roughing</b> by nano-imprint lithography are fabricated and investigated.
