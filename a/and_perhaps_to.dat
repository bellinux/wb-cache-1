5|$|Manning's father spent {{weeks in}} late 2007 {{asking her to}} {{consider}} joining the Army. Hoping to gain a college education through the G.I. Bill, <b>and</b> <b>perhaps</b> <b>to</b> study for a PhD in physics, she enlisted in September that year. She told her Army supervisor later that she had also hoped joining such a masculine environment would resolve her gender identity disorder.|$|E
5|$|After Cnut's {{death in}} 1035 the English throne fell to Harold Harefoot, his son {{by his first}} wife, while Harthacnut, his son by Emma, became king in Denmark. England {{remained}} unstable. Alfred returned to England in 1036 to visit his mother <b>and</b> <b>perhaps</b> <b>to</b> challenge Harold as king. One story implicates Earl Godwin of Wessex in Alfred's subsequent death, but others blame Harold. Emma went into exile in Flanders until Harthacnut became king following Harold's death in 1040, and his half-brother Edward followed Harthacnut to England; Edward was proclaimed king after Harthacnut's death in June 1042.|$|E

He consecrated Herewald as Bishop of Llandaff at a council held at London in 1056, although this information is only attested in the Book of Llandaff, a sometimes unreliable source. In 1059 he, along with Earl Tostig and Æthelwine Bishop of Durham, escorted King Malcolm III of Scotland to King Edward's court at Gloucester when Malcolm came south, probably to thank Edward for his help in restoring Malcolm to the Scottish throne, <b>and</b> <b>perhaps</b> <b>to</b> acknowledge the English king as Malcolm's lord.|$|E

5|$|Gens and the Judenrat in {{the larger}} ghetto {{were aware of the}} executions in Ponary by the end of September 1941, when {{survivors}} began returning to the ghetto. The survivors, some of them wounded and all of them female, were mostly brought to Gens, <b>and</b> <b>perhaps</b> <b>to</b> the Judenrat, to whom they relayed their stories. Gens urged them to keep quiet, and some of the wounded were kept in the hospital to prevent them from repeating their stories. Knowledge of the massacres at Ponary became common in the ghetto by late December 1941 or early January 1942.|$|E
5|$|Constantine, son of Áed (Medieval Gaelic: Constantín mac Áeda; Modern Gaelic: Còiseam mac Aoidh, {{known in}} most modern regnal lists as Constantine II; died 952) {{was an early}} King of Scotland, known then by the Gaelic name Alba. The Kingdom of Alba, a name which first appears in Constantine's lifetime, was {{situated}} in modern day Scotland. The core of the kingdom was formed by the lands around the River Tay. Its southern limit was the River Forth, northwards it extended towards the Moray Firth <b>and</b> <b>perhaps</b> <b>to</b> Caithness, while its western limits are uncertain. Constantine's grandfather Kenneth I of Scotland (Cináed mac Ailpín, died 858) {{was the first of}} the family recorded as a king, but as king of the Picts. This change of title, from king of the Picts to king of Alba, is part of a broader transformation of Pictland and the origins of the Kingdom of Alba are traced to Constantine's lifetime.|$|E
5|$|In 1557 Pleydell {{was charged}} in the chamber by former {{associate}} John Berwick, who accused him of protecting two felons from punishment. The men (one convicted of murder and the other of abetting a theft) were Pleydell's servants {{in his capacity as}} chief ranger and keeper of Savernake Forest. Berwick, assumed by the historian Stanley Thomas Bindoff to be acting out of jealousy, was the previous holder of the titles and involved in a dispute with Pleydell over the rights to property near the forest. Pleydell enlisted the aid of serving and former members of parliament, including William Button, Henry Clifford, Griffith Curteys and John Hooper, in July. Their duty was to examine witnesses and evidence {{on both sides of the}} argument, and they presented a list of 240 articles concerning the servants' activities. Pleydell's efforts were seen by the court as an attempt to undermine the integrity of the Queen's justices <b>and,</b> <b>perhaps,</b> <b>to</b> incite rebellion among his supporters. This, in addition to breaching a commitment to meet regularly with the Privy Council under recognizance after his imprisonment, led to his indictment by Attorney-General Edward Griffin during the Michaelmas term. Pleydell was incarcerated in the Tower of London, forfeiting his two £500 bonds. He was released for good behaviour on 19 December, and left for the home of cloth merchant Thomas Garrard (a kinsman of the William Garrard with whom Pleydell served as Member for Wootton Bassett) after posting a £1,000 bond.|$|E

25|$|The Confederate privateers were {{privately owned}} ships that were {{authorized}} {{by the government of}} the Confederate States of America to attack the shipping of the United States.

25|$|In January 2006, AQI {{joined with}} several smaller Iraqi Sunni insurgent groups under an {{umbrella}} organisation called the Mujahideen Shura Council (MSC). According to counterterrorism researcher Brian Fishman, the merger {{was an attempt}} to give the group a more Iraqi flavour, <b>and</b> <b>perhaps</b> <b>to</b> distance al-Qaeda from some of al-Zarqawi's tactical errors, such as the 2005 bombings by AQI of three hotels in Amman. On 7 June 2006, a US airstrike killed al-Zarqawi, who was succeeded as leader of the group by the Egyptian militant Abu Ayyub al-Masri.|$|E
25|$|This species {{could be}} close to the white-tailed hawk (Buteo albicaudatus), <b>and</b> <b>perhaps</b> <b>to</b> the grey-backed (Leucopternis occidentalis), white (L. albicollis), and mantled hawks (L. polionotus) which it resembles in habitus except for being larger. Its closest living {{relatives}} may well be the red-backed (B. polyosoma) and Puna hawks (B. poecilochrous). Particularly some populations of the former look like small black-chested buzzard-eagles. The barred hawk (L. princeps) looks similar to the black-chested buzzard-eagle in general color pattern, though the tail differs much in shape, size, and the bright white central band stands out.|$|E
25|$|In 1912, a Palace revolt, plotted {{by young}} {{military}} officers, {{tried unsuccessfully to}} overthrow and replace the king.

25|$|Given the {{constant}} threat of bioterrorist related events, {{there is an}} urgent need to develop pulmonary protective and reparative agents {{that can be used}} by first responders in a mass casualty setting. Use in such a setting would require administration via a convenient route for e.g. intramuscular via epipens. Other feasible routes of administration could be inhalation <b>and</b> <b>perhaps</b> <b>to</b> a lesser extent oral – swallowing can be difficult in many forms of injury especially if accompanied by secretions or if victim is nauseous. A number of in vitro and in vivo models lend themselves to preclinical evaluation of novel pulmonary therapies.|$|E
25|$|Where cheek kissing is used, in some {{countries}} a single kiss is the custom, while in others a kiss on each cheek is the norm, or even three or four kisses on alternating cheeks. In the United States, an air kiss is becoming more common. This involves kissing in the air near the cheek, with the cheeks touching or not. After a first date, {{it is common for}} the couple to give each other a quick kiss on the cheek (or lips where that is the norm) on parting, to indicate that a good time was had <b>and</b> <b>perhaps</b> <b>to</b> indicate an interest in another meeting.|$|E
25|$|That same day, May 21, a {{detachment}} of the British Expeditionary Force under Major-General Harold Edward Franklyn had already attempted {{to at least}} delay the German offensive <b>and,</b> <b>perhaps,</b> <b>to</b> cut {{the leading edge of}} the German army off. The resulting Battle of Arras demonstrated the ability of the heavily armoured British Matilda tanks (the German 37mm anti-tank guns proved ineffective against them) and the limited raid overran two German regiments. The panic that resulted (the German commander at Arras, Erwin Rommel, reported being attacked by 'hundreds' of tanks, though there were only 58 at the battle) temporarily delayed the German offensive. German reinforcements pressed the British back to Vimy Ridge the following day.|$|E
