5|$|A solitary male {{purple-throated cotinga}} attracts a female by {{perching}} above the canopy <b>and</b> <b>letting</b> <b>the</b> sun highlight its iridescent plumage. The breeding behavior {{of this species}} is largely unknown, but the range in molting times implies that this species may breed year-round.|$|E
5|$|Little {{research}} has been done on this species, and not much is known about its ecology. The purple-throated cotinga is primarily frugivorous, although it does occasionally eat small insects. A solitary male attracts a female by perching in the canopy <b>and</b> <b>letting</b> <b>the</b> sunlight reflect off its iridescent feathers. It is suspected to breed year-round and is non-migratory. Despite being considered naturally uncommon or rare across its vast range, the purple-throated cotinga is listed as a species of Least Concern.|$|E
5|$|The Warden of the Fleet Prison, who {{was also}} keeper of Westminster Hall, was tasked with keeping it clean <b>and</b> <b>letting</b> <b>the</b> shops and booths along the sides. Despite acting as gaoler to the Exchequer of Pleas, Court of Chancery and Star Chamber {{as part of his}} duties the Warden was {{considered}} an officer of the Court of Common Pleas. All court officers were appointed for life, and could only be removed for misbehaviour. Despite this, the sheer number of positions meant that several came up for reappointment in each Chief Justice's tenure, and selling them could be very profitable.|$|E

5|$|Gravel {{actively}} {{campaigned for}} the office of Vice President of the United States during the 1972 presidential election, announcing on June 2, 1972, over a month before the 1972 Democratic National Convention began, that he was interested in running for the nomination should the choice be opened up to convention delegates. Towards this end he began soliciting delegates for their support in advance of the convention. He was not alone in this effort, as former Governor of Massachusetts Endicott Peabody had been running a quixotic campaign for the same post since the prior year. Likely presidential nominee George McGovern was in fact considering the unusual move of naming three or four acceptable vice-presidential candidates <b>and</b> <b>letting</b> <b>the</b> delegates choose.|$|E
5|$|On October27, 1934, the Meadowbrook and Lido Beach Loop causeways {{were opened}} to {{vehicular}} traffic by LISPC. A motorcade of cars was led across the new roadways by Robert Moses, then a Republican Party candidate for Governor of New York. The event {{was preceded by}} parades in Freeport and Rockville Centre. During a speech Moses cited praises to the Reconstruction Finance Corporation for donating the money <b>and</b> <b>letting</b> <b>the</b> LISPC and Jones Beach State Parkway Authority do the work without interference. Other speakers that afternoon praised Moses and the LISPC, and New York City Mayor Fiorello La Guardia showed up late to give his congratulations. Despite the opening ceremony, two-way traffic was not permitted on the Meadowbrook between the Southern State and Merrick Road until June1, 1935. Prior to that time, motorists {{had to use the}} renamed Wantagh Causeway to access Jones Beach.|$|E
5|$|When Queen Beatrix succeeded {{her mother}} Juliana on the latter's abdication on 30 April 1980, the new queen {{decided to keep}} the holiday on 30 April {{as a tribute to}} her mother. (If 30 April fell on a Sunday, Koninginnedag was {{observed}} the previous day—this occurred most recently in 2006.) The reason was practical as well—Beatrix's actual birthday on 31 January would have been less conducive to the traditional outdoor activities. Rather than remaining at the palace <b>and</b> <b>letting</b> <b>the</b> Dutch people come to her, Beatrix instead usually visited two towns each year for Koninginnedag celebrations. Local crafts and customs were demonstrated for the royal family, who had the opportunity to join in.|$|E

25|$|Umm Ra's (أم رأس): This {{final stage}} of {{ripening}} is also called Rutab (رطب). The fruits are turning brown from their end towards the perianth. The Manasir never cut the whole fruit bunch called Shakhlub (شخلوب) but only single spikelets, with the result of thinning out the clusters <b>and</b> <b>letting</b> <b>the</b> remaining fruits gain in size.|$|E
25|$|The game is {{also very}} common in the {{southwest}} counties of Cornwall, Devon, Dorset. In Dorset some games are played by bowling a technique known as the 'Dorset flop'. This is where the bowler crouches on the alley and throws himself and the ball forward landing on his stomach <b>and</b> <b>letting</b> <b>the</b> ball go between two bowling lines. In some parts of Somerset the ball has to hit a pitch plate (a diamond painted on the alley) in order {{for it to be}} a legal ball. It is also popular in South Wales.|$|E
25|$|For {{the lower}} basses {{it takes a}} lot more control to turn quickly. Cleaning turns for a bassline can be rather easy. They should lead with the {{shoulder}} {{at the start of the}} turn and lock the other direction on a specified count. Setting a check-point can help. For instance, one should be flat front on count two of the turn. However, note that the turn should be smooth and not jerky. A common problem may result from not stopping the weight of the drum at the end of the turn <b>and</b> <b>letting</b> <b>the</b> momentum get the better of the player. The solution to that problem involves tightening the core (abdominals and back muscles).|$|E

25|$|Landlords were {{responsible}} for paying the rates of every tenant whose yearly rent was £4 or less. Landlords whose land was crowded with poorer tenants were now faced with large bills. Many began clearing the poor tenants from their small plots, <b>and</b> <b>letting</b> <b>the</b> land in larger plots for over £4 which then reduced their debts. In 1846, {{there had been some}} clearances, but the great mass of evictions came in 1847. According to James S. Donnelly, Jr., it is impossible to be sure how many people were evicted during the years of the famine and its immediate aftermath. It was only in 1849 that the police began to keep a count, and they recorded a total of almost 250,000 persons as officially evicted between 1849 and 1854.|$|E
25|$|Epítome {{reports the}} young boys called moxas, {{taken from a}} place called Casa del Sol at thirty leguas from the New Kingdom. They are carried on the {{shoulders}} and stay seven to {{eight years in the}} temples to be sacrificed afterwards. The process is described as cutting their heads off <b>and</b> <b>letting</b> <b>the</b> blood flow over the sacred sites. The boys have to be virgins, as if they are not, their blood is not considered pure enough to serve as sacrifice. Before going to war, the guecha warriors are described to stay one month in a temple, with people outside singing and dancing and the Muisca honouring Sué and Chía. The warriors sleep and eat little during this time. After the battles, the people perform the same ritual for various days and when the warriors are defeated, they also do this to lament the losses.|$|E
25|$|The rooms {{within the}} {{elongation}} are accessed through a 48-foot long, 6-foot wide gallery. The gallery is enclosed in its full length {{through the use}} of an original row of wooden balustrade, supporting operable wooden transoms, movable wooden louvers and wooden shutters, simultaneously providing shade and air, two important local design considerations, as Ponce is known for its hot weather and its implacable sun. Another significant design in Casa Vives related to Ponce's climate is the treatment given to the air circulation within the living quarters. The house has high ceilings, ranging from 14 to 15 feet, to give hot air more space to rise. Adorned ventilation holes are strategically located at the four corners of every room's ceiling, allowing for the heat to exit through the roof <b>and</b> <b>letting</b> <b>the</b> cool air circulate throughout the entire house. The fresh air is captured at the roof through a set of brick and masonry ventilation structures, oriented in an east-to-west direction (the usual direction of the wind currents), and channelized to the house interior. Every single room in the house connects to the adjacent room through wooden double doors (some with louvers and shutters, other of solid construction), allowing air to circulate from one space to another. Furthermore, many of the interior doors are crowned with wooden transoms, facilitating the air conduit even with the doors closed. In addition, every single room has, at least, one wooden double door that open toward the exterior.|$|E
