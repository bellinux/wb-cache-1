5|$|This {{pay raise}} {{proposal}} was submitted as {{an amendment to}} the government's general appropriations bill. Had Grant vetoed the bill, the government would not have <b>any</b> <b>money</b> to operate for the following fiscal year, which would have necessitated a special session of Congress. However, Grant missed an opportunity to make a statement by threatening a veto.|$|E
5|$|Diageo {{maintained}} {{ownership of}} BK until 2000 when Diageo {{decided to focus}} solely on their beverage products and divest itself of the chain. In 2001, the company put forth a plan to float approximately 20 percent of BKC on the NYSE. Burger King's franchises representation group, The National Franchise Association (NFA), sought to block this because it believed that <b>any</b> <b>money</b> raised from the issue would not be put into helping bolster the then flagging BK, but would instead end up being used to help Diageo bolster its liquor brands.|$|E

The college states {{that it does not}} accept <b>any</b> <b>money</b> from the government or any other source that includes terms that supersede the authority of its Board of Trustees or conflict with its foundational statements. PHC adds new facilities and programs only as funds are available. The Home School Legal Defense Association is one of the primary benefactors of the school, and all members of the association receive a $1300 grant if they are accepted as students.|$|E
5|$|Treating. Treating is {{the act of}} corruptly giving or providing, or paying {{in whole}} or part for, any food, drink, refreshment, cigarette, {{entertainment}} or other thing, or <b>any</b> <b>money</b> or ticket or other means to enable such things to be obtained, in order to corruptly influence a person to vote or refrain from voting, or to induce the person to attend an election meeting, or to reward him for having done so. The penalty is a fine of up to $5,000 or imprisonment not exceeding three years or both, and the disqualifications referred to above.|$|E
5|$|A {{speculator}} to {{his very}} core, Little never put away {{any of his}} fortune {{to prepare for a}} rainy day; <b>any</b> <b>money</b> he made on the stock market, he immediately invested back into it. Thus when the Panic of 1857 destroyed his investment fortune, Little was left penniless. He would live out {{the rest of his life}} under the wing of his last protége, David Groesbeck. Little was only ever able to make small trading returns to the market in his later years, and the magnitude of his fall was often the target of mockery from his former peers. He died a broken man. Little died on March 28, 1865, and his funeral was held on March 31 at New York's Grace Church. His pall-bearers included Jesse Hoyt and Edward Prime; Reverend Thomas House Taylor officiated at his funeral.|$|E

50|$|Financing {{terms are}} {{sensitive}} to the credit rating of the carrier holding the financed policy. Carrier downgrades may result in the lender choosing to not pay additional premiums, requiring the borrower to post additional collateral or call the loan and collapse all the collateral to cover <b>any</b> <b>moneys</b> due to the Lender. Most premium finance platforms require carriers to be S&P rated A or greater.|$|R
5|$|According to Josiffe's account, a {{homosexual}} liaison with Thorpe began that same evening, at Thorpe's mother's home in Oxted, and continued for several years. Thorpe, while acknowledging that a friendship developed, denied any sexual dimension in the relationship. He organised accommodation for Josiffe in London, and a longer-term {{stay with a}} family in Barnstaple, within the North Devon constituency. He paid for advertisements in Country Life magazine, {{in an effort to}} find work with horses for his friend, arranged various temporary jobs, and promised to help Josiffe to realise an ambition to study dressage in France. On the basis of Josiffe's claim that his father had died in an air crash, Thorpe's solicitors investigated whether <b>any</b> <b>money</b> was due, but found that Albert Josiffe was alive and well in Orpington.|$|E
5|$|As news spread, {{other banks}} and trust {{companies}} {{were reluctant to}} lend <b>any</b> <b>money.</b> The {{interest rates on loans}} to brokers at the stock exchange soared to 70% and, with brokers unable to get money, stock prices fell to a low not seen since December 1900. The panic quickly spread to two other large trusts, Trust Company of America and Lincoln Trust Company. By Thursday, October 24, a chain of failures littered the street: Twelfth Ward Bank, Empire City Savings Bank, Hamilton Bank of New York, First National Bank of Brooklyn, International Trust Company of New York, Williamsburg Trust Company of Brooklyn, Borough Bank of Brooklyn, Jenkins Trust Company of Brooklyn and the Union Trust Company of Providence.|$|E
5|$|At the prom, Artie and Marge are voted prom {{king and}} queen, {{and the two}} share the first dance. Meanwhile, Homer, heartbroken, leaves and cries in the hallway. After the prom, Artie tries to get romantic with Marge in the {{backseat}} of his car: after he pushes his luck too far, she slaps him and demands to be taken home. Meanwhile, Homer's limousine time has run out, and without <b>any</b> <b>money,</b> he decides to walk home. Along the way Marge and Artie pass by Homer. After Artie drops Marge off at her house, she returns in her car to pick up Homer, realizing that he was the man for her all along. Homer manages to fix up the strap of Marge's dress with the corsage that he got her after Artie ruined it from his earlier attempt.|$|E

5|$|Beginning in 2003, Laurer had {{a tumultuous}} {{relationship}} with fellow wrestler Sean Waltman. They were engaged {{for a period}} in 2003, then broke up, and then became engaged again, a pattern that continued {{for the next two}} years. In 2004, Laurer and Waltman made a sex tape. Eager for a repeat success, the company that released Paris Hilton's celebrity sex tape obtained the footage, edited it, and released it under the name 1 Night in China. The video sold over 100,000 copies, with both Laurer and Waltman earning a share of the profits. Laurer, however, maintained that she did not earn <b>any</b> <b>money</b> from the release. In January 2005, Laurer was arrested for domestic assault after allegedly beating Waltman.|$|E
5|$|Guido Forti {{alleged that}} Shannon Racing had not paid him <b>any</b> <b>money</b> within the stipulated six-day {{deadline}} after {{the deal was}} concluded and refuted the claim that it now owned 51% of his team. As the team ran out of money, it was doubtful whether it would turn up at the British GP. In the end, Forti took part, only for the cars to complete a mere handful of laps each in practice and thus failing to set a time quick enough to qualify. This was because it was becoming increasingly in debt to Cosworth and {{was running out of}} engine mileage for its cars, only having enough to make a token effort at participation. The team made it to the next race - the German GP - but both cars remained unassembled in the pit garages throughout the weekend after the engine supply was finally cut off.|$|E
5|$|Halperin {{cautioned that}} Austen often satirised popular sentimental romantic fiction in her letters, {{and some of}} the {{statements}} about Lefroy may have been ironic. However, it is clear that Austen was genuinely attracted to Lefroy and subsequently none of her other suitors ever quite measured up to him. The Lefroy family intervened and sent him away at the end of January. Marriage was impractical, as both Lefroy and Austen must have known. Neither had <b>any</b> <b>money,</b> and he was dependent on a great-uncle in Ireland to finance his education and establish his legal career. If Tom Lefroy later visited Hampshire, he was carefully kept away from the Austens, and Jane Austen never saw him again. In November 1798, Lefroy was still on Austen's mind as she wrote to her sister she had tea with one of his relatives, wanted desperately to ask about him, but could not bring herself to raise the subject.|$|E

5|$|Hearings into Teapot Dome {{began in}} October 1923, after Harding's death. Fall had left office earlier that year, but he denied {{receiving}} <b>any</b> <b>money</b> from Sinclair or Doheny; Sinclair agreed. The following month, Walsh learned that Fall had spent lavishly on expanding and improving his New Mexico ranch. Fall reappeared {{and stated that}} the money had come as a loan from Harding's friend and The Washington Post publisher Edward B. McLean, but McLean denied it when he testified. Doheny told the committee that he had given Fall the money in cash as a personal loan out of regard for their past association, but Fall invoked the Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination when he was compelled to appear again, rather than answer questions.|$|E
5|$|In 1913, Louisville Public Schools {{announced}} {{a plan to}} merge Manual and its rival Male High School into Louisville Boys High so that the two schools could share a new $300,000 facility. The plan took effect in 1915. Industrial training classes continued at the old Manual building. Parents objected to their children having to travel between the two buildings and the consolidation did not save the school board <b>any</b> <b>money,</b> so they voted to end the experiment in 1919. The new building became Male's home for the next 70 years and Manual returned to its old building at Brook and Oak. In 1923 an expansion added new laboratories, a cafeteria, and the largest gym ever built in Louisville at the time. The addition eventually burned {{and had to be}} destroyed in 1991.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to her deputy leadership role, Lamont was appointed Chief of Staff with special responsibility for Equalities. While in that post she gave her support to Scottish Government plans to introduce a Bill outlawing forced marriage, which was announced in September 2010. In February 2011, she criticised Scottish Conservative MSP and Justice Committee Convener, Bill Aitken after the Sunday Herald quoted him making a controversial statement about a rape victim, and later welcomed his subsequent resignation. As Gray's deputy Lamont also represented Labour at First Minister's Questions in his absence. At a session of First Minister's Questions in October 2009, she {{raised the issue of}} the Scottish Futures Trust with Deputy First Minister Nicola Sturgeon, asking whether the public body planned to spend <b>any</b> <b>money</b> on improving school infrastructure before the 2011 election.|$|E

5|$|In the United States, {{approximately}} 90 {{percent of}} Burger King's franchises have {{banded together to}} form the Burger King National Franchise Association (BKNFA or NFA). The 900-member group is based in Atlanta, Georgia, and {{is designed to provide}} what the group calls Franchisee Relations Advocacy. It acts as a corporate negotiator that mediates with corporate-franchise disputes, as a government lobbying group to deal with issues that affect the fast-food industry as a whole, and it provides group health, property and casualty insurance. In 2001, the group announced a plan to purchase Burger King from then-parent Diageo after the company put forth a plan to float approximately 20 percent of BKC on the NYSE. The NFA believed that <b>any</b> <b>money</b> raised from the issue would not be put into helping bolster the then flagging BK, but would instead end up being used to help Diageo bolster its liquor brands. The deal collapsed when the NFA was unable to put together an acceptable financing package.|$|E
5|$|On Fernando Po itself, Richard Lippett, who had {{remained}} on the island, was taken in for questioning by the Spanish authorities on 17 January 1942. He managed to persuade them he had {{had nothing to do}} with the departure of the ships, nor had he spent <b>any</b> <b>money</b> on the party for the ships' officers. He was released from custody on 27 January 1942, but was refused permission to leave the island. He finally left secretly by canoe, arriving in British territory on 1 March 1942. In the aftermath of the operation, Maid Honor was left in Lagos and eventually sold to the Sierra Leone government as a converted trawler. Duchess d'Aosta was sailed to Greenock and then managed by Canadian Pacific as the Empire Yukon for the Ministry of War Transport. Limkomba was managed by the Elder Dempster Lines, who renamed it Malakel in 1947 and then sold it to Liberia in 1948.|$|E

Laos stated that Van der Sloot did not win <b>any</b> <b>money</b> that night. At 3:00a.m. on 30 May, Flores was recorded entering the casino alone and walking to a poker table where Van der Sloot was sitting. Van der Sloot had not registered for the Latin American Poker Tour.
