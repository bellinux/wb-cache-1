50|$|In 1893, Slattery {{installed}} {{gas lighting}} fixtures with incandescent burners {{into the study}} halls, almost one year before these became available in Australia. In 1895, the college acquired a gasoline powered engine, a six-inch (15 cm) sparking coil and two Crookes tubes. That same year the school upgraded to an oil powered engine, dynamo and storage batteries that supplied electric light to the science halls. At the time {{this was the only}} electric light in Bathurst. Next Slattery built an <b>acetylene</b> <b>gas</b> powered <b>generator</b> to provide stage lighting for the college theater. At this time he developed an early interest in color photography.|$|R
25|$|The {{earliest}} bicycle lamps were oil-powered {{and started}} to be manufactured in 1876 for the Ordinary (High-Bicycle) and solid-tired tricycles. From 1896 <b>acetylene</b> <b>gas</b> lighting for bicycles started to be introduced and later in 1899 <b>acetylene</b> <b>gas</b> lamps for the motor-car became popular. Their carbide lamps were powered by <b>acetylene</b> <b>gas,</b> produced by combining calcium carbide with water. The light given was very bright but the lamps required regular maintenance.|$|R

40|$|Effects of {{the oxygen}} ion beam etching of ion beam {{synthesized}} {{diamond like carbon}} (DLC) films were investigated in present study. The etching rates as well as contact angle with water and surface morphology {{before and after the}} oxygen ion beam treatment were studied. “Conventional ” hydrogenated diamond like carbon (DLC) films were synthesized from <b>acetylene</b> <b>gas,</b> while silicon and SiOx doped DLC films were deposited from hexamethyldisiloxane vapor and <b>acetylene</b> <b>gas</b> mixture, and hexamethyldisiloxane vapor and hydrogen gas mixture respectively. In all cases ion beam etching resulted in flat smooth surfaces. Etching rate of the “conventional ” DLC films synthesized from acetylene and DLC films deposited from hexamethyldisiloxane vapor and <b>acetylene</b> <b>gas</b> mixture was 44 nm/min and 29 nm/min respectively. Thickness of the SiOx doped DLC film synthesized from hexamethyldisiloxane vapor and <b>acetylene</b> <b>gas</b> mixture slightly increased {{as a result of the}} oxygen ion beam treatment.

Contact angle with water of SiOx doped DLC films after the oxygen ion beam treatment was similar to the contact angle with water of the silicon dioxide.
