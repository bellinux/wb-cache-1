5|$|Brazil's {{involvement}} in the Uruguayan civil war also began to deepen. Luis Alves de Lima e Silva, the Count of Caxias, assumed the presidency (governorship) of Rio Grande do Sul and the command of the four Brazilian Army divisions headquartered in the province.

On 16 March 1851, the Empire of Brazil openly declared its support of Colorado government of Uruguay against Oribe, something it had been covertly doing for more than two years.

5|$|Iron mining {{occurred}} in several locations, including the main English centre in the Forest of Dean, {{as well as}} in Durham and the Weald. Some iron to meet English demand was also imported from the continent, especially by the late 13th century. By the end of the 12th century, the older method of acquiring iron ore through strip mining was being supplemented by more advanced techniques, including tunnels, trenches and bell-pits. Iron ore was usually locally processed at a bloomery, and by the 14th century the first water-powered iron forge in England was built at Chingley. As a result of the diminishing woodlands and consequent increases in the cost of both wood and charcoal, demand for coal increased in the 12th century <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>began</b> to be commercially produced from bell-pits and strip mining.|$|E
5|$|In 1973, Robert Foehl {{died and}} Evelyn Foehl sold {{the hotel to}} Ramada, a hotel chain. The Ramada {{managers}} remodeled the hotel, stripping out and covering {{much of what they}} considered an outdated interior. The hotel was named Ramada Valley Ho. Though it remained a fashionable location for a while, its original character was largely absent <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>began</b> to suffer from neglect and disrepair. It continued to host conferences and business meetings, such as the Natural Health, Aromatherapy and Herb Conference & Trade Show in early 2000, and the Arizona LANBasher's League party in early 2001. Later that year, the hotel closed and was put on the market. Plans for its demolition were considered when no offers were made. To protect it, Alan Hess wrote a letter detailing its importance, and a successful campaign was mounted in Scottsdale to place it on the Scottsdale Historic Register in recognition of its significance to city history and its architectural connection to the past. To save it from demolition, business partners Scott Lyon and Bill Nassikas of Westroc Hotels & Resorts bought the property and undertook an extensive renovation and building addition that eventually cost $80M. Evelyn Foehl died in August 2003, two years after the hotel was closed for renovation.|$|E

5|$|Most of the burghs were on {{the east}} coast, and among them were the largest and wealthiest, {{including}} Aberdeen, Perth and Edinburgh, whose growth was facilitated by trade with the continent. Although in the southwest Glasgow was beginning to develop and Ayr and Kirkcudbright had occasional links with Spain and France, sea trade with Ireland was much less profitable. In addition to the major royal burghs this era saw the proliferation of lesser baronial and ecclesiastical burghs, with 51 being created between 1450 and 1516. Most of these were much smaller than their royal counterparts; excluded from international trade, they mainly acted as local markets and centres of craftsmanship. In general burghs probably carried out far more local trading with their hinterlands, relying on them for food and raw materials. The wool trade was a major export {{at the beginning of}} the period, but the introduction of sheep-scab was a serious blow to the trade <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>began</b> to decline as an export from the early 15th century and despite a levelling off, there was another drop in exports as the markets collapsed in the early-16th century Low Countries. Unlike in England, this did not prompt the Scots to turn to large scale cloth production and only poor quality rough cloths seem to have been significant.|$|E
5|$|On February21, Météo-France {{began to}} issue {{advisories}} on Tropical Disturbance Ex-Hondo which presented a well-defined circulation. Later that day, deep convection redeveloped around the center as the low entered an area favorable for development. At 0830UTC, the JTWC issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert, stating that Hondo {{was likely to}} regenerate into a tropical cyclone. Later that day, Hondo became almost stationary and was upgraded to a tropical depression as it continued to develop. The next day, Hondo was downgraded to a tropical disturbance as wind shear constrained convective development and caused the system to weaken. However, early on February23, the JTWC began issuing advisories on Hondo as they estimated winds to have reached 65km/h (40mph) once more. At 0600UTC, Hondo attained winds of 95km/h (60mph 1-minute winds) near Mauritius and Réunion. Due to the proximity to the islands, convection associated with the storm became disorganized <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>began</b> to weaken. The JTWC issued their final advisory early on February24 as the system significantly weakened, with the center devoid of convection. Météo-France issued their final advisory several hours later. The remnants of Hondo persisted for another five days, executing a counterclockwise loop before dissipating on February29.|$|E
5|$|The New Zealand Division was {{temporarily}} relieved and to cover its replacement by the US Fifth Army, BSquadron {{was attached to}} the 4th New Zealand Infantry Brigade, C Squadron to the 5th New Zealand Infantry and A Squadron to the 6th New Zealand Infantry. On the morning of 11 August, C Squadron supported the 23rd Battalion advance from Emboli to the Arno River. B Squadron was positioned in San Vito and A Squadron behind the Pesa River. The regiment withdrew to the divisional area near Castellina on 16 August, moving with the division to Iesi on the Adriatic. Arriving on 29 August, it was transferred to Fano on 5 September. The regiment moved back into the line on 22 September at Rimini, advancing along Route 16 towards Ravenna. On 29 September, all armoured cars were recalled due to heavy rain and poor visibility.

5|$|The cyclone's 1-minute winds {{increased}} {{once again}} to 140km/h, marking its second and final peak at 0000 UTC on November 18. The JMA, however, maintained Nepartak as a severe tropical storm. The JTWC indicated that 25W made a second landfall {{on the coast of}} Hainan, although the JMA did not make such mention, implying Nepartak's center remained over the Gulf of Tonkin. Regardless, the cyclone's circulation had obscured most of Hainan and the Gulf of Tonkin and reached into adjacent Vietnam, and its forward speed slowed to a crawl. Extended interaction with land proved detrimental to the storm, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>began</b> to rapidly disintegrate. Just 18 hours after its final bout of strengthening, Nepartak had been reduced to an exposed circulation center with no associated thunderstorms. Turning toward the northeast, the system had been concurrently downgraded to a tropical depression by the JTWC and JMA early on November 19. The weak remnant low of Nepartak limped ashore over Beihai, China at 1900 UTC and dissipated shortly thereafter.|$|E
5|$|The {{depression}} tracked west to west-northwest upon classification, steered by a mid-level ridge centered {{over the}} southwestern United States. Deep convection increased in coverage and intensity {{over the following}} hours, leading {{to an increase in}} satellite intensity estimates; at 0600UTC, the depression was upgraded to Tropical Storm Flossie. Within an environment of low wind shear and warm sea surface temperatures, Flossie gradually intensified over the next two days; a mid-level eye became observable in microwave imagery and intermittently on visible satellite imagery by early on July27. At 1200UTC, the system attained its peak intensity with maximum sustained winds of 70mph (110km/h) and a minimum barometric pressure of 994mb (hPa; 29.35inHg). Thereafter, Flossie crossed the 140th meridian west into the central Pacific Ocean, where the Central Pacific Hurricane Center (CPHC) assumed responsibility of the system. Unfavorable upper-level winds in association with an upper-level trough began to impede the system's organization around this time, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>began</b> a slow weakening trend.|$|E
5|$|The term {{track and}} field is {{intertwined}} with the stadiums that first hosted such competitions. The two basic features of a {{track and field}} stadium are the outer oval-shaped running track and an area of turf within this track—the field. In earlier competitions, track lengths varied: the Panathinaiko Stadium measured 333.33metres at the 1896 Summer Olympics, while at the 1904 Olympics the distance was {{a third of a}} mile (536.45m) at Francis Field. As the sport developed, the IAAF standardised the length to 400m and stated that the tracks must be split into six to eight running lanes. Precise widths for the lanes were established, as were regulations regarding the curvature of the track. Tracks made of flattened cinders were popular in the early 20th century but synthetic tracks became standard in the late 1960s. 3M's Tartan track (an all-weather running track of polyurethane) gained popularity after its use at the 1968 US Olympic Trials and the 1968 Summer Olympics <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>began</b> the process in which synthetic tracks became the standard for the sport. Many track and field stadiums are multi-purpose stadiums, with the running track surrounding a field built for other sports, such as the various types of football.|$|E

5|$|The {{depression}} organized steadily {{that evening}} {{and into the}} morning of September18. Later that day, it was upgraded to Tropical Storm Bonnie <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>began</b> to move slowly to the northeast. Like most storms that develop in higher latitudes, Bonnie was embedded in a larger-scale cyclonic circulation at first, which minimized shear (allowing it to develop) and provided weak steering currents. The low shear allowed Bonnie to rapidly develop and a small but well-defined eye formed late that morning. The storm was upgraded to a hurricane later that day while meandering in the open ocean. The intensification rate slowed down after becoming a hurricane. In addition, Bonnie began to slowly move more to the northeast on September19 as steering currents slowly developed. Bonnie strengthened into a Category2 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson hurricane scale that morning as well, peaking at 105mph (165km/h) with a 970mbar central pressure. The general track and intensity maintained itself throughout the day and into September20, when the eye became less distinct and Bonnie weakened slightly, although remaining a Category2 hurricane. Early on September21, the eye became better defined once again and Bonnie restrengthened slightly while continuing its slow northeast motion. That afternoon, the storm gradually strengthened some more and reached its peak intensity of 110mph (175km/h) and a central pressure of 965mbar, just under Category3 intensity. Bonnie maintained its strength through the evening and into the early morning of September 22, when it began to weaken very gradually and level off. Bonnie also began to turn more eastward at that point before it became held up by a blocking mid-latitude ridge of high pressure, which stalled the motion.|$|E
5|$|The storm's {{convection}} {{organized around}} a central core, {{and the system}} became a tropical storm on November23 and received the name Delta. An eye-like feature appeared near the storm's circulatory center several times that day. The larger-scale deep-layered cyclonic circulation within which it was embedded steered it on a slow southward and then south-southwesterly track. Strong wind shear prevented immediate development and the system added an eastward component to its drift. Moving out of the high-shear environment on November24, Delta gained organization. Outflow and convective banding increased and an eye feature became well defined. This eye signaled the storm's peak strength of 70mph (110km/h), just below hurricane status. However, the official forecast at the time predicted Delta to strengthen further and become a minimal hurricane. Delta's motion stalled as it reached the southern base of a large cyclonic trough over the northern Atlantic within which it was embedded. Maintaining its intensity, Delta remained motionless for half a day until, that evening when it began a slow southward drift at 6mph (9km/h). Maintaining its intensity, Delta remained motionless for half a day Convection broke down in the storm's western semicircle early on November25; the decreased organization caused slight weakening. Maintaining its intensity, Delta remained motionless for half a day The southward motion slowed and the weakening trend continued into the evening. Cooling cold tops were counteracted by wind shear which exposed most of the low-level center. The storm's southward motion stopped <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>began</b> moving east at 6mph (9km/h). Some of the computer models suggested the weakening tropical storm could be absorbed by a developing low to the west, which {{a few days later}} became Hurricane Epsilon.
