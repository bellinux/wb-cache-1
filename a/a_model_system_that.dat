40|$|Abstract This study {{introduces}} and applies <b>a</b> <b>modelling</b> <b>system</b> <b>that</b> {{is suitable}} for the impact assessment of environmental innovations referred to as “Blue Economy” innovations. The paper’s contribution to the literature is threefold. First, {{the building of a}} multi-sector computable general equilibrium (CGE) model, which provides the theoretical framework for studying the economic impacts of using waste as a production input. Second, the creation of an empirical methodology through which new Blue Economy technologies can be concretely accounted for in regional input-output tables. Since Blue Economy innovations are mostly built on local inputs, their effects are primarily local. Third, given that interregional spillovers of local impacts might also be significant, through interregional trade or migration, <b>a</b> <b>modelling</b> approach that can follow complex spatial processes is applied. The broader model framework chosen is the GMR-Europe model. Keywords: GMR model, Blue Economy, computable general equilibrium models, TFP, innovation...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT Intrinsic {{equilibrium}} constants of 17 representative Brazilian Oxisols {{were estimated}} from potentiometric titration measuring the adsorption of H+ and OH− on amphoteric surfaces in suspensions of varying ionic strength. Equilibrium constants were fitted to two surface complexation models: diffuse layer and constant capacitance. The former was fitted by calculating total site concentration from curve fitting estimates and pH-extrapolation of the intrinsic equilibrium constants to the PZNPC (hand calculation), considering {{one and two}} reactive sites, and by the FITEQL software. The latter was fitted only by FITEQL, with one reactive site. Soil chemical and physical properties were correlated to the intrinsic equilibrium constants. Both surface complexation models satisfactorily fit our experimental data, but for results at low ionic strength, optimization did not converge in FITEQL. Data were incorporated in Visual MINTEQ and they provide <b>a</b> <b>modeling</b> <b>system</b> <b>that</b> can predict protonation-dissociation reactions in the soil surface under changing environmental conditions...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} <b>a</b> <b>modeling</b> <b>system</b> <b>that</b> constructs 3 D {{models of}} particular object classes, such as cups, airplanes, and fish, from 2 D sketches. The {{core of the}} system is a sketch recognition algorithm that seeks to match the points and curves of a set of given 2 D templates to the sketch. The matching process employs an optimization metric that is based on curve feature vectors. The search space of possible correspondences is restricted by encoding knowledge about relative part locations into the 2 D template. Once a best-fit template is found, a 3 D object is constructed using a series of measurements that are extracted from the labelled 2 D sketch. The sketch-recognition and modeling algorithms are applied to sketches of cups and mugs, airplanes, and fish. The system allows non-experts to use drawings to quickly create 3 D models of specific object classes...|$|R
