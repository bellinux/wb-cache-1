2500|$|Munk {{applied for}} American {{citizenship}} in 1939 after the Anschluss and {{enlisted in the}} ski troops of the U.S. Army as a private. This was unusual as all the other young men at Scripps joined the U.S. Naval Reserve. Munk was eventually excused from military service to undertake defense-related research at Scripps. He joined several of his colleagues from Scripps at the U.S. Navy Radio and Sound Laboratory, where they developed methods related to amphibious warfare. Their methods were used successfully to predict surf conditions for Allied landings in North Africa, the Pacific theater of war, and on D-Day during the Normandy invasion. [...] Munk commented in 2009, [...] "The Normandy landing is famous because weather conditions were very poor <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>may</b> <b>not</b> realize it was postponed by General Eisenhower for 24 hours because of the prevailing wave conditions. And then he did decide, {{in spite of the}} fact that conditions were not favorable, it would be better to go in than lose the surprise element, which would have been lost if they waited for the next tidal cycle two weeks." ...|$|E
2500|$|The 16th {{season of}} The Simpsons has {{garnered}} generally positive reviews from critics, with many noting while the episodes are still good and funny {{they are of}} a lesser quality {{than those of the}} show's earlier seasons. CraveOnline gave the season a rating of 8.0 out of 10, and spoke highly of its [...] "little pieces of continuity", [...] "sharp parody", and [...] "non sequitur gags". Entertainment Focus gave it 4 out of 5 stars, concluding [...] "Some people have criticised The Simpsons claiming that the show is tired and has passed its prime. We don't agree with those people at all and think The Simpsons has been remarkably consistent in terms of its humour and stories. Sure it may have been eclipsed by the edgier Family Guy in more recent years but The Simpsons is, and always will be, one of the most original and talked-about shows. The Simpsons: Season 16 is another cracking instalment of the hit show and we still, after all these years, just can't get enough. High-Def Digest also gave a 4/5 star rating, saying [...] "As mentioned in the review, there are plenty of laughs to be had in this season, but very few of them come from a place that feels truly genuine and sincere. Sixteen seasons in, it seems that the show is a mixture of been-there-done-that sentiment and perfunctory punch lines. Aside from the so-so image, there's plenty here to keep the die-hard 'Simpsons' fan happy, so this one comes recommended for fans". Cinema Sentries said [...] "This is not something to pick up if you are a general TV fan, or a casual Simpsons fan. The overall quality of the season is not high enough, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>may</b> <b>not</b> get satisfactory enjoyment from them. If you sort of turned your back on the show, this probably isn't the season to check out. However, if you are a Simpsons devotee, then you will want to pick it up". DVDTalk wrote [...] "The Simpsons: Season Sixteen isn't the best of the series' run but it is a very strong collection of truly funny and frequently quite clever doses of animated comedic insanity." ...|$|E
