5|$|A normal {{variation}} in the PRNP gene can modify {{the course of the}} disease by delaying the age of onset and affecting the type of symptoms that develop. This gene produces prion protein, which is active in the brain and other tissues and <b>also</b> <b>appears</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> involved in transporting copper. A role for the ApoE gene was initially suspected but could not be confirmed.|$|E
5|$|Although MUS81 is a {{component}} of a minor crossover pathway in the meiosis of budding yeast, plants and vertebrates, in the protozoan Tetrahymena thermophila, MUS81 appears {{to be part of}} an essential, if not the predominant crossover pathway. The MUS81 pathway <b>also</b> <b>appears</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> the predominant crossover pathway in the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe.|$|E
5|$|M110 <b>also</b> <b>appears</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> {{interacting}} with the Andromeda Galaxy, and astronomers have found in the halo of the latter a stream of metal-rich stars that {{appear to have been}} stripped from these satellite galaxies. M110 does contain a dusty lane, which may indicate recent or ongoing star formation.|$|E

5|$|Stela 88 {{may have}} been paired with Stela 62. The {{monument}} has {{the image of a}} queen but her name is unknown. B'olon K'awiil <b>also</b> <b>appears</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> mentioned on the stela. It dates to around 751 and stands on the stairway of Structure 13. Stela 91 is another very late monument probably dating to the early 10th century. Like Stela 84, it bears an inscription that is a meaningless imitation of hieroglyphic writing.|$|E
5|$|As calcium {{is heavily}} {{involved}} in bone manufacture, many bone diseases {{can be traced to}} problems with the organic matrix or the hydroxyapatite in molecular structure or organisation. For example, osteoporosis is a reduction in mineral content of bone per unit volume, and can be treated by supplementation of calcium, vitamin D, and biphosphates. Calcium supplements may benefit the serum lipids in women who have passed menopause as well as older men; in post-menopausal women calcium supplementation <b>also</b> <b>appears</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> inversely correlated with cardiovascular disease. Inadequate amounts of calcium, vitamin D, or phosphates can lead to the softening of bones, known as osteomalacia.|$|E
5|$|The {{huntingtin}} protein interacts with over 100 other proteins, {{and appears to}} have multiple biological functions. The behavior of this mutated protein is not completely understood, but it is toxic to certain cell types, particularly in the brain. Early damage is most evident in the striatum, but as the disease progresses, {{other areas of the}} brain are also more conspicuously affected. Early symptoms are attributable to functions of the striatum and its cortical connections—namely control over movement, mood and higher cognitive function. DNA methylation <b>also</b> <b>appears</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> changed in HD.|$|E
25|$|Booksellers and {{libraries}} <b>also</b> <b>appear</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> reconsidering their reluctance to carry erotica.|$|R
30|$|The {{evidence}} that {{a large proportion of}} illegal gamblers <b>also</b> <b>appear</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> excessive gamblers is noted above.|$|R
50|$|Most Klaramarians <b>also</b> <b>appear</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> telepaths. Klee Pan {{demonstrated}} {{the ability to}} grant a limited gift of telepathy to deserving humans.|$|R
5|$|Each {{of these}} {{positive}} outcomes requires some ability to forgo short-term reward {{in favor of}} a higher payoff in the future. The ability to delay gratification <b>also</b> <b>appears</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a buffer against rejection sensitivity (the tendency to be anxious when anticipating interpersonal rejection). In a 20-year follow-up of the marshmallow experiment, individuals with vulnerability to high rejection sensitivity who had shown strong delay of gratification abilities as preschoolers had higher self-esteem and self-worth and more adaptive coping skills, in comparison to the individuals who had high rejection sensitivity but low delay of gratification as four-year-olds. These compelling longitudinal findings converge with other studies showing a similar pattern: The ability to resist temptation early in life translates to persistent benefits across settings.|$|E
5|$|The {{large size}} of hadrosaurid eye sockets and the {{presence}} of sclerotic rings in the eyes imply acute vision and diurnal habits, evidence that sight was important to these animals. The hadrosaurid sense of hearing <b>also</b> <b>appears</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> strong. There is at least one example, in the related Corythosaurus, of a slender stapes (reptilian ear bone) in place, which combined with a large space for an eardrum implies a sensitive middle ear, and the hadrosaurid lagena is elongate like a crocodilian's. This indicates that the auditory portion of the inner ear was well-developed. If used as a noisemaker, the crest could also have provided recognizable differences for different species or sexes, because the differing layouts of the nasal passages corresponding to the different crest shapes would have produced intrinsically different sounds.|$|E
5|$|Before 2000 BC, the Maya spoke {{a single}} language, dubbed proto-Mayan by linguists. Linguistic {{analysis}} of reconstructed Proto-Mayan vocabulary {{suggests that the}} original Proto-Mayan homeland was in the western or northern Guatemalan Highlands, although the evidence is not conclusive. Proto-Mayan diverged during the Preclassic period to form the major Mayan language groups {{that make up the}} family, including Huastecan, Greater K'iche'an, Greater Q'anjobalan, Mamean, Tz'eltalan-Ch'olan, and Yucatecan. These groups diverged further during the pre-Columbian era to form over 30 languages that have survived into modern times. The language of almost all Classic Maya texts over the entire Maya area has been identified as Ch'olan; Late Preclassic text from Kaminaljuyu, in the highlands, <b>also</b> <b>appears</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> in, or related to, Ch'olan. The use of Ch'olan as the language of Maya text does not necessarily indicate that it was the language commonly used by the local populace – it may have been equivalent to Medieval Latin as a ritual or prestige language. Classic Ch'olan may have been the prestige language of the Classic Maya elite, used in inter-polity communication such as diplomacy and trade. By the Postclassic period, Yucatec was also being written in Maya codices alongside Ch'olan.|$|E

25|$|Nimesulide {{undergoes}} extensive biotransformation, {{mainly to}} 4-hydroxynimesulide (which <b>also</b> <b>appears</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> biologically active).|$|E
25|$|A. thaliana is {{native to}} Europe, Asia, and northwestern Africa. It <b>also</b> <b>appears</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> native in {{tropical}} afroalpine ecosystems. It has been introduced and naturalized worldwide.|$|E
25|$|HLA-DQ {{recognition}} of gliadin {{is critical to}} the pathogenesis of gluten-sensitive enteropathy, it <b>also</b> <b>appears</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> involved in idiopathic gluten sensitivity (See:Understanding DQ Haplotypes and DQ isoforms on the right).|$|E

30|$|Increased {{formation}} of ROS <b>also</b> <b>appear</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> of pivotal importance {{with regard to}} the effects of hyperoxia on cell viability and vascular tone [25, 31 – 33].|$|R
50|$|In {{featural}} phonology, uvular consonants {{are most}} often considered to contrast with velar consonants {{in terms of being}} -high and +back. Prototypical uvulars <b>also</b> <b>appear</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> -ATR.|$|R
25|$|Low phenethylamine (PEA) {{concentration}} in the brain is associated with major depressive disorder, and high concentrations are associated with schizophrenia. Low PEA levels and under-activation of TAAR1 <b>also</b> <b>appears</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> associated with ADHD.|$|E
25|$|Activation of the Hedgehog pathway {{leads to}} an {{increase}} in Snail protein expression and a decrease in E-cadherin and Tight Junctions. Hedgehog signaling <b>also</b> <b>appears</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a crucial regulator of angiogenesis and thus metastasis.|$|E
25|$|Similar {{to nearly}} all {{variants}} of lung carcinoma, large cell lung carcinoma with rhabdoid phenotype {{appears to be}} highly related to tobacco smoking. It <b>also</b> <b>appears</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> significantly more common in males than in females.|$|E

50|$|Mindfulness based {{programs}} <b>also</b> <b>appear</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> {{effective for}} managing anxiety disorders. It is unclear if meditation {{has an effect}} on anxiety and transcendental meditation <b>appears</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> no different than other types of meditation.|$|R
50|$|The nest may be {{expanded}} {{in subsequent years}} by the birds adding an extra chamber onto it. They <b>also</b> <b>appear</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> the preferred daytime roosting sites of the golden-tipped bat (Phoniscus papuensis).|$|R
25|$|Respiration rate <b>also</b> <b>appears</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> {{influenced}} significantly by caste. Males show {{a considerably}} {{higher rate of}} respiration than females and workers, due, in part, to their capability for flight and higher muscle mass. In general, males have more muscle and less fat, resulting in a higher metabolic O2 demand.|$|E
25|$|GAPDH <b>also</b> <b>appears</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> {{involved}} in the vesicle transport from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to the Golgi apparatus {{which is part of}} shipping route for secreted proteins. It was found that GAPDH is recruited by rab2 to the vesicular-tubular clusters of the ER where it helps to form COP 1 vesicles. GAPDH is activated via tyrosine phosphorylation by Src.|$|E
25|$|Non-steroidal {{anti-inflammatory}} drugs (NSAIDs), such as ibuprofen and naproxen, {{can cause}} flares of {{inflammatory bowel disease}} in approximately 25% of patients. These flares tend to occur within one week after starting regular use of the NSAID. In contrast, acetaminophen (paracetamol) and aspirin appear to be safe. Celecoxib (Celebrex), a cox-2 inhibitor, <b>also</b> <b>appears</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> safe, at least in short-term studies of patients in remission and on medication for their Crohn's disease.|$|E
25|$|HLA-DQ2 {{primarily}} presents gliadins {{with the}} HLA-DQ isoform DQ2.5 (DQ α5-β2) isoform. DQA1*0202:DQB1*0201 homozygotes (DQ α2-β2) <b>also</b> <b>appear</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> able <b>to</b> present pathogenic gliadin peptides, but a smaller set with lower binding affinity.|$|R
5000|$|... α7-nicotinic receptors <b>also</b> <b>appear</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> {{involved}} in cancer progression.
