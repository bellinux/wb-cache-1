25|$|Since the Newtonian {{reflector}} is {{the most}} common telescope built by amateur telescope makers, large sections of the literature on the subject are devoted to fabrication of the primary mirror. The mirror has to be carefully ground, polished and figured to an extremely accurate shape, usually a paraboloid. Telescopes with high focal ratios may use spherical mirrors since the difference in the two shapes is insignificant at those ratios. The tools used to achieve this shape are surprisingly simple, consisting of a similarly sized glass tool, a series of finer abrasives, and a polishing pitch lap made from a type of tree sap. Through <b>a</b> <b>whole</b> <b>series</b> <b>of</b> random strokes the mirror naturally tends to become spherical in shape. At that point, a variation in polishing strokes is typically used to create and perfect the desired paraboloidal shape.|$|E

500|$|Head VI {{was first}} {{exhibited}} in November 1949 at the Hanover Gallery in London, in a showing organised {{by one of}} the artist's early champions, Erica Brausen. At the time, Bacon was a highly controversial but respected artist, best known for his 1944 Three Studies for Figures at the Base of a Crucifixion, which made him the enfant terrible of British art. Head VI drew a mixed reaction from art critics; John Russell, later Bacon's biographer, at the time dismissed it as a cross between [...] "an alligator shorn of its jaws and an accountant in pince-nez who has come to a bad end". In 1989 Lawrence Gowing wrote that the [...] "shock of the picture, when it was seen with <b>a</b> <b>whole</b> <b>series</b> <b>of</b> heads... was indescribable. It was everything unpardonable.
