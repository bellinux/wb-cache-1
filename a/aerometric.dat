40|$|In this study, {{we apply}} two bias-adjustment {{techniques}} {{to help improve}} forecast accuracy by post-processing air quality forecast (AQF) model outputs.

40|$|Air {{pollution}} {{control in the}} United States for five common pollutants [...] particulate matter, ground-level ozone, sulfur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide, and carbon monoxide [...] is based partly on the attainment of ambient air quality standards that represent a level of air pollution regarded as safe. Regulatory and health agencies often focus on whether standards for short periods are attained; {{the number of days}} that standards are exceeded is used to track progress. Efforts to explain air pollution to the public often incorporate an air quality index that represents daily concentrations of pollutants. While effects of short-term exposures have been emphasized, research shows that long-term exposures to lower concentrations of air pollutants can also result in adverse health effects. We developed an aggregate index that represents long-term exposure to these pollutants, using 1995 monitoring data for metropolitan areas obtained from the U. S.

40|$|Kalman {{filtering}} (KF) {{is used to}} postprocess numerical-model {{output to}} estimate systematic errors in surface ozone forecasts. It is implemented with a recursive algorithm that updates its estimate of future ozone-concentration bias by using past forecasts and observations. KF performance is tested for three types of ozone forecasts: deterministic, ensemble-averaged, and probabilistic forecasts. Eight photochemical models were run for 56 days during summer 2004 over northeastern USA and southern Canada {{as part of the}} International Consortium for Atmospheric Research on Transport and Transformation New England Air Quality (AQ) Study. The raw and KF-corrected predictions are compared with ozone measurements from the <b>Aerometric</b> Information Retrieval Now data set, which includes roughly 360 surface stations. The completeness of the data set allowed a thorough sensitivity test of key KF parameters. It is found that the KF improves forecasts of ozone-concentration magnitude and the ability to predict rare events, both for deterministic and ensemble-averaged forecasts. It also improves the ability to predict the daily maximum ozone concentration, and reduces the time lag between the forecast and observed maxima. For this case study, KF considerably improves the predictive skill of probabilistic forecasts of ozone concentration greater than thresholds of 10 to 50 ppbv, but it degrades it for thresholds of 70 to 90 ppbv. Moreover, KF considerably reduces probabilistic forecast bias. The significance of KF postprocessing and ensemble-averaging is that they are both effective for real-time AQ forecasting.

40|$|Background: Children {{with asthma}} in inner-city {{communities}} {{may be particularly}} vulnerable to adverse effects of air pollution because of their airways disease and exposure to relatively high levels of motor vehicle emissions. Objective: To investigate the association between fluctuations in outdoor air pollution and asthma morbidity among inner-city children with asthma. Methods: We analyzed data from 861 children with persistent asthma in 7 US urban communities who performed 2 -week periods of twice-daily pulmonary function testing every 6 months for 2 years. Asthma symptom data were collected every 2 months. Daily pollution measurements {{were obtained from the}} <b>Aerometric</b> Information Retrieval System. The relationship of lung function and symptoms to fluctuations in pollutant concentrations was examined by using mixed models. Results: Almost all pollutant concentrations measured were below the National Ambient Air Quality Standards. In single pollutant models, higher 5 -day average concentrations of NO 2, sulfur dioxide, and particles smaller than 2. 5 mm were associated with significantly lower pulmonary function. Higher pollutant levels were independently associated with reduced lung function in a 3 -pollutant model. Higher concentrations of NO 2 and particles smaller than 2. 5 mm were associated with asthma-related missed school days, and higher NO 2 concentrations were associated with asthma symptoms. Conclusion: Among inner-city children with asthma, short-term increases in air pollutant concentrations below the National Ambient Air Quality Standards were associated with adverse respiratory health effects. The associations with NO 2 suggest that motor vehicle emissions may be causing excess morbidity in this population...|$|E
40|$|A {{series of}} {{experiments}} (the Southern Oxidant and Aerosol Study – SOAS) took place in central Alabama in June–July, 2013 {{as part of the}} broader Southern Atmosphere Study (SAS). These projects were aimed at studying oxidant photochemistry and formation and impacts of aerosols at a detailed process level in a location where high biogenic organic vapor emissions interact with anthropogenic emissions, and the atmospheric chemistry occurs in a subtropical climate in North America. The majority of the ground-based experiments were located at the Southeastern Aerosol Research and Characterization (SEARCH) Centreville (CTR) site near Brent, Alabama, where extensive, unique <b>aerometric</b> measurements of trace gases and particles and meteorology were made beginning in the early 1990 s through 2013. The SEARCH network data permits a characterization of the temporal and spatial context of the SOAS findings. Our earlier analyses of emissions and air quality trends are extended through 2013 to provide a perspective for continued decline in ambient concentrations, and the implications of these changes to regional sulfur oxide, nitrogen–ozone, and carbon chemistry. The narrative supports the SAS program in terms of long-term average chemistry (chemical climatology) and short-term comparisons of early summer average spatial variability across the southeastern US at high temporal (hourly) resolution. The long-term measurements show that the SOAS experiments took place during the second wettest and coolest year in the 2000 – 2013 period, with lower than average solar radiation. The pollution levels at CTR and other SEARCH sites were the lowest since full measurements began in 1999. Changes in anthropogenic gas and particle emissions between 1999 and 2013 account for the decline in pollutant concentrations at the monitoring sites in the region. The data provide an opportunity to contrast SOAS results with temporally and spatially variable conditions in support of the development of tests for the robustness of SOAS findings...|$|E
40|$|This chapter {{considers}} selected {{issues relating}} {{to the use of}} photochemical simulation models to discern the true cause or causes of the ozone weekend effect. One of the primary uses of models is to evaluate and compare the effects on air quality of potential emission reduction strategies. Mechanistic models, such as the Urban Airshed Model and other, newer varieties, are well suited to these comparisons of relative effects, and have been used for such purposes for almost two decades. They can be used to assess the effects of emission changes associated with the weekend affect also. However, the ARB believes strongly that models must undergo thorough performance evaluations before appropriately applying them to address various purposes like those above. The potential for compensating errors and bias can easily lead to misleading answers without a good understanding of model performance. Without rigorous model performance evaluation of multiple <b>aerometric</b> parameters in magnitude, time, and space, it is very possible to get “the correct answer for the wrong reasons. ” Such performance evaluations are described in the ARB’s Technical Guidance Document: Photochemical Modeling. There may be additional concerns involved with applying models to evaluate the emission changes associated with the weekend effect. Among those is the need to develop an inventory truly representative of weekend emissions, a difficult task given the complexity of the spatial, temporal, and compositional variations in the mix of emission sources on weekends and the limited amount of weekend-specific information. Most of the complexities associated with evaluating the ozone weekend effect may be addressed by paying special attention to certain aspects of the model performance evaluation, or, when possible, through model sensitivity studies. This chapter considers selected concerns related to the use of photochemical models to isolate and quantify the primary contributors to the ozone weekend effect...|$|E

The relationship between particulate air pollution and mortality among infants has not been examined in the United States. This study evaluates the relationship between postneonatal infant mortality and particulate matter in the United States. Our study involved analysis of cohorts consisting of approximately 4 million infants born between 1989 and 1991 in states that report relevant covariates; this included 86 metropolitan statistical areas (MSAs) in the United States. Data from the National Center for Health Statistics-linked birth/infant death records were combined at the MSA level with measurements of particulate matter 10 microns or less (PM 10) from the EPA's <b>Aerometric</b> Database. Infants were categorized as having high, medium, or low exposures based on tertiles of PM 10. Total and cause-specific postneonatal mortality rates were examined using logistic regression to control for demographic and environmental factors. Overall postneonatal mortality rates were 3. 1 among infants with low PM 10 exposures, 3. 5 among infants with medium PM 10 exposures, and 3. 7 among highly exposed infants. After adjustment for other covariates, the odds ratio (OR) and 95 % confidence intervals (CI) for total postneonatal mortality for the high exposure versus the low exposure group was 1. 10 (1. 04, 1. 16). In normal birth weight infants, high PM 10 exposure was associated with respiratory causes [OR = 1. 40, (1. 05, 1. 85) ] and {{sudden infant death syndrome}} [OR = 1. 26, (1. 14, 1. 39) ]. For low birth weight babies, high PM 10 exposure was associated, but not significantly, with mortality from respiratory causes [OR = 1. 18, (0. 86, 1. 61) ].

One rural site was collocated with the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection (PADEP) at a former NARSTO-Northeast site near Holbrook, Greene County, Pennsylvania. The other rural site was collocated at a site operated by the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency (OHEPA) and managed by the Ohio State Forestry Division in Gifford State Forest near Athens, Ohio. Analysis of data collected to date show that: (1) the median mass and composition of PM{sub 2. 5 } are similar for both Lawrenceville and Holbrook, suggesting that the sites are impacted more by the regional than by local effects; (2) there was no significant differences in the particulate trending and levels observed at both sites within seasons; (3) sulfate levels predominate at both sites, and (4) PM{sub 2. 5 } and PM{sub 10 } mass concentration levels are consistently higher in summer than in winter, with intermediate levels being observed in the fall and spring. Data analysis focusing on relating the <b>aerometric</b> measurements to local and regional scale emissions of sources of primary and secondary fine particles using receptor-based air quality models will follow...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} briefly the meteorological {{background and}} the <b>aerometric</b> measurements conducted during the 1969 Pasadena smog experiment. Observations of the winds, the air temperature, humidity, and incoming solar radiation at the experiment site, with support of U. S. Weather Bureau data, indicated that the weather during the study was generally quite regular and {{was consistent with the}} Southern California climatology. The winds were light and mainly from the southwest sector during the day, indicating that the polluted air observed in Pasadena would be a complicated mixture of material produced locally and entering the area from distant sources. The observations of such gases as CO, NO, NO_ 2, oxidant (mostly ozone), hydrocarbons, and SO_ 2 bore out this conjecture in that the hourly concentration patterns were somewhat variable from day to day. The diurnal averages of such data were more revealing in trends, however, showing typical changes of gases linked with the smog reactions observed during other similar studies. Of particular interest was the simultaneous peaking of SO_ 2 with ozone at midday. Accompanying the midday maximum of ozone was a maximum in the scattering coefficient b_(scat) as observed by an integrating nephelometer. The frequently observed visibility restrictions during periods of photochemical smog formation have been associated with changes occurring principally in the 0. 1 - to 1. 0 -μm diameter range of particles. Comparison between the diurnal average variations of the total number concentration of aerosols N the average surface area S and the volume fraction φ showed different behavior. While N increased throughout the daylight hours until late afternoon, φ displayed a peak at midday {{in a manner similar to}} the behavior of ozone. S showed a broad maximum through the daylight hours. Since S and φ are linked mainly with the fraction of suspended particles greater than 0. 1 -μm diameter, this portion of the particle size spectrum may have evolved by photochemically induced interaction with the suspending gases. Two possible mechanisms for the growth of the large particle fraction are inferred. The first involves heterogeneous nucleation of condensable vapors, and the second postulates a combination of particle coagulation and photochemical reactions of low molecular-weight hydrocarbons, nitrogen compounds, and sulfur dioxide on the surface of small particles...|$|E
40|$|The California Central Valley {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{polluted}} areas in United States due to agricultural activities, air mass ventilation prevented by the surrounding mountains, high urban emissions, and local atmospheric conditions. The Central Valley is a nonattainment area with the PM 2. 5 (particulate matter with diameter 3 ̆c 2. 5 um) National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS) because measurements at several monitoring sites exceed the daily and annual NAAQS PM 2. 5 standards. Three-dimensional air quality models (AQMs) play an important role in guiding the development of State Implementation Plans (SIP) for compliance with the NAAQS for PM 2. 5. In this work, a comprehensive model evaluation has been conducted for the Weather Research and Forecasting/Chemical (WRF-Chem) model version 3 for June 2008 as a base for our future study on the air quality in the Central Valley. Simulated meteorological variables, including temperature (T), relative humidity (RH), wind speed and direction and precipitation, are evaluated through comparison with observations from the Clean Air Status and Trends Network (CASTNet), the National Atmospheric Deposition Program (NADP), and the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) Earth Observing laboratory atmospheric sounding data. Simulated air pollutants, including mixing ratios of O 3 (hourly, 1 -hour maximum, and 8 -hour average), mass concentrations of PM 10, PM 2. 5, and PM 2. 5 components (e. g., sulfate, nitrate, ammonium, black carbon, organic carbon) are evaluated using the surface observations from CASTNet, the <b>Aerometric</b> Information Retrieval System – Air Quality System (AIRS-AQS), the Interagency Monitoring of Protected Visual Environments (IMPROVE) and the Speciation Trends Network (STN). The predicted total tropospheric aerosol optical depths (AOD) are compared with those derived from MODIS. Our evaluation has shown that the WRF-Chem predictions agree reasonably well with T, RH, and wind speed observations but relatively poorly with the observed wind direction. While the model reproduces the observed diurnal variations for O 3 and PM, it tends to underpredict 1 -hour maximum O 3 mixing ratios and PM 10 mass concentrations. Through the above model evaluation, it is seen that WRF-Chem can be reliable for further simulating impacts of agricultural dust on air quality in the Central Valley...|$|E
