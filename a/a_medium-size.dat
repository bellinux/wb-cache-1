The weight of a djembe ranges from 5kg to 13kg (11–29lb) and depends on size and shell material. <b>A</b> <b>medium-size</b> djembe carved {{from one of the}} traditional woods (including skin, rings, and rope) weighs around 9kg (20lb).|$|E
25|$|Forced begging is a {{profitable}} practice in which exploiters {{are motivated by}} economic incentives. The business structures of major rings of children trafficked {{for the purpose of}} begging have been examined as comparable to <b>a</b> <b>medium-size</b> business enterprise. In the most severe cases networks of children forced to beg may generate $30–40,000 USD for the profiteer. Though family networks are not nearly as extensive, a study conducted in Albania showed that a family with multiple children begging can earn up to fifteen euros a day, an amount greater than the average national teacher salary. Anti-Slavery International asserts that because this income is relatively high many families believe it is the best option available given the lack of existing capabilities. Capability deprivation, meaning the routine absence of adequate resources that serve in facilitating opportunities, may account for cross-generational begging practices within families. UNICEF studies have found that begging is especially prevalent among families in which parents are incapacitated in some way, leading children to be the sole providers.|$|E

25|$|Although quasars appear faint {{when viewed}} from Earth, they are visible from extreme distances, being the most {{luminous}} objects in the known universe. The brightest quasar in the sky is 3C273 in the constellation of Virgo. It has an average apparent magnitude of 12.8 (bright enough to be seen through <b>a</b> <b>medium-size</b> amateur telescope), but it has an absolute magnitude of −26.7. From {{a distance of about}} 33 light-years, this object would shine in the sky about as brightly as our sun. This quasar's luminosity is, therefore, about 4 trillion (4 × 1012) times that of the Sun, or about 100 times that of the total light of giant galaxies like the Milky Way. This assumes the quasar is radiating energy in all directions, but the active galactic nucleus is believed to be radiating preferentially in the direction of its jet. In a universe containing hundreds of billions of galaxies, most of which had active nuclei billions of years ago but only seen today, it is statistically certain that thousands of energy jets should be pointed toward the Earth, some more directly than others. In many cases {{it is likely that the}} brighter the quasar, the more directly its jet is aimed at the Earth.|$|E
25|$|Chasmosaurus was <b>a</b> <b>medium-size</b> ceratopsid. In 2010 G.S. Paul {{estimated}} {{the length of}} C. belli at 4.8 metres, its weight at two tonnes; C. russelli would have been 4.3 metres long and weighed 1.5 tonnes. The known {{differences between the two}} species mainly pertain to the horn and frill shape, as the postcrania of C. russelli are poorly known. Like many ceratopsians, Chasmosaurus had three main facial horns - one on the nose and two on the brow. In both species these horns are quite short, but with C. russelli they are somewhat longer, especially the brow horns, and more curved backwards. The frill of Chasmosaurus is very elongated and broader at the rear than at the front. It is hardly elevated from the plane of the snout. With C. belli the rear of the frill is V-shaped and its sides are straight. With C. russelli the rear edge is shaped as a shallow U, and the sides are more convex. The sides were adorned by six to nine smaller skin ossifications (called episquamosals) or osteoderms, which attached to the squamosal bone. The corner of the frill featured two larger osteoderms on the parietal bone. With C. russelli the outer one was the largest, with C. belli the inner one. The remainder of the rear edge lacked osteoderms. The parietal bones of the frill were pierced by very large openings, after which the genus was named: the parietal fenestrae. These were not oval in shape, as with most relatives, but triangular, with one point orientated towards the frill corner.|$|E

500|$|In September 1890 the Naval Technical Committee (MTK) {{rolled out}} a {{proposal}} for <b>a</b> <b>medium-size</b> ( [...] , [...] long) battleship armed with three single 12-inch guns mounted in barbettes. Codenamed Gangut No. 2, it attempted to blend the hull of Alexander II and the armament of Navarin in a tightly budgeted, compromised design. None of the admirals who reviewed the proposal was satisfied with it, and the MTK was overwhelmed with a flurry of contradicting suggestions. The four main guns were to be mounted in two barbettes covered with [...] armoured cupolas. The choice of secondary armament caused another round of debate. The MTK initially proposed a combination of Russian Model 1877 6-inch guns and Armstrong 4.7-inch guns. Admirals Stepan Makarov and Vladimir Verkhovsky advised {{against the use of}} weapons of two different sizes (as this caused problems with fire control and direction), and against using the obsolete 1877 guns. The MTK did just the opposite, dropping the modern Armstrong guns in favor of the 1877 model, probably as a result of not wanting to use foreign-built weaponry. In March 1891 the MTK presented a revised proposal that increased displacement to [...] and the main armament to four 12-inch guns that was accepted by Admiral Chikachev.|$|E

2500|$|However, {{there is}} at least one {{practical}} application that exploits those weaknesses: the use of <b>a</b> <b>medium-size</b> woofer placed closely in front of a [...] "kick drum" [...] (bass drum) in a drum set to act as a microphone. [...] A commercial product example is the Yamaha Subkick, a [...] woofer shock-mounted into a 10" [...] drum shell used in front of kick drums. Since a relatively massive membrane is unable to transduce high frequencies while being capable of tolerating strong low-frequency transients, the speaker is often ideal for picking up the kick drum while reducing bleed from the nearby cymbals and snare drums. Less commonly, microphones themselves can be used as speakers, but due to their low power handling and small transducer sizes, a tweeter is the most practical application. One instance of such an application was the STC microphone-derived 4001 super-tweeter, which was successfully used in a number of high quality loudspeaker systems from the late 1960s to the mid-70s.|$|E
