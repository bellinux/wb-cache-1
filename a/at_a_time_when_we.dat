500|$|Writing in the South Australian Register, George William Francis, {{director}} of the Botanic Garden, said that the 32species of timber Ninnis had collected settled [...] "that important question, is there timber around [...] or not?" [...] Noting that the member of the expedition originally intended to return biological specimens to Adelaide had failed to do so, Francis wrote that [...] "we are very much indebted to this gentleman [...] who has thus supplied us <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>time</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> have failed in obtaining information through the appointed channel." [...] Upon {{the conclusion of the}} expedition in 1866, Ninnis received the thanks of the Parliament of South Australia for his work. His research on the expedition later formed the basis of a published work, Remarks on the Natural History, Meteorology, and Native Population of Northern Australia.|$|E
500|$|I {{definitely}} don't go {{the straight}} and narrow path, and you know, I definitely kinda like to experiment and collaborate. And so, I think it's taken me and Max this long to work together because of that, because what he does is genius and he is a classic hitmaker. But when I was coming out it was <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>time</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> had the huge pop explosion, and he was all over radio and I just wanted to work with others like Linda Perry and do that route and do [...] "Beautiful" [...] and songs like that. We built a level of respect for each other. So at this point, coming together, especially embracing my true pop-starness, at this point in my career having come full circle, I was able to really truly embrace it, and embrace him. He gave me the freedom to really sing on these songs, and have a little more creative freedom because I heard he is a stickler for melody and a melody king and I was scared, I was like 'Oh my God! I won't be able to collaborate here.' But he couldn't have been more great, and this is a really fun song, super up-tempo. It's probably the most dancey-ish song on my record, but it's called 'Let There Be Love' but it's free and representative of what this album is about.|$|E

Arguing that Wright and Trinity United Church of Christ had been misrepresented by [...] "the snippets of those sermons that have run in an endless loop on the television and YouTube", Obama spoke of Wright's service to the poor and needy, and of the role Wright played in Obama's own journey to Christianity.|$|E

In Congress, Representatives Eric Cantor and Zach Wamp wrote House Speaker Nancy Pelosi demanding she [...] "swiftly and immediately" [...] reprimand Ellison for his remarks. The letter said, [...] "Even if Ellison asserts {{that he was not}} implying that 9/11 was orchestrated by the administration, the comparison he draws between Hitler and the President of United States is disgraceful. These comments inflame hatred and division <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>time</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> should be promoting our unity and reconciliation." [...] The Anti-Defamation League also stated [...] "Whatever his views may be on the administration's response to 9/11 and the conduct of the war on terrorism, likening it to Hitler's rise to power and Nazism is odious and demeans the victims of 9/11 and the brave American men and women engaged in the war on terror. Furthermore, it demonstrates a profound lack of understanding about the horrors that Hitler and his Nazi regime perpetrated." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{movie is}} based on Sully's {{autobiography}} , rights to which were optioned by producers Frank Marshall and Allyn Stewart in 2010. They developed the screenplay with Stewart's partner executive producer Kipp Nelson, hiring screenwriter Todd Komarnicki. From the start, Sullenberger wanted the film to encompass [...] "that sense of our common humanity", noting that the incident had taken place shortly after the 2008 Great Recession. He explains: [...] "People were wondering if everything was about self-interest and greed. They were doubting human nature. Then all these people acted together, selflessly, to get something really important done. In a way, I think it gave everyone {{a chance to have}} hope, <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>time</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> all needed it." [...] Komarnicki said the difficulty was not depicting the landing in the river, but the investigation afterwards: [...] "It wasn't really a challenge {{of what to do with}} the event since that is the thing everyone knows about, it was more about how you parse out the information about the man slowly falling apart and becoming a hero in the eyes of the world when internally and with the investigators it was actually seemingly going the other way." ...|$|E

She said, [...] "When I realized that Claire truly did not want to do it any more, {{it was hard for me}} to want to do it. The joy in writing the show was that everyone was behind it and wanted to do it. And I love her. So part of the joy and excitement and happiness would have gone out of me if she had not been on board 100 percent. I wasn't able to say this at the time, but in retrospect it was a blessing for it to end <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>time</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> all enjoyed doing it. That's not to say that if the network had ordered more shows that I wouldn't have given it my best. But there was a rightness in how short the season was. This was a show about adolescence and sort of ended in its own adolescence. There was an aura about how short the series was like all things that die young. The show ended at a point that it was still all potential." ...|$|E

Sometimes I didn't know who was playing. I was just conscious of this big smouldering mass of sound." [...] Young called Pearl Jam drummer Jack Irons [...] "unbelievable." [...] He stated that he [...] "played his ass off on every take at every session," [...] and added, [...] "I can't say enough good things about him." [...] Pearl Jam vocalist Eddie Vedder was not around much for the recording sessions. Vedder {{explained that he was}} [...] "in the midst of a pretty intense stalker problem," [...] adding that [...] "leaving the house wasn't the easiest thing to do." [...] Vedder would refer to the issue in the song [...] "Lukin" [...] from Pearl Jam's 1996 album, No Code. Pearl Jam guitarist Stone Gossard said that Mirror Ball [...] "came <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>time</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> needed it, that Neil thought we were a band that would be good to make a record with. He probably felt sorry for us. He made it all right for us to be who we were. He's not taking his career so seriously that he can't take chances. Suddenly, our band seemed too serious." ...|$|E
