50|$|Many of the {{technical}} features (<b>asynchronous</b> <b>data</b> bus, distributed bus arbitration, large board size) are shared with IEEE standard FASTBUS.FASTBUS {{was used as a}} data acquisition system in many high-energy physics experiments in the 1980s and 1990s.|$|E
5000|$|ADMF (<b>Asynchronous</b> <b>Data</b> Mover Facility), {{which was}} {{introduced}} in 1992, goes beyond {{the capabilities of the}} MVPG (Move Page) instruction, which is limited to a single page, [...] and can move groups of pages between Central and Expanded Storage.|$|E
50|$|FireWire {{is capable}} of safely {{operating}} critical systems due to the way multiple devices interact with the bus and how the bus allocates bandwidth to the devices. FireWire {{is capable of}} both asynchronous and isochronous transfer methods at once. Isochronous data transfers are transfers for devices that require continuous, guaranteed bandwidth. In an aircraft, for instance, Isochronous devices include control of the rudder, mouse operations and data from pressure sensors outside the aircraft. All these elements require constant, uninterrupted bandwidth. To support both elements, FireWire dedicates a certain percentage to isochronous data and the rest to <b>asynchronous</b> <b>data.</b> In IEEE 1394, 80% of the bus is reserved for isochronous cycles, leaving <b>asynchronous</b> <b>data</b> {{with a minimum of}} 20% of the bus.|$|E

50|$|After system {{start-up}} is finished, the Real-Time domain {{is operating}} under Real-Time conditions. The scheduling {{of the basic}} cycle {{is controlled by the}} Managing Node (MN). The overall cycle time depends on the amount of isochronous data, <b>asynchronous</b> <b>data</b> and the number of nodes to be polled during each cycle.|$|E

50|$|MOST25 {{provides}} a bandwidth of approximately 23 megabaud for streaming (synchronous) {{as well as}} package (<b>asynchronous)</b> <b>data</b> transfer over an optical physical layer. It is separated into 60 physical channels. The user can select and configure the channels into groups of four bytes each. MOST25 provides many services and methods for the allocation (and deallocation) of physical channels.MOST25 supports up to 15 uncompressed stereo audio channels with CD-quality sound or up to 15 MPEG-1 channels for audio/video transfer, each of which uses four Bytes (four physical channels).MOST also {{provides a}} channel for transferring control information. The system frequency of 44.1 kHz allows a bandwidth of 705.6 kbit/s, enabling 2670 control messages per second to be transferred. Control messages are used to configure MOST devices and configure synchronous and <b>asynchronous</b> <b>data</b> transfer. The system frequency closely follows the CD standard. Reference data can also be transferred via the control channel.|$|E

5000|$|The {{designated}} {{technology for}} B-ISDN was Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM), which {{was intended to}} carry both synchronous voice and <b>asynchronous</b> <b>data</b> services on the same transport. The B-ISDN vision has been overtaken by other disruptive technologies used in the Internet. The ATM technology survived as a low-level layer in most digital subscriber line (DSL) technologies, and as a payload type in some wireless technologies such as WiMAX. The term [...] "broadband" [...] became a marketing term for any digital Internet access service.|$|E
50|$|The design {{deliberately}} {{minimizes the}} amount of redundant logic required in the system. For example, a system always contains more slave devices than master devices {{so most of the}} complex logic required to implement <b>asynchronous</b> <b>data</b> transfers is forced into the relatively few master devices. For interrupts, only the interrupt-fielding processor needs to contain the complex timing logic. The end result is that most I/O controllers can be implemented with simple logic, and most of the critical logic is implemented as a custom MSI IC.|$|E
