25|$|A {{piezoelectric}} transformer {{is a type}} of AC voltage multiplier. Unlike {{a conventional}} transformer, which uses magnetic coupling between input and output, the piezoelectric transformer uses <b>acoustic</b> <b>coupling.</b> An input voltage is applied across a short length of a bar of piezoceramic material such as PZT, creating an alternating stress in the bar by the inverse piezoelectric effect and causing the whole bar to vibrate. The vibration frequency is chosen to be the resonant frequency of the block, typically in the 100kilohertz to 1megahertz range. A higher output voltage is then generated across another section of the bar by the piezoelectric effect. Step-up ratios of more than 1,000:1 have been demonstrated. An extra feature of this transformer is that, by operating it above its resonant frequency, it can be made to appear as an inductive load, which is useful in circuits that require a controlled soft start. These devices can be used in DC–AC inverters to drive cold cathode fluorescent lamps. Piezo transformers {{are some of the most}} compact high voltage sources.|$|E

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedA {{study of the}} three dimensional (3 -D) effects of mesoscale variability on underwater sound propagation is conducted by interfacing the Chiu-Ehret 3 -D <b>acoustic</b> <b>coupled</b> mode (CM) model with a forecasted sound speed field generated by the Harvard Open Ocean Model (HOOM). This research concentrates on {{the sensitivity of the}} acoustic wave field to source depth and location with respect to a core ring in the Gulf Stream system for a 50 Hz sound source. The inclusion of the exact 3 -D physics in acoustics modeling requires substantial computer resources. For this reason, it is very desirable to determine when the simpler adiabatic or Nx 2 -D approximations may be used. To achieve this goal, "exact" 3 -D <b>acoustic</b> <b>coupled</b> mode model calculations are compared to results from the adiabatic approximation and the Nx 2 -D approximation in terms of transmission loss and phases and amplitudes of individual mode modulation envelopes.

50|$|In December 1972, Vadic {{introduced}} the VA3400, notable for full-duplex operation at 1,200 bit/s {{over the phone}} network.

It was similar in design, but used the lower frequency set for transmission. One could also use the 212A with a 103A modem at 300 bit/s. According to Vadic, the change in frequency assignments made the 212 intentionally incompatible with <b>acoustic</b> <b>coupling,</b> thereby locking out many potential modem manufacturers. In 1977, Vadic responded with the VA3467 triple modem, an answer-only modem sold to computer center operators that supported Vadic's 1,200-bit/s mode, AT&T's 212A mode, and 103A operation.|$|E

Animals of low mass cannot generate low-frequency vibrational surface waves; thus the mole rat could not produce a vibrational signal at 10-20 Hz like the elephant.
