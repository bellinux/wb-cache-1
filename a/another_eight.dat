Contrary to Matsui's expectations, China did not surrender and the Second Sino-Japanese War continued for <b>another</b> <b>eight</b> years.|$|E

5|$|As with written records, {{the archaeological}} {{evidence}} for this period is not extensive, {{and knowledge of the}} daily lives of the population is lacking. It is known that the Hebrides were taxed using the Ounceland system and evidence from Bornais suggests that settlers there may have been more prosperous than families of a similar status in the Northern Isles, possibly owing to a more relaxed political regime. Latterly, the Hebrides sent eight representatives from Lewis, Harris and Skye and <b>another</b> <b>eight</b> from the southern Hebrides to the Tynwald parliament on Man.|$|E

5|$|Of those 58 players, 28 {{have been}} pitchers, {{the most of}} any position; 22 of these were right-handed, while 6 were left-handed.

Combat continued for <b>another</b> <b>eight</b> days without significant changes to the frontlines. Fighting did not resume, and the war ended the following month following negotiation and acceptance of the Dayton Agreement.|$|E
5|$|The {{crucifix}} measures 448cm x 390cm and {{consists of}} five basic physical components; a vertical board reaching from the base to the cymatium onto which Christ is nailed, two horizontal cross-arms, and two vertical pieces acting as aprons adjacent to the central board. There are <b>another</b> <b>eight</b> minor pieces; mostly terminals, bases or framing devices. The structure is reinforced by two full length vertical battens. The horizontal cross-arms extend the full width of his outstretched body and are slotted into ridges in the vertical supports.

5|$|There {{have been}} a number of {{proposals}} to extend the O-Bahn to Golden Grove or build other routes, however none have progressed beyond consultation. An extension to Golden Grove would require the acquisition of extensive tracts of private property, due to the absence of an available corridor. Population increase in the area is negligible, although sprawl continues from Tea Tree Plaza Interchange for <b>another</b> <b>eight</b> kilometres to the Adelaide Hills. The current route was built with an allowance for a station at Grand Junction Road but it has not been built.|$|E
5|$|There is no {{evidence}} of any direct Norwegian rule in the area other than a few brief occupations although the written record is weak and no contemporary records of the Norse period from the Outer Hebrides exist. It is however known that Hebrides were taxed using the Ounceland system and evidence from Bornais suggests that settlers there may have been more prosperous than families of a similar status in the Northern Isles, possibly due to a more relaxed political regime. Latterly, the Hebrides sent eight representatives from Lewis and Harris and Skye and <b>another</b> <b>eight</b> from the southern Hebrides to the Tynwald parliament on Man.|$|E
5|$|A large Japanese {{air raid}} at 12:30 by 20 fighters and 12 bombers struck the Australian {{positions}} around Launch Jetty and the Finschhafen airstrip. About 60 bombs were dropped.
