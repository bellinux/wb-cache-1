5|$|Although not {{commonly}} {{understood as}} Gnostic, many scholars, including Bultmann, have forcefully <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> the Gospel of John has elements {{in common with}} Gnosticism. Christian Gnosticism did not fully develop until the mid-2nd century, and so 2nd-century Proto-Orthodox Christians concentrated much effort in examining and refuting it. To say John's gospel contained elements of Gnosticism is to assume that Gnosticism had developed to a level that required the author to respond to it. Bultmann, for example, <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> the opening theme of the Gospel of John, the pre-existing Logos, was actually a Gnostic theme. Other scholars, e.g. Raymond E. Brown have <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> the pre-existing Logos theme arises from the more ancient Jewish writings in the eighth chapter of the Book of Proverbs, and was fully developed as a theme in Hellenistic Judaism by Philo Judaeus.|$|E
5|$|American philosopher Louis Pojman has cited Pietism, {{political}} philosopher Jean-Jacques Rousseau, {{the modern}} debate between rationalism and empiricism, {{and the influence}} of natural law as influences on the development of Kant's ethics. Other philosophers have <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> Kant's parents and his teacher, Martin Knutzen, influenced his ethics. Those influenced by Kantian ethics include philosopher Jürgen Habermas, political philosopher John Rawls, and psychoanalyst Jacques Lacan. German philosopher G. W. F. Hegel criticised Kant for not providing specific enough detail in his moral theory to affect decision-making and for denying human nature. German philosopher Arthur Schopenhauer <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> ethics should attempt to describe how people behave and criticised Kant for being prescriptive. Michael Stocker has <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> acting out of duty can diminish other moral motivations such as friendship, while Marcia Baron has defended the theory by arguing that duty does not diminish other motivations. The Catholic Church has criticised Kant's ethics as contradictory and regards Christian ethics as more compatible with virtue ethics.|$|E

5|$|Another {{question}} in the case was whether the High Court, sitting as the Court of Disputed Returns, had jurisdiction to hear the case. Hill <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> because {{of the structure of}} the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918, the court could not hear the case. She <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> elections could not be disputed by petition if the dispute was about the eligibility of a candidate, as another provision of the Act meant that it would require a resolution of the relevant house of Parliament, the Senate in this case.|$|E

LG Electronics, Inc. Monsanto <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> the license agreement specifically prohibited the use of second-generation seeds for planting.

5|$|British philosopher Richard Swinburne {{proposed}} {{a version of}} the Irenaean theodicy based on his libertarian view of free will, a view that one's free actions are not caused by any outside agent. He <b>argued</b> <b>that,</b> in order for people to make free moral decisions, they must be aware of the consequences of such decisions. Knowledge of these consequences must be based on experience—Swinburne rejected the idea that God could implant such knowledge, arguing that humans would question its reliability. Swinburne <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> humans must have first hand experience of natural evil {{in order to understand the}} consequences of moral evil and that for God to give humans moral free will, he must allow human suffering. Swinburne conceived Hell as being a separation from God, rejecting the notion of eternal physical punishment, and <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> people who had chosen to reject God throughout their lives would continue to do so after death.|$|E

5|$|Chess {{players and}} theoreticians have long debated whether, given perfect play by both sides, the game should {{end in a}} win for White, or a draw. Since {{approximately}} 1889, when World Champion Wilhelm Steinitz addressed this issue, the overwhelming consensus has been that a perfectly played game would end in a draw. However, a few notable players have <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> White's advantage may be sufficient to force a win: Weaver Adams and Vsevolod Rauzer claimed that White is winning after the first move 1.e4, while Hans Berliner <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> 1.d4 may win for White.|$|E

As such, the book <b>argues</b> <b>that</b> the United States does not consider the wider picture of military strategy, which includes legal and economic factors.

5|$|Favorinus <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> it was {{absurd to}} imagine that stars and planets would affect human bodies {{in the same way}} as they affect the tides, and equally absurd that small motions in the heavens cause large changes in people's fates.

5|$|French {{psychoanalyst}} Jacques Lacan linked psychoanalysis with Kantian {{ethics in}} his works The Ethics of Psychoanalysis and Kant avec Sade and compared Kant with the Marquis de Sade.

5|$|In 1969, Lethbridge {{published}} The Monkey's Tail, {{in which}} he discussed Darwinian evolution.

In a sequel published in 1969, The Legend of the Sons of God – A Fantasy?, Lethbridge <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> extraterrestrials had been responsible for aiding Earth's evolutionary development. Echoing many of the claims made by Erich von Däniken in Chariots of the Gods (1968), Lethbridge <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> the late prehistoric stone circles of the British Isles had been beacons for extraterrestrial spacecraft. In this, his work has been cited as an anticipation of the Earth mysteries movement that expanded across Britain in the following decade.|$|E
5|$|In 1976 Lucas wrote a paper criticizing {{large-scale}} Keynesian models {{used for}} forecasting and policy evaluation.

The Lucas's critique went further and <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> a policy's impact {{is determined by}} how the policy alters the expectations of economic agents. No model is stable unless it accounts for expectations and how expectations relate to policy. New classical economists <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> abandoning the disequilibrium models of Keynesianism and focusing on structure- and behavior-based equilibrium models would remedy these faults. Keynesian economists responded by building models with microfoundations grounded in stable theoretical relationships.|$|E
