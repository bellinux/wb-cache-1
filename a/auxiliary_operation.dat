In her role with the foundation, Hedva helped establish a fellowship program in 2015, which focuses on issues of access to Processing software across society. Speaking on the program, Hedva states that “technology can be both a viable artistic medium as well as a model for sociality,” where tools are learned and developed through exploration and collaboration.|$|E

The given work {{considers}} {{the influence of}} the power supply type (diode rectifier DR- 306 and upon new generation inverter Nebula- 315) upon the chemical composition, microstructure, mechanical properties of the weld joints and health characteristics of the manual arc welding process. It has been found out that the power supply type has a significant influence upon the weld joints properties and health characteristics of the manual arc welding process. Using the inverter power supply type provides less heat input into a molten electrode metal drop which decreases silicium and manganese burning, improves impact resistance under low (negative) temperature and reduces the risk of workers respiratory diseases. The reliability of weld joints in metal constructions and technical devices in electrical, oil-producing, mining, chemical, engineering and other industries has a significant impact upon safety and economic efficiency.

40|$|The {{application}} of rolling clement bearings for <b>auxiliary</b> <b>operation</b> in magnetic bearing systems is quite common, yet such operation {{is very different}} to that for which standard bearings are designed. During initial touchdown of a spinning rotor with an auxiliary bearing, rapid acceleration of the bearing inner race results in large inertial and friction forces acting on the rolling elements. Complex dynamic behavior of the bearing assembly and resulting traction forces are difficult to predict but, nonetheless, {{have important implications for}} both rotor dynamic behavior and thermo-elastic behavior of the bearing components. The aim of this work is to obtain an insight into bearing behavior by analyzing component interaction forces that would arise {{based on the assumption that}} the overall bearing traction torque is dependent only on instantaneous load, speed and acceleration. How such an analysis can be verified by experimental measurements of traction during rapid acceleration is discussed and some initial experimental results are presented. The implications for modeling and prediction of rotor-magnetic bearing system behavior during touchdown are also discussed. Copyright © 2006 by ASME...|$|E
40|$|Designing of {{software}} components {{is supported by}} the upcoming version of the Unified Modeling Language (UML 2. 0). Reasoning about component reusability, developing, rebuilding or about possible component composition needs a base for capturing communication of a component with its neighboring components. Port State Machines (an extension of Protocol State Machines) offer precise and detail description of complex communication of components. They model an operation call as two atomic events request and response, which enables to capture interleaving and nesting of operation calls. However, only mathematical definitions determine how to compare these descriptions. UML proposes the Object Constraint Language (OCL) as a specification language for definitions of constraints and operations of UML model elements. This thesis presents an operation defined in OCL which can compare different parts of communication described by Port State Machines. An <b>auxiliary</b> <b>operation</b> defined in OCL which transforms hierarchical Port State Machines to flat final automata is also provided. Moreover, these operations can be evaluated in a UML modeling tool. A straightforward usage is, for instance, a formal reasoning about a correctness of a component implementation with respect to its specification, or checking if a component can be substituted by another specific component in its particular environment. The thesis provides sample instances of Port State Machines. Possible mutual substitution of components described by the instances is discussed according to the results of the presented OCL operation applied on the instances...|$|E
40|$|Cryogenic loop {{heat pipe}} (CLHP) {{is one of}} the key {{components}} in the future space infrared exploration system, which enables effective and efficient cryogenic heat transport over a long distance with a flexible thermal link. To realize reliable and long life operation, a CLHP-based thermal control system with redundancy design was proposed in this work, where two nitrogen-charged CLHPs were employed to provide cryocooling at 80 – 100 K. This study focused on the supercritical startup of the CLHPs with redundancy design, and an extensive experimental study under four possible working modes was conducted. Experimental results showed that with 2. 5 W applied to the secondary evaporator, each CLHP could realize the supercritical startup successfully in the normal working mode; however, the required time differed a lot because the difference in the transport line diameter significantly affected the cryocooling capacity to the primary evaporator. In the backup conversion mode, instant switch of the two primary evaporators may cause an operation failure, and an <b>auxiliary</b> <b>operation</b> of the secondary evaporator in advance was necessary to make the primary liquid line filled with liquid. In the malfunction conversion mode, the simulated infrared detector had to be first shut down, but the time needed for the backup CLHP to realize the supercritical startup became obviously shorter than that in the normal working mode, because the primary evaporator of the backup CLHP was always in a cryogenic state. In the dual operation mode, the two CLHPs could realize the supercritical startup simultaneously, but a temperature oscillation phenomenon was observed, which can be eliminated by increasing the heat load applied to the secondary evaporator...|$|E
