5000|$|Several causes {{have been}} {{attributed}} to Jordan's decision to return to Scotland. Her marriage had failed and she saw herself as an [...] "unwanted child" [...] of Scotland as well as Germany, and as her legal counsel would later claim during her trial, [...] "the name of Jordan had in Germany a Jewish significance." [...] In her 2014 article on Jordan, Rhodri Jeffreys-Jones noted that the hairdressing business that Jordan ran in Hamburg was suffering owing to the predominance of Jewish customers. The implementation of the Nazi's New Order caused another contributing factor to Jordan's move back to Scotland: when her daughter Marga attempted to return to her acting career she was required by German authorities to provide proof of an [...] "Aryan" [...] descent on her mother's side. In July 1937, Jordan told the Glasgow Police <b>Alien</b> Registration <b>Department</b> that she was returning to Scotland to reconnect with her family and to find proof of Marga's aryan descent.|$|R
40|$|Excerpt] Five {{years after}} the September 11, 2001, {{terrorist}} attacks by foreign nationals — including several terrorists on students visas — the security concerns over foreign student visas are being supplanted by competitiveness concerns. Potential foreign students, {{as well as all}} <b>aliens,</b> must satisfy <b>Department</b> of State (DOS) consular officers abroad and immigration inspectors upon entry to the United States that they are not ineligible for visas under the so-called “grounds for inadmissibility” of the Immigration and Nationality Act, which include security and terrorist concerns. The consular officers who process visa applicants are required to check the National Counterterrorism Center’s (NCTC) automated lookout systems before issuing any visa. In part because of these security measures, student visa debates have shifted from security to market-based discussions...|$|R

While deemed critical, especially in making citizenship decisions, A-files are sometimes missing during adjudications. In 2002, naturalization was granted to an alien whose A-file was missing and who was later {{found to be associated}} with a terrorist organization. GAO focused its review on (1) how often USCIS adjudicates naturalization applications without an A-file and why, (2) the effect that missing A-files can have on the adjudication process, and (3) steps taken to help mitigate the risk of missing A-files. To address these questions, GAO interviewed officials and staff from USCIS and reviewed relevant data, policies, and procedures related to processing naturalization applications and the automated file-tracking system DHS established to track the movement of A-files. ...|$|R
25|$|For {{the look}} of <b>aliens,</b> the make-up <b>department</b> collaborated with {{prosthetics}} companies from Vancouver and Los Angeles, including Todd Masters. While the human origins of many alien races and human civilizations were left recognizable, the recurring characters {{who were members of}} the Unas race required elaborate prosthetics and make-up work. To convey the cultural origins of the various fictional human civilizations living on different planets after their displacement from Earth, the costume designers combined elements of their respective Earth cultures with modern fabrics, elaborate trims and chains to produce a historically rooted yet otherworldly appearance. The look of the Goa'uld such as Apophis was initially based on {{the look of}} Ra in the feature film. For the design of the Ori and the Priors in Season 9, the art department looked at Japanese and Samurai garments for costume design. Art director James Robbins found the face painting, scarification and burns of remote jungle tribes mystical and these served as inspiration for the face scarification of the Priors and the Doci. Early ideas to include finger extensions and scarification on these characters' hands were discarded as impracticable.|$|R
