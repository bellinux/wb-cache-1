5|$|From February 1922 the airfield, {{which was}} in use as <b>an</b> <b>emergency</b> <b>landing</b> ground, had an {{illuminated}} T {{as part of the}} illumination of the London-Paris airway. Also at the airfield were coloured lamps connected to an anemometer to indicate wind strength, green for no wind, white for moderate wind and red to indicate strong wind.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} hours of 7 April, three Blenheims of the Yugoslav 8th Bomber Regiment took off from Rovine to bomb the railway {{junction}} at Feldbach, but became disoriented in bad weather.

5|$|On 28 April 2015, the Augsburger Allgemeine, a German {{regional}} daily newspaper, {{published an}} article stating that according to Erich Bäcker, Lützow attempted <b>an</b> <b>emergency</b> <b>landing</b> at Donaumünster/Erlingshofen and crashed into the Danube. Bäcker made his claim based on reports made by eye-witnesses who saw a low flying Me262 crashing into the Danube that day.|$|E
5|$|On 28 January 2008, {{the drive}} shaft of a Danish AW101 broke, leading to <b>an</b> <b>emergency</b> <b>landing</b> at Billund Airport. Following the incident, the Danish fleet was {{grounded}} {{as a precaution}} and the AW101's future was publicly debated. In {{the first six months}} of 2008, the RDAF reported an operational availability of roughly 50%, well below the target of 80%, partly due to an inadequate maintenance organisation and staff shortages.|$|E
5|$|One of Admiral Hippers Arado {{seaplanes}} {{had to make}} <b>an</b> <b>emergency</b> <b>landing</b> in Eide, Norway on 8 April.

Armee (4th Army). Unteroffizier (a non-commissioned officer) Geißhard claimed his first aerial victory, a PWS-26 biplane, that day. The following day, flying his Messerschmitt Bf 109, Geißhardt had to make <b>an</b> <b>emergency</b> <b>landing</b> behind Polish lines. After several hours in Polish captivity, he escaped during the confusion caused by a German Stuka (Dive Bomber) attack. He reached German lines after walking for five days.|$|E
5|$|In 1940, the {{airfield}} {{was occupied by}} the Royal Air Force, who erected Nissen huts and cleared the area of obstacles as {{it was intended to}} use the area as <b>an</b> <b>Emergency</b> <b>Landing</b> Ground. Three pillboxes were erected around {{the airfield}}'s perimeter. Between March and June 1940 the airfield was used by No. 15 Elementary Flying Training School at RAF Redhill as a relief landing ground. Knotley Hall was again requisitioned for use as the officers' quarters, although the tennis courts were off-limits.|$|E
5|$|In the {{meantime}} the horizontal stabilizer {{of the second}} prototype was strengthened and it resumed flying on 20 July. The pilot complained of excess torque pull to the right so the vertical stabilizer was enlarged by , but this {{was just one of}} numerous problems, and it was not ready to pass State acceptance trials without more development work on the powerplant. However, the second prototype continued flight testing until 12 July 1946 when an engine fire forced <b>an</b> <b>emergency</b> <b>landing</b> and it was damaged beyond repair.|$|E
50|$|During World War II, it {{was used}} as <b>an</b> {{unmanned}} <b>emergency</b> <b>landing</b> airfield by Army and Navy aircraft. After the war it was abandoned, and by 1950 was forgotten and unusable.|$|R

The resulting fire caused extensive radioactive contamination, the cleanup (Project Crested Ice) lasting until September of that year. Following closely on the Palomares incident, the cleanup costs and political consequences proved too high to risk again, so SAC ended the airborne alert program the following day.|$|E
5|$|On October 19, 1959, a Boeing 707-227 {{crashed on}} the banks of the Stillaguamish River's North Fork during a test flight, killing four of eight occupants. The plane, being flown by Boeing test pilots instructing {{personnel}} from Braniff International Airways, lost three engines and suffered a fire in the fourth after a dutch roll had been executed beyond maximum bank restrictions. The plane made <b>an</b> <b>emergency</b> <b>landing</b> in the riverbed while unsuccessfully trying to reach a nearby open field.|$|E
25|$|On 22 January 1970, a Vickers Viscount (registration G-AWXI) {{was damaged}} beyond {{economic}} repair at London Heathrow Airport when an engine caught fire on takeoff. <b>A</b> successful <b>emergency</b> <b>landing</b> {{was made at}} Heathrow.|$|R
25|$|This was {{the second}} {{structural}} failure, rapid decompression, and <b>emergency</b> <b>landing</b> for Southwest Airlines in two years. Southwest Airlines Flight 2294, also a 737–300, suffered a football-sized hole in its fuselage on July 13, 2009, in a similar incident. That aircraft also made <b>a</b> safe <b>emergency</b> <b>landing.</b>|$|R

On the flight to Berlin, the aircraft in which he was traveling as a passenger attempted <b>an</b> <b>emergency</b> <b>landing</b> due to an engine failure. It crashed at Breslau, killing Mölders and two others.|$|E
5|$|The V-22's two Rolls-Royce AE 1107C {{engines are}} {{connected}} by drive shafts {{to a common}} central gearbox so that one engine can power both proprotors if an engine failure occurs. Either engine can power both proprotors through the wing driveshaft. However, the V-22 is generally not capable of hovering on one engine. If a proprotor gearbox fails, that proprotor cannot be feathered, and both engines must be stopped before <b>an</b> <b>emergency</b> <b>landing.</b> The V-22's autorotation characteristics are poor partly because the rotors have low inertia.|$|E
5|$|The first {{proposal}} for an airport serving Ny-Ålesund was {{launched by the}} brothers Einar Sverre Pedersen and Gunnar Sverre Pedersen. Einar worked as chief navigator in the Scandinavian Airlines System (SAS) and was instrumental in developing the airline routes over the North Pole. He envisioned that the airport in Svalbard could serve as <b>an</b> <b>emergency</b> <b>landing</b> aerodrome for intercontinental flights, and proposed that the Norwegian trunk airline service be extended to Svalbard.|$|E
