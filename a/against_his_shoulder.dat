500|$|According to Predić, the {{painting}} shows four intoxicated youths {{who have been}} drinking all night walking rowdily through their village around dawn and waking all their neighbours. They trudge {{down the middle of}} the dirt road, keeping their distance from the surrounding houses so as to avoid crashing against a wall and hurting themselves. The gajda (bagpipe) player, the most sober of the four, walks slightly ahead of his friends. The one to the left, the youngest of the group, walks barefoot through the mud and props one of his friends up <b>against</b> <b>his</b> <b>shoulder.</b> The man he is propping up, who is the most intoxicated, paid for the previous night's drinks and bounces between shoulders for support. The man to his right has just realized that he is walking by his own dilapidated home. His mother, alerted by the young men's laughter and song, emerges from the house and recognizes her son. She begins to shout at him and threatens to spank him once he returns, but the young man simply laughs and sends her an acknowledging wave with his hat. A young girl peaks out the bottom pane of the left window of the house to the far right, wondering if her boyfriend is part of the group. A sign above her reads Szeszfőzde ("distillery" [...] in Hungarian). Predić's initials in Cyrillic, У.П., can be found in the bottom-right corner.|$|E
500|$|The {{original}} {{oil painting}} measures [...] It depicts Arsenije leading {{tens of thousands}} of Serbs into exile, riding a horse and flanked by a Serb flag. In direct reference to the Bible, the image is reminiscent to that of Moses leading the chosen people out of Egypt. The irony, Judah notes, is that the Patriarch is leading his people away from their promised land. The Patriarch and four other figures dominate the composition, staggering unevenly across the canvas as opposed to moving in a straight line. [...] "They punctuate the foreground," [...] Filipovitch-Robinson writes, [...] "directing the eye through the diagonals and curves of their bodies and gesture to the next line of figures behind them. Each subsequent line leads to the next." [...] All age groups are represented in the painting, and Jovanović pays special attention to their facial details. Thousands of figures on horseback and on foot appear in the background before eventually receding into the horizon. The left background shows Serbian warriors pointing their lances at the sky while the right background shows lumber wagons carrying families into exile. At the right foreground, an old man herds his sheep. To the right of the Patriarch, a mother and her infant son sit atop a horse carrying their belongings. The woman is the young wife of militia leader Jovan Monasterlija and the child his son. A mustachioed warrior walks before them with swords fastened to his belt and a rifle resting <b>against</b> <b>his</b> <b>shoulder,</b> [...] "striding purposefully into the future". The warrior's right arm is smeared with blood and bound by a white sling.|$|E
60|$|Suddenly she hid {{her face}} <b>against</b> <b>his</b> <b>shoulder</b> with perplexity and shyness. He lay so untrammelled.|$|E
60|$|There was {{no change}} in him. She caught him against her. She pressed her breasts <b>against</b> <b>his</b> <b>shoulders,</b> she kissed <b>his</b> <b>shoulder,</b> through the {{sleeping}} jacket. Her mind wondered, over his rigid, unliving body. She was bewildered, and insistent, only her will was set for him to speak to her.|$|R
60|$|Aaron replied by rubbing <b>his</b> {{forehead}} <b>against</b> <b>his</b> mother's <b>shoulder.</b>|$|R
60|$|She put {{her arms}} round his terrifying, insentient body, and laid her cheek <b>against</b> <b>his</b> hard <b>shoulder.</b>|$|R
60|$|This was her {{moment to}} protest; {{but she was}} silent, with her face <b>against</b> <b>his</b> <b>shoulder.</b>|$|E
60|$|For {{the first}} time his arm stole gently around her. Her golden-bronze head slid restfully <b>against</b> <b>his</b> <b>shoulder.</b>|$|E
60|$|She gave a {{contented}} little sigh, and let {{her head}} rest <b>against</b> <b>his</b> <b>shoulder.</b> He {{knew that he was}} forgiven.|$|E
6000|$|... [He {{takes her}} {{with both hands}} by the waist, she puts her hands [...] <b>against</b> <b>his</b> <b>shoulders</b> to push him of--and {{suddenly}} they are [...] whirling. As they whirl, they bob together once or twice, and [...] kiss. Then, with a warning motion towards the door, she [...] wrenches herself free, and stops beside the picture, trying [...] desperately to appear demure. WELLWYN and ANN have entered. [...] The face has vanished.] ...|$|R
6000|$|... ‘I will do no such thing,’ said Harry cheerfully; {{and having}} paid the fare, he {{followed}} Teresa {{through the door}} which she had opened with her key. The landlady and maid were gone upon their morning errands; the house was empty and still; and as the rattling of the cab died away down Gloucester Street, and Harry continued to ascend the stair with his burthen, he heard close <b>against</b> <b>his</b> <b>shoulders</b> the same faint and muffled ticking as before. The lady, still preceding him, {{opened the door of}} her room, and helped him to lower the box tenderly in the corner by the window.|$|R
50|$|The main armament, as {{in other}} British tanks of the period, was {{balanced}} so that the gunner could control its elevation through a padded shaft <b>against</b> <b>his</b> right <b>shoulder</b> rather than using a geared mechanism. This fitted well with the British doctrine of firing accurately on the move.|$|R
6000|$|Brisket took it with pleased surprise, and the mate, leaning <b>against</b> <b>his</b> <b>shoulder,</b> {{read the}} contents: [...] "Where is the ’Fair Emily’?" ...|$|E
6000|$|She had leaned <b>against</b> <b>his</b> <b>shoulder,</b> {{appearing}} {{to have lost}} all {{sense of right and}} wrong, and, out of her sobbing, gurgled: ...|$|E
6000|$|She {{shook her}} head slowly as she leaned lovingly <b>against</b> <b>his</b> <b>shoulder.</b> 'You are not sorry, Hester, that you have become my wife?' ...|$|E
6000|$|Bobus {{raised the}} white wasted form, and rested the head <b>against</b> <b>his</b> square firm <b>shoulder.</b> [...] "Dear old Bob! This is jolly! I'm not {{cramping}} you?" ...|$|R

Two ranks {{of men in}} rangers' uniforms are seen to the right, each man with a rifle held <b>against</b> <b>his</b> right <b>shoulder.</b> To the left, a long officer can be seen, dressed in a {{different}} uniform. Barracks are visible in the background...|$|R
60|$|Judging {{the season}} ripe, his arm flashed round her, and drew her {{fiercely}} close. For {{a moment she}} was content to yield, her head <b>against</b> <b>his</b> stalwart <b>shoulder,</b> a very woman nestling to the mate of her choice, surrendering to her master. Then the queen in her awoke and strangled nature. Roughly she disengaged herself from his arm, and stood away, her breathing quickened.|$|R
60|$|The chafer buzzed <b>against</b> <b>his</b> <b>shoulder,</b> {{gathered}} flight again, and boomed away. Crocker roused himself, and, {{turning his}} amiable face, jogged Shelton's arm.|$|E
6000|$|... "No, no, Tess," [...] said he quickly. And {{almost before}} she was aware, she was seated {{in his arms and}} resting <b>against</b> <b>his</b> <b>shoulder.</b>|$|E
6000|$|The other turned, {{and without}} seeking {{aid from the}} gun which rested <b>against</b> <b>his</b> <b>shoulder,</b> {{he pointed at the}} several objects he named, and answered-- ...|$|E
60|$|She lay still, thinking, whilst his arm was round her, <b>his</b> head <b>against</b> her <b>shoulders,</b> <b>his</b> body <b>against</b> hers, {{just behind}} her. He was still asleep.|$|R
60|$|But now, little Aaron, {{having become}} {{used to the}} weaver's awful presence, had {{advanced}} to his mother's side, and Silas, seeming to notice {{him for the first}} time, tried to return Dolly's signs of good-will by offering the lad a bit of lard-cake. Aaron shrank back a little, and rubbed <b>his</b> head <b>against</b> <b>his</b> mother's <b>shoulder,</b> but still thought the piece of cake worth the risk of putting his hand out for it.|$|R
6000|$|The {{stranger}} {{came early}} in February, one wintry day, through a biting wind and a driving snow, the last snowfall of the year, over the down, walking from Bramblehurst railway station, {{and carrying a}} little black portmanteau in his thickly gloved hand. He was wrapped up from head to foot, and {{the brim of his}} soft felt hat hid every inch of his face but the shiny tip of his nose; the snow had piled itself <b>against</b> <b>his</b> <b>shoulders</b> and chest, and added a white crest to the burden he carried. He staggered into the [...] "Coach and Horses" [...] more dead than alive, and flung his portmanteau down. [...] "A fire," [...] he cried, [...] "in the name of human charity! A room and a fire!" [...] He stamped and shook the snow from off himself in the bar, and followed Mrs. Hall into her guest parlour to strike his bargain. And with that much introduction, that and a couple of sovereigns flung upon the table, he took up his quarters in the inn.|$|R
60|$|He {{put his arm}} about her, {{and gave}} her a great hug. After that she laid her head <b>against</b> <b>his</b> <b>shoulder,</b> and cried a little; the Judge sighed.|$|E
60|$|The cook (divested of his decorations) and the Marquis lingered for {{a moment}} {{in the shadow of the}} grub wagon. The Marquis leaned her head <b>against</b> <b>his</b> <b>shoulder.</b>|$|E
60|$|She {{leaned her}} head wearily <b>against</b> <b>his</b> <b>shoulder,</b> and her body shivered with {{recurrent}} nervousness. He waited for a {{time for her to}} speak, and then went on.|$|E
60|$|He {{supported}} {{her to the}} coach gravely, gently--her master and still more his own for all that her beautiful loosened hair was <b>against</b> <b>his</b> cheek and <b>shoulder,</b> its perfume in his nostrils, and the contour of her lithe and perfect figure <b>against</b> <b>his</b> own. He helped {{her back into the}} coach, with the aid of the cushions and shawl arranged a reclining couch for her on the back seat, and then resumed his old place patiently. By degrees the color came back to her face--as much of it as was not hidden by her handkerchief.|$|R
6000|$|In his {{presence}} Mary's composure gave way. [...] "O Jack! If he should die now----" [...] She laid her head <b>against</b> <b>his</b> sturdy <b>shoulder</b> {{and for a}} moment shook with nervous weakness. Almost before he could speak she recovered herself. [...] "He only knew me for a few moments. He's delirious again. The doctor is with him--oh, I can't bear to hear him rave! It is awful! He calls for me, and yet does not know me. O Jack, it makes my heart ache so, he is so weak! He came to see me--and then went away--I didn't know where he had gone. And all the time he was starving here. O God! It would be too dreadful--if he should die!" ...|$|R
25|$|To ring a handbell, the ringer moves {{it in such}} a {{way that}} the clapper strikes the inside surface of the bell, usually holding it <b>against</b> <b>his</b> or her <b>shoulder,</b> bell upwards, and then {{swinging}} the bell through an elliptical shape to cause the clapper to strike the casting. The tone of the bell will continue to resonate, decaying naturally until it stops completely or the ringer stops it by damping the bell with a hand or on the body or a padded surface.|$|R
6000|$|... "Do {{not forget}} {{that you are a}} Tudor and a Queen, and remember," [...] he added quaintly, as her head fell <b>against</b> <b>his</b> <b>shoulder,</b> [...] "remember [...] . . . I am only a man!" ...|$|E
60|$|Joe's arm {{was around}} Nell. She had demurred at first, {{but he gave}} no heed to her slight resistance, and finally her head rested <b>against</b> <b>his</b> <b>shoulder.</b> There was no need of words.|$|E
6000|$|... "That is right," [...] Dick said, as {{he placed}} {{her on the}} {{blankets}} before him, and held her with his right arm, with her head <b>against</b> <b>his</b> <b>shoulder.</b> [...] "She is dead asleep." ...|$|E
60|$|Then, indeed, {{the long}} {{practice}} of Deerslayer, as a hunter did him good service. Accustomed to fire with the deer on the bound, and often when the precise {{position of the}} animal's body had in a manner to be guessed at, he used the same expedients here. To cock and poise his rifle were the acts of a single moment and a single motion: then aiming almost without sighting, he fired into the bushes where he knew a body ought to be, in order to sustain the appalling countenance which alone was visible. There was not time to raise the piece any higher, or {{to take a more}} deliberate aim. So rapid were his movements that both parties discharged their pieces at the same instant, the concussions mingling in one report. The mountains, indeed, gave back but a single echo. Deerslayer dropped his piece, and stood with head erect, steady as one of the pines in the calm of a June morning, watching the result; while the savage gave the yell that has become historical for its appalling influence, leaped through the bushes, and came bounding across the open ground, flourishing a tomahawk. Still Deerslayer moved not, but stood with his unloaded rifle fallen <b>against</b> <b>his</b> <b>shoulders,</b> while, with a hunter's habits, his hands were mechanically feeling for the powder-horn and charger. When about forty feet from his enemy, the savage hurled his keen weapon; but it was with an eye so vacant, and a hand so unsteady and feeble, that the young man caught it by the handle as it was flying past him. At that instant the Indian staggered and fell his whole length on the ground.|$|R

5000|$|In an intra-club {{practice}} match {{during the}} 2006-07 off-season, Nicoski severely dislocated <b>his</b> <b>shoulder,</b> {{forcing him to}} miss {{the first half of}} the 2007 season. He returned in round 12 <b>against</b> , but re-injured <b>his</b> <b>shoulder</b> in the next game against [...] He returned to the side in round 22, playing the last three games of the season before returning to Subiaco, where he again played in a premiership. Nicoski played 19 of 22 games in the 2008 season, but was not at his best, and was dropped twice, although he still managed to finish seventh in West Coast's Club Champion Award. He played 13 of the club's first 15 games in 2009, before a groin injury forced him to miss the rest of the season. He returned in round one of the 2010 season, and was switched to a role as a defensive forward, but struggled for form due to <b>his</b> <b>shoulder.</b> He played six games before opting to end his season after round 12 for surgery. He spent the rest of the season as a mentor to other small forwards Gerrick Weedon, Ryan Neates and Lewis Broome, and was awarded the Chris Mainwaring Medal as the Best Clubman at the Eagles' 2010 Club Champion Awards.|$|R
