5|$|Contact with Americans and Europeans in {{the early}} 19th century brought more {{settlers}} to the island, and had a lasting negative ecological effect. On lower slopes, vast tracts of koa–ōhia forest were converted to farmland. Higher up, feral animals that escaped from ranches found refuge in, and damaged extensively, Mauna Kea's native māmane–naio forest. Non-native plants <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> serious threat; there are over 4,600 introduced species on the island, whereas the number of native species is estimated at just 1,000.|$|E

Cannibalism has been reported; kittens may be taken when prey levels are low, but this is very rare and does not much influence the population.|$|E

5|$|The 7.7million day {{visitors}} and 5.5million who made overnight {{stays on the}} Norfolk coast in 1999 are estimated to have spent £122million, and secured the equivalent of 2,325 full-time jobs in that area.

The villages nearest to the Point, Blakeney and Cley, had the highest per capita spend per visitor of those surveyed, and Cley was one of the two sites with the highest proportion of pre-planned visits.
