2500|$|Ianulea's {{only option}} is to flee Bucharest in a haste and escape his creditors. As he rides past Cuțitul de Argint Church, he notices that he is being pursued by armed guards, sent by the Bucharest Aga to lock him into a debtors' prison. He {{abandons}} his horse and runs up a hill and into a vineyard, pleading with the keeper to provide him with shelter. The latter, who presents himself as Negoiță, reluctantly accepts to do so when Ianulea assures him that his pursuers are not boyars. In exchange for his help, Ianulea lets him on his secret identity, and promises to reward him. He explains: [...] "Whenever you hear that the devil's got into a woman, a wife, or a girl, whatever, {{no matter the place}} where they live <b>and</b> <b>no</b> <b>matter</b> <b>what</b> station in life they have, you should know it's about me that they're talking.

2500|$|As {{soon as she}} {{mentions}} them, {{the professors}} of Cambridge and Oxford (except for Christ Church college) rush to her, [...] "Each fierce Logician, still expelling Locke" [...] (196). (John Locke had been censured by Oxford University in 1703, and his Essay on Human Understanding had been banned.) These professors give way to their greatest figure, Richard Bentley, who appears with his Quaker hat on and refuses to bow to Dulness. Bentley tells Dulness that he and critics like him are her true champions, for he had [...] "made Horace dull, and humbled Milton's strains" [...] (212) <b>and,</b> <b>no</b> <b>matter</b> <b>what</b> her enemies do, critics will always serve Dulness, for [...] "Turn what they will to Verse, their toil is vain,/ Critics like me shall make it Prose again" [...] (213–214). Picking fine arguments on letters and single textual variants and correcting authors, he will make all wits useless, and clerics, he says, are the purely dull, though the works of Isaac Barrow and Francis Atterbury might argue otherwise. He {{says that it is}} [...] "For thee explain a thing till all men doubt it,/ And write about it, Goddess, and about it" [...] (251–2). They cement over all wit, throwing stone back onto the figures that authors had chiselled out of marble.

2500|$|Noel {{admits that}} certain {{lines from the}} song are lifted from John Lennon: [...] "I got this tape in the United States that had {{apparently}} been burgled from the Dakota Hotel and someone had found these cassettes. Lennon was starting to record his memoirs on tape. He's going on about 'trying to start a revolution from me bed, because they said the brains I had went to my head.' I thought 'Thank you, I'll take that'!" [...] "Revolution from me bed" [...] most likely refers to Lennon's notorious bed-ins in 1969. The piano in {{the introduction of the}} song strongly resembles Lennon's [...] "Imagine", as well as [...] "Watching the Wheels". As Oasis are often criticised for borrowing parts of other artists' songs for their own, Noel Gallagher commented on the intro's similarity to [...] "Imagine" [...] saying, [...] "In the case of Don't Look Back in Anger – I mean, the opening piano riff's Imagine. 50% of it's put in there to wind people up, and the other 50% is saying 'look, this is how songs like Don't Look Back in Anger come about – because they're inspired by songs like Imagine'. <b>And</b> <b>no</b> <b>matter</b> <b>what</b> people might think, there will be some 13 year old kid out there who'll read an interview and think 'Imagine?
