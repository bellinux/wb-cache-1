Human subjects were first split into a control and experimental group. The control group was presented with letters in a language they did not understand, and non-linguistic visual diagrams. The experimental group was tasked with two activities: the first activity was to remember a string of letters, and was intended activate all elements of the phonological loop.

25|$|Piaget {{administered}} a test in 15 boys with ages ranging from 10 to 14 {{years in which}} he <b>asked</b> <b>participants</b> <b>to</b> describe {{the relationship between a}} mixed bouquet of flowers and a bouquet with flowers of the same color. The {{purpose of this study was}} to analyze the thinking process the boys had and to draw conclusions about the logic processes they had used, which was a psychometric technique of research. Piaget also used the psychoanalytic method initially developed by Sigmund Freud. The purpose of using such method was to examine the unconscious mind, as well as to continue parallel studies using different research methods. Psychoanalysis was later rejected by Piaget, as he thought it was insufficiently empirical (Mayer, 2005).|$|E
25|$|Many {{studies have}} {{observed}} {{the effects of}} volunteerism (as a form of altruism) on happiness and health and have consistently found a strong connection between volunteerism and current and future health and well-being. In a study of older adults, those who volunteered were higher on life satisfaction and will to live, and lower in depression, anxiety, and somatization. Volunteerism and helping behavior have not only been shown to improve mental health, but physical health and longevity as well, attributable to the activity and social integration it encourages. One study examined the physical health of mothers who volunteered over a 30-year period and found that 52% {{of those who did}} not belong to a volunteer organization experienced a major illness while only 36% of those who did volunteer experienced one. A study on adults ages 55+ found that during the four-year study period, people who volunteered for two or more organizations had a 63% lower likelihood of dying. After controlling for prior health status, it was determined that volunteerism accounted for a 44% reduction in mortality. Merely being aware of kindness in oneself and others is also associated with greater well-being. A study that <b>asked</b> <b>participants</b> <b>to</b> count each act of kindness they performed for one week significantly enhanced their subjective happiness.|$|E

2500|$|As {{an example}} of how {{behavioral}} methods can be used in psycholinguistics research, Fischler (1977) investigated word encoding using the lexical decision task. He <b>asked</b> <b>participants</b> <b>to</b> make decisions about whether two strings of letters were English words.

A subset of the licit words were related semantically (e.g., cat-dog) while others were unrelated (e.g., bread-stem). Fischler found that related word pairs were responded to faster when compared to unrelated word pairs. This facilitation suggests that semantic relatedness can facilitate word encoding.|$|E

2500|$|A common {{behavioral}} paradigm involves priming effects, wherein {{participants are}} presented {{first with a}} prime {{and then with a}} target word. [...] The response time for the target word is affected by the relationship between the prime and the target.

2500|$|In {{order for}} thought {{suppression}} and its effectiveness to be studied, researchers {{have had to}} find methods of recording the processes {{going on in the}} mind. One experiment designed with this purpose was performed by Wegner, Schneider, Carter & White. They <b>asked</b> <b>participants</b> <b>to</b> avoid thinking of a specific target (e.g. a white bear) for five minutes, but if they did, they were told then to ring a bell. After this, participants were told that for the next five minutes they were to think about the target. There was evidence that unwanted thoughts occurred more frequently in those who used thought suppression compared to those who were not. Furthermore, there was also evidence that during the second stage, those who had used thought suppression had a higher frequency of target thoughts than did those who hadn't used thought suppression; later coined the rebound effect. This effect has been replicated and can even be done with implausible targets, such as the thought of a [...] "green rabbit". From these implications, Wegner eventually developed the [...] "ironic process theory".|$|E

40|$|Trace eyeblink {{conditioning}} (with a trace interval � 500 msec) {{depends on}} {{the integrity of the}} hippocampus and requires that participants develop awareness of the stimulus contingencies (i. e., awareness that the conditioned stimulus [CS] predicts the unconditioned stimulus [US]). Previous investigations of the relationship between trace eyeblink conditioning and awareness of the stimulus contingencies have manipulated awareness or have assessed awareness at fixed intervals during and after the conditioning session. In this study, we tracked the development of knowledge about the stimulus contingencies trial by trial by <b>asking</b> <b>participants</b> <b>to</b> try to predict either the onset of the US or the onset of their eyeblinks during differential trace eyeblink conditioning. <b>Asking</b> <b>participants</b> <b>to</b> predict their eyeblinks inhibited both the acquisition of awareness and eyeblink conditioning. In contrast, <b>asking</b> <b>participants</b> <b>to</b> predict the onset of the US promoted awareness and facilitated conditioning. Acquisition of knowledge about the stimulus contingencies and acquisition of differential trace eyeblink conditioning developed approximately in parallel (i. e., concurrently).
