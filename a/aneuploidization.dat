40|$|Polyploidization {{results in}} genome {{duplication}} {{and is an}} important step in evolution and speciation. The Malus genome confirmed that this genus was derived through auto-polyploidization, yet the genetic and meiotic mechanisms for polyploidization, particularly for <b>aneuploidization,</b> are unclear in this genus or other woody perennials. In fact the contribution of <b>aneuploidization</b> remains poorly understood throughout Plantae. We add to this knowledge by characterization of eupolyploidization and <b>aneuploidization</b> in 27, 542 F 1 seedlings from seven diploid Malus populations using cytology and microsatellite markers. We provide the first evidence that aneuploidy exceeds eupolyploidy in the diploid crosses, suggesting <b>aneuploidization</b> is a leading cause of genome duplication. Gametes from diploid Malus had a unique combinational pattern; ova preserved euploidy exclusively, while spermatozoa presented both euploidy and aneuploidy. All non-reduced gametes were genetically heterozygous, indicating first-division restitution was the exclusive mode for Malus eupolyploidization and <b>aneuploidization.</b> Chromosome segregation pattern among aneuploids was non-uniform, however, certain chromosomes were associated for <b>aneuploidization.</b> This study is the first to provide molecular evidence for the contribution of heterozygous non-reduced gametes to fitness in polyploids and aneuploids. <b>Aneuploidization</b> can increase, while eupolyploidization may decrease genetic diversity in their newly established populations. Auto-triploidization is important for speciation in the extant Malus. The features of Malus polyploidizatio...|$|E
40|$|High {{expression}} of the mitotic kinase Bub 1 {{is associated with a}} variety of human cancers and correlates with poor clinical prognosis, but whether Bub 1 alone can drive tumorigenesis was unknown. We provided conclusive evidence that Bub 1 has oncogenic properties by generating transgenic mice that overexpress Bub 1 {{in a wide variety of}} tissues, resulting in <b>aneuploidization.</b> Consistently, Bub 1 transgenic mice developed various kinds of spontaneous tumors as well as accelerated Myc-induced lymphomagenesis. While the mitotic checkpoint was robust in Bub 1 overexpressing cells, misaligned and lagging chromosomes were observed. These defects originated from increased Aurora B activity and could be suppressed by inhibition of Aurora B. Taken together, this indicates that Bub 1 has oncogenic properties and imply that <b>aneuploidization</b> and tumorigenesis result from Aurora B-dependent missegregation. Here, we focus on the complex relationship between Bub 1 and Aurora B and discuss the broader implications of Bub 1 -dependent Aurora B activation in mediating error correction...|$|E
40|$|High {{expression}} of the protein kinase Bub 1 has been observed {{in a variety of}} human tumors and often correlates with poor clinical prognosis, but its molecular and cellular consequences and role in tumorigenesis are unknown. Here, we demonstrate that over{{expression of}} Bub 1 in mice leads to near-diploid aneuploidies and tumor formation. We found that chromosome misalignment and lagging are the primary mitotic errors responsible for the observed <b>aneuploidization.</b> High Bub 1 levels resulted in aberrant Bub 1 kinase activity and hyperactivation of Aurora B kinase. When Aurora B activity is suppressed, pharmacologically or via BubR 1 overexpression, chromosome segregation errors caused by Bub 1 overexpression are largely corrected. Importantly, Bub 1 transgenic mice overexpressing Bub 1 developed various kinds of spontaneous tumors and showed accelerated Myc-induced lymphomagenesis. Our results establish that Bub 1 has oncogenic properties and suggest that Aurora B is a critical target through which overexpressed Bub 1 drives <b>aneuploidization</b> and tumorigenesis...|$|E
40|$|Aneuploidy is {{ubiquitous}} in cancer, and its phenotypes are inevitably dominant and abnormal. In view of these facts we recently proposed that aneuploidy {{is sufficient for}} carcinogenesis generating cancer-specific aneusomies via a chain reaction of autocatalytic <b>aneuploidizations.</b> According to this hypothesis a carcinogen initiates carcinogenesis via a random aneuploidy. Aneuploidy then generates transformation stage-specific aneusomies and further random aneusomies autocatalytically, because it renders chromosome segregation and repair mechanisms error-prone. The hypothesis predicts that several specific aneusomies can cause the same cancers, because several chromosomes also cooperate in normal differentiation. Here we describe experiments on the Chinese hamster (CH) that confirm this hypothesis. (i) Random aneuploidy was detected before transformation in up to 90 % of CH embryo cells treated with the carcinogen nitrosomethylurea (NMU). (ii) Several specific aneusomies were found in 70 – 100 % of the aneuploid cells from colonies transformed with NMU in vitro and from tumors generated by NMU-transformed cells in syngeneic animals. Among the aneuploid in vitro transformed cells, 79 % were trisomic for chromosome 3, and 59 % were monosomic for chromosome 10, compared with 8 % expected for random distribution of any aneusomy among the 12 CH chromosomes. Moreover, 52 % shared both trisomy 3 and monosomy 10 compared with 0. 6 % expected for random distribution of any two aneusomies. Among the tumor cells, 65 % were trisomic for chromosome 3, 51 % were trisomic for chromosome 5, and 30 % shared both trisomies. Aneuploid cells without these specific aneusomies may contain minor transformation-specific aneusomies or may be untransformed. (iii) Random aneusomies and structurally altered chromosomes increased with the generations of transformed cells {{to the point where}} their origins became unidentifiable in tumors. We conclude that specific aneusomies are necessary for carcinogenesis...|$|R

40|$|Defects in {{the spindle}} {{assembly}} checkpoint {{are thought to}} be responsible for an increased rate of <b>aneuploidization</b> during tumorigenesis. Despite a plethora of information on the correlation between BUB-MAD gene expression levels and defects in the spindle checkpoint, very little is known about alteration of another important spindle checkpoint protein, Cdc 20, in human cancer and its role in tumor aneuploidy. We observed overexpression of CDC 20 in several oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) cell lines and primary head and neck tumors and provide evidence that such overexpression of CDC 20 is associated with premature anaphase promotion, resulting in mitotic abnormalities in OSCC cell lines. We also reconstituted the chromosomal instability phenotype in a chromosomally stable OSCC cell line by overexpressing CDC 20. Thus, abnormalities in the cellular level of Cdc 20 may deregulate the timing of anaphase promoting complex (APC/C) in promoting premature anaphase, which often results in aneuploidy in the tumor cells...|$|E
40|$|The spindle {{assembly}} checkpoint (SAC) is a genome surveillance mechanism that protects against <b>aneuploidization.</b> Despite profound progress on understanding mechanisms of its activation, it remains unknown what aspect of chromosome-spindle interactions is {{monitored by the}} SAC: kinetochore-microtubule attachment or the force generated by dynamic microtubules that signals stable biorientation of chromosomes? To answer this, we uncoupled these two processes by expressing a non-phosphorylatable version of the main microtubule-binding protein at kinetochores (HEC 1 - 9 A), causing stabilization of incorrect kinetochore-microtubule attachments despite persistent activity of the error-correction machinery. The SAC is fully functional in HEC 1 - 9 A-expressing cells, yet cells in which chromosomes cannot biorient but are stably attached to microtubules satisfy the SAC and exit mitosis. SAC satisfaction requires neither intra-kinetochore stretching nor dynamic microtubules. Our findings {{support the hypothesis that}} in human cells the end-on interactions of microtubules with kinetochores are sufficient to satisfy the SAC without the need for microtubule-based pulling forces...|$|E
40|$|The mitotic {{checkpoint}} protein Bub 1 {{is essential}} for embryogenesis and survival of proliferating cells, and bidirectional deviations from its normal level of expression cause chromosome missegregation, aneuploidy, and cancer predisposition in mice. To {{provide insight into the}} physiological significance of this critical mitotic regulator at a modular level, we generated Bub 1 mutant mice that lack kinase activity using a knockin gene-targeting approach that preserves normal protein abundance. In this paper, we uncover that Bub 1 kinase activity integrates attachment error correction and mitotic checkpoint signaling by controlling the localization and activity of Aurora B kinase through phosphorylation of histone H 2 A at threonine 121. Strikingly, despite substantial chromosome segregation errors and <b>aneuploidization,</b> mice deficient for Bub 1 kinase activity do not exhibit increased susceptibility to spontaneous or carcinogen-induced tumorigenesis. These findings provide a unique example of a modular mitotic activity orchestrating two distinct networks that safeguard against whole chromosome instability and reveal the differential importance of distinct aneuploidy-causing Bub 1 defects in tumor suppression...|$|E
40|$|BubR 1 {{is a key}} {{component}} of the spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC). Mutations that reduce BubR 1 abundance cause <b>aneuploidization</b> and tumorigenesis in humans and mice, whereas BubR 1 overexpression protects against these. However, how supranormal BubR 1 expression exerts these beneficial physiological impacts is poorly understood. Here, we used Bub 1 b mutant transgenic mice to explore the role of the amino-terminal (BubR 1 (N)) and internal (BubR 1 (I)) Cdc 20 -binding domains of BubR 1 in preventing aneuploidy and safeguarding against cancer. BubR 1 (N) was necessary, but not sufficient to protect against aneuploidy and cancer. In contrast, BubR 1 lacking the internal Cdc 20 -binding domain provided protection against both, which coincided with improved microtubule-kinetochore attachment error correction and SAC activity. Maximal SAC reinforcement occurred when both the Phe- and D-box of BubR 1 (I) were disrupted. Thus, while under- or overexpression of most mitotic regulators impairs chromosome segregation fidelity, certain manipulations of BubR 1 can positively impact this process and therefore be therapeutically exploited...|$|E
40|$|There {{is growing}} {{evidence}} that duplications {{have played a}} major role in eucaryotic genome evolution. Sequencing data revealed the presence of large duplicated regions in the genomes of many eucaryotic organisms, and comparative studies have suggested that duplication of large DNA segments has been a continuing process during evolution. However, little experimental data have been produced regarding this issue. Using a gene dosage assay for growth recovery in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, we demonstrate that a majority of the revertant strains (58 %) resulted from the spontaneous duplication of large DNA segments, either intra- or interchromosomally, ranging from 41 to 655 kb in size. These events result in the concomitant duplication of dozens of genes and in some cases in the formation of chimeric open reading frames at the junction of the duplicated blocks. The types of sequences at the breakpoints as well as their superposition with the replication map suggest that spontaneous large segmental duplications result from replication accidents. <b>Aneuploidization</b> events or suppressor mutations that do not involve large-scale rearrangements accounted for the rest of the reversion events (in 26 and 16 % of the strains, respectively) ...|$|E

The deubiqituinase USP 44 {{was identified as a}} key regulator of APC/C and has been proposed to suppress Cdc 20 -APC/C activity by maintaining its association with the inhibitory protein Mad 2 until all chromosomes are properly attached to the mitotic spindle. However, this notion has been challenged by data in which a lysine-less mutant of Cdc 20 leads to premature anaphase, suggesting that it’s ubiquitination is not required for APC/C activation. To further evaluate its role in checkpoint function and chromosome instability, we studied the consequences of over-expression of mouse Usp 44 in non-transformed murine embryonic fibroblasts. Here we show that cells with high Usp 44 are prone to chromosome segregation errors and <b>aneuploidization.</b> We find that high Usp 44 promotes association of Mad 2 with Cdc 20 and reinforces the mitotic checkpoint. Surprisingly, the APC/C-Cdc 20 substrate cyclin B 1 is stabilized in G 2 when Usp 44 is over-expressed, but is degraded with normal kinetics once cells enter mitosis. Furthermore, we show that USP 44 expression is elevated in subset of T-cell leukemias. These data are consistent with an important role for USP 44 in regulating Cdc 20 -APC/C activit...|$|E

40|$|The current {{literature}} is devoid of a clearcut definition of mitotic catastrophe, {{a type of}} cell death that occurs during mitosis. Here, we propose that mitotic catastrophe results {{from a combination of}} deficient cell-cycle checkpoints (in particular the DNA structure checkpoints and the spindle assembly checkpoint) and cellular damage. Failure to arrest the cell cycle before or at mitosis triggers an attempt of aberrant chromosome segregation, which culminates in the activation of the apoptotic default pathway and cellular demise. Cell death occurring during the metaphase/anaphase transition is characterized by the activation of caspase- 2 (which can be activated in response to DNA damage) and/or mitochondrial membrane permeabilization with the release of cell death effectors such as apoptosis-inducing factor and the caspase- 9 and- 3 activator cytochrome c. Although the morphological aspect of apoptosis may be incomplete, these alterations constitute the biochemical hallmarks of apoptosis. Cells that fail to execute an apoptotic program in response to mitotic failure are likely to divide asymmetrically in the next round of cell division, with the consequent generation of aneuploid cells. This implies that disabling of the apoptotic program may actually favor chromosomal instability, through the suppression of mitotic catastrophe. Mitotic catastrophe thus may be conceived as a molecular device that prevents <b>aneuploidization,</b> which may participate in oncogenesis. Mitotic catastrophe is controlled by numerous molecular players, in particular, cell-cycle-specific kinases (such as the cyclin B 1 -dependent kinase Cdk 1, polo-like kinases and Aurora kinases), cell-cycle checkpoint proteins, survivin, p 53, caspases and members of the Bcl- 2 family...|$|E

ODFs, OPMLs without and with dysplasia and OSCCs were investigated by high resolution DNA content flow cytometry (FCM). ODFs and OPMLs without dysplasia were DNA aneuploid respectively in 7 / 82 (8. 5 %) and 25 / 109 (23 %) cases. “True normal oral mucosa” and human lymphocytes from healthy donors were DNA diploid in all cases and were used as sex specific DNA diploid controls. Dysplastic OPMLs and OSCCs were DNA aneuploid in 12 / 26 (46 %) and 12 / 13 (92 %) cases. The DNA aneuploid sublines were characterized by the DNA Index (DI ≠ 1). Aneuploid sublines in ODFs and in non-dysplastic and dysplastic OPMLs were near-diploid (DI < 1. 4) respectively in all, 2 / 3 and 1 / 3 of the cases. DNA aneuploid OSCCs, instead, were characterized prevalently by multiple aneuploid sublines (67 %), which were commonly (57 %) high-aneuploid (DI ≥ 1. 4). DNA near-diploid aneuploid sublines in ODFs and OPMLs appear as early events of the oral carcinogenesis in agreement with the concept of field effect. Near-diploid <b>aneuploidization</b> is likely to reflect mechanisms of loss of symmetry in the chromosome mitotic division.

With more severe stages a decrease of disomy was observed, merely due to a gain of extra copies of chromosome 1; in some cases, however, monosomy was detected. The frequencies of disomy for chromosome 1 ranged from 65. 3 % to 95. 0 % in the controls, from 71. 3 % to 94. 3 % in CIN I, from 59. 2 % to 91. 5 % in CIN II, and from 23 % to 96. 2 % in CIN III. Polysomy ranged from 0 % to 5. 7 % in the controls, from 0 % to 14. 4 % in CIN I, from 0. 9 % to 30. 8 % in CIN II, and from 0. 8 % to 69. 6 % in CIN III.

40|$|The spindle {{assembly}} checkpoint (SAC) is a genome surveillance mechanism that protects against <b>aneuploidization.</b> Over the years, {{through a combination}} ofcell biology, evolutionary analysis and top-of-the-nudge biochemical techniques, significant progress has been achieved in unravelling and understanding the molecular mechanisms supporting the SAC. Here, we explore some of the open questions regarding the mechanisms of SAC silencing. We focus on the kinetochore and provide novel insights into how microtubule attachments lead to SAC silencing. We investigate what aspect of chromosome-spindle interactions the SAC actually monitors: the kinetochore-microtubule attachment or the force generated by dynamic microtubules that signals stable biorientation of chromosomes? We manipulate the microtubule-binding affinity of the kinetochore to distinguish between these aspects and show that kinetochore-microtubule attachments are sufficient to silence the SAC effectively. To explore the mechanisms that drive attachment-induced silencing, we review and discuss the current views and research on the molecular changes in the kinetochore that are evoked by microtubule attachments. Deep understanding of these processes is essential for unravelling the mechanisms of SAC signalling and silencing. In addition, we argue for incorporating holistic views of kinetochore dynamics {{in order to understand}} SAC silencing. To investigate our proposed hypothesis, we investigate if SAC silencing requires maximum microtubule occupancy at kinetochores, and how the various molecular events of SAC activation and silencing respond to intermediate occupancy states. To this end, we combine quantitative analysis of levels of SAC proteins on single kinetochores, with manipulations of the microtubule-binding affinity of the kinetochore. We show that SAC proteins are responsive to intermediate microtubule occupancy states and that they separate in two modules of response. Moreover, we find that half-maximal occupancy is sufficient to remove all SAC proteins from kinetochores and silence the SAC. In the final part of this thesis, we introduce a new model system into the field that potentially could help understand diversity in the biology of mitotic processes. We make an effort to understand the diversity of mitotic processes and structures found throughout evolution. We develop basic assays for studying mitosis in U. maydis, identify and visualize homologs of mitotic proteins, and find protein-protein interactions between known mitotic binding partners. In the future, U. maydis can be used alongside other model species to uncover and understand the diversity of SAC signalling...|$|E
40|$|In recent time {{breast cancer}} {{has become the}} most common form of female cancer in the western world. It has been {{estimated}} that the lifetime risk of women falling ill from the disease is 10 %. The number of patients diagnosed each year has been increasing steadily since the 1970 s. In 2002 the number of Swedish women diagnosed with breast cancer was 6, 600, constituting every third female cancer diagnosed. Little is known about the order of appearance of different types of genetic aberrations, how they relate to each other, what their role is in the defining the clinical outcome of the patient, and which aberrations underlie therapy resistance. A comparative study between cytogenetics and CGH was conducted in 29 invasive breast cancers (paper I). The differences seen in the comparison of cytogenetic and CGH karyotyping can best be explained by the difficulties of culturing breast carcinoma cells in vitro. The gains and losses found by CGH may represent the predominant (often aneuploid) clone, whereas the G-banding karyotypes represents minor abnormal, near-diploid cell clone(s), which, for unknown reasons, has a growth advantage in short term culture. To explore the order of appearance of genetic aberrations in a direct manner, tumor cells from 21 non-diploid breast carcinomas were sorted for their DNA content by flow cytometry, and then analyzed separately by FISH (paper II). Data from these uncultured interphase cells showed that oncogene amplification, which is biologically and prognostically a very important genetic defect in breast cancer, takes place already before <b>aneuploidization.</b> The simultaneous presence of diploid and non-diploid malignant cells is also a clear indication of heterogeneity in the genetic composition of breast carcinoma. In order to shed light on how copy number aberrations (CNA) patterns are composed, a CGH analysis of 305 breast cancer tumors was conducted (paper III). Two different statistical approaches were able to identify the exact same CNA pattern groups, indicating that the groups are true biological entities, rather than reflection of the statistical modeling technique used. These different groups were correlated to distinct clinicopathological features and patient prognosis, and could predict patient outcome just as well as the traditional prognostic factors. In paper IV, characterization of the new and intrinsically Herceptin® resistant cell line JIMT- 1, revealed an aberration pattern characteristic for aggressive breast cancers. Molecular cytogenetic techniques revealed numerous regions of CNA. Many of the genes in the aberrant regions are implicated in cancer development and drug/hormone metabolizing. In conclusion, the results from the studies presented herein, indicate that the genetic aberrations of breast cancer are complex, and not detected by conventional cytogenetic techniques. Implementation of molecular cytogenetic techniques in a large breast cancer material, identified specific patterns of aberrations, and these patterns are linked to patient prognosis.

APC/CCDC 20 is negatively regulated by spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC) that ensures accurate segregation of chromosomes during mitosis. SAC comprises MAD and BUB family of proteins which sense lack of tension at improperly attached or unattached kinetochores of metaphase chromosomes. Upon prevalence of errors in kinetochore-spindle attachment, SAC assembles at the unattached kinetochores and generates a ―wait anaphase‖ signal. At the molecular level, an activated SAC sequesters Cdc 20 into an inhibitory complex known as Mitotic Checkpoint Complex (MCC) which inhibits APC/C and pauses cells in mitosis till the kinetochore attachment errors get rectified. Upon amphitellic kinetochore-spindle attachment, MCC is disassembled by APC/C-UbcH 10 mediated ubiquitination following which Cdc 20 associates with APC/C and catalyses mitotic progression of cells. UbcH 10 thus plays {{a pivotal role in}} mitotic regulation. Interestingly, UbcH 10 is found {{to be one of the}} majorly deregulated proteins in most cancer types with no reported mutation or polymorphisms. Thus functional regulation of UbcH 10 through proteasomal degradation is well studied but its transcriptional regulation is scarcely touched upon. The key role of UbcH 10 in mitotic progression thus triggers interest in studying its transcriptional regulation in intricate details. Previous work from our lab reported a novel transcriptional regulatory role of Cdc 20. Cdc 20 -APC/C-CBP complex upregulates UbcH 10 through E 2 F 1 -DP 1 heterodimer. E 2 F 1 was observed to regulate UbcH 10 expression in cell cycle dependent manner. Interestingly, Retinoblastoma (Rb) was observed to antagonize UbcH 10 expresion. Rb and E 2 F 1 exhibited mutually exclusive regulation of UbcH 10 in G 1 and G 2 /M phases of cell cycle respectively. Further, deregulated Rb-E 2 F 1 pathway, through altered UbcH 10 expression, contributed significantly to premature mitosis culminating in chromosomal errors and genomic instability. We thus explored a new facet of Rb functionality-its role in regulation of mitosis. UBCH 10 expression is turned off during G 1 phase. Rb, the master tumour suppressor, plays a pivotal role in this respect. Rb mediates its function by suppression of UbcH 10 expression in G 1 phase through the suppressive E 2 F family member-E 2 F 4. The dissertation has explored that there is a novel dual suppressive complex involving Rb-E 2 F 4 and DREAM which mediates UBCH 10 repression. Rb and E 2 F 4 collaborate to suppress UbcH 10 expression through chromatin modifications. The negative control of UbcH 10 monitors cellular proliferation which gets significantly enhanced in cancer progression due to inactivation of Rb. We further explored the novel chromatin modifying role of Anaphase promoting complex/Cyclosome(APC/C). APC/C was found to modulate UbcH 10 expression in G 2 /M phase through alteration in ubiquitination status of histone 2 B.. H 2 B ubiquitination in conjuction with altered H 3 acetylation changes the chromatin dynamics. The chromatin alterations hence potentially help in driving the expression of UbcH 10 and has strong implications in monitoring of temporal mitotic division of duplicated chromosomes. Thus the thesis aims to explore the mechanistic regulation of mitosis through transcriptional pathwaysusing UbcH 10 as a model gene of study...|$|E
