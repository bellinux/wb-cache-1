25|$|Block I AGC {{memory was}} {{organized}} into 1 kiloword banks. The lowest bank (bank 0) was erasable memory (RAM). All banks above bank 0 were fixed memory (ROM). Each AGC instruction had a 12-bit <b>address</b> <b>field.</b> The lower bits (1-10) addressed the memory inside each bank. Bits 11 and 12 selected the bank: 00 selected the erasable memory bank; 01 selected the lowest bank (bank 1) of fixed memory; 10 selected {{the next one}} (bank 2); and 11 selected the Bank register {{that could be used}} to select any bank above 2. Banks 1 and 2 were called fixed-fixed memory, because they were always available, regardless of the contents of the Bank register. Banks 3 and above were called fixed-switchable because the selected bank was determined by the bank register.|$|E

500|$|After his War College graduation, McNair was {{assigned}} as assistant commandant of the Field Artillery Center and School. [...] In this position, {{he worked with}} the school's Gunnery Department to <b>address</b> <b>field</b> artillery doctrine issues that had lingered since World War I, including limited mobility, inadequate communications, and overly detailed fire direction techniques. [...] Successive Gunnery Department directors Jacob Devers, Carlos Brewer, and Orlando Ward recognized that continuing improvement to innovations including machine guns and tanks made the static trench warfare of World War I unlikely to be repeated. [...] As a result, they experimented with new techniques, including increasing the speed of artillery support to mobile armor and infantry by empowering Artillery-qualified fire support officers attached to those formations to direct artillery fire. [...] In addition, they pioneered techniques to enhance accuracy, including forward observers who could direct rounds onto targets based on seeing their impact, rather than the unobserved timed fire and rolling barrages that had prevailed in World War I. [...] McNair supported these innovations, and prevented interference from senior officers who tried to block them.|$|E
2500|$|A pbit of 1 {{indicates}} {{the presence of}} the block. [...] In this case, the block can be accessed via the physical address in the descriptor. [...] If the pbit is zero, an interrupt is generated for the MCP (operating system) to make the block present. [...] If the <b>address</b> <b>field</b> is zero, this is the first access to this block, and it is allocated (an init pbit). [...] If the <b>address</b> <b>field</b> is non-zero, it is a disk address of the block, which has previously been rolled out, so the block is fetched from disk and the pbit is set to one and the physical memory address updated to point to the block in memory (another pbit). [...] This makes descriptors equivalent to a page-table entry in an MMU system. System performance can be monitored through the number of pbits. [...] Init pbits indicate initial allocations, but a high level of other pbits indicate that the system may be thrashing.|$|E
2500|$|This is {{a special}} form of read cycle implicitly {{addressed}} to the interrupt controller, which returns an interrupt vector. [...] The 32-bit <b>address</b> <b>field</b> is ignored. [...] One possible implementation is to generate an interrupt acknowledge cycle on an ISA bus using a PCI/ISA bus bridge. [...] This command is for IBM PC compatibility; {{if there is no}} Intel 8259 style interrupt controller on the PCI bus, this cycle need never be used.|$|E

30|$|Forwarding is {{the process}} {{executed}} by each mesh STA when receiving a frame whose final destination is not itself. In the context of IEEE 802.11 s networks, it comprises the modification of the appropriate <b>address</b> <b>fields</b> and the re-transmission of the frame to the next hop in {{the path to the}} final destination. In DCRP, to determine the appropriate values of the <b>address</b> <b>fields,</b> a mesh STA must perform a lookup for the destination in any of the forwarding tables it maintains.|$|R

2500|$|Blocks can {{be shared}} between {{processes}} via copy descriptors in the process stack. [...] Thus, some processes may have write permission, whereas others do not. [...] A code segment is read only, thus reentrant and shared between processes. [...] Copy descriptors contain a 20-bit <b>address</b> <b>field</b> giving index of the master descriptor in the master descriptor array. [...] This also implements a very efficient and secure IPC mechanism. [...] Blocks can easily be relocated, since only the master descriptor needs update when a block's status changes.|$|E
2500|$|This {{cycle is}} a special {{broadcast}} write of system events that PCI card may be interested in. [...] The <b>address</b> <b>field</b> of a special cycle is ignored, but it {{is followed by a}} data phase containing a payload message. [...] The currently defined messages announce that the processor is stopping for some reason (e.g. to save power). [...] No device ever responds to this cycle; it is always terminated with a master abort after leaving the data on the bus for at least 4 cycles.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Address</b> <b>Field.</b> Each <b>address</b> <b>field</b> may occupy either octet 2 to 3, octet 2 to 4, or octet 2 to 5, {{depending}} on {{the range of the}} address in use.

50|$|An 802.11 frame {{can have}} up to four <b>address</b> <b>fields.</b> Each field can carry a MAC address. Address 1 is the receiver, Address 2 is the transmitter, Address 3 is used for {{filtering}} purposes by the receiver.|$|R
30|$|RDATA (Relay Data): like a DATA frame, the <b>Address</b> 1 <b>field</b> {{contains}} the <b>address</b> of the receiver, the <b>Address</b> 2 <b>field</b> {{contains the}} <b>address</b> of the sender, and the <b>Address</b> 3 <b>field</b> contains the BSSID. On the first hop, for example, Address 1 holds {{the address of}} the relay and Address 2 holds {{the address of the}} AP. Likewise on the second hop, Address 1 holds the address of the relay and Address 2 holds the address of the destination node. The <b>Address</b> 4 <b>field,</b> not used in regular DATA frames unless the To DS and From DS bits are both set, is used in RDATA to hold the address of the destination node for both hops.|$|R

30|$|Similar to {{the null}} data packet (NDP) {{announcement}} frame of 802.11 ac, APs broadcast a control frame, B_frame, of 25 bytes. This frame contains a 6 -byte {{field for the}} transmitter address (i.e., AP) and separate <b>address</b> <b>fields</b> {{for a set of}} multiple station information records used to request multi-user feedback. Most importantly, APs assign association identifications (AIDs) to the clients upon association which are included inside the 12 least significant bits (LSB) of station information (STA info).|$|R
50|$|This {{pattern is}} {{followed}} by up to 256 16-bit data frames. Each data frame consists of a start bit of 1, an 8-bit data field, a 3-bit station address, and an even parity bit (which includes the start bit, so it equivalent to odd parity over the data and <b>address</b> <b>fields</b> only). This is then followed by three or more fill bits of 0. Unusually for an IBM protocol, the bits within each frame are sent lsbit-first.|$|R
5000|$|The {{communications}} protocol works in two modes: standard and extended. The primary {{difference between the}} two modes is that the extended mode adds source and destination <b>address</b> <b>fields</b> to the frame. The standard frame mode would normally be used in the case where there is only one piece of exercise equipment attached to one computer. This mode is primarily useful in a home setting where there is only one piece of exercise equipment and one controlling computer.|$|R
