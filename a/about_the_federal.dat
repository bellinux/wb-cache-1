He wrote a series of {{articles}} <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>federal</b> government and the presidency which were republished in 1897 as a book titled This Country of Ours. In 1896, Harrison at age 62 remarried, to Mary Scott Lord Dimmick, the widowed 37-year-old niece and former secretary of his deceased wife. Harrison's two adult children, Russell, 41 years old at the time, and Mary (Mamie) McKee, 38, disapproved of the marriage and did not attend the wedding. Benjamin and Mary had one child together, Elizabeth (February 21, 1897– December 26, 1955).|$|E

25|$|One of Polk's last acts as President was to {{sign the}} bill {{creating}} the Department of the Interior (March 3, 1849). This was the first new cabinet position created {{since the early days}} of the Republic. Polk had misgivings <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>federal</b> government usurping power over public lands from the states; however, the delivery of the legislation on his last full day in office gave him no time to find constitutional grounds for a veto, or to draft a sufficient veto message, so Polk signed the bill.|$|E
25|$|In June 2004, a Federal {{court ruled}} that Schiff was liable for over $2 million in taxes, {{penalties}} and interest for the years 1979 through 1985. In that case, Schiff's attorney had filed a brief claiming a diminished capacity defense, contending that Schiff {{had been diagnosed with}} a chronic, severe delusional disorder relating to his beliefs <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>federal</b> income tax system. That was characterized by some of his opponents as a claim that those beliefs were the product of a delusion or even insanity and that Schiff had willingly allowed his defense counsel to raise such an argument.|$|E
25|$|From the {{beginning}} of his term, Bush faced the problem of what to do <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>federal</b> budget debt. At $2.8trillion in 1990, the deficit had grown to three times larger than it was in 1980. Bush was dedicated to curbing the deficit, believing that America could not continue to be a leader in the world without doing so. He began an effort to persuade the Democratic controlled Congress to act on the budget; with Republicans believing that the best way was to cut government spending, and Democrats convinced that the only way would be to raise taxes, consensus building proved difficult.|$|E

25|$|The public's concern <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>federal</b> {{budget deficit}} {{and fears of}} {{professional}} politicians allowed the independent candidacy of billionaire Texan Ross Perot to explode {{on the scene in}} dramatic fashion—at one point Perot was leading the major party candidates in the polls. Perot crusaded against the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), and internal and external national debt, tapping into voters' potential fear of the deficit. His volunteers succeeded in collecting enough signatures to get his name on the ballot in all 50 states. In June, Perot led the national public opinion polls with support from 39% of the voters (versus 31% for Bush and 25% for Clinton). Perot severely damaged his credibility by dropping out of the presidential contest in July and remaining out of the race for several weeks before re-entering. He compounded this damage by eventually claiming, without evidence, that his withdrawal was due to Republican operatives attempting to disrupt his daughter's wedding.|$|E
500|$|The October state {{elections}} in Ohio and Indiana resulted in Republican victories there, discouraging Democrats <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>federal</b> election to come the following month. There was even some talk among party leaders of dropping English from the ticket, but English convinced {{them that the}} October losses owed more to local issues, and that the Democratic ticket could still carry Indiana, if not Ohio, in November. [...] In the end, English was proven wrong: the Democrats and Hancock failed to carry any of the Midwestern states they had targeted, including Indiana. [...] Hancock and English lost the popular vote by just 7,018. The electoral vote, however, had a much larger spread: 214 for Garfield and Arthur, compared to 155 for Hancock and English.|$|E
500|$|Smith {{was one of}} the few {{to raise}} the {{independence}} issue at this time, according to his memoirs because his [...] "instinct and training told me to be prepared for every contingency". During the Federation debate in the House of Assembly, he posited that since Southern Rhodesia was effectively choosing Federation over independence, a clause should be inserted into the bill guaranteeing Southern Rhodesia dominion status in the event of a Federal break-up. The United Party rejected this on the grounds that the Federation had to be declared indissoluble so it could raise loans. Smith was uncertain <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>Federal</b> project, but publicly supported it after the mostly white electorate approved it in a referendum in April 1953. He told the Rhodesia Herald that now it had been decided to pursue Federation, it was in Southern Rhodesia's best interests for everybody to try to make it succeed. He and other Rhodesia Party politicians joined the new Federal Party, headed by Huggins and Northern Rhodesia's Sir Roy Welensky, on 29 April 1953.|$|E

500|$|Defeated at Richmond, Mason {{returned}} to Gunston Hall, where he devoted himself {{to family and}} local affairs, though still keeping up a vigorous correspondence with political leaders. He resigned from the Fairfax County Court after an act passed by the new Congress required officeholders {{to take an oath}} to support the constitution, and in 1790 declined a seat in the Senate which had been left vacant by William Grayson's death, stating that his health would not permit him to serve, even if he had no other objection. The seat went to James Monroe, who had supported Mason's Anti-Federalist stance, and who had, in 1789, lost to Madison for a seat in the House of Representatives. Judging by his correspondence, Mason softened his stance towards the new federal government, telling Monroe that the constitution [...] "wisely & Properly directs" [...] that ambassadors be confirmed by the Senate. Although Mason predicted that the amendments to be proposed to the states by the First Congress would be [...] "Milk & Water Propositions", he displayed [...] "much Satisfaction" [...] at what became the Bill of Rights (ratified in 1791) and wrote that if his concerns <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>federal</b> courts and other matters were addressed, [...] "I could cheerfully put my Hand & Heart to the new Government".|$|E

2500|$|Another problem soon arosethat of {{determining}} how {{and to whom}} to disseminate the extraordinary information Gardner was developing.

By 1946, SIS knew nothing <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>federal</b> grand jury impaneled in Manhattan to probe the espionage and disloyalty charges stemming from Elizabeth Bentley's defection and other defectors from Soviet intelligence, so {{no one in the}} U.S. Government was aware that evidence against the Soviets was suddenly developing on two adjacent tracks.

2500|$|As a {{consequence}} of MacDougall's jamming, and ambiguity <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>federal</b> misdemeanor charge made against him under 47 U.S.C. § 301, the United States Congress passed the Electronic Communications Privacy Act of 1986 (18 U.S.C. [...] ) which made satellite hijacking a felony. The FCC subsequently implemented strict requirements that all radio and television transmitters must have an electronic name tag for tracking purposes. The Automatic Transmitter Identification System (ATIS) was developed {{in response to the}} Captain Midnight jamming incident. It allows satellite operators to quickly identify unauthorized uplink transmissions. In 2009, HBO and Elmer Musser were awarded a Technology & Engineering Emmy Award for ATIS. Although HBO has not been targeted since the channel's signal power was increased to {{make it more difficult for}} hijackers to intrude, there have been multiple instances of uplink video piracy across the United States. One such incident happened in November 1987, when WGN-TV in Chicago had its transmission briefly interrupted by a man in a Max Headroom mask, and that same evening, the signal of PBS affiliate WTTW was overridden for one-and-a-half minutes, where the same person mooned the viewing audience and had his buttocks struck with a fly swatter. The jamming did not appear to affect HBO's pricing policies in the long-term.|$|E
