5000|$|Ten Questions You Must <b>Ask</b> <b>Your</b> <b>Doctor</b> (with Ray Moynihan), Allen & Unwin, Sydney, 2008 ...|$|E
50|$|What {{happens after}} {{your child is}} {{diagnosed}} with CRMO/CNO?Find a doctor who has experience with patients with CRMO/CNO. CRMO/CNO in children is generally treated by a pediatric rheumatologist. <b>Ask</b> <b>your</b> <b>doctor</b> for a referral.|$|E
50|$|In waterbirthing, a woman {{remains in}} the water for delivery. The American Academy of Pediatrics has {{expressed}} concerns about delivering in water {{because of a lack}} of studies showing its safety and because of the rare but reported chance of complications. <b>Ask</b> <b>your</b> <b>doctor</b> or midwife if you want to know more about waterbirthing.|$|E
40|$|What are antibiotics? Antibiotics are {{medicines}} used {{to treat}} infections caused by bacteria. Antibiotics don’t work against infections caused by viruses, such as colds and flu. So there’s no point taking antibiotics to treat a cold or flu, and no point <b>asking</b> <b>your</b> <b>doctor</b> to prescribe them for a cold or flu. Taking antibiotics when you don’t need them, like for a cold or flu, is a waste. It can also mean that they won’t work when you really need them for a serious infection. This is called antibiotic resistance and it happens when bacteria are exposed to antibiotics and learn to resist them. Taking antibiotics {{when they are not}} needed also puts you at risk of side effects, like a rash, upset stomach or diarrhoea...|$|R
40|$|How {{would you}} respond to this request? Would you <b>ask</b> this of <b>your</b> <b>doctor?</b> How would you want {{him or her to}} respond? Our Novem-ber Evening Ethics engaged a diverse group in {{discussion}} about what the proper role is for a doctor in the doctor-patient relationship with regards to prayer and religious or spiritual is-sues. We prepared by reading Dr. Jerome Groopman’s “God at the Bedside” 1, where the dilemmas of setting boundaries on this relation-ship at different points pose various ethical ten-sions and often sharp contention in the medical world. To begin to grasp the complexity of the interre-lated concepts of prayer, spirituality, and relig...|$|R
5000|$|According to Mosby's, [...] "The {{abdominal}} exam {{is performed}} {{as part of}} the comprehensive physical examination or when a patient presents with signs of symptoms of an abdominal disease process." [...] In other words, <b>your</b> <b>doctor</b> will often perform an abdominal exam as part of a routine examination. However, <b>your</b> <b>doctor</b> might perform additional tests if <b>your</b> <b>doctor</b> feels that you might have an abdominal disease.|$|R
5000|$|Dahl {{later became}} an outspoken pro-vaccination advocate. [...] "Today {{a good and}} safe vaccine is {{available}} to every family and {{all you have to}} do is to <b>ask</b> <b>your</b> <b>doctor</b> to administer it", writes Dahl in 1988 in a pleading appeal to parents to vaccinate their children against measles. Actress Patricia Neal, Olivia's mother, interviewed in 1997 recounts the horribleness of a death of a child and says: [...] "Less than a week after coming down with the virus, she Olivia developed measles eoncephalitis, an inflammation of the brain". Olivia's sister, Lucy, interviewed in 2015 by CBS, states that her father did not understand why people choose not to vaccinate their children against measles, [...] "because he didn't have the choice". In Dahl's public letter he stated it is [...] "'almost a crime' for some parents not to immunize their children". [...] "I do agree with that", Lucy states; [...] "I think that it is a crime".|$|E
5000|$|Florbetaben PET imaging showed strong tracer {{accumulation}} in the anatomically matched {{brain regions}} confirmed to have β-amyloid plaques by postmortem histopathology, thus providing direct target validation for florbetaben. Evaluation of whole brain florbetaben PET images using the clinically applicable visual assessment method demonstrated that florbetaben provides good diagnostic efficacy in detecting/excluding cerebral neuritic β-amyloid plaques. Sensitivity and specificity {{of the whole}} brain assessment was 98 and 89%, respectively, against the histopathological standard of truth. Good agreement between blinded readers (kappa 0.90) was reported. Furthermore, high negative and positive predictive values were reported for florbetaben imaging to exclude or detect β-amyloid plaques (negative predictive value 96.0% and positive predictive value 93.9%, see [...] ). Intravenous injections of florbetaben are generally well tolerated in all subject groups. Analysis of 872 patients with 978 florbetaben administrations found no serious adverse reactions related to the tracer. All adverse reactions reported were mild to moderate in severity and temporary only. The most common reactions (incidence < 1%) were injection-site pain (3.9% of patients), injection-site erythema (1.7%) and injection-site irritation (1.2%). There was no overall difference in the tolerability of florbetaben between different age populations. Repeated annual florbetaben injections showed no differences in the tolerability profile. Risks and side effects are addressed in the patient information leaflet. You may also <b>ask</b> <b>your</b> <b>doctor</b> or pharmacist for further information.|$|E
5000|$|Generation Rescue {{issued a}} {{statement}} that the [...] "media circus" [...] following the revelation of Wakefield's fraud and manipulation of data was [...] "much ado about nothing", which led USA Today to report that McCarthy had [...] "taken a beating on Twitter". Mary Elizabeth Williams responded to Generation Rescue's statement:It's high time the woman who once said that [...] "I do believe sadly it's {{going to take some}} diseases coming back to realize that we need to change and develop vaccines that are safe" [...] took a step back and reconsidered the merits of that increasingly crackpot stance. And it's time she acknowledged that clinging to research that's been deemed patently fraudulent does not make one a [...] "mother warrior." [...] It makes her a menace.In January 2011, McCarthy defended Wakefield, saying that he had listened to parents, reported what they said, and recommended further investigation: Since when is repeating the words of parents and recommending further investigation a crime? As I've learned, the answer is whenever someone questions the safety of any vaccines. For some reason, parents aren't being told that this [...] "new" [...] information about Dr. Wakefield isn't a medical report, but merely the allegations of a single British journalist named Brian Deer.Having written three books on the subject after her son was diagnosed with the syndrome, [...] "by dint of sheer energy and celebrity, McCarthy became the nation's most prominent purveyor of anti-vaxxer ideology", and has reiterated that she is not against vaccines. In an earlier October 2013 interview for TV Guide, McCarthy is quoted as saying:It's been three years now since I've even talked about autism or vaccines — I was taken aback when people freaked out that I was going to come on The View and preach.... I will clarify my stance, which is still the same: That parents are in charge. Space it out, slow it down and do your homework. But I am not at all against vaccines.Jeffrey Kluger, senior writer at Time Magazine, has criticized McCarthy several times. In an open letter article referring to their past conflicts, he chided her and did not accept her denials:Jenny, as outbreaks of measles, mumps and whooping cough continue to appear in the U.S.—most the result of parents refusing to vaccinate their children because of the scare stories passed around by anti-vaxxers like you—it's just too late to play cute with the things you've said. You are either floridly, loudly, uninformedly antivaccine or you are the most grievously misunderstood celebrity of the modern era. Science almost always prefers the simple answer, because that's the one that's usually correct. Your quote trail is far too long—and you have been far too wrong—for the truth not to be obvious.One month later in May 2014, McCarthy published an opinion-editorial addressing her position on vaccines, which specifically mentions Kluger:I am not [...] "anti-vaccine." [...] This is not a change in my stance nor is it a new position that I have recently adopted. For years, I have repeatedly stated that I am, in fact, [...] "pro-vaccine" [...] and for years I have been wrongly branded as [...] "anti-vaccine." ... Blatantly inaccurate blog posts about my position have been accepted as truth by the public at large as well as media outlets (legitimate and otherwise), who have taken those false stories and repeatedly turned them into headlines.During a subsequent Daily Beast interview she stated:I am not anti-vaccine,... I'm in this gray zone of, I think everyone should be aware and educate yourself and ask questions. And if your kid is having a problem, <b>ask</b> <b>your</b> <b>doctor</b> for an alternative way of doing the shots.... The ironic thing is my position has always remained the same. People just never listened to it.In a 2015 Medscape article about celebrities who [...] "speak out about illness", Jeffrey A. Lieberman criticized McCarthy and her views on vaccines, thimerosal, and autism. He {{had this to say about}} her influence: [...] "She has no idea what she is talking about. What she said is misleading and harmful, and the measles outbreak is a clear indication of the response to the spread of such pseudoscientific myths." ...|$|E
40|$|Introduction-Why Nutrition Matters Nutrition is {{important}} for everyone to maintain good health. After a spinal cord injury, nutrition can be even more important to improve overall wellness, achieve and maintain a healthy weight and help regulate bowel and bladder function. Eating a well balanced diet can help prevent the long term complications associated with SCI such as weight gain, deconditioning and skin breakdown. A well-balanced diet can provide all of the nutrients that your body needs. Foods high in fiber, along with plenty of water, help regulate bowel function. However, if you eat more than you need, you can gain weight. The goal of a balanced diet is to consume adequate calories to maintain a healthy weight while getting all the nutrients that your body needs. If weight control is a problem, {{you can learn to}} decrease your calorie intake without giving up important nutrients, such as protein. There are several nutrition classes offered at Magee Rehabilitation Hospital to SCI inpatients and their caregivers that review general nutritional needs in SCI. In addition, a registered dietitian is available at Magee to discuss individual nutritional needs. As an inpatient, you can <b>ask</b> <b>your</b> nurse or <b>doctor</b> to see the dietitian.

40|$|Periorbital {{varicella}} gangrenosa necessitating orbital exenteration in {{a previously}} healthy adult We usually try to choose {{stories that are}} written for a general audience. Sometimes, however, a powerful story appears in a technical medical journal that we think almost all readers can appreciate. We believe that today’s story about an adult case of varicella infection is indeed powerful. For those who don’t have a medical dictionary handy, “orbital exenteration ” means complete removal {{of the contents of}} the eye socket. Most of us think of chickenpox, or varicella infection, as a childhood disease. It’s true that many more children than adults get chickenpox. However, a higher proportion of adults than children die from chickenpox or complications from the disease. The following medical case report tells us about one adult male, previously healthy, who apparently caught chickenpox from his infected children. He died after a year of suffering from pneumonia and severe group A Streptococcus infection that led to varicella gangrenosa, a form of necrotizing fasciitis.
