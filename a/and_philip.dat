5|$|Henry's {{relationship}} with his two surviving heirs was fraught, for, while the King had great affection for his youngest son John, he showed little warmth towards Richard and indeed seems to have borne him a grudge after their argument in 1184. The bickering and simmering tensions between Henry and Richard were cleverly exploited by the new French king, Philip Augustus. Philip had come to power in 1180 and he rapidly demonstrated {{that he could be}} an assertive, calculating and manipulative political leader. Initially Henry <b>and</b> <b>Philip</b> Augustus had enjoyed a good relationship. Despite attempts to divide the two, Henry <b>and</b> <b>Philip</b> Augustus agreed a joint alliance, even though this cost the French king the support of Flanders and Champagne. Philip Augustus regarded Geoffrey as a close friend, and would have welcomed him as a successor to Henry. With the death of Geoffrey, however, the relationship between Henry <b>and</b> <b>Philip</b> broke down.|$|E
