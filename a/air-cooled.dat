5|$|The F 3 {{appeared}} in 1939 {{and was the}} production version. The design was simplified {{over the course of}} the war to reduce costs and the use of strategic metals. Some vehicles produced by Tatra had its 12-cylinder, <b>air-cooled</b> Type 103 diesel engine fitted. Large spades were added at the rear of the chassis during the war to improve the vehicle's ability to recover tanks and other heavy vehicles.|$|E
5|$|The M21 Mortar Motor Carriage (MMC) was a {{self-propelled}} artillery mount on a half-track chassis {{used by the}} United States Army during World War II. It was equipped with an 81mm M1 mortar and an <b>air-cooled</b> M2 Browning machine gun. It was produced by the White Motor Company in 1944. Only 110 examples were produced.|$|E
5|$|The {{generators}} were {{manufactured by}} two joint ventures: {{one of them}} Alstom, ABB Group, Kvaerner, and the Chinese company Haerbin Motor; the other Voith, General Electric, Siemens (abbreviated as VGS), and the Chinese company Oriental Motor. The technology transfer agreement was signed together with the contract. Most of the generators are water-cooled. Some newer ones are <b>air-cooled,</b> which are simpler in design and manufacture and are easier to maintain.|$|E
5|$|These {{guns were}} <b>air-cooled</b> {{and used a}} gas {{blowback}} recoil system. Unlike other automatic guns employed during World War II {{the barrel of the}} 20mm Oerlikon gun did not recoil, the breechblock never locked against the breech and actually moved forward when the gun fired. This weapon lacked a counter-recoil brake, as the force of the counter-recoil was checked by the explosion of the next round of ammunition.|$|E
5|$|Titan's {{components}} are <b>air-cooled</b> by heat sinks, {{but the air}} is chilled before being pumped through the cabinets. Fan noise is so loud that hearing protection is required for people spending more than 15 minutes in the machine room. The system has a cooling capacity of 23.2 MW (6600 tons) and works by chilling water to 5.5 °C (42 °F), which in turn cools recirculated air.|$|E
5|$|Although an <b>air-cooled</b> {{design was}} chosen for the reactor at Oak Ridge to {{facilitate}} rapid construction, it was recognized {{that this would be}} impractical for the much larger production reactors. Initial designs by the Metallurgical Laboratory and DuPont used helium for cooling, before they determined that a water-cooled reactor would be simpler, cheaper and quicker to build. The design did not become available until 4 October 1943; in the meantime, Matthias concentrated on improving the Hanford Site by erecting accommodations, improving the roads, building a railway switch line, and upgrading the electricity, water and telephone lines.|$|E
5|$|The M15 was {{equipped}} with the M42 armored weapon mount, with two water-cooled coaxial M2 Browning machine guns above a 37mm gun. A total of 680 M15s were produced in 1943 by White and Autocar before the considerable stress this mount placed on the M3 chassis, which resulted in its replacement with the M54 mount. The new mount reversed weapon placement, used simpler and lighter <b>air-cooled</b> M2 Brownings, and added a M6 sighting system.|$|E
5|$|The M249 is gas {{operated}} and <b>air-cooled.</b> It has a quick-change barrel, allowing the gunner to rapidly replace an overheated or jammed barrel. A folding bipod is attached {{near the front}} of the gun, though an M192 LGM tripod is available. It can be fed from both linked ammunition and STANAG magazines, like those used in the M16 and M4. This allows the SAW gunner to use a rifleman's magazines as an emergency source of ammunition in the event that he runs out of linked rounds.|$|E
5|$|The {{most common}} {{electrode}} holder is a semiautomatic <b>air-cooled</b> holder. Compressed air circulates {{through it to}} maintain moderate temperatures. It is used with lower current levels for welding lap or butt joints. The second {{most common type of}} electrode holder is semiautomatic water-cooled, where {{the only difference is that}} water takes the place of air. It uses higher current levels for welding T or corner joints. The third typical holder type is a water cooled automatic electrode holder—which is typically used with automated equipment.|$|E
5|$|These {{guns are}} <b>air-cooled</b> {{and use a}} gas blow-back recoil system. Unlike other {{automatic}} guns employed during World War II, {{the barrel of the}} 20mm Oerlikon gun does not recoil; the breechblock is never locked against the breech and is actually moving forward when the gun fires. This weapon lacks a counter-recoil brake, as the force of the counter-recoil is checked by recoil from the firing of the next round of ammunition.|$|E
5|$|When Britain began {{planning}} to build nuclear reactors to produce plutonium for weapons in 1946, {{it was decided}} to build a pair of <b>air-cooled</b> graphite reactors similar to the X-10 Graphite Reactor at Windscale. Natural uranium was used as enriched was not available, and similarly graphite was chosen as a neutron moderator because beryllia was toxic and hard to manufacture, while heavy water was unavailable. Use of water as a coolant was considered, but there were concerns {{about the possibility of a}} catastrophic nuclear meltdown in the densely populated British Isles if the cooling system failed. Helium was again the preferred choice as a coolant gas, but the main source of it was the United States, and under the 1946 McMahon Act, the United States would not supply it for nuclear weapons production, so, in the end, air cooling was chosen. Construction began in September 1947, and the two reactors became operational in October 1950 and June 1951. Both were decommissioned after the disastrous Windscale fire in October 1957. They would be the last major <b>air-cooled</b> plutonium-producing reactors; the UK's follow-on Magnox and AGR designs used carbon dioxide instead.|$|E
5|$|When the <b>air-cooled</b> X-10 Graphite Reactor at Oak Ridge went {{critical}} on 4 November 1943, Fermi {{was on hand}} just in {{case something}} went wrong. The technicians woke him early {{so that he could}} see it happen. Getting X-10 operational was another milestone in the plutonium project. It provided data on reactor design, training for DuPont staff in reactor operation, and produced the first small quantities of reactor-bred plutonium. Fermi became an American citizen in July 1944, the earliest date the law allowed.|$|E
5|$|The I-6 had an oval-section {{semi-monocoque}} fuselage {{covered with}} 'shpon', molded birch plywood, {{with a small}} headrest faired into the fuselage, although the engine was enclosed in a metal cowling that left the cylinder heads exposed for better cooling. The two-spar wings were covered in plywood and fabric and had a Clark Y profile. Internal bracing wires were fitted to reinforce the wings. The control surfaces were framed in duralumin, but covered in fabric. The duralumin N-type struts that separated the wings, and attached the upper wing to the fuselage, had a teardrop profile. They were reinforced with steel bracing wires. The conventional undercarriage was fixed with rubber shock absorbers. The wooden propeller was given a spinner. The lighter weight of the <b>air-cooled</b> Jupiter engine, which required neither a heavy radiator nor coolant, meant that the I-6 had an empty weight only 62% of that of the I-3.|$|E
5|$|Coandă {{described}} a different, more sturdy {{system for the}} attachment of the wings, which also enabled changes in the angle of attack and the centre of gravity. He aimed to obtain more power from the propulsion system, and design drawings show the arrangement of two <b>air-cooled</b> rotary engines {{on the sides of}} the fuselage. The placement of the engines indicates that Coandă did not intend to inject fuel into the jet stream and ignite it as the cooling of the engines would have been compromised. The patent was annotated with an additional claim on 19 July 1911 which brought significant changes including the addition of retractable landing gear with dampers inside aerodynamic fairings with skids, removal of the horizontal stabiliser, a supporting surface was provided for each engine and their accessories were covered to improve aerodynamics. Though Coandă continued to study rotary propulsion mechanisms, Antoniu believes that Coandă never implemented a practical solution because of the lack of funds.|$|E
5|$|Development of the I-6 (Istrebitel—fighter) {{began in}} September 1928 with a {{deadline}} for delivery for the first prototype of 1 August 1929 after the first prototypes of the Polikarpov I-3 were completed. Although the new fighter shared many {{of the characteristics of}} the earlier design, including the staggered sesquiplane, single-bay, layout of the wings, it was a new design which used a nine-cylinder, single-row, <b>air-cooled</b> Bristol Jupiter radial engine rather the water-cooled inline engine of its predecessor. It was designed by the OSS (—Landplane Department), later redesignated as OPO-1 (—Experimental Department) of Aviatrest ("Aviation Trust") under the supervision of Nikolai Polikarpov, head designer of the department. It was originally intended to be compared to the I-3, but this was changed to an evaluation of construction methods with the wooden construction I-6 compared to the mixed construction Polikarpov I-5. Both aircraft used the Jupiter VI engine for which a license had recently been negotiated.|$|E
5|$|Fermi's Chicago Pile-1 reactor, {{constructed}} {{under the}} west viewing stands {{of the original}} Stagg Field at the University of Chicago, went critical on December 2, 1942. This graphite-moderated reactor only generated up to 200 W, but it demonstrated that k was higher than anticipated. This not only removed most of the objections to <b>air-cooled</b> and water-cooled reactor designs, it greatly simplified {{other aspects of the}} design. Wigner's team submitted blueprints of a water-cooled reactor to DuPont in January 1943. By this time, the concerns of DuPont's engineers about the corrosiveness of water had been overcome by the mounting difficulties of using helium, and all work on helium was terminated in February. At the same time, air cooling was chosen for the reactor at the pilot plant. Since it would be of a quite different design from the production reactors, the X-10 Graphite Reactor lost its value as a prototype, but its value as a working pilot facility remained, providing plutonium needed for research. It was hoped that problems would be found in time to deal with them in the production plants. The semiworks would also be used for training, and for developing procedures.|$|E
5|$|The {{chemistry}} of plutonium {{was found to}} resemble uranium {{after a few months}} of initial study. Early research was continued at the secret Metallurgical Laboratory of the University of Chicago. On August 20, 1942, a trace quantity of this element was isolated and measured for the first time. About 50micrograms of plutonium-239 combined with uranium and fission products was produced and only about 1microgram was isolated. This procedure enabled chemists to determine the new element's atomic weight. On December 2, 1942, on a racket court under the west grandstand at the University of Chicago's Stagg Field, researchers headed by Enrico Fermi achieved the first self-sustaining chain reaction in a graphite and uranium pile known as CP-1. Using theoretical information garnered from the operation of CP-1, DuPont constructed an <b>air-cooled</b> experimental production reactor, known as X-10, and a pilot chemical separation facility at Oak Ridge. The separation facility, using methods developed by Glenn T. Seaborg and a team of researchers at the Met Lab, removed plutonium from uranium irradiated in the X-10 reactor. Information from CP-1 was also useful to Met Lab scientists designing the water-cooled plutonium production reactors for Hanford. Construction at the site began in mid-1943.|$|E
25|$|By 1918 the {{potential}} advantages of <b>air-cooled</b> radials over the water-cooled inline engine and <b>air-cooled</b> rotary engine that had powered World War I aircraft were appreciated but were unrealized. British designers had produced the ABC Dragonfly radial in 1917, but {{were unable to}} resolve the cooling problems, {{and it was not}} until the 1920s that Bristol and Armstrong Siddeley produced reliable <b>air-cooled</b> radials such as the Bristol Jupiter and the Armstrong Siddeley Jaguar.|$|E
