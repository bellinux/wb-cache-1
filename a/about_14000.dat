He took the ports of La Hogue and Barfleur with {{overwhelming}} force and continued inland towards Caen, taking towns along the way. The French mounted a defence at Caen, but were ultimately defeated.

5|$|By {{the evening}} of March 25, the North Vietnamese had secured all major points {{surrounding}} Huế, and South Vietnamese units that failed to escape were completely surrounded. Consequently, the North Vietnamese claimed to have captured large numbers of South Vietnamese prisoners and military hardware.

5|$|Desaix’s arrival around 5:30 pm stabilised the French {{position}} as the 9th Light Infantry Regiment delayed the Austrian advance down the main road {{and the rest of}} the army re-formed north of Cascina Grossa. As the pursuing Austrian troops arrived, a mix of musketry and artillery fire concealed the surprise attack of Général de Brigade (GdB) François Étienne de Kellermann’s cavalry, which threw the Austrian pursuit into disordered flight back into Alessandria, with <b>about</b> <b>14,000</b> killed, wounded, or captured. The French casualties were considerably fewer, but included Desaix. The whole French line chased after the Austrians to seal une victoire politique (a political victory) that secured Bonaparte’s grip on power after the coup. It would be followed by a propaganda campaign, which sought to rewrite the story of the battle three times during Napoleon’s rule.|$|E
5|$|In early 1957, Tubb persuaded Hamilton {{to switch}} the {{magazine}} from pocket-book to digest size format, {{in the hope}} that this would improve the magazine's visibility on bookstalls. The circulation did indeed rise, to <b>about</b> <b>14,000</b> copies per month—a surprisingly low figure given Landsborough's assertion that Authentic had been selling 30,000 copies in the early days. However, later that year, Hamilton made the decision to invest a substantial sum in the UK paperback rights of an American best-seller: it is not known for certain which book this was, but it is thought to have been Evan Hunter's The Blackboard Jungle. Hamilton could no longer afford to have cash tied up in Authentic, and in the summer of 1957 Tubb was given two months to close down the magazine, printing stories that had already been paid for. The last issue was dated October 1957.|$|E

5|$|Fort George Island {{is located}} in Duval County, several miles {{northeast}} of downtown Jacksonville. It is a marsh island {{at the mouth of}} the St. Johns River, surrounded by tidal estuaries, Little Talbot Island, and the Nassau River. The north Atlantic coast of Florida had been inhabited for approximately 12,000 years when Spanish explorer Juan Ponce de León landed near Cape Canaveral in 1513. The Spanish met the Saturiwa, a Timucua tribe, who were the largest group of indigenous people in the region, numbering <b>about</b> <b>14,000.</b> Bands of Timucua extended into central Florida and south Georgia. An estimated 35 chiefdoms existed in the territory, and their societies were complex with large villages sustained by fishing, hunting, and agriculture, but they frequently warred with each other and unrelated groups of Native Americans. The Spanish concentrated their efforts of exploration and settlement on the Gulf Coast of Florida. By 1562, Jean Ribault led French explorers to the mouth of the St. Johns River where they built a garrison in 1564, calling it Fort Caroline. Within 200 years the population of the indigenous people of Florida was decimated by disease and constant fighting. They left behind evidence of their existence in massive middens or shell mounds filled with discarded food byproducts. On Fort George Island, the shells were primarily oysters.|$|E

50|$|Many of {{the ancient}} peoples of the American continents built semi-permanent houses of poles and brush {{plastered}} with mud over a shallow pit in the earth. As these pithouses were {{very similar to those}} first built in northeastern Europe 25,000 years ago, pithouse technology may have been carried to the Americas by early nomadic settlers, traveling first through Siberia, and then across the ice bridge between Asia and North America <b>about</b> 12,000 to <b>14,000</b> years ago.|$|R
5000|$|<b>About</b> 12,000 to <b>14,000</b> years ago, Mount Hope {{was covered}} with ice one to two miles thick.

When the miles-high ice sheets finally melted, these river beds were left as ridges created from all the rock and rubble that had been deposited by the flowing river. In geological terms, these ridges are called eskers. One such esker snakes its way through much of Mount Hope Cemetery.|$|R

50|$|From the 15th century, the {{important}} Lange Hessen and Cologne-Leipzig trade roads made of Kirchhain a road hub and thereby spurred on the town's further economic development. Its good traffic connections, however, led to Kirchhain's being occupied {{a few times}} during the Thirty Years' War, becoming for a time the headquarters of various armies, and thereby having to suffer as troops were billeted in the town. In 1636, <b>about</b> 12,000 to <b>14,000</b> soldiers were being housed {{in and around the}} town. For the 1,000 or so townsfolk at that time, this was a tremendous burden.|$|R

50|$|The Mexican cottontail {{is found}} only in Mexico where its range extends {{from the state of}} Sinaloa to the states of Oaxaca and Veracruz, {{including}} the mountainous regions of the Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt.

In central Mexico it is quite common in pine and pine/oak forests with a ground cover of tussocky grasses such as Agrostis, Festuca and Muhlenbergia. Predators of the Mexican cottontail include red foxes, coyotes, the long-tailed weasel, feral dogs, the great horned owl, and the red-tailed hawk.|$|R

50|$|Many of {{the rock}} bluffs lining the {{interior}} of the preserve are composed of sandstones, limestones, and dolostones. The rock was produced over time from chemical and physical processes acting on the bed of ancient marine seaways that once covered vast portions of North America between 66 and 550 million years ago. The shoreline of the ancient seaways migrated back and forth from roughly Oklahoma to Illinois, and the river delta systems deposited clay, mud, peat, and channel sands across the area. Over time, these deposits were compacted and cemented into the familiar rock formations observed today. Significant erosion of glacial deposits by the Des Moines River and associated tributaries has helped to expose these deposits over time after the retreat of the Wisconsin Glaciation <b>about</b> 12,000 to <b>14,000</b> years before present. Two man-made rock shelters found within the preserve provided evidence to suggest that Woodland Indians or Archaic Indians inhabited the area as early as 2,800 years before present.|$|R
5000|$|As Carol {{moved through}} eastern Canada, it dropped light to {{moderate}} rainfall along its path, peaking at 4.33 inches (110 mm) in the Côte-Nord region of eastern Quebec, {{along the northern}} coast of the Gulf of St. Lawrence. Strong winds affected much of the region, primarily Nova Scotia, including an 80 mph (129 km/h) gust in Halifax. Across the province, the combination of winds and rain downed the equivalent of <b>about</b> 500,000 ft3 (<b>14,000</b> m3) of trees, most of which in areas where some trees were already cut. The winds blew trees onto power lines, leaving widespread areas without telephone, telegraph, or power. In Annapolis Valley, strong winds heavily damaged the apple and grain crop, with farms experiencing losses up to 50%. Losses from the apple crop was estimated around $1 million (1950 CAD, $ [...] USD). Strong winds left some property damage, including broken windows {{and at least one}} instance of a blown-off roof. Across the province, Carol left several people injured.|$|R
5000|$|From {{the west}} coast of the Atlantic, the Acadians were {{suffering}} once again the consequences of the Deportation, launched by the British in 1755: numerous families separated, all dispossessed of their lands and goods, and <b>about</b> 10,000 of <b>14,000</b> Acadians emigrated principally from the British Colonies on the Atlantic coast, from Massachusetts to Georgia. After the end of hostilities, in 1762, the Acadians always showed in New Scotland their tendency to adjust to their circumstances: [...] "The remains of our disintegrated society ... submits to a regime taken so they can be transformed into useful members of society"(3), he said. By cirtue of this very principle that, progressively, the ?deportees were allowed to find a new home in their old Acadia. Those who escaped the Deportation alive, those who broke out of their prisons and those who dreamed of returning to their motherland, all these people were born again and abjured the enticements of ?establishing themselves for good or ill on land less fertile than the maritime states.|$|R
