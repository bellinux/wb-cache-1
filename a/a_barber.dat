5|$|Merrick was now {{homeless}} on {{the streets}} of Leicester.

Merrick continued to hawk around Leicester {{for the next two years}} but his efforts to earn a living met with little more success than before. Eventually, his disfigurement drew such negative attention from members of the public that the Commissioners for Hackney Carriages withdrew his licence when it came up for renewal. With young children to provide for, Charles could no longer afford to support his nephew. In late December 1879, now 17 years old, Merrick entered the Leicester Union Workhouse.|$|E
