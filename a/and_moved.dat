5|$|A {{dispute over}} the {{composition}} of a Surrey side chosen to play a high-profile game in 1909, after several professional players were omitted for disciplinary reasons, led to an increasingly bitter argument between Crawford and the Surrey authorities. Crawford was told he had no future with the club, <b>and</b> <b>moved</b> to Australia. There, {{he worked as a}} teacher and continued his cricket career with South Australia. This arrangement had a controversial end, when he clashed with the South Australian Cricket Association over money <b>and</b> <b>moved</b> to New Zealand to play for Otago.|$|E

5|$|After graduating, Synge {{decided that}} he wanted to be a {{professional}} musician and went to Germany to study music. He stayed in Coblenz during 1893 <b>and</b> <b>moved</b> to Würzburg in January 1894. Partly because he was shy about performing in public, and partly because of doubt about his ability, he decided to abandon music and pursue his literary interests. He returned to Ireland in June 1894, <b>and</b> <b>moved</b> to Paris in January 1895 to study literature and languages at the Sorbonne.|$|E

5|$|Chris Hadfield, a Canadian Space Agency {{astronaut}} and STS-74 mission specialist, {{used the}} shuttle's robot arm to hoist the docking module {{out of the}} aft portion of the payload bay, rotated it to a vertical position, <b>and</b> <b>moved</b> it to within five inches of the Orbiter Docking System. At that point, the shuttle fired its downward steering jets <b>and</b> <b>moved</b> the shuttle toward the docking module.

Komen intensified into a 75km/h (45mph) cyclonic storm <b>and</b> <b>moved</b> ashore southeastern Bangladesh on July30.

30|$|According to the {{confusion}} matrix shown in Fig.  8, {{we can see that}} Grasp <b>and</b> <b>Move</b> are more easily to be confused, which are consistent with our observations. Actually some Grasp <b>and</b> <b>Move</b> instances are even difficult to differentiate for people. Grasp <b>and</b> <b>Move</b> do have similar feature vector, but the spatial–temporal characteristic is slightly different. Unfortunately, the spatial–temporal characteristics are difficult to be reflected from the pixel-wise. The experimental result on motion recognition demonstrates the robustness of the proposed method.|$|R
