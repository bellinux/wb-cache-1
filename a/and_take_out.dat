5|$|In early 2006 {{a project}} office was {{established}} within the Defence Materiel Organisation (DMO) {{to evaluate the}} options for acquiring heavy lift aircraft. The office considered the Boeing C-17 Globemaster III, which was in service with the USAF at the time, {{as well as the}} Airbus A400M Atlas, which was yet to make its first flight. Boeing aggressively marketed the C-17 to the Australian Government during this period. Though unstated, commonality with the USAF and the United Kingdom's RAF was also considered advantageous. In March 2006, Minister for Defence Brendan Nelson announced that the government had decided to purchase three C-17s <b>and</b> <b>take</b> <b>out</b> an option for a fourth. Nelson also announced that the C-17s would be operated by No. 36 Squadron RAAF, which was to transfer its C-130H Hercules to No. 37 Squadron and relocate from RAAF Base Richmond in New South Wales to RAAF Base Amberley in Queensland. Amberley was selected over Richmond as the base for the Globemasters as its runways and engineering facilities were better able to support large aircraft.|$|E
5|$|The {{plan was}} for four troops (A, B, C and F), {{headquarters}} and attached specialists, {{to be divided}} into two groups. Group one under the command of Major Mills-Roberts would land at Orange One and consisted of C Troop, a section from ATroop, the mortar detachment and some of the specialists. They would scale the cliffs and form a fire base in the woods in front of the battery to support the assault. Group two commanded by Lieutenant Colonel Lovat would land at Orange Two <b>and</b> <b>take</b> <b>out</b> the beach defences. B and F Troops would then advance move along the river and assault the battery from the rear. The rest of ATroop would be the reserve, positioned between the two beaches. After the attack Group two would withdraw through Group one and be picked up by the waiting LCAs on Orange One beach.|$|E

25|$|On 22 August 2013, McCourt {{signed for}} Championship club Barnsley, managed by his former Rochdale {{teammate}} David Flitcroft, on a one-year deal. He made his debut on 21 September 2013 {{at home to}} Watford. He played in 23 league games for the club, scoring twice, before being released {{at the end of}} the season. One goal, which opened the scoring in Barnsley's 3–2 victory over Middlesbrough, saw McCourt guide the ball into the box <b>and</b> <b>take</b> <b>out</b> six opposition players, before finishing past the goalkeeper from the six-yard line. The goal was shortlisted for the Football League Goal of the Year award, though lost to Franck Moussa's chip for Coventry City against Leyton Orient.|$|E
25|$|Prisoners {{developed}} {{hand signals}} to communicate {{things they did}} not want the guards or other prisoners to hear. When a prisoner wanted to pass a note down to a girlfriend, he would attach a little bundle {{to the end of a}} long rope woven from mattress fibers and throw the bundle down into the street. The girlfriend down below would run to catch the bundle <b>and</b> <b>take</b> <b>out</b> the note. This would also give her an opportunity to stuff a note, cigarettes, drugs, a photograph of their child, a weapon, into the bundle, which the inmate could then hoist back up through the hole in the wall, before the guards came running to intercept the line. They called these rope and bundle setups palomas ("pigeons") and apparently, at any given time, seven or eight palomas could be flying down into the street, or back up to the prison, attached to their makeshift ropes.|$|E

500|$|Famed for its {{dramatic}} rapids and canyons, the Colorado {{is one of}} {{the most}} desirable whitewater rivers in the United States, and its Grand Canyon section – run by more than 22,000 people annually – has been called the [...] "granddaddy of rafting trips". Grand Canyon trips typically begin at Lee's Ferry <b>and</b> <b>take</b> <b>out</b> at Diamond Creek or Lake Mead; they range from one to eighteen days for commercial trips and from two to twenty-five days for private trips. Private (noncommercial) trips are extremely difficult to arrange because the National Park Service limits river traffic for environmental purposes; people who desire such a trip often have to wait more than 10 years for the opportunity.|$|E
500|$|A day later, {{producer}} David Kahne stated on {{the same}} site that the leaked listing was bogus. In an interview with Billboard magazine in May 2007, McCartney said that the album's material was [...] "in some ways a little bit retrospective. Some of them are of now, some of them hark back to the past, {{but all of them}} are songs I'm very proud of." [...] McCartney played mandolin on the song [...] "Dance Tonight". He comments that [...] "In searching the instrument to try and find chords, which I did with the guitar when I was 14, probably, that freshness was brought back." [...] "Ever Present Past", which McCartney called [...] "personal", originally started out as a song called [...] "Perfect Lover". [...] "Ever Present Past" [...] also includes references to the Beatles. In June 2007, McCartney revealed that [...] "See Your Sunshine" [...] "is pretty much an out-and-out love song for Heather. A lot of the album was done before, during and after our separation. I didn't go back <b>and</b> <b>take</b> <b>out</b> any songs to do with her." [...] "You Tell Me" [...] is about McCartney's memories of his previous wife, Linda.|$|E
500|$|The {{battle was}} {{undoubtedly}} {{a victory for}} the British; four French ships of the line, a fourth-rate and a frigate were destroyed and much of the remainder of the Brest fleet badly damaged and requiring extensive repairs; Océan and Foudroyant were in a particularly poor state. French casualties in the engagement are not known with certainty, but are estimated at 150–200, while British losses were only 13 killed and 30 wounded. Allemand later wrote that most significant damage resulting from the battle was to the morale of the French fleet; he wrote that [...] "the greater part are disheartened; every day I hear them lamenting their situation, and speaking in praise of their enemy." [...] another French commentator told a British officer that the French sailors [...] "had now no security from the English in their harbours, and they expected we should next go into Brest <b>and</b> <b>take</b> <b>out</b> their fleet". [...] No British ships suffered more than minor damage in the two weeks of combat, and the fleet could return to its blockade with the knowledge that the Brest fleet was neutralised {{for some time to come}} and confined to Rochefort, although a powerful squadron was still under construction at Rochefort, where the defences had been swiftly repaired. This was the last time during the Napoleonic Wars that a significant French fleet was able to put to sea from the Atlantic ports; historian Richard Woodman describes it as the [...] "biggest scare from a break-out French fleet in the post-Trafalgar period." [...] Without naval support, the French colonies in the Caribbean were isolated, blockaded, invaded and captured shortly afterwards.|$|E

2500|$|The limited {{financial}} resources of children were tapped through campaigns in schools. The initial minimum Austrian bond denomination of 100 kronen still exceeded {{the means of}} most children, so the third bond issue, in 1915, introduced a scheme whereby children could donate a small amount <b>and</b> <b>take</b> <b>out</b> a bank loan to cover {{the rest of the}} 100 kronen. The initiative was immensely successful, eliciting funds and encouraging loyalty to the state and its future among Austro-Hungarian youth. Over [...] kronen was collected in the first three [...] "child bond" [...] issues.|$|E
2500|$|Heim {{reportedly}} removed organs {{from living}} prisoners without anesthesia, killing hundreds. A prisoner {{by the name}} of Karl Lotter also worked in the Mauthausen hospital at the time Aribert Heim was there. Lotter testified that in 1941, he witnessed Aribert Heim butcher a prisoner who came to him with an inflamed foot. Lotter provided more gruesome details about how Aribert butchered the 18-year-old prisoner. Lotter stated that Aribert gave the prisoner anesthetic and then proceeded to cut him open, castrate him, <b>and</b> <b>take</b> <b>out</b> one of his kidneys. The prisoner died, and his head was cut off, boiled and stripped of its flesh.|$|E
2500|$|Said {{football}} statistics site Football Outsiders of Testaverde's unlikely 1996 season, [...] "The {{real reason}} the Ravens ranked first in rushing [...] was, {{believe it or}} not, Vinny Testaverde, who {{was out of his}} gourd as a scrambler that season. Ignore the official stats <b>and</b> <b>take</b> <b>out</b> the kneels, and Testaverde had 197 yards on just 23 carries, 8.6 yards per carry. He scrambled seven times on third down with 5-10 yards to go and converted six of those. He scrambled six times on a 1st-and-10 and gained a new first down five times. Testaverde had not rushed for 100 yards since 1992." ...|$|E

Emma shows Zelena the Apprentice's wand, as Zelena {{was the only person}} to wield it and lived, then offers Zelena freedom and protection in exchange for her assistance, but Zelena tells Emma that she is a bad influence as her darkness is already causing Henry to resent her, and a broken heart can't be forgiven.

2500|$|The {{counterfeiting}} montage looks authentic because Friedkin consulted actual counterfeiters who {{had done}} time. The [...] "consultant" [...] actually did the scenes that do not show actor Willem Dafoe on camera to give this sequence more authenticity even though the actor learned how to print money. Over one million dollars of counterfeit money was produced but with three deliberate errors {{so that it could}} not be used outside the film. The filmmakers burned most of the fake money but some leaked out, was used, and linked back to the production. The son of one of the crew members tried to use some of the prop money to buy candy at a local store and was caught. Three FBI agents from Washington, D.C. interviewed 12-15 crew members including Friedkin who screened the workprint for them. He offered to show the film to the Secretary of the Treasury <b>and</b> <b>take</b> <b>out</b> anything that was a danger to national security. That was the last he heard from the government.|$|E
2500|$|On 26 March 2013, {{near the}} Syrian town of al-Qusayr, rebel {{commander}} Khaled al Hamad, who commanded the Al Farooq al-Mustakilla Brigade {{and is also}} known by his nom de guerre Abu Sakkar, ate the heart and liver of a dead soldier and said [...] "I swear to God, you soldiers of Bashar, you dogs, we will eat from your hearts and livers! O heroes of Bab Amr, you slaughter the Alawites <b>and</b> <b>take</b> <b>out</b> their hearts to eat them!" [...] in an apparent attempt to increase sectarianism. Video of the event emerged two months later and resulted in considerable outrage, especially from Human Rights Watch which classified the incident as a war crime. According to the BBC, {{it was one of}} the most gruesome videos to emerge from the conflict to-date. On 29 March, rebels captured the town of Da'el after fierce fighting. The town is located in Daraa Governorate, along the highway connecting Damascus to Jordan. On 3 April, rebels captured a military base near the city of Daraa.|$|E
