5|$|Juan José Castelli was {{the main}} speaker for the revolutionaries.

5000|$|Most {{available}} data {{points to a}} composition date in the North Song dynasty (960-1127). Bibliographies from the Tang and Song dynasties contain references to seven other works attributed to Li Jing, but no reference to Questions <b>and</b> <b>Replies.</b> A major work (the [...] "Dong Tian") completed in the eighth century AD quotes Li Jing extensively, but never once mentions [...] "Questions and Replies". Because {{of the lack of}} earlier reference to Questions <b>and</b> <b>Replies,</b> <b>and</b> because of references from some Northern Songs scholars claiming to have seen drafts of Questions <b>and</b> <b>Replies</b> by a contemporary military scholar named [...] "Yuan Yi", many scholars believed that Questions <b>and</b> <b>Replies</b> was forged by Yuan Yi in the early Song dynasty. If Questions <b>and</b> <b>Replies</b> was created by Yuan Yi, it is not clear if the military theories found in Questions <b>and</b> <b>Replies</b> are actually the opinions of Li Jing, taken from other sources and compiled by Yuan Yi to form the present text, or if they are Yuan Yi's original thoughts, using the veneer of Li Jing's speech in order to promote the acceptance of his theories.|$|R
5|$|Even {{though as}} many as {{fourteen}} claimants put forward their claims to the title, the real contest was between John Balliol and Robert de Brus. The Scottish magnates made a request to Edward to conduct the proceedings and administer the outcome, but not to arbitrate in the dispute. The actual decision would be made by 104 auditors - 40 appointed by Balliol, 40 by Bruce and the remaining 24 selected by Edward I from {{senior members of the}} Scottish political community. At Birgham, with the prospect of a personal union between the two realms, the question of suzerainty had not been of great importance to Edward. Now he insisted that, if he were to settle the contest, he had to be fully recognised as Scotland's feudal overlord. The Scots were reluctant to make such a concession, <b>and</b> <b>replied</b> that since the country had no king, no one had the authority to make this decision. This problem was circumvented when the competitors agreed that the realm would be handed over to Edward until a rightful heir had been found. After a lengthy hearing, a decision was made in favour of John Balliol on 17November 1292.|$|E
5|$|In July 1892, Curtis sent a {{photograph}} of the Lotto painting to Leech, who consulted with Barber <b>and</b> <b>replied</b> that the engraver could not work from a painting in which the subject faces forward. So that Barber could depict Columbus in profile, Curtis arranged for a little-known Washington, D.C. sculptor, Ulric Stonewall Jackson Dunbar, to create a bust based on the painting at the Company's expense; when complete it was forwarded to Barber in Philadelphia. Barber prepared sketches based on the bust on August 15, and presented them to Acting Mint Director Robert E. Preston (Leech was on vacation), who forwarded them to fair authorities in Chicago. Ellsworth showed them to artists working on the exposition, and to the press. The artistic reaction was negative, and the newspapers suggested that the sketches resembled more a long-haired professor than the celebrated mariner. This controversy, coupled with his anger from public debate over whether the painting actually was of Columbus, caused Ellsworth to refuse permission for his painting to be used.|$|E
5|$|The MCC {{match was}} {{followed}} by a draw against Lancashire at Old Trafford; {{this was the first time}} the tourists had failed to win since arriving in England. Barnes made 31 in both innings after the first day was washed out; the match ended in a draw. Barnes was rested in the subsequent match against Nottinghamshire, which saw a second consecutive draw. He returned for the next game against Hampshire, as Australia had another scare. On a drying pitch, the hosts dismissed Australia for 117 in reply to 195; this was the first time the tourists had conceded a first innings lead on the tour. Barnes made 20. Hampshire fell for 103 in their second innings to leave Australia a target of 182, which was reached to seal an eight-wicket win, despite Barnes falling for a duck. The final match before the First Test was against Sussex and Barnes was rested as Australia dismissed the hosts for 86 <b>and</b> <b>replied</b> with 5/549 declared before completing another innings victory.|$|E
40|$|Scalable {{reliable}} multicast (SRM) is {{a framework}} for reliable multicast delivery. In order to maximize the collaboration among the group members in error recovery, both retransmission requests <b>and</b> <b>replies</b> are multicast to the entire group. While SRM effectively uses random timers to suppress duplicate requests <b>and</b> <b>replies,</b> the global nature of the request <b>and</b> <b>replies</b> means that every packet loss results {{in at least one}} request <b>and</b> <b>reply</b> message sent to the entire group. To further improve the scalability of SRM, one must localize the scope of error recovery traffic. In this paper, we present two approaches to local recovery: hop-based scope control and use of local recovery groups. The first approach uses hop count to limit the distribution of requests <b>and</b> <b>replies</b> whereas the second approach confines error recovery traffic using separately addressed local recovery groups. The local recovery groups and hop count settings are automatically created and dynamically adjusted based on observed loss patterns. We use simulation experiments to examine the performance of both approaches...|$|R

The proposal was rejected by the Aldermen, and its rejection led to a renewal of the old quarrel between them and the commons, and to fresh manifestations of public sympathy with Lucas.|$|E
25|$|In the 1950–51 season Bristol Rovers {{reached the}} quarter-finals of the FA Cup {{for the first}} time. The quarter-final was against Newcastle United at St James' Park and was a 0–0 draw.

The song was sung at the Rovers fans by supporters of Plymouth Argyle before a match at Eastville, because a version of {{it was in the}} charts at the time, and again to taunt the Rovers fans after Argyle had taken the lead.

25|$|On 11 May, Rupprecht {{was ordered}} by Falkenhayn not to retire under any circumstances, with the {{discretion}} {{to achieve this}} by attack or defence <b>and</b> <b>replied</b> that a counter-attack was not feasible. Next day, two regiments of the 117th Division were added to I Bavarian Reserve Corps to protect Neuville and reinforcements arriving to re-establish the OHL reserve behind the 6th Army were taken over; part of the 15th Division was sent to Douai as a new OHL reserve and Falkenhayn suggested that a special headquarters be set up to co-ordinate counter-attacks. On 13 June, Rupprecht repeated his orders to XIV Corps to hold Carency and Haenisch sent pioneers to dig a reserve trench behind the left flank of the 28th Division. French pressure on the Lorette Spur had eased and a regiment of the 58th Division retook trenches on the northern slope. No counter-attack was possible at Carency and the I Bavarian Reserve Corps concentrated on holding the line from Souchez to Neuville and St. Laurent, which was attacked again during the afternoon.|$|E
25|$|Lamba's highest score 320* {{came in the}} Duleep Trophy Final in 1987-88 for North Zone v West Zone. The West {{might have}} felt very {{satisfied}} with their first innings score of 444, with their captain and Test opener Anshuman Gaekwad making 216. Their opponents, however, had other ideas <b>and</b> <b>replied</b> with 868 all out. Lamba left Gaekwad in the shade with 320 in 720 minutes which was scored off 471 balls including six 6s and thirty 4s. That season he totalled 1097 runs at 84.38. Seven years later he crossed the triple hundred mark again with 312 for Delhi in a Ranji Trophy match versus Himachal Pradesh at Delhi. The hosts ran up 637-3 declared owing much to a first wicket Indian record wicket 464 between Lamba and Ravi Sehgal, who made 216. Lamba's 312 came off 392 balls with two 6s and twenty five 4s and took 567 minutes. These innings and similar knocks, such as his 617 balls 250 for Delhi v Punjab in 1996/97 gained him a somewhat mixed reputation.|$|E
25|$|Meri was a kind-hearted and {{beautiful}} lady and Phra Rothasen {{lived with her}} very happily for some time, but he remembered his blind mother and aunts who still stayed in the dark cave. While showing him the palace, Meri had told Rothasen about certain magic medicines kept in a locked room including Phra Rothasen's mother and aunts's eyes.

Thus one night, after Meri was sleeping, Phra Rothasen stole many medicines and the eyes from the locked room. Meri woke up and looked for her husband but she saw him far away riding his flying horse. She suddenly grew into a giant and followed Phra Rothasen crying and calling him with a loud voice.

50|$|The {{historical}} evidence for Questions <b>and</b> <b>Replies</b> authorship is unclear, but {{the available evidence}} largely refutes the tradition attributing it directly to Li Jing.
