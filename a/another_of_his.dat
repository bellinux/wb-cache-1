5|$|As the {{publication}} date neared, difficulties arose. In January 1869, Dallas asked Trollope {{for permission to}} defer serial publication by three months. As Trollope had agreed not to allow <b>another</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> novels to run serially {{during the first six}} months of The Vicars career, the editor's request would have diminished the author's income. Trollope initially refused, but subsequently agreed to a delay of two months, with publication to begin in early July.|$|E
5|$|Donald became King of Scotland. It is {{not certain}} what {{happened}} next, but an insertion in the Chronicle of Melrose states that Donald forced his three nephews into exile, although he was allied with <b>another</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> nephews, Edmund.

5|$|His {{interest}} in games {{led him to}} propose an early formal definition of a strategy, anticipating John von Neumann's more complete treatment {{of a few years}} later. Consequently, he is considered an early founder of modern game theory. As a result of his work on infinite games Steinhaus, together with <b>another</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> students, Jan Mycielski, proposed the Axiom of determinacy.|$|E
5|$|In A Theory of Content and Other Essays (1990), Fodor {{takes up}} <b>another</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> central notions: the {{question}} of the reality of mental representations.

5|$|Zoologists have {{frequently}} mocked Aristotle for errors and unverified secondhand reports.

The evolutionary zoologist Armand Leroi has taken an interest in Aristotle's biology.|$|E
5|$|Al-Hajj Muhammad {{was born}} in the village of Dhinnaba (today a part of Tulkarm city) in 1892. He belonged to the landowning clan of Samara, itself a part of the larger tribal {{confederation}} of al-Barqawi, which had a long history of activity in the area of Tulkarm. During the invasion of Syria by Napoleon Bonaparte in 1798–99, al-Hajj Muhammad's great-grandfather fought in the Ottoman defense of the country, but was later sentenced to death. <b>Another</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> great-grandfathers participated in the 1834 peasants' revolt against Ibrahim Pasha's rule in Palestine.|$|E

5|$|As {{a result}} of his loan spell at Accrington, Symes was one of five signings made by their manager John Coleman on the same day at the start of {{pre-season}} training in July 2009. Symes scored his first goal of the new season with a late consolation goal for Accrington in a 2–1 League Cup defeat to Queens Park Rangers, before scoring his first league goal later the same week against former team Shrewsbury Town but in another defeat. After an improved run of form, Symes' first two-goal haul for Accrington in a 5–3 victory over <b>another</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> former teams, Crewe Alexandra, helped his new side into the top-half of the League Two table. Symes also scored goals in the FA Cup and the Football League Trophy, helping Accrington to the third round of the former competition and into the northern zone semi-finals against Leeds United in the latter.|$|E
5|$|Brooke {{does not}} marry Noel, but rather spends {{a brief period}} in Munich where he tries to become {{intimate}} with a Belgian girl in order to lose his heterosexual virginity. This relationship also fails, and he returns to England confused about his sexuality. He and Nell continue to remain close until he goes on a vacation with his friends, where he again proposes to <b>another</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> friends. Brooke is refused resulting in a psychological breakdown and an extended absence from Grantchester while he is treated by a London doctor. After a few more months, Brooke returns to the Old Vicarage briefly before departing {{on a trip to}} Tahiti via Canada and the United States. The night before he leaves, Nell realises that she still loves Brooke and goes to Brooke's bed the night before he leaves.|$|E
5|$|Clay, though embittered by <b>another</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> many defeats for the presidency, was appeased by Tyler's {{withdrawal}} from the still-unresolved Senate race, which would permit the election of Rives, and campaigned in Virginia for the Harrison/Tyler ticket. Tyler predicted the Whigs would easily take Virginia; he was embarrassed when he was proved wrong, but was consoled by an overall victory—Harrison and Tyler won by an electoral vote of 234–60 and with 53 {{percent of the popular}} vote. Van Buren took only seven scattered states out of 26. The Whigs gained control of both houses of Congress.|$|E

5|$|Early in 1984–85 York {{were beaten}} by Queens Park Rangers (QPR) in the League Cup, but Byrne {{impressed}} QPR manager Alan Mullery enough {{to earn a}} £100,000 move to Loftus Road. Smith spent half of this sum (a club record) on Aldershot forward Dale Banton, {{who went on to}} score 49 goals in 138 appearances for the club. He also released winger Brian Pollard, but found that the man he signed in his place, Gary Nicholson, was not able to replicate Pollard's form. York started the season well and <b>another</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> signings, Keith Houchen (£15,000), scored a hat-trick in a 7–1 win over Gillingham in November 1984. On 26 January 1975, he guided York to victory over Arsenal in the FA Cup fourth round. In the next round York came from behind to draw 1–1 at home with Liverpool, before losing 7–0 away at Anfield.|$|E
5|$|Fortifications {{and other}} {{structures}} {{were built in}} the rural villages under Zahir's control. In Deir Hanna, Zahir's brother Sa'd built a large fortress and an adjacent mosque, both of which were severely damaged during a siege by Jazzar Pasha in 1776. In Khirbat Jiddin, he rebuilt the demolished Crusader fortress {{with the addition of a}} mosque and hamaam (bathhouse). The mosque was destroyed by Israeli forces when the village was captured during the 1948 Arab-Israeli War. In Shefa-'Amr, Zahir's son Uthman built a large fortress with four towers, of which one remains standing. <b>Another</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> sons, Ahmad, rebuilt the Crusader fortress in Saffuriya.|$|E
5|$|He {{started his}} {{professional}} career between 1803 and 1804, {{in the office}} of Augustine Gascón, officiating as labour counselor for Indians. As a result, he confronted powerful people like the mayors of Cochabamba and Chayanta. He left the city after being threatened, and returned to Buenos Aires in 1805 with his wife Maria Guadalupe Cuenca and their newborn son. Once in the city, he became a reporter of the hearings of the Royal Audiencia, a local appeal court. The Buenos Aires Cabildo, the local council, hired him as an advisor as well. He defended Melchor Fernández, aggrieved by Bishop Benito Lue y Riega, in one of his first cases. In <b>another</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> early disputes he backed the Cabildo in denying the appointment as an ensign of the young Bernardino Rivadavia.|$|E
