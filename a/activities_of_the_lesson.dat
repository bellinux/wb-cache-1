The <b>activities</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>lesson</b> study aimed for developing and enhancing e-portfolio implementation habit carried out done seventh times with the same Cell Biology material. The study was followed by quasi experimental study conducted on two classes, consisting of 26 and 27 students. One class underwent seven meetings of portfolio and another class underwent seven meetings of e-portfolio. The data of the study related to the concept comprehension were obtained by valid and reliable pretest and posttest. The data related to the metacognitive skill were obtained too by the pretest and posttest supported by a special rubric. The data of the lesson study were analyzed qualitatively. The data of the quasi experimental study were analyzed by ANACOVA test, to uncover the difference between the two treatments. The results of the study showed that there were significant effects of the implemented treatment on the metacognitive skill and the cell biology concept comprehension of the students. The average score of the metacognitive skill of e-portfolio class supported by lesson study was 39, 4 % higher than that of the portfolio class. The average score of the concept comprehension of e-portfolio class supported by lesson study was 15 % higher than that of the portfolio class without lesson study.

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} a field {{study in which}} one teacher and one class in Grade 5, with special focus on four pupils, are observed throughout four lessons of about 80 -minutes in Physics. <b>The</b> <b>lessons</b> together deal with a project on Magnetism. <b>The</b> main aim <b>of</b> <b>the</b> thesis is to investigate how the teacher uses texts as a resource when designing and implementing Science lessons (Learning Design Sequences). A further aim is to study what texts are used and produced by both {{the teacher and the}} pupils, and how these texts are used. <b>The</b> four <b>lessons</b> were recorded with a video camera and the recordings supplemented by field notes and interviews. All the texts used were copied or photographed. A design theoretical frame and a sociocultural perspective have been applied to analyse both <b>the</b> presence <b>of</b> texts during different stages (<b>activities)</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>lessons,</b> and to analyse the text-related interaction and communication that has taken place in the classroom. The results confirm several previous studies and show that the teacher is the main producer and consumer of texts before and during <b>the</b> Science <b>lessons.</b> Textbooks, and texts on the Internet, are only used by the teacher to design <b>the</b> <b>lessons,</b> and are then mediated by the teacher during classroom interaction. The pupils mainly read questions, which they write brief answers to, and also read and copy texts written by the teacher on the white board. One interesting finding is that dialogue concerning texts increases the scientific content, which means more empirical or theoretical descriptions and explanations. To become scientifically literate it is therefore argued that pupils need more practice reading and writing in combination with dialogue and activities in the science classroom...|$|R

40|$|Since 2000, {{a network}} of volunteers known as vigías has been engaged in {{community-based}} volcano monitoring, which involves local citizens in <b>the</b> collection <b>of</b> scientific data, around volcán Tungurahua, Ecuador. This paper provides the first detailed description and analysis of this well-established initiative, drawing implications for volcanic risk reduction elsewhere. Based on 32 semi-structured interviews and other qualitative data collected in June and July 2013 with institutional actors and with vigías themselves, the paper documents the origins and development <b>of</b> <b>the</b> network, identifies factors that have sustained it, and analyses {{the ways in which}} it contributes to disaster risk reduction. Importantly, the case highlights how this community-based network performs multiple functions in reducing volcanic risk. The vigías network functions simultaneously as a source of observational data for scientists; as a communication channel for increasing community awareness, understanding of hazard processes and for enhancing preparedness; and as an early warning system for civil protection. Less tangible benefits with nonetheless material consequences include enhanced social capital – through the relationships and capabilities that are fostered – and improved trust between partners. Establishing trust-based relationships between citizens, the vigías, scientists and civil protection authorities is one important factor in the effectiveness and resilience <b>of</b> <b>the</b> network.

Destacando as ações pedagógicas facilitadoras das interações sociais nesse processo de construção do conhecimento. O quadro teórico foi fundamentado na Epistemologia Genética de Jean Piaget e a investigação se delineou como um estudo qualitativo, de caráter descritivo das análises realizadas a partir de observações sistemáticas e entrevistas realizadas com professores de acordo com os princípios da abordagem clínica piagetiana. Os dados coletados indicam a importância das intervenções do professor no trabalho com o conhecimento físico e apontam ao pressuposto que os professores que utilizam de meios empiristas, não conhecem a forma de como se dá a aquisição do conhecimento físico e pouco valorizam o papel das interações sociais nas situações envolvidas nesse processo. No entanto, é possível evidenciar as diferenças que marcam os professores que além do conhecimento teórico sobre o tema e assumem uma postura construtivista buscam a constante promoção de investigações, experimentações e encorajam as interações sociais entre as criançasThe {{objective of}} this work was to investigate <b>the</b> position <b>of</b> four professors <b>of</b> <b>the</b> initial series <b>of</b> basic education, in <b>activities</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> physical knowledge, <b>lessons</b> <b>of</b> Sciences.

Background: National recommendations to increase school-based physical activity and promote academic success advise incorporating movement into traditional classroom lessons. Classroom-based physical activities have favorable associations with indicators of cognitive functioning, academic behaviors, and academic achievement. Purpose: This study analyzed the Active Science framework, which incorporated school-based physical activity within interactive science classroom <b>lessons.</b> Specifically, <b>the</b> study measured <b>the</b> effects <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Active Science framework on student physical activity levels in the classroom, student learning of science inquiry skills and content knowledge, and student perceptions <b>of</b> physical <b>activity</b> and science. A secondary purpose was to evaluate the teachers' perceptions on <b>the</b> implementation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> framework. Subjects: Participants were 37 Hispanic girls (age= 11. 1 ± 0. 8 yr) in mixed 5 th/ 6 th grade science classes in a private, urban middle school. Methods: Physical <b>activity</b> levels <b>of</b> <b>the</b> students during the Active Science framework were measured using pedometers and heart rate monitors. Pre- and post-tests were used to assess <b>the</b> levels <b>of</b> learning achieved by the students in science inquiry skills and content during the Active Science framework. Student perceptions and attitudes toward science and physical activity were measured during student focus groups and pre-post perception surveys. Lesson plan evaluations completed by the teachers and structured interviews provided data on implementation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> framework. Results: Physical activity results showed heart rate (146 ± 9 bpm); maximal heart rate (196 ± 10. 6 bpm); time (35 ± 2. 5 mins); steps (3050 ± 402. 7); calories (99 ± 8. 4 kcal); and distance (1. 1 ± 0. 2 miles) while performing <b>the</b> <b>activity</b> portion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> science <b>lessons</b> were consistent with national recommendations for accumulating school-based physical activity. Significant increases in science content and skills test scores with a 22. 4 % increase (43. 9 % to 66. 3 %; p< 0. 05) from pre to post (p< 0. 05). Students enjoyed <b>the</b> integration <b>of</b> physical <b>activity</b> into science <b>lessons</b> and <b>the</b> teachers described <b>the</b> positive effect <b>of</b> <b>the</b> framework on student interest/engagement. Conclusions: The findings from this study suggest that the Active Science framework helped to promote physical activity, facilitate student learning of science inquiry skills and content knowledge and excite students about integrating physical activity into science lessons...|$|R

The second is to propose a new methodology for improvement <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>lesson,</b> namely, spiral PDCA cycle. This spiral PDCA cycle consists of decision of lesson type by learning outcome at the first stage, PDCA cycle for <b>the</b> <b>lesson</b> according to each quality formation at the second stage, and PDCA cycle with which <b>the</b> <b>lesson</b> is improved by examining and then looking down upon the difference between the relativized view on <b>the</b> <b>lesson,</b> upon which <b>the</b> practitioner depends, and other views on <b>the</b> <b>lesson</b> at <b>the</b> third stage...|$|R
