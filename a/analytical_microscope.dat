It is therefore possible for basin redox evolution to indirectly control early carbonate diagenesis and modify reservoir properties of corresponding shale units. The goals {{of this study were}} to analyze geochemical characteristics of the Late Cretaceous Eagle Ford Group in McMullen County, Texas to test the hypotheses that (1) the redox state of the water column controlled carbonate cement abundance and (2) carbonate cement lowered organic matter content by volumetric dilution. An x-ray <b>analytical</b> <b>microscope</b> was used to map elemental compositions of fresh core samples within the Eagle Ford Group.

Results indicate that cementation occurred early relative to compaction. Ti Kal normalized Mo Kal and CaKal fluorescence intensities are positively correlated throughout the unit, suggesting that carbonate cementation was related to the redox state. Total organic carbon is negatively correlated in the upper Lower Eagle Ford with (Ca Kal) /(Ti Kal) fluorescence ratio, consistent with volumetric dilution of organic matter by diagenetic cementation prior to compaction.

Especially for nanoparticles the behavior of invasion and internal diffusion inside body was visualized using an XSAM (X-ray Scanning <b>Analytical</b> <b>Microscope).</b> The increase of specific surface area is usually counted as nanosizing effect which causes the enhancement of chemical reactivity and therefore toxicity of materials such as carcinogenicity found in 500 nm Ni particles {{for the long term}} implantation in the soft tissue of rat. Even biocompatible materials such as Ti and TiO_ 2 shows stimulus with the decrease of particle size. They cause phagocytosis to cells and inflammation to tissue when the size of particles is below 3 μm.

40|$|A new {{numerical}} {{method has}} been developed that uses the pixel-intensities from X-ray fluorescence (XRF) images to pro-duce mineral-distribution images or maps. The XRF images are obtained using a scanning X-ray <b>analytical</b> <b>microscope</b> (SXAM); the derived mineral-distribution maps {{can be applied to}} study the petrographic characterization of a rock or ores. As a test case, we applied this method to a granite consisting dominantly of quartz, biotite, plagioclase and K-feldspar. Maps of the major elements, including Al, Si, K, Ca and Fe, were obtained with the SXAM. XRF intensity is recorded for each element on a 256 256 pixel map. To transform these element-distribution maps into mineral-distribution maps, we employed the maximum likeli-hood method for a Gaussian distribution, i. e., a least-squares method. The coefficient between XRF intensity and the proportion of a desired mineral was determined from the average value in a few hundred pixels that record the XRF intensity of the desired mineral in isolation. Where one pixel recorded XRF intensity for more than one mineral, its intensity was assumed to have a linear relationship with the composition of the minerals included in the pixel. The proposed least-squares method is an alternative technique to methods using purely image-analysis operations, such as image enhancements, erosions, dilations and image Boolean operations. Experiments with the granite sample showed that the least-squares method gives appropriate mineral-distribution maps if the acquisition time for the XRF maps is sufficiently long, e. g., 48 hours for the granite. The sources of errors in the calculated proportions of the minerals are related to fluctuations of X-ray intensities and variations of chemical composition in each mineral. A method is also proposed to estimate these errors...|$|E
40|$|Two {{types of}} preservative-treated woods, CCA- (chromated copper arsenate) and ACQ- (ammoniacal copper quats) treated specimens, and Taiwania cryptomerioides Hay (Taiwania), {{as a control}} specimen, were used in this study. They {{underwent}} an accelerated weathering test that consisted of QUV degradation for 0, 104, 200, 400, and 800 h. The emission gas concentrations of O 2 and CO 2, the emission contents (CO, SO 2 and NOX) and {{the temperature of the}} emission gases during the combustion of the specimen were measured using Continuous Emission Monitoring (CEM) techniques. X-ray <b>Analytical</b> <b>Microscope</b> (X-ray) Analysis and Elemental Analysis (EA) were used to examine certain residual elements of the char as well as particles from each specimen before combustion. The objectives of this study were to investigate the pollutants from both preservative-treated woods, compare them with those of Taiwania, and assess them as a reference of emission quantity for air pollution. When the specimens that had been subjected to QUV degradation were combusted, the emission gas temperatures of all specimens rose rapidly to about 210 - 235 °C, then increased slowly up to 260 - 270 °C and then lowered back down to a steady temperature in the 210 - 220 °C, shown as a plateau curve. The concentration of O 2 decreased linearly from 20. 7 % to about 16. 4 - 17. 5 %, and the concentration of CO 2 increased from 0. 2 % to about 2. 3 - 3. 4 %. Both O 2 and CO 2 had a close relationship during the combustion. The highest emission quantities of CO and NOX for the CCA- treated specimens were about 264. 5 - 354. 0 and 7. 7 - 13. 0 ppm, and for the ACQ-treated specimens the ranges were 131. 5 - 281. 5 and 23. 5 - 29. 5 ppm, respectively. SO 2 was not found in the emission gases during combustion of either of the preserved specimens.

The result of the EA indicated that prior to combustion, the amount of N (0. 30 %) is higher for the ACQ-treated woods than that for the CCA ones; therefore, the NOX gases during combustion were higher for the ACQ-treated woods...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{basically}} proffers {{a critical}} reexamination {{of the debate}} on the New International Information Order. It mainly accosts two problematic issues viz; the faulty conceptual framework adopted by a majority of the Third World member countries of the Non-Aligned Movement Under the auspicies of UNESCO to address the problems of international communication, and secondly, the inability of researchers - {{as a result of the}} limitations imposed by the North vs South polarization of the debate and the Third World leader's pedestrian conceptualization of the problems at hand - to focus on the operations of the Third World media in order to arrive at much more comprehensive generalizations. The starting point of this thesis is that it is not enough to concentrate on only one side of the coin. To fully understand the interconnections of neocolonialism and its symptomatic manifestations in the field of information and communication, we have to go beyond the polemical stance the debate and current research assumed. That is, it is not enough to accuse or heap all the blames on imperialism and neocolonialism. It is obvious most of the accusations levelled against the media of the advanced capitalist countries in their portrayal of the Third World countries are valid. But, to get to the roots of the problems i. e., the underlying causes of these problems at large, there is also a fundamental need to put the Third World media themselves under the same <b>analytical</b> <b>microscope.</b> It is with this in mind that we set out to analyse how the African media cover and project African affairs, taking Libya as a case study. The rational behind this endeavour is that since the African states have been accusing the media of the capitalist countries of ill treatment by negatively portraying them, the African media would somewhat cover and portray other African states in a more positive manner, particularly in the period of the debate and in its aftermath. Our results suggests the opposite. That is, there is no fundamental difference in how Libya was covered and projected to the outside world by both the African media in our sample (The Nigerian Daily Times, The Tanzanian Daily News and The Nairobi Standard) and The Times of London in the period 1970 - 1986. This we believe suggests that both the Third World media and the media of the advanced capitalist nations share some characteristics that makes them to operate along similar lines. They are to a certain extent, two sides of the same coin, which might suggest that, what we are confronted with in the field of international communication is a paradox of "a one world with a one voice" when it comes to the coverage of some contentious issues that threaten what is normally projected as the norm in society. Although these findings are tentative, we hope they will open avenues for further research in our efforts to fully understand the complexities not only of the information sector, but the whole institutional structures that underlie and give bearing to international relations, politics and economics...|$|E
