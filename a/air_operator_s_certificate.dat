Because it neither possessed, nor had it applied for, an <b>Air</b> <b>Operator's</b> Certification from the Civil Aviation Authority (United Kingdom), Varsity Express was never subject to the regulatory scrutiny (with respect to financial backing and the sustainability of the proposed operation) that would have applied to a start-up carrier seeking to secure its own <b>Air</b> <b>Operator's</b> Certificate.|$|R
