40|$|In {{this paper}} approximations <b>and</b> <b>inequalities</b> for the {{distribution}} of a scan statistic for 0 - 1 Bernoulli trials are reviewed. Bonferroni-type <b>inequalities</b> <b>and</b> product-type approximations <b>and</b> <b>inequalities</b> will be discussed. These approximations <b>and</b> <b>inequalities</b> will be compared with Poisson-type approximations. A simulation study is presented to facilitate the comparison of these approximations <b>and</b> <b>inequalities.</b> Based on the numerical results {{it is evident that}} the standard Poisson approximation can be significantly improved.

25|$|A trade liberalization-versus-inequality graph has a {{measures}} trade openness {{along the}} x-axis <b>and</b> <b>inequality</b> along the y-axis. Dobson and Ramlogan determine trade openness by {{the ratio of}} exports and imports (the total trade) and the average tariff rate; inequality is determined by gross primary school enrolment rates, the share of agriculture in total output, the rate of inflation, and cumulative privatization. By studying data from several Latin American countries that have implemented trade liberalization policies in the past 30 years, the Kuznets curve seems {{to apply to the}} relationship between trade liberalization <b>and</b> <b>inequality</b> (measured by the GINI coefficient). However, many of these nations saw a shift from low-skill labour production to natural resource intensive activities. This shift would not benefit low-skill workers as much. So although their evidence seems to support the Kuznets theory in relation to trade liberalization, Dobson and Ramlogan assert that policies for redistribution must be simultaneously implemented in order to mitigate the initial increase in inequality felt.|$|E
