500|$|In {{addition}} to these supposed messages in [...] "Back Off Boogaloo", observers have viewed the song title as Starr's rebuke to McCartney to abandon his legal stand against the Beatles and Apple Corps, which was placed in receivership in March 1971 after a High Court judge found in McCartney's favour. Author Keith Badman writes that [...] "Boogaloo" [...] had [...] "long been cited as Paul's nickname" [...] from his former bandmates Starr, Lennon and George Harrison. While acknowledging that in subsequent years Starr might have chosen to minimise any ill-feeling towards McCartney, Rodriguez notes that the lyrics [...] "just happened to fit perfectly into the 'us vs. Paul' mindset" [...] following the Beatles' break-up, {{to the extent that}} [...] "Back Off Boogaloo" [...] was [...] "as damning as 'Early 1970' had been conciliatory". When tailoring his 1970 composition [...] "I'm the Greatest" [...] for Starr to record on the album Ringo (1973), Lennon referenced the song title with the lines [...] "Now I'm only thirty-two / And <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> is boogaloo".|$|E
500|$|Amanda Mealing plays Colonel Eleanor Grant, a [...] "smart, tough {{military}} leader who is skilled {{with a gun}} and diplomacy, but knows when to break a rule or two." [...] She is the new head of Section 20, replacing Hugh Collinson from the first series. Mealing described Grant as [...] "hard as nails," [...] "very contained, very direct," [...] and [...] "very driven." [...] Grant is also very distant from her team; [...] "she commands so she is not their pal but, at the same time, the guys are like her family. They spend so much time together moving from place to place. But, in a kind of motherly way, she has to keep them in check and sometimes they need a firm hand." [...] The actress called her role [...] "the best role I've ever had," [...] adding [...] "when I'm doing action scenes like flying in helicopters, the hardest thing is to keep a serious face as <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> is scream for joy." [...] She researched for her role by taking advice from a female officer in a similar high-ranking position as Grant is. One piece of advice the officer gave Mealing was [...] "you mustn't try {{to be one of the}} boys or they'll lose respect for you, but you've got to be in charge." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{following}} {{track is}} the EDM song [...] "Break Free". The song combines the EDM and electro genres. In {{an interview with}} Billboard, Grande described the song as [...] "fantastic and super-experimental for [...] " [...] and stated: [...] "I never thought I'd do an EDM song, but that was an eye-opening experience, and now <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> is dance." [...] The album's first of three ballads, [...] "Best Mistake", features Big Sean. Billboard described it as [...] "A moody ballad that grows stickier upon each listen, [...] "Best Mistake" [...] carries a tidy collection of impressive production details, the momentary string stabs among them". Musically, it is a minimal hip-hop piano ballad lament that utilizes instrumentation from strings and a drum machine. It tells {{a story about a}} couple trying to [...] "make up their minds about the future of their relationship, with deep affection buried underneath their problems." [...] "Be My Baby" [...] featuring Cashmere Cat is a [...] "bouncy R jam". The song was compared with Mariah Carey's songs. The eighth track, [...] "Break Your Heart Right Back", featuring Childish Gambino, is about her boyfriend cheating on her with a man and contains the lyrics [...] "I know youâ€™re mad 'cause I found out / Want you to feel what I feel right now". The song interpolates Diana Ross's [...] "I'm Coming Out." ...|$|E
