5|$|The 13th century saw popular {{outbursts of}} ecstatic piety {{in support of}} the Crusades such as that {{resulting}} in the Children's Crusade in 1212. Large groups of young adults and children spontaneously gathered, believing their innocence would enable success where their elders had failed. Few, if any at all, journeyed to the Eastern Mediterranean. Though little reliable evidence survives for these events, they provide <b>an</b> <b>indication</b> <b>of</b> <b>how</b> hearts and minds could be engaged for the cause.|$|E

5|$|The {{launch of}} the ZX81 was catalysed {{in part by the}} British Broadcasting Corporation's plan to produce a TV series, to be {{broadcast}} in 1982, aimed at popularising computing and programming. The BBC intended to commission an existing manufacturer to provide it with a BBC-branded home computer to tie in with the series. When Sinclair got wind of the project in December 1980, he wrote to the BBC informing them that he would be announcing {{a new version of the}} ZX80, to be called the ZX81, in early 1981. It would remedy some of the ZX80's deficiencies and would be both cheaper and more advanced. Sinclair naturally wanted the ZX81 to be a candidate for the BBC contract and lobbied for its adoption. He pointed out that there were already 40,000 users of the ZX80 and that by the time the series was broadcast there were likely to be upwards of 100,000 ZX81 users (which turned out to be an underestimate by over 400,000 – <b>an</b> <b>indication</b> <b>of</b> <b>how</b> the ZX81's success exceeded even Sinclair's expectations).|$|E

5|$|During {{the final}} {{training}} sessions in Tokyo, Talbot organised time trials for the Australians, which {{were held in}} front of opposition swimmers {{in an attempt to}} intimidate them. O'Brien posted a time of 2min 33s, which Talbot felt had a negative psychological effect on O'Brien's opponents. When competition started, O'Brien swam an Olympic record to win the first heat by 2.0s. He posted a time of 2min 31.4s, reducing the previous Olympic mark by 5.8s, <b>an</b> <b>indication</b> <b>of</b> <b>how</b> much the world record had fallen in the preceding four years. However, in the next heat, Egon Henninger of Germany immediately lowered the mark, {{and by the end of}} the heats, O'Brien was the fourth fastest qualifier for the semifinals, with both Prokopenko and Jastremski posting faster times. O'Brien lowered Henninger's Olympic record by winning the second semifinal in a time of 2min 28.7s, after Jastremski had won the first semifinal in a time that was 3.4s slower than O'Brien. This made O'Brien the fastest qualifier for the final, with a time that was 1.0s faster than the next qualifier Prokopenko, who came second to him in the second semifinal. O'Brien planned to swim the race at an even pace and record even splits for the first and second half of the race. He was mindful of not chasing Jastremski, who was known for an aggressive opening style, which resulted in a faster first half.|$|E

[...] For instance, she would not allow crew members to talk directly to her; they had to talk to her representatives, lest they distract her from the business at hand. She also forbade her dancers from speaking to her and her musicians were not permitted to even look at her unless they were onstage with her. Moreover, when coming on and off the stage, Madonna demanded that road managers hold sheets around her in order to shield her from the eyes of [...] "those who couldn't help but stare". DeMann commented: [...] "She has a way of demanding that compels you to give her your undivided attention", to which Taraborrelli felt that such behavior actually was <b>an</b> <b>indication</b> <b>of</b> <b>how</b> successful and strong Madonna was.

500|$|Players fight enemies using a {{combination}} of physical attacks, weapon skills, and magical attacks; these battles form the basis of party play in Final Fantasy XIV: A Realm Reborn. Most battle content in the game requires parties of a specific size, including four players for instanced dungeons and eight players for boss battles. The [...] "Duty Finder" [...] is an automated matching feature that sorts players into parties for selected instanced content across different servers. The [...] "Party Finder" [...] is a server-specific bulletin board where players may recruit other players for any kind of content including dungeons, raid battles, FATE parties, and more. Members of a party fill traditional MMORPG roles like tank, healer, support, and damage dealer. Party play revolves around the concept of [...] "enmity", which is <b>an</b> <b>indication</b> <b>of</b> <b>how</b> hostile an enemy is toward a particular player. Enmity is generated by performing offensive actions and lost using certain abilities. Each enemy will focus its attacks toward the player with the most enmity and management of enmity is important for successfully completing tougher encounters.

500|$|A {{building}} {{dubbed the}} Gordian Palace is located further up the Decumanus Maximus. It {{was the largest}} building {{in the city and}} was probably the residence of the governor, rather than the emperor Gordian III; it was rebuilt during Gordian's reign in the mid-3rd century. It combined two separate houses to create a complex of 74 rooms with courtyards and private bathhouses serving both domestic and official functions. It also incorporated a colonnaded front with a dozen shops behind the colonnade, and an oil factory consisting of three oil presses and an oil store in the north-east corner of the complex. The decoration of the Gordian Palace is today quite plain with only a few scanty mosaics remaining. Despite its presumed high status, the floors seem to have been mostly rendered with opus sectile rather than decorated with mosaics. Inscriptions found in the palace testify to the city's decline and eventual fall. They record a series of treaties reached with the local Berber chieftains, increasing in number as the city became more vulnerable and the tribesmen pressed harder. By the time of the final treaty, just a few years before the fall of the city, the chieftains were being treated as virtual equals of Rome– <b>an</b> <b>indication</b> <b>of</b> <b>how</b> much Roman power in the area had declined.
