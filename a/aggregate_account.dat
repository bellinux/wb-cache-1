The system of {{multiple}} exchange rates combined with the highly regulated trade regime caused both imports and exports to drop each from about US$4.5 billion in 1996 to less than US$3 billion in 2002. The success of stabilization and currency liberalization in 2003 has led to significant increases in exports and imports in recent years, although imports have increased much less rapidly: while exports had more than doubled to US$15.5 by 2011, imports had risen to US$6.5 billion only, reflecting {{the impact of the}} government's import substitution policies designed to maintain hard currency reserves. Draconian tariffs, sporadic border closures, and border crossing [...] "fees" [...] {{have a negative effect on}} legal imports of both consumer products and capital equipment. Uzbek farmers are deprived of seasonal opportunities to sell legally their popular tomatoes and vegetables for good prices in Kazakhstan. Instead, they are forced to dump their produce at reduced prices on local markets or alternatively continue [...] "exporting" [...] by paying stiff bribes to border guards and customs officers. Uzbek consumers are deprived of access to low-cost Chinese goods that cross the border from Kyrgyzstan in normal times. Uzbekistan's traditional trade partners are the Commonwealth of independent States (CIS) countries, notably Russia, Ukraine, and Kazakhstan, which in <b>aggregate</b> <b>account</b> for over 40% of its exports and imports. Non-CIS partners have been increasing in importance in recent years, with Turkey, China, Iran, South Korea, and the EU being the most active.

We first show that focusing on the 100 largest firms offers a cost-effective way to extract information embedded in accounting profitability data of the entire stock market portfolio. We then show that <b>accounting</b> profitability data <b>aggregated</b> across the 100 largest firms have predictive content for subsequent real Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth. We also show that stock market returns have predictive content for future real GDP growth, while their predictive power varies with {{the length of the}} measurement window with annual stock market returns being the most powerful. Importantly, we find that the predictive content of our indices of <b>aggregate</b> <b>accounting</b> profitability drivers is incremental to that of annual stock market returns. An in-depth investigation of consensus survey forecasts shows that professional macro forecasters revise their expectations of real economic activity {{in the direction of the}} predictive content of <b>aggregate</b> <b>accounting</b> profitability drivers and stock market returns. Although macro forecasters are fully attuned to stock market return data, their forecasts of real GDP growth can be improved in a statistically and economically significant way using our indices of <b>aggregate</b> <b>accounting</b> profitability drivers. Our findings suggest that professional macro forecasters and stock market investors do not fully impound the predictive content of <b>aggregate</b> <b>accounting</b> profitability drivers when forecasting real economic activity. In additional analysis, we examine the association between stock market returns and the portion of subsequent real GDP growth that is predictable based on our indices of <b>aggregate</b> <b>accounting</b> profitability drivers but that is not anticipated by stock market investors.

In the present study, we have evaluated the volatile metabolites produced by 100 clinical isolates belonging to ten distinct pathogen groups that, in <b>aggregate,</b> <b>account</b> for 90 % of bloodstream infections, 90 % of urinary tract infections, and 80 % of infections encountered {{in the intensive care unit}} setting. Headspace volatile metabolites produced in vitro were concentrated using headspace solid-phase microextraction and analyzed via two-dimensional gas chromatography time-of-flight mass spectrometry (HS-SPME-GC×GC-TOFMS). A total of 811 volatile metabolites were detected across all samples, of which 203 were: 1) detected in 9 or 10 (of 10) isolates belonging to one or more pathogen groups, and 2) significantly more abundant in cultures relative to sterile media. Network analysis revealed a distinct metabolic fingerprint associated with each pathogen group, and analysis via Random Forest (RF) using leave-one-out cross-validation (LOOCV) resulted in a 95 % accuracy for the differentiation between groups. The present findings support the results of prior studies that have reported on the differential production of volatile metabolites across pathogenic bacteria and fungi, and provide additional insight through the inclusion of pathogen groups that have seldom been studied previously, including Acinetobacter spp., coagulase-negative Staphylococcus, and Proteus mirabilis, as well as the utilization of HS-SPME-GC×GC-TOFMS for improved sensitivity and resolution relative to traditional gas chromatography-based techniques.

40|$|Life story {{methods were}} used to explore the contextual factors that {{influenced}} the experiences and identity formation of seven Native American adults who were transracially adopted prior {{to the passage of}} the Indian Child Welfare Act of 1978. These methods provided a deeper understanding of how these individuals have integrated their adoption experiences into their evolving sense of self. The life story methodology offered a way to acknowledge and validate participants 2 ̆ 7 life experiences and allowed for the collection of rich information from the perspectives of the adoptees. The life story interviews were structured to gather information on the influence of one 2 ̆ 7 s adoptive family and cultural, social, and educational experiences on participants 2 ̆ 7 developing sense of self. Even though an interview guide was developed for use in the study, each story uniquely unfolded in a manner the participant was comfortable sharing. The study examined the life stories for patterns or emerging themes related to identity development at different points in the narrators 2 ̆ 7 life cycles in order to develop an <b>aggregate</b> <b>account</b> of the contextual factors influencing identity formation as well as a collective understanding of sense of self. The study identified 12 contextual factors that have both positively and negatively influenced identity development among the participants throughout their lifespan. These factors are: (1) adoptive family; (2) community; (3) educational experiences; (4) religion/spirituality; (5) travel; (6) exposure to cultural experiences; (7) employment; (8) friendships; (9) peer groups; (10) military; (11) societal messages, and (12) reconnection to tribal heritage.

Practice considerations for transracial adoptees as well as adoptive parents are suggested. Policy implications relating to granting access to original birth and/or adoption related records are presented. Finally, future research recommendations are offered specific to Native American transracial adoptees, their biological families, and tribal communities from which they adopted.

40|$|International {{environmental}} cooperation is gaining {{more and more}} importance in a world with global climate change. The problem of climate change is caused by emissions of Greenhouse Gases (GHG). With transboundary GHG pollution, however, there is currently no a world government that is able to force polluters {{to take into account}} the damage cost of other countries caused by their pollution. This differentiates international {{environmental cooperation}} from the issue of domestic environmental regulation in which a regulator is present. This thesis contains three chapters that study international environmental cooperation. The first two chapters are game-theoretic analyses, while the third one is empirical. A significant reduction in global GHG emissions requires (i) cooperation of countries in emission abatement and (ii) the development of technology. Chapter 1 covers both topics (i) and (ii). Chapter 2 investigates the implications of climate policymaking for the development of abatement technology in small countries. Chapter 3 is concerned with the effect of an important climate treaty – the Framework Convention of Climate Change. Abatement of GHG emissions is a global public good. An international environmental agreement (IEA) is a coalition mechanism that aims to overcome the free-riding problem underlying this public good game. Much of the IEA theory relies on a particular type of participation game in which countries individually decide whether to join or stay out of an IEA and the resulting IEA makes abatement decisions for its members. Chapter 1 modifies the canonical model that is used to study IEAs, considering both mixed and pure strategies at the participation stage, and including a prior cost-reducing investment stage. The use of mixed strategies at the participation stage reverses a familiar result and also its policy implication: with mixed strategies, equilibrium participation and welfare is higher in equilibria that involve higher investment. Nations’ use of mixed rather than pure strategies creates endogenous risk; the equilibrium participation probability increases with risk aversion. The previous literature on climate policy pays insufficient attention to the role of small countries, which, in the <b>aggregate,</b> <b>account</b> for a substantial proportion of the global GHG emission. Chapter 2 investigates how alternative climate policy instruments and learning about environmental damage affect ex ante investment in the adoption of technology in small countries. I consider three policy instruments that are widely discussed in the current debate on climate policymaking: emission standard, harmonized taxes and auctioned emission permits. I identify and discuss three effects that reduce investment efficiency: the effect of uncertain participation, the strategic effect on participation and the strategic effect on regulation. Either with both learning and quadratic abatement costs or without learning, harmonized taxes outperform emission standard and auctioned permits in terms of investment efficiency. Interestingly, when learning is infeasible, a large cost of staying out of the international environmental agreement could be beneficial. Whether or not learning improves investment efficiency depends on the size of this nonparticipation cost. The IEA theory is generally pessimistic regarding the chance of a treaty with legally-binding restrictions in solving the climate change problem. A natural question thus arises: how about a climate treaty without legally-binding restrictions? Chapter 3 aims to answer this question using a real world example. Before 2005 when Kyoto Protocol was put into force, the Framework Convention of Climate Change (FCCC) did not impose any legally-binding restrictions on GHG emissions. Carbon dioxide is a main GHG. In Chapter 3, I investigate the effect of FCCC membership on countries’ carbon emissions during the period of 1992 - 2004. I find out positive and significant effects of FCCC membership on the control of carbon emissions in the Annex I (industrialized) countries. Although a number of non-Annex I countries were attracted to the FCCC, the FCCC membership had no significant impacts on the carbon emissions of these non-Annex I countries. This fact highlights the canonical tradeoff of extensive margin and intensive margin in coalition formation...|$|E
