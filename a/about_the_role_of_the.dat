5|$|After {{receiving}} highly exaggerated reports <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>role</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Christians {{and their}} {{help to the}} British during the Second Anglo-Mysore War, Tipu decided to minimise the threat to his kingdom from the British and banish the Christians of Canara. According to Severine Silva, this decision was the logical outcome of the plans he had nurtured {{since the time of}} the conquest of Mangalore with his father Hyder in 1768.|$|E
5|$|For {{the first}} half of the 20th century, due to a {{widespread}} distrust of permanent military forces in Australia, the reserve military forces were the primary focus of Australian military planning. Following the end of World War II, however, this focus gradually shifted due to the changing strategic environment, and the requirement for a higher readiness force available to support collective security goals. Since then, Australian defence policy has been focused more upon the Regular Army, and there has been considerable debate <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>role</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Army Reserve within defence planning circles. As the strategic situation has evolved in the post Cold War era, the organisation, structure, training and role of the Army Reserve has undergone considerable changes, and members of the Army Reserve are increasingly being used on overseas deployments, not only within Regular Army units, but also in units drawn almost entirely from Reserve units.|$|E
5|$|In March 1944, the {{battalion}} returned to Australia for rest and re-organisation, sailing on the transport Clip Fontain. Although the Australian Army had been heavily committed to combat {{operations in the}} Pacific {{in the early years}} of the war against Japan, by 1944 the United States military had assumed primary responsibility for combat operations in the Pacific and this had resulted in uncertainty <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>role</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Australian Army in future operations. As a result, a long period of training followed, and there was a significant turn over of personnel within the 9th Division as many men were discharged due to medical reasons or transferred to other units and young replacements were brought in. After concentrating at Ravenshoe in May 1944, {{the battalion}} was rebuilt, focusing on individual training and then collective training up to battalion level. After this, in September 1944, the battalion moved to Trinity Beach, close to Cairns, where amphibious training was conducted. Further training continued throughout October and November 1944. At the end of the year, the tempo dropped off and the battalion's personnel were occupied with sporting activities prior to leave in February and March 1945. Finally, in early May 1945, the battalion moved to Townsville where it boarded the transport David C. Shanks, bound for Morotai Island.|$|E

25|$|During the Kościuszko Uprising in 1794, {{under the}} {{influence}} of revolutionary France and Enlightenment ideas <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>role</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> militia, pospolite ruszenie was redefined as consisted of not only the nobility, but all able-bodied males between 18 and 40 years of age. In 1806, by decree of Napoleon, the pospolite ruszenie in the Duchy of Warsaw served for a short period as the reserve force and recruitment pool for the regular army. During the November Uprising in 1831, the Sejm (Polish Parliament) called for pospolite ruszenie recruits from the ages of 17 to 50, but that plan was opposed by General Jan Zygmunt Skrzynecki.|$|E
25|$|The ABC {{has made}} a {{significant}} contribution to television drama with popular series like Brides of Christ, and to comedy with the 1970s hits Aunty Jack and The Norman Gunston Show and more recently Roy & HG, Kath & Kim and The Chaser's War On Everything. Debate <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>role</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ABC continues; many assign it a marginal role, as commercial TV and radio stations are far more popular choices. Critics claim that Australian children view television programs imported largely from the US, however, the Australian Content Standard requires all free-to-air commercial networks to broadcast an annual minimum of 55% Australian content between 6a.m. and midnight. American dramas and comedies rate well on Australian TV.|$|E
25|$|Birmingham has a {{distinctive}} culture {{of art and}} design that emerged in the 1750s, driven by the historic importance of the applied arts to the city's manufacturing economy. While other early industrial towns such as Manchester and Bradford were based on the manufacture of bulk commodities such as cotton and wool, Birmingham's economy from the 18th century onwards was built on the production of finished manufactured goods for European luxury markets. The sale of these products was dependent on high-quality design, and this resulted in the early growth of an extensive infrastructure for the education of artists and designers and for exhibiting their works, and placed Birmingham at the heart of debate <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>role</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> visual arts in the emerging industrial society.|$|E

In 1986, the court sat in Louisville, and in May 1987, it sat in both Owensboro and Paducah {{in the western part of}} the state. In 1988, however, Court of Appeals justice Dan Jack Combs objected to the court's plan to sit in Ashland, Pikeville, and Hazard, claiming the move was designed to help 7th District Justice James B. Stephenson retain his seat on the court. Combs was Stephenson's challenger in the election, and Ashland, Pikeville, and Hazard were the three most populous cities in the district. Stephens claimed the timing of the court's tour through the eastern part of the state was coincidental. Combs ultimately won a convincing victory in the election.|$|E
25|$|Barruel’s Memoirs is {{considered}} one of the founding documents of the right-wing interpretation of the French Revolution. It became popular immediately after it was published and was read and commented on by most of the important literary and political journals of the day. The four volumes of the text were published in a number of languages and created a debate <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>role</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> philosophes, their ideas, and the Enlightenment in the French Revolution. They remained in print well into the 20th century and contributed to the historical interpretation of the late 18th century in France. The success of Barruels work is testimony to the anti-philosophical discourse that spread in the aftermath of the revolution. Barruel left behind a construction of the Enlightenment that was destined to influence subsequent interpretations. He wound accusations tightly around his foes and tied them into positions from which they could not escape. The text created a link between the Enlightenment and the Revolution and this connection remains a topic of historical debate.|$|E
25|$|BIND {{offers several}} “features” {{that many other}} {{proteomics}} databases do not include. The authors of this program have created an extension to traditional IUPAC nomenclature to help describe post-translational modifications that occur to amino acids. These modifications include: acetylation, formylation, methylation, palmitoylation, etc. {{the extension of the}} traditional IUPAC codes allows these amino acids to be represented in sequence form as well. BIND also utilizes a unique visualization tool known as OntoGlyphs. The OntoGlyphs were developed based on Gene Ontology (GO) and provide a link back to the original GO information. A number of GO terms have been grouped into categories, each one representing a specific function, binding specificity, or localization in the cell. There are 83 OntoGlyph characters in total. There are 34 functional OntoGlyphs which contain information <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>role</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> molecule (e.g. cell physiology, ion transport, signaling). There are 25 binding OntoGlyphs which describe what the molecule binds (e.g. ligands, DNA, ions). The other 24 OntoGlyphs provide information about the location of the molecule within a cell (e.g. nucleus, cytoskeleton). The OntoGlyphs can be selected and manipulated to include or exclude certain characteristics from search results. The visual nature of the OntoGlyphs also facilitates pattern recognition when looking at search results. ProteoGlyphs are graphical representations of the structural and binding properties of proteins at the level of conserved domains. The protein is diagrammed as a straight horizontal line and glyphs are inserted to represent conserved domains. Each glyph is displayed to represent the relative position and length of its alignment in the protein sequence.|$|E

25|$|Another {{problem that}} was {{encountered}} as the LDV was organised was {{the definition of}} the role the organisation was to play. In the eyes of the War Office and the army, the LDV was to act as 'an armed police constabulary' which {{in the event of an}} invasion was to observe German troop movements, convey information to the regular forces and guard places of strategic or tactical importance. The War Office believed that the LDV would act best in such a passive role because of its lack of training, weapons and proper equipment. However such a role clashed with the expectations of LDV commanders and members, who believed that the organisation would be best suited to an active role, attacking and harassing German forces. This clash led to morale problems and even more complaints to the press and the War Office from LDV members who were opposed to, as they saw it, the government leaving them defenceless and placing them in a non-combatant role. Complaints <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>role</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> LDV, as well as continuing problems encountered by the War Office in its attempts to clothe and arm the LDV, led the government to respond to public pressure in August, redefining the role of the LDV to include delaying and obstructing German forces through any means possible. At the same time Winston Churchill, who had assumed the position of prime minister in May, became involved in the matter after being alerted to the problems, obtaining a summary of the current LDV position from the War Office on 22 June. After reviewing the summary, Churchill wrote to Eden stating that, in his opinion, one of the main causes of disciplinary and morale problems stemmed from the uninspiring title of the LDV and suggesting that it be renamed as the 'Home Guard'. Despite resistance from Eden and other government officials, who noted that one million 'LDV' armbands had already been printed and the cost of printing another million 'Home Guard' armbands would be excessive, Churchill would not be dissuaded; on 22 July the LDV was officially renamed the Home Guard.|$|E

500|$|Tipu {{received}} highly exaggerated reports <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>role</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Mangalorean Catholics {{and their}} {{help to the}} British in the Second Anglo-Mysore War. To minimise the British threat to his kingdom and in the Sultan-ul-Tawarikh, due to [...] "the rage of Islam that began to boil in his breast", Tipu banished the Mangalorean Catholic community from their lands, and imprisoned them at Seringapatam, the capital of his empire. The captivity of Mangalorean Catholics at Seringapatam, which began on 24 February 1784 and ended on 4 May 1799, remains the most disconsolate memory in their history.|$|E
