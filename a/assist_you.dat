500|$|Apparently as {{result of}} poor {{communications}} with Lord Germain, Britain's Secretary of State for the Colonies {{and the political}} official {{in charge of the}} conflict, General Howe [...] decided instead to attempt the capture of Philadelphia, and [...] sailed south with much of his army in July, leaving Sir Henry Clinton in command at New York. [...] Howe's instructions to General Clinton were primarily to hold New York City, and to only engage in offensive operations that were consistent with that goal. [...] His instructions to Clinton on July 30 included a promise that reinforcements would arrive (but without any promised time), and that Clinton should consider making a move [...] "in favor or General Burgoyne's approaching Albany, with security to Kingsbridge" [...] if the opportunity presented itself. [...] A letter from Howe reached Burgoyne on August 3 informing him of his move to Philadelphia, and of Clinton's instructions. [...] Clinton wrote a letter on September 12 (received by Burgoyne on the 21st, after the Battle of Freeman's Farm) that he would [...] "make a push at [...] Montgomery in about ten days" [...] if [...] "you think 2000 men can <b>assist</b> <b>you</b> effectually".|$|E

2500|$|In February 1815, Commodore John Rodgers was {{appointed}} the President of the Board of Navy Commissioners. [...] The law creating the Board gave it authority over procurement of naval stores, supplies and material as these {{related to the}} construction of naval vessels, outfitting of ships, armament and equipment plus oversight authority over naval shipyards, stations and dry-docks. The BNC also regulating civilian employment and pay. Serving with Rodgers on the Board were Commodores David Porter and Isaac Hull. The BNC found all current yards to have shortcomings. One of the most important recommendations the BNC made during Rodgers tenure was that only Portsmouth and Boston Navy Yard were suitable for the building of large ships in all seasons. Though the BNC recommended Washington Navy Yard be retained its report noted, “The Yard at Washington, when viewed as building yard only, would be less objectionable [...] were the navigation deeper and the obstructions fewer. But it is the decided opinion of the Board, that the obstructions and its distance from the sea render it unsuitable for every other purpose.” [...] The Board recommended Baltimore, Norfolk and Charleston navy yards be closed. These recommendations were controversial and became the subject of considerable partisanship, with only Baltimore and Charleston eventually phased out of existence. The BNC final report was in fact, highly critical of the Washington Navy Yard and its business practices. Writing on 11 May 1815 to Commodore Thomas Tingey the BNC stated, [...] "The Board are about contracting for the repairs of the Black Smith shop in the Navy Yard under your command for the purpose of employing workmen to put in order for service & a state of preservation ... It is the intention of the Board of the Navy Commissioners, to reestablish the Navy Yard at this place, as a building Yard only, & while stating to you this intention, it may not be improper for them to make you acquainted with their views generally with respect to the establishment. They have witnessed in many of our Navy Yards & this particularly pressure in the employment of characters unsuited for the public service – maimed & unmanageable slaves for the accommodation of distressed widows & orphans & indigent families - apprentices for the accommodation of their masters – & old men & children for the benefit of their families & parents [...] These practices must cease – none must be employed but for the advantage of the public, & this Yard instead of rendering the navy odious to the nation from the scenes of want & extravagance which it has too long exhibited must serve as a model on which to prefect a general system of economy. In making to you,- Sir, these remarks the Navy Commissioners are aware that you have with themselves long witnessed the evils of which they complain, & which every countenance will be given to <b>assist</b> <b>you</b> in remedying them, they calculate with confidence on a disposition on your part to forward the public interests.” [...] From November 1824 through May 1827, he commanded the Mediterranean Squadron. After his final naval command, returned to New York where he became the Navy agent at the port there.|$|E
