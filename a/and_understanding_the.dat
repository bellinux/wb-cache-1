5|$|Unlike audible {{signatures}}, tornadic signatures {{have been}} isolated; {{due to the}} long distance propagation of low-frequency sound, efforts are ongoing to develop tornado prediction and detection devices with additional value in understanding tornado morphology, dynamics, and creation.

5|$|Operation Shed Light was a crash {{development}} project in aerial warfare, initiated in 1966 by the United States Air Force {{to increase the}} ability to accurately strike at night or in adverse weather. During the 1960s the United States military worked hard to interdict the movement of men and materiel along the Ho Chi Minh trail. The North Vietnamese were experts {{in the use of}} weather and darkness to conceal their movement, <b>and</b> <b>understanding</b> <b>the</b> superiority of American air power put their skills immediately to good use. US forces seeking to impede the steady flow of supplies attempted to locate largely static targets during the day with poor results.|$|E

5|$|Gupte {{described}} his character as mercurial, and found playing him a physical delight. Gupte said his character keeps the frame unpredictable {{and that it}} provided him with a foil to express rage and anguish. He worked a lot on his characterisation and tried to bring in his own references from European and Japanese cinema. Chandan Roy Sanyal {{described his}} character Mikhail as provocative, mad, wicked and humorous. Subramnayam and Joshi, who played Lobo and Lele respectively, described their characters as the most corrupt policemen in their department at the Anti-Narcotics Bureau. They said that {{to prepare for the}} roles they followed the script and Bhardwaj's instructions to get the characters right. Mukherjee prepared for his role as Mujeeb by reading the script <b>and</b> <b>understanding</b> <b>the</b> characters, and discussing it with Bhardwaj. Dutta, who played Shumona Bengali criminal involved in fixing horse races and arms dealingsaid {{that he did not have}} much time to prepare for his role because he was given the script after he arrived in Mumbai, where Bhardwaj briefed him.|$|E

Gage founded the Stanford Center for Research and Development in Teaching, which contributed research on teaching as well as influencing the education of important educational psychologists.|$|E

Transition Team training is focused training preparing teams to train, mentor and advise Iraqi and Afghan security forces.

25|$|The vagina and vulva have evoked strong {{reactions}} in societies throughout history, including negative perceptions and language, cultural taboos, {{and their use}} as symbols for female sexuality, spirituality, or regeneration of life. In common speech, the word vagina {{is often used to}} refer to the vulva or to the female genitals in general. By its dictionary and anatomical definitions, however, vagina refers exclusively to the specific internal structure, <b>and</b> <b>understanding</b> <b>the</b> distinction can improve knowledge of the female genitalia and aid in health care communication.|$|E

25|$|Biological {{psychiatry}} is {{a branch}} of psychiatry where the focus is chiefly on researching <b>and</b> <b>understanding</b> <b>the</b> biological basis of major mental disorders such as unipolar and bipolar affective (mood) disorders, schizophrenia and organic mental disorders such as Alzheimer's disease. This knowledge has been gained using imaging techniques, psychopharmacology, neuroimmunochemistry and so on.

25|$|Galton devoted much of {{the rest}} of his life to {{exploring}} variation in human populations and its implications, at which Darwin had only hinted. In so doing, he established a research program which embraced multiple aspects of human variation, from mental characteristics to height; from facial images to fingerprint patterns. This required inventing novel measures of traits, devising large-scale collection of data using those measures, and in the end, the discovery of new statistical techniques for describing <b>and</b> <b>understanding</b> <b>the</b> data.|$|E

25|$|Gardner {{argues that}} there is a wide range of {{cognitive}} abilities, but that there are only very weak correlations among them. For example, the theory postulates that a child who learns to multiply easily is not necessarily more intelligent than a child who has more difficulty on this task. The child who takes more time to master multiplication may best learn to multiply through a different approach, may excel in a field outside mathematics, or may be looking at <b>and</b> <b>understanding</b> <b>the</b> multiplication process at a fundamentally deeper level.|$|E
25|$|While moneyness is a {{function}} of both spot and strike, usually one of these is fixed, and the other varies. Given a specific option, the strike is fixed, and different spots yield the moneyness of that option at different market prices; this is useful in option pricing <b>and</b> <b>understanding</b> <b>the</b> Black–Scholes formula. Conversely, given market data at a given point in time, the spot is fixed at the current market price, while different options have different strikes, and hence different moneyness; this is useful in constructing an implied volatility surface, or more simply plotting a volatility smile.|$|E
25|$|The {{third and}} most recent wave {{consists}} of Quebecers and other francophones (Haitians, Maghrebans, Europeans, etc.) who {{move to the}} larger cities and often preserve their original identity (Québécois, Haitian, etc.) as their primary cultural affiliation. Franco-Ontarians may also have historical ties {{to more than one}} of these three groups, which blurs the lines between these distinctions. Intermarriage between Franco-Ontarians and people of other ethnic or cultural backgrounds is also quite common. As a result, the complex political and sociological context of Franco-Ontarian can only be fully understood by recognizing both meanings <b>and</b> <b>understanding</b> <b>the</b> distinctions between the two.|$|E
