Both the mainframe and 16 bit mini-computer versions of Promis were developed under LEAA contracts, and in later litigation, both Inslaw and DOJ eventually agreed that the early version of Promis was in the public domain, meaning that neither the Institute nor its successor had exclusive rights to it.|$|E
25|$|ATSDR {{represents}} the Department of Health and Human Services on the National Response Team {{and works with}} other agencies to provide technical assistance during emergencies involving hazardous substances, such as chemical spills.

ATSDR worked with EPA <b>and</b> <b>state</b> <b>and</b> <b>local</b> authorities to provide health information to local residents and advised those agencies during the clean-up process. ATSDR also assists with responding to terrorism incidents, which have included the September 11 attacks and the 2001 anthrax attacks. ATSDR responded to 132 chemical emergency events in 2008.|$|E

25|$|One of ATSDR’s primary {{responsibilities}} {{is conducting}} public health assessments and health consultations. The agency conducts public health assessments for all current or proposed {{sites on the}} National Priorities List (commonly known as Superfund sites). The purpose of public health assessments is to examine whether hazardous substances at a site pose a human health hazard and to issue recommendations about limiting or stopping exposure to those substances. ATSDR also conducts health consultations, often in response to requests from EPA <b>and</b> <b>state</b> <b>and</b> <b>local</b> agencies. Health consultations examine specific health questions, such as {{the health effects of}} exposure to a specific chemical at a site. Health consultations are more limited in scope than public health assessments. ATSDR also conducts public health assessments and health consultations in response to petitions from members of the public. To conduct public health assessments and health consultations, ATSDR relies on its own scientists or establishes cooperative agreements with states, providing technical assistance to state health departments. ATSDR issued more than 200 public health assessments in 2009 and provides about 1,000 health consultations each year.|$|E

Any such deferral required congressional notification before it was authorized.

500|$|The United States has {{the highest}} {{documented}} incarceration rate and total prison population in the world. For the latest data, see National Research Council[...] Washington, DC: The National Academies Press, 2014. Retrieved May 10, 2014.. Human Rights Watch, May 2014. Retrieved May 10, 2014. At the start of 2008, more than 2.3 million people were incarcerated, {{more than one in}} every 100 adults. In December 2012, the combined U.S. adult correctional systems supervised about 6,937,600 offenders. About 1 in every 35 adult residents in the United States was under some form of correctional supervision in December 2012, the lowest rate observed since 1997. The prison population has quadrupled since 1980, <b>and</b> <b>state</b> <b>and</b> <b>local</b> spending on prisons and jails has grown three times as much as that spent on public education during the same period. However, the imprisonment rate for all prisoners sentenced to more than a year in state or federal facilities is 478 per 100,000 in 2013 and the rate for pre-trial/remand prisoners is 153 per 100,000 residents in 2012. The country's high rate of incarceration is largely due to changes in sentencing guidelines and drug policies. According to the Federal Bureau of Prisons, the majority of inmates held in federal prisons are convicted of drug offenses. The privatization of prisons and prison services which began in the 1980s has been a subject of debate.Joe Davidson (August 12, 2016)[...] The Washington Post.
