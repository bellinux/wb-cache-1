40|$|Abstract. This {{study has}} been carried out to {{investigate}} the influence of inclined <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> <b>vee</b> stiffener used on blast wall structure. In order to prevent the structural buckling, the vee stiffeners is employed and placed on the compressive region. A higher peak pressure was applied in order to investigate the buckling phenomena on the corrugated panel with vee stiffener. The inclined <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> <b>vee</b> stiffener was varied from 15 ° to 90 °. The results show that an alteration of inclined angle has a considerable effect on the dynamic response of the blast wall structure, the deformed shape and the effectiveness of the stiffener due to the absorbed plastic strain energy. The best inclined angle of the vee stiffener is also determined...|$|E

40|$|The {{function}} of formation flight in Canada Geese {{and other large}} waterfowl is unknown, although two hypotheses have be en proposed. One hypothesis suggests that formation types are a {{function of}} visual and spatial needs; the other suggests that these birds are able to reduce induced drag by formation flight. Published data propose that if formation flight can reduce drag, energy could be saved on long migrations. In this study, autumnal migrating flocks of Canada Geese (Branta c. canadensis) were filmed at a refuge in upstate New York during early October, 1971. The Super- 8 mm films were analyzed to determine the types of formations utilized, the number of birds per flock, the relationship between wind conditions and flight direction, the <b>angles</b> <b>of</b> <b>Vee</b> and Jay formations, the distance between adjacent birds along the legs <b>of</b> <b>Vee</b> formations, and wing-beat frequencies and phase relationships among the birds in a formation. This study describes a technique to measure the <b>angles</b> <b>of</b> <b>Vee</b> formations, {{by the use of}} three-dimensional descriptive geometry, and is the first study in which formation angles have been measured empirically. The results show formation angles much more acute than previously hypothesized, similar wing-beat frequencies among all birds, variable spacing between adjacent birds, and an apparent preference {{of the majority of the}} flocks for flight with crosswinds, and at low wind speeds. Due to the variable, and generally large, spacing between adjacent birds along the legs of the formations analyzed, it seems doubtful that these formations could be using the Vee for an aerodynamic advantage. Although the flocks filmed in this study may be more representative of daily movements than of migratory flights, it is possible that the primary function of formation flight may be to maintain flock unity, thus aiding in navigation. Further work is proposed which might resolve the question of a possible aerodynamic advantage to formation flight...|$|R

40|$|AbstractWe {{measured}} the discrimination threshold (Δθ) Th for angle θ, where θ was either the <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> a <b>Vee</b> composed <b>of</b> two straight lines {{contained within the}} frontoparallel plane or the <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> intersection of two straight lines contained within the frontoparallel plane. The two-line pattern was rotated bodily through a random angle between trials {{with the aim of}} eliminating the absolute orientation of one or the other line as a reliable cue to the task. We report evidence that this aim was achieved. Our main conclusion is that the ability to discriminate a change in angle θ cannot entirely be explained in terms of the ability to discriminate changes in the orientations of the individual lines that comprise the Vee. We propose that the human visual pathway contains a neural mechanism that encodes the difference in the orientations of two simultaneously-presented straight lines. Discrimination threshold for angle (Δθ) Th is roughly twice orientation discrimination threshold for an isolated line. When subjects cannot use the orientation of one or another line as a cue to the task, the plot of (Δθ) Th vs θ is approximately flat between θ = 20 and 160 deg...|$|R

Repeated {{outbreaks}} of Venezuelan equine encephalitis (VEE) in humans and equines in the Guajira region of Venezuela suggested a sylvatic focus of an epizootic subtype <b>of</b> <b>VEE</b> virus.

Blood specimens were obtained from every third equine, regardless of stated vaccination status, and tested {{for the presence of}} Venezuelan equine encephalitis (VEE), western equine encephalomyelitis (WEE), and eastern equine encephalomyelitis (EEE) neutralization antibodies. Serum samples were collected from 446 equines in the 3 -county area; only 227 (50. 7 percent) had both a history <b>of</b> <b>VEE</b> vaccination in 1971 (including 20 vaccinated in 1972) and serum neutralization antibody against <b>VEE.</b> <b>Of</b> the remaining 220 with no detectable neutralization antibody to VEE, 197 (89. 5 percent) had a history <b>of</b> <b>VEE</b> vaccination in 1971 (including 5 revaccinated in 1972), 14 (6. 4 percent) had no history of vaccination, and 9 (4. 1 percent) had an unknown vaccination status.

40|$|Abstract. The {{enzootic}} or endemic {{strains of}} Venezuelan equine encephalomyelitis (VEE) virus (ID, IE, IF, and II-VI) are considered avirulent. In 1993 and 1996, outbreaks of encephalitis {{occurred in the}} horse populations in the Chiapas and Oaxaca provinces of Mexico, respectively. In both instances, enzootic VEE virus subserotype IE was isolated from brain tissues of dead horses. The present study investigated the pathogenicity of the Chiapas viral isolate (NVSL VEE IE 93 - 42124) in ponies. Three ponies were inoculated intradermally with 4, 5, and 6 logs, respectively, <b>of</b> the NVSL <b>VEE</b> IE 93 - 42124 viral isolate. All ponies showed fluctuations in body temperature, encephalitis, and other signs <b>of</b> infection with <b>VEE</b> virus. Virus was isolated only from the blood of ponies from day 1 to day 3 postinfection. Microscopic examination of hematoxylin and eosin–stained tissue sections showed mild to moderate nonsuppurative encephalitis, perivascular cuffing by mononuclear cells, gliosis, and meningoencephalitis. Antibody (IgM) to VEE virus IE was unable to differentiate between various subserotypes <b>of</b> <b>VEE</b> I viruses (serotypes IAB, IC, ID, and IF). Virus neutralizing antibody titers to heterologous VEE I viruses were 10 – 100 -fold less than those for NVSL VEE IE 93 - 42124 virus and Mena II, a human isolate <b>of</b> <b>VEE</b> IE virus.

40|$|We {{investigated}} {{the specificity of}} the T helper (Th) cell immune r sponse to three alphaviruses: Venezuelan equine encephalomyelitis (VEE), eastern equine en-cephalitis (EEE) and western equine encephalitis (WEE). Single cell suspensions were prepared from spleens of virus-primed C 3 H mice, and T lymphocyte populations were enriched by nylon wool chromatography. T cells were incubated in vitro with irradiated, syngeneic splenic stimulator cells previously exposed to purified virus. Cellular proliferation was measured by [3 H]thymidine uptake 5 days post-stimulation. The predominant proliferating cell type secreted interleukin- 2 and was of the Th cell phenotype Thy-I +, Lyt-l+, 2 -, L 3 T 4 ÷. Stimulation <b>of</b> <b>VEE,</b> EEE and WEE virus-primed Th cells with homologous and heterologous virus resulted primarily in a proliferative response specific for the immunizing virus.

40|$|Abstract The {{number of}} {{publicly}} accessible virtual execution environments (VEEs) {{has been growing}} steadily {{in the past few}} years. To be accessible by clients, such VEEs need either a public IPv 4 or a public IPv 6 address. However, the pool of available public IPv 4 addresses is nearly depleted and the low rate of adoption of IPv 6 precludes its use. Therefore, what is needed is a way to share precious IPv 4 public addresses among a large pool <b>of</b> <b>VEEs.</b> Our insight is that if an IP address is assigned at the time of a client DNS request for the VEE’s name, it is possible to share a single public IP address amongst a set <b>of</b> <b>VEEs</b> whose workloads are not network intensive, such as those hosting personal servers or performing data analytics. We investigate several approaches to multiplexing a pool of global IP addresses among a large number <b>of</b> <b>VEEs,</b> and design a system that overcomes the limitations of current approaches. We perform a qualitative and quantitative comparison of these solutions. We find that upon receiving a DNS request from a client, our solution has a latency as low as 1 ms to allocate a public IP address to a VEE, while keeping the size of the required IP address pool close to the minimum possible...|$|R
