500|$|Robinson {{received}} his degree in 1973 and was ordained a deacon in June 1973 at the cathedral {{of the diocese}} of Newark, New Jersey. [...] He served as curate at Christ Church in Ridgewood, New Jersey, and was ordained a priest six months later. He and his wife remained at the Ridgewood parish for two years until June 1975. They then moved to New Hampshire, where Boo had grown up. Their goal was {{to start a business}} and ministry: in the winter it was called [...] "The Sign of the Dove Retreat Center" [...] and in the summer it became [...] "Pony Farm". [...] Boo still runs [...] "Pony Farm" [...] as a horse camp for children. In 1977, Robinson began working with a committee in the Diocese of New Hampshire to study human sexuality and co-authored a small manual on the subject. Robinson and Boo's first daughter, Jamee, was born in 1977, followed by a second daughter, Ella, in 1981. Robinson treasures his marriage stating, [...] "hat is inextricably tied up with having children. And since I cannot imagine my life without Jamee and Ella, it's just a completely irrelevant question for me. And I don't regret having been married to Boo, either, even if there had not been children. It's just a part of my journey, <b>and</b> <b>why</b> <b>would</b> I possibly regret that?" ...|$|E
2500|$|In a September 2006 {{edition of}} the ABC News program Nightline, Parker {{expressed}} his views on religion, stating that he believes in [...] "a God" [...] and that [...] "there is knowledge that humanity does not yet possess" [...] while cautioning {{that it would take}} a long time to explain exactly what he meant by his belief in God. Parker believes all religions are [...] "silly". He states that [...] "All the religions are superfunny to me… The story of Jesus makes no sense to me. God sent his only son. Why could God only have one son <b>and</b> <b>why</b> <b>would</b> he have to die? It's just bad writing, really. And it's really terrible in about the second act." [...] Parker further remarked, Basically… out of all the ridiculous religion stories which are greatly, wonderfully ridiculous—the silliest one I've ever heard is, 'Yeah… there's this big giant universe and it's expanding, it's all gonna collapse on itself and we're all just here just 'cause… just cause. That, to me, is the most ridiculous explanation ever.|$|E
2500|$|Two days later, Emperor Wenzong {{summoned the}} senior officials, {{including}} {{the heads of}} the various key agencies of the imperial government, to inquire them as to what they opined. [...] A number of advisory officials, including Cui Xuanliang (崔玄亮), Li Guyan, Wang Zhi (王質), Lu Jun (盧均), Shu Yuanbao (舒元褒), Jiang Xi (蔣係), Pei Xiu (裴休), and Wei Wen (韋溫), begged Emperor Wenzong to reopen the discussions with chancellors and move the entire investigations to the proper governmental authorities. [...] Emperor Wenzong told them that he had already discussed with the high level officials and ordered them to withdraw. [...] Cui bowed and wept, stating, [...] "One should be careful even when executing a commoner, and even more care should be paid when killing a chancellor." [...] Emperor Wenzong's anger somewhat subsided, and he summoned the chancellors again. [...] Niu then stated, [...] "The highest that a subject can reach is chancellor, and Song Shenxi is already a chancellor. [...] If the accusations were true, he could still only be chancellor, <b>and</b> <b>why</b> <b>would</b> he pursue that? [...] Surely that was not what he was planning." [...] Meanwhile, Zheng, fearing that the officials would win out and that a second round of investigations would show the truth, suggested to Wang Shoucheng that no executions be carried out, and instead Song should be exiled.|$|E

2500|$|Brooke {{recorded}} in his war diary on 3 October 1941, that a messenger {{had arrived at}} midnight with orders to prepare a plan to attack Trondheim in one week {{and that he was}} to go to Chequers, the prime minister's country house, that evening to discuss the idea over dinner. Accordingly, Brooke together with General Sir John Dill, Chief of the Imperial General Staff, Admiral Sir Dudley Pound, the First Sea Lord and Air Chief Marshal Sir Charles Portal, the Chief of the Air Staff and Clement Attlee, the Lord Privy Seal and Leader of the Labour Party were also in attendance. Brooke recorded that [...] "We sat up til 2.15 pm discussing the problem and I did my best to put the PM off the plan" [...] and that they [...] "Resumed discussion at 11 am and went on till 1 pm, I think PM is beginning to weaken on the plan". Brooke was mistaken and later wrote: [...] "From then on, we would continually be in trouble riding him [...] off mad plans to go back to Norway. Why he wanted to go back and {{what he was going to}} do there, even if he did succeed in capturing Trondheim, we never found out". On 12 October, Brooke was required to present a detailed plan for the Norway invasion, now code named Operation Ajax, which he had compiled with Admiral Sir John Tovey, Air Chief Marshall Sir William Sholto Douglas and General Sir Bernard Paget (who was to command it). Churchill complained that it was not a plan but a [...] "masterly treatise" [...] on the difficulties of the venture. Churchill avoided the main reason (lack of air support) during two hours of interrogation; raising details such as why he forsaw frosts (as stated in the Climate Book) <b>and</b> <b>why</b> <b>would</b> it take 24 hours to go from A to B (because of enemy resistance and removing road blocks). According to one account (but not mentioned by Brooke) Brooke suddenly relented and agreed to mount the expedition on the condition that the navy could take the fleet into Trondheim Fjord in support, but the elderly Pound merely shook his head and ended the discussion. [...] Churchill again asked the Joint Planning Staff to reconsider Ajax without reference to Brooke or Paget, but the JPS, and the Chiefs of Staff, supported Brooke's conclusions, citing the lack of air superiority or any hope of achieving it.|$|E

6000|$|Again the Vicar {{drove to}} the Bald-faced Stag, and again he walked along the road and over the common.

6000|$|Those who {{are much}} admired are, it is held, {{taken by the}} Sidhe, who can use ungoverned feeling for their own ends, so that a father, as an old herb doctor told me once, may give his child into their hands, or a husband his wife. The admired and desired are only safe if one says [...] "God bless them" [...] when one's eyes are upon them.

And people came from all parts to look at her, and maybe there were some that did not say 'God bless her.'" [...] An old man who lives by the sea at Duras has as little doubt that she was taken, [...] "for there are some living yet can {{remember}} her coming to the pattern[FN#3] there beyond, and {{she was said to}} be the handsomest girl in Ireland." [...] She died young because the gods loved her, for the Sidhe are the gods, {{and it may be that}} the old saying, which we forget to understand literally, meant her manner of death in old times. These poor countrymen and countrywomen in their beliefs, and in their emotions, are many years nearer to that old Greek world, that set beauty beside the fountain of things, than are our men of learning. She [...] "had seen too much of the world"; but these old men and women, when they tell of her, blame another and not her, and though they can be hard, they grow gentle as the old men of Troy grew gentle when Helen passed by on the walls.|$|E
6000|$|Do {{not be in}} a hurry, my friends, and {{suppose that}} our Lord meant merely: [...] "Tell John what {{wonderful}} miracles I am working." [...] If He had meant that why would He have put in as the last proof that He was the Christ, that He was preaching the gospel to the poor? What wonderful miracle was there in THAT? No: {{it was as if}} He had said: [...] "Go and tell John that I am the Christ, because I am the great physician, the healer and deliverer of body and soul: one who will and can cure the loathsome diseases, the uselessness, the misery, the ignorance of the poorest and meanest." [...] He has proved Himself the Christ by showing not only His boundless power, but His boundless love and mercy; and THAT, not only to men's souls, but to their bodies also. To prove Himself the Christ by wonderful and astonishing miracles was exactly what He would not do. He refused, when the Scribes and Pharisees came and asked of Him a sign from heaven to prove that He was Christ-- wanting Him, I suppose, to bring some apparition, or fiery comet, or great voice out of the sky, to astonish them with His power; He told them peremptorily that He would give them no such thing: and yet He said that His mighty works did prove Him to be Christ; He pronounced woe against Chorazin and Bethsaida for not believing Him on account of His mighty works: He told the Scribes and Pharisees that they ought to believe on Him merely for His works' sake. <b>And</b> <b>why</b> <b>would</b> they not believe on Him? Just because they could not see that God's power was shown more in healing and delivering sufferers, than in astonishing and destroying. They could not see that God's perfect likeness shone out in Christ--that He was the express image of the Father, just because He went about doing good, and healing all manner of sicknesses and all manner of infirmities among the people. But so it is, my friends! Jesus is the Saviour, the deliverer, the great physician, the healer of soul and body. Not a pang is felt or a tear shed on earth, but He sorrows over it. Not a human being on earth dies young, but He, as I believe, sorrows over it. What it is which prevents Him healing every sickness, soothing every sorrow, wiping away every tear NOW, we cannot tell. But this we can tell, that it is His will that none should perish. This we CAN tell; that He is willing as ever to heal the sick, to cleanse the leper, to cast out devils, to teach the ignorant, to bind up the broken-hearted. This we CAN tell; that He will go on doing so more and more, year by year, and age by age. This we CAN tell, from Scripture, that Christ is stronger than the devil. This we can tell; that Christ, and all good men, the spirits of just men made perfect, the wise and the great in God's sight, who have left us their books, their sayings, their writings, as precious health-giving heirlooms--have been fighting, and are fighting, and will fight to the end against the devil, and sin, and oppression, and misery, and disease, and everything which spoils and darkens the face of God's good earth. And this we CAN tell; that they will conquer at the last, because Christ is stronger than the devil; good is stronger than evil; light is stronger than darkness; God's Spirit, the giver of life, and health, and order, is stronger than all the evil customs, and ignorance, and carelessness, and cruelty, and superstition, which makes miserable the lives and, {{as far as we can}} see, destroys the souls of thousands. Yes, I say, Christ's kingdom is a kingdom of health and deliverance for body and soul; and it will conquer, and it will spread, and it will grow, till the nations of the world have become the kingdoms of God and of His Christ. Christ reigns, and Christ will reign till He has put all His enemies under His feet; and the last of His enemies which shall be destroyed is DEATH. Death is His enemy. He has conquered death by rising from the dead. And the day will come when death will be no more--when sickness and sorrow shall be unknown, and God shall wipe away tears from all eyes. I say it again--never forget it--Christ is King, and His kingdom is a kingdom of health, and life, and deliverance from all evil. It always has been so, from the first time our Lord cured the leper in Galilee; it will be so to the end of the world. And, therefore--to come back to the very place from which I started at the beginning of my sermon--therefore, whenever one of the days of the Lord is at hand, whenever God's kingdom makes a great step forward, this same prophecy in our text is fulfilled in some striking and wonderful way. And I say it is fulfilled now in these days more than it ever has been. Christ is healing the sick, cleansing the leper, giving sight to the blind, raising the dead, and preaching the gospel to the poor, seven times more in these days in which we live than He did when He walked upon earth in Judaea.|$|E
