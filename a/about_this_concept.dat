40|$|International audienceReference {{conditions}} {{are a key}} concept in the European Water Framework Directive (WFD). The WFD stipulates that the ecological status of a given water body shall be assessed by quantifying the deviation from a set of reference conditions that represent the stable state of an ecosystem {{in the absence of}} significant human disturbance. <b>This</b> <b>concept</b> is subject to criticism from several authors, particularly because underlying ecological concepts are weak and the distinction between natural variability and the effects of anthropogenic activities on ecosystem function will become increasingly artificial. In this paper, a sociologist and an aquatic ecologist examine the origin, successes and limits of the reference conditions concept and raise important questions <b>about</b> applying <b>this</b> <b>concept</b> in practice. We argue that <b>this</b> <b>concept</b> fitted specific needs from different institutions and stakeholders which promoted the WFD. Monitoring practices using <b>this</b> <b>concept</b> require some adaptations. Setting goals for restoration based on reference conditions is more problematic. A more adaptive management approach would be wise...|$|R

40|$|There are {{national}} and international expectations that nurses are healthy role models {{but there is a}} lack of clarity <b>about</b> what <b>this</b> <b>concept</b> means. <b>This</b> study used <b>concept</b> analysis methodology to provide theoretical clarity for the concept of nurses as role models in health promoting behaviour. The framework included analysis of literature and qualitative data from six focus groups and one interview. Participants (n= 39) included pre-registration students, nurse lecturers and registered nurses (RNs), working in NHS Trusts across London and South East London. From the findings, being a role model in health promoting behaviour involves being an exemplar, portraying a healthy image (being fit and healthy), and championing health and wellness. Personal attributes of a role model in health promoting behaviour include being: caring, non-judgemental, trustworthy, inspiring and motivating, self-caring, knowledgeable and self-confident, innovative, professional and having a deep sense of self...|$|R
