5|$|Hitler was {{discharged}} from the army on 31 March 1920 and began working full-time for the NSDAP. The party headquarters was in Munich, a hotbed of anti-government German nationalists determined to crush Marxism <b>and</b> <b>undermine</b> the Weimar Republic. In February 1921—already highly effective at speaking to large audiences—he spoke to a crowd of over 6,000. To publicise the meeting, two truckloads of party supporters drove around Munich waving swastika flags and distributing leaflets. Hitler soon gained notoriety for his rowdy polemic speeches against the Treaty of Versailles, rival politicians, and especially against Marxists and Jews.|$|E
5|$|Like most {{strategic}} bombing during World War II, {{the aim of}} the USAAF {{offensive against}} Japan was to destroy the enemy's war industries, kill or disable civilian employees of these industries, <b>and</b> <b>undermine</b> civilian morale. Civilians {{who took part in the}} war effort through such activities as building fortifications and manufacturing munitions and other war materials in factories and workshops were considered combatants in a legal sense and therefore liable to be attacked.|$|E
5|$|The Anglo-American {{immigrants}} {{residing in}} newly-independent Texas overwhelmingly desired immediate annexation by the United States. But, despite his {{strong support for}} Texas independence from Mexico, then-President Andrew Jackson delayed recognizing the new republic until {{the last day of}} his presidency to avoid raising the issue during the 1836 general election. Jackson's political caution was informed by northern concerns that Texas could potentially form several new slave states <b>and</b> <b>undermine</b> the North-South balance in Congress.|$|E
5000|$|Vinokur and van Ryn used {{unemployed}} {{participants and}} some of the participants were reemployed to look at the impact that social support <b>and</b> social <b>undermining</b> can have on a person's mental health during economic hardships. They suggest that although the support <b>and</b> <b>undermining</b> are inversely <b>and</b> strongly correlated they do not form the same factor but constitute empirically distinct constructs. The study looked at the effect of financial strain, social support, <b>and</b> <b>undermining</b> on poor mental health the results found that it was not statistically significant. Social support <b>and</b> social <b>undermining</b> did have significant but the opposite effect on poor mental health. Vinokur and Ryn(1993) [...] found that social support <b>and</b> <b>undermining</b> were shown in longitudinal design even when prior levels of mental health and the contribution of another critical stressful factor. Social support <b>and</b> <b>undermining</b> had a dynamic pattern influence on mental health.|$|R

5|$|By the 16th century Ethiopian works {{began to}} discuss the {{profound}} impact of foreign peoples in their own regional history. The chronicle of Gelawdewos explained the friction between the Ethiopian Orthodox Church and the Catholic missionaries from Spain and Portugal, after {{the arrival of the}} Jesuits in 1555. With the persuasion of Jesuits in his realm, emperor Susenyos I (r. 1607–1632) became the only Ethiopian ruler to convert from Orthodox Christianity to Catholicism, perhaps earlier than the accepted date of 1625, after which his attempts to convert his subjects <b>and</b> <b>undermine</b> the Orthodox church led to internal revolts. In 1593 the Ethiopian monk, historian, and ethnographer Bahrey published a work of ethnography that provided reasoning for the military success of the polytheistic Oromo people who fought against the Ethiopian Empire. Ethiopian histories of this period also included details of foreign Muslims, Jews, Christians (including those from Western Europe), Safavid Iranians, and even figures of the fallen Byzantine Empire.|$|E
5|$|In 1979 President Jimmy Carter pardoned Lolita Lebrón, Irvin Flores, and Rafael Cancel Miranda {{after they}} had served 25 years in prison. Andrés Figueroa Cordero was {{released}} from prison earlier because of a terminal illness. Governor of Puerto Rico Carlos Romero Barceló publicly opposed the pardons granted by Carter, stating that it would encourage terrorism <b>and</b> <b>undermine</b> public safety. Lebrón received a heroine's welcome by her supporters upon her return to her motherland. Lebrón married Sergio Irizarry Rivera and continued to participate in pro-independence activities. The couple had met while she was in prison, when the Nationalist Party ordered him to monitor her health. Their marriage took place eight years {{after they had}} met. They moved into a small house in Loiza. The house possessed few distinctive traits, mostly composed of religious iconography and a large flag of Puerto Rico in the living room.|$|E
5|$|The Queen lavished {{upon her}} {{favourite}} the royal manor of Woodstock {{and the promise}} of a fine palace commemorative of his great victory at Blenheim; but since her accession her relationship with Sarah had become progressively distant. The Duke and Duchess had risen to greatness not least because of their intimacy with Anne, but the Duchess's relentless campaign against the Tories (Sarah was a firm Whig), isolated her from the Queen whose natural inclinations lay with the Tories, the staunch supporters of the Church of England. For her part, Anne, now Queen and no longer the timid adolescent so easily dominated by her more beautiful friend, had grown tired of Sarah's tactless political hectoring and increasingly haughty manner which, in the coming years, were to destroy their friendship <b>and</b> <b>undermine</b> the position of her husband.|$|E
40|$|Our {{aim was to}} {{evaluate}} the amount of tension present after incision <b>and</b> <b>undermining</b> of the anterior rectus sheaths and the external oblique muscles in 20 fresh adult cadavers. Resistance to traction of the anterior and posterior rectus sheaths towards the midline was measured at three stages of dissection: before any aponeurotic undermining; after incision <b>and</b> <b>undermining</b> of the anterior rectus sheaths; and after incision <b>and</b> <b>undermining</b> of the external oblique muscles associated with the previous dissection. Significance of differences was assessed using non-parametric tests. There was {{a significant reduction in}} tension in the anterior and posterior sheaths on both levels after each stage of dissection. the incision <b>and</b> <b>undermining</b> of the anterior rectus sheaths and the external oblique muscles promoted a progressive reduction in tension at the aponeurotic edges of the abdominal wall.

5|$|Lemur {{research}} {{during the}} 18th and 19th centuries focused on taxonomy and specimen collection. Although field observations trickled in from early explorers, modern studies of lemur ecology and behavior {{did not begin}} in earnest until the 1950s and 1960s. Initially hindered by political instability and turmoil on Madagascar during the mid-1970s, field studies resumed in the 1980s and have greatly increased the understanding of these primates. Research facilities like the Duke Lemur Center have provided research opportunities under more controlled settings. Lemurs are important for research because their mix of ancestral characteristics and traits shared with anthropoid primates can yield insights on primate and human evolution. However, many lemur species are threatened with extinction due to habitat loss and hunting. Although local traditions generally help protect lemurs and their forests, illegal logging, widespread poverty, and political instability hinder <b>and</b> <b>undermine</b> conservation efforts. Because of these threats and their declining numbers, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) considers lemurs to be the world's most endangered mammals, noting that—as of 2013—up to 90% of all lemur species face extinction within the next 20 to 25years.|$|E
5|$|Over time, {{the economists}} in the Eisenhower {{administration}} became frustrated with Diem's refusal to devaluate the piaster once the Republic of Vietnam {{had become a}} stable nation. Diem refused to make the CIP exchange rate equivalent to the free market exchange rate for the two currencies. Although the fixed exchange rate meant that Americans were heavily funding the South Vietnamese economy and that the importing firms could obtain more goods for their money, the rate also meant that South Vietnam goods would not be economically competitive on the export market. Diem was reluctant to cut the currency rate, arguing that it would diminish the value of US aid to South Vietnam <b>and</b> <b>undermine</b> the urban middle class support for his regime as they would resent {{the loss of their}} cheap consumer and luxury goods. In 1963, the US Ambassador Frederick Nolting and his economic advisers exhorted Diem to spend more of the CIP funds on rural development in an attempt to shore up peasant support in the face of increasing communist pressure, but were rebuffed.|$|E
5|$|Professing {{to be of}} Irish ancestry and a {{supporter}} of Irish independence from Great Britain, Crowley began to espouse support for Germany in their war against Britain. He became involved in New York's pro-German movement, and in January 1915 German spy George Sylvester Viereck employed him as a writer for his propagandist paper, The Fatherland, which was dedicated to keeping the US neutral in the conflict. In later years, detractors denounced Crowley as a traitor to Britain for this action. In reality, Crowley was a double agent, working for the British intelligence services to infiltrate <b>and</b> <b>undermine</b> Germany's operation in New York. Many of his articles in The Fatherland were hyperbolic, for instance comparing Kaiser Wilhelm II to Jesus Christ; in July 1915 he orchestrated a publicity stunt– reported on by The New York Times– in which he declared independence for Ireland {{in front of the}} Statue of Liberty; the real intention was to make the German lobby appear ridiculous {{in the eyes of the}} American public. It has been argued that he encouraged the German Navy to destroy the Lusitania, informing them that it would ensure the US stayed out of the war, while in reality hoping that it would bring the US into the war on Britain's side.|$|E

5|$|The {{operation}} {{never took}} place. Instead, the fighter force {{was committed to}} the disastrous Operation Bodenplatte, designed to support German forces during the Battle of the Bulge. Galland's influence on matters was now virtually nil. Appalled by the Ardennes losses, he personally confronted Gollob and criticised him severely. Gollob contacted the Reichsführer-SS Heinrich Himmler. Himmler's reputation {{as the most powerful}} man after Hitler at that time may have been a prime motive. Gollob complained about his misuse in the Luftwaffe and Galland's leadership. The SS had already spread their influence into other areas of military affairs including the V-2 operations. Himmler, whose relationship with Göring was poor, took the opportunity to exploit the dissent in the Luftwaffe <b>and</b> <b>undermine</b> the Reichsmarschall by supporting Gollob. It was also an opportunity for the SS to seize control of the Luftwaffe and for Himmler to oust Göring from power. Göring, for his part offered no support to Galland when Himmler or the SS were mentioned. On 13 January 1945, Galland was finally relieved of his command.|$|E
5|$|The {{right to}} be identified, known as the right of paternity, applies to the creators of {{original}} literary, dramatic, musical or artistic works; for films, the {{right to be}} identified is granted to the director rather than the writer. Some specific types of work are not protected by this right, particularly those made to report current events, periodicals, newspapers or encyclopaedias. These exceptions were included as a result of lobbying by the publishing industry, and the fear that the need to name the author of a current events report could interfere with its speedy delivery, <b>and</b> <b>undermine</b> the image of the news as objective and neutral. Under Section 79, {{the right to be}} identified also does not apply to authors of computer programs, computer-generated works, typefaces or works protected by crown copyright. On those works which are covered by this moral right, {{there is a need to}} assert it; this may be done through an instrument assigning copyright, or any other instrument written by the author or director. If the asserting is done through a document designed to assign copyright, it binds the assignee and anyone who claims through him, with or without notice; if it is done through another instrument, it only applies to those who are directly informed of the assertion.|$|E
5|$|With {{the failure}} of the Spanish match, Charles and Buckingham turned their {{attention}} to France. On 1 May 1625 Charles was married by proxy to the fifteen-year-old French princess Henrietta Maria in front of the doors of the Notre Dame de Paris. Charles had seen Henrietta Maria in Paris while en route to Spain. The couple married in person on 13 June 1625 in Canterbury. Charles delayed the opening of his first Parliament until after the second ceremony, to forestall any opposition. Many members of the Commons were opposed to the king's marriage to a Roman Catholic, fearing that Charles would lift restrictions on Catholic recusants <b>and</b> <b>undermine</b> the official establishment of the reformed Church of England. Although he told Parliament that he would not relax religious restrictions, he promised to do exactly that in a secret marriage treaty with his brother-in-law Louis XIII of France. Moreover, the treaty loaned to the French seven English naval ships that would be used to suppress the Protestant Huguenots at La Rochelle in September 1625. Charles was crowned on 2 February 1626 at Westminster Abbey, but without his wife at his side because she refused to participate in a Protestant religious ceremony.|$|E
