25|$|In his old age Yan {{also found}} {{time to work on}} a {{dictionary}} and related literary projects. In his 26 chapter book Yanshi jiaxun 顏氏家訓 ("The Family Instructions of Master Yan") Yan Zhitui left an entire written compendium of his own philosophy and life-advice to his sons, advising them on which paths to take and which paths to avoid in order to gain success in life. In addition, he also made observations <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>differences</b> <b>between</b> Northern and Southern China of his time, especially in regards to language, customs, and culture. He wrote that he formed many bad habits in life that took years to overcome because his elder brother had not been strict enough with him in the absence of their father. He stressed the need to acquire a good education, since well-educated ministers were chosen for posts, while others who had prestigious family lines for centuries wound up working on farms or tending to horses in the stable if they were not properly educated. Although he stressed the need for mastering calligraphy, painting, and playing the musical instrument of the lute (guqin), he warned against them from practicing too much and gaining too much skill. This was because those of higher rank, in a degrading and humiliating fashion, could easily call upon them to constantly entertain and produce fanciful calligraphy, poetry, or a musical song on the spot. Yan Zhitui was an antiquarian {{when it came to the}} prized calligraphy in his family's collection, with written pieces in his possession that were originally penned by the masters of early calligraphy, Wang Xizhi and his son Wang Xianzhi.|$|E

Wiseau, confused <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>differences</b> <b>between</b> 35 mm film and high-definition video, decided to shoot the entire film in both formats simultaneously, using a custom-built apparatus that housed both cameras side-by-side and required two crews to operate. Commenting on his decision to shoot the film in this way, Wiseau said {{that he wanted to}} be able to say that he was the first director to film an entire movie simultaneously in two formats, although ultimately only the 35mm footage was used in the final edit.|$|E
500|$|But his {{philological}} concerns {{now were}} {{only a small part}} of a much larger project to make sense of the nature of the Greek culture itself. His work in this period shows a theoretical sophistication far beyond his earlier efforts, extending his theory of literacy toward a theory of culture itself. He said of the Dipylon inscription, a poetic line scratched into a vase and the earliest Greek writing known at the time, [...] "Here in this casual act by an unknown hand there is announced a revolution which was destined to change the nature of human culture." [...] It is this larger point <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>differences</b> <b>between</b> oral and literate culture that represents Havelock's most influential contribution. Walter J. Ong, for example, in assessing the significance of non-oral communication in an oral culture, cites Havelock's observation that scientific categories, which are necessary not only for the natural sciences but also for historical and philosophical analysis, depend on writing. These ideas were sketched out in Preface to Plato but became central to Havelock's work from Prologue to Greek Literacy (1971) onward.|$|E

Mayorga recorded drums for all but two tracks on the album, Godsmack drummer Shannon Larkin performed on the track [...] "30/30-150" [...] and guitarist Root performed drums on the bonus track [...] "The Day I Let Go".

Wimberly later contacted Beyoncé's management, and Polachek and himself were later invited to a studio in Manhattan to work on Beyoncé self-titled fifth studio album.

Polachek further elaborated <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>differences</b> <b>between</b> her version of [...] "No Angel" [...] and Beyoncé's rendition, saying, [...] "Her groove was different—my vocals were jumpier, and hers were more like panting.

It was a very completed package in my mind. I {{felt like it was}} there. I felt more comfortable with it. With this, it was a bit more organic. It was based on an old folk tale. We kept kind of changing it but, you know, I had a great co-director with Mike Johnson. I feel like we complemented each other quite well. It was just a different movie, a different process." [...] He also spoke about casting Johnny Depp as Victor, saying: [...] "It was weird because we were doing both at the same time. He was Willy Wonka by day and Victor by night so {{it might have been a}} little schizophrenic for him. But he’s great. It's the first animated movie he's done and he's always into a challenge. We just treat it like fun and a creative process. Again, that’s the joy of working with him. He's kind of up for anything. He just always adds something to it. The amazing thing is all the actors never worked [...] They were never in a room together, so they were all doing their voices, except for Albert [...] and Joanna [...] did a few scenes together, everybody else was separate. They were all kind of working in a vacuum, which was interesting. That’s the thing that I felt ended up so beautifully, that their performances really meshed together. So he was very canny, as they all were, about trying to find the right tone and making it work while not being in the same room with each other." ...|$|E
500|$|Safran {{called the}} second season more cohesive, {{mirroring}} the first season and [...] "... keep the two-storyline structure". In an interview, he confirmed that the structure would be [...] "a little bit of flash-forward, but the majority will be what I like to call the present". According to Safran, the producers aimed at a more-mature, darker second season which would be [...] "less confusing" [...] to viewers. Safran had plotted an upcoming plot point as the first season ended, which saw Alex clearing her name, getting fired by the FBI and receiving a job offer by the CIA director. He revealed that the season-two storyline would focus on the contrasting work ethics of the FBI and the CIA. Safran elaborated <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>differences</b> <b>between</b> the FBI and CIA, saying: [...] "We're {{very interested in the}} fact that the FBI's so much about being honest, truthful and living up to your badge. And the CIA is the opposite. You succeed if you can deceive. So it's going to be interesting to see. It's like a funhouse mirror of what we've seen". He announced that the series would switch to a single timeline after the fourteenth episode. Safran said that {{the second season}} always intended to adopt a single timeline after the resolved storyline and the aftermath of the hostage crisis, adding [...] "When we broke Season 2, we knew we were going to go to one timeline, because it’s about the [...] event, and then it’s about what happens after the event. And you can’t flashback to the Farm after the crisis is over". He said that the change was also due to viewer complaints that the first season's dual timeline was confusing.|$|E
