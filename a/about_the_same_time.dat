5|$|The text, states Mircea Eliade, was {{possibly}} composed {{in the same}} period as the didactic parts of the Mahabharata, the chief Sannyasa Upanishads and along with other early Yoga Upanishads: Brahmabindu (probably composed <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>time</b> as Maitri Upanishad), Ksurika, Tejobindu, Brahmavidya, Nadabindu, Yogashikha, Dhyanabindu, and Amritabindu.|$|E

5|$|A {{few years}} after {{starting}} work on the canal, the Member had an artificial lake built on a flat piece of land {{to the front of}} the mansion house. The landscape gardener William S Gilpin was carrying out work on the adjacent Strichen estate at <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>time,</b> and it is assumed he gave help with the work at Pitfour. The lake extends to almost 50 acres and was based on the artificial lake at Windsor Great Park.|$|E
50|$|The 384 BW {{accomplished}} a truly remarkable feat by being certified combat ready just {{nine months after}} receiving its first aircraft. Stringent SAC requirements called for a specified percentage of the crews to be certified {{in order for the}} wing to be considered combat ready. Since aircrew members were fresh out of student status, beginning to arrive <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>times</b> <b>the</b> aircraft did, preparing the group to become fully combat ready was a tremendous task. The culture of the organization would accept nothing less than full effort, and when the newly formed wing was mission capable by September 1956, it became the first such SAC wing to do so in such a short time.|$|R
50|$|Although {{another attempt}} was made to revive the Union Nationale in 1998, it failed when the party failed to {{nominate}} enough candidates to be registered.

5|$|A revival can be {{identified}} by {{the dedication of the}} first new monument in a century and a half, raised by the otherwise unknown king, K'awiil Yopaat, in 653. Continued contact with Copán is evident, as well as longer distance contacts, possibly with Caracol in Belize.

5|$|After 1940 {{the lower}} aft six-inch guns were removed and the casemates plated over.

5|$|After the war the Manchester Fire Brigade {{was again}} municipalised, and reorganised.

At <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>time,</b> the ambulance station closed and was converted into the fire brigade's workshops. The control room was modernised in 1952, becoming the first in the country with equipment to record emergency calls.|$|E
40|$|Evidence from North Atlantic {{deep sea}} cores reveals that abrupt shifts punctuated what is {{conventionally}} {{thought to have}} been a relatively stable Holocene climate. During each of these episodes, cool, ice-bearing waters from north of Iceland were advected as far south as the latitude of Britain. At <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>times,</b> <b>the</b> atmospheric circulation above Greenland changed abruptly. Pacings of the Holocene events and of abrupt climate shifts during the last glaciation are statistically the same; together, they make up a series of climate shifts with a cyclicity close to 1470 +/- 500 years. The Holocene events, therefore, appear to be the most recent manifestation of a pervasive millennial-scale climate cycle operating independently of the glacial-interglacial climate state. Amplification of the cycle during the last glaciation may have been linked to the North Atlantic's thermohaline circulation...|$|R

25|$|The {{algorithm}} requires O(m) memory. It {{is possible}} to use less memory by choosing a smaller m in {{the first step of}} the algorithm. Doing so increases the running time, which then is O(n/m).

40|$|We {{review the}} {{relative}} motion of India and Asia {{for the last}} 100 million years and present a revised reconstruction for the India-Antarctica-Africa-North America-Eurasia plate circuit based on published motion histories. Deformation of these continental masses during this time introduces uncertainties, as does error in oceanic isochron age and location. Neglecting these factors, the data ipso facto allow the inference that the motion of India relative to Eurasia was distinctly episodic. Although motion {{is likely to have}} varied more smoothly than these results would allow, the geological record also suggests a sequence of distinct episodes, at <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>times.</b> Hence we suggest that no single event should be regarded as the collision of India with Asia. The deceleration of the Indian plate commencing at ~ 65. Ma is matched by an equally significant prior acceleration and this aspect {{must be taken into account}} in geodynamic scenarios proposed to explain the collision of India with Asia...|$|R
5|$|Around midday the Germans {{opened up}} an {{artillery}} and mortar barrage that caused casualties among the ridge's defenders and lasted {{for the entire}} afternoon.

The advance of the Byzantine Emperor Andronikos III Palaiologos against Bulgaria in the summer of 1332 protracted military operations against the rebels. The Byzantines overran Bulgarian-controlled northeastern Thrace, but Ivan Alexander rushed southward with a small army and swiftly caught up with Andronikos III at Rusokastro.|$|E
