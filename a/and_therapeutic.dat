40|$|Abstract: Present {{study was}} carried out to {{evaluate}} hepatotoxicity of nimesulide by single dose and seven days administration in sub <b>therapeutic,</b> <b>therapeutic</b> <b>and</b> supra <b>therapeutic</b> doses in litters of rat. Single dose and seven days administration hepatotoxicity studies of nimesulide were carried out in litters of rat of either sex. They were further subdivided into sub therapeutic (20 mg/kg), <b>therapeutic</b> (30 mg/kg) <b>and</b> supra <b>therapeutic</b> (100 mg/kg) groups. Effect of nimesulide on liver functions were analysed by serum glutamate oxaloacetate transaminase (SGOT), serum glutamate pyruvate transaminase (SGPT), alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and histopathological examination of liver through scoring system. Histopathological changes in liver were observed in <b>therapeutic</b> <b>and</b> supra <b>therapeutic</b> doses in single dose groups <b>and</b> sub <b>therapeutic,</b> <b>therapeutic</b> <b>and</b> supra <b>therapeutic</b> doses in seven days groups. In single dose of nimesulide in litters, there were significant increases in biochemical parameters (p< 0. 05) in supratherapeutic doses. However, in seven days studies of nimesulide in litters, there were significant increases in biochemical parameters (p< 0. 05) in <b>therapeutic</b> <b>and</b> supratherapeutic doses. The present study indicates that nimesulide causes significant hepatotoxicity in litters of rat...|$|R

5|$|Antibody mimetics are organic {{compounds}} that, like antibodies, can specifically bind antigens. They are usually artificial peptides or proteins with a molar mass of about 3 to 20 kDa. Nucleic acids and small molecules are sometimes considered antibody mimetics, but not artificial antibodies, antibody fragments and fusion proteins are composed from these. Common advantages over antibodies are better solubility, tissue penetration, stability towards heat and enzymes, and comparatively low production costs. Antibody mimetics {{such as the}} Affimer and the DARPin have being developed and commercialised as research, diagnostic <b>and</b> <b>therapeutic</b> agents.|$|E

5|$|People of {{all ages}} with {{physical}} and mental disabilities obtain beneficial results from association with horses. Therapeutic riding is used to mentally and physically stimulate disabled persons and help them improve their lives through improved balance and coordination, increased self-confidence, and a greater feeling of freedom and independence. The benefits of equestrian activity {{for people with disabilities}} has also been recognized with the addition of equestrian events to the Paralympic Games and recognition of para-equestrian events by the International Federation for Equestrian Sports (FEI). Hippotherapy <b>and</b> <b>therapeutic</b> horseback riding are names for different physical, occupational, and speech therapy treatment strategies that utilize equine movement. In hippotherapy, a therapist uses the horse's movement to improve their patient's cognitive, coordination, balance, and fine motor skills, whereas therapeutic horseback riding uses specific riding skills.|$|E
5|$|The Morgan breed {{is known}} for its versatility, and is used for a number of English and Western events. They have been {{successfully}} shown in many disciplines, including dressage, show jumping, Western pleasure, cutting and endurance riding. They are also used as stock horses and for pleasure riding and driving. They are frequently seen in driving competitions, including combined driving and carriage driving. Morgans were the first American breed to compete in the World Pairs Driving competition, representing the US. They can be seen as mounts for 4-H and Pony Club participants <b>and</b> <b>therapeutic</b> riding programs, due to their gentle disposition and steady movement.|$|E
5|$|The well-studied CAS {{proteins}} BCAR1 and NEDD9 {{have important}} roles in cancer and other pathological conditions, which have been addressed in many studies and reviews. EFS has attracted less study. However, the conserved functional properties of EFS relevant to cellular adhesion and migration, and RTK signaling, suggest changes in activity of this protein may also be relevant to cancer and other disease states, influencing prognosis <b>and</b> <b>therapeutic</b> response. The changes in EFS expression and post-translational modification {{in the context of}} disease discussed below are summarized in Table 2.|$|E
