5|$|In {{addition}} to historical evidence, the coins' use of Ge'ez provides valuable linguistic information.

Upon succession as Holy Roman Emperor, Matthias re-affirmed Kepler's position (and salary) as imperial mathematician but allowed him to move to Linz.|$|E
40|$|This {{bachelor}} thesis {{focuses on}} prereading <b>and</b> <b>early</b> literacy {{in children with}} hearing impairments. There are two parts, firstly a theortical part and secondly a practical part. The theoretical part provides definitions of literacy and looks at different approaches by various authors. This generally focuses on reading literacy, prereading <b>and</b> <b>early</b> literacy, <b>and</b> issues of children's reading. Next are outlined factors affecting prereading <b>and</b> <b>early</b> literacy, <b>and</b> <b>early</b> reading skills in children with hearing disabilities. The following chapter examines literacy and how {{it relates to the}} Curriculum Framework for Preschool Education. The Final section of the theoretical part is devoted to testing prereading <b>and</b> <b>early</b> literacy in both the Czech Republic and the international environment, not only for pupils with hearing disabilities, but also hearing pupils. The practical part is devoted to investigating research into prereading <b>and</b> the <b>early</b> literacy of children with hearing impairment in nursery schools for the deaf in the Czech Republic; focusing on their final year before entering elementary school.
