5|$|The Vietnam War (1955–1975) was <b>an</b> <b>important</b> <b>issue</b> {{on college}} campuses across the United States in the 1960s and 1970s. As a belated {{response}} to Vietnam War protesters who believed that funding from the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) made the university part of the military–industrial complex, the Stanford Research Institute split from Stanford University in 1970. The organization subsequently changed {{its name from the}} Stanford Research Institute to SRI International in 1977.|$|E
5|$|The {{overwhelming}} majority of electricity produced worldwide is used immediately, since storage is usually more expensive and because traditional generators can adapt to demand. However both solar power and wind power are variable renewable energy, meaning that all available output must be taken whenever it is available by moving through transmission lines to {{where it can be}} used now. Since solar energy is not available at night, storing its energy is potentially <b>an</b> <b>important</b> <b>issue</b> particularly in off-grid and for future 100% renewable energy scenarios to have continuous electricity availability.|$|E
5|$|Immigration became <b>an</b> <b>important</b> <b>issue</b> for the Vlaams Blok {{from the}} late 1980s. Interconnected with the Flemish {{nationalism}} issue, immigrants {{were considered to be}} a threat to the Flemish ethnic community. In 1992, the party established its 70-point plan, which included measures to stop all immigration, return most immigrants to their native countries by force, and legally discriminate against residing migrants in respect of markets such as labour, housing and education. The party's opponents particularly saw its immigration program as a source of claims of racism, and the party thus in its latest years downplayed the relevance of the 70-point plan, and softened its written positions regarding immigration.|$|E

5|$|Monastic reform became <b>an</b> <b>important</b> <b>issue</b> {{during the}} 11th century, as elites {{began to worry}} that monks were not {{adhering}} to the rules binding them to a strictly religious life. Cluny Abbey, founded in the Mâcon region of France in 909, was established {{as part of the}} Cluniac Reforms, a larger movement of monastic reform in response to this fear. Cluny quickly established a reputation for austerity and rigour. It sought to maintain a high quality of spiritual life by placing itself under the protection of the papacy and by electing its own abbot without interference from laymen, thus maintaining economic and political independence from local lords.|$|E
5|$|Up to 60,000 Italian {{volunteers were}} now {{operating}} in Spain, and {{the removal of}} foreign nationals was discussed by the Non-Intervention Committee. Italy had made a declaration that it would stop Italian volunteers from fighting in Spain on 7 January 1937, and put a moratorium on volunteers on 20 January, also agreeing to support limitations on the number of volunteers on the 25th. Italy continued to request that belligerent rights be given to the Nationalists and Republicans, so both would gain the right to search vessels for contraband, thus removing the need for naval patrols. This request was opposed by the United Kingdom, France and the Soviet Union. British recognition of Italian sovereignty over Abyssinia following the Second Italo-Abyssinian War was <b>an</b> <b>important</b> <b>issue</b> during Anglo-Italian discussions in August 1937. Following Eden's disagreement with Chamberlain and Lord Halifax, Leader of the House of Lords and influential politician, over the issue, any agreement recognising Italian sovereignty was postponed until after the planned shipping conference had taken place.|$|E
5|$|West Gate {{continued}} {{to be used as}} the city gaol, resulting in it surviving the destruction of the other city gates. When the reformer John Howard visited the gaol in the mid-1770s, he noted that it contained a large day room for male and female prisoners and two small night rooms, but no courtyard for exercise. Prison reform became <b>an</b> <b>important</b> <b>issue</b> during the early 19th century, and the West Gate gaol was considered unsatisfactory, being condemned as dirty, cramped and insecure, resulting in the extension of the gaol into Pound Lane and the consequent dismantling of the adjacent city wall. There was a legal attempt to demolish the West Gate altogether in 1859, in order to allow the Wombwell Circus to march a parade of elephants into the city; the gatehouse was only saved by the casting vote of Canterbury's mayor. In 1865 the prison was closed and the West Gate became used first for the storage of archives and then as a museum.|$|E
