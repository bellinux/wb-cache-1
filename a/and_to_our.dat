500|$|The film {{adaptation}} of Miracle at St. Anna {{attracted the attention}} of Italian producers Roberto Cicutto and Luigi Musini, the co-founders of On My Own Produzioni Cinematografiche. Cicutto explained that they knew that Lee was [...] "not just coming to Italy to make a film as an American director, but to make a film that belongs to his culture <b>and</b> <b>to</b> <b>our</b> history." [...] The film's budget was an estimated $45 million. Under their Own My Own production banner, Cicutto and Musini contributed $8.74 million. Lee's reputation as an acclaimed filmmaker in Europe, where he served as a jury member of the 2004 Venice Film Festival, also helped the filmmakers obtain two-thirds of the budget from Italy's RAI Cinema and France's TF1 ($30 million). Touchstone Pictures provided the remainder ($6.26 million), and later released the film in North America.|$|E

A beautiful job with dark black leather upholstery <b>and,</b> <b>to</b> <b>our</b> delight, a well-stocked bar." [...] When they were back in LA, they were invited to visit the house of Michelle and John Phillips, from the Mamas & the Papas. Brian Wilson was also there, as he was working on the Beach Boys Smile album. Evans wrote about singing [...] "On Top of Old Smokey" [...] with McCartney and Wilson, but was not impressed by Wilson's avant-garde attitude to music: [...] "Brian [...] then put a damper on the spontaneity of the whole affair by walking in with a tray of water-filled glasses, trying to arrange it into some sort of session." ...|$|E

[...] Rabbi Nehemiah taught that God did not punish the Israelite community for secret transgressions at any time, and God did not punish the Israelite community as a whole for open transgressions until they had crossed the Jordan.|$|E
