40|$|Assessing fiscal {{sustainability}} – i. e. considering {{whether or not}} a country can maintain its current fiscal policies without running into solvency pro 3 blems and possible default – requires projections on a government’s future revenue stream, expenditures and contingent liabilities within a macroeconomic framework. Such an exercise is always subject to uncertainty. In commodity-rich countries dependent upon resource revenues, this is intensified by unpredictable and volatile commodity prices. The paper applies a framework for {{fiscal sustainability}} and managing uncertainty to Congo. Congo is rapidly building up its production and export capacity and can expect to be a substantial energy producer for several decades to come. Its major challenge is how to manage the hump shaped nature of its oil windfall and how to ensure fiscal sustainability when the oil windfall is gone. The paper analyzes explicitly the effects of uncertainty through stochastic analysis allowing for Value-at-Risk assessments. Furthermore, using an <b>active</b> <b>debt</b> feedback rule, the paper provides an example of how fiscal policy can be used to actively manage debt, in this particular case to reduce its volatility. Such a fiscal policy rule, leading to tightening fiscal policy whenever negative debt shocks occur, can greatly reduce the variance of future debt outcomes and thereby lower the riskiness of the economic environment in Congo without on average increasing the expected burden of fiscal policy...|$|E

40|$|The {{issue of}} {{implementation}} of the areas of fiscal consolidation is particularly relevant {{in terms of the}} accumulation of public deficits and public debt in such amounts when the country {{is on the verge of}} insolvency. A clear policy to gradually reduce these deficits is necessary, since the budget deficit and quasi-fiscal deficits are rapidly increasing. This will help stabilizing public debt dynamics, and facilitating resolving the shortterm financial difficulties. The situation in Ukraine is complicated by the very low possibility to eliminate external shocks, since foreign exchange reserves and financial reserves are at their minimum, and continuing to show a downward trend. In addition, Ukraine’s economy is experiencing a phase of economic recession. Although the causes of these adverse events are complex and represent a number of external and internal factors, a path to immediate macroeconomic stabilization in Ukraine is possible. Reducing these macroeconomic imbalances should be the main task for the government in the near future, because otherwise there is no real opportunity to achieve sustainable economic growth. Further structural fiscal reforms in public spending are mandatory to maintain macroeconomic stability and economic development in the medium term. Fiscal consolidation will reduce external imbalances, help restoring fiscal space lost due to the crisis, and reduce the financial needs of the state budget and premium for sovereign risk. There are good reasons to conduct fiscal consolidation measures largely by public spending because their level relative to GDP is very high. Furthermore, it is the running costs should be subject to consolidation as capital expenditures have been already reduced to historically low levels. It is proven that there are very limited opportunities for consolidation on the basis of public revenues, because the concentration of GDP in the budget is already high and it would be difficult to raise revenues substantially without compromising growth prospects. The possibility of using the mechanisms fiscal consolidation in Ukraine and foreign countries, their characteristics and problems are defined. In this respect, special attention is paid to the nature of fiscal consolidation and its types, characteristics of fiscal consolidation measures in a crisis, measures of <b>active</b> <b>debt</b> policy as part of financial stability and opportunities to stabilize Ukraine’s public finances in the medium term...|$|E

40|$|Includes bibliographyIn {{the first}} quarter of 2007, Latin American spreads {{tightened}} to new lows and equity prices climbed further, despite a brief bout of market turbulence in late-February and early-March. The good macroeconomic performance of the countries of the region contributed to these favorable developments, but the high level of liquidity in global markets, as well as elevated risk tolerance among market participants, also played a very important role. The negative shift in market sentiment in late-February and early-March was triggered by steep declines in global equity markets - which came after an almost 9 % drop in the Shanghai market on February 27, its biggest fall in a decade - as well as by concerns about the U. S. mortgage market and its potential impact on the U. S. economy. Although brief, the bout of market turbulence lifted implied volatilities in most markets. Global equity markets quickly recovered, and Latin American stocks continued their winning streak, surging in the quarter. The Morgan Stanley Capital International (MSCI) Latin American Price Index gained 5. 6 % in dollar terms in {{the first quarter}}, following a gain of 21. 1 % {{in the fourth quarter of}} 2006. For the first five months of the year, Latin America's MSCI gained 22. 1 %. The quick recovery of Latin American asset prices after the sell-off indicated that market confidence on the region was not easily displaced, even by sharp fluctuations in asset prices. As a result of the search for yield in face of ample global liquidity and improving fundamentals, Latin American bond spreads continued to tighten to record low levels in the first quarter, despite widening briefly during the sell-off of late-February and early-March. According to JPMorgan, the EMBI+ Latin component tightened 11 basis points in the first quarter and 18 basis points in the first five months of year. Compared to U. S. corporate spreads, Latin American spreads of similar credit rating continued to trade at tighter levels. As long as returns remain attractive relative to alternatives such as the U. S. high yield, the region will continue to be an important destination for capital flows, with inflows moving to corporate and local currency debt, as well as stocks.

Emerging and Latin American markets continued to be supported by <b>active</b> <b>debt</b> management {{in the first quarter of}} 2006, as countries continued to take advantage of the favorable external environment. Brazil, Colombia and Venezuela announced buybacks during the quarter, with up to US$ 25 billion of bonds to be retired from the market. A large part of the buybacks concentrated on Brady bonds (US$ 6. 6 billion for Brazil and US$ 3. 9 billion for Venezuela). In the first quarter of 2006, new Latin American debt issuance amounted to US$ 15 billion, its highest level since the first quarter of 2000. Capital inflows remained strong during the quarter, and interest in local markets continued to grow. In the near future, Latin America's external debt should be supported by strong demand and by a diminishing supply of foreign currency-denominated bonds resulting from the region's low financing needs for the rest of the year, and its increasing focus on local currency issuance. Investors' interest in emerging markets assets has been a result of their perception that emerging market countries' fundamentals are strong. Improvements in emerging markets' external positions in recent years, as well as solid fiscal and monetary policies, are credited to have increased resilience to shocks. However, improvement in fundamentals alone cannot fully explain why investor demand for emerging markets assets has been so intense. Risk appetite seems to be as important as fundamentals in explaining investors' enthusiasm, and it has helped to drive spreads to their current low levels. In the first quarter of 2006, global liquidity contributed not only to lower emerging market spreads, but also to lower high-yield spreads. While in the second half of 2005 the correlation between emerging and high-yield spreads turned negative, it turned positive again in early 2006 (0. 8), as global conditions benefited both asset classes. This past May brought a hearty dose of volatility to financial markets. Uncertainty towards the global economic outlook amid rising interest rates prompted investors to abandon riskier markets around the world, and stocks in emerging markets plummeted as a result. The turbulence of the past few weeks was a wake-up call, showing that emerging markets could yet be derailed despite the improvements in local markets, the diversification of investment and the use of new instruments such as credit default swaps, which have helped to transfer and spread risk. Whether increased volatility may be an inflection point in emerging markets remains to be seen, however. It will be a test of the notion that things are different this time around for this traditionally volatile asset class...|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{consists of}} three essays on corporate finance. In the first chapter, I investigate how a liquidity cost associated with debt- `debt servicing cost' affects a firm's capital structure policy. In contrast to the standard capital structure theory prediction that builds on a trade-off between interest tax shields and expected bankruptcy costs, public firms use debt quite conservatively. To address this well known debt conservatism puzzle (Graham 2000), I argue that servicing debt drains valuable liquidity for a financially constrained firm and hence endogenously creates `debt servicing costs,' which have received little attention in the literature. To examine the influence of debt servicing costs on capital structure choices, I develop and estimate a dynamic corporate finance model with interest tax shields, liquidity management, investment, external {{debt and equity financing}} costs, and capital adjustment costs. By using the marginal value of liquidity as a natural measure of the debt servicing costs, I find that (1) an increase in financial leverage results in higher debt servicing costs, even with risk-free debt. (2) a smaller firm tends to experience greater debt servicing costs because of its endogenously large investment demands; and (3) in the majority of cases, equity proceeds are used for cash retention as well as capital expenditure, especially when a firm faces large current and future investment needs. In addition, I quantitatively show that large debt servicing costs are closely associated with low leverage and frequent equity financing by analyzing the role of fixed operating costs and convex capital adjustment costs. In the second chapter, I empirically support the theoretical debt servicing costs analysis of the previous chapter. I firstly examine the structural estimation method used for the calibration of my model in the first chapter. The statistical property of the simulated method of moments estimator and detailed identification scheme for the calibration are investigated {{in the first half of}} this chapter. Then I cross-sectionally confirm the validity of debt servicing costs predictions on capital structure choices. I study how each firm's convex capital adjustment costs, operating leverage, profit volatility, and future investment needs influence capital structure policies. Consistent with the debt servicing costs predictions, firms with higher convex capital adjustment costs, higher operating leverage, higher profit volatility and larger future investment demands show lower leverage ratios and more frequent equity financing activities. These findings shed new lights on pervasively conservative debt policy in U. S. public firms. A higher profitability observed in large future investment demands firms also suggests the importance of debt servicing costs consideration in resolving the puzzling negative correlation between profitability and leverage ratios. In the third chapter, I examine how macroeconomic conditions affect the cyclical variations in capital structure policies. As in the financial crisis of 2008, economic contractions affect a firm's profitability, investments and external financing conditions altogether. To address the effects of these simultaneous changes on capital structure dynamics, I develop and estimate a dynamic trade-off model with investment, payouts, and liquidity policies with macroeconomic profitability and financing shocks. Investment dynamics and a higher value of liquidity of economic downturn are pivotal in capital structure dynamics; the former drives the issuance of debt and equity, and the latter leads to <b>active</b> <b>debt</b> retirements and conservative debt issues in upturns. My model yields the following main results: (1) Equity issues are pro-cyclical, and concentrated for small, low profit, and large investment demand firms in earlier stage of economic upturns. (2) Payouts peak in later stages of upturns and co-move positively with equity issues; (3) Debt policies move counter-cyclically, and leverage ratios after debt issuance and retirement are even higher during economic downturns. My comparative static analysis predicts pro-cyclical debt policy for financially constrained firms, and pervasively conservative use of debt for firms expecting financial market shutdowns, a sharp profitability drop, or a longer stay in economic downturns...|$|E
