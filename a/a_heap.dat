5|$|The {{programme}} also disproved {{claims that}} some {{deterioration in the}} quality of the gunpowder would have prevented the explosion. A portion of deliberately deteriorated gunpowder, of such low quality as to make it unusable in firearms, when placed in <b>a</b> <b>heap</b> and ignited, still managed to create a large explosion. The impact of even deteriorated gunpowder would have been magnified by its containment in wooden barrels, compensating for the quality of the contents. The compression would have created a cannon effect, with the powder first blowing up {{from the top of the}} barrel before, a millisecond later, blowing out. Calculations showed that Fawkes, who was skilled in the use of gunpowder, had deployed double the amount needed.|$|E
5|$|A more {{progressive}} extraction process involves directly reducing manganese ore in <b>a</b> <b>heap</b> leach. This {{is done by}} percolating natural gas through {{the bottom of the}} heap; the natural gas provides the heat (needs to be at least 850°C) and the reducing agent (carbon monoxide). This reduces all of the manganese ore to manganese oxide (MnO), which is a leachable form. The ore then travels through a grinding circuit to reduce the particle size of the ore to between 150–250 μm, increasing the surface area to aid leaching. The ore is then added to a leach tank of sulfuric acid and ferrous iron (Fe2+) in a 1.6:1 ratio. The iron reacts with the manganese dioxide to form iron hydroxide and elemental manganese. This process yields approximately 92% recovery of the manganese. For further purification, the manganese can then be sent to an electrowinning facility.|$|E
5|$|Concerns {{over the}} state of the {{environment}} around the most popular parts of the Mont Blanc massif, and the need for visitors to better respect it, were reflected in a statement in 2014 by Jean-Marc Peillex, the mayor of Saint-Gervais, who said:Mont Blanc is <b>a</b> <b>heap</b> of garbage... a mountain covered with the crap, urine and detritus of the last 50 years. The problems are covered up by a nice, white blanket of snow. But I want to confront people with the reality and to reach those people who abuse the mountain. Following the construction of the new Goûter Hut used by most climbers ascending Mont Blanc, the authorities now strictly enforce a 'no wild-camping' ban above the level of Tête Rousses Hut. Each high altitude hut faces its own individual challenges, often relating to water and energy supply or waste management, and the provision of services to visitors can sometimes conflict with environmental protection. A range of individual solutions for a selection of huts within the massif and elsewhere in the Alps was identified by a project run by Espace Mont Blanc between 2007 and 2013.|$|E

In Woody Allen's live-action film Annie Hall (1977), Alvy mentions that when he saw Disney's Snow White, he was attracted to the Queen while all the other children {{had a crush on}} Snow White. This is followed by an animated sequence of the Wicked Queen, resembling Annie and voiced by Diane Keaton, talking to the cartoon version of the daydreaming Alvy, but turns out that even the Queen scolds him; Alvy attributes it to her having her period mood, to which the Queen reminds him she is just a cartoon character.|$|E

25|$|Heapsort is a {{much more}} {{efficient}} version of selection sort. It also works by determining the largest (or smallest) element of the list, placing that at the end (or beginning) of the list, then continuing {{with the rest of the}} list, but accomplishes this task efficiently by using a data structure called <b>a</b> <b>heap,</b> a special type of binary tree. Once the data list has been made into <b>a</b> <b>heap,</b> the root node is guaranteed to be the largest (or smallest) element. When it is removed and placed at the end of the list, the heap is rearranged so the largest element remaining moves to the root. Using the heap, finding the next largest element takes O(log n) time, instead of O(n) for a linear scan as in simple selection sort. This allows Heapsort to run in O(n log n) time, and this is also the worst case complexity.|$|E
25|$|Since the {{ordering}} of siblings in <b>a</b> <b>heap</b> is not {{specified by the}} heap property, a single node's two children can be freely interchanged unless doing so violates the shape property (compare with treap).

50|$|With no {{structural}} constraints, it {{may seem}} that <b>a</b> skew <b>heap</b> would be horribly inefficient. However, amortized complexity analysis {{can be used to}} demonstrate that all operations on <b>a</b> skew <b>heap</b> can be done in O(log n).|$|R
