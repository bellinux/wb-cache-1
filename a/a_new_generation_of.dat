5|$|The {{trivalent}} dysprosium ion (Dy3+) {{has been}} studied due its downshifting luminescence properties. Dy-doped yttrium aluminium garnet (YAG:Dy) excited in the ultraviolet region {{of the electromagnetic spectrum}} results in the emission of photons of longer wavelength in the visible region.

Even though the members of Bonded by Blood were not born when their favorite 1980s thrash metal bands released their debut albums, the music and fashion of that era {{had a profound impact on}} them.|$|E
5|$|In the mid-1930s, {{aviation}} design teams worldwide started developing <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>generation</b> <b>of</b> all-metal, low-wing fighter aircraft. The French Dewoitine D.520 and Germany's Messerschmitt Bf 109, for example, {{were designed}} {{to take advantage of}} new techniques of monocoque construction and the availability of new high-powered, liquid-cooled, in-line aero engines. They also featured refinements such as retractable undercarriages, fully enclosed cockpits, low drag and all-metal wings (all introduced on civil airliners years before but slow to be adopted by the military, who favoured the biplane's simplicity and manoeuvrability).|$|E
50|$|There {{are three}} <b>{{generation}}s</b> <b>of</b> D5 engines.

In the meantime, <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>generation</b> <b>of</b> aircraft had entered service and Kaga embarked 12 Mitsubishi A5M fighters, 24 Aichi D1A dive bombers and 36 Yokosuka B4Y torpedo bombers. Another 18 aircraft were carried in crates as spares.|$|E
5|$|On {{the other}} hand a guitar revival took place and raised <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>generation</b> <b>of</b> {{alternative}} guitar bands often described as post-punk revival or garage rock revival. Prominent US bands of this generation are White Stripes, The Strokes, and The Killers. New Weird America or sometimes called Freak Folk is a new movement emphasizing the artistic individuality of genre crossing artists such as Antony and the Johnsons, Joanna Newsom, The Dodos, Animal Collective and Cat Power.|$|E
5|$|Sucker Punch began {{planning}} {{the game as}} early as 2010, when they began discussion with Sony to bring the Infamous series onto <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>generation</b> <b>of</b> hardware. They provided feedback to Sony on what hardware evolutions {{they would like to}} see on the PlayStation 4 system. Sucker Punch considers Second Son a fresh start for the series because it features a new protagonist. Delsin Rowe's superpowers were designed to feel fluid and suited to the open world design.|$|E

5|$|The German {{influence}} {{brought into}} Norway by neo-classicism abated when Norway gained full independence in 1905. <b>A</b> <b>new</b> <b>generation</b> <b>of</b> Norwegian architects educated in Sweden {{took the lead}} in developing a distinctly national architecture, endeavouring to break the German historicist tradition. However, German modernism and town planning continued to influence early 20th-century architecture. As the Norwegian Institute of Technology was founded in 1910 and began to teach architecture in Trondheim, there also emerged a distinctly Norwegian collegium of architects that has contributed to a Norwegian regional architecture, discussed by the art historian Sigfried Giedeon.|$|E
5|$|The {{production}} plant commenced operation in February 1945, and as cascade after cascade came online, {{the quality of}} the product increased. By April 1945, K-25 had attained a 1.1% enrichment and the output of the S-50 thermal diffusion plant began being used as feed. Some product produced the next month reached nearly 7% enrichment. In August, the last of the 2,892 stages commenced operation. K-25 and K-27 achieved their full potential in the early postwar period, when they eclipsed the other {{production plant}}s and became the prototypes for <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>generation</b> <b>of</b> plants.|$|E
5|$|<b>A</b> <b>new</b> <b>generation</b> <b>of</b> more entertainment-oriented movies {{coming from}} the Somali film {{industry}} has grown increasingly popular among Somalis both within Somalia and in the diaspora. Referred to as Somaliwood, this upstart cinematic movement has energized the local movie scene, in the process introducing innovative storylines, production techniques and advertising strategies. The latter include cross-media marketing, with tie-in film soundtracks featuring prominent Somali music artists. Popular movies from Somaliwood include the Somali language slasher thriller Xaaskayga Araweelo, the action comedy Rajo, and Warmooge, the first Somali animated film. The young directors Abdisalam Aato of Olol Films and Abdi Malik Isak are {{at the forefront of}} this quiet revolution. In 2010, the Somali director Mo Ali also released Shank, his first feature film set in a futuristic London.|$|E

5|$|Absolutely. There's a {{song called}} 'Army of Me,' {{which is sort of}} a 'Fighter 2.0.' There is <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>generation</b> <b>of</b> fans from a younger {{demographic}} that might not have been with me all the way but that watch me on the show now. I feel like every generation should be able to enjoy and have their piece of 'Fighter' within. This time, the way it musically came together it just felt right for this time and this generation. There's {{always going to be a}} fighter in me getting through some obstacle and some hurdle. All these 6-year-olds who know me from pushing my button and turning around in a big red chair who weren't around for the actual 'Fighter,' this is my chance to recharge it, rejuvenate it and do something modernized for them.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} the 19th {{century and}} {{beginning}} of the 20th, Gibraltar's future as a British colony was in serious doubt. Its economic value was diminishing, as <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>generation</b> <b>of</b> steamships with a much longer range no longer needed to stop there to refuel en route to more distant ports. Its military value was also increasingly in question due to advances in military technology. New long-range guns firing high-explosive shells could easily reach Gibraltar from across the bay or in the Spanish hinterland, while the development of torpedoes meant that ships at anchor in the bay were also vulnerable. The garrison could hold out for a long time, but if the Spanish coast was held by an enemy, Gibraltar could not be resupplied in the fashion that had saved it in the Great Siege 120 years earlier.|$|E
5|$|By {{the late}} 1970s, however, Sinclair Radionics was {{experiencing}} serious difficulties. It lost {{its ability to}} compete effectively in the calculator market following the launch of <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>generation</b> <b>of</b> Japanese-produced calculators with liquid crystal displays, which were much more capable and power-efficient than Sinclair's LED calculators. Projects to develop a pocket television and digital watch {{turned out to be}} expensive failures. The company made losses of more than £350,000 in 1975–76, bringing it to the edge of bankruptcy. In July 1977 Radionics was rescued by a state agency, the National Enterprise Board (NEB), which recapitalised it, provided a loan facility and took effective control of the company by acquiring a 73% stake.|$|E

5|$|During {{the late}} 1950s, Hawker Siddeley Aviation (HSA) was keen to develop <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>generation</b> <b>of</b> combat {{aircraft}} {{that would be}} capable of supersonic speeds. Unfortunately, despite repeated attempts to revive the program, the in-development Hawker P.1121 fighter would ultimately be left unfinished, principally {{due to a lack of}} a political support for development following the release of the 1957 Defence White Paper by Minister of Defence Duncan Sandys. Recognising the need to promptly commence work on another development program, HSA's chief aircraft designer Sir Sydney Camm, who had been in regular discussions with Sir Stanley Hooker of Bristol Aero Engines, decided that the company should investigate the prospects of developing and manufacturing a viable combat-capable vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) fighter aircraft.|$|E
5|$|During {{the years}} {{following}} 1857, none of the cabinets survived long. They quickly collapsed {{due to the lack}} of a majority in the Chamber of Deputies. The Conservative Party had split down the middle: on one side were the ultraconservatives, and on the other, the moderate conservatives. In the wake of Carneiro Leão's cabinet, <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>generation</b> <b>of</b> politicians had emerged, eager to acquire more power inside the Conservative Party. Paranhos belonged to this younger age group. These men saw their path to the top ranks as being blocked by the Conservative elders, who would not easily relinquish control.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the release}} of Operation Flashpoint: Cold War Crisis, the team {{intended}} to continue updating the game with post-release content, develop a port for the Xbox console, and create a sequel. Projected to take only nine months to develop, the Xbox version also known as , was released in 2005, {{four years after the}} game's initial release. The reason for the long development cycle stemmed from the team's unfamiliarity with the console's structure. With {{the release of}} <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>generation</b> <b>of</b> hardware including a new Xbox console, Elites release did not gain its audience's attention. Sales were lackluster and the development suffered a huge financial loss. In 2005 the company also founded the Independent Developers Association (IDEA) with Black Element Software and Altar Games.
