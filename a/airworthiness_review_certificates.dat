For example, the Bank Administration Institute, an affiliate of the American Bankers Association, offers the Loan <b>Review</b> <b>Certificate</b> Program for persons who review and approve loans. This program enhances the quality of reviews and improves the early detection of deteriorating loans, thereby contributing to the safety and soundness of the loan portfolio. The Certified Mortgage Banker (CMB) designation demonstrates the holder's superior knowledge, understanding, and competency in real estate finance. The Mortgage Bankers Association offers three CMB designations: residential, commerce, and master's. To obtain the CMB, the candidate must have three years of experience, earn educational credits, and pass an exam.

40|$|To {{assess the}} level of {{reporting}} of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) cases, the authors <b>reviewed</b> death <b>certificates</b> for periods of 3 months during July through December 1985 in each of four cities: Washington, DC, New York City, Boston, and Chicago. Since reporting began in 1981, these cities have reported 38 percent of all AIDS cases in the United States. Death certificates were selected and matched to the AIDS surveillance registries in each city, and medical records of those not on the AIDS registry were reviewed to determine if AIDS had been diagnosed. The estimated completeness of AIDS case reporting to AIDS surveillance systems was high in all four cities (ranging from 83 percent to 100 percent). The unreported cases were similar to reported cases with respect to sex, race, risk factor, and specific diagnosis. Of the causes of death examined, AIDS, Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia, and Kaposi's sarcoma were predictive of AIDS {{as defined by the}} CDC case definition.

40|$|This {{report is}} a final thesis {{conducted}} by two {{students at the}} Academy of Innovation for Design and Technology at Ma ̈lardalens university in Va ̈ster ̊as, in collaboration with Nextjet. The purpose of this investigation is to explore the {{different ways in which}} we can improve the inspection of “Placards & Markings” for Nextjet’s SAAB- 340 aircrafts. This assesment is required by the government in the process of renewing/extending the ARC-airworthiness <b>Review</b> <b>Certificate</b> of the planes. The ARC-process is conducted according to the rules and regulations of the EASA, one of which is a review of the plane’s airworthiness. In this thesis we will explore the plausible ways of inspection while compa- ring and contrasting these different methods. The intent is to find the most adequate and reliable procedure at the lowest cost, with high security. We will focus on three chosen methods: • Visual inspection • ITS - intelligent transport system • Inspection of the aircrafts exterior {{with the help of a}} drone New technologies like ITS and drones are on the rampage and has many advantages. Both ITS and drones enables verifiability and are time-efficient methods. Despite this, the visual inspection method is currently most sui- table for Nextjet and their inspection of the ”Placards & Markings”. Visual inspection is an inexpensive alternative that requires no sophisticated equip- ment. A technical instruction must, according to the studied literature, have a structured format. Consideration should be given to the human factors that come into play during a visual inspection, which can be prevented if kept in mind when designing the instruction. The technical instruction that we designed needs to be tested in its real environment to properly evaluate its function. ...|$|R
40|$|To {{determine}} the incidence and clinicopathologic spectrum of sudden unexpected death, we <b>reviewed</b> the death <b>certificate</b> of all residents of Olmsted County, Minnesota who were between 1 and 22 {{years of age}} when they died {{during the period from}} January 1950 to October 1982. Of 515 death <b>certificates</b> <b>reviewed,</b> 12 (2. 3 %) recorded sudden unexpected death, resulting in an incidence of 1. 3 per 100, 000 patient-years. The subjects ranged in age from 3 to 20 years (median 13); 8 of the 12 were male. Of the 12 deaths, 4 were definitely cardiac-related and 3 were probably cardiac-related. In the five other cases, {{the cause of death was}} unknown. Three of the 12 subjects had a history of syncope; 2 of the 3 had syncope associated with exercise, and both died while exercising. The relative rarity of sudden unexpected death in children and adolescents probably precludes population screening techniques to identify subjects at risk. However, a subset of subjects with 1) exercise-associated syncope, 2) nonvasodepressor syncope, 3) a family history of sudden unexpected death, or 4) a family history of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy deserves extensive and thorough evaluation...|$|R

40|$|Background: Despite the endemic {{nature of}} Echinococcus granulosus and Echinococcus multilocularis {{infection}} in {{regions of the}} United States (US), {{there is a lack}} of data on echinococcosis-related mortality. To measure echinococcosis-associated mortality in the US and assess possible racial/ethnic disparities, we <b>reviewed</b> national-death <b>certificate</b> data for an 18 -year period. Methodology/Principal Findings: Echinococcosis-associated deaths from 1990 through 2007 were identified from multiple-cause-coded death records and were combined with US census data to calculate mortality rates. A total of 41 echinococcosis-associated deaths occurred over the 18 -year study period. Mortality rates were highest in males, Native Americans, Asians/Pacific Islanders, Hispanics and persons 75 years of age and older. Almost a quarter of fatal echinococcosis-related cases occurred in residents of California. Foreign-born persons accounted for the majority of echinococcosis-related deaths; however, both of the fatalities in Native Americans and almost half of the deaths in whites were among US-born individuals. Conclusions/Significance: Although uncommon, echinococcosis-related deaths occur in the US. Clinicians should be aware of the diagnosis, particularly in foreign-born patients from Echinococcus endemic areas, and should consider tropical infectious disease consultation early...|$|R

40|$|Objective: To {{determine}} the outcomes for patients following applications to regional review boards at an Ontario provincial psychiatric hospital for 1992 through 1994. Method: A retrospective casenote study examined frequency of readmission, time to next admission, status upon readmission, and episodes of dangerous behaviour perpetrated {{in the community}} for patients applying to review boards. Results: Over 3 years, 116 hearings took place to <b>review</b> various <b>certificates.</b> Only 57 % of applications reached a hearing. Of those, 69 % were confirmed and 31 % rescinded. A small group of patients made multiple applications to the review board.
