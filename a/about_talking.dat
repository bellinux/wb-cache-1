At lunch, Lois and Brenda begin {{talking about the}} situation, and requests that Brenda remove her sunglasses, revealing a bruise over her eye. Upon seeing this, Lois tries to convince Brenda to leave Jeff, but Brenda only makes excuses for Jeff's treatment of her, much to Lois' disapproval. Later, at the bar, Peter, Quagmire and Joe discuss the matter, asking if the police can solve the situation. Joe then suggests that the group have an intervention with Brenda, where Quagmire confesses that the sister he knew growing up no longer exists, and he wants her back. The two then embrace each other by hugging, until Jeff enters the intervention, causing an enraged Quagmire {{to tell him that}} Brenda has agreed to leave him. Pressured by Jeff, Brenda reveals that the two are engaged, and that she is pregnant.|$|E

500|$|During {{production}} of the first anime adaptation, the author often visited the TMS Entertainment studio, where the voice actors requested advice about their characters. Although Hoshino was nervous <b>about</b> <b>talking</b> with them, she was surprised by their dedication in practising their characters—particularly Sanae Kobayashi (Allen), Takahiro Sakurai (Kanda), Katsuyuki Konishi (Komui), and Hiroki Tōchi (Cross Marian)—and joked that Lenalee seemed more beautiful after she saw Shizuka Itō's work. Early in production, Hoshino was shown {{an early version of}} the first opening theme: [...] "Innocent Sorrow" [...] by the Japanese rock band Abingdon Boys School. When she saw the video, Hoshino began to cry in delight while the staff laughed to her. Tyki Mikk's voice actor, Toshiyuki Morikawa, remembered the recording sessions for the series as [...] "lively" [...] {{because of the presence of}} many popular actors. After the anime finished, the actors (who became friends during production) kept in touch.|$|E

[...] The network's executives were receptive to the idea, which {{would be one of the}} main reasons Parker and Stone decided to sign on with the channel. The first episode of the series, [...] "Cartman Gets an Anal Probe", debuted on Comedy Central on August 13, 1997, while Mr. Hankey debuted a few months later in the ninth episode, [...] "Mr. Hankey, the Christmas Poo".|$|E

500|$|After {{his return}} from America in February 1937 Gielgud starred in He Was Born Gay by Emlyn Williams. This romantic tragedy about French royalty after the Revolution was quite well {{received}} during its pre-London tour, but was savaged by the critics in the West End. The Times said, [...] "This {{is one of those}} occasions on which criticism does not stand <b>about</b> <b>talking,</b> but rubs its eyes and withdraws hastily with an embarrassed, incredulous, and uncomprehending blush. What made Mr Emlyn Williams write this play or Mr Gielgud and Miss Ffrangcon-Davies appear in it is not to be understood." [...] The play closed after twelve performances. Its failure, so soon after his Shakespearean triumphs, prompted Gielgud to examine his career and his life. His domestic relationship with Perry was comfortable but unexciting, he saw no future in a film career, and the Old Vic could not afford to stage the classics on the large scale to which he aspired. He decided that he must form his own company to play Shakespeare and other classic plays in the West End.|$|E
500|$|Although the Mr. Hankey {{short film}} was never made, Parker and Stone made two Christmas-related {{animated}} short films called The Spirit of Christmas, {{which served as}} precursors to the South Park series. When the shorts began to generate interest for a possible television series, Parker and Stone originally conceived {{the idea of a}} South Park-like show with four children characters, but with a talking stool named Mr. Hankey as the show's main protagonist; they planned to call it [...] "The Mr. Hankey Show". They pitched the idea to friend Brian Graden, then a television executive with the Fox Broadcasting Company, but he rejected it and said, according to Matt Stone, [...] "I'm not putting poo on my network". Parker and Stone adapted their original idea into a show revolving around the South Park town and four children without Mr. Hankey as a protagonist, but they planned to revive the character as a minor supporting role in a future episode. Later, when Comedy Central expressed interest in the series, Parker and Stone brought up the idea of a Mr. Hankey episode during negotiations with the network executives. Parker claimed during a meeting, he said, [...] "One thing we have to know before we really go any further: how do you feel <b>about</b> <b>talking</b> poo?" [...] The executives were receptive to the idea, which Parker said {{was one of the main}} reasons he and Stone decided to sign on with the channel.|$|E

2500|$|As Wright philosophized of {{this period}} some thirty years later, 'Having a witness among the poor and having a {{ministry}} to the poor is one thing, but making the poor folks members of your congregation is something else altogether." [...] Wright further explained, [...] "Failure to have the black poor {{at the table with}} you as equals means you are doing missionary work," [...] while having [...] "poor black folks" [...] who [...] "sit down at the table as equals" [...] means you are [...] "serious <b>about</b> <b>talking</b> or doing [...] black theology." [...] As Speller explains, Trinity's congregants [...] "began to slowly move away from the concept of church as a place to enhance and validate their social position to one that appreciated the church as a place for spiritual formation." [...] In sum, Trinity began to more fully move away from its earlier purpose surrounding [...] "middle-classness" [...] to one where devotion to God and the poor took much greater prominence.|$|E
2500|$|Early blackface songs often {{consisted}} of unrelated verses strung {{together by a}} common chorus. In this pre-Emmett minstrelsy, the music [...] "jangled the nerves of those who believed in music that was proper, respectable, polished, and harmonic, with recognizable melodies." [...] It was thus a juxtaposition of [...] "vigorous earth-slapping footwork of black dances … with the Irish lineaments of blackface jigs and reels." [...] Similar to {{the look of a}} blackface performer, the lyrics in the songs that were sung have a tone of mockery and a spirit of laughing at black Americans rather than with them. The minstrel show texts sometimes even mixed black lore, such as stories <b>about</b> <b>talking</b> animals or slave tricksters, with humor from the region southwest of the Appalachians, itself a mixture of traditions from different races and cultures. Minstrel instruments were also a mélange: African banjo and tambourine with European fiddle and bones In short, early minstrel music and dance was not true black culture; it was a white reaction to it. This was the first large-scale appropriation and commercial exploitation of black culture by American whites.|$|E
