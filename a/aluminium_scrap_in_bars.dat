40|$|Various {{solid state}} or ‘meltless’ {{recycling}} techniques {{have recently been}} developed for light metal <b>scrap</b> <b>in</b> form of chips. Main objective of all approaches is to bypass the need for remelting {{in order to reduce}} the overall required energy, and to avoid the material losses that occur during this step.

40|$|Industrial {{upscaling}} {{of solid}} state recycling of <b>aluminium</b> machining <b>scrap</b> can offer significant {{environmental and economic}} benefits compared to the conventional practice of recycling by means of remelting. This paper assesses the valorization potential of aluminium solid state recycling (SSR) by means of hot extrusion by investigating the potential for market application, the possibility of scaling up towards a cost-competitive industrial process and {{the validity of the}} low environmental impact associated with SSR for the proposed industrial process. The total yearly supply of suitable wrought <b>aluminium</b> machining <b>scrap</b> <b>in</b> Europe, which amounts for 331 kton or 11 % of yearly new <b>aluminium</b> <b>scrap,</b> can find its first market applications in transport and construction. It suits the requirements of non-safety critical applications in transport and non-visible applications in construction. For the economic and environmental assessment of industrial upscaling, 3 scenarios are compared: a SSR route based on existing SSR research data, a SSR route based on an industrial scale experimental setup and a conventional recycling route by means of remelting. Based on the experimental setup, estimations for an actual industrial batch- and continuous process are made. The operational costs of the industrial SSR extrusion route are compared with the remelting route. For machining scrap, SSR has almost always a cost advantage compared to the remelting recycling route, provided a continuous SSR process is used. This advantage depends on the avoided metal losses and the price the scrap recycler has to pay for <b>aluminium</b> <b>scrap.</b> Industrial scale SSR is found to reduce the environmental impact of recycling <b>aluminium</b> machining <b>scrap</b> with 54 - 74 % compared to the remelting route. status: submitte...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to review, and draw {{attention}} to, issues raised by the recycling of wrought aluminium from motor cars, even though the time horizon for significant arisings of such <b>aluminium</b> <b>scrap</b> is <b>in</b> the order of 20 years from now. Recycling of specific grades of wrought aluminium will be viable only when a means of positively identifying different types of scrap is available. A solution must be reliable, rapid, and low-cost; probably used in conjunction with a vehicle shredder. Such a system of identification will eliminate the need for costly hand-dismantling and segregation. Simple segregation of cast and wrought alloy will, however, be essential when wrought aluminium from car bodies dominates the scrap arisings. Such segregation will produce two high-value scrap products. The first of which will be similar to the A 380 casting alloy specification, maintaining the current supply of this scrap, and the second will be a composite of wrought alloys.

40|$|The goal of {{this life}} cycle {{assessment}} is to investigate refining methods which {{makes it possible to}} utilise post-consumer <b>aluminium</b> <b>scrap</b> <b>in</b> production of <b>aluminium</b> products that have strict requirements to chemical purity. A further goal is to establish whether applying these methods are environmentally preferable compared to using primary aluminium to produce the same products. The investigation is based on a given scrap composition and given purity limits that must be achieved for the refined aluminium, related to six alloying elements. Based on the given requirements, a selection of refining processes which are able to refine the given scrap to meet the given limits are identified. Table A below gives the scrap composition and the desired range of removal to fit seven different alloy requirements. The scrap composition is given in weight%. Table A: Scrap composition and desired level of removal.

Electrolysis can in theory be used to eliminate any tramp element <b>in</b> the <b>scrap,</b> as it extracts the pure aluminium from the melt using an electric current. Unfortunately this is an expensive, energy consuming process which requires use of chemicals. Fractional crystallisation does not require any chemicals and generally has low energy use, but this is a slow method which currently is not continuous. The ability of fractional crystallisation to remove the various elements depends on their solubility in aluminium in solid and liquid state. Various studies show that this method is promising for removal of Si, Fe and Cu, mediocre for Mg and Zn and poor for Mn. Based on this, six different production scenarios for secondary scrap, to meet the set of alloy requirements, were developed. The life cycle impact assessment conducted for the different refining scenarios shows that energy use is very closely linked to the environmental burden associated with each of the production scenarios. From an environmental perspective low temperature, electrolysis and fractional crystallisation seem to be the best alternatives. Since the assessment is based on specific requirements set by the scrap composition and the given purity limits, an overall impression is that other possibilities to handle excess scrap should be investigated further. For example better sorting processes to separate tramp elements earlier in the production or development of alloys which are made with a motive for recycling. Such methods {{are likely to be more}} relevant when the use of aluminium has increased even further and more stable sources of scrap can be established. </p...|$|R

The objective of this thesis is to identify the most important barriers to closed-loop recycling of aluminium beverage cans in the USA, and explore potential solutions. The research was conducted using the material flow analysis framework, creating a static model for the secondary aluminium production for cans, and a detailed dynamic model for beverage can recycling, to track various chemical elements through the cycle and include all relevant entry paths of contamination to the system. The dynamic model was developed to quantify the accumulation of alloying elements after each recycling loop in a can-to-can system, in order to predict the maximum recycling rate achievable. The {{results show that the}} main barrier to reach the 75 % can recycling rate target set by the aluminium industry in the USA is the low recovery of UBCs after the use phase, where almost 50 % of the UBCs are lost to landfills or incineration facilities. The results also shows that the surplus of alloying elements and entry of impurities will be a limiting factor in the recyclability of cans in the future, if the recycling rate increases and a close loop can-to-can system is achieved, owing to the sensitivity of the system to the entry of impurities. Without a better UBCs recovery and supply chain, further technological development for the reprocessing of aluminium cans, and improvement of production yields, it will not be possible to reach 100 % recycling rate. </p...|$|R

Based on this analysis, it is possible to project some scenarios and to quantify the environmental impacts (generated and avoided) associated with aluminium recycling within a global market. From the MFA results, we projected that the demand for aluminium products will be met mainly with an increase in primary aluminium imports, and the excess of old <b>scrap</b> not used <b>in</b> Spain will be exported in future years, mainly to Asia.

40|$|The {{global demand}} for {{aluminium}} and aluminium products is progressively increasing. However, {{the production of}} primary aluminium is an energy intensive process and emits at the world average ~ 12 tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (CDE) per tonne metal. However, aluminium recycling is attractive because one can save up to 90 % of the energy, as well as 95 % of the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. The aluminium recycling industry is facing several challenges, such as treatment and disposal of by-products, emissions control and requirements related to energy efficiency. A {{state of the art}} remelting furnace requires 2. 5 GJ/tonne metal, which is more than twice the theoretical energy consumption. Also, remelting of fine scrap, such as turnings and chips leads to significant metal loss. However, solid state recycling methods not involving remelting might offer higher metal yield and lower energy consumption than conventional recycling based on remelting. In the present study, solid state recycling of aluminium turnings and sawing scrap was investigated by cold compaction and subsequent hot extrusion and Cyclic Extrusion and Compression (CEC), respectively. Degreasing of <b>aluminium</b> <b>scrap</b> by thermal treatment or acetone treatment was compared with respect to the recycled metal products. In addition, ECAP of hot extruded materials was used for evaluating the internal bonding and deformation behaviour during severe plastic deformation. Mechanical properties and microstructures of the extruded and ECAPed materials were carefully investigated. Also, characterization of <b>aluminium</b> <b>scraps,</b> e. g. automotive <b>aluminium</b> <b>scrap</b> and <b>aluminium</b> primary dross was performed using state of the art techniques, such as EPMA and XRD with Rietveld refinement. Finally, the energy requirement for solid state recycling processing was calculated and discussed. Characterization of <b>aluminium</b> <b>scraps</b> revealed that impurities were quite common <b>in</b> industry <b>scraps.</b> Also contaminations, e. g. metallic iron and its oxides, lead and TiO 2 were observed <b>in</b> the automotive <b>scrap</b> collected from a commercial shredder. Aluminium dross has a complicated composition, containing metallic aluminium particles, corundum, spinel etc. The EPMA results showed that iron and manganese and their oxides were widely distributed in the dross fines. Metallic aluminium in dross tended to solidify as large size particles. The leachate from aluminium dross water leaching exhibited a high content of fluoride and H 2 gas bubbles after leaching for 72 hours. The results from the TG/DTA-MS analysis indicated an optimal thermal degreasing temperature, e. g. ~ 428 C. High temperature thermal treatment of turnings resulted in a significant increase of scrap surface oxide films. However, the combustion peak for the lubricants was ~ 374 C, corresponding to the second DTG peak at ~ 350 C. In addition, the thermal treatment time should be optimized so as to complete the decomposition and combustion of the lubricants. CEC processed <b>aluminium</b> sawing <b>scrap</b> turned out to be fully dense. However, room temperature tensile properties after CEC revealed high variability, indicating the presence of material inhomogeneity. Besides, microstructure observations showed that the scrap from sawing contained a mixture of different aluminium alloys. This could be part of the explanation versus the inhomogeneity. Also, a fully dense material was obtained for the aluminium turnings processed by hot extrusion at 500 C at an extrusion ratio of 15 : 1. The corresponding hardness and room temperature tensile strength values constituted 95 - 98 % of the properties of conventional reference material. To be noticed, the thermal treatment of feedstock turnings at 350 C for 30 minutes did not introduce obvious differences in mechanical properties of the recycled extruded materials as compared to acetone treated feedstock. Post extrusion ECAP showed improved mechanical properties and enhanced internal interface bonding. Oxides produced at the feedstock surfaces could be broken and redistributed upon hot extrusion and especially after ECAP applying a high number of passes at elevated temperatures, e. g. 8 passes at 100 C or 200 C. As a consequence, the key mechanical properties, such as the fracture elongation and the UTS, could be nearly as good as the conventional material counterparts. Energy requirement estimations for solid state recycling revealed that the precompaction process uses less than 7 % of the energy required for the world’s best practice conventional remelting, and resulted in a 93 % carbon dioxide equivalent emission reduction.
