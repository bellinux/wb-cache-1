5|$|During {{the voice}} recording, two {{characters}} posed problems: You, <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> the by far most lines of any {{character in the}} game, causing her voice actor, Noriko Shitaya, to get exhausted from how much she had to speak; and Sora, whose long lines with difficult terms were a challenge for her voice actor, Hiroko Kasahara.|$|E

60|$|Thus {{the total}} volume of Inter-Ally indebtedness, {{assuming}} that loans from one Ally are not set off against loans to another, is nearly $20,000,000,000. The United States is a lender only. The United Kingdom has lent about twice <b>as</b> much <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>has</b> borrowed. France has borrowed about three times <b>as</b> much <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>has</b> lent. The other Allies have been borrowers only.|$|R

5|$|Later that year, Black {{announced}} through French radio station, Skyrock, {{that the}} album had no confirmed title, revealing she had considered the names Black Rainbow and Mannequin Factory, but that those titles {{might not make}} it to the album <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> recorded more songs.|$|E

5|$|The {{film was}} Machiko Kyō's second {{collaboration}} with Mizoguchi, <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> a small {{role in his}} 1944 film The Three Danjuros.

As Lady Wakasa, Kyō's costume was modeled after fashion before the Edo period {{and her face was}} designed to appear similar to a mask common in Noh theatre.|$|E

5|$|When the iPhone {{debuted in}} June 2007, Ezarik covered the device's debut at the Mall of America in Bloomington, Minnesota a suburb south of Minneapolis, Minnesota.

5|$|Another song {{sequence}} ("Suraj Hua Maddham") involving Khan and Kajol {{was shot}} with {{the backdrop of}} the Pyramids of Giza in the city of Cairo in Egypt. Due to the lighting conditions, the crew could shoot only between 7 and 9am in the morning. As a result, the song took several days to film. In addition, Kajol suffered from a minor injury while filming for the song, <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> experienced a bad fall.|$|E

5|$|At 09:15, {{two more}} ships {{appeared}} on the scene– Mount Temple and Californian, which had finally learned of the disaster when her radio operator returned to duty– but by then {{there were no more}} survivors to be rescued. Carpathia had been bound for Fiume, Austria-Hungary (now Rijeka, Croatia), but <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> neither the stores nor the medical facilities to cater for the survivors, Rostron ordered that a course be calculated to return the ship to New York, where the survivors could be properly looked after. Carpathia departed the area, leaving the other ships to carry out a final, fruitless, two-hour search.|$|E
5|$|Because of the ship's high profile, {{there were}} {{concerns}} about her stability {{in bad weather}} <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> {{a significant amount of}} weight mounted high in the ship; notably her catapults, cranes and anti-aircraft guns. To increase her stability, two lateral tanks were fitted with a pressurized butterfly valve connecting them so that water could flow between the tanks to counter her rolling motion. On trials in 1933, the system was judged successful as it deadened the ship's roll by 37-65%. However, maintenance of the system proved to be problematic as the tanks were difficult to access.|$|E
5|$|During the German-led Axis {{invasion}} of Yugoslavia in April 1941, the vessel {{was captured by}} the Italians and served with the Royal Italian Navy under her Yugoslav designation, conducting coastal and second-line escort duties in the Adriatic.

5|$|Following {{the murder}} of Jon Snow, his dire-wolf Ghost begins to howl as the sun rises above Castle Black, {{attracting}} the attention of Davos Seaworth, Eddison Tollett, {{and a few other}} loyalists. They release Ghost from his nearby pen and take Jon's body into a store-room, whereupon Melisandre briefly visits and is troubled, <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> experienced a vision in the flames where Jon was fighting at Winterfell. The loyalists become fearful and also lock themselves in from the mutineers, with the exception of Edd, who sneaks out of Castle Black to get assistance from the Wildlings against the mutineers.|$|E
5|$|Funding was {{a problem}} from the outset. No {{producer}} was willing to finance the film, as it lacked stars, songs and action scenes. On learning of Ray's plan, one producer, Mr Bhattacharya of Kalpana Movies, contacted Bandopadhyay's widow to request the filming rights and get the film made by Debaki Bose, a well-established director. The widow declined <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> already permitted Ray to make the film. The estimated budget for the production was 70,000 (about US$14,613 in 1955). One producer, Rana Dutta, gave money to continue shooting, but had to stop after some of his films flopped.|$|E
5|$|In August 2013, Vice-Admiral Shekhar Sinha, {{chief of}} the Western Naval Command, said the Ministry of Defence would scrap the ship <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> become very {{difficult}} to maintain and no private bidders had offered to fund the museum's operations. On 3 December 2013, the Indian government decided to auction the ship. The Bombay High Court dismissed a public-interest lawsuit filed by Kiran Paigankar to stop the auction, stating the vessel's dilapidated condition did not warrant her preservation, nor were the necessary funds or government support available.|$|E
