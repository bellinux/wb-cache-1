5|$|The episode {{begins with}} the funeral of Angela, who {{departed}} the show during the second series, after being killed by <b>a</b> <b>moose,</b> {{at least according to}} Guy. Mac, after a month's leave, discovers what has happened between Caroline and Guy, and although hurt, makes no attempt to interfere. Guy, on learning of Mac's terminal illness, tells Caroline to marry Mac instead of him.|$|E
5|$|As well as food, camping equipment, and dog-care gear, mushers {{must carry}} an axe, a cold-weather {{sleeping}} bag, {{a pair of}} snowshoes, veterinary records, Quest promotional material, a cooker, and eight booties per dog. Included in the required promotional material are numerous event covers intended to reflect the Quest's ancestry as a mail route. One unusual rule requires mushers to immediately butcher any game animal killed during the race. This rule was applied in 1993, when a musher was attacked by <b>a</b> <b>moose</b> and killed it to protect himself.|$|E
5|$|Early European explorers in North America, {{who were}} {{familiar}} with the smaller red deer of Europe, thought that the larger North American animal resembled <b>a</b> <b>moose,</b> and consequently gave it the name elk, which is the common European name for moose. The word elk is related to the Latin alces, Old Norse elgr, Scandinavian elg/älg and German Elch, all of which refer to the animal known in North America as the moose.|$|E

5|$|The episode {{begins at}} a funeral, {{attended}} by Guy, Caroline, Boyce (Oliver Chris), Martin Dear (Karl Theobald) and Sue White (Michelle Gomez). References {{made in the}} episode lead the viewer to first {{believe that it is}} Mac's funeral, but then a giant picture of Angela Hunter (Sarah Alexander), who left the hospital in series two, appears. The cause of her death is not fully explained, although comments made by the characters indicate she died in a hunting accident with <b>a</b> <b>moose.</b> The plot then splits between three groups of characters.|$|E
5|$|After {{challenging}} for a Canucks roster spot once {{again during the}} team's 2010 training camp, Hodgson {{was assigned to the}} Manitoba Moose. He scored his first regular season AHL goal against goaltender Peter Delmas of the Hamilton Bulldogs on October 22, 2010. With the score tied 3–3 after overtime, Hodgson added a shootout goal to help the Moose win the game. Later, in December 2010, Hodgson suffered a broken orbital bone after he was high-sticked by teammate Lee Sweatt during <b>a</b> <b>Moose</b> practice. Eight days after returning to Manitoba's line-up, Hodgson earned his first NHL call-up to Vancouver.|$|E
5|$|Following the 1992 race, {{controversy}} erupted {{when the}} Alaska {{board of directors}} of Yukon Quest International informed the Yukon board that they were considering dropping the Yukon half of the Quest because Yukon officials did not meet fundraising goals. Alaska officials also believed {{it would be easier to}} manage an Alaska-only race. A crisis was averted when the Yukon board of directors agreed to raise more money and the two sides formed a joint board of directors. The 1993 race was run as usual, but Jeff Mann had a more eventful race than most. When <b>a</b> <b>moose</b> attacked his dog team, he was forced to kill it with an axe, then butcher it according to Quest rules. Later, he was penalized 90minutes for borrowing a reporter's head lantern. Finally, after the conclusion of the race, he was fined half his winnings when his dogs tested positive for ibuprofen.|$|E

5|$|On March 17, 2010, Schroeder {{signed a}} {{contract}} with the Canucks and was assigned to their American Hockey League affiliate, the Manitoba Moose. Similar to other National Hockey League entry-level contracts, Schroeder's contract was for three years; he would make US$900,000 per year while in the NHL, or $65,000 to $70,000 per year to play in the minor leagues, with a signing bonus of $270,000. In his first professional game on March 21, 2010, against the Grand Rapids Griffins, Schroeder scored two goals, including the game-winning goal, as the Moose defeated the Griffins, 4–0. He played eleven games in the regular season for the Moose and scored four goals and five assists as the team advanced to the playoffs. In the third game of the opening-round playoff series against the Hamilton Bulldogs on April 19, 2010, Schroeder scored his first professional hat trick (three goals in a game), and the first hat trick by <b>a</b> <b>Moose</b> player during the season, as the Moose won their first game of the playoffs, 7–2. Schroeder played in all six of the Moose's playoff games and registered three goals and three assists. As he was signed after the NHL trade deadline, Schroeder was not eligible to join the Canucks for the NHL playoffs.|$|E
25|$|In 1900, {{an attempt}} to {{introduce}} moose into the Hokitika area failed; then in 1910 ten moose (four bulls and six cows) were introduced into Fiordland. This area is considered a less than suitable habitat, and subsequent low numbers of sightings and kills have led to some presumption of this population's failure. The last proven sighting of <b>a</b> <b>moose</b> in New Zealand was in 1952. However, <b>a</b> <b>moose</b> antler was found in 1972, and DNA tests showed that hair collected in 2002 was from <b>a</b> <b>moose.</b> There has been extensive searching, and while automated cameras failed to capture photographs, evidence was seen of bedding spots, browsing and antler marks.|$|E

50|$|It {{is unclear}} whether the name (translated from the Lac d'Orignal) was given {{because of the large}} moose {{population}} of the area or because the shape of the lake resembles <b>a</b> <b>moose's</b> head - Franchere Bay and Vezeau Bay being the antlers, Bonnyville Beach the chin, and Island Bay the nose (complete with a large island for a nostril).|$|R

25|$|The {{greatest}} danger to people from moose is car collisions. From 1995 to 2006, {{there was an}} average of one collision a year of <b>a</b> <b>moose</b> and an automobile across the state, although {{in the first half}} of 2007, there were four, including one in June on the Merritt Parkway in Stamford. Unlike deer, moose that feel threatened tend to stand their ground.|$|E
25|$|In November 1908 Gort {{visited his}} uncle, Jeffrey Edward Prendergast Vereker, a retired British army major and {{youngest}} {{son of the}} 4th Viscount Gort in Kenora, Ontario. During <b>a</b> <b>moose</b> hunting trip, Gort slipped off a large boulder and his rifle discharged, wounding his guide, William Prettie. Prettie later died of his wound in Winnipeg. Viscount Gort immediately returned to England.|$|E

5000|$|Marked on <b>a</b> map as <b>Moose</b> Jaw Bone Creek in an 1857 {{survey by}} {{surveyor}} John Palliser, two theories exist {{as to how}} the city got its name. The first is it comes from the Plains Cree name moscâstani-sîpiy meaning [...] "a warm place by the river", indicative of the protection from the weather the Coteau range provides to the river valley containing the city and also the Plains Cree word moose gaw, meaning warm breezes. The other is on the map of the city, the Moose Jaw River is shaped like <b>a</b> <b>moose's</b> jaw.|$|R

The intense recount between Al Franken and Norm Coleman is shown in Split Decision, where Paul Wellstone is the referee standing between the two politicians, dressed like boxers.

25|$|The {{coat of arms}} of Jämtland, {{created for}} Karl X Gustav's funeral, derived from a seal which had been granted to Jämtland in 1635 by the Danish king. The beasts on this seal were {{difficult}} to identify. (Is the primary animal a deer, moose or reindeer? Is it a dog, wolf or bear? An eagle or a falcon?) The identity of these animals as <b>a</b> <b>moose</b> between a dog and a falcon was settled in 1884. According to popular perception, these represent Jämtland torn between Norway and Sweden, though obviously this meaning was not officially assigned by any royal authority. Svante Höglin claimed the scene to portray <b>a</b> <b>moose</b> hunted by a trained hunting dog and falcon, and in 1935 the coat of arms was revised, adding a collar and a bell to aid in identifying the dog and the falcon, respectively. Strangely, the revised blazon does not mention the moose's attire although the prototype in the Riksheraldikerämbetet (Swedish National Heraldry Office) is provided with secondary colours for the antlers, beak, hooves and claws.|$|E
50|$|The extinct Irish elk (Megaloceros giganteus) and the stag-moose (Cervalces scotti) were {{of similar}} or of {{slightly}} larger size than the Alaskan moose. However, the Irish elk could have antlers spanning up to 4.3 m across, {{about twice the}} maximum span for <b>a</b> <b>moose's</b> antlers. Cervalces latifrons was twice as heavy as the Irish elk but its antlers were smaller.|$|R

The fourth in the series was <b>a</b> <b>moose,</b> the fifth coin was the pronghorn antelope, and the sixth and final coin was the wood bison.|$|E
25|$|Moose are not grazing animals but browsers (concentrate selectors). Like giraffes, moose {{carefully}} select {{foods with}} less fiber and more concentrations of nutrients. Thus, the moose's digestive system has evolved to accommodate this relatively low-fiber diet. Unlike most hooved, domesticated animals (ruminants), moose cannot digest hay, and feeding it to <b>a</b> <b>moose</b> can be fatal. The moose's varied and complex diet is typically expensive {{for humans to}} provide, and free-range moose {{require a lot of}} forested acreage for sustainable survival, {{which is one of the}} main reasons moose have never been widely domesticated.|$|E
25|$|Mary Shields was {{the first}} woman to {{complete}} the race, in 1974 (Finishing 23rd). In 1985 Libby Riddles was the only musher to brave a blizzard, becoming the first woman to win the race. She was featured in Vogue, and named the Professional Sportswoman of the Year by the Women's Sports Foundation. Susan Butcher withdrew from the same race after two of her dogs were killed by <b>a</b> <b>moose,</b> but she became the second woman to win the race the next year and subsequently won three of the next four races. Butcher was the second musher to win four races and the only musher to finish in either first or second place for five straight years.|$|E
