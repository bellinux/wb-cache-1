5|$|The key {{breeding}} {{species are}} reed bed specialists {{such as the}} marsh harrier, Eurasian bittern and bearded reedling, together with the <b>avocet,</b> the RSPB's symbolic bird. Bitterns stopped breeding on the reserve in 1989 due to inadequate habitat {{and a lack of}} sufficient large food fish; although European eels, a favoured food, are present, the numbers are too low. These problems were addressed by managing water levels and excavating some of the reed bed to create open, reed-fringed pools, and stocking the lagoon with the common rudd; breeding recommenced in 2004. In 2011, there were 80 <b>avocet</b> nests, two pairs of Eurasian bitterns, and four pairs of marsh harriers, the latter successfully fledging seven young.|$|E
5|$|Jansch toured Scandinavia, {{working as}} a duo with Martin Jenkins and, based on ideas they developed, {{recorded}} the <b>Avocet</b> album (initially released in Denmark). Jansch rates this as among his own favourites from his own recordings. On returning to England, he set up Bert Jansch's Guitar Shop at 220, New King's Road, Fulham. The shop specialised in hand-built acoustic guitars but was not a commercial success and closed after two years.|$|E
5|$|Species present {{all year}} round include little and great crested grebes, lapwing, redshank, tufted duck, gadwall, kingfisher, reed bunting, great spotted woodpecker, {{sparrowhawk}} and little owl. In the spring, passage waders visit the pools alongside the estuary; these include whimbrel, common, wood and green sandpipers, spotted redshank, common greenshank, <b>avocet,</b> godwit, little gull and black tern, and other migrants arriving at the reserve include wheatear, whinchat, redstart and black redstart.|$|E

40|$|We {{measured}} the field metabolic rates of six incubating <b>Avocets</b> by the doubly-labelled water method in a colony on the North-Frisian Wadden Sea coast in 1994. The <b>Avocets</b> {{had a mean}} field metabolic rate of 5. 04 W (SD+/- 0. 33 W), which is only 2. 3 times their basal metabolic rate as calculated by the allometric equations of KERSTEN & PIERSMA 1987. The mean water contents of the <b>Avocets</b> was 66. 8 % (SD+/- 2, 4 %). The water efflux was very high and showed a very high variation between the birds (mean 178 ml/day, SD+/- 48 ml). <b>Avocets</b> with a low body mass (females) tended to have both higher water contents (in %) and higher water efflux rates than <b>Avocets</b> with a high body mass (males); A comparison with other studies reveals, that the field metabolic rates of waders during the breeding season are strongly influenced by the geographical position of their breeding sites and the related thermostatic costs...|$|R
5|$|The key {{breeding}} {{species are}} reed bed specialists {{such as the}} marsh harrier, Eurasian bittern and bearded reedling, and the island-nesting <b>avocet.</b> Other birds nesting in the wetland include northern lapwing, common redshank and sedge, reed and Cetti's warblers. Eurasian spoonbills, ruffs and black-tailed godwits are present {{for much of the}} year, and a pair of little egrets bred {{for the first time in}} 2010â€“2012.|$|E
5|$|The high {{salinity}} {{in parts}} of the lake makes them uninhabitable for all but a few species, including brine shrimp, brine flies, and several forms of algae. The brine flies have an estimated population of over one hundred billion and serve as the main source of food for many of the birds which migrate to the lake. However, the fresh- and salt-water wetlands along the eastern and northern edges of the Great Salt Lake provide critical habitat for millions of migratory shorebirds and waterfowl in western North America. These marshes account for approximately 75% of the wetlands in Utah. Some of the birds that depend on these marshes include: Wilson's phalarope, red-necked phalarope, American <b>avocet,</b> black-necked stilt, marbled godwit, snowy plover, western sandpiper, long-billed dowitcher, tundra swan, American white pelican, white-faced ibis, California gull, eared grebe, peregrine falcon, bald eagle, plus large populations of various ducks and geese.|$|E

40|$|Thesis (M. S.) [...] Humboldt State University, Wildlife Management, 1988 Population trends, habitat use, and {{behavioral}} ecology of American <b>Avocets</b> (Recurvirostra americana) wintering at Humboldt Bay, California were studied from 1 October 1982 to 15 May 1983, from 3 October 1983 to 8 May 1984 and from 19 December 1984 to 29 April 1985. Between November and February populations of American <b>Avocets</b> at Humboldt Bay averaged 706 ?? 35. 6 and 567 ?? 67. 0 birds in 1982 - 83 and 1983 - 84 respectively. Fall migrants began {{to arrive at}} Humboldt Bay in late August and by mid-November most of the wintering population was present. Spring migration began in February and ended in late April or early May. American <b>Avocets</b> used only 23. 6 percent (868 ha.) of North Humboldt Bay. Within {{the northeast corner of}} Humboldt Bay 4 major habitats were used: (1) Intertidal mudflats, used mainly for feeding and resting, (2) Sewage Oxidation Pond, used mainly for feeding and secondarily as a source of fresh water, (3) Islands in Klopp Lake, used as principle high tide roosts and (4) a section of high elevation mudflat north of Jacoby Creek, used as an alternate high tide roost. American <b>Avocets</b> usually roosted in shallow water. Islands adjacent to deep, non-tidal ponds were important componets of roosting habitat. Use of roosts was tidally controlled. An average of 87. 3 percent of all birds observed rested when tide levels were between 5. 0 and 7. 5 feet. American <b>Avocets</b> were the only common wintering shorebird to feed on the high concentrations of Daphne magna at the Oxidation Ponds. This food source was used mainly in October. Intertidal mudflats within 3 km. of the roost were the principle feeding areas during most of the winter. American <b>Avocets</b> used tactile feeding methods primarily and fed most often on the wettest substrates. <b>Avocets</b> usually concentrated near the tide edge when feeding. Greatest proportions of the flock was observed feeding when tide levels were between 1. 6 and 4. 0 feet. Most other shorebirds avoided American <b>Avocets</b> that were feeding. Interspecific and intraspecific competition probably was not ecologically important. <b>Avocets</b> foraged an average of 45 - 60 percent of the daylight hours in March and April and 84 percent between November and February. <b>Avocets</b> fed at night from November to March but not during October, April or May. American <b>Avocets</b> rested more on the intertidal mudflats and at the roosts during strong winds, during heavy rains, and when temperatures were less than 11 ??C than under other conditions. A greater proportion of <b>Avocets</b> fed on invertebrates found on exposed mudflats with visible surface water when temperatures were greater than 10 ??C than below 10 ??C. During light rains and under overcast skies American <b>Avocets</b> fed primarily on invertebrates found on flooded mudflats where the water covered their feet or on exposed mudflats with visible surface water...|$|R

50|$|Due {{to their}} {{relatively}} large size, red-necked <b>avocets</b> have few predators. Introduced or feral animals, including red foxes or feral cats, take chicks and eggs.

25|$|Birds which {{prefer the}} wetland habitat include kingfishers and bank swallows. Finally {{there is an}} {{abundance}} of bird life around the wetland marshes. Many species of ducks make their summer homes in these waters and Canada geese nest in the more remote marshes. Blackbirds, marsh wrens and black terns nest in the reeds. Franklin gulls nest in the marsh vegetation, but range over agricultural fields for grasshoppers, crickets, and mice. Shore birds include: <b>avocet,</b> piping plover, spotted sandpiper, willet, common snipe and killdeer.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Avocets</b> and stilts {{range in}} length from 30 to 46 cm and in weight from 140 to 435 g; males are usually {{slightly}} bigger than females. All possess long, thin legs, necks, and bills. The bills of <b>avocets</b> are curved upwards, and are swept {{from side to}} side when the bird is feeding in the brackish or saline wetlands they prefer. The bills of stilts, in contrast, are straight. The front toes are webbed, partially in most stilts, and fully in <b>avocets</b> and the banded stilt, which swim more. [...] The majority of species' plumage has contrasting areas of black and white, with some species having patches of buff or brown on the head or chest. [...] The sexes are similar.|$|R
