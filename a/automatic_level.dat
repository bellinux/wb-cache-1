25|$|Marc Jeannerod {{proposed}} {{that the process of}} self-recognition operates covertly and effortlessly. It depends upon a set of mechanisms involving the processing of specific neural signals, from sensory as well as from central origin. Researchers have used experimental situations, in both healthy participants and schizophrenic patients, where these signals can be dissociated from each other and where self-recognition becomes ambiguous. These situations reveal that there are two levels of self-recognition, an <b>automatic</b> <b>level</b> for action identification, and a conscious level for the sense of agency, which both rely on the same principle of congruence of the action-related signals.|$|E
2500|$|Except Noyelles station, {{equipped}} with a mechanical signaling system of the old SNCF type, there is little signalling [...] on the line, and traffic safety is ensured by instructions. A Line Manager ensures the operational use of the network and can communicate by [...] "ground-to-train" [...] radio with all trains. <b>Automatic</b> <b>level</b> crossings are installed at intersections with major roads and unguarded crossings to other crossings.|$|E

2500|$|On 6 November 2004 at 18:12 GMT, the 17:35 {{service from}} [...] to , an InterCity 125 (HST) {{led by a}} Class 43 power car (43019) {{collided}} with a stationary car at an <b>automatic</b> <b>level</b> crossing close to the rural West Berkshire village of Ufton Nervet. The inquest concluded that the crash was caused by Brian Drysdale, a chef at Wokefield Park Hotel [...] away, committing suicide by parking his car on the crossing.|$|E
2500|$|As {{shown in}} the figure, a cosine filter is used to smooth {{the rise and fall}} times of the audio {{waveform}} and eliminate key clicks. [...] All subsequent amplification of the signal must be linear to preserve the modulation waveform and ensure minimum occupied bandwidth. In practice, this means limiting the transmit audio volume to below the level where the transmitter generates [...] <b>Automatic</b> <b>Level</b> Control (ALC) feedback and disabling any audio compression or speech processing.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Automatic</b> <b>level</b> {{crossings}} in Belgium {{have two}} red lights, a [...] "moon-white" [...] light, electronic (previously mechanical) bells and (usually) barriers. The white light flashes {{for half a}} second at regular intervals to inform drivers and pedestrians that they can cross the level crossing, and that the signal is in working order. In some cases the white light is absent; the Belgian traffic law of 1975 does not cover that situation. The bells ring until the barriers are fully lowered and then stop. If barriers are absent the bell continues ringing throughout.|$|E
50|$|Some {{vehicles}} use torsion bars {{to provide}} <b>automatic</b> <b>levelling,</b> using a motor to pre-stress the bars to provide greater resistance to load and, {{in some cases}} (depending on {{the speed with which}} the motors can act), to respond to changes in road conditions. Height adjustable suspension has been used to implement a wheel-change mode where the vehicle is raised on three wheels so that the remaining wheel is lifted off the ground without the aid of a jack.|$|R
50|$|<b>Automatic</b> <b>levels</b> {{make use}} of a {{compensator}} that ensures that the line of sight remains horizontal once the operator has roughly leveled the instrument (to within maybe 0.05 degree). The surveyor sets the instrument up quickly and doesn't have to relevel it carefully each time he sights on a rod on another point. It also reduces the effect of minor settling of the tripod to the actual amount of motion instead of leveraging the tilt over the sight distance. Three level screws are used to level the instrument.|$|R

50|$|The closed station {{buildings}} survive (next to an <b>automatic</b> half-barrier <b>level</b> crossing) {{and are now}} occupied. They {{are passed}} by trains on the single track Aberdeen to Inverness Line. Remains of a platform can also be seen.|$|R
50|$|Finally, {{consider}} {{errors of}} the same 5% in the equipment itself, that is, an error of 5% {{in the setting of}} the range angle, or a similar 5% error in the levelling of the aircraft or bombsight. For simplicity, consider that 5% to be a 5 degree angle. Using simple trigonometry, 5 degrees at 20,000 feet is approximately 1,750 feet, an error that would place the bombs far outside their lethal radius. In tests, accuracies of 3 to 4 degrees were considered standard, and angles as high as 15 degrees were not uncommon. Given the seriousness of the problem, systems for <b>automatic</b> <b>levelling</b> of bombsights was a major area of study before World War II, especially in the US.|$|R

500|$|Castellon {{said that}} he did not want the SSL's {{internal}} automation to interfere with his blending of the music, instead used Pro Tools, with <b>automatic</b> <b>levels.</b> According to him, he [...] "then ran everything through the SSL, on which [...] did EQ, compression and panning." [...] The mixing of the track was made at The Hit Factory studio, in Miami on a 96-channel SSL J-series desk. Considering the quantity of recorded backing tracks, Castellon's challenge was to make sure that the music did not overpower the vocals. He accomplished this by first mixing the vocals, then adding the music and the drums, which was an unusual method for him. Minimal digital plug-ins were employed for the mix as Castellon preferred the sound of outboard gear.|$|R

40|$|A {{computer-assisted}} teleoperator {{control system}} for making comparative performance evaluations is described. A local and {{a remote control}} station, each with decision-making capability, {{communicate with each other}} through a simulated time delay. Supervisory control at three increasingly <b>automatic</b> <b>levels</b> is possible. The highest level of programmed control is facilitated through the ARM language which was developed to permit easily readable program manuscripts to be written and assembled into programs of motions by novice programmers. Experimental results show the advantage of this form of supervisory control with both direct and delayed (3 sec) manipulation tasks. In addition, two systems to measure and reproduce force distributions have been designed. One system reproduces contact on the external surfaces of the remote hand using 21 airjet simulators. Another system reproduces the shape of the contact between object and jaws using 288 piezoelectric (bimorph) stimulators...|$|R
