50|$|The non-German troops thus {{comprised}} a {{wide range}} of ethnicities, ranging from the mainly Turkic peoples in the Ostlegionen to the Muslim Slavs in the 13th Waffen Mountain Division of the SS Handschar and the Indians of the Indische Legion (the Indian National Army fought <b>against</b> the <b>British</b> on the Japanese side). For the majority of volunteers from Muslim communities, their <b>animosity</b> <b>against</b> the Soviets stemmed from their anti-Russian feelings, religious impulses (their disdain for Soviet atheism for example), coupled by the negative experience of Stalin's policies on nationality, and by the corresponding disruption to their way of life.|$|R

6000|$|... "He {{will not}} see me, because {{he will have to}} yield when he hears what I have to say for myself. He knows that, and would {{therefore}} fain keep away from me. Why should he be stirred to this <b>animosity</b> <b>against</b> me?" ...|$|R
25|$|Jean de Sismondi {{suggests}} that Muhammad had a specific <b>animosity</b> <b>against</b> Jews, {{because of the}} few differences that separated two mostly similar cults.

50|$|Clotworthy {{in no way}} abated his old <b>animosity</b> <b>against</b> Papists and High Anglicans and {{championed the}} cause of the Irish Presbyterians.

5000|$|Neumann {{warns against}} {{the dangers of}} abusing the charge of {{antisemitism}} to deflect any criticism of Israeli government policies. Strategies that attempt to conflate a political and humanistic critique of Israel's policies towards the Palestinian people with the vice of antisemitic prejudice devalue a potent term that should be reserved for those who show real <b>animosity</b> <b>against</b> Jews, as a group and as individuals, wherever they live: ...|$|R
5000|$|Political and {{religious}} <b>animosity</b> <b>against</b> the Witnesses has occasionally led to mob action and government oppression.

50|$|In {{the summer}} of 1943, Adams was invited by his friend, newly {{appointed}} camp director Ralph Merritt, to photograph life at the camp.

5000|$|On May 1, 1901, 350 union miners {{walked off}} their {{jobs at the}} Smuggler-Union mine in Telluride.

The strike was settled, but in some quarters <b>animosity</b> <b>against</b> union leaders continued.|$|R

They burned and destroyed the whole.|$|R
