5|$|I {{will always}} think of Mussolini {{as one of the}} oddest {{characters}} in history, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>will</b> remember him as I last saw him in the great white and gold foyer of the Grand Hotel, under a huge crystal candelabra slouching wearily into a graceful Louis XV ivory and enameled chair.|$|E
5|$|I said, 'Mr. Malcolm, {{could you}} tell me {{something}} about your mother?' <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>will</b> never, ever forget how he stopped almost as if he was suspended like a marionette. And he said, 'I remember the kind of dresses she used to wear. They were old and faded and gray.' And then he walked some more. And he said, 'I remember how she was always bent over the stove, trying to stretch what little we had.' And that was the beginning, that night, of his walk. And he walked that floor until just about daybreak.|$|E

6000|$|... "Well, {{you shall}} {{pay for that}} also," [...] said Mr. Sprigg; [...] "for it belonged to me, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>'ll</b> have the money or <b>I</b> <b>'ll</b> put you in jail!" ...|$|R

5|$|Jerry {{knows what}} the {{situation}} is. I think he's done very well for us, considering we plucked him out of non-league football at Yeovil. But he is aware that I {{have been looking for}} a right-back <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>will</b> continue looking for one. That doesn't mean I don't appreciate what Jerry has done for me since I signed him three-and-a-half years ago. There isn't a more reliable player at the club than Jerry Gill. He captains my reserve team, his fitness is of a very high standard and he has endless enthusiasm. When I put him in the first team, he never lets me down. I value Jerry's professionalism and for as long as I remain manager of Birmingham, {{there will always be a}} place for him here.|$|E

25|$|I am an AmeriCorps member, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>will</b> {{get things}} done.|$|E
6000|$|... "I 'll come every evening, then. <b>I</b> <b>'d</b> like to, for I {{have n't}} studied a bit since I came. You shall {{try and make}} me like algebra, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>'ll</b> try <b>and</b> make you like Latin, will you?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You are an angel, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>'ll</b> {{never be}} so rude again," [...] she added, as Polly's arm came round her, {{and half the}} seat was gladly offered.|$|R
6000|$|... "Capital, Tom; you 'll be an orator yet. Learn {{another piece}} like that, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>'ll</b> come <b>and</b> hear you speak it. Are {{you ready for}} your velocipede, hey?" ...|$|R
25|$|<b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>will</b> execute great vengeance {{upon them}} with furious rebukes; and they shall know that I am the LORD, when I shall lay my vengeance upon them.|$|E

25|$|I've {{studied the}} ideas of Confucius, Buddha, and Jesus; I respect them as saints, but even if there's a heaven made by them, it's not a nation created by our nation, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>will</b> never take our nation there.|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{just sit}} still, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>'ll</b> get you {{home in a}} jiffy;" [...] and before she could unpack herself, Tom trotted off with her at a fine pace.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, {{of course}} I can shoot another," [...] said the little man, proudly; [...] "you make {{a fire and}} get the pot boiling, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>'ll</b> go for another duck." ...|$|R

25|$|Today I have {{withdrawn}} my {{candidacy for}} President of the United States. I {{hope that my}} country and my party have benefited from our having made this effort. Jeri <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>will</b> always be grateful for the encouragement and friendship of so many wonderful people.|$|E
25|$|Plant the black, red, gold banner at {{the summit}} of the German idea, make it the {{standard}} of free mankind, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>will</b> shed my dear heart's blood for it. Rest assured, I love the Fatherland just as much as you do.|$|E
25|$|I {{will say}} {{publicly}} anywhere, {{if it is}} a bad law that doesn't nurture good, that doesn't look after the interests of ordinary people in this nation I will oppose the law <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>will</b> influence other people to oppose the law...if that means breaking the law I will do it.|$|E
6000|$|... "You just {{perch on}} that cracker-keg, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>'ll</b> {{see that you}} get enough," [...] said Tom, putting a {{dumbwaiter}} before her, and issuing his orders with a fine air of authority.|$|R
6000|$|... "Now, Tom, don't be savage. I {{only want}} to keep you out of a scrape, for Fan will be raging if you go. Take off her things, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>'ll</b> give up." ...|$|R

25|$|In Sir Walter Scott's 'Heart Of Midlothian' {{he has the}} Duke of Argyll saying ``the Dunlop is {{the very}} cheese of which I am so fond, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>will</b> take it as the {{greatest}} favour you can do me to send one to Caroline Park. But remember, be on honour with it, Jeanie, and make it all yourself, for I am a real good judge.|$|E
25|$|And let {{it come to}} pass, {{that the}} damsel to whom I shall say, Let down thy pitcher, I pray thee, that I may drink; and she shall say, Drink, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>will</b> give thy camels drink also: let the same be she that thou hast {{appointed}} for thy servant Isaac; and thereby shall I know that thou hast shewed kindness unto my master.|$|E
25|$|I {{wanted to}} do {{something}} refreshing and different, so I mixed genres and drew inspiration from touring, traveling, watching rock bands, and attending festivals… I was like a mad scientist, putting lots of different songs together. Boyz II Men were the first ones to put Destiny's Child on tour. They showed us how to treat an opening act <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>will</b> never forget that. That was 15 years ago! Wow, 15 years! I'm old.|$|E
6000|$|... "And {{reading my}} journal, and {{laughing}} at my presents, and then putting {{the blame on}} Maud. It 's the meanest thing <b>I</b> ever saw; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>'ll</b> never forgive you as long as I live!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I think <b>I</b> <b>'ll</b> take my supper {{down to the}} brook," [...] he said to himself, [...] "and sit {{upon the}} grassy bank while <b>I</b> eat it. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>'ll</b> take my fiddle, too, and play upon it {{to pass the time}} until father and mother come home." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "A fine, {{practicable}} mind," [...] {{said the}} doctor; [...] "cuts clean <b>and</b> sharp. <b>I</b> <b>will</b> bring the cushions and the whip, {{if they have}} not been stolen before <b>I</b> reach them. <b>And</b> now <b>I</b> <b>will</b> go to the barn and get my horse. We need not disturb the industrious Mike." ...|$|R
25|$|I further swear...to {{faithfully}} perform my duty {{toward this}} company by directing my best efforts, {{in every way}} possible, {{to the production of}} logs and lumber for the construction of Army airplanes and ships to be used against our common enemies.

25|$|The path of {{the righteous}} man is beset on all sides by the inequities of the selfish and the tyranny of evil men. Blessed is he who {{in the name of}} charity and {{goodwill}} shepherds the weak through the valley of darkness, for he is truly his brother's keeper and the finder of lost children. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>will</b> strike down upon thee with great vengeance and furious anger those who attempt to poison and destroy my brothers. And you will know my name is the Lord when I lay my vengeance upon thee.|$|E
25|$|Wainwright's first {{release was}} an album-length {{independent}} cassette of ten tracks, Ground Floor, in 1997. This was followed in 1999 by her first EP, released under Querbes Service in 1999; {{two of its}} songs would later appear on her debut album (2005). Wainwright released two EPs in 2005—Bloody Mother Fucking Asshole <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>Will</b> Internalize—both of which contained some tracks that also appeared on her self-titled studio album. The EP iTunes Live from Montreal was released digitally in December 2008 in Canada, and contained six live tracks from her second album, I Know You're Married But I've Got Feelings Too.|$|E

6000|$|... "I say, Polly, won't {{you give}} {{some of us}} fellows music lessons? Somebody wants me to play, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>'d</b> rather learn of you than any Senor Twankydillo," [...] said Tom, who {{did n't find the}} {{conversation}} interesting.|$|R
