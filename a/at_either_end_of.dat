5|$|The older {{part of the}} brick-built hall {{consists}} of seven bays, over two floors. There are projecting bays <b>at</b> <b>either</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the building, dressed with ashlar quoins. A central doorway is flanked with plain pilasters, also of ashlar. The roof is of a hipped design, with a central octagonal bellcote, topped by a small dome.|$|E
5|$|Representations of the Virgin and John the Evangelist flank Christ {{in small}} {{rectangular}} panels <b>at</b> <b>either</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> his outstretched arms. Both are dark-skinned, and bear agonised and sorrowful expressions as they rest their heads {{on their hands}} and face inwards towards Christ. In keeping with the Franciscan idea, the gilding surrounding the mourning saints is kept to a minimum. The size and positions of the figures are reduced compared to usual Byzantine iconography to maintain sole focus on the passion of Christ.|$|E
5|$|The {{building}} was substantially altered in 1835 by architect Sydney Smirke. In {{order to provide}} more space, he added blocks <b>at</b> <b>either</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the frontage, and galleried wings {{on either side of}} the central portion. He also added a small single-storey lodge, still in existence, at the Lambeth Road gate. Later, between 1844–46, the central cupola was replaced with a copper-clad dome in order to expand the chapel beneath. The building also featured a theatre in a building to the rear of the site.|$|E

5|$|Casualties were {{heaviest}} {{among the}} troops landing <b>at</b> <b>either</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> Omaha. In the east at Fox Green and the adjacent stretch of Easy Red, scattered elements of three companies {{were reduced to}} half strength {{by the time they}} gained the relative safety of the shingle, many of them having crawled the 300 yards (270m) of beach just ahead of the incoming tide. Within 15 minutes of landing at Dog Green on the western end of the beach, A/116 had been cut to pieces, the leaders among the 120 or so casualties, the survivors reduced to seeking cover at the water's edge or behind obstacles. The smaller Ranger company to their right had fared a little better, having made the shelter of the bluffs, but were also down to half strength.|$|E
5|$|Due to its nature, {{the episode}} {{featured}} many dangerous stunts utilizing fire. In {{the scene where}} Mulder and L'Ively confront each other <b>at</b> <b>either</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> a corridor in the Marsden family home, and L'Ively sets fire to the entire hallway, Mark Sheppard, who played L'Ively, ducked out of the shot {{in order to protect}} himself from the intense heat. The only injury involved in the production was when David Duchovny burned his hand, leaving a small permanent scar. The character of Phoebe Green was considered as a recurring role, but this episode ended up being her only appearance.|$|E
5|$|Each {{platform}} has two same-level fare control areas, one <b>at</b> <b>either</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the station, {{and there}} are no crossovers or crossunders.

The ones on the Manhattan-bound platform go up to the northeast and southeast corners of Bergen and Smith Streets while those on the Coney Island-bound platform go up to the northwest and southwest corners. The fare control areas on {{the south end of the}} platforms are unstaffed, containing full height turnstiles and one street stair to the northeast corner of Warren and Smith Streets on the Manhattan-bound platform and the northwest corner for the Coney Island-bound platform. The south fare control area is more heavily used.|$|E

5|$|Mir was {{authorized}} on a 17 February 1976 decree, to design an improved {{model of the}} Salyut DOS-17K space stations. Four Salyut space stations had been launched since 1971, with three more being launched during Mirs development. It was planned that the station's core module (DOS-7 and the backup DOS-8) would be equipped {{with a total of}} four docking ports; two <b>at</b> <b>either</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the station as with the Salyut stations, and an additional two ports on either side of a docking sphere {{at the front of the}} station to enable further modules to expand the station's capabilities. By August 1978, this had evolved to the final configuration of one aft port and five ports in a spherical compartment at the forward end of the station.|$|E
5|$|The castle's {{original}} appearance {{differed significantly}} {{from that of}} today. The arrow-shaped Water Bastion facing into the Medway and the main block behind it {{were part of the}} original design. There were also towers <b>at</b> <b>either</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the water frontage, though these were subsequently replaced by towers of a different design. The gatehouse and moat were later additions. A number of derelict buildings in Rochester Castle, Aylesford, and Bopley were pulled down to provide stone for the castle. The main structure had been completed by 1564, but it took another three years and an infusion of extra funds to finish the project. The total cost came to £4,349.|$|E
5|$|Each driver {{cell in the}} LIFE {{baseline}} design contained two of the high-density diode arrays {{arranged on}} either side of a large slab of laser glass. The arrays were provided cooling via hook-up pipes <b>at</b> <b>either</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the module. The initial laser pulse was provided by a preamplifier module similar to the one from the NIF, the output of which was switched into the main beamline via a mirror and Pockel's cell optical switch. To maximize the energy deposited into the beam from the laser glass, optical switches were used to send the beam to mirrors to reflect the light through the glass four times, in a fashion similar to NIF. Finally, focussing and optical cleanup was provided by optics {{on either side of}} the glass, before the beam exited the system through a frequency converter at one end.|$|E

25|$|As {{in many of}} the {{surviving}} Byzantine churches of Istanbul, the four columns which supported the crossing were replaced by piers, and the colonnades <b>at</b> <b>either</b> <b>ends</b> <b>of</b> the crossarms were filled in.

25|$|Avian lungs do {{not have}} alveoli as {{mammalian}} lungs do. Instead they contain millions of narrow passages known as parabronchi, connecting the dorsobronchi to the ventrobronchi <b>at</b> <b>either</b> <b>ends</b> <b>of</b> the lungs. Air flows anteriorly (caudal to cranial) through the parallel parabronchi. These parabronchi have honeycombed walls. The cells of the honeycomb are dead-end air vesicles, called atria, which project radially from the parabronchi. The atria are the site of gas exchange by simple diffusion. The blood flow around the parabronchi (and their atria), forms a cross-current gas exchanger (see diagram on the left).|$|R
5|$|In October 1963, London Transport ordered five {{double decker}} buses {{based on the}} Ford Thames Trader chassis for special duties, taking cyclists through the Dartford Tunnel. These had a lower deck {{purpose-built}} for carrying bicycles, with upper deck seats for cyclists. Access was via a stairwell to the upper deck starting several feet above {{the level of the}} road, accessible from special platforms built <b>at</b> <b>either</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the tunnel; there was also a ladder built {{into the side of the}} bodywork for access elsewhere. The design was criticised for failing to protect any passenger from falling off the vehicle, and running costs were estimated at £2,550 per month, with only £45 revenue. The service was reduced to one bus in April 1964 and then cancelled in 1965, to be replaced by the current transfer service. One of these buses has been preserved.|$|E
5|$|Opposite the Sir Alex Ferguson Stand is the Sir Bobby Charlton Stand, {{formerly}} Old Trafford's {{main stand}} and previously {{known as the}} South Stand.

The television gantry is also in the Sir Bobby Charlton Stand, so the Sir Bobby Charlton Stand is the one that gets shown on television least often. Television studios are located <b>at</b> <b>either</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the Sir Bobby Charlton Stand, with the club's in-house television station, MUTV, in the East studio and other television stations, such as the BBC and Sky, in the West studio.|$|E
5|$|Refrigerated {{ships were}} also made {{possible}} {{through the ice}} trade, allowing perishable goods to be exported internationally, first from the U.S. and then from countries such as Argentina and Australia. Early ships had stored their chilled goods along with the main cargo of ice; the first ships to transport chilled meat to Britain, designed by Bate, adapted the railroad refrigerator cars, using ice <b>at</b> <b>either</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the hold and a ventilation fan to keep the meat cool. An improved version, invented by James Craven, piped a brine solution through the ice and then the hold to keep the meat cool, and created a drier atmosphere in the hold, preserving the meat better. Natural ice was also used in fishing industries to preserve catches, initially in the eastern American fisheries. In 1858 the Grimsby fishing fleet began to take ice out to sea with them to preserve their catches; this allowed longer journeys and bigger catches, and the fishing industry became the biggest single user of ice in Britain.|$|E

5|$|The Bow Back Rivers cross an area {{originally}} {{known as}} Stratford Marsh, {{an area of}} common Lammas land, where inhabitants had common rights to graze horses and cattle between Lammas Day (1 August) and Lady Day (25 March), but which was used for growing hay {{for the rest of}} the year. The Marsh was between Stratford-Langthorne and Stratford-at-Bow. Little remains from pre-history, but the names suggest that the two settlements lay <b>at</b> <b>either</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> a stone causeway across the marsh. Remains of a stone causeway have been found, but no traces of an associated road. The ford at Old Ford is of pre-Roman origin, part of a route from London to Essex which crossed Bethnal Green. In the Roman era, a new road was built from London to the ford, which carried the principal road to Colchester. There may also have been a ford further south at Bow, and a further causeway existed between Homerton and Leyton, known as Wanstead Slip.|$|E
5|$|The {{gatehouse}} in {{the centre}} of the south curtain wall mostly dates from the 13thcentury. It was originally accessed via a drawbridge and visitors had to pass through two gates, one <b>at</b> <b>either</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the passage, and a portcullis. The semi-octagonal projections {{on either side of the}} gate passage are considered ornamental. Between the projections and above the gate were machicolations, openings for missiles to be hurled at attackers. The rooms on either side of the passage were guardrooms. The only remaining openings on the front are slits at ground level. Slits on the other sides of the gatehouse, and along the entrance passage, allowed the gatekeeper to watch people approaching and entering the castle. The structure underwent later alterations in the 19th and 20thcenturies when it housed the castle's custodian; slits in the gatehouse's front may have been filled in.|$|E
5|$|The plan of {{the house}} is unusual, partly because of its {{incorporation}} of the earlier building; it extends at right angles to the primary (southern) façade.

Bramshill House is three storeys high on the southern main entrance side and two storeys high to the north and east. There are three vaulted cellars to the west. The house is built of red brick laid in English bond dressed with stone, with ashlar quoining at the corners of the wings. Stone dressings are featured on numerous large mullion windows. An open carved parapet surmounts the building. The roof consists of red tiles, and there are large gables on the west side. The chimney stacks are rectangular.|$|E
