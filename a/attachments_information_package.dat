Thus for English and Dutch {{it can be argued}} that, roughly speaking, <b>information</b> <b>packaging</b> is structurally realized by means of alternative intonational contours of identical strings.

Whereas English and many Germanic languages primarily exploit intonation for informational purposes, in other languages, like Catalan, syntax plays the primary role in the realisation of <b>information</b> <b>packaging</b> and intonation is reduced to a secondary role.

The framework is tested on a corpus of 111 telephone conversations recorded at the information service of Schiphol.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} the extent to which a new patient <b>information</b> <b>package</b> (NPIP) or a mini version of the same package (mini-NPIP) reduces emotional distress and meets the informational needs of patients arriving at a tertiary cancer centre for the first time. A comprehensive package, NPIP, consisting of procedural information regarding cancer centre location, description of the health care team, treatment services, research, educational activities, accommodation and community services provided at the centre; and a condensed version of the same package, mini-NPIP, were developed. Consecutive patients with newly diagnosed breast, gynaecological, lung and prostate cancer, referred to the centre for the first time were prerandomised to receive NPIP, mini-NPIP or no <b>information</b> <b>package.</b> Patients randomised to NPIP or mini-NPIP were mailed the <b>information</b> <b>package</b> at least one week before their first appointment. On arrival at the centre, patients were administered the Brief Symptom Inventory (BSI) which measures psychological distress, and interviewed regarding preferences for information and acceptability of the <b>information</b> <b>packages.</b> Of 465 randomised patients, 161 were excluded post-randomisation and 304 completed the entire interview: 100 were randomised to the NPIP, 102 to the mini-NPIP and 102 to the control group. Emotional distress as measured by the BSI was similar for all groups (P = 0. 98). Most patients preferred to receive the information (98 %), receive it before the first appointment (84 %) and by mail (79 %). These preferences were more evident for those given the <b>information</b> <b>packages.</b> The majority of patients found the <b>information</b> <b>packages</b> easy to understand (88 %) and useful (89 %), and no differences were detected between packages. The cost of production and dissemination of NPIP was more than double the cost for mini-NPIP: $ 8. 93 vs $ 3. 98 (Canadian dollars) per patient. For patients presenting to a cancer centre for the first time, <b>packages</b> of procedural <b>information</b> do not appear to reduce psychological distress, but are preferred by patients. Given the cost of producing NPIP, mini-NPIP is the preferred approach...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{results of}} two corpus studies of <b>information</b> <b>packaging</b> of discourse referents in German {{dedicated to the}} following questions: • Do sentence-initial position, pronominalization and subject role assignment reflect a single un-derlying dimension of discourse salience or multiple dimensions? • If there are multiple dimensions of salience, {{is it possible to}} associate them with a forward-looking and a backward-looking perspective on discourse, as proposed, e. g., in the context of Centering (Grosz et al., 1995) ? This paper presents empirical findings from TüBa-D/Z, a corpus of German newspaper articles, that provide evidence against a unidimensional model of discourse salience, and support the claim that (at least) two dimensions of salience are to be distinguished and that these dimensions are associated with different temporal orientations on discourse. 1 Salience and <b>Information</b> <b>Packaging</b> In the last 30 years, the notion of “salience ” has been employed in many accounts for the <b>information</b> <b>packaging</b> of discourse referents, especially with respect to the choic...|$|R
