5000|$|The medieval Latin form, {{from which}} the modern {{languages}} and late Byzantine Greek take their names for antimony, is antimonium. The origin of this is uncertain; all suggestions have some difficulty either of form or interpretation. The popular etymology, from ἀντίμοναχός anti-monachos or French <b>antimoine,</b> still has adherents; this would mean [...] "monk-killer", and is explained by many early alchemists being monks, and antimony being poisonous.|$|E
