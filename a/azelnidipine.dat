A series of research has demonstrated that <b>azelnidipine</b> produced an effective antihypertensive effect in patients with essential hypertension. Now it is need to summarize clinical use of <b>azelnidipine</b> in the treatment of hypertension in Chinese patients. Methods: Relevant literature was identified by performing searches in PubMed and CNKI (China National Knowledge Infrastructure), covering the period from January 2003 (the year <b>azelnidipine</b> was launched) to July 2014. We included studies that described pharmacology of azelnidipine, especially the pharmacokinetics, clinical efficacy, and safety and tolerability of <b>azelnidipine</b> in a Chinese population. The full text of each article was strictly reviewed, and data interpretation was performed. Results: In Chinese healthy volunteers, a single-dose oral administration of <b>azelnidipine</b> 8 – 16 mg had a peak plasma concentration of 1. 66 – 23. 06 ng/mL and time to peak plasma concentration was 2. 6 – 4. 0 hours and the area under the plasma concentration versus time curve from time 0 hour to 96 hours was 17. 9 – 429 ng/mL·h and elimination half-life was 16. 0 – 28. 0 hours. A number of clinical trials have demonstrated that <b>azelnidipine</b> produced a significant reduction in blood pressure in Chinese patients with mild-to-moderate hypertension, which was similar to that of other effective antihypertensive drugs such as amlodipine, zofenopril, and nifedipine. In addition to its antihypertensive effect, <b>azelnidipine</b> had other cardiovascular protective effects as well, like anti-oxidative action, decreasing heart rate, and improving systolic and diastolic function. <b>Azelnidipine</b> was generally well tolerated in Chinese patients and no severe adverse events were observed. Conclusion: <b>Azelnidipine</b> is effective and safe in the treatment of hypertension in Chinese patients.

40|$|SummaryBackgroundWe have {{reported}} that α and β adrenergic blockers could protect against emotional stress-induced cardiac dysfunction. <b>Azelnidipine</b> is a unique calcium blocker which does not increase heart rate. The {{purpose of this study}} is to evaluate the effect of <b>azelnidipine</b> to prevent stress-induced cardiac dysfunction. Methods and resultsRats premedicated with <b>azelnidipine</b> (0. 3 mg/kg), labetalol (3 mg/kg), or vehicle, were restrained for 30 min (immobilization stress: IMO) to reproduce emotional stress, and anesthetized to release stress. We measured the fractional area change (FAC) by echocardiography, blood pressure, and heart rate at the end of IMO and every 10 min for 60 min after IMO. During IMO, FAC in the labetalol group was significantly lower than that in the other two groups. At 20 min after IMO, FAC in the <b>azelnidipine</b> or labetalol group was significantly higher than that in the vehicle group (86 ± 9 %, 73 ± 5 % vs. 56 ± 11 %, p< 0. 05). During IMO, mean blood pressure in the <b>azelnidipine</b> or labetalol group was significantly lower than that in the vehicle group (107 ± 5 mmHg, 106 ± 17 mmHg vs. 124 ± 5 mmHg, p< 0. 05). ConclusionAcute administration of <b>azelnidipine</b> could prevent a sudden drop of cardiac function after acute stress like IMO. <b>Azelnidipine</b> might have a protective effect on stress-induced cardiac dysfunction like α and β adrenergic blockers...|$|E

40|$|SummaryBackgroundThe {{present study}} was {{conducted}} to clarify whether <b>azelnidipine</b> might have beneficial effects on autonomic functions, and whether such beneficial effects might affect the vascular functions (i. e., arterial stiffness and endothelial function). Methods and resultsThis study with a cross-over design was conducted in 21 hypertensive patients (65 ± 9 years old) being treated with calcium channel blockers (CCBs) other than <b>azelnidipine</b> or benidipine (i. e., during the study period, the CCB was switched to either <b>azelnidipine</b> 16 mg/day or benidipine 4 mg/day, administered alternately for 8 weeks each). Blood examinations were conducted and the heart rate variability, baro-receptor sensitivity (BRS), brachial-ankle pulse wave velocity (baPWV) and flow-mediated vasodilatation (FMD) in the brachial artery were measured after treatment with each of the two drugs. While the blood pressure levels decreased to a similar degree after both treatments, the BRS (8. 8 ± 5. 5 ms/mmHg vs. 6. 4 ± 2. 9 ms/mmHg, p< 0. 01) and high-frequency power component (HF: 139 ± 152 ms 2 /Hz vs. 88 ± 97 ms 2 /Hz) were higher after treatment with <b>azelnidipine</b> than after treatment with benidipine (p< 0. 05). However, the baPWV, FMD and plasma levels of malonyldialdehyde low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and nitric oxides were similar after treatment with both drugs. ConclusionAzelnidipine has greater beneficial effects on the autonomic functions than benidipine although the degree of reduction of blood pressure induced by the two drugs was similar. However, this greater beneficial effect of <b>azelnidipine</b> on the autonomic functions did not produce any distinguishable differences in effects of <b>azelnidipine</b> and benidipine on the arterial stiffness and endothelial functions...|$|E
40|$|This study {{compared}} the efficacy {{and safety of}} <b>azelnidipine</b> with that of trichlormethiazide in Japanese type 2 diabetic patients with hypertension. In a multicenter, open-label trial, 240 patients with adequately controlled diabetes (HbA 1 c ≤ 7. 0 %) under lifestyle modification and/or administration of hypoglycemic agents and inadequately controlled hypertension (systolic blood pressure [sBP] ≥ 130 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure [dBP] ≥ 80 mmHg) who were being treated with olmesartan were enrolled. Participants {{were randomly assigned to}} an <b>azelnidipine</b> group or a trichlormethiazide group and were followed up for 48 weeks. Main outcome measure was the difference in the change in HbA 1 c levels from the baseline values at 48 weeks between these two groups. Of the 240 subjects that were enrolled, 209 subjects (<b>azelnidipine</b> group: 103 patients, trichlormethiazide group: 106 patients) completed this trial. At 48 weeks, the following changes were observed in the <b>azelnidipine</b> and trichlormethiazide groups, respectively: HbA 1 c levels, 0. 19 ± 0. 52 % and 0. 19 ± 0. 54 %; sBP/dBP, - 10. 7 ± 9. 6 /- 6. 6 ± 6. 6 mmHg and - 7. 1 ± 7. 7 /- 3. 3 ± 6. 1 mmHg (P < 0. 001 for both sBP and dBP). In both groups, dizziness (12 patients [11. 7 %] and 16 patients [15. 1 %]) and edema (16 patients [15. 5 %] and 7 patients [6. 6 %], P = 0. 047) were observed during the 48 -week follow-up period. <b>Azelnidipine</b> was more effective for controlling blood pressure than trichlormethiazide in Japanese type 2 diabetes patients, whereas trichlormethiazide was more effective for reducing albuminuria than <b>azelnidipine.</b> Both of these agents, however, similarly exacerbated glycemic control in type 2 diabetic patients with hypertension.

40|$|Abstract Background Hypertension is {{associated}} with impaired glucose tolerance and insulin resistance. Medical treatment that interferes with various steps in the renin-angiotensin system improves glucose tolerance and insulin resistance. However, it remains unclear if long-acting calcium channel blockers (CCBs) such as <b>azelnidipine</b> and amlodipine affect glucose tolerance and insulin resistance in clinical practice. Methods Seventeen non-diabetic patients with essential hypertension who had controlled blood pressure levels using amlodipine (5 mg/day) were enrolled in this study. After randomization, either <b>azelnidipine</b> (16 mg/day) or amlodipine (5 mg/day) was administered in a crossover design for 12 -weeks. At baseline {{and the end of}} each CCB therapy, samples of blood and urine were collected and 75 g oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) was performed. In addition, hematopoietic progenitor cells (HPCs) were measured at each point by flow cytometry and endothelial functions were measured by fingertip pulse amplitude tonometry using EndoPAT. Results Although blood pressure levels were identical after each CCB treatment, the heart rate significantly decreased after <b>azelnidipine</b> administration than that after amlodipine administration (P P P = 0. 067) and interleukin- 6 (P = 0. 035) were decreased. Although endothelial functions were not different between the two medication groups, the number of circulating HPCs was significantly increased after <b>azelnidipine</b> administration (P = 0. 016). Conclusions These results suggest that <b>azelnidipine</b> treatment may have beneficial effects on glucose tolerance, insulin sensitivity, the inflammatory state, and number of circulating progenitor cells in non-diabetic patients with essential hypertension. </p...|$|E
40|$|The {{combination}} therapy of an angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) with a {{calcium channel blocker}} (CCB) or with a diuretic is favorably recommended {{for the treatment of}} hypertension. However, the difference between these two combination therapies is unclear. The present work was undertaken to examine the possible difference between the two combination therapies in vascular protection. Salt-loaded stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRSP) were divided into 6 groups, and they were orally administered (1) vehicle, (2) olmesartan, an ARB, (3) <b>azelnidipine,</b> a CCB, (4) hydrochlorothiazide, a diuretic, (5) olmesartan combined with <b>azelnidipine,</b> or (6) olmesartan combined with hydrochlorothiazide. Olmesartan combined with either <b>azelnidipine</b> or hydrochlorothiazide ameliorated vascular endothelial dysfunction and remodeling in SHRSP more than did monotherapy with either agent. However, despite a comparable blood pressure lowering effect between the two treatments, <b>azelnidipine</b> enhanced the amelioration of vascular endothelial dysfunction and remodeling by olmesartan {{to a greater extent than}} did hydrochlorothiazide in salt-loaded SHRSP. The increased enhancement by <b>azelnidipine</b> of olmesartan-induced vascular protection than by hydrochlorothiazide was associated with a greater amelioration of vascular nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase activation, superoxide, mitogen-activated protein kinase activation, and with a greater activation of the Akt/endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) pathway. These results provided the first evidence that a CCB potentiates the vascular protective effects of an ARB in salt-sensitive hypertension, compared with a diuretic, and provided a novel rationale explaining the benefit of the {{combination therapy}} with an ARB and a CCB...|$|E
40|$|BackgroundAlthough {{systemic}} hypertension {{is closely}} associated with aortic aneurysm (AA) formation, there are many patients with AA without hypertension. In these patients, an inflammation-mediated progression of aneurysmal disease is likely responsible for AA growth and eventual rupture. Unfortunately, there remains no reproducible and durable small animal model of aortic aneurysmal disease, the development of which would enable {{the investigation of the}} pathophysiology of this vexing condition. The first aim was to establish a useful wild-type mouse model of AA with low mortality. The second aim was to use this model to assess the protective effect of <b>azelnidipine,</b> a new calcium channel blocker, against the progression of the AA independent of its antihypertensive effect. MethodsAngiotensin II and β-aminopropionitrile (a lysyl oxidase inhibitor) were administrated subcutaneously in 7 -week-old C 57 BL/ 6 J mice using an osmotic minipump for 4 weeks to generate a wild-type mouse model of AA. Concurrently, <b>azelnidipine</b> (a calcium channel blocker) or a placebo was administrated orally for 4 weeks. Mice were humanely killed and assessed {{at the end of the}} 4 weeks of pharmacologic manipulation. ResultsThe combined infusion of angiotensin II and β-aminopropionitrile induced degenerative aneurysm of the thoracic and/or abdominal aorta (11 / 12; 92 %). The majority of aneurysms were located in the distal aortic arch and suprarenal abdominal aorta. Although there was no difference in systolic blood pressure between the control and azelnidipine-treated groups, <b>azelnidipine</b> significantly reduced the incidence of AA (2 / 11; 18 %). <b>Azelnidipine</b> treatment reduced the pathologic findings normally associated with aneurysm formation within the aortic wall. <b>Azelnidipine</b> also reduced the number of macrophage antigen- 3 (MAC- 3) –positive cells in the periaortic adipose tissue and reduced the gene expression levels of tumor necrosis factor-alpha and matrix metalloproteinase- 2 and - 9 within the aortic wall. ConclusionsThis study demonstrates that combined treatment with angiotensin II and β-aminopropionitrile induces degenerative AAs in wild-type mice, and <b>azelnidipine</b> prevents aneurysm progression via its anti-inflammatory effect...|$|E

40|$|Many {{patients}} undergoing continuous ambulatory {{peritoneal dialysis}} (CAPD) receive antihypertensive agents, including calcium antagonists, which produce reflex tachycardia through {{activation of the}} sympa-thetic nervous system. <b>Azelnidipine,</b> a newly devel-oped calcium antagonist, has unique characteristics in that it causes less reflex stimulation of the sympa-thetic nervous system. In the present study, we used a crossover method to compare the effects of amlodipine (5 – 10 mg daily) and <b>azelnidipine</b> (8 – 16 mg daily) on drain volume and weekly creatinine clearance in 9 CAPD patients (3 women, 6 men; mean age: 64 ± 5 years; mean duration of CAPD: 1. 8 ± 0. 6 years). Each calcium antagonist was administered for 3 months and then switched for the other. As compared with amlodipine, <b>azelnidipine</b> increased drain volume by 13 % ± 2 % (p < 0. 05) and weekly creatinine clear-ance by 12 % ± 2 % (p < 0. 05). At the same time, we observed {{no significant differences in}} blood pressure and urine volume. The increases in drain volume pro-duced by <b>azelnidipine</b> resulted from less activation of the sympathetic nervous system. We therefore suggest that activation of the sympathetic nervous system in-duced by calcium antagonists may be important in the regulation of drain volume in CAPD patients.

40|$|Acute aortic {{dissection}} is {{the most}} common life-threatening vascular disease, with sudden onset of severe pain and a high fatality rate. Clarifying the detailed mechanism for aortic dissection is of great significance for establishing effective pharmacotherapy for this high mortality disease. In the present study, we evaluated the influence of biomechanical stretch, which mimics an acute rise in blood pressure using an experimental apparatus of stretching loads in vitro, on rat aortic smooth muscle cell (RASMC) death. Then, we examined the effects of <b>azelnidipine</b> and mitogen-activated protein kinase inhibitors on mechanical stretch-induced RASMC death. The major findings of the present study are as follows: (1) cyclic mechanical stretch on RASMC caused cell death in a time-dependent manner up to 4 h; (2) cyclic mechanical stretch on RASMC induced c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and p 38 activation with peaks at 10 min; (3) <b>azelnidipine</b> inhibited RASMC death in a concentration-dependent manner as well as inhibited JNK and p 38 activation by mechanical stretch; and (4) SP 600125 (a JNK inhibitor) and SB 203580 (a p 38 inhibitor) protected against stretch-induced RASMC death; (5) Antioxidants, diphenylene iodonium and tempol failed to inhibit stretch-induced RASMC death. On the basis of the above findings, we propose a possible mechanism where an acute rise in blood pressure increases biomechanical stress on the arterial walls, which induces RASMC death, and thus, may lead to aortic dissection. <b>Azelnidipine</b> may be used as a pharmacotherapeutic agent for prevention of aortic dissection independent of its blood pressure lowering effect. 博士（医学）・乙第 1344 号・平成 26 年 12 月 3 日© 2014 Zhao et al.

Patient and methods: Patients with brachial systolic BP &ge; 140 mmHg and/or diastolic BP &ge; 90 mmHg received olmesartan monotherapy (20 mg daily) for 12 weeks. The patients were then randomly assigned to fixed-dose add-on therapy with <b>azelnidipine</b> (16 mg daily) or amlodipine (5 mg daily) (25 patients/group) for a further 24 weeks. CBP and LVMI were measured at baseline and at the end of the study. Results: Baseline characteristics were similar in both groups. The decrease in brachial BP was similar in both groups. CBP and LVMI decreased significantly in both groups (both, P &lt; 0. 001). However, the decreases in CBP and LVMI were significantly greater with olmesartan/azelnidipine than with olmesartan/amlodipine (CBP, P &lt; 0. 001; LVMI, P = 0. 002).

We investigated whether dietary salt reduction with the combination therapy of angiotensin II type 1 receptor blocker (ARB) plus calcium channel blocker (CCB) reverses renal tissue injury in Dahl salt-sensitive (DSS) hypertensive rats. DSS rats were fed a high-salt diet (HS; 4 % NaCl) for 4 weeks. Then, DSS rats were given one of the following for 10 weeks: HS diet; normal-salt diet (NS; 0. 5 % NaCl), NS + an ARB (olmesartan, 10 mg/kg/day), NS + a CCB (<b>azelnidipine,</b> 3 mg/kg/day), NS + olmesartan + <b>azelnidipine</b> or NS + hydralazine (50 mg/kg/day). Four weeks of treatment with HS diet induced hypertension, proteinuria, glomerular sclerosis and hypertrophy, glomerular podocyte injury, and tubulointerstitial fibrosis in DSS rats. A continued HS diet progressed hypertension, proteinuria and renal tissue injury, which was associated with inflammatory cell infiltration and increased proinflammatory cytokine mRNA levels, NADPH oxidase activity and NADPH oxidase-dependent superoxide production in the kidney. In contrast, switching to NS halted the progression of hypertension, renal glomerular and tubular injuries. Dietary salt reduction with ARB or with CCB treatment further reduced blood pressure and partially reversed renal tissues injury. Furthermore, dietary salt reduction with the combination of ARB plus CCB elicited a strong recovery from HS-induced renal tissue injury including the attenuation of inflammation and oxidative stress.

Patients and methods: Patients with systolic BP ≥ 140 mmHg and/or diastolic BP ≥ 90 mmHg received olmesartan monotherapy (20 mg/day) for 12 weeks. They were then randomly assigned to fixed-dose add-on therapy with <b>azelnidipine</b> (16 mg/day; n = 26) or amlodipine (5 mg/day; n = 26) for a further 2 years. CBP, LVMI, e´ velocity, E/e´ratio, E/A ratio, baPWV, and AIx were measured at baseline, 6 months, and 2 years. Results: Baseline characteristics of both groups were similar. The decrease in brachial BP over 2 years was similar in both groups. CBP, LVMI, E/e´ ratio, baPWV, and AIx decreased significantly, and the E/A ratio and e´ velocity increased significantly in both groups. The decreases in CBP (P < 0. 001), AIx (P < 0. 001), baPWV (P < 0. 001), LVMI (P < 0. 001), and E/e´ (P = 0. 002) as well as the increase in E/A ratio (P = 0. 03) over 2 years were significantly greater in the olmesartan/azelnidipine group than in the olmesartan/amlodipine group. Multivariate linear regression analyses showed that the changes in baPWV (β = 0. 41, P < 0. 001) and CBP (β = 0. 47, P = 0. 01) were independently associated with the change in LVMI, the change in baPWV (β = 0. 25, P < 0. 001) was independently associated with the change in E/e´ ratio, and the changes in baPWV (β = 0. 21, P = 0. 001) and AIx (β = 0. 25, P = 0. 03) were independently associated with the change in E/A ratio.

In the present study, we hypothesized that CCB enhances the protective effects of an angiotensin II type 1 receptor blocker (ARB) against diabetic cerebrovascular-renal injury. Saline-drinking type 2 diabetic KK-A(y) mice developed hypertension and exhibited impaired cognitive function, blood-brain barrier (BBB) disruption, albuminuria, glomerular sclerosis and podocyte injury. These brain and renal injuries were associated with increased gene expression of NADPH oxidase components, NADPH oxidase activity and oxidative stress in brain and kidney tissues as well as systemic oxidative stress. Treatment with the ARB, olmesartan (10 mg/kg/day) reduced blood pressure in saline-drinking KK-A(y) mice and attenuated cognitive decline, BBB disruption, glomerular injury and albuminuria, which were associated with a reduction of NADPH oxidase activity and oxidative stress in brain and kidney tissues as well as systemic oxidative stress.

40|$|The {{extent of}} {{interaction}} between calcium channel antagonists and grapefruit juice varies widely among drugs. Coadministration of calcium channel antagonists with grapefruit juice can elevate the bioavailability of drugs and alter pharmacokinetic parameters of the drug. A calcium channel antagonist with lower bioavailability {{is likely to be}} more affect-ed by grapefruit juice. The area under the concentration-time curve and peak serum con-centrations of <b>azelnidipine,</b> efonidipine, felodipine, manidipine, nicardipine, nifedipine, nisoldipine, nitrendipine and verapamil are influenced by grapefruit juice. Conversely, pharmacokinetic parameters of amlodipine and diltiazem are not affected by grapefruit juice. The action of grapefruit juice is rapid, and a single exposure to one glass of juice can usually produce a significant interaction. Furanocoumarins primarily contribute to grapefruit juice-drug interactions in humans. Cytochrome P 4503 A 4 and P-glycoprotein may act in tandem as a barrier to oral delivery of drugs. The main mechanism for en-hanced bioavailability of drugs by grapefruit juice is, presumably, the inhibition of cyto-chrome P 4503 A 4 in the small intestine and only to a minor extent affected by P-glycopro-tein function.

40|$|Background/Aims. Arterial {{stiffness}} is {{an independent}} risk factor for cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. This {{study was conducted to}} determine the effect of olmesartan (OLM) and <b>azelnidipine</b> (AZL) on arterial stiffness using the cardio-ankle vascular index (CAVI), which is a novel blood pressure (BP) -independent marker for arterial stiffness in hypertensive patients. Methods. Fifty-two consecutive hypertensive patients were randomly assigned either to a group treated with OLM monotherapy or to a group treated with OLM and AZL combination therapy. Clinical and biological parameters were measured before and 12 months after the start of this study. Results. Both therapies significantly and similarly reduced BP, augmentation index, and plasma aldosterone levels. The combination therapy significantly decreased CAVI and serum low-density lipoprotein (LDL-C) levels and these reductions were significantly greater than those produced with monotherapy. No significant differences in metabolic parameters were observed between the two therapies. Conclusion. The combination therapy with OLM and AZL had beneficial effects on arterial stiffness assessed by CAVI, LDL-C, and metabolism, despite the similar BP reduction, compared with OLM monotherapy. Since these markers are known to influence the future risk of cardiovascular events, combination therapy with OLM and AZL could be a useful choice for treating hypertensive patients...|$|E
40|$|Background: Morning blood {{pressure}} (BP) surge, which exhibits an age-related increase, {{is a risk}} factor for stroke in elderly hypertensive patients, independently of the 24 -h BP level. We studied the effect of the new baroreceptor sensitivity (BRS) -restoring Ca-channel blocker (CCB) <b>azelnidipine</b> (AZ) on this age-related morning BP increase. Methods: We conducted a 16 -week prospective study to clarify the effect of morning dosing of AZ on home BPs measured in the morning and in the evening in 2, 546 hypertensive patients (mean age, 65. 1 years; female, 53. 6 %). Results: At baseline, ME-Dif (morning systolic BP [SBP]–evening SBP) increased with age, independently of ME-Ave (average of the morning and evening SBPs). This age-related increase of ME-Dif was exaggerated by regular alcohol drinking and beta-blocker use. After AZ treatment (14. 3 ± 3. 6 mg/day), ME-AV and ME-Dif were significantly reduced independently of each other, with reductions of – 18. 1 ± 15. 6 and – 2. 5 ± 13. 2 mmHg, respectively (both p < 0. 001). AZ treatment decreased age-related increase in ME-Dif particularly in patients who were regular consumers of alcohol and in beta-blocker users. Conclusions: The new BRS-restoring CCB AZ significantly reduced age-related increase in morning BP and had some potential benefit on cardiovascular protection in hypertension, particularly in elderly patients and/or consumers of alcohol...|$|E

Methods This study examined the effect of AZL on circulating markers of cardiac damage, altered lipid and cytokines profile and markers of oxidative stress including homocysteine in diabetic rats. Results STZ induced diabetes caused {{a significant increase in}} blood glucose levels. It also resulted in an increase in the levels of homocysteine and cardiac damage markers, like Troponin- 1, CK-MB, CK-NAC, uric acid, LDH and alkaline phosphatase. Moreover, there was an increase in the levels of proinflammatory cytokines like TNF-α, IFN-γ, and TGF-β and decrease in the levels of IL- 4 and IL- 10. Additionally, there was increase in the levels of cholesterol, triglycerides, LDL, VLDL and a decrease in HDL in these animals.

Each test agent was administered by oral gavage for 12 weeks. Systolic blood pressure (SBP) was measured every 2 weeks and urinary protein excretion (UproV) every 3 weeks. At the age of 32 weeks, the rats were sacrificed and blood and kidneys collected for biochemical, histological, and immunohistochemical studies. All drug treatments significantly (p< 0. 05) reduced SBP, UproV, and blood biochemical parameters such as creatinine, total cholesterol, and blood urea nitrogen. Masson trichrome staining and immunohistochemical staining revealed significant (p< 0. 05) reductions of interstitial fibrosis, collagen type III, nicotinamide-adenine dinucleotide/nicotinamide-adenine dinucleotide phosphate oxidase, and p 22 phox and p 47 phox components expression in the AZN- and OLM-treated groups in comparison with rats treated with HYD and control animals. ED 1, 4 -hydroxy- 2 -nonenal (4 -HNE), and heat shock protein (HSP) - 47 expression was also reduced in the AZN- and OLM-treated groups versus in HYD and control animals.

40|$|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a {{debilitating}} neurodegenerative disease with no known cure. The cause and progression of AD is still unclear. Over the years, {{studies have shown}} that one of the earliest cytotoxic effects is the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and inflammation induced by the amyloid-beta peptide in microglial cells, endothelial cells and neurons. The focus of this thesis is to study the effects of <b>Azelnidipine</b> (ALP), which is a Calcium channel blocker, on Abeta-induced oxidative stress and its downstream pathways in mouse immortalized cerebral endothelial cells (bEnd. 3). In AD, Abeta 1 - 42 induces oxidative stress through the activation of ERK 1 / 2 pathway, phosphorylation of cPLA 2 and production of intercellular superoxide anions. Furthermore, Abeta 42 has been shown to induce the translocation of NF-kappaB into the nucleus of bEnd. 3 cells causing an inflammatory response. Here, ALP is utilized to reduce the ROS and inflammatory effects of A? 42 in bEnd. 3 cells. The results show that ALP is effective in reducing the Abeta 42 induced superoxide anion production, ERK 1 / 2 activation, cPLA 2 phosphorylation and NF-kappaB translocation into the nucleus of bEnd. 3 cells. Thus, ALP may be an effective treatment to alleviate the debilitating effects of AD. Finally, this research implicates that there may be cross-talk between the ERK 1 / 2 pathway and NF-kappaB translocation into the bEnd. 3 nucleus...|$|E

We investigated apoptosis inhibitor of macrophages (AIM) expression in nephrosclerotic rats and {{the involvement of}} AIM in olmesartan (OLM) - and <b>azelnidipine</b> (AZN) -induced decreases {{in the number of}} macrophages infiltrating the kidney. We randomly assigned 20 -week-old male SHRsp rats to receive one of the following substances every day for 12 weeks: water (vehicle), hydralazine (HYD), OLM, or AZN. Renal damage was assessed by Masson trichrome staining. Expressions of ED- 1, AIM, and oxidized low-density lipoprotein (oxLDL) were immunohistochemically detected. Apoptosis was analyzed by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase deoxyuridine triphosphate (dUTP) nick-end labeling (TUNEL) staining. All treatment groups showed significantly less renal interstitial fibrosis than the vehicle group. AZN and OLM groups had significantly fewer AIM-expressing cells than the HYD and vehicle groups. The ratios AIM-positive cells/ ED- 1 -positive macrophages and TUNEL-positive cells/ED- 1 -positive macrophages in the AZN and OLM groups were lower and higher, respectively, than the the HYD and vehicle groups. oxLDL expression in the renal interstitium was significantly lower in treatment groups compared to vehicle group. OLM and AZN inhibited interstitial fibrosis progression in SHRsp rats by suppressing AIM expression in macrophages, followed by reducing the number of infiltrating macrophages. 長崎大学学位論文 学位記番号:博(医歯薬) 甲第 633 号 学位授与年月日:平成 25 年 10 月 2 日Author: Tadashi Uramatsu, Tomoya Nishino, Yoko Obata, Yohei Sato, Akira Furusu, Takehiko Koji, Toru Miyazaki, Shigeru KohnoCitation: Biological and Pharmaceutical Bulletin, 36 (8), pp. 1271 - 1277; 201...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Numerous evidences {{suggest that}} {{diabetic}} heart {{is characterized by}} compromised ventricular contraction and prolonged relaxation attributable to multiple causative factors including calcium accumulation, oxidative stress and apoptosis. Therapeutic interventions to prevent calcium accumulation and oxidative stress could be therefore helpful in improving the cardiac function under diabetic condition. Methods This {{study was designed to}} examine the effect of long-acting calcium channel blocker (CCB), <b>Azelnidipine</b> (AZL) on contractile dysfunction, intracellular calcium (Ca 2 +) cycling proteins, stress-activated signaling molecules and apoptosis on cardiomyocytes in diabetes. Adult male Wistar rats were made diabetic by a single intraperitoneal (IP) injection of streptozotocin (STZ). Contractile functions were traced from live diabetic rats to isolated individual cardiomyocytes including peak shortening (PS), time-to-PS (TPS), time-to-relengthening (TR 90), maximal velocity of shortening/relengthening (± dL/dt) and intracellular Ca 2 + fluorescence. Results Diabetic heart showed significantly depressed PS, ± dL/dt, prolonged TPS, TR 90 and intracellular Ca 2 + clearing and showed an elevated resting intracellular Ca 2 +. AZL itself exhibited little effect on myocyte mechanics but it significantly alleviated STZ-induced myocyte contractile dysfunction. Diabetes increased the levels of superoxide, enhanced expression of the cardiac damage markers like troponin I, p 67 phox NADPH oxidase subunit, restored the levels of the mitochondrial superoxide dismutase (Mn-SOD), calcium regulatory proteins RyR 2 and SERCA 2 a, and suppressed the levels of the anti-apoptotic Bcl- 2 protein. All of these STZ-induced alterations were reconciled by AZL treatment.

Sports Physiol., Vol. 19, No. 3 pp. 73 - 81, 2013. Exercise is {{recommended}} for obese patients with diabetic nephropathy (DN) but without overt proteinuria to improve glucose and lipid metabolism. The calcium channel blocker, <b>azelnidipine</b> (Azel), is an antihypertensive agent that prevents end-organ damage. We {{examined the effects of}} exercise and Azel alone or in combination on body weight (BW), blood pressure (BP), glucose clearance, lipid profile, glomerular morphology, urinary albumin (U Alb), and total protein excretion (UTP) in Otsuka Long Evans Tokushima Fatty (OLETF) rats, an animal model of obesity-induced diabetes. OLETF rats were evenly divided into the following groups: sedentary (OLETF-Sed), Azel (OLETF-Azel), exercise (OLETF-Ex), and Azel plus exercise (OLETF-Azel &Ex). Azel (1 0 mg/kg/day) was administered in the chow; animals in the exercise groups exercised voluntarily and freely on a rotatory wheel. All treatments were performed from 21 to 30 weeks of age. Exercise alone decreased serum lipids (triglycerides [TG], total cholesterol [Tcho], and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol [HDLC], and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol [LDL-C], and increased glucose clearance in the oral glucose tolerance test. The increase in BW was attenuated with exercise. Azel alone inhibited protein excretion, improved kidney histopathology, and prevented an increase in BP. Improvements in all the parameters measured were seen with combined treatment.

In the present study, we investigated {{the effect of a}} Ca 2 + channel blocker on the phosphorylation of p 38 MAPK and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) in immature monocyte-derived DCs stimulated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or LPS-ICs, and the production of interleukin (IL) - 12 family members (p 40, p 70, IL- 23), T helper type 17 (Th 17) cytokines (IL- 6 and IL- 23), tumour necrosis factor (TNF) -α and IL- 10 were also investigated. In comparison with LPS stimulation, LPS-ICs stimulation enhanced p 38 MAPK phosphorylation significantly, which was associated with an increase in IL- 12 p 40 monomer/homodimer secretion. LPS-ICs also enhanced TNF-α and IL- 6 secretion, but suppressed IL- 23 secretion. The use of <b>azelnidipine</b> (Aze), a long-acting L-type Ca 2 + channel blocker with a high lipid solubility, suppressed p 38 MAPK phosphorylation stimulated with LPS or LPS-ICs, but surprisingly enhanced IL- 12 p 40 monomer/homodimer secretion stimulated with LPS-ICs. This IL- 12 p 40 secretion-enhancing effect was not accompanied by IL- 10 or IL- 23 production, but was associated with ERK phosphorylation. The use of Aze did not affect IL- 12 p 70 production. These results suggest that the use of Aze enhances ICs-mediated IL- 12 p 40 secretion without additional IL- 23 secretion. Therefore, the use of Aze and ICs could be a new therapeutic approach to immunomolecular therapy, as it does not cause Th 17 differentiation which induces autoimmunity or reduces anti-tumour immunity...|$|E
