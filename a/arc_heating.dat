40|$|In a {{previous}} letter [1], we {{have demonstrated that}} corrosion of a physical vapor deposition (PVD) coating substrate system can be induced by coating defects, resulting in premature damage to the usually hard and corrosion resistant coatings. Shrinkage pin holes, {{one of the most}} common defects, allow access of solution to substrate to cause galvanic corrosion [2, 3], and this may be prevented by forming a pin-hole interrupting under or sandwich layers of passivating metals such as Al or Ti [4, 5]. Since the increasing application and development of plasma arc in various PVD techniques, owing to the capability of the arc technique to achieve relatively high metallic vapor ion valence states, surface and atom mobility and diffusivity, and consequently the greater coating-substrate adhesion [6], more attention has been paid to the study of the arc-related formation of droplet or macroparticle coating defects. Due to the nature of its formation, a macroparticle is the product of a droplet of cathode metal induced by plasma <b>arc</b> <b>heating,</b> which, after being ejected from the cathode, solidifies and becomes embedded within the coating after incomplete reaction (due to its size) within the deposition chamber gas (N-plasma, for example) during its flight to the substrate [7]. That is why a macroparticle is different, in addition to its great size,in chemical composition (N-content) not only from the adjacent coating matrix, but also from the particle exterior to interior parts [8]. The composition inconsistency of the droplets rendered the defects to galvanic coupling (anodic to the adjacent coating matrix) to corrode first upon contact with aqueous solutions, and with progression, this eventually led to the penetration of solutions to the substrate to cause more severe crevice corrosion [9]. The severity of such droplet-induced corrosion depends on many factors but generally droplets are regarded to be detrimental as far as their effect on the overall coating's corrosion performance is concerned [10 - 12]...|$|E
40|$|Die in dieser Arbeit entwickelte, neuartige Plasmaquelle TIHTUS setzt sich aus einem lichtbogenbeheizten Triebwerk mit konvergent-divergenter Düse und einer nachgeschalteten, induktiv beheizten Stufe mit zylindrischem Entladungsrohr zusammen, die den Wasserstoffplasmastrahl der ersten Stufe besonders in den Außenbereichen weiter aufheizt. Mit einer derartigen Nachheizung soll das Leistungsspektrum von Plasmageneratoren und -triebwerken hinsichtlich Schub oder Austrittsgeschwindigkeit und Totaldruck oder spezifischer Enthalpie erweitert werden. Jede der zwei Stufen kann gesondert mit Leistung versorgt und durch jede der zwei Stufen kann Gas zugeführt werden, sodass die Hybridplasmaquelle ausschließlich lichtbogenbeheizt, ausschließlich induktiv oder kombiniert betrieben werden kann. So wird gezeigt, dass nennenswerte Einkopplung von induktiver Leistung in ein reines thermisches Wasserstoffplasma möglich ist. Durch Messung von Plasmaleistung, Schub, Totaldruck, Plasmageschwindigkeit, Wärmestromdichte und Induktionsspulenstrom werden das Betriebsverhalten und die Plasmabedingungen bei zuvor theoretisch und experimentell für Wasserstoff optimierter Betriebsfrequenz von 840 kHz umfassend charakterisiert. Mit einer systematischen Variation der Parameter Leistungs- und Massenstromzufuhr zu den Stufen bei einer Gesamtleistung von 50 kW und 300 mg/s Wasserstoffmassenstrom wird der Einfluss der Nachheizung durch die zweite Stufe auf das Plasma herausgearbeitet. Die Messergebnisse werden mit Hilfe der hergeleiteten theoretischen Modelle für Hybridplasmaquellen und einer numerischen Strömungsberechnung interpretiert. Die Plasmaleistung lässt sich von 13, 1 kW bei reiner Lichtbogenheizung mit 25 kW auf 21 kW bei zusätzlicher induktiver Nachheizung mit weiteren 25 kW steigern. Dies geht jedoch mit einer Verringerung des thermischen Wirkungsgrads von 52, 4 % auf 42, 9 % einher. Ebenso steigt die Schubstrahlleistung bei Zuschalten der zweiten Stufe bei den gleichen Bedingungen von 4, 6 kW bei 18, 5 % Schubwirkungsgrad auf 5, 6 kW bei 11, 4 % Schubwirkungsgrad an. Dies entspricht Schubwerten von 1, 66 N und 1, 85 N. Des Weiteren wird beobachtet, dass bei Leistungsaufspaltung zwischen den Stufen gleicher Schub und gleiche effektive Austrittsgeschwindigkeit wie mit der rein lichtbogenbetriebenen Hybridplasmaquelle erreicht werden kann, wenn die Gaszufuhr ebenfalls auf zwei Stufen aufgeteilt wird. Anhand der Totaldruckprofile, die im Maximum 85 Pa betragen, wird bestätigt, dass die induktive Einkopplung am Strahlrand stattfindet. Die Profile verbreitern sich bei zunehmender induktiver Heizung. Dasselbe gilt für die Geschwindigkeitsverteilung, die für steigende Lichtbogenleistung von 3000 m/s auf 9000 m/s ansteigende Werte im Strahlzentrum zeigt. Mit Hilfe der systematischen experimentellen Untersuchung der Nachheizung einer Überschallwasserstoffströmung werden in der vorliegenden Arbeit die theoretischen und experimentellen Grundlagen zur Optimierung des zweistufigen Systems geschaffen. Die entwickelten analytischen Modelle erlauben darüber hinaus, entsprechende Auslegungsrechnungen für zukünftige Entwicklungen durchzuführen. The exhaust {{velocity}} of hydrogen that was heated in the stagnation chamber of a rocket engine is limited for various reasons. New thruster concepts are required {{in order to}} produce higher {{exhaust velocity}} at high thrust. One approach to transfer more power into a plasma flow is to use an afterburner heating mechanism to reheat the edge of the plume without exceeding the material limitations mentioned above. In the framework of the present thesis, a novel thermal-inductive hybrid thruster (TIHTUS) was set up and characterized in a ground test facility. TIHTUS is a two-stage plasma generator where reheating of a hydrogen arcjet plume is realized by means of induction. The novel thruster may be operated in either arc heated (DC), inductively heated (RF), or hybrid mode. Thus, it is shown that a notable amount of inductive power can be coupled into a pure hydrogen plasma flow. Central gas flow through the arc heated stage is expanded into the injection head of the inductive, second stage where a swirl gas flow can be admixed. As a result of the divergent gas jet being redirected through the cylindrical discharge tube, the latter is strongly heated where the plume impinges on the quartz tube. Due to the resulting tube cooling limitations, the investigated operational conditions are limited to a total of 50 kW of power input at a total of 300 mg/s mass flow rate. After the thruste's individual stages are investigated, the combined thruster is characterized by means of several probes. The first investigation on the hybrid thruster is to theoretically determine the optimum operation frequency to 840 kHz [11]. The calorimetric experiments are in accordance to this. The power balance drawn for hybrid operation of the thruster showed that the plasma power measured by the calorimeter rises from 13. 1 kW at 25 kW pure <b>arc</b> <b>heating</b> to 21 kW at additional inductive heating with another 25 kW. However, this takes place at a thermal efficiency decrease from 52. 4 % to 42. 9 % [3]. The same is the case for the thrust power increasing from 4. 6 kW at 18. 5 % to 5. 6 kW at 11. 4 % efficiency for the same operating conditions [4]. This implies that the power coupled into the plasma downstream of the first stage's nozzle cannot be used efficiently. Varying the power staging at a constant total power of 50 kW shows that increasing power to the second stage leads to a decrease of both plasma power and thrust power. Additionally varying the mass flow staging, however, raises the exhaust velocity and thrust to the same levels as for pure <b>arc</b> <b>heating</b> of the hybrid plasma source. This can ready be reached in hybrid mode although the geometry of the thruster has not been varied, as for example by adding a second nozzle or by minimizing the distance between <b>arc</b> <b>heating</b> and induction heating. Moreover, radially resolved state variables are measured at an axial distance of x= 200 mm from the thruster exit. With increasing coupling of RF-power into a constantly arc heated hydrogen plasma, a dilatation of the plume is observed for total pressure with slightly sinking eccentric maxima. This shows that, as expected, mostly the gas close to the wall is heated. In the plume center, total pressure increases with the arc power. Varying the mass flow staging, an increasing swirl gas flow from the second stage adds to the ambient pressure while the plume width remains uninfluenced. The determinion of thrust from total pressure is coincidental to the result of the impact plate measurements that were taken at an axial distance of 860 mm from the thruster exit [4]. The radial distribution of the plasma velocity in the plume is also widened at increasing second stage power. It shows rising values on the plume axis for increasing arc power [7]. At increasing swirl gas flow, the maximum becomes more and more eccentric. At 25 kW input power to each stage and 200 mg/s gas flow to the DC- and 100 mg gas flow to the RF-stage, the highest profile is detected. From velocity and total pressure, under assumption of an equilibrium model, plasma temperature is derived, giving temperatures between 3000 K and 9000 K on the plume axis [7]. With the heat flux measurements and an equilibrium approach, radially resolved mass-specific enthalpy can also be determined. The integral of these values over the plume cross section compares well to the calorimetrically obtained plasma enthalpy. After having interpreted the numerical fluid calculations, it was expected that the inductive heating, coupling mostly into the subsonic edges of the plasma plume, not only contributes to the acceleration but also to a homogenisation of the radial distribution of the state variables in the plasma. By means of the systematic experimental investigation of the present thesis, the fundamental understanding is composed for the layout and optimization of a two-stage hybrid electric thruster. Moreover, the analytical models which are developed permit respective layout calculations for future developments...|$|E

40|$|In {{the modern}} world, {{there is a}} need of {{materials}} with very high hardness and shear strength in order to satisfy industrial requirements. So many materials which satisfy the properties are manufactured. Machining of such materials with conventional method of machining was proved to be very costly as these materials greatly affect the tool life. So to decrease tool wear, power consumed and increase surface finish Hot Machining can be used. Here the temperature of the work piece is raised to several hundred or even thousand degree Celsius above ambient, so as to reduce the shear strength of the material. Various heating method has been attempted, for example, bulk heating using furnace, area heating using torch flame, plasma <b>arc</b> <b>heating,</b> induction heating and electric current resistance heating at tool-work interface. From the past experiments it was found the power consumed during turning operations is primarily due to shearing of the material and plastic deformation of the metal removed. Since both the shear strength and hardness values of engineering materials decrease with temperature, it was thus postulated that an increase in work piece temperature would reduce the amount of power consumed for machining and eventually increase tool life. The experiment is conducted in an auto feed lathe. The temperature is controlled by a thermocouple and automated flame heating system. The statistical analysis is done by Taguchi method. Taguchi designs provide a powerful and efficient method for designing products that operate consistently and optimally over a variety of conditions. The primary goal is to find factor settings that minimize response variation, while adjusting (or keeping) the process on target. A process designed with this goal will produce more consistent output. A product designed with this goal will deliver more consistent performance regardless of the environment in which it is used. Taguchi method advocates the use of orthogonal array designs to assign the factors chosen for the experiment. The most commonly used orthogonal array designs are L 8, L 16, L 9 (i. e. eight experimental trials), L 16 and L 18. The power of the Taguchi method is that it integrates statistical methods into the engineering process. The significance of the control factors are found in the following order. Cutting speed - 150 rev/min, Depth of Cut - 0. 5 mm, Temperature - 600 degree, Feed - 0. 05 mm/rev From statistical design of experiments by Taguchi method (MINITAB software) and Hot Machining we find that the power required is decreased and the tool life is increased by 14. 8 %...|$|E
40|$|This project {{evaluated}} the metal transfer behaviour of the variable polarity (VP) GMAW process. Analysis was performed using high speed video that was synchronised with high speed data acquisition. Melting rate measurements {{were found to}} be very dependent on current waveform, polarity, and droplet size, and metal transfer if it occurred, for each waveform period. The transient conditions of current waveform and metal transfer produced rapid changes in arc behaviour which influenced the melting at the electrode tip and growing droplet. The concentrated melting theory was developed to explain the significant increase in electrode extension burnoff and droplet growth rate that occurred at short EN time as a function of current, and during EP peak pulse when the pre-pulse droplet volume was small. The highest electrode extension burnoff and droplet growth rate occurred when the arc was permitted to climb over the solid electrode tip producing rapid concentrated melting. Likewise, large molten droplets were found to promote a negative electrode extension burnoff and a decreased droplet growth rate. The arc rooted on large droplets providing additional heating but limited electrode melting. The droplet burnoff rate (DBR) method was developed and found to yield good experimental measurements for the arc and resistive heating coefficients used in a 2 nd order melting rate equation developed for a complex waveform process, like VP-GMAW. For the EN period, the EN time affected the melting rate as a function of EN current. The greater melting rate that occurred at low EN time was measured by the changes in the resistive heating coefficient. Concentrated arc melting of the electrode extension at low EN time caused the slope of the burnoff diagram to increase, which represented the resistive heating coefficient. The melting rate of the EP pulse was related to the pre-pulse droplet volume. Large pre-pulse droplets decreased the <b>arc</b> <b>heating</b> coefficient, which could be negative, which meant the electrode extension was increasing and the arc length was decreasing in that waveform period. VP-GMAW power supplies offered stable operation for welding sheet structures on both carbon steel and stainless steel.

Welding speeds were up to 300 % higher with VP-GMAW compared to the GMAW-P process when welding lap joints on 1. 8 mm thick material with a 1. 8 mm gap.

In contrast to previous modeling investigations, this work relaxes some critical assumptions and provides a more realistic and comprehensive representation of the system. This work also examines and compares the relative merits of alternative electromagnetic and turbulence formulations, and addresses the role of induced currents and compressibility effects in the representation of the arc. Furthermore, due allowance was made to represent and analyze the effect of gas injection, the presence of a slag layer in the bath and changes in anode configuration {{at the bottom of the}} reactor. Because of a lack of experimental information on actual or pilot plant DC-EAF systems, different aspects of the model were validated using several sources of experimental data reported in the literature for related systems. These included measurements on welding arcs, laboratory scale high-intensity carbon arcs, electromagnetically driven metallic systems, and ladle metallurgy physical models. It was found that, in general, the agreement between measurements and predictions was good. A detailed analysis was carried out to examine the effect of process parameters (e. g., arc current, arc length, bath dimensions, anode arrangements, etc) on the behavior of the furnace (e. g., heat transfer to the bath, heating efficiency, mixing times in the bath, etc). Predictions from the arc model show that all the arc characteristics are strongly coupled and that the arc physics is governed by the expansion of the arc. From a parametric study it was found that when the arc region (defined by the 10, 000 K isotherm) is plotted in dimensionless form, a universal shape for the arc can be defined, regardless of the values of arc current or arc length. This universality was restricted to the range of conditions analyzed in this thesis, to arcs struck between graphite cathodes in air, and does not include the jet impingement region on the bath surface. This common arc expansion behavior suggested the universal nature of other arc characteristics. Universal maps of temperature, magnetic: flux density, and axial velocity are also reported in terms of simple analytical expressions. The practical effects of the two main process parameters of the arc region,. i. e. the arc current and the arc length, were analyzed. It was found that increasing the arc length significantly increases the arc resistance and, consequently, the arc power, although this behavior reached asymptotic values at larger arc lengths. Increasing the arc current, however, does not affect the arc voltage. Thus, it is found that increasing the arc power increases the amount of energy transferred into the bath, but the heat transfer efficiency decreases. Therefore, the shorter the arc the more efficient is the heat transfer to the bath. It is also recognized that heat transfer from the arc to the bath is controlled by convection, although radiation can become an important mechanism, especially for large arc lengths. Results of the bath model indicate that, in the absence of inert gas stirring and with no slag present in the system, electromagnetic body forces dominate and are responsible for the fluid flow patterns in the system. The effects of the arc determine the distributions of temperature and other mixing characteristics in the bath. The bath model was used to evaluate the effect of the main process parameters and design variables on mixing, refractory wear, temperature stratification, and heat transfer efficiency. An increase in the arc length is detrimental to mixing but increases the rate of heating in the melt as a result of the increased arc power. Increasing arc current improves mixing and the heat transferred to the bath, but is likely to be detrimental to the life of the bottom refractory. The results also suggest that high furnace aspect ratios (taller and thinner arc furnaces) are highly recommended because an increase in the aspect ratio increases mixing, prevents refractory wear, and promotes <b>arc</b> <b>heating</b> efficiency. The arc configuration in the furnace can be changed to control fluid flow patterns in the bath to meet specific needs, such as better mixing, or to prevent refractory wear. The presence of a top layer of slag reduces mixing and increases overall liquid temperatures. Injection of gases through the bottom in eccentric operations generates complex flow patterns that improve mixing in regions away from the symmetry axis. It is the author's belief that this model is a useful tool for process analysis in the DC-EAF. It has the capability to address many issues of current and future concern and represents one component of a fundamental approach to the optimization of DC-EAF operations. by Marco Aurelio Ramírez.
