5|$|The {{outcome of}} the battle changed the {{perception}} of the rebel movement in Mexico. Before Madero's victory many believed that the rebel forces would scatter <b>as</b> <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> confronted by federal troops. The fall of Juárez proved that notion wrong and revealed the real strength of the rebel forces.|$|E
5|$|The {{action was}} {{illuminated}} in brief, blinding flashes by Jap searchlights which were shot out <b>as</b> <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> turned on, by muzzle flashes from big guns, by fantastic streams of tracers, and by huge orange-colored explosions as two Jap destroyers {{and one of}} our destroyers blew up... From the beach it resembled a door to hell opening and closing... over and over.|$|E
5|$|At 11:35, Kinkaid {{decided to}} {{withdraw}} Enterprise and her screening ships from battle, since Hornet {{was out of}} action, Enterprise was heavily damaged, and surmising, correctly, that the Japanese had one or two undamaged carriers in the area. Leaving Hornet behind, Kinkaid directed the carrier and her task force to retreat <b>as</b> <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> able. Between 11:39 and 13:22, Enterprise recovered 57 of the 73 airborne U.S. aircraft as she retreated. The remaining U.S. aircraft ditched in the ocean, and their aircrews were rescued by escorting warships.|$|E

5|$|The quick pace {{of change}} meant that many ships were {{obsolete}} <b>as</b> <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> finished, and that naval tactics were {{in a state of}} flux. Many ironclads were built {{to make use of the}} ram or the torpedo, which a number of naval designers considered the important weapons of naval combat. There is no clear end to the ironclad period, but towards the end of the 1890s the term ironclad dropped out of use. New ships were increasingly constructed to a standard pattern and designated battleships or armored cruisers.|$|E
5|$|<b>As</b> <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> ready, {{the charges}} were blown and Nuneaton started to tow Likomba out of the harbour. Aboard Duchessa d'Aosta, 11 men {{had managed to get}} aboard from Vulcan; while one group planted charges on the anchor chains, another searched below decks {{collecting}} prisoners. Blowing the anchor chains, Vulcan started to tow Duchessa d'Aosta out of the harbour. The explosions had alerted the population of the town, who started to gather on the pier, but no attempts were made to stop the ships from leaving. Several anti-aircraft emplacements opened fire at imaginary targets, believing the explosions to have been caused by an aerial attack, but the six-inch guns protecting the harbour itself remained silent. From entering the harbour to leaving with the ships under tow, the operation had taken 30 minutes, without any losses to the raiding party.|$|E
5|$|Nevertheless, {{there were}} some who were {{concerned}} by the expansion of powers granted to Augustus by the Second Settlement, and this {{came to a head}} with the apparent conspiracy of Fannius Caepio. Some time prior to 1 September 22 BC, a certain Castricius provided Augustus with information about a conspiracy led by Fannius Caepio. Murena was named among the conspirators, the outspoken Consul who defended Primus in the Marcus Primus Affair. The conspirators were tried in absentia with Tiberius acting as prosecutor; the jury found them guilty, {{but it was not a}} unanimous verdict. All the accused were sentenced to death for treason and executed <b>as</b> <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> captured—without ever giving testimony in their defence. Augustus ensured that the facade of Republican government continued with an effective cover-up of the events.|$|E

Margot took a shorthand course by correspondence in Bep Voskuijl's name and received high marks. Most of Anne's time was spent reading and studying, and she regularly wrote and edited her diary entries. In addition to providing a narrative of events as they occurred, she wrote about her feelings, beliefs, and ambitions, subjects she felt she could not discuss with anyone. As her confidence in her writing grew, and as she began to mature, she wrote of more abstract subjects such as her belief in God, and how she defined human nature.|$|E
5|$|In 77 BC, {{the senate}} sent one of Sulla's former lieutenants, Gnaeus Pompey Magnus, {{to put down}} an {{uprising}} in Spain. By 71 BC, Pompey returned to Rome after having completed his mission, and around the same time, another of Sulla's former lieutenants, Marcus Licinius Crassus, had just put down a slave revolt in Italy. Upon their return, Pompey and Crassus found the populare party fiercely attacking Sulla's constitution, and so they attempted to forge {{an agreement with the}} populare party. If both Pompey and Crassus were elected Consul in 70 BC, they would dismantle the more obnoxious components of Sulla's constitution. The promise of both Pompey and Crassus, aided by the presence of both of their armies outside of the gates of Rome, helped to 'persuade' the populares to elect the two to the Consulship. <b>As</b> <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> elected, they dismantled most of Sulla's constitution.|$|E
5|$|Cornelio Saavedra {{was aware}} that the Junta would be {{resisted}} by factions still loyal to the old authorities. It was resisted locally by the Cabildo and the Royal Audiencia; the nearby plazas of Montevideo and Paraguay did not recognize it; and Santiago de Liniers organized a counter-revolution at Córdoba. During this early period, the Junta worked united against the royalist threats. Mariano Moreno, the secretary of war, drafted the decrees and regulations to deal with royalists. First, a decree ordered punishment for anyone attempting to generate disputes, and for those concealing conspiracies against the Junta or other people. The Royal Audiencia swore loyalty to the Regency Council, in defiance to the Junta, so they were summoned, along with former viceroy Cisneros, and exiled to Spain with the pretext {{that there was a}} threat to their lives. The Junta appointed new members for the Audiencia loyal to the revolution. Moreno organized as well the Paraguay campaign and the First Upper Peru campaign, to the plazas that resisted the Junta. The second one, headed by Francisco Ortiz de Ocampo, would move to Córdoba and attack the counter-revolution; before marching to Upper Peru. Ocampo's initial orders were to capture the counter-revolutionary leaders and send them to Buenos Aires, so that they could be judged. When the counter-revolution became stronger Moreno called the Junta and proposed that the enemy leaders should be shot <b>as</b> <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> captured instead of brought to trial. The new orders were carried out by Juan José Castelli. Cornelio Saavedra supported all these measures.|$|E

5|$|The {{departure}} of this combined squadron was observed by Captain Keats on Superb, which {{after returning to}} Cadiz had retained station off the port with HMS Thames and HMS Pasley. Thames was inshore searching a seized American merchant ship, and witnessed {{the emergence of the}} squadron, retreating before four ships of the line that approached the British frigate. Superb was sighted shortly afterwards and also retreated before a ship of the line and two frigates, reconstituting his small squadron in the wake of Moreno's force. Keats immediately sent Pasley ahead to Gibraltar to warn Saumarez, the brig arriving at 15:00 closely followed by {{the main body of the}} combined squadron, from which Saint Antoine had detached during the departure from Cadiz and was following behind, shadowed by Superb. Moreno's squadron anchored in the Bay of Gibraltar, out of reach of the British batteries on Gibraltar and waited there for Linois to complete his repairs, Saint Antoine joining the squadron on the morning of 10 July. Keats then brought his ships into Gibraltar, where efforts to repair the squadron were increased, with the knowledge that Moreno would soon be sailing to Cadiz with Linois squadron. Saumarez, concerned by the size of the combined squadron, sent urgent messages to the Mediterranean Fleet under Lord Keith in the Eastern Mediterranean requesting support in the belief that Moreno would be delayed at least two weeks due to the condition of Linois's ships. Saumarez was wrong: Moreno planned to convoy the battered squadron the short distance to Cadiz <b>as</b> <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> seaworthy.|$|E

This study identified four distinct growth stages: 1-year, 2-year, 4-year, and 7+ year.

In the morning of 8 May Vincejo found herself becalmed while the tide carried her towards the Teigneuse Rock.

The gunboats started firing <b>as</b> <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> in range and continued firing as they approached.
