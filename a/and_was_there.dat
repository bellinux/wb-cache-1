After being released from prison for the sexual assault of his four daughters, he had moved to Carvoeiro, Portugal, not far from Praia da Luz, <b>and</b> <b>was</b> <b>there</b> when Madeleine went missing.

Ylenia disappeared on 31 July 2007, nearly three months after Madeleine, and was found dead in September as a result of toluene poisoning. Von Aesch was living in Spain when Madeleine disappeared.|$|E

25|$|Like {{many of his}} comrades, Lieutenant Wood {{was sent}} to the Old Capitol Prison in Washington, DC, <b>and</b> <b>was</b> <b>there</b> when mobs roamed outside the structure, {{demanding}} that they be allowed in to punish the prisoners within who were suspected of assassinating Abraham Lincoln on the evening of April 14, 1865.
