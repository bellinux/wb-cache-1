5|$|<b>A</b> <b>key</b> <b>issue</b> facing Kenya was {{a border}} dispute in North East Province, {{alongside}} Somalia. Ethnic Somalis inhabited this region {{and claimed that}} it should be part of Somalia, not Kenya. Kenyatta refused to accede to their demands, insisting that the land remain Kenyan. In June 1962 Kenyatta travelled to Mogadishu to discuss the issue with the Somalian authorities, but the two sides could not reach an agreement.|$|E

5|$|The evicted {{residents}} were mostly Jewish immigrants from Arab states whose weak financial status left them vulnerable to Kollek's plan. The following steep increase in real-estate values of formerly depressed areas like Mamilla near the former armistice {{line and the}} Old City was perceived by evicted Mizrahi Jews as an injustice. This became <b>a</b> <b>key</b> <b>issue</b> in 1970s Israeli social upheaval and {{the founding of the}} Black Panthers movement in Israel.|$|E

5|$|As Isma'il al-Azhari {{began to}} assert his power, both Sayyid Ali al-Mirghani and Sayyid Abd al-Rahman became {{concerned}} that they would lose their political influence. From October 1955 Sayyid Ali began to seek ways to oust Isma'il al-Azhari from power. <b>A</b> <b>key</b> <b>issue</b> was whether a plebiscite should be held to determine if Sudan was to be independent of Egypt, which Sayyid Ali supported and Isma'il al-Azhari opposed. To strengthen his position in parliament, Isma'il al-Azhari started making overtures to associates of Sayyid Abd al-Rahman to explore {{the idea of an}} NUP-Umma coalition. Sudan formally became independent on 1 January 1956. On 2 February 1956 Isma'il al-Azhari announced a new cabinet that included representatives of all political parties and factions.|$|E
5|$|The {{turquoise}} parrot {{was once}} common across the Sydney region, and particularly abundant between the localities of Parramatta and Penrith. It dramatically declined in numbers between 1875 and 1895, although rare sightings in western Sydney and the Blue Mountains {{were recorded in}} the mid-twentieth century. The turquoise parrot was trapped for the aviary trade and used as pie-filling. Almost all of its preferred habitat, the Cumberland Plain, across western Sydney, had disappeared with development. Over half the woodland in New South Wales, and 80% across Australia has been cleared, and the remaining habitat is fragmented. <b>A</b> <b>key</b> <b>issue</b> is removal of mature eucalypts with resulting loss of hollows available for nesting. The species is thus listed as a Vulnerable species under Schedule 2 of the New South Wales Threatened Species Conservation Act, 1995 because of habitat destruction (TSC Act). Fire-burning regimes may be resulting in the regeneration favouring shrubs rather than grasses, which are the preferred food source for the species. Feral cats and foxes are a threat, particularly to nesting birds and young.|$|E

Cross-case analysis shows that the rate of CR developments and the focus of CR elements that are given priority vary significantly. The paper then discusses <b>a</b> number of <b>key</b> <b>issues</b> including CR data measurement, integrity and sharing before using force field analysis to explore some of the <b>key</b> <b>issues</b> that need to be tackled if CR is to be more effectively integrated into supply and procurement strategies...|$|R

25|$|The {{diversity}} of the crystal structures of rare-earth borides results in interesting physical properties and potential applications in thermopower generation. Thermal conductivity of boron icosahedra based compounds is low because of their complex crystal structure; this property is favored for thermoelectric materials. On the other hand, these compounds exhibit very low (variable range hopping type) p-type electrical conductivity. Increasing the conductivity is <b>a</b> <b>key</b> <b>issue</b> for thermoelectric applications of these borides.|$|E
