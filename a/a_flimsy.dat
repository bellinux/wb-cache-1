Phaeacius spins <b>a</b> <b>flimsy</b> silken, horizontal or vertical platform, about twice the spider's length in diameter, to moult and lay eggs, but not at other times. After the moult, Phaeacius leaves the discarded exuvia hanging from the platform. A female's egg sac is placed in a shallow cavity {{on the surface of}} a log.|$|E

25|$|Development for Masters of Teräs Käsi {{was handled}} {{internally}} at LucasArts. It {{was the first}} PlayStation title for the company, which presented challenges. Industrial Light & Magic assisted with motion capture, used for character animations. While spirits were high during the development and promotion of Masters of Teräs Käsi, the game was met with widespread criticism since its release. Criticisms range from <b>a</b> <b>flimsy</b> story to poor fighting mechanics.|$|E

His clothes were taken away and he was returned to the freezing cell wearing only <b>a</b> <b>flimsy</b> hospital gown.|$|E
25|$|On <b>a</b> <b>flimsy</b> pretext, a Republican French army invaded Switzerland in January 1798 {{and forced}} the country into an uneasy {{alliance}} marked by occasional revolts. By the start of hostilities with Austria in early 1799, Masséna was {{in command of the}} Army of Helvetia. Going on the offensive, the French inflicted defeats on the Austrians at Maienfeld, Chur and Feldkirch on 6 and 7 March. Ordered to attack Feldkirch in late March by his superior Jean-Baptiste Jourdan, Masséna attacked with troops under Nicolas Oudinot. Jourdan's defeats at Ostrach and Stockach soon forced the French to recoil.|$|E

One night the boat struck a snag in the head of Kentucky Bend, and sank with astonishing suddenness; water already well above the cabin floor when the captain got aft. So he cut into his wife's state-room from above with an ax; she was asleep in the upper berth, the roof <b>a</b> <b>flimsier</b> one than was supposed; the first blow crashed down through the rotten boards and clove her skull.|$|R

Kate Claxton, playing Louise, the blind orphan girl, along with actors J. B. Studley and H. S. Murdoch, had taken their places on stage within the box set and were waiting for the curtain to rise. Claxton was lying on a pallet of straw, looking up. Actors Mary Ann Farren and Claude Burroughs were waiting in the wings for their entry cues.|$|E
25|$|Due {{to a lack}} {{of content}} restrictions, some of Japan's {{earliest}} adventure games were also bishoujo games with eroge content. In 1982, Koei released Night Life, the first commercial erotic computer game. It was a graphic adventure, with sexually explicit images. That same year, they released another eroge title, Danchi Tsuma no Yuwaku (Seduction of the Condominium Wife), which was an early adventure game with color graphics, owing to the eight-color palette of the NEC PC-8001 computer, and role-playing video game elements. It became a hit, helping Koei become a major software company. Other now-famous companies such as Enix, Square and Nihon Falcom also produced similar eroge in the early 1980s before they became famous for their mainstream role-playing games. In some of their early eroge, the adult content is meaningfully integrated into a thoughtful and mature storyline, though others often used it as <b>a</b> <b>flimsy</b> excuse for pornography.|$|E
25|$|Only limited artefactual {{evidence}} survives of {{the users}} of Acheulean tools {{other than the}} stone tools themselves. Cave sites were exploited for habitation, but the hunter-gatherers of the Palaeolithic also possibly built shelters such as those identified in connection with Acheulean tools at Grotte du Lazaret and Terra Amata near Nice in France. The presence of the shelters is inferred from large rocks at the sites, {{which may have been}} used to weigh down the bottoms of tent-like structures or serve as foundations for huts or windbreaks. These stones may have been naturally deposited. In any case, <b>a</b> <b>flimsy</b> wood or animal skin structure would leave few archaeological traces after so much time. Fire was seemingly being exploited by Homo ergaster, and would have been a necessity in colonising colder Eurasia from Africa. Conclusive evidence of mastery over it this early is, however, difficult to find.|$|E

25|$|The male will {{courtship}} {{feed the}} female to reinforce their pair-bond or {{to secure a}} mating opportunity. The nest is a well concealed cup of dry grass that is positioned in a deep scrape {{at the base of}} a grass tuft or against a shrub. <b>A</b> <b>flimsy</b> or substantial grass dome (typical of Mirafra and related genera) covers the nest while leaving a front entrance. The cup is lined with finer plant material, and 2 to 3 (rarely 4) eggs are laid. The eggs are white, cream or pink in colour, and speckled brown and grey, especially near the blunter end. The chicks have bright yellow gapes, three black tongue spots, and a spot near the tip of the lower mandible. They are covered in pale grey to buff down, and are brooded by the female only. The incubation period is about 14 to 15 days, and singing by the male decreases as incubation commences. The young are fed by both parents, though mainly by the female. Surviving chicks leave the nest after about 12 days, before they are able to fly. Post-breeding moult has been recorded in mid December in Botswana and from July to August in Kenya.|$|E
25|$|Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade, {{the third}} {{film in the}} popular Indiana Jones series, went through <b>a</b> <b>flimsy</b> {{scripting}} process before Boam was hired to write a draft. As early as 1984, George Lucas was playing {{with the concept of}} having the fictional archeologist-adventurer encounter the fabled Holy Grail, the cup said to have been used by Jesus Christ during the Last Supper. Director Steven Spielberg rejected Lucas's script outlines, disliking the Grail idea. Screenwriter Diane Thomas wrote a haunted house story for Indiana Jones, but Spielberg said that after producing Poltergeist, he didn't want to do a similar film. Lucas hired Chris Columbus to write a draft for the film, and he submitted Indiana Jones and the Lost City of Sun Wu Kung, a story with evil spirits, ghosts, and demons. Again, Spielberg rejected the story as not believable enough. Lucas convinced him {{to go back to the}} Holy Grail idea, and Menno Meyjes was hired to develop another screenplay. The new script focused on the Arthurian legend aspect of the Holy Grail. Although the script was not to the liking of Lucas and Spielberg, it had elements that eventually became part of the finished film: the Holy Grail, and the introduction of Indiana Jones' father, Henry Jones, Sr.|$|E

500|$|In August, Wood {{was driven}} {{around the town}} by a young painter from Eldon, John Sharp, looking for inspiration. Sharp's brother {{suggested}} in 1973 that it was on this drive that Wood first sketched {{the house on the}} back of an envelope. Wood did not immediately regard the house as beautiful, but he did find it captivating. His earliest biographer, Darrell Garwood, noted that Wood [...] "thought it a form of borrowed pretentiousness, a structural absurdity, to put a Gothic-style window in such <b>a</b> <b>flimsy</b> frame house." [...] At the time, Wood classified it as one of the [...] "cardboardy [...] frame houses on Iowa farms" [...] and considered it [...] "very paintable." [...] After obtaining the permission of the Jones family, Wood made a sketch the next day in oil on paperboard from the house's front yard. This sketch displayed a steeper roof and a longer window with a more pronounced ogive than the actual house, features which eventually adorned the final work; however, Wood did not add figures to the sketch until he returned to Cedar Rapids. He would not return to Eldon again before his death in 1942, although he did request a photograph of the home to complete his painting.|$|E
500|$|The revamped concerts {{were also}} met with {{critical}} acclaim. Mark Savage from BBC Online reviewed {{the first of the}} revised performances in the United Kingdom. Savage described the concert as a hugely ambitious, terrifyingly loud show, [...] "spread over four acts and held together by <b>a</b> <b>flimsy</b> 'narrative' about Gaga and her dancer friends trying to get to a party." [...] He was also impressed that the entire spectacle was put together in just four weeks. MTV's James Montogomery reviewed the first North American performance of the tour in Montreal, Quebec, Canada. He said that the tour was [...] "packed with more wattage than an overheated power plant and more costume changes than a thousand Vegas reviews, it's the kind of show that leaves you with wide eyes, ringing ears, aching limbs and absolutely zero chance of making it to work in the morning." [...] New York Daily News writer Jim Farber expected that the theatricality of the show might have obscured the songs, but instead felt that Gaga's voice was perfect and the concert actually [...] "pushed Gaga a long way towards her obvious goal – to be the queen of this pop moment." [...] Glenn Gamboa from Newsday said that Gaga [...] "built her monster-sized fame on knowing how to create a spectacle and then having the substance to back it up. For every coat made of Kermit the Frog dolls or headdresses that covered her face in red lace, there was a stomping disco anthem or tender piano ballad to match. That back and forth is the centerpiece of her Monster Ball Tour." [...] Dan Aquilante from the New York Post was critical of the show, calling it [...] "scripted, silly, and tired, right down to Gaga's patter." [...] He added that the 15 costumes Gaga wore during the two-hour plus gig were [...] "more successful helping her cement the notion of an erotic and exotic otherworld." [...] Writing in the Telegram & Gazette, Craig S. Semon was appreciative of the show, calling it [...] "an out-of-this-world blast and end-of-the-world blow-out that must be seen to be believed." ...|$|E
