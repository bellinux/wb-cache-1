40|$|In {{this paper}} I {{question}} whether the plea for depathologisation and the regaining of our expropriated subjectivity from its psy and neuro-colonization is, in fact, not itself enmeshed {{with the notion of}} some real core of the human being, and thus amenable to some or another Academic discipline and praxis. Critics of mainstream (neuro) psychology could unwittingly, then, join the strong but unacknowledged undercurrent in today‘s neuropsydiscourses to restore the subject as a fully fleshed-out agent; one who is situated beyond pathology, beyond abnormal and normal. I juxtapose this observation with critical readings of an artistic project looking to revalue subjectivity {{in the aftermath of a}} mining disaster, and the popular Theory of Mind-approach. In conclusion, I argue that an understanding of the subject as caught between subjectivation and de-subjectivation (where subjectivity becomes a social <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>political</b> <b>issue)</b> could allow us to rethink the terms of normality and pathology...|$|E

The move towards reshoring has been driven by the equalisation of wage rates in Asia and the softening of labour attitudes in western manufacturing countries, specifically in North America: where recently some runaway plants returned home, and there are some positive economic incentives to encourage more domestic sourcing. The paper discusses the current and future opportunities for Western companies in this scenario and suggests there is scope for collaboration between Asian and Western organisations...|$|E

The remainder of the chapter is devoted to data derived from a qualitative study concerned with the body in pregnancy, childbirth and early motherhood. Earle argues that there are competing discourses which serve to structure women's experiences and perceptions of breastfeeding. Furthermore, she argues that gendered expectations and conflict in relation to women's sexual and maternal identities can cause tension, as can the competing pressure to breastfeed versus the importance of including the father in childcare. In conclusion, Earle leaves us with a question, namely: is the breastfeeding women empowering herself by doing what comes naturally or is the mother who uses formula milk making positive choices about her life and the care of her children...|$|E

This was a process rather reminiscent of the academic discovery of poverty in the sixties [1. Poverty Studies in the Sixties. A Selected and Annotated Bibliography. U. S. Department of Health, Education and Welfare, Washington, D. C., 1970]. Like poverty, self-care had 'always been with us', but it had not been deemed worthy of scientific interest. Not only did this expose a gap within sociological research on health and medicine, it also gave new impetus to long-standing debates within sociology of knowledge and epistemiology. But not only academia discovered self-care. It was a key issue of the most influential social movement of the seventies, the women's movement, although often expressed in a terminology very different from that in academic quarters. And it was debated heavily in the medical system based on the growing popular interest in self-help and wellness.

40|$|The {{phenomenon}} {{known as}} premenstrual syndrome (PMS) has been researched across many disciplines including Psychology, Women 2 ̆ 7 s Health, Women 2 ̆ 7 s Studies and Sociology.

In this project, I have examined narrative accounts of PMS as told by eight women who identify themselves as women who report experiencing the phenomenon. Findings suggest that these women view PMS as a complex phenomenon. They seem to view this phenomenon as both a 2 ̆ 2 thing, 2 ̆ 2 something that has a bodily nature and bodily symptoms, and also as a label.

40|$|The {{global burden}} of stroke is of continual major {{importance}} for global health. The present report addresses {{some of the}} core principles that could make stroke prevention work. The prevention of stroke shares many common features with other non-communicable diseases (NCDs); stroke prevention should therefore {{be part of the}} joint actions on NCD led by the WHO and member states. Stroke prevention {{is an integral part of}} both the 2011 UN declaration on actions on NCDs and the UN Post- 2015 Sustainable Developmental Goals. Stroke prevention requires an intersectoral approach, with important responsibilities on the part of governmental bodies, non-government organizations and the health sector as well as communities, industries and individuals. Although official development assistance will need to be provided for the lowest income countries, financing will need to be raised for most countries by reallocation of resources within the country. Stroke is a prototype NCD in that there is overwhelming scientific evidence that with actions taken to reduce risk factors, the risk of stroke can be substantially reduced. Prevention of stroke will also have beneficial effects on cognitive decline and dementia. As most strokes do not lead to death, stroke statistics should not only focus on mortality, but also on disability and quality of life. All preventive actions should start early in life and continue during the life cycle. Prevention of stroke is a complex medical <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>political</b> <b>issue</b> with many challenges.

Food is no longer simply a primary necessity for survival, it is a leisure and family activity, the participation in which, takes up {{a considerable amount of}} time. Today, food is a social <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>political</b> <b>issue</b> - something about which people have opinions, be it food quality, healthiness, or the food supply itself. It is also central to consumer's self-image. There is a large sector of the economy which supplies food demand, and this sector is itself now under considerable scrutiny from the consumer. This thesis examines consumer behaviour and attitudes towards food, with particular reference to the health aspects of food issues. It describes a programme of qualitative and quantitative research - group discussions, personal interviews and postal questionnaires. The programme examines milk (particularly low fat milk) as a diet and health case study; knowledge about food; attitudes towards food; the food industry and related issues; shopping behaviour and eating habits. It is important to both the consumer and the supplier of food, that consumer behaviour and attitudes are understood as fully as possible. This research highlights the misunderstandings between consumer and producer, emphasises the mistrust of the consumer for the producer and concludes with the need for communication between them. The thesis discusses the background to diet and health as an issue, describes the development of the current consumer environment and gives a profile of today's consumer. It then goes on to detail the research - two quantitative surveys, each undertaken over two years and a series of group discussions. The final section summarises the findings of each individual piece of the programme as a whole for various groups: food Oroducers; food manufacturers; food retailers; advertisers; the media; health professionals; the consumer; consumer organisations and government...|$|E
40|$|While {{hotly debated}} in {{political}} contexts, abortion has seldom figured in explicit terms in either literature or {{film in the}} United States. An exception is John Irving’s 1985 novel The Cider House Rules, which treats abortion insistently and explicitly. Although soon thirty years old, The Cider House Rules still functions as an important voice in the ongoing discussion about reproductive rights, responsibili-ties, and politics. Irving represents abortion as primarily a women’s health issue <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>political</b> <b>issue,</b> but also stresses the power and responsibility of men in abortion policy and debate. The novel rejects a “prolife” stance {{in favor of a}} women’s rights perspective, and clearly illustrates that abortion does not preclude or negate motherhood. This article discusses Irving’s novel in order to address abortion as a political issue, the gender politics of fictional representations of abortion, and the uses of such representations in critical practice. A brief introduction to the abortion issue in American cultural representation and in recent US history offers context to the abortion issue in Irving’s novel. The analysis focuses on abortion as it figures in the novel, and on how abortion figures in the criticism of the novel that explicitly focuses on this issue. The article argues that twentyfirst century criticism of Irving’s text, by feminist scholars as well as explicitly anti-feminist pro-life advocates, demonstrate the pervasive influence of antiabortion discourses illustrates, since these readings of Irving’s novel include, or reactively respond to, the fetal rights discourse and the “awfulization of abortion. ” The article further proposes that the novel’s representations of reproductive rights issues – especially abortion – are still relevant today, and that critical readings of fictional and nonfictional representations of reproductive rights issues are central to feminist poli-tics...|$|E
40|$|In {{terms of}} the current South African Constitution (Act 108 of 1996) South Africa has eleven {{official}} languages (RSA, 1996 : 4). The past political South African history and the constitutional status of these languages could cause language problems comparable to those at the Tower of Babel. Adding to {{the problem is the}} fact that in South Africa, language is an emotional <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>political</b> <b>issue.</b> South African citizens believe that English should be the only medium of communication in South Africa because English is a universally indispensable language. This, however, is not an idea that finds general approval. There is a great need to explore the language requirements and difficulties experienced in South African multilingual and multicultural hospitals, {{especially in the case of}} people speaking indigenous South African languages, namely Sesotho, Sesotho Sa Leboa, Setswana, Ndebele Swati, Tshivenda, Xitsonga, Xhosa and Zulu. The aim of this study is thus to study the translation and interpreting shortcomings and needs that exist and make recommendations for intervention and improvement. In the framework of the principle of multilingualism, multiculturalism and the promotion of the use of all eleven South African official languages is supported in this thesis. The main focus of this thesis is, therefore, the identification of translation and interpreting difficulties and the suggestion of the remedies and solutions for these language related problems. Language planning is mainly concerned with solutions to language related problems, therefore this study should be regarded as a language planning activity. In terms of this thesis, the principles of language panning are described, types of language planning, steps of language planning mainly step one, data accumulation, the responsibility of the language planner and the language planning already done in South Africa. In order for one to make suggestions it is necessary to first identify the translation and interpreting problems in the South African health fraternity. The Minister of the DAC, the honorable Dr Ben Ngubane, launched the South African Language Policy and Plan on 18 – 19 March 2003. However, there is still an urgent need for a Language in Health Policy (LiHeP) which will specifically cater for the South African health needs. A language analysis will expose that there is a break in communication between the hospital personnel and their clients in multilingual – multicultural hospitals. This is a problem with wide-reaching and potentially dangerous consequences. The hospital personnel and their clients often do not understand each others’ languages and there are, as yet, no formal or even informal measures to combat this. Instead, the use of hospital staff and other individuals who have an inkling of the target language are used as interpreters. The hospital staff and other individuals acting as hospital interpreters create yet more problems as these people are not trained to be professional health interpreters. Some of these people are not even first language speakers of the target language. The result is that most of the time there is misinterpretation of the messages, for example the term ‘stool’ referring to faeces, is often interpreted as ‘chair’ which confuses the patients. This type of error, could result in a serious breakdown of communication which may be fatal. Doctors that come to South Africa from countries like Cuba also encounter communication problems due to lack of knowledge of the major South African languages. There is also sometimes resistance from the non-qualified interpreters to perform interpretation tasks as there is no financial reward for doing this. The resistance causes negative attitudes resulting to not executing the interpreting task properly. In chapter four the difficulties and problems revealed by the empirical studies conducted in a multilingual - multicultural hospitals will be discussed. The views of the hospital staff are reflected in the answers to the questionnaires which they were requested to complete. These views are discussed at length together with the identified problems. Translation and interpreting are closely related practices, however the distinction between them is explored. These concepts both form the main focus of this thesis at different levels. Interpreting seems to dominate because most of the communication is verbal. Nevertheless, translation does feature when pamphlets and medicines are given to clients for personal use within and outside the hospital premises. The criteria that translators and interpreters have to meet as well as literary overview concerning problems in health with regard to translation and interpreting are addressed. Emanating from the data accumulated, suggestions are made in the final chapter as to how these language problems can be solved. A feasible suggestion to solve the problems in the field of interpreting is to have well trained health interpreters. Different aspects surrounding the issue of the training of the interpreters is dealt with and recommendations are made in the final chapter.
