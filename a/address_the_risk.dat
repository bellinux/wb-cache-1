5|$|Many {{different}} {{sources of information}} can motivate discussion about HIV/AIDS among married couples. After hearing information about HIV/AIDS at local health facilities or during conversations with friends or family members, {{people are more likely}} to <b>address</b> <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> of HIV contraction with their spouses. In addition, women are more likely than men to mention the dangers of HIV/AIDS when they suspect that their spouses are engaging in extramarital sexual relations. According to a 2003 study by Eliya Msiyaphazi Zulu and Gloria Chepngeno, although higher levels of education do correspond to greater knowledge about HIV/AIDS, education levels do not significantly impact the likelihood that couples will discuss HIV-related prevention strategies.|$|E

They speculated that the pilot, a recovered stroke victim, may have fallen asleep or had a seizure, but there was no direct evidence to support these theories.

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to discuss the {{implementation}} of effective risk-based anti-money laundering (AML) /combating the financing of terrorism (CFT) systems of control in order to properly <b>address</b> <b>the</b> <b>risks</b> facing <b>the</b> financial services industry. It seeks to argue that most systems of controls currently in place are ineffective and bureaucratic and do not <b>address</b> <b>the</b> real <b>risks.</b> Design/methodology/approach – <b>The</b> paper outlines the recent history of AML/CFT measures and the underlying reasons for their adoption. It then argues that if risk-based is to be adopted a methodology to <b>address</b> <b>the</b> <b>risks</b> must first be designed. The paper outlines the pre-requisites for the design of such a system and the factors that need to be considered for implementation. The paper highlights the need for regulators to fall in line with the risk-based approach and to pass back to senior management responsibility for the implementation of systems of control which are appropriate and proportionate. Findings – Most of the current systems of control in AML/CFT are driven by regulatory requirements and not an understanding of <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> facing <b>the</b> firm. Originality/value – The paper is original work of the Financial Services Commission in its entirety.
