5|$|Ann Rule began {{corresponding}} with Green in 1996, {{and interviewed}} her in person in 1997.

Green claimed that though her behavior {{in the summer and}} fall of 1995 had been neglectful, she had neither the desire nor the wherewithal to set fire to her house or harm her children or her husband. Rule—who was neither a doctor nor <b>a</b> <b>psychologist,</b> but had a background in criminology and law enforcement—believed that even Green does not understand what caused her to attempt to murder Michael Farrar beyond {{the fact that she had}} come to hate him. Rule's theory was that in destroying Farrar, Green would have been able to preserve her own ego, in that Farrar would not have been able to leave her for another woman. Psychiatrist Michael H. Stone, using Rule's book as a source of information about Green, identifies Green as showing characteristics of psychopathy, borderline personality disorder, and narcissistic personality disorder.|$|E

5|$|George Malcolm Stratton (September 26, 1865– October 8, 1957) was <b>a</b> <b>psychologist</b> who {{pioneered the}} study of {{perception}} in vision by wearing special glasses which inverted images {{up and down and}} left and right. He studied under {{one of the founders of}} modern psychology, Wilhelm Wundt, and started one of the first experimental psychology labs in America, at the University of California, Berkeley. Stratton's studies on binocular vision inspired many later studies on the subject. He was one of the initial members of the philosophy department at Berkeley, and the first chair of its psychology department. He also worked on sociology, focusing on international relations and peace. Stratton presided over the American Psychological Association in 1908, and was a member of the National Academy of Sciences.

40|$|The {{primary goal}} {{of the current study}} was to extend {{previous}} research suggesting that coaches are the primary gatekeepers who may be a barrier to working with athletes by examining high school coaches likelihood to refer to, interest in, and intention to hire <b>a</b> sport <b>psychologist.</b> Specifically, the current study examined relationships between high school coaches’ sex, age, and type of sport coached (i. e., contact vs. non-contact) and their likelihood to refer athletes to <b>a</b> sport <b>psychologist</b> for <b>a</b> variety of presenting issues (i. e., poor attentional focus, poor leadership, family issues, etc.). It also examined relationships between coaches’ sex, age, and type of sport coached (i. e., contact vs. non-contact) and their interest in working with <b>a</b> sport <b>psychologist.</b> Finally, the study examined reasons why coaches did not plan to hire <b>a</b> sport <b>psychologist.</b> An examination of the possible reasons that high school coaches do not plan to hire <b>a</b> sport <b>psychologist</b> served <b>an</b> exploratory purpose. Participants included 450 coaches who coached high school sports in the United States. Results indicated that female coaches and non-contact sport coaches were more likely to refer athletes to <b>a</b> sport <b>psychologist</b> for <b>a</b> variety of referral issues than male coaches and coaches of contact sports. Similarly, significantly more female coaches and non-contact sport coaches showed interest in working with <b>a</b> sport <b>psychologist</b> than male coaches and coaches of contact sports. Coaches who did not plan to hire <b>a</b> sport <b>psychologist</b> reported that cost, lack authority to hire, and lack of availability as primary reasons. Implications of the findings, limitations, and future directions are discussed...|$|R
