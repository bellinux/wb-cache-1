5|$|Bryce Hendrie, whose {{office was}} {{next door to}} Louis Champion's, had been {{appointed}} commanding officer of the Rhodesian contingent to attend the coronation of King George V on 22 June 1911. Before his departure to England, he offered Guest the management of his practice during his absence. Hendrie's brother was an estate agent and put all his property transfers through the firm, so Guest gained much valuable experience, especially in conveyancing, through <b>a</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>cases</b> in the High Court, in the Magistrate's Court and in the Court of the Mining Commissioner.|$|E

Many telephones, including most cell phones, and Internet access were inoperable because of line breaks, destruction of base stations, or power failures, even though some base stations had their own back-up generators. In <b>a</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>cases,</b> reporters were asked to brief public officials on the conditions in areas where information was not reaching them any other way.|$|E
5|$|In 1805, Captain Dixon {{lost all}} of his {{property}} and moved the family to Henderson, Kentucky. Archibald Dixon was educated by his mother and attended the common schools of Henderson. In 1822, he began to study law {{in the office of}} James Hillyer. He was admitted to the bar in 1824, and commenced practice in Henderson.

In <b>a</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>cases,</b> {{death has}} {{occurred}} within 24 {{hours of the}} onset of the infection, while other cases do not last longer than around five days. The virus attacks endothelial cells, rupturing capillaries and causing blood loss and haemorrhaging; once this reaches the heart, the haemorrhage kills quickly through shock. Symptoms include lethargy and an unwillingness to eat, a rapid heartbeat, and decreased blood-cell count, as well as cyanosis of the tongue, mouth ulcers, and oedema of the head and trunk.|$|E
5|$|The Mari Lwyd custom was {{performed}} during wither festivities, specifically around {{the dates of}} Christmas and New Year. However, the precise date on which the custom {{was performed}} varied between villages, and in <b>a</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>cases</b> the custom was carried out for several consecutive nights. There is a unique example provided by an account from Gower in which the head was kept buried throughout the year, only being dug up for use during the Christmas season.|$|E
5|$|The {{affected}} {{animals are}} mostly young Asian elephants {{that had been}} born in captivity, with half the cases in North America being between the ages of one and four years (and three-quarters between one and eight years old). Some cases have affected newborns or adult elephants born in the wild (oldest aged 40 years), and three recorded cases have affected African elephants. The first documented fatal case for African elephants was Kijana, an eleven-month-old male in 1996. Since 2008, <b>a</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>cases</b> have been attributed to EEHV1 among wild Asian elephants.|$|E

5|$|Since first {{coming to}} wide {{notice in the}} late 1990s, the Harry Potter book series by J. K. Rowling has engendered a number of legal disputes. Rowling, her various {{publishers}} and Time Warner, {{the owner of the}} rights to the Harry Potter films, have taken numerous legal actions to protect their copyrights, and also have fielded accusations of copyright theft themselves. The worldwide popularity of the Harry Potter series has led to the appearance of a number of locally produced, unauthorised sequels and other derivative works, sparking efforts to ban or contain them. While these legal proceedings have countered <b>a</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>cases</b> of outright piracy, other attempts have targeted not-for-profit endeavours and have been criticised.|$|E
5|$|The {{first case}} of a fatal form of the disease was {{documented}} in 1995, though tissue samples from {{as early as the}} 1980s have since tested positive for the virus, and localized skin lesions in wild African elephants were recorded in the 1970s. Since 1995, there have been over fifty documented disease cases in North America and Europe, of which only nine have been successfully cured. Those affected are mostly young animals born in captivity, though a small number of older wild-born adults held in zoos have died, and <b>a</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>cases</b> caused by the same pathogenic type of EEHV have been identified in both orphan and wild calves in Asian elephant populations.|$|E
5|$|During the 1790s, {{politicians}} and land speculators in Georgia perpetrated fraudulent and corrupt land sales {{in an area}} that is now a large portion of Alabama and Mississippi. When the fraud was exposed in 1795, there was significant public outcry, and the Georgia legislation authorizing the sales was repealed. This led to a host of claims and litigation, since in <b>a</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>cases,</b> land was afterward resold to unsuspecting third parties. President Jefferson eventually established a three-person commission to resolve conflicting claims arising from the fraud. Lincoln was appointed to this commission, which developed legislation to resolve the issue. Eventually approved by Congress, Georgia's claims to the area were extinguished and some land was reserved to resolve other outstanding claims. The commission was also responsible for documenting and reporting on {{the nature and extent of}} the fraud, activities in which Lincoln was heavily involved.|$|E

5|$|German philosopher G. W. F. Hegel {{presented}} {{two main}} criticisms of Kantian ethics. He first argued that Kantian ethics provides no specific {{information about what}} people should do because Kant's moral law is solely a principle of non-contradiction. He argued that Kant's ethics lack any content and so cannot constitute a supreme principle of morality. To illustrate this point, Hegel and his followers have presented <b>a</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>cases</b> in which the Formula of Universal Law either provides no meaningful answer or gives an obviously wrong answer. Hegel used Kant's example of being trusted with another man's money to argue that Kant's Formula of Universal Law cannot determine whether a social system of property is a morally good thing, because either answer can entail contradictions. He also used the example of helping the poor: if everyone helped the poor, {{there would be no}} poor left to help, so beneficence would be impossible if universalised, making it immoral according to Kant's model. Hegel's second criticism was that Kant's ethics forces humans into an internal conflict between reason and desire. For Hegel, it is unnatural for humans to suppress their desire and subordinate it to reason. This means that, by not addressing the tension between self-interest and morality, Kant's ethics cannot give humans any reason to be moral.|$|E
5|$|The game {{takes place}} in the city of Los Angeles, in the year 1947, with players {{assuming}} the role of Los Angeles Police Department officer, and later detective, Cole Phelps. The game starts with Phelps as a uniformed patrolman, and follows his career as he advances through the police department bureaus (desks) of Traffic, Homicide, Vice and Arson. Each desk gives players a new partner who will help Phelps in his investigation of <b>a</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>cases</b> based on a specific type of crime. The game assigns players with cases that they must solve. After each case, players receive a rating of 1â€“5 stars depending on their performance in both interrogations and searching for clues. In some cases, when searching an area for clues to the crime, players can also find newspapers. Besides reading the story, the newspapers give access to a short cinematic that either covers a part of the game's overarching plot or a flashback to Phelps' war memories. Near the end of the final desk, players assume control of private investigator Jack Kelso, who becomes the player character for {{most of the rest of}} the game; although different in appearance and personality, he controls identically to Phelps.|$|E
5|$|The {{majority}} of cases (60â€“80%) are not precipitated by a particular cause. A quarter {{has a history of}} high blood pressure, but this is a common problem in the general population, and {{it is not clear whether}} it significantly increase the risk of apoplexy. <b>A</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>cases</b> has been reported in association with particular conditions and situations; it is uncertain whether these were in fact causative. Amongst reported associations are surgery (especially coronary artery bypass graft, where there are significant fluctuations in the blood pressure), disturbances in blood coagulation or medication that inhibits coagulation, radiation therapy to the pituitary, traumatic brain injury, pregnancy (during which the pituitary enlarges) and treatment with estrogens. Hormonal stimulation tests of the pituitary have been reported to provoke episodes. Treatment of prolactinomas (pituitary adenomas that secrete prolactin) with dopamine agonist drugs, as well as withdrawal of such treatment, has been reported to precipitate apoplexy.|$|E

5|$|In some cases, danger listing {{has sparked}} {{conservation}} efforts and prompted {{the release of}} funds, resulting in a positive development for sites such as the GalÃ¡pagos Islands and Yellowstone National Park, {{both of which have}} subsequently been removed from the List of World Heritage in Danger. Despite this, the list itself and UNESCO's implementation of it have been the focus of criticism. In particular, States Parties and other stakeholders of World Heritage Sites have questioned the authority of the Committee to declare a site in danger without their consent. Until 1992, when UNESCO set a precedent by placing several sites on the danger list against their wishes, States Parties would have submitted a programme of corrective measures before a site could be listed. Instead of being used as intended, the List of World Heritage in Danger is perceived by some states as a black list and according to Christina Cameron, Professor at the School of Architecture, Canada Research Chair on Built Heritage, University of Montreal, has been used as political tool {{to get the attention of}} States Parties. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) notes that UNESCO has referenced the List of World Heritage in Danger (without actually listing the site) in <b>a</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>cases</b> where the threat could be easily addressed by the State Party. The Union also argues that keeping a site listed as endangered over a long period is questionable and that other mechanisms for conservation should be sought in these cases.|$|E
