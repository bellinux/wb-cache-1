He was interested, though, to see Beryl Burton, and his old acquaintance Reg Harris pulling at his pipe in the invited audience.|$|E

I believe that wall will crumble when the Negro has brought himself to a high educational and economic status…. Moreover, while there are no segregation laws in the North, there is segregation in fact and we might as well recognize this.|$|E

Even the word Sarah he could not pronounce at first, but had to spell it, and I would pronounce it for him.|$|E

500|$|By {{the same}} 8-1 majority, the Court found a {{separate}} and independent {{ground for the}} reversal of Burton's convictions. Burton had requested certain jury instructions, which the trial judge had delivered. But, along with the requested instructions, the trial judge had stated that: [...] " [...] asked by counsel for the defendant to give certain declarations here, <b>and</b> <b>while</b> <b>I</b> think they have, in the main, been covered by the charge, yet I will give them to you[...] [...] [...] These are abstract propositions of law, which I give {{in connection with the}} charge, as perhaps more fully amplifying it. I am willing to give them, inasmuch as they are asked, and they contain general propositions of law." ...|$|E
500|$|In Sherrybaby, Gyllenhaal {{played a}} young drug-addicted thief {{trying to put}} her life in order after prison so she can {{reconcile}} with her daughter. During promotion of the film, she noted of her portrayal of the character: [...] "I think she's in such dire straights [...] that all she has are these kind of naive, fierce hope. <b>And</b> <b>while</b> <b>I</b> was playing the part I was looking for pleasure and hope in everything, even in these really bleak things. And {{so it was really}} mostly after I finished the movie that I felt pain." [...] Her performance in the film was well received: David Germain of the Associated Press wrote, [...] "Gyllenhaal humanizes her so deeply and richly... that Sherry elicits sympathy even in her darkest and weakest moments", and Dennis Harvey of Variety called her performance [...] "naturalistic". For her work, Gyllenhaal earned her second Golden Globe Best Actress nomination and won the Best Actress category award at the 2006 Stockholm International Film Festival.|$|E
500|$|Eileen Lulevitch, {{entertainment}} reviewer for TV Guide, {{was generally}} favorable of the episode, writing, [...] "Watching the season premiere tonight was like welcoming {{an old friend}} back into your home. It was so easy to slip back into Grey's world and {{get caught up in}} all of the amazing moments that make this show so much fun to watch. <b>And</b> <b>while</b> <b>I</b> expected the night to start off on a somber note, by addressing Cristina and Burke's fallout, I was pleasantly surprised by the way the attendees paid tribute to Bailey, by giving their new interns the same exact first-day speech Bailey had given them." [...] Lulevtich praised Meredith's story arc, noting the surprising turn her character evolution has taken, as she praised Lexie's introduction. While expressing a negative perspective on the writers' decision to have Torres be the Chief Resident, instead of Bailey, Lulevitch described Torres' adjustment to her new position as one of the episode's focal points. Despite praising Yang's storyline in the personal background, the concept of her interaction with the patient she was assigned to was regarded as predictable and obvious, [...] "When the man's family came to see him, and Cristina told them it could be for the very last time. It was that moment that really got Cristina thinking about how much she did in fact miss Burke, as we later learned in the episode." [...] Writing for IGN, Laura Burrows was favorable of the episode. Regarding the storylines developed in [...] "A Change Is Gonna Come", Burrows elaborated, [...] "The season opener was promising in that it had the interns in a new role and introduced a new side of George. As all of his friends progressed from interns to residents, George was forced to re-sit his internship. This created new drama and also opened up the hospital to {{a whole new set of}} interns rife with their own set of emotional baggage and drama. There were a series of interesting and new plots." ...|$|E
2500|$|But, {{towards the}} Buddha, {{who came from}} the Sakyan people, King Pasenadi reveres, praises, and serves the Buddha with utmost respect. Even the monarch thinks like this: [...] "The Shramana Gotama had perfect birth, <b>while</b> <b>I</b> am not perfect. The Shramana Gotama is mighty, <b>while</b> <b>I</b> am weak. The Shramana Gotama {{inspired}} awe <b>and</b> respect, <b>while</b> <b>I</b> do not. The Shramana Gotama is vastly influential <b>and</b> charming, <b>while</b> <b>I</b> only possess small influence." [...] As even the King respects Dhamma, reveres Dhamma, and obeys Dhamma, therefore he bows and praises the Tathagatha.|$|R

2500|$|Protected by {{the powers}} of the boiling rivulet, Dante and Virgil {{progress}} across the burning plain. They pass a roving group of Sodomites, and Dante, to his surprise, recognizes Brunetto Latini. Dante addresses Brunetto with deep and sorrowful affection, [...] "paying him the highest tribute offered to any sinner in the Inferno", thus refuting suggestions that Dante only placed his enemies in Hell. Dante has great respect for Brunetto and feels spiritual indebtedness to him and his works ("you taught me how man makes himself eternal; / <b>and</b> <b>while</b> <b>I</b> live, my gratitude for that / must always be apparent in my words"), Brunetto prophesies Dante's bad treatment by the Florentines. He also identifies other sodomites, including Priscian, Francesco d'Accorso, and Bishop Andrea de' Mozzi.|$|E

2500|$|Edson left Charleston for New York in 1927 in {{an attempt}} to revive his career, but his recent {{publishing}} failure and long absence from the city undermined his efforts. Times were changing as well, and his style of writing was losing its appeal. He earned some money by ghostwriting the story of prize fighter Abe the Newsboy. The Life Story of Abe the Newsboy was published in 1930 and still in print in 1960, but Edson received no royalties. By the end of his final stay in New York, Edson was destitute. Robert Marks reported to a mutual acquaintance: “I feel sorry as hell for old Edson. I’ve seen him fairly often, <b>and</b> <b>while</b> <b>I</b> like him a lot I think he’s pretty hopeless. He is neither fish, flesh, fowl, nor good red herring. He has made enemies of everyone, has no practical sense, and little social poise.” ...|$|E

During the 2013 MTV VMAs pre-show, the four remaining members of Danity Kane announced that they were reuniting, returning on their own terms without Diddy. They announced that a single would be released soon titled [...] "Rage", produced by The Stereotypes, the same producers who were responsible for Danity Kane's biggest single to date, [...] "Damaged". Original group member D. Woods did not take part in the reunion. Although no reason was given for the absence, she has stated: [...] "It has been brought to my attention that my former group members of Danity Kane will be reuniting <b>and</b> <b>while</b> <b>I</b> will not {{be a part of the}} reunion, I wish the ladies blessings and much success on their endeavors." ...|$|E

In response to the legal action, Piquet Jr. stated [...] "Because I am telling the truth I have nothing to fear, whether from the Renault team or Mr Briatore – <b>and</b> <b>while</b> <b>I</b> am well aware of the power and influence of those being investigated, and the vast resources at their disposal, I will not be bullied again into making a decision I regret".|$|E

2500|$|Originating in {{northern}} England and Scotland, these dogs {{came with the}} first settlers to reach the American colonies. American farmers appreciated this versatile breed and used dogs to protect their farms and livestock. The English Shepherd and various other collies were {{also referred to as}} Scotch Collie's during the 18th and 19th centuries but the term [...] "Scotch Collie" [...] fell out of favor during the 20th century. Quoting from Leon F. Whitney early in the 20th century ("How to Breed Dogs", 1937, no ISBN) [...] "It is known variously as the farm shepherd, the barnyard collie, the old fashioned shepherd, the cow dog, the English Shepherd, and other colloquial names. <b>And</b> <b>while</b> <b>I</b> doubt there is a more alert, trustworthy, or American dog, still no breed specialty clubs have organized to push it. It is the ordinary shepherd that one sees on farm after farm throughout the country." [...] (Despite the publication date of 1937 given here English Shepherds were registered as a breed before that time through UKC (1927) and probably the defunct Southeastern Kennel Club before then.) ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{film was}} {{released}} {{less than six}} months after Gibson's 2006 DUI incident, where the director made antisemitic comments to police after being stopped on suspicion of drunk driving; the incident garnered Gibson much negative publicity and magnified concerns some had over alleged antisemitism in his previous film, The Passion of the Christ. [...] Several key film critics alluded to the incident in their reviews of Apocalypto: In his positive review, The New York Times A. O. Scott commented: [...] "say what you will about him – about his problem with booze or his problem with Jews – he is a serious filmmaker." [...] The Boston Globe review came to a similar conclusion, noting that [...] "Gibson may be a lunatic, but he's our lunatic, <b>and</b> <b>while</b> <b>I</b> wouldn't wish him {{behind the wheel of a}} car after happy hour or at a B'nai Brith function anytime, behind a camera is another matter." [...] In a negative review, Salon.com noted [...] "People are curious about this movie because of what might be called extra-textual reasons, because its director is an erratic and charismatic Hollywood figure who would have totally marginalized himself by now if he didn't possess a crude gift for crafting violent pop entertainment." ...|$|E
2500|$|In Congress, Barr {{became famous}} for his [...] "dour" [...] image and told constituents, [...] "You don't send me to Washington to smile." [...] He also said in a radio {{interview}} [...] "If it's not in the Constitution, I won't smile". He later explained [...] "I don't consider politicians who smile to be worth {{a heck of a}} lot... all things considered, it doesn't make a dime's worth of difference if the politicians in Washington smile or not, what matters is how much of your hard-earned dollars they take to spend in pure pork". Barr said in 2010 [...] "I can see a situation where the federal government is going to bring an entire suitcase of San Francisco values to the American family, <b>and</b> <b>while</b> <b>I</b> would love to explain all the things that are wrong with that, the fact {{is that this is a}} corrupting, left-leaning, influence on a section of society that so many liberal elites want to see taken out of the 'red state' column. The only solution to this kind of behavior is dour and austere social conservatism, like my own". Adding to his image, Barr has frequently protested about [...] "cult hairstyles", saying [...] "I cannot abide by people who adopt a cult hairstyle, or persistently dress inappropriately for meetings with me".|$|E
2500|$|The anime {{adaptation}} of the series has received critical acclaim by reviewers. Jacob Hope Chapman from Anime News Network praised the cast and studio Bones' work. Additionally, he liked the consistency in quality and commented [...] "The contiguous threads laced through these episodic adventures are beginning to converge fast, <b>and</b> <b>while</b> <b>I</b> can't see the full picture yet, I know Rie Matsumoto is building the anime-original material of Leo's romance into something special. The animation continues to be jaw-dropping. The music continues to be soul-warming. There's never enough time in one writeup to talk about everything that makes the episode so damn good. Blood Blockade Battlefront continues to be The Very Best." [...] Jarius Taylor from the Fandom Post called it [...] "both ridiculously cool and ridiculously weird" [...] and praised the cast like Chapman. In a later review he said [...] "It’s still not entirely clear what this show is going for yet but for now it’s a good ride and I have more than enough faith in the people behind it to believe the destination will be worthwhile." [...] Rachael Verret, a writer from The Mary Sue, gave the series a perfect score having pointed out its [...] "energy and joviality" [...] seen through the cast and the ending sequences which reminded her of another series, Baccano!. Similarly, Chapman wrote an article titled [...] "Three Reasons Why Blood Blockade Battlefront is the Best Show of the Spring" [...] commenting [...] "It's the coolest, cutest, and cleverest anime I've {{seen in a long}} time, easily the best new show of the Spring 2015." ...|$|E
