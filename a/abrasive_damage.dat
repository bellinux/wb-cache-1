40|$|Currently, {{there is}} no appropriate, standardized, {{accelerated}} test method to investigate the abrasion resistance of components of solar energy systems under sand storm conditions. Therefore, this paper deals {{with the development of}} a test method for the investigation of the sand abrasion mechanism on selected solar technical components. For this purpose, first, the mechanisms of surface damage induced by trickling sand are experimentally investigated. The designed method based on ASTM D 968 - 05 enables to describe the sand abrasion mechanisms on aluminum reflectors and solar glasses. Also, differences in the abrasion resistance of the samples are revealed. In addition to changes in their optical properties, an increased surface roughness can be determined. Depending on the impact angle, hardness of the exposed material, sand trickling mass and sand concentration, different surface changes are caused. The concentrated particle stream led to strong <b>abrasive</b> <b>damage</b> on the reflector surfaces, whereas glasses show a better abrasion resistance to trickling sand because of their higher hardness. The second, horizontal test method designed according to the sandblasting principle allows a more realistic investigation of the sand abrasion process on samples under strong wind conditions.

40|$|Normal (e. g., adhesion) {{and lateral}} (friction) forces were {{measured}} between physisorbed and chemically grafted layers of hyaluronic acid (HA), an anionic polyelectrolyte {{in the presence}} of lubricin (Lub), a mucinous glycoprotein, on mica surfaces using a surface forces apparatus (SFA). This work demonstrates that high friction coefficients between the surfaces do not necessarily correlate with surface damage and that chemically grafted HA acts synergistically with Lub to provide friction reduction and enhanced wear protection to the surfaces. Surface immobilization of HA by grafting is necessary for such wear protection. Increasing the concentration of Lub enhances the threshold load that a chemically grafted HA surface can be subjected to before the onset of wear. Addition of Lub does not have any beneficial effect if HA is physisorbed to the mica surfaces. Damage occurs at loads less than 1 mN regardless of the amount of Lub, indicating that the molecules in the bulk play little or no role in protecting the surfaces from damage. Lub penetrates into the chemically bound HA to form a visco-elastic gel that reduces the coefficient of friction as well as boosts the strength of the surface against <b>abrasive</b> wear (<b>damage)</b> ...|$|R

Their conclusion was that walnut shells were the superior choice of air abrasive, because it had all of the same benefits as glass beads, but none of the negative side effects.|$|R

The concentration of cartilage debris present in the lubricant was assessed by measuring the bound sulphate originating from the glycosaminoglycans by ion chromatography.

Other experimental evidence suggested that cartilage scratched in vivo was no more susceptible to further in vitro damage in this experimental model than normal cartilage.

A deep-etching method {{is applied to}} study the detailed morphologies of the eutectic carbides by optical microscopy (OM) and field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM). The types of the eutectic carbides were identified by X-ray diffraction (XRD) as V-rich eutectic MC and Mo-rich eutectic M 2 C. Single-pass scratch tests were carried out on polished and deep-etched surfaces of the specimens to investigate the micro-scale wear behavior of the eutectic carbides with and without protection by the matrix phase. It was found that, when a surrounding matrix is present, the micro-cracks initiate from the eutectic region during the scratch tests and slip-lines appear in scratched edges of the matrix phase. Without matrix protection as revealed in the deep-etched specimens, the main failure form is carbide dendrites break-off forming wear debris. The detailed differences in response and deformation mode of carbide microstructures with/without matrix support to single-point abrasion behavior are schematically depicted for main eutectic MC and M 2 C carbides under different loading conditions.

In this system, grinding wheel is driven by the high-power electric servomotor with a built-in rotary encoder so that both grinding operation and consecutive measurement of the individual abrasive grains by the accurate wheel positioning are possible. The contraction/expansion process is useful for the separation of adjacent grains. The dark field microscopy is effective in order to extract monochromatic CBN grains from the lustrous metal bond. This system is applicable to the practical grinding operation with resinoid and metal bonded superabrasive wheels with a good degree of accuracy and efficiency. In grinding normally sintered silicon nitride with the resinoid-bonded diamond wheel at a given grinding condi-tion, this system reveals that cutting-edge ratio decreases rapidly due to the micro-fracture of grain tips at the transient stage just after truing/dressing, and it increases slightly with the promotion of attritious wear under the successive steady state.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this master’s thesis was to, {{by the use of}} nanotechnology, improve {{material}} properties of the biomedical polymer Optim™, used as the insulation of pacemaker leads. Improved material properties are required to reduce the extent of fibrous encapsulation of the leads. Today, laser ablation is {{used to be able to}} remove the pacemaker lead because of the fibrous tissue, which can cause the lead to adhere to vascular structures. Consequently, the laser ablation results in risks of damaging cardiovascular structures. Moreover, improved material properties are needed to reduce the friction at the surface and enhance the wear resistance. Large wearing occurs between the lead and the titanium pacemaker shell as well as lead against lead and the wearing can result in a damaged insulation, which in turn might result in removal of the device. To achieve these improved material properties a hierarchically micro- and nanostructured and superhydrophobic surface was fabricated and to enhance the wear resistance, nanocomposites with 1 wt % and 5 wt % added hydroxyapatite nanoparticles were fabricated. The surface structures were fabricated via hot embossing and plasma treatment and were characterised with atomic force microscopy, environment scanning electron microscopy and with contact angle measurements. To evaluate the biological response to the surfaces, adsorption of radioisotope labelled human serum albumin proteins and adhesion of the human fibroblast cell line MRC- 5 were studied. The results show that a superhydrophobic surface, with contact angle as high as 170. 0 ± 0. 4 °, can be fabricated via hierarchically micro- and nanostructures on an Optim™ surface. The fabricated surface is more protein resistant and cell resistant compared to a smooth surface. The nanocomposites fabricated, especially the one with 5 wt % nanoparticles added, show an enhanced abrasive wear resistance compared to Optim™ without added nanoparticles. In conclusion, a hierarchically micro- and nanostructured superhydrophobic surface of the pacemaker lead seems promising for reducing the extent of fibrous encapsulation and by fabricating a nanocomposite, the <b>abrasive</b> wear <b>damage</b> of the lead insulation can be reduced...|$|R

Energy is generally derived either through direct combustion or gasification. The Irish forestry sector is forecasted to expand significantly in coming years, and so the opportunity exists for the bioenergy sector {{to take advantage of}} the material for which there will be no demand from current markets. A by-product of wood processing, wood dust is the cheapest form of wood material available to the bioenergy sector. Currently wood dust is primarily processed into wood pellets for energy generation. Research was conducted on post-processing birch wood dust; the calorific value and the Wobbe Index were determined for a number of wood particle sizes and wood dust concentrations. The Wobbe Index determined for the upper explosive concentration (4000 g/m 3) falls within range of that of hydrogen gas, and wood dust-air mixtures of this concentration could therefore behave in a similar manner in a gas turbine.

Samples were taken at 0, 10, and 120 minutes and fixed for electron microscopy. Initial motility of approximately 70 % decreased to approximately 10 % over 2 hours. The first motile spermatozoa without acrosomal caps were seen after 6 minutes, and by 90 minutes approximately 60 % of motile spermatozoa {{had completed the}} acrosome reaction. The first sign of the reaction (by TEM) appears to be swelling and cavitation of the acrosomal matrix within the apical and principal segments, followed or possibly accompanied by fusion and fenestration of the outer acrosomal and plasma membranes and dispersion of the matrix except from the equatorial segment. The end-product of the reaction thus conforms to that seen in other eutherian mammals. However, the reaction exposes a uniquely moulded organization of subacrosomal material ("pseudoperforatorium"), shaped like an anvil over the rostral rim of the flattened nucleus and encased by the remaining inner acrosomal membrane. This has two "lateral" spikes on each side that extend approximately to the same width as the head {{in the region of}} the equatorial segment. While these barbs could serve to stabilize or anchor the apical segment of the acrosome, their exposure following the acrosome reaction suggests some specific mechanical role in penetration of the zona pellucida or in protecting more caudal structures from <b>abrasive</b> <b>damage...</b>|$|E
40|$|WhisperGenTM {{heater head}} {{components}} are currently machined from the {{austenitic stainless steel}} Sandvik 253 MA. The inner surface of the heater heads is subjected to the working gas of the engine, which is a high-pressure, high-temperature nitrogen-based environment with carbonaceous impurities. As {{a result of this}} exposure, a scale forms during operation and eventually spalls. This spalled scale causes <b>abrasive</b> <b>damage</b> to piston seals and guides, which leads to pressure loss and eventual failure of the engine. The aim of the present work was to compare the performance of the austenitic alloy 253 MA with two alternative alloys, Incoloy 800 H and AISI 310, thereby enabling a material recommendation. A literature review provided information about many general aspects of high temperature corrosion in similar alloys. However, little was found about the application of these alloys in environments similar to those experienced by a WhisperGenTM heater head. Therefore, laboratory experiments were conducted to indicate the relative performance characteristics of the three potential alloys (253 MA, Incoloy 800 H and AISI 310). To overcome the difficulties with testing at high temperatures and pressures, Thermo-Calc™ was used to calculate gas mixtures at 1 bar that approximated the chemical potentials of carbon and nitrogen in the working gas at 24 bar. Comparisons of the different materials were made via weight loss/gain measurements and metallographic analysis, which included optical microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, X-ray mapping and electron back scatter diffraction (EBSD). The laboratory test sample results were also compared with results from heater heads of the same materials that were run in an actual WhisperGenTM engine. The experimental results taken in total indicate that 253 MA is the least suitable alloy for the heater head application because it exhibited poor spalling performance, internal oxidation and formation of a large amount of Cr 23 C 6. AISI 310 was shown in all cases to develop the detrimental sigma phase, although this alloy was the least susceptible to internal oxidation. Incoloy 800 H was the most resistant alloy to all forms of degradation and is thus recommended for the heater head application...|$|E

Spark eroded samples were electropolished and characterized before and after each polishing treatment. Surface damage was then produced with spark erosion and <b>abrasive</b> wearing. Surface <b>damage</b> stabilizes and pins a dense twin-microstructure and prevents twins from coarsening. The density of twins increases with increasing degree of surface deformation. Twinning stress and hardening rate during mechanical loading increase with increasing surface damage and twin density. In contrast, when a damaged surface layer is removed, twinning stresses, hardening rate, and twin density decrease. Constraining the sample by mounting and guiding reduces the magnetic-field-induced strain by locking twins at the constrained surfaces. For single-domain crystals and for hard magnetic shape-memory alloys, external constraints strongly reduce the magnetic-field-induced strain and the fatigue lifetime is short. In contrast, for selfaccommodated martensite and for soft magnetic shape-memory alloys, the twin-microstructure adapts well to external constraints and the fatigue lifetime is long.

Filter materials from the lithium hydroxide (LiOH) canisters from the Apollo Command Module were also studied to determine the amount and type of any lunar dust particles they may have captured from the spacecraft atmosphere. The specific spacesuit study materials include the outermost soft fabric layers on Apollo 12 and 17 integrated thermal micrometeorite garment assemblies and outermost fabrics on Apollo 17 extravehicular pressure gloves. In addition, the degree of surface wear in the sealed wrist rotation bearing from Apollo 16 extravehicular and intravehicular pressure gloves was evaluated and compared. Scanning electron microscope examination of the Apollo 12 T- 164 woven TeflonO fabric confirms the presence of lunar soil particles and the ability of these particles to cause separation and fraying of the Teflon fibers. Optical imaging, chemical analysis and particle sampling applied to the outer fabric of the Apollo 17 spacesuit has identified Ti as a potentially useful chemical marker for comparing the amount of lunar soil retained on different areas of the spacesuit outer fabric. High-yield particle sampling from the Apollo 17 fabric surfaces using adhesive tape found 80 % of particles on the fabric are lunar soil particles averaging 10. 5 m in diameter, with the rest being intrinsic fabric materials or environmental contaminants. Analysis of the mineralogical composition of the lunar particles found that on a grain-count basis the particle population is dominated by plagioclase feldspar and various types of glassy particles derived mostly from soil agglutinates, with a subordinate amount of pyroxene. On a grain size basis, however, the pyroxene grains are generally a factor of 2 larger than glass and plagioclase, so conversion of the data to a modal (volume %) basis results in pyroxene becoming the modally dominant particle type with glass and plagioclase significantly less abundant. When comparisons are made to the modal composition of lunar soil at the Apollo 17 landing site, the results suggest that pyroxene particles have overall better retention on the spacesuit outer fabric compared to plagioclase and especially glass. Scanning electron microscopy revealed no measureable difference in the amount of wear and abrasion in the wrist rotation bearing of an Apollo 16 pressure glove worn only in the spacecraft and one worn only for extravehicular activity on the lunar surface.

40|$|The {{development}} of a mechanically stable, functionally graded Ti-doped a-C:H interface layer in combination with a functional a-C:H coating requires a reduction of the brittle phases which induce generally problems in the transitions from Ti to TiC/a-C:H. The core objective {{of this study was}} to develop an optimum interlayer between the substrate and the functional top layer for biomedical applications, namely for tooth implants. Since the interlayer may be exposed to the sliding process, in the case of local failure of the top layer it has to fulfil the same criteria: biocompatibility, high wear resistance and low friction. The functional Ti-C:H layers with thickness in the range 2. 5 – 3. 5 ?m were deposited by a magnetron sputtering/PECVD hybrid process by sputtering a Ti-target in a C 2 H 2 + Ar atmosphere in dc discharge regime. The sets of coating samples were prepared by varying the C and H concentrations controlled by the C 2 H 2 flow during the deposition process. The tribological properties were evaluated on a pin-on-disc tribometer at room temperature (RT) and at 100 °C using 440 C balls with a diameter of 6 mm. The tests at 100 °C were performed to investigate the effect of the sterilization temperature on the tribological properties and the coating lifetime as well. The tribological performance was examined with respect to the friction coefficient, the wear rates of the coating and the counter-parts and the analysis of the wear debris. The Ti/C ratio decreased almost linearly from 4. 5 to 0. 1 with increasing C 2 H 2 flow; the hydrogen content showed a minimum of 5 at. % at C 2 H 2 flow of 30 sccm, while for lower flows it was about 10 at. %.

The technology itself is a system which uses magnetic principles to remove regolith dust from its surface. This project was to create an enclosure that will be used to demonstrate the effectiveness of the invention to The Office of the Chief Technologist. ONE of the most important challenges of space exploration is actually caused by something very small and seemingly insignificant. Dust in space, most notably on the moon and Mars, has caused many unforeseen issues. Dirt and dust on Earth, while a nuisance, can be easily cleaned and kept at bay. However, there is considerably less weathering and erosion in space. As a result, the microscopic particles are extremely rough and abrasive. They are also electrostatically charged, so they cling to everything they make contact with. This was first noted to be a major problem during the Apollo missions. Dust would stick to the spacesuits, and could not be wiped off as predicted. Dust was brought back into the spacecraft, and was even inhaled by astronauts. This is a major health hazard. Atmospheric storms and other events can also cause dust to coat surfaces of spacecraft. This can cause <b>abrasive</b> <b>damage</b> to the craft. The coating can also reduce the effectiveness of thermal insulation and solar panels. ' A group of engineers at Kennedy Space Center's Electrostatics and Surface Physics Laboratory have developed a new technology, called the Electrodynamic Dust Shield, to help alleviate these problems. It is based off of the electric curtain concept developed at NASA in 1967. "The EDS is an active dust mitigation technology that uses traveling electric fields to transport electrostatically charged dust particles along surfaces. To generate the traveling electric fields, the EDS consists of a multilayer dielectric coating with an embedded thin electrode grid running a multiphase low frequency AC signal. Electrostatically charged particles, such as those encountered on the moon, Mars, or an asteroid, are carried along by the traveling field due to the action of Coulomb and dielectrophoretic forces. " 2 The technical details have been described in a separate article. This document details the design and construction process of a small demonstration unit. Once finished, this device will go to the Office of the ChiefTechnologist at NASA headquarters, where it will be used to familiarize the public with the technology. 1 NASA KSC FO Intern, Prototype Development Laboratory, Kennedy Space Center, University of Central Florida Kennedy Spac...|$|E
