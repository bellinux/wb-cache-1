5|$|The United States is {{the only}} <b>advanced</b> <b>economy</b> that does not {{guarantee}} its workers paid vacation {{and is one of}} just a few countries in the world without paid family leave as a legal right, with the others being Papua New Guinea, Suriname and Liberia. While federal law currently does not require sick leave, it is a common benefit for government workers and full-time employees at corporations. 74% of full-time American workers get paid sick leave, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, although only 24% of part-time workers get the same benefits. In 2009, the United States had the third-highest workforce productivity per person in the world, behind Luxembourg and Norway. It was fourth in productivity per hour, behind those two countries and the Netherlands.|$|E

25|$|The {{emergence}} of more advanced states and intensified competition between them spurred {{on the development}} of advanced galleys with multiple banks of rowers. During the middle of the first millennium BC, the Mediterranean powers developed successively larger and more complex vessels, the most advanced being the classical trireme with up to 170 rowers. Triremes fought several important engagements in the naval battles of the Greco-Persian Wars (502–449 BC) and the Peloponnesian War (431-404 BC), including the battle of Aegospotami in 405 BC, which sealed the defeat of Athens by Sparta and its allies. The trireme was an advanced ship that was expensive to build and to maintain due its large crew. By the 5th century, advanced war galleys had been developed that required sizable states with an <b>advanced</b> <b>economy</b> to build and maintain. It was associated with the latest in warship technology around the 4th century BC and could only be employed by an advanced state with an <b>advanced</b> <b>economy</b> and administration. They required considerable skill to row and oarsmen were mostly free citizens who had years of experience at the oar.|$|E
25|$|The {{economic}} transformation also altered income structure. A noticeable shift was {{the reduction in}} wage differentials. The increased wealth produced by an <b>advanced</b> <b>economy</b> was distributed to wage earners via the system of broad income agreements that evolved in the postwar era. Organized {{sectors of the economy}} received wage hikes even greater than the economy's growth rate. As a result, blue-collar workers' income came, in time, to match more closely the pay of lower level white-collar employees, and the income of the upper middle class declined in relation to that of other groups.|$|E

40|$|This paper casts {{light on}} the ongoing debate about whether {{emerging}} markets have decoupled from <b>advanced</b> <b>economies.</b> The proponents of the decoupling hypothesis argue that emerging markets have made significant progress in reducing external vulnerabilities, strengthening domestic policy frameworks, and achieving stronger domestic demand growth, thereby leading to lower business cycle comovements with <b>advanced</b> <b>economies.</b> This view runs against extensive empirical evidence showing that globalization, namely rising trade and financial integration, raises business cycle synchronisation. We find that decoupling is a myth: business cycle synchronicity between emerging markets and <b>advanced</b> <b>economies</b> has generally not declined in recent years. ...|$|R
40|$|This paper first compares house price cycles in <b>advanced</b> and {{emerging}} <b>economies</b> {{using a new}} quarterly house price dataset covering the period 1990 - 2012. It is found that that house prices in emerging economies grow faster, are more volatile, less persistent and less synchronized across countries than in <b>advanced</b> <b>economies.</b> They also correlate more closely with capital flows than in <b>advanced</b> <b>economies.</b> The analysis is then conditioned on an exogenous change to global liquidity, broadly understood {{as a proxy for}} the international supply of credit. It is found that in emerging markets a global liquidity shock has a much stronger impact on house prices and consumption than in <b>advanced</b> <b>economies.</b> Finally, holding house prices constant in response to this shock tends to dampen its effects on consumption in both <b>advanced</b> {{and emerging}} <b>economies,</b> but possibly through different channels: in <b>advanced</b> <b>economies</b> by boosting the value of housing collateral and hence supporting domestic borrowing, and in emerging markets by appreciating the exchange rate and hence supporting the international borrowing capacity of the economy...|$|R

There is evidence of instability in the variance decomposition of the real exchange rates for <b>advanced</b> <b>economies</b> across samples, with a growing importance of nominal shocks.

40|$|Among {{the sources}} of {{non-energy}} GHG emissions from the <b>advanced</b> <b>economies,</b> agriculture is the largest, followed by waste and industrial processes. 1 Gross nonenergy emissions {{are estimated to be}} 15. 4 % of all GHG emissions from the <b>advanced</b> <b>economies</b> in 2010. The relative importance of gross non-energy emissions in total GHG emissions is tending to decline because of the slow growth in emissions from waste and agriculture.

The expansion of forestry has been cutting net non-energy emissions to less than half of gross emissions.
