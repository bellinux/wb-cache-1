5|$|We {{first learned}} about the facilitator/courier's nom de guerre from a detainee not in CIA custody in 2002. It is <b>also</b> <b>important</b> <b>to</b> <b>note</b> that some detainees who were {{subjected}} to enhanced interrogation techniques attempted to provide false or misleading information about the facilitator/courier. These attempts to falsify the facilitator/courier's role were alerting. In the end, no detainee in CIA custody revealed the facilitator/courier's full true name or specific whereabouts. This information was discovered through other intelligence means.|$|E
5|$|People {{receiving}} dimercaprol need to {{be assessed}} for peanut allergies since the commercial formulation contains peanut oil. Calcium EDTA is also effective if administered four hours after the administration of dimercaprol. Administering dimercaprol, DMSA (Succimer), or DMPS prior to calcium EDTA is necessary to prevent the redistribution of lead into the central nervous system. Dimercaprol used alone may also redistribute lead to the brain and testes. An adverse side effect of calcium EDTA is renal toxicity. Succimer (DMSA) is the preferred agent in mild to moderate lead poisoning cases. This {{may be the case}} in instances where children have a blood lead level >25μg/dL. The most reported adverse side effect for succimer is gastrointestinal disturbances. It is <b>also</b> <b>important</b> <b>to</b> <b>note</b> that chelation therapy only lowers blood lead levels and may not prevent the lead-induced cognitive problems associated with lower lead levels in tissue. This may be because of the inability of these agents to remove sufficient amounts of lead from tissue or inability to reverse preexisting damage.|$|E
25|$|There is {{evidence}} that shows that glutamine is transferred across the root interface, following the assimilation of ammonium by the fungus. However, the pathways responsible for this conversion are largely unknown, though there are several plausible hypotheses. It is <b>also</b> <b>important</b> <b>to</b> <b>note</b> that the net transfer of nutrients to plants requires three transport components: 1) the soil-fungus interface, 2) the fungus-apoplast interface, and 3) the apoplast-root cell interface.|$|E
5000|$|It is <b>important</b> <b>also</b> <b>to</b> <b>note</b> {{the special}} {{position}} of the following: ...|$|R
30|$|It is <b>also</b> very <b>important</b> <b>to</b> <b>note</b> {{that the}} {{electron}} and hole confinement in vertically coupled QDs is significantly increased {{as compared to}} the wetting layer and matrix continuum, further improving temperature stability of the QD luminescence.|$|R
50|$|<b>Also,</b> it is <b>important</b> <b>to</b> <b>note</b> {{that the}} {{anatomical}} size of tentorial notches vary considerably between individuals; however, very little evidence supports {{that a more}} narrow notch creates a predisposition towards Kernohan's notch.|$|R
25|$|The second destruction, in the 5th century, is {{even more}} problematic. It {{has been argued that}} the fire or fires could be accidental. It is <b>also</b> <b>important</b> <b>to</b> <b>note</b> that {{although}} the Heuneburg plateau is mostly abandoned at this time, as is the Aussensiedlung, smaller settlements develop in the surrounding area and burial activity continues, perhaps suggesting a change in the focus of settlement activity, possibly connected with sociopolitical changes at that time.|$|E
25|$|Following the riot, {{people were}} {{initially}} {{concerned about the}} role that social media may have played in fueling the riot. Christopher Schneider, a sociologist from the University of British Columbia says {{that there is not}} a lot of evidence to support that theory. <b>Also</b> <b>important</b> <b>to</b> <b>note</b> is that it can be difficult to discern sarcasm from honest, real intentions online. Social media did, however, play a large role during and after the riot.|$|E
25|$|Where {{intrusive}} underwater excavation is appropriate, silts and sediments can {{be removed}} from an area of investigation using a water dredge or airlift. When used correctly, these devices have an additional benefit in tending to improve the visibility {{in the immediate vicinity}} of the investigation. It is <b>also</b> <b>important</b> <b>to</b> <b>note</b> that for very deep sea excavation submarines are sometimes used to view sites. Underwater photography can also be conducted from these submarines which assists the recording process.|$|E
50|$|<b>Also,</b> it is <b>important</b> <b>to</b> <b>note</b> that marking of {{subjects}} and objects occurs {{only on the}} verb, not on any nouns which may fill those roles as constituents. Agreement can {{take the place of}} pronouns, thus the language has pro-drop.|$|R
5000|$|In an upset, perhaps exhaling {{after his}} good fortune, he lost to Maurice Lachance, in a ten round non-title {{decision}} in Hartford, Connecticut. The referee gave every round to the challenger, who was down only {{briefly in the}} eighth, but knocked down Terranova briefly in the seventh. Lachance used his two inch reach advantage and five pound weight advantage to his benefit. It may <b>also</b> be <b>important</b> <b>to</b> <b>note</b> that Lachance was a southpaw, having the ringname [...] "Lefty", which made him more dangerous to a less experienced boxer.|$|R
50|$|The {{ablative}} {{is generally}} not presented as a separate grammatical case in traditional Latvian grammars, because it appears exclusively with prepositions. One can say instead that prepositions requiring the genitive in the singular require the dative in the plural. <b>Also</b> it is <b>important</b> <b>to</b> <b>note</b> that the Latvian ablative case is not an archaism but rather an innovation.|$|R
25|$|CD+G, DVD, VCD and microphone-based {{players are}} most popular for home use. Due to song {{selection}} {{and quality of}} recordings, CD+G {{is the most popular}} format for English and Spanish. It is <b>also</b> <b>important</b> <b>to</b> <b>note</b> that CD+G has limited graphical capabilities, whereas VCD and DVD usually have a moving picture or video background. VCD and DVD are the most common format for Asian singers due to music availability and largely due to the moving picture/video background.|$|E
25|$|The {{technique}} {{is limited to}} imaging 1 to 2mm below the surface in biological tissue, because at greater depths the proportion of light that escapes without scattering {{is too small to}} be detected. No special preparation of a biological specimen is required, and images can be obtained ‘non-contact’ or through a transparent window or membrane. It is <b>also</b> <b>important</b> <b>to</b> <b>note</b> that the laser output from the instruments is low – eye-safe near-infra-red light is used – and no damage to the sample is therefore likely.|$|E
25|$|The agriculture, fishery and {{forestry}} (AFF) {{sector is}} Caraga's banner economic sector, exhibiting an increasing growth trend of 3.8% and 6.8% growth rates in 2001 and 2003 respectively. Despite the decreasing growth {{trend of the}} agriculture and fishery subsectors, the sizeable growth rate of the forestry subsector more than compensated for the decrease. The forestry subsector grew by 36.3% in 2003, the highest growth rate for any subsector in the region. It is <b>also</b> <b>important</b> <b>to</b> <b>note</b> that Caraga Region has the highest GVA in the forestry subsector among all regions in the Philippines.|$|E
50|$|In {{examining}} the statistics of chronic disease among the living elderly, it is <b>also</b> <b>important</b> <b>to</b> make <b>note</b> of the statistics pertaining to fatalities {{as a result}} of chronic disease. Heart disease {{is the leading cause of}} death from chronic disease for adults older than 65, followed by cancer, stroke, diabetes, chronic lower respiratory diseases, influenza and pneumonia, and, finally, Alzheimer’s disease. Though the rates of chronic disease differ by race for those living with chronic illness, it is interesting <b>to</b> <b>note</b> that the statistics for leading causes of death among elderly are nearly identical across racial/ethnic groups.|$|R
50|$|As {{with all}} cases of hyponatremia, extreme caution {{must be taken}} to avoid the fatal {{consequences}} of rapidly correcting electrolytes (e.g. Central pontine myelinolysis, edema). Special considerations with the treatment of potomania are needed. Because this could be a chronic condition, low sodium may be normal for the patient, so an especially careful correction is warranted. It is <b>also</b> very <b>important</b> <b>to</b> <b>note</b> that due <b>to</b> the normal kidney function, and lack of other intrinsic or toxic cause of the electrolyte disturbance, restoration of dietary solutes will correct the electrolytes to normal serum levels. This again must be done with caution.|$|R
5000|$|In 2000, Dreamworks {{released}} {{their first}} major label material, [...] "The Space Cadet" [...] EP. This was followed {{the next year}} {{with the release of}} their full length self-titled album. The album's single, Lover Undercover, never caught on however, and the label soon dropped them. Tobias claims this was {{due to the fact that}} the single was released on September 9, and after 9/11 no one was in the mood for a happy go lucky, pop band. <b>Also,</b> its <b>important</b> <b>to</b> <b>note</b> that Dreamworks, new to the music business, didn’t do nearly enough to promote the band, and their biggest promotion came as a cameo in the movie Road Trip.|$|R
25|$|Tenerife, {{like the}} other islands, has {{maintained}} {{a close relationship with}} Latin America, as both were part of the Spanish Empire. From the start of the colonization of the New World, many Spanish expeditions stopped at the island for supplies {{on their way to the}} Americas. They also recruited many tinerfeños for their crews, who formed an integral part of the conquest expeditions. Others joined ships in search of better prospects. It is <b>also</b> <b>important</b> <b>to</b> <b>note</b> the exchange in plant and animal species that made those voyages.|$|E
25|$|Esperanto is {{estimated}} to have approximately 100,000 to 2 million fluent speakers. In the same manner estimates {{for the number of}} Ido speakers are far from accurate, but 500 to a few thousand is most likely. It is <b>also</b> <b>important</b> <b>to</b> <b>note</b> the distinction between the number of speakers compared to the number of supporters; the two languages resemble each other enough that a few weeks of study will enable one to understand the other with little difficulty, {{and there are a number}} of people that have learned Ido out of curiosity but prefer to support the larger Esperanto movement and vice versa.|$|E
25|$|The {{study and}} {{observation}} of plants {{has been of}} high importance to the Maya for centuries. However, the study of medicinal plants {{was limited to the}} priestly class. Plants and herbal remedies were often used in collaboration with other techniques to cure disease. Knowledge of the effects of certain plants on human beings was often used to prescribe an antidote to a particular ailment, but it is <b>also</b> <b>important</b> <b>to</b> <b>note</b> that medicine men also frequently relied on the color of a plant or other remedy in certain situations. For instance, yellow plants and fruits were used in curing jaundice; red for problems characterized by blood; and burned feathers of red birds in curing yellow fever.|$|E
50|$|After the {{publication}} of the Kaitai Shinsho, there was besides the development in medical science, the progress of the comprehension of the Dutch language. <b>Also,</b> it is <b>important</b> <b>to</b> <b>note</b> that Japan, even under its extreme isolationist policies, still had some foundation to understand the products of Western culture. It also helped to give a chance for promotion for such talents as those of Ōtsuki Gentaku.|$|R
30|$|It <b>also</b> is <b>important</b> <b>to</b> <b>note</b> that FORECAST Climate {{does not}} account for the {{potential}} impacts of climate change on the activity of other disturbance agents. There is evidence that both biotic (insects and pathogens) and abiotic (fire and wind) disturbance are influenced by climate change (van Mantgem and Stephenson 2007; Mutch and Parsons 1998). O’Grady et al. (2013) pointed out that trees suffering from soil-water deficits are more susceptible to biotic disturbance agents due to significant changes in the energy and carbon balance of the plants. Thus, the predicted increases in Chinese fir plantations associated with climate change may not be realised if changes in climate regime lead to increased mortality from biotic and abiotic disturbance agents.|$|R
2500|$|During assessment, {{individuals}} may exhibit activation responses in which {{reminders of the}} traumatic event trigger sudden feelings (e.g., distress, anxiety, anger), memories, or thoughts relating to the event. Because {{individuals may}} not yet be capable of managing this distress, {{it is necessary to}} determine how the event can be discussed {{in such a way that}} will not [...] "retraumatize" [...] the individual. It is <b>also</b> <b>important</b> <b>to</b> take <b>note</b> of such responses, as these responses may aid the clinician in determining the intensity and severity of possible posttraumatic stress as well as the ease with which responses are triggered. Further, it is <b>important</b> <b>to</b> <b>note</b> the presence of possible avoidance responses. Avoidance responses may involve the absence of expected activation or emotional reactivity as well as the use of avoidance mechanisms (e.g., substance use, effortful avoidance of cues associated with the event, dissociation).|$|R
25|$|This {{explanation}} of Ubay {{also makes it}} very clear that the Companions did not differ at all about what was part of the Quran and what {{was not part of the}} Quran when the revelation had ceased. It is <b>also</b> <b>important</b> <b>to</b> <b>note</b> that the hadith appeared in the mushaf of Ubay because it was for his own personal use, in other words, his private notebook, where he did not always distinguish between Quranic material and hadith, since it was not meant for general use and he himself knew well what to make of his own notes. The same is true of the other copies of the Quran, which some of the Companions had for their own personal use.|$|E
25|$|Elbow (Humeroulnar joint) – The biceps brachii also {{functions}} {{as an important}} flexor of the forearm, particularly when the forearm is supinated. Functionally, this action is performed when lifting an object, such as a bag of groceries or when performing a biceps curl. When the forearm is in pronation (the palm faces the ground), the brachialis, brachioradialis, and supinator function to flex the forearm, with minimal contribution from the biceps brachii. It is <b>also</b> <b>important</b> <b>to</b> <b>note</b> that regardless of forearm position, (supinated, pronated, or neutral,) the force exerted by the biceps brachii remains the same; however, the brachioradialis has a much greater change in exertion depending on position than the biceps during concentric contractions. That is, the biceps can only exert so much force, and as forearm position changes, other muscles must compensate.|$|E
25|$|This {{means that}} the {{population}} living in the Lusophone official area is around 280,000,000 inhabitants. This number {{does not include the}} Lusophone diaspora, estimated at approximately 10 million people (including 4.5 million Portuguese, 3 million Brazilians, and half a million Cape Verdeans, among others), although it is hard to obtain official accurate numbers of diasporic Portuguese speakers because a significant portion of these citizens are naturalized citizens born outside of Lusophone territory or are children of immigrants, and may have only a basic command of the language. It is <b>also</b> <b>important</b> <b>to</b> <b>note</b> that {{a large part of the}} diaspora is a part of the already-counted population of the Portuguese-speaking countries and territories, such as the high number of Brazilian and PALOP emigrant citizens in Portugal or the high number of Portuguese emigrant citizens in the PALOP and Brazil.|$|E
50|$|It is <b>also</b> <b>important</b> <b>to</b> take <b>note</b> {{of where}} other {{countries}} are on the rondel. A country whose next logical move would be to tax, invest, build a factory, or do some other innocuous activity is likely not an immediate military threat. On the other hand, if an opponent's country is about to move to taxation and end the game, it may be desirable to shut down its factories or otherwise reduce its tax base. Similarly, if all the pieces on the rondel have just passed investor, and every player has a country, one can make his move without fear of his own country immediately being bought out by someone else, {{because it will be}} awhile before anyone has another chance to invest.|$|R
3000|$|In this section, {{the average}} BER is {{computed}} {{to evaluate the}} performance of the studied systems. As shown in Section 2, the signal received on each subcarrier for each system depends on the used precoding scheme. <b>Also,</b> it is <b>important</b> <b>to</b> <b>note</b> that due <b>to</b> these precoding functions, the signal entries become statistically dependent on the channel realizations, hereby affecting the receive power level.

50|$|As of September 2014, the Department of Defense was {{estimated}} to have “$857 million in excess parts and supplies”. This figure has risen {{over the past years}} and of the Pentagon waste that has been calculated, two figures that are especially worth mentioning is the expenditure of “$150 million on private villas for a handful of Pentagon employees in Afghanistan and the procurement of the JLENS air-defense balloon” which, throughout the program’s development over the past two decades, is estimated to have cost $2.7 billion. <b>Also,</b> it is <b>important</b> <b>to</b> <b>note</b> that the JLENS air-balloon still does not function properly.|$|R
25|$|Treatment is cause-related, {{but also}} {{symptomatic}} if {{the underlying cause}} is unknown or not correctable. It is <b>also</b> <b>important</b> <b>to</b> <b>note</b> that most ulcers will heal completely without any intervention. Treatment can range from simply smoothing or removing a local cause of trauma, to addressing underlying factors such as dry mouth or substituting a problem medication. Maintaining good oral hygiene and use of an antiseptic mouthwash or spray (e.g. chlorhexidine) can prevent secondary infection and therefore hasten healing. A topical analgesic (e.g. benzydamine mouthwash) may reduce pain. Topical (gels, creams or inhalers) or systemic steroids {{may be used to}} reduce inflammation. An antifungal drug may be used to prevent oral candidiasis developing in those who use prolonged steroids. People with mouth ulcers may prefer to avoid hot or spicy foods, which can increase the pain. Self-inflicted ulceration can be difficult to manage, and psychiatric input may be required in some people.|$|E
25|$|The {{cause of}} some of the church's most {{damaging}} publicity {{had to do with the}} church's policy of discrimination toward blacks. Blacks were always officially welcome in the church, and Joseph Smith established an early precedent of ordained black males to the Priesthood. Smith was also anti-slavery, going so far as to run on an anti-slavery platform as candidate for the presidency of the United States. At times, however, Smith had shown sympathy toward a belief common in his day that blacks were the cursed descendants of Cain. In 1849, church doctrine taught that though blacks could be baptized, they and others could not be ordained to the Priesthood or enter LDS temples. Journal histories and public teachings of the time reflect that Young and others stated that God would some day reverse this policy of discrimination. It is <b>also</b> <b>important</b> <b>to</b> <b>note</b> that while blacks as a whole were specifically withheld from priesthood blessings (although there were some exceptions to this policy in both the 1800s and 1900s), other races and genealogical lineages were also prohibited from holding the priesthood.|$|E
25|$|Receptive {{females are}} the ones to locate male territories by {{examining}} tree-falls or large light gaps within their foraging ranges. Female E. imperialis behavior, when entering a territory, initially resembles that of an intruding male. The female flies up within 5cm of the resident male and hovers until the male flies out to investigate. The male and female then engage in a tight circular flight path, less than 20cm apart, until the female lands on the perch of the tree. The female then presses its body close to the tree trunk, with its wings held down. The male then lands on her dorsum to copulate with the female, which lasts a brief 5 seconds. After mating, the female then immediately leaves the territory. It is <b>also</b> <b>important</b> <b>to</b> <b>note</b> that mating only occurs in relatively solitary territories in which no other males are present. It is theorized that female E. imperialis possibly only mate once in their lifetime {{due to the fact}} that a very limited number of female foraging ranges actually overlap with any given male territory.|$|E
50|$|Such documentations provide {{evidence}} regarding safe, effective and ethical care and insinuates accountability for healthcare institutions and professionals. Furthermore, accurate documents provide a rigorous foundation for conducting appropriate {{quality of care}} analysis that can facilitate better health outcomes for patients. Thus, regardless of the format used to capture the clinical point of care information, these documents are imperative in providing safe healthcare. <b>Also,</b> it is <b>important</b> <b>to</b> <b>note</b> that electronic formats of clinical point of care documentation are not intended to replace existing clinical process but to enhance the current clinical point of care documentation process.|$|R
40|$|Firms are not atomistic {{hierarchies}} only {{linked with}} one another at arm’s-length distance in markets. Instead, a myriad of long-lived, highly cooperative relationships between suppliers and customers are pervasively found in the B 2 B world. And it is within those enmeshed relationships and networks that the co-evolution of capabilities and business specialisms is brought about and developed. If that is the actual ‘topography’ of the business landscape, then the coordination of economic activities in general, and the boundary decisions {{of each and every}} firm in particular, are unlikely to be reduced to a (dual) choice between ‘making’ or ‘buying’. Inter-firm cooperation is in itself a third governance structure, in alternative to the hierarchical and the market modes of coordination. And, what is <b>also</b> equally <b>important</b> <b>to</b> <b>note,</b> it is through the make-or-buy-or-cooperate decisions that the (embedded) firm is able to change its nature and scope, redefine its (fuzzy) boundaries, and thus adapt to an ever-changing business setting...|$|R
40|$|During {{the course}} of a program's execution, a {{processor}} performs many trivial computations; that is, computations that can be simplified or where the result is zero, one, or equal to one of the input operands. This paper shows that, despite compiling a program with aggressive optimizations (-O 3), approximately 30 % of all arithmetic instructions, which account for 12 % of all dynamic instructions, are trivial computations. The amount of trivial computation is not heavily dependent on the program's specific input values. Our results show that eliminating trivial computations dynamically at run-time yields an average speedup of 8 % for a typical processor. Even for a very aggressive processor (i. e. one with no functional unit constraints), the average speedup is still 6 %. It <b>also</b> is <b>important</b> <b>to</b> <b>note</b> that the area cost (i. e. hardware) required to dynamically detect and eliminate these trivial computations is very low, consisting of only a few comparators and multiplexers...|$|R
