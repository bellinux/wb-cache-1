This study aimed to evaluate the PCR assays targeting the 16 S ribosomal RNA gene (16 S rDNA) for detection of the GBS in comparison with a specific culture method. Materials and Methods Two swabs were used to obtain vaginal specimens from the 330 pregnant women <b>attended</b> <b>delivery</b> room at Hedayat hospital, Tehran, Iran. One swab was analyzed by direct plating onto selective GBS agar medium (ISLAM) and the other swab was used for a PCR assay, which amplified the 16 S rDNA of S. agalactiae. Comparative study between the selective culture and the PCR assay was done among the 330 tested women. Results The GBS colonization rate based on the culture results was 20. 6 % (68 / 330). Both culture and PCR methods were positive for 56 and negative for 253 women. The culture method was positive and PCR was negative in 12 women.

40|$|In 1999, {{prevention}} of mother-to-child transmission (pMTCT) using antiretrovirals {{was introduced in}} the Dominican Republic (DR). Highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) was introduced for immunosuppressed persons in 2004 and for pMTCT in 2008. To assess progress towards MTCT elimination, data from requisitions for HIV nucleic acid amplification tests for diagnosis of HIV infection in perinatally exposed infants born in the DR from 1999 to 2011 were analyzed. The MTCT rate was 142 / 1, 274 (11. 1 %) in 1999 – 2008 and 12 / 302 (4. 0 %) in 2009 – 2011 (), with a rate of 154 / 1, 576 (9. 8 %) for both periods combined. This decline was associated with significant increases in the proportions of women who received prenatal HAART (from 12. 3 % to 67. 9 %) and infants who received exclusive formula feeding (from 76. 3 % to 86. 1 %) and declines in proportions of women who received no prenatal antiretrovirals (from 31. 9 % to 12. 2 %) or received only single-dose nevirapine (from 39. 5 % to 19. 5 %). In 2007, over 95 % of DR pregnant women received prenatal care, HIV testing, and professionally <b>attended</b> <b>delivery.</b> However, only 58 % of women in underserved sugarcane plantation communities (2007) and 76 % in HIV sentinel surveillance hospitals (2003 – 2005) received their HIV test results.

40|$|Summary {{objective}} To {{identify the}} main drivers of costs of facility delivery {{and the financial}} consequences for households among rural women in Tanzania, {{a country with a}} policy of delivery fee exemptions. methods We selected a representative sample of households in a rural district in western Tanzania. Women who given birth within 5 years were asked about payments for doctor’s ⁄nurse’s fees, drugs, non-medical supplies, medical tests, maternity waiting home, transport and other expenses. Wealth was assessed using a household asset index. We estimated the proportion of women who cut down on spending or borrowed money ⁄ sold household items to pay for delivery in each wealth group. results In all, 73. 3 % of women with facility delivery reported having made out-of-pocket payments for delivery-related costs. The average cost was 6272 Tanzanian shillings (TZS), [95 % Confidence Interval (CI) : 4916, 7628] or 5. 0 United States dollars. Transport costs (53. 6 %) and provider fees (26. 6 %) were the largest cost components in government facilities. Deliveries in mission facilities were twice as expensive as those in government facilities. Nearly half (48. 3 %) of women reported cutting down on spending or borrowing money ⁄ selling household assets to pay for delivery, with the poor reporting this most frequently. conclusion Out-of-pocket payments for facility delivery were substantial and were driven by high transport costs, unofficial provider payments, and preference for mission facilities, which levy user charges. Novel approaches to financing maternal health services, such as subsidies for transport and care from private providers, are required to reduce the cost barriers to <b>attended</b> <b>delivery...</b>|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background: The Health Extension Program (HEP) {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{innovative}} community-based health programs launched by the Ethiopian Federal Ministry of Health (FMOH) to make health services accessible to rural communities by setting out women health extension workers (HEWs) in rural health posts. The program was officially rolled out in 2003 and become operational in 2004. Its approach is based on the assumption that access to and quality of primary health care in rural communities can be improved through transfer of health knowledge and skills to households. Deployed as pairs, the HEWs are premised to provide basic, largely preventive, primary health services to rural villages and empower families to take charge of their own health. Primarily, the program gives special attention to children and mothers. Objectives: The primary objective of this study was to evaluate the short and medium-term impact of the HEP on maternal and child health outcomes in Tigray region and analyze if the impact suggests that the region is moving in a direction towards achieving the 4 th and 5 th Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). Additionally, the study sought to provide some policy relevant insights into the performance of the program in the region. Methods: Using administrative data, the study estimated the impact of the HEP on child health variables (ex., child vaccines:-DPT 3, BCG, OPV 3 2 ̆ 6 measles and full immunization) and on maternal health (ex., tetanus toxoid injection and <b>attended</b> <b>delivery).</b> Two empirical models were estimated. Using these models, the study estimated multiple regression equations for each outcome of interest against the predictor variable (HEW coverage) controlling for confounding factors such as electricity, telephone etc. and year to capture variations over time. Results: Since it became operational in 2004, the program has had a tangible effect on child health outcomes. Results showed that a 10...|$|E
40|$|The ongoing boom in {{e-commerce}} {{increases the}} importance of profitable and customer-oriented delivery services. Particularly in metropolitan areas, the high population density offers great potential for e-commerce, while uncertain demand and traffic conditions increase planning uncertainty. This contribution focuses on e-commerce delivery fulfillment (e-fulfillment) for <b>attended</b> last-mile <b>delivery</b> services in metropolitan areas. As the customer needs to be present for deliveries of groceries, for example, a service time window has to be agreed upon already when a customer’s order is accepted. We consider service time windows as a scarce resource and as the critical interface between order capture and order delivery. To optimally utilize this scarce resource, we propose combining concepts of revenue management and vehicle routing to extend tactical and operational planning for e-fulfillment. We define the research problem and provide a perspective on integrated planning for <b>attended</b> <b>deliveries.</b> Furthermore, we present {{the design of a}} virtual laboratory to support benchmarking in e-fulfillment research. To ensure realistic experimental settings, we plan to incorporate real-world data provided by a major e-grocery in Germany...|$|R
40|$|The paper aims to {{optimize}} the final part of a firm’s value chain with regard to <b>attended</b> last-mile <b>deliveries.</b> It is assumed that to be profitable, ecommerce businesses need to maximize the overall value of fulfilled orders (rather than their number), while also limiting costs of delivery. To do so, {{it is essential to}} decide which delivery requests to accept and which time windows to offer to which consumers. This is especially relevant for <b>attended</b> <b>deliveries,</b> as delivery fees usually cannot fully compensate costs of delivery given tight delivery time windows. The literature review shows that existing order acceptance techniques often ignore either the order value or the expected costs of delivery. The paper presents an iterative solution approach: after calculating an approximate transport capacity based on forecasted expected delivery requests and a cost-minimizing routing, actual delivery requests are accepted or rejected aiming to maximize the overall value of orders given the computed transport capacity. With the final set of accepted requests, the routing solution is updated to minimize costs of delivery. The presented solution approach combines well-known methods from revenue management and time-dependent vehicle routing. In a computational study for a German metropolitan area, the potential and the limits of value-based demand fulfillment as well as its sensitivity regarding forecast accuracy and demand composition are investigated...|$|R
40|$|Increasing {{equitable}} {{access to}} health care is a main challenge African policy makers are facing. The Ghanaian government implemented the National Health Insurance Scheme in 2004 and the aim {{of this study is to}} evaluate its early effects on maternal and infant healthcare use. We exploit data on births before and after the intervention and apply propensity score matching to limit the bias arising from self-selection into the health insurance. About forty percent of children had a mother who is enrolled in this insurance. The scheme significantly increased the proportion of pregnancies with at least four antenatal care visits with 7 percentage points and had a significant effect on <b>attended</b> <b>deliveries</b> (10 percentage points). Caesarean sections increased (6 percentage points) and the number of children born from an unwanted pregnancy decreased (7 percentage points). Insurance enrollment had almost no effect on child vaccinations. Among the poorest forty percent of the sample, the effects of the scheme on antenatal care and <b>attended</b> <b>deliveries</b> were similar. However, the effects of the scheme on caesarean sections were about half the size (3 percentage points) and the reduction in unwanted pregnancies was larger (10 percentage points) compared to the effects in the full sample. We conclude that in the first years of operation, the National Health Insurance Scheme had a modest impact on the use of antenatal and delivery care. This is important for other African countries currently introducing or considering a national health insurance as a means towards universal health coverage...|$|R

Four districts received program intervention i. e. trained community health workers to deliver essential maternal, neonatal, and child healthcare and nutrition services while two districts were treated as comparison group. A quasi-experimental study design (compared before-and-after) was undertaken. Baseline survey was conducted in 2008 among 7200 women followed by end line in 2012 among 4800 women with similar characteristics in the same villages. We evaluated maternal antenatal and post natal checkup, birth plans and delivery, complication and referred cases during antenatal checkup and post natal period, and child health indicators such as birth asphyxia, neonatal sepsis, and its management by the medically trained provider. Increased number (four or more) antenatal visits, skill-birth <b>attended</b> <b>delivery</b> and postnatal visits (three or more) in the intervention group preceding four-year intervention period were observed compare to their counterpart. We noted negative difference-in-difference estimator (- 5. 0 %, P = 0. 159) regarding to the all major birth plans i. e. delivery place, birth attendant, and saved money in the comparison areas. Significant reduction of ante-partum and intra-partum complications occurred in the intervention group, contrary complications of such event increased in the comparison areas (- 6. 3 %, P< 0. 05 and - 20. 5 %, P< 0. 001 respectively). Referral case to the health centers due to these complications boosted significantly in intervention group than comparison group (2. 3 %, P< 0. 01 and 6. 6 %, P< 0. 001 respectively). Mother's knowledge of breastfeeding initiation and the practice of initiating breastfeeding within an hour of birth amplified significantly (14. 6 %, P< 0. 001 and 8. 3 %, P< 0. 001 respectively).

40|$|The {{purposes}} of this research were to obtain an overview of factors thought to predispose a man {{to participate in the}} childbearing cycle, changes occurring in men at this time, their perceptions of their participation and to test for the presence of these factors in a sample of Newfoundland men. The study base was obtained from a review of available literature on expectant fathers. Implications of their participation were obtained from writings which pertained to the changing roles of father's. A conceptual model developed from Role Theory served as a guide for identification and categorization of paternal behaviours described in the literature. Selected variables related to men's backgrounds, physical and/or emotional changes, concerns and their preparation for fatherhood. Immediate post-partum reactions to participation in labour and delivery were explored. Reviewed literature suggested that the needs of fathers are not being met by health professionals, mainly due to lack of empirical knowledge of what these needs are. [...] The subjects consisted of 36 first-time fathers who were present during labour and/or delivery. Data collection was by subject interview in early labour and post-delivery questionnaire. Frequencies and means of data were obtained in order to describe the population in relation to the variables being investigated. Factor analysis was performed on the fathers' perceptions of their participation. Tests of significance were performed using identified principal components as the dependent variables. In this manner differences of perceptions of prepared/unprepared fathers and birth attenders/non-attenders were obtained. [...] Results revealed the majority of these fathers had experienced psychosocial changes and concerns during their wives' pregnancies. A minority reported physical changes. Prenatal classes had been attended by most of the men and a variety of activities to augment their ability to support their wives during labour were reported. Preparation for the fatherhood role was suggested in the findings. Reported activities were informal and self-motivated. Analysis of activities supported the suggestion that there were, in fact, two operations occurring; preparation to provide support to the wife and preparation to be father to the child, but that health care professionals provided anticipatory guidance almost exclusively on the support functions of expectant fathers. Factor analysis of the post delivery questionnaire identified seven principal components which accounted for 66 % of overall variance. The subjects' perceptions of their participation was, on the whole, positive. The exception was in regards to knowledge of how to help their wives. Two tailed T tests performed on subgroups of this population showed two areas of statistical significance (p. = < 0. 02). Perceptions of the processes of labour and delivery was more positive both in prepared fathers than unprepared and in men who had <b>attended</b> <b>delivery</b> than those who had not.

Methods: a case-control study was conducted with pregnant women submitted to episiotomy (cases) and pregnant women not submitted to episiotomy (controls) between March 2009 and July 2010 at the Professor Fernando Figueira Integral Medicine Institute (IMIP) in Recife, Brazil, in a ratio of 1 case to 2 controls. The study variables consisted of: whether episiotomy was performed, demographic, obstetric and fetal characteristics (primiparity, analgesia, instrumental delivery, fetal distress, etc.), external factors (day and time of <b>delivery,</b> professional <b>attending</b> <b>delivery)</b> and factors directly related to delivery. Odds ratios (OR) and 95 % confidence intervals (95 %CI) were calculated. Multivariate analysis was performed to determine the adjusted risk of episiotomy. Results: a total of 522 women (173 cases and 349 controls) were included. It was found that deliveries with episiotomy were more likely to have been attended by staff physicians (OR = 1. 88; 95 %CI: 1. 01 - 3. 48), to have required forceps (OR = 12. 31; 95 %CI: 4. 9 - 30. 1) and to have occurred in primiparas (OR = 4. 24; 95 %CI: 2. 61 - 6. 89).

40|$|OBJECTIVE. To {{determine}} current resuscitation {{practices of}} neonatologists in the United States. METHODS. A 15 -question survey {{was developed and}} mailed to neonatal directors in May 2004. RESULTS. Of the total of 797 surveys mailed, 84 were returned undeliverable or unanswered and 450 were returned completed (63 % response rate). Respondents were mainly (70 %) from level III NICUs. Most programs resuscitate newborns {{in the delivery room}} (83 %), rather than in a separate room. The number and background of individuals <b>attending</b> <b>deliveries</b> vary greatly, with 31 % of programs having < 3 individuals <b>attending</b> <b>deliveries.</b> Flow-inflating bags are most commonly used (51 %), followed by self-inflating bags (40 %) and T-piece resuscitators (14 %). Pulse oximeters are used during resuscitation by 52 % of programs, and 23 % of respondents indicated that there was a useful signal within 1 minute after application. Blenders are available for 42 % of programs, of which 77 % use pure oxygen for the initial resuscitation and 68 % use oximeters to alter the fraction of inspired oxygen. Thirty-two percent of programs use carbon dioxide detectors to confirm intubation, 48 % routinely and 43 % when there is difficulty confirming intubation. Preterm infants are wrapped with plastic wrap to prevent heat loss in 29 % of programs, of which 77 % dry the infant before wrap application. A majority of programs (76 %) attempt to provide continuous positive airway pressure or positive end expiratory pressure (PEEP) during resuscitation, most commonly with a flow-inflating bag (58 %), followed by a self-inflating bag with PEEP valve (19 %) and T-piece resuscitator (16 %). A level of 5 cm H 2 O is used by 55 % of programs. CONCLUSIONS. Substantial variations exist in neonatal resuscitation practices, some of which are not addressed in standard guidelines.

The reasons for this were unclear, but may be connected to genital and urinary tract infections and the presence of scar tissue. The researchers wrote that FGM was associated with an increased risk to the mother of damage to the perineum and excessive blood loss, as well as a need to resuscitate the baby, and stillbirth, perhaps because of a long second stage of labour.|$|R

It is really impolite (culturally) and unacceptable in Afar to expose the reproductive health organs” (Yousuf et al. 2011).|$|R
40|$|The {{practical}} {{management of}} the problem of erythroblastosis depends primarily on the prenatal determination of which pregnancies might result in an erythroblastotic infant. The physician primarily concerned with the care of the child must <b>attend</b> the <b>delivery</b> of every Rh-negative woman whose serum contains anti-Rh antibodies. At present, prompt confirmation of the suspected diagnosis immediately following birth and immediate exchange transfusion in infants with laboratory or clinical evidence of the disease are necessary to reduce morbidity and prevent kernicterus...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{determine}} referral rates, {{to study}} the nature of consultations with obstetricians, and to examine how both patient and physician characteristics affect referrals. DESIGN: Case series. Retrospective review of hospital records. SETTING: Victoria Hospital, a tertiary care centre affiliated with the University of Western Ontario in London, Ont. PARTICIPANTS: Five hundred forty-two women admitted consecutively for delivery {{under the care of}} family physicians from October 1, 1990, to September 31, 1991. OUTCOME MEASURE: The number and types of obstetrical consultations obtained for the study population. RESULTS: Of the 50. 7 % of cases requiring consultation, half were delivered by obstetricians. The most common reasons for consultation were failure to progress in labour, induction of labour, posterior presentation, fetal distress, and pregnancy-induced hypertension. The most common reasons for obstetricians to <b>attend</b> <b>delivery</b> were to perform forceps rotations and cesarean sections. CONCLUSIONS: Parity and risk classification were the two most important factors for predicting whether consultation would occur. The high rate of consultation in this study might relate to ease of access to consultation in a tertiary care environment. More study is needed to examine the reasons for consultation because it seems that some of the situations for which obstetricians were consulted could have been safely managed by family physicians...|$|R
40|$|Background: The {{main purpose}} of {{physiologic}} delivery is to rely on mother′s body for childbirth. In physiologic delivery method pregnant women <b>attend</b> <b>delivery</b> preparation classes and {{they learn how to}} overcome fear and pain. This study compares delivery outcomes among women who participated in physiologic delivery with those who had undergone non-physiologic delivery. Methods: All patients referred for physiologic delivery were assessed. Exclusion criteria were lack of PROM, post date, cephalopelvic disproportion, multi-fetal pregnancy, Meconium stain, blood pressure above 90 / 140, placenta previa and previous record of cesarean. Data was entered in SPSS 16 software and Fisher and Chi-square tests were used to compare vaginal laceration, episiotomy and Apgar score between two groups. Results: Twelve out of 73 pregnant women (16. 4 %) in physiologic delivery group and 27 out of 69 pregnant women (39. 1 %) in non-physiologic delivery group needed episiotomy (P = 0. 002). Ten patients (13. 7 %) in physiologic delivery group and seven persons (10. 1 %) in the non-physiologic delivery group were suffering from vaginal laceration (P = 0. 51). There was no significant statistical difference between newborns′ Apgar score in two groups. Conclusions: Physiologic delivery can reduce the need for episiotomy without any further complications...|$|R
40|$|Abstract- Group B streptococci (GBS) or Streptococcus agalactiae {{are members}} of the normal flora of the female genital tract. GBS {{normally}} colonizes the vagina in many women asymptomatically. During labor this organism may infect the newborn, leading to neonatal sepsis and meningitis. This study aimed to investigate the prevalence of group B streptococcus in pregnant women by a rapid and easy culture method. It seems that in cases in which GBS carriage is not suspected until the time of labor, using such a quick and specific culture method would be valuable. A total of 330 vaginal swabs were collected from women <b>attending</b> <b>delivery</b> room at Hedayat hospital, Tehran, Iran, from April through July 2008. Cotton swabs contaminated with vaginal fluid were placed into Amies transport medium and transported to the Avicenna laboratory daily. Vaginal specimens were cultured on selective GBS Agar Base medium (ISLAM) for isolation and detection of group B streptococcus. The plates were incubated at 35 - 37 °C under anaerobic condition for 24 hours. Incubated S. agalactiae developed orange/red pigmented colonies in GBS agar plates. Among the 330 women, the re-sults of the culture were positive for GBS in 68 women (20. 6 %). Statistical analyses showed no significant relationship between demographics, reproductive histories and obstetric characteristics of subjects with th...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: Improving {{maternal}} health remains {{a major challenge}} facing Malawi because at 984 deaths per 100, 000 live births, the maternal mortality ratio is {{among the highest in}} the world. Although the health status of women in child-bearing age groups is low in all the three regions of Malawi, there are marked regional differences in several health indicators. OBJECTIVE: To analyze the degree of socio-economic inequities in {{maternal health}} in Malawi both at regional and national levels. METHODS: Using data from a sample of 4, 276 women from the Malawi Second Integrated Household Survey of 2004 who reported giving birth up to two years preceding the survey, <b>deliveries</b> <b>attended</b> by skilled health personnel and access to prenatal care services were used to analyze socio-economic inequities in maternal health. Household income, from which household socio-economic status was derived, was proxed by real annual household expenditure. Concentration indices were then calculated for the two indicators for the whole sample, as well as for each of the three regions of Malawi. The proportion of household income that is spent on health was also considered to ascertain whether the poor spend a larger proportion of their income on health than the non-poor. RESULTS: There is no evidence that the poor spend a higher proportion of their income on health than the non-poor. We found very high rates of utilization of antenatal care services with no income-related inequality in its utilization both at regional and national levels. There are socioeconomic inequalities in the deliveries by skilled health personnel. The pro-rich inequalities in the medically <b>attended</b> <b>deliveries</b> are highest in the central region followed by the north and lowest in the southern region, with traditional birth attendants still playing an important role in handling deliveries. CONCLUSIONS: The free government medical services appear to be effective in ensuring that the poor do not spend a higher proportion of their income on health than the non-poor. However, there is a wide mismatch between utilization of antenatal care services and skilled attendance at childbirth...|$|R
40|$|A {{controlled}} evaluation of health education {{for pregnant women}} was implemented from 1983 to 1985 in the French north alpine rural area with a quasi-experimental design. Altogether 116 villages (88, 983 inhabitants) constituted the pilot zone where the programme took place. This was matched with a control zone of 114 villages (78, 800 inhabitants) where routine antenatal surveillance was not changed. The programme involved {{a large group of}} health and social workers and institutions and several educational devices. There was a total of 3143 births to the study women during the programme. In all the 45 maternity clinics of the region the mothers were questioned as to their pregnancy history and delivery outcome. The programme succeeded in increasing, in the pilot zone, the proportion of women who benefited from a monthly antenatal visit, whereas no positive trend was shown in the control zones, even when controlling for some identified potential confounders (age and distance to health care providers). Similarly, women in the pilot zone were more likely to <b>attend</b> <b>delivery</b> preparation sessions than women in the control zone. However, many conditions revealed no differential modification in the two study zones. Perinatal morbidity is lower in the north alpine rural area than in the whole country. These results favour further development of social policies for pregnancy and of prenatal care, complemented by better information and training for health and social workers; they also favour better information as to medical monitoring, hygiene, and social rights related to pregnancy...|$|R
50|$|In {{the public}} hospitals, as the {{standard}} of care, midwives <b>attend</b> the <b>delivery</b> of babies. Only {{in the case of}} a complicated birth, for example one requiring Cesarean section or suturing, will the obstetrician on staff be called. Cesarean sections are not available on request and the rate in most public hospitals vary from 10-14%, with higher rates occurring in hospitals that receive more referrals. There tends to be a high rate of episiotomies in the public hospitals, as high as 50%. There is limited availability of epidurals in these hospitals and for the most part, natural childbirth takes place. Continuous fetal monitoring technology is not used.|$|R
40|$|Background: Community {{health workers}} (CHWs) {{have proven to}} be {{successful}} in mobilizing rural populations to utilize primary health services where they can be supported by skilled health workers. This study assessed the cost-effectiveness of three CHW models implemented in northern Nigeria. Method: Using a quasi-experimental design, we compare the costs and health outcomes for communities where CHW models were implemented versus those where no CHW models were implemented. The three CHW models were Community Volunteer (CV), Nigeria Subsidy Reinvestment and Empowerment Programme for Maternal and Child Health Village Health Worker (VHW), and the Junior Community Health Extension Worker providing community based service delivery (JCHEW-CBSD). The unit costs, consultation patterns, benefit-cost ratios, and cost-effectiveness ratios were calculated for the three CHW models. Results: Compared to the CVs, the VHWs and the JCHEW-CBSDs had the highest levels of interactions in the community, each helping to educate 120 - 130 pregnant women each year. JCHEW-CBSDs made the most referrals for antenatal care (220) and facility births (122); however, women who interacted with the VHWs increased their antenatal care visits the most, with 92 % of the women having made at least one and 70 % having made 4 + ANC visits. The unit cost of the CVs was lowest, compared to the other two models, at $ 127 versus $ 3176 for the VHW model and $ 4443 for the JCHEWCBSD model. The outcomes per unit cost ratios were highest for the VHW model. For every $ 1000 invested in the VHW, there were 54 ANC 4 + visits and 95. 9 <b>deliveries</b> <b>attended</b> by a skilled birth attendant. The Incremental Cost-Effectiveness Ratios for the VHW model were also lower than for the JCHEW-CBSD model, ranging from a low of an additional $ 25 per incremental ANC visits to $ 152 for increments in <b>attended</b> <b>deliveries,</b> the latter amount three times lower than for the JCHEW-CBSD model. Conclusion: This cost-effectiveness study of CHW models in Northern Nigeria shows that the SURE-P VHW model was most cost-effective. The VHW model, an enhanced volunteer model, promises the greatest return on investment if scaled up in northern Nigeria and settings with similar health care delivery contexts...|$|R
