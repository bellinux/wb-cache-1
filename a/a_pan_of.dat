25|$|Philip III died in Madrid on 31 March 1621, {{succeeded by}} his son, Philip IV, who rapidly {{completed}} {{the process of}} removing the last elements of the Sandoval family regime from court. The story told in the memoirs of the French ambassador Bassompierre, that {{he was killed by}} the heat of a brasero (<b>a</b> <b>pan</b> <b>of</b> hot charcoal), because the proper official to take it away was not at hand, is a humorous exaggeration of the formal etiquette of the court.|$|E

25|$|The two airmen {{realised}} {{that they}} had to make for the French lines at night or risk capture by the Germans before morning. Bozděch left <b>a</b> <b>pan</b> <b>of</b> water and some more chocolate with the dog, and they locked it inside the farmhouse before heading off across the snow to a nearby wood. Almost immediately upon leaving the property, the night sky was lit up by flares fired by the Germans as they were looking for the aircrew from the nearby crash site. They had nearly reached the trees when they could hear the dog howling from the farmhouse. They agreed that the only course of action was for Bozděch to return and kill the dog. He left Duval in the snow, {{and went back to the}} house. As he approached he searched for a large rock or heavy object with which to kill the puppy in the most humane manner he could. The dog began to throw itself at the locked door as it heard someone approaching. Bozděch opened the door and found he could not kill the animal, instead picking it up and placing it next to his chest inside his flight jacket. The trio made it into the cover of the trees, and were discovered by a party of French troops who had been sent to look for them. They took the dog back to the base with them, where Duval was sent to the hospital. Bozděch met back up with his fellow Czech airmen in exile, who all played with the puppy. It was decided to name him Ant, after their favourite aircraft from back in Czechoslovakia.|$|E

500|$|On 4 June 1561 the spire {{caught fire}} and crashed through the nave roof. According to a newsheet {{published}} {{days after the}} fire, the cause was a lightning strike.

2500|$|A French dip {{sandwich}}, {{also known}} as a beef dip, is a hot sandwich consisting of thinly sliced roast beef (or, sometimes, other meats) on a [...] "French roll" [...] or baguette. It is usually served au jus ("with juice"), that is, with beef juice from the cooking process. Beef broth or beef consommé is sometimes substituted. Despite the sandwich's name, the French dip sandwich was not invented in France, but in the United States. Both Philippe the Original's and Cole's Pacific Electric Buffet, two restaurants in Los Angeles, claim to have invented the French dip sandwich. Philippe Mathieu may have possibly invented the sandwich by accident around the year 1918, who according to one story, accidentally dropped a sandwich in <b>a</b> <b>pan</b> <b>of</b> au jus. Another story is that a fireman to Philippe's restaurant found his roast beef sandwich roll to be too hard. Thus, Philippe had it dipped in juice. Whatever the origin, Cole's Pacific Electric Buffet also claims to have invented the French dip sandwich as well.|$|E

2500|$|The {{advantage}} of a horizontal pendulum is that it achieves very low frequencies of oscillation in a compact instrument. [...] The [...] "gate" [...] is slightly tilted, so the weight tends to slowly return to a central position. [...] The pendulum is adjusted (before the damping is installed) to oscillate once per three seconds, or once per thirty seconds. [...] The general-purpose instruments of small stations or amateurs usually oscillate once per ten seconds. [...] <b>A</b> <b>pan</b> <b>of</b> oil is placed under the arm, and a small sheet of metal mounted {{on the underside of}} the arm drags in the oil to damp oscillations. The level of oil, position on the arm, and angle and size of sheet is adjusted until the damping is [...] "critical," [...] that is, almost having oscillation. [...] The hinge is very low friction, often torsion wires, so the only friction is the internal friction of the wire. [...] Small seismographs with low proof masses are placed in a vacuum to reduce disturbances from air currents.|$|E
2500|$|Unexpected {{rock music}} {{performance}} appearances included Tina Turner, David Bowie, and Iggy Pop. Shore also {{appeared on the}} Norman Lear comedy-soap opera Mary Hartman, Mary Hartman in April 1976. On the show, Dinah interviewed country singing character Loretta Haggars (played by Mary Kay Place) and included a controversial comment from Miss Haggars during her appearance on a [...] "Live" [...] airing of Ms. Shore's talk show. Shore had the misfortune of interviewing the comedian Andy Kaufman in his Tony Clifton guise on her show. He took deliberate offense at her questions and eventually tipped <b>a</b> <b>pan</b> <b>of</b> eggs over her head. This program was taped live {{in front of a}} studio audience and the [...] "eggs" [...] segment was never aired; it is believed that the offending footage was destroyed. Shore's producers superimposed titles such as [...] "This is a put on" [...] over the footage that was eventually aired, including an uncomfortable duet of [...] "Anything You Can Do", and his solo of [...] "On The Street Where You Live". Shooting was stopped and Kaufman was escorted out of the studio.|$|E

After the death of Aaron's sons, God told Moses to tell Aaron not to come at will into the Most Holy Place ( [...] , Kodesh Ha-Kodashim), lest he die, for God {{appeared}} in the cloud there. Aaron was to enter only after bathing in water, dressing in his sacral linen tunic, breeches, sash, and turban, and bringing a bull for a sin offering, two rams for burnt offerings, and two he-goats for sin offerings. Aaron {{was to take the}} two goats to the entrance of the Tabernacle and place lots upon them, one marked for the Lord and the other for Azazel. Aaron was to offer the goat designated for the Lord as a sin offering, and to send off to the wilderness the goat designated for Azazel. Aaron was then to offer the bull of sin offering. Aaron was then to take <b>a</b> <b>pan</b> <b>of</b> glowing coals from the altar and two handfuls of incense and put the incense on the fire before the Most Holy Place, so that the cloud from the incense would screen the Ark of the Covenant. He was to sprinkle some of the bull's blood and then some of the goat's blood over and in front of the Ark, to purge the Shrine of the uncleanness and transgression of the Israelites.|$|E

2500|$|The {{chemical}} foam extinguisher {{was invented in}} 1904 by Aleksandr Loran in Russia, based on his previous invention of fire fighting foam. Loran first used it to extinguish <b>a</b> <b>pan</b> <b>of</b> burning naphtha. It worked and looked similar to the soda-acid type, but the inner parts were slightly different. The main tank contained a solution of sodium bicarbonate in water, whilst the inner container (somewhat larger than the equivalent in a soda-acid unit) contained a solution of aluminium sulphate. When the solutions were mixed, usually by inverting the unit, the two liquids reacted to create a frothy foam, and carbon dioxide gas. The gas expelled the foam {{in the form of}} a jet. Although liquorice-root extracts and similar compounds were used as additives (stabilizing the foam by reinforcing the bubble-walls), there was no [...] "foam compound" [...] in these units. The foam was a combination of the products of the chemical reactions: sodium and aluminium salt-gels inflated by the carbon dioxide. Because of this, the foam was discharged directly from the unit, with no need for an aspirating branchpipe (as in newer mechanical foam types). Special versions were made for rough service, and vehicle mounting, known as apparatus of fire department types. Key features were a screw-down stopper that kept the liquids from mixing until it was manually opened, carrying straps, a longer hose, and a shut-off nozzle. Fire department types were often private label versions of major brands, sold by apparatus manufacturers to match their vehicles. Examples are Pirsch, Ward LaFrance, Mack, Seagrave, etc. These types are some of the most collectible extinguishers as they cross into both the apparatus restoration and fire extinguisher areas of interest.|$|E
