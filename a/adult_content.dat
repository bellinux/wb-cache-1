5|$|In {{the adult}} {{versions}} of the game, there are scenes with sexual CGs depicting Yuichi and a given heroine having sex. Later, Key released versions of Kanon without the erotic content. The versions that include the <b>adult</b> <b>content</b> have one explicit sex scene {{in each of the}} five main story routes, in addition to one fantasy scene. Outside of these, there are two scenes with nudity. Yūichi Suzumoto, a scenario writer who worked on later Key titles, commented that the sex scenes in Kanon are very self-contained, and can be easily removed without altering the story. Maeda remarked that the sex scenes were not written with reproduction in mind.|$|E
5|$|Jun Maeda, {{the main}} {{scenario}} writer of Air, commented {{that in the}} early stages of Air production, it was already decided that it was to be an adult game, and he further assumes that if it was not at least first released with <b>adult</b> <b>content,</b> that it would not have been as commercially successful. Maeda also commented that he wanted to write Air to give players the chance to experience the entire story as a whole rather than just a sum of differing parts as typical bishōjo games do, including Kanon. While attempting to do this, Maeda also tried to simultaneously make it seem similar to typical visual novels in the same genre as Air to give the game appeal to the players who often play such games. As such, while the game incorporates stories from several characters, they are all of varying lengths.|$|E

40|$|International audienceTo prevent {{pornography}} {{from spreading}} on the Internet effectively, we propose a novel method of adult image detection which combines bag-of-visual-words (BoVW) based on {{region of interest}} (ROI) and color moments (CM). The goal of BoVW is to automatically mine the local patterns of <b>adult</b> <b>contents,</b> called visual words. The usual BoVW method clusters visual words from the patches in the whole image and adopts the weighting schemes of hard assignment. However, there are many background noises in the whole image and soft-weighting scheme is better than hard assignment. Therefore, we propose the method of BoVW based on ROI, which includes two perspectives. Firstly, we propose to create visual words in ROI for adult image detection. The representative power of visual words can be improved because the patches in ROI are more indicative to <b>adult</b> <b>contents</b> {{than those in the}} whole image. Secondly, soft-weighting scheme is adopted to detect adult images. Moreover, CM is selected by evaluating some commonly-used global features to be combined with BoVW based on ROI. The experiments and the comparison with the state-of-the-art methods show that our method is able to remarkably improve the performance of adult image detection...|$|R

Caramel Box went on to produce two fan discs released in 2005 and 2007 in Caramel Box Yarukibako and Caramel Box Yarukibako 2, respectively. Caramel Box later produced a sequel to Otoboku titled Otome wa Boku ni Koishiteru: Futari no Elder released on June 30, 2010 playable on Windows PCs.

5|$|When Tomoyo After was ported to the PlayStation 2 (PS2), {{improvements}} to the game were included.

Yūto Tonokawa wrote some of the additional story for Takafumi and Kanako. With the added scenario and visuals combined, the PS2 edition is 1.5 times longer than the Windows edition. In the original version, the entire cast excluding Tomoya Okazaki, had full voice acting; this was not changed for the PlayStation 2 version. Added support was included so as to make the visuals on the television sharper than in the past with visual novels played on a consumer console rather than on a computer screen. The PS2 version also reduced flickering of the picture, reducing eyestrain.|$|E

The pair continued to deny marriage allegations, stating that neither was married. One particular allegation among the rumor was that Aaliyah wedded R. Kelly without her parents' knowledge.|$|E
