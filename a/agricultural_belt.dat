40|$|Understanding {{the interplay}} between {{ecological}} and social factors across multiple scales is integral to landscape change initiatives in productive agricultural regions such as the rural US Corn Belt. We investigated the cultural context surrounding the use of perennial cover types—such as stream buffers, wetlands, cellulosic bioenergy stocks, and diverse cropping rotations—to restore water quality, biodiversity, and ecosystem function within a Corn <b>Belt</b> <b>agricultural</b> mosaic in Iowa, USA. Through ethnographic techniques and 33 in-depth interviews, we examined what was most important to rural stakeholders about their countryside. We then used photo elicitation to probe how interviewees’ assessments of farm practices involving perennial cover types were related to their sense of place. Our interviewees perceived their rural ‘‘countryside’’ as a linked social and biophysical entity, identifying strongly with the farming lifestyle and with networks of people across the landscape. While most interviewees approved of perennial farm practices on marginal agricultural land, implementation of these practices was neither a priority nor strongly assimilated into rural experience and ethics. We identified three scale boundaries in our interviewees’ perception of place which present key challenges and opportunities for landscape change: landscape-community, individualcommunity, and community-institution. In all cases, community social norms and networks—exhibited at landscape spatial scales—may be instrumental in bridging these boundaries and enabling networks of perennial cover types that span privately owned and operated farms...|$|R
40|$|The paper proposes an {{efficient}} network of forest belts that can fulfil the multiple roles characteristic to a well-designed intervention: protecting the city against agricultural dust, noise protection, air filtration, stabilization of land, {{improvement of the}} quality of agricultural products when growing in protected areas, conservation of the biodiversity following the relief, climate and hydrographical conditions and the development of agricultural landscape. This last goal is very important as in the vicinity of Timisoara one has little natural landscape attractions. The paper also aims to establish a favourable ratio intervention / costs, leading to the actual implementation of the proposal in a short time to have concrete results. The main research methods used are bibliographic documentation, analysis of sampled data provided by institutions in the field and simulation, {{in order to determine the}} optimum size of the forest belts for {{an efficient}} protection against agricultural dust and other major pollutants which arise from the surroundings of the city. The paper sets a proposal of practical solutions to improve air quality and decrease negative effects on public health due to high levels of allergens coming from plants on vacant lots as well as <b>agricultural</b> plots.

40|$|Cotton {{is grown}} on over 11. 6 {{million acres in}} the Southeastern USA each year. But less than 25 % of this cotton is grown using {{conservation}} tillage. Improvements in adoption {{have been hard to}} achieve for a number of reasons. This project’s aim was to improve a system for cotton production and to increase producer understanding of sustainable production practices including conservation tillage and cover crops. In on-farm studies we investigated effects of cover crops in conservation tillage cotton production systems on crop production. Insect dynamics, soil microarthropods and plant parasitic nematodes were used to evaluate impacts of cover crop management. Companion studies on station and in the greenhouse were used to identify cover crops with the most potential to produce biomass, enhance biological diversity and reduce threats of plant parasitic nematodes. Our results showed a positive impact of a blend of legumes (balansa clover, crimson clover, and hairy vetch) plus rye on above and below ground biological populations. Addition of cover crops increased soil biological diversity and microbial activity and in one year reduced the number of pesticide applications needed to control cotton insect pests. Plant parasitic nematode populations were supported by some of the cover crops in our system and trials with other cover crops indicated that alternative cover crops would be better choices where plant parasitic nematode populations exist. Through partnerships with the Georgia Conservation Tillage Alliance, Seven Rivers RC&D, and Sunbelt Farm Expo we provided information to several thousand farmers on use of cover crops in conservation tillage systems and impacts cover crops can have on nutrients, soil C, pest insects, nematodes and crop yields. Research results were presented at on-farm field days, conservation tillage meetings, the Sun <b>Belt</b> <b>Agricultural</b> Exposition, professional scientific society meetings and in scientific and nonscientific publications. Our outreach efforts were effective and successful in promoting sustainable farming practices in the Southeast...|$|R
