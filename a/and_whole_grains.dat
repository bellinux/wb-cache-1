25|$|Dietary and {{nutritional}} choices affect sleep duration and quality. Research is being conducted {{in an attempt}} to discover what kinds of nutritional choices result in better sleep quality. A study in the Western Journal of Nursing Research in 2011 compared how sleep quality was affected by four different diets: a high-protein diet, a high-fat diet, a high-carbohydrate diet, and a control diet. Results indicated that the diets high in protein resulted in fewer wakeful episodes during night-time sleep. The high carbohydrate diet was linked to much shorter periods of quiescent or restful sleep. These results suggest that ingested nutrients do play a role in determining sleep quality. Another investigation published in Nutrition Research in 2012 examined the effects of various combinations of dietary choices in regard to sleep. Although {{it is difficult to determine}} one perfect diet for sleep enhancement, this study indicated that a variety of micro and macro nutrients are needed to maintain levels of healthful and restful sleep. A varied diet containing fresh fruits and vegetables, low-fat proteins, <b>and</b> <b>whole</b> <b>grains</b> can be the best nutritional option for individuals seeking to improve the quality of their sleep.|$|E

30|$|The knowledge, {{attitudes and}} {{practices}} (KAP) towards <b>whole</b> <b>grain</b> among the children are assessed using a validated, guided, self-administered questionnaire. The details of the KAP towards the <b>whole</b> <b>grain</b> questionnaire, {{as well as the}} development and validation procedure have been previously published (Koo et al. 2016 a). However, for the sake of completeness, a brief description is provided here. The questionnaire is constructed in the Malay language, and consists of four main sections: (1) demographic factors, (2) knowledge domain, (3) attitude domain and (4) practice domain. The demographic factors are intended to discover the demographic <b>and</b> <b>whole</b> <b>grain</b> consumption pattern. Whereas, the knowledge domain reflects the knowledge on general nutrition <b>and</b> <b>whole</b> <b>grain</b> information, including the food pyramid, source of carbohydrates, definition of <b>whole</b> <b>grains,</b> source of <b>whole</b> <b>grains,</b> nutritional content of <b>whole</b> <b>grains</b> <b>and</b> the benefits of <b>whole</b> <b>grain</b> consumption. The attitude domain is defined as the school children’s opinions <b>and</b> beliefs towards <b>whole</b> <b>grain</b> consumption, awareness <b>and</b> socio-cultural perspectives. Finally, the practice domain corresponds to the school children’s practice towards <b>whole</b> <b>grain</b> consumption, such as the frequency of the intake of <b>whole</b> <b>grain</b> ready-to-eat cereals, whole-grain bread, corn, whole-grain biscuits, oats, barley and brown rice.|$|R

40|$|Evidence {{suggests}} that <b>whole</b> <b>grain</b> foods {{may reduce the}} risk of chronic diseases; however, intake of <b>whole</b> <b>grains</b> in the UK is below optimal levels. This thesis has been primarily concerned with evaluating attitudes towards <b>whole</b> <b>grain</b> foods <b>and</b> measuring current consumption in an unstudied, culturally distinct region of the UK i. e. Northern Ireland. Qualitative focus groups and a cross-sectional survey were conducted to a) evaluate attitudes towards <b>whole</b> <b>grains</b> among various subgroups of respondents, b) measure <b>whole</b> <b>grain</b> intake, <b>and</b> c) evaluate health related factors influencing willingness to use breads with health claims <b>and</b> <b>whole</b> <b>grain</b> intake. Another cross-sectional study compared <b>whole</b> <b>grain</b> intake estimated using two dietary methods (a grain-specific food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) and seven day food diary) with plasma alkyl resorcinol concentrations (a potential <b>whole</b> <b>grain</b> biomarker). Results suggest that Northern Irish adults perceive <b>whole</b> <b>grain</b> foods to be 'healthy', but report many barriers to consumption, notably, a negative perception of the sensory qualities and an inability to identify <b>whole</b> <b>grains.</b> Respondents were either 'more' or 'less' favouring towards <b>whole</b> <b>grains</b> compared with refined <b>grain</b> foods. <b>Whole</b> <b>grain</b> intake was quite low; intakes were higher among those with 'more' favouring attitudes, and those broadly described as being 'health conscious' in terms of their socio-demographic, -economic, health and lifestyle profile. General food choice factors and health motivation influenced willingness to use breads with health claims, <b>and</b> <b>whole</b> <b>grain</b> intake. Lastly, the grain-specific FFQ correlated with other assessment methods, illustrating its ability to assess <b>whole</b> <b>grain</b> intake. This thesis provides an important insight into barriers <b>and</b> facilitators of <b>whole</b> <b>grain</b> consumption <b>and</b> demonstrates how attitudes and consumption differ among several subgroups. This information could be utilised by health practitioners promoting increased <b>whole</b> <b>grain</b> consumption, as well as the food industry when developing and marketing more acceptable <b>whole</b> <b>grain</b> products.

The samples showed an increase in firmness, reduction in moisture and Aw, and no color changes over time. A survey conducted prior to the acceptance test showed that the three most important factors influencing purchase were taste (19. 6 %), tenderness (16. 8 %), and expiration date of the product (14. 3 %). The results showed that 37. 2 % of the panelists preferred white bread, 62. 8 % preferred bread with fibers, and 82. 6 % would probably or definitely buy white bread with fibers.
