5|$|In April 2012, the Boston Herald sparked an {{election}} controversy when it {{drew attention to}} Warren's Association of American Law Schools (AALS) directory entries from 1986 to 1995, which listed her <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>minority</b> professor. According to the AALS, the directory was compiled by information supplied by law school deans, based on questionnaires filled out by individual teachers. Warren stated that she had self-identified as having Native American ancestry {{in order to meet}} others with a similar background. Harvard Law School had listed her <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>minority</b> professor in response to criticisms about a lack of faculty diversity, but Warren said that she was unaware of this until she read about it in a newspaper during the 2012 election.|$|E

5|$|A heliacal rising of Sothis was {{recorded}} in the reign of Thutmose's predecessor, Amenhotep I, which has been dated to 1517 BC, assuming the observation was made at Thebes. The year of Amenhotep's death and Thutmose's subsequent coronation can be accordingly derived, and is dated to 1506 BC by most modern scholars. However, if the observation were made at either Heliopolis or Memphis, <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>minority</b> of scholars promote, Thutmose would have been crowned in 1526 BC.|$|E

5|$|Bristol City council {{consists}} of 70 councillors representing 35 wards, with two per ward serving four-year terms. Councillors are elected in thirds, with elections held {{in three years}} out of every four-year period. Thus, since wards do not have both councillors up for election at the same time, two-thirds of the wards participate in each election. Although the council was long dominated by the Labour Party, the Liberal Democrats have grown strong {{in the city and}} (as the largest party) took minority control of the council after the 2005 election. In 2007, Labour and the Conservatives united to defeat the Liberal Democrat administration; Labour ruled the council <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>minority</b> administration, with Helen Holland as council leader.|$|E

According to the 2001 All-Ukrainian Census, approximately 10,000 self-identified Rusyns reside within Zakarpattia Oblast alone. [...] In August 2006, the UN Committee on liquidation on racial discrimination urged the Government of Ukraine to recognize Rusyns <b>as</b> <b>a</b> national <b>minority.</b> [...] This is recognized in 22 {{countries around the}} globe. [...] In March 2007, the Zakarpattia Regional Council adopted a decision which recognized Rusyns <b>as</b> <b>a</b> separate national <b>minority</b> at the oblast level.

5|$|The 1910 general {{elections}} {{had left the}} Liberals <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>minority</b> government dependent upon the support of Irish Nationalists. As desired by the Nationalists, Asquith introduced legislation that would give Ireland Home Rule, but the Conservatives and Unionists opposed it. As tempers rose over the Home Rule Bill, which {{would never have been}} possible without the Parliament Act, relations between the elderly Knollys and the Conservatives became poor, and he was pushed into retirement. Desperate to avoid the prospect of civil war in Ireland between Unionists and Nationalists, George called a meeting of all parties at Buckingham Palace in July 1914 in an attempt to negotiate a settlement. After four days the conference ended without an agreement. Political developments in Britain and Ireland were overtaken by events in Europe, and the issue of Irish Home Rule was shelved.|$|E
5|$|The Hungarian {{government}} recognised Croats <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>minority</b> {{native to}} Hungary; it {{has decided to}} implement the optional regulations of the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages {{with respect to the}} Croatian language and establish a minority self-government for the Croatian minority in Hungary, guaranteeing cultural autonomy. The Croatian minority set up 127 local and 7 county self-governments in Hungary. There are concerns that Croatian minority rights in Hungary are being diminished, but the president of Croatia has assessed that both Croatian and Hungarian minority policies were appropriate. The Croatian minority in Hungary is particularly active in Pécs, where the Scientific Institute of Croats in Hungary and the Croatian Theatre have been established.|$|E

50|$|Usually, {{the term}} sexual {{minority}} is {{applied only to}} groups who practice consensual sex: for example, it would be unusual to refer to rapists <b>as</b> <b>a</b> sexual <b>minority,</b> but the term would generally include someone whose sexuality gave a major, fetishized role to consensual playing out of a rape fantasy.

5|$|In a hung {{parliament}} {{where no}} party or coalition holds a majority, the monarch has an increased degree of latitude {{in choosing the}} individual likely to command the most support, though it would usually be {{the leader of the}} largest party. Since 1945, there have only been three hung parliaments. The first followed the February 1974 general election when Harold Wilson was appointed Prime Minister after Edward Heath resigned following his failure to form a coalition. Although Wilson's Labour Party did not have a majority, they were the largest party. The second followed the May 2010 general election, in which the Conservatives (the largest party) and Liberal Democrats (the third largest party) agreed to form the first coalition government since World War II. The third occurred shortly thereafter, in June 2017, when the Conservative Party lost its majority in a snap election, though the party remained in power <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>minority</b> government.|$|E
