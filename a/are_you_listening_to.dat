It is one thing to be morally convinced (as I am) that Miserrimus Dexter is the man who ought to have been tried for the murder at Gleninch; and it is another thing, at this distance of time, to lay our hands on the plain evidence which can alone justify anything like a public assertion of his guilt. There, as I see it, is the insuperable difficulty in the case. Unless I am completely mistaken, the question is now narrowed to this plain issue: The public assertion of your husband's innocence depends entirely on the public assertion of Dexter's guilt. How are you to arrive at that result? There is not a particle of evidence against him. You can only convict Dexter on Dexter's own confession. <b>Are</b> <b>you</b> <b>listening</b> <b>to</b> me?" ...|$|E

Raggett described the song, satying [...] "after a pleasant radio announcer sample, an incredibly messed-up loop of sound -- the band is in it somewhere, {{but not as much as}} all the other strange noises and notes crammed into the music -- serves as the bed for a perversely simple but completely uneasy listening melody. Crause delivers his lyrics with a slight urgency, but no more, over the bedlam."

Another chancellor, Li Tao, submitted a petition to Liu Chengyou, arguing that Yang and Guo, who was also serving as Yang's deputy, should be relieved of their positions and made military governors of key circuits, while the chief of staff positions should be entrusted to Su Fengji and Su Yugui.

Indeed, it was said that even on minor matters, even if the three chancellors concurred, no decision would be carried out unless Yang agreed with it, such that many needed actions became stalled. In particular, Yang, who rose from administrative ranks, disliked people in traditional learning, often stating: [...] "For the state, it is most important that the treasury is full, and the military is strong. Who cares about matters of literature, rites, and music?" [...] Further, as he still resented Su Fengji and Su Yugui (believing that they were behind Li Tao's petition) and also believed that the two Su chancellors had been insufficiently selective in their commissioning of officials, he made the process of commissioning officials to be an arduous one, such that sometimes people who had been promised official positions would not be commissioned for years. Further, those who had received their positions through connections or through seniority were often removed.|$|E
