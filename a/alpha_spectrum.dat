40|$|We present Monte Carlo {{calculations}} of Ly alpha radiative transfer through optically thick, spherically symmetric, collapsing gas clouds. These represent simplified models of protogalaxies {{in the process}} of their assembly. Such galaxies produce Ly alpha flux over an extended solid angle, either from a spatially extended Ly alpha emissivity, or from scattering effects, or both. We present a detailed study of the effect of the gas distribution and kinematics and of the Ly alpha emissivity profile on the emergent spectrum and surface brightness distribution. The emergent Ly <b>alpha</b> <b>spectrum</b> is typically double peaked and asymmetric. In practice, however, we find energy transfer from the infalling gas to the Ly alpha photons to significantly enhance the blue peak and to render the red peak, in most cases, undetectable. The resulting effective blueshift, combined with scattering in the intergalactic medium, renders extended Ly alpha emission from collapsing protogalaxies difficult to detect beyond redshift z greater than or similar to 4. We find a strong wavelength dependence of the slope of the surface brightness distribution (with preferential flattening at the red side of the line) to be a robust indication that Ly alpha photons are being generated (rather than just scattered) in a spatially extended, collapsing region around the galaxy. For self-ionized clouds whose effective Ly alpha optical depth is less than or similar to 10 (3), infall and outflow models can produce nearly identical spectra and surface brightness distributions and are practically indistinguishable. The presence of cosmic abundance of deuterium may produce a detectable dip in the spectra of systems with moderate hydrogen column densities, N(H) = 10 (18) - 10 (20) cm(- 2).

40|$|Alpha {{continuous}} air monitors (CAMs) {{will be used}} at the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant (WIPP) {{to measure}} airborne transuranic radioactivity that might be present in air exhaust or in work-place areas. WIPP CAMs are important to health and safety because {{they are used to}} alert workers to airborne radioactivity, to actuate air-effluent filtration systems, and to detect airborne radioactivity so that the radioactivity can be confined in a limited area. In 1993, the Environmental Evaluation Group (EEG) reported that CAM operational performance was affected by salt aerosol, and subsequently, the WIPP CAM design and usage were modified. In this report, operational data and current theories on aerosol collection were reviewed to determine CAM quantitative performance limitations. Since 1993, the overall CAM performance appears to have improved, but anomalous <b>alpha</b> <b>spectra</b> are present when sampling-filter salt deposits are at normal to high levels. This report shows that sampling-filter salt deposits directly affect radon-thoron daughter <b>alpha</b> <b>spectra</b> and overall monitor efficiency. Previously it was assumed that aerosol was mechanically collected on the surface of CAM sampling filters, but this review suggests that electrostatic and other particle collection mechanisms are more important than previously thought. The mechanism of sampling-filter particle collection is critical to measurement of acute releases of radioactivity. 41 refs...|$|R
