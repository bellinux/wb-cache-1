5|$|In a wind farm, {{individual}} turbines are interconnected with {{a medium}} voltage (usually 34.5 kV) {{power collection system}} and communications network.

5|$|In a wind farm, {{individual}} turbines are interconnected with {{a medium}} voltage (often 34.5 kV), {{power collection system}} and communications network.

5|$|Very little {{land and}} {{property}} was {{displaced by the}} project. Following the construction, the land formerly housing nine residential properties displaced during construction were leveled {{and turned into a}} park. A warehouse was reduced in size {{to make way for the}} project, as well as the relocation of Atlantic City Electric power lines leading to <b>a</b> <b>substation.</b> A promenade as part of Trump Marina was leveled to make way for new ramps, in which 37 ornamental lampposts which were dismantled were later shipped to the Tuckerton Seaport in nearby Tuckerton, which opened in 2000.|$|E
5|$|The station's {{boiler house}} houses three 380MWth International Combustion boilers, which are fuelled by {{pulverised}} bituminous coal. Each of these provide steam {{for one of}} three 140 megawatt (MW) Parsons turbo-alternators, situated in the station's turbine hall. These give the station a total generating capacity of 420MW. The electricity generated was fed at 24 kilovolt (kV) to <b>a</b> <b>substation</b> to power the smelter during operation. The substation also has a 132kV connection to the National Grid, where electricity is distributed to homes and other industries by Northern Electric Distribution Limited. The smelter's two pot lines required 310MW of the 420MW that the power station produces, so the excess 110MW which was fed into the national grid. Since the mothballing of the smelter, all exports now go to the grid.|$|E

50|$|In {{distributed}} generation {{projects such as}} a wind farm, <b>a</b> collector <b>substation</b> may be required. It resembles <b>a</b> distribution <b>substation</b> although power flow is in the opposite direction, from many wind turbines up into the transmission grid. Usually for economy of construction the collector system operates around 35 kV, and the collector substation steps up voltage to a transmission voltage for the grid. The collector substation can also provide power factor correction if it is needed, metering, {{and control of the}} wind farm. In some special cases <b>a</b> collector <b>substation</b> can also contain an HVDC converter station.|$|R

25|$|On 13 October 2015, {{train service}} was {{disrupted}} between Farrer Park and Hougang {{for more than}} half an hour due to a power fault.

25|$|Bispham Depot {{was built}} in 1898 and {{extended}} in 1914 by Blackpool & Fleetwood Tramroad Company, to house 36 trams on six tracks. <b>A</b> <b>substation</b> was {{to the side of}} the depot.

It was demolished to make way for a Sainsbury's supermarket and the depot's headstone was installed at Crich's National Tramway Museum.|$|E

25|$|In general, a {{distance}} of 7D (7 × Rotor Diameter of the Wind Turbine) is set between each turbine in a fully developed wind farm, but micrositing optimizes placement, particularly in hilly areas. Individual turbines are interconnected with a medium voltage (usually 34.5 kV) power collection system and communications network. At <b>a</b> <b>substation,</b> this medium-voltage electric current is increased in voltage with a transformer for connection to the high voltage transmission system. Construction of a land-based wind farm requires installation of the collector system and substation, and possibly access roads to each turbine site.|$|E
25|$|Medium-voltage circuit {{breakers}} rated between 1 and 72 kV may be assembled into metal-enclosed switchgear line ups for indoor use, {{or may be}} individual components installed outdoors in <b>a</b> <b>substation.</b> Air-break {{circuit breakers}} replaced oil-filled units for indoor applications, but are now themselves being replaced by vacuum circuit breakers (up to about 40.5 kV). Like the high voltage circuit breakers described below, these are also operated by current sensing protective relays operated through current transformers. The characteristics of MV breakers are given by international standards such as IEC 62271. Medium-voltage circuit breakers nearly always use separate current sensors and protective relays, instead of relying on built-in thermal or magnetic overcurrent sensors.|$|E
