500|$|The Swedish {{alphabet}} is a 29-letter alphabet, {{using the}} 26-letter ISO basic Latin alphabet plus the three additional letters Å/å, Ä/ä, and Ö/ö {{constructed in the}} 16th century by writing [...] "o" [...] and [...] "e" [...] {{on top of an}} [...] "a", and an [...] "e" [...] on top of an [...] "o". Though these combinations are historically modified versions of A and O according to the English range of usage for the term diacritic, these three characters are not considered to be diacritics within the Swedish application, but rather separate letters, and are independent letters following z. Before the release of the 13th edition of Svenska Akademiens ordlista in April 2006, w was treated as merely a variant of v used only in names (such as [...] "Wallenberg") and foreign words ("bowling"), and so was both sorted and pronounced as a v. Other diacritics (to use the broader English term usage referenced here) are unusual in Swedish; é is sometimes used to indicate that the stress falls on a terminal syllable containing e, especially when the stress changes the meaning (ide vs. idé, [...] "winter lair" [...] vs. [...] "idea") as well as in some names, like Kastrén; occasionally other acute accents and, less often, grave accents can be seen in names and some foreign words. The letter à is used to refer to unit cost (a loan from the French), equivalent to the <b>at</b> <b>sign</b> (@) in English.|$|E
2500|$|... @dril is a pseudonymous Twitter account {{best known}} for its {{idiosyncratic}} style of absurdist humor and non sequiturs. The account, its author, and the character associated with the tweets are all also commonly referred to as dril (the handle without the <b>at</b> <b>sign)</b> or wint (the display name), both rendered lowercase but often capitalized by others.|$|E
2500|$|While most {{languages}} {{do not use}} wholly logographic writing systems, many languages {{use some}} logograms. A good example of modern western logograms are the Hindu-Arabic numerals: everyone who uses those symbols understands what 1 means {{whether he or she}} calls it one, eins, uno, yi, ichi, ehad, ena, or jedan. Other western logograms include the ampersand &, used for and, the <b>at</b> <b>sign</b> @, used in many contexts for at, the percent sign % and the many signs representing units of currency ($, ¢, €, £, ¥ and so on.) ...|$|E

2500|$|In particular, {{since the}} late 20th century, the slash is used to permit more {{gender-neutral}} language {{in place of the}} traditional masculine or plural gender neutrals. In the case of English, this is usually restricted to degendered pronouns such as [...] "he/she" [...] or [...] "s/he". Most other Indo-European languages include more far-reaching use of grammatical gender. In these, the separate gendered desinences (grammatical suffices) of the words may be given divided by slashes or set off with parentheses. For example, in Spanish, [...] is a son and a [...] is a daughter; some proponents of gender-neutral language advocate the use of [...] or [...] when writing for a general audience or addressing a listener of unknown gender. Less commonly, the æ ligature or <b>at</b> <b>sign</b> [...] is used instead: [...] Similarly, in German, [...] refers to any secretary and [...] to an explicitly female secretary; some advocates of gender neutrality support forms such as [...] for general use. This does not always work smoothly, however: problems arise in the case of words like [...] ("doctor") where the explicitly female form [...] is umlauted and words like [...] ("Chinese person") where the explicitly female form [...] loses the terminal -e.|$|E
60|$|It was at Quito, the {{mountain}} capital of Ecuador, {{that the following}} passage at correspondence took place. Having occasion to buy {{a pair of shoes}} in a shop six feet by eight in size and with walls three feet thick, I noticed a mangy leopard skin on the floor. I had no Spanish. The shop-keeper had no English. But I was an adept <b>at</b> <b>sign</b> language. I wanted to know where I should go to buy leopard skins. On my scribble- pad I drew the interesting streets of a city. Then I drew a small shop, which, after much effort, I persuaded the proprietor into recognising as his shop. Next, I indicated in my drawing that on the many streets there were many shops. And, finally, I made myself into a living interrogation mark, pointing all the while from the mangy leopard skin to the many shops I had sketched.|$|E
