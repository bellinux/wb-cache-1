5|$|The action {{could not}} be opened until <b>a</b> <b>slight</b> forward {{movement}} of the slide handle released the action slide lock. In firing, the recoil of the shotgun gave <b>a</b> <b>slight</b> forward motion to the slide handle and released the action slide lock which enabled immediate opening of the action. In {{the absence of any}} recoil, the slide handle had to be pushed forward manually in order to release the action slide lock.|$|E

5|$|About {{four stages}} of {{glaciation}} {{have been recognized}} in the area during the Pleistocene, although the glacial history is poorly known. Monte Burney was glaciated during the last glacial maximum.

5|$|Barium is a soft, silvery-white metal, with <b>a</b> <b>slight</b> golden shade when ultrapure. The silvery-white {{color of}} barium metal rapidly vanishes upon {{oxidation}} in air yielding a dark gray oxide layer. Barium has a medium specific weight and good electrical conductivity. Ultrapure barium {{is very difficult}} to prepare, and therefore many properties of barium have not been accurately measured yet.|$|E
5|$|Chromic acid {{anodizing}} (or Type I anodizing) {{of aluminium}} is another electrochemical process, {{which does not}} lead to the deposition of chromium, but uses chromic acid as electrolyte in the solution. During anodization, an oxide layer is formed on the aluminium. The use of chromic acid, instead of the normally used sulfuric acid, leads to <b>a</b> <b>slight</b> difference of these oxide layers.|$|E

5|$|Flux-cored wire is {{considered}} to have some advantages for outdoor welding on-site, as the shielding gas plume {{is less likely to}} be blown away in a wind than shield gas from a conventional nozzle. <b>A</b> <b>slight</b> drawback is that, like SMAW (stick) welding, there may be some flux deposited over the weld bead, requiring more of a cleaning process between passes.|$|E

50|$|<b>A</b> <b>slighting</b> is the {{deliberate}} destruction, partial or complete, of a fortification without opposition. Sometimes, such {{as during the}} Wars of Scottish Independence and the English Civil War, the intention was to render the structure unusable as a fortress.

During the Wars of Scottish Independence, Robert the Bruce adopted <b>a</b> strategy of <b>slighting</b> Scottish castles to prevent them being occupied by the invading English. <b>A</b> strategy of <b>slighting</b> castles in Palestine was also adopted by the Mamelukes in their wars with the Crusaders.|$|R
