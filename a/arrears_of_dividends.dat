40|$|The {{literature}} survey on dividends shows that more explanation is needed though existing theories contribute considerably {{to the understanding}} <b>of</b> <b>dividends</b> including the rationale <b>of</b> paying <b>dividends,</b> smoothing <b>of</b> <b>dividends,</b> and greater frequency <b>of</b> <b>dividend</b> payments compared to stock repurchases. The purpose of this thesis is to explain the dividend phenomena using a reputation model {{in the world of}} imperfect information. In a two-period version of the model, the rationale <b>of</b> paying <b>dividends</b> and smoothing is analyzed. However, the reputation effect and the time pattern <b>of</b> <b>dividends</b> cannot be easily accommodated. We extend the model into a three-period model in which the behavior <b>of</b> <b>dividends</b> through time, and the market response on the change in dividends are analyzed. The reputation effect is incorporated such that the reliability of signalling improves with the passage of time. ^ New empirical results which support the reputation model are presented. The market response to the initial dividend announcement is analyzed using all the cases <b>of</b> <b>dividend</b> initiation recorded on the CRSP daily stock files from July 2, 1962, to December 31, 1987. For firms which announce dividends during their first year on a major exchange, the abnormal return on the announcement date <b>of</b> initial <b>dividends</b> is not significant. Also, the change in the magnitude of the market response to the change in dividends through time is analyzed. We group the announcements <b>of</b> <b>dividend</b> increases according to the number of years passed after the initiation <b>of</b> <b>dividends.</b> The market 2 ̆ 7 s response to unexpected dividend increases in earlier periods is smaller than the case <b>of</b> unexpected <b>dividend</b> increases in later periods. ^ The reputation model adds a new perspective to the analysis of dividends: the time aspect <b>of</b> <b>dividends,</b> that is, the effect of a consistent stream <b>of</b> <b>dividend</b> payments on the value of a firm. This model has direct applicability to all areas <b>of</b> <b>dividends</b> to better explain the dividend phenomena. ...|$|R

Variables in this study consist <b>of</b> <b>dividends,</b> dividend announcements, and a significant stock return on dividend announcement reflected the presence of abnormal return during the event period. This study employs the company 2 ̆ 7 s shares listed on Indonesia Stock Exchange and are actively traded.

40|$|This paper {{determines the}} market value <b>of</b> <b>dividends</b> in the UK during periods before and after 1997. Previous studies, which use the {{ex-dividend}} day method, tend to provide noisy and potentially biased measures <b>of</b> <b>dividend</b> value. We estimate the value <b>of</b> <b>dividends</b> from the prices of shares that are identical except for their dividend entitlements, and are traded concurrently (within the same hour). We argue that our estimates <b>of</b> <b>dividend</b> value are the cleanest yet available for the UK.

40|$|More {{recently}} {{researchers have}} turned to analyze how the tax structure, rather than the overall tax level, affects economic performance. For instance, several papers have investigated how taxation on corporate and individual (labor) income influences growth. Taxation <b>of</b> <b>dividend</b> income may also influence growth via its impact on investments and firm behavior. Within the academic community there is conflicting views about the impact taxation <b>of</b> <b>dividends</b> has on firm behavior and, hence, on economic performance. According to the "traditional view", taxation <b>of</b> <b>dividends</b> is distortionary and increases the cost of equity. According to the "new view", taxation <b>of</b> <b>dividends</b> does not influence the marginal cost of capital and consequently has no impact on investment decisions. To our knowledge, this paper is the first study to explore how tax rates on dividends affect economic growth, by using panel data from 1990 till 2008 for 18 European countries. We find that taxation <b>of</b> <b>dividend</b> income negatively influences economic growth, a result that corroborates the old view <b>of</b> <b>dividends</b> taxation as distortionary and also has some policy implication for the European countries in question...|$|R
40|$|This study {{tests the}} {{signaling}} theory <b>of</b> <b>dividends</b> by investigating {{the stock price}} reaction to dividend announcements on the Oslo Stock Exchange (OSE), and subsequent changes in the cash flows of the firms involved. This paper adds to existing evidence by examining the role <b>of</b> <b>dividends</b> in a market where the corporate ownership structure is notably different from the U. S. and the U. K., and where the motivation to use dividends as a signaling mechanism appears to be stronger. The results indicate significant abnormal stock returns are associated with announcements <b>of</b> <b>dividend</b> changes. The results are robust to alternative models <b>of</b> <b>dividend</b> expectations, after controlling {{for the impact of}} earnings announcements, and are consistent across sub-periods in the sample. The stock market reaction is most pronounced for large, positive dividend announcements that are followed by permanent cash flow increases. This evidence provides modest support for the signaling theory <b>of</b> <b>dividends</b> in Norway, but it does not support the proposition that corporate ownership structure is an important influence on the use <b>of</b> <b>dividends</b> as a signaling mechanism (JEL: G 32; G 35) ...|$|R
40|$|In this article, {{we propose}} a {{generalized}} friction model {{to test the}} information effect <b>of</b> <b>dividends.</b> The proposed model resolves the problem <b>of</b> <b>dividend</b> stickiness in the time-series data and provides a more reliable estimate for the relation between unexpected changes in dividends and earnings. Unlike previous studies, we specifically consider the dynamic partial adjustment <b>of</b> <b>dividends</b> in estimating the expected dividend component. Our results contain several important findings. First, the results support the contention that dividend changes reflect both expected and unexpected permanent earnings changes. Since Miller and Modigliani (1961) proposed the information hypothesis <b>of</b> <b>dividends,</b> financial {{researchers have sought to}} answer questions concerning whether dividends convey information and, if they do, what types of information are contained in dividends. The results in this study show that dividends are strongly related to a firm 2 ̆ 7 s permanent earnings estimates. Our results also show that dividend changes signal changes in management 2 ̆ 7 s views of the firm 2 ̆ 7 s future earnings prospects. The abnormal (unexpected) dividend, which is the difference between the current dividend and the conditional expectation <b>of</b> the current <b>dividend,</b> has on average a significant positive relation with the unexpected changes in the firm 2 ̆ 7 s permanent earnings. Second, there is evidence that the effectiveness <b>of</b> <b>dividend</b> signaling depends on firm-specific characteristics. Consistent with the existing dividend signaling theory, the strength <b>of</b> <b>dividend</b> signaling is negatively related to the firm 2 ̆ 7 s systematic risk, external equity financing, and size and positively related to net investments and the degree <b>of</b> <b>dividend</b> smoothing. Third, our results suggest that the generalized friction model is a more suitable framework for examining the information content <b>of</b> <b>dividends.</b> Watts (1973) took an approach similar to this study to examine the information effect <b>of</b> <b>dividends...</b>|$|R
