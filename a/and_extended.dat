5|$|Standard gauge rail {{services}} from Sydney {{came with the}} extension of the Main Southern line to Cootamundra and Junee in 1878 and the construction of the Murrumbidgee River Railway Bridge in 1881 allowed the line to be extended past Wagga Wagga to Henty and Albury later that year. A branch line was constructed to Temora in 1893 <b>and</b> <b>extended</b> to Barellan in 1908, Griffith in 1916 and Hillston in 1923. Further south, a branch line was completed from Junee to Narrandera in 1881 <b>and</b> <b>extended</b> to Hay by 1882. Another branch pushed south from Narrandera toward the Victorian border reaching Jerilderie in 1884 and the Murray at Tocumwal in 1898.|$|E

50|$|In {{addition}} to the main strip of the trail, there are several branches that lead to more remote areas of the Bloomington-Normal area. The main strip begins at Croxton Avenue, Southeast of Downtown Bloomington <b>and</b> <b>extends</b> north to Kerrick Rd. north of Normal. For most of the trail's extent the trail is proximal to Linden Street. The trail currently ends at these points; however, there are multiple branches extending from this route or very close to this route. There is a branch in the north that may be picked up at Linden St. <b>and</b> <b>extends</b> along Raab Rd. to Towanda Ave. The West branch of the trail can be accessed at Vernon Ave. <b>and</b> <b>extends</b> to the Northwest past Illinois State University Golf Course (between Raab Rd. and Gregory St.), and ends at Heartland Community College on Raab Road. The east branch is near Vernon Ave. <b>and</b> <b>extends</b> to past Airport Rd. to route 29 (with a few additional branches in that area). The southwest branch begins at Lincoln Street <b>and</b> <b>extends</b> through the southern downtown area of Bloomington and continues west to Illinois Route 9 west of Bloomington. The southeast branch is picked up at Hamilton Road north of the State Farm Corporate building <b>and</b> <b>extends</b> from Commerce Parkway to Streid Drive.|$|R

5|$|Adderall is {{available}} as immediate-release tablets or two different extended-release formulations. The extended-release capsules are generally {{used in the}} morning.

The longer extended-release formulation, approved for 16 hours, is available under the brand Mydayis.

5|$|Although {{precursors}} to {{this table}} exist, its invention is generally credited to Russian chemist Dmitri Mendeleev in 1869.

5|$|Amid rising {{concerns}} over {{the threat of a}} French invasion, Sir Thomas Page surveyed the blockhouse in 1778 and concluded that its guns were too closely packed together and that they could not easily fire down-river, proposing that a larger fort be built along the Thames to the east to rectify this problem. New Tavern Fort was constructed shortly afterwards and the eastern Gravesend Blockhouse gun platform was redesigned <b>and</b> <b>extended</b> as part of the work. Two volunteer militia companies were established in 1794 and 1797 to support the blockhouse and in 1805 it was equipped with 19 32 lb guns.|$|E

5|$|As {{in other}} dromaeosaurs, Velociraptor tails had long bony {{projections}} (prezygapophyses) {{on the upper}} surfaces of the vertebrae, as well as ossified tendons underneath. The prezygapophyses began on the tenth tail (caudal) vertebra <b>and</b> <b>extended</b> forward to brace four to ten additional vertebrae, depending on position in the tail. These were once thought to fully stiffen the tail, forcing the entire tail {{to act as a}} single rod-like unit. However, at least one specimen has preserved a series of intact tail vertebrae curved sideways into an S-shape, suggesting that there was considerably more horizontal flexibility than once thought.|$|E
