5|$|In 1945 Parsons {{separated}} from Helen after {{having an affair}} with her sister Sara; when Sara left him for L. Ron Hubbard, he conducted the Babalon Working, a series of rituals designed to invoke the Thelemic goddess Babalon to Earth.

After Hubbard and Sara defrauded him of his life savings, Parsons resigned from the O.T.O. <b>and</b> <b>went</b> <b>through</b> various jobs while acting as a consultant for the Israeli rocket program.

5|$|Proposals were {{submitted}} by Bell, Boeing Vertol/Grumman team, Hughes, Lockheed, and Sikorsky.

It is Norway's most successful club, having won the Norwegian Premier League twenty-two {{times and the}} Norwegian Football Cup nine times.

It then joined the regional Class B <b>and</b> <b>went</b> <b>through</b> several promotions and relegations until joining the inaugural eleven-conference top-tier League of Norway in 1937–38.

5|$|Sexual Politics {{originated}} as Millett's PhD dissertation and {{was published}} in 1970, {{the same year that}} she was awarded her doctorate from Columbia University. The bestselling book, a critique of patriarchy in Western society and literature, addressed the sexism and heterosexism of the modern novelists D. H. Lawrence, Henry Miller, and Norman Mailer and contrasted their perspectives with the dissenting viewpoint of the homosexual author Jean Genet. Millett questioned the origins of patriarchy, argued that sex-based oppression was both political and cultural, and posited that undoing the traditional family was the key to true sexual revolution. In its first year on the market, the book sold 80,000 copies <b>and</b> <b>went</b> <b>through</b> seven printings and is considered to be the movement's manifesto.|$|E
