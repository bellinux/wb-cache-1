5|$|The {{types of}} {{clothing}} worn and {{the materials used}} during the Han period depended upon social class. Wealthy folk could afford silk robes, skirts, socks, and mittens, coats made of badger or fox fur, duck plumes, <b>and</b> <b>slippers</b> with inlaid leather, pearls, and silk lining. Peasants commonly wore clothes made of hemp, wool, and ferret skins.|$|E

Silk clothes found in Han tombs include padded robes, {{double-layered}} robes, single-layered robes, single-layered skirts, shoes, socks, and mittens. The wealthy also wore fox and badger furs, wild duck plumes, <b>and</b> <b>slippers</b> with inlaid leather or silk lining; those of more modest means could wear wool and ferret skins. Large bamboo-matted suitcases found in Han tombs contained clothes and luxury items such as patterned fabric and embroidery, common silk, damask and brocade, and the leno (or gauze) weave, all with rich colors and designs. The Han also had tools for ironing clothes.|$|E

Handicrafts are {{the major source of}} rural income and comprises a fairly large share in the small-scale industries of the province.

The manufacture of abacá products such as Manila hemp, hats, bags, mats, furniture, home decors, <b>and</b> <b>slippers</b> {{is one of the main}} sources of income in the rural areas. Production of abaca fiber experienced a boom from the late 1800s until the American period. Fishing {{is the main}} livelihood along both shores of the province.

The rent agreement was also found, which said the house was rented for Rs. 10,000 on 9 September. The attackers apparently stayed there for 20 to 25 days.|$|E
25|$|Yue Fei's {{father used}} his family's {{plot of land}} for {{humanitarian}} efforts, but after it was destroyed in the flood, the young Yue Fei was forced to help his father toil in the fields to survive. Yue received most of his primary education from his father. In 1122 Yue joined the army, but had to return home later that year {{after the death of}} his father. In ancient China, a person was required by law to temporarily resign from their job when their parents died so they could observe the customary period of mourning. For instance, Yue would have had to mourn his father's death for three years, but in all actually only 27 months. During this time, he would wear coarse mourning robes, caps, <b>and</b> <b>slippers,</b> while abstaining from silken garments. When his mother died in 1136, he retired from a decisive battle against the Jin dynasty for the mourning period, but he was forced to cut the bereavement short because his generals begged him to come back.|$|E

The grey coat he wears with a white neckerchief is opened at the chest, revealing a gold-brocade waistcoat, his lower half is clothed in breeches, stockings <b>and</b> <b>slippers.</b> The chaplain wears a black coat with a white collar, grey stockings and black shoes with gold buckles, the costume of a social inferior to Graham, but indicating his educated status. The clerk's dress is similarly simple, a brown jacket, bluish-green waistcoat and white collar, while the steward wears a white apron, smock and cap with a black collar, and brown trousers. The black servant's dress is richer, a white cap and pink neckerchief, and a green buttoned velvet coat with a yellow waistcoat. Trump wears Graham's wig.

25|$|Baker-Carr {{recalled}} Wilson {{standing in}} dressing gown <b>and</b> <b>slippers</b> uttering “sardonic little jests to all and sundry within earshot” as GHQ packed up to evacuate, behaviour which historian Dan Todman comments was probably “reassuring for some but profoundly irritating for others”. Macready recorded Wilson (27 August) “walking slowly up and down” {{the room at}} Noyon which had been commandeered as headquarters with a “comical, whimsical expression”, clapping his hands and chanting “We shall never get there, we shall never get there … to the sea, to the sea, to the sea”, although he also recorded that this was probably intended {{to keep up the}} spirits of more junior officers. His infamous “sauve qui peut” order to Snow, GOC 4th Division, (27 August) ordering unnecessary ammunition and officers’ kits to be dumped so that tired and wounded soldiers could be carried, was, according to Swinton, probably intended out of concern for the soldiers rather than out of panic. Smith-Dorrien was later rebuked by French for countermanding it. Lord Loch thought the order showed “GHQ had lost their heads” whilst General Haldane thought it “a mad order” (both in their diaries for 28 August). Major-General Pope-Hennessey later alleged (in the 1930s) that Wilson had ordered the destruction of orders issued during the retreat to hide the degree of panic.|$|E

500|$|In {{the early}} 19th century, canvaswork in tent or petit point stitch again became popular. [...] The new fashion, using printed {{patterns}} and coloured tapestry wools imported from Berlin, was called Berlin wool work. Patterns and wool for Berlin work appeared in London in 1831. Berlin work was stitched to hand-coloured or charted patterns, leaving {{little room for}} individual expression, and was so popular that [...] "Berlin work" [...] became synonymous with [...] "canvaswork". [...] Its chief characteristic was intricate three-dimensional looks created by careful shading. [...] By mid-century, Berlin work was executed in bright colours {{made possible by the}} new synthetic dyes. [...] Berlin work was very durable and was made into furniture covers, cushions, bags, <b>and</b> <b>slippers</b> as well as for embroidered [...] "copies" [...] of popular paintings.
