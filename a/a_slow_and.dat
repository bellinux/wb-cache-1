5|$|By 1948, as {{the purely}} {{occupational}} mission was accomplished, {{troops of the}} corps focused more military training and field exercises designed {{to prepare them for}} combat. Its force was eventually downsized to the 24th Infantry Division on Kyūshū and 25th Infantry Division on mid-Honshū. The US Army continued <b>a</b> <b>slow</b> <b>and</b> steady process of post-war drawdown and demobilization on its own, and on 28 March 1950, the corps was formally inactivated in Japan, and its command consolidated with other units.|$|E
5|$|The {{principal}} melody in {{this movement}} (E) {{is taken from}} an old Hussar song, for which Prokofiev provided an optional baritone part. The melody first appears in <b>a</b> <b>slow</b> <b>and</b> somewhat dissonant statement, after which the pace quickens: sleigh bells, rapid pizzicato strings, and piano combine {{to give the impression}} of a fast winter's journey by means of the troika, a traditional Russian three-horse sled. The ride is accompanied at regular intervals by the song theme, which brings the movement to its close with a slow repetition of its final phrase.|$|E
5|$|The {{weakness}} of both Germany and Russia after World War I empowered Finland {{and made a}} peaceful, domestic Finnish social and political settlement possible. The reconciliation led to <b>a</b> <b>slow</b> <b>and</b> painful, but steady, national unification. In the end, the power vacuum and interregnum of 1917–1919 {{gave way to the}} Finnish compromise. From 1919 to 1991, the democracy and sovereignty of the Finns withstood challenges from right-wing and left-wing political radicalism, the crisis of World War II and pressure from the Soviet Union during the Cold War.|$|E

5|$|Although {{generally}} <b>a</b> <b>slow</b> <b>and</b> perfectionist composer, Walton {{was capable}} of working quickly when necessary. Some of his stage and screen music was written to tight deadlines. He regarded his ballet and incidental music as of less importance than his concert works and was generally dismissive of what he produced. Of his ballets for Sadler's Wells, The Wise Virgins (1940) is an arrangement of eight extracts from choral and instrumental music by Bach. The Quest (1943), written in great haste, is, according to Grove, oddly reminiscent of Vaughan Williams. Neither of these works established itself in the regular repertoire, unlike the ballet score Walton arranged from the music of Façade, the music for which was expanded for full orchestra, still retaining the jazz influences and the iconoclastic wit of the original. Music from The Quest and {{the whole of the}} Viola Concerto were used for another Sadler's Wells ballet, O.W., in 1972.|$|E
5|$|At this distance, {{the land}} {{would be far}} beyond the maximum {{anticipated}} size of the city's growth, greatly reducing any potential hazards. The London and South Western Railway(LSWR)– which had connected London to Woking in 1838– would enable bodies and mourners to be shipped from London to the site easily and cheaply. Although the Brookwood site was a long distance from London, Broun and Sprye argued that {{the speed of the}} railway made it both quicker and cheaper to reach than the seven existing cemeteries, all of which required <b>a</b> <b>slow</b> <b>and</b> expensive horse-drawn hearse to carry the body and mourners from London to the burial site.|$|E
5|$|Benzodiazepines have a {{reputation}} with patients and doctors for causing a severe and traumatic withdrawal; however, this is in large {{part due to the}} withdrawal process being poorly managed. Over-rapid withdrawal from benzodiazepines increases the severity of the withdrawal syndrome and increases the failure rate. <b>A</b> <b>slow</b> <b>and</b> gradual withdrawal customised to the individual and, if indicated, psychological support is the most effective way of managing the withdrawal. Opinion as to the time needed to complete withdrawal ranges from four weeks to several years. A goal of less than six months has been suggested, but due to factors such as dosage and type of benzodiazepine, reasons for prescription, lifestyle, personality, environmental stresses, and amount of available support, a year or more may be needed to withdraw.|$|E

5|$|By {{the latter}} part of the 1900s Ravel had {{established}} a pattern of writing works for piano and subsequently arranging them for full orchestra. He was in general <b>a</b> <b>slow</b> <b>and</b> painstaking worker, and reworking his earlier piano compositions enabled him to increase the number of pieces published and performed. There appears to have been no mercenary motive for this; Ravel was known for his indifference to financial matters. The pieces that began as piano compositions and were then given orchestral dress were Pavane pour une infante défunte (orchestrated 1910), Une barque sur l'océan (1906, from the 1905 piano suite Miroirs), the Habanera section of Rapsodie espagnole (1907–08), Ma mère l'Oye (1908–10, orchestrated 1911), Valses nobles et sentimentales (1911, orchestrated 1912), Alborada del gracioso (from Miroirs, orchestrated 1918) and Le tombeau de Couperin (1914–17, orchestrated 1919).|$|E
5|$|General Matsui, {{along with}} the Army General Staff, envisaged making <b>a</b> <b>slow</b> <b>and</b> steady march on Nanking, but his {{subordinates}} refused to play along and instead raced eagerly {{with each other to}} be the first to get to the city. Soon all units were roaring to Nanking at the breakneck pace of up to forty kilometers (25 miles) per day. For instance, the 10th Army captured the key town of Guangde on November 30 three days before it was even supposed to start its planned advance, and the SEA captured Danyang on December 2 more than five days ahead of schedule. In order to achieve such speeds, the Japanese soldiers carried little with them except weaponry and ammunition. Because they were marching well ahead of most of their supply lines they had to purchase or loot their food from Chinese civilians along the way.|$|E
5|$|In the United States, {{the album}} entered the Billboard 200 albums chart at number190, {{the week of}} September 3, 1983. The album had <b>a</b> <b>slow</b> <b>and</b> steady climb, and peaked at eight on the Billboard 200 on the week ending October 20, 1984, {{more than a year}} after its release. It also peaked at twenty on the Top R/Hip-Hop Albums. Within a year, Madonna had sold 2.8million copies in the United States. It placed at number seven on the year-end chart for 1984 and at number25 on the year-end chart for 1985, with Madonna {{becoming}} the top pop artist for the year 1985. After 17 years since its release, the album was certified quintuple platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) for shipment of five million copies across United States. With the advent of the Nielsen SoundScan era in 1991, the album sold a further 450,000 copies as of August 2010.|$|E

5|$|The Sholes and Glidden was {{the first}} commercially {{successful}} typewriter. Industrialization and corporate growth in the late 19th century produced a business environment for which the device was well suited. New communications technologies, such as the telegraph and telephone, facilitated geographic expansion and increased {{the speed with which}} business was conducted. The resulting increase in the volume of correspondence required messages to be produced quickly and legibly. Before the typewriter, clerks and copyists could write relatively quickly in shorthand or longhand. The comprehension of these scripts, however, required either special training or close concentration. Typesetting was used when legibility was important, but it was <b>a</b> <b>slow</b> <b>and</b> expensive process. The typewriter succeeded because it simultaneously addressed both issues.|$|E
5|$|The black honeyeater may be {{adversely}} affected {{by the loss of}} the emu bush to grazing and weed control by farmers. Despite the fact that the population trend appears to be decreasing, the decline is not believed to be particularly rapid; the current population seems to be of sufficient numbers, and the species has a sufficiently large range, for the species to be evaluated as of species of least concern by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). However Claire A. Runge and colleagues observed that the black honeyeaters' range across inland Australia contracted after years of low rainfall and showed <b>a</b> <b>slow</b> <b>and</b> incomplete recovery even after several years. They added that although nomadic species such as the black honeyeater may have a large distribution, they are often habitat specialists and hence may only occupy a small area within their range. Thus the risk of extinction of these species may be underestimated.|$|E
5|$|Before {{moving over}} the mountains, the 20th Division {{headquarters}} elected to destroy its cryptographic materials rather than carry them. As the wet weather made burning them page by page <b>a</b> <b>slow</b> <b>and</b> difficult process, and a fire might {{attract the attention}} of the Allied Air Forces, someone decided to simply bury them in a steel trunk in a stream bed. An Australian sapper checking the stream bed for booby traps with a metal detector discovered it, and it was dug up in the belief that it was a mine. An intelligence officer recognised the contents as code books and soon it {{was on its way to}} the Central Bureau in Brisbane. There, the pages were carefully dried out and photographed. On 4 February 1944, Central Bureau codebreakers decrypted a thirteen-part message that laid out the decisions reached at a conference of high-ranking Japanese officers. Copies of the material were quickly sent to Arlington Hall. In January 1944, Arlington Hall had decrypted 1,846 Japanese army messages. In March 1944, with the Sio code books in hand, it decrypted 36,000 messages.|$|E

5|$|Nevertheless, Brown was {{successful}} in the tour matches when he played as an opener. He ended the tour with eight centuries {{and a total of}} 1,448 first-class runs at an average of 57.92, behind only Bradman, Hassett and Morris in the runs and averages, with a highest score of 200 against Cambridge University. Brown's tally of eight centuries was second only to Bradman, and took his tally on English soil to 18 first-class tons. Excluding the matches against Worcestershire, the MCC and the first two Tests, in which Brown had scored 25, 26, 17, 24 and 32 batting in the middle order while Barnes and Morris opened, Brown scored 1,324 runs at 66.20 while opening in the other matches, which would have put him in a clear fourth place on the batting averages. Following his omission from the Test team midway through the tour, Brown batted in <b>a</b> <b>slow</b> <b>and</b> conservative manner in order to score more runs and regain his position, much to the chagrin of the crowds.|$|E
5|$|The first geared {{clock was}} invented in the 11th century by the Arab {{engineer}} Ibn Khalaf al-Muradi in Islamic Iberia; it was a water clock that employed a complex gear train mechanism, including both segmental and epicyclic gearing, capable of transmitting high torque. The clock was unrivalled in its use of sophisticated complex gearing, until the mechanical clocks of the mid-14th century. Al-Muradi's clock also employed the use of mercury in its hydraulic linkages, which could function mechanical automata. Al-Muradi's work was known to scholars working under Alfonso X of Castile, hence the mechanism {{may have played a}} role in the development of the European mechanical clocks. Other monumental water clocks constructed by medieval Muslim engineers also employed complex gear trains and arrays of automata. Like the earlier Greeks and Chinese, Arab engineers at the time also developed a liquid-driven escapement mechanism which they employed in some of their water clocks. Heavy floats were used as weights and a constant-head system was used as an escapement mechanism, which was present in the hydraulic controls they used to make heavy floats descend at <b>a</b> <b>slow</b> <b>and</b> steady rate.|$|E
5|$|The most {{significant}} storm {{of the season}} was Hurricane Floyd, a strong Category4 hurricane that caused devastating flooding along the East Coast of the United States, especially in North Carolina. Damage from the storm totaled approximately $6.9billion (1999USD) and {{there were at least}} 77fatalities, making it the deadliest hurricane in the United States since Hurricane Agnes in 1972. Flooding from Floyd in North Carolina followed Hurricane Dennis, <b>a</b> <b>slow</b> <b>and</b> erraticmoving storm that dropped heavy rainfall in the eastern portion of the state. Tropical Depression Eleven in October contributed to extreme flooding in Mexico, which left 636people dead and caused $491.3million in damage, though impact could not be distinguished from the storm itself. Hurricane Irene caused extensive flooding in Cuba and Florida, with lesser effects in the Bahamas and North Carolina. Irene was the secondcostliest storm of the season, with about $800million in damage. Hurricane Lenny was an unusual eastwardmoving storm in the Caribbean Sea and a strong lateseason storm. It caused extensive damage in the Lesser Antilles in the month of November. Collectively, the storms of the 1999Atlantic hurricane season caused at least 123fatalities and $8.58billion in losses.|$|E

5|$|Trillium grandiflorum {{is one of}} {{the most}} popular trilliums in cultivation, {{primarily}} because of the size of its flowers and its relative ease of cultivation. Although not particularly demanding, its cultivation is <b>a</b> <b>slow</b> <b>and</b> rather uncertain process, due to usually slow growth, wide variations in growth speed and sometimes capricious germination rates. As a result, the vast majority of plants and rhizomes in commerce are collected in the wild, and such heavy collecting, combined with other pressures such as habitat destruction and grazing, may effectively endanger the plants in some areas. This also creates tensions between Trillium enthusiasts and conservation proponents. Transplantation (as with almost all non-weedy wild plants) is a delicate process, and in many cases results in the death of the plant. In cultivation, T. grandiflorum may flower in as little as 4 to 5 years after germination (compared to the usual 7 to 10 in the wild), but these cases appear to be exceptions rather than the rule. One study revealed 20 or so individuals performing so well out of about 10,000 seeds planted, only 20% of which germinated after a year. However, barring plant destruction, T. grandiflorum can continue flowering every year after it has begun.|$|E
