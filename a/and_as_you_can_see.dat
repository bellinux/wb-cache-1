6000|$|... "As to the town, I {{warned the}} people who {{returned}} {{that it might be}} again destroyed before long, and therefore there has been no solid building. The houses have all been lightly run up with wood, which is plentiful enough in the hills, and no great harm, therefore, will be done if it is again burnt down. The pagoda and palace are the only stone buildings in it. They did some harm to the former, last time, by firing shot at it for a day or two; <b>and,</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>see</b> for yourself, no attempt has since been made to repair it, and I do not suppose they will trouble to damage it further.|$|E
60|$|But I {{can assure}} you, {{in the first}} place, that St. Louis {{is by no means}} {{altogether}} new. I have been up at it, and found most lovely and true colour left in many parts: the crown, which you will find, after our mornings at the Spanish chapel, is of importance, nearly untouched; the lines of the features and hair, though all more or less reproduced, still of definite and notable character; and the junction throughout of added colour so careful, that the harmony of the whole, if not delicate with its old tenderness, is at least, in its coarser way, solemn and unbroken. Such as the figure remains, it still possesses extreme beauty--profoundest interest. <b>And,</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>see</b> it from below with your glass, it leaves little to be desired, and may be dwelt upon with more profit than nine out of ten of the renowned pictures of the Tribune or the Pitti. You will enter into the spirit of it better if I first translate for you a little piece from the Fioretti di San Francesco.|$|E

5000|$|There was {{a design}} I {{had done for}} Terminator 2. It was a machine/weapon/robot with 4 legs, like a crab, {{and it had a}} very {{distinct}} head shape.

Ron and I both liked that shape, <b>and</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>see</b> there is a distinct resemblance there to the final Starfury design. It was a case of “Can we take the essence of that shape - which has a cool and aggressive look - and merge it with a vectored thrust multi-engine configuration?” As it turned out, the answer was “Yes!” We tried a trilateral symmetry, but there’s a reason quadrilateral symmetry is preferable.

5000|$|New York politics, {{especially}} on the Republican side, is run by party bosses. There’s really no democracy. There hasn’t been in the modern history of Republican politics in New York.

50|$|Here we {{tell the}} Maude system to rewrite our input term {{according}} to the rewrite theory, and we tell it to stop after 3 rewrite steps (remember that rewrite rules {{do not have to}} be terminating or confluent so an upper bound is not a bad idea), we just want see what sort of state we end up in after randomly choosing 3 matching rules. <b>And</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>see</b> the state this person ends up in might look a bit strange. (When you're married at the age of one you kind of stick out a bit in kindergarten I guess). It also says 4 rewrite steps, although we specifically stated an upper limit of 3 rewrite steps, this is because rewrite steps that are the result of applying equations does not count (they do not change the term, at least if the equations are sane). In this example one of the equations of the NAT module has been used to reduce the term 0 + s(0) to s(0), which accounts for the 4'th rewrite step.|$|E
50|$|The King of Ayutthaya was strolling in {{the royal}} gardens with his courtesans and courtiers. As they reached a garden pond, the king, {{thinking}} to challenge Sri Thanonchai's wit, taunted him. “You are brainy, Sri Thanonchai. Can {{you think of a}} way to make your king go into this pond?” Sri Thanonchai answered. “Your Majesty, I could not persuade you to get into this water. That I could not do. But I could certainly make you come out of the water”. “Let us see” and the king quickly took off his clothes and lowered himself into the pond. Floating in the water, he asked. “Now, Sri Thanonchai. Start talking. How will you make me come out of this water?” Sri Thanonchai laughed. Bowing politely to the king, he said “Dear Majesty. I was not attempting to make you come out of this pond. I was attempting to make you go into the pond. <b>And</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>see,</b> I have succeeded!”. “Sri Thanonchai, you are too clever!” exclaimed the king. He came out of the water graciously, pleased with the wit of Sri Thanonchai.|$|E
5000|$|The {{result was}} the [...] "all-new, star-studded, big-money" [...] Match Game 73 for CBS, with Rayburn {{returning}} as host and Olson returning as announcer. The year in the title was updated on the New Year's Eve broadcast {{for the next six}} years. The game play for this version had two solo contestants attempting to match the answers given by a six-celebrity panel. Richard Dawson was the first regular panelist. Due to CBS News coverage of the Watergate hearings, the network delayed the premiere one week from its slated date of June 25 to July 2.The first week's panelists were Dawson, Michael Landon, Vicki Lawrence, Jack Klugman, Jo Ann Pflug, and Anita Gillette. Rayburn reassured viewers of the first CBS show that [...] "This is your old favorite, updated with more action, more money <b>and,</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>see,</b> more celebrities." [...] The first few weeks of the show were somewhat {{different from the rest of}} the run. At first, many of the questions fit into the more bland and innocuous mold of the earlier seasons of the original series. In addition, many of the frequent panelists on the early episodes were not regulars later in the series but had appeared on the 1960s version, including Klugman, Arlene Francis, and Bert Convy, the last of whom was later chosen as host of the show's 1990 revival before being diagnosed with a brain tumor which eventually took his life.|$|E

I should think the Great Trianon has quite twice the room of our own Executive residence; <b>and,</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> well imagine, from what has already been said, the Capitol itself would be but a speck among the endless edifices of the chateau. The projection in the centre of the latter is considerably larger than the capitol, and it materially exceeds that building in cubic contents. Now this projection is but a small part indeed of the long line of façade, it actually appearing too short for the ranges of wings.|$|R
