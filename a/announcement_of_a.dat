In 2002 the firm helped AMD introduce its Opteron and Athlon microprocessors.

5|$|Prior to the <b>announcement</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> new Star Trek incarnation, Star Trek: Voyager co-creators Rick Berman, Michael Piller, and Jeri Taylor {{conceived}} the basic concepts and characters during secret developmental meetings. The Kazon were originally {{created as a}} part of the show's basic premise of Voyagers crew being stranded in the Delta Quadrant. Berman, Piller, and Taylor reasoned that the characters would be traveling through an area of space controlled by a new alien race, serving as the show's primary antagonists, and created the Kazon to fill this role.|$|E
5|$|At Sony's 2012 Electronic Entertainment Expo (E3) press conference, the North American {{release date}} was {{confirmed}} as March 12, 2013. A single-player demo was shown, revealing new gameplay mechanics and combat systems. An {{encounter with the}} sea monster Charybdis {{was included in the}} demo, but this sequence was cut from the final game. Charybdis was recast as the creature that Alecto transforms into during the final fight of the game. The same day, Papy confirmed on PlayStation.Blog that a collector's edition of the game would be released. He said Ascension was being developed to feature stereoscopic 3D, but it was ultimately cut. At gamescom 2012, new multiplayer footage was shown, followed by the <b>announcement</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> multiplayer beta.|$|E
5|$|Cristián Blasser and Mario Gutiérrez, {{students}} from the Escuela Consolidada de San Carlos (now Liceo Politécnico de San Carlos), and Sergio Rojas, {{who worked at the}} school, formed a band in 1968. Upon hearing an <b>announcement</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> bands tournament organized by La Discusión radio station from Chillán, they recruited Germaín de la Fuente, who was well known in the local scene for his vocal abilities. Blasser and Gutiérrez played the guitar, Rojas the bass, and De la Fuente became the keyboardist and lead vocalist. Most of the band members were musically inspired by acts such as The Beatles except De la Fuente, who did not like them at all and wanted to do bolero music. As a result, they created a mixed style known as the Balada rockmántica or Bolero-beat.|$|E

5|$|Next, Paramount {{sought to}} consult {{franchise}} creator Gene Roddenberry. He {{turned down the}} idea of running the show, given the time that production of The Original Series had distracted him from his family. But Paramount {{told him that it}} was impossible to pursue the new series otherwise, Roddenberry began to make plans for the series—with a new cast, as he wanted to avoid retreading and recreating the same roles now seen in the film franchise. Although they had not planned on it originally, Paramount hired Roddenberry to oversee the production and fired Strangis. However, one of his ideas appeared in the premise of The Next Generation, that the Federation and the Klingons had become allies. The first <b>announcement</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> new series was made by Roddenberry publicly on October 10, 1986.|$|E
5|$|On January 6, 2010, Disney {{announced}} that the film would be released in the United States and Canada on May 20, 2011, following Columbia Pictures' <b>announcement</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> delay in the Spider-Man reboot and Paramount Pictures slating Thor for May 6, 2011. The film was released in IMAX 3D, as well as traditional 2D and IMAX format, with Dolby 7.1 surround sound. This film {{was also the first}} film to be released in the 4DX motion theaters in Mexico and in the Western Hemisphere, featuring strobe lights, tilting seats, blowing wind and fog and odor effects.

5|$|The XJ220 was not {{initially}} {{intended to be}} a production car, but, following the reception of the concept and financial interest from serious buyers, a feasibility study was carried out by teams from TWR and Jaguar. Its conclusion was that such a car would be technically feasible (subject to engineering changes), {{and that it would be}} financially viable. The <b>announcement</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> limited production run of 220 to 350 cars came on 20 December 1989. The list price on 1 January 1990 was £290,000 exclusive of value added tax, options and delivery charges, but by 1992 that had increased considerably owing to indexation of contracts. The offer was four times oversubscribed, and deposits of £50,000 exclusive of Value Added Tax (VAT) were taken from around 1400 customers; first deliveries were planned for mid-1992.|$|E
40|$|The Ninth Circuit {{recently}} {{ruled that}} <b>a</b> company <b>announcement</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> internal investigation {{is insufficient to}} establish a loss causation theory in a securities fraud action under section 10 (b) of the Exchange Act. Specifically, it stated that <b>an</b> <b>announcement</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> investigation is not a corrective disclosure—an event that discloses a company’s fraud. This Comment argues courts should apply a rebuttable presumption that broadens the definition of corrective disclosure to include <b>announcements</b> <b>of</b> these investigations. This Comment concludes that, unlike the Ninth Circuit’s narrow definition of corrective disclosure, the rebuttable presumption framework would allow investors {{the opportunity to be}} fully compensated for their losses in securities fraud actions...|$|R

5|$|The remaster was a {{commercial}} success, breaking sales records.

Capcom announced that the remaster exceeded sales of one million copies by April 2015. As of March 2017, the remaster had sold 1.9 million copies worldwide across all platforms. Its commercial success resulted in Capcom's <b>announcement</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> similar edition of Resident Evil Zero in 2015. A compilation called Resident Evil: Origins Collection, which includes both Resident Evil HD Remaster and Resident Evil Zero HD Remaster, was released on January 22, 2016.|$|E
5|$|Commercially, {{the album}} {{experienced}} {{success on the}} Australian Albums Chart. It debuted at number four on 25 January 1998, the highest debuting album by an Australian female artist of the year. It stalled at number eight during its second and third week, but fell outside the top ten in its fourth. By 26 April, the album had spent 14 weeks in the chart and was placed at number 48, before leaving the chart. When Minogue promoted the album with live shows, alongside the <b>announcement</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> national tour, Impossible Princess re-entered the charts on 10 May at number 40. Whilst embarking her Intimate and Live tour in June, it entered the top ten for three non-consecutive weeks between the months June–July. In total, the album was present for 35 weeks in the top 50, making this Minogue's longest charting album at the time until her following studio album, Light Years, spent 41 weeks in the top 50 chart. The album was certified Platinum by the Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA) for physical shipments of 70,000 units.|$|E
5|$|In February 2015, YouTube {{released}} a secondary mobile app known as YouTube Kids. The app {{is designed to}} provide an experience optimized for children, and features a simplified user interface, curated selections of channels featuring age-approriate content (including existing channels and entertainment brands), and parental control features. Later on August 26, 2015, YouTube launched YouTube Gaming—a video gaming-oriented sub-site and app that is intended to compete with the Amazon.com-owned Twitch.tv. 2015 also saw the <b>announcement</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> premium YouTube service titled YouTube Red, which provides users with both ad-free content as well as the ability to download videos among other features. On August 10, 2015, Google announced that it was creating a new company, Alphabet, to act as the holding company for Google, with the change in financial reporting to begin {{in the fourth quarter of}} 2015. YouTube remains as a subsidiary of Google. In January 2016, YouTube expanded its headquarters in San Bruno by purchasing an office park for $215million.

5|$|In {{the second}} quarter of 2012, the Naga 2012 was released. Similarly to the Naga Epic, it came with {{interchangeable}} side panels. The Naga 2012 supported Razer's Synapse 2.0 software allowing all the buttons to be programmed and that information to be stored online. The other 2012 installment was the Naga Hex, the first mouse in the series to have only six programmable side-on buttons. Razer noted it was made for multiplayer online battle arenas (MOBAs), such as League of Legends and Diablo 3, instead of massively multiplayer online games (MMOs). In May of the same year, the Wraith Red edition was released. The only difference between the versions was the coloring. In March 2013, after the <b>announcement</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> partnership between Razer and Riot Games, a League of Legends style Naga Hex was released, with the only difference being the design and the change from a plastic to a matte surface.|$|E
5|$|More {{extensive}} coverage {{has been given}} by some sites. VentureBeat noted that, while comparable with other similar campaigns, Operation Rainfall was notable for maintaining civility during its efforts. Zach Kaplan of Nintendo Life said that the campaign {{needed to make a}} clear mark, showing that the success of the then-announced Xenoblade Chronicles was not a fluke. In a later feature for the same website, Thomas Whitehead said that the otherwise niche and slightly unremarkable Pandora's Tower had been granted a level of mystique and anticipation among fans through its inclusion in the Operation Rainfall campaign. In an interview feature conducted after the <b>announcement</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> North American release for Pandora's Tower, PC World noted that Operation Rainfall was going against the trend with its complete success in pushing to bring all three titles to North America. In particular, it compared them to the unsuccessful efforts by fans to bring Japan-exclusive entries of the Mother series to the West.|$|E
5|$|Of {{the five}} games, Dead Phoenix was {{canceled}} and only P.N.03 retained {{its status as}} a GameCube exclusive, though it was a critical and commercial failure. Both Viewtiful Joe and Killer7 sold modestly, the former despite critical acclaim and the latter owing to polarized reviews. Even so, Killer7 gained a significant cult following, effectively launching the career of director Suda51. Resident Evil 4 was the runaway success of the five, though its GameCube sales were undercut by the <b>announcement</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> Sony PlayStation 2 port to be released later in 2005. Viewtiful Joe also saw a PlayStation 2 version with expanded features, and Killer7 debuted on multiple platforms simultaneously. Since the release of the Nintendo 64, Nintendo has struggled to attract third-party developers like Capcom to produce games for its systems. Industry analysts see the Capcom Five case, particularly the loss of GameCube exclusivity for Resident Evil 4, as a major blow to Nintendo–Capcom relations and is emblematic of Nintendo's failure to attract third-party support during the GameCube era.|$|E

5|$|On 8 October, it was {{announced}} that postal workers had voted three to one in favour of taking strike action over job security and working conditions. It was later announced that a national strike would be held on Thursday 22 October and Friday 23 October. After further talks failed, more strikes were announced to take place on Thursday 29 October, Friday 30 October and Saturday 31 October. Discussions continued throughout the second wave of strikes with proposals being put to both sides, but these were overshadowed by the <b>announcement</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> third walkout on Friday 6 November and Monday 9 November. However, on 5 November it {{was announced}} that strikes had been called off until the New Year to allow time for fresh talks to take place. A resolution to the dispute was finally reached following lengthy discussions on 8 March 2010, and on 27 April it was reported that postal workers voted to accept the deal.|$|E
5|$|Smetana {{did not act}} {{immediately}} on this aspiration. The announcement that a Provisional Theatre was to be opened in Prague, as a home for Czech opera and drama pending {{the building of a}} permanent National Theatre, influenced his decision to return permanently to his homeland in 1861. He was then spurred to creative action by the <b>announcement</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> prize competition, sponsored by the Czech patriot Jan von Harrach, to provide suitable operas for the Provisional Theatre. By 1863 he had written The Brandenburgers in Bohemia to a libretto by the Czech nationalist poet Karel Sabina, whom Smetana had met briefly in 1848. The Brandenburgers, which was awarded the opera prize, was a serious historical drama, but even before its completion Smetana was noting down themes for use in a future comic opera. By this time he had heard the music of Cornelius's Der Barbier, and was ready to try his own hand at the comic genre.|$|E
5|$|The Australian Cricket Board {{announced}} their squad for the World Cup on 31 December 2002, but several {{changes were made}} to the team before the tournament was completed. In January 2003, Shane Watson was ruled out following a stress fracture and was replaced by Ian Harvey. A day before the tournament started, Australia's key spinner Shane Warne was found guilty of using a prohibited diuretic drug during an ODI series held in Australia before the World Cup. He was sent home after he tested positive, and banned from playing for one year. Later, Australia's fast bowler Jason Gillespie was ruled out from the tournament following a tendon injury. Warne and Gillespie were replaced by Nathan Hauritz (on 24 February 2003) and Nathan Bracken (on 5 March 2003), respectively. An ongoing dispute between the Board for Control of Cricket in India (BCCI) and the Indian players over product endorsements ensured a delay in the <b>announcement</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> provisional squad for the World Cup. The BCCI announced the final selection of 15 members on 31 December 2002. Sachin Tendulkar made into the final squad despite three ongoing injuries, including a major one on the ankle.|$|E

40|$|Purpose: The main {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to research whether <b>an</b> <b>announcement</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> acquisition generates positive/negative abnormal short-term return towards the buying company’s shareholders. The secondary purpose is to research whether any differences could be due to selected factors: firm size and industry. Method: The study is quantitative in nature where the research aims at the stock price movement around the <b>announcement</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> acquisition. The sample size includes 30 companies between the years 2000 - 2010. The abnormal return is investigated by an Event Study. Conclusion: Our study shows that the publication gives a positive abnormal return in comparison to the respective sector indexes. The result is statistically significant, so we can conclude that <b>an</b> <b>announcement</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> acquisition is a positive investment on average. We also found that our selected factors have a significant impact on price performance. Medium-sized industrial companies show positive abnormal returns while smaller IT companies shows a very low abnormal return and large finance companies fluctuates slightly more than other variables, but the value changes are minimal. We also found that the market does not work effectively because of the strange movements before and after the event date...|$|R
