40|$|A {{review of}} the {{electronic}} saturated carrier velocity effect is made and related to the application of this effect {{to the construction of}} a two terminal current limiting device in silicon material. A simple model of a current limiter device was made with the first evident problem of power dissipation solved through construction of devices having very high surface to volume ratios {{through the use of a}} small device structure. Devices were constructed based on the simple model. Testing of these devices resulted in unexplainable results with the performance being from fair to poor. An analytical explanation for the failure was found that consisted of a simple model of space charge injection. This model of space charge injection proved to be inadequate and was replaced by a computer model capable of solutions calculating the actual space charge distribution rather than being based on an assumed solution as the analytical model had been. A new set of test devices was constructed from improved materials and structures. The testing procedure was changed from steady state to pulse testing to reduce thermal effects. These devices performed as expected except for the avalanche failure which occurred at a lower level than expected. A {{review of the}} literature evoked one similar report of reduced <b>avalanche</b> <b>voltage</b> capability along with an accompanying analysis. The analysis was corrected for a mathematical error and an assumption of neglible space charge injection is shown to be in error by the computer analysis. The conclusion that the ionization rate must be higher at low fields than previously reported for n-type silicon is confirmed using the computer program. Although this dissertation resulted in much poorer current limiting devices than had originally been anticipated the understanding of the reasons for the failures aids future efforts by pointing out specific areas for improvement and providing a model as guidance for possible construction in other materials with better properties...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{concentrates}} on low voltage (∼ 1 kV) 4 H-SiC power DMOSFET design. The {{objective of the}} thesis is to achieve the smallest possible specific onresistance for 1 kV blocking voltage. 4 H-SiC is a wide bandgap (Eg = 3. 3 eV) semiconductor with high critical electric field, which makes it suitable for high voltage, high power applications. The main problem for the 4 H-SiC MOS devices is the low inversion channel mobility, which makes the channel resistance the most dominant component of the total on-resistance. The exceptionally low inversion channel mobility (∼ 20 cm 2 /V-s) is attributed to the high interface state densities near the conduction band edge and the surface roughening caused by high temperature implant annealing. As channel resistance is linearly proportional to both channel mobility and channel length, a self-aligned technology was used to reduce the channel length below 0. 5 μm. The fabricated device on 6 μm epilayer produced a specific on-resistance of 9. 95 mohm-cm 2 for an <b>avalanche</b> breakdown <b>voltage</b> of 900 V. The problem with these devices was the high gate oxide field (6 MV/cm), which implied a poor reliability. To overcome this problem {{as well as to}} reduce the specific on-resistance further, an exhaustive simulation study was done and an optimized DMOSFET structure was proposed. The new design includes a novel highly doped current spreading layer and a highly-doped JFET region to reduce the total on-resistance, and a JFET length of 1 μm was used to reduce the gate oxide field at the onset of avalanche breakdown. Moreover, an alignment tolerance of 0. 5 μm was used to reduce the cell pitch and thereby the specific on-resistance. Electron beam lithography was used to implement these short features. The fabricated device produced a specific on-resistance of 6. 95 mohm-cm 2 for a blocking voltage of 1050 V. The specific on-resistance of the fabricated devices was slightly higher than the simulated result (4. 0 mohm-cm 2) due to unexpectedly high contact resistivities. ...|$|R

One approach to address this need is to design and manufacture a novel complementary-metal–oxide–semiconductor (CMOS) compatible, cost-effective detector array and readout circuit (ROIC) that incorporates integrated waveguide detectors and avalanche photodiodes (APDs). This thesis focuses on the APD design and fabrication component of the sensing capability required by smart-lighting systems. Silicon CMOS compatible APDs are expected to provide high-speed and high-sensitivity sensors in terms of simplicity of design, low power consumption and cost-effectiveness for smart-lighting applications. To date, most of the CMOS-based APD devices have been dedicated to the Geiger mode, which aims to count individual photons under ultralow light conditions. This thesis reports on the modeling, design, fabrication,and characterization of CMOS compatible p-n junction Si APDs to be operated in the linear avalanche mode. The recursive dead-space multiplication theory (DSMT), {{is applied to the}} recently fabricated thin Si n+p APDs to predict the avalanche and breakdown properties including low excess noise factor. The low excess noise factor is due to the presence of dead space effect and the initiation of avalanche process by the photogenerated electron in the depletion region of Si APDs. The calculated mean gain, <b>avalanche</b> breakdown <b>voltage,</b> excess noise factor, electron and hole ionization coefficients, electric fields are reported. Moreover, measured dark current, photocurrent, mean gain, capacitance, spectral response, and breakdown voltages are also reported supporting low-voltage operation across the visible electromagnetic spectrum. A mean gain of ~ 50 has been obtained for the fabricated structure at a reverse bias breakdown voltage of ~ 8. 67 V. The type of APD developed in this thesis can be integrated with waveguide structures to provide enhanced sensitivity and high speed detection capability as well as uniformity across colors.
