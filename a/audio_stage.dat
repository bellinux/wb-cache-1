50|$|The {{frequency}} mixer {{was of the}} pentagrid converter design to save {{the cost of a}} separate oscillator tube. The detector and first <b>audio</b> <b>stage</b> were provided by a dual diode/triode combination tube. When the detector/first audio tube contained a second diode, it could be used to provide automatic gain control (AGC), or AGC bias could be derived from the audio detector diode.|$|E
5000|$|LF/MF/HF {{receivers}} all use {{an almost}} identical 6-tube superhet design: r.f. amplifier (12SK7), converter (12K8), two i.f. stages (two 12SK7's(4), or 12SK7/12SF7(5)), diode detector/BFO (12SR7), and one <b>audio</b> <b>stage</b> (12A6). Transmitters use four tubes: 1626 oscillator, two 1625 finals, and 1629 magic-eye tuning. The latter allows {{a check of}} the dial calibration by giving a visual indication, viewable by raising a small cover, when the oscillator's frequency matches that of an internal crystal.(4)ARA and SCR-274-N. [...] (5)AN/ARC-5.|$|E
50|$|In {{equipment}} that includes radio transmitters, motorboating {{can be caused}} by radio frequency interference (RFI), the strong radio signal from the transmitter getting into audio or receiver circuits. Receiver audio circuits with automatic gain control (AGC) have a long time constant feedback loop which adjusts the gain of the <b>audio</b> <b>stage</b> to compensate for differences in audio level from causes like different speaking voices. Squelch circuits used in two-way radios to cut out noise similarly have a feedback loop which turns off the audio when high frequency noise is detected.|$|E
50|$|For {{the tone}} decoder to work reliably, the audio input level {{must be in}} the linear range of <b>audio</b> <b>stages,</b> (undistorted). A 1,500 Hz tone fed into an {{amplifier}} that distorts the tone could produce a harmonic at 3,000 Hz, falsely triggering a decoder that is tuned to 3,000 Hz.|$|R
50|$|A CTCSS decoder {{is based}} on a very narrow {{bandpass}} filter which passes the desired CTCSS tone. The filter's output is amplified and rectified, creating a DC voltage whenever the desired tone is present. The DC voltage is used to turn on, enable or unmute the receiver's speaker <b>audio</b> <b>stages.</b> When the tone is present, the receiver is unmuted, when it is not present the receiver is silent.|$|R

50|$|During the 1960s, the PA {{speakers}} for the vocals and the band's amplification {{were all}} {{set in a}} line, which conceptually grouped PA and instrument amplification together. This changed over the 1970s and 1980s, as PA systems became powerful enough to amplify all of the band's instruments and the vocals. During this era, the backline gear was set behind the PA speakers to create the modern <b>audio</b> <b>stage</b> set-up. Modern monitoring techniques, in which monitor speakers pointing at the performers are placed on the stage, {{as well as the}} concepts of frontline and backline, developed during this era.|$|E
5000|$|Wood {{described}} some of {{the filming}} process to The Guardian: [...] "The whole film is primarily shown from the character's perspective, so 70% of the process involved working with the director of photography Maxime Alexandre. Maxime was effectively the character as well as me, {{and the rest of}} Frank had to be created locally through his inner monologue, which I recorded on an <b>audio</b> <b>stage</b> afterwards... We approached the point-of-view thing with a certain naivety. At first, we thought we'd use a body double. We quickly discovered that didn't work. So I was there the whole time, dancing around behind the camera, leaning forward to put my hand in the frame. Every sequence was a learning process." ...|$|E
5000|$|The sets used a four-valve {{superhet}} circuit with {{an audio}} output of 4 watts at 10% total harmonic distortion; they performed {{as well as}} many pre-war sets. The valve complement consisted of a triode-hexode frequency changer, a variable-μ RF pentode IF amplifier and a high slope output pentode. A [...] "Westector" [...] solid-state copper oxide diode was used for demodulation, which saved one valve and allowed use of an available type of pentode for the <b>audio</b> <b>stage.</b> The HT line was derived from a full wave rectifier. All valves were on International Octal sockets apart from the rectifier which was on a British 4-pin base. There were minor variations between set makers; for instance Philips used IF transformers with adjustable ferrite cores (so-called slug tuning) rather than the conventional trimmer capacitors.|$|E

2500|$|The {{desire to}} power {{electronic}} equipment using AC mains power faced a difficulty {{with respect to}} the powering of the tubes' filaments, as these were also the cathode of each tube. Powering the filaments directly from a power transformer introduced mains-frequency (50 or 60Hz) hum into <b>audio</b> <b>stages.</b> The invention of the [...] "equipotential cathode" [...] reduced this problem, with the filaments being powered by a balanced AC power transformer winding having a grounded center tap.|$|R

50|$|The {{next four}} years saw a rapid {{expansion}} of the business with over 16 new products being launched and with export markets re-established in over 28 countries across the world. The amplifier range - C75mkII preamplifier, P40, P55 integrated and A250 power amplifier - received excellent reviews.In 1985 a major innovative step was made with {{the launch of the}} CD1; the world’s first two box CD player (At the time this CD player was widely recognised as the best player available and its design featured many new ideas and a ground-breaking specification). Apart from putting the DAC stages into a separate case the transport was mounted on a lead beam suspension to reduce disc reading errors; a unique <b>audio</b> <b>stage</b> offered the choice of six alternative playback filters; and the digital to analogue conversion was performed by six matched DACs to give linearity down to -120 dB {{at a time when most}} players were only linear down to about -94 dB.|$|E
50|$|In {{low level}} {{modulation}} a small <b>audio</b> <b>stage</b> {{is used to}} modulate a low power stage. The output of this stage is then amplified using a linear RF amplifier. The great disadvantage of this system is that the amplifier chain is less efficient, because {{it has to be}} linear to preserve the modulation. Hence high efficiency class C amplifiers cannot be employed, unless a Doherty amplifier, EER (Envelope Elimination and Restoration) or other methods of predistortion or negative feedback are used. High level modulation uses class C amplifiers in a broadcast AM transmitter and only the final stage or final two stages are modulated, and all the earlier stages can be driven at a constant level. When modulation is applied to the plate of the final tube, a large audio amplifier is needed for the modulation stage, equal to 1/2 of the DC input power of the modulated stage. Traditionally the modulation is applied using a large audio transformer. However many different circuits have been used for high level AM modulation. See Amplitude Modulation.|$|E

50|$|Phase {{modulation}} is mathematically {{equivalent to}} direct Frequency modulation with a 6 dB/octave high-pass filter {{applied to the}} modulating signal. This high-pass effect can be exploited or compensated for using suitable frequency-shaping circuitry in the <b>audio</b> <b>stages</b> ahead of the modulator. For example, many FM systems will employ pre-emphasis and de-emphasis for noise reduction, {{in which case the}} high-pass equivalency of phase modulation automatically provides for the pre-emphasis. Phase modulators are typically only capable of relatively small amounts of deviation while remaining linear, but any frequency multiplier stages also multiply the deviation in proportion.|$|R

5000|$|Next, in 1973, the RP72 Sovereign III is {{released}} {{with very different}} styling compared to the previous models - featuring teak side panels and extruded aluminium for the loudspeaker grill and top control panel assemblies. Separate AM and FM tuners are retained, while the <b>audio</b> <b>stages</b> gain a new pre-amplifier that incorporates passive Baxendall tone controls. The loudspeaker is slightly smaller at 7 by 5 inches, and is now supplied by Peerless. The set is powered by eight 1.5 volt [...] "D-cells" [...] rather than two PP9s. Earlier models had a DC-input socket on the back; later models incorporate a mains power supply and are designated RP72MB. While {{the majority of these}} sets are restricted to 101 MHz on the FM band, later models were able to tune to 104 MHz. The ISM function was dropped, but switchable AFC remains. A common problem with these sets concerns the screen printing on the top panel, which can wear away.|$|R
50|$|The {{producer}} typically supervises {{the entire}} process from preproduction, through to the sound recording and mixing stages, and, in some cases, {{all the way to}} the <b>audio</b> mastering <b>stage.</b> The producer may perform these roles himself, or help select the engineer, and provide suggestions to the engineer. The producer may also pay session musicians and engineers and ensure that the entire project is completed within the record companies' budget.|$|R
50|$|Unwanted {{by-product}} beat {{signals from}} the mixing stage do not need any further processing, as they are completely rejected by use of a low-pass filter at the <b>audio</b> output <b>stage.</b> The receiver design has the additional advantage of high selectivity, and is therefore a precision demodulator. The design principles can be extended to permit separation of adjacent channel broadcast signals whose sidebands may overlap the wanted transmission. The design also improves the detection of pulse-modulated transmission mode signals.|$|R
5000|$|To {{augment the}} company's {{standalone}} phono preamplifiers, standalone line stage preamplifiers were introduced next, known as Linear Control Centers or LCC. One of the innovative {{features of the}} LCC was a bypass switch that permitted the user to select {{the use of an}} internal amplification module or straight into the potentiometer for volume control. Originally labeled 0dB (line stage in) or -20dB (passive only) this feature remained with all future PS <b>Audio</b> line <b>stages</b> and preamplifiers, later becoming labeled Straightwire in or out.|$|R
25|$|Following World War II, tubes {{intended}} {{to be used in}} series heater strings were redesigned to all have the same ("controlled") warm-up time. Earlier designs had quite-different thermal time constants. The <b>audio</b> output <b>stage,</b> for instance, had a larger cathode, and warmed up more slowly than lower-powered tubes. The result was that heaters that warmed up faster also temporarily had higher resistance, because of their positive temperature coefficient. This disproportionate resistance caused them to temporarily operate with heater voltages well above their ratings, and shortened their life.|$|R
50|$|The {{schematic}} diagram shows a typical TRF receiver. This particular example uses six triodes. It has two {{radio frequency amplifier}} stages, one grid-leak detector/amplifier and three class ‘A’ <b>audio</b> amplifier <b>stages.</b> There are 3 tuned circuits T1-C1, T2-C2, and T3-C3. The second and third tuning capacitors, C2 and C3, are ganged together (indicated by line linking them) and controlled by a single knob, to simplify tuning. Generally, two or three RF amplifiers were required to filter and amplify the received signal enough for good reception.|$|R
