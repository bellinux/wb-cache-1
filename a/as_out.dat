5|$|Chamberlain was {{not made}} a Privy Councillor. He also spurned advice from Lloyd George about his choice of advisors (apart from James Stevenson from the Ministry of Munitions who was briefly Deputy for Civil Recruiting), instead {{appointing}} cronies from Birmingham who were <b>as</b> <b>out</b> of their depth as he was. Chamberlain nearly resigned in June 1917 when, having not been told or consulted, he read in the newspapers {{that he had been}} given a new Parliamentary Secretary.|$|E
5|$|His final {{re-election}} campaign came in 1990 against businessman Harry Lonsdale. Lonsdale aggressively went after Hatfield with television attack ads that attacked Hatfield <b>as</b> <b>out</b> of touch {{on issues such}} as abortion and timber management and accused the incumbent of being too closely allied with special interest groups in Washington. Lonsdale's tactics moved him even with, and then ahead of Hatfield in some polls. Hatfield, who had typically stayed above the fray of negative campaigning, was forced to respond in kind with attack ads of his own. He raised $1million in a single month after trailing Lonsdale in the polls before the November election. He defeated the Democrat with 590,095 (53.7percent) votes to 507,743 (46.2percent) votes.|$|E
5|$|In 1649, Parliament ordered new {{supplies}} of ammunition and powder {{be sent to}} Walmer and the other castles of the Downs, which were brought back into good order. The garrison at Walmer remained substantial during the period, with a governor, a corporal and 20 soldiers, but when Charles II was restored to the throne in 1660 he reduced the numbers again to a captain, lieutenant, porter and 16 men. In the Glorious Revolution of 1688 against Charles' brother, King James II, the townsfolk of Deal seized Walmer Castle on behalf of William III, the Prince of Orange. By {{the end of the}} century, however, the castle was increasingly regarded <b>as</b> <b>out</b> of date from a military perspective.|$|E

5|$|A {{number of}} Welsh writers have {{drawn on the}} lives of the quarrymen for their material, for example the novels of T. Rowland Hughes. Chwalfa, {{translated}} into English <b>as</b> <b>Out</b> of their night (1954), has the Penrhyn Quarry dispute as a background, while Y cychwyn, translated as The beginning (1969), follows the apprenticeship of a young quarryman. Several novels by Kate Roberts, the daughter of a quarryman, give a picture of the area around Rhosgadfan, where the slate industry was on a smaller scale and many of the quarrymen were also smallholders. Her novel Traed mewn cyffion (1936), translated as Feet in chains (2002), gives a vivid picture of the struggles of a quarrying family in the period between 1880 and 1914. Y Chwarelwr ("The Quarryman") produced in 1935 was the first Welsh-language film. It showed various aspects of a slate quarryman's life at Blaenau Ffestiniog.|$|E
5|$|Homer {{does well}} in his first fights, mainly because he is {{competing}} against opponents almost <b>as</b> <b>out</b> of shape as he is. At every match, he follows Moe's advice and gains widespread attention, eventually becoming the top ranked fighter in the Springfield Hobo Boxing Association. Moe's former boxing manager Lucius Sweet visits Moe and announces that the current Heavyweight Champion Drederick Tatum is being released from prison and is ready for a comeback fight, and Sweet wants Tatum to fight Homer. Lucius hopes that due to Homer's fame as a human punching bag, he will at least be able to endure a few rounds. Moe, despite knowing that Tatum is far too strong for a fighter of Homer's ability, promises Sweet that Homer will last three rounds with Tatum.|$|E
