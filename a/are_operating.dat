5|$|In {{addition}} to pupil assessment, {{the law requires}} that schools implement some form of self-evaluation {{on the quality of}} their services {{and to make sure that}} institutions <b>are</b> <b>operating</b> inside the law and within guidelines.

5|$|Another reason exports {{cannot be}} {{promoted}} is because in all likelihood, an underdeveloped country {{may only be}} skilled enough to promote the export of primary goods, say agricultural goods. However, since such commodities face inelastic demand, {{the extent to which}} they will sell in the market is limited. Although when population is at a rise, additional demand for exports may be created, Nurkse implicitly assumed that developed countries <b>are</b> <b>operating</b> at the replacement rate of population growth. For Nurkse, then, exports as a means of economic development are completely ruled out.|$|E

5|$|As of 2010, major long-standing {{extraction}} industries <b>are</b> <b>operating</b> in Estonia, Brazil, and China. Its {{economic viability}} usually requires {{a lack of}} locally available crude oil. National energy security issues have {{also played a role}} in its development. Critics of shale oil extraction pose questions about environmental management issues, such as waste disposal, extensive water use, waste water management, and air pollution.|$|E

5|$|Plug-in {{cars have}} several {{benefits}} compared to conventional {{internal combustion engine}} vehicles. They have lower operating and maintenance costs, and produce little or no local air pollution. They reduce dependence on petroleum and may reduce greenhouse gas emissions from the onboard source of power, depending on the fuel and technology used for electricity generation to charge the batteries. Plug-in hybrids capture most of these benefits when they <b>are</b> <b>operating</b> in all-electric mode. Despite their potential benefits, market penetration of plug-in electric vehicles has been slower than expected as adoption faces several hurdles and limitations. The global market share of the light-duty plug-in vehicle segment achieved 0.86% of total new car sales in 2016, up from 0.62% in 2015 and 0.38% in 2014. However, the stock of plug-in electric cars represented just 0.15% of the 1.4 billion motor vehicles on the world's roads {{by the end of}} 2016.|$|E

5|$|When a stem is developing, {{the fungus}} is {{negatively}} geotropic, {{so that if}} the axis of the stem is tilted by 90 degrees, it will return to a vertical position within 24 hours. The extending hyphae that form the cap are themselves diageotropic—they will grow {{at right angles to}} the direction of gravity. Finally, the spines are positively geotropic, and will re-orient themselves to point downward if the mushroom orientation changes. Because the second (cap formation) and third (spine formation) geotropic responses overlap, there is a brief period where two different geotropic responses <b>are</b> <b>operating</b> simultaneously. These geotropic transitions help ensure that the final alignment results in optimum spore dispersal.|$|E
5|$|When making observations, {{scientists}} {{look through}} telescopes, study images on electronic screens, record meter readings, and so on. Generally, on a basic level, they {{can agree on}} what they see, e.g., the thermometer shows 37.9 degrees C. But, if these scientists have different ideas about the theories {{that have been developed}} to explain these basic observations, they may disagree about what they are observing. For example, before Albert Einstein's general theory of relativity, observers would have likely interpreted the image at left as five different objects in space. In light of that theory, however, astronomers will tell you that there are actually only two objects, one in the center and four different images of a second object around the sides. Alternatively, if other scientists suspect that something is wrong with the telescope and only one object is actually being observed, they <b>are</b> <b>operating</b> under yet another theory. Observations that cannot be separated from theoretical interpretation are said to be theory-laden.|$|E
5|$|The Port of Split is {{the largest}} {{passenger}} port in Croatia and the third largest passenger seaport in the Mediterranean. The port {{is administered by the}} Port of Split Authority, and the primary concessionaires Trajektna Luka Split and Luka d.d.
