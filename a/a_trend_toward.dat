5|$|There is <b>a</b> <b>trend</b> <b>toward</b> {{increasing}} half-lives for {{the heavier}} isotopes; thus the heaviest three known isotopes, 267Sg, 269Sg, and 271Sg, {{are also the}} longest-lived, having half-lives in minutes. Some other isotopes in this region are predicted to have comparable or even longer half-lives, with the longest-lived predicted isotope being 272Sg {{which is expected to}} have a half-life of about an hour. Additionally, 263Sg, 265Sg, 265mSg, as well as the predicted 268Sg have or should have half-lives measured in seconds. All the remaining isotopes have half-lives measured in milliseconds, {{with the exception of the}} shortest-lived isotope, 261mSg, with a half-life of only 92microseconds.|$|E
5|$|March 2009 {{recommendations}} from the USPSTF {{on the use}} of aspirin for the primary prevention of coronary heart disease encourage men aged 45–79 and women aged 55–79 to use aspirin when the potential benefit of a reduction in MI for men or stroke for women outweighs the potential harm of an increase in gastrointestinal hemorrhage. The WHI study said regular low dose (75 or 81mg) aspirin female users had a 25% lower risk of death from cardiovascular disease and a 14% lower risk of death from any cause. Low-dose aspirin use was also associated with <b>a</b> <b>trend</b> <b>toward</b> lower risk of cardiovascular events, and lower aspirin doses (75 or 81mg/day) may optimize efficacy and safety for people requiring aspirin for long-term prevention.|$|E
5|$|Within the Heathen {{community}} of the United States, gender roles are based upon perceived ideals and norms found in Early Medieval Northwestern Europe, in particular as they are presented in Old Norse sources. Among male American Heathens there is <b>a</b> <b>trend</b> <b>toward</b> hypermasculinized behaviour, while a gendered division of labor—in which men are viewed as providers and women seen as being responsible for home and children—is also widespread among Heathens in the U.S. Due to its focus on traditional attitudes to sex and gender—values perceived as socially conservative in Western nations—it {{has been argued that}} American Heathenry's ethical system is far closer to traditional Christian morals than the ethical systems espoused in many other Western Pagan religions such as Wicca.|$|E

5|$|Armour {{has been}} {{employed}} in battles in Japan since the Yayoi period. Some {{of the oldest}} extant items from the 4th to the 7th centuries were excavated from kofun and have been designated as archaeological National Treasures. These ancient armours were of two types: a tight fitting solid plate cuirass (tankō) and a skirted lamellar type (keikō), both believed {{to be based on}} Chinese or Korean prototypes. This list includes more recent pieces of armour, developed as result of <b>a</b> <b>trend</b> <b>toward</b> (lamellar) scale armour that began in Japan in the 6th to the 7th centuries and matured in the mid-Heian period (9th to 10th centuries). Combining materials such as leather and silk with iron or steel parts, these armours had the advantage of being light, flexible, foldable and shock absorbent. They were generally lacquered to protect them from the humid climate and were used widely from the late Heian period to the mid-14th century. A complete set consisted of a helmet, mask, neck guard, throat protector, breastplate with shoulder guards, sleeve armour, skirt, greaves, shoes and a pennant attached to the back.|$|E
5|$|Despite these {{barriers}} to access, health services have shown <b>a</b> <b>trend</b> <b>toward</b> {{improvement over the}} past twenty years. Child immunizations against such diseases as hepatitis B, diphtheria and measles increased an average of 60percent in this period, indicating low but increasing availability of basic medical services and treatments. The Malagasy fertility rate in 2009 was 4.6children per woman, declining from 6.3 in 1990. Teen pregnancy rates of 14.8percent in 2011, much higher than the African average, are a contributing factor to rapid population growth. In 2010 the maternal mortality rate was 440 per 100,000 births, compared to 373.1 in 2008 and 484.4 in 1990, indicating a decline in perinatal care following the 2009 coup. The infant mortality rate in 2011 was 41 per 1,000 births, with an under-five mortality rate at 61 per 1,000 births. Schistosomiasis, malaria and sexually transmitted diseases are common in Madagascar, although infection rates of AIDS remain low relative to many countries in mainland Africa, at only 0.2percent of the adult population. The malaria mortality rate is also among the lowest in Africa at 8.5 deaths per 100,000people, in part due to the highest frequency use of insecticide treated nets in Africa. Adult life expectancy in 2009 was 63 years for men and 67years for women.|$|E

Their findings gave preliminary support to the efficacy of music therapy as a complementary therapy for social functioning and participation in rehabilitation with <b>a</b> <b>trend</b> <b>toward</b> improvement in mood during acute rehabilitation.|$|E
25|$|The Jemdet Nasr tablets {{are written}} in proto-cuneiform script. Proto-cuneiform {{is thought to have}} arisen {{in the second half of}} the 4th {{millennium}} BC.

25|$|The royal {{inscriptions}} from Lagash also mention wars {{against other}} Lower Mesopotamian city-states, {{as well as}} against kingdoms farther away. Examples of the latter include Mari, Subartu, and Elam. These conflicts show that already in this stage in history there was <b>a</b> <b>trend</b> <b>toward</b> stronger states dominating larger territories. For example, king Eannatum of Lagash was able to defeat Mari and Elam around 2450 BC. Enshakushanna of Uruk seized Kish and imprisoned its king Embi-Ishtar around 2430. Lugal-zage-si, king of Uruk and Umma, was able to seize most of Lower Mesopotamia around 2450.

25|$|The Cuban state {{claims to}} adhere to socialist {{principles}} in organizing its largely state-controlled planned economy.

Government spending is 78.1% of GDP. Any firm wishing to hire a Cuban must pay the Cuban government, which in turn will pay the employee in Cuban pesos. The average monthly wage as of July 2013 is 466 Cuban pesos, which are worth about US$19.|$|E
25|$|Minor {{improvements}} to Woodland Cemetery {{were made in}} {{the last decade of the}} 19th century. In 1888, a small wooden, enclosed pavilion was erected on the ground to provide employees with a place to eat and store tools. A fence was erected around the cemetery's stoneyard to screen it from view, a stone path was built from the Woodland Avenue gatehouse to the chapel, and all walks were cindered. The central water main was replaced, and a public drinking fountain added near the chapel. The chapel's receiving vault was updated to accommodate <b>a</b> <b>trend</b> <b>toward</b> larger caskets, box gutters were installed throughout the cemetery to replace ditch gutters, and the two gatekeeper's houses and the foreman's house were both repaired and refurbished. In 1889, the chapel was connected to the water main for the first time. Due to limited burial space, two grassy areas around the chapel were converted into burial plots.|$|E

The group differences in the post-exercise HRV values remained after controlling for BMI and VO 2 max, showing the independent effect of the SF groups. These findings suggest a faster post-exercise return of HRV in the leaner group of men. Thus, the first hypothesis of the study was supported.|$|R
