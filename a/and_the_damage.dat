High unemployment caused some of the population to move away as the riverside industries closed down in the late 1960s and early 1970s. The local council have developed plans with private companies to regenerate the riverside area, and the town centre.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Hazel was {{the deadliest}} and costliest {{hurricane}} of the 1954 Atlantic hurricane season. The storm {{killed at least}} 400people in Haiti before striking the United States near the border between North and South Carolina, as a Category 4 hurricane. After causing 95fatalities in the US, Hazel struck Canada as an extratropical storm, raising the death toll by 81people, mostly in Toronto. As {{a result of the}} high death toll <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>damage</b> caused by Hazel, its name was retired from use for North Atlantic hurricanes.|$|E
5|$|In 1913, the Jockey Club and {{the owners}} of the General Stud Book passed a {{regulation}} named by the foreign press after the Jockey Club's senior steward, Lord Jersey, prohibiting the registration of horses in the book unless all of their ancestors had been registered. Despite protests from American breeders, the regulation remained in force until 1949. Among the factors influencing its relaxation were the racing success of ineligible horses in Europe <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>damage</b> caused to British and Irish breeders by the unavailability of French Thoroughbreds during and after the Second World War. In addition, by 1949 the possibly impure ancestors of the American bloodlines had receded far back in most horses' ancestry.|$|E

5|$|On September 2, 1901, the farm's dairy {{buildings}} {{were destroyed by}} fire. The cause of the fire (which was discovered in the dairy building's tower) was unknown, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>damage</b> was covered by insurance. Law quickly arranged for a temporary dairy in a room of the electric plant which had a boiler for sterilization; by the afternoon, milk was processed as usual. A larger dairy building was planned closer to the railroad station for faster shipping.|$|E
5|$|The {{building}} {{underwent a}} series of repairs and redecoration, {{carried out by the}} Steel Coleman Davis Partnership in the early 21st century.

5|$|The loss of Blücher <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>damage</b> done to Lützow {{caused the}} German force to withdraw.

Airborne troops captured the Fornebu Airport and completed the encirclement of the city, and by 14:00 on 10 April it was in German hands. The delay caused by the temporary withdrawal of Blüchers task force, however, allowed the Norwegian government and royal family to escape the city.|$|E

5|$|The precise {{mechanisms}} of bubble formation <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>damage</b> they cause {{has been the}} subject of medical research for a considerable time and several hypotheses have been advanced and tested. Tables and algorithms for predicting the outcome of decompression schedules for specified hyperbaric exposures have been proposed, tested, and used, and usually found to be of some use but not entirely reliable. Decompression remains a procedure with some risk, but this has been reduced and is generally considered acceptable for dives within the well-tested range of commercial, military and recreational diving.|$|E
5|$|To defeat more {{powerful}} monsters and gain experience points efficiently, players can join a party. A regular party {{has room for}} six members. Like in many other games, a well-balanced party will consist of several archetypes- namely a healer, a tank (the party member with high defense {{that will be the}} main target of the monster), <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>damage</b> dealer. The enmity system comes into play heavily in parties, as players try to keep the monsters attention off fragile jobs and on the tanks. A well-balanced team working together {{is the only way to}} defeat many of the game's enemies.|$|E
5|$|At 09:24 on {{the morning}} of 1 June, Howe sent his ships into action using the {{original}} tactic of turning each ship in his line northwest simultaneously, so that they would bear down individually on Villaret's fleet and each break the enemy line separately. His intention was to cut the French line in 25 places, raking the enemy vessels at both bow and stern and dividing their fire so they could be defeated piecemeal. Ultimately though this ambitious plan failed, due to ill-discipline among Howe's subordinates <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>damage</b> his fleet had sustained over the previous week. While six of Howe's ships did break the French line as ordered, and several others came close, many of his captains failed to follow orders and instead engaged the enemy from a distance in desultory gun duels which had little effect.|$|E

5|$|Due to the {{destruction}} wrought by Typhoon Durian just weeks prior, preparations began in earnest in the Philippines. Over 91,000people were evacuated from areas at risk, primarily from Albay. Two major summits {{to be held in}} Cebu were postponed {{as a result of the}} forecast inclement weather. In addition, recovery efforts for victims of Durian had to be suspended and all domestic flights in the Philippines were cancelled. Utor's impacts in the central Philippines were extensive, with 30casualties reported <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>damage</b> toll reaching US$15.8million. Widespread power outages affected the entirety of Eastern Visayas. Numerous ships sunk as a result of rough seas generated by the typhoon, including a ferry carrying 104passengers and crew. Following the storm, relief agencies began to allocate resources to those affected by the typhoon, in turn also adding to relief efforts for the three Philippine typhoons which preceded Utor. Precautionary efforts also took place in Vietnam, Thailand, and Malaysia, while the Paracel Islands sustained marked damage but no fatalities. Although the storm mostly dissipated in the South China Sea, Utor's remnant moisture later contributed in part to Peninsular Malaysia's worst flood event in recorded history, as copious amounts of precipitation fell over a short, four-day period. Eight people were killed by the floods which were worst in Kota Tinggi and Segamat District.|$|E
5|$|During {{the early}} part of October, the British troops with their {{supplies}} and artillery made their way with difficulty up the road to prepare for the siege. When they were all in place the First Bombardment took place, starting on October 17. It had been expected that the bombardment would be effective and that the siege would be short-lived; certainly over before the winter. However, the Russians blew up one of the French magazines <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>damage</b> done by British gunfire was soon repaired. The British were running out of ammunition and supplies, winter was approaching and with the onset of bad weather the road became virtually impassable. Supplies were arriving at the crowded port of Balaclava but it was impossible to convey them to the besieging troops who were increasingly suffering from disease, frostbite and malnutrition. Conditions in Balaclava itself were also deteriorating.|$|E
5|$|Furious {{joined the}} Home Fleet {{off the coast}} of Norway on 10 April 1940 and her Swordfish made several attacks on German ships in Narvik on the {{following}} days. She refuelled at Tromsø on the 14th and remained behind after the bulk of the Home Fleet departed on 15 April, her aircraft flying reconnaissance missions until ordered home on 25 April. Her port inner turbine had been damaged by the shock wave from a near miss on 18 April, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>damage</b> was more serious than initially thought. After quick repairs, Furious returned on 18 May carrying the Gladiators of a reformed 263 Squadron; they were flown off on 21 May once their base at Bardufoss was ready. She sailed to Scapa Flow once all the Gladiators had been flown off.|$|E

50|$|Claimants {{are also}} {{expected}} to take reasonable measures to mitigate the loss.

5|$|Hurricane Odile was {{the second}} of three {{tropical}} storms to make landfall in Mexico during the 1984 Pacific hurricane season. The fifteenth named storm and twelfth hurricane of the active season, it developed from a tropical disturbance about 185miles (300km) south of Acapulco on September17. Curving towards the northwest, Odile became a Category1 hurricane on September19. The tropical cyclone reached its peak intensity with winds of 105mph (165km/h) two days later; however, Hurricane Odile began to weaken as moved erratically it encountered less favorable conditions and was downgraded to a tropical storm shortly before making landfall northwest of Zihuatanejo. Over land, the storm rapidly weakened, and dissipated on September23. The storm caused significant rainfall accumulations of 24.73inches (628.1mm) in Southern Mexico, resulting in severe damage to tourism resorts. Flooding from Odile resulted in the evacuation of 7,000people, 21 deaths, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>damage</b> of about 900homes.|$|E
5|$|In 1890 the Prison Commissioners {{agreed to}} declare Clifford's Tower a {{national}} monument and to conserve it as a historic location. In 1902 Clifford's Tower {{was given to}} the York Corporation, together with a grant of £3,000 (£242,000 at 2009 prices) arranged by Lord Wenlock for conservation and repairs. The removal of the talus <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>damage</b> to the castle stonework in the 16th century had put excessive pressure on the supporting motte, causing a recurrence of the 14th century subsidence. Sir Basil Mott, a leading Victorian engineer, installed concrete underpinnings to stabilise the structure beneath the gatehouse. By the early 20th century, Clifford's Tower was regularly open to visitors, and in 1915 it was passed to the Office of Works as a national monument.|$|E
5|$|In each level, {{the player}} must {{complete}} certain objectives and then exit the stage. The requirements are varied, with many levels requiring the recovery {{and use of}} numerous high-tech gadgets. If Joanna is killed or fails an objective, the player must start the level again. Three distinct difficulty settings are available for each level, the choice of which will affect aspects such {{as the number of}} objectives that must be completed, enemy accuracy and damage, the effectiveness of the game's optional aiming assistance, and the availability of ammunition and protective shields. If all the levels are completed on the highest difficulty, an additional setting becomes available, allowing players to customise various aspects of enemies, such as their health, their aiming accuracy <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>damage</b> they inflict. In addition to the main campaign, there are four bonus missions, with three enabling the player to control other characters with unique special abilities. Players can also unlock cheats by completing the levels within certain time limits.|$|E
