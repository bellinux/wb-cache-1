40|$|The paper {{reflects}} on three {{approaches to the}} dissemination and display of digital art. “s[edition]” is a novel, web-based service that offers limited editions <b>of</b> “digital prints”. <b>Analysis</b> <b>of</b> user <b>comments</b> suggests that the metaphor of a “limited digital edition” raises issues {{and to some extent}} is resisted. The second approach is the Flickr Brushes Gallery, where digital painters post images and comment on one another’s work. <b>Analysis</b> <b>of</b> <b>comment</b> boards indicates that the shared art and comments are a form of gift exchange. Finally, the paper discusses a field study in which artists exhibited their work as it develops over time in digital frames and also in an immersive digital projection room. <b>Analysis</b> <b>of</b> field notes and interviews indicate that the digital frame approach was unsuccessful because of aesthetic and environmental concerns. The immersive projection suggested that more experiential approaches may be more interesting. It is argued that there is an inherent resistance in digital media to previous models of art commoditization.

40|$|Purpose: To study {{political}} {{aspects of}} accounting standard setting. Originality: This {{aspect of the}} global financial crisis has not been addressed by the literature before. Key literature/theoretical perspective: Critical perspectives on accounting. Design/methodology/approach: Historical narrative. Findings: The thesis papers focus {{on the history of}} mark-to-market accounting during the global financial crisis from 2008 to 2010. Banks claimed that mark-to-market had caused or exacerbated the crisis. Those opposed to the banks (accounting professionals, standard setters, advocacy groups) claimed that mark-to-market gave appropriate valuations of financial businesses that had mismanaged their own investment risks. Despite these defenses, in October 2008 and April 2009 mark-to-market was severely downgraded by standard setters in the US and the International Accounting Standards Board. This expo presentation focuses on a content <b>analysis</b> <b>of</b> <b>comment</b> letters concerning mark-to-market that were sent to the US Securities and Exchange Commission during the crisis.

40|$|This paper {{reports on}} the results of a {{questionnaire}} study of pricing decisions made by professional actuaries when the probabilities of a loss are either ambiguous or nonambiguous. Theoretical hypotheses derived from the expected utility model were compared with the implications of procedures described by practicing actuaries.

The suggested prices were considerably higher when probabilities were ambiguous than when they were well-specified. These pricing decisions were consistent with the procedures described by actuaries but inconsistent with predictions from expected utility theory when the risks are perfectly correlated.
