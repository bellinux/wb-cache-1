5|$|In January 1855, Brontë {{discovered}} she was pregnant. It {{was accompanied by}} severe illness and she died on 31 March 1855, officially from tuberculosis. Mr. Nicholls remained with Brontë's father for a further six years before returning to Banagher in 1861, taking with him his wife's portrait, her wedding dress (of which a copy has been made), some of Charlotte's letters and other mementoes. Forty years later, when the critic Clement Shorter prepared to write Charlotte Brontë and Her Circle, he found at Banagher among other relics, two diaries of Emily and Anne, in a tin box, and some of Charlotte's minute childhood writings wrapped in newspaper {{at the bottom of}} <b>a</b> <b>drawer.</b>|$|E

Billman would later cooperate with Torgny Segerstedt's daughter the journalist and politician Ingrid Segerstedt Wiberg, {{which resulted in a}} buon fresco and a book etc.|$|E

25|$|On {{the morning}} of June 12, 1994 (3 Tammuz 5754), Schneerson died at the Beth Israel Medical Center and was buried at the Ohel next to his father-in-law, Rabbi Yosef Yitzchak Schneersohn, at Montefiore Cemetery in Queens, New York. Shortly after Schneerson's death, the executors of his will {{discovered}} several notebooks in <b>a</b> <b>drawer</b> in his office, in which Schneerson had written his scholarly thoughts and religious musings from his earliest years. The majority of entries in these journals date between the years 1928 and 1950 and were subsequently published.|$|E
25|$|This {{novel is}} notable for its overt use of coincidence, such as Mrs Oliver {{going into a}} café that happens to contain the girl she is seeking, and having a key piece of {{evidence}} literally fall into her hands from <b>a</b> <b>drawer</b> as furniture is being removed from a dead woman's flat. This very obvious use of coincidence is known as open authorial manipulation and {{is often used to}} draw the reader's attention to the artificiality of the plot. It is highly appropriate to a detective novel in which a central character writes detective fiction and is an example of metafiction.|$|E
25|$|As {{had been}} the case with both Howlett and Allen, Sinclair's body was {{subsequently}} dissected, with the various dismembered parts wrapped in plastic bags and stored in either a wardrobe, a tea chest or within <b>a</b> <b>drawer</b> located beneath the bathtub. The bags used to seal Sinclair's remains would be sealed with the same crepe bandages Nilsen had found upon Sinclair's wrists. Nilsen attempted to dispose of the flesh, internal organs and smaller bones of all three victims killed at Cranley Gardens by flushing their dissected remains down his toilet. In a practice which he had conducted upon several victims killed at Melrose Avenue, he also boiled the heads, hands and feet to remove the flesh off these sections of the victims' bodies.|$|E

25|$|Judge Crater met Stella Mance Wheeler in 1917 when {{he served}} as her divorce lawyer, and they married seven days after her divorce was finalized. Mrs. Crater {{remained}} at their vacation home in Belgrade Lakes, Maine during the search for her husband, until January 20, 1931, when she allegedly discovered checks, stocks, bonds, and a note written by the judge in <b>a</b> <b>drawer</b> that had been empty when police checked earlier. Without Crater's income, Mrs. Crater was unable to maintain the couple's fashionable Fifth Avenue apartment and was evicted. She petitioned to have the judge declared officially dead in July 1937; she was reportedly living on the $12 per week (approximately $ in 2013 funds) that she earned as a telephone operator in Belgrade Lakes.|$|E
25|$|The Flemish school, in {{particular}} the Ruckers family, produced a special type of virginals known as Mother and Child (moeder und kind). This consisted of two instruments in one: a normal virginals (either spinet or muselar) with one (say) 6′ register, and an ottavino with one 3′ register. The smaller ottavino was stored (rather like <b>a</b> <b>drawer)</b> under the soundboard next to the keyboard of the larger instrument, and could be withdrawn and played as a separate keyboard instrument. However, the two instruments could also be coupled together, the ottavino being placed over the strings of the larger virginals (once the jackrail was removed), so that the jacks of the latter passed through a slot {{in the bottom of}} the ottavino. The jacks of the larger instrument now activated the keys of the ottavino, so that both instruments sounded simultaneously, giving a more brilliant effect.|$|E
25|$|Walker {{invited the}} author of the OLC memo, John Yoo, to meet with the senior DOD lawyers, both uniformed and {{civilian}} at the Pentagon, which Yoo did twice, explaining the cases in detail and the President's authority and responding to all questions. Mora met with Yoo, who defended the Justice Department's legal analysis, and told Mora the President had the authority to order the application of torture, not that he should but that the Commander in Chief had the authority to do so {{for the safety of the}} nation. Mora then met with Haynes, and advised him of his opinion that the Working Group's legal analysis, taken from the Department of Justice legal memorandum, was flawed, and should be put in <b>a</b> <b>drawer</b> and “never... see the light of day again.” The Working Group never relied upon the extreme power of the Commander in Chief as the additional techniques they recommended did not approach what could be construed as torture. The Working Group voted unanimously to send forth the recommended techniques to Secretary Rumsfeld, who adopted the majority of them. The Administration later asked the Justice Department to review the adopted techniques, which they did, finding them consistent with law. John Yoo did not participate in the later analysis.|$|E

500|$|The plot {{had become}} too familiar, as film {{historian}} Douglas Brode notes, and it [...] "seemed likely the play would be put away in <b>a</b> <b>drawer</b> [...]" [...] Yet Elliott Nugent's film, The Cat and the Canary (1939), proved successful. Nugent [...] "had the inspired idea to openly play the piece for laughs." [...] The film was produced by Paramount and starred comedic actor Bob Hope. Hope played Wally Campbell, a character based on Creighton Hale's performance as Paul Jones. One critic suggests that Hope developed the character better than Hale and was funnier and more engaging. In later years, Universal themselves acquired {{the rights to the}} 1939 version.|$|E

Saria said that the screenplay was written out of [...] "deep shame and fear", and on completion was not pitched to any investors, but instead put away into <b>a</b> <b>drawer.</b> The script {{was picked up by}} Suckale and Lamba; the duo agreed to coproduce Saria's directorial debut under the working title of Loev, a take on the word [...] "love" [...] itself.

500|$|The {{result of}} the {{challenge}} was the Automaton Chess-player, known in modern times as the Turk. The machine consisted of a life-sized model of a human head and torso, with a black beard and grey eyes, and dressed in Ottoman robes and a turban – [...] "the traditional costume", according to journalist and author Tom Standage, [...] "of an oriental sorcerer". Its left arm held a long Ottoman smoking pipe while at rest, while its right lay {{on the top of}} a large cabinet that measured about three-and-a-half feet (110cm) long, two feet (60cm) wide, and two-and-a-half feet (75cm) high. Placed on the top of the cabinet was a chessboard, which measured eighteen inches square. The front of the cabinet consisted of three doors, an opening, and <b>a</b> <b>drawer,</b> which could be opened to reveal a red and white ivory chess set.|$|E
