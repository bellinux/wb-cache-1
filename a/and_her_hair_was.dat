25|$|Once Henry had {{withdrawn}} with {{the bulk of}} the imperial army the towns that had supposedly fallen to the Empire immediately declared their allegiance to Tancred, for the most part now fearing his retribution. Nicholas of Ajello, son of Matthew and former Archbishop of Salerno, who was helping defend Naples, wrote letters about the events to his friends in Salerno. Thus the populace of Salerno saw an opportunity to win some favour with Tancred, so they besieged the defenseless Constance at Castel Terracena. Constance presented herself on a balcony and spoke to them in the tone of mild remonstrance and admonition, trying to tell them that the situation might improve and the defeat of Henry might be exaggerated by Nicholas, but the Salernitans were determined to capture her for Tancred, so they continued the siege. Constance locked herself in her room, locked the windows, and prayed to God for help and revenge. After a rapid negotiation with Elia di Gesualdo, a distant relative of Tancred, Constance voluntarily went out under the condition that her German garrison were to be allowed to leave unharmed. She was then arrested by Elia (and some barons of Apulia who were related to her) and delivered to Tancred in Messina by Admiral Margaritus of Brindisi (her brother-in-law who had helped in the defence of Naples), on a bireme galley or dromon with 200 rowers. She was in her attire as empress, wearing a dress quilted with gold and decorated with roses, a cloak covered with precious jewels, <b>and</b> <b>her</b> <b>hair</b> <b>was</b> strewn with gems, making her look like a goddess. Thus she became an important and valuable prize given that Henry had every intention of returning. When meeting Constance Tancred blamed her for the invasion, but she proudly responded that she was just taking back her dominion robbed by Tancred.|$|E
500|$|According to Kline, Yeats {{compared}} Olivia to Diana and Maud to Helen; he {{was attracted}} to dark coloured women, describing Olivia's skin as [...] "a little darker than a Greek's would have been <b>and</b> <b>her</b> <b>hair</b> <b>was</b> very dark". Literary scholar Humphrey Carpenter writes that Yeats' impression of Olivia {{was one of a}} woman with [...] "a profound culture, a knowledge of French, English, and Italian and seemed always at leisure. Her nature was gentle and contemplative, and she was content, it seems, to have no more of life than leisure and the talk of her friends".|$|E
500|$|Harrison {{confessed that}} it was not easy for him {{to come up with the}} lyrics to [...] "Crazy in Love" [...] in that length of time. But two hours later, he had written the verses, and the hook, in spite of being hung over. Harrison had also made {{provision}} for a backing track; he played all the instruments on the track. The bridge was written by Beyoncé, who was inspired by looking at herself in the mirror; as she was not wearing matching clothes <b>and</b> <b>her</b> <b>hair</b> <b>was</b> untidy, she kept saying, [...] "I'm looking so crazy right now." [...] Harrison sang back to her and said, [...] "That's the hook." [...] It also inspired the title of the song. After that Beyoncé had filled up the middle eight, she came up with the catchphrase – [...] "Uh-oh, uh-oh, you know" [...] – alongside Harrison.|$|E

500|$|While at Fox, her roles {{had been}} that of a [...] "girl next door"; at Columbia, she was modeled after Rita Hayworth. Monroe's {{hairline}} was raised by electrolysis <b>and</b> <b>her</b> <b>hair</b> <b>was</b> bleached even lighter, to platinum blonde. She also began working with the studio's head drama coach, Natasha Lytess, who would remain her mentor until 1955. Her only film at the studio was the low-budget musical Ladies of the Chorus (1948), {{in which she had}} her first starring role as a chorus girl who is courted by a wealthy man. During the production, she began an affair with her vocal coach, Fred Karger, who paid to have her slight overbite corrected. Despite the starring role and a subsequent screen test for the lead role in Born Yesterday (1950), Monroe's contract was not renewed. Ladies of the Chorus was released in October and was not a success.|$|E
500|$|... "One Son" [...] {{would be}} the last episode of the series to feature Owens' character, Jeffrey Spender, until the ninth season entry [...] "William". Owens first learned that he would be killed off when Carter called him and told him, [...] "You're going to go out a hero, of sorts". Owens was {{slightly}} disappointed, noting that he had just been introduced in the series during the conclusion of the previous season. Davis was upset that Owens was leaving the series, and reportedly told Owens during their last scene together, [...] "I don't want to shoot you! I enjoy working with you!" [...] Owens, however, jokingly noted that Davis had no problems slapping him when the script called for it. In the episode, Laurie Holden, who played Marita Covarrubias, returns. Spotnitz crafted the sequence in which she confronts Mulder to be a way of [...] "taking away [...] beauty and making her [...] as horrifying as possible". To accomplish this, she was given [...] "terrible-looking" [...] contact lenses <b>and</b> <b>her</b> <b>hair</b> <b>was</b> unkempt.|$|E
2500|$|She {{had been}} buried over 2,400 {{years ago in a}} casket {{fashioned}} from the hollowed-out trunk of a Siberian larch tree. On the outside of the casket were stylized images of deer and snow leopards carved in leather. Shortly after burial the grave had apparently been flooded by freezing rain, and the entire contents of the burial chamber had remained frozen in permafrost. Six horses wearing elaborate harnesses had been sacrificed and lay {{to the north of the}} chamber. The maiden's well-preserved body, carefully embalmed with peat and bark, was arranged to lie on her side as if asleep. She was young, <b>and</b> <b>her</b> <b>hair</b> <b>was</b> shaven off but wearing a wig and tall hat; she had been 167 cm (5 feet 6inches) tall. Even the animal style tattoos were preserved on her pale skin: creatures with horns that develop into flowered forms. Her coffin was made large enough to accommodate the high felt headdress she was wearing, which was decorated with swans and gold-covered carved cats. She was clad in a long crimson and white striped woolen skirt and white felt stockings. Her yellow blouse was originally thought to be made of wild [...] "tussah" [...] silk but closer examination of the fibers indicate the material is not Chinese but was a wild silk which came from somewhere else, perhaps India. Near her coffin was a vessel made of yak horn, and dishes containing gifts of coriander seeds: [...] all of which suggest that the Pazyryk trade routes stretched across vast areas of Iran. Similar dishes in other tombs were thought to have held Cannabis sativa, [...] confirming a practice described by Herodotus but after tests the mixture was found to be coriander seeds, probably used to disguise the smell of the body.|$|E

2500|$|The {{body of a}} {{woman who}} had died by {{suffocation}} was found in a white Admiral refrigerator in Gray, Knox County, Kentucky on April 1, 1985, alongside Route 25. The refrigerator had a decal of the words [...] "Super Woman" [...] on the front. The victim had been dead for a few days, and was nude except for two distinctive necklace pendants, one of a heart and the other of a gold-colored eagle, and two pairs of socks; one white, and the other white with green and yellow stripes. There were reports that the victim may have been soliciting a ride to North Carolina over CB radio. Five hundred people attended her funeral, which was also televised. The case was a local sensation in Gray, as the town was a [...] "quiet" [...] and [...] "sleepy" [...] place where little out of the ordinary usually happened. Distinguishing features of the body included a number of moles (on the right side of her neck, near one ankle, and below each breast), a yellow-stained upper incisor, and a scar and other marks on her abdomen, indicating that she had borne a child. Her eyes were [...] light brown <b>and</b> <b>her</b> <b>hair</b> <b>was</b> red and nearly a foot long, which fit the pattern of the redhead killer. After her autopsy, she was determined to be between 24 and 35 years old and [...] approximately 4 feet 9 to 4 feet 11 inches tall. [...] It is also possible that she owned a pair of boots found near the refrigerator. Several missing persons have been eliminated as possible matches for the victim. After the case was publicized in January 2013, the police received some tips, but it is unknown if they became solid leads.|$|E
