40|$|AbstractThe growing {{prevalence}} of emotional difficulties among adolescents represents an important public health issue for several countries, {{especially those with}} relatively young population such as Kosovo. The main research question {{of the present study}} is whether self-esteem and hopelessness are significant predictors of emotional difficulties among adolescents in Kosovo. The {{purpose of the study was}} to investigate the level of emotional difficulties among adolescents in Kosovo and determine whether self-esteem and hopelessness serve as significant predictors of these difficulties. Participants were 1162 adolescents aged between 11 and 20 years old (M= 16. 37; SD= 1. 58); in terms of gender composition, there were girls 593 (51 %), boys 535 (46 %). The measures used included the <b>Albanian</b> <b>versions</b> of The Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (Goodman, 1997), Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale (Rosenberg, 1965) and the Hopelessness scale for children (Kazdin et al., 1986). Results indicated that 16. 3 % of participants reported abnormal levels of emotional difficulties, 52. 7 % reported low self-esteem and 19. 6 % reported high hopelessness levels. Emotional difficulties were significantly predicted by hopelessness (β=. 272, p<. 00), self-esteem (β=. 112, p<. 00), gender (β=. 258, p<. 00), and residence (β=. 128, p<. 00). Together these variables explained 17 % of the variance in emotional difficulties. The study found relatively high levels of emotional difficulties especially in mid-adolescence. Findings suggested that self-esteem and hopelessness might partially explain emotional difficulties. Despite the low statistical power of findings it is important to investigate these relationships in future research, especially when considering that more than half the sample reported low self-esteem and almost 1 / 5 reported high hopelessness...|$|R

40|$|What is the {{syntactic}} {{status of}} non-finite constructions in English and Albanian? Are they considered as clauses? And, what is more, when carrying temporal meaning, can we classify them as non-finite clauses of time? Non-finite constructions, which are sequences {{of words that}} lack a finite verb, have {{attracted the attention of}} English and Albanian grammarians. Due to the variety of structures and semantic relations triggered by them, non-finite constructions stand in a thin line between phrases and clauses. While many modern English grammarians treat them as clauses, Albanian grammarians give relatively controversial comments on their status. In addition to the status of non-finite constructions, this paper aims at identifying the major semantic relations expressed by them, analyzing examples from a corpus taken from “The Da Vinci Code ” by Dan Brown, where time clauses make up about 20. 000 words. Comparing the examples from the original text to their counterparts from the <b>Albanian</b> translated <b>version</b> will offer a new prospect on the peculiarities of non-finite constructions in time clauses...|$|R
40|$|The aim was {{to adapt}} the Orofacial Esthetic Scale (OES) and to test psychometric {{properties}} of the <b>Albanian</b> language <b>version</b> in the cultural environment of the Republic of Kosovo. Methods: The OES questionnaire was translated from the original English version according to the accepted techniques. The reliability (internal consistency), and validity (construct, convergent and discriminative) were tested in 169 subjects, test-retest in 61 dental students (DS), and responsiveness in 51 prosthodontic patients with treatment needs (PPTN). Results: The corrected item correlation coefficients of OES-ALB ranged from 0. 686 to 0. 909. The inter-item correlation coefficient ranged between 0. 572 and 0. 919. The Cronbach’s alpha was 0. 961 and IIC 0. 758. Test- retest was confirmed by good ICCs and by no significant differences of the OES scores through the period of 14 days without any orofacial changes (p> 0. 05). Construct validity was proved by the presence of one-factor composition that assumed 79. 079 % of the variance. Convergent validity showed significant correlation between one general question about satisfaction with orofacial esthetics and the OES summary score, as well as between the sum of the 3 OHIP-ALB 49 questions related to orofacial aesthetics and the OES summary score. Discriminative validity was confirmed with statistically significant differences between DS, prosthodontic patients without treatment need an...|$|R

The test retest reliability was tested on 57 subjects (27 dental students and 30 complete denture wearers), the internal consistency on 389 subjects, and the responsiveness on 33 patients with a treatment demand (complete dentures). The significant association between the OHIP summary scores and the self-reported oral health (p 0. 05). The internal consistency showed high Cronbach’s alpha (0. 94 in general population and in prosthodontic patients, 0. 96 in the student group). The responsiveness was confirmed by the statistically significant difference between the mean OHIP score at the baseline and the follow-up (p< 0. 001) and by the high effect size (2. 19 for the OHIP Summary Score) in the edentulous patients with a treatment demand).

5000|$|Her heroism {{made her}} famous and was {{recorded}} in epic songs of Montenegrins and <b>Albanians.</b> The folkloric <b>version</b> of her heroism tells a slightly different chain of events: Smajl Martini, the clan leader was kidnapped in 1911 in Vranje by the Ottomans, and his body was never recovered, forcing Tringe to occupy her father's place. Since the Malissori uprising of 1911 was backed up by King Nikola Petrović, the epic song excluded {{the real story of}} her father death, hiding any reminiscence of the League of Prizren period, which would bring back territorial disputes between Albanians and the Kingdom of Montenegro. Ironically, the conflict between Albanians and Montenegro would be repeated shortly after. In 1911, the New York Times described Tringe Smajli as the [...] "Albanian Joan of Arc", based on the Montenegrin version of the story which was heard somewhere in Podgorica by the Times correspondent.

50|$|In the 1990s, Muslim Albanians {{placed their}} focus on {{restoring}} institutions, religious buildings and Islam as a faith in Albania that had overall been decimated by the communists. Hafiz Sabri Koçi, (1921-2004) an imam imprisoned by the communist regime and who led the first prayer service in Shkodër 1990 became the grand mufti of the Muslim Community of Albania. During this time the restoration of Islam in Albania appealed to older generations of Muslim Albanian adherents, those families with traditional clerical heredity and limited numbers of young school age people who wished to qualify and study abroad in Muslim countries. Most mosques and some madrassas destroyed and damaged during the communist era had by 1996 been either reconstructed or restored in former locations where they once stood before 1967 and in contemporary times there are 555 mosques. Muslim religious teachers and prayer leaders were also retrained abroad in Muslim states or in Albania. The Muslim Community of Albania is the main organisation overseeing Sunni Islam in Albania and during the 1990s it received funding and technical support from abroad to reconstitute its influence within the country. Due to interwar and communist era legacies of weakening Islam within Albania and secularisation of the population, {{the revival of the}} faith has been somewhat difficult due to people in Albania knowing little about Islam and other religions. Emigration in a post-communist environment of Albanians, many Muslim, has also hindered the recovery of religion, its socio-religious structures and organisation in Albania. In contemporary times the Muslim community has found itself being a majority population that is within a socio-political and intellectual minority position with often being on the defensive. Political links also emerged in the 1990s from parts of the Sunni Albanian community with the then new Albanian political establishment of whom some themselves were Muslim Albanians. The Sunni community is recognised by the Albanian state and it administers most of the mosques while also viewed as the main representative of Muslims in the country. As such it interprets its position as safeguarding an <b>Albanian</b> specific <b>version</b> of Islam which follows on institutional and ideological models established during the post-Ottoman state-building period and have gradually gained the status of an Albanian tradition. There are a few prayer houses located throughout Albania and one masjid (mosque without a minaret) run by the Sufi Rifai order.|$|R
