5|$|<b>Abortion</b> <b>is</b> the {{intentional}} termination of pregnancy, {{as compared to}} spontaneous termination (miscarriage). <b>Abortion</b> <b>is</b> closely allied to contraception in terms of women's control and regulation of their reproduction, and is often subject to similar cultural, religious, legislative and economic constraints. Where access to contraception is limited, women turn to abortion. Consequently, abortion rates {{may be used to}} estimate unmet needs for contraception. However the available procedures have carried great risk for women throughout most of history, and still do in the developing world, or where legal restrictions force women to seek clandestine facilities. Access to safe legal abortion places undue burdens on lower socioeconomic groups and in jurisdictions that create significant barriers. These issues have frequently been the subject of political and feminist campaigns where differing viewpoints pit health against moral values.|$|E
5|$|The U.S. teenage {{pregnancy}} rate is 26.5 per 1,000 women. The rate has declined by 57% since 1991. In 2013, the highest teenage birth rate was in Alabama, {{and the lowest}} in Wyoming. <b>Abortion</b> <b>is</b> legal throughout the U.S., owing to Roe v. Wade, a 1973 landmark decision by the Supreme Court of the United States. While the abortion rate is falling, the abortion ratio of 241 per 1,000 live births and abortion rate of 15 per 1,000 women aged 15–44 remain {{higher than those of}} most Western nations. In 2013, the average age at first birth was 26 and 40.6% of births were to unmarried women.|$|E
5|$|Some anti-abortion {{activists have}} {{continued}} to advance a discredited causal link between abortion and breast cancer. In the United States, they have advanced state legislation that in several states requires health care providers to present abortion {{as a cause of}} breast cancer when counseling women who are seeking abortion. This political intervention culminated when the George W. Bush administration altered the National Cancer Institute website to suggest that abortion might cause breast cancer. In response to public concern over this intervention, the NCI convened a 2003 workshop bringing together over 100 experts on the issue. This workshop concluded that while some studies reported a statistical correlation between breast cancer and abortion, the strongest scientific evidence from large prospective cohort studies demonstrates that <b>abortion</b> <b>is</b> not associated with an increase in breast cancer risk, and that the positive findings were likely due to response bias.|$|E

The possibility increases from less than 0.1% in 20-year-old mothers to 3% in those age 45. There is no known behavioral activity or environmental factor that changes the possibility. Down syndrome can be identified during pregnancy by prenatal screening followed by diagnostic testing or after birth by direct observation and genetic testing. More children are born with Down syndrome in countries where <b>abortion</b> <b>is</b> not allowed and in countries where pregnancy more commonly occurs at a later age. About 1.4 per 1000 live births in the United States and 1.1 per 1000 live births in Norway are affected. In the 1950s, in the United States, it occurred in 2 per 1000 live births with the decrease since then due to prenatal screening and abortions. The number of pregnancies with Down syndrome is more than two times greater with many spontaneously aborting. It {{is the cause of}} 8% of all congenital disorders.|$|E
5|$|Infant {{mortality}} rates are high, and life expectancy at birth is 50.03years. <b>Abortion</b> <b>is</b> illegal in Malawi. The Penal Code punishes women who seek illegal or clinical abortion with 14 years and 7 years in prison. There {{is a high}} adult prevalence rate of HIV/AIDS, with an estimated 980,000adults (or 9.1% of the population) living with the disease in 2015. There are approximately 27,000deaths each year from HIV/AIDS, and over half a million children orphaned because of the disease (2015). Approximately 250new people are infected each day, and at least 70% of Malawi's hospital beds are occupied by HIV/AIDS patients. The high rate of infection has resulted in an estimated 5.8% of the farm labor force dying of the disease. The government spends over $120,000 each year on funerals for civil servants who die of the disease. In 2006, international superstar Madonna started Raising Malawi, a foundation that helps AIDS orphans in Malawi, and also financed a documentary about the hardships experienced by Malawian orphans, called I Am Because We Are. Raising Malawi also works with the Millennium Villages Project to improve education, health care, infrastructure and agriculture in Malawi.|$|E

In 1939, the Penal Code was altered to permit an abortion that would save the pregnant woman's life. During the German occupation during World War II, the Vichy régime made abortion a capital crime.

5000|$|Thomas Aquinas, Pope Innocent III, and Pope Gregory XIV also {{believed}} that a fetus {{does not have a}} soul until [...] "quickening," [...] or when the fetus begins to kick and move, and therefore early <b>abortion</b> <b>was</b> not murder, though later <b>abortion</b> <b>was.</b> [...] Aquinas held that <b>abortion</b> <b>was</b> still wrong, even when not murder, regardless of when the soul entered the body.

5000|$|Until 1932, <b>{{abortion}}</b> <b>was</b> {{banned in}} Poland without exceptions. In that year, the new Penal Code legalised abortion {{only when there}} were medical reasons and, {{for the first time}} in Europe, when the pregnancy resulted from a criminal act. Except during the German occupation during the Second World War, this law was in effect from 1932 to 1956. In Nazi Germany, which included territories of Poland 1939-1945, the penalties for <b>abortion</b> <b>were</b> increased and in 1943, providing an abortion to an [...] "Aryan" [...] woman became a capital offence. <b>Abortion</b> <b>was</b> permitted if the foetus was deformed or disabled. In 1956 the Sejm legalised abortion in cases where the woman was experiencing [...] "difficult living conditions". The interpretation of the change in the law varied from a restrictive interpretation, in the late 1950s, to one in where <b>abortion</b> <b>was</b> allowed on request, in the 1960s and 1970s. It was not uncommon that women from countries where <b>abortions</b> <b>were</b> restricted, such as Sweden, travelled to Poland to carry out <b>abortions</b> which <b>were</b> accessible and affordable there.|$|R
2500|$|Scholars {{generally}} {{agree that}} <b>abortion</b> <b>was</b> {{performed in the}} classical world, but there is disagreement about {{the frequency with which}} <b>abortion</b> <b>was</b> performed and which cultures influenced early Christian thought on abortion. Some writers point to the Hippocratic Oath as evidence that condemnation of <b>abortion</b> <b>was</b> not a novelty introduced by the early Christians. Some writers state that there is evidence that some early Christians believed, as the Greeks did, in delayed ensoulment, or that a fetus does not have a soul until quickening, and therefore early <b>abortion</b> <b>was</b> not murder; Luker says there was disagreement on whether early <b>abortion</b> <b>was</b> wrong. Other writers say that early Christians considered abortion a sin even before ensoulment. According to some, the magnitude of the sin was, for the early Christians, on a level with general sexual immorality or other lapses; according to others, they saw it as [...] "an evil no less severe and social than oppression of the poor and needy".|$|R
25|$|Pro-choice advocates {{argue that}} illegalization of {{abortion}} increases {{the incidence of}} unsafe abortions, as the availability of professional abortion services decreases, and leads to increased maternal mortality.

According to the Women's international Network News, these [...] "back-alley" [...] <b>abortions</b> <b>are</b> the cause of thousands of deaths every year. More political attention has been given to the issue of abortions in Angola due to the unsafe procedures and the health effects on young women. Justice Minister Guilhermina Prata recently presented legislation with the intent to help decrease the number of illegal abortions done in Angola. In the region of Sub-Sahara Africa, the majority, if not all, of illegal <b>abortions</b> <b>are</b> unsafe. It is believed that 40 percent of women who have an illegal abortion die due to complications of the surgery. Information on unsafe <b>abortions</b> in Angola <b>is</b> difficult to obtain. However, {{due to the nature of}} the health care system and the prevalence of unofficial fees, the number of illegal <b>abortions</b> <b>is</b> potentially much higher than is reported.
