In particular, a dynamic difficulty <b>adaptation</b> <b>technique</b> of therapeutic tasks allows increasing patients' motivation by adapting the game difficulty to the patients' capabilities. This paper presents a difficulty <b>adaptation</b> <b>technique</b> dedicated to a family of therapeutic games for upper limb rehabilitation.

30|$|In {{the large}} vocabulary-based KPOW task, the HEQ-MA with mean and {{variance}} <b>adaptation</b> <b>technique</b> reduces recognition errors by 43.04 %, 38.77 %, 15.05 %, 41.39 %, and 8.56 % over the baseline recognizer, CMN, CMVN, MLLR, and HEQ-FC, respectively. From these results, {{we see that}} HEQ-MA produces substantially better performance than the other approaches. Compared to the results in the Aurora 2 task, the reduced performance gains in the KPOW task imply that the proposed <b>adaptation</b> <b>technique</b> is more suitable for the small vocabulary task due to the fewer possibilities of unobserved acoustic models in the HEQ-based adaptation process. The performance gap between both mean-only adaptation and mean and variance adaptation confirms both the importance of variance adaptation in the SNR conditions lower than 10 [*]dB {{and the effectiveness of}} our proposed variance adaptation approach.|$|R

All alternatives to mesh adaptation, such as level-set methods, have the well-known drawback of inducing volume conservation issues. In this paper, a moving mesh method is coupled to a topological mesh <b>adaptation</b> <b>technique</b> in order to track moving and deforming interfaces in multiphase simulations, with a robust control of mesh quality. Level-set functions are used as intermediaries to enhance the mesh <b>adaptation</b> <b>technique</b> with a volume conservation constraint, which is compatible both with implicit and with body-fitted interfaces.

Our model is a large shared GMM whose parameters vary in a subspace of relatively low dimension (e. g. 50), thus each state is described by a vector of low dimension which controls the GMM’s means and mixture weights in a manner determined by globally shared parameters. In addition we generalize to having each speech state be a mixture of substates, each with a different vector. Only the mathematical details are provided here; experimental results are being published separately...|$|R

50|$|Such {{characteristics}} of the data grid systems as large scale and heterogeneity require specific methods of tasks scheduling and resource allocation. To resolve the problem, majority of systems use extended classic methods of scheduling. Others invite fundamentally different methods based on incentives for autonomous nodes, like virtual money or reputation of a node.Another specificity of data grids, dynamics, consists in the continuous process of connecting and disconnecting of nodes and local load imbalance during an execution of tasks. That can make obsolete or non-optimal results of initial resource allocation for a task. As a result, much of the data grids utilize execution-time <b>adaptation</b> <b>techniques</b> that permit the systems to reflect to the dynamic changes: balance the load, replace disconnecting nodes, use the profit of newly connected nodes, recover a task execution after faults.|$|E
5000|$|There are {{technical}} {{solutions that}} provide similar benefits as : compressing/downsampling proxy servers and microbrowsers, like Opera Mobile, which can tailor any website to small display (using Small Screen Rendering technique). However, these browsers must still download an entire page (with graphics {{and other related}} files) which, if not optimized for mobile phones, can be time-consuming and expensive to download. To improve the latter issue, the two <b>adaptation</b> <b>techniques</b> can be used together. This is the idea behind proxy-based microbrowsers like Opera Mini that download the optimized and compressed version of web pages through dedicated proxy servers. However, web pages viewed on a mobile via a proxy-based microbrowser are rarely specifically designed for a mobile phone, so it is left up to the proxy server and browser {{to decide what to}} compress, what to display, and how to display it, which, unlike the [...]mobi version of the site, may not necessarily be how the web page owner intends for the mobile audience.|$|E

50|$|Approaches used {{to treat}} those who suffer from {{anterograde}} amnesia often use interventions which focus on compensatory techniques, such as beepers, written notes, diaries or through intensive training programs involving the active participation of the individual concerned, along with their supporting network of family and friends.In this perspective, environmental <b>adaptation</b> <b>techniques</b> are used, such as the compensatory technique education to training (exercise), organizational strategies, visual imagery and verbal labeling. In addition, other techniques are also used in rehabilitation, such as implicit tasks, speech and mnemotechnic methods. So far, it has been proven that education techniques of compensatory strategies for memory disorders are effective in individuals with minor traumatic brain injuries. In moderately or severely injured individuals, effective interventions are those appealing to external aids, such as reminders {{in order to facilitate}} particular knowledge or skill acquisition. Reality orientation techniques are also considered; Their purpose is to enhance orientation using stimulation and repetition of the basic orientation information. These techniques are regularly applied in populations of patients primarily presenting with dementia and head-injured patients.|$|E
50|$|To combat errors due to fading and {{interference}} on {{the radio}} link, data is divided at the transmitter into blocks and then the bits within a block are encoded and interleaved. The length of time required to transmit one such block determines the TTI. At the receiver all bits from a given block must be received {{before they can be}} deinterleaved and decoded. Having decoded the bits the receiver can estimate the bit error rate (BER). And because the shortest decodable transmission is one TTI the shortest period over which BER can be estimated is also one TTI. Thus in networks with link <b>adaptation</b> <b>techniques</b> based on the estimated BER the shortest interval between reports of the estimated performance, which are used to adapt to the conditions on the link, is at least one TTI. In {{order to be able to}} adapt quickly to the changing conditions in the radio link a communications system must have shorter TTIs. In order to benefit more from the effect of interleaving and to increase the efficiency of error-correction and compression techniques a system must, in general, have longer TTIs. These two contradicting requirements determine the choice of the TTI.|$|E

To test these strategies, we developed three versions of PRehab, a serious game for upper-limb rehabilitation. Seven stroke patients and three therapists participated in the experiment, and played all three versions of the game on a graphics tablet.
