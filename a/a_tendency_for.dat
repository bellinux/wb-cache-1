5|$|Because of {{its high}} {{resistance}} to P.cinnamomi dieback, the feasibility of using B.integrifolia as a rootstock for susceptible Banksia species in the cut flower trade is under investigation. Presently, the success rate for grafting is only 30–40%, and even with successful grafts there is <b>a</b> <b>tendency</b> <b>for</b> the union to fail under stress. More research is needed before the technique {{will be ready for}} commercial use.|$|E
5|$|If the {{concentration}} of the inert gas in the breathing gas is reduced below that {{of any of the}} tissues, there is <b>a</b> <b>tendency</b> <b>for</b> gas to return from the tissues to the breathing gas. This is known as out-gassing, and occurs during decompression, when the reduction in ambient pressure reduces the partial pressure of the inert gas in the lungs. This process may be complicated by the formation of gas bubbles, and the modeling is more complex and varied.|$|E
5|$|Measurements for the russet sparrow vary geographically, {{between the}} three {{subspecies}}, and also within the Himalayan subspecies cinnamomeus. The subspecies cinnamomeus is generally larger than the others, and within this form there is <b>a</b> <b>tendency</b> <b>for</b> birds at higher altitudes to be larger, and a clinal variation in size with the smallest birds in {{the west of the}} range and the largest in the east.|$|E

5|$|As {{printing}} became available, it {{was promptly}} used to publish herbals, the first printed matter being known as incunabula. In Europe, the first printed herbal with woodcut (xylograph) illustrations, the Puch der Natur of Konrad of Megenberg, appeared in 1475. Metal-engraved plates were first used in about 1580. As woodcuts and metal engravings could be reproduced indefinitely they were traded among printers: there was therefore a large {{increase in the}} number of illustrations together with an improvement in quality and detail but <b>a</b> <b>tendency</b> <b>for</b> repetition.|$|E

5|$|Because their {{elliptical}} orbits frequently {{take them}} {{close to the}} giant planets, comets are subject to further gravitational perturbations. Short-period comets have <b>a</b> <b>tendency</b> <b>for</b> their aphelia to coincide with a giant planet's semi-major axis, with the JFCs being the largest group. It is clear that comets {{coming in from the}} Oort cloud often have their orbits strongly influenced by the gravity of giant planets {{as a result of a}} close encounter. Jupiter is the source of the greatest perturbations, being more than twice as massive as all the other planets combined. These perturbations can deflect long-period comets into shorter orbital periods.|$|E
5|$|Fossil {{evidence}} indicates that other notable species of sharks, such as the great white shark, responded to competitive pressure from megalodon by avoiding regions it inhabited by mainly inhabiting the cooler waters of the time. In areas where their ranges seemed to overlap, such as in Pliocene Baja California, {{it is possible that}} megalodon and the great white shark occupied the area at different times of the year while following different migratory prey. Megalodon probably also had <b>a</b> <b>tendency</b> <b>for</b> cannibalism, much like contemporary sharks.|$|E
5|$|Some {{adjectives}} are inflected for {{degree of}} comparison, with the positive degree unmarked, the suffix -er marking the comparative, and -est marking the superlative: a small boy, {{the boy is}} smaller than the girl, that boy is the smallest. Some adjectives have irregular comparative and superlative forms, such as good, better, and best. Other adjectives have comparatives formed by periphrastic constructions, with the adverb more marking the comparative, and most marking the superlative: happier or more happy, the happiest or most happy. There is some variation among speakers regarding which adjectives use inflected or periphrastic comparison, and some studies have shown <b>a</b> <b>tendency</b> <b>for</b> the periphrastic forms to become more common {{at the expense of}} the inflected form.|$|E

5|$|In a {{long-lived}} {{bird with}} a small clutch size such as the Atlantic puffin, the survival rate of adults {{is an important factor}} influencing the success of the species. Only 5% of the ringed puffins that failed to reappear at the colony did so during the breeding season. The rest were lost some time between departing from land in the summer and reappearing the following spring. The birds spend the winter widely spread out in the open ocean, though there is <b>a</b> <b>tendency</b> <b>for</b> individuals from different colonies to overwinter in different areas. Little is known of their behaviour and diet at sea but no correlation was found between environmental factors, such as temperature variations, and their mortality rate. A combination of the availability of food in winter and summer probably influences the survival of the birds, since individuals starting the winter in poor condition are less likely to survive than those in good condition.|$|E
5|$|In {{the fall}} of 1852, McClellan {{published}} a manual on bayonet tactics that he had translated from the original French. He also received an assignment to the Department of Texas, with orders to perform a survey of Texas rivers and harbors. In 1853 he participated in the Pacific Railroad surveys, ordered by Secretary of War Jefferson Davis, to select an appropriate route for the planned transcontinental railroad. McClellan surveyed the western portion of the northern corridor along the 47th and 49th parallels from St. Paul to the Puget Sound. In so doing he demonstrated <b>a</b> <b>tendency</b> <b>for</b> insubordination toward senior political figures. Isaac Stevens, governor of the Washington Territory, became dissatisfied with McClellan's performance in scouting passes across the Cascade Range. McClellan selected Yakima Pass without a thorough reconnaissance and refused the governor's order to lead a party through it in winter conditions, relying on faulty intelligence about the depth of snow pack in that area. In so doing, he missed three greatly superior passes in the near vicinity, {{which would be the}} ones eventually used for railroads and interstate highways. The governor ordered McClellan to turn over his expedition logbooks, but McClellan steadfastly refused, most likely because of embarrassing personal comments that he had made throughout.|$|E
5|$|Linear probing {{provides}} good locality of reference, {{which causes}} it to require few uncached memory accesses per operation. Because of this, for low to moderate load factors, {{it can provide}} very high performance. However, compared to some other open addressing strategies, its performance degrades more quickly at high load factors because of primary clustering, <b>a</b> <b>tendency</b> <b>for</b> one collision to cause more nearby collisions. Additionally, achieving good performance with this method requires a higher-quality hash function than for some other collision resolution schemes. When used with low-quality hash functions that fail to eliminate nonuniformities in the input distribution, linear probing can be slower than other open-addressing strategies such as double hashing, which probes a sequence of cells whose separation is determined by a second hash function, or quadratic probing, where the size of each step varies depending on its position within the probe sequence.|$|E

5|$|The 1601 Act {{sought to}} deal with 'settled' poor who had found {{themselves}} temporarily out of work—it was assumed they would accept indoor relief or outdoor relief. Neither method of relief was {{at this time in}} history seen as harsh. The act was supposed {{to deal with}} beggars who were considered a threat to civil order. The Act was passed at a time when poverty was considered necessary as fear of poverty made people work. In 1607 a House of Correction was set up in each county. However, this system was separate from the 1601 system which distinguished between the settled poor and 'vagrants'. There was much variation in the application of the law and there was <b>a</b> <b>tendency</b> <b>for</b> the destitute to migrate towards the more generous parishes, usually situated in the towns. This led to the Settlement Act 1662 also known as the Poor Relief Act 1662, this allowed relief only to established residents of a parish; mainly through birth, marriage and apprenticeship. Unfortunately the laws reduced the mobility of labour and discouraged paupers from leaving their parish to find work. They also encouraged industry to create short contracts (e.g. 364 days) so that an employee could not become eligible for poor relief.|$|E
5|$|The Victor was {{commonly}} {{described as}} having good handling and excellent performance, along with favourable low speed flight characteristics. During the flight tests of the first prototype, the Victor proved its aerodynamic performance, flying up to Mach 0.98 without handling or buffeting problems; there were next to no aerodynamic changes between prototype and production aircraft. Production aircraft featured an automated nose-flap operation to counteract <b>a</b> <b>tendency</b> <b>for</b> the aircraft to pitch upwards during low-to-moderate Mach numbers. At low altitude, the Victor typically flew in a smooth and comfortable manner, {{in part due to}} its narrowness and flexibility of the crescent wing. One unusual flight characteristic of the early Victor was its self-landing capability; once lined up with the runway, the aircraft would naturally flare as the wing entered into ground effect while the tail continued to sink, giving a cushioned landing without any command or intervention by the pilot.|$|E
5|$|Darwin's {{interest}} on the biology of reef organisms was focussed on aspects related to his geological idea of subsidence; in particular, {{he was looking for}} confirmation that the reef building organisms could only live at shallow depths. FitzRoy's soundings at the Keeling Islands gave a depth limit for live coral of about 20fathoms (37m), and taking into account numerous observations by others, Darwin worked with a probable limit of 30fathoms (55m). Modern findings suggest a limit of around 100m, still {{a small fraction of the}} depth of the ocean floor at 3000–5000m. Darwin recognised the importance of red algae, and he reviewed other organisms that could have helped to build the reefs. He thought they lived at similarly shallow depths, but banks formed at greater depths were found in the 1880s. Darwin reviewed the distribution of different species of coral across a reef. He thought that the seaward reefs most exposed to wind and waves were formed by massive corals and red algae; this would be the most active area of reef growth and so would cause <b>a</b> <b>tendency</b> <b>for</b> reefs to grow outwards once they reach sea level. He believed that higher temperatures and the calmer water of the lagoons favoured the greatest coral diversity. These ecological ideas are still current, and research on the details continues.|$|E
