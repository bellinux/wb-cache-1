5|$|Due to the {{pressures}} of other projects, Jagger did not begin work on the memorial until the following year, by which time {{he had decided to}} alter the design. The revised memorial would be a third larger than before, cruciform in plan, and guarded by three bronze soldiers. Jagger initially intended to point the howitzer east, towards the Wellington Arch, but after much discussion—including advice from Lutyens and Sir Reginald Blomfield—it was agreed that the howitzer would point south to produce a pleasing silhouette from the park. A lengthy, year-long debate occurred within the RAWCF as to what inscription should be placed on the memorial, adding to the delay. Jagger then decided that the fourth side of the memorial should feature a dead soldier, a proposal which proved controversial. Although recumbent effigies were not uncommon on tombs and (to a lesser extent) war memorials, a sculpture of a dead soldier <b>at</b> <b>eye</b> level was an unusual and dramatic feature among First World War memorials—architects often preferred abstract, classical designs (such as the Cenotaph) or portrayed death through allegory. Jagger was adamant about the inclusion, even offering to pay for the casting of the additional figure himself. After considerable debate, the RAWCF agreed to the modification. Jagger's work continued to take longer than planned, partially due to shortages of staff, the need to approve each amendment to the plan and practical problems on the site itself. The names of his models for three of the statues are known: William Fosten for the Driver, another ex-gunner called Metcalfe for the Ammunition Carrier, and Lieutenant Eugene Paul Bennett, VC, who fought in the same regiment as Jagger.|$|E

Nicu Haas, an {{anthropologist}} at the Hebrew University Medical School in Jerusalem, examined the ossuary and discovered that it contained a heel bone with a nail driven through its side, indicating {{that the man had}} been crucified. The position of the nail relative to the bone indicates that the feet had been nailed to the cross from their side, not from their front; various opinions have been proposed as to whether they were both nailed together {{to the front of the}} cross or one on the left side, one on the right side. The point of the nail had olive wood fragments on it indicating that he was crucified on a cross made of olive wood or on an olive tree.

25|$|The American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH) Committee on Physical Agents has {{established}} a TLV for UV-C exposure to avoid such skin and eye injuries among those most susceptible. For 254nm UV, this TLV is 6 mJ/cm² over an eight-hour period. The TLV function differs by wavelengths because of variable energy and potential for cell damage. This TLV {{is supported by the}} International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection and is used in setting lamp safety standards by the Illuminating Engineering Society of North America. When TUSS was planned, and until quite recently, this TLV was interpreted as if eye exposure in rooms was continuous over eight hours and at the highest eye-level irradiance found in the room. In those highly unlikely conditions, a 6.0 mJ/cm² dose is reached under the ACGIH TLV after just eight hours of continuous exposure to an irradiance of 0.2 μW/cm². Thus, 0.2 μW/cm² was widely interpreted as the upper permissible limit of irradiance <b>at</b> <b>eye</b> height.|$|E
25|$|The frieze is 113 meters long, {{which makes}} it the longest {{surviving}} frieze of Greek Antiquity after the Parthenon frieze. On the western side it is interrupted by the ca. 20 meter wide stairway, which cuts into the foundation on that side and leads to a superstructure with columns. On {{both sides of this}} stairway there are projections constructed and decorated {{in a manner similar to}} the rest of the encircling frieze. The three-wing superstructure is relatively narrow compared with the base. The pillars surrounding the superstructure have platforms with profiles and Ionic capitals. There are many statues on the roof: a quadriga of horses, lion griffins, centaurs and deities, as well as uncompleted gargoyles. The upper hall gives a spacious impression thanks to the widely spaced columns. An additional columned hall was also planned for the inner courtyard where the fire altar itself was located, but not implemented. A frieze was installed there <b>at</b> <b>eye</b> level depicting the life of the mythical founder of the city, Telephus. Although no remains of paint have been found, it can be assumed that the entire structure was brightly painted in antiquity.|$|E

An experiment {{was performed to}} quantify and to minimize maternal effects on growth in rainbow trout. Six hundred families were reared until 198 day post fertilization (dpf) according to two different procedures. In the first procedure (NORM), all families were pooled <b>at</b> <b>eyed</b> stage. In the second procedure (MIN), where maternal effects {{due to differences in}} egg size were expected to be minimal, the spawns were divided into sub-groups with similar mean egg weight <b>at</b> <b>eyed</b> stage. These sub-groups were then pooled when they achieved the same mean body length (147 dpf). Genetic parameters were estimated for body weight, body length and condition factor at 198 dpf, with 2964 fish assigned to their parents using microsatellites. Significant maternal effects were observed in the NORM group for body weight and body length (m²= 0. 08 ± 0. 03). The heritability of body weight was 0. 16 ± 0. 07 in the NORM group and 0. 36 ± 0. 06 in the MIN group, in which maternal effects were not significant. It is concluded that, when eggs of different females are mixed <b>at</b> <b>eyed</b> stage, maternal effects persist at least until 198 dpf. The proposed procedure efficiently limits maternal effects, substantially increasing the heritability for growth, and therefore the expected selection response...|$|R
25|$|During 1791, {{when the}} Trustees were {{negotiating}} with John Rennie, they {{had asked him}} to assess an extension of the navigation from Stowmarket to the River Lark at Bury St Edmunds, but this was not pursued. With the navigation thriving, there were two proposals for canals from Ipswich to Eye, Suffolk in 1819. A meeting was held in January <b>at</b> <b>Eye,</b> which was chaired by Charles Cornwallis, 2nd Marquess Cornwallis. It considered two reports, one proposed by the civil engineer William Cubitt, which involved a tunnel through the hills at Mendlesham, with the estimated cost exceeding £100,000, and another, for a canal over the hills, costing £80,000. Both were thought to be too expensive to implement, but a third proposal emerged, for an extension from the River Gipping at Needham Market, which would follow the valley of a tributary through Creeting St Mary to Earl Stonham, where a basin would be built beside the turnpike road (now the A140 road). This would enable waggons to make a round trip from Eye in a single day, rather than the two days that a trip to Ipswich took. The scheme was estimated to cost £12,000, and shares in it were offered at the meeting. Although many were taken up, the scheme did not advance any further.|$|E
25|$|Skilled readers {{move their}} eyes during {{reading on the}} average of every quarter of a second. During {{the time that the}} eye is fixated, new {{information}} is brought into the processing system. Although the average fixation duration is 200–250 ms (thousandths of a second), the range is from 100 ms to over 500 ms. The distance the eye moves in each saccade (or short rapid movement) is between 1 and 20 characters with the average being 7–9 characters. The saccade lasts for 20–40 ms and during this time vision is suppressed so that no new information is acquired. There is considerable variability in fixations (the point at which a saccade jumps to) and saccades between readers and even for the same person reading a single passage of text. Skilled readers make regressions back to material already read about 15 percent of the time. The main difference between faster and slower readers is that the latter group consistently shows longer average fixation durations, shorter saccades, and more regressions. These basic facts about eye movement have been known for almost a hundred years, but only recently have researchers begun to look <b>at</b> <b>eye</b> movement behavior as a reflection of cognitive processing during reading.|$|E

The sculpture's position high above eye level gives the soldier anonymity, complimenting the abstract shapes of the structures and allowing an onlooker to project an image of their own choosing onto it.|$|E
