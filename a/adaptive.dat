5|$|The {{upcoming}} {{generation of}} extremely large telescopes (ELTs) will require sophisticated <b>adaptive</b> optics {{in order to}} be used to their full capability. Because the WHT has an advanced <b>adaptive</b> optics system already operating, it is receiving attention from the various ELT programs. The European Southern Observatory's European-ELT (E-ELT) project has begun a programme to utilise the WHT as a test-bed for its <b>adaptive</b> optics system, and will receive several nights per year for on-sky testing. The project involves construction of new optical experiments at one of the Nasmyth foci, and is called CANARY. CANARY will demonstrate the multi-object <b>adaptive</b> optics (MOAO) required for the EAGLE instrument on the E-ELT.|$|E

5|$|The American {{biologist}} Sewall Wright, who had {{a background}} in animal breeding experiments, focused on combinations of interacting genes, {{and the effects of}} inbreeding on small, relatively isolated populations that exhibited genetic drift. In 1932, Wright introduced the concept of an <b>adaptive</b> landscape and argued that genetic drift and inbreeding could drive a small, isolated sub-population away from an <b>adaptive</b> peak, allowing natural selection to drive it towards different <b>adaptive</b> peaks. The work of Fisher, Haldane and Wright founded the discipline of population genetics. This integrated natural selection with Mendelian genetics, which was the critical first step in developing a unified theory of how evolution worked.|$|E

25|$|Wharton School {{researcher}} William Evan {{called the}} population level the organization-set, {{and focused on}} the interrelations of individual organizations within the population as early as 1966. However, prior to the mid-1970s, the majority of organizational studies research focused on <b>adaptive</b> change in organizations (See also <b>adaptive</b> management and <b>adaptive</b> performance). The ecological approach moved focus to the environmental selection processes that affect organizations.|$|E
25|$|Unlike {{the innate}} immune system, the <b>adaptive</b> {{immune system is}} highly {{specific}} to a particular pathogen. <b>Adaptive</b> immunity can also provide long-lasting protection; for example, someone who recovers from measles is now protected against measles for their lifetime. In other cases it does not provide lifetime protection; for example, chickenpox. The <b>adaptive</b> system response destroys invading pathogens and any toxic molecules they produce. Sometimes the <b>adaptive</b> system is unable to distinguish harmful from harmless foreign molecules; {{the effects of this}} may be hayfever, asthma or any other allergy. Antigens are any substances that elicit the <b>adaptive</b> immune response. The cells that carry out the <b>adaptive</b> immune response are white blood cells known as lymphocytes. Two main broad classes—antibody responses and cell mediated immune response—are also carried by two different lymphocytes (B cells and T cells). In antibody responses, B cells are activated to secrete antibodies, which are proteins also known as immunoglobulins. Antibodies travel through the bloodstream and bind to the foreign antigen causing it to inactivate, which does not allow the antigen to bind to the host.|$|E
25|$|In malaria, as {{in other}} infections, innate immune {{responses}} lead into, and stimulate, <b>adaptive</b> immune responses. The genetic control of innate and <b>adaptive</b> immunity is now a large and flourishing discipline.|$|E
25|$|<b>Adaptive</b> cells {{change their}} absorption/reflection {{characteristics}} depending {{to respond to}} environmental conditions. An <b>adaptive</b> material responds to the intensity and angle of incident light. At {{the part of the}} cell where the light is most intense, the cell surface changes from reflective to <b>adaptive,</b> allowing the light to penetrate the cell. The other parts of the cell remain reflective increasing the retention of the absorbed light within the cell.|$|E
25|$|An {{automatic}} <b>adaptive</b> equalizer corrects distorted signals, greatly improving data {{performance and}} speed. All computer modems use equalizers. The automatic <b>adaptive</b> equalizer {{was invented in}} 1965 by Bell Laboratories electrical engineer Robert Lucky.|$|E
25|$|The <b>adaptive</b> immune system, {{also known}} as the {{acquired}} immune system or, more rarely, as the specific immune system, is a subsystem of the overall immune system that is composed of highly specialized, systemic cells and processes that eliminate pathogens or prevent their growth. The <b>adaptive</b> immune system is one of the two main immunity strategies found in vertebrates (the other being the innate immune system). <b>Adaptive</b> immunity creates immunological memory after an initial response to a specific pathogen, and leads to an enhanced response to subsequent encounters with that pathogen. This process of acquired immunity is the basis of vaccination. Like the innate system, the <b>adaptive</b> system includes both humoral immunity components and cell-mediated immunity components.|$|E
25|$|A {{population}} {{study has}} shown that the protective effect of the sickle-cell trait against falciparum malaria involves the augmentation of <b>adaptive</b> as well as innate immune responses to the malaria parasite, illustrating the expected transition from innate to <b>adaptive</b> immunity.|$|E
25|$|Note {{that the}} innate and <b>adaptive</b> {{portions}} {{of the immune system}} work together, not in spite of each other. The <b>adaptive</b> arm, B, and T cells couldn't function without the innate system' input. T cells are useless without antigen-presenting cells to activate them, and B cells are crippled without T cell help. On the other hand, the innate system would likely be overrun with pathogens without the specialized action of the <b>adaptive</b> immune response.|$|E
25|$|Closely {{linked to}} {{resilience}} is <b>adaptive</b> capacity, {{which is the}} property of an ecosystem that describes change in stability landscapes and resilience. <b>Adaptive</b> capacity in socio-ecological systems refers {{to the ability of}} humans to deal with change in their environment by observation, learning and altering their interactions.|$|E
25|$|In 2014, {{a system}} was {{developed}} that combined an <b>adaptive</b> {{surface with a}} glass substrate that redirect the absorbed to a light absorber {{on the edges of}} the sheet. The system also includes an array of fixed lenses/mirrors to concentrate light onto the <b>adaptive</b> surface. As the day continues, the concentrated light moves along the surface of the cell. That surface switches from reflective to <b>adaptive</b> when the light is most concentrated and back to reflective after the light moves along.|$|E
25|$|A photo {{mosaic of}} Mona Lisa was {{digitally}} produced in 2012 from randomly compiled photos using <b>adaptive</b> rendering software, {{to promote the}} potential of Simultaneous Multi-compare <b>Adaptive</b> Rendering Technology (SMART), which automatically analyzes and matches the shapes and colors of source-photos to a desired image.|$|E
25|$|Adaptation: The future {{level of}} <b>adaptive</b> {{capacity}} in human and natural systems {{to climate change}} will affect how society will be impacted by climate change. Assessments may under- or overestimate <b>adaptive</b> capacity, leading to under- or overestimates of positive or negative impacts.|$|E
25|$|<b>Adaptive</b> control uses on-line {{identification}} of the process parameters, or modification of controller gains, thereby obtaining strong robustness properties. <b>Adaptive</b> controls were applied {{for the first time}} in the aerospace industry in the 1950s, and have found particular success in that field.|$|E
