5|$|As Peter {{exits the}} {{abortion}} clinic, he notices a pro-life rally nearby. At the rally, a protester shows Peter a video tape discouraging <b>abortion</b> (<b>as</b> {{a reference to}} the cult classic 1936 American propaganda exploitation film Reefer Madness), portraying it as murder, larceny, jaywalking and securities fraud. The tape claims that abortion prevented Nazi leader Adolf Hitler's would-be assassin, a fourth Stooge brother, of The Three Stooges, and Islamic extremist Osama bin Laden's America-loving brother from being born.|$|E
5|$|After {{the general}} {{election}} in November 1982, the incoming Michigan governor, James Blanchard, appointed Mansour in December to the directorship of the Michigan Department of Social Services (DSS); Michigan's biggest agency. The administrative position involved oversight of public health programs including disbursement of some $5million in federal monies from Medicaid for abortions. To accept the appointment, she asked for and received permission from her order and from Szoka. Szoka asked Mansour to publicly state her opposition to abortion; he said he originally gave his approval on this condition. Mansour did not follow his request. Though she personally disapproved of abortion, she knew that many others felt differently, and she determined that the poor should have equal access to <b>abortion</b> <b>as</b> {{long as it was}} legal.|$|E

5|$|Some anti-abortion {{activists have}} {{continued}} to advance a discredited causal link between abortion and breast cancer. In the United States, they have advanced state legislation that in several states requires health care providers to present <b>abortion</b> <b>as</b> a cause of breast cancer when counseling women who are seeking abortion. This political intervention culminated when the George W. Bush administration altered the National Cancer Institute website to suggest that abortion might cause breast cancer. In response to public concern over this intervention, the NCI convened a 2003 workshop bringing together over 100 experts on the issue. This workshop concluded that while some studies reported a statistical correlation between breast cancer and abortion, the strongest scientific evidence from large prospective cohort studies demonstrates that abortion is not associated {{with an increase in}} breast cancer risk, and that the positive findings were likely due to response bias.|$|E
5|$|The {{right to}} privacy is not {{explicitly}} identified in the U.S. Constitution, but the ACLU led the charge to establish such rights in the indecisive 1961 Poe v. Ullman case, which addressed a state statute outlawing contraception. The issue arose again in Griswold v. Connecticut (1965), {{and this time the}} Supreme Court adopted the ACLU's position, and formally declared a {{right to privacy}}. The New York affiliate of the ACLU pushed to eliminate anti-abortion laws starting in 1964, a year before Griswold was decided, and in 1967 the ACLU itself formally adopted the right to <b>abortion</b> <b>as</b> a policy. The ACLU led the defense in United States v. Vuitch which expanded the right of physicians to determine when abortions were necessary. These efforts culminated {{in one of the most}} controversial Supreme Court decisions of all time, Roe v. Wade, which legalized abortion in the first three months of pregnancy. The ACLU successfully argued against state bans on interracial marriage, in the case of Loving v. Virginia (1967).|$|E
25|$|The Leges Henrici Primi, written c. 1115, treated pre-quickening <b>abortion</b> <b>as</b> a misdemeanor, and post-quickening <b>abortion</b> <b>as</b> {{carrying}} a lesser penalty than homicide.

25|$|Although {{abortion}} was accepted in Rome, attitudes {{changed with the}} spread of Christianity and around 211 AD emperors Septimius Severus and Caracalla banned <b>abortion</b> <b>as</b> infringing on parental rights; temporary exile was the punishment. Punishment for abortion in the Roman Republic was generally inflicted {{as a violation of}} the father's right to dispose of his offspring. Because of the influence of Stoicism, which did not view the fetus as a person, the Romans did not punish <b>abortion</b> <b>as</b> homicide.|$|E

50|$|These {{restrictions}} {{were seen as}} the government's way of emphasizing the importance of population growth. The scholar Nie Jing-Bao explains that these laws were relaxed in the late 1950s and early 1960s {{with the intent of}} reducing the number of deaths and lifelong injuries women sustained due to illegal <b>abortions</b> <b>as</b> well as serving as a form of population control when used in conjunction with birth control.|$|R

5000|$|Abortion is {{no longer}} a {{dangerous}} procedure. This applies not just to therapeutic <b>abortions</b> <b>as</b> performed in hospitals but also to so-called illegal <b>abortions</b> <b>as</b> done by physician. In 1957 there were only 260 deaths in the whole country attributed to abortions of any kind, second, and even more important, the conference abortion sponsored by Planned Parenthood estimated that 90 percent of all illegal abortions are presently being done by physicians. Whatever trouble arises usually arises from self-induced abortions, which comprise approximately 8 percent, or with the very small percentage that go to some kind of non-medical abortionist. Abortion, whether therapeutic or illegal, is in the main no longer dangerous, because it is being done well by physicians.|$|R
25|$|In the Australian Capital Territory, {{reference}} to <b>abortion</b> <b>as</b> a criminal offence were repealed by the Crimes (Abolition of Offence of Abortion) Act 2002.

25|$|Pro-choice advocates {{argue that}} illegalization of {{abortion}} increases {{the incidence of}} unsafe <b>abortions,</b> <b>as</b> the availability of professional abortion services decreases, and leads to increased maternal mortality.

25|$|Some {{schools of}} Muslim law permit {{abortion}} {{in the first}} sixteen weeks of pregnancy, whereas others only allow {{it in the first}} seven weeks of pregnancy. The further along the pregnancy has progressed, the greater the wrong. The Qur'an does not specifically mention abortion, but it skirts the issue by condemning intentional murder. All schools accept <b>abortion</b> <b>as</b> a means to save the mother's life.|$|E
25|$|The Church {{does not}} approve {{of the use of}} <b>abortion</b> <b>as</b> a means of birth control or family planning, but recognizes a woman's right to receive one. Abortion is condoned only in cases of rape, incest, fetal abnormalities, or when a mother's {{physical}} or mental health is at risk. The Church opposes any legislation which would prevent women from obtaining abortions or information about abortions.|$|E

She tried to lessen the focuses on <b>abortion,</b> <b>as</b> an issue already won, and on rape and pornography, which she believed most women did not consider to be high priorities.|$|E

25|$|Because {{the courts}} did not {{specifically}} establish <b>abortion</b> <b>as</b> a right, Parliament has leave to legislate on {{this aspect of}} the matter; and in 1989, the Progressive Conservative government attempted to do just that. A bill was introduced that would allow abortion only if two doctors certified that the woman's health was in danger. This bill passed the House of Commons but was defeated by a tie vote in the Senate.|$|E
25|$|Russia was {{the first}} country to legalise abortions and offer free medical care in state {{hospitals}} to do so.

The Bolsheviks legalised abortion in November 1920. This {{was the first}} time in world history that women had won the right to free abortions in state hospitals.|$|E
25|$|In Casey, {{the plaintiffs}} {{challenged}} five {{provisions of the}} Pennsylvania Abortion Control Act of 1982 authored by Rep. Stephen F.

The Court in Roe {{was the first to}} establish <b>abortion</b> <b>as</b> a fundamental right protected by the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The majority in Roe further held that women have a privacy interest protecting their right to abortion embedded in the liberty clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The five provisions at issue in Casey are summarized below.|$|E
