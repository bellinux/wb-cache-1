5|$|At its {{greatest}} extent in the 1950s, the highway extended north from Webberville through Owosso and St. Charles to a junction with M-46 between Hemlock and Shields. M-47 turned east along M-46, running concurrently with that highway to Saginaw Township. There M-47 turned north independently to a junction with US10, {{and then ran}} concurrently with US10 into Saginaw. Once in the city, M-47 turned north along Bay Street out of town toward Bay City. M-47 joined US23 and followed it north of town.

5|$|During the wet season, food is {{abundant}} and giraffes are more spread out, while {{during the dry}} season, they gather around the remaining evergreen trees and bushes. Mothers tend to feed in open areas, presumably {{to make it easier}} to detect predators, although this may reduce their feeding efficiency. As a ruminant, the giraffe first chews its food, then swallows it for processing and then visibly passes the half-digested cud up the neck <b>and</b> <b>back</b> <b>into</b> the mouth to chew again. It is common for a giraffe to salivate while feeding. The giraffe requires less food than many other herbivores because the foliage it eats has more concentrated nutrients and it has a more efficient digestive system. The animal's faeces come in the form of small pellets. When it has access to water, a giraffe drinks at intervals no longer than three days.|$|E

5|$|Jimmy Calderwood {{took over}} in 2004 and Aberdeen posted more {{consistent}} results than in previous seasons. In the 2006–07 season, the club finished in third place {{in the league and}} entered the final qualifying round for the 2007–08 UEFA Cup. Aberdeen defeated Dnipro on the away goals rule to progress (the first time Aberdeen had won on away goals in European football for 40 years). They went on to beat F.C. Copenhagen 4–0, which was the biggest margin of victory and one of Pittodrie's biggest crowds since the 1980s. This set up a meeting with German giants Bayern Munich, which they lost 7–3 on aggregate after a 2–2 draw which saw Aberdeen lead twice in the first leg. Calderwood was sacked by Aberdeen on 24 May 2009, hours after he took the club to a fourth-place finish <b>and</b> <b>back</b> <b>into</b> Europe. Poor domestic cup performances were thought to be the reason for Calderwood's dismissal.|$|E

Mr. Krabs has hired Patrick as a security guard so he does not have to pay for a real one, and SpongeBob spectacularly decorates the Krusty Krab. Patrick, Squidward, and Mr. Krabs follow SpongeBob into the freezer where he shows them a giant Krabby Patty ice sculpture that he made himself. However, in attempt to take the ice sculpture outside, they accidentally knock SpongeBob out the open freezer door; he then rebounds off the kitchen door <b>and</b> <b>back</b> <b>into</b> the freezer. The impact shuts the door and it locks, trapping all four friends inside. Mr. Krabs remembers that {{there is a way to}} escape without using the door, which is through the ventilation system.

Contador, who had been riding out front much of the stage after an early attack, faded first and {{finished}} the day in third place. Rolland eventually rode away from Sánchez for the stage win, but Sánchez' second place on the day moved him up to seventh overall, <b>and</b> <b>back</b> <b>into</b> the mountains classification lead. Sánchez, as well as Contador, moved up a place in the stage 20 individual time trial. Damiano Cunego, who had been in fifth place and is considered a poor time trialist, had a bad race against the clock even by his standards, losing two minutes to most of the race's top overall riders and more than three to the stage winner. This moved him up to sixth place overall, the position in which he concluded the race the next day, while also finishing as mountains classification winner.|$|E
5|$|The Egyptians then {{proceeded}} towards {{the town of}} Polytsaravos and reached it on August 28. Awaiting them there were 2,000 Maniots behind their fortifications. The Maniots had chosen Polytsaravos as their position of defence as it was on high ground and was surrounded by rocky slopes. This would have meant that the Egyptians could have been stopped before {{they arrived at the}} town. As part of their defence plan the villages sent all the women and children to the mountains before improving the fortifications. As the Egyptians arrived at the walls, the Maniots sallied out and caught the Egyptians by surprise. The Egyptians, suffering losses, withdrew from Mani <b>and</b> <b>back</b> <b>into</b> the Laconian plain. The Egyptians had lost 400 men during the battle and the Maniots only lost 9. This was the last invasion launched against Mani.|$|E
5|$|During 4January, Rewa {{moved back}} into the South Pacific basin and {{continued}} eastward as a weakening category 3severe tropical cyclone, with the FMS estimating the 10-minute sustained windspeeds at 150km/h (90mph). During the next day, its eye became obscured after the mountains of New Caledonia affected Rewa's circulation by creating a hot and dry Foehn wind. The FMS reported that the system had weakened into a category 2 tropical cyclone, while the JTWC reported that Rewa had become a tropical storm. The system subsequently made landfall {{in the vicinity of}} Saint Vincent Bay on New Caledonia's south-western coast, before it emerged near Thio from the east coast during 6 January. By 7January, Rewa's circulation had become exposed under the influence of upper level north-westerlies; as a result both the FMS and JTWC reported that Rewa had weakened into a depression. Over the next 3 days, the residual low-level circulation was steered towards the northwest and Papua New Guinea in a southeasterly trade wind flow generated by a powerful area of high pressure located between New Zealand and Kermadec Islands. During 10 January, Rewa's remnants moved out of the South Pacific basin <b>and</b> <b>back</b> <b>into</b> the Australian region while starting to re-intensify into a tropical cyclone, as a mid to upper level trough over eastern Australia increased in size.|$|E

5|$|Pope made {{a number}} of saves as York held league leaders Rochdale to a 0–0 away draw, with a point being enough to lift the team back into seventh-place. York were {{prevented}} from equalling a club record of eight consecutive clean sheets when Accrington scored a stoppage time equaliser in a 1–1 home draw, in which York had taken earlier taken the lead with a Coulson penalty. A 1–0 win away win over Oxford, which was decided by a second half Coulson penalty, resulted in York moving one place above their opponents <b>and</b> <b>back</b> <b>into</b> seventh-place. York consolidated their place in a play-off position after beating Bury 1–0 at home with a fifth-minute goal scored by Lowe from a Hayhurst corner. The result meant York opened up a five-point lead over eighth-placed Oxford with two fixtures remaining. A place in the League Two play-offs was secured following a 1–0 win over Newport at home, in which Coulson scored the only goal in the 77th minute with a 25-yard free kick. Pope earned a nomination for League Two Player of the Month for April 2014, having conceded only one goal in five matches in that period.|$|E
5|$|The {{assault was}} under the direct command of Major-General Essad Pasha. The plan was to gather the assault force {{secretly}} behind the Turkish lines on 18 May. Then at 03:30 19 May, {{while it was still}} dark, the Turkish forces would simultaneously attack all along the ANZAC perimeter. The aim was to force the defenders out of their trenches <b>and</b> <b>back</b> <b>into</b> the sea. To maintain surprise the attack would not be preceded by an artillery bombardment; but the previous day all the available Turkish artillery bombarded the ANZAC lines between 17:00 and midnight. This was something they had done twice before that month. The signal to start the attack {{was supposed to have been}} the detonation of a large mine at Quinn's Post, in the centre of the ANZAC lines, but by 19 May the tunnel for the mine had not been completed. The attacking force, from north to south, comprised the 19th Division (now made up of the 27th, 57th and 72nd Infantry Regiments), 5th Division (13th and 14th Infantry Regiments), 2nd Division (1st, 5th and 6th Infantry Regiments), 16th Division (33rd, 47th, 48th and 125th Infantry Regiments) and the now independent 77th Infantry Regiment. In total this was around 42,000 men. The 2nd and 16th Divisions were fresh, having just arrived on the peninsula, while the other two had taken part in some of the previous counter-attacks at Anzac Cove.|$|E
