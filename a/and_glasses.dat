5|$|In 1827, at its peak, {{the canal}} {{transport}}ed 332,000 tons. The {{main purpose of}} the canal was still to transport coal to Givors, from where it could be taken to other towns on the river Rhone. On the return trip, boats carried some of the merchandise of the Midi including iron, oak wood and other things needed by the factories of the Loire department. By 1831, the population of Givors had risen to 9,210. There were many factories making window panes, bottles <b>and</b> <b>glasses,</b> and the port had a busy trade in coal shipment. Ten large glass works had been established at Rive-de-Gier that also transported their products by the canal.|$|E

50|$|The {{original}} wood <b>and</b> annealed <b>glass</b> in the Palm Court {{had deteriorated}} {{to a point}} for the need of emergency stabilization in 2008. Renovations began in 1992 and included replacing the upper wood <b>and</b> <b>glass</b> vent sash with aluminum <b>and</b> safety <b>glass,</b> <b>and</b> replacing the vertical wood <b>and</b> <b>glass</b> components with new replicated aluminum extrusions <b>and</b> safety <b>glass</b> glazing to match the original specifications exactly.|$|R
5000|$|The most {{dramatic}} use of iron <b>and</b> <b>glass</b> {{was in the}} new central market of Paris, Les Halles (1853-70), an ensemble of huge iron <b>and</b> <b>glass</b> pavilions designed by Victor Baltard (1805-1874).Henri Labrouste (1801-1875) used iron <b>and</b> <b>glass</b> to create a dramatic cathedral-like reading room for the Biblioth√®que nationale de France, site Richelieu (1854-75).|$|R

25|$|The {{development}} of lead glass {{continued through the}} twentieth century, when in 1932 scientists at the Corning Glassworks, New York State, developed a new lead glass of high optical clarity. This {{became the focus of}} Steuben Glass Works, a division of Corning, which produced decorative vases, bowls, <b>and</b> <b>glasses</b> in Art Deco style. Lead-crystal continues to be used in industrial and decorative applications.|$|E
25|$|Many {{television}} shows and movies have used Marx Brothers references. Animaniacs and Tiny Toons, for example, have featured Marx Brothers jokes and skits. Hawkeye Pierce (Alan Alda) on M*A*S*H occasionally {{put on a}} fake nose <b>and</b> <b>glasses,</b> and, holding a cigar, did a Groucho impersonation to amuse patients recovering from surgery. Early episodes also featured a singing and off-scene character named Captain Spaulding as a tribute.|$|E
25|$|Neon {{lighting}} {{is closely related}} to fluorescent lighting, which developed about 25 years after neon tube lighting. In fluorescent lights, the light emitted by rarefied gases within a tube is used exclusively to excite fluorescent materials that coat the tube, which then shine with their own colors that become the tube's visible, usually white, glow. Fluorescent coatings <b>and</b> <b>glasses</b> are also an option for neon tube lighting, but are usually selected to obtain bright colors.|$|E

25|$|Jerry Springer debuted on September 30, 1991. It was {{developed}} by WLWT to mimic the format and look of fellow talk show The Phil Donahue Show, {{all the way down}} to Jerry's haircut <b>and</b> <b>glasses,</b> making him look like Phil Donahue (both were produced by Multimedia Entertainment). It started as a politically oriented talk show, a longer version of Springer's commentaries. Guests included Oliver North and Jesse Jackson, and topics included homelessness and gun politics.|$|E
25|$|The {{top half}} of the statue (excluding its left hand) was finally {{recovered}} on March 10, 2009, and the bottom half and right hand shortly after, in the canal by construction workers while constructing a new boardwalk area as part of a beautification project. The statue is still missing its left hand <b>and</b> <b>glasses.</b> The KFC outlet where this statue once stood has since closed; the statue is now located at an outlet near Koshien Stadium. Their luck hasn't gotten any better.|$|E
25|$|According to NBC, the set for {{the show}} has had two major changes over the years. When the show first started in 1991, it was very basic with white walls, {{in an effort to}} capture the feel of fellow talk show Donahue, Jerry's haircut <b>and</b> <b>glasses</b> even seeming to make him look like Phil Donahue. The general look of this set was carried over when the series first moved to Chicago in September 1992, with an unpolished, open air look and bright colored shapes.|$|E
40|$|Water {{activity}} <b>and</b> <b>glass</b> {{transition temperature}} concepts {{were used to}} investigate {{the connection between the}} two distinct criteria of food stability. The data on sorption isotherms <b>and</b> <b>glass</b> transition temperatures were obtained from the literature. Two most commonly used models i. e. GAB and Gordon-Taylor equations were used to model water activity/moisture content <b>and</b> <b>glass</b> transition temperatures/solids content relationships. The models&# 039; (GAB and Gordon-Taylor) parameters were used to estimate water activity <b>and</b> <b>glass</b> transition temperature at given moisture/solids content. Results indicate that there is a considerable discrepancy in the temperature-related stability criteria predicted by the concepts of water activity (aw) <b>and</b> the <b>glass</b> phenomenon (Tg).

40|$|Fiberglass <b>and</b> <b>Glass</b> Technology: Energy-Friendly Compositions and Applications {{provides}} a detailed overview of fiber, float <b>and</b> container <b>glass</b> technology with {{special emphasis on}} energy- and environmentally-friendly compositions, applications and manufacturing practices which have recently become available and continue to emerge. Energy-friendly compositions are variants of incumbent fiberglass <b>and</b> <b>glass</b> compositions that are obtained by the reformulation of incumbent compositions to reduce the viscosity and thereby the energy demand. Environmentally-friendly compositions are variants of incumbent fiber, float <b>and</b> container <b>glass</b> compositions that are obtained by the reformulation of incumbent compositions to reduce environmentally harmful emissions from their melts. Energy- and environmentally-friendly compositions are expected to become {{a key factor in}} the future for the fiberglass <b>and</b> <b>glass</b> industries. This book consists of two complementary sections: continuous <b>glass</b> fiber technology <b>and</b> soda-lime-silica <b>glass</b> technology...|$|R
25|$|Another {{important}} reliability {{problem is}} caused by air leakage into the tube. Usually oxygen in the air reacts chemically with the hot filament or cathode, quickly ruining it. Designers developed tube designs that sealed reliably. This was why most tubes were constructed of glass. Metal alloys (such as Cunife and Fernico) <b>and</b> <b>glasses</b> had been developed for light bulbs that expanded and contracted in similar amounts, as temperature changed. These {{made it easy to}} construct an insulating envelope of glass, while passing connection wires through the glass to the electrodes.|$|E
25|$|Prescriptions {{for contact}} lenses <b>and</b> <b>glasses</b> may be similar, {{but are not}} interchangeable. Prescribing of contact lenses is usually {{restricted}} to various combinations of ophthalmologists, optometrists and opticians. An eye examination {{is needed to determine}} an individual's suitability for contact lens wear. This typically includes a refraction to determine the proper power of the lens and an assessment of the health of the eye's anterior segment. Many eye diseases prohibits contact lens wear, such as active infections, allergies, and dry eye. Keratometry is especially important in the fitting of rigid lenses.|$|E

50|$|In the 1820s, Saint-Gobain {{continued}} {{to function as}} it had under the Ancien R√©gime, manufacturing high-quality mirrors <b>and</b> <b>glass</b> for the luxury market. However, in 1824, a new glass manufacturer was established in Commentry, France, and in 1837 several Belgian glass manufacturers were also founded. While Saint-Gobain {{continued to}} dominate the luxury high-quality mirror <b>and</b> <b>glass</b> markets, its newly created competitors focused their attention on making medium and low-quality products. The manufacture of products of such quality made mirrors <b>and</b> <b>glass</b> affordable for the masses.

His job is to report to SSSP of any events and is usually dwelling around the Alien City for informations from police informant Jack. He has a rather strained relationship with Shinjiro, doubted if the youth is fit enough to become an Ultraman. He also views Ultraman nothing more as an enforcer-like figure that instantly killed his opponents, which is not shared by the boy. Moroboshi later dons his own Ultraman Suit and revealed his alien heritage to Shinjiro when they pursue Seiji Hokuto. His name is in fact based on Dan Moroboshi from Ultra Seven.|$|E
25|$|Mirren says {{transforming}} {{herself into}} the Queen came almost naturally after the wig <b>and</b> <b>glasses,</b> since she shares a default facial expression‚Äîa slightly downturned mouth ‚Äì with the monarch. She regularly reviewed film and video footage of Elizabeth and kept photographs in her trailer during production. She also undertook extensive voice coaching, faithfully reproducing the Queen's delivery of her televised speech to the world. Morgan has said that her performance was so convincing that, {{by the end of}} production, crew members who had been accustomed to slouching or relaxing when they addressed her were standing straight up and respectfully folding their hands behind their backs. Mirren arranged to spend time off-camera with the supporting cast playing other members of the Royal Family, including James Cromwell, Alex Jennings and Sylvia Syms so they would be as comfortable with each other as a real family.|$|E
25|$|The {{incomes of}} the poorest {{sections}} of society were increased exponentially {{as a result of}} social security reforms and a 25% increase in the minimum wage. Allowances for the handicapped were also increased, while the right to deduct the cost of child care for all {{children under the age of}} three was introduced (a right later extended to include all children under the age of five in some cases). Unemployed workers ineligible for jobless benefits were given back the right to claim sickness insurance that they had lost in 1979 while the reimbursal of the costs of dental fees, hearing aids, <b>and</b> <b>glasses</b> was improved. An 80-franc-per-month charge that had been imposed on certain long-term illnesses was abrogated, and certain individuals who had retired before 1973 had the base upon which their pensions were calculated adjusted upward.
