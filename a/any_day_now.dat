In many cases, excessive consumption burdens societies with bulging landfills, declining fish stocks, and rising obesity levels. Meanwhile, there are still another 2. 8 billion who consume too little and who suffer from hunger, homelessness, and poverty. On the Worldwatch Institute's thirtieth anniversary, this special edition of State of the World examines how we consume, why we consume, and what impact our consumption choices have on the planet and our fellow human beings. From factory-farmed chicken to old-growth lumber to gas-guzzling cars, many of the things we buy support destructive industries. But businesses, governments, and concerned citizens can harness this same purchasing power to build markets for less-hazardous products, including fair-traded foods, green power, and fuel-cell vehicles. With chapters on food, water, energy, the politics of consumption, and redefining the good life, Worldwatch's award-winning research team asks whether a less-consumptive society is possible [...] and then argues that it is essential...|$|R

[...] Saying this, he seated himself on his own bed, and began a long narration. He would not go further West than Leavenworth. Whether he got his money or whether he lost it, he would not travel a foot further. There were reasons {{which would make it}} disagreeable for him to go into California. But he made a proposition. If Peacocke would only give him money enough to support himself for the {{necessary}} time, he would remain at Leavenworth till his companion should return there, or would make his way to Chicago, and stay there till Peacocke should come to him. Then he proceeded to explain how absolute evidence might be obtained at San Francisco as to his brother's death. [...] "That fellow was lying altogether," [...] he said, [...] "about my brother dying at the Ogden station. He was very bad there, no doubt, and we {{thought it was going to}} be all up with him. He had the horrors there, worse than I ever saw before, and I hope never to see the like again. But we did get him on to San Francisco; and when he was able to walk into the city on his own legs, I thought that, might be, he would rally and come round. However, in two days he died;--and we buried him in the big cemetery just out of the town." ...|$|R
6000|$|Martha, {{when she}} was thus asked {{directly}} for congratulation, hardly knew at once how to express herself. Being fully aware of Miss Stanbury's objection to the marriage, she could not venture to express her approbation of it. It was very improper, in Martha's mind, that any young woman should have a follower, when the [...] "missus" [...] didn't approve of it. She understood well enough that, in that matter of followers, privileges are allowed to young ladies which are not accorded to maid servants. A young lady may do things,--have young men to walk and talk with them, to dance with them and embrace them, and perhaps even more than this,--when for half so much a young woman would be turned into the streets without a character. Martha knew all this, and knew also that Miss Dorothy, though her mother lived in a very little cottage, was not altogether debarred, {{in the matter of}} followers, from the privileges of a lady. But yet Miss Dorothy's position was so very peculiar! Look at that will,--or, rather, at that embryo will, which might be made <b>any</b> <b>day,</b> which <b>now</b> probably would be made, and which might affect them both so terribly! People who have not got money should not fly in the face of those who have. Such at least was Martha's opinion very strongly. How could she congratulate Miss Dorothy under the existing circumstances? [...] "I do hope you will be happy, miss;--that you knows," [...] said Martha, in her difficulty. [...] "And now, ma'am;--miss, I mean," [...] she added, correcting herself, in obedience to Miss Stanbury's direct orders about the present,--"missus has just sent me over with a bit of lamb, and a letter as is here in the basket, and to ask how you is,--and the other ladies." ...|$|R
