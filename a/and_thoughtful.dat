Critics found {{the book to}} be rich in detail, realistic, <b>and</b> <b>thoughtful.</b> The Years of Rice and Salt won the Locus Award for Best Science Fiction Novel in 2003. In the same year it was nominated for the Arthur C. Clarke Award, a Hugo Award, and a British Science Fiction Award.|$|E
5|$|Though he {{was very}} close to his younger sister, Princess Helen, Alexander was less warm towards his elder brother George, with whom he had little in common. While his elder brother was a serious <b>and</b> <b>thoughtful</b> child, Alexander was mischievous and extroverted; he smoked {{cigarettes}} made from blotting paper, set fire to the games room in the palace, and recklessly lost control of a toy cart in which he and his younger brother Paul were rolling down a hill, tipping his toddler brother a distance of six feet into brambles.|$|E
5|$|Born into an upper-middle-class family, Van Gogh drew as a {{child and}} was serious, quiet <b>and</b> <b>thoughtful.</b> As a young man he worked as an art dealer, often travelling, but became {{depressed}} after he was transferred to London. He turned to religion, and spent time as a Protestant missionary in southern Belgium. He drifted in ill health and solitude before taking up painting in 1881, having moved back home with his parents. His younger brother Theo supported him financially, and the two kept up a long correspondence by letter. His early works, mostly still lifes and depictions of peasant labourers, contain few signs of the vivid colour that distinguished his later work. In 1886, he moved to Paris, where he met members of the avant-garde, including Émile Bernard and Paul Gauguin, who were reacting against the Impressionist sensibility. As his work developed he created a new approach to still lifes and local landscapes. His paintings grew brighter in colour as he developed a style that became fully realised during his stay in Arles in the south of France in 1888. During this period he broadened his subject matter to include series of olive trees, wheat fields and sunflowers.|$|E

25|$|His portraits {{were more}} subdued <b>and</b> <b>thoughtful,</b> {{such as his}} portraits of Charles V and Margarete of Austria. He usually {{represents}} his subjects in a seated static position, their expressionless faces without much psychological depth or feelings. His workshop produced several copies of these portraits, especially the portrait of Charles V. They were offered as gift to visitors or courtiers.|$|E
25|$|In 1977, Bogarde {{embarked}} {{on his second}} career as an author. Starting with a first volume A Postillion Struck by Lightning (an allusion to the phrase My postillion has been struck by lightning), he wrote a series of 15 best-selling memoirs, novels, essays, reviews, poetry and collected journalism. As a writer Bogarde displayed a witty, elegant, highly literate <b>and</b> <b>thoughtful</b> style.|$|E

25|$|In any case, the digressions {{are each}} readerly tests; each tests {{whether or not}} the reader is {{intelligent}} and sceptical enough to detect nonsense. Some, such as the discussion of ears or of wisdom being like a nut, a cream sherry, a cackling hen, etc., are outlandish and require a militantly aware <b>and</b> <b>thoughtful</b> reader. Each is a trick, and together they train the reader to sniff out bunk and to reject the unacceptable.|$|E
25|$|Economically, Sayeed was on {{the right}} of the Conservative party, {{opposing}} British entry into the single European currency. He had strong views on defence.

25|$|On 29 September 1841, Kierkegaard {{wrote and}} defended his dissertation, On the Concept of Irony with Continual Reference to Socrates. The {{university}} panel considered it noteworthy <b>and</b> <b>thoughtful,</b> but too informal and witty {{for a serious}} academic thesis. The thesis dealt with irony and Schelling's 1841 lectures, which Kierkegaard had attended with Mikhail Bakunin, Jacob Burckhardt, and Friedrich Engels; each had come away with a different perspective. Kierkegaard graduated from university on 20 October 1841 with a Magister Artium. He was able to fund his education, his living, and several publications of his early works with his family's inheritance of approximately 31,000 rigsdaler.|$|E

25|$|Ideal Motherhood (T. Y. Crowell & Co., New York and Boston) was {{reviewed}} by The Arena who stated, to read Ideal Motherhood means an upliftment of soul, a keener appreciation of woman's highest privilege. While presenting an ideal, the author does not carry it {{beyond the pale}} of the practical; she believes in the necessity of combining the masculine and feminine elements, the developed intellect and intuition, as commensurate factors in shaping the young life. The review in The School Journal goes on to say, that Davis makes some very practical suggestions regarding motherhood, the responsibility entailed thereby, and the necessity for careful <b>and</b> <b>thoughtful</b> preparation for the duties encumbent upon parents.|$|E
25|$|Florence Nightingale {{pioneered the}} modern {{profession}} of nursing during the Crimean War when she {{set an example}} of compassion, commitment to patient care and diligent <b>and</b> <b>thoughtful</b> hospital administration. The first official nurses' training programme, the Nightingale School for Nurses, was opened in 1860, with the mission of training nurses to work in hospitals, {{to work with the}} poor and to teach. Nightingale was instrumental in reforming the nature of the hospital, by improving sanitation standards and changing the image of the hospital from a place the sick would go to die, to an institution devoted to recuperation and healing. She also emphasised the importance of statistical measurement for determining the success rate of a given intervention and pushed for administrative reform at hospitals.|$|E

I’m sorry to say that I was among the revellers and all I saw were black on black skins what a shame. I do know some wonderful <b>and</b> <b>thoughtful</b> black people. This lot of monkeys just don’t want to even try. But think they can voice opinions about statute and get their way oh dear.

25|$|The news of {{the battle}} reached France much faster than Jones did, and the Americans were welcomed as heroes. As for the British, they had learned their lesson well—the Royal Navy could not defend British shipping, nor British coasts, nor even its own {{fighting}} vessels against American raiders. Militia regiments were hastily redeployed to coastal areas; seaports equipped themselves with artillery to defend themselves against further raids; and the gentry banded together in volunteer battalions as a last line of defence. Thenceforward, the press paid very close attention to every move John Paul Jones made; struggling to reconcile the malicious rumours of his murders and piracy with the evidence of his chivalrous and far from bloodthirsty behaviour on the Ranger mission (back in France, he wrote kind <b>and</b> <b>thoughtful</b> letters to the Earl of Selkirk, and {{to the family of}} Lieut. Dobbs, who had died within a couple of days).|$|E
25|$|Her {{mother died}} in 1838 and she took up much of the {{domestic}} chores {{as a result of}} this while an elder sister and teacher taught her to read and write as well as to sing and use the guitar; she also learned how to sew and cook. The girl also turned a small room in her house as a domestic chapel. Martillo had a clear perception of her call to saintliness as a child and received her Confirmation on 16 September 1839. Martillo frequented a small wood near her home for contemplation in solitude while the guava tree near which she went to is now a large pilgrimage destination. The girl also chose the then-Blessed Mariana de Jesús as her patron with whom she identified and strived to imitate in her own life. Martillo was known for being sweet <b>and</b> <b>thoughtful</b> with a peaceful and generous disposition; she was obedient to those around her and was well-known and loved in her village. Martillo was blonde with bright blue eyes and was strong and agile; she was also tall.|$|E
25|$|Midna has {{received}} mostly positive reception {{from both the}} video game press and the public {{for her role in}} Twilight Princess. Game Informer editor Andrew Reiner stated that she, along with Link's wolf transformation, had incredible effects on Twilight Princess gameplay. Fellow Game Informer editor Billy Berghammer stated that he loved Midna, describing her as a cool character due to how she messed with Link throughout the game. 1UP.com editor Jeremy Parish stated that the supporting characters of Twilight Princess make up for Link's laconic nature, Midna more so than others. He described her as being acerbic <b>and</b> <b>thoughtful,</b> as well as an intricate character who moves the plot forward for her own means. While America's Intelligence Wire editor Dave Arey described her as intriguing, he felt that she could have been more so if Nintendo had developed her further. GamesRadar listed her as one of the 25 best new characters of the decade, stating that before Midna, the only characters they could relate to were Link, Princess Zelda, and Ganon. RPGamer editor Matthew Rickert stated that he found nothing intriguing or likable about her, complaining about how much more plot time she receives in spite of this, arguing that she offers little help to Link and that it felt like she had replaced Zelda in Twilight Princess.|$|E
