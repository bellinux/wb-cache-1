5|$|Woody {{returns to}} Sunnyside and learns from a Chatter Telephone toy {{that there is}} only one way out of the daycare: the trash. Woody and Andy's other toys execute their plan, but accidentally reset Buzz to Spanish mode instead of his old persona. Buzz {{promptly}} allies himself with Woody and falls in love with Jessie. The toys reach a dumpster, but are cornered by Lotso and his gang. As a garbage truck approaches, Woody reveals what he learned about Lotso and shows proof of Daisy's ownership tag, which Chuckles had kept, to Big Baby. Lotso destroys the tag and says that toys are meant to be discarded, but an enraged Big Baby throws Lotso into the dumpster. As the toys try to leave, Lotso pulls Woody into the dumpster just <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>truck</b> collects the trash. The rest of Andy's toys fall into the back of the truck while trying to rescue him, and a falling television lands on Buzz, restoring his memory and normal personality. The truck deposits the toys at a landfill, where they find themselves on a conveyor belt, leading to an incinerator. Woody and Buzz help Lotso reach an emergency stop button, only for Lotso to abandon them and escape. The toys resign themselves to their fate, but are soon rescued by the Aliens operating an industrial claw. Lotso is found by a garbage truck driver, who straps him to his truck's radiator grill, and drives away. Woody and the other toys board another garbage truck back to Andy's house.|$|E

The Vultures arrive driving their flightless cargo plane, which scoops up the truck along with Ben, Maureen, and Ben's bike. The plane and truck wind up hanging precariously {{over the edge}} of Poyahoga Gorge, and Ripburger falls to his death. Maureen and the Vultures flee the plane while Ben makes it out at the last second by jumping his bike out the back cargo door just <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>truck</b> explodes and it and the plane fall into the gorge. Members of the biker gangs attend Malcolm's funeral, at which Father Torque delivers a eulogy. Maureen takes over Corley Motors, and Ben rides away into the sunset.|$|E
500|$|For {{the scene}} in which the Doctor, Amy, and River are riding on horses, the close-ups of the {{characters}} riding were filmed by having the actors sit on a saddle mounted {{on the back of}} a truck and act like they were riding horses. Gillan called this the [...] "strangest thing" [...] she had ever done, and was sure she [...] "looked ridiculous". They were filmed performing this <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>truck</b> drove to achieve the effect of the passing country. Wide shots were taken of stunt doubles of the three actors riding real horses. This scene was filmed on 1 February 2010.|$|E

500|$|For {{the filming}} of the actual crash, the car and truck were cabled {{together}} by a winch and driven toward one another. The intention was for a cannon to launch the Impala into the air at the collision point, causing the car to barrel roll <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>truck</b> drives away. However, the car became stuck in the truck's bumper, forcing the cannon to fail and the truck {{to go out of}} control.

Other cameo appearances include Sumela Kay as Kitty Pryde, Katrina Florece as Jubilee, Donald MacKinnon as a young Colossus sketching a picture in one scene, and Alexander Burton as Pyro. Gambit was considered {{for one of the}} students at the X-Mansion. Singer remembered, [...] "We thought about Gambit as the young boy on the basketball field, but the feeling was that if he has the basketball and then releases it and it exploded, [...] people would be like 'What's wrong with those basketballs?'" [...] Kevin Feige had a cameo as a Weapon X tech, but his scenes did not make the final cut of the film.|$|E
500|$|U.S. Route 1/9 (US 1/9) is the [...] long {{concurrency}} of US 1 and US 9 {{from their}} junction in Woodbridge Township, Middlesex County, New Jersey north to New York City. The route is a multilane road, with some freeway portions, {{that runs through}} urbanized areas of northern New Jersey adjacent to New York City. Throughout most of its length in New Jersey, the road runs near the New Jersey Turnpike/Interstate 95 (I-95). In Fort Lee, US 1/9 merges onto I-95 and crosses the Hudson River on the George Washington Bridge, where the two U.S. routes split a short distance into New York. US 1/9 intersects several major roads, including I-278 in Linden, Route 81 in Elizabeth, I-78 and US 22 in Newark, Route 139 in Jersey City, Route 3 and Route 495 in North Bergen, and US 46 in Palisades Park. Between Newark and Jersey City, US 1/9 runs along the Pulaski Skyway. Trucks are banned from this section of road and must use US 1/9 Truck. The concurrency between US 1 and US 9 is {{commonly referred to as}} [...] "1 and 9". Some signage for the concurrency, as well <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>truck</b> route, combines the two roads into one shield, separated by a hyphen (1-9) or an ampersand (1&9).|$|E

5000|$|The {{students}} {{first meet}} at the Grand Sablon Square, and after several hours, <b>the</b> <b>trucks</b> start to move towards the Brussels Stock Exchange on Boulevard Anspach.

500|$|Throughout filming, various scenes {{make use}} of all three effects departments. For scenes {{involving}} the floating, fiery spirit of Mary Winchester in [...] "Home", a small and slim stuntman wearing a fire suit was lit on fire and raised into the air on wires. For the spirit's transition into Mary's normal form, Smith {{stood in front of}} a black background with wind blowing onto her, and the two scenes were later combined in post-production. Many aspects went into filming the crash scene in the season finale [...] "Devil's Trap". For the interior scenes used in the first moments of the Impala being hit, Jeffrey Dean Morgan, Padalecki, and Ackles were required to sit in the car, which was in front of a blue screen. A sheet of Lexan placed very close to the passenger-side window protected the actors as the window was shattered, and at the same time, cannons beneath the frame blew out pieces of rubber glass to give the appearance that the window exploded onto them. For scenes of the actual crash, the car and truck were cabled together by a winch, and driven toward one another.

2500|$|The Mason Bogie was still, though, {{plagued by}} one of the biggest {{problems}} of the Fairlie - the jointed steam pipes to the driven truck leaked far too much steam. Mason eventually changed to a different scheme, in which the pivot point for the leading truck became a hollow ball joint through which the live steam for the cylinders passed. [...] Mason also developed a sliding seal for the exhaust from the moving cylinder saddle into the smoke box. Although better, Mason's improvements took up much valuable space in between the driving wheels, forcing Mason to use an outside valve gear, generally the Walschaerts valve gear. Additionally, the reversing shaft had to be mounted atop the boiler, with a long lifting link dropping down to the radius rod, a feature unique to Mason Bogies (this was necessary because the lifting link would swing to the side <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>truck</b> pivoted, lifting the radius rod and changing the valve setting. [...] Lengthening the link, and thus increasing the radius of its swing, minimized the amount of change.).|$|E

2500|$|In {{the days}} that {{followed}} Meredith chose to move further south where the birds were [...] "reported to be fairly tame", but there was only limited success in spite of his efforts. By the fourth day of the campaign, army observers noted that [...] "each pack seems to have its own leader now - a big black-plumed bird which stands fully six feet high and keeps watch while his mates carry out their work of destruction and warns them of our approach." [...] At one stage Meredith {{even went so far as}} to mount one of the guns on a truck: a move that proved to be ineffective, <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>truck</b> was unable to gain on the birds, and the ride was so rough that the gunner was unable to fire any shots. By 8 November, six days after the first engagement, 2,500 rounds of ammunition had been fired. The number of birds killed is uncertain: one account claims just 50 birds, but other accounts range from 200 to 500—the latter figure being provided by the settlers. Meredith's official report noted that his men had suffered no casualties.|$|E

60|$|As {{she glanced}} at the track she noted that room for it had been dug out of the hillside, which was seamed by gullies that the rails twisted round. The loose soil, {{consisting}} largely of volcanic cinders, appeared to offer a very unsafe support. It had slipped away here and there, leaving gaps between the ties, which were unevenly laid and at the sharper bends overhung the steep slope below. In the meantime, the small locomotive came nearer, panting loudly and throwing up showers of sparks, and Ida remarked how the rails bent and then sprang up again <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>truck,</b> which carried two ponderous blocks of stone, rolled over them.
