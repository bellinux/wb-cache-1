40|$|Measurements of {{the basic}} {{properties}} of amorphous selenium films relevant to xerographic use were carried out using special apparatus built in the laboratory. The samples for study were prepared in the laboratory and consisted, in each case, of an aluminum plate on which a thin oxide film was formed, followed by the deposition of a 50 micrometer layer of amorphous selenium by evaporation at a substrate temperature near 50 $ sp circ$C. The free selenium surface {{of the sample was}} then charged to a positive or negative potential from a corona discharge and the <b>acceptance</b> <b>voltage</b> and voltage decay rate in darkness and the residual voltage after illumination were measured. The effect on these quantities of varying the selenium layer thickness, its deposition temperature and deposition rate was determined along with the effect of using selenium containing different concentrations of chlorine. The results point to a dark decay process controlled by injection of carriers from the substrate for undoped selenium and controlled by charge depletion resulting from the emission of carriers from discrete centres in chlorine-doped selenium...|$|E
40|$|A {{study has}} been made of the xerographic {{properties}} of amorphous selenium doped with chlorine at concentrations below 100 parts per million (ppm) by weight. The sample consisted, in each case, of an aluminum plate with a thin deposited r. f. sputtered aluminum oxide film, on which a 50 micrometer layer of amorphous selenium was deposited by evaporation, with a substrate temperature of 50 $ sp circ$C. It was found that the chlorine decreased the <b>acceptance</b> <b>voltage</b> following corona charging, increased the dark decay rate and decreased the residual voltage after illumination discharge. The changes were such as to be beneficial xerographically for small additions of chlorine to the selenium in the ppm range. Analysis of the time derivative of the dark decay voltage indicated that depletion discharge was the dominant process in the decrease of dark decay voltage with time and a modified relation was introduced to describe the increase of bulk space charge density with time, arising from thermal excitation of holes from deep discrete centres in the photoreceptor. This analysis indicated a decrease of the release time of the holes with increase of chlorine content, whereas an observed decrease of single cycle and cycled-up residual voltages with increased chlorine indicated an increase of hole capture time from their relevant trapping centres. Capacitance and incremental resistance measurements on the aluminum oxide blocking layers indicated higher resistance in films deposited by r. f. sputtering than by d. c. reactive sputtering on aluminum substrates. However, no difference in xerographic performance could be detected between the two sputtering methods. Oxide layers were also deposited on nickel and gold substrates by r. f. sputtering...|$|E

40|$|The {{applicability}} of superconducting TEM-class spoke cavities to high-energy ion linacs is discussed, and detailed designs for two TEM-class, triple-spoke-loaded superconducting niobium resonant cavities are presented. The 345  MHz cavities have a velocity range of 0. 4 <β< 0. 75 and a beam aperture of 4  cm. Spoke-loaded cavities offer several advantages {{compared with the}} higher-frequency elliptical-cell cavities that are currently being developed for this range of particle velocities. The proposed triple-spoke cavities can provide broader velocity <b>acceptance,</b> more accelerating <b>voltage</b> per cavity, reduced heat-load operation at 4. 2  K, and increased longitudinal acceptance through the high-energy section. Application to the proposed U. S. rare-isotope accelerator driver linac is discussed in detail...|$|R
40|$|Diesel {{generation}} is used worldwide to provide prime power or {{as a backup}} should the mains electricity supply be lost. This thesis presents {{a model of a}} diesel generating set (gen-set) to simulate its behaviour following a sudden application of load. Load acceptance is of particular interest in standby applications where the site load is connected through a breaker to an unloaded gen-set, The quality of a gen-set's voltage and frequency are of the most concern when supplying a load. During large load <b>acceptances,</b> transient <b>voltage</b> and frequency deviations can be so large that lights will extinguish, contactors drop out, and permanent damage can occur to sensitive electronics. In extreme cases the load can cause the engine to stall. The increasing desire to predict the magnitude of these deviations from nominal values has identified the need to have an accurate gen-set model. The model presented in this thesis was developed in order that the voltage and frequency transients could be recreated and examined in the simulation environment. There is considerable detail included, with models of the engine, governor, synchronous machine and voltage regulator, and many of their component parts. The control signals and other interaction are also included, so that the gen-set's behaviour during load acceptance can be analysed. The gen-set model has been extensively validated against plant measurements under a number of test scenarios and is shown to remain accurate. The model has also been used to predict a number of potential performance enhancements which could be implemented on the gen-set in the future.

40|$|A new {{computer-controlled}} {{test system}} for mapping photoreceptor properties such as charge <b>acceptance</b> and discharge <b>voltage</b> will be described. The system allows rapid scanning of a photoreceptor to: 1) characterize its functional quality and uniformity, and 2) detect both charging and discharge defects of 50 - 100 µm in diameter or larger. The system can also perform conventional electrophotographic measurements to obtain dark decay, photo-induced discharge curves (PIDC), and fatigue properties. In addition to testing the complete photoreceptor product, a unique {{feature of the}} system is its ability to perform measurements on the sub-layers in a photoreceptor. These measurements include examining the substrate for cleanliness, and measuring the thickness and uniformity of the polymer barrier layer and the charge generation layer (CGL) in a layered organic photoconductor (OPC). The design of the system will be described, and its performance will be demonstrated with application examples. Test equipment for the charge roller and the magnetic roller in toner cartridges using similar electrostatic charge decay measurement techniques will also be discussed...|$|R
