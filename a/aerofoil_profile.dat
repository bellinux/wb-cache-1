The PIV and ROVLM data show qualitative agreement in terms of the shape of the wake boundary, including downstream wake contraction, and quantitative agreement in terms of the tip vortex pitch.

40|$|The use of {{oscillating}} flexible fins in propulsion {{has been}} the subject of several studies in recent years, but attention is rarely paid to the specific role of stiffness profile in thrust production. Stiffness profile is defined as the variation in local chordwise bending stiffness (EI) of a fin, from leading to trailing edge. In this study, flexible fins with a standard NACA 0012 shape were tested alongside fins with a stiffness profile mimicking that of a Pumpkinseed Sunfish (Lepomis gibbosus). The fins were oscillated with a pitching sinusoidal motion over a range of frequencies and amplitudes, while torque, lateral force and static thrust were measured. Over the range of oscillation parameters tested, it was shown that the fin with a biomimetic stiffness profile offered a significant improvement in static thrust, compared to a fin of similar dimensions with a standard NACA 0012 <b>aerofoil</b> <b>profile.</b> The biomimetic fin also produced thrust more consistently over each oscillation cycle. A comparison of fin materials of different stiffness showed that the improvement was due to the stiffness profile itself, and was not simply an effect of altering the overall stiffness of the fin. Fins of the same stiffness profile were observed to follow the same thrust-power curve, independent of the stiffness of the moulding material. Biomimetic fins were shown to produce up to 26 % greater thrust per watt of input power, within the experimental range...|$|E

The use of Computational Fluids Dynamics (CFD) has accelerated aerodynamic analysis of BWB aircraft.

Comparisons of aerodynamic characteristics such as lift coefficient, drag coefficient, pitching moment coefficient, pressure contours and Mach number contours were made both of two-dimensional aerofoil sections in the BWB model and a complete three-dimensional model.

Of particular interest is the interference effect whereby the lift and drag data of a blade in a rotor, or cascade, is different from that of a single, isolated aerofoil. The interference effect is important when blade-element methods are used to determine the performance of air turbines, particularly for optimal sizing of the turbine during design stages.

40|$|Abstract: This article {{presents}} {{a study of}} the effects of wing sweep on the aerodynamic performance of a blended wing body (BWB) aircraft that is based on an aerodynamically optimized design with a fixed planform and pitching moment constraint. Sixteen BWB geome-tries with varying wing sweep angles ranging from 2408 (forward sweep) to 558 sweep were evaluated, while keeping the <b>aerofoil</b> <b>profiles</b> and twist distribution unchanged from the original optimized geometry. This gives some insight into the effects of one of the key planform design parameters. Numerical simulations were carried out using Euler solutions of the flow field with adaptive unstructured grids. Grid sensitivity studies were carried out, along with grid adaptation, on all geometries for solution accuracy. Results show that within 108 – 558 sweep, there is significant variation in the lift-to-drag ratio (L/D), whereas for sweep values from 2408 to 108, the L/D ratio remained relatively constant. To maintain the design lift for varying wing sweep, the angle of attack of the aircraft needs to be changed. It was found that this variation followed an approximately parabolic curve, with a minimum incidence of 4. 918 at 258 wing sweep. Furthermore, it was seen that the coefficient of moments versus the sweep angle varied almost linearly for all geometries under investigation...|$|R
40|$|An {{explicit}} moving boundary {{method for}} the numerical solution of time-dependent hyperbolic conservation laws on grids {{produced by the}} intersection of complex geometries with a regular Cartesian grid is presented. As it employs directional operator splitting, implementation of the scheme is rather straightforward. Extending the method for static walls from Klein et al., Phil. Trans. Roy. Soc., A 367, no. 1907, 4559 - 4575 (2009), the scheme calculates fluxes needed for a conservative update of the near-wall cut-cells as linear combinations of standard fluxes from a one-dimensional extended stencil. Here the standard fluxes are those obtained {{without regard to the}} small sub-cell problem, and the linear combination weights involve detailed information regarding the cut-cell geometry. This linear combination of standard fluxes stabilizes the updates such that the time-step yielding marginal stability for arbitrarily small cut-cells is of the same order as that for regular cells. Moreover, it renders the approach compatible {{with a wide range of}} existing numerical flux-approximation methods. The scheme is extended here to time dependent rigid boundaries by reformulating the linear combination weights of the stabilizing flux stencil to account for the time dependence of cut-cell volume and interface area fractions. The two-dimensional tests discussed include advection in a channel oriented at an oblique angle to the Cartesian computational mesh, cylinders with circular and triangular cross-section passing through a stationary shock wave, a piston moving through an open-ended shock tube, and the flow around an oscillating NACA 0012 <b>aerofoil</b> <b>profile.</b> Comment: 29 pages, 27 figures, 3 table...|$|E
40|$|Atmospheric icing {{presents}} serious {{challenges to}} the development of wind power of the wind energy industry in cold regions. The potential detrimental impact on the safe operation of wind turbines and the energy harvest hasn???t been fully understood and requires further investigation. This thesis presents the research on icing profiles under different weather conditions and their impact on natural frequency, fatigue life, and lift and drag of the wind turbine blade. The research aims to develop a further understanding of the effect of atmospheric ice accretion on the structural integrity and aerodynamic performance of wind turbine blades through numerical and aerodynamic investigations to address the challenges facing the industry. A 5 -MW NREL (National Renewable Energy Laboratory) wind turbine blade was selected for this study, due to availability of required geometric design parameters and experimental data for verification. The turbine rotor and its three blades were modelled and numerically simulated with commercial finite element software ANSYS. Three icing scenarios were chosen according to the ISO Standard and the corresponding icing profiles were developed to investigate their influence on vibrational behaviours of the wind turbine blade and rotor under different weather conditions. Icing loads were applied on {{the leading edge of the}} blade and natural frequency results were compared between clean and iced blades. It was found that harsh icing weather drove the natural frequency down to the near resonance limit, which could lead to significant issue on structural integrity of the wind turbine. The effect of atmospheric ice accretion with additional load due to varying wind speeds on the fatigue life of the wind turbine blade has been investigated. Significant reduction of fatigue life was found due to the increase of the von Mises stresses. Finally, computational fluid dynamics (CFD) analysis was carried out to investigate the effect of atmospheric ice accretion on the aerodynamic performance of typical 1 -MW and 5 -MW wind turbine blades. Results of the drag and lift coefficients and power production under different icing scenarios were obtained for five angles of attack. Compared with the results of the clean <b>aerofoil</b> <b>profile,</b> remarkable reduction in the power generation was observed due to the accreted ice at various aerofoil sections in the spanwise direction of the blade, demonstrating the detrimental impact of atmospheric icing on energy harvest for the wind energy industry...|$|E
40|$|Dihedral {{generally}} {{has only a}} small effect on cross-passage flow. Although positive dihedral reduces the cross-passage pres-sure gradient, the net effect on cross-passage flow can be small, because positive dihedral also reduces the throughflow velocity near the wall. This {{can be seen in}} Fig. 11, where the "twist" of the loss contours near the endwall (a measure of the cross-passage flow) for the blade with dihedral {{is similar to that of}} the straight blade. (In fact, the twist is slightly greater for the DHP blade, which is probably a result of the aft sweep produced by the tangential lean.) These arguments about sweep and dihedral are based on the lifting-line vortex model, which is an oversimplification. In the first place, the use of a single bound vortex is a poor representa-tion of blades that are long in the chordwise sense compared with the thickness of the endwall boundary layer or the spanwise extent of dihedral or sweep. Furthermore, the effect of stacking-line geometry changes on the pressure distribution of the blades is not as assumed above, but the suction and the pressure peaks move less than the blade sections move. Most obviously in the case of sweep, the isobars tend to remain comparatively straight across the span, so the blade sections tend to move relative to the isobars. A proper treatment requires full three-dimensional calculation methods, and arguments such as these that consider a bound vortex are intended only to give a plausible explanation rather than a complete description. One can, however, use such the simplified methods to recognize that the low loss of the forward-swept blade is not due to the vortex observed in the forward part of the passage, but to the bound vorticity inducing velocities that oppose the classical secondary flow. It should also be noted that an <b>aerofoil</b> <b>profile</b> section (such as the NACA series), which is an optimum in a two-dimen-sional flow, will not form the optimum in a three-dimensional flow, or one where lean and sweep has been introduced. The appropriate blades will have their profile (camber, stagger, and thickness distributions) tailored to the flow and geometry. There are two further points that the authors may be able to deal with before the paper is published in the ASME JOURNAL OF TURBOMACHINERY. There is some confusion in our mind...|$|E

40|$|A {{practical}} Vertical Axis Wind Turbine (VAWTs) {{based on}} a Darrieus rotor has been designed and tested and found {{to be capable of}} self-starting at wind speeds above 4 m/s. The self-start feature has been achieved by replacing the usual symmetrical aerofoil blade in the VAWT rotor and by using a concentric Savonius rotor or semi-cylinder turbine. A computer program was produced to compute the power coefficient versus tip speed ratio characteristics of a selected <b>aerofoil</b> <b>profile</b> employed in a VAWT. The program accounts for chord length, pitch angle, number of blades, and rotor radius at any wind speed. The published data from 40 aerofoil sections were assessed, taking into account the two main criteria — self-starting and efficiency. Computational fluid dynamics software (ANSYS, Flotran) has been used to investigate the lift and drag performance of a NACA 66 - 212 and NACA 4421 aerofoils in order to check the computer program predictions. Excellent agreement was obtained for the static aerofoil assessment, but only after special ICEM Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) meshing interface routines were utilised. However, agreement between the theoretical and published results was not good for the rotating aerofoils in a VAWT. Thus, further CFD work was not pursued and in preference, an experimental route was initiated. In the first series of wind tunnel tests involving three candidate profiles, good agreement was found between the experimental results and the mathematical models. The aerofoils chosen were the NACA 661 - 212, the 51223 and the Clark-Y standard aerofoils. A number of prototype VAWTs were fabricated and tested for the influence of the blade pitch angle, the chord length ratio, with 2 or 3 blades. The aerofoil surfaces were made from aluminium sheet with a standard surface finish. The prototype designs were tested in the Northumbria University low speed wind tunnel facility - the models were 0. 4 m. high with a 0. 4 m diameter. The torque versus wind speed characteristics were recorded and analysed. The S 1223 profile was found to be self-starting with high efficiency. This model generated a high power coefficient of about 0. 3 at a tip speed ratio of 1. 2. The second series of tests were carried out in field sites in the UK with a 2 m diameter straight—bladed Darrieus rotor prototype with 3 blades using the S 1223 blade section. Three field trials were undertaken in the UK to produce realistic performance characteristics for wind conditions of 4 - 10 m/s. The maximum power coefficient of this machine was found to be 0. 18 at a tip speed ratio of 1. 2. In addition, an alternative semi-cylinder turbine combined with a Darrieus rotor was fabricated and tested in the UK. It demonstrated the advantage that it could self-start at lower wind speeds, that is 3 m/s but delivers approximately 50 % less power than that obtained from the first proposed design. A final phase of testing was carried out with an enlarged and modified 3 m diameter prototype installed at a shrimp farm in Thailand to demonstrate how the unit could be used to replace an equivalent 2 HP 2 -stroke diesel engine and hence eliminate its inherent emission pollution problems. A Savonius rotor was fitted to the prototype to improve self-start capabilities at a wind speed of 4 m/s for a practical application which by its nature required a high starting torque. The designs are easy to fabricate, low cost, pollution free and have been demonstrated to be ideal for applications in developing countries where there are sufficient wind resources.

40|$|In {{order to}} provide a correct {{aerodynamic}} simulation of a vehicle travelling along the ground, models are tested using rotating wheels in a wind tunnel with a moving ground. In {{the most common of}} moving ground configurations the model is supported by an overhead strut, usually designed as an <b>aerofoil</b> <b>profile</b> to minimise interference, with the wheels supported by lateral stings hinged to mounts outside the span of the moving ground plane. ๒ using this type of configuration it is assumed that the presence of the intruding supports do not markedly affect the aerodynamic behaviour of the model, but this assumption is not always valid. In order to quantify interference effects from model supports, a range of models were tested over a stationary ground plane mounted to an under floor balance. Each model was tested with and without mock struts and stings, which do not actually support the model. Comparisons were made between configurations with and without the mock supports in order to quantify their aerodynamic effects and investigate any changes in flow structure. Force and moment measurements show significant effects on both drag (up to 25 counts / 7 % of total drag) and lift (up to 170 counts) due to a vertical strut for all vehicle types. Motor Sport models, whose performance relies greatly on the underside flow, are largely affected (26 counts / 3 % on drag and up to 250 counts on lift) by the presence of lateral stings. Passenger vehicle models with larger ride heights were not as sensitive to the use of stings. Further investigation into the flow mechanisms that create these effects were carried out in the form of pressure and velocity measurements in the model and support wakes, surface oil flow visualisations, and surface static pressure readings. Results showed that the strut wake impinged on the rear wings of the motor sport vehicle models and the backlight of the passenger vehicle models as expected, but its influence was more wide ranging than this, extending to the model under floor. To explore changes in flow structure local to the strut-model junction, the junction is simplified as an aerofoil intersecting a flat plate and modelled in Fluent. Comparisons were made between configurations with and without the presence of six different aerofoil profiles for four different boundary layer thicknesses. Results found a noticeable interference on the plate from the union of the aerofoil, but showed that when the magnitude of the interference effect was recalculated using model frontal area the portion of the interference local to the junction affecting the model was small and in some cases insignificant. It was determined that deficiencies {{in the wake of the}} supports and their complex interference flow fields were creating a much greater amount of the overall effect by interfering with vehicle features downstream. Due to the complexity of interactions between struts, stings, and the model, the effect of combining them for a common moving ground configuration was highly vehicle dependent, precluding the possibility of developing a reliable correction for interference effects. The results do, however, lead to suggestions for support-model coupling methods that minimise the magnitude of the effect and offer guidelines for the expected magnitudes of effects for the different vehicle types and struts tested.

40|$|This study {{deals with}} {{generating}} aerodynamic indicial-admittance functions for predicting the unsteady lift of two-dimensional aerofoils in subsonic flow, using approximate numerical and analytical formulations. Both a step-change in {{the angle of}} attack and a sharp-edge gust are suitably considered as small perturbations. Novel contributions concern both a systematic analysis of the computational simulations process and an effective theoretical synthesis of its outcome, providing with sound cross-validation. Good practice for generating the indicial-admittance functions via computational fluid dynamics is first investigated for several Mach numbers, angles of attack and <b>aerofoil</b> <b>profiles.</b> Convenient analytical approximations of such indicial functions are then obtained by generalising those available for incompressible flow, taking advantage of acoustic wave theory for the non-circulatory airload and Prandtl-Glauert's scalability rule for the circulatory airload. An explicit parametric formula is newly proposed for modelling the latter as function of the Mach number {{in the absence of}} shock waves, while damped harmonic terms are effectively introduced for better approximating the former. Appropriate tuning of the analytical expressions is also derived in order to mimic the numerical solutions and successfully verify the rigor of superposing circulatory and non-circulatory theoretical contributions in the light of computational fluid dynamics. Results are finally shown and critically addressed with respect to the physical and mathematical assumptions employed, within a consistent framework. Comment: 42 pages, 22 Figure...|$|R

In particular, the combination of generative rapid prototyping technologies (LLM, SLS) and their subsequent processes (vacuum and investment casting) with active materials such as piezoelectric or piezostrictive materials is opening completely new prospects for meeting these complex demands. Sensor functions integrated in their structure enable intelligent components to detect, analyze and subsequently actively regulate changes in ambient conditions such as pressure and temperature distribution or oscillations and deformations.

Mi leage and performance can be improved by using an intelligent environment consisting of sensors and actors to design the geometry {{in such a way}} that negative lift ratios on a vehicle are already the best possible in the prototype phase. The influence of the flow characteristics of aerodynamically relevant vehicle as semblies increases as speed increases. Their impact on vehicle stability and the requisite energy input is considerable. Especially in race cars, these problems attract intense interest since classic aerodynamic designs of <b>aerofoil</b> <b>profiles</b> always represent a compromise of the most important requirements of various design criteria and the aerodynamic potential achievable has been largely exhausted. Significant advances in determining the best ratios between negative lift and drag are promised by actively controlling the flow around an aerofoil by continuously adapting it to current inflow conditions.

It is widely recognisedt hat for small stand-aloneb attery chargingw ind-turbines, below lOkW in rated power, the issue of regulating the rotor speed {{is one that has}} not been resolved definitively, especially with regard to the runaway condition. Current methods of regulation work, but are prone to problems. It is desirable to find methods of regulation with reduced mechanical complexity. Building on earlier work at Reading University, a method of blade construction is examined which involves asymmetric lay-up of fibre-composite materials. This may be done in a manner which causes the blade to twist in response to centrifugal loads and thus the rotor speed of the turbine. There is a need to optimise the blade design to exploit this effect to the full. The equations describing the blade twist are developed and expresseds imply and explicitly in terms of blade shaped esignp arameters. Along with an established aerodynamic model, a system is developed for examining the expected steady state behaviour {{of a wide range of}} rotors of this type in order to find the most appropriate configuration. A range of existing <b>aerofoil</b> <b>profiles</b> is also examined in order to select the most appropriate choice and a shortlist of these is modelled numerically in 2 D negative incident flow using an established model. In recognition of the inevitable flexibility of self-twisting designs of blade, a start is made on dynamic modelling of the rotor. A Rayleigh-Ritz approach is used in order to find both static blade deflections under loading and the blade's natural modal frequencies and shapes. A prototype design is developed, commissioned and tested under forced-rotation conditions to validate the twisting and bending models. The predicted modal frequencies are also compared with the results of vibration tests on the blades. Recommendations are made for further improvements...|$|R
40|$|The {{aerodynamic}} mechanisms {{responsible for}} the production of noise present in the flow field around the Hubco A-bar roof rack have been investigated experimentally. The frequency spectra of sound emissions were determined using sound measurement equipment in the field and in a specially designed low noise wind tunnel. Flow visualisation and hotwire anemometry techniques were also used to establish a model of the flow around the roof rack. Correlation was drawn between flow phenomena and sound emissions. The source of the annoying tonal emission was established to be a periodic vortex shedding from the trailing edge of the <b>aerofoil</b> shaped <b>profile.</b> Treatments to reduce or eliminate this sound emission were developed, based upon changing the flow pattern {{across the surface of the}} roof rack. The generation of chordwise trailing vortices near the leading edge of the A-bar was found to be effective in noise abatement by disturbing the formation of the regular vortex street. These chordwise vortices may also break up the spanwise correlation of the periodic wake reducing the strength of the noise emission. Chordwise vortices are generated by installation of cross flow inducing obstructions such as cylinders, hemispheres, serrations and diagonal steps near the leading edge. The treatments have been developed to meet the design requirements for robustness, durability and aesthetic appeal without sacrificing the strength or life of the roof rack itself. The noise treatment techniques chosen for the A-bar were trialled successfully on competitor roof racks...|$|R
40|$|A {{spectral}} collocation {{method is}} used to obtain {{the solution to the}} Orr-Sommerfeld stability equation. The accuracy of the method is established by comparing against well documented flows, such as the plane Poiseuille and the Blasius Boundary layers. The focus is then placed on the generalised Hiemenz flow, an exact solution to the Navier-Stokes equations constituting the base flow at the leading edge of swept cylinders and <b>aerofoils.</b> The spanwise <b>profile</b> of this flow is very similar to that of Blasius but, unlike the latter case, there is no rational approximation leading to the Orr-Sommerfeld equation. We will show that if, based on experimentally obtained intuition, a nonrational reduction of the full system of linear stability equations is attempted and the resulting Orr-Sommerfeld equation is solved, the linear stability critical Reynolds number is overestimated, as has indeed been done in the past. However, as shown by recent Direct Numerical Simulation results, the frequency eigenspectrum of instability waves may still be obtained through solution of the Orr-Sommerfeld equation. This fact lends some credibility to the assumption under which the Orr-Sommerfeld equation is obtained insofar as the identification of the frequency regime responsible for linear growth is concerned. Finally, an argument is presented pointing towards potential directions in the ongoing research for explanation of subcriticality in the leading edge boundary layer...|$|R
40|$|In general, {{there are}} three {{components}} making up a lightning protection system for wind turbines. These are the receptors, the down conductor and the grounding grid. Receptors and down conductors are usually found in the more recent wind turbine blades and where the down conductors are normally installed on the internal side of the blade. Consequently, the blades are vulnerable to damage and burn resulting from lightning strikes. The authors believe that a system with an external down conductor is likely {{to reduce the risk}} of damage when compared to the system having an internal down conductor. One could envisage an external down conductor would look similar to the one installed on a building or an aircraft. However, external down conductors may compromise the aerodynamic performance of the turbine blades. This paper reports the effect of external down conductors on the pressure coefficient distribution around the turbine blade. The blade <b>profile</b> (<b>aerofoil)</b> used is according to NACA 4418. Numerical simulations, using computational fluid dynamics (CFD), were conducted on an aerofoil without and with external down conductors of 1 mm thickness. The k-ɛ turbulence model that is incorporated in COMSOL Multiphysics (CFD Module) was used for the simulation and the wind speed and angle of attack used was 5 m/s and 5 ˚ respectively. The preliminary results show that the degradation on aerodynamic properties may not be too significant and these indicate that external down conductor arrangement could be considered...|$|R
