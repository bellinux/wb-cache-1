Such an environment should be able to accommodate distributed design teams and design services, as well as heterogeneous design tools and data models.

The XML-based framework provides a collaborative design environment for On-Demand conversion and secure exchange of heterogeneous design data and services.

The framework provides integrated design data, design services and EDA tools across a unified XML standard.

40|$|This thesis work {{exhibits}} {{the survival}} of IPv 4 addressing architecture and also about the distribution and allocation of IPv 4 addresses. The fast growth of the Internet demands huge address space {{and it is the}} prominent cause for IPv 4 exhaustion. The information regarding the existence of IPv 4 addressing architecture in spite of its huge demand for the address space is also discussed. The temporary solutions like private IP addresses, CIDR, NAT makes the life of V 4 still alive. But the permanent solution is to shift towards the new addressing scheme, IPv 6. The merits and demerits of using both the addressing scheme are also discussed. Deploying IPv 6 leads to the co-existence of V 4 and V 6 during the transition phase. Hence appropriate tunneling and transition techniques have to be deployed to make communication possible across both the addressing scheme. After the transition period the whole internet will be operating with V 6 address. During that phase packet travelling <b>across</b> <b>LAN</b> will be carrying huge header to payload ratio. Hence finally this paper also brings out a suggestion on reducing this ratio across the local traffic in the V 6 environment...|$|E

40|$|This paper proposes Phoenix, a {{programming}} {{model for}} writing parallel and distributed applications that accommodate dynamically joining/leaving compute resources. In the proposed model, nodes {{involved in an}} application see a large and fixed virtual node name space. They communicate via messages, whose destinations are specified by virtual node names, rather than names bound to a physical resource. We describe Phoenix API and show how it allows a transparent migration of application states, as well as dynamically joining/leaving nodes as its by-product. We also demonstrate through several application studies that Phoenix model is close enough to regular message passing, thus it is a general programming model that facilitates porting many parallel applications/algorithms to more dynamic environments. Experimental results indicate applications that have a small task migration cost can quickly take advantage of dynamically joining resources using Phoenix. Divide-and-conquer algorithms written in Phoenix achieved a good speedup {{with a large number}} of nodes <b>across</b> multiple <b>LANs</b> (120 times speedup using 169 CPUs <b>across</b> three <b>LANs).</b> We believe Phoenix provides a useful programming abstraction and platform for emerging parallel applications that must be deployed <b>across</b> multiple <b>LANs</b> and/or shared clusters having dynamically varying resource conditions...|$|R

40|$|Distribution of {{packetized}} {{digital speech}} <b>across</b> high-speed <b>LANs</b> {{has become increasingly}} feasible, and packet voice protocols supporting audio conferencing are available.

In this paper we propose a new error control mechanism for packet voice, referred to as Slack ARQ (S-ARQ).

These wireless LANs provide convenient network connectivity to users. Although mobile nodes allowed roaming <b>across</b> wireless <b>LANs,</b> handoff latency becomes an obstacle when mobile nodes migrate between different IP networks. Advanced, the link-layer handoff process disrupts the association when a mobile node moves from one access point to another. Without discussing the latency of Mobility Protocols, this link-layer handoff latency already made many real time applications can not meet their requirements. Several actual network experiments are made to proof this point. In this paper, it is proposed that a link-layer optimization scheme is designed to reduce the latency of link-layer handoff procedure. No violation to the existing specifications in the IEEE 802. 11 standard and compatible with existing devices.

Instead, the system has been reduced to a 1 -dimensional model (i. e., a sequence of events on a single time line) by assuming either that events are synchronous (i. e., “slotted ” operation of the protocol) or that all stations are mutually equidistant (so it can be assumed that each station’s time line is identical).

40|$|Abstract—Recently, {{wireless}} LANs {{based on}} the IEEE 802. 11 standard have become popular and widely used, and Voice-over-IP (VoIP) {{is one of the}} most promising technologies to be used in mobile devices over wireless networks. Up-to-date, new technologies have improved, providing a high data rate to support various kinds of realtime applications. However, besides the need for higher data rates, seamless handoff is another important issue to be addressed in order to continue supporting real-time services <b>across</b> wireless <b>LANs.</b> In this paper we introduce a novel Access Point (AP) with two transceivers to improve network efficiency in terms of supporting seamless handoff and balancing the traffic load in a wireless network. In our proposed scheme, the novel AP will use the second transceiver to scan and find neighboring STAs in the transmission range and later send the result to its associate AP, which in turn compares and analyzes whether or not the STA should perform a handoff. The initial results from our simulations show the novel AP module is more effective than the conventional one in terms of providing a handoff process with low latency and support traffic load sharing with neighbor APs...|$|R
