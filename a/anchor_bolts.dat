5|$|As {{the tornado}} crossed South Richard Road, it {{intensified}} {{into a very}} high-end EF4 and inflicted catastrophic damage to several large homes as it impacted the Deer Creek subdivision. Well-built homes along South Richard Road and East Kuehl Court were leveled and swept from their foundations with debris strewn downwind. Several vehicles parked at these residences were moved some distance or tossed, and wind rowing of debris occurred. One house had its concrete walkway pulled {{a few inches from}} its original location, and notable scouring of lawn grass was observed in the subdivision. These structures were estimated to have been impacted by winds near 200mph (320km/h), the upper bound of an EF4 tornado. The homes swept away in this area were bolted to their foundations and there is some speculation that the tornado may have reached EF5 intensity at this point, though close inspection revealed that some of the washers were missing from the <b>anchor</b> <b>bolts,</b> and that low-lying shrubbery near the homes was left mostly intact, preventing a higher rating. Continuing northeast, the tornado temporarily weakened as it destroyed a few large barns or outbuildings, ripped the roof off two brick residences, and collapsed most walls of another house, but once again gained strength as it approached Illinois Route 64. A large restaurant and a residence had their exterior walls collapsed.|$|E

25|$|Fang bolts or rail <b>anchor</b> <b>bolts</b> {{have also}} been used for fixing rails or chairs to sleepers. The fang bolt is a bolt {{inserted}} {{through a hole in}} the sleeper with a fanged nut that bites into the lower surface of the sleeper. For fastening flat-bottomed rails, an upper-lipped washer can be used to grip the edge of the rail. They are more resistant to loosening by vibrations and movement of the rail. They are thought more effective than spikes and screws and so are used in positions such as switch (point) tieplates and on sharp curves.|$|E

40|$|Generally, L <b>anchor</b> <b>bolt</b> {{system has}} been used {{for a long period of}} time in {{construction}} industry as one of the distributing load structures. However, there are some weaknesses in L <b>anchor</b> <b>bolt</b> which may straighten and pullup when charged with tensile load. Current practices prefer to use other types of <b>anchor</b> <b>bolt</b> systems, such as headed studs <b>anchor</b> <b>bolt</b> system to replace the L <b>anchor</b> <b>bolt</b> design. There has been lack of studies to prove that it is more effective in terms of performance. A new T <b>anchor</b> <b>bolt</b> which was basically modified from headed studs <b>anchor</b> <b>bolt</b> was proposed in this study to compare its performance of tensile loading in concrete failure to typical L design. This study aims to determine whether the T <b>anchor</b> <b>bolt</b> system gives better performance as compared to an L <b>anchor</b> <b>bolt</b> system. The performance was rated based on tensile loading on concrete failure pattern. A pullout test was conducted on two different <b>anchor</b> <b>bolt</b> systems, namely L and T. The <b>anchor</b> <b>bolt</b> embedded depth, h in concrete were varied according to their hook or bend radius. Each sample was repeated twice. There were totally eight samples. The hook or bend radius used were 50 mm and 57. 5 mm for sample L 1 and L 2, respectively. 90 -degree bend were used on sample T 1 and T 2. Based on test results, it can be seen that the performance of concrete failure pattern under tensile load on both L and T <b>anchor</b> <b>bolt</b> design samples with 200 mm embedment depth was better than deeper embedment depth of 230 mm. But the L <b>anchor</b> <b>bolt</b> design gives the best results as compared to T design. Although T <b>anchor</b> <b>bolt</b> design shows higher resistance before first bond failure to the concrete sample. T <b>anchor</b> <b>bolt</b> was analysed and needed deeper embedment depth to allow formation of cone pull-out shape to acquire better performance...|$|R

500|$|Preliminary damage surveys {{conducted}} {{by a group of}} structural engineers from Texas Tech University determined that many of the frame homes that were destroyed by the Bridge Creek−Moore tornado were constructed below minimal residential building code standards, discovering some structural deficiencies that violated codes, which were considered to be inadequate for regions prone to tornadic activity (under federal building code standards, frame homes that were properly strapped and bolted would have withstood winds between 152 and 157 miles per hour (245 and 253km/h), equivalent to an F2 tornado). The team, led by meteorological researcher Charles Doswell and storm damage engineer/meteorologist Tim Marshall, determined that nails attached to a plywood roof deck in one damaged home were not properly anchored to the rafters; several homes in rural areas that were swept nearly [...] from their original location did not have <b>anchor</b> <b>bolts</b> that secured the frame to their foundations, as was the case at Country Place Estates, where the homes − which left a trail of debris strewn [...] away from their location − were attached to the concrete foundations by tapered cut nails that extended only a half-inch to the bases; many homes that were left at least partially standing also had their garage doors (mainly those made from aluminum material) collapse inward, allowing the tornado's destructive winds to enter the houses.|$|E
500|$|The tornado {{touched down}} in the Lakeview community, {{initially}} causing structural damage to small buildings and snapping trees. The tornado grew in intensity and the path width increased from around [...] to [...] as it entered the Rainsville and Sylvania communities. Damage included houses that were completely removed from foundations and debris scattered for about , trees were debarked, and a few mobile homes were completely destroyed with debris strewn for about a mile downstream. Aerial surveys also revealed ground scouring in the area. EF5 damage was noted as a pickup truck was thrown hundreds of yards and torn into multiple pieces, and an [...] steel safe anchored to a foundation was torn away, thrown [...] and had its door torn from its hinges. One home in this area was swept away, and a stone pillar was ripped from the ground, thrown, and broken into pieces, with part of a concrete foundation being ripped {{out of the ground}} in the process. Other homes that were swept away were found with their concrete porches torn away and smashed to pieces. An underground storm shelter was partially sucked out of the ground, pavement was stripped from roads, and sidewalk pavement was pulled up at one location. In Sylvania, several other houses were completely removed from foundations, some of which contained <b>anchor</b> <b>bolts</b> and foundation straps. The tornado continued to the south of Ider where significant damage was observed. It crossed into Georgia near Fox Mountain as an EF1 with winds of [...] It tracked [...] into Georgia before lifting outside of Rising Fawn. Damage in Georgia was limited to trees and power lines.

500|$|The tornado quickly {{intensified}} as {{it crossed}} Oklahoma State Highway 92, attaining F4 strength about [...] east-northeast of Amber. Damage {{consistent with this}} rating was sustained over the following [...] of the path before striking Bridge Creek. There, it attained the highest-possible rating on the Fujita Scale, F5. Damage in this area was extreme, as many homes were [...] swept away completely, leaving only concrete slabs where the structures once stood. Damage surveyors noted that the remaining structural debris {{from some of the}} homes in this area was finely granulated into small fragments, and that trees and shrubs were completely debarked. A few of these homes were bolted to their foundations. Extensive ground scouring occurred, and vehicles were thrown hundreds of yards from where they originated, including a mangled pickup truck that was found wrapped around a telephone pole. It was in this area that a mobile Doppler weather radar recorded winds of [...] within the tornado, the highest wind speed ever recorded on Earth. Since the record for maximum winds are reported from only non-tornadic events, however, the [...] wind gust from Cyclone Olivia in 1996 retained the title. About [...] of asphalt was scoured off a road by the violent tornado. Approximately 200 mobile homes/houses were destroyed, and hundreds of other structures were damaged. The Ridgecrest Baptist Church in Bridge Creek was also destroyed in the process. About 12 people died in Bridge Creek, nine of whom were in mobile homes; all fatalities and the majority of injuries were concentrated in the Willow Lake and Southern Hills Additions and Bridge Creek Estates, consisting mostly of mobile homes. Over 39 people were injured in the area as well.

2500|$|A {{hammer drill}} has a {{specially}} designed clutch that allows it to not only spin the drill bit, but also to punch it in and out (along the axis of the bit). The actual distance the bit travels in and out and the force of its blow are both very small, and the hammering action is very rapid—thousands of [...] "BPM" [...] (blows per minute) or [...] "IPM" [...] (impacts per minute). Although each blow is of relatively low force, these thousands of blows per minute are more than adequate to break up concrete or brick, using the masonry drill bit's carbide wedge to pulverize it for the spiral flutes to whisk away. For this reason, a hammer drill drills much faster than a regular drill through concrete or brick.

40|$|AbstractDuring the {{extraction}} {{process of the}} top coal caving working face, the fierce looseness, deformation as well as fracture of the surrounding rocks would usually occur because the slots will get strong disturbance. Meanwhile, <b>anchored</b> <b>bolt</b> and cable-bolt shall deform accordingly. When the deformation of the <b>anchored</b> <b>bolt</b> or cable-bolt comes to the extreme extent, they will crack.

In the paper, based on the dynamic mechanism analysis on fracture phenomenon about the anchored cable-bolt, the formulas of the kinetic energy and speed of the fractural catapult of the horizontally anchored cables in the ribs and the vertically anchored cables in the roof have been established. And a bolt support theory “small pretightening force & large expected anchorage strength” has been put forward, which is useful for seriously deformed roadways to prevent anchored cable-bolts from breaking.

50|$|A pin shackle {{is closed}} with an <b>anchor</b> <b>bolt</b> and cotter pin, {{in a manner}} similar to a clevis. It is for this reason they are often {{referred}} to, in industrial jargon, as clevises. Pin shackles can be inconvenient to work with, at times, as the bolt will need to be secured to the shackle body to avoid its loss, usually with a split pin or seizing wire. A more secure version used in crane rigging features the combination of a securing nut (hardware) located alongside the cotter pin. Pin shackles are practical in many rigging applications where the <b>anchor</b> <b>bolt</b> is expected to experience some rotation.|$|R

Once the hole for the rebar is drilled, cartridges of polyester resin are installed in the hole. The rebar bolt is installed after the resin and spun by the installation drill. This opens the resin cartridge and mixes it. Once the resin hardens the drill spinning tightens the rebar bolt holding the rock together. Resin grouted rebar is considered a permanent ground support with a lifespan of 20-30 years.|$|R
