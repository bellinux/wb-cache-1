30|$|The main {{marine species}} in {{worldwide}} capture over years were {{the families of}} Gardidae (Alaska Pollock, Atlantic Cod, Blue Whiting, Pacific Cod), Engraulidae (Anchoveta, Japaneese Anchovy), Scombridae (Skipjack Tuna, Chub Mackerel, Yellowfish Tuna, Atlantic Mackerel, Seerfishes Nei), Clupeidae (Sardinellas Nei, Atlantic Herring, European Pilchard, Araucanian Herring, European Sprat, Pacific Herring), Carangidae (Scads Nei), Trichiuridae (Largehead Hairtail), Ommastrephidae (Humboldt Squid, Argentine Shortfin Squid), Nemipteridae (Threadfin Breams Nei), Scomberesocidae (Pacific Saury), Portunidae (Gazami Crab), <b>Akiami</b> <b>Paste</b> <b>Shrimp</b> (FAO 2016). Worldwide, the most important fish families farmed in aquaculture are Cyprinidae (Carp), Salmonidae (Salmon, Trout), Serranidae (Seabass), Acipenseridae (Sturgeon), Scophthalmidae (Turbot), Sparidae (Sea Bream), Mytilidae (Mussels), Ostreidae (Oysters) and some families of clams (European Comission 2012). Thus, due to the abundance of aforeisaid species in worldwide fishing production, an attention must be paid on better utilization of a big amount of by-products rested after their processing.|$|E
40|$|In this study, {{the status}} of coastal {{fisheries}} was examined based on the catch and number of fishing vessels of coastal fisheries in Korea. Comparing the status on coastal fisheries of the East Sea, Yellow Sea and South Sea in Korea, scientific evidence was made for fisheries management on coastal fisheries based on characteristics of each sea area. From 1990 to 2011, the catch of coastal fisheries in Korean waters ranged from 150, 000 mt to 230, 000 mt, {{with an average of}} 190, 000 mt, and it accounted for 15 % in average of total catch fished in adjacent waters of Korea. In order of catch by coastal fisheries, gillnet (36. 7 %) was the primary fishery, followed by coastal complex (24. 7 %), stow net (18. 3 %), trap (12. 9 %), lift net (3. 9 %), purse seine (3. 0 %) and beam trawl (0. 4 %) fisheries. In order of catch by species, anchovy (15. 0 %) had the largest proportion of total catch, followed by common squid (10. 3 %), <b>akiami</b> <b>paste</b> <b>shrimp</b> (5. 2 %), blue crab (3. 9 %) and octopus (3. 7 %). Of the average catch by sea area from 1990 to 2011, Yellow Sea, South Sea and East Sea were 37. 4 %, 34. 6 % and 28. 0 %, respectively. Since 2000 s, however, the average catch of South Sea has accounted for the largest proportion. The number of permitted fishing vessels involved in 8 coastal fisheries was 55, 336 vessels in average from 1997 to 2011. The number of vessels was about 47, 000 vessels in 1997, and increased to 61, 300 vessels until 2000, then has decreased to 44, 000 vessels operating in 2011. In order of th...|$|E

30|$|Kapi, {{a typical}} {{traditional}} salted <b>shrimp</b> <b>paste,</b> {{has been widely}} consumed in Thailand as a condiment. Salted <b>shrimp</b> <b>paste</b> is generally prepared from the planktonous shrimp or krill (Acetes vulgaris or Mesopodopsis orientalis). Traditionally, salted <b>shrimp</b> <b>paste</b> is produced by mixing one part of salt with three to five parts of shrimp or krill. The mixture is salted, pounded and {{spread out on the}} ground to dry under sunlight. The paste is compacted and allowed to ferment in anaerobic condition at ambient temperature (25 – 35  °C) for at least 1  month or longer (Faithong et al. 2010). The color of salted <b>shrimp</b> <b>paste</b> varies from a pinkish or purplish gray to a dark grayish brown. The consistency also varies, from soft and pasty to dry and hard. It could be preserved for several months (Phithakpol 1993). However, raw material, shrimp or krill/salt ratio, fermentation process and time can be varied, depending on regions or countries. This leads to different characteristics and properties of the product (Peralta et al. 2008). However, a little information regarding the chemical compositions and physical properties of salted <b>shrimp</b> <b>paste</b> (Kapi) produced in different places in Thailand has been reported. Thus, the objective {{of this study was to}} determine the chemical composition and physical properties of salted <b>shrimp</b> <b>paste</b> collected from various regions of Thailand.|$|R
