25|$|Sir Rowland {{wonders if}} there is {{anything}} written on the autographed papers in invisible ink and they test them, revealing the names of six distributors of drugs, including Costello. Going to tell the police their findings, the sleeping Pippa is left alone <b>and,</b> <b>after</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment,</b> Jeremy re-enters and is about to smother the girl's face with a cushion when Clarissa comes back. She soon realises that he is the killer. He was away from the other two men for a time after they had gone to the club to eat and a remark Pippa made about seeing his golf club ("A golf stick like Jeremy had", {{in the context of the}} weapon used to kill Costello) ties in. He also rang the police to try to incriminate Clarissa. Jeremy confesses; his motive was the envelope that the autographed papers were kept in – on it is an extremely rare error stamp worth the fourteen thousand pounds. He is about to kill Clarissa when the police enter the room, having heard the exchange, and arrest him. They take him away. The others go to bed and Henry returns but without his diplomatic guests who have failed to turn up. Like the police inspector, he fails to believe a word his wife tells him of the evening's events...|$|E
500|$|On {{the night}} of Bandslam, Charlotte comes {{backstage}} in order to apologize to the band, <b>and</b> <b>after</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> of hesitation, Will accepts her apology. Right before going on stage, however, they discover that Ben's band (the [...] "Glory Dogs") have decided to play the song that I Can't Go On, I'll Go On were originally to perform, forcing them to change their act at the last minute. Will suddenly remembers the video Sa5m's mother showed him earlier and suggests that they perform [...] "Everything I Own", {{since it is the}} only other song Sa5m knows. To buy some time, Will comes out first onstage, but at first he is embarrassingly silent. The students begin to chant [...] "Dewey! Dewey! Dewey!". He starts to walk off the stage, but then comes back and decides to chant with them instead. After carrying the chant for a while, he finally changes it to, [...] "Do we wanna ROCK?!". The band then shows up and fires up the crowd with an upbeat ska version of [...] "Everything I Own".|$|E
2500|$|The {{stage manager}} calls [...] "Curtain" [...] and Christine takes her place on stage.

Her performance is {{watched from the}} wings by the Phantom and Raoul, until Raoul resigns himself to the decision she has made ("Love Never Dies").|$|E

2500|$|Taylor {{himself has}} said after seeing that Clapton hadn't appeared, but that his guitar {{had already been}} {{set up on the}} stage, he {{approached}} John Mayall during the interval to ask if he could play with them. Taylor mentioned that he'd heard their albums and knew some of the songs, <b>and</b> <b>after</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> of deliberation, Mayall agreed. Taylor amended, [...] "I wasn't thinking that this was a great opportunity... I just really wanted to get up on stage and play the guitar." ...|$|E
