25|$|Food {{was very}} basic and monotonous. One {{incident}} in the early 1900s told how for weeks on end there was not 'pudding' until constant demands resulted in a dessert made from boiled cabbage scraps. Sobriety was encouraged, not always successfully, by {{the establishment of a}} soft drink bottling factory inside the Fort. The 'Artillery' bottles of this factory are much sought <b>after</b> <b>today.</b>|$|E
25|$|Smith-Clarke {{retired in}} 1950 and Dunn {{took over as}} chief engineer. In 1950 a new chassis and six-cylinder 3–litre engine was {{announced}} and this highly successful engine became the basis of all Alvis models until production ceased in 1967. Saloon bodies for the TA 21, as the new model was called, again came from Mulliners of Birmingham as they had for the TA 14, with Tickford producing the dropheads. But with {{the first of these}} committing themselves in October 1954 to supply only Standard Triumph who purchased it in 1958 and the second being acquired by David Brown owner of Aston Martin Lagonda in late 1955, it was becoming clear that new arrangements would have to be made. Some of the most original and beautiful designs on the 3Litre chassis were being produced by master coachbuilder Carrosserie Herman Graber of Switzerland and indeed these often one-off–designed cars are highly sought <b>after</b> <b>today.</b> Graber had begun to use TA 14 chassis soon after the war building three Tropic coupés which were much admired. When the Three Litre chassis was introduced his bodies displayed at the Geneva Motor Shows in 1951 and 1952 attracted sufficient interest for Graber to set up a standing order of 30 chassis per year. Swiss-built Graber coupés were displayed on the Alvis stand at both Paris and London Motor Shows in October 1955.|$|E
2500|$|Tenses that refer {{specifically}} to [...] "today" [...] are called hodiernal tenses; {{these can be}} either past or future. Apart from Kalaw Lagaw Ya, another language which features such tenses is Mwera, a Bantu language of Tanzania. It is also suggested that in 17th-century French, the passé composé served as a hodiernal past. Tenses which contrast with hodiernals, by referring to the past before today or the future <b>after</b> <b>today,</b> are called pre-hodiernal and post-hodiernal respectively. Some languages also have a crastinal tense, a future tense referring {{specifically to}} tomorrow (found in some Bantu languages); or a hesternal tense, a past tense referring specifically to yesterday (although this name is also sometimes used to mean pre-hodiernal). A tense for after tomorrow is thus called post-crastinal, and one for before yesterday is called pre-hesternal.|$|E

2500|$|In {{the summer}} of 2003, Today once again found itself at the centre of {{allegations}} of political bias, this time against a Labour government. The controversy arose <b>after</b> <b>Today</b> broadcast a report by its correspondent Andrew Gilligan. The report alleged that a dossier the British Government had produced to convince the British public {{of the need to}} invade Iraq was deliberately exaggerated, and that the government had known this prior to publishing it. In his live 2-way (interview with presenter John Humphrys), just after 6.07 a.m., Gilligan asserted that the Government [...] "probably knew" [...] that one of the main claims in its dossier [...] "was wrong". Gilligan's anonymous source for the claim was Dr David Kelly, a key adviser on biological weapons who had worked in Iraq – though it was never established whether Dr Kelly had actually used the words Gilligan attributed to him.|$|E

[...] During her tenure on Today, she won an Emmy award {{for her role in}} NBC’s coverage of the democratic uprising in Romania. [...] Ratings on Today declined after Norville’s arrival. [...] NBC management was accused of mishandling the transition. [...] One insider told People magazine, “NBC handled the whole situation in a very poor manner. [...] I don’t think she (Deborah) blames anyone in particular. [...] I just think she feels the situation was handled unprofessionally – in an undignified manner for both her and Jane.” [...] After Norville took maternity leave on the birth of her first child, she did not return to the program.|$|E
