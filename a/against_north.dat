5|$|Away from cricket, Miller {{was also}} a {{successful}} Australian rules footballer. He played for St Kilda and was selected to represent the Victorian state team. He played 50 games for St Kilda, for whom he kicked eight goals in one game <b>against</b> <b>North</b> Melbourne, during 1941.|$|E
5|$|Even though Johnson {{had been}} given a mandate to take {{military}} action <b>against</b> <b>North</b> Vietnam and their Viet Cong allies in South Vietnam, he hesitated to take further steps to retaliate <b>against</b> <b>North</b> Vietnam. Towards the end of 1964, Johnson {{was in the midst of}} a presidential election and he did not want the U.S. public to believe that he was leading their country into war. Therefore, Johnson decided to wait until after the election, when his presidency was assured, that he would decide on other military moves. Meanwhile, the political situation in South Vietnam continued to worsen; in August 1964, South Vietnamese General Lan Van Phat tried to overthrow General Nguyễn Khánh, but the coup was aborted and Phat handed power to Air Marshal Nguyễn Cao Kỳ, and Generals Nguyễn Chánh Thi and Nguyễn Văn Thiệu. However, on 20 December 1964, Khánh formed a new military junta with Kỳ and Thi and the civilian-led High National Council was subsequently dissolved. Thus, the South Vietnamese Government was once again plunged into chaos.|$|E
5|$|The United States {{and other}} anti-communist {{countries}} fought <b>against</b> <b>North</b> Vietnam and its communist allies during the Vietnam War {{in an attempt}} to prevent the communist takeover of South Vietnam and, more broadly, to implement the United States' policy of containment {{to prevent the spread of}} communism. Eight of the 246 men who received the Medal of Honor for fighting in this war attended USMA.|$|E

5|$|The Vietcong commanders {{had planned}} the venture with twoobjectives in mind. First, by attacking an American {{installation}} {{in the center}} of the heavily guarded capital, the Vietcong intended to demonstrate their ability to strike in South Vietnam should the United States decide to launch air raids <b>against</b> <b>North</b> Vietnam. Second, the bombing would demonstrate to the South Vietnamese that the Americans were vulnerable and could not be relied upon for protection.|$|E
5|$|The largest bomb used {{in combat}} during the war, Tarzon {{was used in}} strikes <b>against</b> <b>North</b> Korean bridges and other {{hardened}} targets, the Tarzon's improved accuracy over conventional 'dumb bombs' led to the confirmed destruction of at least six high-priority targets during approximately six months of combat use; these included a hydroelectric plant, proving the effectiveness of guided weapons against conventional targets as well as bridges.|$|E
5|$|When news of {{the attack}} on Camp Holloway reached Saigon on the morning of 7 February 1965, General William Westmoreland, McGeorge Bundy and Ambassador Maxwell Taylor, flew out to Pleiku to survey the damage. Bundy then called President Johnson to put forward the MACV's request for retaliatory air strikes <b>against</b> <b>North</b> Vietnam. In {{response}} to Bundy's request, Johnson hastily convened a session of the National Security Council, which involved the speaker of the House of Representatives and the Senate majority leader, to discuss the need for reprisal against the Communists in Vietnam. That afternoon, General Nguyễn Khánh arrived in Pleiku to meet with Westmoreland and Bundy, and they both informed him that recommendations for air strikes <b>against</b> <b>North</b> Vietnam had been made to the President of the United States.|$|E

5|$|Wilson's {{last season}} for the Melbourne Cricket Club came in 1893–94. He missed the first two premiership matches of the season, but after top scoring with 47 and taking two wickets in a non-premiership match against Fitzroy, Wilson was {{selected}} for the third match, <b>against</b> <b>North</b> Melbourne. Wilson took 1/72 in the first innings <b>against</b> <b>North,</b> the wicket being that of Isaac Drape, and scored 27 runs batting an number 10. He was not called upon to bat or bowl in the second innings. Wilson was retained in the side for the next match against Carlton. He batted at 11 in the first innings and was on 0 not out when the innings closed. Wilson was not required to bowl or bat again in what ended up being his final match for the MCC. In total, he played 14 matches for Melbourne for a return of 138 runs at a batting average of 10.61 and 15 wickets at a bowling average of 30.73.|$|E
5|$|Across the Central Highlands of Vietnam, the South Vietnamese {{military}} {{enjoyed a}} numerical superiority of about 78,300 soldiers <b>against</b> <b>North</b> Vietnam’s 65,141 soldiers. However, within {{the vicinity of}} Ban Me Thuot, the South Vietnamese were actually outnumbered by a ratio of 5:1. The North Vietnamese had more tanks, armoured vehicles, and heavy artillery, with a ratio of about 2:1. North Vietnamese General Van Tien Dung believed his tank and artillery units in the Central Highlands were the key factors that guaranteed a quick victory, because South Vietnam simply lacked the capability to withstand such large numbers of heavy weaponry.|$|E
5|$|After he {{completed}} 12 of 13 passes, McElroy {{set a new}} single-game Alabama record for completion percentage of 92.3 percent to break the previous record he set <b>against</b> <b>North</b> Texas in 2009. The game also {{marked the first time}} Alabama played on a Thursday night since defeating Southern Miss in 2001, and the return of both former Alabama head coach Bill Curry as the Panthers' head coach and quarterback Star Jackson who transferred to Georgia State prior to the 2010 season. The 63 points were the most scored by an Alabama team since defeating Vanderbilt 63–3 in 1979.|$|E

5|$|After the {{initiation}} of Operation Rolling Thunder, the sustained aerial campaign <b>against</b> <b>North</b> Vietnam that had begun on 5 March 1965, the Barrel Roll area of operations was divided on 3 April. Barrel Roll was {{to continue in the}} northeast while the southern portion of the area, where interdiction missions against the Ho Chi Minh trail were paramount, was redesignated Tiger Hound. Command and control of that area was handed over to the American commander in Saigon, General William C. Westmoreland.|$|E
5|$|Also on August 29, the ROK Capital Division, with American {{tank and}} {{artillery}} support, recaptured Kigye {{and held it}} during the night <b>against</b> <b>North</b> Korean counterattacks, only to lose it again at dawn. American air attacks continued at an increased tempo in the Kigye area. South Korean troops reported finding the bodies of many North Koreans, apparently killed by air attack. They also found many suits of white clothing scattered on the ground, abandoned when North Korean soldiers changed from civilian disguises into military uniforms.|$|E
5|$|Between March 1965 and November 1968, {{aircraft}} of the U.S. Air Force {{had flown}} 153,784 attack sorties <b>against</b> <b>North</b> Vietnam, while the Navy and Marine Corps had added another 152,399. On 31 December 1967, the Department of Defense announced that 864,000 tons of American bombs {{had been dropped}} on North Vietnam during Rolling Thunder, compared with 653,000 tons dropped during the entire Korean War and 503,000 tons in the Pacific theater during the Second World War.|$|E

5|$|Both the United States and Australia {{cited the}} {{alliance}} as justification for involvement in Vietnam. U.S. membership in SEATO provided the United States with {{a rationale for}} a large-scale U.S. military intervention in Southeast Asia. Other countries, such as the UK and key nations in Asia, accepted the rationale. In 1962, {{as part of its}} commitment to SEATO, the Royal Australian Air Force deployed CAC Sabres of its No. 79 Squadron to Ubon Royal Thai Air Force Base, Thailand. The Sabres began {{to play a role in}} the Vietnam War in 1965, when their air defence responsibilities expanded to include protection of USAF aircraft using Ubon as a base for strikes <b>against</b> <b>North</b> Vietnam.|$|E
5|$|Deployed to Korea at {{the start}} of the Korean War, the corps was one of three corps that {{remained}} in the country for the entire conflict, commanding US, British, and South Korean forces through three years of back-and-forth campaigns <b>against</b> <b>North</b> Korean and Chinese forces. Following the end of the war, it remained in Korea for almost 20 years guarding the Korean Demilitarized Zone. Active today, the corps acts as a subordinate headquarters of United States Army Forces Command, and has also seen deployments in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom and Operation Enduring Freedom.|$|E
5|$|Harold Oliver {{made his}} senior debut for Port Adelaide on the 25th June 1910 in a win <b>against</b> <b>North</b> Adelaide at Jubilee Oval. During the 1910 Championship of Australia match against Victorian Football League (VFL) premiers Collingwood Harold Oliver kicked 5 goals helping Port Adelaide achieve the win. In 1910 Oliver {{also made the}} journey with Port Adelaide to Western Australia to play a series of matches. This was the first trip by an eastern state club to play {{football}} in Western Australia. Harold Oliver was awarded a gold medal by Port Adelaide for being the best junior of the 1910 season for the club.|$|E

5|$|Harvey {{started the}} tour well and was highly {{productive}} in seven first-class matches {{leading into the}} Tests. He scored 100 and 145 not out <b>against</b> <b>North</b> Eastern Transvaal and Orange Free State. There were two matches against a South African XI that were effectively dress rehearsals for the Tests. In the first, Harvey made 34 in an innings victory. He then made an even 100 in the second match, {{a week before the}} First Test. He had scored 480 runs at 60.00 in the matches leading up to the Tests.|$|E
5|$|He {{was rewarded}} with {{selection}} for Central Zone and after taking 4/133 <b>against</b> <b>North</b> Zone, claimed 5/73 and 2/22 in the final to help them defeat West Zone by 112 runs in Aurangabad to claim the Duleep Trophy, and was the leading wicket-taker during the tournament. He scored a total of 183 runs at 18.30 for the entire Indian first-class season. He took five wickets at 26.60 in four zonal one-dayers, and tasted victory in all four fixtures.|$|E
5|$|In 1965, the USAF began {{operating}} two-seat North American F-100F Super Sabres specially {{equipped for}} Suppression of Enemy Air Defenses mission in Vietnam. Nicknamed the Wild Weasel, these aircraft achieved {{a number of}} victories <b>against</b> <b>North</b> Vietnamese surface-to-air missile radars. The second crew member was a Navigator trained as an Electronic Warfare Officer (EWO) to decipher sensor information and guide the pilot towards the targets. However, the F-100F was an interim solution, since its limited payload often required multiple aircraft to conduct a successful strike; it also lacked the speed and endurance to effectively protect the F-105.|$|E
