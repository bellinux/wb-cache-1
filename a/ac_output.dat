2500|$|From {{the very}} first VSC-HVDC scheme {{installed}} (the Hellsjön experimental link commissioned in Sweden in 1997) until 2012, most of the VSC HVDC systems built {{were based on the}} two level converter. [...] The two-level converter is the simplest type of three-phase voltage-source converter and {{can be thought of as}} a six pulse bridge in which the thyristors have been replaced by IGBTs with inverse-parallel diodes, and the DC smoothing reactors have been replaced by DC smoothing capacitors. [...] Such converters derive their name from the fact that the voltage at the <b>AC</b> <b>output</b> of each phase is switched between two discrete voltage levels, corresponding to the electrical potentials of the positive and negative DC terminals. When the upper of the two valves in a phase is turned on, the <b>AC</b> <b>output</b> terminal is connected to the positive DC terminal, resulting in an output voltage of +½ Ud with respect to the midpoint potential of the converter. [...] Conversely when the lower valve in a phase is turned on, the <b>AC</b> <b>output</b> terminal is connected to the negative DC terminal, resulting in an output voltage of -½ Ud. [...] The two valves corresponding to one phase must never be turned on simultaneously, as this would result in an uncontrolled discharge of the DC capacitor, risking severe damage to the converter equipment.|$|E
40|$|Abstract—This paper {{presents}} {{a new technique}} to obtain isolated dc voltage outputs from a capacitor clamped dc-dc converter. The multilevel modular capacitor clamped converter (MMCCC) has several key features that {{make it possible to}} generate <b>ac</b> <b>outputs</b> (10 kHz) from a dc-dc converter circuit. Using those high frequency <b>ac</b> <b>outputs,</b> the MMCCC circuit can incorporate single or multiple high frequency transformers to generate isolated <b>ac</b> <b>outputs.</b> These isolated outputs can be rectified and filtered to obtain unidirectional or bi-directional dc outputs. Using another MMCCC converter stage or an active full bridge block, the ac port can be made bi-directional to transfer power in both directions. By adopting the MMCCC topology to achieve isolated outputs, it is possible to simultaneously integrate multiple dc sources in an isolated and non-isolated manner. This paper will investigate the origin of the <b>ac</b> <b>outputs</b> in the MMCCC circuit, and present an analytical approach to estimating the isolated dc output voltage. Finally, experimental results will be presented for further verification of the concept. I...|$|R

5|$|The VFD {{controller}} is a solid-state {{power electronics}} conversion system consisting of three distinct sub-systems: a rectifier bridge converter, a direct current (DC) link, and an inverter. Voltage-source inverter (VSI) drives (see 'Generic topologies' sub-section below) {{are by far}} {{the most common type of}} drives. Most drives are AC-AC drives in that they convert AC line input to <b>AC</b> inverter <b>output.</b> However, in some applications such as common DC bus or solar applications, drives are configured as DC-AC drives. The most basic rectifier converter for the VSI drive is configured as a three-phase, six-pulse, full-wave diode bridge. In a VSI drive, the DC link consists of a capacitor which smooths out the converter's DC output ripple and provides a stiff input to the inverter. This filtered DC voltage is converted to quasi-sinusoidal <b>AC</b> voltage <b>output</b> using the inverter's active switching elements. VSI drives provide higher power factor and lower harmonic distortion than phase-controlled current-source inverter (CSI) and load-commutated inverter (LCI) drives (see 'Generic topologies' sub-section below). The drive controller can also be configured as a phase converter having single-phase converter input and three-phase inverter output.|$|R
