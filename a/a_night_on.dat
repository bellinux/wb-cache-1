5|$|In 1991, Paul Rudnick's comedy I Hate Hamlet, {{performed}} at the Walter Kerr Theatre, was set in Barrymore's former apartment. He returns after a séance, dressed in his Hamlet costume. Nicol Williamson played the Barrymore role. Three years later, a London production, Jack: <b>A</b> <b>Night</b> <b>on</b> the Town with John Barrymore, ran for 60 performances at the Criterion Theatre, and Williamson again played the lead. Barrymore, a two-person play by William Luce, premiered in 1996 and depicts Barrymore {{shortly before his death}} in 1942 as he is rehearsing a revival of his Richard III. Christopher Plummer played the title role. A film version was released in 2012, with Plummer again taking the main role.|$|E

Kulesza and one of his assistants, Bernard Blaut, decided to leave Młynarczyk behind, much to the indignation of some players, including Stanisław Terlecki, Zbigniew Boniek, Włodzimierz Smolarek and Władysław Żmuda. Terlecki, a stridently pro-Western intellectual with a reputation for mocking the communist establishment, was particularly angered, and himself drove Młynarczyk to the airport, where the players continued their protests. Kulesza eventually relented and allowed Młynarczyk to travel with the team.|$|E

5|$|An {{employee}} named Nasir (Haaz Sleiman) {{has taken}} explicit {{photos of the}} two, and Amira’s father will disown her if the father finds out. Veronica goes to a photo-developing store and retrieves the photos, but one is stuck in the printer and Nasir gets it. Amira’s father shows up at her door and angrily berates her and fires Veronica, although she says that her real employer is his wife. Keith catches Wallace and Piz, out for <b>a</b> <b>night</b> <b>on</b> the town, in a bar, discovering that they have high-quality fake IDs from Veronica, leading Keith to reprimand her. Veronica discovers the true vandal after tracking a piece of bait. The vandal’s name is Derrick (Cole Williams), who vandalized after seeing Nasir distributing a piece of anti-American propaganda at a mall. Both owners want to meet Derrick before pressing charges. Keith sends Piz (Chris Lowell) and Wallace (Percy Daggs III) with clearly fake IDs into a bar {{as a test of}} his subordinates. He finds that the deputy does not check closely and resents Keith as well. Due to this fact, Keith fires the people who disobeyed his orders.|$|E
5|$|Before Hope and Liam's {{official}} legal {{wedding in}} the United States, Steffy spends <b>a</b> <b>night</b> <b>on</b> {{the town with}} Liam. Hope finds out and leaves Liam. Steffy and Liam are reunited, and she soon finds she is pregnant in early 2013. However, she keeps it to herself when she sees Hope and Liam kissing. Liam finds out about the pregnancy and recommits himself to Steffy, but shortly after their wedding she who loses the baby in a motorbike accident. Steffy then learns that her accident has left her infertile. Devastated, Steffy decides to divorce Liam and relocate to Paris. She returns to Los Angeles several months later for a brief visit, informing Liam that her infertility issues have been corrected, hoping that it could mean a second chance for them. Despite this, Liam insists that he is obligated to Hope, and Steffy leaves town again. After another short visit to Los Angeles in February 2015, Steffy returns months later to help Ridge take over Forrester Creations by overthrowing Rick. She becomes {{president of the company}} and rekindles her romance with Liam, ending his relationship with her cousin, Ivy Forrester (Ashleigh Brewer). Steffy's cousin, Aly (Ashlyn Pearce), resents Steffy, attributed to the fact that Taylor had accidentally killed her mother, Darla (Schae Harrison), years ago in car accident. An unstable Aly attempts to kill Steffy on PCH, resulting in Steffy killing Aly with a tire iron in self-defense. However, Ivy recorded a video of the accident on her phone, not seeing the rock Steffy killed Aly with. Ivy gets involved with Wyatt Spencer (Darin Brooks) and Ivy blackmails Steffy with the video, calling the accident a murder. Ivy decides to delete the video after Steffy tries to convince Wyatt to delete it. Thomas tells Steffy that he made out with Ivy while Wyatt was on a business trip. Steffy confronts Ivy and convinces her to tell Wyatt but tells Wyatt before Ivy has a chance. Wyatt breaks up with her and Ivy is angry at Steffy and confronts her in front of a broken electrical panel, resulting in an altercation in which Ivy gets electrocuted. Ivy survives and files a restraining order against Steffy while Wyatt resumes his relationship with Ivy. Ivy realized she never got over Liam and convinces Liam to give them another chance if she drops the restraining order. Quinn overhears Ivy telling Liam she loves him and exposes this in front of Steffy and Liam while Wyatt is proposing to Ivy. Wyatt breaks up with Ivy and she packs her bags for Australia. On top of the staircase, Steffy confronts Ivy and she tumbles down. Liam is angry at Steffy and breaks up with her. Liam hits his head on the plane with Ivy, while Wyatt comforts Steffy. Liam disappears (he was really kidnapped by Quinn after having passed out due to concussion symptoms he acquired by hitting his head while on a plane and passing out {{in the parking lot of}} Forrester Creations and losing his memory as a result) and Wyatt tells her that Liam must have once again let her down. He shows her how to have fun by surfing on the beach and even buys her a motorcycle, which she hasn't driven since her miscarriage. The two fall in love and eventually get married on the beach. Steffy's marriage to Wyatt eventually breaks down due to their differing opinions about Quinn and they separate while Steffy contemplates divorcing Wyatt. She eventually rekindles her love and relationship with Liam, Liam proposes to Steffy and she accepts, and after Steffy's divorce from Wyatt was finalized, Steffy & Liam got married in Sydney; Australia.|$|E

25|$|Highly anticipated, {{the album}} surpassed all {{commercial}} expectations. It debuted at number 1 on the Billboard Pop Albums Chart on October 8, 1976, becoming {{only the third}} album in history to achieve that feat and the first by an American artist (after British singer/composer Elton John's albums Captain Fantastic and the Brown Dirt Cowboy and Rock of the Westies, both in 1975). In Canada, the album achieved the same feat, entering at {{number one on the}} RPM national albums chart on October 16. Songs in the Key of Life spent thirteen consecutive weeks at number one in the U.S., and 11 during 1976. It was the album with the most weeks at number one during the year. In those eleven weeks, Songs in the Key of Life managed to block four other albums from reaching the top – in order, Boz Scaggs’s Silk Degrees, Earth, Wind & Fire's Spirit, Led Zeppelin's soundtrack for The Song Remains the Same and Rod Stewart's <b>A</b> <b>Night</b> <b>on</b> the Town. On January 15, 1977, the album finally dropped to number two behind Eagles' Hotel California and the following week it fell to number four. On January 29 it returned to the top for a fourteenth and final week. The album then began its final fall. It spent a total of 35 weeks inside the top ten and 80 weeks on the Billboard albums chart. Songs in the Key of Life also saw longevity at number one on the Billboard R/Black Albums chart, spending 20 non-consecutive weeks there.|$|E
25|$|On {{the night}} of March 4, 1866, Libelle struck the eastern reef of Wake Island during a gale. Commanded by Captain Anton Tobias, the ship was en route from San Francisco to Hong Kong. Among its {{passengers}} were the 50-year-old English-born opera singer Madame Anna Bishop (on {{the first leg of}} a Far East tour), her second husband and New York diamond merchant Martin Schultz, pianist and vocalist Charles Lascelles, Eugene Van Reed who was the first Consul General of the then independent Kingdom of Hawaii to the Court of the Emperor of Japan, and Imperial Japanese military officer Yabe Kisaboro. After <b>a</b> <b>night</b> <b>on</b> board the vessel now stuck on the reef, the passengers and crew reached the shore with very limited supplies such as some bedding, a barrel of beef, several bags of flour and some kegs of wine. After three days of searching and digging on the island for water the crew was able to recover a 200-gallon water tank from the wrecked ship. Valuable cargo was also recovered and buried on the island including some of the 1,000 flasks of mercury (quicksilver), as well as coins and precious stones valued at $93,943.08. After three weeks with a dwindling water supply and no sign of rescue, the passengers and crew decided to leave Wake and attempt to sail to Guam (the center of the then Spanish colony of the Mariana Islands) on the two remaining boats from Libelle. The 22 passengers and some of the crew sailed in the 22 foot longboat under the command of the first mate Rudolf Kausch and the remainder of the crew sailed with Captain Tobias in the 20 foot gig. On April 8, 1866, after thirteen days of frequent squalls, short rations, and tropical sun, the longboat reached Guam. The gig, commanded by the captain, was lost at sea.|$|E

After questioning, she later said that she would [...] "prefer to go out for <b>a</b> <b>night</b> <b>on</b> the town with Gazza and Chris Evans than meet [...] stars Gillian Anderson and David Duchovny".

500|$|The {{show was}} put out on a Friday, <b>a</b> <b>night</b> <b>on</b> which the WB had never {{broadcast}} before, at 8:00 pm, a time Oakley felt was inappropriate, and aired in front of The Wayans Bros., The Jamie Foxx Show and The Steve Harvey Show, all shows with which Oakley felt it was [...] "incompatible". The show's poor reviews and ratings of an average of 1.8 million led to its swift cancellation. Oakley concluded that the pair had been [...] "very naive" [...] with regard to producing the show, and that it [...] "would've been better on cable anyway because it would never have appealed to a broad enough audience due to the subject matter." [...] The 13 completed episodes were later aired on Cartoon Network's Adult Swim block and the show garnered a worldwide cult following. After lobbying from Oakley and Weinstein, the WB eventually released the series on DVD.|$|E

[...] As accommodation for ten men the [...] "living hut" [...] was small and cramped, and seemingly precarious—Bernacchi later described it as [...] "fifteen feet square, lashed down by cables to the rocky shore". The dogs were housed in kennels fashioned from packing cases. By 2 March the base, christened [...] "Camp Ridley" [...] after Borchgrevink's English mother's maiden name, was fully established, and the Duke of York's flag raised.

500|$|For Santopietro, Sinatra was the {{personification}} of America in the 1950s: [...] "cocky, eye on the main chance, optimistic, and full {{of the sense of}} possibility". Barbara Sinatra wrote that [...] "A big part of Frank's thrill was the sense of danger that he exuded, an underlying, ever-present tension only those closest to him knew could be defused with humor". [...] Cary Grant, a good friend of Sinatra's, stated that Sinatra was the [...] "most honest person he'd ever met", who spoke [...] "a simple truth, without artifice which scared people", and was often moved to tears by his performances. [...] Jo-Caroll Dennison commented that he possessed [...] "great inner strength", and that his energy and drive was [...] "enormous". A workaholic, he reportedly only slept for four hours <b>a</b> <b>night</b> <b>on</b> average. Throughout his life, Sinatra had mood swings and bouts of mild to severe depression, admitting to an interviewer in the 1950s that [...] "I have an over-acute capacity for sadness as well as elation". Barbara Sinatra stated that he would [...] "snap at anyone for the slightest misdemeanor", while Van Heusen said that when Sinatra got drunk it was [...] "best to disappear".|$|E
500|$|Walton's first {{work for}} full orchestra, Portsmouth Point (1925), {{inspired}} by a Rowlandson print of the same name, depicts a rumbustious dockside scene (in Kennedy's phrase, [...] "the sailors of H.M.S. Pinafore have had <b>a</b> <b>night</b> <b>on</b> the tiles") in a fast moving score full of syncopation and cross-rhythm that for years proved hazardous for conductors and orchestras alike. Throughout his career, Walton wrote works in this pattern, such as the lively Comedy Overture Scapino, a virtuoso piece commissioned by the Chicago Symphony Orchestra, described by The Musical Times as [...] "an ingenious blending of fragments in exhilarating profusion." [...] Walton's post-war works in this genre are the Johannesburg Festival Overture (1956), the [...] "diverting but hard-edged Capriccio burlesco" [...] (1968), and the longer Partita (1957), written for the Cleveland Orchestra, described by Grove as [...] "an impressively concentrated score with a high-spirited finale [...] steely counterpoint and orchestral virtuosity". Walton's shorter pieces also include two tributes to musical colleagues, Variations on a Theme by Hindemith (1963) and the Improvisations on an Impromptu of Benjamin Britten (1969), in both of which the source material is gradually transformed as Walton's own voice becomes more prominent. The critic Hugh Ottaway commented that in both pieces [...] "the interaction of two musical personalities is... fascinating".|$|E
500|$|Pierre has {{in retrospect}} labeled {{half of the}} album's writing as being {{completed}} while inebriated {{and the other half}} while getting sober. For example, he penned the lyrics to [...] "Attractive Today" [...] and [...] "Time Turned Fragile" [...] while drunk in his apartment, in a [...] "sad and lonely place." [...] In this approach, words mostly [...] "just came out," [...] and were not substantially revised. In addition, he was listening to the 2003 album Reconstruction Site by the Weakerthans, and found himself inspired by the songwriting of frontman John K. Samson. Pierre would often take lyrics from other bands songs for song titles; [...] "Time Turned Fragile" [...] is lifted from a lyric in Limbeck's [...] "Julia", while [...] "Together We'll Ring in the New Year" [...] was pulled from the Tom Waits song [...] "Please Wake Me Up". [...] "L.G. FUAD"—which stands for [...] "Let's Get Fucked Up and Die"—grew out of <b>a</b> <b>night</b> <b>on</b> Motion City Soundtrack's 2003 UK tour with The All-American Rejects, in which the latter band's merchandise manager was severely inebriated. He stood on the merchandise stand and shouted what became the song's refrain. All involved found great humor in the [...] "mantra", which went on to be printed on business cards as a joke. [...] "Hold Me Down" [...] was inspired by a former roommate of Pierre's. After she had moved out, Pierre found a portion of her math homework in a couch cushion, leading to him imagining a scenario of finding a letter from a departed lover.|$|E
