As a minimum, this could be through regular reporting of the biobanking activities. It was also proposed that research ethics committees could indicate when particularly vulnerable population groups are involved in research and request to be party to sample access decisions in those cases. Also, it should be possible for the people deciding on sample access to refer difficult secondary access proposals to the original research ethics committee that <b>approved</b> <b>sample</b> collection.

40|$|Eurycoma longifolia {{commonly}} known as “Tongkat Ali” in Malaysia is claimed to have aphrodisiac properties and has been widely used in Malay traditional medicine. An aphrodisiac {{is defined as a}} substance that increases sexual activity and libido and/or improves sexual performance. These claims have led to a vast number of “Tongkat Ali” products being marketed without proper authentication. There was therefore a need to characterize the proteins in these commercial Tongkat Ali herbal products using biomarkers to establish the authenticity of the claims. The important chemical components in Eurycoma longifolia are eurycomanol, eurycomanone and eurycomalactone. However they are not linked to the aphrodisiac properties, instead suspected to be protein base. In this study a total of 23 Ministry Of Health (MOH) approved and 6 non-MOH <b>approved</b> <b>samples</b> were sourced and screened for markers previously developed using two dimensional electrophoresi (2 -DE). The markers were denoted as A and B with appearances between 12 to 14 kDa in 2 -DE performed on IPG strips of 3 - 10 (7 cm) for the 1 st dimensional electrophoresis, while 12. 5 % homogenous gel was used for the 2 nd dimensional electrophoresis in silver stain. The results of the study confirmed that 18 of the 29 products tested were authentic with the presence of both biomarkers A and B, while 11 (a combination of both approved and non-MOH approved products) did not show presence of biomarkers. This enabled authentication of the products tested. The protein markers in addition to the existing chemical marker, Eurycomanone, may serve to be useful in authenticating genuine Tongkat Ali products...|$|R
40|$|The Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977 * defines {{respirable dust}} as dust {{measured}} with a device approved by the Secretary of Labor and the Secretary of Health and Human Services [30 USC 842 (e) ]. The <b>approved</b> <b>sampler</b> for respirable coal mine dust is the coal mine dust personal sampler unit (CPSU) [30 CFR 74; Jacobson 1971; Jacobson and Lamonica 1969]. The CPSU is generally called the 10 -mm nylon cyclone, although the 10 -mm nylon cyclone is actually just one component of the CPSU. The CPSU may either be mounted on a worker (with the sampling head positioned in the breathing zone for personal exposure monitoring) or in a fixed location for area sampling [Tomb 1990]. The CPSU consists of a pump unit, a sampling head assembly, and a battery charger if rechargeable batteries {{are used in the}} pump unit [30 CFR 74. 2]. The sampling head assembly contains two stages. The first stage is a 10 -mm nylon cyclone, which has collection characteristics similar to an elutriator. The amount of dust penetration depends on the flow rate [Jacobson and Lamonica 1969]. The second stage is a membrane filter (vinyl, pore size 5 pm) that collects the dust passing through the cyclone. The dust collected on the membrane filter is weighed to a precision (standard deviation) of 81 pg [Parobeck et al. 1981], and the respirable dust concentration in the mine atmosphere is then determined from the mass of dust collected and the volume of air sampled [Tomb 1990]...|$|R

40|$|A {{rapid and}} {{sensitive}} method {{for the analysis}} of Δ 9 - tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) in preserved oral fluid was developed and fully validated. Oral fluid was collected with the Intercept, a Food and Drug Administration (FDA) <b>approved</b> <b>sampling</b> device that is used on a large scale in the U. S. for workplace drug testing. The method comprised a simple liquid-liquid extraction with hexane, followed by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS-MS) analysis. Chromatographic separation was achieved using a XTerra MS C 18 column, eluted isocratically with 1 mM ammonium formate-methanol (10 : 90, v/v). Selectivity of the method was achieved by a combination of retention time, and two precursor-product ion transitions. The use of the liquid-liquid extraction was demonstrated to be highly effective and led to significant decreases in the interferences present in the matrix. Validation of the method was performed using both 100 and 500 μL of oral fluid. The method was linear over the range investigated (0. 5 - 100 ng/mL and 0. 1 - 10 ng/mL when 100 and 500 μL, respectively, of oral fluid were used) with an excellent intra-assay and inter-assay precision (relative standard deviations, RSD < 6 %) for quality control samples spiked at a concentration of 2. 5 and 25 ng/mL and 0. 5 and 2. 5 ng/mL, respectively. Limits of quantification were 0. 5 and 0. 1 ng/mL when using 100 and 500 μL, respectively. In contrast to existing GC-MS methods, no extensive sample clean-up and time-consuming derivatisation steps were needed. The method was subsequently applied to Intercept samples collected at the roadside and collected during a controlled study with cannabis. © 2005 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved.

Routine surveys in Bldgs. 3001, 3005, 3010, 3028, 3029, 3038, 3042, 3517, 4507, and 7500 continuously generate PPE. The waste is comprised of Tyvek coveralls, gloves, booties, Herculite, and other materials used to prevent worker exposure or the spread of contamination during routine maintenance and monitoring activities. This report describes the effort to collect and quantify removable activity that may be used by the ORNL S&M Project team to develop radiation instrumentation “screening criteria. ” Material potentially containing removable activity was collected on smears, including both masselin large-area wipes (LAWs) and standard paper smears, and analyzed for site-related constituents (SRCs) in an analytical laboratory. The screening criteria, if approved, may be used to expedite waste disposition of relatively clean PPE. The ultimate objectives of this effort were to: 1) determine whether screening criteria can be developed for these facilities, and 2) provide process knowledge information for future site planners. The screening criteria, if calculated, must be formally approved by Federal Facility Agreement parties prior to use for ORNL S&M Project PPE disposal at the Environmental Management Waste Management Facility (EMWMF). ORAU executed the <b>approved</b> <b>sampling</b> and analysis plan (SAP) (DOE 2013) while closely coordinating with ORNL S&M Project personnel and using guidelines outlined in the Waste Handling Plan for Surveillance and Maintenance Activities at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory, DOE/OR/ 01 - 2565 &D 2 (WHP) (DOE 2012).

40|$|This {{hazardous}} waste determination report (Report) describes {{the process and}} information used on the Hanford Site to determine that waste stream number NPFPDLZA, consisting of 30 containers of contact-handled transuranic debris waste, is not {{hazardous waste}} regulated by the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) or the New Mexico Hazardous Waste Act. For a waste to be hazardous under these statutes, the waste either must be specifically listed as a hazardous waste, or exhibit {{one or more of}} the characteristics of a hazardous waste, Le., ignitability, corrosivity, reactivity, or toxicity. Waste stream NPFPDLZA was generated, packaged, and placed into storage between 1993 and 1997. Extensive knowledge of the waste generating process, facility operational history, and administrative controls and operating procedures in effect at the time of generation, supported the initial nonhazardous waste determination. Because of the extent and reliability of information pertaining to this waste type, and the total volume of waste in the debris matrix parameter category, the Hanford Site is focusing initial efforts on this and similar waste streams for the first shipment to the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant (WIPP). RCRA regulations authorize hazardous waste determinations to be made either by using <b>approved</b> <b>sampling</b> and analysis methods or by applying knowledge of the waste in light of the materials or the process(es) used. This latter approach typically is referred to as process knowledge. The Transuranic Waste Characterization Quality Assurance Program Plan (CAO- 94 - 1010) for WIPP refers to acceptable knowledge in essentially the same terms; acceptable knowledge as used throughout this Report is synonymous with the term process knowledge. The 30 containers addressed in this Report were characterized by the following methods: Acceptable knowledge; Nondestructive examination using real-time radiography; Visual examination; and Headspace gas sampling and analysis. The initial nonhazardous waste determination was based solely on acceptable knowledge. Relevant administrative documents and operating methods in effect at the time of waste generation were reviewed, generator waste profiles and certifications were examined, and personnel interviews were conducted. The acceptable knowledge information and supporting data were further evaluated based on the results of nondestructive examination, visual examination, and container headspace gas analysis. In all cases, the physical examination processes supported the initial nonhazardous waste determination, and in effect served to validate and finalize that determination. Sections 2. 0 through 5. 0 of this Report describe in more detail the actions taken and conclusions reached with respect to this nonhazardous waste determination, The hazardous waste determination process described in this Report fully satisfies the requirements of 40 CFR 261, and the Memorandum of Agreement (MOA-June 16, 1999) signed by the U. S. Department of Energy (DOE) and the New Mexico Environment Department pertaining to the exchange of waste stream information...|$|R
40|$|Researoh in {{commercial}} {{education is a}} recognized need. The business demands of today {{are not the same}} as those of yesterday. The sooial demands for efficient cooperative action forces upon us of the teacher group the responsibility of improved methods of application in our teaching procedure, which in turn commands research in teaching results, measurements in teohnical application, and status studies to determine general and particular needs. This study is not a complete survey of all commercial education institutions in the state but an <b>approved,</b> fair, <b>sample</b> study of the present status of commercial education in the public secondary schools. It would have been impossible for the writer to have completed such study without the examination of reference material and a review of similar studies in other states, which are described in Chapter I. Since the data had to be obtained by questionnaire method, it would have been impossible to have made this research without the kind assistance of hundreds of coeducators throughout the state. To these assistants the writer is grateful. The names of all persons cooperating in this research cannot be given here, therefore it is the desire of the writer to mention none but to express to all, individually and en masse, a sincere appreciation. The writer admits no intention of an exhaustive survey but recommends in Chapter VI needed research and the various types most needed...|$|R
40|$|Determining {{the factors}} that hinder to the {{participation}} of target groups on specific activities {{used to be a}} subject of many researchs with the purpose of reducing to the investment risks of tourism SMEs which usually have limited economic opportunities and also increasing their market potential and customer satisfaction. In literature, there is a consensus about research data in leisure facilities can be adapted to the tourism industry in general. i This study was based on the model of “The Hierarchical Model Of Leisure Constraints ” developed by Jackson et al. ii and this Northern America origin model’s validity tried to be tested in Turkey. Akdeniz University, Manavgat Vocational College students were chosen as sample of the study. Those pregraduate education students having different personal, social, economic characteristics and coming from different counties and cities had been <b>approved</b> as suitable <b>sample</b> for the research. This paper is a pilot status of a similar and more comprehensive study of the same subject...|$|R
40|$|We {{estimate}} {{the impacts of}} being connected to politicians on occupational choice. We use an administrative dataset collected in 2008 - 2010 on 20 million individuals and rely on naming conventions to assess family links to candidates in elections held in 2007 and 2010. We first {{estimate the}} value of political connections by applying a regression discontinuity design to close elections in 2007. Those estimates likely combine the benefits from connections to current office-holders and the cost associated with being related to a losing candidate. We use individuals connected to successful candidates in the 2010 elections as control group and find that relatives of current office-holders {{are more likely to}} employed in better paying occupations. Relatives of candidates who narrowly lost in 2007 have lower occupations. A third-party randomly split our dataset in two and gave us sample 1. Once the review is completed, we will apply the <b>approved</b> methodology to <b>sample</b> 2...|$|R
