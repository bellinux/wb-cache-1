40|$|BackgroundFew data {{exist on}} clinical/imaging characteristics, management, and {{outcomes}} {{of patients with}} type <b>A</b> <b>acute</b> dissection and mesenteric malperfusion. MethodsPatients with type <b>A</b> <b>acute</b> dissection enrolled in the International Registry for Acute Dissection (IRAD) were evaluated to assess differences in clinical features, management, and in-hospital outcomes according to the presence/absence of mesenteric malperfusion. A mortality model was used to identify predictors of in-hospital mortality in patients with mesenteric malperfusion. ResultsMesenteric malperfusion was detected in 68 (3. 7 %) of 1809 patients with type <b>A</b> <b>acute</b> dissection. Patients with mesenteric malperfusion {{were more likely to}} be older and to have coma, cerebrovascular accident, spinal cord ischemia, acute renal failure, limb ischemia, and any pulse deficit. They were less likely to undergo surgical/hybrid treatment (52. 9 % vs 87. 9 %) and more likely to receive only medical (30. 9 % vs 11. 6 %) or endovascular (16. 2 % vs 0. 5 %) management (P < . 001). Overall in-hospital mortality was 63. 2 % and 23. 8 % in patients with and without mesenteric malperfusion, respectively (P < . 001). In-hospital mortality of patients with mesenteric malperfusion receiving medical, endovascular, and surgical/hybrid therapy was 95. 2 %, 72. 7 %, and 41. 7 %, respectively (P < . 001). At multivariate analysis, male gender (odds ratio [OR], 1. 7; P = . 002), age (OR, 1. 1 /y; P = . 002), and renal failure (OR, 5. 9; P = . 020) were predictors of mortality whereas surgical/hybrid management (OR, 0. 1; P = . 005) was associated with better outcome. ConclusionsType <b>A</b> <b>acute</b> aortic dissection complicated by mesenteric malperfusion is a rare but ominous complication carrying a high risk of hospital mortality. Surgical/hybrid therapy, although associated with 2 -fold hospital mortality, appears to be associated with better long-term outcomes in the management of type <b>A</b> <b>acute</b> aortic dissection in this setting...|$|R
