A section of another hydrophobic membrane filter (140) and a section of the latter filter lie opposite to each other at a distance (d) of not more than 1 mm, so that a gas bubble (210) moving with a medium (220), which flows in the inflow path, is in contact with the latter hydrophobic membrane filter during the movement.

40|$|High {{resolution}} Nusselt number (Nu) distributions {{were measured}} on the blade tip {{surface of a}} large, 1. 0 meter-chord, low-speed cascade representative of a high-pressure turbine. Data was obtained at a Reynolds number of 4. 0 × 105 based on exit velocity and blade axial chord. Tip clearance levels ranged from 0. 56 % to 1. 68 % design span or equally from 1 % to 3 % of blade chord. An infrared camera, looking through the hollow blade, made detailed temperature measurements on a constant heat flux tip surface. The relative motion between the endwall and the blade tip was simulated by a moving belt. The moving belt endwall significantly to shifts the region of high Nusselt number distribution and reduces the overall averaged Nusselt number on the tip surface by up to 13. 3 %. The addition of <b>a</b> <b>suction</b> <b>side</b> squealer tip significantly reduced local tip heat transfer and resulted in a 32 % reduction in averaged Nusselt number.

40|$|The {{suction side}} boundary-layer {{evolution}} in two ultra-high-lift low-pressure turbine blade cascades, {{characterized by the}} same Zweifel number but two different aerodynamic loading distributions, has been experimentally analyzed under steady and unsteady incoming flows. For the steady inflow case, <b>a</b> <b>suction</b> <b>side</b> boundary-layer separation has been detected for both cascades. Time-mean velocity and unresolved unsteadiness distributions have been exploited to survey {{the dynamics of the}} separated flow transition mode. The spectral analysis reveals that only the midloaded cascade is affected by a Kelvin–Helmholtz instability that induces the separated shear layer rollup, which provokes high losses. Results obtained for the unsteady case reveal that linear stability mechanisms drive the amplification of velocity fluctuations carried by wakes with dynamics similar to that haracterizing the steady inflow condition. A rollup vortex {{has been found to be}} generated for both cascades as a consequence of the wake–shear-layer interaction process. Different vortex dimensions have been recognized in the two cases, due to the different shear layer thicknesses at separation. The stronger and larger roll-up vortex characterizing the front-loaded cascade allows explaining the higher losses of this cascade, when it operates with unsteady inflow, as compared with the midloaded one...|$|E

40|$|This paper proposes {{the use of}} plasma {{actuator}} {{to suppress}} boundary layer separation on <b>a</b> compressor blade <b>suction</b> <b>side</b> to increase axial compressor performance. Plasma actuators are {{a new type of}} electrical flow control device that imparts momentum to the air when submitted to a high AC voltage at high frequency. The concept presented in this paper consists in the positioning of a plasma actuator near the separation point on <b>a</b> compressor rotor <b>suction</b> <b>side</b> to increase flow turning. In this computational study, three parameters have been studied {{to evaluate the effectiveness of}} plasma actuator: actuator strength, position and actuation method (steady versus unsteady). Results show that plasma actuator operated in steady mode can increase the pressure ratio, efficiency, and power imparted by the rotor to the air and that the pressure ratio, efficiency and rotor power increase almost linearly with actuator strength. On the other hand, the actuator&# 39;s position has limited effect on the performance increase. Finally, the results from unsteady simulations show a limited performance increase but are not fully conclusive, due possibly to the chosen pulsing frequencies of the actuator and/or to limitations of the CFD code...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe {{increase}} of the thrust/weight ratio of aircraft engines is extremely restricted by different 3 -D flow loss mechanisms. One {{of them is the}} corner separation that can form at the junction between <b>a</b> blade <b>suction</b> <b>side</b> and <b>a</b> hub or shroud. In this paper, in order to further investigate the turbulent characteristics of corner separation, large-eddy simulation (LES) is conducted on a compressor cascade configuration using NACA 65 blade profiles (chord based Reynolds number: 3. 82 × 105), in comparison with the previous obtained experimental data. Using the shear-improved Smagorinsky model as subgrid-scale model, the LES gives a good description of the mean aerodynamics of the corner separation, especially for the blade surface static pressure coefficient and the total pressure losses. The turbulent dynamics is then analyzed in detail, in consideration of the turbulent structures, the one-point velocity spectra, and the turbulence anisotropy. Within the recirculation region, the energy appears to concentrate around the largest turbulent eddies, with fairly isotropic characteristics. Concerning the dynamics, an aperiodic shedding of hairpin vortices seems to induce an unsteadiness of the separation envelope...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{presents}} a methodology {{developed for the}} design of optimized airfoils for stall regulated HAWTs. Given optimized lift and drag characteristics curves for maximum energy capture, the method focuses on the design of the corresponding profile shape. Although the problem is a multi-disciplinary one, the present design philosophy is based on a single-point approach, which, through an iterative procedure aims to achieve the best possible compromise of the imposed requirements. The adopted methodology is based on a combination of an inverse viscous and an inverse inviscid constituent. The viscous part provides <b>an</b> optimized <b>suction</b> <b>side</b> velocity distribution for a given Reynolds number. A compatible pressure side velocity distribution is then constructed for the given design lift coefficient. At a final stage the profile shape is provided by the inverse inviscid solver using an iterative procedure to effect profile closure automatically. The resulting profile performance is fully assessed using a direct viscous-inviscid interaction method. Four new profiles were designed. Three of them correspond to the hub, mid and tip sections of an optimized HAWT rotor. The fourth was designed for lower Reynolds number operation and was wind tunnel tested at Southampton University. The design philosophy, the new profiles and their characteristic curves are presented in Part 1 of the paper. The detailed characteristics of the optimized profiles are discussed in the companion Part 2 paper...|$|R

Operation of the pump creates <b>suction</b> (<b>a</b> lower pressure) at the <b>suction</b> <b>side</b> so that fluid can enter the pump through the inlet.

40|$|In {{order to}} obtain better performance, gas {{turbines}} always operate with high inlet temperature. This contributes to {{a high level of}} thermal load on the first stage vane endwall. To ensure safe operation of a gas turbine within a proper temperature range, the cooling performance of the vane endwall must be further investigated. In the present study, effects of the mainstream turbulence and upstream coolant flow direction on the endwall cooling and vane <b>suction</b> <b>side</b> surface phantom cooling were numerically investigated. Three-dimensional (3 D) Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes (RANS) equations combined with shear stress transport (SST) k-ω turbulence model were solved to conduct the numerical simulations on basis of the validated turbulence model. The calculated results indicate that both the adiabatic cooling effectiveness on the endwall and the phantom cooling effectiveness on the vane <b>suction</b> <b>side</b> surface are significantly influenced by slot injection angle. For α=- 30 °, the coolant injection is driven towards the vane <b>suction</b> <b>side,</b> which contributes to the lowest adiabatic cooling effectiveness level on the pressure side endwall and the highest phantom cooling effectiveness level on the vane <b>suction</b> <b>side</b> surface. With the increase of the slot injection angle, the adiabatic cooling effectiveness level on the pressure side endwall is enhanced significantly. In contrast, the phantom cooling (when the vane <b>suction</b> <b>side</b> is cooled by coolant originating from the endwall) of the vane <b>suction</b> <b>side</b> surface is reduced significantly. This is because a large slot injection angle leads to a large coolant momentum towards the pressure side. Moreover, the case with a smaller slot injection angle obtains a slightly higher area-averaged adiabatic cooling effectiveness level around the leading edge due to a relatively larger portion of coolant being confined near the leading edge. In addition, the inlet turbulence intensity has a small impact on the overall endwall cooling and the phantom cooling of the vane <b>suction</b> <b>side</b> surface compared to the slot injection angle...|$|R

40|$|International audienceA {{computational}} method is proposed to simulate 3 D unsteady cavitating flows in spatial turbopump inducers. It {{is based on}} the code FineTurbo, adapted to take into account two-phase flow phenomena. The initial model is a time-marching algorithm devoted to compressible flow, associated with a low-speed preconditioner to treat low Mach number flows. The presented work covers the 3 D implementation of a physical model developed in LEGI for several years to simulate 2 D unsteady cavitating flows. It is based on a barotropic state law that relates the fluid density to the pressure variations. A modification of the preconditioner is proposed to treat efficiently as well highly compressible two-phase flow areas as weakly compressible single-phase flow conditions.

The study consisted of three parts: 1) turbine blade span film-cooling, 2) turbine platform film-cooling, and 3) blade tip film-cooling. Pressure sensitive paint (PSP) technique was used to get the conduction-free film-cooling effectiveness distribution. Film-cooling effectiveness is assessed in terms of cooling hole geometry, blowing ratio, freestream turbulence, and coolant-to-mainstream density ratio. Blade span film-cooling test shows that the compound angle shaped holes offer better film effectiveness than the axial shaped holes. Greater coolant-to-mainstream density ratio prevents coolant to lift-off. Higher freestream turbulence causes effectiveness to drop everywhere except in the region downstream of <b>suction</b> <b>side.</b> Results are also correlated with momentum flux, compound shaped hole has the greatest optimum momentum flux ratio, and then followed by axial shaped hole, compound cylindrical hole, and axial cylindrical hole.
