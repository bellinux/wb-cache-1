5|$|Russia saw the Black Sea {{coast and}} {{the border with}} Turkey as {{invaluable}} strategic attributes of Georgia. Russia had more vested interests in Abkhazia than in South Ossetia, since the Russian military presence on the Black Sea coast was seen as vital to Russian influence in the Black Sea. Before the early 2000s, South Ossetia was originally intended {{as a tool to}} retain <b>a</b> <b>grip</b> <b>on</b> Georgia.|$|E

Berger won ahead {{of the new world}} champion Senna, Patrese, Prost, Martin Brundle and Modena. The McLaren Honda 1–2 also meant that they were now 11 points ahead of Williams Renault and had <b>a</b> <b>grip</b> <b>on</b> the Constructors' Championship.|$|E

25|$|The {{decision}} to allow military men and public officials to vote was also intended to secure <b>a</b> <b>grip</b> <b>on</b> elections. At the time, Groza's cabinet exercised complete control over public administration at central and local levels, and had taken charge of all communications between these and the population. Soviet sources cited PCR officials giving assurances that the respective categories were to provide as much as 1 million votes for the BPD.|$|E
25|$|A 2.8cm thick {{steel or}} {{fiberglass}} bar raised 2.5m above the landing area {{is all the}} gymnast has to hold onto as he performs giant swings or giants (forward or backward revolutions around the bar in the handstand position), release skills, twists, and changes of direction. By using all of the momentum from giants and then releasing at the proper point, enough height can be achieved for spectacular dismounts, such as a triple-back salto. Leather grips are usually used to help maintain <b>a</b> <b>grip</b> <b>on</b> the bar.|$|E
25|$|The {{stickiness}} of spiders' webs is {{courtesy of}} droplets of glue suspended on the silk threads. This glue is multifunctional– that is, its behavior {{depends on how}} quickly something touching it attempts to withdraw. At high velocities, they function as an elastic solid, resembling rubber; at lower velocities, they simply act as a sticky glue. This allows them to retain <b>a</b> <b>grip</b> <b>on</b> attached food particles. The web is also electrically conductive which causes the silk threads to spring out to trap their quarry, as flying insects tend to gain a static charge which attracts the silk.|$|E

Its length spans an octave on a grand piano. The sponge rubber bottom is sculpted so that its ends are slightly lower than its center, making the outer tones of the octave sound with greater force than the intermediary pitches. The pianist can thus rush headlong through fearfully rapid passages, precisely spanning an octave at each blow.|$|E
500|$|As of the 1840 census, the {{majority}} of the white residents of the state lived in western Virginia, but they were underrepresented in the legislature because of the continued property requirement for voting; not all held sufficient property to vote. This compounded their [...] dissatisfaction with the apportionment scheme adopted in 1830, which was based on counties rather than population, thus giving disproportionate power to the fewer, but propertied whites who lived {{in the eastern part of}} the state and kept <b>a</b> <b>grip</b> <b>on</b> the legislature. As the state legislature also elected the governor and lieutenant governor, and the United States senators, Western Virginians felt they had little influence on state leadership. [...] Their attempts to win electoral reform in the Virginia legislature were defeated each time. Some began to openly discuss the abolition of slavery or secession from the state. [...] Ultimately, the eastern planters could not continue to ignore their discontent, and a new constitutional convention was called to resolve the continuing tensions.|$|E
500|$|Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun Times {{described}} {{the film as}} being an [...] "extraordinary documentary," [...] and stated that the film was [...] "nothing at all like what" [...] he was expecting to see. Ebert dismissed reports that Jackson was in poor health and was underperforming, stating that the film did not show a [...] "sick and drugged man forcing himself through grueling rehearsals, but a spirit embodied by music" [...] and referred to Jackson's rehearsal performance(s) as having been [...] "something else." [...] Kirt Honeycutt of The Hollywood Reporter praised the film for being [...] "strange yet strangely beguiling" [...] for capturing Jackson in [...] "feverish grips of pure creativity" [...] and stated that while the film presents that audience with a screen filled with everyone ranging from [...] "performers, musicians, choreographers, crew members, craftsmen," [...] she took notice that the film had primarily focused on Jackson. Honeycutt perceived {{based on what he}} had seen from the behind-the-scenes look of rehearsals that he understood what it takes to [...] "attain such dizzying heights in entertainment" [...] and that he understood why Jackson [...] "chose to stay away" [...] from performing [...] "for a decade" [...] and, based on what he saw from footage from rehearsals that it [...] "looks like the world has missed one helluva concert." [...] Honeycutt cited that the only thing that frustrated him more than knowing the [...] "tragedy" [...] that prevented the concert from happening was [...] "not knowing what you're looking at" [...] and commented that the film did not feel like a complete concert film because it had <b>a</b> <b>grip</b> <b>on</b> the audience, stating: [...] "Where are Jackson and his conspirators at any given moment in the creative process? The film tries to be a concert film without having the actual footage. So when everything comes to a halt, audiences get thrown." [...] Peter Travers, of Rolling Stone described watching Jackson's [...] "struggle" [...] as being [...] "illuminating, unnerving and unforgettable" [...] and felt that the film was a great [...] "transcendent tribute" [...] to Jackson because it did not have, nor need, a [...] "safety net." ...|$|E

2500|$|During censorship, {{most of the}} nation's {{domestic}} dailies gave up {{the battle}} for press freedom. Their pages were [...] "filled with fawning accounts of national events, flattering pictures of Gandhi and her ambitious son, and not coincidentally, lucrative government advertising." [...] But two tough, prominent publishers of English language dailies, The Indian Express and The Statesman, fought courageously against Indira Gandhi's opposition of the Indian press. Despite some bold fights and stubborn stands taken up by these publishers, it was quite clear that Indira Gandhi had as strong <b>a</b> <b>grip</b> <b>on</b> the Indian press as she had on Indian politics, at least during the government-imposed emergency.|$|E

[...] An all-party group of Lords led by the former Archbishop of Canterbury, George Carey, said her [...] "irresponsible and inappropriate" [...] comments [...] "evoked a classic anti-Jewish conspiracy theory."
