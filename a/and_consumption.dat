The results from the Fisher statistic of both the Wald test and the Johansen test confirm {{the presence of a}} long-run relationship among the variables under investigation. The stability of estimated parameters has been tested, while Granger causality tests recommend a short-run unidirectional causality running from economic growth and combustible renewables <b>and</b> waste <b>consumption</b> to CO 2 emissions, a bidirectional causality between economic growth and combustible renewables <b>and</b> waste <b>consumption</b> <b>and</b> unidirectional causality running from economic growth and combustible renewables <b>and</b> waste <b>consumption</b> to international tourism. In the long-run, the error correction terms confirm the presence of bidirectional causality relationships between economic growth, CO 2 emissions, combustible renewables <b>and</b> waste <b>consumption,</b> <b>and</b> international tourism. Our long-run estimates show that combustible renewables <b>and</b> waste <b>consumption</b> increases international tourism, and both renewables <b>and</b> waste <b>consumption</b> <b>and</b> international tourism increase CO 2 emissions and output. We recommend that (i) Tunisia should use more combustible renewables and waste energy as this eliminates wastes from touristic zones and increases the number of tourist arrivals, leading to economic growth, and (ii) a fraction of this economic growth generated by the increase in combustible renewables <b>and</b> waste <b>consumption</b> should be invested in clean renewable energy production (i. e., solar, wind, geothermal) and energy efficiency projects...|$|R

Using wavelet analysis we find that in the short run there is feedback relationship between GNP <b>and</b> energy <b>consumption,</b> while in the long run GNP leads to energy consumption. Wavelet correlation between GNP <b>and</b> energy <b>consumption</b> is maximum at 3 rd time-scale(5 - 8 years) and this shows that GNP effects electricity consumption maximally around 5 - 8 years later in the long-run. We also find that the magnitude of the wavelet correlation changes based on time-scales for GNP <b>and</b> energy <b>consumption</b> <b>and</b> thus indicate that GNP <b>and</b> energy <b>consumption</b> are fundamentally different in the long run. ...|$|R

We use the Granger causality and the vector error correction model (VECM) to investigate both the short-run and the long-run dynamic relationship between these variables. The results from the panel Granger causality test indicate that in the short-run economic growth has a positive and statically significant impact on exports. However, there is no causal link between economic growth and combustible renewables <b>and</b> waste <b>consumption,</b> <b>and</b> between exports and combustible renewables <b>and</b> waste <b>consumption.</b> In the long-run, {{the results from the}} panel error correction model indicate that there is evidence of long-run causality from economic growth and exports to combustible renewables <b>and</b> waste <b>consumption</b> <b>and</b> from economic growth and combustible renewables <b>and</b> waste <b>consumption</b> to real exports. The policy implication of this finding is that combustible renewables and waste is not sufficiently used in private or public industrial sectors in emerging economies, <b>and</b> the <b>consumption</b> policy reserved for production encourages households to use fossil fuels or renewable energy. ...|$|R

The panel cointegration test results indicate that in the short-run there is a unidirectional causality running from real GDP per capita to per capita CO 2 emissions. However, {{there is evidence of}} no causality between combustible renewables <b>and</b> waste <b>consumption</b> <b>and</b> real GDP and between combustible renewables <b>and</b> waste <b>consumption</b> <b>and</b> CO 2 emissions. In the long-run, we find that there is evidence of a unidirectional causality running from CO 2 emissions and combustible renewables <b>and</b> waste <b>consumption</b> to real GDP. The results from panel FMOLS and DOLS estimates show that emissions is the most significant variable in explaining economic growth in the region which is followed by the consumption of combustible renewables and waste. In the long-run, increases in combustible renewables <b>and</b> waste <b>consumption</b> <b>and</b> emissions lead to increase economic growth. The finding of this paper is that North Africa region can use combustible renewables and waste as a substitutable energy to the fossil one and avoid the disaster on atmosphere by reducing emissions without impeding economic growth in the long-run. ...|$|R

Design/methodology/approach – The panel model was utilized taking the period 1980 - 2010. Findings – The results revealed that GDP by sector <b>and</b> energy <b>consumption</b> by type are cointegrated. Moreover, the Granger causality concluded a bi-directional causal relationship between oil, natural gas <b>and</b> renewable energy <b>consumption</b> <b>and</b> {{the value of the}} manufacturing, industrial and services sector. Furthermore, a bi-directional causal relationship was also found between coal <b>consumption</b> <b>and</b> the value of the services sector. Furthermore, a one-way causal relationship was found from oil consumption to the value of the agriculture sector, the value of the agriculture sector to coal <b>consumption,</b> <b>and</b> coal <b>consumption</b> to the value of the manufacturing and the industrial sectors. Practical implications – This study recommended that these countries should increase their renewable energy consumption to achieve their GDP growth. Originality/value – This study is different from the previous studies, as it disaggregated the GDP into four sectors, namely, agriculture, manufacturing, industrial and the services sector. In addition, this study will disaggregate energy consumption into oil consumption, gas <b>consumption,</b> coal <b>consumption</b> <b>and</b> electricity <b>consumption...</b>|$|R
