40|$|AbstractSoftware {{development}} {{based on}} the composition of black-box software like Web Services and Software Components is impeded by incompatibilities in their interfaces. Software adaptation {{has emerged as a}} solution to these incompatibilities by using processes in-the-middle (called adapters) that allow the correct interaction between the services. There are several approaches that focused on the automated generation of adapters guided by <b>adaptation</b> <b>contracts</b> which specify how the incompatibilities can be resolved. However, the generation of these contracts is not automated and most existing approaches require these contracts to be specified by hand, which obliges the designer to know all the service details. In this paper, we propose an approach to automatically generate <b>adaptation</b> <b>contracts</b> from the behavioral description of the services. These contracts overcome incompatibilities at signature and behavioral levels. Finally we present our prototype tool that accepts as input the service behaviors written in abstract BPEL and generates <b>adaptation</b> <b>contracts</b> using a combination of an A* algorithm and an expert system...|$|R

In this article, we propose a tool-based, interactive approach to support the contract design process. Method. Our approach includes: (i) a graphical notation to define port bindings, and an interface compatibility measure to compare protocols and suggest some port connections to the designer, (ii) compositional and hierarchical techniques to facilitate the specification of <b>adaptation</b> <b>contracts</b> by building them incrementally, (iii) validation and verification techniques to check that the contract will make the involved services work correctly and as expected by the designer.

40|$|AbstractSecurity is {{considered}} {{to be one of the}} main challenges as regards the widespread application of Service Oriented Architectures across organisations. WS-Security, and its successive extensions, have emerged to fulfil this need, but these approaches hinder the loose-coupling among services, therefore constraining their reusability and replaceability. Software adaptation is a sound solution to overcome the incompatibilities in interface, behaviour and security constraints among stateful services. However, programming adaptors from scratch is a tedious and error-prone task where special care must be given to concurrency and security issues. In this work, we propose to use security adaptation contracts that allow us to express and adapt the security requirements of the services and their orchestration. Given a security <b>adaptation</b> <b>contract</b> and the behavioural description of the services (such as BPEL processes or Windows Workflows), we can generate the protocol of the orchestrator that complies with the security requirements (confidentiality, integrity and authenticity), while overcoming incompatibilities at the signature, behaviour and security QoS levels. The formalisation behind security adaptation contracts has other applications such as security policy negotiation and automatic security protocol verification...|$|E
40|$|AbstractSecurity is {{considered}} one of the main challenges for software oriented architectures (SOA). For this reason, several standards have been developed around WS-Security. However, these security standards usually hinder interoperability, one of the main pillars of Web service technologies. Software adaptation is a sound solution where an adaptor is deployed in the middle of the communication to overcome signature, behavioural and QoS incompatibilities between services. This is particularly important when dealing with stateful services (such as Windows Workflows or WS-BPEL processes) where any mismatch in the sequence of messages might lead the orchestration to a deadlock situation. We proposed security <b>adaptation</b> <b>contracts</b> as concise and versatile specifications of how such incompatibilities must be solved. Nonetheless, synthesising an adaptor compliant with a given contract is not an easy task where concurrency issues must be kept in mind and security attacks must be analysed and prevented. In this paper, we present an adaptor synthesis, verification and refinement process based on security <b>adaptation</b> <b>contracts</b> which succeeds in overcoming incompatibilities among services and prevents secrecy attacks. We extended the ITACA toolbox for synthesis and deadlock analysis and we integrated it with a variant of CCS, called Crypto-CCS, to verify and refine adaptors based on partial model checking and logical satisfiability techniques...|$|R

The FLACOS workshop series initiated in 2007 as part of (and partially supported by) the Nordunet 32 project COSoDIS 3 (“Contract-Oriented Software Development for Internet Services"). The aim of the FLACOS series of workshops {{has always been to}} bring together researchers and practitioners working on formal approaches to deal with the different facets of contracts, from synthesis, transformation and refinement to the negotiation, analysis and monitoring of contracts. The program of the FLACOS’ 10 consisted of 6 regular papers, 6 short papers, and 3 invited papers. The papers were selected by the Programme Committee formed by Björn Bjurling (SICS, Sweden), Antonio Brogi (University of Pisa, Italy, co-chair), Giuseppe Castagna (University Paris 7, France), Suzanne Graf (VERIMAG, France), Alessio Lomuscio (Imperial College London, UK), Ugo Montanari (University of Pisa, Italy), Olaf Owe (University of Oslo, Norway), Gordon Pace (University of Malta, Malta), Ernesto Pimentel (Universidad of Malaga, Spain), Anders P.

Only a few papers were selected {{with the help of the}} Programme Committee, and finally only two papers were accepted for publication in this special issue. The first paper, A Trace-based Model for Multi-Party Contracts by Hvitved, Klaedtke and Zalinescu, is concerned with Multiparty contracts. The authors define a model for multi-party contracts in which contract conformance is defined abstractly as a property on traces. Besides it is introduced a contract specification language called CSL which overcomes limitations of previously proposed formalisms for specifying contracts. The approach is illustrated by formalizing various contracts from different domains in CSL.

For this increasingly prevalent but inadequately studied scenario, we propose plausible <b>adaptations</b> of several <b>contract</b> formats that have been widely studied in the dominant-manufacturer context. For both symmetric-k and asymmetric-k-knowledge situations, we present performance results of these contracts. Our results then reveal that the performance of these contract formats under our scenario differs considerably from what one would surmise from the well-known results published for closely related scenarios. For example, the widely studied buyback and revenue-sharing formats turn out to be largely ineffective when implemented by a dominant retailer. In contrast, the two-part tariff format performs well relative to the theoretically optimal "menu of contracts. " Our results highlight the need to study purchase contract formats designed specifically for dominant-retailer newsvendor-product channels. ...|$|R

Using a model developed by Baker, Gibbons and Murphy (2006) we calculate equilibria using the Folk theorem in order to determine which is the best allocation of decision rights. We find that the existing allocation of decision rights in the case we examine is efficient {{in the sense that it}} results into a second best allocation. Using the same modelling approach we present a second application on salmonella control related to end-feeding, that is, salmonella contamination of pork due to filled bellies of pigs fed for the last 12 hours before delivery.

40|$|AbstractIn component-based development, {{software}} components are taken as units of composition. Nevertheless, {{to achieve the}} widely disseminated status of components being plugged together as simple ‘Lego Pieces’, the integration of components must be carefully designed, systematised and verified; only this can ensure reliable architectures. In this work, we propose some conformance notions to predict the precise nature of some forms of composition, considering coordination patterns used in the integration. These notions are formalised {{in terms of the}} denotational semantics of the process algebra CSP, and assist the designer in common activities during integration, such as the substitution of component specifications by implementations, <b>contract</b> <b>adaptations,</b> and system extensions. To support mechanical verifications using FDR (a model-checker for CSP), we derive test characterisations from the denotational definitions of conformance. We illustrate the application of these notions through a systematic composition strategy of software frameworks, and we mechanically verify the preservation of behavioural component properties in these compositions. Moreover, we characterise the well-formedness of a coordination pattern used in this strategy at the design stage, before components are assembled...|$|R

Another theoretical interpretation is that <b>contract</b> <b>adaptations</b> may also reflect mutual learning process between contractors. Why transactors write explicit contract that they know cannot be court enforced? The central idea is that explicit contract terms makes it clearer to the transactors what has been agreed upon, thus are decreasing the cost of private enforcement sanctions (Klein, 1996). Empirical evidences are provided by the diachronic analysis of the full set of tri-partite contracts between one of the top-ten french large retailer and its beef suppliers before and after the BSE crisis (period 1993 - 1999). The analysis emphasizes also the role of this increased codification of supply contracts with a progressive change in the internal retailer's organization, i. e. increased centralization of decision and supervision mechanisms.

Others are more surface and the perceived benefits of the contract do not conflict with our core identity. This will determine if an individual is willing to sign a cultural contract or remain in conflict.

By analyzing this IBF literature, this study investigates and highlights some ignored aspects of IBF activities. Methodology: Academic IBF literature includes defending the plausibility of IBF as a part of Islamic economics; theoretical analysis regarding some advantages of IBF compared with conventional systems, suggesting some methods for performing IBF; and concentration on introducing fi nancial instruments and innovations in Islamic financial markets. After reviewing them, they are classifi ed as high ranking journal papers and graduate dissertations that were written on Islamic economics in I. R. Iran during the past three decades. Then they are analyzed via analytical methods and descriptive statistics to investigate the ignored aspects of IBF. Findings: Through this systemic study of Islamic banking, real and not skeletal <b>adaptation</b> of Islamic <b>contracts,</b> Islamic goals of Islamic economy, Islamic and ethical values, and justice and poverty reduction are some of the more important neglected aspects in IBF activities.

40|$|This master thesis {{builds on}} {{previous}} research by Argyres and Mayer (2007). They {{argue that a}} firm´s ability and capacity to perform tasks related to contractual work {{can be defined as}} contracting capabilities. These capabilities are a competitive advantage for firms and can enhance their performance. To my knowledge, no empirical studies on contracting capabilities are conducted with an attempt to measure a firm’s contracting capabilities. Research on how contracting capabilities can be developed is also limited. I therefore aim to fill this gap by investigating how contracting capabilities can be measured and developed. I also seek to examine the impact firm characteristics have on companies level of contracting capabilities. Additionally, I will investigate how contracting capabilities influence firm performance. This study has a quantitative approach in which key respondents were located by phone. The key respondents received an online questionnaire. Out of 147 Norwegian based export companies that {{agreed to participate in the}} study, I received 76 responses. The results show that contracting capabilities can be measured along four dimensions; term specification and writing, <b>contract</b> <b>adaptation,</b> internal organizing and relationship development and maintenance. Experience is positively associated with firms’ contracting capabilities. Contrary to my predictions, resource slack, age of firm, size of firm, internal consult, external consult and training shows no significant relationship with contracting capabilities.

40|$|OBJECTIVE [...] In many industrialised countries, {{health care}} third party payers are moving towards {{contracted}} provision arrangements with suppliers of hospital care. Essential {{to such a}} process is a standard approach to quantifying the care provided. This paper aims to outline the possible approaches to hospital product definition for the UK National Health Service, and recommends appropriate further research. METHODS [...] All published and unpublished studies on hospital output measurement in the NHS since 1980 were sought {{for the purposes of}} the review. This included both discursive and empirical work, and no exclusion criteria were applied. Most empirical reports on this topic, however, come from the United States. Consequently, the published reports since 1980 from the USA, accessed from the Medline and Healthplan CD-ROM databases, have also been included in the overview. CONCLUSIONS [...] Where data are sufficient, the true casemix approach offers advantages over other methods of output measurement. In the UK NHS, two systems [...] diagnosis-related groups (DRGs) and healthcare resource groups (HRGs) [...] are the only casemix measures that have achieved any significant degree of attention. DRGs have been extensively evaluated internationally, and explain variations in resource use in the UK slightly better than do HRGs. As a local product, HRGs can be more easily adapted to the specific needs of the NHS internal market, however, and will thus probably emerge as a better measure for the UK in the long term. In both cases, locally derived cost weights are unavailable, and their development constitutes a major requirement for use in <b>contracting.</b> <b>Adaptations</b> for long stay and outpatient hospital episodes would enhance the usefulness of hospital casemix systems in the NHS. Existing approaches, such as specialty based classifications, are neither standardised nor predictive of resource use, and would be better replaced by casemix systems. Other countries facing similar choices between casemix measurement approaches will need to consider the "trade off" between the adaptability of locally derived systems on the one hand and the low cost, rapidly accessible results, and availability of international comparative data of an imported approach on the other...|$|R
