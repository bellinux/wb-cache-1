500|$|Wilberforce {{used his}} {{speaking}} voice to great effect in political speeches; the diarist and author James Boswell witnessed Wilberforce's eloquence in the House of Commons and noted, [...] "I saw {{what seemed a}} mere shrimp mount upon the table; but <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>listened,</b> he grew, and grew, until the shrimp became a whale." [...] during the frequent government changes of 1781–1784, Wilberforce supported his friend Pitt in parliamentary debates.|$|E

"I {{listened to}} it on my crappy {{computer}} speakers and then I had to go find my headphones because as soon <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>listened</b> to a few bars, I had to listen more closely and I got chills. I remember where I was when I heard it and called my manager, Ann, and I was like, 'Do not let anyone else have this song! It’s my song.' In talking to Chris and Josh about it, they , 'We said we're either writing a song for Carrie Underwood or this song {{is never going to}} see the light of day.' It made me feel so good that they were thinking of me when they wrote it." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1906, Rischbieth {{and others}} founded the Children's Protection Society in Western Australia {{and joined the}} Women's Service Guilds of Western Australia in 1909. The Rischbieths {{travelled}} throughout Japan and India, and stayed in London during either 1908 or 1913. Women's suffrage was a dominant topic in Britain at this time; a mass rally, subsequent public debate and prosecutions of activists were occurring. The pacifist response to the Cat and Mouse Act in particular, fired {{a passion for the}} equality movement. After hearing Emily Pankhurst speak for the Women's Social and Political Union, she wrote to her sister, [...] "... <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>listened,</b> I felt my backbone growing longer, as though you gained courage and freedom from her".|$|E

60|$|It {{is a big}} one, looming in {{the starlight}} like a huge {{fragment}} of the darkness. The light comes from a single candle which shines through a window as the great shape swings by.

'And yet,' I {{felt myself}} {{constrained}} to say, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>listened</b> to these strange products of a Counter-reformation psychosis working upon a late medieval art form, 'and yet {{it does not}} matter that he's all in bits. The whole is disorganized. But each individual fragment is in order, is a representative of a Higher Order. The Highest Order prevails even in the disintegration. The totality is present even in the broken pieces. More clearly present, perhaps, than in a completely coherent work. At least you aren't lulled into a sense of false security by some merely human, merely fabricated order. You have to rely on your immediate perception of the ultimate order. So in a certain sense disintegration may have its advantages. But of course it's dangerous, horribly dangerous. Suppose you couldn't get back, out of the chaos...' ...|$|E
2500|$|Melba's first {{recordings}} {{were made}} around 1895, recorded on cylinders at the Bettini Phonograph Lab in New York. A reporter from Phonoscope magazine was impressed: [...] "The next cylinder was labelled 'Melba' and was truly wonderful, the phonograph reproducing her wonderful voice in a marvellous manner, especially the high notes which soared away above {{the staff and}} were rich and clear." [...] Melba was less impressed: [...] "'Never again,' I said to myself <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>listened</b> to the scratching, screeching result. 'Don't tell me I sing like that, or I shall go away and live on a desert island.'" [...] The recordings never reached the general public– destroyed on Melba's orders, it is suspected– and Melba would not venture into a recording studio for another eight years. Melba can be heard singing on several Mapleson Cylinders, early attempts at live recording, made by the Metropolitan Opera House librarian Lionel Mapleson in the auditorium there during performances. These cylinders are often poor in quality, but they preserve something {{of the quality of}} the young Melba's voice and performance that is sometimes lacking from her commercial recordings.|$|E
2500|$|In {{response}} to his opposition to decentralization, the Yugoslav government removed Ranković from office in 1966 on various claims, including that he was spying on Tito. The process began with Tito ordering {{the investigation of the}} UDBA, however one of the most vocal and outspoken condemnations of Ranković came from members within the League of Communists of Serbia that was considered too extreme of a condemnation by Tito who held them in dismay, and was deeply unpopular amongst Serbs, who in general were supportive of Ranković. The major condemnation came from within the League of Communists of Serbia and particularly its provincial branch in Kosovo, the League of Communists of Kosovo, whose report declared that the security forces in Kosovo under the leadership of Ranković actively persecuted those of Albanian nationality and said that [...] "The ideological foundation of such policy under the competence of Serbia is nationalism and chauvinism." [...] Upon listening at a meeting to the claims of Rankovic's abuse of power and abuse of Albanians as reported by Veli Deva, the Secretary of Kosovo's Regional Committee; Mihailo Švabić, a Serbian member of the LCS Central Committee famously said that he was [...] "ashamed - as a communist, as a Serb, and as a man - <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>listened</b> to the presentation of comrade Deva". Serbian Communist Spasenija Babović called for Ranković to be expelled from the party, and the LCS Central Committee agreed to this request.|$|E
50|$|I {{sing along}} to the track {{in the studio and}} record what happens to try out ideas. Often vocal harmonies come to me <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>listen</b> to the song in the car. I capture ideas with voice memo on my phone to {{remember}} harmony vocal ideas when I’m in the car.|$|R
60|$|You can {{conceive}} my emotion <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>listen</b> to this tale. I am {{like the}} poet's mice and men whose best-kid schemes have gone away. I am baffled. I am discouraged. I {{do not know}} what I shall do. I must find another plan, but I {{do not know what}}.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{have heard}} the cry. It rose, {{piercing}} and shrill, above the storm, [...] above the riving and rending of the bridge, above the downward [...] crashing of the logs and loosened stones. <b>I</b> hear it <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>listen</b> now.

60|$|But what is this? Even <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>listen</b> to them blithely, {{and turn}} towards Dot, {{for one last}} glimpse of a little figure very {{pleasant}} to me, she and the rest have vanished into air, and I am left alone. A Cricket sings upon the Hearth; a broken child's toy lies upon the ground: and nothing else remains.|$|R

5000|$|Stylistically, Michael Sweet has commented, that [...] "after {{years of}} {{speaking}} to fans and hearing comments like 'more guitars,' 'more solos' and 'more screams,' I {{decided to keep}} those suggestions in mind <b>as</b> <b>I</b> wrote each song. It {{was important to me}} to try to get back to that early sound of STRYPER yet at the same time, to remain relevant today. It's certainly not an easy thing to do, but <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>listen</b> to Murder by Pride, I think that was accomplished." ...|$|R
5000|$|In 1992, [...] "Easy Snappin'" [...] {{was used}} in a {{television}} commercial for jeans, but again, Beckford received no royalties. Although he performed on hundreds of popular records, the lack of financial reward received by Beckford was a constant complaint, as he said in 2000: [...] "Today <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>listen</b> to music on radio and sound system and recognise that I created some of these tunes.

5000|$|... "The Vineyard", {{the first}} single from Strange Bird, was {{released}} on 16 September 2002. The song features Box' piano throughout and was described by BMG Australia as a [...] "slice of delicious pop". The song received a common response to Augie March songs, with Impresss Jayson Argall writing that if he [...] "was at pains to try and define the song or decipher its meaning, then maybe his attention would be better directed elsewhere". Guitarist Adam Donovan felt similarly, but with the consolation that [...] "I've got {{a long time to}} live with it... I'm going to let it unravel <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>listen</b> to it more and more".|$|R
60|$|What a hoarse, clanging sound! <b>I</b> shivered <b>as</b> <b>I</b> {{stood there}} <b>listening</b> to its gloomy echoes until they died away. No one came.
