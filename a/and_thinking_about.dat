5|$|Considered the top {{high school}} player in the country, Bradley {{initially}} chose to attend Duke University {{in the fall of}} 1961. However, after breaking his foot in the summer of 1961 during a baseball game <b>and</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>about</b> his college decision outside of basketball, Bradley decided to enroll at Princeton due to its record in preparing students for government or United States Foreign Service work. He had been awarded a scholarship at Duke, but not at Princeton; the Ivy League does not allow its members to award athletic scholarships, and Bradley's family's wealth disqualified him from receiving financial aid.|$|E
5|$|The {{localization}} {{was done}} by the philosophy of keeping true to the spirit of the original Japanese, making dialogue sound like what a native speaker of English would say instead of strictly adhering the original's exact wording. The localization editor, Ben Bateman, did this by looking at the writing from a wider view, line by line or scene by scene rather than word by word or sentence by sentence, <b>and</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>about</b> how to convey the same ideas in English. Most parts of the game that include a joke in the localization also have a joke in the Japanese version, but a different one; Bateman did however try to make similar types of jokes, with similar contents and ideas. The game's use of Japanese language puns led to problems, as many of them relied on Japanese dialects to function; for these, Bateman replaced them with new puns in English. He was given mostly free rein in what he could change or add, as long as it did not disrupt the plot.|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{investigate}} the mediating role of pain intensity, catastrophic <b>thinking</b> <b>about</b> pain, <b>and</b> negative affectivity in explaining enhanced attention for pain {{in patients with}} fibromyalgia. METHODS: Sixty-four patients with fibromyalgia and 46 patients with chronic low back pain completed self-report instruments of vigilance to pain, negative affectivity, <b>and</b> catastrophic <b>thinking</b> <b>about</b> pain. These measures, along with diagnostic group and pain intensity, were entered into a partial correlational analysis to investigate which variables mediate the relationship between diagnostic group (fibromyalgia vs. chronic low back pain) and vigilance to pain. RESULTS: Fibromyalgia patients reported significantly greater vigilance to pain than patients with chronic low back pain. They also reported higher pain intensity, more negative affectivity, <b>and</b> more catastrophic <b>thinking</b> <b>about</b> pain than patients with chronic low back pain. Vigilance to pain was correlated significantly with pain intensity, negative affectivity, <b>and</b> catastrophic <b>thinking</b> <b>about</b> pain. Further analyses revealed that pain intensity <b>and</b> catastrophic <b>thinking</b> <b>about</b> pain, but not negative affectivity, mediated the relationship between diagnostic group and vigilance to pain. CONCLUSION: Fibromyalgia patients report a heightened vigilance to pain. This vigilance is not a unique characteristic of fibromyalgia but {{is related to the}} intensity of pain <b>and</b> catastrophic <b>thinking</b> <b>about</b> pain. status: publishe...|$|R

5|$|Children {{under five}} years old display the least {{effective}} strategies for delaying gratification, such as looking at the reward <b>and</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>about</b> its arousing features. By 5 years old, most children are able to demonstrate better self-control by recognizing the counter-productivity of focusing on the reward. Five-year-olds often choose instead to actively distract themselves or even use self-instructions to remind themselves of the contingency that waiting produces a reward of a greater value. Between 8 and 13 years old, children develop the cognitive ability to differentiate and employ abstract versus arousing thoughts in order to distract their minds from the reward and thereby increase the delay. Once delaying strategies are developed, the capacity to resist temptation is relatively stable throughout adulthood. Preschoolers' performance on delayed gratification tasks correlates with their adolescent performance on tasks designed to measure similar constructs and processing, which parallels the corresponding development of willpower and the fronto-striatal circuit (neural pathways that connect the frontal lobe to other brain regions). Declines in self-regulation and impulse control in old age predict corresponding declines in reward-delaying strategies, specifically reduced temporal discounting due to a decrease in cooling strategies.|$|E

25|$|The {{development}} of time-sharing systems {{led to a}} number of problems. One was that users, particularly at universities where the systems were being developed, seemed to want to hack the system to get more CPU time. For this reason, security and access control became a major focus of the Multics project in 1965. Another ongoing issue was properly handling computing resources: users spent most of their time staring at the terminal <b>and</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>about</b> what to input instead of actually using the resources of the computer, and a time-sharing system should give the CPU time to an active user during these periods. Finally, the systems typically offered a memory hierarchy several layers deep, and partitioning this expensive resource led to major developments in virtual memory systems.|$|E
25|$|The {{human need}} for art, on this view, {{stems from the}} need for {{cognitive}} economy. A concept is already a sort of mental shorthand standing for {{a large number of}} concretes, allowing a human being to think indirectly or implicitly of many more such concretes than can be held explicitly in mind. But a human being cannot hold indefinitely many concepts explicitly in mind either—and yet, on the Objectivist view, needs a comprehensive conceptual framework to provide guidance in life. Art offers {{a way out of this}} dilemma by providing a perceptual, easily grasped means of communicating <b>and</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>about</b> a wide range of abstractions, including one's metaphysical value-judgments. Objectivism regards art as an effective way to communicate a moral or ethical ideal. Objectivism does not, however, regard art as propagandistic: even though art involves moral values and ideals, its purpose is not to educate, only to show or project. Moreover, art need not be, and usually is not, the outcome of a full-blown, explicit philosophy. Usually it stems from an artist's sense of life (which is preconceptual and largely emotional).|$|E
25|$|The {{series is}} {{localized}} by Aksys Games; Chunsoft {{was first introduced}} to Aksys through Spike, when Chunsoft {{was looking for a}} company that could publish the first game in the United States. During Aksys' evaluation period of it, many people at the company did not believe in the game and turned it down; as {{many of the people who}} evaluate games at Aksys do not speak Japanese, it was difficult for them to determine whether a game was good or not. Eventually, they decided to localize it, which was considered a big risk for the company. They worked by the philosophy of keeping true to the spirit of the original Japanese version, opting to make dialogue sound like what a native speaker would say rather than strictly adhering to the Japanese wording. Ben Bateman, the editor of the first two games' localizations, did this by looking at the writing from a wider view, examining it line by line or scene by scene, rather than word by word or sentence by sentence, <b>and</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>about</b> how to convey the same idea in English. Most parts of the games that include a joke in the localization also have a joke in the Japanese versions, but a different one; Bateman did try to make similar types of jokes with similar contents and ideas. He was given mostly free rein in what he could change or add to the writing, as long as it did not disrupt the plot.|$|E

500|$|Dawson did biographical {{research}} {{in order to}} develop the novel. Though she is interested in writing biography, she finds that novels are an easier genre to express her understanding of the historical individual. When writing her historical novels Dawson does not embark on a thorough bout of research beforehand, instead she researches as she writes. While researching the novel, Dawson read nine biographies of Brooke, finding different elements of his life in each one, and felt that she had an additional understanding of Brooke which need to be expressed. [...] Dawson includes an extensive bibliography {{in the back of the}} novel showing where passages and ideas in the novel are from.

500|$|Enough Said was {{the fifth}} film written and {{directed}} by Nicole Holofcener. After the release of her fourth film, Please Give (2010), she was approached by Matthew Greenfield and Claudia Lewis from Fox Searchlight, who offered to produce Holofcener's next project on the condition that it was more mainstream than her previous films. She wrote three drafts of the screenplay over six months. The premise was partly inspired by Holofcener's own life as a divorced mother of two teenagers and her [...] "feelings and fears about what [...] life will be like when [...] kids go away". While writing the film, she said, [...] "I was having thoughts about my ex-husband and my new boyfriend <b>and</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>about</b> being married and how I'm trying to have a relationship that's happier the second time."

500|$|Before {{he formed}} The Boxmasters, {{frontman}} Thornton {{had played in}} two cover bands, worked as a roadie, and released four solo albums. After listening to [...] "Yesterday's Gone" [...] by Chad & Jeremy <b>and</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>about</b> covering it in a hillbilly music style, he had {{the idea of making}} Americanized version of British Invasion pop songs. During its early days, the band played several live shows in the California area, as well as in Tecate, Mexico. From mid-2008 to late 2008, the group embarked on a tour across the United States, ending in Los Angeles. It also played for the March 2009 South by Southwest conference. The group went on to play in Canada in early 2009. In the aftermath of a controversial interview on the CBC Radio One program Q in early-April 2009, in which Thornton labeled his Canadian audience 'mashed potatoes with no gravy', the band stopped its Canadian tour early. It resumed touring in mid-April 2009 in the United States.|$|E
500|$|A {{pneumatic}} value {{failure in}} the preceding race, the United States Grand Prix, had forced Häkkinen to retire from the Grand Prix. With two races of the season remaining and an eight-point deficit after losing {{the lead in the}} Drivers' Championship, Häkkinen remained confident about his title chances: [...] "I know that what happened to me in the last Grand Prix, when I had to retire, can happen to anyone, It could happen to Michael. So I am very optimistic. I have come here prepared <b>and</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>about</b> these two races together. Not one, two." [...] Michael Schumacher emphasised the pressure of leading the championship going into Japan: [...] "It hasn't been a relaxing time at all and I still haven't completely got over the jetlag from the States. But I'm prepared to sacrifice this and a lot more to bring the title back to Maranello. And {{the same can be said}} of the entire team."

500|$|Synchrony and diachrony, or statics and dynamics, within {{social theory}} are terms that {{refer to a}} {{distinction}} emerging out {{of the work of}} Levi-Strauss who inherited it from the linguistics of Ferdinand de Saussure. The former slices moments of time for analysis, thus it is an analysis of static social reality. Diachrony, on the other hand, attempts to analyse dynamic sequences. Following Saussure, synchrony would refer to social phenomena as a static concept like a language, while diachrony would refer to unfolding processes like actual speech. In Anthony Giddens' introduction to Central Problems in Social Theory, he states that, [...] "in order to show the interdependence of action and structure ... we must grasp the time space relations inherent in the constitution of all social interaction." [...] And like structure and agency, time is integral to discussion of social reproduction. In terms of sociology, historical sociology is often better positioned to analyse social life as diachronic, while survey research takes a snapshot of social life and is thus better equipped to understand social life as synchronized. Some argue that the synchrony of social structure is a methodological perspective rather than an ontological claim. Nonetheless, the problem for theory is how to integrate the two manners of recording <b>and</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>about</b> social data.|$|E
