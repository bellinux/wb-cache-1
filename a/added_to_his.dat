5|$|England never seriously {{threatened}} {{to reach the}} victory target of 442 runs, which would have comfortably broken the world record for a fourth-innings run chase. Allan Lamb <b>added</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> reputation for mastering fast bowling with a defiant 113, but it was sizeable contributions from the tail and extras that took England to a respectable total of 307 – but a bad defeat by 134 runs.|$|E
5|$|In {{baseball}} statistics tie-breakers {{count as}} regular season games, with all events in them added to regular season statistics. For example, the Chicago Sun-Times noted that Sammy Sosa could have <b>added</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> notable home run total in the game. Sosa did {{add to his}} league-leading strikeout total with one in the 4th inning. Beck also <b>added</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> league-leading total in games played and earned his 51st save of the season which finished 2nd to Trevor Hoffman's 53 but is tied for the 9th highest single-season save total in MLB history. Several Cubs and Giants won awards for their regular season performances including Rookie of the Year honors for Kerry Wood, a Silver Slugger Award for Sosa, and a Rawlings Gold Glove Award for J. T. Snow. Sosa also won the Most Valuable Player award, earning 30 out of 32 first place votes (with McGwire taking the remaining 2).|$|E
5|$|Like most Austrian generals of the French Revolutionary Wars, {{he joined}} the {{military}} as a young man, and served in the War of Bavarian Succession, in which he took part in its first action by successfully repelling a Prussian border raid, which earned him the admiration of the Empress Maria Theresa's son, Joseph. His continued success in the Habsburg border wars with the Ottoman Empire <b>added</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> reputation as a commander.|$|E

5|$|As his {{businesses}} grew, he <b>added</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> {{fleet of}} ships, big ones to ship salmon to San Francisco and smaller ones for shallow waters and for towing larger ships {{in and out}} of the Rogue mouth. In 1879 he bought the steamer Varuna and the tug Mary Hume and started a shipyard at Ellensburg. In 1880 he added the steam schooner Mary D. Hume, the tug Pelican in 1883, the schooner Berwick in 1887, the steamer Thistle in 1888, and replacement craft in subsequent years. Returning ships brought goods for Hume's general store.|$|E
5|$|From about 627 onwards, Edwin was {{the most}} {{powerful}} king among the Anglo-Saxons, ruling Bernicia, Deira and much of eastern Mercia, the Isle of Man, and Anglesey. His alliance with Kent, the subjection of Wessex, and his recent successes <b>added</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> power and authority. The imperium, as Bede calls it, that Edwin possessed was later equated {{with the idea of}} a Bretwalda, a later concept invented by West Saxon kings in the 9th century. Put simply, success confirmed Edwin's overlordship, and failure would diminish it.|$|E
5|$|Further {{back in the}} field, Max Verstappen overtook Nasr and Button to {{move into}} twelfth place on laps 44 and 46 respectively. However, he was deemed to have forced Button wide and was handed a five-second penalty to be <b>added</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> {{finishing}} time. Lap 53 saw Romain Grosjean move into the final point scoring position of tenth by passing Carlos Sainz Jr. into turn eight. Just one lap later, he took ninth place from Daniil Kvyat. At the front, Hamilton proved unable to reach his teammate, who took the checkered flag for his sixth win of the season. Kimi Räikkönen completed the podium, followed by Vettel, Pérez and Ricciardo.|$|E

5|$|He {{published}} for {{the first}} time under his own name in 1829. Les Chouans, a novel about royalist forces in Brittany, did not succeed commercially, but it made Balzac known in literary circles. He achieved a major success later the same year when he published La Physiologie du mariage, a treatise on the institution of marriage. Bolstered by its popularity, he <b>added</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> fame by publishing a variety of short stories and essays in the magazines Revue de Paris, La Caricature, and La Mode. He thus made connections in the publishing industry that later helped him to obtain reviews of his novels.|$|E
5|$|In 1992, {{three years}} after his Oscar win, The Last of the Mohicans was released. Day-Lewis's {{character}} research for this film was well-publicised; he reportedly underwent rigorous weight training and learned to live off the land and forest where his character lived, camping, hunting and fishing. Day-Lewis also <b>added</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> wood-working skills and {{learned how to make}} canoes. He carried a long rifle at all times during filming to remain in character and learned how to skin animals.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, the Seljuq Zengi, Atabeg of Mosul, had <b>added</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> rule in 1128 Aleppo, the key {{to power}} in Syria, contested between the rulers of Mosul and Damascus. Both Zengi and King Baldwin II turned their {{attention}} towards Damascus; Baldwin was defeated outside the great city in 1129. Damascus, ruled by the Burid Dynasty, later allied with King Fulk when Zengi besieged the city in 1139 and 1140; the alliance was negotiated by the chronicler Usamah ibn Munqidh.|$|E

5|$|Mertens <b>added</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> {{silverware}} at {{the start}} of the following season as PSV beat Ajax 4–2 to lift the Johan Cruyff Shield. On 30 September 2012, Mertens and Jürgen Locadia, who was making his Eredivisie debut, both scored hat-tricks as PSV defeated VVV-Venlo 6–0. Mertens ultimately scored 14 league goals, and 16 across all competitions as PSV ended the season as runners-up to Ajax in the Eredivisie. He also aided his side's cause with a further 17 assists. It would be his final season in the Eredivisie, however, as at the conclusion of the campaign PSV accepted an offer from Serie A side Napoli for his signature. Mertens departed Eindhoven having made 88 appearances and scored 45 goals over the course of two seasons.|$|E
5|$|Selwood {{finished}} the season ranked first among all first–year players in several major statistical categories; total possessions (405), disposals per game (19.3), kicks (216), handpasses (189), marks (109), tackles (94)—the most ever by any first–year AFL player—and tackles per game (4.5). His 23score assists {{during the season}} also ranked him within the top ten in the league. Selwood <b>added</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> list of firstyear honours at season's end with the Geelong Football Club Best First Year Player Award, along with a top 20 placing in the Club Champion award. He also received several media endofyear sporting awards.|$|E
5|$|There {{was some}} {{specific}} work {{required by the}} make-up department on Brent Spiner as during those flashbacks he was made to look younger which the team created by dying his hair darker and applying more youthful make-up. Also, the team added several different appliances to Kris Iyer to show his character go {{through a series of}} levels of infection of a number of diseases at the hands of Soong. These included colored contact lenses, prosthetics to make his veins appear to pulse and gel was <b>added</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> eyes to make them bloodshot.|$|E

Parry moved in with his wife, mother and sister, and employed two servants; by 1871, two domestic workers had been <b>added</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> household. Parry died in 1879 followed by his wife, Henrietta, in 1882.|$|E
5|$|Thorpe's {{homosexual}} {{activities from}} time to time {{came to the attention of}} the authorities, and were investigated by the police; information was <b>added</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> MI5 file, but in no case was action taken against him. In 1971 he survived a party inquiry after a complaint against him by Norman Scott, a riding instructor and would-be model. Scott maintained that in the early 1960s he had been in a sexual relationship with Thorpe, who had subsequently mistreated him. The inquiry dismissed the allegations.|$|E
5|$|Although {{rain fell}} on Saturday morning, the track had dried by {{the start of}} the final free {{practice}} session. Lewis Hamilton again set the fastest time with 1:25.624, less than two-tenths of a second in front of teammate Rosberg, with Sebastian Vettel in third position close behind. The fastest times had been set on the super-soft tyre compound. However, Mercedes's advantage over Ferrari proved more significant, up to seven-tenths of a second on the harder soft compound, the tyre most likely {{to be used in the}} race. Toro Rosso confirmed their good pace for the weekend with fourth and sixth place for Carlos Sainz and Max Verstappen respectively, being about half a second quicker than their sister team, Red Bull Racing. A major incident occurred just seconds after the beginning of the practice session, when Rio Haryanto and Romain Grosjean collided in the pit lane. Both cars needed to equip new front wings and Haas also changed the floor on Grosjean's car. Haryanto was later issued a three-place grid penalty for the incident, as well as two penalty points <b>added</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> licence.|$|E

5|$|Cleveland next {{faced the}} Dons in Los Angeles. The Dons, who had handed the Browns their only {{loss of the}} season in October, scored a field goal and {{touchdown}} in the first quarter. The Browns responded with a touchdown run from Motley later in the quarter and led by four points at halftime after Tommy Colella caught a pass from Graham for another touchdown in the second period. Cleveland built on the lead in the third quarter with a long touchdown pass to Lew Mayne. Speedie sealed the victory for the Browns when he intercepted a backward lateral pass by Dons quarterback Chuck Fenenbock and ran it back 12 yards for a touchdown with four minutes left in the game. Los Angeles threatened to score numerous times, but Cleveland's defense held. The Browns forced the Dons to punt three times from within their own 10-yard line. Graham had 240 yards of passing. His two touchdown passes <b>added</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> league-leading total of 22 on the season. Tackle Lou Saban continued to handle placekicking duties for the Browns as Groza sat out with an injury.|$|E
5|$|Earp moved {{constantly}} {{throughout his}} life from one boomtown to another. He left Dodge City in 1879 and moved to Tombstone with his brothers James and Virgil, where a silver boom was underway. There, the Earps clashed with a loose federation of outlaws known as the Cowboys. Wyatt, Virgil, and their younger brother Morgan held various law-enforcement positions that put them in conflict with Tom and Frank McLaury, and Ike and Billy Clanton, who threatened on several occasions to kill the Earps. The conflict escalated over the next year, culminating on October 26, 1881, in the gunfight at the O.K. Corral, in which the Earps and Holliday killed three of the Cowboys. In the next five months, Virgil was ambushed and maimed, and Morgan was assassinated. Pursuing a vendetta, Wyatt, his brother Warren, Holliday, and others formed a federal posse that killed three of the Cowboys whom they thought responsible. Wyatt was never wounded {{in any of the}} gunfights in which he took part, unlike his brothers Virgil and James, or his friend Doc Holliday, which only <b>added</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> mystique after his death.|$|E
5|$|Germanicus (Latin: Germanicus Julius Caesar; 24 May 15 BC – 10 October AD 19) was {{a member}} of the Julio-Claudian dynasty and a {{prominent}} general of the Roman Empire known for his campaigns in Germania. The son of Nero Claudius Drusus and Antonia Minor, Germanicus was born into a prominent branch of the patrician gens Claudia. The agnomen Germanicus was <b>added</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> full name in 9 BC when it was posthumously awarded to his father in honor of his victories in Germania. In AD 4, he was adopted by his paternal uncle, Tiberius who succeeded Augustus as Roman emperor a decade later. As a result, Germanicus became an official member of the gens Julia, another prominent family which he was related to on his mother's side. His connection to the Julii was further consolidated through a marriage between himself and Agrippina the Elder, a granddaughter of Augustus.|$|E
