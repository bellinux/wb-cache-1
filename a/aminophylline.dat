50|$|Older {{research}} on adenosine receptor function, and non-selective adenosine receptor antagonists such as <b>aminophylline,</b> focused {{mainly on the}} role of adenosine receptors in the heart, and led to several randomized controlled trials using these receptor antagonists to treat bradyasystolic arrest.|$|E
50|$|Adenosine is an {{endogenous}} extracellular messenger {{that can}} regulate myocardial oxygen needs. It acts through cellular surface receptors which effect intracellular signalling pathways to increase coronary artery blood flow, slow heart rate, block atrioventricular node conduction, suppress cardiac automaticity, and decrease β-adrenergic effects on contractility. Adenosine also antagonizes chronotropic and ionotropic effects of circulating catecholamines. Overall, adenosine decreases the heart’s rate and force of contraction, which increases blood {{supply to the}} cardiac muscle. Given specific circumstances this mechanism (which is intended to protect the heart) may cause atropine-resistant refractory bradyasystole. Adenosine's effects are concentration-dependent. Adenosine’s receptors are competitively antagonized by methylxanthines such as <b>aminophylline.</b> <b>Aminophylline</b> competitively antagonizes the cardiac actions of adenosine at the cell surface receptors. Thus, it increases heart rate and contractility.|$|E

50|$|The {{following}} precautions {{should be}} kept in mind in the treatment of anticholinesterase poisoning, although they do not bear directly on the use of pralidoxime: since barbiturates are potentiated by the anticholinesterases, they should be used cautiously in the treatment of convulsions; morphine, theophylline, <b>aminophylline,</b> succinylcholine, reserpine, and phenothiazine-type tranquilizers should be avoided in patients with organophosphate poisoning.|$|E
50|$|Methylated xanthines (methylxanthines), {{which include}} caffeine, <b>aminophylline,</b> IBMX, paraxanthine, pentoxifylline, theobromine, and theophylline, affect {{not only the}} airways but stimulate heart rate, force of contraction, and cardiac arrhythmias at high concentrations.

50|$|Treatment {{is mainly}} symptomatic. Local pain is treated by injecting {{dehydroemetine}} {{at the site}} of the sting. Hypovolaemia is corrected by oral rehydration solution. Agitated, confused and non-cooperative patients are given a 5% dextrose saline drip. Patients with hypertension on admission are given a single dose of 5 mg sublingual nifedipine and oral prazosin. The blood pressure in patients with hypertension is controlled with sublingual nifedipine alone. Patients with pulmonary oedema are propped up and given intravenous <b>aminophylline,</b> intravenous sodium bicarbonate, oral prazosin, and oxygen by mask.|$|E
50|$|The {{first step}} in {{managing}} cardiac syndrome X is the administration of nitrates which relieve the chest pain.

40|$|AbstractObjectives. This study {{sought to}} {{evaluate}} the effect of adenosine receptor blockade by <b>aminophylline</b> on cardiac functional reserve in patients with syndrome X. Background. <b>Aminophylline</b> may have a potentially antiischemic effect through the inhibition of adenosine and, thus, the coronary steal phenomenon in patients with syndrome X. Methods. A single-blind, placebo-controlled study of an intravenous infusion of <b>aminophylline</b> (6 mg/kg body weight over 15 min) or placebo (20 ml of saline solution over 15 min) was performed during continuous radionuclide monitoring of left ventricular ejection fraction in 12 patients performing supine bicycle ergometric exercise. Results. <b>Aminophylline</b> increased exercise time (<b>aminophylline</b> 400 s vs. placebo 355 s, p < 0. 01), decreased degree of ST segment depression (<b>aminophylline</b> 1. 6 mm vs. placebo 2. 4 mm, p < 0. 01) and either abolished (seven patients) or diminished (five patients) chest pain during exercise. <b>Aminophylline</b> also increased left ventricular ejection fraction at rest (<b>aminophylline</b> 66. 5 % vs. placebo 62. 3 %, p < 0. 05) but did not improve its deterioration at peak exercise (<b>aminophylline</b> 60. 1 % vs. placebo 56. 6 %, p = NS) or shorten the abnormally prolonged interval {{between the end of}} exercise and the overshoot (<b>aminophylline</b> 115 s vs. placebo 130 s, p = NS). Conclusions. <b>Aminophylline</b> infusion increases ischemic threshold and prolongs exercise duration in patients with syndrome X. It is hypothesized that <b>aminophylline</b> acts by inhibiting the coronary steal phenomenon through adenosine receptor blockade. It does not improve the deterioration in left ventricular function at peak exercise or the delayed response in ejection fraction in the recovery period. presumably because the beneficial effects of <b>aminophylline</b> s at result from the redistribution of coronary blood flow are limited...|$|E
40|$|Background: The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to assess the safety and preventative effects of <b>aminophylline</b> on the incidence of chronic lung disease (CLD) in very premature infants. Methods: This was a long follow-up randomized clinical trial. The prophylactic effect of <b>aminophylline</b> on the incidence of CLD was investigated in very premature infants. The study group received <b>aminophylline</b> for the 1 st 10 days of life and control infants received no <b>aminophylline</b> during the 1 st 10 days of life. Results: Fifty-two infants participated (26 <b>aminophylline,</b> 26 controls). Premature infants on <b>aminophylline</b> had clearly shorter oxygen dependency time than those in the control group. Median time of oxygen dependency was 3 (0 - 9. 5) days and 14 (3 - 40. 5) days in group A and C, respectively (P: 0. 001). Incidence of CLD was significantly different between the two groups. Only two infants (8. 7 %) on <b>aminophylline</b> developed CLD, when compared to 11 infants (44. 0 %), who did not receive <b>aminophylline</b> (P: 0. 006). No side-effects were reported in the neonates (P: 1). Conclusions: This study supports the preventative effects of <b>aminophylline</b> on the incidence of CLD in very premature infants.

40|$|In {{an attempt}} to explain the {{clinical}} efficacy of <b>aminophylline,</b> we studied its effect on diaphragmatic function in eight normal subjects. The relation between the electrical activity of the diaphragm and the pressure generated by the diaphragm was assessed during voluntary contractions before and after <b>aminophylline</b> infusion. <b>Aminophylline</b> shifted the electrical activity/pressure curve to the left; the pressure at a given electrical activity increased an average of 15 per cent (P less than 0. 001). In four subjects, pressure was also measured during stimulation of the phrenic nerve at various frequencies before and after diaphragmatic fatigue was produced by resistive breathing, with and without <b>aminophylline</b> infusion. Pressure increased after fatigue at all stimulation frequencies with <b>aminophylline,</b> {{as compared with the}} pressure after identical fatigue runs at the same stimulation frequencies without <b>aminophylline.</b> The mean plasma <b>aminophylline</b> concentration associated with these responses was 13 +/- 0. 9 mg per liter. We conclude that <b>aminophylline</b> improves the diaphragm's contractility and renders it less susceptible to fatigue. Journal ArticleResearch Support, Non-U. S.

40|$|Objective: This {{study is}} to {{evaluate}} the effects of <b>aminophylline</b> on systemic inflammatory response after cardiopulmonary bypass in patients undergoing valve replacement. Methods: Thirty patients undergoing elective valve replacement were randomized to receive either <b>aminophylline</b> treatment (<b>aminophylline,</b> n 15) or no <b>aminophylline</b> (control, n 15). Administration of <b>aminophylline</b> (5 mg/kg) was injected intravenously after induction of anesthesia and maintained with 0. 5 mg/kg per h {{until the end of}} cardiopulmonary bypass. Perioperative cytokines (interleukin- 8 and interleukin- 10, tumor necrosis factor-a) and respiratory function, blood neutrophil count ratio of right atrium to that of left atrium, plasma malondialdehyde were measured during the experiment.
