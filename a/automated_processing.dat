The company {{has been the subject of}} lawsuits concerning the issues. Google has stated that email users must [...] "necessarily expect" [...] their emails to be subject to <b>automated</b> <b>processing,</b> and claims that the service refrains from displaying ads next to potentially sensitive messages, such as those mentioning race, religion, sexual orientation, health, or financial statements. In June 2017, Google announced the upcoming end to the use of contextual Gmail content for advertising purposes, relying instead on data gathered from use of its other services.|$|E
