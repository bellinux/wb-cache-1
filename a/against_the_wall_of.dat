5|$|Lefevre retired Tristan {{to stand}} as a {{stallion}} in France at his stud near Chamant. In 1891 he was purchased by Caroline, Duchess of Montrose, who returned him to England {{as a replacement for}} the recently deceased Isonomy. Three years later he was sold again and exported to Austria-Hungary. In 1897 he {{died as a result of}} injuries sustained after dashing his head <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> <b>of</b> his stable in a fit of temper. Tristan was not a great success as a stallion, but he did sire Canterbury Pilgrim, who won The Oaks in 1896 and became a highly successful and influential broodmare. Other good winners included Le Nord (Dewhurst Stakes) and Le Nicham (Champion Stakes).|$|E
5|$|The cheese {{course was}} {{served by a}} Maître d'hôtel on a trolley. White's rules {{dictated}} that after lunch, the cheese was reviewed {{to ensure that a}} sufficient serving was left to present for the dinner seatings. One incident recounted in White's autobiography, was that upon being unsatisfied with the remaining portions of cheese as the Maître'd was attempting to take the trolley into the dining room for the evening service, the chef threw each cheese in turn <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> <b>of</b> the kitchen while berating him for not replacing them. Due to the ripeness of the cheese, they remained glued to the wall {{for the rest of the}} service.|$|E

25|$|Diagnosis {{can also}} be made by cystoscopy, where a small camera is {{inserted}} into the urethra for direct visualization of the posteriorly positioned valve. A limitation of this technique is that posterior valve tissue is translucent and can be pushed <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> <b>of</b> the urethra by inflowing irrigation fluid, {{making it difficult to}} visualize.|$|E
25|$|Also, {{the test}} tube {{confines}} motion to the direction {{down the length}} of the tube, so vB is opposite to u1 and the Coriolis force is opposite to u2, that is, <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> <b>of</b> the tube. If the tube is spun for a long enough time, the velocity vB drops to zero as the matter comes to an equilibrium distribution.

25|$|The major {{monument}} at {{the south}} is that erected <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> <b>of</b> the south chancel chapel by Montague Cholmeley in February 1641. The monument, free standing, is dedicated to Cholmeley’s parents, Henry Cholmeley (died 1632), son to Sir Henry Cholmeley (died 1620) and Alice, the daughter of William Lacey of Stamford; and Elizabeth (died 1631), daughter to Sir Richard Sondes of Sheldwich, Kent. Sir Henry Cholmeley {{was the first of}} the family to take the manor of Easton, and was descended from the Cholmeley’s of Cheshire. Montague Cholmeley’s wife was Elizabeth, daughter to Sir Edward Hartop of Buckminster in Leicestershire.|$|E
25|$|His {{first win}} was in 1893, in Namur-Dinant-Givet in Belgium. He had sold his first bike {{and bought a}} lighter one — still 16kg but with {{pneumatic}} tyres — for 850 old French francs (approx €3,000 at 2008 values). The race was over 102km. He was leading by Dinant when he punctured. Spotting a soigneur waiting with a spare bike for a rival, Garin rested his own <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> <b>of</b> a bridge, grabbed the soigneur's spare bike and rode off. At the finish, winning with ten minutes over the field, he gave back the bike and recovered his own the next day where he had left it.|$|E
25|$|By 4:00p.m., {{the sheriff}} made an initial {{estimate}} of 25 dead students and teachers. The estimate was ten over the true count, but {{close to the}} total count of wounded students. He said that police officers were searching the bodies of Harris and Klebold. At 4:30p.m. the school was declared safe. At 5:30p.m., additional officers were called in, as more explosives {{were found in the}} parking lot and on the roof. By 6:15p.m., officials had found a bomb in Klebold's car in the parking lot. The sheriff decided to mark the entire school as a crime scene; thirteen of the dead, including the shooters, were still inside the school at the time. At 10:40p.m., a member of the bomb squad, who was attempting to dispose of an un-detonated pipe bomb, accidentally lit a striking match attached to the bomb by brushing it <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> <b>of</b> the ordnance disposal trailer.

25|$|In Mound A {{the tomb}} is {{associated}} with a pit burial. All that remains in the pit burial of its original fill are worn igneous rocks, quantities of coarse sherds and human skull parts that had been cut through by the digging of the tomb. The tomb contains the remains of eight people. One corpse received special treatment, as evinced by the considerable amount of jewelry and the offerings left with it. The bodies were borne into the tomb on fabric mats or animal hides of which only traces remain. Among the objects found as offerings in the tomb were jade beads around the necks of two of the corpses, wafer-like disc shells forming a choker on one skeleton, jade earplug flares, an unusually large number of shells, a fine obsidian blade, a tortoise shell, metates, and various fine pottery pieces including a whistling jar and a carved tripod vessel. Several coarse brownware vessels heaped <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> <b>of</b> the tomb probably originally contained food prepared for the after-life journey of the dead.|$|E
25|$|In 1966, Serra {{made his}} first sculptures out of nontraditional {{materials}} such as fiberglass and rubber. Serra's earliest work was abstract and process-based made from molten lead hurled in large splashes <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> <b>of</b> a studio or exhibition space. In 1967 and 1968 he {{compiled a list of}} infinitives that served as catalysts for subsequent work: “to hurl” suggested the hurling of molten lead into crevices between wall and floor; “to roll” led to the rolling of the material into dense, metal logs. He began in 1969 to be primarily concerned with the cutting, propping or stacking of lead sheets, rough timber, etc., to create structures, some very large, supported only by their own weight. His “Prop” pieces from the late 1960s are arranged so that weight and gravity balance lead rolls and sheets. Cutting Device: Base Plate Measure (1969) consists of an assemblage of heterogeneous materials (lead, wood, stone and steel) into which two parallel cuts have been made and the results strewn around in a chance configuration. In Malmo Role (1984), a four-foot-square steel plate, one and a half inches thick, bisects {{a corner of the room}} and is prevented from falling by a short cylindrical prop wedged into the corner of the walls.|$|E

Maggie even bounces a ball <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> <b>of</b> the playpen, as Steve McQueen's character Virgil Hilts does throughout the film while he is in confinement.|$|E

5000|$|Petrary is {{a generic}} {{term for a}} medieval stone-throwing siege engine (from the Greek [...] "petra", [...] "stone"), used to hurl large rocks <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>walls</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> besieged city, {{in an attempt to}} break down <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> and create an entry point.|$|R
500|$|In Italy, sarcophagi {{were mostly}} {{intended}} to be set <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> <b>of</b> the tomb, and only decorated on three sides, {{in contrast to the}} free-standing styles of Greece and the Eastern Empire. The relief scenes of Hellenistic art became even more densely crowded in later Roman sarcophagi, as for example in the 2nd-century Portonaccio sarcophagus, and various styles and forms emerged, such as the columnar type with an [...] "architectural background of columns and niches for its figures". [...] A well-known Early Christian example is the Sarcophagus of Junius Bassus, used for an important new convert who died in 359. Many sarcophagi from leading centres were exported around the Empire. [...] The Romans had already developed the expression of religious and philosophical ideas in narrative scenes from Greek mythology, treated allegorically; they later transferred this habit to Christian ideas, using [...] biblical scenes.|$|E
500|$|In 1742 a Sugar House {{was built}} <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> <b>of</b> the College. This {{structure}} {{was a fire}} risk {{and the cause of}} great anxiety among the heralds. In 1775 the College Surveyor drew attention to this problem, but to no avail. In February 1800, the College was asked by a Select Committee of the House of Commons to report to them the state of public records; again the heralds drew attention to the proximity of the Sugar House. Members of the committee inspected the College premises and reported to the House that the College must either be moved to a new building or secured against the risk of fire. Again nothing was done; in 1812 water seeped through the walls of the College damaging records. The Surveyor traced the leak back to a shed recently erected by Mr. Alderman Smith, owner of the Sugar House, who declared his readiness to do everything he could, but who actually did very little to rectify the situation. After years of negotiation the College, in 1820, bought the Sugar House from Smith for the sum of £1,500.|$|E
