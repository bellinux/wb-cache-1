6000|$|... "But why trouble {{ourselves}} {{about any}} curriculum at all?" [...] {{it may be}} asked. [...] "If it be true that the mind like the body has a predetermined course of evolution--if it unfolds spontaneously--if its successive desires for this or {{that kind of information}} arise when these are severally required for its nutrition--if there thus exists in itself a prompter to the right species of activity at the right time; why interfere in any way? Why not leave children wholly to the discipline of nature?--why not remain quite passive and let them get knowledge as they best can?--why not be consistent throughout?" [...] This is an awkward-looking question. Plausibly implying as it does, that a system of complete laissez-faire is the logical outcome of the doctrines set forth, it seems to furnish a disproof of them by reductio ad absurdum. In truth, however, they do not, when rightly understood, commit us to any such untenable position. A glance at the physical analogies will clearly show this. It is a general law of life that the more complex the organism to be produced, the longer the period during which it is dependent on a parent organism for food and protection. The difference between the minute, rapidly-formed, and self-moving spore of a conferva, and the slowly-developed seed of a tree, with its multiplied envelopes and large stock of nutriment laid by to nourish the germ during its first stages of growth, illustrates this law in its application to the vegetal world. Among animals we may trace it in a series of contrasts from the monad whose spontaneously-divided halves are as self-sufficing the moment after their separation as was the original whole; up to man, whose offspring not only passes through a protracted gestation, and subsequently long depends on the breast for sustenance; but after that must have its food artificially administered; must, when it has learned to feed itself, continue to have bread, clothing, and shelter provided; and does not acquire the power of complete self-support until a time varying from fifteen to twenty years after its birth. Now this law applies to the mind as to the body. For mental pabulum also, every higher creature, and especially man, is at first dependent on <b>adult</b> <b>aid.</b> Lacking the ability to move about, the babe is almost as powerless to get materials on which to exercise its perceptions as it is to get supplies for its stomach. Unable to prepare its own food, it is in like manner unable to reduce many kinds of knowledge to a fit form for assimilation. The language through which all higher truths are to be gained, it wholly derives from those surrounding it. And we see in such an example as the Wild Boy of Aveyron, the arrest of development that results when no help is received from parents and nurses. Thus, in providing from day to day the right kind of facts, prepared in the right manner, and giving them in due abundance at appropriate intervals, there is as much scope for active ministration to a child's mind as to its body. In either case, it is the chief function of parents to see that the conditions requisite to growth are maintained. And as, in supplying aliment, and clothing, and shelter, they may fulfil this function without at all interfering with the spontaneous development of the limbs and viscera, either in their order or mode; so, they may supply sounds for imitation, objects for examination, books for reading, problems for solution, and, if they use neither direct nor indirect coercion, may do this without in any way disturbing the normal process of mental evolution; or rather, may greatly facilitate that process. Hence the admission of the doctrines enunciated does not, as some might argue, involve the abandonment of teaching; but leaves ample room for an active and elaborate course of culture.|$|E

Because intrinsically religious individuals internalize their religious community’s values, we hypothesized that the relationship between intrinsic religiosity and volunteering would be stronger among Mormons than among Catholics or non-Catholic Christians. We tested this hypothesis using a sample of Mormon (N = 118), Catholic (N = 304), and non-Catholic Christian (N = 542) emerging adults (18 – 29 year olds) across three volunteering contexts (religious, family, and secular). Controlling for extrinsic religiosity and worship attendance, the relationship between intrinsic religiosity and frequency of volunteering was greater among Mormons than Catholics and non-Catholic Christians in the context of religious and family volunteering. However, intrinsic religiosity was not a significant predictor of secular volunteering. Our findings suggest that Mormon culture influences the frequency and type of volunteering engaged in by young Mormon adults...|$|R
40|$|The {{cornerstone}} in {{the fight}} against HIV/AIDS is prevention followed by the access to and use of highly active antiretroviral treatment (HAART).

40|$|Abstract Background Pneumocystis {{pneumonia}} (PCP) is {{an increasing}} problem amongst patients on immunosuppression with autoimmune inflammatory disorders (AID). The disease presents acutely and its diagnosis requires bronchoalveolar lavage in most cases. Despite treatment with intravenous antibiotics, PCP carries a worse prognosis in AID patients than HIV positive patients. The overall incidence of PCP in patients with AID remains low, although patients with Wegener's granulomatosis are at particular risk. Discussion In <b>adults</b> with <b>AID,</b> the risk of PCP is related to treatment with systemic steroid, ill-defined individual variation in steroid sensitivity and CD 4 + lymphocyte count. Rather than opting for PCP prophylaxis {{on the basis of}} disease or treatment with cyclophosphamide, we argue the case for carrying out CD 4 + lymphocyte counts on selected patients as a means of identifying individuals {{who are most likely to}} benefit from PCP prophylaxis. Summary Corticosteroids, lymphopenia and a low CD 4 + count in particular, have been identified as risk factors for the development of PCP in <b>adults</b> with <b>AID.</b> Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (co-trimoxazole) is an effective prophylactic agent, but indications for its use remain ill-defined.

Results: When measured prior to hearing aid fitting, self-efficacy for hearing aids predicted satisfaction with hearing aids but was not related to other hearing aid outcomes. Expectations of hearing aids, in particular positive expectations, and readiness to improve hearing predicted outcomes for hearing aid satisfaction and benefit, although not hearing aid use. Hearing sensitivity was not correlated with hearing aid outcomes. Conclusions: These results suggest that assessment of expectations of hearing aids, and readiness to improve hearing, may be useful to help identify individuals attending audiology clinics who would most likely benefit from hearing aid provision...|$|R

Most broods are attended by both sexes, but some are attended by a male alone, or rarely, a female alone. Two care-givers were more successful than one alone in fostering offspring survival. However, {{there was no significant}} difference between two care-givers and one alone in the proportion of time that broods were unattended. Potential brood predators were chased less frequently by one adult alone than by <b>adults</b> <b>aided</b> by their mate. This difference may be unimportant since two adults simultaneously attended their brood only 19 % of the time. Males alone attended their broods a significantly greater proportion of time than did either males or females aided by their mates. This difference suggests that males alone sustain a greater cost of care-giving (starvation and therefore reduced future reproduction) than do males aided by their mates. Thus, males alone may more often leave broods (and not return) than males that are aided in care-giving. The differential success observed may be due to a difference in the likelihood that the male (the principal care-giver) leaves the brood permanently, rather than differences in the quality of care one or two adults provide. I suggest that two care-givers are more successful than one because the net benefits of care-giving exceed the net benefits of leaving for males when aided by their mates...|$|R

OBJECTIVE: This study was designed to validate the effects of a formal auditory training program in <b>adult</b> hearing <b>aid</b> users with mild to moderate {{sensorineural hearing loss}}. METHODS: Fourteen bilateral hearing aid users were divided into two groups: seven who received auditory training and seven who did not. The training program was designed to improve auditory closure, figure-to-ground for verbal and nonverbal sounds and temporal processing (frequency and duration of sounds). Pre- and post-training evaluations included measuring electrophysiological and behavioral auditory processing and administration of the Abbreviated Profile of Hearing Aid Benefit (APHAB) self-report scale. RESULTS: The post-training evaluation of the experimental group demonstrated a statistically significant reduction in P 3 latency, improved performance in some of the behavioral auditory processing tests and higher hearing aid benefit in noisy situations (p-value < 0, 05). No changes were noted for the control group (p-value < 0, 05). CONCLUSION: The results demonstrated that auditory training in <b>adult</b> hearing <b>aid</b> users can lead to a reduction in P 3 latency, improvements in sound localization, memory for nonverbal sounds in sequence, auditory closure, figure-to-ground for verbal sounds and greater benefits in reverberant and noisy environments.
