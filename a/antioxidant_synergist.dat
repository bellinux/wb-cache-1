40|$|Olive oil is {{frequently}} {{described as a}} “living organism”. From the moment of its production until its consumption, a series of chemical and biochemical reactions take place. These reactions are of particular importance for its oxidative stability and the physicochemical state and have an impact in the olive oil’s storing and bottling practice. Cloudy olive oil, the unfiltered fresh olive juice, is an intermediate in olive oil production prior to final filtration and bottling; it can be sold separately to special consumers who prefer it for its unique organoleptic characteristics and its biological value. The minor components of cloudy olive oil that affect its oxidative and physicochemical stability {{and the presence of}} microorganisms that discriminate it from the other forms of olive oil, was the aim of this PhD thesis. The increased oxidative stability of cloudy olive oil was partially due to the increased content of total phenols of the oil prior to filtration. Protein content in the same oils was relatively small (0. 5 - 2 mg/kg) and is not expected to influence the oxidative and physicochemical stability. Phospholipids that might have the role of <b>antioxidants</b> or <b>antioxidant’s</b> <b>synergists</b> and can influence the oil’s physicochemical state, was around 100 mg/kg. The physicochemical state of cloudy olive oil is a system of dispersion of solid particles and micro-droplets of water (suspension and emulsion, respectively) partly appearing in the coagulated form. The solid particles (insoluble in petroleum ether matter) were mainly composed of non digestible material and, secondarily, of phospholipids, carbohydrates, polar phenols and proteins. The insoluble to petroleum ether matter continuously increased during storage possibly due to the formation of coagulation products with a size larger than the filter pores. This could be of interest for the Industry since sometimes commercially available olive oil exhibits re-clouding in the bottle during storage if early filtration is applied. Cloudy olive oil has a low population of microorganisms but their concentration (< 2 log cfu/ml of oil) and their nature (mainly yeasts of Candida genera and bacteria and moulds) did not adversely influence the organoleptic characteristics and the overall quality of this natural product. However, the application of GMP and GHP is considered desirable. ...|$|R
40|$|Using {{the values}} of {{induction}} periods of investigat-ed oils we have calculated the antioxidants concentra-tion. They were 50, 3 mg % and 54 mg % (calculated to tocopherols) for spring and winter rape oil respectively. Fig. 3. Shelf life of press oils from spring and winter rape seed varieties. The data obtained have shown that winter rape oil had longer induction period {{and it could be}} the result of higher <b>antioxidants</b> and their <b>synergists</b> content in win-ter rape oil than in spring rape oil. Higher antioxidants content in winter rape oil, ob-tained by cold pressing, obviously results in longer shelf life which was 72 days at the presence of light and air (fig. 3). At the same time spring rape oil had also the high antioxidant stability during storage and it...|$|R
