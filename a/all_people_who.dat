25|$|However, {{most other}} Christians {{are of the}} view that <b>all</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> turn to Christ as their {{personal}} saviour are 'chosen' {{in the context of}} John 15:16 whereby Jesus referred to God's plan of salvation as his great redeeming work on the cross, that all who come to faith in him does so freely and are 'chosen' to bear 'fruit that lasts'. 1 Peter 2:9 refers to these (Christians) as 'chosen people, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, God's special possession'.|$|E
25|$|However, trauma differs between individuals, {{according}} to their subjective experiences. People will react to similar events differently. In other words, not <b>all</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> experience a potentially traumatic event will actually become psychologically traumatized. This discrepancy in risk rate {{can be attributed to}} protective factors some individuals may have that enable them to cope with trauma, they are related to temperamental and environmental factors. Some examples are mild exposure to stress early in life, resilience characteristics, and active seeking of help.|$|E

Reverend Richard W. Ingalls, Sr., rector of Mariners' Church, tolled the bell 29 times, not 30. The practice of tolling a bell an additional time for all lives lost at sea began in November 10 memorial services following 1975.|$|E

A separate census of Norfolk Island had been conducted by the Norfolk Island Government every five years since 1981, and occurred on the same day as the Australian census. For the first time, in 2016 Norfolk Island was included in the Australian Census. The census examines data such as age, gender, incomes, occupations, dwelling types and occupancy, transportation modes, ancestry, languages spoken, and optional questions, such as religion.|$|E
25|$|This United States Supreme Court case {{centered}} around water rights involving the Truckee River.

The defendants argued against American Indian tribal use {{of the water in}} the Truckee River stating that the American Indian tribes were not parties to the original cause of action between the United States and the non-American Indian users of the water. The court ruled that the American Indian tribes did have water rights and were allowed {{to make use of the}} water in the Truckee River.|$|E
25|$|In 1988, Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher began {{preparations}} for a Community Charge {{to replace the}} council rates. Instead of one payment per household based on rateable value of the property, the poll tax was to be paid by <b>all</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> were 18 or over. While the Labour Party conference, {{in the autumn of}} 1988, had rejected a campaign of non-payment, Militant argued for a strategy of non-payment and supporting Anti-Poll Tax Unions, beginning in Scotland. Grant had opposed this option, arguing that Militant's MPs should pay the poll tax, partly for the group's self-protection, but was overruled.|$|E

25|$|The {{most common}} problem {{experienced}} by humans {{in the initial}} hours of weightlessness is known as space adaptation syndrome or SAS, {{commonly referred to as}} space sickness. It is related to motion sickness, and arises as the vestibular system adapts to weightlessness. Symptoms of SAS include nausea and vomiting, vertigo, headaches, lethargy, and overall malaise. The first case of SAS was reported by cosmonaut Gherman Titov in 1961. Since then, roughly 45% of <b>all</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> have flown in space have suffered from this condition. The duration of space sickness varies, but rarely has it lasted for more than 72 hours, after which the body adjusts to the new environment.|$|E
25|$|<b>All</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> {{present with}} red flags {{indicating}} a dangerous secondary headache should receive neuroimaging. The best form of neuroimaging for these headaches is controversial. Non-contrast computerized tomography (CT) scan {{is usually the}} first step in head imaging as it is readily available in Emergency Departments and hospitals and is cheaper than MRI. Non-contrast CT is best for identifying an acute head bleed. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is best for brain tumors and problems in the posterior fossa, or back of the brain. MRI is more sensitive for identifying intracranial problems, however it can pick up brain abnormalities that are not relevant to the person's headaches.|$|E
25|$|Serbia: A small protest {{took place}} in the town of Zenta (Senta) on this day. The {{demonstration}} was organised by a local ethnic Hungarian political party. These people wanted to show their sympathy for the demonstrators in Hungary because, in their opinion, <b>all</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> peacefully demonstrate on the streets in Hungary had previously voted to give Hungarian citizenship to the ethnic Hungarians in the neighboring countries. Attila Juhász, the mayor of the town, said that he and his party (the Alliance of Vojvodina Hungarians), which is the most influential ethnic Hungarian party in Serbia, believe that Hungarians in Vojvodina have no business in the Hungarian events.|$|E

25|$|The {{cultural}} history throughout Brazil {{is relevant to}} the changing theories of art's purpose and the consequential role that Modernist artists played. There were not many art institutions in Brazil and the country lacked a long theory of art technique that was institutional in other countries such as France with the Academie Royale de Peinture et Sculpture. By {{the end of the}} nineteenth century there was dissent in Rio's National School of Fine Arts and it was threatened to be closed by the Republicans who wanted <b>all</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> desired to become artists would have the ability to do so. This stemmed somewhat of a revolution where society became more receptive to new ideas by 1890. However, people who were too tied to the emperor were left from the artistic and cultural spectrum. By the 1920s there was a desire for a more specified and formal reconsideration of the arts and São Paulo was especially prominent in this area. However, along with the desire for renovation came the equally strong loyalty to a realistic portrayal of Brazilian life and culture.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the unfortunate}} {{decisions}} made by Lithuanian authorities in this period was the closure and liquidation of the Stefan Batory University on December 15, 1939. The same decision was taken in case of Society of Friends of Science (est. 1907), which has been permitted to function even under the oppressive Tsarist Russia rule and other Polish scientific institutions. In the process of Lithuanianization Polish language books were removed from stores and Polish language street names were replaced with new, in Lithuanian. Polish offices, schools, charitable social and cultural organizations, stores and businesses were closed. By June 1940 only two institutions in the entire city offered instruction in the Polish language, while roughly 4000 Polish teachers lost their jobs. The refugees, {{many of whom were}} Poles and Jews who moved to the city in order to avoid being captured by the Germans, were denied free movement, and by March 28, 1940, <b>all</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> had not been citizens of the town in October 1920, were declared to be refugees. Altogether, some 12,000 people were granted Lithuanian citizenship, while 150,000 of the city's inhabitants, mostly Poles, were declared foreigners, excluded from many jobs and even prohibited from riding on trains.|$|E
