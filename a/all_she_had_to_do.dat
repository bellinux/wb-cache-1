5|$|In 2010, Saran {{made her}} Malayalam debut with Pokkiri Raja, {{in which she}} {{appeared}} opposite Mammootty and Prithviraj. The film was declared a super hit in the first week, breaking the record in Malayalam cinema for opening week gross income, {{though it was not}} received well critically. It was said of Saran that <b>all</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> was look pretty. She then enacted her first lead role in a Telugu film after five years, in the commercially successful action-comedy Don Seenu opposite Ravi Teja, where she plays the sister of a mobster. In the opinion of some critics, she stole the show with her dances and romantic scenes.|$|E
25|$|Shirley's biggest {{trademark}} was her hair, {{which was}} also the subject of rumors. A rumor circulated that she wore a wig. More than once, fans yanked her hair to test the theory. She later said she wished <b>all</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> was wear a wig. The nightly process she went through {{in the setting of}} her curls was tedious and grueling, with once a week vinegar rinses burning her eyes. Rumors also spread about her hair color, namely that she wasn't a natural blonde. During the making of Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm, news spread {{that she was going to}} do extended scenes without her trademark curls. During production, she also caught a cold, which caused her to miss a couple of days. As a result, a false report originated in Britain that all of her hair was cut off.|$|E
6000|$|... "And she {{had been}} sent for, on the very face of it, to work right in. <b>All</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>do,</b> after all, was {{to be nice to}} you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, it is {{so lovely}} I don't know what to say!" [...] and Jill put up both arms, as words failed her, and {{grateful}} kisses were <b>all</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> offer.|$|R
60|$|I fancied that I {{understood}} {{the word and}} action. It meant the offering of herself, and <b>all</b> <b>she</b> <b>had,</b> <b>to</b> be at Zenobia's disposal. But the latter would not take it thus.|$|R
6000|$|Josie {{was a good}} listener. She did not {{interrupt}} Mary Louise, but let her say <b>all</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> say {{concerning this}} interesting matter. When her friend paused for lack of words, Josie remarked: ...|$|R
60|$|<b>All</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> {{at present}} was {{to listen to}} Miss Bracy, who was sure that Mrs. Rivers thought Mary and Blanche were not improved, and was afraid she was ungrateful for all the {{intended}} kindness to her sister.|$|E
60|$|Could she {{with her}} hands fight {{the face of the}} earth, beat the hills in their places? Yet her breast wanted to fight, to fight the whole world. And these two small hands were <b>all</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> it with.|$|E
6000|$|... "Not on your life," [...] {{he laughed}} jubilantly. [...] "All she'd done {{was to put}} a washtub on the ground square under the {{demijohn}}. Then she got out her old rifle an' shot the demijohn to smithereens, an' <b>all</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> was lap the whisky outa the tub." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Twould give grave offence {{to leave}} the lady, without knowing <b>all</b> <b>she</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> say. The answer now {{concerns}} you, worthy Alderman; and the rattan will do its turn, in your hand, {{as well as in}} that of another." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It is--it is {{my cousin}} Ginevra. Every time <b>she</b> <b>has</b> leave <b>to</b> visit Mrs. Cholmondeley she calls here, and {{whenever}} she finds me alone {{she begins to}} talk about her admirers. Love, indeed! You should hear <b>all</b> <b>she</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> say about love." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>had</b> seen Miss Scott {{hand her}} bunch to a meek little governess {{who had been}} forgotten, and this was <b>all</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> offer {{in return for the}} {{kindness}} which is so sweet to poor girls whose sensitive pride gets often wounded by trifles like these.|$|R
60|$|Pauline, to {{whom the}} {{brothers}} now looked, shook her head. Never before, she said, had she occasion to trouble her brain about a light. When she wanted one in England, <b>all</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> was to call for one, or strike a match. What was {{to be done in}} their present circumstances she had not the smallest conception.|$|E
60|$|These {{directions}} {{she still}} had. <b>All</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> now was to embody {{them in the}} secret orders which Gaston de Stainville would hand over to the Commander of Le Monarque. Further orders would be anent getting the prince and his friends on board, and the route to be taken homeward, the better to ensure their safety.|$|E
6000|$|No {{one came}} {{out by the}} little door she was told; <b>all</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> would be {{to keep out of}} sight when the ringers came in before the {{afternoon}} service. She knew the way, and was soon close to Mary Sedhurst's grave. [...] "Ah! why was he not constant to her," [...] she thought; [...] "and oh! why has he deserted me in my need?" ...|$|E
60|$|Lady Underhill, <b>having</b> said <b>all</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> say, {{recovered}} {{her breath}} and began to say it again. Frequent iteration {{was one of her}} strongest weapons. As her brother Edwin, who was fond of homely imagery, <b>had</b> often observed, <b>she</b> could talk the hind-leg off a donkey.|$|R
60|$|Therese fetched another deep {{sigh and}} raising her eyes {{looked at me}} with great attention. I {{preserved}} an inscrutable expression, for I wanted <b>to</b> hear <b>all</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> tell me of Rita. I watched her with the greatest anxiety composing her face into a cheerful expression.|$|R
50|$|On {{their honeymoon}} the two share their various family histories, Andrew's {{mother and father}} having {{separated}} and left him {{to the care of}} an aunt who <b>has</b> sacrificed <b>all</b> <b>she</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> get him to where he is, and Celia's father having died in the attack on Pearl Harbor.|$|R
60|$|She was {{to sing in}} one of {{the most}} fashionable salons in England: that was very pleasant. The Prince of Wales would hear and see her! that opened out a vista of {{delightful}} possibilities! And <b>all</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> was to act a part dictated to her by Citizen Chauvelin, to behave as he directed, to move in the way he wished! Well! that was easy enough, since the part which she would have to play was one peculiarly suited to her talents.|$|E
60|$|The Nugget {{was sitting}} on the floor, gaping feebly, and awed for the moment into silence. Audrey, in the far corner, looked pale but composed. Her {{behaviour}} was perfect. There was nothing for her to do, and she was doing it with a quiet self-control which won my admiration. Her manner seemed to me exactly suited to the exigencies of the situation. With a super-competent dare-devil like myself in charge of affairs, <b>all</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> was to wait and not get in the way.|$|E
60|$|It {{was still}} a cold, damp face (Grizel was always in such a hurry) {{when she opened her}} most {{precious}} drawer and took from it a certain glove which was wrapped in silk paper, but was not perhaps quite so conceited as it had been, for, alas and alack! it was now used as a wrapper itself. The ring was inside it. If Grizel wanted to be engaged, absolutely and at once, <b>all</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> was to slip that ring upon her finger.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{sometimes}} think," [...] almost whispered Marian, [...] "that {{it is not}} he, poor boy, {{whose eyes}} are {{the worst in the}} house; but Mrs. Lyddell's head has been so full of Johnny, and Caroline, and <b>all</b> <b>she</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> do, that <b>she</b> will not see anything amiss with Lionel." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Skim her--and learn all. The {{table of}} {{contents}} is SO short.... You see, in the first place, she is extremely 'exclusive'; she prides herself on her 'exclusiveness': it, and her shoddy title, are probably <b>all</b> <b>she</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> pride herself upon, and she works them both hard. She is a sham great lady." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well," [...] said he, [...] "if that estimable {{young woman}} wants {{to catch a}} sight of them, <b>all</b> <b>she</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> do is to step along lively, for at this present moment she is walking over the field-path {{straight}} to this house, and what is more, she is wearing her bonnet and carrying a parasol." ...|$|R
60|$|Despite our {{refusal to}} grant {{permission}} to do the deed, she went on with it. Now Anna Roylston was a fascinating woman. <b>All</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> was to beckon a man to her. She broke the hearts of scores of our young comrades, and scores of others she captured, and by their heart-strings led into our organization. Yet she steadfastly refused to marry. She dearly loved children, but she held that a child of her own would claim her from the Cause, {{and that it was}} the Cause to which her life was devoted.|$|E
60|$|Phoebe's {{pleasure}} {{was less}} certain, and {{less dependent on}} her merits, yet it invigorated her efforts to do <b>all</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with all her might, even into the statement of {{the pros and cons}} of customs and free-trade, which she was required to produce as her morning's exercise. In the midst, her ear detected the sound of wheels, and her heart throbbed in the conviction that it was Miss Charlecote's pony carriage; nay, she found her pen had indited 'Robin would be so glad,' instead of 'revenue to the government,' and while scratching the words out beyond all legibility, she blamed herself for betraying such want of self-command.|$|E
6000|$|Then {{followed}} the fateful interview. The lady was satisfied {{that she had}} got hold of the right person at last--the {{one in the world}} who would be able to save her precious little one [...] "from to die," [...] the poor pining infant on whose frail little life so much depended! She would feed it from her full, healthy breasts and give it something of her own abounding, splendid life. Martha's own baby would do very well--there was nothing the matter with it, and it would flourish on [...] "the bottle" [...] or anything else, no matter what. <b>All</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> was to go back to her cottage and make the necessary arrangements, then come to stay at the mansion.|$|E
50|$|Else {{also runs}} a massage parlor {{out of her}} own home, and {{sometimes}} causes serious injury to her clients. Inexplicably, she is frequently mistaken for a prostitute. <b>She</b> also <b>has</b> an eternal relationship with her bathroom scale, and as a quite overweight woman, these <b>have</b> a tendency <b>to</b> break. Sometimes, <b>all</b> <b>she</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> do is cast a shadow.|$|R
60|$|She sat {{crushed and}} obliterated in a {{darkness}} {{that was the}} border of death. <b>She</b> realised how <b>all</b> her life <b>she</b> <b>had</b> been drawing nearer and nearer to this brink, {{where there was no}} beyond, from which one <b>had</b> <b>to</b> leap like Sappho into the unknown. The knowledge of the imminence of death was like a drug. Darkly, without thinking at <b>all,</b> <b>she</b> knew that she was near <b>to</b> death. <b>She</b> <b>had</b> travelled <b>all</b> her life along the line of fulfilment, and it was nearly concluded. <b>She</b> knew <b>all</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> know, <b>she</b> <b>had</b> experienced <b>all</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> experience, <b>she</b> was fulfilled in a kind of bitter ripeness, there remained only to fall from the tree into death. And one must fulfil one's development to the end, must carry the adventure to its conclusion. And the next step was over the border into death. So it was then! There was a certain peace in the knowledge.|$|R
6000|$|... "Better, but {{not out of}} her room. It {{has been}} a {{tolerable}} state of things of late. Not a creature to speak to, except, now and then, Clara coming down to maunder and sigh over <b>all</b> <b>she</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> do, and my father, who has been thoroughly in a rage about Elliot. Do you know about all that, Marian?" ...|$|R
6000|$|More tears flashed into Mrs. Durgin's eyes, {{but they}} were tears of wrath now. [...] "I would 'a' done it," [...] she said, [...] "if I thought {{every single one of}} 'em would 'a' left the house the next minute, for there a'n't one that has the first word to say against me, any other way. It wa'n't that I cared whether she thought my son was good enough to eat with her or not; I know what I think, and that's enough for me. He wa'n't invited to the picnic, and he a'n't one to put himself forward. If she didn't want him to stay, <b>all</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> was to do nothin'. But to make him up a plate before everybody, and hand it to him to eat with the horses, like a tramp or a dog--" [...] Mrs. Durgin filled to the throat with her wrath, and the sight of her made Westover keenly unhappy.|$|E
6000|$|Gwendolen {{felt herself}} stricken. She was {{conscious}} of having received so much, that her sense of command was checked, and sank away in the perception that, look around her as she might, she could not turn back: {{it was as if}} she had consented to mount a chariot where another held the reins; and it was not in her nature to leap out in the eyes of the world. She had not consented in ignorance, and all she could say now would be a confession that she had not been ignorant. Her right to explanation was gone. <b>All</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> now was to adjust herself, so that the spikes of that unwilling penance which conscience imposed should not gall her. With a sort of mental shiver, she resolutely changed her mental attitude. There had been a little pause, during which she had not turned away her eyes; and with a sudden break into a smile, she said-- ...|$|E
6000|$|September was {{theoretically}} {{always a}} very busy month with Mrs. Saunders. She believed that she devoted it to activities which she called her fall work, and that she pressed forward in the fulfilments of these duties with a vigor inspired by the cool, clear weather. But in reality {{there was not much}} less folding of the hands with her in September than there was in July. She was apt, on the coolest and clearest September day, to drop into a chair with a deep drawn [...] "Oh, hum!" [...] after the fatigue of bringing in an apronful of apples, or driving the hens away from her chrysanthemums, and she {{spent a good deal of}} time wondering how, with <b>all</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>do,</b> she was ever going to get those flowers in before the frost caught them. At one of these times, sitting up slim, graceful and picturesque, in the feather-cushioned rocker-lounge, and fanning her comely face with her shade-hat, it occurred to her to say to Cornelia, sewing hard beside the window, [...] "I guess you won't see them in blossom this Christmas, Nie." ...|$|E
60|$|Putting a tray on {{the little}} table, the good soul set forth <b>all</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> give, and offered it with such hospitable warmth that Christie ate and drank with unaccustomed appetite, {{finishing}} off deliciously with a kiss from baby before she was borne away by her mother to the back bedroom, where peace soon reigned.|$|R
60|$|She {{was going}} to solve the problem in a way that seemed to her very simple. Her mind had never yet bowed to any {{obligation}} apart from personal love and reverence; <b>she</b> <b>had</b> no keen sense of any other human relations, and <b>all</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> obey now was the instinct to sever herself from the man she loved no longer.|$|R
60|$|I {{wanted to}} tell her that if I could do {{anything}} at <b>all,</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> only <b>to</b> command.|$|R
