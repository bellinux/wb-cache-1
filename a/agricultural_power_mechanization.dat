The data was collected in 2012 by questionnaire from paddy farmers and mechanization corporations in five rural districts (Chaf, Divshal, Gelsefid, Komleh, and Otaqvar). The following mechanization indices were calculated for each rural district and the entire region: unit area <b>power,</b> <b>mechanization</b> level, area per tractor, area per machine, and mechanization requirement. The results showed that the mean unit area power was 1. 37 hp ha- 1. There was considerable difference between mechanization indices in the rural districts. The regional mechanization requirement for land preparation was 0, for transplanting was 81. 50 %, for weeding was 94. 97 %, and for harvesting was 43. 20 %. The area per four-wheeled tractor was 176. 42 ha, and cultivated area per machine for transplanting was 416. 36, for weeding was 2081. 80, and for combine harvesting was 88. 21 ha.

40|$|The {{utilization}} of visual elaboration {{has been a}} key component of the educational process for instructors of <b>agricultural</b> <b>power</b> technology. Traditionally, still illustration and representatives of real equipment (realia) have been utilized to teach the hidden theoretical concepts that comprise the most basic operational processes of the internal combustion engine and its accompanying systems. Exponential technology advancement has allowed {{the development of a new}} mode of visual elaboration in the form of high-quality computer-generated animation. This study, which is one part of a larger study, investigated the affects of computer-generated animations on low-level cognition in undergraduates. The dual-coding theory was utilized as the investigation’s theoretical framework. Computer-generated animations are most effective when used with topics that are abstract, vague, hidden or too fast or slow to view. When applied to operational theory of common internal combustion engines, animation is a natural fit. The study utilized an experimental pretest posttest control group design. Participants were undergraduate students (n= 47) enrolled in “Agricultural Power Units”, an undergraduate <b>agricultural</b> <b>power</b> technology course at a university in Texas. Following pretest and immediate posttest, a delayed posttest was administered in order that learning decay could be measured. For this investigation, the dependent measure, (multiple choice test) consisted of low-level cognitive questions only. Two hypotheses were developed. Results indicate that no significant differences existed between the traditional and animated groups.
