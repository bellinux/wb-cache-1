25|$|Doubly fed {{electric}} motors have two independent multiphase winding sets, which contribute active (i.e., working) {{power to the}} energy conversion process, {{with at least one}} of the winding sets electronically controlled for variable speed operation. Two independent multiphase winding sets (i.e., dual armature) are the maximum provided in a single package without topology duplication. Doubly-fed {{electric motors}} are machines with an effective constant torque speed range that is twice synchronous speed for a given frequency of excitation. This is twice the constant torque speed range as singly-fed electric machines, which have only one <b>active</b> <b>winding</b> set.|$|E
50|$|High-acceleration linear motors are {{typically}} used {{in studies of}} hypervelocity collisions, as weapons, or as mass drivers for spacecraft propulsion. They are usually of the AC linear induction motor (LIM) design with an active three-phase winding {{on one side of}} the air-gap and a passive conductor plate on the other side. However, the direct current homopolar linear motor railgun is another high acceleration linear motor design. The low-acceleration, high speed and high power motors are usually of the linear synchronous motor (LSM) design, with an <b>active</b> <b>winding</b> {{on one side of the}} air-gap and an array of alternate-pole magnets on the other side. These magnets can be permanent magnets or electromagnets. The Shanghai Transrapid motor is an LSM.|$|E
50|$|When half-stepping, {{the drive}} {{alternates}} between two phases on {{and a single}} phase on. This increases the angular resolution. The motor also has less torque (approx 70%) at the full-step position (where only a single phase is on). This may be mitigated by increasing the current in the <b>active</b> <b>winding</b> to compensate. The advantage of half stepping is that the drive electronics need not change to support it. In animated figure shown above, if we change it to half-stepping, then it will take 8 steps to rotate by 1 teeth position. So there will be 25×8 = 200 steps per full rotation and each step will be 360/200 = 1.8°. Its angle per step is half of the full step.|$|E
40|$|The paper {{introduces}} the <b>active</b> <b>wind</b> as the deviation from a general local wind balance, the inactive wind. The inactive wind is directed along intersection lines of Bernoulli function and potential temperature surfaces. In climatological steady state, the inactive mass flux cannot participate in net-mass fluxes, because the mean {{position of the}} mentioned intersection lines does not change. A conceptual proximity of the zonal-mean <b>active</b> <b>wind</b> to the residual wind as occurring in the transformed Eulerian mean equations suggests itself. The zonal- and time-mean <b>active</b> <b>wind</b> is compared to the residual wind for the Held-Suarez test case. Similarities occur for the meridional components in the zone of Rossby wave breaking in the upper troposphere equatorward of the jet. The vertical components are similar, too. However, the vertical <b>active</b> <b>wind</b> is much stronger in the baroclinic zone. This {{is due to the}} missing vertical eddy flux of Ertel's potential vorticity (EPV) in the TEM equations. The largest differences {{are to be found in}} the boundary layer, where the <b>active</b> <b>wind</b> exhibits typical pattern of Ekman dynamics. Instantaneous <b>active</b> <b>wind</b> vectors demonstrate mass-inflow for lows and mass-outflow for highs in the boundary layer. An <b>active</b> meridional <b>wind</b> is associated with a filamentation of EPV in the zone of Rossby wave breaking in about 300 [*]hPa. Strong gradients of EPV act as a transport barrier...|$|R

This work is aimed at using these single-phase induction machines for wider applications. A majority of single-phase induction machines are capacitor-start type of induction machines. These machines have two-stator windings {{in space and time}} quadrature. One of these windings is used only to start the machine. The possibility of using this passive winding as an <b>active</b> <b>winding,</b> functional throughout the machine operation, by simply retrofitting a run capacitor, has been discussed in this work.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a comprehensive set of field experiments investigating {{the form of}} the asymptotic, depth-limited wind wave frequency spectrum. Such a spectrum represents the upper limit to growth from <b>active</b> <b>wind</b> forcing in finite depth conditions. The data clearly define asymptotic limits for the nondimensional energy and nondimensional wave number as functions of nondimensional water depth. In contrast to deep water spectra, the asymptotic depth-limited form has a harmonic at a frequency slightly less than twice the spectral peak frequency. A parametric form is proposed for the spectral form, and clear functional relationships are found for all the spectral parameters. These relationships mean that the full asymptotic, depth-limited spectrum can be determined with knowledge of only the water depth and wind speed...|$|R

One aspect, covered by the Institute of Aeroelasticity and the Institute of Aerodynamics and Flow Technology, is the wind tunnel test of a UCAV wing in subsonic and transonic flow. The model shall show measurable static aeroelastic deformations. Main goals of the tests will be the study of vortex-dominated flow on aeroelastic deformable wings, and the generation of data for the validation of numerical fluid-structure coupling for delta wings at various points of the operational envelope.

In this paper, we develop two separate algorithms for wind noise {{detection and}} suppression, respectively, operational in a challenging, low-energy regime. Together, these algorithms comprise a robust wind noise suppression system. In the first case, we advance a real-time wind detection algorithm (RTWD) that uses two distinct sets of low-dimensional signal features to discriminate the presence of wind noise with high accuracy. For wind noise suppression, we employ an additional algorithm - attentive neural wind suppression (ANWS) - that utilizes a neural network to reconstruct the wearer speech signal from wind-corrupted audio in the spectral regions that are most adversely affected by wind noise. Finally, we test our algorithms through real-time experiments using low-power, multi-microphone devices with a wind simulator under challenging detection criteria and a variety of wind intensities.
