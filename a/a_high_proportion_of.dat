40|$|Family {{roles and}} {{well-being}} — 2 As we embark upon {{the early years}} of a new millennium, considerable consternation and debate about what is happening to the family as a social institution in the United States and elsewhere continues (Waite, 2000). During the 20 th century family demography charted historic changes in rates of mortality, marriage, fertility, divorce, remarriage, and household composition (Bumpass, 1990). In contrast to 1900, today both men and women live significantly longer, a smaller <b>proportion</b> <b>of</b> the adult life course is spent married, <b>a</b> <b>higher</b> <b>proportion</b> <b>of</b> adults cohabit before marriage or in lieu <b>of</b> marriage, <b>a</b> <b>higher</b> <b>proportion</b> <b>of</b> marriages end in divorce, fewer remarriages follow a divorce, fewer children are born to each woman, <b>a</b> <b>higher</b> <b>proportion</b> <b>of</b> the population lives in a single-person household, and <b>a</b> <b>higher</b> <b>proportion</b> <b>of</b> adulthood is spent with living parents over age 65 (and at risk of dependency due to frailty and/or chronic illness...|$|R

5|$|Agriculture in Wales has in {{the past}} been {{a major part of the}} economy of Wales, a largely rural country that forms part of the United Kingdom.

As a proportion of the national economy, the importance of agriculture has become much reduced; <b>a</b> <b>high</b> <b>proportion</b> <b>of</b> the population now live in the towns and cities in the south of the country and tourism has become an important form of income in the countryside and on the coast.

The average number of gamergates can still be very high if they are related and get a larger share in reproduction. Most of the time, however, gamergates are generally unrelated, and it is uncommon {{for them to have}} a degree of relatedness. In many colonies, workers and gamergates police young females, which prevents them from reproducing.|$|E
