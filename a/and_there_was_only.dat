5|$|During the Japanese colonial-era, a {{sizeable}} minority of mixed-race Japanese-Palauans emerged. Japanese-Palauans were offsprings of intermarriages between Japanese men and Palauan women. Most of them lived in urban areas, and {{were brought up}} in accordance to Japanese norms and values and spoke Japanese in their daily lives. A few sought further education in Japan, {{and at the same}} time had limited knowledge of Palauan customs and language, although children that were born out of wedlock reportedly had a greater exposure to their matrilineal customs and spoke both Japanese and Palauan fluently. Although Japanese-Palauan children were generally classified as Japanese in official figures and had access to Japanese social privileges, many reportedly faced discrimination when placed in Japanese and Palauan circles. In rural areas where Palauans formed higher concentrations, spouses and mistresses of Japanese men were shunned upon, and Palauan nationalists (especially Modekngei) actively discouraged mixed unions between Japanese men and Palauan women. The Japanese government encouraged such intermarriages, and provided social benefits to women who had married Japanese men. However, only unions with civilian men were recognised and military personnel were prohibited from marrying Palauan women, although they were allowed to keep mistresses. The civilian government suppressed unions between Palauan men and Japanese women, <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>only</b> one known case of a union between a Palauan man and a Japanese woman during the Japanese colonial-era.|$|E

The train was formed of two four-car class 455 electric multiple units (EMUs). The leading bogie of the fourth coach was derailed towards the left as it passed over a set of trailing points on a right-hand curve at about 17 miles per hour (27km/h).

25|$|Sri Lanka {{then lost}} both their last {{specialist}} batsmen, Kapugedera and Dilshan, but were leading by 62 runs at that time. The ninth-wicket partners Vaas and Kulasekara, however, had already showed their batting skills {{by having the}} highest partnership of the first innings, and they were eight runs away from achieving that again in the second. Batting through 189 minutes, the pair secured the draw for Sri Lanka, with Kulasekara even hitting a couple of sixes as he ended with 64 when Pietersen held a catch off Hoggard's bowling. However, {{by then it was}} too late, as Sri Lanka led by 167 runs <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>only</b> half an hour left to score those runs in. Indeed, the tenth-wicket stand frustrated England until stumps: Muralitharan faced out that half-hour, scoring one run, while Vaas got his half-century before the close of play.|$|E

25|$|Universitario was grouped {{with the}} Uruguayan clubs Peñarol—a three-time {{winner of the}} Copa Libertadores—and Nacional—the {{previous}} edition's winner—in the semi-final group stage. La U started off losing their first match against Peñarol in Lima. In that match, La U did not play with five of their starting players because they were called {{to play for the}} Peru national football team. However, they won the following game against Nacional 3–0. They then visited both teams in Montevideo tying both games, 3–3 against Nacional and 1–1 against Peñarol. Universitario had accumulated 4 points <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>only</b> one game left between Peñarol and Nacional, which had 4 and 2 points respectively. All three teams had a chance of qualifying for the next round. Peñarol only needed a win but Nacional needed a win by 5 goals. The game ended 3–0 in favor of Nacional allowing Universitario to qualify for the final round where they would face Independiente.|$|E
25|$|In {{the case}} of a {{rebellion}} by the sepoys in Cawnpore, the most suitable defensive location for the British was the magazine located in the north of the city. It had thick walls, ample ammunition and stores, and also hosted the local treasury. However, General Wheeler decided to take refuge in the south of the city, in an entrenchment composed of two barracks surrounded by a mud wall. There was a military building site to the south of Cawnpore, where nine barracks were being constructed at the dragoon barracks. The British soldiers found it difficult to dig deep trenches, as it was hot summer season. The area also lacked good sanitary facilities, <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>only</b> one well (which would be exposed to enemy fire in case of an attack). Also, there were several buildings overlooking the entrenchment that would provide cover for the attackers, allowing them to easily shoot down on the defenders.|$|E
25|$|In medieval times, {{from the}} 13th to the 15th centuries, Manor House was a {{building}} on the south {{western side of the}} church surrounded by an earthen rampart and a moat, most of the site being now occupied by the Mount car park (the area was formerly known as the Mount). Only the base of some of the walls remained from the old building and these were partially excavated in 1955 before the car park was constructed. The remains of the building lie under {{the far side of the}} car park (farthest from the church) extending from north west to south east, parallel with the fence at the end. The whole building was about 150 feet long with a minimum width of 15 feet. Most of the remains had been pillaged for building material over the centuries <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>only</b> time for a partial excavation in 1955, with the result that the excavator could only reach provisional conclusions about the nature of the building and the uses of the rooms.|$|E

25|$|Atkinson played mostly second eleven cricket in 1987, but in 1988 he {{returned}} to first-class cricket at Cambridge University, {{where he was a}} student at Downing College. Played as a middle-order batsman, his only score of note in his first season for Cambridge was 73 against Surrey, and this was his highest score in his three years at the university. He was awarded his Blue, though in fact the match against Oxford University was abandoned without a ball being bowled, the only time this has happened {{in the history of the}} fixture going back to 1829. He went on to win Blues in both 1989 and 1990, when he was captain of the Cambridge team: both of these matches were also badly affected by rain. In all three seasons, he played List A cricket in the Benson and Hedges Cup for the Combined Universities cricket team: an amalgam of the Oxford and Cambridge sides. In both 1988 and 1989 {{he returned}} after the university term was over to play occasional games for Somerset, but the 1990 University match was his last first-class game, <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>only</b> one further List A match for Somerset in August 1990.|$|E
25|$|In 1886, the {{department}} hired {{its first two}} black officers, Robert William Stewart and Roy Green.. The LAPD {{was one of the}} first two police departments in the country to hire an African-American woman officer, Georgia Ann Robinson in 1919. Despite this, {{the department}} was slow at integration. During the 1965 Watts riots, only 5 of the 205 police assigned to South Central Los Angeles were black, despite the fact that it was the largest black community in Los Angeles. Los Angeles' first black mayor Tom Bradley was an ex-police officer and quit the department after being unable to advance past the rank of lieutenant like other black police officers in the department. When Bradley was elected mayor in 1972, only 5% of LAPD officers were black <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>only</b> one black captain in the department, Homer Broome. Broome would break down racial barriers on the force going on to become first black officer to obtain the rank of commander and the first black to command a police station, the Southwest Division which included historically black neighborhoods of South Central Los Angeles in 1975.|$|E
25|$|A {{platoon of}} three was {{assigned}} to the Mobile Group that joined the Germans in Operation Barbarossa on 24 June 1941. Two more were added when the Mobile Group was reinforced and redesignated as the Mobile Brigade on 8 July. The only serious combat encountered by the Slovak armor was at Lipovec in late July where they failed to dislodge the Soviet 44th Mountain Division from its positions. One OA vz. 30 was destroyed during this battle and two others were heavily damaged. All of the armored cars were withdrawn together with all the other armored vehicles and returned to Slovakia in early August. A company of six OA vz. 30s was sent to reinforce the Security Division on anti-partisan duties in Ukraine in August 1942. Two were destroyed in combat <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>only</b> one running when the survivors were withdrawn back to Slovakia on 12 January 1943. Once the Panzerkampfwagen IIs that the Ministry of Defense had ordered to replace them arrived in January 1944 they were put into storage although they were still carried on the books. They saw some use by the insurgents when the Slovak National Uprising began in September 1944, but little is known of their activities.|$|E

25|$|The factory was {{not well}} {{equipped}} to handle the gas created by the sudden addition of water to the MIC tank. The MIC tank alarms had not been working for four years <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>only</b> one manual back-up system, compared to a four-stage system used in the United States. The flare tower and several vent gas scrubbers {{had been out of}} service for five months before the disaster. Only one gas scrubber was operating: it could not treat such a large amount of MIC with sodium hydroxide (caustic soda), which would have brought the concentration down to a safe level. The flare tower could only handle a quarter of the gas that leaked in 1984, and moreover it was out of order {{at the time of the}} incident. To reduce energy costs, the refrigeration system was idle. The MIC was kept at 20 degrees Celsius, not the 4.5 degrees advised by the manual. Even the steam boiler, intended to clean the pipes, was non-operational for unknown reasons. Slip-blind plates that would have prevented water from pipes being cleaned from leaking into the MIC tanks, had the valves been faulty, were not installed and their installation had been omitted from the cleaning checklist. As MIC is water-soluble, deluge guns were in place to contain escaping gases from the stack. The water pressure was too weak for the guns to spray high enough to reach the gas which would have reduced the concentration of escaping gas significantly. In addition to it, carbon steel valves were used at the factory, even though they were known to corrode when exposed to acid.|$|E
