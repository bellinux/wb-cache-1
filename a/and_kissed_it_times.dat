The lady {{understood}} her, and stroked her cheek softly, saying to her elder daughter, 'We must take care of this good little creature. Freddy, bring me your mittens; these poor hands must be covered. Alice, get your play-hood; this handkerchief is all wet; and, Maud, bring the old chinchilla tippet.' ...|$|R
25|$|During the summer, French {{newspapers}} {{were filled with}} the story of Henri Pranzini, convicted of the brutal murder of two women and a child. To the outraged public Pranzini represented all that threatened the decent way of life in France. In July and August 1887 Thérèse prayed hard for the conversion of Pranzini, so his soul could be saved, yet Pranzini showed no remorse. At the end of August, the newspapers reported that just as Pranzini's neck was placed on the guillotine, he had grabbed a crucifix <b>and</b> <b>kissed</b> <b>it</b> three <b>times.</b> Thérèse was ecstatic and believed that her prayers had saved him. She continued to pray for Pranzini after his death.|$|R

He seized her hand madly <b>and</b> <b>kissed</b> <b>it</b> a {{thousand}} <b>times.</b> She did not withdraw it. [...] "Does {{the old lady}} know it?" [...] Miss Costigan thought to herself, [...] "well, perhaps she may," [...] and then she remembered what a handsome diamond cross Mrs. Pendennis had {{on the night of}} the play, and thought, [...] "Sure 'twill go in the family." ...|$|R
60|$|He {{lifted my}} hand to his lips <b>and</b> <b>kissed</b> <b>it</b> several <b>times,</b> while I felt hot tears falling upon it as he bent over me. It was a strange position, look at it how you will. Grant that I was but the dupe of a madman, yet even to believe {{for a moment that}} I, a man of well-nigh fifty, stood there in face of my own great-grandfather's brother, to all {{appearance}} some twenty years my junior, was in itself an extraordinary and marvellous thing. Both of us were too overcome to speak. It was a few minutes before we said anything, and then a loud knock at the door made my hunted stranger rise up hastily in terror from his chair.|$|R
60|$|After {{delivering}} {{this speech}} {{all in a}} breath, and with extraordinary animation and pleasure, Mr. Peggotty put one of his large hands rapturously {{on each side of}} his niece's face, <b>and</b> <b>kissing</b> <b>it</b> a dozen <b>times,</b> laid <b>it</b> with a gentle pride and love upon his broad chest, and patted it as if his hand had been a lady's. Then he let her go; and as she ran into the little chamber where I used to sleep, looked round upon us, quite hot and out of breath with his uncommon satisfaction.|$|R
5000|$|The idol Baʿal Berith, {{which the}} Jews worshipped {{after the death}} of Gideon, was identical, {{according}} to the Rabbis, with Baʿal Zebub, [...] "the lord of flies," [...] the god of Ekron (II Kings i. 2). He was worshipped {{in the shape of a}} fly; and Jewish tradition states that so addicted were the Jews to his cult that they would carry an image of him in their pockets, producing <b>it,</b> <b>and</b> <b>kissing</b> <b>it</b> from <b>time</b> to time. Baʿal Zebub is called Baʿal Berith because such Jews might be said to make a covenant (Hebrew: berith) of devotion with the idol, being unwilling to part with it for a single moment (Shab. 83b; comp. also Sanh. 63b). According to another conception, Baʿal Berith was an obscene article of idolatrous worship, possibly a simulacrum priapi (Yer. Shab. ix. 11d; 'Ab. Zarah iii. 43a). This is evidently based on the later significance of the word [...] "berit," [...] meaning circumcision.|$|R
60|$|The {{moment the}} prince {{was left alone}} he drew the ring from under his pillow <b>and</b> <b>kissed</b> <b>it</b> a {{thousand}} <b>times.</b> Then he set his mind to find how he was to see the owner--for even he did not dare to confess that he had only beheld 'Donkey Skin' through a keyhole, lest they should laugh at this sudden passion. All this worry brought back the fever, which {{the arrival of the}} cake had diminished for the time; and the doctors, not knowing what else to say, informed the queen that her son was simply dying of love. The queen, stricken with horror, rushed into the king's presence with the news, and together they hastened to their son's bedside.|$|R

Have I done thee wrong or injury? if so, yet do not avenge it so cruelly. See, Elspat MacTavish, who never kneeled before even to a priest, falls {{prostrate}} before her own son, and craves his forgiveness." [...] And at once she threw herself on her knees before the young man, seized on his hand, <b>and</b> <b>kissing</b> <b>it</b> an hundred <b>times,</b> repeated as often, in heart-breaking accents, the most earnest entreaties for forgiveness. [...] "Pardon," [...] she exclaimed, [...] "pardon, {{for the sake of}} your father's ashes--pardon, {{for the sake of the}} pain with which I bore thee, the care with which I nurtured thee!--Hear it, Heaven, and behold it, Earth--the mother asks pardon of her child, and she is refused!" ...|$|R

The cost of the trip enforced a strict selection, a quarter of the pilgrims belonged to the nobility. The birth, in 1871, of the French Third Republic had marked a decline of the conservative rights power. Forced onto the defensive, the royalist bourgeoisie perceived a strong Church as an important means of safeguarding Frances integrity and its future. The rise of a militant nationalist Catholicism, a trend that would, in 1894, result in the anti-Semitic scapegoating and trumped-up treason conviction of Alfred Dreyfus was a development that Thérèse did not at all perceive. Still a sheltered child, Thérèse lived in ignorance of political events and motivations.|$|R
6000|$|Meantime {{the letter}} lay in Agnes's desk, {{and now and}} again she would think of poor {{resolute}} hard-working Phil among the cobras and tigers of Darjiling, toiling in the vain hope that she might come back to him. Her husband was worth ten Phils, except that he had rheumatism of the heart.

It was wrong and improper, of course, but she decided, as heroines do in novels, to find her old lover, to offer him her hand and her gold, and with him {{spend the rest of}} her life in some spot far from unsympathetic souls. She sat for two months, alone in Watson's Hotel, elaborating this decision, and the picture was a pretty one. Then she set out in search of Phil Garron, Assistant on a tea plantation with a more than usually unpronounceable name.|$|R
