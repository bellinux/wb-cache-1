5|$|A signal {{travelling}} <b>along</b> <b>an</b> {{electrical transmission}} line will be partly, or wholly, reflected {{back in the}} opposite direction when the travelling signal encounters a discontinuity in the characteristic impedance of the line, or if {{the far end of the}} line is not terminated in its characteristic impedance. This can happen, for instance, if two lengths of dissimilar transmission lines are joined together.|$|E
5|$|A {{tropical}} disturbance formed {{south of the}} Gulf of Tehuantepec on September23. Steered by a deep layer high over Mexico, the disturbance moved west for four days before attaining tropical depression status. Upon becoming a tropical cyclone the depression was situated over warm waters; however, wind shear subsequently increased {{in the vicinity of}} the storm. Therefore, significant development was impeded as the depression curved back to the north <b>along</b> <b>an</b> adjacent upper-level low.|$|E

5|$|A {{wide variety}} of weather can be found <b>along</b> <b>an</b> {{occluded}} front, with thunderstorms possible, but usually their passage {{is associated with a}} drying of the air mass. Within the occlusion of the front, a circulation of air brings warm air upward and sends drafts of cold air downward, or vice versa depending on the occlusion the front is experiencing. Precipitations and clouds are associated with the trowal, the projection on the Earth's surface of the tongue of warm air aloft formed during the occlusion process of the depression.|$|E
5|$|Axons {{transmit}} {{signals to}} other neurons {{by means of}} specialized junctions called synapses. A single axon may make as many as several thousand synaptic connections with other cells. When an action potential, traveling <b>along</b> <b>an</b> axon, arrives at a synapse, it causes a chemical called a neurotransmitter to be released. The neurotransmitter binds to receptor molecules in the membrane of the target cell.|$|E

5|$|Highway {{engineers}} evaluated {{factors such}} as grading, curve radius and the narrow median used along the Middle Road (which was inaugurated on August 23, 1940, as the Queen Elizabeth Way), and began to plan {{the course of a}} new dual highway mostly parallel to Highway2, with precedence given to areas most hampered by congestion. Unlike the Queen Elizabeth Way (QEW), this highway would not be built <b>along</b> <b>an</b> existing road, but rather on a new right-of-way, avoiding the need to provide access to properties.|$|E
5|$|In 1279 A.D., the {{downfall}} of the Chola dynasty seems imminent as the Pandyas drive the Chola people out of their kingdom in southern India. To escape them and save the life of his successor the Chola emperor sends his son along with the Chola people to a secret territory. The refugees take <b>along</b> <b>an</b> idol sacred to the Pandyas, angering them. To capture the escaped Cholas and the stolen idol, the Pandyas extend their invasion to unexplored territories but cannot find them.|$|E

5|$|M-43 {{is a state}} {{trunkline}} {{highway in}} southwestern and central parts of the US state of Michigan. The highway runs from South Haven to Webberville <b>along</b> <b>an</b> indirect path through both rural areas and larger cities.

5|$|Moderate {{rainfall}} {{resulted in}} river flooding along the St. Johns River, resulting in flooding along roads in Seminole County. Roadway, urban, and lowland flooding was also reported in Brevard and Orange counties. Roadway flooding was extensive in some areas, resulting in road closures in Oviedo, Cocoa Beach, and Cape Canaveral. Heavy rainfall in Pinellas Park caused heavy street flooding <b>along</b> <b>an</b> intersection on U.S. Highway 19. No casualties were reported, and damage was minor.|$|E
5|$|Negative {{oxidation}} {{states can}} occur as Zintl phases, as either free lead anions, as in Ba2Pb, with lead formally being lead(−IV), or in oxygen-sensitive ring-shaped or polyhedral cluster ions {{such as the}} trigonal bipyramidal Pb52− ion, where two lead atoms are lead(−I) and three are lead(0). In such anions, each atom is at a polyhedral vertex and contributes two electrons to each covalent bond <b>along</b> <b>an</b> edge from their sp3 hybrid orbitals, the other two being an external lone pair. They may be made in liquid ammonia via the reduction of lead by sodium.|$|E

Seismographic mapping completed by geologists revealed monoclines, anticlines, and synclines, all of which suggest deformation during the Paleozoic era, when strike-slip faulting took place nearby. The fault runs <b>along</b> <b>an</b> ancient Precambrian terrane boundary. It was active mainly in the Late Pennsylvanian and Early Permian epochs around 300 million years ago.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. In {{this paper}} we study the {{convergence}} behavior of grafting rays to the Thurston boundary of Teichmüller space. When the grafting is done <b>along</b> <b>a</b> weighted system of simple closed curves or <b>along</b> <b>a</b> maximal uniquely ergodic lamination this behavior {{is the same}} as for Teichmüller geodesics and lines of minima. We also show that the ray grafted <b>along</b> <b>a</b> weighted system of simple closed curves is at bounded distance from Teichmüller geodesic. 1...|$|R
50|$|Two major {{highways}} {{run through}} the city. US Highway 67 runs <b>along</b> <b>a</b> north-south route, while Illinois Route 16 runs <b>along</b> <b>a</b> west-east route. Also, Illinois Route 109 has its northern terminus in Jerseyville at US Highway 67.|$|R
5|$|The {{first section}} of roadway to receive the M-109 {{designation}} was in place and signed on maps by May 1, 1929. The roadway was a spur from M-22 north of Empire that ended at Glen Haven, {{just west of the}} D.H. Day State Park. The highway was extended east <b>along</b> <b>an</b> existing road between Glen Haven and Glen Arbor. This extension was in place by May 1, 1933, completing the modern routing of M-109. The highway was fully paved in 1939.|$|E
5|$|The most {{expedient}} {{approach for}} a large-scale assault on Warsaw {{was from the}} east. Terrain was mostly flat; numerous roads converged radially <b>along</b> <b>an</b> arc from the Modlin Fortress to the north (where the Narew flows into the Vistula), to Legionowo, Radzymin, and Mińsk Mazowiecki directly to the east. Meanwhile, the only permanent defences {{in the area of}} Radzymin were the incomplete Fort Beniaminów and a line of First World War trenches west of Radzymin, neglected since their construction by Russians and Germans in 1915.|$|E
5|$|The {{surviving}} wall runs <b>along</b> <b>an</b> alleyway {{that was}} part of the prison, now called Angel Place. The name Angel Place has led to confusion because there were two alleyways on the north side of the Marshalsea (Angel Court and Angel Alley), the first of which Dickens refers to when giving directions to the prison remains in 1857. See , which shows Angel Court/Angel Alley near the Borough Goal , marked by the number 2.|$|E
