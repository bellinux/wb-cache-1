5|$|He {{spent much}} of his time writing {{articles}} in military journals on Soviet strategic operations and most notably, co-authored the six-volume work on Soviet involvement during World War II, The Soviet Union's Great Patriotic War (1941–1945). In August 1967, Bagramyan accompanied General Secretary Leonid Brezhnev and Premier Alexei Kosygin to North Vietnam, where they met with Vietnamese leaders as he, serving in the role of a military expert, helped negotiate the transfer of logistics and <b>arms</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> country during the Vietnam War.|$|E

2500|$|The Grand Trunk {{was a part}} of {{a larger}} scheme of Brindley's <b>to</b> link <b>the</b> four main rivers of England (Trent, Mersey, Severn and Thames) in a project known as the [...] "Grand Cross". The Trent and Mersey Canal {{provided}} the northern <b>arm</b> of <b>the</b> cross (<b>to</b> <b>the</b> Mersey), and <b>the</b> eastern <b>arm</b> (<b>to</b> <b>the</b> Trent). It also provided the central hub of the cross, between Great Haywood, and Fradley Junctions. <b>The</b> western <b>arm,</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Severn, was built as the Staffordshire and Worcestershire Canal, whilst <b>the</b> southern <b>arm</b> (<b>to</b> <b>the</b> Thames) traversed the Coventry and Oxford Canals.|$|R
5|$|In August 1536, the {{new city}} was besieged by the troops of Manco Inca, {{the leader of}} an Inca {{rebellion}} against Spanish rule. The Spaniards and their native allies, headed by Pizarro himself, defeated the rebels after heavy fighting in the city streets and its surroundings. On November 3, 1536, the Spanish Crown confirmed the founding and, on December 7, 1537, emperor Charles V granted a coat of <b>arms</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> city.|$|E
5|$|In December 1919, Meyszner {{was placed}} {{in charge of the}} border {{gendarmerie}} at the Styrian town of Judenburg, on the frontier with the newly created Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes (later Yugoslavia), and was involved in fighting there. That year, he had become involved with the German-nationalist sporting association Deutsch-Völkischen Turnvereins and was made a leader in the right-wing paramilitary Steirischen Heimatschutz (Styrian Home Guard). He later used his senior position in the gendarmerie to funnel <b>arms</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Home Guard.|$|E
5|$|Notable arms {{attributed}} to biblical figures include {{the arms of}} Jesus based on the instruments of the Passion, and the shield of the Trinity. Medieval literature attributed coats of <b>arms</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Nine Worthies, including Alexander the Great, Julius Caesar, and King Arthur. Arms were given to many kings predating heraldry, including Edward the Confessor and William I of England. These attributed arms were sometimes used in practice as quarterings {{in the arms of}} their descendants.|$|E

5|$|Also {{hidden from}} {{scrutiny}} was the growing antagonism between the Khmer Rouge and their North Vietnamese allies. The radical {{leadership of the}} party could never escape the suspicion that Hanoi had designs on building an Indochinese federation with the North Vietnamese as its master. The Khmer Rouge were ideologically tied to the Chinese, while North Vietnam's chief supporters, the Soviet Union, still recognized the Lon Nol government as legitimate. After {{the signing of the}} Paris Peace Accords, PAVN cut off the supply of <b>arms</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Khmer Rouge, hoping to force them into a cease-fire. When the Americans were freed by the signing of the accords to turn their air power completely on the Khmer Rouge, this too was blamed on Hanoi. During the year, these suspicions and attitudes led the party leadership to carry out purges within their ranks. Most of the Hanoi-trained members were then executed on the orders of Pol Pot.|$|E
5|$|As the Cold War {{developed}} and the Guatemalan government clashed with U.S. corporations on {{an increasing number}} of issues, the U.S. government grew increasingly suspicious of the Guatemalan Revolution. In addition, the Cold War predisposed the Truman administration to see the Guatemalan government as communist. Arévalo's support for the Caribbean Legion also worried the Truman administration, which saw it as a vehicle for communism, rather than as the anti-dictatorial force it was conceived as. Until the end of its term, the Truman administration had relied on purely diplomatic and economic means to try and reduce the perceived communist influence. The U.S. had refused to sell <b>arms</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Guatemalan government after 1944; in 1951 it began to block all weapons purchases by Guatemala.|$|E
5|$|Göring (who {{controlled}} Rheinmetall-Borsig) supplied <b>arms</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Republicans; {{shipped to}} Greece supposedly for their use, the arms were transferred by Bodosakis to ships supposedly sailing to Mexico. He was also supplying the Nationalists, {{who got the}} best and latest weapons while the Republicans got the oldest and least serviceable. This supply peaked in 1937–38. Nationalists identified 18 vessels to Republican ports from 3 January 1937 and 11 May 1938, and estimated that Goering received the equivalent of one pound sterling per rifle. An earlier shipment from Hamburg to Alicante on 1 October 1936 by the Welsh ship Bramhill had 19,000 rifles, 101 machine guns and more than 20 million cartridges for the CNT militia in Barcelona. Nazi Germany also helped the propaganda war with a gift of a Telefunken transmitter for the newly created national radio service.|$|E

5|$|In {{the early}} 18th century Henry Hare, 3rd Baron Coleraine (1694–1749) oversaw a remodelling {{of the north}} of the house, that added a range of rooms to the north and the Coleraine coat of <b>arms</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> {{pediment}} of the north facade. In the late 18th century, under the ownership of James Townsend, the narrow east facade of the house was remodelled into an entrance front, and given the appearance of a typical Georgian house. At the same time, the south front's gabled attics were removed, giving the house's southern elevation its current appearance. An inventory of the house made in 1789 in preparation for its sale listed a hall, saloon, drawing room, dining room and breakfast parlour on the ground floor, with a library and billiard room on the first floor.|$|E
5|$|Sometimes {{arms were}} {{purchased}} {{on the black}} market from German soldiers or their allies, or stolen from German supply depots or transports. Purchases were made by individual units and sometimes by individual soldiers. As Germany's prospects for victory diminished and the morale in German units dropped, the number of soldiers willing to sell their weapons correspondingly increased and thus made this source more important. All such purchases were highly risky, as the Gestapo was well aware of this black market in arms and tried to check it by setting up sting operations. For the most part this trade was limited to personal weapons, but occasionally light and heavy machine guns could also be purchased. It was much easier to trade with Italian and Hungarian units stationed in Poland, which more willingly sold their <b>arms</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Polish underground as long as they could conceal this trade from the Germans.|$|E
5|$|The ARF {{became a}} major {{political}} force in Armenian life. It was especially active in the Ottoman Empire, where it organized or participated in many revolutionary activities. In 1894, the ARF {{took part in the}} Sasun Resistance, supplying <b>arms</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> local population to help the people of Sasun defend themselves against the Hamidian purges. In June 1896, the Armenakans organized the Defense of Van in the province of Van, where Ottoman Hamidieh soldiers were to attack the city. The Armenakans, assisted by members of the Hunchakian and ARF parties, supplied all able-bodied men of Van with weapons. They rose to defend the civilians from the attack and subsequent massacre.|$|E

5|$|The {{reason behind}} these discords were {{laid on the}} {{imperfect}} execution of the reorganisation of the College in 1568 and the uncertainty over issue of granting <b>arms</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> new and emerging gentry of the era. An enquiry into {{the state of the}} College lasted for one year, finally reporting to William Cecil, Baron Burghley in 1596; as a consequence, many important measures of reform for the College were made in the reign of James I. Eventually, these animosities among the heralds in the College ended only after the expulsion of one and the death of another.|$|E
5|$|The {{security}} of the southern bands depended on French trade in arms, and this was disrupted by the French and Indian War (1754–63). In 1763, France surrendered the Louisiana Territory {{under the terms of}} the Treaty of Fontainebleau. Great Britain obtained the portion of the territory east of the Mississippi River. Spain received the territory west of the Mississippi, including New Orleans, although they did not make their claim to that city effective until Governor Alejandro O'Reilly suppressed the Rebellion of 1768. Once in control of New Orleans, the Spanish imposed severe restrictions on trade up the Mississippi, cutting off the supply of <b>arms</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Southern Pawnees and Wichitas.|$|E
5|$|Under the Hanoverian kings {{certain of}} the {{officers}} also held heraldic office.
