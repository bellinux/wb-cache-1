This {{is based on a}} Time magazine picture of Obama listening to the U.S. National Anthem with his hands <b>at</b> <b>his</b> <b>sides</b> while the others on stage have their right hands over their hearts. He does, in fact, say the Pledge and sometimes led the Senate in doing so.|$|E
2500|$|After an {{incident}} in Washington in 1993, most US and other pool builders are reluctant to equip a residential swimming pool with a diving springboard so home diving pools are much less common these days. In the incident, 14-year-old Shawn Meneely made a [...] "suicide dive" [...] (his hands <b>at</b> <b>his</b> <b>sides</b> – so his head hit the bottom first) in a private swimming pool and became a tetraplegic. The lawyers for the family, Jan Eric Peterson and Fred Zeder, successfully sued the diving board manufacturer, the pool builder, and the National Spa and Pool Institute over the inappropriate depth of the pool.|$|E
2500|$|The print {{depicts the}} {{character}} Satake Shinjūrō {{in a dramatic}} standing pose. His appearance {{is that of a}} samurai, his hair styled in a [...] topknot, his feet bare. Her wears a short, bright red kimono decorated with thin white vertical stripes. Over this, he wears a simple grey [...] jacket whose only decoration is a flower motif [...] family crest, which may be a plum blossom variant. His arms have been removed from the sleeves of his haori which hang down <b>at</b> <b>his</b> <b>sides,</b> and he has a sageo string holding back the long sleeves of his kimono. Both of these are intended to increase his mobility, particularly in combat.|$|E

2500|$|Lennie Small: A mentally disabled, but {{physically}} {{strong man}} who travels with George and is his constant companion. He dreams of [...] "living off the fatta' the lan'" [...] {{and being able}} to tend to rabbits. His love for soft things conspires against him, mostly because he does not know his own strength, and eventually becomes his undoing. Steinbeck defines his appearance as George's [...] "opposite," [...] writing that he is a [...] "huge man, shapeless of face, with large, pale eyes" [...] and [...] "wide, sloping shoulders." [...] Lennie walks heavily, dragging his feet a little, [...] "the way a bear drags his paws," [...] adding that his arms do not swing <b>at</b> <b>his</b> <b>sides,</b> but hang loosely.|$|E

5000|$|After 1883, Edwin Conant was ill {{for many}} years. The {{death of his}} daughter, the last member of his {{immediate}} family did much to bring about his decline in health. He continued to live in his mansion on State Street in Worcester. <b>At</b> <b>his</b> <b>side</b> all these later years was his nurse, Henry K. Cady, who was also <b>at</b> <b>his</b> <b>side</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> funeral.|$|R

60|$|Werper's hands dropped limply <b>at</b> <b>his</b> <b>sides.</b> He {{stood looking}} at the girl; but he could find no words to reply to her. Her {{innocent}} arraignment of his true purposes was unanswerable.|$|E

60|$|Sheldon laughed, and for {{the first}} time with true spontaneity. The {{intrinsic}} ridiculousness of the situation was too much for his sense of humour.

60|$|In the {{dim light}} the big stooped figure of Thomas Cole seemed extra menacing. His long arms hung down loosely <b>at</b> <b>his</b> <b>sides.</b> His face was lost in shadow.

6000|$|His voice {{failed him}} utterly, but he walked erect and martial, the sun blazing on his white forehead, his hands {{clinched}} <b>at</b> <b>his</b> <b>sides.</b> There were {{many of his}} parishioners in the streets, {{and several of the}} women broke into bitter weeping as he passed, and many of the men imprecated the boy who was bringing white lines of sorrow into his father's hair. [...] "This is the logical end of his lawless bringing up," [...] said one.|$|E

"Stay, my {{petticoat}} is warmer," [...] cried Alice, hastily divesting {{herself of}} a flannel garment of bright scarlet, the brilliant beauty {{of which had}} long been the admiration of {{the entire population of}} Sandy Cove. The child spread it over the seaman's chest, and tucked it carefully down <b>at</b> <b>his</b> <b>sides,</b> between his body and the wet garments. Then the three sat down beside him, and, each seizing a limb, began to rub and chafe with a degree of energy that nothing could resist! At any rate it put life into John Bumpus, for that hardy mariner gradually began to exhibit signs of returning vitality.|$|E
