40|$|It is well {{established}} that bacteria are able to catalyze dissolution of silicate minerals. Bacteria may dissolve silicates for two different purposes. They may use certain elements that can undergo redox transitions as substrates for their energetic metabolism or they can leach nutrients, that are otherwise unaccessible in their habitat. The main mechanisms of bacterially mediated silicate leaching are <b>acidic</b> or basic <b>catalysis</b> and surface complexation. The main nutrients extracted are K, Mg, P and Fe. The only element significantly exploited as substrate for dissimilative energetic metabolism is iron. In order to leach iron as a nutrient, even extremely strong complexants (i. e. siderophores) may be employed. However, only moderate complexing agents can serve to obtain iron as terminal electron acceptor. The second possibility is to reduce iron directly in the crystal grid {{by means of the}} conductive nanofibres. The oxidative dissolution of silicates by chemoautotrophs is rare, in contrast to that of sulfides. Bacterial dissolution of silicates leaves morphological and geochemical signatures, but it is still problematic to recognize and interpret them.

The early biosynthetic {{steps of the}} enediyne moiety of dynemicins are catalyzed by an iterative polyketide synthase (DynE 8) and a thioesterase (DynE 7). Recent studies indicate that the function of DynE 7 is to off-load the linear biosynthetic intermediate assembled on DynE 8. Here, we report crystal structures of DynE 7 in its free form at 2. 7 Å resolution and of DynE 7 in complex with the DynE 8 -produced all-trans pentadecen- 2 -one at 2. 1 Å resolution. These crystal structures reveal that upon ligand binding, significant conformational changes throughout the substrate-binding tunnel result in an expanded tunnel that traverses an entire monomer of the tetrameric DynE 7 protein.

We report the presence in the S 1 subsite of Arg- 887 (Arg- 878 in mouse APA), the guanidinium moiety of which established an interaction with the electronegative sulfonate group of EC 33. Mutagenic replacement of Arg- 878 with an alanine or a lysine residue decreased the affinity of the recombinant enzymes for the acidic substrate, α-L-glutamyl-β-naphthylamide, with a slight decrease in substrate hydrolysis velocity either with or without Ca 2 +. In the absence of Ca 2 +, the mutations modified the substrate specificity of APA for the acidic substrate, the mutated enzymes hydrolyzing more efficiently basic and neutral substrates, although the addition of Ca 2 + partially restored the acidic substrate specificity. The analysis of the 3 D models of the Arg- 878 mutated APAs revealed a change in the volume of the S 1 subsite, which may impair the binding and/or the optimal positioning of the substrate in the active site as well as its hydrolysis.

Nesse estudo, foi avaliada a produção de biodiesel etílico, a partir de diferentes lotes de óleos de tucumã do amazonas, com índices de acidez baixos e elevados, pela transesterificação por catálise básica e ácida homogêneas, respectivamente. Na catálise ácida, foram testados HCl e H 2 SO 4 como catalisadores nas concentrações de 0, 0625 a 1, 000 M, empregando etanol hidratado na proporção molar de 1 : 6 e a reação conduzida a 90 ºC por 24 h.

The most efficient methods for the esterification of unsaturated fatty acids in the oils analyzed were JAC, ISO, and BBA. Nevertheless, the reagent BF 3 in methanol, used in the JAC method, is extremely toxic. Thus, when the oil to be analyzed has low acidity, the basic catalysis methods ISO and BBA can be used instead, since they use inexpensive reagents of low toxicity. The results obtained showed that the choice of a method for the analysis of fatty acids also depends on the composition of the oil to be studied...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{summarizes}} recent {{literature data}} and presents new experimental {{data on the}} mechanisms of chemical modification, hydrolysis and polycondensation of the alkoxides and demonstrates possibilities to approach new classes of materials, exploiting these mechanisms. Low reactivity of silicon alkoxides is improved by either basic catalysis exploiting an SN 2 mechanism or <b>acidic</b> <b>catalysis</b> facilitating a proton-assisted SN 1 mechanism {{as well as by}} modification with chelating ligands. Metal alkoxides are much stronger Lewis bases compared to silicon alkoxides and the acidity of water is strong enough to achieve their rapid hydrolysis via proton-assisted SN 1 pathway {{even in the absence of}} additional catalysts. Introduction of the modifying chelating ligands is leading generally to increased charge distribution in the precursor molecules. Modifying chelating ligands are also appreciably smaller than the alkoxide ligands they replace. The modification with chelating ligands is thus facilitating the kinetics of hydrolysis and polycondensation. The size and shape of the primary particles formed in sol-gel treatment of metal alkoxides are defined not by kinetic factors in their hydrolysis and polycondensation but by the interactions on the phase boundary, which is in its turn directed by the ligand properties. The products of the fast hydrolysis and condensation sequence consist of micelles templated by self-assembly of ligands (mainly oxo-species). This concept provides explanations for commonly observed material properties and allows for the development of new strategies for the preparation of materials. We discuss the formation of inverted micelles, obtained by the appropriate choice of solvents, which allows for the formation of hollow spheres. The modifying β-diketonate ligands act as the surfactant and form an interface between the hollow sphere and the solvent. Retention of ligands inside the gel particles is possible only if ligands possessing both chelating and bridging properties are applied. Application of such ligands, for example, diethanolamine, permits to prepare new transition metal oxide based microporous membranes...|$|E
40|$|The {{formulation}} of innovative transparent hydrorepellent coatings is strongly motivated {{in order to}} satisfy the market request and necessity to improve the cleanability of the sanitarywares. A lot of attention is devoted to the use of cheap precursors, low temperature synthesis process and industrial scalability potentiality. In this framework, in the present paper the set-up of the deposition of modified SiO 2 coatings on glazed ceramic supports by spraying technique was reported. Several solutions were formulated using as precursor tetraethylorthosilicate (TEOS) and co-precursor methyltriethoxysilane (MTES) in different molar ratios (i. e. 50 : 50, 25 : 75, 75 : 25), in suitable solvents and mixture of solvents (i. e. H 2 O, ethanol). The influence of the process parameters (i. e. precursors ratio, solvents, catalyser, annealing temperature) on the properties of the produced coatings was deeply investigated by means of scanning electron microscopy (SEM), simultaneous thermogravimetric and differential analyses (TG–DTA), infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), X-Ray diffraction (XRD) and Vickers microhardness. Their hydrophobic behaviour was tested by the measurements of the static water contact angles and the chemical and stain resistance by the conformity to some tests of the standard UNI 4543. The obtained coatings were amorphous, homogeneous, uniform, thin (average thickness 300 nm), crack-free, leading to an improved hardness value of the glazed ceramic support (4. 47 GPa vs 3. 68 GPa for the coated and uncoated substrates, respectively), and allowed to improve both the hydrophobic behaviour and the chemical and stains resistance of the glazed sanitaryware supports, {{on the basis of the}} standard UNI 4543. The best hydrophobic performances were revealed in the case of coatings prepared starting from <b>acidic</b> <b>catalysis</b> derived precursor solutions. Moreover, the highest water contact angle values were detected for lower temperatures annealing, due to the methyl groups preservation, in agreement with the FT-IR and TG–DTA findings...|$|E
40|$|The amphidinolides are marine {{macrolides}} {{extracted from}} dinoflagellates {{of the genus}} Amphidinium. To date, 37 amphidinolides have been isolated and identified, most of them possessing cytotoxicity against human cancer cell lines. Among these, amphidinolides C, F, C 2 and C 3 represent synthetic targets of interest owing to their scarcity, structural complexity and promising biological activities. This thesis describes the work realised towards the total synthesis of amphidinolides C and F, {{with a focus on}} the different strategies investigated and the key fragments synthesised. In the first approach, the C 18 −C 29 fragment of amphidinolide F was prepared using an intramolecular etherification of an epoxide under <b>acidic</b> <b>catalysis</b> to produce the 2, 5 -trans-disubstituted tetrahydrofuran ring featured in the natural product. Unfortunately, dithiane alkylation with the C 1 −C 17 iodide counterpart generated the desired coupling product in low yield. A second approach proposing to build the C 17 −C 18 bond by a silicon-tethered RCM proved unsuccessful, because the requisite diene could not be obtained. It was then envisioned to form the C 18 −C 19 bond by displacement of a triflate with an alkyne and install the ketone at C 18 by a protoborylation/oxidation sequence. To this end, the C 19 −C 29 triflate precursor was synthesised. Displeasingly, the C 1 −C 18 alkyne counterpart (work by Dr Filippo Romiti) could not be prepared and coupling of the two fragments was not attempted. In the latest approach, the C 10 −C 29 fragment of amphidinolide F was obtained employing a boron-mediated aldol condensation and a dithiane alkylation to form the C 13 −C 14 and C 18 −C 19 bonds. Several endgame strategies were examined including the successful Yamaguchi esterification of the C 13 -epi C 10 −C 29 fragment and the C 1 −C 9 acid. A challenging Stille crosscoupling was then effected to close the macrocycle but only yielded the desired macrolactone in trace amounts after global desilylation...|$|E
40|$|The {{analysis}} of quaternary ammonium salts (QAS) using GC is often performed by "in injector" pyrolysis to create volatile degradation products for quantification purposes. Besides {{the risk of}} severe system contamination, the application of this approach on aqueous samples is problematic. In this work, the sample is treated in a vial with 2, 2 -dimethoxypropane (DMP) under <b>acidic</b> <b>catalysis.</b> In addition to the removal of water and sample enrichment, the QAS are decomposed. As HS transfers only volatile compounds to the GC system, contamination is avoided. It was found that depending {{on the presence of}} benzyl, phenyl or methyl groups on the quaternary nitrogen; benzyl chloride, N,N-dimethylaniline or chloromethane are formed respectively in the sealed vial. All these can be used as an analytical target. A calibration curve for benzyl chloride could be derived from the pure compound. Chloromethane was generated from pure benzyldimethyldecylammonium chloride (BEDIDE), a pure QAS with benzyl and methyl groups, to construct a secondary calibration curve using a back analysis approach. It has been proven that by quantifying the formed analytical targets, the mass balance for the QAS under investigation was close to 100 %. The presented procedure allows the quantification of any aromatic substituted QAS without the need for a matching reference, which is a major advantage over existing CE and LC methods The proposed methodology was validated for mouth sprays containing benzethonium chloride (BZTCl) or benzoxonium chloride (BZOCl) and for denatonium benzoate (DB) in ethylene glycol (EG) based cooling liquids. Results showed that the approach provided excellent linearity (R(2) ≥ 0. 999) and limits of detection around 0. 01 μg/vial for benzyl chloride. It was found that the reaction product of DMP and glycerol which was also present in the mouthspray and some cooling liquids, caused chromatographic interference with benzyl chloride. Treating those samples in the vial with N,O-bis(trimethylsilyl) trifluoroacetamide (BSTFA) after the enrichment step removes the interference and leaves a possible pathway for the simultaneous determination of glycerol in those samples. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|CdS {{nanoparticles}} (NPs) were synthesized using colloidal {{methods and}} incorporated within a diureasil hybrid matrix. The surface capping of the CdS NPs by 3 -mercaptopropyltrimethoxysilane (MPTMS) and 3 -aminopropyltrimethoxysilane (APTMS) organic ligands during {{the incorporation of}} the NPs within the hybrid matrix has been investigated. The matrix is based on poly(ethylene oxide) /poly(propylene oxide) chains grafted to a siliceous skeleton through urea bonds and was produced by sol–gel process. Both alkaline and <b>acidic</b> <b>catalysis</b> of the sol–gel reaction were {{used to evaluate the}} effect of each organic ligand on the optical properties of the CdS NPs. The hybrid materials were characterized by absorption, steady-state and time-resolved photoluminescence spectroscopy and High Resolution Transmission Electron Microscopy (HR-TEM). The preservation of the optical properties of the CdS NPs within the diureasil hybrids was dependent on the experimental conditions used. Both organic ligands (APTMS and MPTMS) demonstrated to be crucial in avoiding the increase of size distribution and clustering of the NPs within the hybrid matrix. The use of organic ligands was also shown to influence the level of interaction between the hybrid host and the CdS NPs. The CdS NPs showed large Stokes shifts and long average lifetimes, both in colloidal solution and in the xerogels, due to the origin of the PL emission in surface states. The CdS NPs capped with MPTMS have lower PL lifetimes compared to the other xerogel samples but still larger than the CdS NPs in the original colloidal solution. An increase in PL lifetimes of the NPs after their incorporation within the hybrid matrix is related to interaction between the NPs and the hybrid host matrix.

40|$|Chlorine gas {{bleaching}} was {{a common}} method used in pulp industries. As a consequence, significant amounts of chlorine were discharged into surrounding aquatic ecosystems, affecting the biota. Chlorinated organic pollutants are formed when chlorine react with organic material. Octadecanoic acid (stearic acid) {{is one of the}} most common saturated fatty acids in aquatic biota. In a naturally occurring process two and four chlorine atoms, respectively, are added over the unsaturated bonds, forming 9, 10 -dichloro octadecanoic acid and 9, 10, 12, 13 -tetrachloro octadecanoic acid. These are the chlorinated fatty acids (ClFA) under investigation in this Bachelor’s Thesis. The methodological framework for measuring ClFA is investigated in this essay. The scope is to evaluate the method of isolating and quantifying the compounds as described in Åkesson-Nilsson’s (2004) dissertation. The method includes: extraction of the lipid, transesterification (where the fatty acids, including the ClFAs, are separated from the lipids and transformed into their respective methyl esters through two methods, <b>acidic</b> <b>catalysis</b> with BF 3 or H 2 SO 4), separation (by solid phase extraction) and determination of ClFA concentration with a halogen specific detector (GC-XSD/MS). Furthermore, the scope is to investigate collected fish samples (from Norrsundet) with the abovementioned method. By making a dilution series with known concentrations it was possible to establish calibration curves, to give in an indication of the effectiveness of the method. BF 3 is in need of updating due to being experienced as slower and less stable than the H 2 SO 4 -method. However, it was concluded that the H 2 SO 4 -method was more effective on the standard samples and that the BF 3 -method was more effective on the fish lipid samples. In one of the lipid samples (lavaret transesterified with BF 3) a detectable concentration of 9, 10, 12, 13 -tetrachloro octadecanoic acid was discovered. Therefore, we question SEPAs decision to cancel investigations in Norrsundet. Our results could indicate that ClFAs are still an issue that could affect the ecosystem’s biota. ...|$|E
