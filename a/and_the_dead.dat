5|$|Caddisflies {{are best}} known for the {{portable}} cases created by their larvae. About thirty families of caddisfly, members of the suborder Integripalpia, adopt this stratagem. These larvae eat detritus, largely decaying vegetable material, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>dead</b> leaf fragments on which they feed tend to accumulate in hollows, in slow-moving sections of streams and behind stones and tree roots. The cases provide protection to the larvae as they make their way between these resources.|$|E
5|$|Calan Gaeaf, {{associated}} with the supernatural <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>dead,</b> is observed on 1 November (All Saints Day). It has largely been replaced by Hallowe'en.

5|$|At present, {{there are}} two ways to get to Arad: by air or road. The only highway {{connecting}} Arad with the rest of the country is Highway 31, which connects it with Beersheba to the west, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Dead</b> Sea to the east. It has two junctions within Arad's municipal area—the Arad Junction (within the city itself, with Road 3199), and the Tel Arad Junction (with Highway 80). The local Road 3199 connects Arad with Masada, but does not connect to the road next to the dead sea (Highway 90). It is therefore the only way to get to Masada's western side.|$|E
5|$|At {{this early}} stage, the term punk {{applied to the}} scene in general, not {{necessarily}} a particular stylistic approach as it would later—the early New York punk bands represented a broad variety of influences. Among them, the Ramones, the Heartbreakers, Richard Hell and the Voidoids, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Dead</b> Boys were establishing a distinct musical style. Even where they diverged most clearly, in lyrical approach—the Ramones' apparent guilelessness at one extreme, Hell's conscious craft at the other—there was an abrasive attitude in common. Their shared attributes of minimalism and speed, however, had not yet come to define punk rock.|$|E

5|$|Beersheba was {{developed}} by the Ottoman Empire from a camel-trading centre on the northern edge of the Negev, halfway between the Mediterranean <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Dead</b> Sea. It was on the railway line which ran from Istanbul to Hafir el Auja (the main Ottoman desert base during the raid on the Suez Canal in 1915 until the EEF advance to Rafa outflanked it), and which was damaged beyond repair in May 1917 during an EEF raid. Beersheba's hospital, army barracks, railway station (with water tower), engine sheds, large storage buildings, and a square of houses, were well-designed and strongly-constructed stone buildings, with red tiled roofs and a German beer garden. The inhabitants of the region from Beersheba northwards varied; the population was mainly Arabs belonging to Sunni Islam, with some Jewish and Christian colonists.|$|E
5|$|Chlorine is too {{reactive}} {{to occur}} as the free element in nature but is very {{abundant in the}} form of its chloride salts. It is the twentieth most abundant element in Earth's crust and makes up 126parts per million of it, through the large deposits of chloride minerals, especially sodium chloride, that have been evaporated from water bodies. All of these pale in comparison to the reserves of chloride ions in seawater: smaller amounts at higher concentrations occur in some inland seas and underground brine wells, such as the Great Salt Lake in Utah <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Dead</b> Sea in Israel.|$|E
5|$|Christian doctrines {{include the}} beliefs that Jesus was {{conceived}} by the Holy Spirit, {{was born of}} a virgin named Mary, performed miracles, founded the Church, died by crucifixion as a sacrifice to achieve atonement, rose from the dead, and ascended into Heaven, from where he will return. Most Christians believe Jesus enables humans to be reconciled to God. The Nicene Creed asserts that Jesus will judge the living <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>dead</b> either before or after their bodily resurrection, an event tied to the Second Coming of Jesus in Christian eschatology. The great majority of Christians worship Jesus as the incarnation of God the Son, the second of three persons of a Divine Trinity. A minority of Christian denominations reject Trinitarianism, wholly or partly, as non-scriptural.|$|E

5|$|DiCaprio's first {{effort of}} 1995 was Sam Raimi's The Quick <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Dead,</b> a western film. Sony Pictures was dubious over DiCaprio's casting, {{and as a}} result, co-star Sharon Stone decided to pay the actor's salary herself. The film was {{released}} to a dismal box office performance, barely grossing US$18.5 million in the US, and received mixed reviews from critics. DiCaprio next starred in Total Eclipse, a fictionalized account of the homosexual relationship between Arthur Rimbaud and Paul Verlaine. He replaced River Phoenix, who died during pre-production on the project. A minor art-house success, the film grossed US$0.34 million throughout its domestic theatrical run.|$|E
5|$|In 1597, King James wrote a {{dissertation}} on witchcraft titled Daemonologie {{in which he}} wrote the belief that demons could possess both the living <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>dead.</b> Within his classification of demons, he explained the concept through the notion that incubi and succubae could possess the corpse of the deceased and walk the earth. As a devil borrows a dead body, it would seem so visibly and naturally to any man who converses with them and that any substance within the body would remain intolerably cold to others which they abuse.|$|E
5|$|In the {{subsequent}} battles of Ginchy and Morval, the 1/10th {{was engaged in}} a purely supporting role: trench networks were constructed and improved near Delville Wood, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>dead</b> collected and buried. A party of two officers and 100 other ranks {{was attached to the}} Third West Lancashire Field Ambulance during the Battle of Morval. After bivouacking at Pont Rémy, the battalion transferred with its division to the relatively quiet Ypres Salient in October. The routine of alternating between the front line, being in support, and in reserve preoccupied the battalion until the Third Battle of Ypres in July 1917. Casualties were nevertheless sustained by the battalion during this period, invariably as a result of shelling and sniping.|$|E
