40|$|<b>Arapaima</b> <b>gigas</b> {{is one of}} {{the largest}} {{freshwater}} fishes of the world. It is socially monogamous, forming pairs, constructing a nest and providing parental care. We performed a paternity analysis under three scenarios in captive, semi-natural and natural areas using 10 microsatellite markers. As a positive control, we analyzed three pairs and their offspring isolated individually in artificial breeding ponds (a priori very high probability of monogamy). We then analyzed two samples of offspring from large artificial ponds with multiple adults but only one reproductive pair (a priori high probability of monogamy), two samples from semi-natural breeding station with multiple adults but only one reproductive pair (a priori high probability of monogamy), and a sample from a natural lake with multiple adults, some potentially breeding (a priori medium probability of monogamy). Analysis of patterns of Mendelian heredity suggested an extra-pair contribution for all broods except the positive controls. Similarly, results based on multilocus analysis estimated at least two sib-groups per nest. These results reject monogamy as a system of breeding in <b>Arapaima</b> <b>gigas.</b> From a management perspective, this behavior may be exploited to maintain genetic diversity in captive and as well in wild populations of <b>Arapaima</b> <b>gigas...</b>|$|R

40|$|Abstract. —The giant and obligate {{air-breathing}} fish pirarucu <b>Arapaima</b> <b>gigas</b> (also {{known as}} arapaima) is a species endemic to the Amazon Basin {{that is increasingly}} managed by artisanal fishers because of government failure to control the fishery. In this study the ability of experienced artisanal fishers to {{count the number of}} pirarucu at the moment of aerial breathing was assessed. Counts were strongly correlated (r 5 0. 98) with mark–recapture abundance estimates calculated for the same populations. The potential for trained fishers to train other fishers to count pirarucu without slow and expensive mark–recapture work was also assessed and confirmed. Not only are the counts a cost-effective method for assessing pirarucu populations, they also allow fisher par-ticipation in decision making and contribute to effective management. The increasing number of community-based management schemes can now be matched with the training of fishers to count pirarucu.

50|$|Members of {{the order}} are notable for having toothed or bony tongues, and for having the forward part of the {{gastrointestinal}} tract pass {{to the left of}} the oesophagus and stomach (for all other fish it passes to the right). In other respects, osteoglossiform fishes vary considerably in size and form; the smallest is Pollimyrus castelnaui, at just 2 cm long, while the largest, the <b>arapaima</b> (<b>Arapaima</b> <b>gigas),</b> reaches as much as 2.5 m.|$|R
50|$|Large {{fish that}} live in the {{whitewater}} rivers enter the forest during the floods where they eat and disperse fruit. Fish include pacu (Metynnis and Mylossoma genera), tambaqui (Colossoma macropomum), pirarucu (<b>Arapaima</b> <b>gigas),</b> dusky narrow hatchetfish (Triportheus angulatus) and pirana (Serrasalmus genus).Smaller fish include angelfish (Pterophyllum scalare), blue discus (Symphysodon aequifasciatus), cichlids (Cichlasoma genus), characins (Anostomidae family), tetras (Hemigrammus and Hyphessobrycon genera), neon tetra (Paracheirodon innesi) and catfish (Aspredinidae, Callichthyidae, Doradidae and Loricariidae families).|$|R
50|$|There {{are over}} 40 species of mammals {{including}} the endangered jaguar (Panthera onca) and giant otter (Pteronura brasiliensis).There {{are more than}} 300 species of birds, including the endangered black-and-white hawk-eagle (Spizaetus melanoleucus) and harpy eagle (Harpia harpyja).The APA is home to many species of frogs, lizards and snakes, and several of turtles and alligators, including the endangered black caiman (Melanosuchus niger).Over 100 species of fish have been identified, including the endangered <b>Arapaima</b> <b>gigas.</b>|$|R
5|$|In the Amazon basin, when caimans became scarce as {{a result}} of {{overhunting}} in the mid-20th century, the number of local fish, such as the important <b>arapaima</b> (<b>Arapaima</b> <b>gigas),</b> also decreased. These are nutrient-poor waters, and the urine and faeces of the caimans may have increased primary production by contributing plant nutrients. Thus the presence of the reptiles could have benefited the fish stock; the number of crocodilians in a stretch of water appears to be correlated with the fish population.|$|R

40|$|The {{transition}} from aquatic to aerial respiration {{is associated with}} dramatic physiological changes in relation to gas exchange, ion regulation, acid–base balance and nitrogenous waste excretion. <b>Arapaima</b> <b>gigas</b> {{is one of the}} most obligate extant air-breathing fishes, representing a remarkable model system to investigate (1) how the {{transition from}} aquatic to aerial respiration affects gill design and (2) the relocation of physiological processes from the gills to the kidney during the evolution of air-breathing. <b>Arapaima</b> <b>gigas</b> undergoes a transition from water- to air-breathing during development, resulting in striking changes in gill morphology. In small fish (10 g), the gills are qualitatively similar in appearance to another closely related water-breathing fish (Osteoglossum bicirrhosum); however, as fish grow (100 – 1000 g), the inter-lamellar spaces become filled with cells, including mitochondria-rich (MR) cells, leaving only column-shaped filaments. At this stage, there is a high density of MR cells and strong immunolocalization of Na+/K+-ATPase along the outer cell layer of the gill filament. Despite the greatly reduced overall gill surface area, which is typical of obligate air-breathing fish, the gills may remain an important site for ionoregulation and acid–base regulation. The kidney is greatly enlarged in A. gigas relative to that in O. bicirrhosum and may comprise a significant pathway for nitrogenous waste excretion. Quantification of the physiological role of the gill and the kidney in A. gigas during development and in adults will yield important insights into developmental physiology and the evolution of air-breathing...|$|R

The first part describes {{the characterization of}} the natural materials including the teeth of predator and preys' aspects and <b>Arapaima</b> <b>gigas</b> scale. Based on the first part, several special features presented in the natural materials were investigated. In the second part, the special procedures of the fabrication of tailored hydroxyapatite (HAP) based composites by the novel consolidation technique of spark plasma sintering are developed. These procedures are bio-inspired by {{the findings of the}} first part of the study. A natural tooth is composed of the external layer, hard enamel which has high degree of mineralization and the internal region - tough dentin which has collagen fibrils and carbonated apatite mineral. The main feature in the dentin is the tubule structure. <b>Arapaima</b> <b>gigas</b> scales serve as armor-like materials to protect <b>Arapaima</b> <b>gigas</b> from being bitten by piranha. The scales have a laminate structure with the hard external layer and soft internal layers. Besides the hydroxyapatite mineral, the main building block of the scale is collagen fibers. The structure of teeth and scale were characterized using scanning electron microscopy and optical microscopy. The chemical compound was analyzed by X-ray diffraction, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy. Mechanical tests (microindentation, nanoindentation, tensile and compression tests) were performed to investigate the mechanical properties of those biological materials. The penetration test of piranha teeth on the arapaima scale was conducted to prove that the scale is stronger than the piranha tooth. In order to fabricate artificial dental materials inspired by the investigated structure of the natural teeth, spark plasma sintering involving high heating rates, shorter sintering times and low sintering temperatures was utilized to fabricate hydroxyapatite composites. Hydroxyapatite is widely used in biomedical applications, but its low mechanical strength limits its applications in heavy loaded implants. Carbon nanotube (CNT) - HAP composites were fabricated by spark plasma sintering and indicated that the addition of CNT can improve the mechanical strength of pure HAP. Unaxial freeze drying process was utilized to create a micro channel structure in the hydroxyapatite components. To maintain the porous structure of the tailored hydroxyapatite green specimens, a newly developed sintering process, Free Pressureless Spark Plasma Sintering(FPSPS), was used to consolidate the tailored hydroxyapatite without applying pressure. The comparison of the outcome of the treatment of hydroxyapatite components by conventional sintering and free pressureless spark plasma sintering was conducted showing that FPSPS can provide a better approach to consolidate the material with higher micro hardnes...|$|R
