25|$|Pericles governed Athens {{throughout}} the 5th century BC {{bringing to the}} city a splendour and a standard of living never previously experienced. <b>All</b> <b>was</b> <b>well</b> within the internal regiment of government, however discontent within the Delian League was ever increasing. The foreign affairs policies adopted by Athens did not reap the best results; members of the Delian League were increasingly dissatisfied. Athens was the city-state that dominated and subjugated the rest of Greece and these oppressed citizens wanted their independence.|$|E

Then in April, an infestation of rats was discovered, along with dampness, which destroyed all their stored corn. They needed food badly and Smith sent {{a large group of}} settlers to fish and others to gather shellfish downriver. They came back without food and were willing enough to take the meager rations offered them. This angered Smith and he ordered them to trade their guns and tools for fruit from the Native Americans and ordered everyone to work or be banished from the fort.|$|E

25|$|The {{situation}} was becoming tense {{and so the}} Uthman's administration had to investigate the origins and extent of anti-government propaganda and its aims. Some time around 654, Uthman called all the governors of his 12 provinces to Medina to discuss the problem. In this Council of Governors, Uthman directed the governors that they should adopt all the expedients they had suggested, according to local circumstances. Later, in the Majlis al Shurah (council of ministry), it was suggested to Uthman that reliable agents {{should be sent to}} various provinces to investigate the matter and report about the sources of such rumors. Uthman then sent his agents to the main provinces, Muhammad ibn Maslamah was sent to Kufa; Usama ibn Zayd was sent to Basra; Ammar ibn Yasir was sent to Egypt, while `Abd Allah ibn Umar was sent to Syria. The emissaries who had been sent to Kufa, Basra and Syria submitted their reports to Uthman, that <b>all</b> <b>was</b> <b>well</b> in Kufa, Basra and Syria. The people were satisfied with the administration, and they had no legitimate grievance against it. Some individuals in various locations had some personal grievances of minor character, with which the people at large were not concerned. Ammar ibn Yasir, the emissary to Egypt, however, did not return to Medina. The rebels had carried on with their propaganda in favor of the Caliphate of Ali. Ammar ibn Yasir had been affiliated with Ali; he left Uthman, and instead joined the opposition in Egypt. Abdullah ibn Saad, the governor of Egypt, reported about the activities of the opposition in Egypt. He wanted to take action against Muhammad ibn Abi Bakr (foster son of Ali), Muhammad bin Abi Hudhaifa (adopted son of Uthman) and Ammar ibn Yasir.|$|E

[...] Percy then went to another of Northumberland's properties, Essex House in London, and spoke with his nephew, Josceline. [...] Later that evening he met with Wintour, John Wright and Robert Keyes, and assured them that <b>all</b> <b>was</b> <b>well.</b> [...] He then travelled to his lodgings along Gray's Inn Road, where he left orders for his horses to be made ready for an early departure the next morning.|$|E
500|$|Magdalena left London on {{her maiden}} voyage on 9 March 1949, bound for Buenos Aires, Argentina. Her captain {{was on his}} final voyage before retirement. She called at Las Palmas in the Canary Islands on 15 March, and Rio de Janeiro, Brazil on 24 March. She reached Buenos Aires, where a cargo of [...] of meat was loaded, and called at Santos where a cargo of oranges was loaded. Carrying 237 crew and 347 passengers, she left Santos on 24 April, passing south of the Isle of Moela and the Isle of San Sebastian. Magdalenas course was more northerly than that intended, and {{adjustments}} were made twice on the orders of her captain. She passed Boi Point, San Sebastian at 19:56 and her course was altered to pass about [...] north of the Palmas Island Lighthouse, {{at the entrance to}} Rio de Janeiro Harbour. The captain retired to bed at about 22:45, leaving written orders to be called when the ship was at a bearing of 315° off the Garituba Lighthouse. As Magdalena was not due at Rio de Janeiro until the morning, her speed was reduced to [...] At 02:30 on 25 April, she was some [...] north of her intended position and another adjustment was made to her heading.

500|$|Elgar {{was devastated}} {{by the loss of}} his wife. With no public demand for new works, and {{deprived}} of Alice's constant support and inspiration, he allowed himself to be deflected from composition. His daughter later wrote that Elgar inherited from his father a reluctance to [...] "settle down to work on hand but could cheerfully spend hours over some perfectly unnecessary and entirely unremunerative undertaking", a trait that became stronger after Alice's death. For {{much of the rest of}} his life, Elgar indulged himself in his several hobbies. Throughout his life he was a keen amateur chemist, sometimes using a laboratory in his back garden. He even patented the [...] "Elgar Sulphuretted Hydrogen Apparatus" [...] in 1908. He enjoyed football, supporting Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C., for whom he composed an anthem, [...] "He Banged the Leather for Goal", and in his later years he frequently attended horseraces. His protégés, the conductor Malcolm Sargent and violinist Yehudi Menuhin, both recalled rehearsals with Elgar at which he swiftly satisfied himself that <b>all</b> <b>was</b> <b>well</b> and then went off to the races. In his younger days, Elgar had been an enthusiastic cyclist, buying Royal Sunbeam bicycles for himself and his wife in 1903 (he named his [...] "Mr. Phoebus"). As an elderly widower, he enjoyed being driven about the countryside by his chauffeur. In November and December 1923, he took a voyage to Brazil, journeying up the Amazon to Manaus, where he was impressed by its opera house, the Teatro Amazonas. Almost nothing is recorded about Elgar's activities or the events that he encountered during the trip, which gave the novelist James Hamilton-Paterson considerable latitude when writing Gerontius, a fictional account of the journey.|$|E

But Reuben persuaded them not to kill him but to cast him into a pit, hoping to restore him to Jacob later. The second reading ( [...] , aliyah) ends here.|$|E
2500|$|Philbin gained {{his first}} network TV {{exposure}} in 1967 as Joey Bishop's sidekick on The Joey Bishop Show on television (19671969). In a Johnny Carson-Ed McMahon vein, Bishop would playfully tease Philbin and Philbin {{would take the}} barbs in stride. [...] But his feelings were wounded when he learned from the network grapevine that ABC executives were dissatisfied with his work and his thick accent, so during the opening of one 1968 program, he launched an unplanned diatribe about [...] "not being wanted and letting down" [...] the program and abruptly quit on air. A few nights later, assured by Bishop that <b>all</b> <b>was</b> <b>well</b> and the barbs were not personal, Philbin returned. As revealed in his book, How I Got This Way, this was actually all a ruse planned by Bishop and Regis to steal the spotlight and attract some of Johnny Carson's viewers. When The Joey Bishop Show was canceled, Bishop returned the favor and walked off the show on the air unannounced, leaving Philbin to successfully carry the night on his own.|$|E
