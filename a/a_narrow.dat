5|$|G. tibicen eylandtensis, the Top End magpie, {{is found}} from the Kimberley in {{northern}} Western Australia, across the Northern Territory through Arnhem Land and Groote Eylandt {{and into the}} Gulf Country.

It has <b>a</b> <b>narrow</b> black terminal tailband, and <b>a</b> <b>narrow</b> black band; the male has a large white nape, the female pale grey. This form was initially described by H. L.
