40|$|The paper {{considers}} a two stage capacity and production planning model under uncertainty. The optimal second stage production policy falls into three cases: When capacity is slack the firm will produce {{with the cost}} minimizing production rate and <b>adjust</b> <b>the</b> <b>production</b> time to meet its output target. When the capacity constraint is binding, the firm will first <b>adjust</b> <b>the</b> <b>production</b> rate and then again produce with a constant production rate but employ overtime to meet the output target. The optimal capacity choice of the first stage {{is determined by the}} trade off between the sunk costs of slack labor and the expected opportunity costs of adjusting the production rate and employing overtime {{in the case of a}} binding capacity constraint. The key item determining the firm’s labor demand is the overtime premium. The amount of contracted labor strictly increases with the overtime premium and the expected overtime strictly decreases. Since then latter effect dominates the former for small overtime premia, the firm’s labor demand is first decreasing and then increasing with the overtime premium. A reduction of overtime premia can be Pareto improving because it does not only lead to substantial cost savings but also an increasing labor demand...|$|E

40|$|Abstract — In {{the coming}} decade a strong trend towards {{distributed}} electricity generation (micro-generation) is expected. Micro-generators are small appliances that generate electricity (and heat) at the kilowatt level, which allows them to be installed in households. By combining a group of micro-generators, a Virtual Power Plant can be formed. The electricity market/network requires a VPP control system to be fast, scalable and reliable. It {{should be able to}} <b>adjust</b> <b>the</b> <b>production</b> quickly, handle in the order of millions of micro-generators and it should ensure the required production is really produced by the fleet of micro-generators.

40|$|According to {{the current}} model of the basal ganglia organization, {{simultaneous}} activation of the striato-nigral direct pathway by glutamatergic and dopaminergic neurotransmission should lead to a synergistic facilitatory action on locomotor activity, while in contrast activation of the indirect pathway by these two neurotransmittions should lead to antagonistic effects on locomotor activity. Based on published data, as a break with the current thinking, we propose a reconceptualization of functional interactions between dopaminergic and glutamatergic neurotransmission. In this model, dopaminergic neurotransmission {{is seen as a}} motor pacemaker responsible for the basal and primary activation of striatal output neurons and glutamate as a driver providing a multiple combination of tonic, phasic, facilitatory and inhibitory influxes resulting from the processing of environmental, emotional and mnesic stimuli. Thus, in the model, glutamate-coded inputs would allow tuning the intrinsic motor-activating properties of dopamine to <b>adjust</b> <b>the</b> <b>production</b> of locomotor activity into goal-oriented movements...|$|E

Companies can profit from capacity based supply conditions and price volatility of the market by implementing the concept of energy flexibility.

The relative amount of monomeric VO(x) species in VSbO(x) /SiO(2) catalyst is higher than pure supported VO(x) catalyst.

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the {{development}} of an intelligent distributed and supervised control approach for highvolume production systems in which the flow of parts can be approximated by a continuous (fluid) model. The proposed approach is based on the decomposition of the production system into elementary modules {{in order to reduce the}} control design computational complexity. In this context, a two levels control structure is proposed. At the local level, a surplus-based principle is adopted to regulate the production flow for each module according to the distributed structure. The proposed control methodology decides how to <b>adjust</b> <b>the</b> <b>production</b> rate in order to avoid system overloading and eliminate machine starvation or blocking. In this context, the local control law is synthesized by using the Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy systems. At the high level, a supervisory controller is designed to improve the overall system performances. A supervisor provides an additive component for each local controller when the overall system performances deviate from their acceptable domains (degraded mode). This is done by combining both local and global information into a unified formalism by using aggregation operators and according to fuzzy interval representation of the desired objectives.
