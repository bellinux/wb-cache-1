25|$|The album's {{title was}} {{intended}} to have a double meaning: that the music business is <b>a</b> <b>hard</b> <b>one,</b> and that the band was serious about its music ("The Firm mean business"). However, perhaps due to the lukewarm-at-best critical and financial success which the band met, Page and Rodgers decided to disband The Firm within months of this album's release.|$|E
25|$|The soft spile in the shive allows gas to vent off. This {{can be seen}} by {{the bubbles}} foaming around the spile. The {{landlord}} will periodically check the bubbles by wiping the spile clean and then watching to see how fast the bubbles reform. There still has to be some life in the beer otherwise it will taste flat. When the beer is judged to be ready, the landlord will replace the soft spile with <b>a</b> <b>hard</b> <b>one</b> (which doesn't allow air in or gas out) and let the beer settle for 24 hours. They will also knock a tap into the end of the cask. This might simply be a tap if the cask is stored behind the bar. The beer will then be served simply under gravity pressure: turn on the tap, and the beer comes out. But if the cask is in the cellar, the beer needs to travel via tubes, or beer lines, and be pumped up to the bar area, normally using a handpump also known as a 'beer engine'.|$|E
25|$|Central to {{the myth}} {{and the reality}} of the West is the American cowboy. His real life was <b>a</b> <b>hard</b> <b>one</b> and {{revolved}} around two annual roundups, spring and fall, the subsequent drives to market, and the time off in the cattle towns spending his hard earned money on food, clothing, gambling, and prostitution. During winter, many cowboys hired themselves out to ranches near the cattle towns, where they repaired and maintained equipment and buildings. For young cowboys and buckaroos, working cattle was not just a job but also a lifestyle, one that was lived in the freedom of the outdoors and, most of the time, on horseback. On a long drive, there was usually one cowboy for each 250 head of cattle. Alcohol was everywhere in the West (outside Mormondom), but on the trail the cowboys were forbidden to drink it. Often, hired cowboys were trained and knowledgeable in their trade such as herding, ranching and protecting cattle. To protect their herd from wild animals, hostile Indians and rustlers, cowboys carried with them their iconic weaponry such as the Bowie knife, lasso, bullwhip, pistols, rifles and shotguns.|$|E

25|$|To {{deal with}} the Bulgarian threat for good, the Byzantines took {{measures}} to end the conflict with the Abbasid Caliphate {{in the east and}} attempted to create a wide anti-Bulgarian coalition. Two envoys were sent to Baghdad, where they secured peace with caliph al-Muqtadir in June 917. The strategos of Dyrrhachium, Leo Rhabdouchos, was instructed to negotiate with the Serbian prince Petar Gojniković, who was a Bulgarian vassal but was willing to renounce Bulgarian suzerainty. However, the court in Preslav was warned about the negotiations by prince Michael of Zahumlje, a loyal ally of Bulgaria, and SimeonI was able to prevent an immediate Serb attack. The Byzantine attempts to approach the Magyars were also successfully countered by the Bulgarian diplomacy. The general John Bogas was sent with rich gifts to the Pechenegs, who inhabited the steppes to the north-east of Bulgaria. The Bulgarians had already established strong connections with the Pechenegs, including through marriages, and Bogas' mission proved to be <b>a</b> <b>hard</b> <b>one.</b> He did manage to convince some tribes to send aid, but eventually the Byzantine navy refused to transport them to the south of the Danube river, probably {{as a result of the}} jealousy that existed between Bogas and the ambitious admiral Romanos Lekapenos.|$|E

500|$|The decade from 1910 was <b>a</b> <b>hard</b> <b>one</b> for Gaudí. During this decade, the {{architect}} experienced {{the deaths of}} his niece Rosa in 1912 and his main collaborator Francesc Berenguer in 1914; a severe economic crisis which paralysed work on the Sagrada Família in 1915; the 1916 death of his friend Josep Torras i Bages, bishop of Vic; the 1917 disruption of work at the Colonia Güell; and the 1918 death of his friend and patron Eusebi Güell. Perhaps because of these tragedies he devoted himself entirely to the Sagrada Família from 1915, taking refuge in his work. Gaudí confessed to his collaborators: ...|$|E

500|$|The {{character}} of Phoebe Green was {{considered as a}} recurring role, but this episode ended up being her only appearance. Chris Carter explained the character's origins, saying [...] "I thought {{it was interesting to}} show a little bit of Mulder's history by bringing an old girlfriend back. I've always wanted to do a Scotland Yard detective who was a woman. I also thought it was an interesting chance to use Amanda Pays and make a villainess of her". Executive producer Robert Goodwin felt that the episode [...] "was <b>a</b> <b>hard</b> <b>one.</b> Any kind of a fire stunt is a major undertaking, because it involves so many overlapping things. It was a major feat, a real logical and creative feat, because you wanted it to look good".|$|E
500|$|Wank Week was criticised in {{the prestigious}} James MacTaggart Memorial Lecture at the 2006 Edinburgh International Television Festival on 25 August, {{only a month}} after Channel 4's initial announcement. Charles Allen, the {{outgoing}} Chief Executive of Channel 4's commercial rival ITV, attacked Channel 4 for deterioration of output and adopting a [...] "begging" [...] approach to finances {{in the run-up to}} terrestrial digital switchover (requesting subsidies for public service output while pursuing a path of commercialism). Wank Week's mention came as part of a critique of programming that Channel 4 was counting towards its [...] "educational" [...] content. Allen joked that he was expecting Wank Week to be included, [...] "but that could be <b>a</b> <b>hard</b> <b>one</b> to pull off even for Channel 4." [...] The pun was subsequently repeated in the press.|$|E

In 2004 Drummond admitted to the BBC that he now regretted burning the money. [...] "It's <b>a</b> <b>hard</b> <b>one</b> to explain to your kids and it doesn't get any easier.

2500|$|The studio felt Kurt Russell was an up-and-coming star. Russell was {{initially}} not interested {{because he felt}} there were [...] "a number of different ways to approach Jack, but I didn't know {{if there was a}} way that would be interesting enough for this movie". After talking to Carpenter and reading the script a couple [...] of more times, he gained insight into the character and liked the notion of playing [...] "a hero who has so many faults. Jack is and isn't the hero. He falls on his ass as much as he comes through. This guy is a real blowhard. He's a lot of hot air, very self-assured, a screw-up". Furthermore, the actor felt that [...] "at heart he thinks he's Indiana Jones but the circumstances are always too much for him". Russell felt that the film would be <b>a</b> <b>hard</b> <b>one</b> to market. [...] "This is a difficult picture to sell because it's hard to explain. It's a mixture of the real history of Chinatown in San Francisco blended with Chinese legend and lore. It's bizarre stuff. There are only a handful of non-Asian actors in the cast".|$|E
2500|$|In 1994, {{following}} Hiroi's {{decision to}} put aside [...] "Sakura", Hiroi was contacted by Shoichiro Irimajiri — then vice president of Sega — {{about the possibility of}} developing a game with a popular mascot character for Sega's in-development Sega Saturn home console. Irimajiri wanted a unique video game property for the system, and had heard positive feedback about Hiroi's work. Hiroi was initially reluctant, but eventually accepted Irimajiri's offer, inviting him and other potential contributors to spend a fortnight's holiday in Saipan. Hiroi later said that the decision to work on a game for the Saturn was <b>a</b> <b>hard</b> <b>one,</b> as he had previously worked on games for rival home console systems. It was Sega's favorable response to his pitch that persuaded him to develop Sakura Wars on the Saturn. Hiroi pitched his old concept for [...] "Sakura" [...] to Irimajiri during their stay on Saipan, and while Hiroi harbored doubts as to whether such an ambitious and unusual project would be accepted, Irimajiri was convinced. Upon their return to Japan, Sega and Red Company began development on Hiroi's project. The project was then given the title Sakura Wars: as there were problems trademarking the kanji version of [...] "Sakura" [...] as it was also the name for cherry blossom, the word was instead written in katakana.|$|E
2500|$|After Trudeau {{announced}} his retirement in early 1984 as Liberal Party leader and Prime Minister, Chrétien sought {{the leadership of the}} Liberal Party of Canada. The experience was <b>a</b> <b>hard</b> <b>one</b> for Chrétien, as many of his longtime Cabinet allies supported the bid of John Turner who was viewed as the more electable candidate, much to Chrétien's intense disappointment. During the leadership race in the spring of 1984, Chrétien ran as the defender of the Trudeau era and promised to continue all of Trudeau's policies, unlike Turner who promised a break with Trudeau. During the leadership race, Chrétien presented himself as a folksy leftish populist who mocked Turner as a right-wing Bay Street snob out of touch with ordinary people. Chrétien argued contra Turner that the national deficit was not a problem, saying in a speech that [...] "We have to use the deficit to keep the dignity of our people". Though Chrétien ran the arguably better campaign, attracting larger and more enthusiastic crowds than anything that Turner ever managed, {{the fact that most of}} the Liberal Party establishment had rallied to Turner when he {{announced his}} candidacy in March 1984 as the candidate perceived as the most electable proved to be an insurmountable handicap for Chrétien. Two leading power-brokers within the Liberal Party, Marc Lalonde and Senator Keith Davey aka [...] "the Rainmaker" [...] backed Turner in 1984 as they considered Chrétien to be too [...] "downmarket" [...] and viewed Turner, the glamorous [...] "golden boy" [...] jock-scholar untainted by involvement with Trudeau in his unpopular last years as the best one to win the election. Chrétien was thought to be a dark horse until the end, but lost on the second ballot to Turner at the leadership convention that June. Iona Campagnolo would ominously introduce Chrétien as, [...] "Second on the ballot, but first in our hearts." [...] Chrétien believed that he would win the 1984 leadership race right up to the moment that Turner won, and took his defeat very badly when it came. When Chrétien did finally lose to Turner, he saw himself as the victim of a monstrous injustice-believing that Turner had only won through backroom machinations to cheat him out of what he saw as being rightfully his-and proved to be incapable of forgiving Turner for defeating him.|$|E
