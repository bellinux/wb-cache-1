500|$|Screenwriter Michael Arndt {{initially}} {{worked for}} {{a year on the}} film's script, calling it [...] "both a brilliantly creative idea but also incredibly challenging," [...] but left the project in early 2011, adding that [...] "knowing the Pixar process, there may not be a single word [...] that remains in the final script! They've had writers work on it since then." [...] Josh Cooley and Meg LeFauve were credited as co-writers of the screenplay following their contributions during the rewrite. Like Docter, Cooley and LeFauve included experiences with raising their own children into the screenplay. Cooley said [...] "... we treated the emotions like parents for Riley and because <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> writing room are parents ourselves, we just reflected on our own experiences as parents to create the characters." [...] Despite his departure, Arndt received an 'Additional Story Material' credit.|$|E

The fact of his turning up in Timor or anywhere else was no more wonderful than the settling of a sparrow on one's window-sill at any given moment.

"I met him accidentally in the street," [...] Philip answered, with an apologetic shrug, by {{no means}} well pleased at being thus held {{responsible}} for all the stranger's moral and social vagaries. [...] "It's the merest chance acquaintance. I know nothing of his antecedents. I--er--I lent him a bag, and he's fastened himself upon me ever since like a leech, and come constantly to my sister's.

He may dwell in a cave and eat water-cresses, he may live {{on top of a}} tall pillar, or he may make his {{habitation}} in a barrel! If a hermit should so choose, he might furnish a cave with Eastern rugs and bric-à-brac. If he liked that sort of thing, he would be himself. Yes, I would have <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>us,</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> truest sense of the word, hermits, each a hermit; but we need not dwell apart.

60|$|Well, {{all these}} motives for some {{definite}} {{course of action}} on our part towards foreign countries rest upon very serious facts; too serious, perhaps you will think, to be interfered with; for we are <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> habit of leaving great things alone, as if Providence would mind them, and attending ourselves only to little things which we know, practically, Providence doesn't mind unless we do. We are ready enough to give care to the growing of pines and lettuces, knowing that they don't grow Providentially sweet or large unless we look after them; but we don't give any care to the good of Italy or Germany, because we {{think that they will}} grow Providentially happy without any of our meddling.|$|E
6000|$|I must not, if I {{can help}} it, let the reader suppose {{that she was}} {{softening}} her heart to John Eames because John Eames was spoken well of in the world. But with <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>us,</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> opinion which we form of those around us, we take unconsciously the opinion of others. A woman is handsome because the world says so. Music is charming to us because it charms others. We drink our wines with other men's palates, and look at our pictures with other men's eyes. When Lily heard John Eames praised by all around her, {{it could not be}} but that she should praise him too,--not out loud, as others did, but in the silence of her heart. And then his constancy to her had been so perfect! If that other one had never come! If it could be that she might begin again, and that she might be spared that episode in her life which had brought him and her together! ...|$|E

[...] "What earthly need {{is there}} {{of a grand}} regale of oysters, chicken salad, ice-creams, coffee, and champagne, between eleven and twelve o'clock at night, when no {{one of us would}} ever think of wanting or taking any such {{articles}} upon our stomachs in our own homes? If we were <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> habit of having a regular repast at that hour, it might be well enough to enjoy one with our neighbor; but the party fare is generally just so much in addition to the honest three meals which we have eaten during the day. Now, to spend from fifty to one, two, or three hundred dollars in giving all our friends an indigestion from a midnight meal seems to me a very poor investment. Yet if we once begin to give the party, we must have everything that is given at the other parties, or wherefore do we live? And caterers and waiters rack their brains to devise new forms of expense and extravagance; and when the bill comes in, one is sure to feel that one is paying {{a great deal of money}} for a great deal of nonsense. It is in fact worse than nonsense, because our dear friends are, in half the cases, not only no better, but a great deal worse, for what they have eaten." ...|$|E

60|$|Had not {{the real}} superiority of the English over the French on the ocean, now come in play, this combat {{would have been a}} drawn battle, though {{accompanied}} by the usual characteristics of such struggles, {{at the close of the}} last and the beginning of the present century; or the latter considering an escape ti sort of victory. But both parties were reduced to the necessity of repairing damages, and this was the work to prove true nautical skill. Any man may load and fire a gun, but it needs a trained seaman to meet the professional emergencies of warfare. A clodhopper might knock a mast out of a vessel, but a sailor must replace it. From the beginning of this affair, <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Dawn had been struck with the order, regularity and despatch with which the Black Prince and Speedy had made and shortened sail, and the quickness and resource with which they had done all that seamanship required in securing wounded spars and torn sails; while, there had been no end to Marble's sneers and comments on the bungling confusion of the French. This difference now became doubly apparent, when there was no smoke nor any cannonading to divert the attention of the respective crews. In half an hour the Black Prince was clear of the wreck, and she had bent several new sails, while the difficulties on board her antagonist appeared just then to be at their height. This same difference existed between the two other vessels, though, on the whole, le Cerf got out of her distress sooner and more skilfully than her consort. As to the Speedy, I must do my old acquaintance, Lord Harry Dermond, the justice to say, that he both fought his ship, and repaired his damages, in a highly seaman-like manner. I'll answer for it, the Hon. Lieut. Powlett had not much to do with either. He had much better been in his mother's drawing-room, that day, and permitted a more fitting man to fill his place. Sennit was then on his way to Barbadoes, however, nor do I believe your master of a press-gang ever does much before an enemy.|$|E
