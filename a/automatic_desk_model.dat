40|$|PURPOSE: To {{describe}} a technique for en bloc harvesting of the corpus cavernosum, cavernous artery and urethra from transplant organ donors and contraction-relaxation experiments with corpus cavernosum smooth muscle. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The corpus cavernosum was dissected {{to the point}} of attachment with the crus penis. A 3 cm segment (corpus cavernosum and urethra) was isolated and placed in ice-cold sterile transportation buffer. Under magnification, the cavernous artery was dissected. Thus, 2 cm fragments of cavernous artery and corpus cavernosum were obtained. Strips measuring 3 x 3 x 8 mm 3 were then mounted vertically in an isolated organ bath device. Contractions were measured isometrically with a Narco-Biosystems force displacement transducer (model F- 60, Narco-Biosystems, Houston, TX, USA) and recorded on a 4 -channel Narco-Biosystems <b>desk</b> <b>model</b> polygraph. RESULTS: Phenylephrine (1 µM) was used to induce tonic contractions in the corpus cavernosum (3 - 5 g tension) and cavernous artery (0. 5 - 1 g tension) until reaching a plateau. After precontraction, smooth muscle relaxants were used to produce relaxation-response curves (10 - 12 M to 10 - 4 M). Sodium nitroprusside was used as a relaxation control. CONCLUSION: The harvesting technique and the smooth muscle contraction-relaxation model described in this study were shown to be useful instruments in the search for new drugs for the treatment of human erectile dysfunction...|$|R

Our algorithm generates plausible results from few examples, incorporating object composition and arrangement information from a database of 3 D scenes to increase the variety of its results. We present a method for synthesizing 3 D object arrangements from examples. Given a few user-provided examples, our system can synthesize a diverse set of plausible new scenes by learning from a larger scene database. We rely on three novel contributions. First, we introduce a probabilistic model for scenes based on Bayesian networks and Gaussian mixtures that can be trained from {{a small number of}} input examples. Second, we develop a clustering algorithm that groups objects occurring in a database of scenes according to their local scene neighborhoods. These contextual categories allow the synthesis process to treat a wider variety of objects as interchangeable. Third, we train our probabilistic model on a mix of user-provided examples and relevant scenes retrieved from the database. This mixed model learning process can be controlled to introduce additional variety into the synthesized scenes. We evaluate our algorithm through qualitative results and a perceptual study in which participants judged synthesized scenes to be highly plausible, as compared to hand-created scenes...|$|R

This can be a struggle given the need to continue some traditional aspects of librarianship, while trying to incorporate innovative information literacy practices, dynamic collection development, and cross-campus collaboration [...] Non-library faculty and campus administration often have an “ideal library” in mind that doesn’t necessarily fit with the changing professional identity of some academic librarians. Library faculty often feel a sense of double-consciousness as they are asked to support other faculty, but also engage in their own teaching and scholarship. Additionally, as budgets shrink, {{it can be difficult to}} remain optimistic about the viability of the library. However, uncertain budgets, and a rapidly evolving environment has given one library a sense of opportunity and a desire to proactively change their identity on campus. This panel focuses on how library faculty at one public liberal arts institution are working toward reframing themselves, their work, and their library. They will discuss the challenges and benefits of reframing information literacy sessions, and creating and teaching in an Information Studies minor. They will highlight the changes in workload as they looked to new ways of working with campus faculty on information literacy, collection development, and liaison work, and became involved in campus initiatives beyond the library. They will address the challenges and opportunities that arise from using students to staff the library’s information desk and teach database demonstrations in place of librarians.

40|$|The {{phenomenon}} of HIV discordance {{has been in}} existence {{for a long time}} along with HIV. However, very limited attention has been given to HIV discordance. This phenomenological study aimed at gaining a deeper understanding on the lived experiences of sero-discordant couples in Botswana. Reports show that discordance in Botswana is around 17 %. The main objectives of this study were to identify HIV discordant couples living in Botswana and explore their knowledge and understanding of the situation, explore the psychological, social and sexual experiences of the HIV discordant couples and determine its impact in their lives, and examine the meaning they attach to such experiences and challenges they face as well as their coping strategies. A qualitative phenomenological approach using face to face in-depth interviews was used to explore and describe meanings and experience as lived by the HIV discordant couples. The study sample consisted of forty-six (N= 46) (twenty-nine (n= 29) females and seventeen (n= 17) males) participants selected using purposive sampling from three cities in Botswana. The Inclusion criteria were that participants should be aged 21 years and above; with no known diagnosis of mental illness; having been in a discordant relationship for at least six months at the time of data collection; living in Botswana and willing to participate in the study. The findings were that there are three forms of discordance, which are: discordant unaware which are couples who went into the relation unaware of their HIV status. Discordant aware; those who got into the relationship already knowing each other’s HIV status and discordantly discordant which are those with differing HIV status and differing motives of going into the relationship. These are the couples that conceal their status from one another. The results revealed intense emotional/psychological, sexual and social stresses as experienced by couples.

40|$|Climate {{change and}} sea level rise are {{expected}} to exacerbate existing coastal hazards such as erosion and inundation. As a result many coastal heritage sites around the world {{are expected to}} be put at potential risk of damage or destruction. The likely susceptibility of Australia’s Indigenous coastal heritage sites to these hazards is widely recognised but the sensitivity has not been quantified or analysed in detail. In order to assess the sensitivity of Indigenous coastal heritage sites, both coastal and estuarine indices of sensitivity and vulnerability were adapted to be used in a heritage context. The study focused on the coastal Illawarra region of southern NSW. <b>Desk</b> based regional <b>models</b> were produced within the ArcGIS program for both Coastal and Estuarine shorelines in the region with underlying landform sensitivity used as a proxy for heritage site sensitivity. The coastal shoreline was assessed using an adaption of a Coastal Sensitivity Index technique, using Slope, Geology, Shoreline Exposure, Geomorphology, Site Distance to Shoreline, Sea Level Rise, Wave Height and Tidal Range to assess heritage site sensitivity to sea level rise. Indigenous heritage sites on the shoreline around Lake Illawarra estuary were assessed using an adaption of modelling designed to investigate biophysical vulnerability to erosion and flooding hazards using estuarine geomorphic units. The relative effectiveness of the <b>desk</b> based <b>modelling</b> approach was also examined by ground-truthing of a number of sites analysed in the coastal site sensitivity index. The results of the coastal analysis highlighted several sites located near beaches in the region that were estimated to have ‘Very High’ sensitivity to sea level rise and the associated hazards. In the Lake Illawarra estuary heritage sites were estimated to generally have higher sensitivity when located on the coastal barrier. Results of both methods indicated that sites on resilient bedrock landforms were considerably less sensitive than sites on Quaternary sediment. However, ground-truthing at Bass Point suggested in some locations sites may be sensitive to coastal hazards despite being associated with resilient landforms. The study was able to identify Indigenous heritage sites within the coastal Illawarra region that were most sensitive to climatic and sea level rise driven hazards. The ground-truthing of sites identified areas for future research to improve the desk based approach, particularly in regards to including the sensitivity of individual site types to erosion and inundation hazards. <b>Desk</b> based regional <b>modelling</b> was shown to be a useful tool for planning and conservation management, particularly in directing resources to sites of the highest risk, and informing the direction of more in depth studies into the hazards faced by coastal Indigenous heritage sites...|$|R

Lola is interested in innovative library services and user experiences especially as they pertain to library spaces. UTSC Library introduced a self-service model for course reserves in September 2014. We presented “Changing Time, Changing Needs: Opening Course Reserves” at the Access Services Conference in 2014. We discussed our project plan, implementation, and outcomes to date. At the time of the presentation, the service was less than 2 months old – much of our data was new and audience members had many questions. One year after implementing our new course reserves service, the service model in the library’s User Services unit has changed dramatically. Creating self-service course reserves freed up staff time and space. This gave us the opportunity to consider new services and ways in which we could improve user experience. We will present a review of the first year of our course reserves self-service model, including outcomes, user feedback, and lessons learned to date.
