5|$|The Mitsubishi Electric {{propulsion}} system was retained, having performed better than expected. The wheelchair space was made {{available on the}} end of two mid-train cars, nearest to the lifts in above-ground stations. LED displays that blink to warn passengers of closing doors were introduced in the upper middle section of the door. Additional loudspeakers and advertisement panels were also introduced. Hand grips were moved to the support bars of the seats on the ceiling and grabpoles were located near the doors and at both ends of each carriage. The <b>air-conditioning</b> system was modified to match the system used in the C751B cars, with <b>air-conditioning</b> vents and in-flow fans installed.|$|E
5|$|At {{one time}} the largest Orthodox {{congregation}} in the Southern United States, its membership was over 500 families in the 1960s, but fell to under 200 by 2005. That year its Canal Boulevard building was severely flooded by the 2005 New Orleans levee failure disaster during Hurricane Katrina. Despite attempts to save them, all seven of its Torah scrolls were destroyed, as were over 3,000 prayer books. The building suffered further flooding damage caused by the theft of copper <b>air-conditioning</b> tubing in 2007.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} October 1943, Howe and King George V had {{returned}} to Britain. At the end of year, Howe underwent a long overhaul at Devonport, where a number of alterations were made. Her anti-aircraft armament was increased, changes were made to her radar, and her watertight integrity in the stern was improved. Modifications were accomplished in the officers and crew quarters for operations in tropical climates; these included changes in insulation, and the extensive use of <b>air-conditioning</b> equipment.|$|E
5|$|In 2006 it {{was unclear}} if Beth Israel, which had already been in {{difficult}} financial shape, would be allowed, or have the means, to re-build its synagogue. The building suffered further flood damage in July 2007 when thieves stole the copper tubing for the main <b>air-conditioning</b> system. They broke the water main, and water from the second floor flooded the building for three days, {{to a depth of}} three to four feet, before it was discovered. The property was put up for sale.|$|E
5|$|In the 1990s {{samples of}} extremophile molds {{were taken from}} Mir. Ninety species of {{micro-organisms}} were found in 1990, {{four years after the}} station's launch. By the time of its decommission in 2001, the number of known different micro-organisms had grown to 140. As space stations get older, the problems with contamination get worse. Moulds that develop aboard space stations can produce acids that degrade metal, glass and rubber. The moulds in Mir were found growing behind panels and inside <b>air-conditioning</b> equipment. The moulds also caused bad smell, which was often cited as visitors' strongest impressions.|$|E
5|$|Eventually the Maceos, with Quinn, {{opened the}} Hollywood Dinner Club, {{at the time}} the most elegant night club on the Gulf Coast. The club {{featured}} crystal chandeliers, a massive dance floor, and air conditioning (a new technology at the time; the Hollywood was the first club in the nation to use it). Because of Sam's smooth personality he became the face of the nightclub. Guy Lombardo performed for the club's opening, and Sam attracted a steady stream of celebrity performers thereafter. The club hosted one of the nation's first remote radio broadcasts, and featured Ben Bernie's orchestra (one of the nation's most famous performing groups), which was introduced by a young Walter Cronkite. The club, the first venue in the nation to offer high-class gaming, dining, and entertainment, and <b>air-conditioning</b> under one roof, was unique at the time.|$|E
5|$|Jordan's well {{developed}} industrial sector, which includes mining, manufacturing, construction, and power, accounted for approximately 26% of the GDP in 2004 (including manufacturing, 16.2%; construction, 4.6%; and mining, 3.1%). More than 21% of Jordan's labor force was employed in industry in 2002. In 2014, industry accounted for 6% of the GDP. The main industrial products are potash, phosphates, cement, clothes, and fertilisers. The most promising segment of this sector is construction. Petra Engineering Industries Company, {{which is considered}} {{to be one of the}} main pillars of Jordanian industry, has gained international recognition with its <b>air-conditioning</b> units reaching NASA. Jordan is now considered to be a leading pharmaceuticals manufacturer in the MENA region led by Jordanian pharmaceutical company Hikma.|$|E
5|$|Located at the {{junction}} of Sungei Road and Pitt Road, was the former site of the Singapore Ice Works that {{was built in the}} 1930s. The factory was the first ice-making plant in Singapore using large compressors manufactured mainly from Carrier and York corporations. It was popular as a pioneer establishment that brought refrigeration and <b>air-conditioning</b> to Singapore. In 1958, it was renamed as the New Singapore Ice Works. In later years, the factory was bought over by Cold Storage who ran it under their management. However, in 1984, the Housing Development Board (HDB) took over its site for redevelopment. The factory was soon demolished and the plant operations was re-located to Auric Pacific at Fishery Port Road. This facility has since closed down after being in use for over twenty years.|$|E
5|$|On 3 September 2004, Hyundai Rotem, Mitsui, RM Transit Technology and dU LexBuild {{received}} {{an order to}} refurbish all 396 carriages, costing S$142.7 million in total. The works included the refurbishment of interior fixtures, the addition of wheelchair spaces, the upgrading of onboard communications equipment, enhancement of the public announcement system, and general improvement of the cars' appearance. SMRT Corporation said the reasons for refurbishment were wear and damage of important components {{over the past two}} decades and water leaks from the <b>air-conditioning</b> system on some trains. The company chose this option instead of buying new rolling stock, which would have cost S$792 million. The first refurbished train began revenue service on 5 November 2006, and all remaining trainsets had been refurbished by the end of 2008.|$|E
5|$|Pfeiffer {{was born}} in Santa Ana, California, the second of four {{children}} of Richard Pfeiffer, an <b>air-conditioning</b> contractor, and Donna (née Taverna), a housewife. She has one elder brother, Rick (born 1955), and two younger sisters, Dedee Pfeiffer (born 1964), a television and film actress, and Lori Pfeiffer (born 1965). Her parents were both originally from North Dakota. Her paternal grandfather was of German ancestry and her paternal grandmother was of English, Welsh, French, Irish, and Dutch descent, while her maternal grandfather was of Swiss-German descent and her maternal grandmother of Swedish ancestry. The family moved to Midway City, where Pfeiffer spent her childhood.|$|E
5|$|Skyscraper {{development}} paused {{during the}} years of the Second World War. Once development began again in the 1950s and 1960s, the skyscraper entered a different phase of development, usually called the international or modern period. Some experimental designs in this style had been built in the U.S. using European architectural concepts in the early 1930s, most notably the Philadelphia Savings Fund Society and McGraw-Hill Buildings. Post-war, their modernist themes were used in a new generation of skyscrapers. These stood alone on individual plots in the fashion of the Rockefeller Centre's RCA building, rather than as part of a row of buildings, forming huge slabs and towers featuring huge glass façades, breaking with earlier skyscraper traditions. Inside, new technologies such as fluorescent lighting and widespread <b>air-conditioning</b> meant that many older architectural features such as light courts and operable windows were unnecessary.|$|E
5|$|The 1973–1974 {{oil embargo}} had lasting {{effects on the}} United States and other industrialized nations, which {{established}} the International Energy Agency in response, as well as national emergency stockpiles designed to withstand months of future supply disruptions. Oil conservation efforts included lower speed limits on highways, smaller and more energy-efficient cars and appliances, year-round daylight saving time, reduced usage of heating and <b>air-conditioning,</b> better insulation, increased support of mass transit, and greater emphasis on coal, natural gas, ethanol, nuclear and other alternative energy sources. These long-term efforts became effective enough that US oil consumption would rise only 11 percent during 1980–2014, while real GDP rose 150 percent. But in the 1970s, OPEC nations demonstrated convincingly that their oil {{could be used as}} both a political and economic weapon against other nations, {{at least in the short}} term.|$|E
5|$|The main {{intention}} of the tour was to transform Madonna's old hits musically and display her capacity for transformation and self-reflection. The tour was initially known as the Whore of Babylon World Tour, although Madonna later denied using this name. The idea was to portray Madonna as the Whore of Babylon, the figure of evil as mentioned in the Book of Revelation. However it was later changed to the Re-Invention World Tour, {{to make it a}} self-confident dig at all the critics and people who have expressed their views about Madonna re-inventing her image over the years. The official tour poster displayed Madonna in a vintage bolero gown and a large French Renaissance-like hair-bun. <b>Air-conditioning</b> was turned off during the tour on Madonna's request as she claimed it dried up her throat during singing.|$|E
5|$|The £3million {{refurbishment}} by Fry, {{the most}} extensive programme of work since the theatre had been saved from virtual collapse almost 30 years before, included an expanded foyer, improved lift and disabled access to the stalls and royal circle levels, complete refurbishment of the bars {{and the creation of}} The Jeremy Fry Bar, in the former cellars of The Garrick's Head pub, and redecoration of the auditorium. Technical improvements included the rebuilding of the Main House stage, and an extensive rewiring and lighting programme around the entire building, with new fire alarm systems, <b>air-conditioning</b> and lighting, all designed to improve the building's efficiency and reduce the carbon footprint by some 30%. The design was by architects of the Fielden Clegg Bradley Studios, and the construction firm Midas was contracted to complete the building work.|$|E
5|$|While {{the rolling}} stock and Mitsubishi Electric {{propulsion}} equipment were constructed in Japan, many parts were sourced from Europe. The trains were fitted with Stone Platt <b>air-conditioning,</b> Duwag bogies, Sig gangways, Scharfenberg couplers and Westinghouse brakes. Mitsubishi Electric's propulsion equipment was estimated to consume 50% less electricity than Hong Kong's existing MTR M-Train EMU. Its Automatic Train Control (ATC) signalling system was supplied by Westinghouse, capable of running at pre-programmed speeds and activated by the train driver. While theoretically possible to design for a fully driverless operation using this signalling technology, MRT Corporation (MRTC, now SMRT Corporation) decided against this option. The trainsets were assembled in Kobe, Japan, and then shipped to Singapore by Neptune Orient Lines. The first trainset was delivered to MRTC on 8 July 1986 at Bishan Depot, officiated by Yeo Ning Hong.|$|E
5|$|For {{passenger}} {{service the}} F40PH has another electrical alternator, the head-end generator. The HEP unit generates three-phase AC power at 480 V (500kW {{on the first}} order, 800kW on later units) for lighting, heating and <b>air-conditioning</b> the train. Originally, F40PHs powered the HEP alternator from the prime mover; from the head end to the train must be a constant frequency, and the prime mover had to turn at a constant 893 RPM while supplying head end power (even standing still, with the throttle in idle). Power to the traction motors was controlled by varying the field excitation of the main (traction) generator. On some later versions of the F40PH (and on many rebuilt F40s), a second small diesel engine {{at the rear of}} the locomotive powers the HEP alternator. In these engines, the prime-mover speed varies in the usual way; they can be identified by the diesel exhaust {{at the rear of the}} locomotive and by their quiet idle. Remaining F40s, with the constant-RPM prime movers, are noticeably louder.|$|E
5|$|The Quarrymen {{played a}} series of seven Saturday night concerts in The Casbah for 15 shillings each, {{starting}} on 29 August to October 1959, featuring Lennon, McCartney, Harrison and Brown, but without a drummer, and only one microphone connected to the club's small PA system. The opening night concert was attended by about 300 local teenagers, but as the cellar had no <b>air-conditioning,</b> and people were dancing, the temperature rose until it became hard to breathe. After {{the success of the}} first night, Mona gave The Quarrymen a residency, and paid the whole group £3 a night. Every Saturday thereafter, queues lengthened onto the street, which was financially good for Mona, as she charged one shilling admission on top of the annual membership fee. As there was no amplification, Lennon later persuaded Mona to hire a young amateur guitar player called Harry to play a short set before The Quarrymen, but this was only so they could use his 40-Watt amplifier.|$|E
25|$|The Boston cars' <b>air-conditioning</b> {{units were}} {{originally}} mounted under the car, and constantly sucked in dirt and debris {{from under the}} car. The MBTA later modified 76 LRVs with roof-mounted <b>air-conditioning</b> units to address this.|$|E
25|$|More {{powerful}} and immediate heating, ventilation and <b>air-conditioning.</b>|$|E
25|$|December 1959 to March 1960: Refitted by Harland and Wolff in Belfast. <b>Air-conditioning</b> added.|$|E
25|$|An {{upgraded}} intelligent <b>air-conditioning</b> {{system is}} also standard on all models, except the Sedan 250GT and 250GT A package and Coupe 370GT A package.|$|E
25|$|Engine-driven {{mechanical}} <b>air-conditioning</b> {{mounted in}} the left part of the hull to cool the tank {{without the use of}} electric current, which could reveal the position of the tank.|$|E
25|$|The Tucson {{cars are}} model variant 200, the main {{difference}} from model 100 being a more powerful <b>air-conditioning</b> system. The first streetcar for Sun Link arrived in Tucson on August 30, 2013.|$|E
25|$|President Raúl Leoni spent $10 {{million of}} public funds to pave a road to his house, to build guest houses near his home, and to add <b>air-conditioning</b> to the local airport.|$|E
25|$|In {{an effort}} to reduce noise from the road traffic nearby, Church of the Risen Christ became among the first Roman Catholic Church to install an <b>air-conditioning</b> system within its {{premises}} in 1974.|$|E
25|$|A {{variant of}} the Shatabdi Express, Swarna Shatabdi Express, is {{considered}} more luxurious by Indian Railway. Indian Railways later introduced a lower-priced version Jan Shatabdi Expresses, which are nearly all without <b>air-conditioning</b> and much more affordable.|$|E
25|$|B2-class trams entered service between 1988 and 1994. 130 trams {{were built}} by Comeng, and later ABB Transportation; {{all of which}} remain in service today. The B2-class was the first Melbourne tram fitted with <b>air-conditioning.</b>|$|E
25|$|Ice storage air {{conditioning}} Ice {{can be stored}} inter seasonally {{and can be used}} as a source of <b>air-conditioning</b> during periods of high demand. Present systems only need to store ice for a few hours but are well developed.|$|E
25|$|Thermodynamics {{principles}} {{are used by}} mechanical engineers {{in the fields of}} heat transfer, thermofluids, and energy conversion. Mechanical engineers use thermo-science to design engines and power plants, heating, ventilation, and <b>air-conditioning</b> (HVAC) systems, heat exchangers, heat sinks, radiators, refrigeration, insulation, and others.|$|E
25|$|There {{would be}} a weight saving of 30tonnes, and the trains would be 17% more {{energy-efficient}} with <b>air-conditioning</b> included, or 30% more energy-efficient without it. The intention is that these new trains would eventually operate on the Bakerloo, Central, Piccadilly and Waterloo & City lines.|$|E
25|$|Mechatronics is an {{engineering}} discipline {{which deals with}} the convergence of electrical and mechanical systems. Such combined systems are known as electromechanical systems and have widespread adoption. Examples include automated manufacturing systems, heating, ventilation and <b>air-conditioning</b> systems, and various subsystems of aircraft and automobiles.|$|E
25|$|Environmentally {{sustainable}} design concepts also include aspects {{related to the}} commercial and residential heating, ventilation and <b>air-conditioning</b> (HVAC) industry. Among several considerations, one of the topics attended to {{is the issue of}} indoor air quality throughout the design and construction stages of a building's life.|$|E
25|$|On rare occasions, {{bleed air}} used for <b>air-conditioning,</b> and {{pressurization}} can be contaminated by chemicals {{such as oil}} or hydraulic fluid. This {{is known as a}} fume event. While those chemicals can be irritating, such rare events have not been established to cause long term harm.|$|E
25|$|The {{air-cooled}} IBM Blue Gene supercomputer architecture trades {{processor speed}} for {{low power consumption}} so that {{a larger number of}} processors can be used at room temperature, by using normal <b>air-conditioning.</b> The second-generation Blue Gene/P system has processors with integrated node-to-node communication logic. It is energy-efficient, achieving 371 MFLOPS/W.|$|E
25|$|A {{stand-alone}} executable of {{compact size}} is required that must execute without recourse to the run-time components or libraries {{associated with a}} high-level language; {{this is perhaps the}} most common situation. For example, firmware for telephones, automobile fuel and ignition systems, <b>air-conditioning</b> control systems, security systems, and sensors.|$|E
25|$|In 1930, Thomas Edison {{was at the}} {{controls}} for the first departure of a regular-service electric multiple unit train from Hoboken Terminal to Montclair. One of the first installations of central <b>air-conditioning</b> in a public space was at the station, as was the first non-experimental use of mobile phones.|$|E
