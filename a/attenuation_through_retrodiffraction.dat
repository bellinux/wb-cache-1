Such suspensions contribute to <b>attenuation</b> <b>through</b> visco-inertial absorption and scattering and may therefore be partially responsible for the observed variability in high frequency sonar performance in littoral environments. Microbubbles which are prevalent in littoral waters also contribute to volume <b>attenuation</b> <b>through</b> radiation, viscous and thermal damping and cause dispersion. The attenuation due to a polydisperse suspension of particles with depth-dependent concentration has been included in a sonar model. The effects of a depth-dependent, polydisperse population of microbubbles on attenuation, sound speed and volume reverberation are also included. Marine suspensions are characterized by nonspherical particles, often plate-like clay particles. Measurements of absorption in dilute suspensions of nonspherical particles have shown disagreement with predictions of spherical particle models. These measurements have been reanalyzed using three techniques for particle sizing: laser diffraction, gravitational sedimentation, and centrifugal sedimentation, highlighting the difficulty of characterizing polydisperse suspensions of irregular particles.

Based on 5 -aminolevulinic-acid-induced protoporphyrin IX (PpIX) fluorescence, vital tumor tissue can be localized in vivo during the excision procedure {{to reduce the number of}} necessary samples for a reliable diagnosis. In this study, the practical suitability of two different PpIX excitation wavelengths (405  nm, 633  nm) was investigated on optical phantoms. Violet excitation at 405  nm provides a 50 -fold higher sensitivity for the bulk tumor; this factor increases up to 100 with decreasing fluorescent volume as shown by ray tracing simulations. Red excitation at 633  nm, however, is noticeably superior with regard to blood layers obscuring the fluorescence. Experimental results on the signal <b>attenuation</b> <b>through</b> blood layers of well-defined thicknesses could be confirmed by ray tracing simulations. Typical interstitial fiber probe measurements were mimicked on agarose-gel phantoms. Even in direct contact, blood layers of 20 - 40  µm between probe and tissue must be expected, obscuring 405 -nm-excited PpIX fluorescence almost completely, but reducing the 633 -nm-excited signal only by 25. 5 %. Thus, 633  nm seems to be the wavelength of choice for PpIX-assisted detection of high-grade gliomas in stereotactic biopsy.
