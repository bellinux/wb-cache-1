5|$|In {{addition}} to these duties, forensic anthropologists often assist {{in the investigation of}} war crimes and mass fatality investigations. Anthropologists have been tasked with helping to identify victims of the 9/11 terrorist attacks as well as plane crashes such as the Arrow Air Flight 1285 disaster and the USAir Flight 427 disaster where the flesh had been vaporized or so badly mangled that normal identification was impossible. Anthropologists have also helped identify victims of genocide in countries around the world, often long after the actual event. War crimes anthropologists have helped investigate include the Rwandan Genocide and the Srebrenica Genocide. Organizations such as the Forensic Anthropology Society of Europe, the British Association for Forensic <b>Anthropology,</b> <b>and</b> the American Society of Forensic Anthropologists continue to provide guidelines for the improvement of forensic <b>anthropology</b> <b>and</b> the development of standards within the discipline.|$|E

5|$|Despite {{recent changes}} {{in the field of}} <b>anthropology</b> <b>and</b> a shift in {{government}} objectives, the Pingpu and Gaoshan labels in use today maintain the form given by the Qing to reflect aborigines' acculturation to Han culture.

The Amis, Saisiat, Tao and Kavalan are all traditionally Eastern Plains cultures. The distinction between Pingpu and Gaoshan people continues to affect Taiwan's policies regarding indigenous peoples, and their ability to participate effectively in government.|$|E

5|$|The second chapter {{examines}} the community's {{conceptions of the}} otherworld, explaining how they approach it through acts of visualisation and altered states of consciousness and their understandings {{of it as a}} realm of spiritual energy connected to dreams and the imagination. Discussing the relationship between <b>anthropology</b> <b>and</b> magic, Greenwood argues that it is impossible for anthropologists to truly understand beliefs regarding magic and the otherworld if they only view it through a western rationalist lens, instead arguing for a phenomenological or relativist perspective that accepts alternative views of the world.|$|E

5|$|Durkheim had an {{important}} impact {{on the development of}} <b>Anthropology</b> <b>and</b> Sociology, influencing thinkers from his school of sociology, such as Marcel Mauss, but also later thinkers, such as Maurice Halbwachs, Talcott Parsons, Alfred Radcliffe-Brown, and Claude Levi-Strauss. More recently, Durkheim has influenced sociologists such as Steven Lukes, Robert Bellah, and Pierre Bourdieu. His description of collective consciousness also deeply influenced the Turkish nationalism of Ziya Gökalp, the founding father of Turkish sociology. Randall Collins has developed a theory of what he calls interaction ritual chains, which is a synthesis of Durkheim's work on religion with Erving Goffman's micro-sociology. Goffman himself was also deeply influenced by Durkheim in his development of the interaction order.|$|E
