30|$|Income Diversity Index. The income {{diversity}} index {{shows how}} diverse an area is {{in terms of}} average household income for the population of that area. It is derived from the U.S. Census Bureau and it is calculated using the Gini–Simpson index [31] for three distinct wage bands: low <b>income</b> (<b>annual</b> <b>incomes</b> less than $ 35, 000), middle band <b>income</b> (<b>annual</b> <b>incomes</b> between $ 35, 000 and $ 100, 000) and high <b>income</b> (<b>annual</b> <b>incomes</b> greater than $ 100, 000).|$|R

5|$|As is {{the case}} with many castles – {{especially}} of the 12th century – there is no record of how much it cost to build Buckton Castle. However, based on comparison to Peveril Castle in Derbyshire, where construction of the keep in 11751177 cost £184 according to the Pipe Rolls, it is estimated that the work at Buckton would have cost around £100. This was close to the median <b>annual</b> <b>income</b> for a baron in 1200.|$|E

High <b>income</b> households spent about $ 405 billion of the $ 2. 8 trillion total outlays of complete income reporter households. These high-income households, on average, spent more than other households (see table), and they allocated their expenditures differently (see chart). Households with <b>annual</b> <b>incomes</b> of more than $ 90, 000, allocated larger shares to food away from home; housing operations, supplies and furnishings; personal insurance and pensions; cash contributions; entertainment; and apparel and services.
