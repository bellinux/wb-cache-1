50|$|Tape {{formulation}} {{affects the}} retention of the magnetic signal, especially high frequencies, the frequency linearity of the tape, the S/N ratio, print-through, optimum AC bias level (which must be set by a technician <b>aligning</b> the <b>machine</b> to match the tape type used, or more crudely set with a switch to approximate the optimum setting.) Tape formulation varies between different tape types (ferric oxide Fe2O3, chromium dioxide CrO2, etc.) {{and also in the}} precise composition of a specific brand and batch of tape. (Studios therefore generally <b>align</b> their <b>machines</b> for one brand and model number of tape and use only that brand and model.) Backing material type and thickness affect the tensile strength and elasticity of the tape, which affect wow-and-flutter and tape stretch; stretched tape will have a pitch error, possibly fluctuating. Backing thickness also affects print-through, the phenomenon of adjacent layers of tape wound on a reel picking up weak copies of the magnetic signal from each other. Print-through on analog tape causes unintended pre- and post-echoes on playback, and is generally not fully reversible once it has occurred.|$|R

A 2 D calculation model was used during the design stage to study the aperture margins, both there and at other potential bottlenecks. Based on assumptions on orbit and optics errors, as well as mechanical tolerances, it gives the available aperture in units of the RMS beam size, which can be compared with what can be protected by the collimation system. During the LHC Run I in 2010 - 2013, several of the error tolerances have been found smaller than the design assumptions. Furthermore, the aperture has been measured with beam several times and the results are compatible with a very well <b>aligned</b> <b>machine,</b> with results close to the design values.

500|$|The Nightfly {{is one of}} the {{earliest}} examples of fully digital recording in popular music. Katz and Fagen had previously experimented with digital recording for Gaucho, which ended up entirely analog. Nichols conducted experiments and found that the digital recordings sounded better than those recorded to magnetic tape. The Nightfly was recorded using 3M's 32-track and four-track recorders. Nichols built a new drum machine, the Wendel II—a sequel to the original Wendel, which was employed for their work on Gaucho. The new model was upgraded from 8 bits to 16 bits, and [...] "plugged straight into the 3M digital machines, so there was no degradation" [...] in sound. Problems with the technology persisted in the beginning, particularly regarding the alignment of the 3M machines. Representatives from 3M had to be called to <b>align</b> the <b>machines,</b> but eventually Fagen and Nichols grew tired of this. Nichols and engineers Jerry Garsszva and Wayne Yurgelun took classes at 3M's Minnesota headquarters, and returned knowing how to <b>align</b> the <b>machines</b> themselves. [...] "I was ready to transfer to analog and give it up on several occasions, but my engineering staff kept talking me into it," [...] Fagen remembered. They practiced an early form of [...] "comping" [...] Fagen's vocals—which they called [...] "beat the computer"—wherein he would record multiple takes and the engineers would pick the best lines from each take.

40|$|Liquid and Gaseous Helium are {{supplied}} to the superconducting magnets of the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), presently being assembled at CERN, by a cryogenic distribution line (QRL). The cryogenic module of the twin-quadrupole Short Straight Section (SSS) is supplied with these cryogens through a jumper connection linking the service module of the QRL and the SSS. The internal {{as well as}} external features of the jumper construction allow for relative displacements between the QRL and SSS with sufficient flexibility to reduce the reaction forces responsible for elastic deformations when the SSS is moved for alignment. The SSS is composed of a cold mass and of a vacuum vessel equipped with fiducials posted on the external vacuum vessel reinforcement rings allowing the precise alignment of the machine when the cryostat is finally closed. A deformation of the structure linking the cold mass and the external vacuum vessel resulting from reaction forces induced by relative displacements of the SSS and the QRL, if unpredictable, would result in an unacceptable misalignment of the quadrupole magnetic axis. A unified FE model was generated at RRCAT to study the elastic behavior of the SSS under the conditions of alignment. This model was validated using a 40 meter long dedicated test setup at CERN. Correlations in the matrix form were generated so that all displacements of the cold mass {{can be related to}} the corresponding movements done for alignment.

40|$|This study {{presents}} {{a novel approach}} to the mechanics of chip formation based on a shear zone model with parallel boundaries that has been developed by applying the continuum mechanics {{to the analysis of}} the chip formation process. Such a model is formulated without imposing the assumptions commonly made in the single shear or parallel-sided shear zone models. A steady-state cutting force model has been derived and adapted to orthogonal cutting of a self-piloting drilling. In the formulated model, special attention has been devoted to the thermomechanical state which defines the effect of the temperature on the yield shear stress of the work piece material. The proposed steady state cutting force model has been extended to formulate a cutting force model to analyze the dynamic behavior of the machining process in orthogonal cutting. The cutting system was modeled using a single degree-of freedom dynamic system where the variations of the cutting forces are represented by their total differentials. Special attention in this study has been dedicated to experimental verification. The meaningful design, accuracy, precision, and the calibration of the experimental setups are considered in details and several new experimental methodologies are proposed and used. This study shows the fluctuation of the cutting forces is a result of chip segmentation and not the cause. It also shows the effect of materials and cutting conditions on the cutting signatures that has never been considered as a factor in the known studies on cutting dynamics. Special attention has been devoted to the chip morphology of the partially and fully deformed chips to verify the proposed model. A quick stop device has been designed to obtain samples of partially formed chip.

40|$|The current ongoing {{evolution}} towards mass customization, {{resulting in}} the production of small lots or prototypes and single unique items, requires a different strategy compared to classic high volume manufacturing. In order to deal with the increasing product range and decreasing time to market, the flexibility of current manufacturing process chain needs to increase. A conventional manufacturing process of a high quality component consists of an initial machining step, for example a milling and/or turning operation, starting from bulk material (block, cylinder). In a next step, the part is unclamped, transported to a heat treatment facility in order to attain the required material properties (hardness, residual surface stresses, microstructure,…). This step introduces inevitably deformations to the component, which is why a finishing operation is performed after the component is transported, re-clamped and re-aligned. In this PhD thesis 2 alterations to this conventional process flow are investigated. A first innovation investigated in this thesis, is combining the machining, heat treatment and if required a hard finishing operation in 1 single machine and setup. This omits the need for logistics {{back and forth to the}} hardening facility. Re-clamping and re-aligning of the component is no longer needed for the hard finishing operation, which reduces the total lead time and errors introduced during these labor intensive operations. This is realized by integrating a laser into a machining center, allowing to perform both the machining operations as the heat treatment in one setup. In this thesis, 2 different setups are developed and described. The first setup, uses a 500 W Nd:Yag laser as a heat source. A fixed spot optical design is made using basic optics calculus and is updated using ray tracing simulation. A mechanical design is made and realized. The integration of the laser as a tool is done into a 5 -axis milling machine. A spotsize of 1. 2 mm diameter or more (if out of focus) is moved across the surface of the component by moving the machine’s axis. The process of integrated laser hardening is investigated on C 45 steel by performing a Design of Experiment, using 3 different feed rates and 4 different spotsizes. High hardness values, above 750 HV and a hardening depth of about 0. 2 mm are achieved. Thanks to the high cooling rate during the heat cycle in laser hardening, the hardness exceeds hardness values achieved by conventional hardening techniques. A second design of experiment, investigating multiple laser tracks next to each other, in order to cover a larger area, is performed. From these experiments, it is concluded it is impossible, no matter what overlap/inter-track distance is used, to achieve a uniform hardness along the cross section of multiple scan tracks. This effect is identified as a tempering/softening effect, in which the second track tempers a part of the first track. Finally, a die and mold component, prone to rapid wear, made of a high alloyed steel, is laser hardened using the developed setup, proving the industrial relevance of this work. In order to achieve a uniform hardness across a larger area, a new setup is developed on a 11 -axis machining center. Instead of using a fixed spot hardening strategy as in the previous setup, a very small spot (0. 8 mm in diameter) is scanned across the surface at high speed using a rotating mirror, while moving slowly in the feed direction by moving the machine’s axis. The optical and mechanical design and realization of this setup are described. A control system, controlling laser source (500 W diode laser), mirror actuator and auxiliary equipment, while monitoring the actual temperature and machine position, is developed. A software tool which allows to program the hardening operation of complex shaped components, is developed and the strategy is illustrated on an example. The process of integrated scanning laser hardening is investigated on a low alloyed steel (C 45) and a highly alloyed steel (40 CrMnMo 7). The samples showed no tempering effects, resulting in a uniform hardness across the scan width. The robustness of the process and control is verified by testing contaminated samples (oil, steel/aluminum chips, emulsion) and samples with varying scanning width. Two cases are described as an example of industrial applications for this technology. The second innovation tackles the machining of near net shapes, which is significantly different to machining from bulk material. In this thesis, 2 types of near net shape machining are investigated: the machining of gears from forgings and the finishing of large assemblies built by additive manufacturing. The machining of gears using the conventional processes requires dedicated, design specific tools. The lead time and cost of these tools are high, which is an issue for prototypes and small batch production. Three different alternative production technologies are investigated. A multi-axis milling strategy using standard end mills is developed and an automotive gearbox gear is made to high quality grinding specifications in less than 24 hours, while the lead time for conventional production is in the order of 13 weeks. This machining process is ideal to combine with the integrated laser hardening. Since the distortions introduced by laser hardening are limited, a hard finishing operation might be omitted, resulting in a hardened high accuracy gear manufactured in hours/days instead of weeks. The finishing of large assemblies, built using additive manufactured components, to a very high accuracy is quite different to machining a small component from bulk to the same accuracy. By investigating and reducing errors introduced by CAD/CAM, machining, in-machine mounting (clamping and <b>aligning)</b> and <b>machine</b> condition (position accuracy, flatness table and thermal stability), the achieved tolerance is reduced significantly. This is verified on a demonstrator part. nrpages: 254 status: publishe...|$|R
