40|$|Abstract. Software systems {{built by}} {{composing}} existing services {{are more and}} more capturing the interest of researchers and practitioners. The envisaged long term scenario is that services, offered by some competing providers, are chosen by some consumers and used for their own purpose, possibly, in conjunction with other services. In the case the consumer is not anymore satisfied by the performance of some service, he can try to replace it with some other service. This implies the creation of a global market of services and poses new requirements concerning validation of exploited services, security of transactions engaged with services, trustworthiness, creation and negotiation of Service Level Agreements with these services. In this paper we focus on the last aspect and present our approach for negotiation of Service Level <b>Agreements.</b> Our <b>architecture</b> supports the actuation of various negotiation processes and offers a search-based algorithm to assist the negotiating parts in the achievement of an agreement...|$|R

Currently, formal roaming agreements are manually set up, which is a costly and time-consuming process. It is highly desirable for network cooperation to be established on the fly. However, establishing spontaneous roaming agreement is a very challenging research issue. This paper presents a novel AAA (Authentication, Authorization and Accounting) architecture to support policy-based negotiation for establishing spontaneous roaming <b>agreements.</b> The new <b>architecture</b> integrates policy-based negotiation into the normal user association and authentication process for spontaneous and dynamic roaming agreements and interworking. This integration minimizes changes to existing AAA architecture for enabling the new paradigm of automated provider interworking and cooperation. ...|$|R

This is surprising as the closely related topic of grid computing, which deals with the federation of resources from multiple domains {{in order to support}} large jobs, and cloud computing, which promises seemingly infinite amounts of compute and storage, both offer quality of service (QoS), albeit in different ways. Long-term service level agreements (SLAs), which require the establishment of SLAs long in advance of their actual usage, seem a promising way for the offering of QoS guarantees in an HPC environment {{in a way that is}} not disruptive to the business models employed today. This work uses the long-term SLA approach as a basis for the provisioning of service levels for HPC resources and presents an SLA management framework to support this. Flexibility is provided by providing SLAs with different service levels, support for which is integrated into job submission and scheduling. The SLA management framework can, on a high level, be used in a generic fashion and an implementation is presented that is evaluated against a motivating scenario.

40|$|This paper {{critically}} {{examines the}} clean development mechanism (CDM) established under Article 12 of the Kyoto Protocol {{in terms of}} its effectiveness as a vehicle for technology transfer to developing countries, a specific commitment under the UNFCCC. Fundamentally, the paper poses the question of whether technology transfer as part of the CDM is a myth or a reality in the broader context of sustainable development. Technology transfer between countries of the North and South is explored in a historical context and the emergence of technology transfer obligations is traced in multilateral environmental <b>agreements.</b> The <b>architecture</b> of the UNFCCC and the Kyoto Protocol are examined in relation to technology transfer obligations. Empirical studies are reviewed to gain an understanding of how CDM operates in practice, with a closer examination of a small number of recent CDM projects. There is an update on the Technology Mechanism being established under the Copenhagen Accord. The paper concludes with a summary of the benefits of CDM to date and its current limitations in achieving the scaling-up of affordable environmentally sound technology transfer envisaged in the Bali Action Plan. The conclusion is that technology transfer must be a much more explicit objective of CDM with better targeting of projects in order to achieve locally sustainable equitable outcomes. Furthermore, the link between CDM and technology transfer needs to be much more explicitly made in order that, in the long run, such interventions will lead to viable low emission development pathways in developing countries...|$|R
40|$|There {{is a wide}} <b>agreement</b> that {{software}} <b>architecture</b> is {{a useful}} notion. Unfortunately {{there is no agreement}} on what does this term means exactly. Despite of that, the recovery of the architecture is certainly necessary since(1) source code does not provide the good level of abstraction and (2) software architecture is almost never described explicitly in large software companies. In this paper we claim that: (A) evolving software companies using evolving technologies continuously need to discover what is architecture about, and this in order to control the development of their software products; (B) the notion of software architecture is actually a moving target. Supporting the discovery/recovery of software architecture therefore implies the use of very flexible tools. These claims are based on our experience on discovering/recovering the software architecture of CATIA, a multi million LOC software product line developed over the last decades by Dassault Système, one of the major software editors in Europe. 1...|$|R

Cliff Saran in [23] highlighted some of the difficulties involved in usage of self-managing systems such as common software standards across the industry and proprietary system management interfaces.

Numerous surveys indicate that the top concerns for moving to the cloud are security, performance and availability. In other words, enterprises are looking for assurances that they are not adding risk to the business by leveraging the cloud. For many, moving to the cloud is still a leap of faith.

Aim:  to ground {{the architecture of the}} system of strategic management of an industrial enterprise development. The methodology of the research is the analysis of the logic of the development management system structure. The  methods  of analysis, synthesis, abstraction, systematic approach, logical generalization have been used in the research. Main characteristics of the notion ‘architecture’ have been revealed, its use during the research of the management system has been grounded, the comparison of synonymous to ‘architecture’ notions (architectonics, tectonics, construction, composition) has been carried out. The main aim of the system’s architecture building has been defined as to show system-buil-ding connections between its constituent parts. These connections {{must be taken into account}} while developing and realizing managerial decisions on enterprises development. Conclusions:  the absence of scientifically grounded approaches to the building of the structure of strategic development management of an industrial enterprise has been identified. The three-level <b>architecture</b> (<b>agreement,</b> fulfillment, result) of the management system has been suggested. The architecture levels combine the main managed elements of the economic activity of an enterprise and allow one to efficiently regulate the connections between the elements. Areas of the results implementation:  it is recommended to senior managers at industrial enterprises to fulfill the development aims on the basis of innovative products and technologies implementation. </p...|$|R
40|$|Background {{and study}} aims: A {{recently}} developed probe-based, confocal laser endomicroscopy (pCLE) system provides images of surface colonic epithelium in vivo during any endoscopy. Our {{objective was to}} assess interobserver agreement, sensitivity, specificity, and overall accuracy in the diagnosis of neoplasia using pCLE. Patients and methods: 53 patients undergoing surveillance and screening colonoscopies were enrolled. A total of 75 lesions, were detected and all were inspected by pCLE prior to sampling or polypectomy. Intravenous fluorescein was used to optimize tissue contrast. Three pCLE users, blinded to histopathologic and endoscopic findings, reviewed the set of video sequences for crypt architecture, vessel architecture, and colorectal neoplasia diagnosis. Histopathologic diagnosis from the corresponding biopsies was the reference gold standard. Results: Of the 75 colorectal lesions, 50 were neoplastic and 25 non-neoplastic. Interobserver agreement was moderate to good for the classification of neoplasia (kappa 0. 55, 78 % pairwise agreement), and moderate for vessel architecture (kappa 0. 41, 67 % pairwise <b>agreement)</b> and crypt <b>architecture</b> (kappa 0. 49, 69 % pairwise agreement). In distinguishing between neoplastic and non-neoplastic lesions, sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy were 76 %, 72 % and 75 %, respectively. When videos of good or excellent quality only were considered, interobserver agreement for classification of neoplasia was higher (kappa 0. 83, 92 % pairwise agreement), as were sensitivity (88 %), specificity (89 %), and accuracy (88 %).

Based on various proposals in the literature, this article adopts a global master-plan perspective, leaving executive architecture to sovereign participants. Transparent, flexible and fair top-down rules must synchronize the numerous bottom-up initiatives while addressing the diversity of national circumstances in the drastic transformation of the world's energy economies. Plan B refutes absolute emission reduction targets on old or speculative baselines. It criticizes global tax and permit trade instruments for being ineffective, inefficient and unfair when uniformly applied on a tremendous differentiated world. Plan B is built on three annually observed variables measuring percentage progress against rolling baselines (the variables' values in the previous year) : the ratio of net climate tax revenues to GDP, the commercial energy intensity of GDP, and the carbon intensity of commercial energy use. The three variables together indicate countries' progress affecting emissions per person, a metric that must converge to lower bands when climate change is addressed seriously. Long-term scenarios of global convergence "funnels" serve as guidance to frame near-term actions rich and poor countries individually propose to take. The global regime is common for all countries, and is ranked by GDP per person {{to determine whether a}} nation is a donor or a beneficiary in a Global Climate Transfer Fund. Fund payments and drawing rights depend on that ranking but also on the performances of the countries in realizing committed progress.

Interleukin 22 (IL- 22) is {{emerging}} as a key cytokine for gut epithelial homeostasis and mucosal repair. Gut disruption is a hallmark of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. Here, we investigated IL- 22 production and gut mucosal integrity in HIV type 1 (HIV- 1) -infected individuals receiving long-term antiretroviral therapy (ART). Methods.  Biopsy specimens from 37 individuals who underwent colonoscopy primarily for cancer screening and from 17 HIV- 1 -infected and 20 healthy age-matched controls were assessed. Results.  We found significant depletion of sigmoid IL- 22 -producing CD 4 + T cells (T-helper type 22 [Th 22] cells) even after prolonged ART, contrasting with the apparently normal compartments of regulatory and interleukin 17 (IL- 17) -producing CD 4 + T cells, as well as total mucosal CD 4 + T cells. Despite the preferential Th 22 cell depletion, IL- 22 production by innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) was similar to that observed in HIV- 1 -seronegative subjects, and transcription of genes encoding molecules relevant for IL- 22 production (ie, AHR, IL 23, IL 23 R, IL 1 B, IL 6, and TGFB 1) was preserved. Remarkably, levels of transcripts of IL- 22 -target genes (ie, REG 3 G, DEFB 4 A, S 100 A 9, MUC 1, and MUC 13) were unaltered, suggesting an adequate production of antimicrobial peptides and mucins. In <b>agreement,</b> enteric epithelial <b>architecture</b> was fully preserved. Conclusions.  Despite the reduced Th 22 cell subset, innate IL- 22 -mediated mechanisms, essential for sigmoid mucosa integrity, were fully operational in long-term-treated HIV- 1 -infected individuals. Our data highlight IL- 22 production by ILCs as an important target for therapies aimed at facilitating human mucosal reconstitution.
