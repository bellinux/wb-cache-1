25|$|In metal, the lip and {{spur drill}} bit is {{confined}} to drilling only the thinnest and softest sheet metals in <b>a</b> <b>drill</b> <b>press.</b> The bits have an extremely fast cutting tool geometry: no point angle and a large (considering the flat cutting edge) lip angle causes the edges {{to take a very}} aggressive cut with relatively little point pressure. This means these bits tend to bind in metal; given a workpiece of sufficient thinness, they have a tendency to punch through and leave the bit's cross-sectional geometry behind.|$|E
2500|$|In April 1956, the {{department}} issued a multi-state alert {{for a person}} described as a skilled mechanic, with access to <b>a</b> <b>drill</b> <b>press</b> or lathe (for its ability to thread pipe), who posted mail from White Plains, was over 40, and had a [...] "deep-seated hatred of the Consolidated Edison Company". A warning circular picturing a homemade pipe bomb similar to the bomber's was distributed. Police distributed samples of the bomber's distinctive printing and asked anyone who might recognize it to notify them. [...] A review of drivers' license applications in White Plains, the city favored by the bomber for posting his mail, found similarities in 500 {{of them to the}} bomber's printing; the names were forwarded to the NYPD for investigation.|$|E
40|$|Construction workers {{frequently}} perform overhead drilling into concrete, {{which is}} associated with a high frequency of pain and disability, presumably due to high shoulder loads and awkward neck postures. My thesis involved the design and evaluation of <b>an</b> Inverted <b>Drill</b> <b>Press,</b> <b>an</b> ergonomic intervention device for overhead drilling. In Study 1, I designed <b>a</b> new Inverted <b>Drill</b> <b>Press</b> based on feedback from focus groups. I then conducted field tests to evaluate the intervention on construction sites and compare it to conventional overhead drilling. Results showed reduced fatigue, improved usability, and improved neck posture with the intervention. Elevated shoulder postures and drilling speed were not improved and reflected areas where the Inverted <b>Drill</b> <b>Press</b> could be refined. In Study 2, I conducted biomechanical modelling to compare shoulder torques during drilling and to identify the optimal placement for the crank on <b>an</b> Inverted <b>Drill</b> <b>Press</b> in order to minimize shoulder torque...|$|R
5000|$|The {{manufacturing}} {{of small}} batches has often presented {{the biggest challenge}} to this division of methods. When only a small batch of output is demanded, will one (a) produce each piece using [...] "custom" [...] methods (handcrafting or toolroom-style layout and machining), which drives up unit cost; or (b) maintain the capital-cost-intensive toolroom-production division, which also drives up unit costs in its own ways? In other words, is it worth one's {{time to make a}} fixture, and is it worth tying up <b>a</b> <b>drill</b> <b>press's</b> availability by setting it up for dedicated use with that fixture? The <b>drill</b> <b>press</b> may be needed tomorrow for a different part, with a different setup. For 100 parts, the costs of making a fixture and tying up a machine's availability are justified. For 5 parts, maybe one should just make each of the 5 using toolroom-style layout and toolpath control.|$|R

50|$|A T-slot nut is {{used with}} a {{threaded}} clamp to position and secure pieces being worked on in a workshop. The T-slot nut slides along a T-slot track, which is set in workbench or table for <b>a</b> router, <b>drill</b> <b>press,</b> or bandsaw. T-slot nuts are also used with extruded aluminum framing, such as 80/20, to build a variety of industrial structures and machines.|$|R
5000|$|<b>A</b> {{radial arm}} <b>drill</b> <b>press</b> is <b>a</b> large geared head <b>drill</b> <b>press</b> {{in which the}} head can be moved along an arm that radiates from the machine's column. As it is {{possible}} to swing the arm relative to the machine's base, <b>a</b> radial arm <b>drill</b> <b>press</b> is able to operate over a large area without having to reposition the workpiece. This saves considerable time because it is much faster to reposition the drill head than it is to unclamp, move, and then re-clamp the workpiece to the table. The size of work that can be handled may be considerable, as the arm can swing {{out of the way of}} the table, allowing an overhead crane or derrick to place a bulky workpiece on the table or base. A vise may be used with <b>a</b> radial arm <b>drill</b> <b>press,</b> but more often the workpiece is secured directly to the table or base, or is held in a fixture. Power spindle feed is nearly universal with these machines and coolant systems are common. Larger size machines often have power feed motors for elevating or moving the arm. The biggest radial arm <b>drill</b> <b>presses</b> are able to drill holes as large as four inches (101.6 millimeters) diameter in solid steel or cast iron. Radial arm drills are specified by the diameter of the column and the length of the arm. The length of the arm is usually the same as the maximum throat distance. The Radial Arm Drill pictured in this article is a 9-inch column x 3-foot arm. The maximum throat distance of this drill would be approximately 36", giving a swing of 72" [...] (6 feet)..|$|R

50|$|In the arcades off {{the main}} road are workshops. Hundreds of closet-sized rooms where men and boys make working copies of the entire world's guns {{with nothing more than}} hand tools and <b>a</b> small <b>drill</b> <b>press.</b> The tools are astonishingly primitive, yet the forges turn out {{accurate}} reproduction of every conceivable sort of weapon, from pen pistols and hand-grenades to automatic rifles and anti-aircraft guns. The copies are so painstakingly reproduced that even the serial number of the original is carried over. A Darra gunsmith, given a rifle he hasn't seen before, can duplicate it in around ten days. Once the first copy is made, each additional copy takes two or three days due to the templates created. Handguns, being more complex, take a little longer.|$|R
50|$|Generally, reaming is done using <b>a</b> <b>drill</b> <b>press.</b> However, lathes, {{machining}} {{centers and}} similar machines {{can be used}} as well. The workpiece is firmly held in place by either a vise, chuck or fixture while the reamer advances.|$|E
50|$|Paper drills are {{machines}} {{similar to}} <b>a</b> <b>drill</b> <b>press</b> that use hollow drill bits {{to drill through}} stacks of paper. The hollow bit design allows the chads to be ejected during drilling. Paper drills in the United States are most commonly either single-hole or three-hole in construction.|$|E
50|$|It is {{also used}} on a lathe to hold {{drilling}} or reaming tools for machining {{a hole in the}} work piece. Unlike drilling with <b>a</b> <b>drill</b> <b>press</b> or a milling machine, the tool is stationary while the workpiece rotates.

50|$|<b>A</b> <b>drill</b> <b>press</b> (also {{known as}} a {{pedestal}} drill, pillar drill, or bench drill) is a fixed style of drill that may be mounted on a stand or bolted to the floor or workbench. Portable models with a magnetic base grip the steel workpieces they drill. <b>A</b> <b>drill</b> <b>press</b> consists of a base, column (or pillar), table, spindle (or quill), and drill head, usually driven by an induction motor. The head has a set of handles (usually 3) radiating from a central hub that, when turned, move the spindle and chuck vertically, parallel to the axis of the column. The drill press is typically {{measured in terms of}} swing. Swing is defined as twice the throat distance, which is the distance {{from the center of the}} spindle to the closest edge of the pillar. For example, a 16 in drill press has an 8 in throat distance.|$|E
5000|$|Similarly, in rotating-cutter {{metalworking}} {{machine tools}} (such as milling machines and <b>drill</b> <b>presses),</b> the spindle is the shaft {{to which the}} tool (such as <b>a</b> <b>drill</b> bit or milling cutter) is attached (for example, via a chuck).|$|R
40|$|The {{position}} of the first metatarsal following a crescentic osteotomy for hallux valgus {{is a function of}} the size of the saw cut and orientation of the osteotomy. This study reports the effect of these variables, recommended tech-nique, and potential pitfalls when using the crescent os-teotomy. Using molded polyurethane foam metatarsals and <b>a</b> precision <b>drill</b> <b>press</b> which controlled the saw cuts, the following variables were studied: (1) orientation of the saw cut to the metatarsal, (2) the saw size (diameter of the saw relative to the shaft width of the osteotomy site), and (3) the direction toward which the crescent faces (proximal/distal). Best correction can be obtained if the saw diameter is larger than the diameter of the osteotomy site (allowing a greater degree of correction before im-pingement), the saw tip is tilted slightly toward the sesa-moids (which ensures that the metatarsal does not rotate medially with correction), and the saw is rotated laterally to cause slight declination of the toe...|$|R

50|$|While early mass {{production}} of guitars dramatically {{increased the number}} of guitars in circulation, each instrument was still handcrafted by a single or team of luthiers. For luthiers who still choose to handcraft their instruments, methods have changed very little over the past 500 years.

40|$|The {{construction}} industry, {{which employs}} {{a significant portion}} of working British Columbians, exposes workers to risk factors associated with the development of musculoskeletal disorders. Particularly problematic in the neck and shoulders are tasks requiring overhead work. Plumbers, electricians and sheet metal workers who frequently drill overhead to attach anchors for hanging pipes, ducts, conduit, and wiring trays are particularly at risk. Few intervention devices aimed at reducing these disorders have been developed for commercial use. This study used a participative approach involving workers, contractors and researchers to develop and evaluate <b>an</b> inverted <b>drill</b> <b>press</b> with different attachments to be used in construction. The intervention device supported <b>a</b> hammer <b>drill</b> {{at the top of a}} column and the column was advanced up during <b>drilling</b> using <b>a</b> rotary handle and linear gear. Four drilling methods were compared: the usual method where the worker uses <b>a</b> <b>drill</b> with the hands while standing on a ladder, the intervention device alone, the intervention device with a mirror system, and the intervention device with a camera and display system.
