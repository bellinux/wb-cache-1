5000|$|The Boston Archdiocese {{initially}} granted Kennedy the annulment, {{which was}} discovered by Rauch only after the decision in 1996. Sheila, who is an Episcopalian, wrote a book Shattered Faith: A Woman's Struggle to Stop the Catholic Church from Annulling Her Marriage, explaining that she was opposed to the concept <b>of</b> <b>annulment</b> because it meant in Roman Catholic theology that the marriage had never actually existed, and claiming that the Kennedy family influence {{made it possible to}} unilaterally [...] "cancel" [...] a 12-year marriage.

40|$|The {{existence}} <b>of</b> <b>annulment</b> {{prior to}} the mid-nineteenth century is easily explained. Until 1857, England was a 2 ̆ 2 divorceless society. 2 ̆ 2 Accordingly, the only way an unhappy spouse could escape marriage was by seeking an annulment-a declaration that the marriage had never validly existed-from an ecclesiastical court operated by the Catholic Church. According to one family law scholar, 2 ̆ 2 annulments [in those times] performed what we would {{think of as the}} function of divorces. 2 ̆ 2 This explanation, though plausible in that context, fails to account for the continued vitality <b>of</b> <b>annulment</b> in late nineteenth and early twentieth-century America, a time when liberal divorce laws had been on the books in most states {{for more than a century}} and the divorce rate had long been on the rise. This article provides the first systematic exploration of the practice <b>of</b> <b>annulment</b> during this period. Based on original annul-ment records, this article presents data showing who sought annulment, the grounds they alleged, as well as what happened in annulment cases in-and out-of court. Beyond drawing a picture of the practice of annul-ment, this article offers insight into why annulment did not-and indeed, still has not-become obsolete, despite increasingly liberal divorce laws...|$|R

40|$|While lawful {{interests}} {{have long since}} acquired substantial importance, the evolution from the administrative jurisdiction <b>of</b> <b>annulment</b> to a relation-based one clashes with the impossibility of the judge {{to take the place}} of the administration.

The difficult distinction between ascertainments and questionable assessments, as one between "weak" and "strong" judgment on proceedings relating to the facts, may not be relevant if the administrative law judge orders the verification to the same resistant administration, making the court appoint a technical consultant. But the code of administrative law procedure precludes this possibility, specifying that verifications should be asked of "a public authority, not related to the parties to the trial" and that the appointment of the court-appointed consultant is an alternative to this request...|$|R
