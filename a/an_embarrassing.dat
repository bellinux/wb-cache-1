5|$|In 1998–99, the Senators {{jumped from}} 14th in the {{previous}} season to third, with 103 points—the first 100-point season in club history. The team, however, took <b>an</b> <b>embarrassing</b> pratfall in the playoffs, being swept by Buffalo after scoring just three goals in the entire series.|$|E
5|$|In September 1947, the Soviets created Cominform, {{the purpose}} of which was to enforce orthodoxy within the {{international}} communist movement and tighten political control over Soviet satellites through coordination of communist parties in the Eastern Bloc. Cominform faced <b>an</b> <b>embarrassing</b> setback the following June, when the Tito–Stalin Split obliged its members to expel Yugoslavia, which remained communist but adopted a non-aligned position.|$|E

5|$|The series—presented {{as if it}} were a real documentary—depicts the {{everyday}} lives of office employees in the Scranton, Pennsylvania, branch of the fictional Dunder Mifflin Paper Company. In the episode, Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) attempts to put on a theatrical presentation to impress Nellie Bertram (Catherine Tate). Meanwhile, in Scranton, Andy Bernard (Ed Helms) comes to work with <b>an</b> <b>embarrassing</b> black eye.|$|E
5|$|VAT {{signed a}} {{contract}} to sell 200 lorries to Turkey in 1959. The first two vehicles were shipped from Finland in 1959 but the contract was terminated in <b>an</b> <b>embarrassing</b> way because the Bank of Finland refused to take Turkish liras in payment.|$|E
5|$|Brown again guided Scotland to {{qualification}} {{for a major}} {{tournament in}} 1998, and Scotland were drawn against Brazil in the opening game of the 1998 World Cup. John Collins equalised from the penalty spot to level the score at 1–1, but a Tom Boyd own goal led to a 2–1 defeat. Scotland drew their next game 1–1 with Norway in Bordeaux, but the final match against Morocco ended in <b>an</b> <b>embarrassing</b> 3–0 defeat.|$|E

5|$|Manager Terry Yorath was {{replaced}} by John Toshack, who stuck with Southall but resigned after just 48 days after falling out with the Football Association of Wales. Results went badly under new boss Mike Smith, despite a 2–0 victory over Albania {{in the first game}} of qualifying for UEFA Euro 1996. <b>An</b> <b>embarrassing</b> 3–2 defeat to Moldova was followed by a heavy 5–0 loss to Georgia. Two defeats to Bulgaria ended faint hopes of qualification and cost Smith his job.|$|E
5|$|After {{failing to}} regain the WWF Tag Team Championship, Money Inc. began a feud with Razor Ramon. DiBiase had been making fun of Ramon over his upset loss to the 1-2-3 Kid, and even offered Ramon a job as his servant. Ramon was furious with DiBiase and turned face during their feud. Soon after, Ramon distracted DiBiase in a match against the 1-2-3 Kid, causing the Million Dollar Man <b>an</b> <b>embarrassing</b> loss of his own. At SummerSlam 1993, Razor Ramon {{defeated}} Ted DiBiase in what would be DiBiase's last WWF match. Later in the event, I.R.S. defeated the 1-2-3 Kid. DiBiase went on {{a leave of absence}} for several months, and Schyster returned to singles competition, feuding with Ramon.|$|E
5|$|As vice president, Brundage {{served on}} a {{commission}} appointed at the IOC's London session in 1948 to recommend whether the 1906 Intercalated Games, held in Athens, {{should be considered a}} full Olympic Games. All three members of what {{came to be known as}} the Brundage Commission were from the Western Hemisphere and met in New Orleans in January 1949. The commission found that there was nothing to be gained by recognizing the 1906 games as Olympic, and it might set <b>an</b> <b>embarrassing</b> precedent. The full IOC endorsed the report when it met later that year in Rome.|$|E

5|$|Following the speech, Nixon {{formally}} selected Governor Spiro Agnew of Maryland as {{his running}} mate, who received 1119 delegate votes, with the distant second being Governor Romney with 186. Agnew was relatively unknown nationally, and was selected due to his purported appeal to African Americans, and work for the Nixon campaign after <b>an</b> <b>embarrassing</b> experience {{as the head of}} the Draft Rockefeller movement. It was later noted that the convention had featured Nixon as the centrist candidate with Rockefeller to his left and Reagan to his right. The same analysis applied to the general campaign, as commentators noted that Nixon would stand to the right of the still undecided Democratic nominee but would fall to the left of American Independent Party candidate George Wallace.|$|E
5|$|The Soviet media {{frequently}} covered racial discrimination, financial crises, {{and unemployment}} in the United States, which were viewed as failings of the capitalist system that had been erased by communism. Lynchings of African Americans were seen as <b>an</b> <b>embarrassing</b> skeleton in the closet for the US, which the Soviets used {{as a form of}} rhetorical ammunition when reproached for their own economic and social failings. The phrase grew in usage in the 1960s during the Cold War. After the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991, the phrase became widespread as a reference to Russian information-warfare tactics. Its use subsequently became widespread in Russia to criticize any form of U.S. policy.|$|E
5|$|The {{first two}} days of the Flamingo {{engagement}} went by smoothly. On July 1, when reporting for makeup and wardrobe before their first show of the evening, Ballard discovered an extra set of gowns and costumes that had been brought along for Cindy Birdsong. Angered, Ballard performed the first concert of the night inebriated, leading to <b>an</b> <b>embarrassing</b> on-stage incident in which her stomach was revealed when she purposely thrust it forward during a dance routine. Enraged, Gordy ordered her back to Detroit and permanently dismissed her from the group. Birdsong officially assumed her place during the second July 1 show.|$|E

5|$|Based on the {{uncertain}} direction and slow {{speed of the}} drift, Nansen calculated that it might take the ship five years to reach the pole. In January 1894 he had first discussed with both Henriksen and Johansen the possibility of making a sledge journey with the dogs, from Fram to the pole, though they made no immediate plans. Nansen's first attempts to master dog-driving were <b>an</b> <b>embarrassing</b> failure, but he persevered and gradually achieved better results. He also discovered that the normal cross-country skiing speed {{was the same as}} that of dogs pulling loaded sledges. Men could travel under their own power, skiing, rather than riding on the sledge, and loads could be correspondingly increased. This, according to biographer and historian Roland Huntford, amounted to a revolution in polar travel methods.|$|E
5|$|Charles and the Duke of Buckingham, James's {{favourite}} {{and a man}} who {{had great}} influence over the prince, travelled incognito to Spain in February 1623 to try to reach agreement on the long-pending Spanish match. In the end, however, the trip was <b>an</b> <b>embarrassing</b> failure. The Infanta thought Charles was little more than an infidel, and the Spanish at first demanded that he convert to Roman Catholicism as a condition of the match. The Spanish insisted on toleration of Catholics in England and the repeal of the penal laws, which Charles knew would never be agreed by Parliament, and that the Infanta remain in Spain for a year after any wedding to ensure that England complied with all the terms of the treaty. A personal quarrel erupted between Buckingham and the Count of Olivares, the Spanish chief minister, and so Charles conducted the ultimately futile negotiations personally. When Charles returned to London in October, without a bride and to a rapturous and relieved public welcome, he and Buckingham pushed a reluctant King James to declare war on Spain.|$|E
5|$|Cranmer was not {{immediately}} accepted by the bishops within his province. When he attempted a canonical visitation, he had to avoid locations where a resident conservative bishop might make <b>an</b> <b>embarrassing</b> personal challenge to his authority. In 1535, Cranmer had difficult encounters with several bishops, John Stokesley, John Longland, and Stephen Gardiner among others. They objected to Cranmer's power and title and argued that the Act of Supremacy did not define his role. This prompted Thomas Cromwell, the king's chief minister, to activate and to take {{the office of the}} vicegerent, the deputy supreme head of ecclesiastical affairs. He created another set of institutions that gave a clear structure to the royal supremacy. Hence, the archbishop was eclipsed by Vicegerent Cromwell in regards to the king's spiritual jurisdiction. There is no evidence that Cranmer resented his position as junior partner. Although he was an exceptional scholar, he lacked the political ability to outface even clerical opponents. Those tasks were left to Cromwell.|$|E

5|$|In the East, Diocletian {{engaged in}} {{diplomacy}} with desert tribes {{in the regions}} between Rome and Persia. He might have been attempting to persuade them to ally themselves with Rome, thus reviving the old, Rome-friendly, Palmyrene sphere of influence, or simply attempting to reduce the frequency of their incursions. No details survive for these events. Some of the princes of these states were Persian client kings, a disturbing fact in light of increasing tensions with the Sassanids. In the West, Maximian lost the fleet built in 288 and 289, probably {{in the early spring}} of 290. The panegyrist who refers to the loss suggests that its cause was a storm, but this might simply have been an attempt to conceal <b>an</b> <b>embarrassing</b> military defeat. Diocletian broke off his tour of the Eastern provinces soon thereafter. He returned with haste to the West, reaching Emesa by 10 May 290, and Sirmium on the Danube by 1 July 290.|$|E
5|$|In {{the final}} two episodes, it is {{revealed}} that Wirt and Greg are actually two boys from the modern era. Wirt and Greg's strange appearance {{stems from the fact}} that the night they entered the Unknown was Halloween. Wirt, attempting to take back <b>an</b> <b>embarrassing</b> poetry tape he made for a girl he likes, had followed her to a graveyard scary story gathering before a police officer scared him and Greg into jumping over the cemetery's garden wall. On the other side of the wall, they landed on train tracks where Greg was almost hit by a train. Wirt pushed them both off a hill into a lake/river in an attempt to save him, knocking them both unconscious in the process and sending them to a Limbo-like realm between life and death.|$|E
5|$|Ireland {{failed to}} qualify for Euro 96, despite a strong start to the group, when they won their opening three games, {{including}} a 4–0 win against Northern Ireland. The Republic's next game was also against Northern Ireland, although {{the result was a}} 1–1 draw. From that point onwards the Republic stuttered badly as injuries struck down key players such as Roy Keane, Andy Townsend, John Sheridan and Steve Staunton. After beating the highly fancied Portugal, the Irish then endured <b>an</b> <b>embarrassing</b> 0–0 draw to Liechtenstein (this was Liechtenstein's only point in their ten matches), before losing twice to Austria, on both occasions by three goals to one. Although they defeated Latvia, Ireland needed to beat Portugal in Lisbon to qualify outright, but lost 3–0. They finished second in the group, ahead of Northern Ireland on goal difference, but as the worst performing runners-up they had to win a play-off game at Anfield against the Netherlands; Ireland lost 2–0 after a brace from Patrick Kluivert. Charlton resigned shortly after the game.|$|E
