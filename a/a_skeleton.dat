5|$|After the {{armistice}} in 1918, Bayern—together {{with the majority}} of the German High Seas Fleet—was interned at Scapa Flow, the home of the British Grand Fleet. Bayern arrived there on 23 November 1918 with <b>a</b> <b>skeleton</b> crew of only 175 men, including Lindemann, who was then ordered to return to Germany, arriving in Kiel on 12 January. On 21 June 1919, Admiral Ludwig von Reuter ordered the interned fleet to be scuttled, and Bayern sank at 14:30.|$|E
5|$|As the Doctor is a pacifist {{and did not}} use {{the guns}} {{commonly}} found in video games, The Adventure Games utilised a more strategy and puzzle-based gameplay. Much of the first game was based around stealth, exploration, and puzzle-solving. The Doctor was also equipped with his sonic screwdriver, but as this was often used as <b>a</b> <b>skeleton</b> key in the show the game employs the solving of puzzles to advance instead of simply using the screwdriver.|$|E

40|$|The {{existing}} skeleton extraction algorithms from {{a coarse}} and noisy model cannot achieve <b>a</b> satisfactory <b>skeleton,</b> {{let alone the}} joints' central position in a markerless motion capture system (e. g., <b>a</b> rigid <b>skeleton).</b> To solve this problem, we propose <b>a</b> rigid <b>skeleton</b> extraction algorithm from a noisy visual hull model with phantom volumes. Firstly, we reconstruct the subject visual hull and the corresponding volumetric model from a multiple-view synchronized video sequence. Secondly, the curve skeleton of the volume model is computed based on the theory of repulsive force fields. Thirdly, we propose a criterion for linking <b>a</b> curved <b>skeleton</b> to link the different <b>skeleton</b> limbs using <b>a</b> back-tracking method. At the same time, we obtain the distance and angle threshold values adaptively using a binary search algorithm. Finally, after achieving <b>a</b> smooth curve <b>skeleton,</b> we determine the joints' central positions in the <b>skeleton</b> using <b>a</b> priori information {{of the human body}} to form <b>a</b> rigid <b>skeleton.</b> Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm can obtain <b>a</b> desirable rigid <b>skeleton</b> with good robustness, less sensitivity to noise, and using an automatic procedure...|$|R

5|$|In 1929, Evans {{acknowledged}} that membership levels had declined but predicted a dramatic turnaround would soon occur. His prediction was inaccurate. This loss of members {{resulted in a}} Klan that was <b>a</b> <b>skeleton</b> of its former self. Historians have attributed this loss of membership to ineptness and hypocrisy {{on the part of}} Klan leadership. McVeigh argues that the Klan's inability to form alliances with other political groups led to the sharp loss of political power and solidarity within the group.|$|E

40|$|An {{intriguing}} unanswered {{question about}} the evolution of bilateral animals with internal <b>skeletons</b> is how <b>an</b> internal <b>skeleton</b> evolved in the first place. Compu-tational modeling {{of the development of}} bilateral symmetric organisms suggests an answer to this question. Our hypothesis is that <b>an</b> internal <b>skeleton</b> may have evolved from a bilaterally symmetric ancestor with <b>an</b> external <b>skeleton.</b> By grow-ing the organism inside-out <b>an</b> external <b>skeleton</b> becomes <b>an</b> internal <b>skeleton.</b> Our hypothesis is supported by a computational theory of bilateral symmetry that allows us to model and simulate this process. Inside-out development is achieved by an orientation switch. Given the development of two bilateral founder cells that generate a bilateral organism, a mutation that reverses the internal mirror orien-tation of those bilateral founder cells leads to inside-out development. The new orientation is epigenetically inherited by all progeny. A key insight is that each cell contained in the newly evolved organism with the internal skeleton develops according to the very same downstream developmental control network that di-rects the development of its exoskeletal ancestor. The networks and their genomes are are identical, but the interpretation is different because of the cell’s inverted orientation. The result is inside-out bilateral symmetric development generating an inside-out organism with <b>an</b> internal <b>skeleton...</b>|$|R

40|$|A convex network can {{be defined}} as a network such that every {{connected}} induced subgraph includes all the shortest paths between its nodes. Fully convex network would therefore be a collection of cliques stitched together in a tree. In this paper, we study the largest high-convexity part of empirical networks obtained by removing the least number of edges, which we call <b>a</b> convex <b>skeleton.</b> <b>A</b> convex <b>skeleton</b> is <b>a</b> generalization of a spanning tree in which each edge can be replaced by a clique of arbitrary size. We present different approaches for extracting convex skeletons and apply them to social collaboration and protein interactions networks, autonomous systems graphs and food webs. We show that the extracted convex skeletons retain the degree distribution, clustering, connectivity and also distances between the nodes, while making the shortest paths between the nodes largely unique. Moreover, in the Slovenian computer scientists coauthorship network, <b>a</b> convex <b>skeleton</b> retains the strongest ties between the authors, differently from a spanning tree or high-betweenness backbone and high-salience <b>skeleton.</b> <b>A</b> convex <b>skeleton</b> thus represents <b>a</b> simple definition of a network backbone with applications in coauthorship and other social collaboration networks.
