After reaching an elevation of , they turned back because they did not reach the summit before sundown. They reached the summit on their third attempt at 3:15 p.m. on October 9, 1829. Abovian dug a hole in the ice and erected a wooden cross facing north. Abovian picked up <b>a</b> <b>chunk</b> of ice from the summit and carried it down with him in a bottle, considering the water holy. On November 8, Parrot and Abovian climbed up Lesser Ararat. Years later, in 1845, the German mineralogist Otto Wilhelm Hermann von Abich climbed Ararat with Abovian. Abovian's third and last ascent of Ararat was with the Englishman Henry Danby Seymour in 1846.|$|E

40|$|We {{propose a}} Named Entity (NE) recog-nition method in which word chunks are {{repeatedly}} decomposed and concatenated. We can obtain features from word chunks, {{such as the}} first word of <b>a</b> word <b>chunk</b> and the last word of <b>a</b> word <b>chunk,</b> which can-not be obtained in word-sequence-based recognition methods. However, each word <b>chunk</b> may include <b>a</b> part of an NE or mul-tiple NEs. To solve this problem, we use the following operators: SHIFT for sepa-rating the first word from <b>a</b> word <b>chunk,</b> POP for separating the last word from <b>a</b> word <b>chunk,</b> JOIN for concatenating two word chunks, and REDUCE for assigning an NE label to <b>a</b> word <b>chunk.</b> We evalu-ate our method on a Japanese NE recog-nition data set that includes about 200, 000 annotations of 191 types of NEs from over 8, 500 news articles. The experimental re-sults show that the training and processing speeds of our method are faster than those of a linear-chain structured perceptron and a semi-Markov perceptron while high ac-curacy is maintained. ...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{describes}} statistical {{machine translation}} improved by applying hierarchical phrase alignment. The hierarchical phrase alignment is a method to align bilingual sentences phrase-by-phrase employing the partial parse results. Based on the hierarchical phrase alignment, a translation model is trained on <b>a</b> <b>chunked</b> corpus by converting hierarchically aligned phrases into <b>a</b> sequence of <b>chunks.</b> The second method transforms the bilingual correspondence of the phrase alignments into that of translation model. Both of our approaches yield better quality of the translaiton model. ...|$|R
25|$|The {{amount of}} water vapor in an {{atmosphere}} is constrained by the restrictions of partial pressures and temperature. Dew point temperature and relative humidity act as guidelines for the process of water vapor in the water cycle. Energy input, such as sunlight, can trigger more evaporation on an ocean surface or more sublimation on <b>a</b> <b>chunk</b> of ice {{on top of a}} mountain. The balance between condensation and evaporation gives the quantity called vapor partial pressure.|$|E

25|$|In {{the initial}} excavation, two large hearths were found and many small ones as well. The remains of local animals were found, in {{addition}} to wooden posts from approximately twelve huts.

A human footprint was {{also found in the}} clay, probably from a child. Inside the camp, archaeologists found <b>a</b> <b>chunk</b> of meat that still had preserved DNA. After a DNA analysis, it matched that of a gomphothere, indicating the type of food the inhabitants ate.|$|E

There is no direct evidence of voyaging out in dugouts to harpoon whales that could kill the voyagers in an instant. However, one of the two main types of pottery used was the blubber lamp, a small, oval deep dish in which you ignited <b>a</b> <b>chunk</b> of blubber or even oil with a wick.

It missed cars and caused no damage, bouncing harmlessly away despite the morning rush hour traffic. City crews were quickly sent to close off lanes of traffic to begin an inspection of the structure, which is a late 1960s post-tensioned design built by the province while it was still part of the QEW. This incident raised fears about safety of the highway, particularly with memories of the then-recent overpass collapse in Laval, Quebec, still fresh in the minds of motorists and media.|$|E

Magneto once was able to move the Blob by lifting the ground under the Blob's feet via metal pipes. Despite his appearance, the Blob's speed and agility are those of a fairly athletic male of normal stature, a fact which frequently catches his opponents by surprise.|$|E

The findings are used to arrive at <b>a</b> <b>chunking</b> and compression approach which maximizes deduplication savings while minimizing the generated metadata and producing <b>a</b> uniform <b>chunk</b> size distribution. Scaling of deduplication processing with data size is achieved using <b>a</b> RAM frugal <b>chunk</b> hash index and data partitioning – so that memory, CPU, and disk seek resources remain available to fulfill the primary workload of serving IO. We present the architecture of a new primary data deduplication system and evaluate the deduplication performance and chunking aspects of the system. ...|$|R
