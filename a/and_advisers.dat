5|$|In {{addition}} to training courses available at a NOAC or section conclave, the OA offers specialized leadership training as weekend events for members: Lodge Leadership Development (LLD), National Leadership Seminars (NLS), and National Lodge Adviser Training Seminar (NLATS). LLD is a one-day or two-day event {{conducted by a}} lodge to train their officers <b>and</b> <b>advisers.</b> NLS's are conducted by regions for lodge officers <b>and</b> <b>advisers.</b> Many lodges send key officers to receive training. Typically, each region schedules three or four NLS weekends annually, at geographically dispersed locations within the region. NLATS is a training event for adults, usually held in conjunction with an NLS and conducted by regions, {{on the role of}} advisers in the OA.|$|E
5|$|A mass exile of Mozambique's {{political}} intelligentsia to neighbouring countries provided havens {{from which}} radical Mozambicans could plan actions and foment political unrest in their homeland. The {{formation of the}} Mozambican guerrilla organisation FRELIMO {{and the support of}} the Soviet Union, China, Cuba, Yugoslavia, Bulgaria, Tanzania, Zambia, Egypt, Algeria and Gaddafi regime in Libya through arms <b>and</b> <b>advisers,</b> led to the outbreak of violence that was to last over a decade.|$|E
5|$|Nauru has no armed forces, {{though there}} is a small police force under {{civilian}} control. Australia is responsible for Nauru's defence under an informal agreement between the two countries. The September 2005 Memorandum of Understanding between Australia and Nauru provides the latter with financial aid and technical assistance, including a Secretary of Finance to prepare the budget, <b>and</b> <b>advisers</b> on health and education. This aid is in return for Nauru's housing of asylum seekers while their applications for entry into Australia are processed. Nauru uses the Australian dollar as its official currency.|$|E

5|$|On 26 December 211, at a {{reconciliation}} meeting arranged by their mother, Caracalla had Geta assassinated {{by members of}} the Praetorian Guard loyal to himself, Geta dying in his mother's arms. Caracalla then persecuted and executed most of Geta's supporters and ordered a damnatio memoriae pronounced by the Senate against his brother's memory. Geta's image was removed from all paintings, coins were melted down, statues were destroyed, his name was struck from papyrus records, and it became a capital offence to speak or write Geta's name. In the aftermath of the damnatio memoriae, an estimated 20,000 people were massacred. Those killed were Geta's inner circle of guards <b>and</b> <b>advisers,</b> friends, and other military staff under his employ.|$|E
5|$|On 30 January 1971, the ARVN and US forces {{launched}} Operation Dewey Canyon II {{which involved}} the re-opening of Route 9, securing the Khe Sanh area and re-occupying of KSCB as a forward supply base for Operation Lam Son 719. On 8 February 1971 the leading ARVN units marched along Route 9 into Southern Laos while the US ground forces <b>and</b> <b>advisers</b> were prohibited from entering Laos. US logistical, aerial, and artillery support {{was provided to}} the operation. Following the ARVN defeat in Laos, the newly re-opened KSCB came under attack by NVA sappers and artillery and the base was abandoned once again on 6 April 1971.|$|E
5|$|Australian {{forces were}} at times {{involved}} in heavy fighting, and significant actions included Operation Anaconda in 2002 and Operation Perth in 2006, {{as well as}} actions in Chora in 2007, Kakarak in 2009, the Shah Wali Kot and Derapet in 2010, and Doan in 2011; although others {{have yet to be}} publicly acknowledged due to operational security requirements. Casualties include 41 killed and 256 wounded, while another Australian also died serving with the British Army. Four Australians have been awarded the Victoria Cross for Australia, the first such decorations in forty years. Following a drawdown in forces, the last combat troops were withdrawn on 15 December 2013; however, approximately 400 personnel remain in Afghanistan as trainers <b>and</b> <b>advisers,</b> and are stationed in Kandahar and Kabul. Over 26,000 Australian personnel have served in Afghanistan.|$|E

5|$|General Paul D. Harkins, {{commander}} of the Military Assistance Command, Vietnam (MACV), made a much more optimistic assessment of the battle. He considered the operation {{to be a major}} success; after the Viet Cong abandoned their positions, the South Vietnamese units captured the hamlets of Ap Bac and Ap Tan Thoi. Harkins' evaluation of the battle's success was based on US military doctrine from World War II, in which opposing forces fought a conventional combined arms battle with the objective, on each side, of gaining control of the opponent's territory. The Viet Cong, however, were more interested in exposing the weaknesses of Diem's regime and its military. Moyar (2008) argues that Harkins' resolutely optimistic assessments based on conventional doctrine avoided recognizing shortcomings in tactics and battle readiness and in the arrangement under which ARVN commanders and their American counterparts <b>and</b> <b>advisers</b> were operating. Largely because of his attitude, neither the South Vietnamese nor the American commands learned useful lessons from the battle.|$|E
5|$|The Despenser family, in {{particular}} Hugh Despenser the Younger, became close friends <b>and</b> <b>advisers</b> to Edward, but in 1321 Lancaster {{and many of}} the barons seized the Despensers' lands and forced the King to exile them. In response, Edward led a short military campaign, capturing and executing Lancaster. Edward and the Despensers strengthened their grip on power, formally revoking the 1311 reforms, executing their enemies and confiscating estates. Unable to make progress in Scotland, Edward finally signed a truce with Robert. Opposition to the regime grew, and when Isabella was sent to France to negotiate a peace treaty in 1325, she turned against Edward and refused to return. Isabella allied herself with the exiled Roger Mortimer, and invaded England with a small army in 1326. Edward's regime collapsed and he fled into Wales, where he was captured in November. Edward was forced to relinquish his crown in January 1327 in favour of his fourteen-year-old son, Edward III, and he died in Berkeley Castle on 21 September, probably murdered on the orders of the new regime.|$|E
5|$|The Order of the Arrow is {{organized}} into four regions, Central, Southern, Northeast and Western Region; {{the boundaries of}} each OA region correspond with {{the boundaries of the}} BSA's regions. Each region has an elected region chief, a volunteer adult who is appointed as the region chairman to oversee its region Committee, and an appointed professional (staff) adviser. Each region chief is elected at the national planning meeting the day after the election of the national chief and vice chief by a caucus of the section chiefs from the given region. The members of the region committee consist of the region chief, the region chairman, all national committeemen from the region, and other appointed adult volunteers. Each region annually has a gathering of all section officers <b>and</b> <b>advisers.</b> As a region, they are trained in topics relevant to their jobs. Each region also provides opportunities for Order of the Arrow members to go through a National Leadership Seminar. This weekend course is highly rated and a lasting memory for many members.|$|E
