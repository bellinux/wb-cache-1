For Islamic hardliners and Ulemas, their program was mainly Anti-British and their religious stand became a cause of attraction for the poor peasants which meant to check economic oppression of the British-appointed political agents. Furthermore, the strong emphasis on Pashtun identity created by Bacha Khan made it extremely difficult for Muslim League's support for the Pakistan Movement. The 'Red Shirts' and the Congress were able to contain the Muslim League to non-Pashtun regions, such as Hazara Division and Attock District.|$|E
