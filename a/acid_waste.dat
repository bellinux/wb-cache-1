40|$|Pyrolysis is an {{attractive}} thermochemical conversion technology that may be utilised as a safe disposal option for <b>acid</b> tar <b>waste.</b> The kinetics of acid tar pyrolysis were investigated using thermogravimetry coupled with mass spectrometry under a nitrogen atmosphere at different heating rates of 10, 15 and 20 K min(- 1). The thermogravimetric analysis shows three major reaction peaks centred around 178 degrees C, 258 degrees C, and 336 degrees C corresponding to the successive degradation of water soluble lower molecular mass sulphonic acids, sulphonated high molecular mass hydrocarbons, and high molecular mass hydrocarbons. The kinetic parameters were evaluated using the iso-conversional Kissinger-Akahira-Sunose method. A variation in the activation energy with conversion revealed that the pyrolysis of the <b>acid</b> tar <b>waste</b> progresses through complex multi-step kinetics.

5000|$|The {{original}} process for [...] "cracking" [...] monazite {{so as to}} extract the thorium and lanthanide content was to heat it with concentrated sulfuric acid to temperatures between 120 and 150 °C for several hours.

40|$|Waters issuing from {{bituminous}} mines may {{be either}} acid or alkaline. The acid mine waters are objectionable; their disposal or abatement is highly desirable. Many agencies are concerned in {{the reduction of}} this important industrial waste for several reasons: pollution with <b>acid</b> <b>wastes</b> renders streams extremely acidic, pH 2. 0 to pH 4. 0, which results in the annihilation {{of the majority of}} commonly encountered micro- and macroorganisms in water; high concentrations of ferric, ferrous, and sulfate compounds are hazardous to children using such streams as bathing areas; the aesthetic quality of these streams is in a deplorable condition due to the deposition of ferric hydroxide in the channels of the streams. FORMATION OF ACID MINE WATER The oxidation of sulfur and sulfur-bearing compounds in coal seams results in the formation of large quantities of acid compounds available for solution in water.

50|$|The {{semiconductor}} industry uses {{a large amount}} of ultrapure water to rinse contaminants {{from the surface of the}} silicon wafers that are later turned into computer chips used in devices we use every day. The ultrapure water is by definition extremely low in contamination, but once it makes contact with the wafer surface it carries residual chemicals or particles from the surface that then end up in the industrial waste treatment system of the manufacturing facility. The contamination level of the rinse water can vary a great deal depending on the particular process step that is being rinsed at the time. A “first rinse” step may carry {{a large amount of}} residual contaminants and particles compared to a last rinse that may carry relatively low amounts of contamination. Typical semiconductor plants have only two drain systems for all of these rinses which are also combined with <b>acid</b> <b>waste</b> and therefore the rinse water is not effectively reused due to risk of contamination causing manufacturing process defects.|$|E

As a result he discovered that he had Bright's disease (hypertension with nephritis) with a dilated heart, a condition with a poor prognosis at the time. Hay started looking for ways to improve his condition. He first turned to a vegetarian diet and restricted his eating to once a day in the evening. Then he gave up coffee and a few months later he quit smoking tobacco. After three months of the new regimen his weight had dropped from 225 lbs. to 175 lbs. and he noticed improvements in his health. Motivated by this experience, Hay spent the following decade studying naturopathy, orthopathy and food combining in efforts to reduce as he termed it [...] "the vast quantities of <b>acid</b> <b>waste</b> that result from wrong selection and combination of the daily foods". He claimed that fruits and vegetables produced alkaline 'end-products' when they were metabolized, while processed and refined foods resulted in acidic 'end-products' after digestion. His theories went on to encompass food-combining; stating that incorrect combinations of foods would cause even alkaline foods to leave a less desirable acidic digestion end-product. [...] "Any carbohydrate foods require alkaline conditions for their complete digestion, so must not be combined with acids of any kind, as sour fruits, because the acid will neutralise. Neither should these be combined with a protein of concentrated sort as these protein foods will excite too much hydrochloric acid during their stomach digestion."

40|$|AbstractThe <b>waste</b> <b>acid</b> residue is {{limestone}} neutralized slag in {{the preparation}} of acid with pyrometallurgical exhaust in lead production enterprises. There are many hazardous heavy metals in the slag, such as lead, mercury, cadmium, arsenic, etc. It is difficult to remove them from the <b>waste</b> <b>acid</b> residue. The leakage of the heavy metals will gradually get into the groundwater and the soil, contaminate the surrounding environment. However, the <b>waste</b> <b>acid</b> residue can be used to prepare geopolymer in order to solidify the toxic elements. The present experiment aimed to investigate the leakage rate of lead from the geopolymer made by the <b>waste</b> <b>acid</b> residue. The samples were lixiviated by a mixture of sulfuric and nitric acid, with the mass ratio of sulphuric acid/ nitric acid 2 : 1. The ratio of liquid to solid was 10 : 1. And the geopolymer was oscillated for 18 hours on the turnover oscillation. The leaching of lead under influence of acidic rainfall and then entering into the environment was simulated. The lead in the supernatant of leaching solution under different conditions was analyzed. And the result showed that lead can be well solidified in the geopolymer made by the <b>waste</b> <b>acid</b> residue...|$|R

An in-pit disposal program for <b>acid</b> generating <b>waste</b> rock was: conducted by Lakefield Research Limited at an abandoned mine site which operated as an open pit and underground mine. The mine was closed in 1975 and the mine property was included in a provincial park.

The data collected during the ESA was used to develop a reclamation program that would address the site specific conditions that would maximize the on site resources to minimize the costs of the reclamation program. A testing program was conducted as part of the ESA. The data from the testing program was used to determine the acid generating potential of the waste rock and the surface water quality.
