500|$|Perry {{thoroughly}} enjoyed {{what he was}} doing, {{saying in}} a 1989 interview, [...] "I got <b>a</b> <b>kick</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> live television. The spontaneity was the fun of it." [...] Spontaneity {{and the ability to}} be himself came in handy for swimmer/actress Esther Williams' guest appearance of March 16, 1957. A wardrobe malfunction meant that viewers were seeing more of Esther than 1950s television considered to be in good taste; more live show mishaps followed. At the show's end, Williams was swimming in a pool specially constructed on the set for her appearance. Como simply said, [...] "Goodnight, folks," [...] and leaped, fully clothed, into the swimming pool.|$|E
500|$|The Sci-Fi Dine-In has {{received}} mixed reviews. Jack Hayes of Nation's Restaurant News calls the Sci-Fi Dine-In [...] "wacky" [...] and [...] "on {{the cutting edge}} of sheer dining fun". In USA Todays list of the sixteen best restaurants in American amusement parks, the Sci-Fi Dine-In ranks fifteenth. Samuel Muston of The Independent writes that the Sci-Fi Dine-In is [...] "memorable in the best way". In the Evansville Courier & Press, Pete DiPrimio writes that the Sci-Fi Dine-In ranks among the most unusual of the restaurants at Disney's Hollywood Studios. In The Unofficial Guide to Walt Disney World 2015, Bob Sehlinger and Len Testa call the Sci-Fi Dine-In the most entertaining restaurant in Walt Disney World, writing that [...] "everyone gets <b>a</b> <b>kick</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> this unusual dining room".|$|E
500|$|Douglass {{was one of}} {{the final}} five players cut during {{training}} camp by the Bears at the beginning of September, but they re-signed him in late November when they put Jim McMahon on injured reserve. [...] He did not play much in 1986, but was described as a favorite of coach Mike Ditka by the Chicago Sun-Times. [...] Chicago Tribune writers noted that Ditka got <b>a</b> <b>kick</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> his big earring and fashion sense. [...] In the 1987–88 NFL playoffs, although had only one previous start in his two-year career, he started for the Bears in place of five-year veteran Mike Richardson at left cornerback against the Redskins in their January 10, 1988 Divisional playoff game. [...] The following season, when Shaun Gayle suffered a season-ending injury for the 1988 Bears, he took over the starting free safety assignment.|$|E

500|$|Bond 25 began {{development}} in early 2016; Mendes stated {{he would not}} be the film's director. In October 2016, Craig stated that he may indeed return for another film, saying, [...] "As far as I'm concerned, I've got the best job in the world. I'll keep doing it as long as I still get <b>a</b> <b>kick</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> it. If I were to stop doing it, I would miss it terribly." [...] Sony Pictures's contract to co-produce the series with MGM and Eon expired with the release of Spectre and the distribution rights to release Bond 25 in cinemas were put up for negotiation, with MGM and Eon only offering a one-film contract. In July 2017 it was announced that the film would be released on 8 November 2019. In August 2017 Craig confirmed that he would reprise his role as Bond.|$|E
500|$|Anthony Lane of The New Yorker said, [...] "To find a comic-book {{hero who}} doesn't agonize over his supergifts, and would defend his {{constitutional}} right to get <b>a</b> <b>kick</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> them, is frankly a relief". David Edelstein of New York Magazine wrote, [...] "It doesn't {{come close to the}} emotional heft of those two rare 2s that outclassed their ones: Superman II and Spider-Man 2. But Iron Man 2 hums along quite nicely". Roger Ebert gave it 3 stars out of 4, stating that [...] "Iron Man 2 is a polished, high-octane sequel, not as good as the original but building once again on a quirky performance by Robert Downey Jr". Frank Lovece of Film Journal International, a one-time Marvel Comics writer, said that, [...] "In a refreshing and unexpected turn, the sequel to Iron Man doesn't find a changed man. Inside the metal, imperfect humanity grows even more so, as thought-provoking questions of identity meet techno-fantasy made flesh." ...|$|E
500|$|Sam McPherson of Zap2it {{said that}} he [...] "enjoyed 'A Christmas Carol' more than I have almost any other special that has aired since the series {{restarted}} in 2005", but thought that [...] "some parts were absolutely silly, and others were absolutely incoherent" [...] due to the frantic pace. While he considered Amy and Rory [...] "criminally underused", they were responsible for [...] "heavy laughs" [...] and left the Doctor to be the [...] "delight of the episode". The Daily Telegraph Chris Harvey was less enthusiastic about the episode, saying that it [...] "started nicely", but that [...] "by {{the time she was}} singing to the shark, I'd had enough," [...] while thinking that, [...] "It's not really for old curmudgeons like me, who got more of <b>a</b> <b>kick</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> Michael Gambon's miserly Kazran Sardick when he was sneering and snarling {{at the beginning of the}} episode than when he had been thoroughly heartwarmed by the end." ...|$|E

500|$|In {{subsequent}} {{sessions in}} May and November 1953, Sinatra and Riddle developed and refined their musical collaboration, with Sinatra providing specific guidance on the arrangements. Sinatra's first album for Capitol, Songs for Young Lovers, {{was released on}} January 4, 1954, and included [...] "A Foggy Day", [...] "I Get <b>a</b> <b>Kick</b> <b>Out</b> <b>of</b> You", [...] "My Funny Valentine", [...] "Violets for Your Furs" [...] and [...] "They Can't Take That Away from Me", songs which became staples of his later concerts.

Sinatra's second album with Riddle, Swing Easy!, which reflected his [...] "love for the jazz idiom" [...] according to Granata, was released on August 2 of that year and included [...] "Just One of Those Things", [...] "Taking a Chance on Love", [...] "Get Happy", and [...] "All of Me". Swing Easy! was named Album of the Year by Billboard, {{and he was also}} named [...] "Favorite Male Vocalist" [...] by Billboard, Down Beat, and Metronome that year. Sinatra came to consider Riddle [...] "the greatest arranger in the world", and Riddle, who considered Sinatra [...] "a perfectionist", offered equal praise of the singer, observing, [...] "It's not only that his intuitions as to tempi, phrasing, and even configuration are amazingly right, but his taste is so impeccable... there is still no one who can approach him." ...|$|E
500|$|Hochuli's {{presence}} {{on the football field}} has created a cult following. His rise in popularity {{is believed to have been}} started by Phil Simms, a former NFL quarterback and current color commentator for the NFL on CBS, who made reference to the size of Hochuli's arms during a telecast. [...] On the Internet, websites that sell Hochuli merchandise as well as blogs with his namesake exist. He is often affectionately referred to as [...] "Hochules", a portmanteau of his last name and [...] "Hercules", in homage to his large biceps. While he is aware of his celebrity status, Hochuli does not understand it. He said in a USA Today interview, [...] "I get <b>a</b> <b>kick</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the notoriety, because I'm just a referee. I'm not the players. The players are the game. They're what this is all about. I get notoriety because I explain things, and I get notoriety because I have a decent physique, which is funny because I'm a shrimp, a peewee compared to those players. Neither one of those things has anything to do with whether I'm a good referee." [...] His recognition extends to the streets, in airports, and in the courtroom. He has been approached by notable athletes such as former National Basketball Association (NBA) player Charles Barkley at the airport. [...] "It never ceases to amaze me," [...] Hochuli told the Arizona Daily Star. [...] "The number of people that will just come up to me and recognize me." [...] He appreciates the attention, saying, [...] "I enjoy the fact that there are people who like me as a referee. I hear from a lot of people and I enjoy that. Like anybody, I like praise. Probably because of my personality, I thrive on that more than other people." ...|$|E

50|$|A {{speech that}} Weingarten gave in 2011 {{turned out to}} have been plagiarized from a NY 1 series on a flawed Board of Education {{computer}} system.

50|$|In Canadian {{football}} {{the term}} touchback is not used.

2500|$|Former Yankee {{third baseman}} Scott Brosius was notorious for not {{responding}} {{immediately to the}} roll call, as other players on the diamond would.
