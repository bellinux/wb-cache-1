5|$|Birds <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>primary</b> {{natural enemies}} of the Sirex woodwasp. The adults are {{frequently}} hunted by swallows (Hirundidae) and swifts (Apodidae), both of which prefer males. The black woodpecker (Dryocopius martius) and great spotted woodpecker (Dendrocopus major) consume some larvae, but do not specialize on the Sirex woodwasp.|$|E
5|$|Seeds <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>primary</b> {{way that}} trees {{reproduce}} and their seeds vary greatly {{in size and}} shape. Some of the largest seeds come from trees, but the largest tree, Sequoiadendron giganteum, produces {{one of the smallest}} tree seeds. The great diversity in tree fruits and seeds reflects the many different ways that tree species have evolved to disperse their offspring.|$|E
5|$|Several rock types {{with varying}} {{chemical}} compositions make up Level Mountain. Ankaramites and alkali basalts <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>primary</b> volcanic rocks comprising the basal shield. Alkali basalts form columnar jointed lava flows, vesicular lava flows, dikes and scoria while ankaramites are present as dark-coloured lava flows with several columnar cooling units. Trachybasalts, phonolites, trachytes, peralkaline trachytes, pantellerites, comendites and rhyolites form the overlying stratovolcano and domes. They comprise dikes, welded tuffs, pitchstones, volcanic plugs, laccoliths and flows. Trachybasalts {{are in the}} form of two textural types; phenocryst-rich lava flows and fragmental flow agglomerates. Phonolites are vesicular and pumiceous in nature, although phonolites with trachytic texture are also present. Trachytes and peralkaline trachytes <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>primary</b> volcanic rocks in the Level Mountain Range. Comendite lava flows appear to have erupted fluidly, forming lava tubes. Rhyolites are {{in the form of}} stubby lava flows and domes.|$|E

5|$|Today, sandstone, shale, granite, and {{serpentine}} <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>primary</b> rock {{types in}} the Chetco region. Various forms of loam comprise its soil.

5|$|Viruses (particularly rotavirus) and the {{bacteria}} Escherichia coli and Campylobacter species <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>primary</b> causes of gastroenteritis. There are, however, many other infectious agents {{that can cause}} this syndrome. Non-infectious causes are seen on occasion, but {{they are less likely}} than a viral or bacterial cause. Risk of infection is higher in children due to their lack of immunity and relatively poor hygiene.|$|E
5|$|A railway line {{existed before}} the war, {{but the last}} {{remnants}} of the line were dismantled in 1959. A rail project was announced in 2008 to be {{in line with the}} transport needs of SCORE, but as yet no construction work has begun despite an anticipated completion date in 2015. In 2017, the Sarawak government proposed a light rail system (Kuching Line) connecting Kuching, Samarahan and Serian divisions with anticipated completion in 2020. Currently, buses <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>primary</b> mode of public transportation in Sarawak with interstate services connecting the state to Sabah, Brunei, and Pontianak (Indonesia).|$|E

5|$|As no {{complete}} dodo specimens exist, its external appearance, such as plumage and colouration, {{is hard to}} determine. Illustrations {{and written}} accounts of encounters with the dodo between its discovery and its extinction (1598–1662) <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>primary</b> evidence for its external appearance. According to most representations, the dodo had greyish or brownish plumage, with lighter primary feathers and a tuft of curly light feathers high on its rear end. The head was grey and naked, the beak green, black and yellow, and the legs were stout and yellowish, with black claws. A study {{of the few remaining}} feathers on the Oxford specimen head showed that they were pennaceous rather than plumaceous (downy) and most similar to those of other pigeons.|$|E
5|$|Calabozos {{lies between}} two {{different}} types of volcanism—to its north, andesite and rhyolite <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>primary</b> constituents of lava while its southern neighbors are composed of more mafic andesite and basalt. It is mainly basaltic andesite and rhyodacite that make up Calabozos, forming a calcalkilic suite rich with potassium. Its lavas are dotted with phenocrysts, which vary from 2 to 25percent of their mass. These phenocrysts are typically made of plagioclase, but also contain clinopyroxene, orthopyroxene, ilmenite, apatite, and titanomagnetite.|$|E

5|$|Frogs are primary {{predators and}} an {{important}} part of the food web. Being cold-blooded, they make efficient use of the food they eat with little energy being used for metabolic processes, while the rest is transformed into biomass. They are themselves eaten by secondary predators and <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>primary</b> terrestrial consumers of invertebrates, most of which feed on plants. By reducing herbivory, they play a part in increasing the growth of plants and are thus part of a delicately balanced ecosystem.|$|E

5|$|Genes <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>primary</b> {{units of}} {{inheritance}} in all organisms. A gene is {{a unit of}} heredity and corresponds to a region of DNA that influences the form or function of an organism in specific ways. All organisms, from bacteria to animals, share the same basic machinery that copies and translates DNA into proteins. Cells transcribe a DNA gene into an RNA version of the gene, and a ribosome then translates the RNA into a sequence of amino acids known as a protein. The translation code from RNA codon to amino acid {{is the same for}} most organisms. For example, a sequence of DNA that codes for insulin in humans also codes for insulin when inserted into other organisms, such as plants.|$|E
5|$|Heavy {{rains and}} {{flooding}} <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>primary</b> problem associated with tropical cyclones across the Pelican State. Recent examples of flooding {{across the state}} from tropical cyclones include Tropical Storm Allison in 2001, Tropical Storm Frances in 1998, Tropical Storm Allison in 1989, and Tropical Storm Claudette in 1979. Three of the four systems stalled across eastern Texas, prolonging the rainfall which occurred over Louisiana. If {{it were not for}} the intermittent invasions from tropical cyclones, rainfall during the months of August, September, and October would average about 25% less than it currently does.|$|E
5|$|In {{explosive}} eruptions, {{the eruption}} of magma {{is driven by the}} rapid release of pressure, often involving the explosion of gas previously dissolved within the material. The most famous and destructive historical eruptions are mainly of this type. An eruptive phase can consist of a single eruption, or a sequence of several eruptions spread over several days, weeks or months. Explosive eruptions usually involve thick, highly viscous, silicic or felsic magma, high in volatiles like water vapor and carbon dioxide. Pyroclastic materials <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>primary</b> product, typically in the form of tuff. Eruptions the size of that at Lake Toba 74,000 years ago, at least , or the Yellowstone eruption 620,000 years ago, around , occur worldwide every 50,000 to 100,000years.|$|E

All villagers {{that are not}} shipped from the Home City cost wood instead of food. Villagers are also not allowed to harvest livestock for food, but instead can build a structure called a Sacred Field which generates experience points whenever livestock are tasked to it. Sepoys (Musketeers), Gurkha (Skirmishers) and Rajputs (much like Rodeleros) <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>primary</b> infantry units, and India has several types of camel and elephant cavalry.

5|$|Saprotrophic wood-decay fungi <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>primary</b> {{cause of}} {{decomposition}} of wood, causing {{billions of dollars}} of economic damage each year. Fungal decay, while useful in composting, is destructive of timber exposed to the weather, {{and in the case of}} dry rot caused by Serpula lacrymans, also of timbers in largely dry houses. Some wood-decay fungi such as the honey fungi, species of Armillaria, are parasites of living trees, attacking their roots and eventually killing them, and continuing to decompose the wood when they are dead. Honey fungus is a serious horticultural pest, as it can spread from tree to tree by long strap-shaped rhizomorphs in the soil.|$|E

Certain breeds of dog suffer from narcolepsy making them the major model used to study the human condition.
