5|$|Astrid Kruse Jensen (born 1975, {{educated in}} the Netherlands and Scotland) specializes in {{photographs}} taken at night which evoke the zone between reality and imagination. Carefully combining the effects of <b>artificial</b> <b>light</b> with the surrounding darkness, she creates mysterious images of lakes, swimming pools and solitary figures in the twilight. Since 2003, she has participated in key exhibitions in Denmark and elsewhere.|$|E

Unlike modern linescan units that use infrared imaging, the TSR-2's linescan would use daylight imaging or an <b>artificial</b> <b>light</b> source to illuminate the ground for night reconnaissance.|$|E
5|$|Artificial {{lighting}} discourages nesting and {{interferes with}} the hatchlings' ability to navigate to the water's edge. Females prefer nesting on beaches free of artificial lighting. On developed beaches, nests are often clustered around tall buildings, perhaps because they block out the man-made light sources. Loggerhead hatchlings are drawn toward the brighter area over the water which is the consequence of the reflection of moon and star light. Confused by the brighter <b>artificial</b> <b>light,</b> they navigate inland, away from the protective waters, which exposes them to dehydration and predation as the sun rises. Artificial lighting causes {{tens of thousands of}} hatchling deaths per year.|$|E
40|$|The {{daylighting}} and the <b>artificial</b> <b>lighting</b> {{is a part}} of environment. The lighting {{plays an}} important role in life of everyone of us. We know that it is not possible fully replace daylighting by <b>artificial</b> <b>lighting.</b> The amount of daylight is important mainly in areas with permanent stay of people and it influences the choice of parameters and functions of system of <b>artificial</b> <b>lighting.</b> That`s why I focus on the relations between daylighting and <b>artificial</b> <b>lighting</b> in my report. Owing to these relations I evaluate influences causing an optimal using of <b>artificial</b> <b>lighting.</b> Finally, I state here the influence of using of lighting sources in lighting on environment and ecological aspects used for the production and the liquidation of light sources...|$|R
50|$|Night skies are {{obscured}} by <b>artificial</b> <b>lights</b> {{in many cities}} around the world. These lights are illuminated from buildings, roads and other human structures. When flying across the city, migratory birds could become attracted to <b>artificial</b> <b>lights</b> in the sky. These birds tend to follow light beams and fly continuously in circles, dying from exhaustion or predators as the result. Increased illumination due to <b>artificial</b> <b>lighting</b> could also disrupt foraging behavior of diurnal birds, making these species forage at night, instead of the day. The negative effects from <b>artificial</b> <b>lights</b> are particularly evident in bad weather and when stars are covered by clouds, because birds that migrate at night use light beams for navigation. To decrease the impact of <b>artificial</b> <b>lighting,</b> many cities had implemented lights out program, in which people turn off or dim the lights in tall buildings during migration season.|$|R

5|$|DST's {{potential}} {{to save energy}} comes primarily from its effects on residential lighting, which consumes about 3.5% of electricity in the United States and Canada. Delaying the nominal time of sunset and sunrise reduces the use of <b>artificial</b> <b>light</b> {{in the evening and}} increases it in the morning. As Franklin's 1784 satire pointed out, lighting costs are reduced if the evening reduction outweighs the morning increase, as in high-latitude summer when most people wake up well after sunrise. An early goal of DST was to reduce evening usage of incandescent lighting, once a primary use of electricity. Although energy conservation remains an important goal, energy usage patterns have greatly changed since then, and recent research is limited and reports contradictory results. Electricity use is greatly affected by geography, climate, and economics, making it hard to generalize from single studies.|$|E
5|$|The divine {{represented}} by light is a motif {{in keeping with}} the sentiment of both the Latin text on the hem of Mary's dress (which compares her beauty and radiance to that of divine light) and on the frame. A separate source of light, which also behaves as if from a divine rather than natural source, illuminates her face. The two pools of light behind her have been described as lending the painting a mystical atmosphere, indicating the presence of God. In the niche behind her, the statues are lit by two candles - symbols of the incarnation, whereas she is bathed in natural light. The <b>artificial</b> <b>light</b> adds to the overall illusion of the interior of the church, which Pächt views as achieved mainly through colour.|$|E
5|$|When {{creating}} {{the look of}} the Infected, the art team cycled through various iterations. Some early ideas included the Infected looking like aliens or zombies. The final design was chosen when lead character artist Michael Knowland incorporated images of diseases and fungal growth onto a human. He expressed the difficulty in changing the art from 2D to 3D, which would allow viewing from different angles. The process of sending completed concept art to the lighting and visual effects artists, who re-create the art within the game's engine. Due to the lack of <b>artificial</b> <b>light</b> sources in the game's world, the team was forced to work with natural light. To achieve high quality lighting, they used lightmaps. The use of lightmaps led to various problems, such as the discontinuities in the lighting; this was fixed by slightly modifying the texel intensities. When characters were added to scenes, they initially looked out of place; the addition of a shadow generally fixed this.|$|E

One of the aspect {{to consider in}} creating a good library environment is lighting. Lighting needs can be met from daylighting and <b>artificial</b> <b>lighting.</b> <b>Artificial</b> <b>lighting</b> had advantage in terms of relatively constant light intensity {{in the range of}} work hours, but this approach requires electric operating costs. This research analyzes the current lighting conditions in Sebelas Maret university library that influenced by daylighting and <b>artificial</b> <b>lighting.</b> The analysis process will be using software surfer V. 10 based on the value of the intensity of light at each measuring point. The result indicated that the average of light intensity is still below the prescribed standard so that redesign needs to be done.

40|$|Reducing energy {{consumption}} while maintaining acceptable environmental quality in buildings {{has been a}} challenging task for building professionals. In office buildings, <b>artificial</b> <b>lighting</b> systems are a major consumer of energy and can significantly contribute to building cooling load. Furthermore, although reliable, <b>artificial</b> <b>lighting</b> does not necessarily provide the required quality of lighting. Significant improvement in lighting quality and {{energy consumption}} {{can be achieved by}} proper integration of daylight and <b>artificial</b> <b>lighting.</b> The objective {{of this study is to}} investigate the energy performance of office buildings resulting from daylight and <b>artificial</b> <b>lighting</b> integration in hot climates. A parametric analysis is conducted to find the impact of different window design parameters, including window area, height and glazing type, on building energy performance. Results have shown that as much as 35 % reduction in lighting energy consumption and 13 % reduction in total energy consumption can be obtained when proper daylighting and <b>artificial</b> <b>lighting</b> integration is achieved...|$|R

5|$|Filming {{took place}} on the streets of Kolkata, where Ghosh often {{employed}} the art of guerrilla filmmaking (shooting in real locations without any previous knowledge given to onlookers) to avoid unwanted attention. The cinematographer Setu, who had assisted others in the past to shoot documentaries in Kolkata, said that unlike majority of Indian films, Kahaani was shot mostly without <b>artificial</b> <b>light.</b> The film was shot in 64 days, during which the Durga Puja festival of 2010 took place. Shooting locations in Kolkata included Kalighat Metro station, Nonapukur tram depot, Kumartuli, Howrah Bridge, Victoria Memorial, old houses of North Kolkata and others. The climax, which takes place on the night of Vijayadashami (the last day of Durga Puja), was shot on the night of Vijayadashami in the premises of a Barowari (publicly organised) Durga Puja celebration in the Ballygunge neighbourhood of Kolkata. Most of the crowd in the climax were not actors. Some actors mingled with the crowd engaged in Sindoor khela—their job was to appreciate the camera angles and accordingly apply sindoor (vermilion) on Vidya's face so that accidental exposure of her eyes to sindoor could be avoided.|$|E
