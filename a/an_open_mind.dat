25|$|Yeah sure, we see {{ourselves}} as a metal band, but without boundaries and limitations to our sound. We do not necessarily belong to a certain subgenre within metal. We're just playing dark and heavy music and keeping <b>an</b> <b>open</b> <b>mind</b> to evolve and being true to ourselves. I'm proud to say that I believe KATATONIA sounds like no other band. We have eloquently avoided the gothic metal genre most bands tend to fall in when changing their sound from doom/death metal to something more rocking and melodic. We're leaning towards more of a contemporary alternative sound, free of all cheese and clichés.|$|E

25|$|Under the {{scientific}} method as conceived in the 17th century, natural and artificial circumstances were set aside as a research tradition of systematic experimentation was slowly accepted by {{the scientific}} community. The philosophy of using an inductive approach to obtain knowledge — to abandon assumption and to attempt to observe with <b>an</b> <b>open</b> <b>mind</b> — was {{in contrast with the}} earlier, Aristotelian approach of deduction, by which analysis of known facts produced further understanding. In practice, many scientists and philosophers believed that a healthy mix of both was needed — the willingness to question assumptions, yet also to interpret observations assumed to have some degree of validity.|$|E
25|$|The {{issue of}} a court {{descending}} into the arena and depriving a party {{of the right to}} a fair trial was also distinguished from that of prejudgment, as in Roseli bin Amat v. Public Prosecutor (1989). When a judge is found to have prejudged, he will not have <b>an</b> <b>open</b> <b>mind</b> and is likely to have determined issues adversely against a party before the presentation of a case. However, when he descends into the arena, he may not necessarily have taken sides before the hearing. The difference may lie in how actively the judge pursues this position and how he comes to be persuaded.|$|E

500|$|No {{account or}} allusion to Philip's presumed {{conversion}} to Christianity survives. The Byzantinist and Arabist Irfan Shahîd, who argues {{in favor of}} Philip's Christianity in Rome and the Arabs, assumes {{that he had been}} a Christian before becoming emperor. He argues, therefore, that {{there is no need to}} explain the absence of evidence for Philip's conversion in contemporary Christian literature. Trachonitis, equidistant from Antioch in the north and Bosra in the south, and sited on a road connecting the two, could have been Christianized from either direction. Even if he was not himself Christian, Philip would probably have been familiar with Christians in his hometown as well as Bosra and other nearby settlements. Hans Pohlsander, a classicist and historian arguing against accounts of Philip's Christianity, allows that Philip [...] "may have been curious about a religion which had its origins in an area so close to his place of birth. As an eastern provincial rather than an Italian, he may not have been so intense in his commitment to the traditional Roman religion that he could not keep <b>an</b> <b>open</b> <b>mind</b> on other religions." [...] He also accepts that Philippopolis probably contained a Christian congregation during Philip's childhood. For the scholar of religion Frank Trombley, however, the absence of evidence for the early Christianization of Philippopolis makes Shahîd's assumption that Philip was Christian from early childhood unmerited.|$|E
500|$|Composer Tim Larkin, a sound {{designer}} and audio director at Cyan {{who had previously}} worked on realMyst and , was given the task of developing Myst Vs musical score. Larkin stated that whereas earlier Myst games had been constrained by technological limitations, the available technology allowed End of Ages {{to have a more}} dynamic environment, with the music changing with various timings of different sound effects. Surround sound provided a more realistic and immersive gameplay experience. A major challenge in writing the music was that the score had to be flexible enough to match the non-linear gameplay events. [...] "Games are totally interactive experiences," [...] Larkin explained. [...] "You don't guide a player through, since you can't count on being at a certain place at a certain time. I can't write cue music to get the player to do this, this and then this. One player might hear the cue and run the other way!" [...] Larkin had to step away from what he had learned as a jazz composer and musician writing pieces with a definite beginning and end, instead creating music with [...] "less arc" [...] and structure. Larkin admitted that some Myst fans would have preferred a musical style similar to Robyn Miller's scores for Myst and Riven, but replied by saying that change happens and players would find something to like in the new music if they kept <b>an</b> <b>open</b> <b>mind.</b>|$|E
