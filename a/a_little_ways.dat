25|$|Though these faults {{have been}} traced for only <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>ways,</b> the {{southeast}} striking anticlines they {{are associated with}} continue as far as Riffe Lake, near Mossyrock. They are also on-strike with a swarm of faults on the Columbia River, bracketing The Dalles. As {{all of these are}} thrust and reverse faults, they probably result from northeast directed regional compression. These faults also cross the Saint Helens Zone (SHZ), a deep, north-northwest trending zone of seismicity that appears to be the contact between different crustal blocks. How they might be connected is unknown.|$|E
25|$|As {{their first}} task as warriors, Fireheart and Graystripe are {{assigned}} to find WindClan, which had been driven out by ShadowClan, and bring them home. They go to the WindClan camp and search for clues there. On the way, they see some RiverClan warriors hunting on WindClan territory. Graystripe finds the correct scent trail, and they follow it to a makeshift WindClan camp. Fireheart spots Barley's farm <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>ways</b> off the trail and the pair hurriedly leaves in fear of the dogs that live on the farm chasing them after they get let out.|$|E
6000|$|Ways for Way. [...] "A {{squirrel}} ran <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>ways</b> {{along the}} road." [...] "The ship looked {{a long ways}} off." [...] This surprising word calls loudly for depluralization.|$|E
60|$|They {{look at one}} another, and Tony goes {{listening}} to the door, and <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>way</b> upstairs, and <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>way</b> downstairs. Comes back and says it's all right and all quiet, and quotes the remark he lately made to Mr. Snagsby about their cooking chops at the Sol's Arms.|$|R
60|$|They {{had moved}} but <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>way</b> {{up the street}} when Thomas stopped.|$|R
60|$|So George turned round, {{and opened}} the door <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>way,</b> and peeped out.|$|R
60|$|But Tom said he {{had read}} about railroads in England going nearly a hundred miles an hour for <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>ways,</b> and {{there never was a}} bird in the world that could do that--except one, and that was a flea.|$|E

60|$|I {{went around}} and clumb {{over the back}} stile by the ash-hopper, {{and started for the}} kitchen. When I got <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>ways</b> I heard the dim hum of a spinning-wheel wailing along up and sinking along down again; and then I knowed for certain I wished I was dead--for that IS the lonesomest sound in the whole world.|$|E
60|$|Hans {{walked with}} them <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>way</b> and, leaving them outside the town, returned.|$|R
60|$|He {{came after}} me, wondering, <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>way</b> into the grove, where I stopped.|$|R
60|$|Lady Mary {{interrupted}} him suddenly from her place <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>way</b> down the table.|$|R
60|$|While {{tramping}} {{around in}} the neighborhood of Furnace Creek I happened upon an old almost obliterated trail. It led toward the ridges of clay, and when I had climbed it <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>ways</b> I began to get an impression that the slopes on the other side must run down into a basin or canyon. So I climbed to the top.|$|E
60|$|WE had {{an early}} {{breakfast in the}} morning, and set {{looking down on the}} desert, and the weather was ever so bammy and lovely, {{although}} we warn't high up. You have to come down lower and lower after sundown in the desert, because it cools off so fast; and so, by the time it is getting toward dawn, you are skimming along only <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>ways</b> above the sand.|$|E
6000|$|... "We're goin' {{away from}} home all the time this way," [...] said Toby, after he had studied the matter carefully, without paying any {{attention}} to the suggestion made by Leander; [...] "now let's get <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>ways</b> {{the other side of}} the tree, an' when he comes down again he'll have to go towards home. Even if we can't catch him, perhaps we can drive him into the village." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "No--he--can't. God himself can't {{wipe out}} what has been. O Mattie, if I was only there!--in the past--if I was only young and purty agin! You know how tall I was! how {{we used to}} run--O Mattie, if I was only there! The world was all bright then--wasn't it? We didn't expect--to work all our days. Life looked like a meadow, full of daisies and pinks, and the nicest ones and the sweetest birds was just <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>ways</b> on--where the sun was--it didn't look--wasn't we happy?" ...|$|E
60|$|WE slept most all day, {{and started}} out at night, <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>ways</b> behind a monstrous long raft {{that was as}} long going by as a procession. She had four long sweeps at each end, so we judged she carried as many as thirty men, likely. She had five big wigwams aboard, wide apart, and an open camp fire in the middle, and a tall flag-pole at each end. There was a power of style about her. It AMOUNTED to {{something}} being a raftsman on such a craft as that.|$|E
6000|$|His wife {{cast the}} light of her lantern about, and found the shoes by the piazza-steps, and as Northwick {{appeared}} no more able to move than to speak, Elbridge stooped down, and put on his shoes for him where he stood. When he lifted himself, he stared again at Northwick, {{as if to make}} perfectly sure of him, and then he said, with a sigh of perplexity, [...] "You go ahead, <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>ways,</b> 'Lectra, with the lantern. I presume we've got to take him to 'em," [...] and his wife, usually voluble and wilful, silently obeyed.|$|E
6000|$|... "I shall wait in my bedroom--just as I did before. I shall {{keep the}} door <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>way</b> open. It was <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>way</b> open last year. I will watch the sitting-room door; {{and the moment}} it moves, I will blow out my light. It all {{happened}} in that way, on my birthday night. And it must all happen again in the same way, musn't it?" ...|$|R

6000|$|... "But {{this fellow}} wasn't fightin'," [...] Carrots replied in a {{positive}} tone. [...] "I was only <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>ways</b> off when Skip Jellison come up, hit him a clip, an' knocked his papers out er his hands. What kind of a duffer would he be if he hadn't tried to square things? The only trouble is, he didn't {{have a chance to}} do any fightin' before that crooked-nosed park guard got hold of him. Say, it don't seem to me jest right that a reg'lar policeman should help that gray thing along in the way he's actin'." ...|$|E
60|$|It was one {{of these}} long, slanting, two-mile crossings; so I was a good long time in getting over. I made a safe landing, and clumb up the bank. I couldn't see but <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>ways,</b> but I went poking along over rough ground for {{a quarter of a mile}} or more, and then I run across a big old-fashioned double log-house before I noticed it. I was going to rush by and get away, but a lot of dogs jumped out and went to howling and barking at me, and I knowed better than to move another peg.|$|E
60|$|I took up {{the river}} road as hard as I could put. By and by I begin to hear guns a good ways off. When I cOme in sight of the log store and the woodpile where the steamboats lands I worked along under the trees and brush till I got to a good place, and then I clumb up into the forks of a cottonwood {{that was out of}} reach, and watched. There was a wood-rank four foot high <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>ways</b> in front of the tree, and first I was going to hide behind that; but maybe it was luckier I didn't.|$|E
60|$|They {{walked for}} <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>way</b> in silence. Then {{she spoke to}} him in an altered tone.|$|R

60|$|In silence they paced on <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>way</b> {{into the}} green shade. Then she paused and faced him.|$|R
6000|$|... "Wai, {{if we get}} to {{this rock}} I spoke 'bout, we'll be right over 'em. It's ten feet high, an' we can jump {{straight}} amongst 'em. Most likely two or three'll be guardin' the openin' which is <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>ways</b> to the right. Ther's a big tree, the only one, low down by the spring. Helen's under it, half-sittin', half-leanin' against the roots. When I first looked, her hands were free; but I saw Brandt bind her feet. An' {{he had to get}} an Injun to help him, fer she kicked like a spirited little filly. There's moss under the tree an' there's where the redskins'll lay down to rest." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Now we're in Nail Canyon proper," [...] said Stewart; [...] "An' I know my bearin's. I {{can climb}} out a mile below an' cut across to Kanab Canyon, an' slip up into Nail Canyon agin, {{ahead of the}} mustangs, an' drive 'em up. I can't miss 'em, fer Kanab Canyon is impassable down <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>ways.</b> The mustangs will hev to run this way. So all you need do is go below the break, where I climb out, an' wait. You're sure goin' {{to get a look}} at the White Mustang. But wait. Don't expect him before noon, an' after thet, any time till he comes. Mebbe it'll be a couple of days, so keep a good watch." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Couldn't repent beforehand!" [...] {{retorted}} Deacon Latham. [...] "And I tell you, Maria, I {{never saw}} a much finer man than Captain Jenness; and the cabin's everything I said it was, and more. Lyddy reg'larly went off over it; 'n' I guess, as Mr. Goodlow says, she'll influence 'em for good. Don't you fret about her clothes any. You fitted her out in apple-pie order, and she'll soon be there. 'T ain't but <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>ways</b> to Try-East, any way, {{to what it is}} some of them India voyages, Captain Jenness said. He had his own daughters out the last voyage; 'n' I guess he can tell Lyddy when it's weather to wear her silk. I d'know as I'd better said anything about what I was thinkin'. I don't want to be noways rash, and yet I thought I couldn't be too partic'lar." ...|$|E
