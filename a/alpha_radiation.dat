5|$|Natural thorium decays {{very slowly}} {{compared}} {{to many other}} radioactive materials, and the emitted <b>alpha</b> <b>radiation</b> cannot penetrate human skin. As a result, handling small amounts of thorium, {{such as those in}} gas mantles, is considered safe, although the use of such items may pose some risks. Exposure to an aerosol of thorium, such as contaminated dust, can lead to increased risk of cancers of the lung, pancreas, and blood, as lungs and other internal organs can be penetrated by <b>alpha</b> <b>radiation.</b> Exposure to thorium internally leads to increased risk of liver diseases.|$|E

5|$|About twenty {{isotopes}} and six {{nuclear isomers}} (excited states of an isotope) of berkelium have been characterized with the mass numbers ranging from 235 to 254. All {{of them are}} radioactive. The longest half-lives are observed for 247Bk (1,380years), 248Bk (over300years) and 249Bk (330days); the half-lives of the other isotopes range from microseconds to several days. The isotope which is the easiest to synthesize is berkelium-249. This emits mostly soft β-particles which are inconvenient for detection. Its <b>alpha</b> <b>radiation</b> is rather weak – 1.45% {{with respect to the}} β-radiation – but is sometimes used to detect this isotope. The second important berkelium isotope, berkelium-247, is an alpha-emitter, as are most actinide isotopes.|$|E
50|$|The types R of {{ionizing}} radiation most considered in RBE evaluation are X-rays and gamma radiation (both consisting of photons), <b>alpha</b> <b>radiations</b> (helium-4 nuclei), beta radiation (electrons and positrons), neutron radiation, and heavy nuclei, including {{the fragments of}} nuclear fission. For some kinds of radiation, the RBE {{is strongly dependent on}} the energy of the individual particles.|$|R

Any specific design of suit may offer protection against {{biological and chemical}} agents, particle <b>radiation</b> (<b>alpha)</b> and/or <b>radiation</b> (delta and gamma), and may offer flash protection {{in the case of}} bomb disposal suits.

5000|$|The towers {{also contain}} {{generators}} and projectors for <b>Alpha's</b> <b>radiation</b> and meteorite defence screens. In the episode [...] "Black Sun", Victor Bergman formulated {{a way to}} increase {{the power of the}} anti-gravity generators in the towers to produce an enhanced anti-gravity forcefield effect. The drawback of the Bergman forcefield is that it requires more energy than the four main generators are designed to produce; the generators from the entire Eagle fleet are required to supplement the power supply in order to sustain it for any length of time.|$|R
5|$|During {{the decay}} of plutonium, three types of {{radiation}} are released—alpha, beta, and gamma. Alpha, beta, and gamma radiation are all forms of ionizing radiation. Either acute or longer-term exposure carries a danger of serious health outcomes including radiation sickness, genetic damage, cancer, and death. The danger increases {{with the amount of}} exposure. <b>Alpha</b> <b>radiation</b> can travel only a short distance and cannot travel through the outer, dead layer of human skin. Beta radiation can penetrate human skin, but cannot go {{all the way through the}} body. Gamma radiation can go all the way through the body.|$|E
5|$|Even though <b>alpha</b> <b>radiation</b> cannot {{penetrate}} the skin, ingested or inhaled plutonium does irradiate internal organs. Alpha particles generated by inhaled plutonium {{have been found}} to cause lung cancer in a cohort of European nuclear workers. The skeleton, where plutonium accumulates, and the liver, where it collects and becomes concentrated, are at risk. Plutonium is not absorbed into the body efficiently when ingested; only 0.04% of plutonium oxide is absorbed after ingestion. Plutonium absorbed by the body is excreted very slowly, with a biological half-life of 200 years. Plutonium passes only slowly through cell membranes and intestinal boundaries, so absorption by ingestion and incorporation into bone structure proceeds very slowly.|$|E
5|$|Forgeries {{in which}} modern lead or white lead pigment {{has been used}} can be {{recognized}} by using a technique called Pb(Lead)-210-Dating. Pb-210 is a naturally occurring radioactive isotope of lead {{that is part of}} the uranium-238 Radioactive decay series, and has a half-life of 22.3 years. To determine the amount of Pb-210, the <b>alpha</b> <b>radiation</b> emitted by another element, polonium-210 (Po-210), is measured. Thus it is possible to estimate the age of a painting, within a few years' span, by extrapolating the Pb-210 content present in the paint used to create the painting.|$|E

50|$|A related {{phenomenon}} is {{the formation of}} pleochroic halos surrounding minute zircon inclusions within a crystal of biotite or other mineral.

5|$|Fourteen {{isotopes}} of berkelium {{were identified}} with mass numbers 238–252. Only 249Bk {{is available in}} large quantities; it has a relatively short half-life of 330 days and emits mostly soft β-particles, which are inconvenient for detection. Its <b>alpha</b> <b>radiation</b> is rather weak (1.45% with respect to β-radiation), but is sometimes used to detect this isotope. 247Bk is an alpha-emitter with a long half-life of 1,380 years, {{but it is hard}} to obtain in appreciable quantities; it is not formed upon neutron irradiation of plutonium because of the β-stability of isotopes of curium isotopes with mass number below 248.|$|E
5|$|In {{accordance}} with magnetic data, electrical resistivity of curium increases with temperature – about twice between 4 and 60 K – and then remains nearly constant up to room temperature. There {{is a significant}} increase in resistivity over time (about 10 µΩ·cm/h) due to self-damage of the crystal lattice by <b>alpha</b> <b>radiation.</b> This makes uncertain the absolute resistivity value for curium (about 125 µΩ·cm). The resistivity of curium {{is similar to that of}} gadolinium and of the actinides plutonium and neptunium, but is significantly higher than that of americium, uranium, polonium and thorium.|$|E
5|$|A {{percentage}} {{of each group}} working in less contaminated areas was badged. Eventually, 18,875 film-badge dosimeters were issued to about 15% of the total work force. On {{the basis of this}} sampling, a theoretical total exposure was calculated for each person who did not have a personal badge. As expected, exposures for target ship crewmen who reboarded their ships after Baker were higher than those for support ship crews. The hulls of support ships that entered the lagoon after Baker became so radioactive that sleeping quarters were moved toward the center of each ship. Of the total mass of radioactive particles scattered by each explosion, 85% was unfissioned plutonium which produces <b>alpha</b> <b>radiation</b> not detected by film badges or Geiger counters. There was no method of detecting plutonium in a timely fashion, and participants were not monitored for ingestion of it.|$|E
50|$|The picture {{shows how}} the {{stopping}} power of 5.49 MeV alpha particles increases while the particle traverses air, until it reaches the maximum. This particular energy corresponds {{to that of the}} <b>alpha</b> particle <b>radiation</b> from naturally radioactive gas radon (222Rn) which is present in the air in minute amounts.|$|R
40|$|The alpha-risk study {{required}} {{the reconstruction of}} doses to lung and red bone marrow for lung cancer and leukaemia cases and their matched controls from cohorts of nuclear workers in the UK, France and Belgium. The dosimetrists and epidemiologists agreed requirements regarding the bioassay data, biokinetic and dosimetric models and dose assessment software to be used and doses to be reported. The best values to use for uncertainties on the monitoring data, setting of exposure regimes and characteristics of the exposure material, including lung solubility, were {{the responsibility of the}} dosimetrist responsible for each cohort. Among 1721 subjects, the median absorbed dose to the lung from <b>alpha</b> <b>radiations</b> was 2. 1 mGy, with a maximum dose of 316 mGy.

40|$|This {{instrument}} {{is designed for}} the detection and measurement {{of a group of}} ionizing radiations. Interchangeable ionization chambers have been constructed for the measurement of (1) beta and gamma radiations, (2) surface and hand monitoring of <b>alpha</b> <b>radiations,</b> (3) <b>alpha</b> and beta <b>radiation</b> of dust samples collected in precipitron tubes, and (4) fast neutrons. Moderate to high radiation intensities are measured by direct continuous deflection of a microammeter indicating changes in plate current of a 1 LN 5 tube used as an electrometer tube. Low intensities of radiation are measured by allowing the charge due to the ionization current to collect on one plate of a condenser. The other plate connects to the grid of the electrometer tube and to ground through a high resistance. During the period of charge collection the two condenser plates are electrically shielded from one another by a grounded metal vane inserted between them. On removing this vane the charge on the first plate of the condenser is communicated to the second plate and thus to the tube grid. A transient meter deflection then occurs proportional to the product of ionization current and ion collection time. A two pole, triple throw switch allows the output meter to be connected in test 1 position to measure screen grid current, in test 2 position to set tube voltages to reproducible values, and in "Operate" position to measure changes in plate current.

5|$|The {{chemistry}} of polonium {{is similar to}} that of tellurium, although it also shows some similarities to its neighbor bismuth due to its metallic character. Polonium dissolves readily in dilute acids but is only slightly soluble in alkalis. Polonium solutions are first colored in pink by the Po2+ ions, but then rapidly become yellow because <b>alpha</b> <b>radiation</b> from polonium ionizes the solvent and converts Po2+ into Po4+. This process is accompanied by bubbling and emission of heat and light by glassware due to the absorbed alpha particles; as a result, polonium solutions are volatile and will evaporate within days unless sealed. At pH about 1, polonium ions are readily hydrolyzed and complexed by acids such as oxalic acid, citric acid, and tartaric acid.|$|E
5|$|Tiny {{amounts of}} 210Po are {{sometimes}} {{used in the}} laboratory and for teaching purposes—typically {{of the order of}} , in the form of sealed sources, with the polonium deposited on a substrate or in a resin or polymer matrix—are often exempt from licensing by the NRC and similar authorities as they are not considered hazardous. Small amounts of 210Po are manufactured for sale to the public in the United States as 'needle sources' for laboratory experimentation, and they are retailed by scientific supply companies. The polonium is a layer of plating which in turn is plated with a material such as gold, which allows the <b>alpha</b> <b>radiation</b> (used in experiments such as cloud chambers) to pass while preventing the polonium from being released and presenting a toxic hazard.

The BBC reported that by coincidence another scientist, who had worked on Britain's early atomic bomb programme decades before, happened to overhear a discussion about the small spike and recognised it as the gamma ray signal from polonium-210, which was a critical component of early nuclear bombs. On the evening of 22 November, shortly before his death, his doctors were informed the poison was likely to be polonium-210.
