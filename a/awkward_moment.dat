While working late, Peggy discovers Dawn sleeping in Don's office.

Peggy and Dawn drink beers at Peggy's apartment, while Peggy reveals insecurity over whether she [...] "acts like a man" [...] or not.

Swift narrates the story while {{standing}} between two bookshelves, sitting on a desk and lying across a table (and occasionally lying on top of [...] "The Story of Us") {{with a stack of}} books next to her, as we see scenes flashing back and forth between her and her ex-boyfriend, students in the library, some library staff, and her band playing the song. The scenes between her and her ex start with a private meeting between the two in the library, scenes where she is finding a place by herself without him in the library, to the awkward scene of finding him across the room from her. Swift hides behind a book she's holding when she notices her ex, then looks away pulling on her clothes and plays with her hair, in the attempt of not making him notice her. She doesn't notice that he noticed her too, later in the video, and was trying to avoid her too. They both eventually catch each other looking and they awkwardly try to give each other a silent and distant [...] "Hi" [...] as the video cuts to a scene where we see a girl who first pulls Swift's ex into a make out, then pulls away as the librarian passes by. When the librarian passes, Swift's ex pulls the girl back and kisses her again. This cheating caused the fall out between Swift and the guy. Swift eventually gives the first [...] "Hi" [...] which he returns and both get up to confront the other.
