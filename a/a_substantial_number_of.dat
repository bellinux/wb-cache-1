5|$|Boult's {{recordings}} {{fall into}} three main periods. In the first, from 1920 {{to the end}} of the 1940s, he recorded almost exclusively for HMV.

His last period, from the mid-1960s, sometimes referred to as his Indian Summer, was once again with HMV. With his regular collaborators the producer Christopher Bishop and the engineer Christopher Parker he made more than sixty recordings, re-recording much of his key repertoire in stereo.

5|$|Henry had a {{considerable}} sexual appetite and enjoyed <b>a</b> <b>substantial</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> sexual partners, {{resulting in a}} large number of illegitimate children, at least nine sons and 13 daughters, many of whom he appears to have recognised and supported. It was normal for unmarried Anglo-Norman noblemen to have sexual relations with prostitutes and local women, and kings were also expected to have mistresses. Some of these relationships occurred before Henry was married, but many others took place after his marriage to Matilda. Henry had a wide range of mistresses from a range of backgrounds, and the relationships appear to have been conducted relatively openly. He may have chosen some of his noble mistresses for political purposes, but the evidence to support this theory is limited.|$|E

After the successful implementation of somatostatin receptor scintigraphy in daily clinical practice, {{the next logical step}} was to increase the radiation dose of the administered radiolabelled somatostatin analogue in an attempt to induce tumour shrinkage. Since then, an increasing <b>number</b> <b>of</b> patients has been successfully treated with this approach, resulting in <b>a</b> <b>substantial</b> <b>numbers</b> <b>of</b> patient with objective tumour shrinkage.

Finally, important directions for future research are briefly mentioned to illustrate that, although the currently available results already suggest a favourable outcome compared with other systemic therapies, new strategies are being developed to increase efficacy...|$|R

In mammals, HSF 1 is required for heat-mediated induction of classic heat shock genes; however, {{we do not know}} the molecular mechanisms by which HSF 4 regulates gene expression or the biological consequences of its binding to chromatin. Here, we identified that HSF 4 binds to various genomic regions, including the introns and distal parts of protein-coding genes in vivo in mouse lenses, and <b>a</b> <b>substantial</b> <b>numbers</b> <b>of</b> the regions were also occupied by HSF 1 and HSF 2. HSF 4 regulated expression of some genes at a developmental stage when HSF 1 and HSF 2 expression decreased. Although HSF 4 binding did not affect expression of many genes, it induces demethylated status of histone H 3 K 9 on the binding regions. Unexpectedly, a lot of HSF 4 targets were induced by heat shock treatment, and HSF 4 is required for induction of a set of non-classic heat shock genes in response to heat shock, in part by facilitating HSF 1 binding through chromatin modification. These results suggest novel mechanisms of gene regulation controlled by HSF 4 in non-classic heat shock response and in lens development...|$|R

A recommendation arising from the study is that all professional social workers in Jordan need to formulate a national social workers code of ethics as a guide for practice. The code of ethics would have general ethical principles that are based on the core values of social work to be used as a guide for professional behaviour...|$|R
