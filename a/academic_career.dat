40|$|Purpose – Studying <b>academic</b> <b>careers</b> can be {{particularly}} useful for discussions about new forms of professional careers. This conceptual paper seeks {{to shed light on}} <b>academic</b> <b>careers</b> by discussing the (changing) multiple contexts governing <b>academic</b> <b>careers.</b> Design/methodology/approach – A neo-institutional framework for analysing <b>academic</b> <b>careers</b> is developed that treats them as outcomes of overlapping institutions belonging to the different social contexts in which academics simultaneously act. This approach allows one to locate <b>academic</b> <b>careers</b> in the context of new and traditional career literature and to address changes in the institutional context of <b>academic</b> <b>careers.</b> Findings – Shows how traditional structures and mechanisms of <b>academic</b> <b>careers</b> are interwoven with the overall patterns of national higher education systems and their societal embeddedness. Empirical evidence was found that <b>academic</b> <b>careers</b> are becoming more boundaryless. But evidence was also found that <b>academic</b> <b>careers</b> are more bound to the organisation due to recent changes in university policies and practices. Research limitations/implications – The paper is limited to the discussion of overlapping institutional contexts governing <b>academic</b> <b>careers.</b> Further international comparisons could deepen understanding of specific formal and informal rules. Future macro-micro research enables one to show how the career models {{can be traced to the}} career experiences and practices. Micro-macro research allows one to see how the aggregate outcomes of individual actions can be traced to the overall performance of a given higher education system. Originality/value – This conceptual paper proposes a neo-institutional framework for analysing <b>academic</b> <b>careers.</b> This approach is useful for cross-national comparisons, the study of emerging new career models and practices in academe, and the study of macro-micro-links in career research...|$|R

5|$|In {{the early}} 1930s Tolkien was {{pursuing}} an <b>academic</b> <b>career</b> at Oxford as Rawlinson and Bosworth Professor of Anglo-Saxon, with a fellowship at Pembroke College. Several of his poems {{had been published}} in magazines and small collections, including Goblin Feet and , a reworking of the nursery rhyme Hey Diddle Diddle. His creative endeavours at this time also included letters from Father Christmas to his children—illustrated manuscripts that featured warring gnomes and goblins, and a helpful polar bear—alongside the creation of elven languages and an attendant mythology, {{which he had been}} creating since 1917. These works all saw posthumous publication.|$|E
5|$|An <b>academic</b> <b>career</b> {{required}} a doctorate, so in 1921 Urey {{enrolled in a}} PhD program at the University of California, Berkeley, where he studied thermodynamics under Gilbert N. Lewis. His initial attempt at a thesis was on the ionization of cesium vapor. He ran into difficulties, and an Indian physicist published a better paper on the same subject. Urey then wrote his thesis on the ionization states of an ideal gas, which was subsequently published in the Astrophysical Journal. After he received his PhD in 1923, Urey was awarded a fellowship by the American-Scandinavian Foundation to study at the Niels Bohr Institute in Copenhagen, where he met Werner Heisenberg, Hans Kramers, Wolfgang Pauli, Georg von Hevesy, and John Slater. At the conclusion of his stay, he traveled to Germany, where he met Albert Einstein and James Franck.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, I {{focus upon}} {{doctoral}} education and <b>academic</b> <b>careers</b> {{among women in}} scientific fields. Scientific fields encompass the eight classifications of the National Science Foundation and the National Research Council: physical, mathematical, computer, environmental, life, and engineering, {{as well as the}} psychological and social sciences. I concentrate upon doctoral education because of its direct connection with <b>academic</b> <b>careers.</b> <b>Academic</b> <b>careers,</b> in turn, are important for two reasons. First, issues of scientific research and its impact are particularly applicable for this group. Second and relatedly, the training of university students–and in turn, much of the future of science–are in the hands academic scientists. Women, doctoral education, and <b>academic</b> <b>careers</b> Over the past three decades, the numbers and proportions of women receiving doctoral degrees in scientific fields have increased. The proportion of women among the doctoral recipients in scientific fields increased from 8 percent to 15 percent between the decade of the 1960 s and 1970 s; by the decade of 1980 s, women were earning 26 percent; and in the 1990 s, 31 %, of doctoral degrees in these fields (CPST, 2000 : Table 2 - 1) ...|$|R

5|$|As a child, Marmaduke was academically {{gifted and}} also a keen boxer and long-distance swimmer. He also took a keen {{interest}} in mechanical things, particularly combustion engines, and was building Meccano models of aircraft and other vehicles by the age of 12. In his early teens, he became an avid amateur mechanic, fixing the family motor car and learning to drive. Marmaduke was never a hard worker and did not embark upon an <b>academic</b> <b>career,</b> but was considered to possess above average intelligence. In 1929, he passed the Junior Certificate Exam with first class honours. The certificate qualified him for Victoria Boy's High School from which he graduated in 1931.|$|E
5|$|As an {{academic}} {{he was a}} professor of history at the Royal Frederick University (now the University of Oslo) from 1910 to 1935, having become a research fellow in 1900 and docent in 1908. Among many honors, he held an honorary degree at the University of Oxford. He was a prolific writer, and touched on numerous subjects during his long <b>academic</b> <b>career.</b> He wrote several biographies; his works on Johan Sverdrup and Henrik Ibsen spanned several volumes each. He became known for syntheses on Norwegian history, and emphasised the roles of peasants and wage labourers as historical agents who found their place in an expanding notion of the Norwegian nation. He was also interested in the United States and its history, and was a pioneer in Norway in this respect.|$|E
5|$|Born in {{the north}} of Norway to a fairly {{distinguished}} family, he soon became interested in politics and history. Starting his political career in the Liberal Party, he switched to the Labour Party {{around the turn of the}} 20th century. He represented that party in the Bærum municipal council for parts of the interwar period. He was never elected a member of Parliament, but served nonetheless as Norwegian Minister of Foreign Affairs from 1935 to 1941. In the latter capacity he sought to preserve Norway's neutrality in the Second World War, an action that garnered him political infamy. Growing discontentment with Koht's political decisions ultimately led to his exit from the cabinet. After the war, however, he returned to an <b>academic</b> <b>career</b> track and wrote major works in the 1950s and 1960s.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the implications for}} <b>academic</b> <b>careers</b> of the apparent global trend towards marketisation and managerialism in higher education {{with reference to the}} UK and Germany. It discusses how university employers might exercise greater control over their employees, privileging research and international publication, and fragmenting the traditional unity of the academic role. The effect is to challenge the values of academic communities, subject individuals to greater uncertainty, competition and insecurity, and influence the shape and direction of <b>academic</b> <b>careers.</b> The paper notes how todays <b>academic</b> <b>careers</b> could be understood in terms of Kanters three forms of career as well as the boundaryless and protean career. However, it argues that these approaches do not address the key issue in both the UK and German cases: the changed locus and exercise of power within the employment relationship. It concludes that, to understand how careers are changing, this power relationship and the context of career in general have to be taken into account...|$|R

Because of his work duties, it was only in July 1888 that he began to excavate caves in Sumatra. Having quickly found abundant fossils of large mammals, Dubois was relieved of his military duties (March 1889), and the colonial government assigned two engineers and fifty convicts to help him with his excavations. After he failed to find the fossils he was looking for on Sumatra, he moved on to Java in 1890.|$|E
