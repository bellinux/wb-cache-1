5|$|Earlier travels had exposed Géricault {{to victims}} of {{insanity}} and plague, and while researching the Méduse his effort to be historically accurate and realistic led to an obsession with the stiffness of corpses. To achieve the most authentic rendering of the flesh tones of the dead, he made sketches of bodies in the morgue of the Hospital Beaujon, studied the faces of dying hospital patients, brought severed limbs back to his studio to study their decay, and for a fortnight drew a severed head, borrowed from <b>a</b> <b>lunatic</b> asylum and stored on his studio roof.|$|E
5|$|In a {{telephone}} interview with Today's Zaman, in 2009, Finkelstein stated:I think Israel, {{as a number of}} commentators pointed out, is becoming an insane state. And we have to be honest about that. While {{the rest of the world}} wants peace, Europe wants peace, the US wants peace, but this state wants war, war and war. In the first week of the massacres, there were reports in the Israeli press that Israel did not want to put all its ground forces in Gaza because it was preparing attacks on Iran. Then there were reports it was planning attacks on Lebanon. It is <b>a</b> <b>lunatic</b> state.|$|E
5000|$|A young Malcolm X {{described}} the zoot suit as: [...] "a killer-diller coat with a drape shape, reet pleats and shoulders padded like <b>a</b> <b>lunatic's</b> cell". Zoot suits usually featured a watch chain {{dangling from the}} belt to the knee or below, then back to a side pocket. Zoot suit wearers' dates often wore flared skirts and long coats.|$|R

5|$|Later on, {{the priest}} tells Chen to visit <b>a</b> <b>lunatic</b> beggar at the marketplace, should she wish to revive her husband. The madman treats her with disrespect by {{continuously}} demeaning her, but {{she takes it}} in her stride and patiently pleads with him for help. Finally, he coughs out some phlegm and makes her swallow it. The beggar makes his leave and Chen is left feeling deeply ashamed. Back home, during funeral preparations, the phlegm hardens gradually and rises from Chen's stomach to her throat. Ultimately she disgorges a throbbing heart, which she places into the gaping wound in Wang's chest; slowly, his life is restored.|$|E
5|$|Carr Hill House was {{the largest}} estate in the village; a {{freehold}} mansion house on Carr Hill Lane. The date of building is unknown, {{but it does not}} appear on an enclosure map of 1766, suggesting it was built after that date. There is strong evidence that it was once <b>a</b> <b>lunatic</b> asylum; in 1770 an advertisement in a local newspaper declared:LUNATICKSCarr's Hill House on Gateshead Fell To The Public We beg Leave to inform the Public that we have opened the above HOUSE pleasantly situated about a mile distant from Newcastle, which we have fitted up in an elegant manner, with every Accommodation for the reception of LUNATICKS in genteel or opulent circumstances: in this House Persons entrusted to our Care shall be treated with the utmost Attention and Humanity. The terms are reasonable. R. Lambert, W. Keenlyside, H Gibson, R. Stoddard (surgeons to the Infirmary), Newcastle 1767.|$|E
5|$|Following this incident, Tarrare {{was desperate}} to avoid further {{military}} service, {{and returned to the}} hospital, telling Percy that he would attempt any possible cure for his appetite. Percy treated him with laudanum without success; further treatments with wine vinegar and tobacco pills were likewise unsuccessful. Following these failures, Percy fed Tarrare large quantities of soft-boiled eggs, but this also failed to suppress his appetite. Efforts to keep him on any kind of controlled diet failed; he would sneak out of the hospital to scavenge for offal outside butchers' shops and to fight stray dogs for carrion in gutters, alleys and rubbish heaps. He was also caught several times within the hospital drinking from patients undergoing bloodletting, and attempting to eat the bodies in the hospital mortuary. Other doctors believed that Tarrare was mentally ill and pressed for him to be transferred to <b>a</b> <b>lunatic</b> asylum, but Percy was keen to continue his experiments and Tarrare remained in the military hospital.|$|E

25|$|The {{restoration}} of Imperial Russian and Ottoman authority shortly afterwards drove him into exile. He took refuge to Paris, and endeavoured to influence French opinion {{in favor of}} the proposed union and autonomy of the Romanian Danubian Principalities. In 1854, however, he was sentenced to a fine and three months' imprisonment for sedition, and later confined in <b>a</b> <b>lunatic</b> asylum; in 1856, he returned to Wallachia with his brother - afterwards one of his foremost political opponents.|$|E
25|$|The {{marriage}} was markedly unhappy, {{in part because}} of Vivienne's health issues. In a letter addressed to Ezra Pound, she covers an extensive list of her symptoms, which included a habitually high temperature, fatigue, insomnia, migraines, and colitis. This, coupled with apparent mental instability, meant that she was often sent away by Eliot and her doctors for extended periods of time in the hope of improving her health, and as time went on, he became increasingly detached from her. The couple formally separated in 1933 and in 1938 Vivienne's brother, Maurice, had her committed to <b>a</b> <b>lunatic</b> asylum, against her will, where she remained until her death of heart disease in 1947. Their relationship became the subject of a 1984 play Tom & Viv, which in 1994 was adapted as a film.|$|E

25|$|Among {{theories}} {{advanced to}} account for the reddish sky in the background is the artist's memory {{of the effects of the}} powerful volcanic eruption of Krakatoa, which deeply tinted sunset skies red in parts of the Western hemisphere for months during 1883 and 1884, about a decade before Munch painted The Scream. This explanation has been disputed by scholars, who note that Munch was an expressive painter and was not primarily interested in literal renderings of what he had seen. Alternatively, it has been suggested that the proximity of both a slaughterhouse and <b>a</b> <b>lunatic</b> asylum to the site depicted in the painting may have offered some inspiration. The scene was identified as being the view from a road overlooking Oslo, the Oslofjord and Hovedøya, from the hill of Ekeberg. At the time of painting the work, Munch's manic depressive sister Laura Catherine was a patient at the asylum at the foot of Ekeberg.|$|E
25|$|Other {{images of}} despair and madness fill the scene: <b>a</b> <b>lunatic</b> cavorts {{in the street}} beating himself {{over the head with}} a pair of bellows while holding a baby impaled on a spike—the dead child's frantic mother rushes from the house {{screaming}} in horror; a barber has taken his own life in the dilapidated attic of his barber-shop, ruined because nobody can afford a haircut or shave; on the steps, below the woman who has let her baby fall, a skeletal pamphlet-seller rests, perhaps dead of starvation, as the unsold moralising pamphlet on the evils of gin-drinking, The Downfall of Mrs Gin, slips from his basket. An ex-soldier, he has pawned most of his clothes to buy the gin in his basket, next to the pamphlet that denounces it. Next to him sits a black dog, a symbol of despair and depression. Outside the distiller a fight has broken out, and a crazed cripple raises his crutch to strike his blind compatriot.|$|E
