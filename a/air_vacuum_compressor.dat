5000|$|Every {{pneumatic}} system {{makes use of}} pipes or ducts called transportation lines that carry a mixture of materials and a stream of air. These materials are such as dry pulverized or free flowing or light powdery materials like cement, fly ash etc. These materials can be transported conveniently to various destinations {{by means of a}} stream of high velocity air through pipe lines.Products are moved through various tubes via air pressure, allowing for extra vertical versatility. Pneumatic conveyors are either carrier systems or dilute-phase systems; carrier systems simply push items from one entry point to one exit point, such as the money-exchanging pneumatic tubes used at a bank drive-through window. Dilute-phase systems use push-pull pressure to guide materials through various entry and/or exit points. It {{is important to note that}} either <b>air</b> <b>compressors,</b> <b>vacuums,</b> or blowers can be used to generate the air flow.

50|$|Vacuum bag {{moulding}} uses a flexible film to enclose the part and seal it from outside <b>air.</b> <b>Vacuum</b> bag material {{is available in}} a tube shape or a sheet of material. A vacuum is then drawn on the vacuum bag and atmospheric pressure compresses the part during the cure. When a tube shaped bag is used, the entire part can be enclosed within the bag. When using sheet bagging materials, {{the edges of the}} vacuum bag are sealed against the edges of the mould surface to enclose the part against an air-tight mould. When bagged in this way, the lower mold is a rigid structure and the upper surface of the part is formed by the flexible membrane vacuum bag. The flexible membrane can be a reusable silicone material or an extruded polymer film. After sealing the part inside the vacuum bag, a vacuum is drawn on the part (and held) during cure. This process can be performed at either ambient or elevated temperature with ambient atmospheric pressure acting upon the vacuum bag. A vacuum pump is typically used to draw a vacuum. An economical method of drawing a vacuum is with a venturi <b>vacuum</b> and <b>air</b> <b>compressor.</b>|$|R
