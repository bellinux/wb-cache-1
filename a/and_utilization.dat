The mushroom contains nicotianamine, an ACE inhibitor (angiotensin-converting enzyme). Nicotianamine is a metal-chelating compound essential in iron metabolism <b>and</b> <b>utilization</b> in plants. Several sterols have been isolated from the fruit bodies, 5α,6α-epoxy-3β-hydroxy-(22E)-ergosta-8(14),22-dien-7-one, ergosterol peroxide, cerevisterol, and 9α-hydroxycerevisterol, in addition to the previously unknown ceramide (2S,2R,3R,4E,8E)-N-2'-hydroxyoctadecanoyl-2-amino-9-methyl-4,8-heptade-cadiene-1,3-diol.|$|E
5|$|The case {{originated}} at Winkler County Memorial Hospital (WCMH), a 15-bed {{hospital in}} Kermit, Texas. Mitchell and Galle were registered nurses at WCMH.

Galle was an administrator over quality improvement <b>and</b> <b>utilization</b> management for the hospital, while Mitchell served as its compliance officer. Galle and Mitchell also served as medical staff co-coordinators at WCMH. Mitchell held a part-time role as the county's emergency management coordinator.

40|$|In this thesis, {{reconfiguration}} {{schemes for}} multipipeline structures and rectangular arrays are analyzed for their yield <b>and</b> area <b>utilization,</b> <b>and</b> a new reconfiguration scheme is proposed for these structures. Schemes for rectangular arrays are classified {{on the basis}} of locality of spares within the array. A methodology is developed to analyze the yield <b>and</b> area <b>utilization</b> of reconfiguration schemes in each class. Analytical solutions are obtained for yield <b>and</b> area <b>utilization</b> of representative schemes from each class, and schemes are compared for their optimal area utilization. The effect of the size of interconnect area on yield <b>and</b> area <b>utilization</b> is analyzed. The analysis shows that the yield <b>and</b> area <b>utilization</b> decreases very sharply with the size of the interconnection network. A new reconfiguration scheme for multipipeline structures and rectangular arrays is presented, in which spare PEs are added to every column of the array, and the array is reconfigured using on-chip distributed logic by bypassing faulty PEs within each column. PEs are tested locally using near-neighbor comparisons, and scan paths are used to enhance the testability of the array. Interconnections between logical neighbors are short, and the speed penalty for reconfiguration is small. The topology of the scheme and design of reconfiguration switches are independent of array size and amount of redundancy. The design and implementation of the reconfiguration switches are presented. and logical properties of the network are studied. The scheme is analyzed for its yield <b>and</b> area <b>utilization,</b> <b>and</b> results are compared with other schemes. The analysis shows that even though the switches for the proposed scheme are very simple, the logical reconfigurability of the scheme is comparable to other schemes, and therefore, the scheme will provide better yield <b>and</b> area <b>utilization</b> than most of the other schemes for multipipeline structures and rectangular arrays...|$|R
