60|$|This puzzled {{me for a}} moment, but {{presently}} I {{began to}} think that the two might begin quarrelling again, and said so. Nick laughed and put his <b>arm</b> <b>around</b> <b>my</b> neck.|$|E
6000|$|... "This Hugh Roger Littlepage," [...] cried Patt, {{throwing}} an <b>arm</b> <b>around</b> <b>my</b> neck; [...] "not that Hugh Roger Littlepage. Do but add that, dearest uncle, and I will {{kiss you}} for an hour." ...|$|E
60|$|Minnie flung her <b>arms</b> <b>around</b> <b>my</b> neck, {{and kissed}} me over and over again.|$|R
60|$|She {{concluded}} with her <b>arms</b> <b>around</b> <b>my</b> neck, her face upturned to mine and temptingly close, her eyes greatly solemn and greatly promising.|$|R
6000|$|... "Why, in {{that case}} we would all fall together," [...] {{returned}} the Ork. [...] "Get aboard, little girl; sit across my shoulders and put both your <b>arms</b> <b>around</b> <b>my</b> neck." ...|$|R
60|$|But my admonition was {{obviously}} unnecessary. The beautiful Leah showed {{not the slightest}} sign of fear. She rested her head against my shoulder and put one <b>arm</b> <b>around</b> <b>my</b> neck. I was in raptures.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{accept your}} reproof, child, for boastfulness is hateful in a warrior. But get up, my love. What {{would happen if}} some one {{came into the room}} and found a little old hag sitting on my knee with her <b>arm</b> <b>around</b> <b>my</b> neck?" ...|$|E
60|$|He {{caught my}} hand in his, and devoured it with kisses. His lips burned me like fire. He twisted himself {{suddenly}} in the chair, and wound his <b>arm</b> <b>around</b> <b>my</b> waist. In the terror and indignation of the moment, vainly struggling with him, I cried out for help.|$|E
6000|$|Laws, it was {{out before}} I could think! And before I could budge she throws her <b>arms</b> <b>around</b> <b>my</b> neck {{and told me to}} say it AGAIN, say it AGAIN, say it AGAIN! ...|$|R
6000|$|I {{saw myself}} draw near her reverently and say, [...] "Margaret, he is dead, {{and that is}} why I have come back," [...] and I saw her put her <b>arms</b> <b>around</b> <b>my</b> neck as she often did long ago.|$|R
60|$|She put her <b>arms</b> <b>around</b> <b>my</b> neck, and I {{said that}} it would do admirably; but I had a certain sinking of the heart, for I saw how hard it was even for Eveleth to part with her property.|$|R
6000|$|... "Bless your {{innocent}} heart, did {{you think}} you could hide any thing from me? Geordie couldn't keep a secret, and I'm only paying his debt, Pen dear, with the sort of interest women like," [...] Dick answered, with an audacious <b>arm</b> <b>around</b> <b>my</b> waist and a brown beard close to my cheek.|$|E
60|$|I came to in {{the midst}} of wild movement. All about me was the same movement. I had been caught up in a monstrous flood that was {{sweeping}} me I knew not whither. Fresh air was on my cheek and biting sweetly in my lungs. Faint and dizzy, I was vaguely aware of a strong <b>arm</b> <b>around</b> <b>my</b> body under the arms, and half-lifting me and dragging me along. Feebly my own limbs were helping me. In front of me I could see the moving back of a man's coat. It had been slit from top to bottom along the centre seam, and it pulsed rhythmically, the slit opening and closing regularly with every leap of the wearer. This phenomenon fascinated me for a time, while my senses were coming back to me. Next I became aware of stinging cheeks and nose, and could feel blood dripping on my face. My hat was gone. My hair was down and flying, and from the stinging of the scalp I managed to recollect a hand in the press of the entrance that had torn at my hair. My chest and arms were bruised and aching in a score of places.|$|E
6000|$|I {{had found}} {{a place on the}} [...] "Pennsylvania" [...] for my brother Henry, who was two years my junior. It was not a place of profit, it was only a place of promise. He was [...] "mud" [...] clerk. Mud clerks {{received}} no salary, but they were in the line of promotion. They could become, presently, third clerk and second clerk, then chief clerk--that is to say, purser. The dream begins when Henry had been mud clerk about three months. We were lying in port at St. Louis. Pilots and steersmen had nothing to do during the three days that the boat lay in port in St. Louis and New Orleans, but the mud clerk had to begin his labors at dawn and continue them into the night, by the light of pine-knot torches. Henry and I, moneyless and unsalaried, had billeted ourselves upon our brother-in-law, Mr. Moffet, as night lodgers while in port. We took our meals on board the boat. No, I mean I lodged at the house, not Henry. He spent the evenings at the house, from nine until eleven, then went to the boat to be ready for his early duties. On the night of the dream he started away at eleven, shaking hands with the family, and said good-by according to custom. I may mention that hand-shaking as a good-by was not merely the custom of that family, but the custom of the region--the custom of Missouri, I may say. In all my life, up to that time, I had never seen one member of the Clemens family kiss another one--except once. When my father lay dying in our home in Hannibal--the 24th of March, 1847--he put his <b>arm</b> <b>around</b> <b>my</b> sister's neck and drew her down and kissed her, saying [...] "Let me die." [...] I remember that, and I remember the death rattle which swiftly followed those words, which were his last. These good-bys of Henry's were always executed in the family sitting-room on the second floor, and Henry went from that room and down-stairs without further ceremony. But this time my mother went with him {{to the head of the}} stairs and said good-by again. As I remember it she was moved to this by something in Henry's manner, and she remained at the head of the stairs while he descended. When he reached the door he hesitated, and climbed the stairs and shook hands good-by once more.|$|E
60|$|He {{threw his}} <b>arms</b> <b>around</b> <b>my</b> neck, bent me over his stomach to his breast, {{kissed me on}} both cheeks, hugged me four or five times, and then placed me in his own arm-chair. As soon as I had got well again, we began {{business}} at once.|$|R
6000|$|... "Don't {{leave me}} to-day, Paul," [...] whispered {{my mother to}} me one morning. So I stayed, and in the evening my mother put her <b>arms</b> <b>around</b> <b>my</b> neck and I lay beside her, my head upon her breast, as I used to when a little boy. And when the morning came I was alone.|$|R
6000|$|It was by {{no means}} what I {{intended}} it to be, but it seemed luxurious to her. Tears dimmed her eyes as she stepped across the threshold, but when I said, [...] "Mother, hereafter my headquarters are to be in Chicago, and my home here with you," [...] she put her <b>arms</b> <b>around</b> <b>my</b> neck and wept. Her wanderings were over, her heart at peace.|$|R
5000|$|His {{connection}} with the chimps is evident when he teaches 11-year-old Cozi to climb a tree for the first time. [...] "Cozi never had been up a tree before, and I could feel he was nervous of falling but also elated by the new experience," [...] said Cussons. [...] "As he put his <b>arm</b> <b>around</b> <b>my</b> shoulders for security, I felt then that, although we belonged to different species, Cozi saw me {{not just as a}} friend but a brother he trusted with his life." ...|$|E
5000|$|Gracey said [...] "In {{my first}} varsity year, {{the night before}} we played Georgia Tech, Coach McGugin casually walked up {{to me in the}} lobby of our hotel, put his <b>arm</b> <b>around</b> <b>my</b> soldier and sorta whispered, [...] "I was with some Atlanta newspapermen this {{afternoon}} and I told them you were the finest sophomore center I had ever coached. I hope that I haven't made it embarrassing for you" [...] We beat Tech, 49 to 7. Afterward I talked to seven other players and you know, Coach McGugin told them all the same thing he told me." ...|$|E
5000|$|In 1988 Vaughn made {{headlines}} while visiting New York City when Vaughn, then 67, defended himself during an attempted mugging as Vaughn left his hotel in midtown Manhattan after midnight {{to get a}} newspaper. [...] Former professional prizefighter Vaughn hit the would-be mugger in the jaw leaving the mugger {{face down on the}} sidewalk. [...] "This fellow came up behind me, put his <b>arm</b> <b>around</b> <b>my</b> waist, pinned my right arm to my side, and tried to remove my wallet," [...] says Vaughn. [...] "I hit him in the throat with my elbow. Then I kneed him in the groin and hit him in the jaw about five times. He was jackknifed on his face on the sidewalk as I walked away." [...] "On several occasions I've had to straighten people out," [...] Vaughn added.|$|E
60|$|And {{the young}} Robber laughed in answer, {{and sought to}} knock at the gate. And {{as he did so}} the Hermit ran forward and caught him by the skirts of his raiment, and said to him: 'Stretch forth your hands, and set your <b>arms</b> <b>around</b> <b>my</b> neck, and put your ear close to my lips, and I will give you what remains to me of the {{knowledge}} of God.' And the young Robber stopped.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, so that's it! I {{knew there}} was something. How glad--how glad I am!" [...] Then Sally threw her <b>arms</b> <b>around</b> <b>my</b> neck, and without reserve or {{restraint}} began to kiss me and love me. It {{must have been a}} moment of sheer gladness to feel that I was not disreputable, a moment when something deep and womanly in her was vindicated. Assuredly she was entirely different from what she had ever been before.|$|R
60|$|This was a {{compliment}} to me, but it showed what a sad pass Steele had come to. My regret was that I had no sympathy to offer him. I failed him there. I had trouble of my own. The feel of Sally's clinging <b>arms</b> <b>around</b> <b>my</b> neck, the warm, sweet touch {{of her lips}} remained on mine. What Steele was enduring I did not know, but I {{felt that it was}} agony.|$|R
5000|$|Conservative Central Office {{were not}} so sure. They were {{concerned}} that a local businessman with little fame or track record would struggle to beat the former MP and author and the World War II hero. Odds were given of 6:1 against the Conservatives winning. Harris was summoned to see Party leader Winston Churchill, which Harris realised was to dissuade him from standing. He later said, [...] "when he discovered how determined I was to win the seat, he put his <b>arm</b> <b>around</b> <b>my</b> shoulders {{and said he would}} help me all he could." [...] Churchill toured the constituency, making speeches from the top of his car. Helpfully, his daughter Mary Soames was then in a Croydon maternity hospital giving birth to her son, Nicholas, bringing the campaign positive publicity. In the end, Harris triumphed with an 11,664 majority. A national newspaper the next morning ran the headline [...] "Oh what a beautiful morning". The song (from Oklahoma!) became his theme tune when touring Croydon.|$|E
5000|$|... "I {{set out on}} my Raleigh Sports... I arrived elated {{and full}} of {{anticipation}} but my joy was short-lived, all the doors were locked and barred {{and there was no}} sign of life. Without warning a side door flew open and a small powerfully built man came hurtling out of the gloom into the sunlight. A flapping empty sleeve hung where his right arm should have been. He poured a tirade of French at me before stepping back inside and slamming the door. I gave the door another swift kick and shouted in English that all I wanted was to see the famous track. The door slowly opened and the one-armed man stepped outside, but this time a broad smile covered his previously angry face."Anglais?" [...] he said, as if uttering some special password. He spoke in halting English. Did I know Wembley? He had ridden the London six-day there? He put his one good <b>arm</b> <b>around</b> <b>my</b> shoulder and escorted me and my Raleigh into the stadium.|$|E
5000|$|... "I was {{determined}} {{to tell the story}} of steel from the viewpoint of an eager immigrant in ‘An American Romance….’ When the picture was previewed in Inglewood, Louis B. Mayer came to me on the sidewalk in front of the theater, put his <b>arm</b> <b>around</b> <b>my</b> shoulders and said, ‘I’ve just seen the greatest picture our company ever made. However, an order came from the New York office to cut half an hour. They cut the human elements of the story instead of the documentary sections, explaining that this was the only way a half hour could be taken out without complications in the musical soundtrack. In other words, the film was edited according to the soundtrack and not according to the inherent story values. At the lowest emotional level I have reached since I have been on Hollywood, I went to my office, packed up and moved out of the studio. The picture was not a box office success. Many of the inhabitants of Hollywood and Beverly Hills have never seen the film and many do not even know it was made. I spent 3 years of my life on the project and MGM spent close to $3,000,000."MGM recorded a loss of $1.7 million on the movie.|$|E
6000|$|... "That's fine. Sally, {{you have}} ideas in your pretty little head. And once I thought it held nothing but--" [...] She {{put a hand}} on my mouth. [...] "I must go now," [...] she said and rose. She stood close to me and put her <b>arms</b> <b>around</b> <b>my</b> neck. [...] "One thing more, Russ. It--it was dif--difficult telling Diane we--we were engaged. I lied to Uncle. But what else could I have told Diane? I--I--Oh--was it--" [...] She faltered.|$|R
6000|$|... "'She's come to do light {{housekeeping}} for you,' Seth grinned. I let him rave, though afterwards I {{kept him}} throwing {{in the coal}} too fast to work his mouth very much. Why, say, when I got {{to the spot where}} I picked her up, and stopped the train for her to get off, she just flopped down on her knees, got a hammerlock with her <b>arms</b> <b>around</b> <b>my</b> knees, and cried all over my shoes. What was I to do?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "My brother! {{this is some}} incomprehensible raving," [...] pealed Isabel, {{throwing}} both <b>arms</b> <b>around</b> him;--"my brother, <b>my</b> brother!" ...|$|R
5000|$|... "I {{would have}} guessed that the dead Japanese was only about {{fourteen}} years old and there he lay dead. My thoughts turned to some mother back in Japan who would receive word that her son {{had been killed in}} battle. Then one of the Marines, who I found out later had been through other campaigns, reached over and roughly grabbed the Japanese soldier by the belt and ripped his shirt off. Somebody said, 'What are you looking for?' And he said, 'I'm looking for a money belt. Japs always carry money belts.' Well, this Jap didn't. Another Marine veteran of combat saw that the dead soldier had some gold teeth, so he took the butt of his rifle and banged him on the jaw, hoping to extract the gold teeth. Whether he did or not I don't know, because at that point I turned around and walked away. I went over to where I thought no one would see me and sat down. Although my eyes were dry, inside my heart was wrenching, not at seeing the dead soldier, but at seeing the way some of my comrades had treated that dead body. That bothered me a great deal. Pretty soon Al came over and sat down beside me and put his <b>arm</b> <b>around</b> <b>my</b> shoulder. He knew what I was feeling. When I turned to look at Al he had tears running down his face." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Like an angel! It seemed {{rather to}} be {{a relief to}} her mind, for she threw her <b>arms</b> <b>around</b> <b>my</b> neck, and asked if this was all that had lately made me unhappy.--But, poor girl," [...] added he, [...] "she cannot realize the change we must undergo. She has no idea of poverty but in the abstract; she has only read of it in poetry, where it is allied to love. She feels as yet no privation; she suffers no loss of {{accustomed}} conveniences nor elegancies. When we come practically to experience its sordid cares, its paltry wants, its petty humiliations--then will be the real trial." ...|$|R
40|$|In lieu of an abstract, {{below is}} the essay 2 ̆ 7 s first paragraph. 2 ̆ 2 We {{sat on the}} stoop of our musty green house. Its white {{shutters}} peeled in the Florida humidity. The wooden boards beneath us flattened our behinds and stuck to our flesh when we stood up. I pulled my knees to my chest and wrapped <b>my</b> skinny <b>arms</b> <b>around</b> <b>my</b> bruised legs. We thought of our house as a wicked castle {{and the two of}} us as maidens in distress. Together we dreamed that a pair of handsome princes on fine white horses would sweep us away through the orange blossoms to some magical land. The princes never came. 2 ̆...|$|R
6000|$|... "It is not {{the night}} I fear, but the day. I hate the sight of this [...] woman with whom I live, whom I call 'wife.' I shrink from the blow of [...] her cold lips, the curse of her stony eyes. She has seen, she has [...] learnt; I feel it, I know it. Yet she winds her <b>arms</b> <b>around</b> <b>my</b> neck, [...] and calls me sweetheart, and smoothes my hair with her soft, false [...] hands. We speak mocking words of love to one another, but I know her [...] cruel eyes are ever {{following}} me. She is plotting her revenge, and I [...] hate her, I hate her, I hate her!" ...|$|R
60|$|I stooped {{and kissed}} her lightly on the cheek. But {{suddenly}} her <b>arms</b> were wound <b>around</b> <b>my</b> neck. With a strength which was amazing she held me to her.|$|R
