5|$|Washington v. Texas, 388 U.S. 14 (1967), is a United States Supreme Court case {{in which}} the Court decided that the Compulsory Process Clause of the Sixth Amendment to the Constitution (guaranteeing the right of a {{criminal}} defendant to force the <b>attendance</b> <b>of</b> <b>witnesses</b> for their side) is applicable in state courts as well as federal courts. Jackie Washington had attempted to call his co-defendant as a witness, but was blocked by Texas courts because state law prevented co-defendants from testifying for each other, under the theory that they would be likely to lie for each other on the stand.|$|E

2500|$|Various {{states have}} a {{statutory}} provision to define the execution and regulation of subpoenas. [...] Louisiana is typical.

2500|$|As {{a general}} rule, {{independent}} of statutory considerations, the writ {{of habeas corpus}} ad testificandum under American law may be resorted to {{for the purpose of}} removing a person confined in a jail or prison to enable him to testify as a witness. [...] The issuance of such a writ lies within the sound discretion of the court, or the judicial officer having the power to compel the <b>attendance</b> <b>of</b> <b>witnesses.</b> [...] Relevance and materiality are of consideration in such matters. [...] The constitutional right of an accused to compulsory process for obtaining witnesses does not necessarily extend to compelling the attendance of person in prison. [...] This right is not violated by a statute which makes the right to the production of a witness confined in prison upon the discretion of the court.|$|E

2500|$|An {{appropriately}} interested person, such as {{a losing}} candidate, may question the result (the [...] "return of the writ") in a federal election by a petition to the High Court as Court of Disputed Returns, normally within 40 days of the result. [...] A petition can also be filed by the Australian Electoral Commission. [...] The High Court may hear the whole case itself or may delegate factual questions for determination by the Federal Court; the High Court itself will determine the validity of a candidate's election or of the whole of that particular election, including issues of constitutional interpretation. [...] The admissible grounds for a petition are generally at the Court's discretion but include corruption and do not extend to administrative errors that have not affected the result. [...] The Court can compel production of documents and <b>attendance</b> <b>of</b> <b>witnesses,</b> and can examine witnesses on oath. [...] However, the Court [...] "must make its decision on a petition as quickly as is reasonable in the circumstances", it is not bound by strict rules of evidence, {{and all of its}} decisions [...] "shall be final and conclusive and without appeal, and shall not be questioned in any way" [...] (thus there is no recourse to the High Court in its other capacities or to the Parliament).|$|E
60|$|The {{objects of}} the legal inquiry were {{necessarily}} beset by peculiar complications and difficulties. Besides {{the investigation into the}} manner in which the deceased had met his death, there were serious questions to be settled relating to the cause of the fire, to the abstraction of the keys, and to the presence of a stranger in the vestry at the time when the flames broke out. Even the identification of the dead man had not yet been accomplished. The helpless condition of the servant had made the police distrustful of his asserted recognition of his master. They had sent to Knowlesbury overnight to secure the <b>attendance</b> <b>of</b> <b>witnesses</b> who were well acquainted with the personal appearance of Sir Percival Glyde, and they had communicated, the first thing in the morning, with Blackwater Park. These precautions enabled the coroner and jury to settle the question of identity, and to confirm the correctness of the servant's assertion; the evidence offered by competent witnesses, and by the discovery of certain facts, being subsequently strengthened by an examination of the dead man's watch. The crest and the name of Sir Percival Glyde were engraved inside it.|$|E

But in that time, while I was in confinement, Sir Percival might use any means he pleased to embarrass my future proceedings--perhaps to screen himself from detection altogether--without the slightest fear of any hindrance on my part.

5000|$|October 9, 1926 saw {{first steps}} taken towards {{creating}} the Limerick Gaelic Grounds as a GAA stadium of note. A farm containing 12 acre was purchased at Coolraine on the Ennis Road for {{development as a}} sporting grounds. Two years later the new grounds officially opened with two junior hurling games. The first big effort {{to raise funds for}} the development of the grounds was in 1932, with the establishment of a development committee, whose remit was to level the pitch, providing sideline seating and erect a boundary wall. The 1950s saw crowds of up to 50,000 attending games in the grounds. 1958 saw a new stand being built at Páirc na nGael - it was the Old Hogan Stand from Croke Park. A record paid <b>attendance</b> <b>of</b> 61,174 <b>witnessed</b> the Munster hurling final between Cork and Tipperary at the stadium in 1961 and it is estimated that another 10,000 spectators piled in without paying after the gates were broken down.|$|R
