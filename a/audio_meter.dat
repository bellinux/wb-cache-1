It was driven by a circuit that gave a roughly logarithmic transfer characteristic, so it could be calibrated in decibels. The overall characteristics were the product of the driver circuit and the movement's ballistics.|$|E

50|$|The {{research}} methodology {{is based on}} a continuous diary survey (ex. Christmas holidays) measuring the listening behaviour of over 100,000 adults (aged 15+) a year. The diary is filled in on a quarter-hour basis for one week’s listening drawn from a sample representative of the individual station transmission area and the nation as a whole. The fieldwork for the Research is carried out on behalf of RAJAR by specialist research contractors, currently Ipsos Mori. The sampling point framework is undertaken by RSMB Ltd. The diary based system is the most common method of measuring radio audiences worldwide. Some countries have introduced electronic devices called audiometers. RAJAR has tested over recent years several audiometers but has not determined any viable for introduction in the UK market. RAJAR continues to work with developers to determine future viability of innovations with <b>audio</b> <b>meters</b> and any new measurement techniques that could be of use.|$|R

50|$|In {{professional}} usage, where consistent level {{measurements are}} needed across an industry, <b>audio</b> level <b>meters</b> often {{comply with a}} detailed formal standard. This ensures that all compliant meters indicate the same level for a given audio signal. The principal standard for PPMs is IEC 60268-10. It describes two different quasi-PPM designs that have roots in meters originally developed in the 1930s for the AM radio broadcasting networks of Germany (Type I) and the United Kingdom (Type II). The term Peak Programme Meter usually refers to these IEC-specified types and similar designs. Though originally designed for monitoring analogue audio signals, these PPMs are now also used with digital audio.|$|R

40|$|In this user study, {{we address}} several open {{issues in the}} design of waiting cues for system {{response}} time (SRT) in interactive telephony speech applications. User observations and structured preference tests indicate that silent waiting times should not be longer than 4 – 8 seconds. Already at short durations, music combined with speech was favored to silence. A preference test regarding several non-speech waiting cues proposed in literature suggests that music is preferred to more simple synthetic sounds and to natural sounds. The continuous indication of the remaining waiting time by speech was rated as much more pleasant and appropriate than a non-speech <b>audio</b> progress <b>meter.</b> Commercial announcements and navigational advice during waiting times were not accepted by the subjects.

50|$|Following {{the success}} of the Canon Hack Development Kit (CHDK) for Canon's PowerShot cameras, third party {{firmware}} was also produced for the 5D Mark II. The Magic Lantern firmware provides many additional video and cinematography related controls and meters such as false colors, and zebra stripes for exposure control, depth of field estimates via peaking filters, <b>audio</b> VU <b>meters</b> and disables the automatic gain control on the microphone input (although some of these features have since been added to Canon's official firmware, as noted above). Recent nightly builds have even managed to provide a stable output of uncompressed 14-Bit RAW video data onto fast UDMA 7 CF cards at almost HD resolution (1004p vs. 1080p at Full HD). Although the size of the files and high price of appropriate cards are considered moderate drawbacks and the 5D Mark III generally shows better performance regarding RAW video, the Mark II, being the oldest among them, still remains to be the next best among reasonable choices for DSLR RAW video output and showcases thus, that uncompressed HD RAW video on a DSLR was already theoretically possible with technology of the year 2008.|$|R
40|$|A meter is {{constructed}} for {{the measurement of}} phase differences of voltages in the lover <b>audio</b> range. This <b>meter</b> possesses many distinct advantages over the prevailing types in range, accuracy, and ease of operation. To test the meter, calculations are made of the phase change in a transmission line at various frequencies, and the results checked with the readings on the phase meter.

These are obtained by the use of a three phase oscillator and Scott transformer connection. This method is selected as it will not spoil the adjustment of the phase meter with frequency change...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to {{investigate}} whether South African free to air television and radio broadcast audio contains loudness fluctuations that fall outside previously determined limits of listener comfort. This is a relevant aim as consumers often complain about loudness fluctuations in broadcast audio (e. g. “why are the commercials so loud?”). Loudness is an inherently subjective phenomenon that is not only subject to differences in human perception from day to day, but also more specifically by the frequency content, localisation, spatialisation and duration of the audio stimulus. Traditional <b>audio</b> level <b>meters</b> only measure the audio signal or digital samples, and do not take any of these psychoacoustic phenomena into consideration. Broadcast audio has traditionally been regulated by specifying the permitted maximum level (PML) of the signal to avoid overloading the transmitter or over- modulation the broadcast signals. While this is necessary to keep the transmission inside the technical dynamic range of the medium, it does not correspond to the perceived loudness of these signals. With the addition of power dynamic range processing techniques, content producers and broadcasters were now able to raise the average level (and correspondingly the perceived loudness) without affecting the permitted maximum level or the peak level of the signal. Broadcasts were still compliant, but subjectively louder. As this process has not been done uniformly across various stations, and various types of audio, fluctuations occur both between stations, and between different segments on the same station. These fluctuations are the cause of listener complaints. There has been a move in international regulators and broadcasters to make a paradigm shift from peak normalisation to loudness normalisation of broadcast audio content. Limited, to no adoption, of this new paradigm in South African broadcasting is evident. This study provides baseline data of the status quo of South African free to air broadcast audio to investigate whether it contains problematic fluctuations, and therefore whether a move from peak to loudness normalisation could possibly have a positive effect. The study found that generally radio broadcasts suffered from greater and more problematic loudness fluctuations compared to television. Televisions broadcasts differed enough from station to station to cause inter-station loudness fluctuations outside previously determined limits for listener comfort, but not intra-station fluctuations. SABC 2 was found to be the loudest and SABC 3 the softest at this particular testing high-site. Radio broadcasts contained a large proportion of inter-station fluctuations, and while it varied considerably from station to station, each station contains some proportion of intra-station fluctuations. Advertisements were found not to be the loudness programme segment type. It was found that the following segments types were generally the softest to the loudest: talking, advertisements, links (interstitials) and music. Ikwekwezi FM was found to be the loudest station by far, with Lotus FM the softest, with a very wide difference of 13. 7 LU between their integrated station loudness values. The vast majority of broadcast audio was found to have a loudness range appropriate to the intended platform, but perhaps limited to the range appropriate the lowest common denominator, resulting in signals with high to extreme levels of dynamic compression and peak limiting. The study also provided much greater levels of detail of the nature and extent of all loudness fluctuations, especially for radio loudness data. Additionally, ‘zap testing’ methodology was tested to simulate real-life inter-station fluctuation scenarios, and also found to be an efficient method for extrapolating overall station loudness for a larger set of stations. Finally, the study recommends the paradigm shift from peak to loudness normalisation for all audio content producers and distributors in the country, and suggests the EBU R 128 recommendation as the most viable starting point.
