25|$|In {{the stretch}} around Milecastle 50TW, {{it was built}} on <b>a</b> <b>flat</b> <b>base</b> with three to four courses of turf blocks. A basal layer of cobbles was used westwards from Milecastle 72 (at Burgh-by-Sands) and {{possibly}} at Milecastle 53. Where the underlying ground was boggy, wooden piles were used.|$|E
25|$|The {{similar but}} {{essentially}} unrelated arm-reliquary {{was a popular}} form during the medieval period when the hand was most used. Typically these are in precious metal, showing the hand {{and most of the}} forearm, pointing up erect from <b>a</b> <b>flat</b> <b>base</b> where the arm stopped. They contained relics, usually from that part of the body of the saint, and it was the saint's hand that was represented.|$|E
25|$|The {{eastern side}} of the fell forms the head of Swindale proper, the upper valley being known as Mosedale. Swindale is a classic U-shaped valley, its profile almost a square section, with <b>a</b> <b>flat</b> <b>base</b> and sheer walls. Selside Pike's eastern slopes fall gently to about the 2,000ft contour and then plunge over a wall of crag to the valley floor. Geordie Greathead Crag is the {{dominant}} feature and below this is the dry tarnbed of Dodd Bottom. Hobgrumble Gill falls down this face in a deep gully, separating Selside Pike from the north east ridge of High Howes. Above the crags the gill runs in a small hanging valley.|$|E

25|$|The Great Mosque of Kairouan (in Tunisia) is {{considered}} the ancestor of all the mosques in the western Islamic world. Its original marble columns and sculptures were of Roman workmanship brought in from Carthage and other elements resemble Roman form. It {{is one of the}} best preserved and most significant examples of early great mosques, founded in 670 AD and dating in its present form largely from the Aghlabid period (9th century). The Great Mosque of Kairouan is constituted of a massive square minaret, a large courtyard surrounded by porticos and a huge hypostyle prayer hall covered on its axis by two cupolas. The Great Mosque of Samarra in Iraq, completed in 847 AD, combined the hypostyle architecture of rows of columns supporting <b>a</b> <b>flat</b> <b>base</b> above which a huge spiraling minaret was constructed.|$|E
25|$|Various {{forms of}} the rose cut have been in use since the mid-16th century. Like the step cuts, they were derived from older types of cuts. The basic rose cut has <b>a</b> <b>flat</b> <b>base</b> - that is, it lacks a {{pavilion}} - and has a crown composed of triangular facets (usually 12 or 24) rising to form a point (there is no table facet) in an arrangement with sixfold rotational symmetry. The so-called double rose cut is a variation that adds six kite facets at {{the margin of the}} base. The classic rose cut is circular in outline; non-circular variations on the rose cut include the briolette (oval), Antwerp rose (hexagonal), and double Dutch rose (resembling two rose cuts united back-to-back). Rose-cut diamonds are seldom seen nowadays, except in antique jewelry. Like the older style brilliants and step cuts, there is a growing demand for the purpose of repairing or reproducing antique pieces.|$|E

500|$|Bonshō are sited in Buddhist temples, {{usually in}} a {{specially}} designated building or tower called a shōrō [...] They are used to mark the passage of time, and to call the monks to liturgical services. In Buddhism, the bell's sound {{is considered to be}} calming and to induce a suitable atmosphere for meditation. Because of their shape (with sloped shoulders and <b>a</b> <b>flat</b> <b>base)</b> the bells are seen as representations of the sitting Buddha, and are accorded similar respect; those striking the bell will first make three bows towards it, just as they would before a statue of Buddha.|$|E
500|$|Both sexes of all {{subspecies}} have horns, {{with those}} of females being more slender. Horns can reach lengths of the maximum horn length is , recorded from a Namibian red hartebeest. The horns of the western hartebeest are thick and appear U-shaped from the front and Z-shaped from the sides, growing backward {{at first and then}} forward, ending with a sharp backward turn. The horns of the red and the Lelwel hartebeest {{are similar to those of}} the western hartebeest, but appear V-shaped when viewed from the front. The Lichtenstein's hartebeest has thick parallel ringed horns, with <b>a</b> <b>flat</b> <b>base.</b> Its horns are shorter than those of other subspecies, curving upward then sharply forward, followed by an inward turn at an angle of about 45° and a final backward turn. The horns of Swayne's hartebeest are thin and shaped like parentheses, curving upward and then backward. The horns of the Tora hartebeest are particularly thin and spread out sideways, diverging more than in any other subspecies.|$|E
500|$|The {{discovery}} of the graves' east–west alignment has prompted suggestions that the cemetery reflected Christian tradition, although the evidence overall is contradictory about whether the occupants were Christians. The individual graves were fairly uniform in size, usually measuring [...] long, [...] wide and in their original form about [...] deep. They had a rectangular plan with rounded corners and <b>a</b> <b>flat</b> <b>base.</b> The bodies were not interred in coffins; the graves' occupants were buried in their clothes, accompanied by various items that they owned or were given as tokens by mourners. Although none of the bodies have survived it is thought from their size {{that most of the}} graves were intended for women, laid out fully extended. A substantial number are too small for an adult of normal height to have been laid out in such a way and, judging from analogous Saxon graves found elsewhere in England, it is thought that these might have contained crouched burials. The two different methods of burial – crouched versus fully extended – may therefore indicate some difference in ethnic affiliations or political or religious identities.|$|E

2500|$|The Duel Painter was {{the most}} {{important}} early Corinthian painter (625-600 BC) who depicted fighting scenes on aryballos.

It is ubiquitous in Kenya, Tanzania and other Great Lakes nations. A replacement for more traditional crockery containers (ek fara), it used in many Kenyan households for cooking, serving and storing food. Most sufuria are today made of aluminum, and produced and purchased locally in the informal sector. Sufuria were traditionally used to cook over open fire, charcoal brazier (a jiko), or coals, and are purchased {{in a variety of}} sizes, with and without lids.|$|R

2500|$|It is {{a sterile}} {{triploid}} form, {{which means that}} three homologous sets of chromosomes compose each specimen's genetic complement; C.sativus bears eight chromosomal bodies per set, making for 24 in total. Being sterile, the purple flowers of C.sativus fail to produce viable seeds; reproduction hinges on human assistance: clusters of corms, underground, bulb-like, starch-storing organs, must be dug up, divided, and replanted. A corm survives for one season, producing via this vegetative division up to ten [...] "cormlets" [...] that can grow into new plants in the next season. The compact corms are small, brown globules that can measure as large as [...] in diameter, have <b>a</b> <b>flat</b> <b>base,</b> and are shrouded in a dense mat of parallel fibres; this coat {{is referred to as}} the [...] "corm tunic". Corms also bear vertical fibres, thin and net-like, that grow up to [...] above the plant's neck.|$|E
