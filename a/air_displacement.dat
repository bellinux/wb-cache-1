25|$|One of {{the oldest}} types of filters, the undergravel filters consist of a porous plate which is placed beneath the gravel {{on the base of}} the {{aquarium}} and one, or more, uplift tubes. Historically, undergravel filters have been driven via <b>air</b> <b>displacement.</b> Air stones are placed at the base of uplift tubes which force water out of the uplift tube creating negative pressure beneath the undergravel filter plate (also called the plenum). Water then percolates down through the gravel which itself is the filtration material. Greater flow rate of water through the gravel can be achieved via the use of water pump rather than <b>air</b> <b>displacement.</b>|$|E
25|$|In late 2007, {{construction}} {{began on}} a large mixed-use residential, office and retail development located {{on the site of}} the old GW Hospital (Square 54) and just east of the Foggy Bottom-GWU Metrorail station. It was the second-largest undeveloped lot in the District of Columbia at the time of initial construction activity. In 2014, the university assumed ownership of the Corcoran Gallery of Art, the oldest private art museum in Washington D.C. and independent college of art and design. The college of art and design became The Corcoran School of the Arts and Design under the Columbian College of Arts and Sciences. The National Gallery of Art will acquire many of the 17,000 pieces of art from the Corcoran and the rest will be donated to other museums around the country. In May 2014, GW opened the Milken Institute School of Public Health, a nine-story building that received LEED certification for sustainability features including a green roof, rainwater collection system and special heating and air conditioning technologies that helps mass <b>air</b> <b>displacement.</b> The Textile Museum reopened to the public in March 2015 after the institution merged with the university in 2011 and closed it for renovations two years later.|$|E

500|$|A single [...] {{diameter}} subwoofer {{driver was}} designed by Richard Clark and David Navone {{with the help of}} Dr. Eugene Patronis of the Georgia Institute of Technology. The driver was intended to break sound pressure level records when mounted in a road vehicle, calculated to be able to achieve more than 180dBSPL. It was built in 1997, driven by DC motors connected to a rotary crankshaft somewhat like in a piston engine. The cone diameter was [...] and was held in place with a [...] surround.

MTX's Loyd Ivey helped underwrite the project and the driver was then called the MTX [...] "Thunder 1000000" [...] (one million).|$|E

40|$|A loss of blend {{homogeneity}} through handling operations {{can have}} {{a major influence on}} the mechanical properties of sintered products. Plant optimisation to minimise the potential for segregation of blends can be undertaken through an audit of handling operations combined with an evaluation of the materials that are handled through the process. The correct identification of the mechanism of segregation is essential to support strategies to implement the most efficient and cost-effective counter measures. In support of this type of industrial activity, a piece of test apparatus has recently been developed to provide measurements of segregation potential for powders (metal and mineral) that are prone to loss of homogeneity (by composition or particle size) when subjected to counter-directional <b>air</b> <b>displacements</b> through equipment.

40|$|Many {{arthropods}} possess filiform hair sensilla (termed trichobothria in arachnids), {{which are}} extremely sensitive detectors of medium particle displacement. Electrophysiological evidence in some taxa {{suggests that these}} sensilla can detect <b>air</b> particle <b>displacements</b> resulting from intraspecific communication signals. However, {{it has not yet}} been shown for any species that the <b>air</b> particle <b>displacements</b> detected by the filiform hairs are themselves perceived as a ?signal? (i. e. that individuals make behavioural decisions based upon the responses of these organs to the displays of conspecifics). We investigate the agonistic behaviour of the whip spider Phrynus marginemaculatus and the role of its trichobothria in receiving agonistic signals. Whip spiders have extremely elongated ?antenniform? first legs, which they vibrate close to their opponents during agonistic interactions, inducing air movements that excite their opponents' trichobothria. We find that ablation of the trichobothria causes significant increases in: (I) contest duration, and (II) the probability of contest escalation past aggressive displays to physical fighting. Therefore, in the absence of air movement-sensitive sensilla, contest assessment is impaired. This suggests that whip spiders exploit true air movement signals during agonistic interactions, and that these are received by the trichobothria. Furthermore, these results indicate that, in whip spiders, such signals help mitigate the cost of agonistic interaction. publishersversionPeer reviewe...|$|R

30|$|However, as {{the three}} pairs of air holes near the PC L 3 nanocavity center are further moved outward, the nanocavity mode is {{confined}} inside the nanocavity more and more gently [25], as shown in Figure[*] 1 b.

The calculated mode volume of the optimized PC L 3 nanocavity with <b>air</b> hole <b>displacements</b> A = 0.2 a, B = 0.025 a, and C = 0.2 a is 0.0754 μm 3, which agrees well with the reported mode volume as 0.074 μm 3 in [26].
