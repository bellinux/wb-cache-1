5|$|Mineral ores can be mined {{just like}} normal stone and the raw ore can be smelted to produce their {{corresponding}} metal bars. Different ores or metal bars can be alloyed together for higher quality materials. For steel production, flux stones {{are used to}} make pig iron bars and smelt it with regular iron and coal (or charcoal). Specific metal items can be melted back to their respective bars. Without steel, the alloy bronze or regular iron are the next best suitable metals to use. Bronze requires two ores or bars of tin and copper. The metal <b>adamantine,</b> found deep below, is extremely light but very strong, making it excellent for sharp weapons and armor. Raw <b>adamantine</b> can be extracted into strands and can further be either woven in cloth or smelted into wafers.|$|E
5|$|Vanadinite {{is usually}} bright-red or orange-red in colour, {{although}} sometimes brown, red-brown, grey, yellow, or colourless. Its distinctive colour makes it popular among mineral collectors. Its streak {{can be either}} pale yellow or brownish-yellow. Vanadinite may be transparent, translucent or opaque, and its lustre can range from resinous to <b>adamantine.</b> Vanadinite is anisotropic, meaning that some of its properties differ when measured along different axes. When measured perpendicular and parallel to its axis of anisotropy, its refractive indices are 2.350 and 2.416 respectively. This gives it a birefringence of 0.066.|$|E
5|$|Digging deeper {{is usually}} done for finding magma, which as a fuel source, removes the player's {{dependence}} on coal or wood. Another reason to dig deeper is for searching for specific raw materials, ores or gems. Magma pools or even bigger magma seas are found while digging into warm rock. Near magma seas, raw <b>adamantine</b> strata can be found. They are shaped like columns, which pass {{down through the}} entire magma sea. These columns are hollow and can be broken, revealing an entire shaft leading deeper into the underworld or hell. Underworld creatures are countless and can bring entire fortresses to ruin.|$|E
25|$|From the Hesperides he {{received}} a knapsack (kibisis) to safely contain Medusa's head. Zeus gave him an <b>adamantine</b> sword (a Harpe) and Hades' helm of darkness to hide. Hermes lent Perseus winged sandals to fly, and Athena gave him a polished shield. Perseus then proceeded to the Gorgons' cave.|$|E
25|$|In this diamond state Frost {{is unable}} to access her psychic powers due to {{suppression}} by her diamond form's <b>adamantine</b> luster. As a result, Emma is also granted total telepathic immunity while in diamond form. Her diamond form is also stated to emit low-level ultraviolet light, causing it to glow in darkness.|$|E
25|$|Brilliance can {{be divided}} into the {{definitions}} external brilliance and internal brilliance. The former is the light reflected {{from the surface of the}} stone—its luster. Diamond's <b>adamantine</b> ("diamond-like") luster is second only to metallic (i.e., that of metals); while it is directly related to RI, the quality of a finished gem's polish will determine how well a diamond's luster is borne out.|$|E
25|$|Ages before, the Earth {{was ruled}} by the Titans under Kronos. Zeus stopped Kronos and imprisoned him in Tartarus, behind <b>adamantine</b> doors. However, Poseidon, who is envious of Zeus's power, is trying to free Kronos and the Titans in order to destroy Zeus so he could claim the throne. Gargarensis is aiding him because Poseidon and Kronos have promised him {{immortality}} as a reward. Athena asks Arkantos to stop Gargarensis at all costs, as Zeus himself cannot interfere.|$|E
25|$|It is a dense substance, with a {{specific}} gravity between 5.6 and 6.0 — at least 1.6 times that of diamond. Cubic zirconia is relatively hard, 8–8.5 on the Mohs scale— slightly harder than most semi-precious natural gems. Its refractive index is high at 2.15–2.18 (compared to 2.42 for diamonds) and its luster is <b>adamantine.</b> Its dispersion is very high at 0.058–0.066, exceeding that of diamond (0.044). Cubic zirconia has no cleavage and exhibits a conchoidal fracture. Because of its high hardness, it is generally considered brittle.|$|E
25|$|Lustre {{indicates}} how light reflects {{from the}} mineral's surface, {{with regards to}} its quality and intensity. There are numerous qualitative terms used to describe this property, which are split into metallic and non-metallic categories. Metallic and sub-metallic minerals have high reflectivity like metal; examples of minerals with this lustre are galena and pyrite. Non-metallic lustres include: <b>adamantine,</b> such as in diamond; vitreous, which is a glassy lustre very common in silicate minerals; pearly, such as in talc and apophyllite, resinous, such {{as members of the}} garnet group, silky which common in fibrous minerals such as asbestiform chrysotile.|$|E
25|$|According to Hesiod, Gaia {{conceived}} further offspring with Uranus, {{first the}} giant one-eyed Cyclopes: Brontes ("Thunder"), Steropes ("Lightning") and Arges ("Bright"); then the Hecatonchires: Cottus, Briareos and Gyges, {{each with a}} hundred arms and fifty heads. As each of the Cyclopes and Hecatonchires were born, Uranus hid them in a secret place within Gaia, causing her great pain. So Gaia devised a plan. She created a grey flint (or <b>adamantine)</b> sickle. And Cronus used the sickle to castrate his father Uranus as he approached Gaia {{to have sex with}} her. From Uranus' spilled blood, Gaia produced the Erinyes, the Giants and the Meliae (ash-tree nymphs). From the testicles of Uranus in the sea came forth Aphrodite.|$|E
25|$|Differences {{in crystal}} {{structure}} and chemistry greatly influence other physical {{properties of the}} mineral. The carbon allotropes diamond and graphite have vastly different properties; diamond is the hardest natural substance, has an <b>adamantine</b> lustre, and belongs to the isometric crystal family, whereas as graphite is very soft, has a greasy lustre, and crystallises in the hexagonal family. This difference is accounted by differences in bonding. In diamond, the carbons are in sp3 hybrid orbitals, which means they form a framework where each carbon is covalently bonded to four neighbours in a tetrahedral fashion; on the other hand, graphite is composed of sheets of carbons in sp2 hybrid orbitals, where each carbon is bonded covalently to only three others. These sheets are held together by much weaker van der Waals forces, and this discrepancy translates to big macroscopic differences.|$|E
25|$|The Mohs {{scale of}} mineral {{hardness}} is a non-linear scale of common minerals' resistances to scratching. Diamond {{is at the}} top of this scale (hardness 10), as it is one of the hardest naturally occurring materials known. (Some artificial substances, such as aggregated diamond nanorods, are harder.) Since a diamond is unlikely to encounter substances that can scratch it, other than another diamond, diamond gemstones are typically free of scratches. Diamond's hardness also is visually evident (under the microscope or loupe) by its highly lustrous facets (described as <b>adamantine)</b> which are perfectly flat, and by its crisp, sharp facet edges. For a diamond simulant to be effective, it must be very hard relative to most gems. Most simulants fall far short of diamond's hardness, so they can be separated from diamond by their external flaws and poor polish.|$|E
25|$|High {{specific}} gravity is a diagnostic property of a mineral. A variation in chemistry (and consequently, mineral class) correlates {{to a change}} in {{specific gravity}}. Among more common minerals, oxides and sulfides tend to have a higher specific gravity as they include elements with higher atomic mass. A generalization is that minerals with metallic or <b>adamantine</b> lustre tend to have higher specific gravities than those having a non-metallic to dull lustre. For example, hematite, Fe2O3, has a specific gravity of 5.26 while galena, PbS, has a specific gravity of 7.2–7.6, which is a result of their high iron and lead content, respectively. A very high specific gravity becomes very pronounced in native metals; kamacite, an iron-nickel alloy common in iron meteorites has a specific gravity of 7.9, and gold has an observed specific gravity between 15 and 19.3.|$|E
25|$|Much {{less common}} than colorless zircon is colorless scheelite. Its {{dispersion}} (0.026) is also {{high enough to}} mimic diamond, but although it is highly lustrous its hardness is much too low (4.5–5.5) to maintain a good polish. It is also anisotropic and fairly dense (SG 5.9–6.1). Synthetic scheelite produced via the Czochralski process is available, but {{it has never been}} widely used as a diamond simulant. Due to the scarcity of natural gem-quality scheelite, synthetic scheelite is much more likely to simulate it than diamond. A similar case is the orthorhombic carbonate cerussite, which is so fragile (very brittle with four directions of good cleavage) and soft (hardness 3.5) that it is never seen set in jewelry, and only occasionally seen in gem collections because it is so difficult to cut. Cerussite gems have an <b>adamantine</b> luster, high RI (1.804–2.078), and high dispersion (0.051), making them attractive and valued collector's pieces. Aside from softness, they are easily distinguished by cerussite's high density (SG 6.51) and anisotropy with extreme birefringence (0.271).|$|E
500|$|Lansbury was {{a talented}} politician, speaker, and organizer. What made him {{remarkable}} was the stubbornness {{with which he}} clung to his principles... {{became one of the}} best-loved and most-respected figures in the labour movement. Lansbury's legacy has been the <b>adamantine</b> insistence among an element within the Labour Party that Britain must stand for moral principles, must set the world a moral example. Concretely, this has meant demanding the total abolition of capitalism and unilateral disarmament, policies that Labour's leaders have usually thought utopian or worse.|$|E

2500|$|The {{story of}} Cupid and Psyche was readily allegorized. In late antiquity, Martianus Capella (5th century) refashions {{it as an}} allegory about {{the fall of the}} human soul. For Apuleius, {{immortality}} is granted to the soul of Psyche as a reward for commitment to sexual love. In the version of Martianus, sexual love draws Psyche into the material world that is subject to death: [...] "Cupid takes Psyche from Virtue and shackles her in <b>adamantine</b> chains".|$|E
2500|$|The <b>Adamantine</b> Arrow: [...] spiritual {{warriors and}} masters of conflict, who claim a {{heritage}} {{going back to}} the First City's defenders. Currently, the Order of the Arrow could perhaps be described as something akin to a knightly sect, though bushido and other warrior codes find a place in The Arrow. [...] These mages conduct intensive physical and mental training, honing the minds and bodies of order members into deadly weapons which magical society may then wield against its enemies (such as , , Seers of the Throne, and so on).|$|E
2500|$|The Sanskrit term [...] "vajra" [...] denoted the thunderbolt, {{a legendary}} weapon and divine {{attribute}} {{that was made}} from an <b>adamantine,</b> or indestructible, substance and which could therefore pierce and penetrate any obstacle or obfuscation. It is the weapon of choice of Indra, the King of the Devas. As a secondary meaning, [...] "vajra" [...] symbolizes the ultimate nature of things which is described in the tantras as translucent, pure and radiant, but also indestructible and indivisible. It is also symbolic {{of the power of}} tantric methods to achieve its goals.|$|E

2500|$|The {{idea for}} The Museum of Modern Art was {{developed}} in 1929 primarily by Abby Aldrich Rockefeller (wife of John D. Rockefeller, Jr.) and two of her friends, Lillie P. Bliss and Mary Quinn Sullivan. They became known variously as [...] "the Ladies", [...] "the daring ladies" [...] and [...] "the <b>adamantine</b> ladies". They rented modest quarters for the new museum in the Heckscher Building at 730 Fifth Avenue (corner of Fifth Avenue and 57th Street) in Manhattan, and it {{opened to the public}} on November 7, 1929, nine days after the Wall Street Crash. Abby had invited A. Conger Goodyear, {{the former president of the}} board of trustees of the Albright Art Gallery in Buffalo, New York, to become president of the new museum. Abby became treasurer. At the time, it was America's premier museum devoted exclusively to modern art, and the first of its kind in Manhattan to exhibit European modernism. [...] One of Abby's early recruits for the museum staff was the noted Japanese-American photographer Soichi Sunami (at that time best known for his portraits of modern dance pioneer Martha Graham), who served the museum as its official documentary photographer from 1930 until 1968.|$|E
2500|$|The main {{character}} originally {{went through a}} number of possible names: [...] "Cornelius Chance", [...] "Rupert De'Ath", [...] "Dick Daring", [...] "Dexter Noble", [...] "Aurelian Winton", [...] "Magnus Hawke" [...] and even [...] "Darius Crud" [...] before Sydney Newman settled on Adam Adamant, named after the generic mineral term <b>adamantine,</b> which, since medieval times, has commonly referred to diamond. In the opening episode, [...] "A Vintage Year for Scoundrels", Adam Llewellyn De Vere Adamant – to give him his full name – is a swashbuckling Victorian gentleman adventurer who, in 1902, goes to rescue his kidnapped girlfriend Louise, but is lured into a trap whereupon he is captured and condemned to be frozen forever in a block of ice by his nemesis, the Face, whose identity is concealed behind a leather mask and who speaks in a sinister whispering voice. The Face grants his helpless prisoner one last request and Adam asks to see Louise. But in his last moments of life before being frozen, Adam learns to his horror that Louise had faked her kidnapping and had been working for the Face all along.|$|E
2500|$|The {{history of}} diamond cuts {{can be traced}} to the late Middle Ages, before which time {{diamonds}} were employed in their natural octahedral state—anhedral (poorly formed) diamonds simply were not used in jewelry. The first [...] "improvements" [...] on nature's design involved a simple polishing of the octahedral crystal faces to create even and unblemished facets, or to fashion the desired octahedral shape out of an otherwise unappealing piece of rough. This was called the point cut and dates from the mid 14th century; by 1375 there was a guild of diamond polishers at Nürnberg. By the mid 15th century, the point cut began to be improved upon: a little less than one half of the octahedron would be sawn off, creating the table cut. The importance of a culet was also realised, and some table-cut stones may possess one. The addition of four corner facets created the old single cut (or old eight cut). Neither of these early cuts would reveal what diamond is prized for today; its strong dispersion or fire. At the time, diamond was valued chiefly for its <b>adamantine</b> lustre and superlative hardness; a table-cut diamond would appear black to the eye, as they do in paintings of the era. For this reason, colored gemstones such as ruby and sapphire were far more popular in jewelry of the era.|$|E
