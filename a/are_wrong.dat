5|$|Back in New Orleans, St. Clare debates slavery {{with his}} Northern cousin Ophelia who, while {{opposing}} slavery, is prejudiced against black people. St. Clare, however, {{believes he is}} not biased, {{even though he is}} a slave owner. In an attempt to show Ophelia that her views on blacks <b>are</b> <b>wrong,</b> St. Clare purchases Topsy, a young black slave, and asks Ophelia to educate her.|$|E
5|$|It's {{strange to}} hear Uncle Tupelo {{mentioned}} {{because what we}} were doing was in such a long line of musical history. People <b>are</b> <b>wrong</b> in starting with us and saying we started anything because we were just picking up the ball, starting with Woody Guthrie and on to the early '60s and the Flying Burrito Brothers that we were influenced by. We didn't start a genre. We contributed to a long line of fairly good music. That's the way we looked at it at the time—doing what was right for the song.|$|E
5|$|Utilitarian philosopher John Stuart Mill criticised Kant for {{not realizing}} that moral laws are {{justified}} by a moral intuition based on utilitarian principles (that the greatest good for the greatest number ought to be sought). Mill argued that Kant's ethics could not explain why certain actions <b>are</b> <b>wrong</b> without appealing to utilitarianism. As basis for morality, Mill believed that his principle of utility has a stronger intuitive grounding than Kant's reliance on reason, and can better explain why certain actions are right or wrong.|$|E

5000|$|The {{architectural}} historian Nikolaus Pevsner {{was very}} critical of the building's architecture, saying: [...] "The scale <b>is</b> <b>wrong,</b> the symmetry <b>is</b> <b>wrong.</b> The proximity to a classical façade put up by the same firm {{at the same time}} <b>is</b> <b>wrong,</b> and the goings-on of a store behind such a façade (and below those twisted Tudor chimneys) <b>are</b> <b>wrongest</b> of all".|$|R

5|$|Each episode {{consists}} of three rounds. A team of four contestants starts the game; one player is eliminated after two rounds of play. For each question, the team has 60 seconds to unanimously agree on an answer; the available money decreases the longer it takes. Each contestant must enter the same response on their respective panel and then everyone must simultaneously lock in an answer and stop the clock. If the team answers the question correctly, they bank whatever money is left on the clock; if they <b>are</b> <b>wrong,</b> or if time runs out, their bank is reduced by half.|$|E
5|$|Sasuke is a {{recurring}} {{character in the}} Naruto light novels. He is the protagonist of Naruto Jinraiden: The Day the Wolf Howled, which explores Sasuke's reflections after Itachi's death and his decision to destroy Konoha. In Sakura Hiden, an older and reformed Sasuke continues his redemption journey, but returns to Konohagakure on hearing rumors that Sakura has been abducted. There, he learns the rumors <b>are</b> <b>wrong,</b> and parts on friendly terms with Sakura. In Akatsuki Hiden, Sasuke meets two children who tell him stories about Akatsuki, {{and the three of}} them discuss Itachi's legacy. He is also the protagonist of Sasuke Shinden, where he agrees to aid Konohagakure by investigating a rash of disappearances. With help of Taka and a ninja named Sai, Sasuke is able to solve the case and, after receiving a letter from Naruto, he decides to return to the village to meet Sakura.|$|E
5|$|After soccer practice, Bart {{waits for}} Homer {{to pick him}} up, though his father has forgotten. When Homer finally remembers, he reasons to an angered Bart that they should just both admit they <b>are</b> <b>wrong</b> and try to put the issue behind them. Later, Bart views a {{commercial}} for a mentor program called The Bigger Brothers, which pairs up fatherless boys with positive male role models. Still angry at Homer, Bart goes to the agency {{pretending to be a}} young boy whose father was a drunken gambler who abandoned him. Bart's story is so sad that the receptionist pairs him up with their best Bigger Brother, a military test pilot named Tom. The two spend time together doing a variety of activities, though Bart begins to feel guilty over taking up Tom's time despite not actually being fatherless. Eventually, Homer finds out about Bart's Bigger Brother and confronts Bart for it. Homer then decides to go to the Bigger Brothers Agency to get revenge by being assigned with a replacement son; a young poor boy named Pepi. Just like Tom and Bart, Homer and Pepi spend time together doing activities.|$|E

I <b>am</b> <b>wrong...</b> I <b>am</b> <b>wrong</b> and I know that my words and my actions <b>were</b> <b>wrong</b> and I'm not trying to justify {{that in any way}} – I <b>am</b> <b>wrong,</b> and the people who have complained <b>are</b> not <b>wrong.</b> They're just insulted by me and I completely take that criticism.|$|R
5000|$|When {{people thought}} the Earth was flat, they <b>were</b> <b>wrong.</b> When people thought the Earth was spherical, they <b>were</b> <b>wrong.</b> But {{if you think}} that {{thinking}} the Earth is spherical <b>is</b> just as <b>wrong</b> as thinking the Earth is flat, then your view <b>is</b> <b>wronger</b> than both of them put together.|$|R

25|$|In 2001, he {{attained}} significant {{attention by}} publishing The Skeptical Environmentalist, a controversial book whose main thesis {{is that many}} of the most-publicized claims and predictions on environmental issues <b>are</b> <b>wrong.</b>|$|E
25|$|The Sarvadarśanasaṃgraha with commentaries by Madhavacharya {{describes}} the Charvakas as critical of Vedas, materialists without morals and ethics. To Charvakas, the text states, the Vedas suffered from several faults – errors in transmission across generations, untruth, self-contradiction and tautology. The Charvakas {{pointed out the}} disagreements, debates and mutual rejection by karmakanda Vedic priests and jñānakanda Vedic priests, as proof that {{either one of them}} is wrong or both <b>are</b> <b>wrong,</b> as both cannot be right.|$|E

25|$|Many of the {{characters}} of the Fourth Expedition—Parkhill, Captain Wilder, and Hathaway—re-appear in later stories. This is the first story that focuses on a central motif of The Martian Chronicles: the colonization of the Western frontier in the United States. Like Spender, Bradbury's message is that some types of colonization are right and others <b>are</b> <b>wrong.</b> Trying to recreate Earth is viewed as wrong, but an approach that respects the fallen civilization that is being replaced is right.|$|E
25|$|Books often {{describe}} Cavendish's work as {{a measurement}} of either the gravitational constant (G) or the Earth's mass. Since these {{are related to the}} Earth's density by a trivial web of algebraic relations, none of these sources <b>are</b> <b>wrong,</b> but they do not match the exact word choice of Cavendish, and this mistake has been pointed out by several authors. Cavendish's stated goal was to measure the Earth's density, although his result obviously calculates G in order to do so.|$|E
25|$|If {{multiple}} {{models of}} natural law make exactly the same testable predictions, they are equivalent {{and there is no}} need for parsimony to choose a preferred one. For example, Newtonian, Hamiltonian and Lagrangian classical mechanics are equivalent. Physicists have no interest in using Occam's razor to say the other two <b>are</b> <b>wrong.</b> Likewise, there is no demand for simplicity principles to arbitrate between wave and matrix formulations of quantum mechanics. Science often does not demand arbitration or selection criteria between models that make the same testable predictions.|$|E

25|$|Another Byzantine treatise, that of {{the thirteenth}} century doctor Nicholas Myrepsos, {{remained}} the principal pharmaceutical code of the Parisian medical faculty until 1651, while the Byzantine tract of Demetrios Pepagomenos (thirteenth century) on gout was translated and published in Latin by the post-Byzantine humanist Marcus Musurus, in Venice in 1517. Therefore, {{it could be argued}} that previous misrepresentations about Byzantium being simply a 'carrier' of Ancient Medical knowledge to the Renaissance <b>are</b> <b>wrong.</b> It is known, for example, that the late twelfth-century Italian physician (Roger of Salerno) was influenced by the treatises of the Byzantine doctors Aëtius and Alexander of Tralles as well as Paul of Aegina.|$|E
25|$|People {{often say}} that {{machines}} enslave man and that technology dehumanises society, but they <b>are</b> <b>wrong!</b> It is the manufacturer that enslaves man. It {{is to the}} manufacturer that man is condemned to a life sentence of forced labour. The manufacturer enslaves man, but robots free us. The only reason that technology is dehumanising society is because humans still {{have to work with}} the machines used for forced labour, or because they must clock in to where the forced labour takes place. That is the problem, humans and machines should not be mixed together. Humans are designed to spend their time in places of fulfilment, while machines are designed to function in the workplace, under the supervision of robots and computers.|$|E
25|$|An {{application}} {{for permission to}} bring a judicial review was made by Lutfur Rahman in July 2015, with a hearing held on 26 January 2016. The application {{was made in the}} hopes of reducing Rahman incapacity from holding elective office from five years to three years. While maintaining that many of the election court findings <b>are</b> <b>wrong,</b> the application acknolwedged that challenges may only be made on those conclusions which amount to error of law. The court findings that canvassers were paid in contravention of section 111 of the 1983 Act, and that Rahman is guilty of bribery personally and by his agent in contravention of section 113 were challenged on the basis that they were reached without any sufficient evidence such that it amounts to an error of law, and that the Commissioner erred when interpretating the provision on bribery. A challenge was made to the finding of undue spiritual influence on the basis that the Commissioner conclusion was in contravention to authority, and incompatible with Article 9 or Article 10 of the European Convention on Human Rights, or both. The divisional court of Lloyd LJ and Supperstone J granted Rahman permission to launch a judicial review on the undue spiritual influence finding because the law had not been tested for over a century, but rejected the other two challenges, as a result leaving in place Rahman's five years ban from elective office even if he is successful in a judicial review. The judicial review application was closed following the non-payment of court fee.|$|E

50|$|However, his {{predictions}} {{have also}} proved to <b>be</b> <b>wrong</b> on certain occasions. His prediction of a lunar eclipse on March 21, 1828 <b>was</b> <b>wrong</b> by fifteen minutes. His prediction {{of the character}} of the eclipse also proved to <b>be</b> <b>wrong</b> as the eclipse was only a three-eighths eclipse and not five-eighths as he had predicted.|$|R
2500|$|However, {{the damage}} had been done, and Cambridge, UK, 'declared victory': Levhari <b>was</b> <b>wrong,</b> Samuelson <b>was</b> <b>wrong,</b> Solow <b>was</b> <b>wrong,</b> MIT <b>was</b> <b>wrong</b> and {{therefore}} neoclassical economics <b>was</b> <b>wrong.</b> As a result {{there are some}} groups of economists who have abandoned neoclassical economics for their own refinements of classical economics. In the United States, on the other hand, mainstream economics goes on as if the controversy had never occurred. Macroeconomics textbooks discuss 'capital' {{as if it were}} a well-defined concept [...] which it is not, except in a very special one-capital-good world (or under other unrealistically restrictive conditions). The problems of heterogeneous capital goods have also been ignored in the 'rational expectations revolution' and in virtually all econometric work." ...|$|R
25|$|Research on {{alcoholism}} within families has leaned towards exploring {{issues that}} <b>are</b> <b>wrong</b> {{in the community}} rather than potential strengths or positives. When researchers conduct research that helps communities, it can be easier for community members {{to identify with the}} positives and work towards a path of resilience. Flawed research design in adult children of alcoholics (ACOA) research showed ACOAs were psychologically damaged. Some flawed research designs include using ACOAs as part of the control group and comparing them to other ACOAs within the same study. This may have caused some limitations in the study that were not listed. When comparing ACOAs to other ACOAs, it is difficult to interpret accurate results that show certain behaviors in the group studied. Research that has been conducted more recently has used control groups with non-ACOAs to see whether the behaviors align with prior research. This research has shown that behaviors were similar between non-ACOAs and ACOAs. An 18 year-long study compared children of alcoholics (COA) to other COAs. In failing to use non-COAs as controls, we miss an opportunity to see if the negative aspects of a person are related to having an alcoholic parent, or are they just simply a fact of life. For example, in Werner’s study, he found that 30% of COAs were committing serious delinquencies. This data would have been more usable if they had viewed the percentage of those committing crimes when compared to non-ACOAs. In a study conducted in a midwestern university, researchers found that {{there was no significant difference}} between ACOA and non-ACOA students. One of the main differences was the student’s views on how they connect their past experiences with their current social-emotional functioning. Students who were ACOAs did not demonstrate issues with their perspective on their interpersonal issues any more than the non-ACA students. However, this study did show that there were other underlying problems in the family structure that may attribute to the perception of not being well adjusted in life.|$|E
500|$|In September 1981, Ford advised Reagan against {{succumbing to}} Wall Street demands and follow his own {{agenda for the}} {{economic}} policies of the US during an appearance on Good Morning America: [...] "He shouldn't let the gurus of Wall Street decide what the economic {{future of this country}} is going to be. They <b>are</b> <b>wrong</b> in my opinion." [...] On October 20, 1981, Ford stated stopping the Reagan administration's Saudi arms package could have a large negative impact to American relations in the Middle East during a news conference.|$|E
500|$|It {{has also}} been claimed that certain former pieces of {{evidence}} for evolution which are now considered out-of-date and erroneous, such as Ernst Haeckel's 19th-century comparative drawings of embryos, used to illustrate his recapitulation theory ("ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny"), were not merely errors but frauds. Molecular biologist Jonathan Wells [...] criticizes biology textbooks by alleging that they continue to reproduce such evidence {{after it has been}} debunked. In response, the National Center for Science Education notes that none of the textbooks reviewed by Wells makes the claimed error, as Haeckel's drawings are shown in a historical context with discussion about why they <b>are</b> <b>wrong,</b> and the accurate modern drawings and photos used in the textbooks are misrepresented by Wells.|$|E
5000|$|The Frege-Geach problem [...] - [...] {{named for}} Peter Geach, who {{developed}} {{it from the}} writings of Gottlob Frege [...] - [...] claims that by subscribing to Expressivism one necessarily accepts that the meaning of [...] "It <b>is</b> <b>wrong</b> to tell lies" [...] {{is different from the}} meaning of the [...] "it <b>is</b> <b>wrong</b> to tell lies" [...] part of the conditional [...] "If it <b>is</b> <b>wrong</b> to tell lies, then it <b>is</b> <b>wrong</b> to get your little brother to lie", and that therefore Expressivism is an inadequate explanation for moral language.|$|R
