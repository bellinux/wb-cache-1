He {{believed}} that scientists have an individual moral responsibility <b>and,</b> <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> Hippocratic Oath provides {{a code of}} conduct for physicians, he thought that scientists should have their own code of moral conduct, a Hippocratic Oath for scientists. During his tenure {{as president of the}} Pugwash conferences, Rotblat nominated Israeli nuclear technician Mordechai Vanunu for the Nobel Peace Prize every year from 1988 to 2004. Vanunu had disclosed the extent of Israel's nuclear weapons programme and consequently spent 18 years in prison, including more than 11 years in solitary confinement.|$|E
5|$|It {{was in the}} 1999–2000 {{season that}} the Colorado Avalanche played their first game in the new Pepsi Center that cost US$160million. Milan Hejduk scored the first goal of a 2–1 victory against the Boston Bruins on October 13, 1999. The Avalanche {{finished}} {{the season with a}} 42–28–11–1 record for 96 points and won the Northwest Division. Before the playoffs, the Avalanche strengthened their defense for a run towards the Stanley Cup. On March 6, 2000, the Boston Bruins traded future Hockey Hall of Fame defenseman Ray Bourque and forward Dave Andreychuk to Colorado for Brian Rolston, Martin Grenier, Samuel Pahlsson and a first round draft pick. Bourque, who had been a Bruin since 1979, requested a trade to a contender for a chance to win the Stanley Cup. However, <b>and</b> <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> year before, Colorado lost in the Conference Finals against the Dallas Stars in a seven games after beating the Phoenix Coyotes and Detroit Red Wings in five games.|$|E

25|$|In their match, Lenglen {{lost the}} first set 6–2 <b>and</b> <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> second set got underway, she began {{coughing}} and burst into tears, unable to continue.

Unaccustomed to such treatment, a devastated Lenglen went home.|$|E
25|$|Before {{the strike}} began (and perhaps {{while it was}} going on), some miners {{proposed}} sending a delegation to the capital, Bucharest, to discuss their problems with {{the leadership of the}} Romanian Communist Party, but this option was discarded as they probably thought any split to two locations would fatally undermine their cause.

At the 1992 Australian Open, Sabatini lost to Mary Joe Fernández in the semifinals with a score of 6–1, 6–4. At the 1992 French Open, Sabatini lost a tight match to Seles in the semifinals where In the third and decisive set, Sabatini was leading 4–2, but Seles rallied from behind to beat Sabatini. At Wimbledon of that year, Sabatini looked to reach a second {{consecutive}} Wimbledon final, <b>and</b> <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> previous year, Sabatini found Graf standing in her way, only {{this time in the}} semifinals.

Blue Beetle ends up unconscious and Max captures him, heading to the teleporter and leaving the JLI behind. When Blue Beetle is in captivity, Max injects him with an unknown substance. Tortured, he remembers Max's existence as the man who killed Ted Kord and destroyed his legacy. Jaime eventually manages to send a signal {{to the rest of the}} JLI to lead them to Max's headquarters. He breaks out of the laboratory and attacks Max, who, having discovered the weaknesses of the Blue Scarab, zaps Jaime with a special beam <b>and,</b> <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> JLI arrives, shoots him in the head with a blaster, apparently killing him in the same manner as his predecessor.|$|E
25|$|Boltzmann {{accomplished}} the feat of {{showing that the}} second law of thermodynamics is only a statistical fact. The gradual disordering of energy {{is analogous to the}} disordering of an initially ordered pack of cards under repeated shuffling, <b>and</b> <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> cards will finally return to their original order if shuffled a gigantic number of times, so the entire universe must some-day regain, by pure chance, the state from which it first set out. (This optimistic coda to the idea of the dying universe becomes somewhat muted when one attempts to estimate the timeline which will probably elapse before it spontaneously occurs.) The tendency for entropy increase seems to cause difficulty to beginners in thermodynamics, but is easy to understand {{from the standpoint of the}} theory of probability. Consider two ordinary dice, with both sixes face up. After the dice are shaken, the chance of finding these two sixes face up is small (1 in 36); thus one can say that the random motion (the agitation) of the dice, like the chaotic collisions of molecules because of thermal energy, causes the less probable state to change to one that is more probable. With millions of dice, like the millions of atoms involved in thermodynamic calculations, the probability of their all being sixes becomes so vanishingly small that the system must move to one of the more probable states. However, mathematically the odds of all the dice results not being a pair sixes is also as hard as the ones of all of them being sixes, and since statistically the data tend to balance, one in every 36 pairs of dice will tend to be a pair of sixes, and the cards -when shuffled- will sometimes present a certain temporary sequence order even if in its whole the deck was disordered.|$|E

500|$|In {{a review}} for The Observer, Leo Robson found the novel to be {{somewhat}} underwhelming, stating that [...] "It is disappointing, given {{the vitality of the}} novel's setting and set-up, that Miller fails to achieve corresponding dynamism in the development of plot and character", adding that [...] "as a prose writer, Miller appears averse to taking risks, which means no pratfalls – but no glory either". He found the [...] "engineer's progress and his setbacks are narrated in a patient, tight-lipped present tense, <b>and</b> <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> novel rarely concerns itself with anything that doesn't impinge on the destruction of Les Innocents, so it rarely deviates from its obsessive regime of description and dialogue". He did somewhat temper this, however, stating that [...] "It is one of the historical novel's advantages over the topical or journalistic novel that the benchmark is plausibility rather than verifiable authenticity. Success in this effort requires a capacity for immersion and a degree of imagination, and whatever his shortcomings as a prose writer and a storyteller, Andrew Miller is endowed with both." ...|$|E

[...] She often received small recognitions from students and faculty who were pleased and surprised, once getting a bouquet of flowers from a student. She said of the rediscovery, [...] "I was so ready for something fresh and exciting in my life.
