5|$|After the gubernatorial {{election}} in 1999, Louisville senator Dan Seum <b>announced</b> <b>he</b> would change his party affiliation from Democrat to Republican, citing his conservative voting history, including {{opposition to the}} state lottery, KERA, and abortion. This switch, which Patton learned of too late to intervene, equalized the number of Democrats and Republicans in the Senate. Six weeks later, Paducah senator Bob Leeper <b>announced</b> <b>he</b> would also change his party affiliation. Patton traveled to Paducah and met with Leeper, {{but was unable to}} convince him to remain a Democrat.

Leeper's switch gave Republicans a majority in the Senate {{for the first time in}} the state's history. David Williams was elected President of the Senate, and held the Republican majority together effectively. Consequently, Patton faced a difficult task in maneuvering his agenda through a divided General Assembly.|$|E
