50|$|The general {{methodology}} for the addiction studies consisted of first getting subjects drug-free (with apparent exceptions for cigarettes and coffee), and then attempting to induce addiction by regular administration (orally or injected) {{of the substance}} of interest. Addiction {{was determined by the}} occurrence of <b>abstinence</b> <b>symptoms</b> when administration of the substance stopped. Sometimes a different substance (e.g., methadone) would be administered at the peak of withdrawal to determine if it alleviated symptoms. Following the evaluation of this cold turkey withdrawal, subjects were then usually more gradually weaned off of the substance being tested.|$|E

A dosage of 1-2 micrograms per kilogram of body weight was determined to induce [...] "striking effects" [...] (mood change, perceptual distortion, pupil dilation). Four experiments then quantified tolerance effects (the extent to which repeated doses of LSD cause a reduction in the effect of a subsequent dose). Experiment 4 included 77 consecutive days with doses of 1.55 micrograms/kg (corresponding to a dose of 140 micrograms for someone weighing 200 pounds), although the full sequence of LSD doses was at least a week or two longer than this due to the tolerance protocol. Tolerance to LSD developed rapidly; by day 3 the subjective effects were significantly lessened, and later in the experiments subjects simply read and watched TV normally. In the middle of the experiment, even a quadruple dose (600 micrograms or so) had little effect. Tolerance also disappeared rapidly; after no LSD had been given for 3 days, a subsequent dose again had a large effect. There were no <b>abstinence</b> <b>symptoms</b> after LSD administration stopped (i.e., no physical dependence).|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background This {{study is}} a {{systematic}} evaluation of a novel tobacco product, electronic cigarettes (ECIGs) using a two-site, four-arm, 6 -month, parallel-group randomized controlled trial (RCT) with a follow-up to 9  months. Virginia Commonwealth University is the primary site and Penn State University is the secondary site. This RCT design {{is important because it}} is informed by analytical work, clinical laboratory results, and qualitative/quantitative findings regarding the specific ECIG products used. Methods Participants (N[*]=[*] 520) will be randomized across sites and must be healthy smokers of > 9 cigarettes for at least one year, who have not had a quit attempt in the prior month, are not planning to quit in the next 6  months, and are interested in reducing cigarette intake. Participants will be randomized into one of four 24 -week conditions: a cigarette substitute that does not produce an inhalable aerosol; or one of three ECIG conditions that differ by nicotine concentration 0, 8, or 36  mg/ml. Blocked randomization will be accomplished with a 1 : 1 : 1 : 1 ratio of condition assignments at each site. Specific aims are to: characterize ECIG influence on toxicants, biomarkers, health indicators, and disease risk; determine tobacco <b>abstinence</b> <b>symptom</b> and adverse event profile associated with real-world ECIG use; and examine the influence of ECIG use on conventional tobacco product use. Liquid nicotine concentration-related differences on these study outcomes are predicted. Participants and research staff in contact with participants will be blinded to the nicotine concentration in the ECIG conditions. Discussion Results from this study will inform knowledge concerning ECIG use as well as demonstrate a model that may be applied to other novel tobacco products. The model of using prior empirical testing of ECIG devices should be considered in other RCT evaluations. Trial registration TRN: NCT 02342795, registered December 16, 2014...|$|R
40|$|The author {{found no}} report {{in respect of}} {{narcotic}} ejection {{in the process of}} curing human addicts of narcotic poisoning. Dr. Y. Sakai succeeded in devising a new cure (I. M.), which is being used to exterminate the morphine habit. On the other hand, the author administered intravenous injections at a concentration of 70 % dextrose solution, and found another method of new treatment. Hence, the author inquired into the quantitative variations of morphine ejection into the urine when the drug habit was removed by venous injection of I. M. or 70 % dextrose solution. As a result, it was found that during the treatment of morphine poisoning the patient, who had been discharging morphine prior to the administration of I. M. (or 70 % dext. solu.) injection, discharged it more; and in many cases, in which there had been no discharge before the treatment, such discharge through the urine commenced after the administration of I. M. injection. Those invalids who ceased to eject morphine through the urine {{a few days after the}} beginning of the treatment and whose <b>abstinence</b> <b>symptoms</b> disappeared at the same time were completely cured in a short space of time; whereas those who did not emit morphine during the treatment period began to show marked <b>abstinence</b> <b>symptoms</b> and seemed not to be cured. Again, some patients who were clinically found cured with all <b>abstinence</b> <b>symptoms</b> disappearing still continued to discharge morphine for a long time. On the whole, however, the greater part of <b>abstinence</b> <b>symptoms</b> disappeared in all cases when, after I. M. injection, morphine ceased to bedischarged into the urine. In view of these results, the author concluded that, because accumulated morphine is discharged out of the body through the urine, morphine poisoning is cured...|$|E
40|$|In the {{never ending}} {{search for a}} {{completely}} non-addictive substitute for morphine, May and Eddy (1959) recently described a new benzomorphan derivative called phenazocine (dl- 2 ’-hydroxy- 5, 9 -dimethyl- 2 -phenethyl- 6, 7 -benzomorphan hydrobromide) which they re-ported to be approximately 9 times as potent as morphine as an analgesic in mice. Preliminary work reported by Deneau and co-workers (1959) indicated that doses of phenazocine of 10 mg/kg and above can suppress morphine <b>abstinence</b> <b>symptoms</b> in morphine addicted monkeys. Fraser and Isbell (1959, 1960) evaluated phenazocine for its addictive properties in man and reported that phenazocine is capable of both supporting mor-phine addiction in man and of producing (lirect addiction in its own right.

Method: A sample of 68 adult smokers with mildly elevated depressive symptoms (M 43. 8 years of age; 48. 5 % were women; 72. 7 % were African American) seeking smoking cessation treatment were randomized to receive either BATS paired with standard treatment (ST) smoking cessation strategies including nicotine replacement therapy (n 35) or ST alone including nicotine replace-ment therapy (n 33). BATS and ST were matched for contact time and included 8 sessions of group-based treatment. Quit date was assigned to occur at Session 4 for each treatment condition.

40|$|We {{investigated}} {{the role of}} metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs), and related intracellular second messengers, {{in the development of}} morphine tolerance and dependence. The mGluRs are divided into three groups: group I mGluRs are positively coupled to phosphatidylinositol (PI) hydrolysis, while group II and III mGluRs are negatively coupled to cyclic adensoine- 3 $ sp prime$, 5 $ sp prime$-monophosphate (cAMP) production. Opioid receptors are also coupled to these same systems, and have been shown to elicit changes in these messenger systems during chronic treatment. We showed that chronic intracerebroventricular (i. c. v.) administration of selective group II and III mGluR antagonists concurrently with subcutaneous (s. c.) morphine significantly reduced the severity of precipitated withdrawal symptoms. Conversely, acute i. c. v. injection of a selective group II mGluR antagonist just prior to the precipitation of withdrawal significantly exacerbated the severity of <b>abstinence</b> <b>symptoms.</b> In addition, acute i. c. v. injection of a selective group II mGluR agonist just prior to the precipitation of withdrawal significantly reduced <b>abstinence</b> <b>symptoms.</b> From these results we hypothesized that chronic opioid treatment may induce a desensitization of group II mGluRs. We also demonstrated that chronic i. c. v. infusion of a selective group I mGluR antagonist concurrently with s. c. morphine significantly attenuated the precipitated withdrawal syndrome. In addition, we showed that chronic i. c. v. antagonism of $ delta$-opioid receptors with a highly selective antagonist also decreased the development of morphine dependence, as well as tolerance. Since both group I mGluRs and $ delta$-opioid receptors are positively coupled to PI hydrolysis, further evidence for a role of products of PI hydrolysis in the development of morphine dependence was obtained when we showed that selective chronic inhibition of protein kinase C (PKC) activation, as well as selective chronic inhibition of intracellular Ca$ sp{ 2 +}$ release, concurrently with morphine treatment significantly reduced the severity of <b>abstinence</b> <b>symptoms.</b> Thus, compensatory changes usually elicited by chronic opioid treatment may be counteracted by antagonizing receptors positively coupled to PI hydrolysis, as well as by inhibiting products of PI hydrolysis. In the General Discussion, we propose a model based on the possible interaction of mGluRs and opioid receptors, via related intracellular second messengers, to explain the development of morphine dependence...|$|E
40|$|Nicotine {{dependence}} {{has been}} linked to Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) symptoms in both clinical and general populations. This behavioral pharmacology study used a within-subject double-blind crossover design to test the effects of atomoxetine, a medication for ADHD, on nicotine <b>abstinence</b> <b>symptoms.</b> Fifty non-treatment seeking smokers (3 ̆e 15 cigs/day) completed a baseline session when they were smoking as usual, and then two laboratory testing sessions after overnight abstinence and treatment with either 7 days of atomoxetine (1. 2 mg/kg) or placebo. During each laboratory session, participants completed subjective measures of <b>abstinence</b> <b>symptoms</b> and performed neurocognitive tasks. Atomoxetine as compared to placebo was found to be associated with a reduction in abstinence-induced subjective withdrawal symptoms. A significant interaction between atomoxetine and stimulation smoking motive on self-reported smoking urges was found. Atomoxetine had greater efficacy at reducing smoking urges amongst individuals scoring highest on this stimulation smoking motive. However, atomoxetine had no effect on any of the cognitive tasks employed in the study. Very few significant interactions were observed from the mixed effects models with the neurocognitive tasks; however the effects were very weak. There was no main effect of treatment or significant interactions on smoking behavior, nor were there any pharmacogenetic interactions observed in this study. Overall, atomoxetine seems to have a marginal effect at reducing withdrawal symptoms and may reduce cravings to smoke among smokers who use nicotine to increase arousal. ...|$|E

40|$|Introduction: Attention-deficit/hyperactivity {{disorder}} (ADHD) is {{a common}} comorbid disorder in patients suffering from substance use disorder (SUD). Individuals with co-occurring SUD and ADHD {{are more likely than}} SUD patients without ADHD to have developed SUD at a younger age, be polysubstance users, and need inpatient treatment more often. The present study investigates whether individuals with polysubstance use disorder who remain abstinent for a year after entering treatment have a more substantial reduction in ADHD symptoms than those who relapsed and controls. Material and methods: Subjects were SUD patients (N= 115) and healthy controls (N= 34). ADHD symptoms were assessed using the adult ADHD Self-Report Scale (ASRS). Substance use was assessed by self-reports on the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT) and the Drug Use Disorders Identification Test (DUDIT). Participants were defined as having relapsed if they had an AUDIT scoreâ¥ 8 or a DUDIT scoreâ¥ 2 for women andâ¥ 6 for men. Results: Patients who remained abstinent for one year reported a substantial reduction of ADHD symptoms compared to patients who relapsed and controls. Conclusions: <b>Abstinence</b> alleviates ADHD <b>symptoms</b> among patients with polysubstance use disorder. We suggest that confirmation of an ADHD diagnosis should follow a period of abstinence to avoid identification of false-positive cases.

A prospective, non-randomized comparison study with flexible dosing was undertaken in a large teaching maternity hospital in Australia. Twenty-five infants in the groups of buprenorphine-, methadone- and control non-opioid-exposed infants were compared (total n = 75 infants). Oral morphine sulphate (1 mg/ml) was administered every 4 h to opioid agonist-exposed infants. Modified Finnegan Withdrawal Scale (MFWS) scores determined dosing: score of 8 – 10 : 0. 5 mg/kg/day, 11 – 13 : 0. 7 mg/kg/day and 14 +: 0. 9 mg/kg/day. Withdrawal score, amount of morphine administered and length of hospital stay, {{were used to assess}} NAS over a 4 -week follow-up period. No controls achieved a score higher than 7 on the MFWS. There {{was no significant difference in}} the percentage of infants requiring treatment between methadone (60 %) and buprenorphine (48 %) infants.

SDE children had increased risk of neonatal <b>abstinence</b> <b>symptoms</b> but were somatic healthy and had no growth restriction and were performing well academically. Almost all children in both groups met the criteria of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). Conclusion: Children exposed to drugs are somatic healthy but have increased risk of neuroimpairments such as ADHD...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{main cause}} of relapse in smokers {{attempting}} to quit is inability to resist urges to smoke. Pharmacotherapy ameliorates but does not entirely prevent urges to smoke when abstinent, so other methods to resist urges to smoke might be helpful. Exercise is effective, but aerobic exercise is often impractical when urges strike. Two techniques, body scan and isometric exercise, {{have been shown to}} reduce urge intensity and nicotine withdrawal symptoms in temporarily abstinent smokers. It is unclear whether they would be used or effective in typical smokers attempting to quit. METHODS: In a pilot trial set in a UK smoking cessation clinic, 20 smokers were randomised to receive emails containing. mp 3 files and. pdf illustrations of the instructions for doing the body scan and isometric exercises. Twenty smokers received no other intervention, although all 40 were receiving weekly behavioural support and nicotine replacement therapy. Carbon monoxide confirmed <b>abstinence,</b> nicotine withdrawal <b>symptoms,</b> urges to smoke, and use of the techniques to resist urges were recorded weekly for four weeks after quit day. RESULTS: 60 - 80 % of quitters reported using the isometric exercises each week and 40 - 70 % reported using the body scan to deal with urges. On average, these techniques were rated as 'slightly helpful' for controlling the urges. There were no large or significant differences in withdrawal symptoms or urge intensity between the two groups. The risk ratio and 95 % confidence interval for exercises compared with controls for prolonged confirmed abstinence at four weeks was 0. 82 (0. 44 - 1. 53). 81 % of quitters intended to continue using isometric exercises and 25 % body scan, while 81 % and 50 % respectively would recommend using these techniques to others trying to stop. CONCLUSION: Isometric exercises, {{and to a lesser extent}} body scan, were popular and perceived as somewhat helpful by quitters. The trial showed that these techniques were used and a larger trial could now be developed to examine the influence of the methods on reducing urges to smoke and increasing abstinence...|$|R
40|$|Non-medical use of {{anabolic}} androgenic steroids (AAS) {{has been}} linked to various psychological and behavioural complications in case and survey reports. Judging from these reports, the symptoms most consistently associated with AAS use are extreme irritability, increased aggressiveness and mood swings. There are also a limited number of reports connecting AAS-associated aggressivity with violent acts including homicide, while reports of self-injurious behaviour associated with use of AAS are extremely rare. With the objective to evaluate the possible role of AAS-related behavioural changes for outwardly or self-directed violence, violent acts committed by AAS users and premature death among users of AAS, were studied by reviewing autopsy and police reports, court records, forensic psychiatric evaluations and medical records. In a subset of AAS-using suicide victims further information was gained by means of psychological autopsy, i. e. semi-structured interviews with survivors. Hypotheses regarding the effects of AAS on mental processes brought out by observations in the medicolegal studies were tested in experimental animal studies. Different patterns of violence were associated with different phases of AAS use that in turn were associated with specific patterns of psychological changes. Mood swings, impulsive aggression with violent outbursts resulting in violence towards other persons - including homicide - or damage of property were associated with current use of AAS in subjects with a history of prolonged AAS use. The same phase of AAS use was also associated with homicidal death, impulsive suicide and death from impulsive intake of high amounts of analgesics in combination with benzodiazepines and/or alcohol without a clear suicidal intent. A mental state dominated by depressive symptoms, suicide with high suicidal intent and execution-like homicides in response to perceived humiliation were associated with AAS <b>abstinence.</b> Hypomania-like <b>symptoms</b> and planned criminal activity were associated with short-time intake of AAS. In most but not all cases in which a detailed background history was obtained, pre-existing psychopathology and/or abuse of other psychotropic drugs was reported. Acute influence of pharmaceuticals/illicit drugs and/or alcohol was also prevalent. In eight cases a mixed substance abuse was established after the use of AAS commenced. Administration of AAS at low doses resulted in a reduction of vigilance and fear in rats. High-dose treatment of AAS resulted in alterations in dopaminergic, serotonergic and cholinergic systems suggestive of increased neuronal activity in brain areas regulating mood, emotion and motivation. The observations in the present study indicate that long-term use of AAS may aggravate pre-existing and possibly may precipitate new psychiatric symptoms to a degree of severe outwardly directed violence, completed suicide or lethal mixed substance abuse. The sporadic use of AAS by criminals suggests that early effects of AAS on mental processes may involve reduction of anxiety and/or enhancement of antagonism. The observations of early central stimulatory effects of AAS gain support from the experimental studies showing a reduction of vigilance and fear and increased dopaminergic and serotonergic activity in limbic structures in AAS-treated rats. The observed shift from early hypomania-like symptoms in early AAS career towards symptoms characterised by impulsive aggression, mood swings, and depression in later career, together with the experimentally demonstrated effects on neurotransmission, suggests that stimulatory effects of AAS may later fatigue central systems regulating mood, emotion and motivation...|$|R

40|$|The {{treatment}} of addiction to opiates, apart from {{psychological and social}} problems, has presented up to now a therapeutic prohlem. Various methods are used and each has its disadvantages. Residual symptoms of abstinence from opiates are present in all methods {{and there is a}} prolonged period of convalescence which seems {{to be one of the}} causes of relapses to addiction. Vitamin E however- has given remarkable results in aiding recovery from the withdrawal symptoms. With vitamin E the period of treatment is shortened, <b>abstinence</b> <b>symptoms</b> are bearable and the convalescent period is eliminated. Patients treated with vitamin E solely are in good health and spirits and appear contented. This treatment also seems to reduce 1 he number of relapses. The administration of vitamin E after a complete withdrawal from opium probably compensates Some of the opium's effects on the nervous system, and remedies the hypoxia of the tissues, thus restoring the patient to a normal physiological state...|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} a mixture of 1 part {{levallorphan}} and 10 parts levorphanol taken by mouth were studied in subjects needing symptomatic control of intractable pain. Res-ponse varied according to previous treatment with potent analgesics.

The incidence of side effects was high after long-term opiate therapy. These appeared to be levallorphan-induced <b>abstinence</b> <b>symptoms</b> and were also trouble-some when the mixture was given for long periods to patients who had not previously received addicting drugs. Side effects became evident after two or three weeks and render this drug combination unsuitable for clinical use. The introduction of nalorphine into clinical medicine by Eckenhoff, Elder and King (1951) made available a drug which could antagonize many of the side effects of morphine.

40|$|Aversive {{symptoms}} of abstinence from nicotine have been posited {{to lead to}} smoking relapse and research on temporal patterns of <b>abstinence</b> <b>symptoms</b> confirms this assumption. However, {{little is known about}} the association of symptom trajectories early after quitting with post-cessation smoking or about the differential effects of tonic (background) versus phasic (temptation-related) symptom trajectories on smoking status. The current study examined trajectories of urge and negative mood among 300 women using the nicotine patch during the first post-cessation week. Ecological momentary assessments collected randomly and during temptation episodes were analyzed using hierarchical linear modeling yielding four individual trajectory parameters: intercept (initial symptom level), linear slope (direction and rate of change), quadratic coefficient (curvature), and volatility (scatter). Early lapsers, who lapsed during the first post-cessation week, exhibited more severe tonic urge and phasic negative mood immediately after quitting, and more volatile tonic and phasic urge compared to abstainers. Late lapsers, who were abstinent during the first week but lapsed by 1 month, exhibited more severe tonic urge immediately after quitting compared to abstainers. These results demonstrate the importance of early post-cessation urge an...|$|E
40|$|Background A seven-year {{follow-up}} of heroin dependent patients {{treated in a}} buprenorphine-maintenance program combining contracted work/education and low tolerance for non-prescribed drug use. Gender-specific differences in outcome were analysed. Methods A consecutively admitted cohort of 135 men and 35 women, with eight years of heroin abuse/dependence on average was admitted to enhanced buprenorphine maintenance treatment. Standardized interviews, diagnostic assessments of psychiatric disorders and psychosocial conditions were conducted at admission and at follow-ups. Outcome associated with gender was reported for <b>abstinence,</b> retention, psychiatric <b>symptoms,</b> employment and criminal convictions. Results 148 patients started treatment. After seven years, 94 / 148 patients (64 %) were retained in the program, employed and abstinent from drugs and alcohol. Women had more continuous abstinence, retention and employment than men (76 % versus 60 %). After one year patients with a high-risk consumption of alcohol were no longer heavy consumers of alcohol and remained so throughout the study (p <. 001). All women regained custody of their children. At admission, {{more women than men}} had been admitted for psychiatric disorders (70 %/ 44 %) and to compulsory care for substance abuse (30 %/ 18 %). Initial gender differences of psychiatric co-morbidity decreased and were no longer significant after one year. More men than women had been imprisoned (62 % versus 27 %) or in non-institutional care (80 % versus 49 %). Criminal convictions were reduced from 1751 convictions at admission to 742 (58 %) after seven years. Eight patients in the entire cohort died over the 7 years (0. 7 % per year). One patient died in the completers group while still in the program (0. 1 % per year). Conclusions After seven years, two thirds of the patients in the program were abstinent and employed. Convictions ceased in the completers group. One patient died in the completers group. Women had superior long-term outcome compared to men: more continuous abstinence, employment and fewer convictions. Women also lived with their children to a higher extent than men. The positive outcome highlights the importance of maintaining high structure in combining pharmacological treatment with a focus on employment and psychological treatment and low tolerance for non-prescribed drug use...|$|R
40|$|The {{consumption}} of sweet food {{has increased in}} Sweden, as in other Western countries. The type of food item has changed. The sweet is dominated by soft drinks.

40|$|Evidence {{shows that}} the endocannabinoid system modulates the {{addictive}} properties of nicotine. In the present study, we hypothesized that spontaneous withdrawal resulting from removal of chronically implanted transdermal nicotine patches is regulated by the endocannabinoid system. A 7 -day nicotine dependence procedure (5. 2 mg/rat/day) elicited occurrence of reliable nicotine <b>abstinence</b> <b>symptoms</b> in Wistar rats. Somatic and affective withdrawal signs were observed at 16 and 34 hours following removal of nicotine patches, respectively. Further behavioral manifestations including decrease in locomotor activity and increased weight gain also occurred during withdrawal. Expression of spontaneous nicotine withdrawal was accompanied by fluctuation in levels of the endocannabinoid anandamide (AEA) in several brain structures including the amygdala, the hippocampus, the hypothalamus and the prefrontal cortex. Conversely, levels of 2 - arachidonoyl-sn-glycerol were not significantly altered. Pharmacological inhibition of fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH), the enzyme responsible for the intracellular degradation of AEA, by URB 597 (0. 1 and 0. 3 mg/kg, i. p.), reduced withdrawalinduced anxiety as assessed by the elevated plus maze test and the shock-probe defensive burying paradigm, but did not prevent the occurrence of somatic signs. Together, {{the results indicate that}} pharmacological strategies aimed at enhancing endocannabinoid signaling may offer therapeutic advantages to treat the negative affective state produced by nicotine withdrawal, which is critical for the maintenance of tobacco use...|$|E
