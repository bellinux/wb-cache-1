T. erectofrons was assigned to Corythosaurus based largely on biometric information.

5|$|Cathodoluminescence (CL) — light {{emission}} excited by electron beam — {{is a process}} commonly observed in TV screens. An electron beam can be finely focused and scanned across the studied material. This technique is widely used to study defects in semiconductors and nanostructures with nanometer-scale spatial resolution. It would be beneficial to apply this technique to carbon nanotubes. However, no reliable CL, i.e. sharp peaks <b>assignable</b> to certain (n,m) indices, has been detected from carbon nanotubes yet.|$|E
5|$|Remains <b>assignable</b> to Paraceratherium {{have been}} found in early to late Oligocene (34–23 million years ago) {{formations}} across Eurasia, in modern-day China, Mongolia, India, Pakistan, Kazakhstan, Georgia, Turkey, Romania, Bulgaria, and the Balkans. Their distribution may be correlated with the palaeogeographic development of the Alpine-Himalayan mountain belt. The range of Paraceratherium finds implies that they inhabited a continuous landmass with a similar environment across it, but this is contradicted by palaeogeographic maps that show this area had various marine barriers, so the genus was successful in being widely distributed despite this. The fauna which coexisted with Paraceratherium included other rhinoceroses, artiodactyls, rodents, beardogs, weasels, hyaenodonts, nimravids and cats.|$|E
5|$|The Ehoie of Salmoneus' {{daughter}} Tyro {{provides the}} transition {{to the families of the}} male Aeolids. As king of Elis, Salmoneus forced his subjects to worship him as Zeus and simulated the god's thunder and lighting by dragging bronze cauldrons from his chariot and throwing torches through the air. The real Zeus destroyed king and subjects alike, but spared Tyro and conducted her to the house of her uncle Cretheus in Thessaly because she wrangled with her impious father. There she became enamoured of the river Enipeus, but Poseidon had his own designs upon Tyro and in the guise of the river lay with her, siring Neleus and Pelias. The brothers did not get along, and Zeus gave them different realms to rule: Pelias received as his lot Iolcos; to Neleus fell Pylos in the western Peloponnese. The house of Neleus now takes center-stage. Heracles sacked Pylos, killing all the male Neleids, save Nestor who was off in Gerenia, another Messenian city. Periclymenus, a son of Neleus to whom Poseidon had granted the ability to change shape, was Pylos' only bulwark against the onslaught of Heracles, and the Catalogue-poet granted him a brief aristeia which ended when Athena pointed out that the bee on Heracles' chariot was actually the Pylian defender. Following the account of Nestor's marriage and family, the contest for Neleus' daughter Pero was narrated. The father would give her hand to whoever could rustle the cattle of Iphicles from Phylace, a feat accomplished by Bias with the help of his brother Melampus. The poet then turned to the family of Pelias as the last <b>assignable</b> papyrus fragment from book 1 breaks off. It is likely that Tyro's children by Cretheus—Aeson, Pheres and Amythaon—followed, and there might have been room in the book to at least start the family of Cretheus' brother Athamas.|$|E

25|$|The {{theory of}} errors may {{be traced back to}} Roger Cotes's Opera Miscellanea (posthumous, 1722), but a memoir {{prepared}} by Thomas Simpson in 1755 (printed 1756) first applied the theory to the discussion of errors of observation.

Simpson also discusses continuous errors and describes a probability curve.|$|E

It is known that Artemisia had already left England by 1642, when the civil war was just starting. Nothing much is known about her subsequent movements. Historians know that in 1649 she was in Naples again, corresponding with Don Antonio Ruffo of Sicily, who became her mentor during this second Neapolitan period. The last known letter to her mentor is dated 1650 and makes clear that she still was fully active.|$|E
25|$|The {{earliest}} cypriniform fossils {{are already}} <b>assignable</b> {{to the living}} family Catostomidae; from the Paleocene of Alberta, they are roughly 60 million years old. During the Eocene (55-35 mya), catostomids and cyprinids spread throughout Asia. In the Oligocene, around 30 mya, advanced cyprinids began to out-compete catostomids wherever they were sympatric, causing a decline of the suckers. Cyprinids reached North America and Europe by about the same time, and Africa in the early Miocene (some 23-20 mya). The cypriniforms spread to North America through the Bering land bridge, which formed and disappeared again {{several times during the}} many millions of years of cypriniform evolution.|$|E
25|$|Costa, largely {{following}} Siebert, {{proposes that}} the following languages are assigned to SNEA: Massachusett, Narragansett, Mohegan-Pequot-Montauk (probably also including Western and Niantic), Quiripi-Naugatuck, Unquachog, and Loup A. Etchemin {{may also have been}} part of this group but the very small amount of material available precludes a more definitive conclusion. Costa outlines three sound changes that are innovations uniquely <b>assignable</b> to Proto-Eastern Algonquian, and hence constitute evidence for the subgrouping (the asterisk denotes a reconstructed sound in the proto-language: (a) palatalization of Proto-Eastern-Algonquian (PEA) *k; (b) merger of PEA consonant clusters *hr and *hx; (c) shift of word-final PEA *r to š, all of which occur in Massachusett phonology.|$|E
25|$|Conversely, an {{easement}} {{in gross}} benefits an individual or a legal entity, rather than a dominant estate. The easement can be for a personal use (for example, an easement to use a boat ramp) or a commercial use (for example, an easement to a railroad company to build and maintain a rail line across property). Historically, an {{easement in gross}} was neither <b>assignable</b> nor inheritable, but commercial easements are now freely transferable to a third party. They are divisible but must be exclusive (the original owner no longer uses it and exclusive to easement holder) and all holders of the easement must agree to divide. If subdivided, each subdivided parcel enjoys the easement.|$|E
25|$|Gradually the goldsmiths {{began to}} lend {{the money out}} {{on behalf of the}} depositor, which led to the {{development}} of modern banking practices; promissory notes (which evolved into banknotes) were issued for money deposited as a loan to the goldsmith. The goldsmith paid interest on these deposits. Since the promissory notes were payable on demand, and the advances (loans) to the goldsmith's customers were repayable over a longer time period, this was an early form of fractional reserve banking. The promissory notes developed into an <b>assignable</b> instrument which could circulate as a safe and convenient form of money backed by the goldsmith's promise to pay, allowing goldsmiths to advance loans with little risk of default. Thus, the goldsmiths of London became the forerunners of banking by creating new money based on credit.|$|E
25|$|Morphology {{has proved}} {{inadequate}} in providing characters for phylogenetic {{analyses of the}} subfamily Cricetinae, but the group appears to be monophyletic based on molecular analyses. The genus Phodopus {{is one of three}} well-supported lineages in Cricetinae, the other two being the genus Mesocricetus and the Cricetus-related group (Cricetus, Tscherskia, Allocricetulus, and Cricetulus). Analysis of chromosomes supports these three lineages. Phodopus is sister to all other Cricetinae (meaning that it is the first lineage to diverge in the clade). Using several molecular dating techniques, researchers have determined that the Phodopus lineage may have originated 8.5 to 12.2 million years ago (mya). Other genetic dating analyses suggest a somewhat earlier origination of 13.5–14.1 mya. Fossils <b>assignable</b> to the genus are unknown before about 2.5 million years ago, but failure to identify the remains accurately may contribute to the apparent lack of older fossils.|$|E
500|$|Apatosaurus ajax {{was named}} by Marsh in 1877 after Ajax, a hero from Greek mythology. Marsh {{designated}} the incomplete, juvenile skeleton YPM1860 as its holotype. The species is less studied then Brontosaurus and A.louisae, especially {{because of the}} incomplete nature of the holotype. In 2005 many specimens {{in addition to the}} holotype were found <b>assignable</b> to A.ajax, YPM1840, NSMT-PV 20375, YPM1861, and AMNH460. The specimens date from the late Kimmeridgian to the early Tithonian ages. In 2015 only the A.ajax holotype YPM1860 assigned to the species, with AMNH460 found either to be within Brontosaurus, or potentially its own taxon. However, YPM1861 and NSMT-PV 20375 only differed in a few characteristics, and cannot be distinguished specifically or generically from A.ajax. YPM1861 is the holotype of [...] "Atlantosaurus" [...] immanis, which means it might be a junior synonym of A.ajax.|$|E

500|$|The genus Sarcoramphus, {{which today}} {{contains}} only the king vulture, had a wider {{distribution in the}} past. The Kern vulture (Sarcoramphus kernense), lived in southwestern North America during the mid-Pliocene (Piacenzian), some 3.5–2.5 million years ago). It was a little-known component of the Blancan/Delmontian faunal stages. The only material is a broken distal humerus fossil, found at Pozo Creek, Kern County, California. As per Loye H. Miller's original description, [...] "ompared with [...] the type conforms in general form and curvature except for its greater size and robustness." [...] The large span in time between {{the existence of the}} two species suggests that the Kern vulture might be distinct, but as the fossil is somewhat damaged and rather non-diagnostic, even assignment to this genus is not completely certain. During the Late Pleistocene, another species probably <b>assignable</b> to the genus, Sarcoramphus fisheri, occurred in Peru. A supposed king vulture relative from Quaternary cave deposits on Cuba turned out to be bones of the eagle-sized hawk Buteogallus borrasi (formerly in Titanohierax).|$|E

2500|$|An agent {{entrusted}} by {{a principal}} with {{the possession of}} goods is generally recognized as having a sufficient interest in the goods to enable him to maintain an action against a third person for a conversion. [...] Some jurisdictions hold that the agent must {{have more than a}} mere right of possession. [...] A similar result has been reached where the servant left the property in the possession of the defendant, who subsequently converted it. [...] Where a sheriff attached chattels and delivered them for safekeeping to a person, the person was merely the sheriff's servant, and having no interest in the chattels, could not maintain an action for their conversion. Causes of action for conversion are generally <b>assignable,</b> so that the action may be instituted by the assignee. An officer in possession of property may ignore a conversion of the same by a wrongdoer and proceed to sell the property on execution, the purchaser then being permitted to sue the wrongdoer for the conversion of the property.

A creditor, having no interest, generally may not be a plaintiff in an action to retrieve a debtor's converted property.
