5|$|Absolutely. There's a {{song called}} 'Army of Me,' {{which is sort of}} a 'Fighter 2.0.' There is a new {{generation}} of fans from a younger demographic that might not have been with me all the way but that watch me on the show now. I feel like every generation should be able to enjoy and have their piece of 'Fighter' within. This time, the way it musically came together it just felt right for this time and this generation. There's {{always going to be a}} fighter in me getting through some obstacle and some hurdle. All these 6-year-olds who know me from pushing my button and turning around in <b>a</b> <b>big</b> <b>red</b> chair who weren't around for the actual 'Fighter,' this is my chance to recharge it, rejuvenate it and do something modernized for them.|$|E
5|$|They {{awake in}} Dr. Noah's lair at the {{pinnacle}} of Mount Everest. Noah (Sisko) enters and gives a monologue about how he will destroy the world, and shows <b>a</b> <b>big</b> <b>red</b> button he will push to do it. He has Bashir and Garak taken below ground, where they are handcuffed to a laser. As the time ticks down before the laser is activated, Bare performs a final check of the laser. Bashir flirts for her, and she slips him a key and hurries out. Bashir unlocks himself and Garak, who protests that it is too dangerous to continue as the safeties are turned off in the program which could result in their deaths. Garak is about to close the program and kill the other crew members when Bashir shoots him, grazing him with a bullet. Garak is shocked, but impressed and agrees to continue the programme. Bashir is concerned as he knows the program will end with either the death of Professor Bare or Colonel Komananov following the defeat of Noah.|$|E

50|$|First {{mentioned}} in 1849, the flag or {{coat of arms}} shows elk horns in gold with ten red flames along the horns tips with <b>a</b> <b>bigger</b> <b>red</b> flame over the head, on a black background.Originally made in 1843, the coat of arms comes from an idea of St. Idda von Fischingen, whose church choir had the symbol of an elk with flaming horns. This goes back to around 1812 when the church was inaugurated. The oldest coat of arms still intact hangs in the old guardhouse from Bauen to see.|$|R

50|$|The European Union {{is taking}} {{measures}} {{to lessen the}} impact of the filter bubble. The European Parliament is sponsoring inquiries into how filter bubbles affect people’s ability to access diverse news. Additionally, it introduced a program aimed to educate citizens about social media. In the U.S., the CSCW panel suggests the use of news aggregator apps to broaden media consumers news intake. News aggregator apps scan all current news articles and direct you to different viewpoints regarding a certain topic. Users can also use a diversely-aware news balancer which visually shows the media consumer if they are leaning left or right when it comes to reading the news, indicating right-leaning with <b>a</b> <b>bigger</b> <b>red</b> bar or left-leaning with <b>a</b> <b>bigger</b> blue bar. <b>A</b> study evaluating this news balancer found “a small but noticeable change in reading behavior, toward more balanced exposure, among users seeing the feedback, as compared to a control group”.|$|R
500|$|The {{laughing}} gas {{has been in}} desperately short supply at Holby of late. [...] What they really need is {{for someone to come}} along and prove that heart transplants can be fun. It's a job for comedy cardiac specialist Percy Durant (guest star Ade Edmondson), who we last saw working out in Ghana with consultant Ric. You could easily imagine Percy driving around in a van with <b>a</b> <b>big,</b> <b>red,</b> plastic heart on top of it, or cracking open someone's chest and pulling out a bunch of flowers. And when it comes to Lisa (Luisa Bradshaw-White), he magically comes up with the answer to all her problems.|$|E
500|$|Also in 2005, Australia's largest theme park, Dreamworld in Queensland, {{opened a}} [...] "Wiggles World" [...] section, which {{included}} <b>a</b> <b>Big</b> <b>Red</b> Car ride {{and a full}} set for production purposes. The band received licensing rights and sign-off rights for {{every aspect of the}} section's operation. Staff at Dreamworld had to take a [...] "Wiggles boot camp", to ensure they followed The Wiggles' code of conduct when dealing with children and their families. [...] Driven by the Dreamworld success, Six Flags opened its first [...] "Wiggles World" [...] section at their largest theme park at Jackson, New Jersey in April 2007, and planned to open 20 more at its parks across the U.S. in the next decade. The sections emphasised family involvement; they offered joint rides on which parents and children could equally participate. In 2008, Six Flags announced their intentions to open parks with Wiggles World sections in Dubai and across the Arab world. In 2010, after emerging from bankruptcy protection, Six Flags ended their licensing agreements with The Wiggles and other organizations, and changed the themes of their rides and park areas.|$|E
500|$|The Cat {{brings in}} <b>a</b> <b>big</b> <b>red</b> box from outside, {{from which he}} {{releases}} two identical creatures with blue hair and red suits called Thing One and Thing Two. The Things cause more trouble, such as flying kites in the house, knocking pictures {{off the wall and}} picking up the children's mother's new polka-dotted gown. All this comes to an end when the fish spots the children's mother out the window. In response, Sally's brother catches the Things in a net, and the Cat, apparently ashamed, stores them back in the big red box. He takes it out the front door as the fish and the children survey the mess he has made. But the Cat soon returns, riding a machine that picks everything up and cleans the house, delighting the fish and the children. The Cat then leaves just before their mother arrives, and the fish and the children are back where they started {{at the beginning of the}} story. As she steps in, the mother asks the children what they did while she was out, but the children are hesitant and do not answer. The story ends with the question, [...] "What would you do if your mother asked you?" ...|$|E

500|$|Carey {{performed}} [...] "Obsessed" [...] {{on several}} televised appearances since its release. On August 5, 2009, Carey performed the song {{live for the}} first time on the fourth season of the talent competition, America's Got Talent. Carey, appearing in jeans and a black top, was accompanied by several male dancers and three back-up singers. As she performed the song, the dancers hoisted her into the air several times, and carried her to several areas on the stage. During the performance, several white lights flashed, while monitors behind the dancers showed images of Carey and the video. Breanne Heldman from E! Entertainment Television criticized several aspects of the performance. She described the lighting as [...] "anxiety inducing", and wrote, [...] "That said, no one is doubting the singer's impressive set of pipes, but—frighteningly jarring lighting and quick edits aside—did she actually utilize them on 'America's Got Talent' last night?" [...] Aside from questioning the singers live vocals, she also felt Carey seemed [...] "robotic", and didn't show effort or interest in the performance. A reviewer from Idolator also was critical on the performance, asking if there was [...] "anything good about [...] ". He claimed Carey was lip-syncing, and described it as [...] "lackadaisical", and wrote, [...] "the backup dancers’ moves would have probably received <b>a</b> <b>big</b> <b>red</b> 'X' from at least one of the judges." ...|$|E

He did so without slackening his speed, and fell into the turkey-red upholstered seat beside the chauffeur.

2500|$|A {{trademark}} of CBS' baseball coverage was its majestic, uplifting, and harmonious theme music (which was composed by Bob Christianson and Tony Smythe).

As Nibbles runs away, the cat chases him with a flyswatter and corners him. He gives the mouse with a great swat on the buttock. Jerry breaks through the glass to inspect his nephew. Jerry became very upset about <b>a</b> serious <b>big</b> <b>red</b> mark on Nibble's buttock by Tom's swat.

5000|$|The remix version {{received}} favourable reviews.

Leave you wanting to feel a bit more bouncy, exuberant, or joyous? Make you wonder what the track might sound like if the Pet Shop Boys tinkered with it? The Stock Aitken Waterman remix will answer all those questions and make good on all those promises." [...] Rob Corpsey from The Official Chart Company stated [...] "OK so this {{is pretty much the}} Christmas song to end all Christmas songs; a massive sugar rush of classic, candy-coated late 80s pop wrapped up in <b>a</b> <b>big</b> shiny <b>red</b> bow.
