40|$|The {{study of}} product {{warranty}} {{is of interest}} to manufacturers for several reasons. Paid claims are a {{cost of doing business}} and a liability incurred by the manufacturer at the time of sale. For these reasons, estimating and forecasting warranty expenses is of interest. Also, warranty data provides information about the durability of products in the field and, therefore, is of interest to engineers. Here we emphasise two-dimensional warranties, like automotive warranties, that guarantee free repairs subject to both age and mileage limits. We aim to evaluate the <b>average</b> <b>warranty</b> expenses under a two-dimensional non-renewing free replacement warranty policy using real warranty data. We derive a numerical procedure for the evaluation of the two-dimensional renewal function and use it for the warranty cost analysis. In addition, we test whether the available data can be considered as coming from a two-dimensional renewal process.

40|$|Motivation. Non-insurance {{companies}} are offering ever greater enhancements to their warranty programs, {{many times as}} a competitive tool to strengthen market position. Yet, oftentimes very little analysis is performed to understand the cost of these changes. This paper discusses how warranties are accrued for on a manufacturer’s balance sheet and offers examples of methods to estimate these costs. Method. Most of the paper’s discussion centers around projecting actual payments over time using an approach similar to an incremental loss development triangle approach, properly adjusted for exposure and inflation changes. Other methods discussed include Bornhuetter-Ferguson, <b>Average</b> Age of <b>Warranty</b> Claim Times Annual Spend, Active Life, and Calendar Year Payments to Revenue Approaches. Results. The most appropriate projection method may depend on factors such as available data or {{the nature of the}} company’s product. Conclusions. Actuarial projections of warranty costs rooted in common actuarial reserving and pricing techniques are appropriate for estimating the future liabilities for the warranty liabilities...|$|R
