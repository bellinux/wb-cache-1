40|$|Computer {{mediated}} communication (CMC) {{has created}} new arenas for social interaction in contemporary society, also {{for children and}} young people. This raises questions about how these arenas are used by children and young people. Drawing on the sociology of childhood, this thesis addresses children’s social interaction on a website designed for young people, where issues of masculinity, femininity, emotions and sexuality are discussed. The general aim is to explore the construction of meaning in relation to these issues; more specifically patterns of online interaction and the ways children express and share ideas and values in the “now” of the interpretive communities on the website, {{and at the same}} time deal with ideas, norms and values mediated through society at large. In three discussion groups on the website, 143 discussions initiated by virtual children aged 12 to 15 followed by discussions with several virtual persons at the same age and older were collected and analysed. Three patterns of interaction were identified according to the degrees of ‘horizontal’ versus ‘vertical’ communication: ‘Playful interaction’ is characterised by a horizontal communication where curiosity and experiences are shared between virtual children in the same age ‘Corrective interaction’ is characterised by vertical interaction and more explicit <b>advise</b> and <b>instructions</b> from participants in different ages, drawing on arguments from the ‘adult world’. In ‘Orienting interaction’ there are aspects of both horizontal and vertical interaction as older or adult virtual participants express their points of view and experiences as it were to strive for a shared understanding. These patterns of interaction, and the ways they are related to the different topics in the discussion groups, are discussed in terms of the on-going positioning of children as a ‘social group’ and the construction of gender, generation and cultural notions of children as innocent or knowing...|$|R

5000|$|The 24-storey Grenfell Tower in Kensington, London was {{destroyed}} by fire in June 2017. The rapid spread of the fire was {{believed to have been}} caused by recent remedial work, which added flammable exterior cladding. The safety <b>instructions</b> <b>advised</b> residents to stay indoors in the event of the fire, which proved fatal as they assumed a fire could not spread via the block's exterior. A local residents organisation, Grenfell Action Group warned that fire safety was inadequate and had expressed concerns about a fatal incident before the fire occurred. The Grenfell Tower fire was one of many similar fires world wide where unsatisfactory cladding was a factor. Cladding can worsen a fire and enable a fire to spread fast if it is not done to satisfactory standards. The cladding can act as a chimney enabling the fire to spread upwards rapidly. Temperatures in a fire can be high enough to cause plastic cladding to melt, then molten plastic drips downwards burning as it falls and spreads the fire rapidly downwards. These fires happen in the cavity so it is frequently impossible to see from the outside or the inside how serious the fire is. Sprinklers and smoke detectors sometimes do not detect the fires. The Lakanal House fire where six people died was exacerbated by fibre composite cladding called trespa which resisted the fire less well than asbestos panels that the trespa replaced. An unnamed surveyor told, The Guardian, “We do a lot of investigations of defective buildings, and we regularly see deficiencies in the workmanship. Gaps are left where there shouldn’t be gaps, or a form of less fire-resistant insulation is used instead of a proper fire break. These things are done to cut costs and save time, but we must get tougher on inspection and ensure the people fitting these facades are properly trained. Otherwise there are thousands more people who could be at risk.” ...|$|R
40|$|Objective – To explore faculty {{attitudes towards}} {{information}} literacy (IL); in particular,faculty perception of student IL competencies, importance of IL skills and instruction, and ideal means {{of planning and}} delivering IL instruction. Design – Online survey questionnaire. Setting – Large public research university located in Toronto, Canada. Subjects – 221 full-time faculty. Methods – The author designed and distributed an online survey to all full-time York University faculty (n= 1, 451) in March 2007 using Zoomerang software. The survey consisted of between 26 and 36 questions depending on responses selected by respondents, and included both open- and closed-ended questions. The author handcoded the qualitative data and used SPSS to analyze the quantitative data. The survey had 221 usable responses giving {{a response rate of}} 15. 2 %. Main Results – The study revealed a high degree of concern among survey respondents regarding undergraduate students’ information literacy skills, accompanied by a perceived gradual increase in IL abilities corresponding to student year. Faculty ranked each of the Association of College and Research Libraries’ (ACRL) Information Literacy Standards for Higher Education as being extremely important. No ACRL standard ranked below 6 on a scale of 1 to 7, suggesting full agreement with the value of IL proficiency. Of the faculty 78. 7 % felt that IL education should be a joint collaboration between faculty and librarians. A considerable majority of respondents (81. 7 %) answered that IL instruction should be required for all students. Far fewer faculty incorporated IL teaching in practice, with 52. 9 % engaging in IL instruction and 47. 1 % not incorporating IL instruction at all. Of the faculty who incorporated librarian-led IL sessions into their courses, 85 % of faculty perceived a “substantial impact” or “some impact” on their students’ IL competencies. Conclusions – The author concludes that this study adds evidence to the claim that a disconnect exists between faculty beliefs about the importance of IL and their teaching practices. Faculty consistently express concern regarding student IL abilities and support collaborative IL instruction, yet the rate of IL integration within their classes remains low. The results corroborate that faculty perceptions and attitudes towards IL remain relatively consistent when compared with other studies. The author recommends that librarians be flexible regarding IL instruction models and encourage further investigation of faculty development models to achieve wider IL integration. A stronger advocacy role is also <b>advised</b> to increase <b>instruction</b> opportunities and the promotion of information literacy at the institutional level. The author identifies four areas for future research, including examining why faculty do not incorporate IL instruction into their classes, disciplinary differences in IL attitudes and adoption, which IL instruction models faculty view as most effective, and replication of this study to test generalizability. As of the study’s publication, the author was conducting a qualitative follow-up study in the form of semi-structured interviews with faculty...|$|R

Sheriff 2 ̆ 7 s deputies arrived at the residence shortly thereafter and found one victim alive, {{lying on the floor}} in a pool of blood. The telephone line nearby had been cut. A body was discovered on a deck outside. Evidence implicated Christopher Fiegehen as the primary suspect. However, he abruptly fled Nevada {{on the day of the}} crime. Two months later, he was stopped and questioned by police officers in Indiana, where they apprehended him after a routine check revealed an outstanding warrant for his arrest in Nevada for homicide. Fiegehen eventually returned to Nevada to face criminal charges. The State charged Fiegehen with murder with the use of a deadly weapon, attempted murder with the use of a deadly weapon, burglary while in possession of a deadly weapon, and home invasion while in possession of a deadly weapon. The State alleged that Fiegehen committed the murder: (1) with malice aforethought by means of a willful, deliberate and premeditated killing; (2) in the perpetration or attempted perpetration of a burglary; or (3) in the perpetration or attempted perpetration of a home invasion. Fiegehen waived his right to a separate penalty hearing and agreed to have the sentence imposed by the district court, if the jury found him guilty of first-degree murder. The State presented overwhelming evidence establishing that Fiegehen was the assailant. The jury <b>instructions</b> <b>advised</b> the jury only on the State 2 ̆ 7 s three alternative theories of first-degree murder and contained no mention of second-degree murder. The jury was further instructed: All verdicts returned in this case must be unanimous. In considering Count I, murder with the use of a deadly weapon, the State has alleged three alternative theories of first-degree murder. You do not have to agree on the theory of murder in the first degree, it is sufficient that each of you find beyond a reasonable doubt that the murder, under any one of the three theories, was murder of the first degree. The jury found Fiegehen guilty of 2 ̆ 2 murder with the use of a deadly weapon, a category A felony. 2 ̆ 22 The jury also found Fiegehen guilty of attempted murder with the use of a firearm, burglary while in possession of a deadly weapon, and invasion of the home while in possession of a deadly weapon. The jury was polled, and all of the jurors confirmed that they were in agreement with the verdicts. Fiegehen did not object to or further discuss the verdict at that time. Later, defense counsel orally requested the district court to declare the verdict on the murder count void because it failed to designate the degree of murder. The district court denied the motion, basing its decision on the totality of the circumstances. The district court then sentenced Fiegehen to two consecutive terms of life in the Nevada State Prison without the possibility of parole for murder, a sentence consistent with a finding of first-degree murder. Fiegehen appealed. The Nevada Supreme Court held that the jury 2 ̆ 7 s failure to designate in its verdict the degree of murder did not render the verdict void. The verdict satisfied the requirements of NRS 200. 030 (3) because the jury 2 ̆ 7 s separate findings of guilt on the charges of murder, burglary, and home invasion together established a finding of firstdegree felony murder as a matter of law. The Nevada Supreme Court confirmed Fiegehen’s conviction in its entirety...|$|R
