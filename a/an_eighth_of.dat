5|$|In {{the early}} nineteenth century the kelp {{industry}} provided significant employment on some of the Orkney islands, but when the market collapsed between 1830 and 1832 it caused considerable hardship. North Ronaldsay was especially hard-hit and several families were allowed to resettle from there to develop land at Westside on Eday. Rising populations meant increasing land values, especially for small tenancies. In 1843 crofts were valued at £1/acre on Eday, nearly three times the price for larger farms. However, the 20th century saw decline. Immigration from mainland Scotland was essentially unknown even in the late 1950s and the population in 2001 was about <b>an</b> <b>eighth</b> <b>of</b> the total 160 years earlier.|$|E
5|$|The thighbone is {{straight}} in front view. Seen {{from the same}} direction its head is perpendicular to the shaft, seen from above it is orientated 20° to the front. The greater trochanter is relatively wide and separated from the robust lesser trochanter in front of it, by a fissure. At the front base of the lesser trochanter a low accessory trochanter is present. At {{the lower end of}} the thighbone a distinct front, extensor, groove separates the condyles. At the upper inner side of this groove a rough area is present continuing inwards into a longitudinal ridge, a typical megalosauroid trait. The shinbone, or tibia, is relatively straight, slightly curving inwards. To below, its shaft progressively flattens from front to rear, resulting in a generally oval cross-section. For about <b>an</b> <b>eighth</b> <b>of</b> its length the front lower end of the shaft is covered by a vertical branch of the astragalus. Of the foot, only the second, third and fourth metatarsals are known, the bone elements that were connected to the three weight-bearing toes. They are straight and robust, showing ligament pits at their lower sides. The third metatarsal has no clear condyles at its lower end, resulting in a more flexible joint, allowing for a modicum of horizontal movement. The top inner side of the third metatarsal carries a unique ridge that fits into a groove along the top outer side of the second metatarsal, causing a tighter connection.|$|E

5000|$|In the Discworld {{series by}} Terry Pratchett, magical {{properties}} {{are attributed to}} the number eight rather than seven. Traditionally on the Discworld, <b>an</b> <b>eighth</b> son <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>eighth</b> son becomes <b>a</b> wizard. <b>A</b> wizard's <b>eighth</b> son—the <b>eighth</b> son <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>eighth</b> son <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>eighth</b> son (<b>an</b> unlikely and deliberately discouraged event)—is a Sourcerer, a dangerously powerful wizard. In the novel Equal Rites, instead <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>eighth</b> son <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>eighth</b> son <b>a</b> daughter is born, but due to a dying wizard passing on his staff before checking the child's gender, the daughter receives the wizarding powers normally given to the eighth son. This causes problems as females {{are supposed to be}} witches, and males wizards, due to each gender having a different method of thinking, and the powers associated with each title are not interchangeable. The novel Sourcery centers on the unlikely story <b>of</b> <b>a</b> wizard's <b>eighth</b> son - the Sourcerer.|$|R

25|$|Autosomal DNA is {{contained}} in the 22 pairs of chromosomes not involved in determining a person's sex. Autosomal DNA recombines each generation, and new offspring receive one set of chromosones from each parent. These are inherited exactly equally from both parents and roughly equally from grandparents to about 3x great-grand parents. Therefore, the number of markers received with a specific ancestor decreases by about half each generation; that is, an individual receives half of their markers from each parent, {{about a quarter of}} their markers from each grandparent; about <b>an</b> <b>eighth</b> <b>of</b> their markers from each great grandparent, etc. Inheritance is more random and unequal from more distant ancestors. Generally, a genealogical DNA test might test about 700,000 SNPs (single-nucleotide polymorphisms), or changes at a single point in genetic code.|$|E

25|$|In both {{town and}} country, {{means of access}} between the main house and the servant's wings were kept to a minimum, often the single door would be lined with green baize to deaden any sound. Long and {{complicated}} passages linking kitchens with dining rooms were devised; in some houses the tortuous route through corridors and staircases from kitchen to dining room could be <b>an</b> <b>eighth</b> <b>of</b> a mile – an absence of cooking smells taking priority over hot food. Even the doors linking to the connecting corridors would be covered by screens, sometimes disguised as bookcases with dummy books, or just simply covered in the same wallpaper as that with which the room was decorated, as the existence of servants {{was not to be}} acknowledged. Cleaning had to be performed {{in the early hours of}} the morning while the employers were asleep, and in the grander houses only male servants were allowed to be visible, and then only when required.|$|E

500|$|Estimates of Axis {{fatalities}} due to operations by the Polish underground, {{of which}} the Home Army formed the bulk, range up to 150,000 (however, estimates of guerrilla-inflicted casualties often have a wide margin of error).

It is estimated that <b>an</b> <b>eighth</b> <b>of</b> all German transports to the Eastern Front were destroyed or substantially delayed due to Home Army [...] operations.

500|$|For the {{remainder}} of his reign, William interfered actively in politics only once, in 1834, when he became the last British sovereign to choose a prime minister contrary to the will of Parliament. In 1834, the ministry was facing increasing unpopularity and Lord Grey retired; the Home Secretary, William Lamb, 2nd Viscount Melbourne, replaced him. Lord Melbourne retained most Cabinet members, and his ministry retained an overwhelming majority in the House of Commons. Some members of the Government, however, were anathema to the King, and increasingly left-wing policies concerned him. The previous year Grey had already pushed through a bill reforming the Protestant Church of Ireland. The Church collected tithes throughout Ireland, supported multiple bishoprics and was wealthy. However, barely <b>an</b> <b>eighth</b> <b>of</b> the Irish population belonged to the Church of Ireland. In some parishes, there were no Church of Ireland members at all, but there was still a priest paid for by tithes collected from the local Catholics and Presbyterians, leading to charges that idle priests were living in luxury {{at the expense of the}} Irish living at the level of subsistence. Grey's bill had reduced the number of bishoprics by half, abolished some of the sinecures and overhauled the tithe system. Further measures to appropriate the surplus revenues of the Church of Ireland were mooted by the more radical members of the Government, including Lord John Russell. The King had an especial dislike for Russell, calling him [...] "a dangerous little Radical." ...|$|E

2500|$|In case of husband's death, {{a portion}} of his {{property}} is inherited by his wives according to a combination of sharia laws. If the man did not leave any children, his wives receive a quarter of the property and the remaining three quarters is shared by the blood relatives of the husband (for example, parents, siblings). If he had children from any of his wives, his wives receive <b>an</b> <b>eighth</b> <b>of</b> the property and the rest is for his surviving children and parents. The wives share as inheritance a part of movable property of her late husband, but they do not share anything from immovable property [...] such as land, real estate, farm or such value. A woman's deferred mahr and the dead husband's outstanding debts are paid before any inheritance is applied. Sharia mandates that inheritance include male relatives of the dead person, that a daughter receive half the inheritance as a son, and a widow receives less than her daughters.|$|E

[...] Under the rules of the day, the five middle linemen were not permitted to drop back of the line scrimmage unless they were at least five yards behind the line when the ball was put in play. By placing Curtis at end, Yost explained that he would give Curtis the ability to play on the line or back off without having to be a full five feet behind the line. In this way, Curtis could be used both to receive the ball and open holes.|$|E
2500|$|Since {{the tower}} {{was not yet}} finished, the bell was mounted in New Palace Yard. The first bell was transported to the tower on a trolley drawn by sixteen horses, with crowds cheering its progress. During the bell's testing, it cracked beyond repair and a {{replacement}} had to be made. The bell was recast on 10 April 1858 at the Whitechapel Bell Foundry as a 13½ton (13.76-tonne) bell. This was pulled [...] up to the Clock Tower’s belfry, a feat that took 18 hours. It is [...] tall and [...] diameter. This new bell first chimed in July 1859; in September it too cracked under the hammer. According to the foundry's manager, George Mears, the horologist Denison had used a hammer {{more than twice the}} maximum weight specified.

To make the repair, a square piece of metal was chipped out from the rim around the crack, and the bell given <b>an</b> <b>eighth</b> <b>of</b> a turn so the new hammer struck in a different place. Big Ben has chimed with a slightly different tone ever since, and is still in use today with the crack unrepaired.
