Specifically, we investigated the IMCL storage <b>at</b> <b>resting</b> state in obese rats by quantifying the rates of IMCL accumulation using continuous and dynamic 1 H-MRS. We demonstrated that dynamic 1 H-MRS could quantify the IMCL accumulation <b>at</b> <b>resting</b> state in individual muscles. Our preliminary results revealed that the disorder of lipid metabolism in obesity is associated with not only an increased IMCL content, but also the alterations in the rates of IMCL storage <b>at</b> <b>resting</b> state in both slow-oxidative muscle and fast-oxidative glycolytic muscles. link_to_OA_fulltextThe 20 th Annual Meeting & Exihibition of the International Society of Magnetic Resonance in Medicine (ISMRM 2012), Melbourne, Australia, 5 - 11 May 2012.

40|$|Seventeen {{patients}} with {{coronary artery disease}} were studied with cineangiography and simultaneous tip manometry <b>at</b> <b>resting</b> heart rate and maximal tachycardia induced by atrial pacing. During early diastole, defined as the interval from {{the opening of the}} mitral valve to the point of minimal left ventricular pressure, 20 percent of total ventricular filling took place <b>at</b> <b>resting</b> heart rate, but 62 percent occurred during tachycardia. Minimal pressure was significantly correlated with the time constant of pressure decay during the isovolumic phase (r = 0. 75 <b>at</b> <b>resting</b> heart rate and r = 0. 81 during tachycardia). The measured minimal pressure could be predictd by extrapolating the exponential decay of ventricular isovolumic pressure to the time of occurence of the minimal pressure, which occurred on average 2. 7 time constants from the peak negative rate of change of pressure. <b>At</b> <b>resting</b> heart rate the time constant of relaxation was inversely correlated with ventricular inflow volume (r = - 0. 64) and inflow rate (r = - 0. 72). It is concluded that left ventricular relaxatin has a relevant role in early diastolic pressure-volume relations and increases during tachycardia...|$|R

40|$|We use the {{qualitative}} insight of a planar neuronal phase portrait to detect an excitability switch in arbitrary conductance-based models {{from a simple}} mathematical condition. The condition expresses a balance between ion channels that provide a negative feedback <b>at</b> <b>resting</b> potential (restorative channels) and those that provide a positive feedback <b>at</b> <b>resting</b> potential (regenerative channels). Geometrically, the condition imposes a transcritical bifurcation that rules the switch of excitability through the variation of a single physiological parameter. Our analysis of six di erent published conductance based models always nds the transcritical bifurcation and the associated switch in excitability, {{which suggests that the}} mathematical predictions have a physiological rel- evance and that a same regulatory mechanism is potentially involved in the excitability and signaling of many neurons.

5|$|Some cicadas such as Hemisciera maculipennis display bright deimatic flash {{coloration}} {{on their}} hindwings when threatened; the sudden contrast helps to startle predators, giving the cicadas time to escape.

40|$|Abstract: It will {{be proved}} that the uniform {{rectilinear}} motion of any object relative to an inertial coordinate system (CS) is always mathematically and graphically described relative to a CS <b>at</b> absolute <b>rest.</b> The uniform rectilinear motion of an object with respect to two parallel CSs moving collinearly is reduced to one {{with respect to the}} CSs <b>at</b> absolute <b>rest</b> associated to the last. The velocities of this object relative to the two CSs <b>at</b> absolute <b>rest</b> are related by the relativistic law for the composition of parallel velocities. Traced by physical signals (in particular light signals) with respect to these CSs <b>at</b> absolute <b>rest,</b> the radius vectors of moving geometrical points predict time-dependent coordinate transformations complementary to spatial translations and rotations. Lorentz transformation (LT) is one of them. The special relativity theory (SRT) appears to be a theory of absolute...|$|R

5|$|To the {{practical}} ornithologist there arises a considerable gratification {{in being able}} to ascertain the distinguishing characters of birds as they appear at a distance, whether <b>at</b> <b>rest,</b> or during their flight; for not only every genus has something peculiar to itself, but each species has its own appropriate marks, by which a judicious observer may discriminate almost with certainty.|$|E
5|$|Unlike in ants, the hind-wings and fore-wings are {{of equal}} length. Most of the time, the alates are poor flyers; their {{technique}} is to launch {{themselves in the}} air and fly in a random direction. Studies show that in comparison to larger termites, smaller termites cannot fly long distances. When a termite is in flight, its wings remain at a right angle, and when the termite is <b>at</b> <b>rest,</b> its wings remain parallel to the body.|$|E
5|$|Besides the {{problems}} of the partial aether-dragging hypothesis, another major problem arose with the Michelson–Morley experiment (1887). In Fresnel's theory, the aether is almost stationary, so the experiment should have given a positive result. However, the result of this experiment was negative. Thus from the viewpoint of the aether models at that time, the experimental situation was contradictory: On one hand, the aberration of light, the Fizeau experiment and the repetition by Michelson and Morley in 1886 appeared to support partial aether-dragging. On the other hand, the Michelson–Morley experiment of 1887 appeared to prove that the aether is <b>at</b> <b>rest</b> with respect to Earth, apparently supporting the idea of complete aether-dragging (see aether drag hypothesis). So the very success of Fresnel's hypothesis in explaining Fizeau's results helped lead to a theoretical crisis, which was not resolved until the development of the theory of special relativity.|$|E
