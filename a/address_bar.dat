Microsoft's Cortana assistant is deeply integrated into its Edge browser. Cortana can find opening-hours when on restaurant sites, show retail coupons for websites, or show weather information in the <b>address</b> <b>bar.</b> At the Worldwide Partners Conference 2015 Microsoft demonstrated Cortana integration with upcoming {{products such as}} GigJam. Conversely, Microsoft announced in late April 2016 that it would block anything other than Bing and Edge from being used to complete Cortana searches, again raising questions of anticompetitive behavior by the company.|$|E
25|$|The <b>address</b> <b>bar</b> {{and status}} bar appear in all windows {{including}} popups which helps to block malicious sites from disguising them as trusted sites. Also the <b>address</b> <b>bar</b> features a color code to visually indicate the trustworthiness of the page. The <b>address</b> <b>bar</b> turns red when a page, with invalid security certificate, is accessed. In case of sites not using any encryption, the <b>address</b> <b>bar</b> is white. And if the page uses high security certificate, the bar turns green.|$|E
25|$|The <b>address</b> <b>bar</b> {{features}} domain highlighting {{for added}} security {{so that the}} top-level domain is shown in black whereas {{the other parts of}} the URL are grayed out. Domain highlighting cannot be turned off by users or web sites. Other features of the <b>address</b> <b>bar</b> include support for pasting multi-line URLs and an improved model for inserting the selection caret, and selecting words, or entire URLs in the <b>Address</b> <b>bar.</b> The inline autocomplete feature has been dropped from Internet Explorer 8, leading to criticism by beta users.|$|E

25|$|Once {{a victim}} visits the {{phishing}} website, the deception is not over. Some phishing scams use JavaScript commands {{in order to}} alter the <b>address</b> <b>bar.</b> This is done either by placing {{a picture of a}} legitimate URL over the <b>address</b> <b>bar,</b> or by closing the original bar and opening up a new one with the legitimate URL.|$|E

According to Opera Software, Carakan makes Opera 10.50 {{more than seven}} times faster in SunSpider than Opera 10.10. On 16 December 2010, Opera 11 was released, featuring extensions, tab stacking (where dragging one tab over another allows you to create a group of tabs), visual mouse gestures, and changes to the <b>address</b> <b>bar.</b> Opera 12 was released on 14 June 2012.|$|E

25|$|The Omnibox is a URL {{box that}} {{combines}} {{the functions of}} both the <b>address</b> <b>bar</b> and search box. If a user enters the URL of a site previously searched from, Chrome allows pressing Tab to search the site again directly from the Omnibox. When a user starts typing in the Omnibox, Chrome provides suggestions for previously visited sites (based on the URL or in-page text), popular websites (not necessarily visited before powered by Google Instant), and popular searches. Although Instant can be turned off, suggestions based on previously visited sites cannot be turned off. Chrome will also autocomplete the URLs of sites visited often. If a user types keywords into the Omnibox that don't match any previously visited websites and presses enter, Chrome will conduct the search using the default search engine.|$|E
500|$|While most browsers {{feature a}} {{hierarchical}} folder-based bookmark system, Web uses categorized bookmarks, where a single bookmark (such as [...] "Web") can exist in multiple categories (such as [...] "Web Browsers", [...] "GNOME", and [...] "Computer Software"). A special category includes bookmarks {{that have not}} yet been categorized. Another innovative concept supported by Web (though originally from Galeon) is [...] "smart bookmarks". These take a single argument specified from the <b>address</b> <b>bar,</b> or from a textbox in a toolbar. Bookmarks, along with browsing history, are accessed from the <b>address</b> <b>bar</b> in find-as-you-type manner.|$|E

5000|$|Three {{affidavits}} {{were filed}} {{by government officials}} against Chief Justice of Pakistan. Aitzaz Ahsan accuses officials of perjury. Talking to reporters after the hearing of the CJP's case in the full court, Aitzaz Ahsan claimed that the government officials' affidavits had several factual mistakes, which showed that the affidavits were [...] "fictitious" [...] and [...] "bogus". Ahsan cited the affidavit of former SC public relations officer Maj (r) Khalid Bilal in which he mentioned Chaudhry as [...] "ineffective chief justice" [...] and advised him not to lead rallies and <b>address</b> <b>bars</b> because the Supreme Judicial Council was hearing his case. Ahsan said that the affidavit showed the date of 8 March when no reference had been filed, the CJP had not been declared ineffective and neither the SJC was hearing any case. [...] "How {{is it possible that}} a PRO is narrating events which had not happened till the date when he signed the affidavit ... I am referring to it as an example of bogus affidavit and there are many more which we will disclose before the SC," [...] he added. He said that former Punjab IG and the current Sindh IG had also made errors in their affidavits, which showed that the entire episode was mala fide.|$|R

Mail adds new VIP feature to save frequent contacts. The Preview app gets an improved user interface. It is able to fill out forms in PDF documents that don't contain actual PDF form fields. Reminders is a new to-do list application, separate from Calendar in its own application that syncs along with its iOS counterpart. Safari 6 gets a new release and features a new address bar; {{a combination of the}} <b>address</b> <b>bar</b> and the search field. The <b>address</b> <b>bar</b> also has a [...] "Reader" [...] button, showing the user just the text of the article without advertisements and distraction. When the user is on a website with no article, the button is disabled. Safari 6 is available as a download for Mac OS X Lion. Time Machine is able to do rotating backups on more than one storage medium.|$|E
2500|$|People {{can take}} steps to avoid {{phishing}} attempts by slightly modifying their browsing habits. When contacted about an account needing to be [...] "verified" [...] (or any other topic used by phishers), it is a sensible precaution to contact the company from which the email apparently originates to check that the email is legitimate. Alternatively, the address that the individual knows is the company's genuine website can be typed into the <b>address</b> <b>bar</b> of the browser, rather than trusting any hyperlinks in the suspected phishing message.|$|E
2500|$|Version 1703, {{announced}} as the Creators Update and codenamed Redstone 2. Planned features for this update include a new Paint 3D application, which {{allows users to}} create and modify 3D models, integration with Microsoft's HoloLens and other [...] "mixed-reality" [...] headsets produced by other manufacturers, Windows MyPeople, which allows users to manage contacts, Xbox game broadcasting, support for newly developed APIs such as WDDM 2.2, Dolby Atmos support, improvements to the Settings app, and more Edge and Cortana improvements. This version will also include tweaks to system apps, such as an <b>address</b> <b>bar</b> in the Registry Editor, Windows PowerShell being the default command line interface instead of the Command Prompt and the Windows Subsystem for Linux being upgraded to support Ubuntu 16.04. This version of Windows 10 was released on 11 April 2017 as a free update.|$|E
40|$|In February 2011 the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) {{exhausted}} its free pool of IPv 4 addresses, and {{the regional}} registries (RIRs) have started {{to run out of}} IPv 4 addresses as well. As RIRs have started rationing allocations, IPv 4 transfer markets have emerged as a new mechanism to acquire IPv 4 <b>addresses.</b> <b>Barring</b> a few high-profile exceptions [30], IPv 4 transfers have largely flown under the radar. In this work, we use the lists of transfers published by three RIRs to characterize the transfer market — the types of players involved, the sizes and characteristics of transferred address blocks, and the visibility of transferred address blocks in the routing table before and after the transfer. Next, we take first steps toward detecting address transfers using BGP data from the Routeviews and RIPE repositories from 2004 - 2013. We identify reasons why legitimate changes in prefix origin could be mistakenly inferred to be transfers, and implement a series of 10 filters that remove 86 % of candidate transfers. Our results indicate that BGP-based detection of transfers is prone to false positives due to significant noise in BGP data, while some transfers remain undetectable as they involve non-BGP speakers. We describe some additional data sources and analysis techniques that may help reveal an opaque market for IPv 4 address block transfers...|$|R

Even with Yochanan bar Nafcha he disputed on various matters. The Talmud also mentions that Hiyya b. Joseph is <b>addressing</b> Yochanan <b>bar</b> Nafcha with questions, however, {{he was probably}} not accounted as his pupil: in a dispute among them, Hiyya b. Joseph is mentioned first, and various doubts on Halachaic matters were brought before both of them as one. At times, Hiyya b. Joseph also delivers statements {{in the name of}} Hoshaiah Rabbah.|$|R
