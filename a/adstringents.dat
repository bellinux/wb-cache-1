40|$|Metallobiomolecules {{are natural}} {{products}} which contain one ore more metallic elements. Deficiencies or excess of metal ions cause {{most of the}} adverse biological effects. Problems of biology and medicine, bio-inorganic chemistry is concerned mainly with cations. Many diseases of animals and plants, man included as well, are traceable to maladjustments in the balance between metals. The therapeutic uses of metal cations are many and varied. As for example, zinc salts are considered the ideal <b>adstringents</b> in ophthalmology, and dermatology {{could not afford to}} give up the use of aluminium acetate to control eczema. Another example is nonphysiological uses such as gold in arthritis, magnesium and other salines as catharties, silver salts in dental practice, etc. It is clear that the bio-medical applications of metals and their complexes are steadily increasing as a greater variety of ways for employing them becomes apparent. This paper deals with the use of metal ions and their complexes in therapy mostly in a treatment of neoplastic diseases. Key words: metal complexes – therapeutic application – control of neoplastic diseases It is well known that biological reactions take place in an aqueous environment where evolutionary pressure has led to the selection of trace amounts of various element...|$|E

40|$|This {{bachelor}} work theoretically describes Southern American plant named guarana (Paullinia cupana), its history, cultivation {{and traditional}} preparation. The work deals with effects of significant alkaloids (caffeine, theophylline, theobromine), tannins and saponins included in guarana, {{as well as}} general activity of guarana seeds. Contemporary studies are in agreement with strong antibacterial and antioxidant effects of guarana seed extracts, genotoxic and mutagenic activity of guarana in prokaryotic organisms and toxic affects on dogs, which are extremely sensitive on methylxanthines. In studies on human volunteers there was not shown any adverse effects, but there were recorded some cases of new-onset seizures in adults following heavy consumption of energy drinks, rich in caffeine, taurine, and guarana seed extract. The studies generally proved helpful activity against obesity and positive influence on lipids metabolism. There were confirmed positive psychoactive and mild antidepressant effects of guarana as well as <b>adstringent,</b> lipolytic and gastroprotective properties...|$|R
40|$|Some of {{the major}} {{constituents}} of strawberry tree are flavonoids and phenolic acids {{that are responsible for}} some of the pharmacological activities i. e. <b>adstringent,</b> antihypertensive, antidiarrheal and antibacterial. Objective of this work was to determine flavonoid aglycones and phenolic acids in strawberry tree leaves collected during 12 months of 2013 using RP-HPLC-DAD and assess antioxidant activity using ABTS stable free radical. Antioxidant activity of strawberry tree leaves varied between 11 % and 28 %. The content of individual polyphenols was: chlorogenic acid 0. 8 to 6. 5 mg/g, caffeic acid 0. 6 – 1. 0 mg/g, p-coumaric acid 0. 2 – 6. 6 mg/g and quercetin 0. 5 – 10. 7 mg/g. The highest content of polyphenols was during winter months. Compared to the thin-layer chromatography analysis we have determined presence of additional phenolic acids (caffeic and p-coumaric) and quercetin – aglycone of quercitrin, isoquercitrin and hyperoside...|$|R
40|$|Salvia genus {{belongs to}} the {{subfamily}} Nepetoideae of Mentheae tribe in Lamiaceae fam-ily (1). Numerous species of the genus Salvia have been used since ancient times in folk medicine and {{have been subjected to}} extensive pharmacognostic research intended to identify biologically active compounds (2, 3). These species have been found to possess significant biological activities, including antibacterial, antiviral, <b>adstringent,</b> antitumor, spasmolytic, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, antihydrotic activity and have been also used in the treatment of mental, nervous and gastrointestinal conditions. Sage species are used traditionally in foods and cosmetics preparation as well (2 – 5). There are several reports in the literature on the phytochemical analysis of species belonging to Salvia. These sci-entific studies on Salvia species show the presence of many compounds belonging mainly to the groups of phenolic acids, phenolic glycosides, flavonoids, anthocyanins, couma-rins, polysaccharides, sterols, terpenoids and essential oils (2, 6, 7). S. rhytidea (syn: S. lalesarica RECH. f.) is spread wildly in western regions of Iran as well as in Afghanistan. It is used in local folk medical practices. It generally grows in or near disturbed habitats and is less commonly found in natural habitats. S. rhytidea has an altitudinal range from 2000 – 3800 m (8). Although the chemical composition of essential oils from several Salvia species is well studied (3 – 7, 9 – 19), to our best knowledge no research has been conducted on this Per-sian sage so far. Therefore, the present paper gives a detailed analysis of its oil by GC/MS...|$|R
