You have {{proposed}} to fix it by letting people put some of the money collected to pay benefits into private savings accounts. But the critics are saying that's going to mean finding $1 trillion over the next 10 years to continue paying benefits as those accounts are being set up. So where do you get the money? <b>Are</b> <b>you</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> to increase the deficit by that much over 10 years? ...|$|E

[...] Mavering broke off with a dolorous laugh. [...] "And if you can't presuppose it, what <b>are</b> <b>you</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> do {{when it comes to}} the point?

How tangled up and absurd that is! How <b>are</b> <b>you</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> a republic under a king? How <b>are</b> <b>you</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> a republic at all, where the head of the government is absolute, holds his place forever, and has no parliament, no council to meddle or make in his affairs, nobody voted for, nobody elected, nobody in the whole universe with a voice in the government, nobody asked to take a hand in its matters, and nobody ALLOWED to do it? Fine republic, ain't it?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, we won't go into Shakespeare," [...] said Ogilvy [...] "What {{interests}} {{me is that}} our young women nowadays are running about as free as air practically, with registry offices {{and all sorts of}} accommodation round the corner. Nothing to check their proceedings but a declining habit of telling the truth and the limitations of their imaginations. And in that respect they stir up one another. Not my affair, of course, but I think we ought to teach them more or restrain them more. One or the other. They're too free for their innocence or too innocent for their freedom. That's my point. <b>Are</b> <b>you</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> any apple-tart, Stanley? The apple-tart's been very good lately--very good!" ...|$|E

5000|$|While Grell never drew {{a map of}} Skartaris {{during his}} tenure on the book, one was created {{towards the end of}} the {{original}} volume's run, and the illustration appeared in The Warlord Annual #4 (1985). In an interview from Comic Scene in 1983, he says: [...] "I did things like moving my character around the countryside; I never drew a map so I could move him from one side of Skartaris to the other just for the sake of the story." [...] In a later interview with Comic Book Resources Grell said, [...] "Anything that can happen in fantasy happens in the lore and it’s one of the reasons I always refused to draw a map of Skartaris. Year after year after year went by, and I was always hounded by the editors, 'When <b>are</b> <b>you</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> a map?' The reason I refused was because once you draw a map, you establish boundaries. And why would you want to put boundaries on your imagination?" ...|$|E
40|$|Transcription begins]:Wednsday [sic] 1700 Dearest Dottie, Please {{excuse the}} paper, honey, {{but this is}} all I’ve got, {{the end of the}} month you know. Well, tomorrow’s payday, thank goodness. Darling, I love you. Gosh just as I wrote that they fired the cannon for retreat. That’s the kind of an ovation I like. You see,—you rate around here, beautiful. Steve won’t be able to make it this weekend, he’s not allowed to have anyone take over for him, so he’ll be too late. Anyway I don’t like double dates anymore, {{although}} when I’m with you I don’t know or care who’s around. When we’re together, honey, it’s like a dream, and you’re the only one in it. It’s just good to be with you Dottie, and I never felt about any other girl that way. There always seemed to be an ulterior motive for my being with anyone else. With you it’s just that I love you, and I want to be near you. I know that no matter how long we’re together or apart it will always be that way—always. Tonight Steve and I and a bunch of the boys are going to the movies to see “Frenchman’s Creek. ” The band is going to play tonight too. It’s a swell outfit, they have Don Cornell, who used to be with Sammy Kaye, for a vocalist. He’s pretty good. I’m glad the pictures are ready. Where <b>are</b> <b>you</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> the ones taken Thursday night? Friday I won’t get off until around five or later, the way things look now it will probably be later, for we might take that Cross Country to Williamsport that afternoon. I’ll get home as soon as possible, darling, and call you when I do. Lonnie must have died a horrible death, but it’s better that way, then [sic] being a prisoner of the Japanese. I don’t think I’d ever let them take me prisoner. You have no idea darling, what fanatics they are, they just don’t seem human, do they? That’s why it’s going to take a long time to beat them. But we will darling, and everything that it has cost us in blood, sweat, and tears will be worth it. Always remember that honey. What’s this surprise you have for me this weekend? Christmas isn’t here yet, angel. You’re so sweet, and I love you so much. Today I flew instruments for an hour and a quarter, then the ship began to ice up so we were forced back to the field. This weather is really bad now. It’s snowing up here. I feel that every flake that falls could mean another minute that we’re apart;—and we have so little time left. Just three weekends and Christmas, but we’re lucky we have that, I guess. Give my best to your family, honey. I love you more every day, my darling. All my love, Judd[Transcription ends...|$|E
