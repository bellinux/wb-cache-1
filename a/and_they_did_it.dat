500|$|The {{scene where}} the NASA {{scientists}} give Arroway the [...] "cyanide pill" [...] caused some controversy during production {{and when the}} film came out. Gerald D. Griffin, the film's NASA advisor, insisted that NASA has never given any astronaut a cyanide pill [...] "just in case," [...] and that if an astronaut truly wished to commit suicide in space, all {{he or she would}} have to do is cut off their oxygen supply. However, Carl Sagan insisted that NASA did indeed give out cyanide pills <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>did</b> <b>it</b> for every mission an astronaut has ever flown. Zemeckis said that because of the two radically different assertions, the truth is unknown, but he left the suicide pill scene in the movie as it seemed more suspenseful that way and it was also in line with Sagan's beliefs and vision of the film. [...] Along with being NASA Technical Consultant for the project, Griffin had a cameo in the role of [...] "Dynamics" [...] in Mission Control. [...] He had previously been technical advisor for Ron Howard's 1995 film Apollo 13. [...] While working for NASA during the Apollo Program, he had been the actual flight director for that mission, among others, and during the 1980s was the director of the Johnson Space Center.|$|E

500|$|Avery Jessup, fiancée of Baldwin's {{character}}, {{was played}} by actress Elizabeth Banks, who first guest starred as the {{character in the}} show's fourth season. This was Banks' tenth time as the Avery character.

[...] "I definitely put feelers out, like, 'I would love to be on your show.' <b>And</b> <b>they</b> <b>did</b> <b>it.</b> They made it happen! I'm a huge fan, so this is a dream come true."

Comedian actor Will Forte made his fourth appearance in the show, having guest starred as a different character in the February 1, 2007, episode [...] "Black Tie" [...] from the show's first season. In the previous season, Forte played Jenna Maroney's boyfriend and Jenna impersonator.

Tina Fey, the series creator and lead actress on 30 Rock, was the head writer on SNL from 1999 until 2006. In June 2010, Jane Krakowski, who plays Jenna, confirmed that Forte would reprise his role as her boyfriend in the upcoming season. Carlock also noted in the Entertainment Weekly interview that the Jenna and Paul characters [...] "have some ups and downs.
