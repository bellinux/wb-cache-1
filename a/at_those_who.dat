5|$|New York City {{played a}} complex {{role in the}} American Civil War. The city's strong {{commercial}} ties to the southern United States existed for many reasons, including the industrial power of the Hudson River harbor, which allowed trade with stops such as the West Point Foundry, {{one of the great}} manufacturing operations in the early United States; and the city's Atlantic Ocean ports, rendering New York City the American powerhouse in terms of industrial trade between the northern and southern United States. New York's growing immigrant population, which had originated largely from Germany and Ireland, began in the late 1850s to include waves of Italians and Central and Eastern European Jews flowing in en masse. Anger arose about conscription, with resentment <b>at</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> could afford to pay $300 to avoid service leading to resentment against Lincoln's war policies and fomenting paranoia about free Blacks taking the poor immigrants' jobs, culminating in the three-day-long New York Draft Riots of July 1863. These intense war-time riots are counted among the worst incidents of civil disorder in American history, with an estimated 119 participants and passersby massacred.|$|E
5|$|Originally a Terran ghost {{agent for}} Arcturus Mengsk, she is betrayed and {{abandoned}} to the Zerg, who transform {{her into a}} Terran/Zerg hybrid with vast psionic powers {{under the control of}} the then unknown Amon. Following the death of the Overmind, Kerrigan asserts her independence, striking out <b>at</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> betrayed her and who seek to contain her, eventually taking control of the entire Zerg Swarm. Four years later, Kerrigan invades the Dominion in search of a number of Xel'Naga artifacts; these artifacts are instead retrieved by Raynor at the behest of the Moebius Foundation, who assembles them into a device that reverts Kerrigan to a human and releases Amon's grip on her. After her deinfestation, Kerrigan is mercilessly pursued by Arcturus Mengsk, however she successfully escapes Arcturus's Dominion forces. After willingly allowing herself to be reinfested on Zerus, Kerrigan is reborn as the Primal Queen of Blades, after which she successfully reunites the Zerg Swarm and storms the Dominion capital of Augustgrad on the planet Korhal with help from Raynor's Raiders. After a showdown with Arcturus Mengsk inside his Palace, Kerrigan manages to gain the upper hand with help from James Raynor, and kills Acturus by overloading his body with psychic energy, causing him to explode spectacularly. In the aftermath of her victory, Kerrigan gathers the Swarm and departs in search of Amon.|$|E

25|$|Responsibility for {{managing}} {{the aftermath of the}} fire was removed from Kensington and Chelsea London Borough Council. It was transferred to a new body comprising representatives from central and other local London government, the London Fire Brigade, Metropolitan Police and Red Cross. Residents living near the tower, who had been evacuated and were also effectively homeless, accused the council's leadership of going into hiding.

25|$|With the Salon d'Automne of {{that same}} year, 1911, the fury broke out again, just as violent {{as it had been}} at the Indépendants. I {{remember}} this Room 8 in the Grand Palais on the opening day. People were crushed together, shouting, laughing, calling for our heads. And what had we hung? Metzinger his lovely canvas entitled Le Goûter; Léger his sombre Nus dans un Paysage; Le Fauconnier, landscapes done in the Savoie; myself La Chasse and the Portrait de Jacques Nayral.

25|$|The poetic {{material}} {{found is}} found largely in chapters 1–25 {{and consists of}} oracles in which the prophet speaks as God's messenger. These passages, dealing with Israel's unfaithfulness to God, the call to repentance, and attacks on the religious and political establishment, are mostly undated and have no clear context, but it is widely accepted that they represent the teachings of Jeremiah and are the earliest stage of the book. Allied to them, and also probably {{a reflection of the}} authentic Jeremiah, are further poetic passages of a more personal nature, which have been called Jeremiah's confessions or spiritual diary. In these poems the prophet agonises over the apparent failure of his mission, is consumed by bitterness <b>at</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> oppose or ignore him, and accuses God of betraying him.|$|E
25|$|Besides {{the ghost}} boy, {{there have been}} other ghosts {{described}} by Weird NJ readers. One claims to have seen a ghost Camaro driven by a girl who supposedly died when she crashed it in 1988 (any mention while driving the road at night is supposed to trigger a manifestation). Another claims to have encountered two park rangers one night while camping with friends near Terrace Pond, a glacial tarn on a ridge accessible from the road by hiking trails, who in the morning turned out to have been the ghosts of two rangers who had died on the job in 1939. Other Weird NJ readers claim to have seen people dressed weirdly at odd hours who simply stare <b>at</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> see them and do not speak, who either disappear or are not seen by others present.|$|E

500|$|... "502" [...] {{is about}} driving fast cars. [...] "In My Darkest Hour" [...] {{was written by}} Mustaine shortly {{after the death of}} Metallica bassist Cliff Burton. Mustaine had found out through word of mouth, as his former bandmates never {{contacted}} him about the tragic event that occurred in Europe. He later recalled that he was extremely unhappy that day and wrote the song in one sitting. [...] "Liar" [...] is a rant directed at past member Chris Poland.

500|$|As {{these works}} became more widely available, reviews and essays about African literature– {{especially}} from Europe– began to flourish. Bristling against the commentary flooding his home country, Achebe published an essay entitled [...] "Where Angels Fear to Tread" [...] in the December 1962 issue of Nigeria Magazine. In it, he distinguished between the hostile critic (entirely negative), the amazed critic (entirely positive), and the conscious critic (who seeks a balance). He lashed out <b>at</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> critiqued African writers from the outside, saying: [...] "no man can understand another whose language {{he does not}} speak (and 'language' here does not mean simply words, but a man's entire world view)."

She {{was killed by a}} shotgun blast to the face when she fled from hiding underneath her home, which had been set on fire by the mob. Fannie Taylor's brother-in-law claimed to be her killer. On January 5, more whites converged on the area, forming a mob of between 200 and 300 people. [...] Some came from out of state. Mingo Williams, who was [...] away near Bronson, was collecting turpentine sap {{by the side of the}} road when a car full of whites stopped and asked his name.

500|$|The {{song was}} {{originally}} intended for a rock opera Townshend {{had been working}} on, Lifehouse, which was a multi-media exercise based on his followings of the Indian religious avatar Meher Baba, showing how spiritual enlightenment could be obtained via a combination of band and audience. The song was written {{for the end of}} the opera, after the main character, Bobby, is killed and the [...] "universal chord" [...] is sounded. The main characters disappear, leaving behind the government and army, who are left to bully each other. Townshend described the song as one [...] "that screams defiance <b>at</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> feel any cause is better than no cause". He later said that the song was not strictly anti-revolution despite the lyric [...] "We'll be fighting in the streets", but stressed that revolution could be unpredictable, adding, [...] "Don't expect to see what you expect to see. Expect nothing and you might gain everything." [...] Bassist John Entwistle later said that the song showed Townshend [...] "saying things that really mattered to him, and saying them for the first time." ...|$|E

[...] Franklin had acquired a packet of about twenty letters that had been written to Whately. [...] Upon reading them, Franklin concluded that Hutchinson and Oliver had mischaracterized the situation in the colonies, and thus misled Parliament. [...] He felt that wider knowledge of these letters would then focus colonial anger away from Parliament and <b>at</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> had written the misleading letters. [...] Franklin sent the letters to Thomas Cushing, the speaker of the Massachusetts assembly, in December 1772. [...] He insisted to Cushing that they not be published or widely circulated.

500|$|Titanic {{suffered}} backlash {{in addition}} to its success. In 2003, the film topped a poll of [...] "Best Film Endings", and yet it also topped a poll by Film 2003 as [...] "the worst movie of all time". The British film magazine Empire reduced their rating of the film from the maximum five stars and an enthusiastic review, to four stars with a less positive review in a later edition, to accommodate its readers' tastes, who wanted to disassociate themselves from the hype surrounding the film, and the reported activities of its fans, such as those attending multiple screenings. In addition to this, positive and negative parodies and other such spoofs of the film abounded and were circulated on the internet, often inspiring passionate responses from fans of various opinions of the film. Benjamin Willcock of DVDActive.com did not understand the backlash or the passionate hatred for the film. [...] "What really irks me...," [...] he said, [...] "are those who make nasty stabs <b>at</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> do love it."

500|$|Wimbledon F.C. {{hoped to}} move to Milton Keynes immediately, but as the new ground was yet to be built an interim home in the town {{would have to be}} found first.
