5|$|States' {{militias and}} Federal troops {{attached}} to the Army of the Potomac, including the newly reorganized 11th New York, were dispatched to quell the riots. Other regiments utilized included the 152nd New York, the 26th Michigan, the 27th Indiana and the 7th Regiment New York State Militia, which arrived from Frederick, Maryland after a forced march. In addition, New York governor Horatio Seymour sent the 74th and 65th regiments of the New York state militia, which had not been federalized, and {{a section of the}} 20th Artillery from Fort Schuyler in Throgs Neck. At the height of the violence, Colonel O'Brien, the 11th Regiment's commanding officer, was seized by the mob, beaten, and killed. In the wake of the riots, the reorganization produced few recruits and stalled. On October 1, 1863, the reorganization was discontinued <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>men</b> <b>who</b> had enlisted were transferred to the 17th Veteran Infantry Regiment.|$|E

25|$|London {{is not a}} battlefield.

On the streets of London {{there is no such thing}} as a war on terror. The fight against {{terrorism}} on the streets of Britain is not a war. It is the prevention of crime, the enforcement of our laws and the winning of justice for those damaged by their infringement.|$|E
25|$|During the night, the Portuguese {{concentrated}} their repairs on the bastions of Conception and Santiago, using palm trunks {{to cover}} the damaged sections. Meanwhile, a body of Dutch troops infiltrated and attacked the bastion of Santiago <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>men</b> <b>who</b> were engaged in repairs. As the light and smell of a burning match could give away their position, this Dutch infiltration unit used flintlock muskets instead of matchlocks. They managed to wound some men but were forced to withdraw due to a charge made by the Portuguese guards. In retaliation, Lourenço Ferreira de Brito, {{the captain of the}} fort, organized a raiding party consisting of Lascarins, but after sallying and arousing the Dutch, they defected to them. Similarly, Dissanayake Mudali, a Lascarin leader, also defected and was seen collaborating with the Dutch.|$|E

500|$|Nichols's {{position}} {{was the same}} as Groves's and Montague's: that nuclear weapons needed to be available in an emergency, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>men</b> <b>who</b> had to use them in battle needed to have experience with their maintenance, storage and handling. Norris Bradbury, who had replaced Oppenheimer {{as the director of the}} Los Alamos Laboratory in December 1945, argued that rapid transfer could be accomplished by improved procedures and that the other difficulties could best be resolved by further development, mostly from the scientists. Forrestal and Carpenter took the matter up with Truman, who issued his decision on 21 July 1948: [...] "I regard the continued control of all aspects of the atomic energy program, including research, development and the custody of atomic weapons as the proper functions of the civil authorities." ...|$|E
