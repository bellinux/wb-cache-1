5|$|Besides {{the simple}} oxide CaO, the {{peroxide}} CaO2 {{can be made}} by direct oxidation of calcium metal under a high pressure of oxygen, and there is some evidence for a yellow superoxide Ca(O2)2. Calcium hydroxide, Ca(OH)2, is a strong base, though it is not <b>as</b> <b>strong</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> hydroxides of strontium, barium or the alkali metals. All four dihalides of calcium are known. Calcium carbonate (CaCO3) and calcium sulfate (CaSO4) are particularly abundant minerals. Like strontium and barium, as well as the alkali metals and the divalent lanthanides europium and ytterbium, calcium metal dissolves directly in liquid ammonia to give a dark blue solution.|$|E
5|$|In 1981, Sharman {{reunited with}} O'Brien to do Shock Treatment, a {{stand-alone}} feature {{that was not}} a direct sequel to the original film. This film reunites characters Brad and Janet and was originally conceived and written to depict the characters filmed in normal settings until the production changed to work around a Screen Actor's Guild strike. The eventual production would now entail the full film being shot entirely within a sound stage and purposely blending that into the story line. Shock Treatment has a cult following but not nearly <b>as</b> <b>strong</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> first film, and was a commercial failure in no small part due to the principal cast of Curry, Sarandon and Bostwick not returning.|$|E
5|$|The bulk of Jupiter's {{magnetic}} field, like Earth's, {{is generated}} by an internal dynamo supported by the circulation of a conducting fluid in its outer core. But whereas Earth's core is made of molten iron and nickel, Jupiter's is composed of metallic hydrogen. As with Earth's, Jupiter's magnetic field is mostly a dipole, with north and south magnetic poles {{at the ends of}} a single magnetic axis. However, on Jupiter the north pole of the dipole is located in the planet's northern hemisphere and the south pole of the dipole lies in its southern hemisphere, opposite to the Earth, whose north pole lies in the southern hemisphere and south pole lies in the northern hemisphere. Jupiter's field also has quadrupole, octupole and higher components, though they are less than one tenth <b>as</b> <b>strong</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> dipole component.|$|E

5|$|The initial hot, dense {{state is}} called the Planck epoch, a brief period {{extending}} from time zero to one Planck time unit of approximately 10−43 seconds. During the Planck epoch, all types of matter and all types of energy were concentrated into a dense state, where gravitation {{is believed to have}} been <b>as</b> <b>strong</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> other fundamental forces, and all the forces may have been unified. Since the Planck epoch, the Universe has been expanding to its present form, possibly with a very brief period of cosmic inflation which caused the Universe to reach a much larger size in less than 10−32 seconds.|$|E
5|$|The smog was {{compared}} to the 1948 smog in Donora, Pennsylvania and the Great Smog of London of 1952, both of which lasted five days. The London smog's death toll of 4,000 was far higher than Donora, but the smog in Donora was far more severe; {{at the time of}} its smog, Donora was a small industrial town with a population of only 13,000, and its population was proportionally hit much harder with 20 deaths and smog-related illnesses among 43 percent of the population. Pollution experts estimated that if a smog <b>as</b> <b>strong</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> Donora smog had occurred in the much more populous New York City, the death toll could have been as high as 11,000 with four million ill.|$|E
5|$|The {{standard}} {{electrode potential}} for the Sr2+/Sr couple is −2.89V, approximately midway between those of the Ca2+/Ca (−2.84V) and Ba2+/Ba (−2.92V) couples, and close {{to those of the}} neighboring alkali metals. Strontium is intermediate between calcium and barium in its reactivity toward water, with which it reacts on contact to produce strontium hydroxide and hydrogen gas. Strontium metal burns in air to produce both strontium oxide and strontium nitride, but since it does not react with nitrogen below 380°C, at room temperature, it forms only the oxide spontaneously. Besides the simple oxide SrO, the peroxide SrO2 can be made by direct oxidation of strontium metal under a high pressure of oxygen, and there is some evidence for a yellow superoxide Sr(O2)2. Strontium hydroxide, Sr(OH)2, is a strong base, though it is not <b>as</b> <b>strong</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> hydroxides of barium or the alkali metals. All four dihalides of strontium are known.|$|E

5|$|When {{it became}} clear to Tiberius that support for Sejanus was not <b>as</b> <b>strong</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> emperor had feared, his next step was to choose Naevius Sutorius Macro, {{previously}} prefect of the vigiles (Roman police and fire department), to replace Sejanus and effect his downfall. On October 18, AD 31, Sejanus was summoned to a Senate meeting by a letter from Tiberius, ostensibly to bestow the tribunician powers upon him. At dawn, he entered the Senate; but while the letter was being read, Macro assumed control of the Praetorian Guard and members of the vigiles led by Graecinius Laco surrounded the building. The senators at first congratulated Sejanus but when the letter, which first digressed into completely unrelated matters, suddenly denounced him and ordered his arrest, he was immediately surrounded and escorted to prison.|$|E

25|$|Atomic Radius: With {{increasing}} atomic radius, acidity also increases. For example, HCl and HI, both strong acids, ionize 100% {{in water}} to become their respective ionic constituents. However, HI {{is stronger than}} HCl. This is because the atomic radius of an atom of iodine is much larger {{than that of a}} chlorine atom. As a result, the negative charge over the I− anion is dispersed over a larger electron cloud and its attraction for the proton (H+) is not <b>as</b> <b>strong</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> same attraction in HCl. Therefore, HI is ionized (deprotonated) more readily.|$|E

25|$|Though the Gallic tribes {{were just}} <b>as</b> <b>strong</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> Romans militarily, the {{internal}} division among the Gauls guaranteed an easy victory for Caesar. Vercingetorix's attempt in 52 BC to unite them against Roman invasion came too late. He proved an astute commander, defeating Caesar in several engagements, but Caesar's elaborate siege-works at the Battle of Alesia finally forced his surrender. Despite scattered outbreaks of warfare the following year, Gaul was effectively conquered. Plutarch claimed {{that during the}} Gallic Wars the army had fought against three million men (of whom onemillion died, and another million were enslaved), subjugated 300 tribes, and destroyed 800 cities.|$|E

Stephen Harmison's bowling, which had been under {{scrutiny}} over the Winter months, improved greatly at his least favourite pitch as he took 4–94 but the next best, Matthew Hoggard at 3–117 proved the tourists had victory in their sights. A special note must go to Pietersen who made a rare attempt at bowling for two overs, taking wicket keeper Kamran Akmal for 58 at figures of 1–11.|$|E
