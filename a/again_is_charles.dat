However, in 1918, {{at the end}} of the First World War, the monarchies were abolished, the Republics of Austria and Hungary founded instead, and the family was forced into exile in Madeira. [...] Hungary did become a kingdom <b>again,</b> but <b>Charles</b> <b>was</b> never to regain the throne. Instead, Miklós Horthy ruled as regent until 1944, in a kingdom without a king.|$|R
5000|$|Born on March 3, 1870, Lettie B. Cowman {{would meet}} {{her future husband}} {{for the first time}} when she was just a baby. But, when she was 13, and he was 15 they met <b>again.</b> <b>Charles</b> <b>was</b> living away from home {{for the first time and}} the two befriended each other. It soon become {{apparent}} that they were destined to be sweethearts. At ages 19 and 21, they married and moved to Colorado for their first year of marriage. After Lettie became severely ill, it was clear that they could no longer live in such a high altitude, so they spent the next 10 years of their marriage in Chicago.|$|R
50|$|In 1892 {{brothers}} John and Charles Ruggles {{thought that}} they could make some easy money by robbing a stagecoach. On May 10, 1892, the brothers robbed the Weaverville stage, but the take was small. Later, on May 12, the brothers stopped the stage <b>again</b> but <b>Charles</b> <b>was</b> hit with buckshot fired by a guard riding inside the coach. The brothers were later arrested. On July 24, 1892, a lynch mob wearing masks entered the jail and took the brothers out of their cell. In {{what became known as}} the lynching of the Ruggles brothers, the two men were hanged together from a derrick.|$|R

50|$|<b>Charles</b> <b>is</b> Claudine's {{oldest son}} and {{is played by}} Lawrence Hilton-Jacobs. <b>Charles</b> <b>is</b> {{a member of an}} African American activist group who fight for {{positive}} social change for the African American community. Charles disapproves of his mother's relationship with Rupert because he thinks that Rupert will leave her just like the previous men she dated did. Charles believes that Rupert will get Claudine pregnant and simply leave her to become a single mother <b>again.</b> <b>Charles</b> <b>is</b> also discontented with the fact that Claudine has so many children and that she has to depend on welfare to help her raise them. At times, Charles does not even consider the younger children his siblings because he greatly dislikes the fact that Claudine had several children with different men. He also sees the welfare system as regressive for the African American community; therefore, he advocates the creation of more jobs for African Americans. Charles also disapproves of families or single mothers having too many children {{and not being able to}} support them financially. Therefore, one day he comes home and confesses to his mother about having had a vasectomy because he does not want to procreate and be stuck in a situation similar to his mother's.|$|R

40|$|<b>Again</b> it <b>was</b> <b>Charles</b> Cordier who secured these birds, {{this time}} for the Royal Zoological Society (Koninklijke Maatschappij voor Dierkunde) at Ant-werpen. In the year 1959 not less than three pairs reached Antwerpen again, {{followed}} by three males and four females in 1960 (12). The Royal Zoological Society at Antwerpen, con-sidering that the first aim should be trying to breed these rare birds in captivity, decided to spread the risks of keeping all the birds in one place. So one pair was send to Mr. Jean Delacours famous park at Clères and one pair to the Royal Zoological Garden at Rotterdam. The birds which were obtained in 1960 partly stayed at Antwerpen, partly went to the other park of the Antwerp Society, Planckendael. A single male at the Zoological Garden Kopenhagen and at the Zoological Garden Frankfort, completed, together with some single males in the United States, the whole stock of Congo Peacock outside Kongo. BREEDING RESULTS WITH CONGO PEACOCK The first results with breeding Congo Peacock in captivity were obtained in Kongo by Mr. T. Herrling 1938. A note on this breeding case, strangely enough a trio in {{which one of the}} hens laid three eggs from which after an incubation period of 26 days one chick hatched, has been given by Chapin (4). This first and only chick died however after four days. The Royal Rotterdam Zoological Garden had the good luck to be the first European Zoo to obtain eggs from the Congo Peacock and to raise the first chick in captivity. Some months later fertile eggs were ob-tained from one pair at Planckendael. After artifici-ally incubating of 8 days, the only egg left was given to a Bantam hen. It developed normally, but un-fortunately was destroyed by unknown cause only a few days before hatching, containing a well devel-oped chick (12). These results proved the possibility to breed and raise Congo Peacock in captivity, not only under tropical conditions {{as in the case of}} Mr. Herrling or under artificially tropical conditions as in Rotter-dam, but also under the conditions of a temperate climate as in Planckendael. THE BREEDING IN ROTTERDAM The breeding pair arrived directly from Kongo at Antwerpen, September 1959. They were brought t...|$|R
