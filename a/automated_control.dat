25|$|By {{the early}} 2010s, the terms 3D {{printing}} and additive manufacturing evolved senses {{in which they}} were alternate umbrella terms for AM technologies, one being used in popular vernacular by consumer-maker communities and the media, and the other used more formally by industrial AM end-use part producers, AM machine manufacturers, and global technical standards organizations. Until recently, the term 3D printing has been associated with machines low-end in price or in capability. Both terms reflect that the technologies share the theme of sequential-layer material addition or joining throughout a 3D work envelope under <b>automated</b> <b>control.</b> Peter Zelinski, the editor-in-chief of Additive Manufacturing magazine, pointed out in 2017 that the terms are still often synonymous in casual usage but that some manufacturing industry experts are increasingly making a sense distinction whereby AM comprises 3D printing plus other technologies or other aspects of a manufacturing process.|$|E
500|$|While the {{earliest}} real-time strategy games {{appeared in the}} 1980s, and others followed in the early 1990s, Westwood Studios's Dune II, released for DOS in 1992, established the pattern of modern RTS games. Blizzard Entertainment was surprised that no further RTS titles appeared in 1993 and early 1994 â€“ although in fact Westwood had quietly been working on Command & Conquer since the completion of Dune II. To {{take advantage of the}} lull in RTS releases, Blizzard produced Warcraft: Orcs & Humans. According to Bob Fitch, the theme for Warcraft had been inspired by taking the vikings of The Lost Vikings and combining with masses of creatures under their <b>automated</b> <b>control</b> similar to Lemmings, with the multiplayer element of having these opposing masses of vikings meet up and fight each other. While later [...] "...craft" [...] games were famous for complex stories presented lavishly, the first member of the series had no script and was improvised in the recording studio by producer Bill Roper. The contract composer Gregory Alper wrote music that Blizzard staff found reminiscent of Holst's The Planets. Demos in summer 1994 whetted appetites for the completed game, released for MS-DOS in November 1994 and for the Macintosh in 1996. The game was published by Blizzard in North America and by Interplay Entertainment in Europe, and Sold-Out Software republished the MS-DOS version in March 2002.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Much {{compliance}} effort concerns {{adherence to}} contracts. Con-trols {{are added to}} the business process to make sure the other party will fulfill his part of the contract. Controls have costs. In this paper we argue that fully <b>automated</b> <b>controls</b> help to lower control costs, because (i) they help to prevent misstatements (compliance by design) or (ii) they increase the quality of audit evidence and thereby reduce the audit risk and additional audit fees. The line of reasoning is illustrated by a case study of the implementation of <b>automated</b> <b>controls</b> on the procurement process for public transport services for the elderly and disabled. The case study suggests some open issues, which can be linked to concepts from Normative Multi Agent Systems...|$|R

Post-incident calculations estimate that the main control rod was actually withdrawn approximately , causing the reactor to go prompt critical, {{which resulted in the}} steam explosion. The fuel, portions of the fuel plates, and water surrounding the fuel plates vaporized in the extreme heat.

2500|$|In 1975, the Morgantown Personal Rapid Transit {{project was}} completed. It has five {{off-line}} stations that enable non-stop, individually programmed trips along an [...] track serviced by {{a fleet of}} 71 cars. This is a crucial characteristic of PRT. However, it is not considered a PRT system because its vehicles are too heavy and carry too many people. When it carries many people, it operates in a point-to-point fashion, instead of running like an automated people mover {{from one end of}} the line to the other. During periods of low usage all cars make a full circuit stopping at every station in both directions. Morgantown PRT is still in continuous operation at West Virginia University in Morgantown, West Virginia, with about 15,000 riders per day (...) [...] It successfully demonstrates <b>automated</b> <b>control,</b> but was not sold to other sites because the steam-heated track has proven too expensive for a system that requires an operation and maintenance budget of $5 million annually.|$|E
