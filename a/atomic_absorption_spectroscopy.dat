500|$|<b>Atomic</b> <b>absorption</b> <b>spectroscopy</b> (AAS) is a {{destructive}} technique that {{is able to}} determine the elements {{that make up the}} analyzed sample. [...] AAS performs this analysis by subjecting the sample to an extremely high heat source, breaking the atomic bonds of the substance, leaving free atoms. Radiation in the form of light is then passed through the sample forcing the atoms to jump to a higher energy state. [...] Forensic chemists can test for each element by using a corresponding wavelength of light that forces that element's atoms to a higher energy state during the analysis. [...] For this reason, and due to the destructive nature of this method, AAS is generally used as a confirmatory technique after preliminary tests have indicated the presence of a specific element in the sample. [...] The concentration of the element in the sample is proportional to the amount of light absorbed when compared to a blank sample. [...] AAS is useful in cases of suspected heavy metal poisoning such as with arsenic, lead, mercury, and cadmium. The concentration of the substance in the sample can indicate whether heavy metals were the cause of death.|$|E

40|$|Graduation date: 1990 Techniques {{have been}} {{developed}} for measuring the temperature, stable species concentrations, and atomic radical concentrations during a transient combustion event. They combine the features of direct sampling with two spectroscopic techniques to produce relatively simple diagnostic techniques to obtain time-resolved measurements.

Stable species were detected downstream of the sampling orifice by electron impact fluorimetry, while temperatures and atomic hydrogen concentrations were measured by <b>atomic</b> resonance <b>absorption</b> <b>spectroscopy.</b> The calculation of stable species concentrations from time-varying fluorescence signals was straightforward, however conversion from absorption measurements to temperatures and atomic radical concentrations required the development of a computer model of the radiation source and the absorption by the sample.

These direct sampling spectroscopic techniques minimize time-history distortions inherent in other direct sampling techniques, and are capable of tracking local temperatures and species concentrations during the passage of a propagating flame front...|$|R
40|$|International audienceSuperparamagnetic {{iron oxide}} {{nanoparticles}} (SPIONs) are recognized {{to be an}} attractive platform for developing novel drug delivery approaches and thus several types of functionalized magnetic nanocarriers based on SPIONs have been synthesized and studied. The coating of the metal oxide surface was achieved in a one-pot synthesis with biocompatible polyethylene glycol (PEG) and thermo-responsive modified Pluronic® F 68. The resulting thermo-responsive magnetic nanocarriers can incorporate water insoluble drugs into their hydrophobic compartment and later release them in a temperature dependent manner. Here we report novel magnetic nanocarriers with significant improvements regarding the colloidal stability and critical temperature obtained by mixing various molar ratios of hydrophilic PEG with thermo-responsive Pluronic® F 68 bearing different end group functionalities.

Methods The model of myocardial hypertrophy was established via incubation of mouse cardiac myocytes (MCM) with 300 nmol/L angiotensin Ⅱ (Ang Ⅱ) for 48 hours in vitro. After that, MICU 1 specific small interfering RNA (siRNA) was delivered to knockdown MICU 1 levels in MCM. On the other hand, adenovirus-mediated over-expression of MICU 1 was transfected into MCM. Accordingly, the expressions of ANP and BNP in myocardial cells were measured by qRT- PCR. Mitochondrial membrane potential and ATP contents were detected by JC- 1 assay kit and ATP assay kit, respectively. Then, Western blotting and qRT-PCR were used to detect the levels of MICU 1 in myocardial cells. The mitochondrial Ca 2 + contents were measured via <b>atomic</b> <b>absorption</b> flame <b>spectroscopy.</b> The size of myocardial cells was determined by α-actinin staining. Results Mitochondrial membrane potential and ATP contents in hypertrophic cardiomyocytes induced by AngⅡ were both decreased. Meanwhile, myocardial hypertrophy significantly increased mitochondrial Ca 2 + contents but decreased MICU 1 levels. With the method of genetic intervention, we found that MICU 1 deficiency exacerbated mitochondrial Ca 2 + overload, increased cell surface and elevated the expression of BNP. Conversely, the overexpression of MICU 1 obviously decreased mitochondrial Ca 2 + overload, cell surface of MCM and expressions of ANP and BNP. Conclusion MICU 1 alleviates AngⅡ-induced myocardial hypertrophy via inhibiting mitochondrial Ca 2 + overload. 		 		DOI: 10. 11855 /j. issn. 0577 - 7402. 2017. 12. 0...|$|R
