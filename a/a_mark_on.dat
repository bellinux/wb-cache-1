25|$|Before this {{discovery}} {{it had been}} speculated that Ramesses III {{had been killed by}} means that would not have left <b>a</b> <b>mark</b> <b>on</b> the body.

His mummy includes an amulet to protect Ramesses III in the afterlife from snakes. The servant in charge of his food and drink were also among the listed conspirators, but there were also other conspirators who were called the snake and the lord of snakes.|$|E
25|$|Gremlins 2 {{was shot}} in New York in June 1989, the film was {{released}} in 1990, and as the filmmakers later noted, {{this was a time}} when cable television, genetics, and frozen yogurt were becoming more common and influential. This left <b>a</b> <b>mark</b> <b>on</b> Gremlins 2. Gremlins 2 exaggerated what could be seen on cable television at the time, although as the filmmakers noted in 2002, that humour might be lost on present-day audiences. Cable television later grew to provide the same variety. Genetics in 1990 is reflected in the laboratory scene in Gremlins 2, and frozen yogurt is what the mogwai eat after midnight.|$|E
25|$|The Dorobanți villa, rebuilt by Alexandru Filipescu in 1913, {{was left}} to Constantin Basarab Brâncoveanu, {{and went on to}} serve as the head offices of the National Liberal Party. The street is known as Modrogan, which was also Vulpea's {{alternative}} nickname. Vulpea's life and deeds had already made <b>a</b> <b>mark</b> <b>on</b> literature and the theater, beginning in 1818 with the comedy Generalul Ghica, possibly written by Costache Faca. It shows Vulpea as a sex symbol, with Sultana Ghica swooning over his portrait. Vulpea was also an unseen character in an unpublished play by his former colleague Iordache Golescu, which romanticizes his encounter with Vladimirescu. Ion Ghica also relayed fictionalized anecdotes about Vulpea as the protector of barbers and the object of adulation by the clinically insane.|$|E

25|$|While {{the methods}} behind {{collecting}} bite mark {{evidence at the}} scene are leading toward greater standardization, the methodology behind analyzing bite marks is extremely variable because it depends upon the preference of the specific odontologist. As discussed earlier, there are several methods used to compare bite marks ranging from life sized photographs to computer enhanced 3-dimensional imaging. These methods vary in precision and accuracy, {{and there is no}} set standard by which to compare or analyze them. The lack of analytical standards leads to a wide array of interpretation with any bite mark evidence. Some odontologists even disagree on whether or not <b>a</b> <b>mark</b> <b>on</b> the body {{is the result of a}} bite. Therefore, the interpretation of evidence lies largely on the expertise of the forensic odontologist handling the case.|$|E
25|$|Hook, remembers {{about the}} last time he saw his father, when Gold arrives to confront him but Hook is steadfast in {{carrying}} out his plan. Meanwhile, Emma is determined to stop Hook and everyone follows her and tell the others to split up. Regina and Robin then run into Zelena, who vows to get custody of her daughter, only to be confronted by a group of Dark Ones who then place <b>a</b> <b>mark</b> <b>on</b> Emma's family and friends in a similar fashion. Gold explains to Emma that it is the Mark of Charon, who navigates the ferry to the Underworld. The Dark Ones plan to sacrifice the souls of the marked living, who will replace them in Hell. Then, the 21 resurrected Dark Ones march through Storybrooke, led by Nimue, to prepare for their final battle.|$|E
25|$|In 9:41, the mage-templar war is {{temporarily}} halted {{during the}} Conclave, {{a peace conference}} orchestrated by Divine Justinia. During the negotiations, an explosion destroys the Conclave, killing the Divine and many senior Chantry clerics, along with many mages and templars, and creates the Breach, a massive hole in the Veil, the magical boundary between the physical world and the Fade, the world of spirits. The only survivor of the blast is the player character, who emerges from a rift with <b>a</b> <b>mark</b> <b>on</b> their hand capable of closing the rifts {{that have sprung up}} in the Breach's wake, but no memory of what happened. After assisting Cassandra in closing several rifts, the player character begins to be referred to as the Herald of Andraste. With the Chantry leaderless, Cassandra and Leliana carry out one of the Divine's last orders and re-establish the Inquisition, the organization that predated the Chantry, in order to address the crisis, close the Breach, and defeat the one who created it.|$|E

25|$|Ignjat Job {{was born}} in Dubrovnik, on 28 March 1895. His father died when young Ignjat was only 5 years old. He {{attended}} school in Dubrovnik until 1910. An important influence on his early intellectual and artistic development was his older brother Cvijeto (1892–1915), whose art studies in Belgrade and Munich {{came to an end}} when he went off to fight in the First World War. As an active supporter for independence from Austria-Hungary, the young Ignjat Job was arrested in 1912 along with other young nationalists and sentenced to one month in prison. In 1913, while Job was only 18, his first daughter, Marija was born. Arrested again in 1914, he spent time in Šibenik prison, then removed to a mental hospital, thanks to good connections, until September 1916. Traumatic experiences from his two-year stay in the mental hospital oppressed Job in the years that followed, and left <b>a</b> <b>mark</b> <b>on</b> his work, most notably on Madmen in the Yard, a drawing thought to have been made between 1916 and 1919.|$|E
25|$|Next for the Fabulous Ones was {{the return}} of an old Nemesis, the Sheepherders – in this case Rip Morgan and Jonathan Boyd teaming up as the “Kiwi Sheepherders”. Boyd and Morgan quickly made <b>a</b> <b>mark</b> <b>on</b> Memphis by beating the Fabulous Ones for Southern Tag Team Championship on June 17, 1985. The team was soon {{stripped}} of the titles due to excessive cheating but had the titles returned to them when Boyd and Morgan threatened to sue CWA management over the incident. Instead of taking the titles from the Sheepherders by stripping them the Fabulous Ones took the Southern tag team titles from them the old fashioned way – 4 {{times in a row}} between September 5 and October 12. The Fabulous Ones won what {{would turn out to be}} their last Southern Tag Team Championship on October 12, their 15th Southern Title all together. Few realized that an era in Memphis wrestling was ending when Bill Dundee and Dutch Mantel beat the Fabulous Ones for the titles on November 11.|$|E
25|$|An {{alternative}} {{which is}} growing in practice {{is the use of}} a hollow piercing needle, as is done in body piercing. The piercer disinfects the earlobe with alcohol and puts <b>a</b> <b>mark</b> <b>on</b> the lobe with a pen. It gives the opportunity to the client to check whether the position is correct or not. Then, the piercer uses a clamp with flat ends and holes at the end to hold the earlobe, with the dot {{in the middle of the}} holes. This device will support the skin during the piercing process. A cork can be placed behind the earlobe to stop the movement of the needle after the piercing process, and protect the tip of the needle for the client's comfort. Then, the piercer places the hollow needle perpendicular to the skin's surface and check the position of the needle, to pierce at the desired place and the right angle. The piercing process consists of pushing the needle through the earlobe, until it gets out in the other side. The client has to remain still during all the process. Then, the clamp can be put off. After that, the piercer puts the jewel in the hollow needle and pushes the needle through until the jewel enters into the lobe. Then, the needle is removed and disposed properly. The jewel is attached to the lobe and the piercer disinfects the lobe again.|$|E
