5|$|In 1831 and 1848, serious {{outbreaks}} of cholera had overwhelmed the crowded cemeteries of London, causing bodies to be stacked in heaps awaiting burial, and even relatively recent graves to be exhumed {{to make way}} for new burials. Public health policy at this time was generally shaped by the miasma theory, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>bad</b> smells and risks of disease caused by piled bodies and exhumed rotting corpses caused great public concern.|$|E
5|$|On 15 April 1939, he {{returned}} to a muddy Hampden Park with England to claim a 2–1 victory in front of 142,000 rain-soaked supporters; he set up Tommy Lawton for the winner with seconds to spare. That summer {{was the last time}} the England would tour Europe before Hitler's Nazis were defeated. The first game was against Italy, who gave the English a warm reception despite Benito Mussolini's breast-beating <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>bad</b> blood of five years previous. Again the World Champions, the Italians managed to salvage a 2–2 draw at the San Siro after scoring with a clear handball; this time Matthews left the field with a chipped hip bone for his efforts. The next game was a 2–1 loss to Yugoslavia, with Matthews and captain Eddie Hapgood passengers in the game after picking up early injuries; this injury forced him to sit out the following encounter with Romania.|$|E
5|$|Television's {{debut album}} Marquee Moon, {{released}} in 1977, is frequently {{cited as a}} seminal album in the field. The no wave movement that developed in New York in the late 1970s, with artists such as Lydia Lunch and James Chance, is often treated as the phenomenon's U.S. parallel. The later work of Ohio protopunk pioneers Pere Ubu is also commonly described as post-punk. One {{of the most influential}} American post-punk bands was Boston's Mission of Burma, who brought abrupt rhythmic shifts derived from hardcore into a highly experimental musical context. In 1980, Australia's Boys Next Door moved to London and changed their name to the Birthday Party, which evolved into Nick Cave <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bad</b> Seeds. Led by the Primitive Calculators, Melbourne's Little Band scene would further explore the possibilities of post-punk. Later alternative rock musicians found diverse inspiration among these post-punk predecessors, as they did among their new wave contemporaries.|$|E

5|$|London's dead had {{traditionally}} been buried {{in and around}} local churches, and with {{a limited amount of}} space for burials, the oldest graves were regularly exhumed to free space for new burials. In {{the first half of the}} 19thcentury the population of London more than doubled, from a little under a million people in 1801 to almost two and a half million in 1851. Despite this rapid growth in population, the amount of land set aside for use as graveyards remained unchanged at approximately 300acres (0.5sqmi; 1.2km2), spread across around 200 small sites. Graveyards became very congested. Decaying corpses contaminated the water supply and the city suffered regular epidemics of cholera, smallpox, measles and typhoid. Public health policy at this time was generally shaped by the miasma theory (the belief that airborne particles were the primary factor in the spread of contagious disease), <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>bad</b> smells and risks of disease caused by piled bodies and exhumed rotting corpses caused great public concern. A Royal Commission established in 1842 to investigate the problem concluded that London's burial grounds had become so overcrowded that it was impossible to dig a new grave without cutting through an existing one.|$|E

25|$|Also in 1983, Bargeld {{joined the}} band The Birthday Party ({{featuring}} Nick Cave and Mick Harvey) as a guitarist.

25|$|Dirty Three {{formed as}} an {{instrumental}} rock trio in Melbourne in 1992 with Warren Ellis on violin and bass guitar (ex-These Future Kings in 1986), Mick Turner on lead and bass guitars (Sick Things, The Moodists, Venom P. Stinger, Fungus Brains), and Jim White on drums (People with Chairs Up Their Noses, Feral Dinosaurs, Venom P. Stinger). Prior {{to the formation}} of Dirty Three, Ellis studied classical violin, worked briefly as a school teacher in regional Victoria, then travelled as a busker in Europe. Ellis wrote music for theatre groups and plays before performing with Melbourne bands. Ellis was also a member of The Blackeyed Susans, Busload of Faith, Kim Salmon and the Surrealists and {{has been a member of}} Nick Cave <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bad</b> Seeds since 1994. Turner and White have a shared musical history via numerous common bands during the 1980s and early 1990s. Outside Dirty Three's activities, both have since contributed to other artists and groups. White's previous group Feral Dinosaurs also featured Conway Savage, also a member of Nick Cave <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bad</b> Seeds and The Blackeyed Susans. White also played on records by Hunters and Collectors and Tex, Don and Charlie.|$|E

Air sounds, such as blowing the plastic pipes with an air compressor, were greatly explored and used for this album: the working title of the album was, for a long while, Luftveränderung ("Change of air").|$|E

All the prisoners taken following the conflict were released by Winfield Scott {{at the end of}} August 1832, except Black Hawk who was taken east.

25|$|Control of or {{at least}} {{inclusion}} {{in the creation of}} a cultural epic is important because the traditional epic poem like The Odyssey or Virgil’s Aeneid is, at its core, a written history. Written history defines the good <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>bad</b> of a culture, the winners and losers, and the author of that history controls the very future by manipulating the knowledge of later generations. For Friedman to deny epic associations to the long poem because they are sometimes written by women is to counter the efforts of many female long poets.|$|E
