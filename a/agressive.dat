Pacifism covers a spectrum of views ranging from the belief that international disputes can and should all be resolved via peaceful behaviors; to calls for the abolition of various organizations which tend to institutionalize <b>agressive</b> behaviors, such as the military, or arms manufacturers; to opposition to any organization of society that might rely in any way upon governmental force. [...] Such groups which sometimes oppose the governmental use of force include anarchists and libertarians. [...] Absolute pacifism opposes violent behavior under all circumstance, including defense of self and others.|$|E

40|$|Using {{the letters}} {{exchanged}} between Freud and Einstein {{as a basis}} for study, the Italian physician, psychiatrist and philosopher Franco Fornari raises the issue of the survival of humanity, confronted with the threat of nuclear war. In his view, no economic or political formula can offer {{a solution to the problem}} without a psychoanalytic approach. The contribution of the Freudian legacy is to show that man can only overcome aggressive tendencies and death instincts by integrating them instead of projecting them into others. Similarly, when confronted with the threat of a war, citizens must develop an attitude of personal responsibility and turn their own guilt regarding any form of war into a means of confronting the new cataclysm. S'appuyant sur la correspondance Freud-Einstein, Fornari, médecin psychiatre et philosophe italien, pose le problème de la survie de l'humanité menacée par la guerre atomique. Il ne voit pas de solution dans les formules économiques et politiques mais seulement dans la démarche psychanalytique. En effet, les méthodes inspirées de Freud montrent que l'homme ne peut dépasser ses tendances <b>agressives</b> et ses désirs de mort qu'en les intégrant en soi au lieu de les projeter dans les autres. De même, en présence de la menace de la guerre, le citoyen doit récupérer le sens de sa propre responsabilité, et trouver dans le sentiment de sa culpabilité personnelle, à l'égard de toute forme de guerre, le moyen d'affronter le nouveau cataclysme...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT. Arctic fox (Alopex lagopus) {{populations in}} Scandinavia {{are small and}} {{restricted}} to alpine regions, while red foxes (Vulpes vulpes) are common throughout both Norway and Sweden. The two species are similar in behaviour and diet, and thus competition between them is likely. This study provides seven observations of aggressive interactions between the two species. One adult arctic fox and one cub were killed by red foxes, one male arctic fox was chased away from his den, one female arctic fox and a cub fled into the den as a red fox approached, four cubs fled into the den as a red fox walked upon it and once a red fox walked upon the arctic fox den when no arctic foxes could be seen. Only on one occasion did an arctic fox succeed in chasing away a red fox. Red fox predation {{may prove to be}} limiting to the small arctic fox population in Scandinavia, and arctic foxes can be displaced from good dens and the most productive regions. Key words: arctic fox (Alopex lagopus), red fox (Vilpes vulpes), interactions, predation, aggression, field observations, Scandinavia RESUME. En Scandinavie, la population des renards polaires (Alopex lagopus) est petite et se limite aux zones alpines, alors que le renard roux (Vulpes vuipes) est commun dans toute la Norvege et la Suede.

The principal aim was to find out whatt <b>agressive</b> actions are most common and frequent, how they aree dealt in group of children and possibilities to eliminate them by executing studied psychomotor activities. For monitoring has been used following tools: questionnaire for pedagogues, discussions with pedagogues, discussions with children, monitoring, experimenting. By realizing methods above has been reached the following results. The most common aggressive behaviour ferociousnesses are verbal offences, bitting, beating, kicking, poking, quarreling over sympathies in group of children or group position and friendship. One {{of the factors that}} influences such phenomenons is large number of children in classroom or impeding of movement and exercise needs of children.

40|$|Aim: <b>Agressive</b> {{posterior}} {{retinopathy of prematurity}} is {{a special}} subtype of retinopathy of prematurity. Accurate and timely diagnosis and treatment could prevent further ocular and visual morbidity. In this study, we aimed to evalute the outcomes of <b>agressive</b> posterior retinopathy of prematurity treated with diode laser photocoagulation. Material and Method: Records of preterm infants who were diagnosed as <b>agressive</b> posterior retinopathy of prematurity and treated with diode laser photocoagulation were reviewed. Associated perinatal findings and treatments were also evaluated. Anatomic and structural success (regression of ROP and attached macula) were evaluated. Progression of retinopathy or need of surgery in spite of treatment was described as failure. Results: Twenty six (46 %) male and 30 (54 %) female infants {{were included in the}} study. The mean birth weight was 1214. 26 gr (590 - 2250) and the mean gestational age was 28. 76 weeks (25 - 34). Seventeen (30 %), 31 (51 %), 30 (54 %), 18 (32 %) and 41 (72 %) infants had blood transfusion, jaundice, septicemia, anemia and respirator distress, respectively, 41 (72 %) patients had oxygen supplementation, 86 (86. 73 %) of 98 eyes had favorable outcomes, 76 (77. 55 %) eyes showed complete regression and 9 (9. 18) eyes had partial regression. Poor outcome was observed in 13 (13. 27 %) eyes and these progressed into stage 4 B and 5. Conclusions: <b>Agressive</b> posterior retinopathy of prematurity can be treated with diode laser photocoagulation with a high success rate. Observation of <b>agressive</b> posterior retinopathy of prematurity in premature newborns with a higher birth weight and advanced gestational age in our country can be evaluated as a signal to consider perinatal care more precisely in Turkey.

40|$|Multiple {{sclerosis}} is {{a chronic}} neurological {{disease of the}} central nervous system with unknown, autoimmune mechanism, and a progressive and disabling course. Lipid-specific oligoclonal IgM bands in cerebrospinal fluid have been associated with worse clinical forms of the disease. MicroRNAs regulate genetic expression and participate in physiological processes and in different diseases. For this reason, they have been postulated as potential molecular biomarkers both of diagnosis and prognosis in many diseases. In the research for this doctoral thesis, the role of microRNAs in cerebrospinal fluid in the early phases of relapsing-remiting multiple sclerosis has been studied and some microRNAs have been identified as candidates to be biomarkers of the diagnosis of the diesease and are associated to the presence of lipid-specific oligoclonal IgM bands, which have been related with more aggressive forms of multiple sclerosis. The expression of these microRNAs is associated to certain clinical and radiological variables of affected patientsL’esclerosi múltiple és una malaltia neurològica crònica del sistema nerviós central, d’etiologia no ben coneguda, mecanisme autoinmmunitari, curs progressiu i pronòstic heterogeni.

Method: The research design was Quasi experimental pre-post test without control group by providing intervention: CBT for 6 sessions (10 – 12 times intervention). The population was all patients in the rehabilitation unit with a nursing diagnosis: low self esteem and/or inffective coping strategies. There were 23 participants who involved in this investigation. The data was analized by using dependent and independent sample t, and anova tests. Result: The results showed that p value for depressive behaviours, <b>agressive</b> behaviurs, antisocial behaviors, and cognitive functions were 0. 914; 0. 001; 0. 039; 0. 003 respectively. The outcomes indicated that there was significant impact of CBT on <b>agressive</b> behaviors, antisocial behaviors, and cognitive functions (α = 0. 05, p value 0. 05). Discussion: It is argued that depressive symptoms might not be apparent for the users in rehabilitative phase. The findings also showed that there was significant relation between antisocial behaviors and the length of drug USAge. This affirms exsiting concepts in that long drug USAge brings about serious damage in the users 2 ̆ 7 behaviors and cognitive functions.

40|$|We {{show that}} {{industrial}} ownership structures, such as keiretsu groupings in Japan, may significantly impact firms ’ incentives {{to engage in}} FDI. While the previous literature has mainly focused {{on the cost of}} capital advantages enjoyed by keiretsu firms, this paper examines two relatively unexplored channels by which ownership structure matters for FDI incentives. The first channel involves the direct incentives generated via standard product and factor market interactions whereby keiretsu firms with cross-ownership consider more directly the congestion effects of further FDI into a market. The second channel involves the indirect incentives generated by sharing of information across keiretsu firms which reduces entry costs of subsequent FDI. We find that keiretsu firms are more <b>agressive</b> than non-keiretsu firms in their FDI strategies, that is, for any given parameter values they undertake FDI with a higher probability than independent firms. Furthermore, keiretsu firms adopt a more <b>agressive</b> investement strategy against indepenedent rivals than amongst themselves. Keywords: Foreign direct investment; Keiretsu...|$|E
