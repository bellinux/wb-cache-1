50|$|To take a {{dangerous}} photo sequence of a 500 lb. bomb detonating, Hoffman placed his camera {{two and a}} half feet from the center of impact. When the bomb left the plane, he pressed the <b>automatic</b> <b>shutter</b> <b>release</b> and ran. The bomb exploded only 20 feet away from him, and when the dust cleared, he found the bomb had hit precisely where it was supposed to, getting Hoffman accolades for the innovative shots featured in Lifes November 15, 1943 issue.|$|E
