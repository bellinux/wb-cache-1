5|$|In 2001, Bruce Rothschild {{and others}} {{published}} a study examining evidence for stress fractures and tendon avulsions in theropod dinosaurs {{and the implications}} for their behavior. Since stress fractures are caused by repeated trauma rather than singular events they <b>are</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> be caused by regular behavior than other types of injuries. The researchers found lesions like those caused by stress fractures on a dromaeosaurid hand claw, {{one of only two}} such claw lesions discovered {{in the course of the}} study. Stress fractures in the hands have special behavioral significance compared to those found in the feet, since stress fractures there can be obtained while running or during migration.

40|$|Objective: The aim of {{this study}} is to examine social, economic, and health factors related to paid work in well-functioning older adults and if and how these factors vary by race. Method: We used sex-stratified {{logistic}} and multinomial logistic regression to examine cross-sectional data in the Health, Aging, and Body Composition cohort study. The sample included 3, 075 community-dwelling Black (42 %) and White adults aged 70 to 79 at baseline. Results: Multinomial logistic regression analyses show Black men <b>were</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> work full-time, and Black women <b>were</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> work part-time. Men with ≥US$ 50, 000 family income <b>were</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> work full-time. Men with better physical functioning <b>were</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> work full- and part-time. Women with ≥US$ 50, 000 family income and fewer chronic diseases <b>were</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> work full-time. Women who were overweight and had fewer chronic diseases <b>were</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> work part-time. Discussion: Results suggest that well-functioning, older Black adults <b>were</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> work than their White counterparts, and working relates to better health and higher income, providing support for a productive or successful aging perspective...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: To {{identify}} subgroup sensitive {{physical activities}} using differential item functioning (DIF) analysis. Methods: A sub-unweighted sample of 1, 857 (males = 923 and females = 934) from the 2003 - 2004 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey Physical Activity (PA) questionnaire data {{was used for}} the analyses. Using Mantel-Haenszel, SIBTEST and ANOVA DIF methods, 33 specific leisure-time moderate and/or vigorous PA (MVPA) items were analyzed for DIF across race/ethnicity, gender, education, income and age groups. Results: Many leisure-time MVPA items were identified as large DIF items. When participating in the same amount of leisure-time MVPAs, non-Hispanic Blacks (NHB) <b>were</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> participate in basketball and dance activities than non-Hispanic Whites (NHW); NHW <b>were</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> participated in golf and hiking than NHB; Hispanics <b>were</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> participate in dance, hiking and soccer than NHW whereas NHW <b>were</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> engage in bicycling, golf, swimming, and walking than Hispanics; females <b>were</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> participate in aerobics, dance, stretching and walking than males whereas males <b>were</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> engage in basketball, fishing, golf, running, soccer, weightlifting and hunting than females; educated persons <b>were</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> participate in jogging and treadmill exercise than less educated persons; persons with higher incomes <b>were</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> engage in golf than those with lower incomes; and adults (20 - 59 yrs) <b>were</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> participate in basketball, dance, jogging, running, and weightlifting than older adults (60 + yrs), whereas older adults <b>were</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> participate in walking and golf than younger adults.

30|$|In {{terms of}} search theory, this {{reasoning}} {{means that the}} same job offer <b>is</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> represent an above-average, high-quality offer for unemployed than for employed individuals.

5|$|It is {{not clear}} whether men or women have higher rates of low back pain. A 2012 review {{reported}} a rate of 9.6% among males and 8.7% among females. Another 2012 review found a higher rate in females than males, which the reviewers felt was possibly due to greater rates of pains due to osteoporosis, menstruation, and pregnancy among women, or possibly because women were more willing to report pain than men. An estimated 70% of women experience back pain during pregnancy with the rate being higher the further along in pregnancy. Current smokers – and especially those who are adolescents – <b>are</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> have low back pain than former smokers, and former smokers <b>are</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> have low back pain than those who have never smoked.|$|E

5|$|Vitamins are {{classified}} as either water-soluble or fat-soluble. In humans there are 13 vitamins: 4 fat-soluble (A, D, E, and K) and 9 water-soluble (8 B vitamins and vitamin C). Water-soluble vitamins dissolve easily in water and, in general, are readily excreted from the body, {{to the degree that}} urinary output is a strong predictor of vitamin consumption. Because they are not as readily stored, more consistent intake is important. Fat-soluble vitamins are absorbed through the intestinal tract with the help of lipids (fats). Because they <b>are</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> accumulate in the body, they <b>are</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> lead to hypervitaminosis than are water-soluble vitamins. Fat-soluble vitamin regulation is of particular significance in cystic fibrosis.|$|E
5|$|American {{alligators}} {{have been}} documented using lures to hunt prey such as birds. This means {{they are among the}} first reptiles recorded to use tools. By balancing sticks and branches on their heads, American alligators are able to lure birds looking for suitable nesting material to kill and consume. This strategy, which is shared by the mugger crocodile, is particularly effective during the nesting season, in which birds <b>are</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> gather appropriate nesting materials.|$|E
