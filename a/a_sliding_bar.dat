50|$|Spring bridge: Also {{known as}} Astig, this variety {{consists}} of <b>a</b> <b>sliding</b> <b>bar</b> connecting the lenses {{which can be}} separated through a gentle pull. The bar is telescopic, consisting of two sliders within a tube-like spring, which provides the tension. The nose pads are usually cork and are attached directly to the frames. They can either be hinged or static. This variety was popular from the 1890s to the 1930s, after which they were seldom seen. They were created and marketed as 'sporting pince-nez', which were purportedly more difficult to jar from the face than the other varieties {{as well as being}} more comfortable to wear for longer periods. A major advantage was that one size could often fit a wide variety of nose shapes and sizes. This style was usually available only as a frame, with rimless examples being very difficult to find.|$|E
50|$|During the night, {{the player}} takes {{control of their}} {{selected}} hero, and can run around the forest from a 3rd person perspective. A night can consist of 1-6 waves, each wave consisting of any number of enemies. You have an axe at your disposal along with a historically accurate musket that is muzzle loaded. Players must interact with certain traps, while others are automatic. Melee combat brings with it a Fear Factor or FF mechanic, which represents the amount of intimidation you have over your enemies, {{as long as they}} fear you, they will not attack. FF is represented by <b>a</b> <b>sliding</b> <b>bar</b> on the HUD, and acts as a physical representation for your enemy's next attack. Another mechanic during the night is the wind, players must keep track of it so they do not get detected by enemies. Midway through the game, players also obtain an item allowing them to manipulate the wind to help lure enemies to traps.|$|E

40|$|Master of ScienceDepartment of Electrical and Computer EngineeringSteven WarrenHandgrip contractions are {{a useful}} {{exercise}} for assessing muscle fatigue in the forearm musculature. Most conventional hand-forearm ergometer systems require {{the researcher to}} manually guide subject activity, collect subject data, and assess subject fatigue after it has occurred. Since post-processing tools are not standardized {{for this type of}} experiment, researchers resort to building their own tools. This process can make comparing results between research groups difficult. This thesis presents updates to a hand-forearm ergometer system that automate the control, data-acquisition, and data-analysis mechanisms. The automated system utilizes a LabVIEW virtual instrument as the system centerpiece; it provides the subject/researcher interfaces and coordinates data acquisition from both traditional and new sensors. The system also processes the hand-forearm data within the LabVIEW environment as the data are collected. This allows the researcher to better understand the onset of subject fatigue while an experiment is in progress. System upgrades relative to prior work include the addition of new parameters to the researcher display, a change in the subject display from a binary up-down display to <b>a</b> <b>sliding</b> <b>bar</b> for better control over subject grip state, and a software update from a simple data acquisition and display system to a real-time processing system. The toolset {{has proven to be a}} viable support resource for experimental studies performed in the Kansas State University Human Exercise Physiology Laboratory that target muscle fatigue in human forearms. Initial data acquired during these tests indicate the viability of the system to acquire consistent and physiologically meaningful data while providing a useable toolset for follow-on data analyses...|$|E
50|$|The {{chromatic}} harmonica {{is a type}} of harmonica {{that uses}} <b>a</b> button-activated <b>sliding</b> <b>bar</b> to redirect air from the hole in the mouthpiece to the selected reed-plate desired. When the button is not pressed, an altered diatonic major scale of the key of the harmonica is available, while depressing the button accesses the same scale a semitone higher in each hole. Thus, the instrument is capable of playing the 12 notes of the Western chromatic scale. The chromatic harmonica can thus be contrasted with a standard harmonica, which can play only the notes in a given musical key.|$|R
50|$|The {{instrument}} was custom-built at Tanner's request. Tanner appreciated the theremin's sound, but wanted greater control of pitch and attack.

This {{contrasts with the}} hand movements in space that formed the original theremin's signal feature. The Electro-Theremin also produces a slightly less complex timbre than the original. This is not {{due to the nature}} of the instrument, but due to Dr. Theremin's intentional harmonic generation in the output of the Theremin, which Tanner did not do.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the development of}} a powered kneeankle prosthesis based on a variable compliance actuator. The prosthesis design is focused on the transfer of the energy dissipated by the knee during normal walking (negative work) to the ankle joint at plantar flexion (positive work). This work is part of the Cyberlegs project which consist in {{the development of a}} powered lower-limb orthosis-prosthesis system to assist unilateral amputees in daily activities. The ankle joint of the prosthesis is assisted by a slidingbar mechanically-adjustable-compliance-and-controllableequilibrium-position actuator (MACCEPA), a variant of previous MACCEPA designs used for biologically inspired robots. In contrast to its predecessors based on cable transmissions [1], the sliding-bar MACCEPA has a rigid three-link configuration with <b>a</b> <b>sliding</b> <b>bar,</b> as shown in Figure 1. The new configuration preserves the energystorage and variable-compliance functions of the previous actuators and avoids some of the problems related to the cable transmission (attachment issues, premature fatigue failure, etc.) The sliding-bar MACCEPA also provides a stiffening effect that might be convenient for human-robot interaction and the development of energy-efficient assistive devices [2]. In Figure 1, the nonlinear compliance of the actuator will be adjusted by means of a compression mechanism m that will act upon the linear spring of stiffness k. The torque at the ankle will be generated by controlling the position of the lever arm ac with respect to the fixed bar (attached to the shank of the prosthesis), and the interaction of the sliding bar cb and the spring (attached to the foot). N/m allows a reduction in the peak power of the ankle motor from 304 W to 110 W. This allows a reduction of the total weight of the system and a potential increase in both autonomy and level of assistance for the user. Elastomer springs will be used in the construction of the prototype to reduce the weight of the system. Power @ 1 step/sec (W...|$|E

Posteromedial corner ligament structures are quite complex and are not always clearly described in the literature.
