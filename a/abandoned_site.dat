5|$|In September 1623, {{a second}} colony led by Governor-General Robert Gorges {{was created in}} the <b>abandoned</b> <b>site</b> at Wessagusset. This colony was rechristened as Weymouth and was also unsuccessful, and Governor Gorges {{returned}} to England the following year. Despite that, some settlers remained in the village and it was absorbed into the Massachusetts Bay Colony in 1630.|$|E
5|$|Ownership of Amman {{following}} Sirghitmish's {{death in}} 1358 passed to successive generations of his descendants until 1395, when his descendants {{sold it to}} Emir Baydamur al-Khwarazmi, the na'ib as-saltana (viceroy) of Damascus. Afterward, part of Amman's cultivable lands were sold to Emir Sudun al-Shaykhuni (died 1396), the na'ib as-saltana of Egypt. The increasingly frequent division and sale {{of the city and}} lands of Amman to different owners signaled declining revenues coming from Amman, while at the same time, Hisban was restored as the major city of the Balqa in the 15th century. From then until 1878, Amman was an <b>abandoned</b> <b>site</b> periodically used to shelter seasonal farmers who cultivated arable lands in its vicinity and by Bedouin tribes who used its pastures and water.|$|E
5|$|Endecott's {{responsibility}} was {{to establish}} the colony and to prepare it {{for the arrival of}} additional settlers. The winters of 1629 and 1630 were difficult compared to those in England, and he called on the Plymouth Colony for medical assistance. His wife, who had been ill on the voyage over, died that winter. Other difficulties he encountered included early signs of religious friction among the colony's settlers (dividing between Nonconformists and Separatists), and poor relations with Thomas Morton, whose failed Wessagusset Colony and libertine practices (which including a May pole and dancing) were anathema to the conservative Puritanism practiced by most settlers in the Massachusetts Bay and Plymouth colonies. Early in his term as governor he visited the <b>abandoned</b> <b>site</b> of Morton's colony and had the Maypole taken down. When one group of early settlers wanted to establish a church independent of that established by the colonial leadership, he had their leaders summarily sent back to England.|$|E

40|$|Commercial and {{centralized}} drilling-fluid disposal (CCDD) sites {{receive a}} portion of spent drilling fluids for disposal from {{oil and gas exploration}} and production (E&P) operations. Many older and some <b>abandoned</b> <b>sites</b> may have operated under less stringent regulations than are currently enforced. This study provides a census, compilation, and summary of information on active, inactive, and <b>abandoned</b> CCDD <b>sites</b> in Louisiana, New Mexico, Oklahoma, and Texas, intended as a basis for supporting State-funded assessment and remediation of <b>abandoned</b> <b>sites.</b> Closure of <b>abandoned</b> CCDD <b>sites</b> is within the jurisdiction of State regulatory agencies. Sources of data used in this study on <b>abandoned</b> CCDD <b>sites</b> mainly are permit files at State regulatory agencies. Active and inactive sites were included because data on <b>abandoned</b> <b>sites</b> are sparse. Onsite reserve pits at individual wells for disposal of spent drilling fluid are not part of this study. Of 287 CCDD sites in the four States for which we compiled data, 34 had been abandoned whereas 54 were active and 199 were inactive as of January 2002. Most were disposal-pit facilities; five percent were land treatment facilities. A typical disposal-pit facility has fewer than 3 disposal pits or cells, which have a median size of approximately 2 acres each. Data from well-documented sites may be used to predict some conditions at abandoned sites; older <b>abandoned</b> <b>sites</b> might have outlier concentrations for some metal and organic constituents. Groundwater at a significant number of sites had an average chloride concentration that exceeded nonactionable secondary drinking water standard of 250 mg/L, or a total dissolved solids content of > 10, 000 mg/L, the limiting definition for underground sources of drinking water source, or both. Background data were lacking, however, so we did not determine whether these concentrations in groundwater reflected site operations. Site remediation has not been found necessary to date for most <b>abandoned</b> CCDD sites; <b>site</b> assessments and remedial feasibility studies are ongoing in each State. Remediation alternatives addressed physical hazards and potential for groundwater transport of dissolved salt and petroleum hydrocarbons that might be leached from wastes. Remediation options included excavation of wastes and contaminated adjacent soils followed by removal to permitted disposal facilities or land farming if sufficient on-site area were available...|$|R
25|$|Two groups {{occupied}} {{the site in}} prehistoric times. The Siouan-speaking Middle Missouri people (Initial Middle Missouri variant), ancestral to the historic Mandan people, first {{occupied the}} site sometime after about 900 AD. They built numerous earth lodges on the lower portion of the site. Caddoan-speaking Central Plains people (Initial Coalescent variant) moved into the area from southern areas (present-day Nebraska) sometime around 1150 AD. (The historic Arikara are a Caddoan people.) Whether they displaced the earlier group or moved onto an <b>abandoned</b> <b>site</b> is unknown. The Central Plains (Initial Coalescent) people built at least 55 lodges, mostly on {{the upper part of}} the site. There is no direct evidence that there was conflict between the two groups, and scholars have found evidence that both cultures changed gradually in relation to the other.|$|E

Some of these terms became the names thereafter. Alexander Rea, an officer of the Archaeological Survey department of the Madras Presidency within British India, published his survey of the site in 1885. Robert Sewell published his scholarly treatise A Forgotten Empire in 1900, bringing Hampi to the widespread attention of scholars. The growing interest led Rea and his successor Longhurst to clear and repair the Hampi group of monuments.|$|E

This interdisciplinary research which connects the fields of architecture, history, conservation, and digital humanities, looks into the materials recorded by the urban exploration (urbex) community and investigates their potential for the protection and documentation of decaying or demolished <b>abandoned</b> architectural heritage <b>sites.</b> For the management and dissemination of heritage information for the <b>abandoned</b> <b>sites,</b> more specifically, the recently demolished Château de Noisy, a famous urbex destination in Belgium, this study explores and builds upon the existing digital resources and looks into various tools and techniques to compile, curate and present this data to narrate the story of <b>abandoned</b> heritage <b>sites.</b> Additionally, through visualisation of data collected, cleaned, and compiled using the Flickr application programming interface (Flickr API) and Python, the changes in the urbex community’s activity since their debut on Flickr are observed. This research shows the value of the existing urbex digital data for documentation and potential conservation of <b>abandoned</b> heritage <b>sites</b> and demonstrates how a mindful digital narration of even a demolished heritage site can create an engaging and immersive experience which records and preserves the heritage and its story. Additionally, it can raise public awareness which in the case of deteriorating <b>abandoned</b> <b>sites</b> can lead to their potential revival...|$|R

40|$|The {{impact of}} {{peatland}} restoration on Diptera assemblages was studied across multiple organizational levels (taxon, size class, trophic group) among abandoned-mined, restored and natural sites of three bogs {{and the environmental}} variables affecting those assemblages were determined. More than 22, 000 individuals representing 716 species were collected using pan traps, sweeping and Malaise traps. Restored and <b>abandoned</b> <b>sites</b> were similar {{to each other and}} both distinct from natural sites as shown by small-size class, acalyptrate and trophic assemblages. However, <b>abandoned</b> <b>sites</b> showed much lower evenness and generally supported lower species richness than restored and natural sites, due to the dominance of one or two saprophagous species. The coverage of bare peat, Sphagnum mosses and ericaceous shrubs explained most of the variance in species composition. Those results suggest that restoration enhanced the recovery of high species diversity, although more than seven years are needed to recover a complete trophic structure or to enable species with low dispersal ability to recolonize to pre-disturbance levels...|$|R
