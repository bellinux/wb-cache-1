5|$|Mardas {{was jealous}} about the control the Maharishi had over Lennon, and {{during one of}} their {{frequent}} walks through the woods he asked Lennon why the Maharishi <b>always</b> <b>had</b> <b>an</b> accountant by his side. Lennon replied that the Beatles (or Lennon and Harrison) were considering donating {{a large part of}} their income to the Maharishi's bank accounts in Switzerland. When Mardas questioned the Maharishi about this, he offered money to Mardas to build a high-powered radio station, so he could broadcast Maharishi's teachings to the whole of India.|$|E
5|$|Hailing from Pomona, California, {{the members}} of Bonded by Blood met through mutual friends. The idea of {{creating}} a band was conceived by lead vocalist Jose Barrales, a singer with hardcore punk and crossover thrash backgrounds, influenced by groups like The Blackheads, Cryptic Slaughter, D.R.I. and Black Flag. He <b>always</b> <b>had</b> <b>an</b> appreciation for heavy metal music, {{but it was not}} until a friend recommended him to listen to Exodus that Barrales got into the thrash metal subgenre. Exodus' debut album Bonded by Blood had a profound impact on Barrales, and it was inspiring to the point he idealized the creation of a thrash metal band, as he had noticed that there were few or even no groups in this genre in the music scene.|$|E
5|$|The novel Soon I Will Be Invincible is {{the first}} novel by Austin Grossman, an {{established}} video games designer. Grossman {{had come from a}} literary family, son of Judith and Allen Grossman and brother of Lev Grossman, which had fostered his ambition to write his own novel. Instead, Grossman accepted a job working in the video game medium which he credited with teaching him to realistically portray creative characters and situations. He <b>always</b> <b>had</b> <b>an</b> interest in the superhero genre, citing Alan Moore and Frank Miller as literary influences. In the mid-1990s, the idea behind what would become his first novel came to him {{in the form of a}} supervillain's voice. Grossman spent the next few years casually developing the character that would become Dr. Impossible, adding supporting characters, and writing short stories. By 2006, Penguin's imprint Michael Joseph purchased the publishing rights for the UK, as did Rizzoli for an Italian version. By the time, the book was being published Grossman was 37 years old and had entered the University of California-Berkeley's doctoral program studying English Literature, specializing in Romantic and Victorian literature.|$|E

The war dissolved the confederation while distributing power in the Pacific. A second international war, the War of the Pacific (1879–83), further increased Chile's regional role, while adding considerably to its territory.|$|E
