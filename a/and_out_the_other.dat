5|$|Baxter's brigade {{was worn}} {{down and out}} of ammunition. At 3:00 p.m. he withdrew his brigade, and Gen. Robinson {{replaced}} it with the brigade of Brig. Gen. Gabriel R. Paul. Rodes then committed his two reserve brigades: Brig. Gens. Junius Daniel and Dodson Ramseur. Ramseur attacked first, but Paul's brigade held its crucial position. Paul had a bullet go in one temple <b>and</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>other,</b> blinding him permanently (he survived the wound and lived 20 more years after the battle). Before {{the end of the}} day, three other commanders of that brigade were wounded.|$|E

The original doors are on display inside the Ellwood House Visitors Center.|$|E
5|$|On 25 September, {{the same}} day the railway group returned, the brigade set out at 06:00 for Amman. Approaching from the north, they would be {{supported}} during the assault by the 2nd Light Horse Brigade. At 10:30 the regiment, with a machine-gun section and an artillery section, was ordered to move forward {{to the left of the}} Canterbury Mounted Rifles. The Turkish defenders were in redoubts surrounded by barbed wire. McCarroll sent a squadron to attack from the west, which came under Turkish machine-gun fire. Covered by the artillery the squadron was gradually able to advance. At 15:30 the reserve squadron galloped forward, dismounted and came under machine-gun fire. The regiment and Canterbury Mounted Rifles pushed forward. The 4th Squadron succeeded in reaching a double redoubt, but just as they were about to charge, sixty of the defenders surrendered and others withdrew along the Wadi Amman. By now the Canterbury Mounted Rifles had galloped into the town <b>and</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> side, capturing the Turkish defences there from the rear. The battle was over and the brigade captured 1,734 prisoners, twenty-seven machine-guns, five artillery pieces, 298 horses and other military supplies. That night the regiment camped in the Wadi Amman.|$|E

25|$|Later in 1944, Compton {{was shot}} through the {{buttocks}} while participating in Operation Market Garden, the Allies' ill-fated attempt to seize a number of bridges in the Netherlands and cross the Rhine River into Germany. The bullet traveled sideways, through {{one side of the}} buttocks <b>and</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> side. After a partial recovery, he returned to E Company in time for the siege in the frozen Ardennes that became known as the Battle of the Bulge. In January 1945, Compton left E Company for another assignment.|$|E

500|$|The {{impact was}} a {{substantial}} news event reported and discussed online, in print, and on television. There {{was a genuine}} suspense because experts held widely differing opinions over {{the result of the}} impact. Various experts debated whether the impactor would go straight through the comet <b>and</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> side, would create an impact crater, would open up a hole in the interior of the comet, and other theories. However, twenty-four hours before impact, the flight team at JPL began privately expressing a high level of confidence that, barring any unforeseen technical glitches, the spacecraft would intercept Tempel 1. One senior personnel member stated [...] "All we can do now is sit back and wait. Everything we can technically do to ensure impact has been done."

500|$|When she {{was growing}} up, Aaliyah {{attended}} Detroit schools and believed she was well-liked, but got teased for her short stature. She recalled coming into her own prior to age 15 and grew to love her height. Her mother would tell her to be happy that she was small and compliment her. Other children disliked Aaliyah, {{but she did not}} stay focused on them. [...] "You always have to deal with people who are jealous, but there were so few it didn't even matter. The majority of kids supported me, which was wonderful. When it comes to dealing with negative people, I just let it in one ear <b>and</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>other.</b> Those people were invisible to me." [...] Even in her adult life, she considered herself small. She had [...] "learned to accept and love" [...] herself and added: [...] "...the {{most important thing is to}} think highly of yourself because if you don't, no one else will".|$|E
500|$|... "The Sweet Escape" [...] {{received}} generally positive {{reviews from}} contemporary pop music critics. In a review for AllMusic, Stephen Thomas Erlewine described the song as [...] "an irresistible [...] track, {{driven by a}} giddy 'wee-oh!' hook and supported by a nearly anthemic summertime chorus". John Murphy of musicOMH referred to [...] "The Sweet Escape" [...] as [...] "a lovely, summery bouncy pop song with a very infectious chorus". Murphy compared the song to Weezer's 2002 single [...] "Keep Fishin'", and Blenders Ben Sisario compared it {{to the work of}} The Beach Boys. Alex Miller from the NME compared the song to Madonna's early work but added that it sounded [...] "cringey and saccharine". Anna Britten from Yahoo! Music commented that it sounded like music from 1970, specifically that of soul group Chairmen of the Board. Bill Lamb of About.com called the song [...] "a welcome change from the over-produced 'Wind It Up'", but noted that it [...] "easily jets in one ear <b>and</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> leaving little trace of its presence". MuchMusic's video review program Video on Trial referred to the song as [...] "incredibly intoxicating".|$|E

500|$|Thomas O'Leary, the {{wireless}} operator for ML 446, recalled {{the ferocity of}} incoming German fire, stating"One commando was remarking how pretty the tracer fire, red and green, was. A moment later one blew {{the back of his}} head out. I was down below with my tin hat because by now the bullets were going through (the boat) <b>and</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> side. If I wanted to get about I had to crawl on my hands and knees and I was lucky nothing came through at my level. We couldn't get in (to the objective) and all over a sudden the wounded started coming down. By then all our guns had jammed and most of the other ships were on fire."ML 177, the launch that had successfully taken off some of the crew from Campbeltown, was sunk on her way out of the estuary. [...] ML 269, another torpedo-armed boat, had the unenviable task of moving up and down the river at high speed to draw German fire away from the landings. Soon after passing Campbeltown it was hit and its steering damaged. It took ten minutes to repair the steering. They turned and started in the other direction, opening fire on an armed trawler in passing. Return fire from the trawler set their engine on fire.|$|E

Murat sent Belliard to demand Hohenlohe's surrender, which the Prussian {{declined}} again. By this time some of Lannes' infantry were on the field. Together with Grouchy and Lasalle (but not Beaumont), there were only 4,000 to 5,000 French confronting the Prussians. At this time, Massenbach was allowed to return to the Prussian lines. Completely deceived by the French, Massenbach reported to Hohenlohe that their enemies were now between them and Stettin. Murat asked for a head-to-head parley with Hohenlohe which was granted. The marshal lied to Hohenlohe on his [...] "word of honor" [...] that he was surrounded by 100,000 French in the corps of Lannes, Soult, and Bernadotte.|$|E

Meantime Pedro, being introduced to some kindling-wood and a bundle of dry sticks, had busied himself outside in lighting a fire, on which he placed a ready-filled kettle handed to him by Wang impassively, at arm's length, as if across a chasm.
