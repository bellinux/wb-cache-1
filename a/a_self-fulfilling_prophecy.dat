500|$|As {{lawyer for}} the UGG, Brownlee began to sympathize with the {{prevailing}} farmers' view that the eastern Canadian business establishment was hostile to their interests (for example, when the UGG wanted to sell twine, no manufacturer would supply it). [...] He recommended that the UGG reduce farmers' reliance on the eastern establishment by expanding its operations into insurance, investment, and real estate. [...] The result was the United Grain Growers Securities Ltd. [...] He also helped the UGG quietly sell the stock it held in the Home Bank of Canada when UGG directors began to doubt the bank's soundness; this subtlety was considered essential, as the directors were concerned that airing their doubts publicly would make the bank's failure <b>a</b> <b>self-fulfilling</b> <b>prophecy.</b> [...] When UGG Assistant General Manager J. R. Murray found an interested buyer, Brownlee advised Murray against insisting on an intricate written sales contract for fear that the buyer would sense the directors' concerns. [...] His advice was heeded, and the sale was concluded December 29, 1919. [...] The bank failed less than four years later.|$|E

[...] Fenwick writes that the est training draws influences from Synanon, Gestalt therapy, encounter groups, and Scientology. [...] She discusses the potential positive and negative psychological effects that can occur subsequent to taking the est training. [...] She analyzes the rules of the training, and the behavioral tools used by the trainers, and points out that the est personnel are not qualified to assess psychopathology. Fenwick asserts that tactics including sensory deprivation and the large group setting of 250people at a time help to make the training [...] "work". [...] She describes this as a [...] "compression chamber effect", and asserts that it leads to the [...] "hysterical confessions and the euphoric testimonials" [...] she observed in the course.|$|E
500|$|The main {{theme of}} Minority Report {{is the classic}} {{philosophical}} debate of free will vs. determinism. One of the main questions the film raises is whether the future is set or whether free will can alter the future. As critic C.A. Wolski commented, [...] "At the outset, Minority Report... promises to mine some deep subject matter, to do with: do we possess free will or are we predestined to our fate?" [...] However, {{there is also the}} added question of whether the precogs' visions are correct. As reviewer James Berardinelli asked, [...] "is the Precogs' vision accurate, or has it in some way been tampered with? Perhaps Anderton isn't actually going to kill, but has been set up by a clever and knowledgeable criminal who wants him out of the way." [...] The precog Agatha also states that since Anderton knows his future, he can change it. However, the film also indicates that Anderton's knowledge of the future may actually be the factor that causes Leo Crow's death. Berardinelli describes this as the main paradox regarding free will vs. determinism in the film, [...] "ere's the biggest one of all: Is it possible that the act of accusing someone of a murder could begin a chain of events that leads to the slaying. In Anderton's situation, he runs because he is accused. The only reason he ends up in circumstances where he might be forced to kill is because he is a hunted man. Take away the accusation, {{and there would be no}} question of him committing a criminal act. The prediction drives the act [...] <b>a</b> <b>self-fulfilling</b> <b>prophecy.</b> You can see the vicious circle, and it's delicious (if a little maddening) to ponder." [...] Film scholar Dean A. Kowalski argues that in this scenario free will still exists, as the perpetrators control their actions, and the precogs' visions are but the facts that resulted from their choices.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{examines}} doctors' and patients' {{views on}} the consequences of an increasingly common symptomatic diagnosis, chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS). Two studies were conducted: the first comprised interviews with 20 general practitioners; the second was a longitudinal study, comprising three interviews {{over a period of}} 2 years with 50 people diagnosed with CFS. Contrasts were apparent between doctors' practical and ethical concerns about articulating a diagnosis of CFS and patients' experiences with and without such a diagnosis. Seventy per cent of the doctors were reluctant to articulate a diagnosis of CFS. They felt constrained by the scientific uncertainty regarding its aetiology and by a concern that diagnosis might become <b>a</b> disabling <b>self-fulfilling</b> <b>prophecy.</b> Patients, by contrast, highlighted the enabling aspects of a singular coherent diagnosis and emphasized the negative effects of having no explanation for their problems...|$|R
40|$|The {{possibility}} that movements in market prices of assets or goods {{may be caused}} by <b>self-fulfilling</b> <b>prophecies,</b> called bubbles or sunspots, has long intrigued market observers. If bubbles or sunspots exist, market prices differ from their fundamental values, and markets do not necessarily allocate resources to their best possible uses. Some might argue then that public policies would be needed to alleviate such problems. This paper surveys {{the current state of the}} empirically-oriented literature concerning rational dynamic indeterminacies by which we mean <b>a</b> situation of <b>self-fulfilling</b> <b>prophecy</b> within <b>a</b> rational expectations model. The empirical work in this area concentrates primarily on indeterminacies in price levels, exchange rates and equity prices. We first examine a particular type of explosive indeterminacy, usually called a rational bubble, in a familiar model of equity pricing. We then consider empirical work relating to price level and exchange rate indeterminacies, before examining empirical studies of indeterminacies in stock prices. Finally, we take up some interpretive issues. We find that existing bubbles tests do not establish that rational bubbles exist in asset prices. ...|$|R

The appearance of the withering away of the state is deceptive, since it is the state itself that is enacting the distribution of functions that some observers interpret as a reduction in state power. The arguments for a return of big government are both strategic and tactical. Strategically, central government has been responsible for every major social policy advance in the United States in the twentieth century. Tactically, the institutions comprising decentralized governance, including local governments, non-profit foundations and community-based organizations, are inadequate to the task. The role of big government in pursuit of social justice entails discursive and regulatory functions, each in turn suggesting an attendant political project for academics and activists. What is at stake is not a quantitative redistribution of state power but a qualitative redirection of the purposes to which that power is applied.

By degrading the quality of the service â€” for example by scheduling trains to run at inconvenient times or frequencies (known as parliamentary train services) or by raising fares â€” transport operators can force passengers to take other modes of transport, justifying the view of the service owner that the service is no longer required (<b>a</b> kind of <b>self-fulfilling</b> <b>prophecy).</b>|$|R

Inequality persists but problem and remedy are reframedâ€” from integrating schools, to ensuring equal access in re-segregated settings, to closing the performance gap. As seen through ecological theory (R. S.
