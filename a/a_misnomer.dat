5|$|Although the area's first Spanish explorers {{named the}} feature Mesa Verde, {{the term is}} <b>a</b> <b>misnomer,</b> as true mesas are almost {{perfectly}} flat. Because Mesa Verde is slanted to the south, the proper geological term is cuesta, not mesa. The park {{is made up of}} several smaller cuestas located between canyons. Mesa Verde's slant contributed to the formation of the alcoves that have preserved the area's cliff dwellings.|$|E
5|$|Post {{is where}} {{mainstream}} music could have gone. While modern chart music hasn't gone there entirely, Björk {{opened up the}} space for a more enigmatic and less readily labelled style; she undoubtedly helped broaden the playing field. Modern music still, regularly, finds itself, like a dinosaur stuck in a tar pit, going nowhere and heading for extinction. Yet, there are pockets of air that artists like Björk - and those before her like Kate Bush - have pumped full of oxygen for the next generations of rare, raw and intense female talents - the Lordes and Sias of the world - to breath. In this way, the album title is <b>a</b> <b>misnomer.</b> Björk was a precursor rather than a late comer, less post than pre. Post stands today as {{a body of work}} that still informs the more marginal artistic fringes of modern music and reminds us how narrow and staid our world would be without outliers like Björk.|$|E
5000|$|The term [...] "Lower Assam" [...] {{is often}} <b>an</b> <b>misnomer</b> {{in spite of}} popular usage to refer the region. In scholary circles Western Assam was more {{frequently}} used to accurately define the region and differentiate it from Lower Assam Division.|$|R

5|$|Polycystic {{kidney disease}} (PKD) is a slowly {{progressive}} disease affecting Persian and Persian-related breeds, in which fluid-filled cysts expand within the kidneys, destroying functional tissue. While renal cysts are observed {{with a low}} incidence in Maine Coons, PKD appears to be <b>a</b> <b>misnomer</b> in this particular breed. In a recent study spanning 8 years, renal cysts were documented by ultrasound in 7 of 187 healthy Maine Coons enrolled in a pre-breeding screening programme. The cysts were mostly single and unilateral (6/7, 85.7%) small (mean 3.6mm in diameter) and located at corticomedullary junction (4/6, 66.7%), thus different in size, numbers and location from those observed in Persian-related breeds. In the same study, not only did all six Maine Coon cats with renal cysts test negative for the PKD1 mutation, proving the disease in these cats to be unrelated to the PKD observed in Persians and related breeds, but gene sequencing of these cats failed to demonstrate any common genetic sequences. The presence of renal cysts, {{in the absence of}} other changes, does not appear to negatively impact the patients' quality of life, as those for which follow-up was available were reported alive and well in adulthood. Although the exact nature and clinical relevance of renal cysts in Maine Coons is currently unknown, its screening is still recommended for pre-breeding assessment. Ultrasonography is currently the only valid diagnostic method for its detection in this breed.|$|E
25|$|In early news accounts, pure fission {{weapons were}} called atomic bombs or A-bombs, <b>a</b> <b>misnomer</b> since the energy comes {{only from the}} nucleus of the atom. Weapons {{involving}} fusion were called hydrogen bombs or H-bombs, also <b>a</b> <b>misnomer</b> since their energy comes mostly from fission. Practitioners favored the terms nuclear and thermonuclear, respectively.|$|E

5000|$|It is {{also known}} as neurohypophyseal {{diabetes}} insipidus, referring to the posterior pituitary (neurohypophysis), which is supplied by the hypothalamus in the brain. This condition has only polyuria in common with diabetes and although not mutually exclusive, with most typical cases, the name diabetes insipidus is <b>a</b> misleading <b>misnomer.</b> <b>A</b> better name might be [...] "hypothalamic-neurohypophyseal ADH deficiency".|$|R

50|$|The term Vatican Diplomatic Corps, if used to {{mean the}} Diplomatic Service of the Holy See, can be {{considered}} on two grounds <b>a</b> serious <b>misnomer</b> or at least gravely ambiguous.|$|R
25|$|For example, Stephanie J. Bird {{argues that}} self-plagiarism is <b>a</b> <b>misnomer,</b> since by {{definition}} plagiarism concerns {{the use of}} others' material.|$|E
25|$|The term is <b>a</b> <b>misnomer,</b> {{because the}} goal is the {{extraction}} of patterns and knowledge from large amounts of data, not the extraction (mining) of data itself.|$|E
25|$|In a way, prediabetes is <b>a</b> <b>misnomer</b> {{since it}} is {{an early stage of}} diabetes. It now is known that the health {{complications}} associated with type 2 diabetes often occur before the medical diagnosis of diabetes is made.|$|E
5000|$|... "Phenylisobutylamine" [...] {{is in fact}} <b>a</b> {{chemical}} <b>misnomer</b> because isobutylamine itself {{contains a}} branched chain. The correct name after this style for this class of compound would be [...] "phenylsecbutylamine".|$|R
50|$|The term 'Pinwheel nebula' is <b>an</b> antiquated <b>misnomer</b> used by {{observers}} before Edwin Hubble {{realized that}} many of these spiral shaped nebulae were actually 'island universes' or what we now call galaxies.|$|R

25|$|Some historians, such as John Clapham and Nicholas Crafts, {{have argued}} that the {{economic}} and social changes occurred gradually and the term revolution is <b>a</b> <b>misnomer.</b> This is still a subject of debate among some historians.|$|E
25|$|The word 'Acoli' is <b>a</b> <b>misnomer</b> {{that became}} adopted for {{convenience}} over the years. It refers to people {{known locally as}} Luo Gang. That is why the Lango neighbours refer to the Acoli as Ugangi, meaning people of the home.|$|E
25|$|Patients with Marfan-progeroid-lipodystrophy {{syndrome}} typically exhibit congenital lipodystrophy and a neonatal progeroid appearance. Sometimes {{identified as}} having neonatal progeroid syndrome, the term is <b>a</b> <b>misnomer</b> since they do not exhibit accelerated aging. The condition is caused by mutations near the 3'-terminus of the FBN1 gene.|$|E
30|$|A {{class of}} organic {{pigments}} made by precipitating a dye with a binder, the name derives from lac (a resinous secretion) {{and so is}} <b>an</b> interesting <b>misnomer,</b> {{having nothing to do}} with bodies of water.|$|R
5000|$|The {{main bar}} of the typical Australian pub, usually the largest, was the {{so-called}} [...] "Public Bar". However, this title was <b>an</b> ironic <b>misnomer,</b> since until the 1970s, only men were permitted to drink in Public Bars.|$|R
5000|$|He was {{appointed}} grand penitentiary shortly after election of Pope Innocent VI in December 1352 {{and given the}} epithet [...] "Angel of Peace", a title which quickly became <b>an</b> ironic <b>misnomer</b> given his future campaigns in the Papal States.|$|R
25|$|The term “flat bone” is {{something}} of <b>a</b> <b>misnomer</b> because, although a flat bone is typically thin, it is also often curved. Examples include the cranial (skull) bones, the scapulae (shoulder blades), the sternum (breastbone), and the ribs. Flat bones serve as points of attachment for muscles and often protect internal organs. Flat bones {{do not have a}} medullary cavity because they are thin.|$|E
25|$|The {{painting}} {{has been}} in the possession of the hotel for many years, and hotel staff believe that it was painted {{in the last years of}} the 19th century. It identifies Davidson as Canada's first lumberman, surely <b>a</b> <b>misnomer.</b> He was, perhaps, the first English speaking person to establish a significant commercial lumber business in Canada. But long before, French settlers cut trees for their own use and for local markets.|$|E
25|$|The {{collection}} of all morphisms from X to Y is denoted homC(X,Y) or simply hom(X, Y) {{and called the}} hom-set between X and Y. Some authors write MorC(X,Y), Mor(X, Y) or C(X, Y). Note that the term hom-set is something of <b>a</b> <b>misnomer</b> as the {{collection of}} morphisms {{is not required to}} be a set. A category where hom(X, Y) is a set for all objects X and Y is called locally small.|$|E
5000|$|Buford Highway near Atlanta, Georgia, nicknamed [...] "Chambodia" [...] for {{the city}} is named Chamblee, Georgia. This is <b>a</b> common <b>misnomer.</b> There are {{actually}} very few Khmer businesses in the Buford Highway area. It is predominantly Chinese, Vietnamese, and Mexican.|$|R
50|$|The term, {{degenerative}} disc {{disease is}} <b>a</b> slight <b>misnomer</b> {{because it is}} not technically a disease, nor is it strictly degenerative. It is not considered a disease because degenerative changes in the spine are natural and common in the general population.|$|R
5000|$|So, {{the term}} imprecise {{probability}} - although <b>an</b> unfortunate <b>misnomer</b> as it enables more accurate quantification of uncertainty than precise probability - {{appears to have}} been established in the 1990s, and covers a wide range of extensions of the theory of probability, including: ...|$|R
25|$|The {{chronology}} {{is sometimes}} called the Ussher-Lightfoot chronology because John Lightfoot published a similar chronology in 1642–1644. This, however, is <b>a</b> <b>misnomer,</b> as the chronology is based on Ussher's work alone and not that of Lightfoot. Ussher deduced that {{the first day of}} creation fell upon, October 23, 4004BC, in the proleptic Julian calendar, near the autumnal equinox. Lightfoot similarly deduced that Creation began at nightfall near the autumnal equinox, but in the year 3929 BC.|$|E
25|$|It {{has been}} argued that the very term 'tragedy of the commons' is <b>a</b> <b>misnomer</b> per se, since 'the commons' {{originally}} referred to a resource owned by a community, and no individual outside the community had any access to the resource. However, the term is presently used when describing a problem where all individuals have equal and open access to a resource. Hence, 'tragedy of open access regimes' or simply 'the open access problem' are more apt terms.|$|E
25|$|Nomological {{determinism}} is {{the most}} common form of causal determinism. It is the notion that the past and the present dictate the future entirely and necessarily by rigid natural laws, that every occurrence results inevitably from prior events. Quantum mechanics and various interpretations thereof pose a serious challenge to this view. Nomological determinism is sometimes illustrated by the thought experiment of Laplace's demon. Nomological determinism is sometimes called 'scientific' determinism, although that is <b>a</b> <b>misnomer.</b> Physical determinism is generally used synonymously with nomological determinism (its opposite being physical indeterminism).|$|E
50|$|The term badge {{engineering}} is <b>an</b> intentionally ironic <b>misnomer,</b> {{in that little}} or no actual engineering takes place.|$|R
5000|$|According to {{original}} blueprints of {{the locomotive}} from GMD, CN's own equipment diagram books, {{and the original}} GMD manual for this locomotive, it is consistently {{referred to as a}} GMD-1 rather than a GMD1.
