40|$|The {{status of}} water quality of Irish {{estuaries}} is reviewed; this {{sheds light on}} the rationale behind {{the design of the}} national monitoring programme. Relative to other EU Member States, Ireland 2 ̆ 7 s coastal monitoring programme is relatively young and not as advanced. The monitoring programmes in Ireland pre Water Framework Directive (WFD) were structured on a salinity-based typology, with an emphasis on quantifying the variability of the component elements. Although monitoring is a significant obligation under the WFD, there is little guidance on developing monitoring protocols; Member States are developing <b>ad</b> <b>hoc</b> <b>monitoring</b> programme. The Irish Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), responsible authority, undertook research programmes to assist design and implementation of the WFD. A substantial new national monitoring programme was developed. However, the Irish programme is not optimised; the programme is being refined to include elements not yet covered, notably the biota. New research, by the authors, aims to develop a robust approach towards monitoring integrating data and model results. This paper presents changes in Irish marine water quality monitoring policy and some of the associated research necessary to change policy. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E

This process is complicated due to limited radio range and mobility of nodes. Unlike conventional IDSs, {{it is not}} possible to monitor nodes for long durations.

Moreover other environmental conditions like radio interference and congestion increase false positives, complicating classication of legitimate nodes and attackers. We present a scheme that helps in accurate diagnosis of malicious attacks in <b>ad</b> <b>hoc</b> networks. Our scheme employs cross-layer interactions based on observations at various networking layers to decrease the number of false positives.

40|$|In {{order to}} face with various {{contexts}} and situations, autonomous robots should be endowed with many different sensors and behaviors. These requirements pose new challenges such as the coordination of multiple parallel activities and the efficient use of the limited sensorial and cognitive resources. These challenges are often tackled by relying on a priori and well defined coordination schema among behaviors, and on fixed periodic or <b>ad</b> <b>hoc</b> <b>monitoring</b> strategies. Our working hypothesis is that adaptive control strategies, inspired by natural cyclic processes, {{can be used to}} cope with these problems. However, the development of these flexible strategies may result hard to be modeled and implemented. Recently, the possibility of abstracting an implementation view into an architectural design is getting more achievable. Hence, in this paper, we propose a modeling framework that allows developers to model simple behavior-based robotic systems enhanced by the use of Central Pattern Generators (CPGs) for modulating the sensor-motor loops. Different from other approaches, the use of CPGs, here, is to efficiently exploit the limited sensorial and cognitive resources, and to coordinate the multiple activities the robot is endowed with, by balancing sensors elaboration and action execution. The framework can use these models to generate robotic control executable code for analysis purposes. In this paper, we focus on parallel behaviors managing analysis...|$|E

It is this unique combination of skills that allows the surveyor to not only collect and analyse data vital to understanding the impacts of climate change, but also to grasp many of the complex human, political and physical interactions that arise in dealing with climate change issues. Understanding {{the full extent of the}} complex interactions that are part of climate change science requires not just <b>ad</b> <b>hoc</b> <b>monitoring</b> of the earth, but rather integrated earth measurement and monitoring systems, many of which are satellite based.

40|$|Pseudoreplication {{is defined}} as the use of {{inferential}} statistics to test for treatment effects where treatments are not replicated and/or replicates are not statistically independent. It is a genuine but controversial issue in ecology particularly in the case of costly landscape-scale manipulations, behavioral studies where ethics or other concerns may limit sample sizes, <b>ad</b> <b>hoc</b> <b>monitoring</b> data, and the analysis of natural experiments where chance events occur at a single site. Here key publications on the topic are reviewed to illustrate the debate that exists about the conceptual validity of pseudoreplication. A survey of ecologists and case studies of experimental design and publication issues are used to explore the extent of the problem, ecologists’ solutions, reviewers’ attitudes, and the fate of submitted manuscripts. Scientists working across a range of ecological disciplines regularly come across the problem of pseudoreplication and build solutions into their designs and analyses. These include carefully defining hypotheses and the population of interest, acknowledging the limits of statistical inference and using statistical approaches including nesting and random effects. Many ecologists face considerable challenges getting their work published if accusations of pseudoreplication are made – even if the problem has been dealt with. Many reviewers reject papers for pseudoreplication, and this occurs more often if they haven't experienced the issue themselves. The concept of pseudoreplication is being applied too dogmatically and often leads to rejection during review. There is insufficient consideration of the associated philosophical issues and potential statistical solutions. By stopping the publication of ecological studies, reviewers are slowing the pace of ecological research and limiting the scope of management case studies, natural events studies, and valuable data available to form evidence-based solutions. Recommendations for fair and consistent treatment of pseudoreplication during writing and review are given for authors, reviewers, and editors...|$|E
40|$|The phase II {{clinical}} trial {{is a critical}} step in the drug development process. In the oncology setting, phase II studies typically evaluate one primary endpoint, which is efficacy. In practice, a binary measurement representing {{the response to the}} new treatment defines the efficacy. The single-arm, multiple-stage designs are popular and the Simon 2 -Stage design is preferred. Although the study designs evaluate the efficacy, the subject 2 ̆ 7 s safety is an important concern. Safety is monitored through the number of grade 3 or grade 4 toxic events. The phase II {{clinical trial}} design based on the primary endpoint is typically augmented with an <b>ad</b> <b>hoc</b> <b>monitoring</b> rule. The studies are designed in two steps. First, the sample size and critical values are determined based on the primary endpoint. Then an ad hoc toxicity monitoring rule is applied to the study. Previous authors recommended a method to monitor toxic events after each patient is enrolled which is also known as continuous toxicity monitoring. A trial designed at the JG Brown Cancer Center combined the Simon 2 -Stage design with continuous toxicity monitoring. We describe how to integrate the continuous toxicity monitoring methodology with the Simon 2 -Stage design for response. Theoretical justification is given for the nominal size, power, probability of early termination (PET), and average sample size (ASN) of the combined testing procedure. A series of simulations were conducted to investigate the performance of the combined procedure. We discover that the type I error rate, type II error rate, PET, and ASN are subject to the correlation between toxicity and response. In fact, the study may have a smaller type I error rate than expected. The theoretical expressions derived to describe the operating characteristics of the combined procedure were utilized to create a new flexible, bivariate, multistage clinical trial. The design is considered flexible because it can monitor toxicity on a different schedule than response. An example is considered in which toxicity is measured after four equally spaced intervals and the response is evaluated only at the second and fourth toxicity examinations. This example corresponds to a data monitoring committee 2 ̆ 7 s meeting schedule that may happen every 6 months over a two year span. The effect of the correlation on the type I and type II error rates is examined through simulation. The simulations also examine the power over the range of response rates with a fixed toxicity rate in the alternative region and vice-versa. There are several single-arm, multiple-stage clinical trial designs that consider multiple endpoints at the same time. A subset of the designs includes those that consider both efficacy and toxicity as binary endpoints. A common problem, considered after the conduct of the trial, is appropriate inference given the repeated examinations of the multiple endpoints. We propose a uniformly minimum variance unbiased estimator (UMVUE) for the response in a multistage clinical trial design incorporating toxicity effects. The proposed estimator and the typical maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) are evaluated through simulation. The estimator requires further modification when continuous toxicity monitoring is combined with a multistage design for response. The modified estimator maintains low bias over the range of possible response values. The larger phase lIb or phase III clinical trial is the logical extension of the bivariate research based on exact calculations. The phase lIb or III clinical trials typically include an ad hoc toxicity monitoring rule ensuring participant protection. The designs also include provisions to allow early stopping for futility or efficacy utilizing group sequential theory or stochastic curtailment. We also examine a novel large sample clinical trial design that incorporates correlation between the response and toxicity events. The design uses the typical critical values associated with the standard normal distribution. It also searches for critical values specific to the global hypothesis associated with both response and toxicity. The bivariate test is then combined with efficacy and safety monitoring based on a flexible time-varying conditional power methodology. The type I and type II error rates of the bivariate test procedure, along with the bivariate test procedure combined with the conditional power methodology, are investigated through simulation. A modification is developed for the conditional power methodology to preserve the type I and type II error rates. In the end, the research extends the bivariate clinical trial designs in an attempt to make them more appealing in practice. Although, the research resulted in positive outcomes, additional work is required...|$|E

Defects generally evolve, under repeated loadings, into a delamination or debonding between adjacent laminae, and cannot be easily detected as they are masked by the composite skin: <b>ad</b> <b>hoc</b> health <b>monitoring</b> systems are therefore required. To prevent any distortion of the composite microstructure, which may trigger by itself the nucleation of the aforementioned defects, sensors should not be embedded inside the composite; in addition, to avoid a mechanical interaction between the monitoring system and the structure, sensors should be as lighter as possible.

All introduced protocols for <b>ad</b> <b>hoc</b> networks are based on different assumptions and security requirements, and are consequently suited for specific applications only. Due to the broad field of applications, a general security model can still not be found in any literature. We define two <b>ad</b> <b>hoc</b> network categories, namely mobile <b>ad</b> <b>hoc</b> networks (MANETs) and smart sensor network, and discuss all further definitions and observations separately for both implementations. The main contribution of this report is the clear definition of properties, parameters, architectures, security requirements, and authentication models of <b>ad</b> <b>hoc</b> networks. Furthermore, we derive design goals for all protocols to be implemented in <b>ad</b> <b>hoc</b> networks. We also provide an extensive overview of present and future <b>ad</b> <b>hoc</b> network applications, used standards, and proposed solutions. We believe that the authentication of network nodes {{and the establishment of}} secret keys among nodes are both target security objectives in <b>ad</b> <b>hoc</b> networks. The constrained devices and other special properties of <b>ad</b> <b>hoc</b> networks make achieving those security properties a challenging task. We comprehensively discuss proposed protocols in each introduced authentication model, state their features and drawbacks, and identify their limitation of use. We show that providing entity authentication and authentic key exchange in <b>ad</b> <b>hoc</b> networks is a security problem still not satisfyingly solved. The next contribution of this paper is the introduction of a general protocol framework for the implementation of authentication and key establishment protocols in <b>ad</b> <b>hoc</b> networks. The combination of the derived design goals and the protocol framework enables us to examine existing <b>ad</b> <b>hoc</b> network protocols and to develop new authentication and key establishment protocols that are applicable in <b>ad</b> <b>hoc</b> networks while meeting the network’s security requirements at the same time...|$|R
