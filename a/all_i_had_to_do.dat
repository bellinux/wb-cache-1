[...] Attles was a defensive specialist who rarely scored, yet went 8–8 from the field and hit his single free throw. He later lamented, [...] "In the game where I literally couldn't miss, Wilt had to go out and score 100." ...|$|E
500|$|For {{her fourth}} album, The House (2010), Melua worked with {{producer}} William Orbit. She {{said about the}} experience: [...] "The whole thing has been really exciting. It was the same feeling I had the first time I went skydiving. I was really quite nervous, but I knew <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> was let myself go and {{it was going to}} feel amazing. I wasn't {{trying to get away from}} anything. It was more about going towards something. I wanted the music to be inspired by the future, something unknown that's never been heard before, but at the same time hold on to the values of the music of the past, to try and tap into something that's so ancient and old that it's kind of forgotten. I thought that, if we went far enough in both directions, we could end up in the same place".|$|E
500|$|The {{experience}} saw {{a change}} in the dog, with Frank later writing, [...] "She wasn't that tame, obedient dog anymore, she was a skinny animal that kept herself alive through cunning and instinct." [...] Because of the remoteness of the work camp, she was at a reduced risk from the local population who Frank feared would eat her. Frank credited Judy with saving his life during his time spent there, [...] "She saved my life in so many ways. The greatest way of all was giving me a reason to live. <b>All</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> was look at her and into those weary, bloodshot eyes and I would ask myself: What would happen to her if I died? I had to keep going. Even if it meant waiting for a miracle." [...] A radarman named Tom Scott later wrote that Frank and Judy shared an unusual bond, with Frank able to send the dog into the jungle with a click and recall her with a whistle. On one occasion, Frank found Judy attempting to bury an elephant's leg bone.|$|E

500|$|In 1969, {{his first}} {{official}} {{year on the}} track, he won the All American Futurity and eight other stakes races. In winning the All American, he led from the start on a sloppy, muddy track. His jockey, Willie Lovell, explained {{that he needed to}} do very little to win: [...] "In the stretch, when I saw Easy Jet had it, I let him run his own race. <b>All</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> was just sit there and let him roll." [...] His time of 20.46seconds to cover [...] was remarkable considering that three days of rain {{before the start of the}} race had turned the track into a muddy quagmire. At another stakes, the Ribbon Futurity at Sallisaw, Oklahoma, Easy Jet won by three-quarters of a length and set a new track record of 16.92seconds for [...] The only time in 1969 he did not finish first, second, or third, he had issues in the starting gate, false-started, broke some teeth loose against the front of the gate, and was struggling to stand up again when the gates opened; he still managed to finish fifth out of ten horses.|$|E
500|$|At {{least five}} {{species have been}} given {{scientific}} names honoring Colbert. In 2008 a species of California trapdoor spider was named Aptostichus stephencolberti. The spider was named for Colbert after he reported on his television series that Jason Bond, a {{professor of biology at}} East Carolina University, had named a different species of spider Myrmekiaphila neilyoungi after the Canadian rock star Neil Young, and began to appeal for a species of animal to be named after him. On a later edition of The Colbert Report, Colbert revealed that Bond would name a spider after him, with Colbert claiming, [...] "And <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> was shamelessly beg on national television." [...] Other species named for Colbert include a species of Venezuelan diving beetle named Agaporomorphus colberti and a Chilean stonefly named Diamphipnoa colberti, both formally described in 2008. On his 45th birthday, Colbert was sent a framed print of his eponymous beetle by the biologists who named it. In 2014, a species of parasitic wasp from Ecuador, Aleiodes colberti, was named for Colbert, along with newly described species named for celebrities Jon Stewart, Jimmy Fallon, Ellen DeGeneres, and Shakira, and in 2016 a rove beetle, Sonoma colberti, was named after Colbert's on-screen persona.|$|E
500|$|Shakira was {{mindful of}} the many critics who would judge her second album, because of the [...] "phenomenon" [...] label applied to her. She knew that some would say that [...] "she had changed too much" [...] and others would reproach her if she {{remained}} the same. [...] "All I could do was to be myself. I understood that <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> was write the music I knew how to write and to write from the heart when I was compelled to. In that way, everything developed naturally, more so than I could have imagined", she said. In addition, Shakira insisted on perfection, working on the material {{to the point of}} exhaustion. [...] "I made two or three demos of each song. I became a human being so demanding of myself that until the song made my hair stand on end, I wouldn't stop". For the recording of Dónde Están los Ladrones? they were used old amplifiers to achieve a better sound, a German microphone with more than 40 years of existence and made several innovations in the instrumental mixes. Dónde Están los Ladrones? took nine months to produce in total, since more people worked on the album compared with her previous record. Shakira commented, [...] "To me it's a normal time, the gestation period for a baby. But many people wag their finger and tell me that the next one cannot take so long..." ...|$|E

However, the citizens of Williamsport applauded Bresnahan for his ingenuity, eventually prompting the club to retire his number 59. At the retirement ceremony in 1998, Bresnahan was quoted as saying, [...] "Lou Gehrig had to play in 2,130 consecutive games and hit [...]340 for his number to be retired, and <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> was bat [...]140 and throw a potato." ...|$|E
2500|$|In a 1986 Globe and Mail interview, Shaver {{said that}} she was being {{considered}} for a role in Joshua Then and Now, which would have promoted her career much farther than Desert Hearts. Donna Deitch assured her over the phone that she was right for her movie and told her she refused to hang up the phone until she got an answer. After five minutes, Shaver accepted the role. Shaver explained her feelings about the film. [...] "I was scared, not about the lesbianism [...] the script said, 'The passion builds' in the love scene, so once I knew how the passion built and where the camera would be, that was fine [...] but because someone wanted me to do what I'd wanted to do all along, and here it was, and <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> was say yes. I had always wanted to carry a movie. Now, if I never make another one, I've done this. For the first time, I feel I've done a complete work on film." ...|$|E
2500|$|According to Washburn, he and Cimino {{spent three}} days {{together}} in Los Angeles at the Sunset Marquis, hammering out the plot. The script eventually went through several drafts, evolving into a story with three distinct acts. Washburn did not interview any veterans to write The Deer Hunter nor do any research. [...] "I had a month, that was it," [...] he explains. [...] "The clock was ticking. Write the fucking script! But <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> was watch TV. Those combat cameramen in Vietnam were {{out there in the}} field with the guys. I mean, they had stuff that you wouldn't dream of seeing about Iraq." [...] When Washburn was finished, he says, Cimino and Joann Carelli, an associate producer on The Deer Hunter who went on to produce two more of Cimino's later films, took him to dinner at a cheap restaurant off the Sunset Strip. He recalls, [...] "We finished, and Joann looks at me across the table, and she says, 'Well, Deric, it's fuck-off time.' I was fired. It was a classic case: you get a dummy, get him to write the goddamn thing, tell him to go fuck himself, put your name on the thing, and he'll go away. I was so tired, I didn't care. I'd been working 20 hours a day for a month. I got on the plane the next day, and I went back to Manhattan and my carpenter job." ...|$|E

2500|$|Jimmy [...] was an {{education}} for me, {{as he was}} for most people who {{came in contact with}} him. ... taught me about art and developed my taste, but I didn't begin to understand about making work until later with Yvonne Rainer. [...] From her I found out {{what it is to be}} an artist [...] a person who makes choices and stands behind them. [...] Then, from working with Trisha Brown in the Grand Union, I learned how to edit, how to boil a thing down to its essence. Jimmy's approach was much more whimsical. His way of working led you [...] or led me at any rate [...] to accept any idea as valid simply because I'd thought of it. [...] I thought of it and I kept it, and what came next was what I thought of next. [...] I don't believe Jimmy meant to absolve me of all responsibility for my work, but I got the impression that wild intuitive guessing was <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> to make art. [...] I never threw anything away. [...] I remember distinctly Jimmy's saying, [...] "If you don't like it now, you can get to like it. [...] If you can't get to like it, who says you have to like it?" [...] The point of it was to demystify art and free the artist from the limitations of his own taste. [...] There was a great sense of liberation that stemmed from John Cage's championing of this philosophy, and Jimmy, among others, was establishing alternatives to the kind of teaching that had dominated modern-dance composition up until then.|$|E
