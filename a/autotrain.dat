5|$|The <b>autotrain</b> {{introduced}} to serve this branch also operated on the Amlwch line: when not running to Red Wharf Bay the motor train would operate between Llangefni and Gaerwen while the main branch train {{was on the}} round trip from Llangefni to Amlwch and back.|$|E
5|$|Although some {{preparatory work}} was carried out, the {{outbreak}} of the Second World War in 1939 brought the electrification north of Rickmansworth to a halt. First class travel was abandoned by the LPTB, along with the Pullman cars, and the line was operated entirely as a shuttle service. In 1940 the Chesham branch was converted to <b>autotrain</b> working, in which the trains could be driven from each end, thus avoiding the time-consuming repositioning of the locomotive. LNER C13 Class locomotives were used for this push-pull working, along with two three-car sets of antiquated Ashbury passenger cars dating from 1898.|$|E
25|$|In 1940 the unelectrified Chesham branch was {{converted}} to <b>autotrain</b> working, {{in which the}} trains could be driven from each end, thus avoiding the time-consuming repositioning of the locomotive. LNER C13 Class locomotives were used for this push-pull working, along with two three-car sets of Ashbury bogie stock from the multiple units that had become surplus after the introduction of O stock. The Bluebell Railway has four of the 1898–1900 Ashbury and Cravens carriages, and a fifth, built at Neasden, is at the London Transport Museum.|$|E
5000|$|Several {{locomotive}} classes included examples {{equipped to}} work in <b>autotrains</b> at different times. These included: ...|$|R
50|$|<b>Autotrains</b> {{could operate}} {{with one or}} two coaches: either with the {{locomotive}} {{at the rear of the}} formation, or sandwiched between the two driving coaches.|$|R
50|$|Other {{changes to}} various {{locomotives}} over their long lives were Belpaire fireboxes, enlarged coal bunkers, and even superheaters. One or two were fitted with spark-arresting chimneys. 21 were fitted for working <b>autotrains.</b>|$|R
25|$|The {{single track}} section from Epping to Ongar was not {{electrified}} until 1957, prior {{to which the}} service was operated by an <b>autotrain,</b> carriages attached to a steam locomotive capable of being driven from either end, hired from British Railways, and an experimental AEC three-car lightweight diesel multiple unit operated part of the shuttle service Monday-Friday in June 1952. Upon electrification, 1935 Stock was used, until replaced by four-car sets of 1962 Stock specially modified {{to cope with the}} limited current. The section closed in 1994, and is now the heritage Epping Ongar Railway.|$|E
25|$|Construction {{restarted}} {{after the}} war, {{and the western}} extension opened as far as Greenford in 1947 and West Ruislip in 1948. The powers to extend the line to Denham were never used due to post-war establishment of the Green Belt around London, which restricted development {{of land in the}} area. The eastern extension opened as far as Stratford in December 1946, with trains continuing without passengers to reverse in the cutting south of Leyton. In 1947 the line opened to Leytonstone, and then Woodford and Newbury Park. Stations from Newbury Park to Woodford via Hainault and from Woodford to Loughton were served by tube trains from 1948. South of Newbury Park, the west-facing junction with the main line closed in the same year to allow expansion of Ilford carriage depot. The extension transferred to London Underground management in 1949, when Epping began to be served by Central line trains. The single line to Ongar was served by a steam <b>autotrain</b> operated by British Rail (BR) until 1957, when the line was electrified. BR trains accessed the line via a link from Temple Mills East to Leyton.|$|E
2500|$|For example, {{within the}} [...] "small" [...] group, the GWR 5400 Class {{locomotives}} {{were derived from}} the William Dean -designed GWR 2021 Class (an enlargement of the 850 Class), with larger wheels for higher top speed and fitted with <b>autotrain</b> apparatus ('auto-fitted') for push-pull passenger work. The GWR 6400 Class were similar to the 5400 Class, also being auto-fitted, but having the same size wheels as the 5700. [...] The GWR 7400 Class were {{very similar to the}} 6400 Class, but were not auto-fitted and had a higher boiler pressure.|$|E
25|$|The 5700s {{were never}} fitted remote control gear for working <b>autotrains.</b> This {{was left to}} smaller pannier {{locomotives}} that followed; the 5400 class (introduced in 1930) and the 6400 Class (introduced in 1932).|$|R

50|$|The Great Western Railway (GWR) 6400 Class is a {{class of}} 0-6-0 pannier tank steam {{locomotive}} introduced by Charles Collett in 1932. All 40 examples were 'auto-fitted' - equipped with the remote-control equipment needed for working <b>autotrains.</b>|$|R

50|$|Withdrawals {{started in}} 1914, {{services}} {{being replaced by}} <b>autotrains.</b> Three were sold and one was destroyed in a fire but most were converted into trailers. However, by the 1923 grouping 53 remained in service and it was October 1935 before they were all withdrawn.|$|R
25|$|The no. 522, GWR 517 Class 0-4-2 {{saddle tank}} {{locomotive}} (built at Wolverhampton in 1868), was affectionately {{known as the}} Marlow Donkey. No. 522 was rebuilt at Swindon Works in 1884 and similar Metro 2-4-0 class locomotives remained in service until 1935 when <b>autotrains</b> were introduced.|$|R
50|$|The {{nominally}} Collett-designed 5400 Class had 5 ft {{driving wheels}} for greater top speed with autocoaches, and were all fitted with the required remote control gear for working the push-pull <b>autotrains.</b> They had a modern cab {{and a larger}} bunker. They were frequently seen on inner suburban routes from Paddington.|$|R

50|$|When {{one or more}} autocoaches are {{connected}} to a suitably equipped steam locomotive, the combination is known as an auto-train, or, historically, a railmotor train. A steam locomotive provided with the equipment {{to be used as}} an <b>autotrain</b> is said to be auto-fitted.|$|E
50|$|<b>Autotrains</b> {{were being}} used by most rail {{companies}} in Great Britain by the 1920s, and were particularly common on branch line services. They remained in widespread use until the 1950s and 1960s, when they were replaced by diesel multiple units (DMUs). They were in effect the ancestor of the modern driving trailers.|$|R
50|$|Visibility {{is greatly}} {{improved}} from the cab, and fumes from the chimney do not fill a forward cab in tunnels. However, the crew's {{prospects in the}} event of a collision are worse, and if the driver and fireman are in separate places it is difficult for them to communicate, just as in <b>autotrains.</b>|$|R
50|$|The Great Western Railway (GWR) 5800 Class was a twenty-strong {{class of}} 0-4-2T side tank steam locomotive. These were {{introduced}} in 1933 for light branch work. They were similar to the GWR 1400 Class but were not equipped for working <b>autotrains.</b> The entire class was scrapped. The last survivor number 5815 was with withdrawn in 1956.|$|R
50|$|The <b>autotrain</b> {{introduced}} to serve this branch also operated on the Amlwch line: when not running to Red Wharf Bay the motor train would operate between Llangefni and Gaerwen while the main branch train {{was on the}} round trip from Llangefni to Amlwch and back.|$|E
50|$|None of the 3571s {{was ever}} fitted for <b>autotrain</b> working. They {{spent most of}} their lives in the Chester and Birkenhead areas; all but two survived to the 1940s, and three into the British Railways era. The last was No. 3574, {{withdrawn}} in December 1949.|$|E
5000|$|The first {{company to}} use the system was the Great Western Railway which, in 1904, {{equipped}} carriages and 0-6-0 locomotives as an <b>autotrain</b> to run on the Brentford Branch Line (between Southall and Brentford) as an experimental substitute for steam railcars. Control was by rodding and the mechanism allowed the driving compartment to be either one or two carriages-distant from the engine. With the engine {{in the middle of}} a formation, up to four carriages could be used. To reduce the surprise of a locomotive at the [...] "wrong" [...] end of its train, some were initially fitted with panelling painted in carriage livery. The experiment was successful and the company's remaining railcars were gradually converted for <b>autotrain</b> use and purpose-built units constructed.|$|E
50|$|Early {{vehicles}} were {{built by a}} number of independent companies, but in 1844 the railway started to build carriages at Swindon railway works, which eventually provided most of the railway’s stock. Special vehicles included sleeping cars, restaurant cars and slip coaches. Passengers were also carried in railmotors, <b>autotrains,</b> and diesel railcars. Passenger-rated vans carried parcels, horses, and milk and at express speeds.|$|R
50|$|The United Kingdom and France (for example Voiture État à 2 étages) {{had many}} {{examples}} of push-pull steam trains, or <b>autotrains</b> and railmotors on branch lines which include at least partial control of a steam locomotive from a remote cab. These provided many of the operational benefits of a multiple unit, although none incorporated any form of electrical/electronic multiple-unit train control.|$|R

50|$|The {{southern}} terminus of the Amtrak <b>AutoTrain</b> in Sanford, Florida, uses a wye to {{turn the}} locomotives around for the trip back North. A road that crosses {{the eastern side of}} the Wye allows access to the inner part of the wye where a rock supply company now stands.|$|E
50|$|After {{the line}} was {{converted}} to standard gauge on 23 May 1892 {{a number of small}} tank locomotives, including the unique 4-4-0ST no. 13 were used on the line. In later years standard GWR 1400 Class 0-4-2Ts worked the <b>autotrain.</b> The final trains were worked by British Rail Class 122 single-car DMUs.|$|E
50|$|The Ballymacarrett rail crash {{occurred}} on 10 January 1945 at 7:50am in the Ballymacarrett area of Belfast, County Down, Northern Ireland on the Belfast to Bangor Line of the Belfast and County Down Railway, when a train {{led by a}} heavy <b>autotrain</b> driving trailer ran {{into the back of}} a stopped passenger train consisting of lightweight wooden coaches. 22 died with 27 injured. It was the worst crash in Northern Ireland since 1889. The cause was found to be carelessness of the driver of the <b>autotrain</b> (also called a railmotor) who was running too fast for conditions. Fog, unsafe railway rules, and possible distraction from passengers all may have contributed to the accident. Old lightweight rolling stock contributed to the great number of injuries and deaths. The accident led to the demise of the railway which was nationalised three years later.|$|E
50|$|From 1868, the Great Western Railway built {{a number}} of {{standard}} gauge 0-4-2T classes for branch line passenger work to a design known as the 517 class by engineer George Armstrong. This design was developed until the GWR 1400 Class was built between 1932 and 1936, designed for push-pull <b>autotrains.</b> These were the last British examples of this wheel arrangement. Four {{of them have been}} preserved.|$|R
50|$|The Southern Railway also {{operated}} push-pull trains {{of up to}} two carriages in commuter areas. Push-pull operations did {{not need}} the time-consuming use of a turntable or run-around {{at the end of}} a suburban branch line, and enabled the driver to use a cab in the end coach to drive the locomotive in reverse. Such operations were similar to the <b>autotrains,</b> with a Drummond M7 providing the motive power.|$|R
5|$|Great Western trains {{included}} long-distance {{express services}} such as the Flying Dutchman, the Cornish Riviera Express and the Cheltenham Spa Express. It also operated many suburban and rural services, some operated by steam railmotors or <b>autotrains.</b> The company pioneered the use of larger, more economic goods wagons than were usual in Britain. It operated a network of road motor (bus) routes, {{was a part of}} the Railway Air Services, and owned ships, docks and hotels.|$|R
