In addition, the other great contribution of the Cyanobacteria cited is the origin of plants. The chloroplast with which plants make food for themselves is actually a cyanobacterium living within the plant cells, a process known as endosymbiosis.

50|$|French and U.S. {{scientists}} found {{a type of}} granite by studying images and chemical results of 22 rock fragments. The composition of the rocks was determined with the ChemCam instrument. These pale rocks are rich in feldspar and may contain some quartz. The rocks are similar to Earth's granitic continental crust. They are like rocks called TTG (Tonalite-Trondhjemite-Granodiorite). On the Earth, TTG was common in the terrestrial continental crust in the <b>Archean</b> <b>era</b> (more than 2.5 billion years ago). By landing in Gale crater, Curiosity was able to sample a variety of rocks because the crater dug deep into the crust, thus exposing old rocks, {{some of which may}} be about 3.6 billion years old. For many years, Mars was thought to be composed of the dark, igneous rock basalt, so this is a significant discovery.|$|E
50|$|An {{alternative}} {{model of}} solar evolution {{may explain the}} faint young Sun paradox. In this model, the early Sun underwent {{an extended period of}} higher solar wind output. This caused a mass loss from the Sun on the order of 5−10 percent over its lifetime, resulting in a more consistent level of solar luminosity (as the early Sun had more mass, resulting in more energy output than was predicted). In order to explain the warm conditions in the <b>Archean</b> <b>era,</b> this mass loss must have occurred over an interval of about one billion years. However, records of ion implantation from meteorites and lunar samples show that the elevated rate of solar wind flux only lasted for a period of 0.1 billion years. Observations of the young Sun-like star &pi;1 Ursae Majoris matches this rate of decline in the stellar wind output, suggesting that a higher mass loss rate can not by itself resolve the paradox.|$|E
50|$|Mount Taishan rises {{abruptly}} {{from the}} vast plain of central Shandong, and is naturally endowed with many scenic sites. Geologically, it is a tilted fault-block mountain, higher {{to the south}} than north, and is {{the oldest and most}} important example of the paleo-metamorphic system representative of the Cambrian Period in eastern China. Referred to as the Taishan Complex, it comprises magnetized, metamorphic, sedimentary rock and an intrusive mass of various origins that were formed in the <b>Archean</b> <b>Era</b> 1700-2000 million years ago. Subsequently, in the Proterozoic Era, the Taishan region began to rise, becoming part of the continent {{by the end of the}} era. Uplift continued until the middle of the Cenozoic Era. The gneiss which emerged in the Taishan region is the foundation for all of North China. Cambrian strata, fully emerged in the north, are rich in fossils. Six streams flow from the summit, their water renowned for its extremely low mineral content, slight acidity (pH = 6.3) and relatively high oxygen content (6.4 milligrams per liter (mg/l)).|$|E
40|$|Natural phosphides- the {{minerals}} containing phosphorus in a redox state lower than zero – are common constituents ofmeteorites but virtually unknown on the Earth. Herein we present the first rich occurrence of iron-nickel phosphides of terrestrial origin. Phosphide-bearing rocks are exposed in three localities in the surroundings of the Dead Sea, Levant: {{in the northern}} Negev Desert, Israel and Transjordan Plateau, south of Amman, Jordan. Seven minerals from the ternary Fe-Ni-P system have been identified with five of them, NiP 2, Ni 5 P 4, Ni 2 P, FeP and FeP 2, previously unknown in nature. The {{results of the present}} study could provide a new insight on the terrestrial origin of natural phosphides – the most likely source of reactive prebiotic phosphorus at the times of the early Earth. Phosphides as likely sources of prebiotic phosphorus Phosphorus, one of life essential elements, exists under current geochemical conditions in the pentavalent state as orthophosphate ion (P 51 O 4) 32. However, at the times of the early Earth the situation might be very different: recently, phosphite species, (HP 31 O 3) 22, containing reduced trivalent phosphorus, have been identified inmarine sediments related to the <b>Archean</b> <b>era</b> 1. It was suggested that the phosphorus(III) served as a precursor of prebiotic organophosphorus compounds 2, 3, which raises an important question on the origin of reduced phosphorus in the <b>Archean</b> <b>era.</b> The plausible hypothesis assumes that the phosphite ions could be generated by the oxidation o...|$|E
40|$|It {{is found}} that dark {{reduction}} of photooxidized primary electron donor P 870 + in reaction centres from purple anoxygenic bacteria (two non-sulphur Fe-oxidizing Rhodovulum iodosum and Rhodovulum robiginosum, Rhodobacter sphaeroides R- 26 and sulphur alkaliphilic Thiorhodospira sibirica) is accelerated upon {{the addition of}} Mn 2 + jointly with bicarbonate (30 – 75  mM). The effect is not observed if Mn 2 + and HCO 3 − {{have been replaced by}} Mg 2 + and HCO 2 −, respectively. The dependence of the effect on bicarbonate concentration suggests that formation of Mn 2 +–bicarbonate complexes, Mn(HCO 3) + and/or Mn(HCO 3) 2, is required for re-reduction of P 870 + with Mn 2 +. The results are considered as experimental evidence for a hypothesis on possible participation of Mn–bicarbonate complexes in the evolutionary origin of oxygenic photosynthesis in the <b>Archean</b> <b>era...</b>|$|E
40|$|In the <b>Archean</b> <b>era</b> (3. 8 – 2. 5 Ga ago) the Earth {{probably}} {{lacked a}} protective ozone column. Using data {{obtained in the}} Earth’s orbit on the inactivation of Bacillus subtilis spores we quantitatively estimate the potential biological effects of such an environment. We combine this practical data with theoretical calculations to propose {{a history of the}} potential UV stress {{on the surface of the}} Earth over time. The data suggest that an effective ozone column was established at a pO 2 of; 5 3 1023 present atmospheric level. The improvement in the UV environment on the early Proterozoic Earth might have been a much more rapid event than has previously been supposed, with DNA damage rates dropping by two orders of magnitude in the space of just a few tens of millions of years. We postulate that a coupling between reduced UV stress and increased pO 2 production could have contributed toward a positive feedback in the production of ozone in the early Proterozoic atmosphere. This would contribute to the apparent rapidity of the oxidation event. The data provide an evolutionary perspective on present-day Antarctic ozone depletion...|$|E
30|$|In contrast, the {{exposure}} of mantle peridotite at the ocean floor was probably rare in the Archean (Takai et al. 2006). Modern abyssal peridotite is frequently observed near slow-spreading ridges without sufficient magmatic supply because large-scale normal faults (e.g., detachment faults) penetrate deeply, and the mantle peridotite is dragged up to the seafloor (Escartín et al. 2003). However, it has been revealed that the Archean oceanic crust was much thicker than the modern equivalent owing to the higher potential mantle temperature at that time (Moores 2002; Ohta et al. 1996; Komiya 2004; Shibuya et al. 2007, 2012). The thicker ocean crust would have limited the development of deep normal faults reaching to the mantle and exposure of mantle peridotite, {{which has led to}} the hypothesis that the early Archean H 2 -rich hydrothermal environment was mainly driven by komatiite volcanism instead of much less abundant fault-related peridotite (Takai et al. 2006). This hypothesis is further substantiated by the results obtained in this study and {{can be applied to the}} Hadean. The serpentinization of ADK may have generated abundant H 2 -rich (ca. 20  mmol/kg) hydrothermal fluid and proximal H 2 -rich hydrothermal fluid–seawater mixing zones in the Hadean ocean, which could potentially have served as nurseries for prebiotic chemical evolution and the subsequent emergence and early evolution of life on Earth. Furthermore, considering that the oceanic crust was probably sufficiently thick throughout the Hadean and Archean to limit {{the exposure}} of peridotite on the seafloor and that ADK disappeared after the early Archean, the Hadean era was more favorable for the emergence of life than the <b>Archean</b> <b>era</b> in terms of H 2 -rich hydrothermal environments.|$|E
40|$|The <b>Archean</b> <b>Era</b> of the Earth is not {{a direct}} analog of the present {{tectonics}} of Venus. In this regard, {{it is useful to}} review the state of the Archean Earth. Most significantly, the temperature of the adiabatic interior of the Earth was 200 to 300 C hotter than the current temperature. Preservation biases limit what can be learned from the Archean record. Archean oceanic crust, most of the planetary surface at any one time, has been nearly all subducted. More speculatively, the core of the Earth has probably cooled more slowly than the mantle. Thus the temperature contrast above the core-mantle boundary and the vigor of mantle plumes has increased with time on the Earth. The most obvious difference between Venus and the present Earth is the high surface temperature and hence a low effective viscosity of the lithosphere. In addition, the temperature contrast between the adiabatic interior and the surface, which drives convection, is less on Venus than on the Earth. It appears that the hot lithosphere enhanced tectonics on the early Venus significantly enough that its interior cooled faster than the Earth's. The best evidence for a cool interior of Venus comes from long wavelength gravity anomalies. The low interior temperatures retard seafloor spreading on Venus. The high surface temperatures on Venus enhance crustal deformation. That is, the lower crust may become ductile enough to permit significant flow between the upper crust and the mantle. There is thus some analogy to modern and ancient areas of high heat flow on the Earth. Archean crustal blocks typically remained stable for long intervals and thus overall are not good analogies to the deformation style on Venus...|$|E
40|$|The {{hydrocarbons}} {{preserved in}} an Archean rock were extracted, and their composition and distribution in consecutive slices {{from the outside}} {{to the inside of}} the rock were examined. The 2. 7 Ga rock was collected from the Fortescue Group in the Pilbara region, Western Australia. The bitumen I (solvent-extracted rock) and bitumen II (solvent-extracted hydrochloric acid-treated rock) fractions have different hydrocarbon compositions. Bitumen I contains only trace amounts of aliphatic hydrocarbons and virtually no aromatic hydrocarbons. In contrast, bitumen II contains abundant aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbons. The difference seems to reflect the weathering history and preservational environment of the investigated rock. Aliphatic hydrocarbons in bitumen I are considered to be mainly from later hydrocarbon inputs, after initial deposition and burial, and are therefore not indigenous. The lack of aromatic hydrocarbons in bitumen I suggests a severe weathering environment since uplift and exposure of the rock at the Earth's surface in the Cenozoic. On the other hand, the high abundance of aromatic hydrocarbons in bitumen II suggests that bitumen II hydrocarbons have been physically isolated from removal by their encapsulation within carbonate minerals. The richness of aromatic hydrocarbons and the relative scarcity of aliphatic hydrocarbons may reflect the original compositions of organic materials biosynthesised in ancient organisms in the <b>Archean</b> <b>era,</b> or the high thermal maturity of the rock. Cyanobacterial biomarkers were observed in the surficial slices of the rock, which may indicate that endolithic cyanobacteria inhabited the surface outcrop. The distribution of aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbons implies a high thermal maturity, which is consistent with the lack of any specific biomarkers, such as hopanes and steranes, and the prehnite–pumpellyite facies metamorphic grade. 13 page(s...|$|E
40|$|The {{objects of}} this thesis were to use geochronology to {{investigate}} crustal evolution {{of part of}} Southern Africa that formed during a global event, resulting in the ~ 1 Ga supercontinent Rodinia. The timing of assembly by continent-continent collisions and {{the position of the}} individual continental blocks of this ancient landmass is still largely unknown. This research is a contribution to the investigation and understanding of Precambrian tectonism and the evolution of the continental crust. It also provides a basis for future ore and mineral exploration in the Namaqua Sector of the Namaqua-Natal Province. The Namaqua-Natal Province is draped along the western and southern flanks of the > 3 Ga Kaapvaal Craton, South Africa. It formed at 1200 - 1100 Ma, in relation to the birth of Rodinia. The Natal Sector of the province in the south-east is contiguous with the Namaqua Sector in the west, separated by Phanerozoic cover. The Natal Sector is mainly composed of ~ 1. 2 Ga juvenile crustal material. The Namaqua Sector is composed of six different terranes in which the metamorphic grade varies from greenschist facies to amphibolite and granulite facies. The major ore districts of the Namaqua Sector have been investigated, but the regional geochronology is poorly constrained and few regional studies have been done. We provide new geochronology, including Sm-Nd model ages of crustal extraction from the mantle, microbeam U-Pb zircon dating of sedimentary, magmatic and metamorphic events and Ar-Ar dating of minerals indicating the cooling histories of rocks, to investigate and compare the chronological and geochemical evolution of the entire Namaqua Sector. Sm-Nd model ages show that parts of the Namaqua crust were extracted from the mantle as early as the <b>Archean</b> <b>Era</b> (> 2. 5 Ga) in the Bushmanland Terrane, with major Paleoproterozoic (2. 5 - 1. 6 Ga) crustal growth in the Kaaien, Areachap, Kakamas (or eastern terranes), Bushmanland, Garies Terranes and Richtersveld Subprovince (or western terranes). Mesoproterozoic (1. 6 - 1. 1 Ga) juvenile additions to the crust took place in the Areachap, Kakamas and Garies Terranes. Several volcanic,magmatic and sedimentary events contributed to the building of crust, before, during and after the collisional orogeny at 1. 21 - 1. 16 Ga. Thickening of the crust led to voluminous grainitoid magmatism at this time, the extent of which strongly suggests a near complete reworking of the crust, accompanied by regional metamorphism in the eastern and parts of the western terranes. After a quiet period, a new pulse of magmatism took place at ~ 1. 1 Ga in the eastern terranes, and a second pulse of high temperature metamorphism at 1. 05 - 1. 01 Ga in the western terranes. From this time and onwards to ~ 965 Ma the crust in the Areachap, Kakamas, Bushmanland and Richtersveld cooled rapidly, likely related to crustal uplift. Hence, the Namaqua Sector {{has a long history of}} crustal extraction, in contrast with the essentially juvenile Natal sector. This work represents a regional documentation of the geochronology of the Namaqua Sector and is a significant contribution to the understanding of its complex geological evolution.
