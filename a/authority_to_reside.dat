5000|$|The Council also {{organized}} the Reichsrätekongress which {{met at the}} Preußisches Abgeordnetenhaus at Leipziger Platz in Berlin from 16 to 20 December 1918. By majority vote, this assembly decided to bring forward the elections to a national assembly to 19 January 1919 and refused a USPD proposal to assume supreme legislative and executive power. However, it also passed a resolution known as Hamburger Punkte that emphasized some key revolutionary demands that were anathema to the military: supreme military command {{to be with the}} Council of the People's Deputies, disciplinary <b>authority</b> <b>to</b> <b>reside</b> with the soldiers' councils, election of officers, no rank insignia and no observance of military rank off-duty.|$|E

5000|$|Bergoglio {{was asked}} in 1992 by Jesuit <b>authorities</b> not <b>to</b> <b>reside</b> in Jesuit houses, because of {{continued}} tensions with Jesuit leaders and scholars, {{a sense of}} Bergoglio's [...] "dissent", views of his Catholic orthodoxy and his opposition to theology of liberation, and his work as auxiliary bishop of Buenos Aires. From then on, he did not visit Jesuit houses and was in [...] "virtual estrangement from the Jesuits" [...] until after his election as Pope.|$|R
5000|$|The {{internal}} {{governance structure}} in Waukegan differed {{from that in}} Mount Carroll. Shortly after the move, the House {{was replaced by the}} more structured Assembly. The first Assembly Constitution, inspired in part by the writings of Jean-Jacques Rousseau, was adopted in 1980. [...] Under the Assembly system, most detailed work is performed by elected committees containing a mixture of students, faculty and staff. The Assembly itself governs by [...] "moral suasion" [...] only. [...] Legal <b>authority</b> continued <b>to</b> <b>reside</b> in the Board of Trustees and the president. Donald P. Moon, an Episcopalian pastor and former nuclear physicist, remained president of Shimer from 1979 through his retirement in 2004. He was succeeded by William Craig Rice, under whose administration the college moved to Chicago.|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} we employ three {{interpretations of the}} ZPD to frame an {{analysis}} of episodes {{of teaching and learning}} in a year 7 mathematics classroom. The analysis is concerned with the way authority is constituted locally by the teacher and students within the norms of Collective Argumentation. In traditional classrooms, <b>authority</b> is assumed <b>to</b> <b>reside</b> in the teacher and texts whereas in Collective Argumentation, authority is attained through discourse practices that privilege sodo-mathematical norms such as meaningfulness, communicability, and testability. We show how students in the classroom speak with unusual authority as they communicate and negotiate their claims...|$|R
5000|$|Continuing work on Leibniz, Groethuysen went to Paris in {{the fall}} of 1904 where he met André Gide and Jean Paulhan and {{encountered}} Charles du Bos, whom he had met in Berlin some time before. Returning each year to the French capital, he became a noteworthy [...] "messenger" [...] between German and French cultures. From 1912, he worked closely with Alix Guillain (1876-1951), a Belgian Communist activist. Both settled in Paris in a small artist's studio on rue Campagne-Première. In February 1915, after war broke out in France, he was interned in Châteauroux at Bitray, a camp reserved for foreign civilians and located in the premises of the insane asylum of the city. His friends Charles Du Bos, Charles Andler and Henri Bergson, petitioned to improve Groethuysen's conditions of detention, and finally persuaded the <b>authorities</b> <b>to</b> let him <b>reside</b> in private accommodations.|$|R
40|$|Since the closures, in 1971, of the Prudence Island and Brenton Reef {{disposal}} sites, water-related {{industries have}} not had aquatic disposal of dredged sediments as a management option. The marina industry in Rhode Island has been especially impacted as natural sedimentation processes have reduced the water depths at many of these locations and {{have resulted in the}} loss of business as operators have been unable to operate their marinas to their fullest potential. The elimination of this option is based on political and environmental concerns over declines in local commercial fisheries which are alleged {{to be the result of}} the aquatic disposal of dredged sediments from the Providence River Channel deepening project. Politically, the dredging and disposal issue is very complex as <b>authority</b> <b>to</b> permit dredging <b>resides</b> in several state and federal agencies.

50|$|In the 17th century, Portuguese Jews from Amsterdam and London {{were coming}} to Madras as {{settlers}} and traders.

40|$|Much of {{the study}} in German history since the {{appearance}} of the National Socialist Party has been that of a negative continuity that reached its pinnacle in Fascism capturing the state. It is a position which presumes a weak middle class that abdicated political rule for economic dominance, and it assumes that Bismarck, by perpetuating an authoritarian state under monarchical rule, in effect prepared the way for <b>authority</b> again coming <b>to</b> <b>reside</b> in one man on January 30, 1933. The focus of my thesis is to elucidate Bismarck's relation to the hidden side of German Unification [1847 - 1871] [...] the monied side [...] which was much more powerful than often portrayed, much more diffuse in its influence and much more appreciated, admired and understood by Otto von Bismarck who did not rule in defiance of it. Money, in the history of German Unification, has not lost its sordid almost occult characteristics, thus continuing to remain largely unexplored even today, by historians cautious to challenge the presupposition that Bismarck's greatness could ever have admitted more than a fleeting disdain for economics. While money, on the one hand, built railroads, factories and financed wars, on the other, it remained tainted, bringing shame with its power and promising only to buy one out of its curse but not provide legitimization on its own merit. A thesis of this nature intends to provide a fuller picture of a very profound individual...|$|R

5|$|The {{first two}} years of Garrard's second term were {{relatively}} uneventful, but in the 1802 General Assembly, legislators approved two bills related to the circuit court system that Garrard vetoed. The first bill expanded the number of courts and provided that untrained citizens could sit as judges in the court system. Garrard questioned the cost of the additional courts and the wisdom of allowing untrained judges on the bench; he also objected to the bill's circumvention of the governor's <b>authority</b> <b>to</b> appoint judges. The second bill allowed attorneys and judges in the circuit court system <b>to</b> <b>reside</b> outside the districts they served. The General Assembly overrode Garrard's second veto, marking the first time in Kentucky history that a gubernatorial veto was overridden and the only time during Garrard's eight-year tenure.|$|R
50|$|When the British {{settled at}} Sydney Cove in 1788 the colonial {{government}} in Australia claimed all lands for the Crown. Governors of New South Wales were given <b>authority</b> <b>to</b> make land grants to free settlers, emancipists (former convicts) and non-commissioned officers. When land grants were made {{they were often}} subject to conditions such as a quit rent (one shilling per 50 acre to be paid after five years) and a requirement for the grantee <b>to</b> <b>reside</b> on and cultivate the land. In line with the British government's policy of concentrated land settlement for the colony Governors of New South Wales tended to be prudent in making land grants. By the end of Governor Macquarie’s tenure in 1821 less than 1000 sq mi of land had been granted in the colony of New South Wales.|$|R
