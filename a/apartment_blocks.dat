5|$|Little is {{revealed}} of the Combine's role outside of Earth, but dialogue in Half-Life 2 states that they control worlds in different dimensions and inhabited by {{a range of}} species. The Combine occupation of Earth, however, is {{shown to be a}} brutal police state. In City 17, an Eastern European city, Civil Protection units are seen frequently, often conducting random searches of <b>apartment</b> <b>blocks,</b> interrogating human citizens and engaging in random police brutality. The military Overwatch forces of the Combine are shown attacking human resistance bases in an effort to further solidify their control. The citizens themselves are all clad in blue uniforms and live in designated <b>apartment</b> <b>blocks.</b> Citizens are shown to be moved around to different cities or locales at the Combine's will, using passenger trains. Vortigaunts, alien creatures from the original Half-Life, are also shown to have been enslaved, and are observed in various jobs such as janitors. According to , the Combine are draining the Earth's oceans, minerals and resources to be used on other Combine worlds; both the water levels along the coast of City 17 and later coastal levels are also greatly reduced.|$|E
5|$|The {{old town}} is bordered {{to the south}} by the railway and main station, beyond which there are {{commercial}} buildings and <b>apartment</b> <b>blocks.</b> The residential areas of Himmelev and Veddelev {{to the east and}} north of the city have grown up around former villages. More recently, with the establishment of Roskilde University even further to the east beyond the ring road, the district of Trekroner is in full development, expected to attain some 3,500 houses in the coming years.|$|E
5|$|Bridgwater Docks, {{in which}} the tidal basin, locks, quaysides, bridges and {{fittings}} are listed buildings, is now a marina, and the old warehouse, built in 184050 has been converted into apartments, with new <b>apartment</b> <b>blocks</b> built nearby. The only commercially active industry located at the docks is Bowering's Animal Feed Mill. The towpath forms part of Sustrans' National Cycle Network route NCR-3 connecting Bath and Cornwall, and attracts numerous travellers. Plans have been proposed for the upgrading of the towpath and development of a visitor centre at Maunsel.|$|E

5|$|In 1997, Wilders {{was elected}} for the People's Party for Freedom and Democracy (VVD) to the {{municipal}} council of Utrecht, {{the fourth largest}} city of the Netherlands. He lived in Kanaleneiland, a suburb with cheap social housing and high <b>apartment</b> <b>blocks,</b> which has a relatively high number of immigrants. While a city councilor, Wilders was mugged in his own neighbourhood; some have speculated that this may have catalysed his political transformation. He was not rewarded for his time on the municipal council of Utrecht, for in the following elections he would score well {{below the national average}} in the University city.|$|E
5|$|Sited {{adjacent}} to Housing and Development Board <b>apartment</b> <b>blocks</b> of the Marine Parade Housing Estate, the Marine Parade Community Building {{could be seen}} as an attempt to engage the wider community. The activities of the community building were planned to overlap and to coalesce, as a one-stop destination for the entire family. The rich congruence of the multiple programmes for the building is expressed architecturally as a collage of diverse elements. The building was designed by a local architectural firm, William Lim Associates, which adopted a postmodern pluralist approach, expressed through a multiplicity of materials and forms.|$|E
5|$|Summer Hill has {{a mix of}} Federation-era houses, with medium density <b>apartment</b> <b>blocks</b> {{near the}} railway station. Local {{independent}} business people run most of the shops. The local council has defined a village character for the suburb. Summer Hill is a suburb rich in heritage. More than one hundred properties are heritage listed, and the strong feelings of some residents of the suburb towards protecting the local architecture has seen {{the introduction of a}} heritage review, which is expected to add more properties to the heritage register.|$|E

5|$|After the Second World War, new {{government}} turned toward Soviet influence and the Stalinist monumentalism. The doctrine of Socialist realism in Poland, {{as in other}} countries of the People's Republics, was enforced from 1949 to 1956. It involved all domains of art, but its most spectacular achievements {{were made in the}} field of urban design. The guidelines for this new trend were spelled-out in a 1949 resolution of the National Council of Party Architects. Architecture was to become a weapon in establishing the new social order by the communists. The ideological impact of urban design was valued more than aesthetics. It aimed at expressing persistence and power. This form of architecture was implemented in the new industrial district of Nowa Huta with <b>apartment</b> <b>blocks</b> constructed according to a Stalinist blueprint, with repetitious courtyards and wide, tree-lined avenues.|$|E
5|$|China has {{installed}} a grassroots network of officials throughout Xinjiang, its predominantly Muslim north-west frontier region, to address social risks and spot {{early signs of}} unrest: Hundreds of cadres have been transferred from southern Xinjiang, the region’s poorest area, into socially unstable neighbourhoods of Ürümqi; a policy has been implemented where if all family members are unemployed, the government arranges for {{one person in the}} household to get a job,; official announcements are calling upon university students to register for those payouts. The areas around slums are being redeveloped to reduce social risks, opening way to new <b>apartment</b> <b>blocks.</b> However, independent observers believe that fundamental inequalities need to be addressed, and the mindset must change for there to be any success; Ilham Tohti warned that the new policy could attract more Han immigration, and further alienate the Uyghur population.|$|E
5|$|Since {{the style}} of the Renaissance was {{generally}} regarded as the most revered in old Polish architecture, it was also used for augmenting Poland's Socialist national format. However, in the course of incorporating the principles of Socialist realism, there were quite a few deviations introduced by the communists. One of these was to more closely reflect Soviet architecture, which resulted in the majority of works blending into one another. From 1953, critical opinions in the Party were increasingly frequent, and the doctrine was given up in 1956 marking the end of Stalinism. Currently the soc-realist centre of Nowa Huta {{is considered to be a}} meritorious monument of the times. This period in postwar architecture was followed by the mass-construction of large Panel System <b>apartment</b> <b>blocks,</b> most of which were built outside the city centre and thus do not encroach upon the beauty of the old or new towns. Some examples of the new style (e.g., Hotel Cracovia) recently listed as heritage monuments were built during the later half of the 20th century in Kraków.|$|E

5|$|Today, Sisimiut is {{the largest}} {{business}} center north of the national capital of Nuuk {{and is one of}} the fastest growing cities in Greenland. Fishing is the principal industry in Sisimiut, although the town has a growing industrial base. KNI and its subsidiary Pilersuisoq, a state-owned chain of all-purpose general stores in Greenland, have their base in Sisimiut. Architecturally, Sisimiut is a mix of traditional, single-family houses, and communal housing, with <b>apartment</b> <b>blocks</b> raised in the 1960s during a period of town expansion in Greenland. Sisimiut is still expanding, with the area north of the port, on the shore of the small Kangerluarsunnguaq Bay reserved for a modern suburb-style housing slated for construction in the 2010s. Several professional and general schools are based in Sisimiut, providing education to the inhabitants of the city and to those from smaller settlements in the region. The new Taseralik Culture Center is the second cultural center to be established in Greenland, after Katuaq in Nuuk.|$|E
5|$|Poole Quay is {{a visitor}} {{attraction}} {{to the south of}} the town centre lined with a mixture of traditional public houses, new bars, redeveloped warehouses, modern <b>apartment</b> <b>blocks</b> and historic listed buildings. Once the busy centre of Poole's maritime industry, all port activities moved to Hamworthy in the 1970s as the Quay became increasingly popular with tourists. The Grade II* listed Customs House on the quay-front was built in 1814 and now functions as a restaurant and bar. Nearby the Grade I listed Town Cellars, a medieval warehouse built in the 15th century on the foundations of a 14th-century stone building, houses a local history centre. Scaplen's Court, another Grade I listed building, also dates from the medieval era. Poole Pottery has been redeveloped into an apartment block. Boats regularly depart from the quay during the summer and provide cruises around the harbour and to Brownsea Island, the River Frome and Swanage. Public artworks along the Quay include Sea Music – a large metal sculpture designed by Sir Anthony Caro, and a life-size bronze sculpture of Robert Baden-Powell created to celebrate the founding of the Scout Movement on Brownsea Island. At the western end of the quay near the mouth of Holes Bay is Poole Bridge. Built in 1927, it is the third bridge to be located on the site since 1834.|$|E
