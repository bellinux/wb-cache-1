Yet none can be found in an industrial application. This is largely because we do not fully understand the fundamental mechanics of multi-finger grasping. This thesis is a study of the mechanics of multi-finger grasping, with particular attention being paid to applying the analysis to experimental co-operative motion tasks between a hand-arm system and grasped object. Fine manipulation with multi-fingered robot hands is critically influenced by the capacity to achieve stable grasps. By exploring the fundamental mechanics involved, a method for establishing the stability of spatial four finger-contact grasps is obtained. This work examines both frictionless and frictional grasps in two and three dimensions and develops the stability requirements for grasping. The conditions for a stable grasp are expressed as simple equations relating the line coordinates of (i) transitory sliding actuator and (ii) the normal to the tangent plane at every contact location. This is achieved by using the principle of virtual work and a branch of statics known as <b>astatics.</b> After specifying a grasp in terms of its contact locations and forces the object can be grasped. However, in general the configuration of the hand-arm combination will not be unique, as such a manipulator system has more than six degrees of freedom and is said to be super-abundant. The choice of appropriate shares taken by the arm and hand in delivering the manipulation task needs to be resolved. This can be done making use of a kinematic performance measure based on aligning the grip triangle with the hand line of symmetry and maximising the available manipulation range. The hand-arm combination can then be driven to this desired grasp enabling the manipulator to carry out the specified task effectively. A Salisbury hand and PUMA 760 robot arm are used to demonstrate these co-operative motion tasks. All the experimental results are presented along with a detailed description of the implementation of a hierarchical robot controller system which incorporates force control of the PUMA 760.

50|$|The British {{physicist}} P.M.S. Blackett {{provided a}} major impetus to paleomagnetism by inventing a sensitive <b>astatic</b> magnetometer in 1956. His {{intent was to}} test his theory that the geomagnetic field {{was related to the}} Earth's rotation, a theory that he ultimately rejected; but the <b>astatic</b> magnetometer became the basic tool of paleomagnetism and led to a revival of the theory of continental drift. Alfred Wegener first proposed in 1915 that continents had once been joined together and had since moved apart. Although he produced an abundance of circumstantial evidence, his theory met with little acceptance for two reasons: (1) no mechanism for continental drift was known, and (2) {{there was no way to}} reconstruct the movements of the continents over time.Keith Runcorn and Edward A. Irving constructed apparent polar wander paths for Europe and North America. These curves diverged, but could be reconciled if it was assumed that the continents had been in contact up to 200 million years ago. This provided the first clear geophysical evidence for continental drift. Then in 1963, Morley, Vine and Matthews showed that marine magnetic anomalies provided evidence for seafloor spreading.|$|E

50|$|Kohlrausch {{was intent}} on {{creating}} optimum working conditions in the laboratories and to shield the labs from unwanted external influences. For six years, for instance, he fought against a streetcar line which was due to be laid near the PTR. However, before the streetcar was to make its first journey, the institute succeeded in developing an <b>astatic</b> torsion magnetometer which was uninfluenced by disturbing electromagnetic fields. The use of this instrument and the shielded wire galvanometer developed by du Bois and Rubens meant that precision electrical and magnetic work continued to be possible.|$|E
50|$|Unlike the tangent {{galvanometer}}, the <b>astatic</b> galvanometer {{does not}} use the Earth's magnetic field for measurement, so it {{does not need to}} be oriented with respect to the Earth's field, making it easier to use. It has two magnetized needles parallel to each other, but with the magnetic poles reversed. suspended by a silk thread. The lower needle is inside a vertical current sensing coil of wire and is deflected by the magnetic field created by the passing current, as in the tangent galvanometer above. The purpose of the second needle is to cancel the dipole moment of the first needle, so the suspended armature has no net magnetic dipole moment, and thus is not affected by the earth's magnetic field. The needle's rotation is opposed by the torsional elasticity of the suspension thread, which is proportional to the angle.|$|E

In this system has been installed additional feedback, which transforms <b>astatic</b> objects to stable in the open loop. System work investigation has been accomplished in simulation way (MATLAB/Simulink environment) by comparing control system with additional feedback and typical one feedback automatic control system.

Control systems working quality indicators were evaluated by modeling system response to the hopping setpoint and disturbance changes.

Among the properties of water analysed water depth, SO 42 -, pH, total and carbonate hardness, PO 43 −, Ca 2 +, Mg 2 + and Na+ were found to be most important in differentiating the habitats of the vegetation types studied. Substrate properties, which best differentiated the habitats of the associations studied were NO 3 −, Na+, water content, pH and total N. In spite of the wide variability of habitat conditions occurring in <b>astatic</b> water bodies, particular phytocoenoses distinguished on the basis of dominance of one species were associated with specific habitats.
