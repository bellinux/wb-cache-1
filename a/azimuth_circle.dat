His demonstration in 1806 of a change of form in the Greenwich mural quadrant led {{to the introduction of}} astronomical circles at the Royal Greenwich Observatory and to his own appointment as its head.

5000|$|During {{his visit}} of Edinburgh in 1822, George IV {{bestowed}} upon the observatory {{the title of}} [...] "Royal Observatory of King George the Fourth". In 1834 - with Government funding - the instrumentation of the observatory was completed. This cleared the way to uniting the observatory with the Regius Chair, and Thomas Henderson was appointed the first Astronomer Royal for Scotland and second Regius Professor of Astronomy. The main instruments of the new observatory were a 6.4-inch (16 cm) transit telescope and a 3.5-inch (9 cm) <b>azimuth</b> <b>circle.</b>|$|E

At sea, navigators use azimuth or bearing to describe the direction and altitude to describe the height of the sun or a star, lighthouse, or buoy used as a point of reference. In this activity students use a compass and their hands to find positions of stars and planets in the night sky or of the sun during the day.

50|$|It was the {{set forward}} {{point that the}} guns were {{targeted}} to hit. This was accomplished by bringing the gun arm of the plotting board over this point, and reading the range from the directing point to the target off the range scale {{on the edge of}} that arm and the azimuth from the directing point to the target off of <b>azimuth</b> <b>circle</b> of the gun arm center. To see how this and further steps in the fire control process were accomplished, our attention shifts to the mechanisms of the gun arm center, shown in Plate XXVI at the right.|$|E
5000|$|A {{discussion}} of equatorial instruments published in 1793 said that Sisson was {{the inventor of}} the modern version of that instrument, which had been incorrectly attributed to Mr Short. Sisson made his first equatorial instrument of this design for Archibald, Lord Ilay, and it was now held by the college at Aberdeen. The instrument was [...] "very elegantly constructed", with an <b>azimuth</b> <b>circle</b> about 2 ft across. Mr Short ordered Sisson's son Jeremiah to add reflecting telescopes to the instruments and to use endless screws to move the circles,but this design proved inferior to Jonathon Sisson's original.|$|E
5000|$|A {{gyroscope}} {{is mounted}} in a sphere, lined with Mu-metal to reduce magnetic influence, {{connected by a}} spindle to the vertical axis of the theodolite. The battery-powered gyro wheel is rotated at 20,000 rpm or more, until it acts as a north-seeking gyroscope. [...] A separate optical system within the attachment permits the operator to rotate the theodolite and thereby bring a zero mark on the attachment into coincidence with the gyroscope spin axis. By tracking the spin axis as it oscillates about the meridian, {{a record of the}} azimuth of a series of the extreme stationary points of that oscillation may be determined by reading the theodolite <b>azimuth</b> <b>circle.</b> A midpoint can later be computed from these records that represents a refined estimate of the meridian. Careful setup and repeated observations can give an estimate that is within about 10 arc seconds of the true meridian. [...] This estimate of the meridian contains errors due to the zero torque of the suspension not being aligned precisely with the true meridian and to measurement errors of the slightly damped extremes of oscillation. These errors can be moderated by refining the initial estimate of the meridian to within a few arc minutes and correctly aligning the zero torque of the suspension.|$|E
50|$|Burt {{claimed in}} his patent was {{he took the}} common sextant and {{combined}} it with his special mechanical techniques of horizontal and equatorial movement settings to obtain latitude, time, azimuth, altitude and declination without having {{to figure it out}} mathematically as they were read directly off the instrument. Many problems in nautical astronomy are solved at once {{with the use of the}} Equatorial Sextant. It has the capability of reading off the latitude, hour angle, and azimuth without computation thereby eliminating mathematical errors. It can do these readings any time of the day. It is a combination of the reflecting sextant with meridian, <b>azimuth,</b> and hour <b>circles.</b> It is designed to give immediately the azimuth and hour angle by observation of the altitudes of the heavenly bodies. The corresponding angles are read off on the respective circles, thereby giving the position of a ship at sea at once with the use of a marine chronometer.|$|R
40|$|A seismic {{array of}} ten short period seismometers {{has been set}} up at Kaptagat, 10 km west of the Elgeyo {{escarpment}} in Kenya, by the Durham University Geology Department. This study concerns the analysis of teleseismic arrivals. The method of onset time analysis is used to calculate values of dT/dΔ and azimuth of approach for 34 events from epi central distances of 18 - 99 º. Large systematic variations in slowness and azimuth are observed {{as a function of the}} great <b>circle</b> <b>azimuth</b> to the epicentre. These are similar to those found at other arrays but are of unusually high amplitude. Prom consideration of onset time residuals and the velocities of regional earthquake arrivals at Kaptagat it appears that these effects are not caused by variations in near-surface structure or by errors in the array geometry. An explanation is developed in terms of sharply dipping interfaces beneath the array, and the preferred model is of a mantle low velocity zone with sloping boundaries underneath the Gregory Rift. This anomalous zone attenuates rapidly westward to sink below mantle material typical of the stable areas of Africa. P-wave delay times are measured relative to Bulawayo for 78 events in the distance range 24 - 99 º. Substantial values confirm the presence of a considerable low velocity body beneath the array and the absence of large variations with azimuth implies ultra-low velocities with relatively moderate dips on the zone boundaries. A reinterpretation of Rayleigh wave phase and group velocities for the AAE-NAI path is made and found to be compatible with the top of the low velocity mantle material sinking eastward from the Gregory Rift underneath normal shield-type topmost mantle. Although the model derived is probably not continuous throughout the East African rift system, the upper mantle structure beneath the Gregory Rift is similar to that suggested to exist below oceanic ridges...|$|R
40|$|An {{algorithm}} for {{the automatic}} detection and association of surface waves {{has been developed}} and tested over an 18 month interval on broad band data from the Yellowknife array (YKA). The detection algorithm uses a conventional STA/LTA scheme on data that have been narrow band filtered at 20 s periods and a test is then applied to identify dispersion. An average of 9 surface waves are detected daily using this technique. Beamforming is applied to determine the arrival azimuth; at a nonarray station this {{could be provided by}} poIarization analysis. The detected surface waves are associated daily with the events located by the short period array at Yellowknife, and later with the events listed in the USGS NEIC Monthly Summaries. Association requires matching both arrival time and azimuth of the Rayleigh waves. Regional calibration of group velocity and azimuth is required.. Large variations in both group velocity and azimuth corrections were found, as an example, signals from events in Fiji Tonga arrive with apparent group velocities of 2. 9 3. 5 krn/s and azimuths from 5 to + 40 degrees clockwise from true (great <b>circle)</b> <b>azimuth,</b> whereas signals from Kuriles Kamchatka have velocities of 2. 4 2. 9 km/s and azimuths off by 35 to 0 degrees. After applying the regional corrections, surface waves are considered associated if the arrival time matches to within 0. 25 km/s in apparent group velocity and the azimuth is within 30 degrees of the median expected. Over the 18 month period studied, 32 % of the automatically detected surface waves were associated with events located by the Yellowknife short period array, and 34 % (1591) with NEIC events; there is about 70 % overlap between the two sets of events. Had the automatic detections been reported to the USGS, YKA would have ranked second (after LZH) in terms of numbers of associated surface waves for the study period of April 1991 to September 1992...|$|R
