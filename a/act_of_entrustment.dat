40|$|The {{expression}} of Public Service Obligations (PSO) {{in the network}} sectors of SGEIs are defined by the normative values of a good administrative protocol with sectoral rules set out in EU legislation. The Europeanisation of these sectors provides a coherent base which informs the national approaches in providing for <b>acts</b> <b>of</b> <b>entrustment</b> {{and the establishment of}} independent national regulatory agencies. This paper examines the development of this model and provides a comparison with the approach taken in economic social services sectors where Member States face a developing imperative to designate essential SSGI as SGEI. This is a social services environment in which a growing Public Service Industry is increasingly seeing private sector economic actors enjoy a general advantage over third sector not-for-profit and charity entities, in the public procurement processes. The comparison highlights the significant differences in the way that PSOs are expressed between the network SGEIs and the ‘social’ SGEIs and raises a question of whether it is time to consider, in at least some social services sectors, whether the {{expression of}} PSOs should be re-modelled {{in such a way as}} to replicate those in the network SGEI sectors...|$|R

5000|$|The European Commission {{has stated}} [...] that an [...] "act of entrustment" [...] is {{necessary}} in order to set out the public service obligations of the undertaking and must have been committed to the organisation through an official act having legal force under the national law of the relevant EU member state. There need not be any specific legal framework covering acts of entrustment, but the act must extend sufficiently to create an obligation or accountability: permission, such as legal recognition or regulatory approval would not be sufficient. The obligation may be set out in legislation, the terms of a contract or in certain cases in a grant agreement. The <b>act</b> <b>of</b> <b>entrustment</b> should, in particular, state the nature, territorial scope and duration of the public service obligations, the organisation concerned, and the nature of any exclusive or special rights which the organisation may be able to exercise, along with the mechanism for calculating the level of compensation.|$|E

40|$|PhDThis study {{focuses on}} the {{particular}} course taken by the theory of sexual difference (il pensiero della differenza sessuale) in Italy.

The {{first part of the}} thesis situates Italian feminism in relation to the more familiar French and Anglo-American contexts in order to consider its distinctiveness. The main body of the study then considers the historical and political emergence of contemporary Italian feminism, the elaboration of a social-symbolic practice called "entrustment" ("affidamento"), beginning in 1983, and the hegemony achieved by the theory of sexual difference amongst the majority of feminist groups. Here, I develop the central argument of the thesis: it is the elaboration <b>of</b> <b>entrustment</b> which has first occasioned contemporary Italian feminism, as a whole, to engage with a theory of sexual difference adapted to the highly politicised Italian context.

40|$|As residents, we {{constantly}} {{strive to}} independently manage our patients and develop care plans, while {{the role of}} the attending faculty varies between complete supervision and control, to allowing complete autonomy. This concept of attending physicians allowing appropriate autonomy so that residents can develop independence in their practice has been termed entrustment.

Over the past several months, we have been reflecting on our experiences working in the emergency department and how different faculty members entrust residents during each shift.

As third‐year residents, we studied the factors that allow faculty to foster an appropriate amount <b>of</b> <b>entrustment</b> and conducted discussions with multiple residents on this topic.

40|$|Development {{policy and}} {{practice}} in fragile and conflict-affected areas needs to be rethought. A growing proportion of aid budgets is going to fragile and conflict-affected states and conflict prevention is becoming an important focus of aid spend even in countries that are not affected by widespread violence.

While development in violent environments is very different from development in stable and peaceful areas, {{the same is true for}} security. One of the key differences is the fragmentation of power and authority which makes it more difficult for outsiders to operate.

The concept of ‘broad consent’ has been proposed as a mechanism to enable potential research participants in biobanks to give permission for their samples to be used in future research studies. However, questions remain about the acceptability of this model of consent. Drawing on findings from empirical research about the role of trust in decision-making, we argue that an account <b>of</b> <b>entrustment</b> may be an appropriate way of addressing current challenges of seeking consent for biobank research in Africa.

40|$|An {{enduring}} {{challenge for}} administrative law is {{the tension between the}} ideal of democratic policymaking and the ubiquity of bureaucratic discretion. This Article seeks to reframe the problem of agency discretion by outlining an interpretivist model of administrative law based on the concept of fiduciary obligation in private legal relations such as agency, trust, and corporation. Administrative law, like private fiduciary law, increasingly relies upon a tripartite framework <b>of</b> <b>entrustment,</b> residual control, and fiduciary duty to demarcate a domain of bounded agency discretion. To minimize the risk that agencies will abuse their entrusted discretion through opportunism or carelessness, administrative law empowers the political branches to exert limited residual control over agencies and subjects agencies to nonderogable duties of care and loyalty. As an interpretivist theory, this fiduciary model helps to explain controversial features of administrative law such as the contemporary nondelegation doctrine, Chevron deference, and the limits of presidential control over agency action. By clarifying administrative law 2 ̆ 7 s internal dynamics and implicit ambitions, the fiduciary model also provides a blueprint for reform in critical areas such as the standing doctrine and the due process restraints on agency discretion...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: Introduction. Medical {{schools in}} the United States are {{encouraged}} to prepare and certify the <b>entrustment</b> <b>of</b> medical students to perform 13 core entrustable professional activities (EPAs) prior to graduation. Entrustment {{is defined as the}} informed belief that the learner is qualified to autonomously perform specific patient care activities. Core EPA- 10 is the <b>entrustment</b> <b>of</b> a graduate to care for the emergent patient. The purpose of this project was to design a realistic performance assessment method for evaluating fourth-year medical students on EPA- 10. Methods. First, we wrote five emergent patient case-scenarios that a medical trainee would likely confront in an acute care setting. Furthermore, we developed high-fidelity simulations to realistically portray these patient case-scenarios. Finally, we designed a performance assessment instrument to evaluate the medical student’s performance on executing critical actions related to EPA- 10 competencies. Critical actions included: triage skills, mustering the medical team, identifying causes of patient decompensation, and initiating care. Up to four students were involved with each case-scenario, however only the team leader was evaluated using the assessment instruments developed for each case. Results. One hundred fourteen students participated in the EPA- 10 assessment during their final year of medical school. Most students demonstrated competence in recognizing unstable vital signs (97 %), engaging the team (93 %), and making appropriate dispositions (92 %). Almost 87 % of the students were rated as having reached entrustment to manage the care of an emergent patient (99 of 114). Inter-rater reliability varied by case-scenario, ranging from moderate to near perfect agreement. Three of five case-scenario assessment instruments contained items that were internally consistent at measuring student performance. Additionally, the individual item scores for these case scenarios were highly correlated with the global entrustment decision. Conclusions. High fidelity simulation showed good potential for effective assessment <b>of</b> medical student <b>entrustment</b> <b>of</b> caring for the emergent patient. Preliminary evidence from this pilot project suggests content validity of most cases and associated checklist items. The assessments also demonstrated moderately strong faculty inter-rater reliability...|$|R
