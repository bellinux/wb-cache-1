It has been included as a subspecies of the similar buff-necked ibis, but today all major authorities accept the split. The black-faced ibis also included the <b>Andean</b> <b>ibis</b> (T. branickii) as a subspecies. Some taxonomic authorities (including the American Ornithological Society) still do so.|$|E

50|$|The {{buff-necked ibis}} {{lives in a}} wide range of open habitats, {{including}} fields, marshes, savanna and grassland. There are two primary populations; the nominate subspecies is found across northern and central South America in Colombia, Venezuela, the Guianas and Brazil, while the very similar subspecies hyperorius is found in south-central South America in southern Brazil, eastern and northern Bolivia, Paraguay, southern Chile, Uruguay, and northern Argentina. It is almost entirely restricted to tropical and warmer subtropical lowlands, but very locally it extends into highlands (though never as high as the <b>Andean</b> <b>ibis).</b> It is almost entirely resident, although local movements may occur. It has been recorded as an accidental visitor in Panama.|$|E
