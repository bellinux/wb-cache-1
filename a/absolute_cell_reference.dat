40|$|AUTHORS’ REPLY We {{would like}} to thank Dr Hart for his useful comment. We agree that it is {{important}} that the <b>absolute</b> numbers of <b>cells</b> are presented when measuring differential cell count in a biological sample. In fact, fig 1 of our paper illustrated the reduction of sputum neutrophils as <b>absolute</b> <b>cell</b> numbers. We thank Dr Hart for the table where the data have been presented as mean <b>absolute</b> <b>cell</b> counts, showing no difference in the absolute number of macrophages after treatment and confirming that the increase in the proportion of sputum macrophages following treatment is attributable to the reduced number of sputum neutrophils.

We show that scatter characteristics, immunophenotyping and <b>absolute</b> <b>cell</b> counting are well preserved, particularly in the lymphocyte population. Nevertheless, a general increase in membrane permeability, evaluated by propidium iodide (PI) uptake, was observed in TransFixR-treated leukocyte subsets. Ultrastructural observations show selective morphological preservation (up to 10 days of storage) of lymphocytes and, to a lesser extent, of monocytes. In contrast, granulocytes have necrosis-like features, although the plasma membrane seems well preserved. Therefore, electron microscopy observations reflect modifications induced in different cell populations as evidenced by flow cytometry (FC). The data indicate that this short-term stabilisation method is particularly suitable for the analysis of human lymphocytes and it is a good procedure for quality control programmes for inter- and intra-laboratory performance evaluation; good results are obtained with respect to antigen definition and <b>absolute</b> <b>cell</b> counting procedures.

40|$|We {{evaluated}} {{a method}} for performing <b>absolute</b> <b>cell</b> counts of lymphocyte populations with a flow cytometer. In this method, TruCount, test tubes that contain a known number of brightly fluorescent polystyrene beads are provided by the manufacturer. Whole anticoagulated blood is accurately pipetted into the tubes and mixed with fluorochrome-labeled monoclonal antibodies, the erythrocytes are lysed, and this mixture is analyzed on the flow cytometer. Absolute counts of lymphocyte subsets are calculated by determining the ratio of beads to the cell population of interest and then multiplying this ratio {{by the number of}} beads in the tube. We found this method to be reproducible. The values we obtained by the TruCount method were 5 to 10 % higher than those obtained by conventional methods (flow cytometry and automated hematology) used to determine <b>absolute</b> numbers of <b>cells.</b> We believe that these differences are due to the methods of determining <b>absolute</b> <b>cell</b> counts and not to faulty identification of lymphocyte subsets...|$|R
40|$|The {{enumeration}} of <b>absolute</b> {{levels of}} <b>cells</b> and their subsets in clinical samples is of primary importance in {{human immunodeficiency virus}} (HIV) + individuals (CD 4 + T- lymphocyte enumeration), in patients who are candidates for autotransplantation (CD 34 + hematopoietic progenitor cells), and in evaluating leukoreduced blood products (residual white blood cells). These measurements share a number of technical options, namely, single- or multiple-color cell staining and logical gating strategies. These can be accomplished using single- or dual-platform counting technologies employing cytometric methods, Dual-platform counting technologies couple the percentage of positive cell subsets obtained by cytometry and the <b>absolute</b> <b>cell</b> count obtained by automated hematology analyzers to derive the absolute value of such subsets. Despite having many conceptual and technical limitations, this approach is traditionally considered as the <b>reference</b> method for <b>absolute</b> <b>cell</b> count enumeration. As a result, the development of single-platform technologies has recently attracted attention with several different technical approaches now being readily available. These single-platform approaches have less sources of variability. A number of reports clearly demonstrate that they provide better coefficients of variation (CVs) in multicenter studies and a lower chance to generate aberrant results. These methods are therefore candidates for the new gold standard for <b>absolute</b> <b>cell</b> assessments. The currently available technical options are discussed in this review together {{with the results of}} some cross-comparative studies, Each analytical system has its own specific requirements as far as the dispensing precision steps are concerned.
