Because of this, it has an important use in determining organic mercury compounds in samples and their distribution in the environment. The method initiates by converting mercury into Hg2+ by oxidation from nitric and sulfuric acids, followed by a reduction of Hg2+ with tin(II) chloride. The mercury, is then swept into a long-pass <b>absorption</b> <b>tube</b> by bubbling a stream of inert gas through the reaction mixture. The concentration is determined by measuring the absorbance of this gas at 253.7 nm. Detection limits for this technique are in the parts-per-billion range making it an excellent mercury detection atomization method.|$|E

40|$|A {{critical}} {{study of}} three methods for {{the determination of}} lactic acid (EDWARDS, MENDEL & GOLDSCHEIDER, MILLER & MUNTZ) is presented and some modifications are proposed. It was shown t hat more accurate results could be obtained with Edward's technic when an Iena glass filter is connected with the <b>absorption</b> <b>tube.</b> Before the dropping of the permanganate solution {{it is necessary to}} pass a current of air through the reaction flask to avoid the oxidation of the non-lactic acid substances which interfere with the reaction. The <b>absorption</b> <b>tube</b> must be maintained at 18 °C during the destillation and the titration of the bisulphite binding aldehyde at 4 °C. When the sample contains more than 5 mg it is useful to work with greater quantities of the bisulphite. More permanganate is consumed when the lactic acid concentration is higher. The sensivity of the method permits the titration of 0. 04 mg to 5 mg of lactic acid in the sample. The calculated error of the method gave 0. 018 % and the normal values for blood determined in 20 human cases averaged 10. 30 mg per 100 ml (Table VI). MENDEL and GOLDSCHEIDER'S method was modified in the following details: Somogyis deproteinization was performed instead metaphosphoric acid as in the original method; to avoid the evaporation of the acetic aldehyde during the heating time with sulfuric acid a special glass stopped tube is proposed (Fig. 2). The reaction with sulfuric acid and veratrol is performed in an ice bath. Blood proteins precipitants were tried and Somogyi's lattest tecnic showed better results (Table V). Colorimetric readings were done in the PULFRICH photometer using filter S 53 and a 10 mm cup. The method is accurate within an error of 0. 23 % and samples of 5 to 70 microg. could be easily determined. Normal values for human blood averaged 10. 78 mg per 100 ml. More accurate results were obtained with the technic of MILLER & MUNTZ. Slight modifications were introduced: deproteinization with copper sulfate and sodium tungstate; satured p-hydroxydiphenyl solution according to KOENEMANN which is stable for 5 months when stored in the ice-box. Using the PULFRICH step-photometer the error is 0. 17 % with samples varying from 0. 1 to 10 microg. of lactic acid. The filter employed was S 57 with the 5 mm cup.

40|$|The paper {{suggests}} {{the introduction of}} patterns {{to the surface of}} conventional thin-walled square tubes to improve the energy absorption capacity under axial compressive loads. A quasi-static axial crushing analysis has been conducted numerically by the nonlinear explicit finite element code LS-DYNA. Two types of patterns constructed using the basic pyramid elements were introduced. Type A pattern was aimed at triggering the extensional mode for relatively thin square tubes whereas type B pattern was intended to develop new collapse mode capable of absorbing more energy during collapse. A total of 30 tubes with a length of 120 mm, thickness 1. 2 mm and widths of 40 or 60 mm were simulated. Numerical results showed that all tubes with type A patterns developed the extensional collapse mode instead of the symmetric collapse mode and absorbed about 15 - 32. 5 % more energy than conventional thin-walled square tubes with a mass increase less than 5 %. Meanwhile, a new collapse mode named octagonal collapse mode was observed for tubes with type B pattern and the energy <b>absorption</b> of <b>tubes</b> developing this mode increased by 54 - 93 % compared with the conventional tube.

40|$|In the {{introduction}} to this thesis it is explained {{that there are two}} spectroscopic methods of obtaining information about the highly excited electronic energy levels of molecules. The first is by examining directly the transitions to these levels from the ground state of the molecule, the second by discovering transitions between the high levels themselves. In the molecule CO, given as an example, only one transition involving the ground state lies at wave-lengths greater than 2000 Å, end much information has been obtained at shorter wavelengths. However, for CO the second method has proved more fruitful, for many transitions of this molecule may be observed in the visible and near u-v regions of the spectrum. In this property CO is unusual, partly because it is a stable gaseous species of which a plentiful supply may be provided for a discharge tube, and partly because of the peculiar stability of its upper states and its high dissociation energy. On the other hand the majority of diatomic molecules do not possess so many emission systems above 200 Å and for these it was desired to find a general method for examining them at shorter wave-lengths. It is known that oxygen in the air absorbs light in this region, and so a vacuum spectrograph was designed and built around aim. glass grating ruled 30, 000 lines/inch. In order that the identification of the observed spectra should be as simple as possible, it was desired to obtain absorption spectra rather than emission ones. Previous work in this direction has been confined largely to gaseous or volatile substances, but for, general method a long <b>absorption</b> <b>tube</b> surrounded by a furnace is necessary, so that involatile solids may be heated. Now the most feasible source of continuous radiation from 2000 - 400 Å is the Lyman source, a powerful condensed spark through a silica capillary. This is almost a point source and so the intensity falls off very rapidly as it is moved away from the slit; thus {{the introduction}} of a long <b>absorption</b> <b>tube</b> requires a very bright source end a very fast spectrograph. The intensity in this work hps been increased by the use of an aluminized mirror collecting light from the source and focussing it on the slit. In this manner the absorption spectrum of five diatomic molecules has been examined between 1300 - 2000 Å, and some measure of the generality of the method is that in every case at least two new energy levels have been observed. In Part I of the thesis, after details of the design and operation of the spectrograph have been given, the observed spectra are recorded for the monoxides of silicon, germanium and tin, and also for stannous sulphide.

There was no significant relationship between the urine mercury of dentists (3. 107 ± 3. 95) and the air Hg vapor concentration of their offices. Using precapsulated amalgam showed significantly less Hg vapor than bulk amalgam (P= 0. 034). Also the surface area of working room and air Hg vapor (P= 0. 009) had a significant relationship (P= 0. 009 r= 0. 81). There was not any significant correlation between mercury vapor and other factors such as working hours per day and working days per week, squeezing of triturated amalgam or not, storage medium of set amalgam (water or fixer solution), mercury storage method and type of ventilation. Conclusion: The concentration of mercury vapor in dental offices' environment was lower than threshold limit value. Based on this study the type of amalgam (precapsulated or not) and area of the working room had significant effect on the mercury vapor concentration of environment...|$|R

Three different structures: empty, conventional and auxetic foam-filled square tubes have been compared and examined {{with respect to}} the deformation modes and load–displacement curves. Standard compression tests were conducted on the tubes to evaluate the influence of auxetic foam in the energy <b>absorption</b> of empty <b>tubes.</b> Moreover, results from computer simulation have also been supplemented to further examine the abovementioned effect. It is discovered that the auxetic foam-filled square tube is superior to empty and conventional foam-filled square tubes in terms of all studied crashworthiness indicators...|$|R
40|$|The {{experimental}} and numerical quasi-static crushing behaviors of Nomex TM honeycomb-filled thin-walled Al tubes were investigated. The honeycomb filler was modeled using a unit cell model. The numerical model and experimental results have shown that, 6. 4 mm and 4. 8 mm cell size honeycomb filling {{had no effect}} on the deformation mode (diamond); however 3. 2 mm cell size honeycomb filling changed the deformation mode to mixed/concertina. Honeycomb filling was also shown to increase the specific energy <b>absorption</b> of filled <b>tubes</b> over that of Al tube. The specific energy absorption of honeycomb filling was further compared with those of tube wall thickening and Al closed cell foam filling. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Impact {{is one of}} very {{important}} subjects which always have been considered in mechanical science. Nature of impact is such that which makes its control a hard task. Therefore it is required to present the transfer of impact to other vulnerable part of a structure, when it is necessary, {{one of the best}} method of absorbing energy of impact, is by using Thin-walled tubes these tubes collapses under impact and with absorption of energy, it prevents the damage to other parts. Purpose of recent study is to survey the deformation and energy <b>absorption</b> of <b>tubes</b> with different type of cross section (rectangular or square) and with similar volumes, height, mean cross section thickness, and material under loading with different speeds. Lateral loading of tubes are quasi-static type and beside as numerical analysis, also experimental experiences has been performed to evaluate the accuracy of the results. Results from the surveys is indicates that in a same conditions which mentioned above, samples with square cross section,absorb more energy compare to rectangular cross section, and also by increscent in speed of loading, energy absorption would be more.

40|$|The energy {{absorption}} in a foam-filled thin-walled circular Al tube was investigated {{based on the}} experimentally determined strengthening coefficient of filling using Al and polystyrene closed-cell foams with three different densities. Foam filling was found to change the deformation mode of tube from diamond (empty tube) into concertina, regardless the foam type and density used. Although foam filling resulted in higher {{energy absorption}} {{than the sum of}} the energy <b>absorptions</b> of the <b>tube</b> alone and foam alone, it was not effective in increasing the specific energy than simply thickening the tube wall. It was shown that for efficient foam filling an appropriate foam-tube combination must be selected by taking into account the magnitude of strengthening coefficient of foam filling and the foam filler plateau load.

40|$|Abstract: Thin-walled {{tubes are}} widely used as energy {{absorbers}} in various vehicles and moving parts. The objective {{of this study is}} to investigate the energy <b>absorption</b> characteristics of <b>tubes</b> with corrugations in different geometries, under lateral loading. In order to produce corrugations, an innovative solution is introduced. Quasi-static tests were conducted to study the effect of changing the corrugation geometry (type and amplitude). The results show that tubes with cor-rugations have a higher mean crushing force which is directly proportional to the number of corrugations and their amplitudes. Moreover, it was observed that corrugated tubes can absorb approximately four times more energy than the tubes without corrugations in the same sizes and weights. Finally, it was found that corrugated tubes are more effective in lateral direction as energy absorbers, as they present suitable force–deflection responses...|$|R
