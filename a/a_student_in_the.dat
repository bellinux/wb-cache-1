5|$|Born in Salem, Massachusetts to two unwed first cousins, Jones Very became {{associated}} with Harvard University, first as an undergraduate, then as <b>a</b> <b>student</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Harvard Divinity School {{and as a}} tutor of Greek. He heavily studied epic poetry and was invited to lecture on the topic in his home town, which drew the attention of Ralph Waldo Emerson. Soon after, Very asserted {{that he was the}} Second Coming of Christ, which resulted in his dismissal from Harvard and his eventual institutionalization in an insane asylum. When he was released, Emerson helped him issue a collection called Essays and Poems in 1839. Very lived the majority of his life as a recluse from then on, issuing poetry only sparingly. He died in 1880.|$|E
5|$|In 1976, Shulgin was {{introduced}} to MDMA by <b>a</b> <b>student</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> medicinal chemistry group he advised at San Francisco State University. MDMA had been synthesized in 1912 by Merck and patented in 1912 as an intermediate of another synthesis in order to block competitors, but was never explored in its own right. Shulgin went on {{to develop a new}} synthesis method, and in 1976, introduced the chemical to Leo Zeff, a psychologist from Oakland, California. Zeff used the substance in his practice in small doses as an aid to talk therapy. Zeff introduced the substance to hundreds of psychologists and lay therapists around the nation, including Ann (born Laura Ann Gotlieb), whom Alexander Shulgin met in 1979, and married in 1981. It was her fourth marriage, and she had had four children.|$|E

He {{was good enough to}} be {{selected}} as an instructor and took his first pupil after having flown only nine hours of solo flight himself. Two of his pupils included the future ace and 56 Squadron colleague Geoffrey Hilton Bowman and Mick Mannock. Soon afterwards, while teaching <b>a</b> <b>student</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Airco DH.1 in which they were flying, the aircraft entered a dangerous spin. McCudden narrowly avoided a crash, pulling up feet above the ground. An impact would certainly have killed them both.|$|E

5|$|Potocki was an alumnus of the Collegium Nobilium in Warsaw, {{where he}} was <b>a</b> <b>student</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> years 1761–1765. From 1765 he studied {{theology}} and law in Rome, where he attended the Collegium Nazarenum, up to about 1769. His parents intended for him to {{join the ranks of}} clergy, but he refused to follow this path. After traveling through Italy and Germany, he returned to Poland around 1771. On 27 December 1772 he married Elżbieta Lubomirska. This marriage brought him close to the political faction of Familia. Early on, Potocki made a major impression on many of his contemporaries, being groomed as the next leader of Familia. From 1772 he was invited to the King Stanisław II Augustus' Thursday Dinners.|$|E
5|$|The boys' {{basketball}} team was {{dominant in the}} 1980s. Coached by Tony Queen, the team won eight of ten Minneapolis City Conference championships {{and went to the}} state tournament eight times, winning in 1980 and placing second in 1984 and 1985. In 1988 Queen was suspended from coaching for one year following attempts to recruit basketball players, which is illegal under Minnesota State High School League rules. He lost a battle to be rehired in U.S. District court. Queen was fired in 1990 for having sex with <b>a</b> <b>student</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> early1980s. In the mid-1990s the boys' team had a dominating resurgence. Led by Khalid El-Amin, North tied a state record with three state championships in a row, from 1995 to 1997. The boys' teams have also won championships in 2003, 2016, and 2017.|$|E
5|$|Within {{the next}} {{two and a half}} hours, Cho {{returned}} to his room to rearm himself; he mailed a package to NBC News that contained pictures, digital video files and documents. At approximately 9:45a.m. EDT (13:45 UTC), he then crossed the campus to Norris Hall, a classroom building on the campus where, in a span of nine minutes, Cho shot dozens of people, killing 30 of them. As police breached the area of the building where Cho attacked the faculty and students, Cho committed suicide in Norris 211 with a gunshot to his temple. Cho's gunshot wound destroyed his face, obscuring identification of his body for several hours. The police identified Cho by matching the fingerprints on the guns used in the shootings with immigration records. Before the shootings, Cho's only known connection to Norris Hall was as <b>a</b> <b>student</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> sociology class, which met in a classroom {{on the second floor of}} the building. Although police had not stated positively at the time of the initial investigation that Cho was the perpetrator of the Norris Hall shootings and the earlier one at West Ambler Johnston Hall, forensic evidence confirmed that the same gun was used in both shooting incidents.|$|E
