40|$|Several {{efficient}} algorithms for computing erosions <b>and</b> <b>openings</b> {{have been}} proposed recently. They improve on VAN HERK's algorithm in terms of number of comparisons for large structuring elements. In this paper we introduce a theoretical framework of anchors that aims at {{a better understanding of}} the process involved in the computation of erosions <b>and</b> <b>openings.</b> It is shown that the knowledge of opening anchors of a signal f is sufficient to perform both the erosion <b>and</b> the <b>opening</b> of f. Then we propose an algorithm for one-dimensional erosions <b>and</b> <b>openings</b> which exploits opening anchors. This algorithm improves on the fastest algorithms available in literature by approximately 30 % in terms of computation speed, for a range of structuring element sizes and image contentsPeer reviewe...|$|R

5|$|A local architect, Thomas Fosbrooke, {{carried out}} the first archaeological {{investigation}} of the site in 1900, and extensive restoration work took place the following years. The Rawdon family were given a government grant for further repairs in 1912 {{and they began to}} start charging visitors for entry. The family found themselves unable to afford to maintain the castle, and by the early 1930s the walls had become unstable and dangerous. The castle was placed into the guardianship of the Ministry of Works in 1932, who carried out repairs, replacing some stonework <b>and</b> <b>opening</b> up the surrounding grounds to visitors.|$|E
5|$|After {{transitioning}} {{away from}} being a cover band, the group quickly gained popularity in the Puerto Rican reggae scene. Cultura Profética began performing in major reggae festivals <b>and</b> <b>opening</b> for Jamaican reggae musician Don Carlos. The band's first album, Canción de Alerta (1998), was recorded in the Tuff Gong studios at Jamaica with Errol Brown, frontman of Hot Chocolate and Bob Marley's sound engineer. The group was the first Spanish-language act to record in Marley's studios. The record discusses a number of social issues in Puerto Rico, including the importance of acknowledging the island's African influence.|$|E
5|$|After {{visiting his}} ancestral home in Suzhou, Pei created a design {{based on some}} simple but nuanced {{techniques}} he admired in traditional residential Chinese buildings. Among these were abundant gardens, integration with nature, and consideration {{of the relationship between}} enclosure <b>and</b> <b>opening.</b> Pei's design included a large central atrium covered by glass panels that functioned much like the large central space in his East Building of the National Gallery. Openings of various shapes in walls invited guests to view the natural scenery beyond. Younger Chinese who had hoped the building would exhibit some of Cubist flavor for which Pei had become known were disappointed, but the new hotel found more favour with government officials and architects.|$|E

Among the printers was Joseph Charless, who published the first newspaper west of the Mississippi, the Missouri Gazette, on July 12, 1808. In 1816 and 1817, groups of merchants formed the first banks in the town, but mismanagement and the Panic of 1819 led to their closure.|$|E
5|$|Another {{function}} of this coenzyme in cell signaling is as a precursor of cyclic ADP-ribose, which is produced from NAD by ADP-ribosyl cyclases, {{as part of}} a second messenger system. This molecule acts in calcium signaling by releasing calcium from intracellular stores. It does this by binding to <b>and</b> <b>opening</b> a class of calcium channels called ryanodine receptors, which are located in the membranes of organelles, such as the endoplasmic reticulum.|$|E
5|$|Baxter was {{recruited}} by the then-New South Wales University of Technology {{as a professor of}} chemical engineering in 1949. He {{became one of the most}} prolific public advocates of nuclear power for Australia. He served as chairman of the Australian Atomic Energy Commission from 1957 to 1972 and the International Atomic Energy Agency from 1969 to 1970. He oversaw the construction of the High Flux Australian Reactor (HIFAR) at Lucas Heights. He also founded the National Institute of Dramatic Art (NIDA), and, as the chairman of the Sydney Opera House Trust, brought the Sydney Opera House to completion <b>and</b> <b>opening</b> on 20 October 1973.|$|E

5|$|By September 1944, Allied {{forces had}} {{successfully}} broken {{out of their}} Normandy beachhead and pursued shattered German forces across Northern France and Belgium. Although Allied commanders generally favoured a broad front policy to continue the advance into Germany and the Netherlands, Field Marshal Bernard Montgomery proposed a bold plan to head north through the Dutch Gelderland, bypassing the German Siegfried Line defences <b>and</b> <b>opening</b> a route into the German industrial heartland of the Ruhr. Initially proposed as a British and Polish operation codenamed Operation Comet, the plan was soon expanded to involve most of the First Allied Airborne Army and a set piece ground advance into the Netherlands, codenamed Market Garden.|$|E

5|$|Due to the band's slow progress, Shields {{contemplated}} relocating to New York City, {{where members}} of his family were living at the time. However, Creation Records co-founder Joe Foster had decided to establish his own record label, Kaleidoscope Sound and persuaded My Bloody Valentine to record and release an EP. The New Record by My Bloody Valentine, produced by Foster, was released in October 1986 and was a minor success, peaking at number 22 on the UK Indie Chart upon its release. On the strength of the release, the band began performing more frequent shows, later developing a small following and travelling outside London for live performances, supporting <b>and</b> <b>opening</b> for bands such as The Membranes.|$|E

The architect, Jørn Utzon, had left, construction was behind schedule and over budget, and specialist staff needed to be recruited. Baxter put the project under his unpopular but decisive grip, and brought the Sydney Opera House to completion <b>and</b> <b>opening</b> on 20 October 1973.|$|E

In anticipation of the storm, the National Weather Service issued a flash flood watch for the island of Hawaii on July 20. Also, small craft advisories were in effect for Maui and Hawaii; wind advisories were issued for summits in those regions. High surf advisories were also put into effect for coastal areas. The Hawaii County Civil Defense prepared for the storm by planning for increases in emergency response personnel <b>and</b> <b>opening</b> of evacuation centers.
