5|$|Europe {{had been}} embroiled in warfare, pitting revolutionary France against {{a series of}} coalitions, nearly {{continuously}} since 1792. After five years of war, the French Republic subdued the First Coalition in 1797. A Second Coalition was formed in 1798, only to be defeated. In March 1802, France (now under Napoleon, as First Consul) and Great Britain, its one remaining enemy, agreed to end hostilities under the Treaty of Amiens. For {{the first time in}} ten years, all of Europe was at peace. However, many disagreements between the two sides remained unresolved, <b>and</b> <b>implementing</b> the agreements they had reached at Amiens seemed to be a growing challenge. Britain resented having to turn over all of its colonial conquests since 1793 when France was permitted to retain most of its conquered territory in Europe. France, meanwhile, was upset that British troops had not evacuated the island of Malta. In May 1803, Britain declared war on France.|$|E
5|$|Ferrari {{undertook}} additional medical {{study in}} Europe and the United States, learning pioneering techniques that she {{brought back to}} Argentina. She studied urinary tract monitoring at the Medical Faculty of Paris, earning the first diploma ever given to a woman.

She was responsible for bringing these innovations back with her to Argentina <b>and</b> <b>implementing</b> them at the maternity and gynecological unit she established at the Military Hospital. An ardent feminist, she established the Argentina Federation of University Women in 1936, and pushed for recognition of both {{civil and political rights}} for women. When the government of Argentina took a conservative turn in the late 1930s, she was pushed out of the hospital and later, in the early 1950s, out of teaching. She died in 1956.|$|E
5|$|The {{plaintiff}} in Lines International {{argued that the}} guidelines adopted by the multi-agency committee {{set up by the}} PSA, STPB and GSB were invalid as the committee had no existence at law. The High Court held that there was nothing unlawful or even intrinsically wrong with these government agencies setting up such a committee to discuss matters of relevance to their respective jurisdictions as long as each agency made its own decisions within the ambit of its own statutory powers. The notion that such a committee fettered PSA's discretion was dismissed by a further finding of fact that the ad-hoc committee had not acted as an entity in itself. Enforcement and appropriate action were left to the agencies. A meeting attended by the plaintiff's representatives at which the guidelines relating to cruises-to-nowhere were announced was facilitated by a moderator rather than a chairperson, and each of the agencies read out guidelines which they themselves would be adopting <b>and</b> <b>implementing.</b>|$|E

5|$|Caulfield was {{chairman}} of the committee that drafted the policies, standards and procedures for water resources planning that became known as Senate Document 97, subjecting new federal water projects to benefit/cost analysis for the first time. He was the staff leader in drafting the Water Resources Planning Act of 1965 and was instrumental in its passage through the U.S. Congress; becoming the first Director of the Water Resources Council, a cabinet-level interagency advisory committee created by that Act. From October 1961 to August 1969 he was the leading professional official within the United States government developing <b>and</b> <b>implementing</b> policies for comprehensive river basin planning. In 1968 he drafted and gained political acceptance of a Water Resources Councils' regulation changing the discount rate used in planning water projects from a formula based on the coupon rate of government bonds to one based on the yield rate—a substantial and important policy change. He also had a leading role in early development of the Water Resources Council's Principles and Standards for water project planning promulgated in September 1973.|$|E
5|$|Shark populations began declining. Since {{they are}} predators {{near the top}} of the marine food chain, an {{umbrella}} species, playing an important role in maintaining ocean ecosystems, this could have serious adverse environmental consequences for marine fisheries. Campaigns began in many nations to prohibit or greatly curtail finning in both territorial and international waters and work toward international agreements on the practice. In the U.S., President Bill Clinton signed the Shark Finning Prohibition Act (SFPA) into law in 2000 shortly before leaving office. It amended the Magnuson–Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act, the primary statute regulating fisheries in the U.S.'s Exclusive Economic Zone up to 200 nautical miles offshore, to prohibit finning in U.S. territorial waters by any vessels, and the possession of fins by a U.S.-flagged vessel in international waters or the landing of any fins at a U.S. port without corresponding carcasses amounting to at least 20 times the weight of the fins. The National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) was charged with promulgating <b>and</b> <b>implementing</b> regulations to enforce the act.|$|E
5|$|The game's {{sound and}} music were handled by Takahiro Ogata, Masaki Kurokawa and Kenichi Tsuchiya: Ogata acted as sound director. To {{accurately}} create {{the sound of}} modern-day Tokyo within Nine, Ogata and Kurokawa went to districts such as Kichijōji and Roppongi to make recordings of ambient sounds {{at different times of}} day. While there was a general theme for various city districts, the music subtly changed depending on the player's overall alignment: for instance, to represent the Law and Chaos alignments in the game, piano was used for the former and guitar for the latter. Battle music also featured randomly-generated soundtrack variations, with Ogata estimating somewhere over three hundred possible variants on battle themes. A major improvement enabled by the Xbox was the use of 5.1 surround sound, which could enable richer use of both music and in-game sound effects. According to Okada, this additional sound capacity would compensate for what could not be managed at a visual level. Maken X had already given the team a chance to use 3D sound, but Nine was the first title to make major use of 5.1, <b>and</b> <b>implementing</b> it alongside all the other features proved a challenge for the team.|$|E
