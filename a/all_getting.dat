5|$|This three Test series saw the West Indies re-establish {{themselves}} as the superior team. They won the first Test at The Oval by 158 runs, with Clive Lloyd's 132 with the bat and Keith Boyce's bowling (147/11 in the match) being the main contributions to the win. The drawn match at Edgbaston was {{at risk of being}} abandoned when umpire Arthur Fagg threatened to withdraw after Kanhai disputed one of his decisions. The final Test match at Lord's was dominated by the West Indies, with the team posting a huge total of 652/8 before declaring, Kanhai, Sobers and Bernard Julien <b>all</b> <b>getting</b> centuries. England never looked liked matching this total, and were dismissed for 233 in the first innings and 193 in the second, losing by an innings and 226 runs. This was England's second biggest defeat in Test cricket. The series finished 2–0 to the West Indies, who regained the Wisden Trophy.|$|E

Speaking to ISKCON devotee Mukunda Goswami in 1982, Harrison said: Back in the sixties, whatever we were <b>all</b> <b>getting</b> into, we tended to broadcast it as loud as we could. I had had certain realizations and went through a period where I was so thrilled about my discoveries and realizations that I wanted to shout and tell it to everybody.

500|$|The {{character}} of Rita {{has been well}} received by critics, who praised Benz’s portrayal. Eric Goldman of IGN has said, “Dexter does a solid job of developing {{the roles of the}} supporting cast, with Rita, Deb, Doakes and LaGuerta <b>all</b> <b>getting</b> a good amount of development”. [...] He added, “There were a couple of forced moments in [...] "Popping Cherry", most notably the drug dealer who came to Rita's house, in broad daylight, demanding money for her ex-husband's debts; it was all a bit over the top and cliché. On the other hand, it was interesting to note Dexter's inaction in that scene, making one wonder if perhaps he fears that any public display of physical defense, even for Rita, might result in him going too far and revealing what he is." [...] Jarett Wieselman of the New York Post has said, [...] "Rita always felt like the light in that dark show", and [...] "In the beginning Rita was the vessel through which the audience could love Dexter."

2500|$|Max Klinger also grew {{away from}} the {{cross-dressing}} reputation that overshadowed him. He dropped his Section 8 pursuit when taking over from Radar as company clerk. Both Jamie Farr and the producers {{felt that there was}} more to Klinger than a chiffon dress, and tried to develop the character more fully. In the role of company clerk, Klinger's personality turned more to the [...] "wheeler-dealer" [...] aspects developed in the streets of (Farr's actual hometown) Toledo, Ohio, using those skills to aid the 4077th. Farr stayed {{throughout the rest of the}} series. Klinger was later promoted from corporal to sergeant (he and Father Mulcahy were the only two characters to be promoted on-screen in the entire series; Frank Burns received his promotion off-screen after having left the series). In the final episode, Klinger is, ironically, the only character who announces that he is staying in Korea. He wants to help his wife, Soon Lee, find her parents. (He and Soon Lee marry at the end of the episode.) When Klinger announces that he is staying in Korea, Hawkeye says, [...] "You don't have to act crazy now. We're <b>all</b> <b>getting</b> out!" [...] However, in the short-lived spin-off, AfterMASH, it becomes clear that soon after the end of the war, Klinger, with new wife Soon Lee (Rosalind Chao), returned to the United States. After Soon Lee was subjected to discrimination in Toledo, the Klingers moved to River Bend, Missouri, and Max got a job similar to that he had had as the 4077th's company clerk for Chief of Staff Dr. Sherman Potter, now head of the General Pershing VA Hospital there.|$|E
2500|$|Electronic Dance Music (EDM) and its subgenres have [...] been {{important}} in South Florida. Starting in the 1970s with acts like Jimmy Bo Horne and KC and The Sunshine Band, dance music {{coming out of}} Florida could be heard all over the world. With the demographics of South Florida being made up of Cuban, Haitian, and many other Afro-Caribbean cultures, Dance Music became very popular adopting {{a lot of the}} grooves and percussion from those cultures. Early on the dance scene in South Florida was mostly playing the EDM subgenres Disco, House, and Freestyle. By the 1980s Miami in particular Miami Beach having clubs stay open till 5 AM, and the glut of easily available drugs, its dance scene began to get noticed internationally. In 1985 the Winter Music Conference, a yearly, week-long dance music conference/convention/showcase started in South Florida. The event has happened in Miami ever since. WMC as it is also known as, is famous as well for its Ultra Music Festival which happens the same week. By the 1990s many local DJs and producers where getting noticed. Acts like Murk, aka Funky Green Dogs, Planet Soul, and DJs like Robbie Rivera, where <b>all</b> <b>getting</b> air play not just in Florida but around the world. Clubs like Space Crobar, and Mansion also attracted first class international DJ as well increasing the musics popularity. [...] Miami would wind up allowing its night clubs to stay open 24 hours on the weekend. Thus increasing the demand for Dance Music. Clubs would regularly have internationally known DJs as well as local acts such as Ivano Belllini, Patrick M, and long list of others spin into the next day. Currently the EDM subgenres popular in South Florida in particular are Deep House, Tech House and Techno.|$|E
