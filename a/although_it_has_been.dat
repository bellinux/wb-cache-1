5|$|The Anthology of Pliny's Natural History is an {{epitome of}} Pliny the Elder's Natural History {{dedicated}} to King Henry II of England. It is of some {{importance in the}} transmission of Pliny's ideas to medieval Europe, <b>although</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> shown to be less important as a witness to Pliny's text than once thought.|$|E

5|$|The fungus {{probably}} favours calcareous soil, <b>although</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> {{found on}} nearly every soil type. It appears on sand, peat, limestone soils, rankers and Cambisols. It endures acidic as well as alkaline and low-nutrient to relatively high-nutrient soils. Heavily eutrophic soils are inappropriate for its habitat.|$|E
5|$|A recent calm period, {{with almost}} no {{earthquake}} or magmatic activity at Hualālai, has seen the growth of homes, businesses, and resorts on the mountain's flanks. The most recent major activity at the volcano was in 1929, when an intense earthquake swarm rocked Hualālai, most likely caused by magmatic action near the volcano's peak. <b>Although</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> relatively placid in the recent past, Hualālai is still potentially active, {{and is expected to}} erupt again within the next 100years.|$|E
5|$|<b>Although</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> {{a county}} road since 1960, F-41 {{was a state}} highway in 1919 when the state {{trunkline}} highway system was formed. It was {{a segment of the}} original M-10 that was replaced by US23 in 1926. Later changes to US23 shifted that road closer to Lake Huron, and the Michigan State Highway Department (MSHD) created two different routings for M-171 out of the former US23 routings in the area. The second of these highways has been designated F-41 since 1970.|$|E

5|$|Comparisons {{between the}} scleral rings of dinosaurs and modern birds and {{reptiles}} {{have been used}} to infer daily activity patterns of dinosaurs. <b>Although</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> suggested that most dinosaurs were active during the day, these comparisons have shown that small predatory dinosaurs such as dromaeosaurids, Juravenator, and Megapnosaurus were likely nocturnal. Large and medium-sized herbivorous and omnivorous dinosaurs such as ceratopsians, sauropodomorphs, hadrosaurids, ornithomimosaurs may have been cathemeral, active during short intervals throughout the day, although the small ornithischian Agilisaurus was inferred to be diurnal.|$|E
5|$|Exmoor {{also has}} a henge located near to Parracombe, <b>although</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> damaged by ploughing. Alongside this, the moor bears a profusion of other Bronze Age monuments, {{including}} between 300 and 400 round barrows, standing stones, and linear stone settings. The creation of these different monument types might explain why so few stone circles were apparently created here.|$|E
5|$|It was {{believed}} {{as late as}} 2002 that Noonan Syndrome with Multiple Lentigines (NSML) was related to neurofibromatosis type I (von Recklinghausen syndrome). In fact, since both ICD9 and ICD10 lack a specific diagnosis code for NSML, the diagnosis code for NF1 is still sometimes used for diagnostic purposes, <b>although</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> shown that the gene is not linked to the NF1 locus.|$|E

5|$|Rosebery's {{own mother}} was horrified {{at the thought}} of a Jewish woman, even a Rothschild, in the family. Rosebery too felt there was an impassable barrier of faith; at this time, it was inconceivable that any {{children}} could be reared as Jews. <b>Although</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> stated that Rosebery himself was devoid of any antisemitic views, this was not always true, especially in later life.|$|E
5|$|Tephrosia apollinea {{is known}} to be toxic to goats. <b>Although</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> used in Oman to treat bronchitis, cough, earache, nasal {{congestion}} and wounds and bone fractures, as of 1993 its wider impact on humans had not been assessed. It {{can be used to make}} indigo dyes, and the leaves and those of other plants are used to make hot drinks by the Bedouin in parts of Sinai and the Negev.|$|E
5|$|The Mercians, {{who participated}} in Edwin's defeat in 633, seem to have {{presented}} an obstacle to Oswald's authority south of the Humber, <b>although</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> generally thought that Oswald dominated Mercia to some degree after Heavenfield. It may have been to appease Oswald that Penda had Eadfrith, a captured son of Edwin (and thus a dynastic rival of Oswald), killed, although {{it is also possible}} that Penda had his own motives for the killing.|$|E

5|$|The Scottish Challenge Cup {{has been}} {{sponsored}} several times {{since it was}} introduced in 1990. The sponsor {{has been able to}} determine the name of the competition. There have been four sponsors since the competition's formation as well as several name changes within the duration of each sponsorship. The competition relies on revenue earned from sponsorship <b>although</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> able to run without a sponsor over two periods but had to be suspended for one season in 1998–99 as a consequence.|$|E
5|$|The {{traditional}} {{explanation is}} the earldom hypothesis. This assumes {{a period of}} Norse expansion into the Northern Isles {{and the creation of}} an aristocratic dynasty that lasted well into the Medieval period, which exerted considerable influence in western Scotland and Mann into the 11th century. This version of events is essentially as told by the Norse sagas and is supported by some archaeological evidence <b>although</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> criticised for exaggerating Orcadian influence in the Suðreyar.|$|E
5|$|This {{species is}} mainly diurnal, {{especially}} {{in the north of}} its range. Further south it is said to be active in the evening, and it may even be active at night during the summer months. It is predominantly a terrestrial species, <b>although</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> known to climb up banks and into low bushes in order to bask or search for prey.|$|E

5|$|Tylopilus alboater, {{commonly}} known as the black velvet bolete, is a bolete fungus in the Boletaceae family. The species is found in North America east of the Rocky Mountains, and in eastern Asia, including China, Japan, Taiwan, and Thailand. A mycorrhizal species, it grows solitarily, scattered, or in groups on the ground usually under deciduous trees, particularly oak, <b>although</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> recorded from deciduous, coniferous, and mixed forests.|$|E
5|$|Banksia acanthopoda {{is little}} known in cultivation, <b>although</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> {{successfully}} grown and propagated at The Banksia Farm in Mount Barker, Western Australia, {{and at the}} Royal Botanic Gardens in Cranbourne, Melbourne. It is a sprawling and untidy shrub, but its habit can be improved by pruning. Its prominent yellow flower heads appear from July to October in cultivation, and have potential {{for use in the}} cut flower industry. It prefers a well-drained soil in full sun or light shade, and will tolerate dry conditions once established. Propagation is by seed; seeds take three to five weeks to germinate, and have a germination rate of 80 to 90 percent.|$|E
5|$|Changing clocks and DST rules has {{a direct}} {{economic}} cost, entailing extra work to support remote meetings, computer applications and the like. For example, a 2007 North American rule change cost an estimated $500million to $1billion, and Utah State University economist William F. Shughart II has estimated the lost opportunity cost at around $1.7 billion USD. <b>Although</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> argued that clock shifts correlate with decreased economic efficiency, and that in 2000 the daylight-saving effect implied an estimated one-day loss of $31billion on U.S. stock exchanges, the estimated numbers depend on the methodology. The results have been disputed, and the original authors have refuted the points raised by disputers.|$|E
