5|$|By 1831, Romney Academy had outgrown its facilities, and the Romney Literary Society {{was given}} {{authorization}} to raise monies from a lottery to build <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>school</b> building. The society successfully raised the funds, and in 1845 bids were {{called for the}} construction of <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>school</b> building. On December 12, 1846, the Virginia General Assembly empowered the Romney Literary Society to establish a seminary for learning at the academy. That same year, a new brick building was constructed for the academy and for the library of the society; the building now serves as the central unit of the administration building of the West Virginia Schools for the Deaf and Blind.|$|E
5|$|<b>A</b> <b>new</b> <b>School</b> of Law {{building}} and parking garage were also {{constructed in the}} 1990s {{as part of the}} revitalization of downtown Newark.

In 1998, all incoming full-time, first-year students were issued laptop computers as part of the University's innovative and nationally recognized mobile computing program.|$|E
5|$|After the {{calendar}} stories, Hebel wrote Biblische Geschichten (Bible stories), <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>school</b> book for evangelical religious education. His criteria were {{that it should}} be clearly written and tell biblical stories in an exciting narrative style aimed at children from ten to fourteen. It took five years to write and was completed and released in 1824. It was used as a textbook until 1855.|$|E

5|$|At Springfield Elementary School, Bart is busted for {{vandalism}} by Principal Skinner, who {{has been}} informed by class genius Martin Prince. Faced {{with the prospect of}} failing an intelligence test, Bart surreptitiously switches exams with Martin. When the school psychologist, Dr. Pryor, studies the results, he identifies Bart as a genius, to the delight of Homer and Marge, who enroll him in <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>school.</b> However, Lisa is not fooled by his supposed genius and still believes Bart to be a moron; Skinner shares her belief, but takes advantage of Bart's departure from the school.|$|E
5|$|During Watts's lifetime, European culture {{had begun}} to {{question}} the concept of hope. <b>A</b> <b>new</b> <b>school</b> of philosophy at the time, based on the thinking of Friedrich Nietzsche, saw hope as a negative attribute that encouraged humanity to expend their energies on futile efforts. The Long Depression of the 1870s wrecked both the economy and confidence of Britain, and Watts felt that the encroaching mechanisation of daily life, {{and the importance of}} material prosperity to Britain's increasingly dominant middle class, were making modern life increasingly soulless.|$|E
5|$|In 1845, local {{members of}} the Church of England, {{as part of a}} {{petition}} calling for funding, stated that they had established <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>school.</b> By 1848 there was also a Wesleyan Sunday School with 20 students. By 1867 there was a secular state school in the town, though funding was inconstant and the school was closed {{for at least the next}} two years. This school never grew large; as of 1903 it had an average attendance of 20 students.|$|E

5|$|In {{the early}} 1980s, Greer {{served as the}} home field for the Father Ryan High School {{football}} team. Father Ryan returned to playing at Greer from 2006 through 2008, before moving to <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>school</b> athletic complex for the 2009 season. Depending on the Sounds' schedule, some of the school's home games were held at the visiting school's field (with Father Ryan designated as the home team) or at other unused local high school fields. In the football configuration, the field runs along the first base line.|$|E

For his performance, Parker was named the Mid-American Conference Offensive Player of the Week. The victory improved Toledo's all-time record against Northern Illinois to 16–6.|$|E
5|$|Klein ISD creates {{attendance}} zones for neighborhoods {{within the}} boundaries of the district. All neighborhoods are zoned to a specific elementary school, intermediate school, and high school. When <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>school</b> opens, or a school becomes overcrowded, the district begins realigning and rezoning certain neighborhoods to ensure that there is balance among all schools. Students must attend the assigned schools for their neighborhood, with the exception of students who attend the International Business Academy at Klein Forest High School or the International Baccalaureate program at Klein Oak High School.|$|E
50|$|<b>A</b> <b>newer</b> <b>school</b> building, {{opened in}} 2003, {{replaced}} the {{old high school}} building which had been built in 1939 and held its first classes in 1940. The school was originally located at 1000 Taylor Avenue.|$|R

5|$|Lasker {{followed}} Steinitz's principles, {{and both}} demonstrated {{a completely different}} chess paradigm than the “romantic” mentality before them. Thanks to Steinitz and Lasker, positional players gradually became common (Tarrasch, Schlechter, and Rubinstein stand out.) But, while Steinitz created <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>school</b> of chess thought, Lasker’s talents were far harder for the masses to grasp; hence there was no Lasker school.|$|E
5|$|St Rynagh's CC, {{originally}} {{known as}} Banagher Vocational School, opened in 1953 with 40 students enrolling {{under the guidance}} of the first principal, Ms. Elsie Naughton.

5|$|Texas' 652points were a NCAA DivisionI {{record for}} points scored {{in a season}} (broken by the 716 points scored by the 2008 Oklahoma Sooners). The {{previous}} record was 624points scored by Nebraska in 1983 (under NCAA rules, bowl game statistics count toward the total in 2005. Thus, all thirteen of Texas's games are counted in accumulating the 652 points. The 1983 Nebraska team scored 654 points, including its bowl game, but only its twelve regular season games are counted for statistics, thus the 624 total points). Their 50.2points per game set <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>school</b> record.|$|E

5|$|The Village School of Royton {{was founded}} in 1785, and {{continued}} to provide education until 1833, when <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>school</b> linked with Royton's parish church of St Paul, was opened. The village school became the local Sunday School, but split from St Paul's in 1838, reopening as a day school. The village school closed in 1907 and was demolished in 1969.|$|E
5|$|The {{first major}} crisis in Wall's early life {{occurred}} {{when she was}} 13 and her mother was reassigned to marry another man, Fred Jessop. Wall, along {{with her mother and}} sisters, moved to Hildale in the year 2000. The new family was particularly large, so the children were required to eat meals in shifts. She compared the experience to starting <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>school</b> in terms of aspects of life that she had to become re-accustomed to. Over time, several of her brothers and sisters left or were expelled from the church.|$|E
5|$|The {{victory was}} Maryland's sixth {{consecutive}} against ranked opponents, which set <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>school</b> record.

5|$|Aware of the {{inadequacy}} of bureaucracy in Austria, and wishing to improve it, Maria Theresa reformed education in 1775. In <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>school</b> system based on the Prussian one, all children of both genders from the ages of six to twelve were required to attend school. Education reform was met with hostility from many villages; Maria Theresa crushed the dissent by ordering the arrest of all those opposed. Although the idea had merit, the reforms were not as successful as {{they were expected to}} be since no funding was offered from the state; in some parts of Austria, half of the population was illiterate well into the 19thcentury.|$|E
5|$|Bridgwater was {{selected}} as the first town in the South West, outside Bristol, to be selected for the UK government's Building Schools for the Future (BSF) initiative, which aimed to rebuild and renew nearly every secondary school in England. Within Bridgwater, BSF was to redevelop all of the four secondary schools and two special provision schools at an expected cost of around £100 million. This included the complete relocation and rebuilding of <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>school</b> combining the both Haygrove and Penrose School. In July 2010, several components of the Bridgwater BSF programme were cancelled and others were singled out for further review. Following a meeting with Education Secretary Michael Gove, Bridgwater MP Ian Liddell-Granger announced that the fate of all six affected schools would be subject to review, including the ones that were cancelled.|$|E
