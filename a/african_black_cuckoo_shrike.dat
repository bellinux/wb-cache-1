50|$|The spotted ground-thrush is of {{particular}} note, as Pigeon Valley {{is one of the}} places where this endangered bird can be most reliably found in winter. It arrives typically in late March or early April, and is present until August or September; in 2015 it was present until 5 October. Summer migrants include, occasionally, <b>black</b> <b>cuckoo,</b> red-chested <b>cuckoo</b> and red-backed <b>shrike.</b>|$|R
50|$|The <b>black</b> <b>cuckoo</b> (Cuculus clamosus) is {{a common}} brood {{parasite}} of this boubou, parasitizing about 2% of its nests. When tropical boubous spot <b>black</b> <b>cuckoos,</b> they usually try to mob them away and are often successful in this; some pairs however {{seem to be very}} inept at preventing brood parasitism and may be affected several times per year.|$|R
50|$|Various {{species of}} forest birds are found here including; green twinspot, Cape white-eye, {{southern}} boubou, spotted ground-thrush, purple-crested turaco and <b>African</b> paradise-flycatcher. The <b>black</b> sparrowhawk breeds here annually. Another bird that is seldom seen {{but that is}} generally present is buff-spotted flufftail. Unusual sightings of note in recent years include European nightjar, lemon dove, mountain wagtail, black-throated wattle-eye and <b>black</b> <b>cuckoo.</b> The current bird list for Pigeon Valley includes 152 species.|$|R

50|$|The <b>black</b> <b>cuckoo</b> feeds {{mainly on}} hairy {{caterpillars}} but also consumes termites and ants, including winged ones caught in flight, beetles, grasshoppers and other insects, {{as well as}} birds' eggs and nestlings.|$|R
50|$|The {{greater ani}} (Crotophaga major) {{is a large}} bird in the cuckoo family. It is a {{breeding}} species from Panama and Trinidad through tropical South America to northern Argentina. It is {{sometimes referred to as}} the <b>black</b> <b>cuckoo.</b>|$|R
50|$|They are preyed {{on by the}} African goshawk, {{and their}} nest {{contents}} fall prey to the grey-headed bushshrike. They may be killed by ants or come under attack by territorial boubou shrikes. They are parasitised by the <b>black</b> <b>cuckoo</b> and emerald cuckoo, besides perhaps klaas's cuckoo and the red-chested cuckoo.|$|R
5000|$|The <b>black</b> <b>cuckoo</b> (Cuculus clamosus) is {{a species}} of cuckoo in the family Cuculidae. The species is {{distributed}} widely across sub-Saharan Africa. There are two subspecies. This cuckoo has a very wide range and is a common bird so the International Union for Conservation of Nature has rated it as a [...] "least-concern species".|$|R

40|$|UNLABELLED: Differences in {{sensitivity}} to anesthetic drugs {{have already been}} described among races. This {{study was designed to}} comparatively investigate the anesthetic requirements of two different ethnic groups: Caucasians and <b>African</b> <b>blacks.</b> Forty-five Caucasians from Italy and 45 <b>African</b> <b>blacks</b> from Senegal, who underwent general IV anesthesia with propofol and remifentanil, were comparatively evaluated for anesthetic depth and time lapsed before recovery. We used an electroencephalographic-derived index of depth of anesthesia, the bispectral index (BIS), and evaluation of clinical variables to assess the depth of anesthesia and the recovery trend. Mean BIS values from Caucasians after propofol discontinuation returned to baseline (92 - 100) in approximately 8 min, whereas in <b>African</b> <b>blacks</b> BIS values remained < 80 for some 30 min. Time to eye opening was 10. 6 +/- 4. 8 min in Caucasians versus 16. 9 +/- 8. 8 min in <b>African</b> <b>blacks</b> (P < 0. 001). Time to respond to loud verbal commands was 14. 8 +/- 9. 1 min in <b>African</b> <b>blacks</b> versus 9. 1 +/- 4. 2 min in Caucasians (P < 0. 01). During anesthetic induction, the mean arterial pressure decreased by 20 % in Caucasians and by only 10 % in <b>African</b> <b>blacks.</b> We conclude that the recovery from general anesthesia with propofol was slower in <b>African</b> <b>blacks</b> compared with Caucasian patients. IMPLICATIONS: This study demonstrates statistically significant differences between Caucasians and <b>African</b> <b>blacks</b> in the arousal time from IV anesthesia with propofol and remifentanil. The authors conclude that the recovery from general anesthesia was slower in <b>African</b> <b>blacks</b> compared with Caucasian patients...|$|R
40|$|Orientation: The study {{focuses on}} {{understanding}} labour turnover trends amongst <b>African</b> <b>Black</b> senior managers in South Africa. There {{is a perception}} that turnover amongst <b>African</b> <b>Black</b> senior managers is higher than average. There is also a perception that <b>African</b> <b>Black</b> senior managers are only motivated by financial rewards when considering job change. Research purpose: The study focused on understanding why <b>African</b> <b>Black</b> senior managers have a propensity to change jobs and how organisations can resolve the trend. Motivation for the study: To develop {{a better understanding of}} the push and pull factors for <b>African</b> <b>Black</b> senior managers in organisations. Research design, approach and method: The research was conducted in two phases, namely as part of a qualitative study and a quantitative study: Creswell (2003) refers to this approach as triangulation. The target population was <b>African</b> <b>Black</b> senior managers on the database of a large Human Resources Consultancy, The South African Rewards Association and the Association of Black Actuaries and Investment Professionals (ABSIP) (n = 2600). A total of 208 usable responses were received. Main findings: The main findings and contribution to the field of study was that <b>African</b> <b>Black</b> senior managers do not trust organisations with their career development. They would rather take control of their own career development by moving from organisation to organisation to build their repertoire of skills and competence. They want to be in charge of their careers. This finding has profound implications for organisations employing <b>African</b> <b>Black</b> managers in the senior cadre. Practical/managerial implications: Managers of <b>African</b> <b>Black</b> senior managers need to create attractive employee value propositions that address the main findings. Contribution/value-add: The research shows that <b>African</b> <b>Black</b> senior managers generally seek corporate environments that encourage a sense of belonging and with a clear career growth plan. </p...|$|R

50|$|The <b>black</b> <b>cuckoo</b> is a brood parasite. Its main hosts are bushshrikes, {{particularly}} the tropical boubou and crimson-breasted shrike. When parasitising the boubou, the eggs hatch after about fourteen days, {{three days before}} the boubou's eggs. The cuckoo chick evicts other eggs and nestlings usually within thirty hours of hatching. It is fledged in about sixteen days and leaves the nest a few days later. The foster parents continue to feed it for another three weeks.|$|R
40|$|The insect pest, <b>African</b> <b>black</b> beetle (Heteronychus arator (Fabricus, 1775)) is of {{considerable}} economic {{cost to the}} New Zealand agricultural industry, in regions where the insect is established and regular outbreaks are now occurring. Selection for EpichloÃ« festucae var. lolii (Latch, M. J. Chr. & Samuels) C. W. Bacon & Schardl, stat. nov. et comb. nov. endophyte-perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne L.) associations which do not cause toxicity to livestock and with strong resistance to <b>African</b> <b>black</b> beetle (H. arator), would be of significant value to farmers in regions where this pest is a problem. EpichloÃ« festucae var. lolii strain AR 1 endophyte does not produce ergovaline, the alkaloid known to deter <b>African</b> <b>black</b> beetle (H. arator), yet pastures infected with this endophyte have moderate resistance to adult <b>African</b> <b>black</b> beetle (H. arator). Research into AR 1 is of importance, as to date {{there have been no}} reports of toxicity in livestock brought about by consumption of from AR 1 -infected pastures {{and in the absence of}} <b>African</b> <b>black</b> beetle (H. arator) this ânovelâ endophyte can provide highly productive pastures. AR 1 endophyte produces secondary metabolites that are simple indole diterpenes, including paxilline and paxilline-like compounds. The numerous paxilline-like compounds produced by AR 1 are detected by a paxilline ELISA (enzyme linked immunosorbant assay) and quantified collectively as paxilline immunoreactive equivalents. Earlier work suggested that these paxilline-like compounds could be the bioactive, or linked-marker associated with the bioactive compound(s), that provide some resistance to adult <b>African</b> <b>black</b> beetle (H. arator) feeding. The overall aim of this research was to determine if increased concentration of paxilline immunoreactivity was associated with a reduction in feeding damage using a series of adult <b>African</b> <b>black</b> beetle (H. arator) feeding trials on closely related AR 1 -infected perennial ryegrasses (L. perenne). A negative relationship was established between feeding damage from adult <b>African</b> <b>black</b> beetle (H. arator) and plant pseudostem paxilline immunoreactivity in AR 1 -infected perennial ryegrass (L. perenne) post exposure to beetles. However, it was not a simple relationship being complicated by: i) paxilline immunoreactivity ï¿¼not reflecting endophyte concentrations; ii) the influence of cultivar on the expression levels of paxilline immunoreactivity; iii) the effect of <b>African</b> <b>black</b> beetle (H. arator) presence on expression levels of paxilline immunoreactivity; and iv) the paxilline ELISA quantifying the complete complex of paxilline-like compounds and not simply those that are bioactive. The highest concentrations of paxilline immunoreactivity were found in plant undamaged pseudostem and were not strongly correlated with the lower concentrations found in herbage. Therefore undamaged pseudostem is recommended as the section sampled if the entire plant pseudostem was not available. Low levels of feeding from adult <b>African</b> <b>black</b> beetle (H. arator) accentuated plant tiller production. However, the negative effects of high feeding pressure still affected plants four weeks post-exposure to beetles, with reduced paxilline immunoreactivity production and plant tiller numbers. Adult <b>African</b> <b>black</b> beetle (H. arator) were able to compensate the deterrent effects of AR 1 once an endophyte-free food source was available. Results from this research contribute towards further understanding the bioactivity of AR 1 endophyte against adult <b>African</b> <b>black</b> beetle (H. arator) and will underpin further research into the chemical basis for this resistance. The paxilline ELISA could potentially be used for screening E. festucae endophyte ryegrass associations that produce unknown compounds which deter <b>African</b> <b>black</b> beetle (H. arator) and which do not cause toxicity to livestock...|$|R
