The composer Edgar Bainton said of him, [...] "Whatever opinions may be held upon Stanford's music, and they are many and various, it is, I think, always recognised that he was a master of means. Everything he turned his hand to always 'comes off.

Acheson formed a working group under the United States National Security Council (NSC) executive secretary Sidney Souers, consisting of R. Gordon Arneson, Paul Nitze and Fisher, who served as the State Department's legal adviser on the project. It was Arneson's view that each member of the working group were of one mind. He said, [...] "The four principals in the State Department were Acheson, Nitze, Fisher and myself. I don't think it was necessary for <b>any</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> to persuade anybody else; we all were of a mind that there really wasn't any choice." ...|$|E
500|$|In summer 1902 Borchgrevink was one {{of three}} geographers invited by the National Geographic Society (NGS) to report on the after-effects of the catastrophic eruptions of Mount Pelée, on the French-Caribbean island of Martinique. These eruptions, in May 1902, had {{destroyed}} the town of Saint-Pierre, with enormous loss of life. Borchgrevink visited the island in June, when the main volcanic activity had subsided, and found the mountain [...] "perfectly quiet", and the islanders recovered from their panic. However, he did not think that Saint-Pierre would ever be inhabited again. He reported a narrow escape when, {{at the foot of the}} mountain, a jet of steam came out of the ground over which he and his party had just passed: [...] "If it had struck <b>any</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> we would have been scalded to death". He later presented his report to the NGS in Washington.|$|E

500|$|The {{institution}} of the draft and the arrest of outspoken anti-administration Democrat Clement Vallandigham further incensed Pierce, who gave an address to New Hampshire Democrats in July 1863 vilifying Lincoln. [...] "Who, I ask, has clothed the President with power to dictate to <b>any</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> when we must or when we may speak, or be silent upon any subject, and especially {{in relation to the}} conduct of any public servant?", he demanded. Pierce's comments were ill-received in much of the North, especially as his criticism of Lincoln's aims coincided with the twin Union victories at Gettysburg and Vicksburg. Pierce's reputation in the North was further damaged the following month when the Mississippi plantation of the Confederate president, Jefferson Davis, was seized by Union soldiers. Pierce's correspondence with Davis, all pre-war, revealing his deep friendship with Davis and predicting that civil war would result in insurrection in the North, was sent to the press. Pierce's words hardened abolitionist sentiment against him.|$|E
500|$|Like many musicians of his generation, Holst {{came under}} Wagner's spell. He had recoiled {{from the music}} of Götterdämmerung when he heard it at Covent Garden in 1892, but {{encouraged}} by his friend and fellow-student Fritz Hart he persevered and quickly became an ardent Wagnerite. Wagner supplanted Sullivan as the main influence on his music, and for some time, as Imogen put it, [...] "ill-assimilated wisps of Tristan inserted themselves on nearly every page of his own songs and overtures." [...] Stanford admired some of Wagner's works, and had in his earlier years been influenced by him, but Holst's sub-Wagnerian compositions met with his disapprobation: [...] "It won't do, me boy; it won't do". Holst respected Stanford, describing him to a fellow-pupil, Herbert Howells, as [...] "the one man who could get <b>any</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> out of a technical mess", but he found that his fellow students, rather than the faculty members, had the greater influence on his development.|$|E

40|$|Background: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the efficacy of ultrasonic features in predicting the malignancy of thyroid nodules in a group of Chinese patients. Methods: In all, 762 patients with thyroid nodules (424 malignant and 338 benign) underwent ultrasound (US) check and surgery between March 2011 and July 2014 at Peking University First Hospital were identified. Univariate and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analyses were performed to calculate the sensitivity, specificity, negative and positive predictive values <b>of</b> each <b>US</b> feature, and the accuracy of their combinations for prediction of malignancy. Results: Patients with malignant nodules were younger and without obvious risk history than those in the benign group (P < 0. 001, P = 0. 93). No individual US sign was fully predictive of a malignant lesion. The Youden indexes of irregular margins and hypoechogenicity were the first and second highest in all US features, which were 51. 9 % and 45. 2 %, respectively. The sensitivity of solid components (89. 7 %) and hypoechogenicity (89. 2 %) and the specificity of taller-than-wide shape (98. 5 %) and microcalcifications (90. 6 %) were the first and second highest in all US features. Intranodular flow on a color Doppler examination was a weak predictor of malignancy. Under ROC analysis excepting intranodular flow, the 95 % confidence interval (CI) of areas under the curves of hypoechogenicity and irregular margins with <b>any</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the <b>US</b> features were overlapped that of five-feature combinations (95 % CI: 0. 850 – 0. 901). Conclusions: We should be alert with taller-than-wide shape and microcalcifications. Intranodular flow was a weak predictor of malignancy. According to Youden indexes and ROC analysis, irregular margins and hypoechogenicity combined with solid component or taller-than-wide shapes or microcalcifications have a high predicative value for malignant thyroid nodules in Chinese patients...|$|R
60|$|It is certain, then, that {{a part of}} our {{notion of}} a body {{consists}} of the notion of a number of sensations of our own, or of other sentient beings, habitually occurring simultaneously. My conception of the table at which I am writing is compounded of its visible form and size, which are complex sensations of sight; its tangible form and size, which are complex sensations of our organs of touch and of our muscles; its weight, which is also a sensation of touch and of the muscles; its color, which is a sensation of sight; its hardness, which is a sensation of the muscles; its composition, which is another word for all the varieties of sensation which we receive under various circumstances from the wood of which it is made, and so forth. All or most of these various sensations frequently are, and, as we learn by experience, always might be, experienced simultaneously, or in many different orders of succession at our own choice: and hence the thought <b>of</b> <b>any</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> them makes <b>us</b> think <b>of</b> the others, and the whole becomes mentally amalgamated into <b>one</b> mixed state <b>of</b> consciousness, which, {{in the language of the}} school of Locke and Hartley, is termed a Complex Idea.|$|R

40|$|Most <b>of</b> <b>us</b> are {{concerned}} about our careers. We want a career that helps to avoid obsolescence, continually develops toward professional mastery, and retains our value to customers and clients. But the traditional notion of career—a single job at one firm held for most <b>of</b> <b>one’s</b> working life—is obsolete. How shall we attend to this concern? The good news: a better notion of career is emerging. Many professionals have already found it extremely helpful. The bad news: few of our traditional educational institutions are able to help. We must design our own ways to make our careers prosperous and satisfying. What is ‘Career’? Our traditional understandings of “career ” are captured well in standard dictionary definitions. They include <b>one</b> or more <b>of</b> the following notions: • The particular occupation for which one is trained; • A general course of conduct in life or a calling in life, visible to others in one’s community; • The general progression <b>of</b> <b>one’s</b> working or professional life; • Time in a profession after receiving one’s last formal degree (BS, MS, or Ph. D.); and • Doing {{the same thing over}} a long period of time (as in “She made her hobby into a career”). Most working lives do not fit these notions. Many <b>of</b> <b>us</b> have changed fields since receiving our college degrees, and many will change fields several times more. Many <b>of</b> <b>us</b> don’t want to make a long-term commitment to <b>any</b> <b>one</b> employer. Many <b>of</b> <b>us</b> do not even know if we have a calling. Is career a dead notion? Is all the college talk about preparation for career obsolete and misleading? Fernando Flores and John Gray think so. They say that two lifestyles are emerging in the wake of career’s death [3, 4].

Flores and Gray use the term “wired life ” for the first, and “entrepreneurial life” for the second. Unfortunately, these two terms evoke negative connotations. For example, “wired” sounds like a shallow, self-centered fad to some people; “entrepreneur” suggests greedy, unscrupulous competitor to some.
