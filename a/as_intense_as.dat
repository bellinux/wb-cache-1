5|$|The volcano's {{observed}} {{history has}} mostly {{been one of}} effusive eruptions; however, this is a relatively recent occurrence. Prior {{to the arrival of}} the first Europeans on the island, Kīlauea was the site of regular explosive activity, evidenced then by tribal chants referencing the volcano's fickle nature, and today by geological records of an explosively active mode of past activity. Although explosive activity still occurs at the volcano, it is not <b>as</b> <b>intense</b> <b>as</b> it once was, and the volcano would become much more dangerous to the general public if it returned to its old phase of activity once more.|$|E
5|$|Due to Fort Corcoran's {{large size}} and {{proximity}} to Georgetown, duty {{as part of}} the fort's garrison was less of a hardship than it was at many of the more isolated forts in the defenses of Washington, such as Fort Greble. Morale and sanitation officers often visited Fort Corcoran, and leave to visit Georgetown or Washington was sometimes granted to both officers and enlisted men. Men at the fort served in regimental bands or played baseball in their spare time between periods of infantry and gunnery drill. Due to Fort Corcoran's location behind the Arlington Line, however, drill was not <b>as</b> <b>intense</b> <b>as</b> at many front-line fort.|$|E

25|$|The Bills and Jets both {{represent}} {{the state of}} New York, though the Jets actually play their games in East Rutherford, New Jersey. The rivalry started as the Bills and Jets were both original teams in the AFL. Though the rivalry represents the differences between New York City and Upstate New York, it is not <b>as</b> <b>intense</b> <b>as</b> the Bills' rivalries with the Dolphins and Patriots, and the teams' fanbases usually have a begrudging {{respect for each other}} when not playing one another. Often times the rivalry has become beset with ugly games and mediocrity, but the rivalry briefly heated up when former Jets head coach Rex Ryan became head coach of the Bills for two seasons. Buffalo leads the series 60-53 as of 2016, including a playoff win in 1981.|$|E

25|$|Water absorbs {{light of}} long {{wavelengths}}, so less light from these wavelengths reflects back {{to reach the}} eye. Therefore, warm colors from the visual light spectrum appear less vibrant at increasing depths. Water scatters light of shorter wavelengths, meaning cooler colors dominate the visual field in the photic zone. Light intensity decreases 10 fold with every 75 m of depth, so at depths of 75 m, light is 10% <b>as</b> <b>intense</b> <b>as</b> {{it is on the}} surface, and is only 1% as intense at 150 m as it is on the surface. Because the water filters out the wavelengths and intensity of water reaching certain depths, different proteins, because of the wavelengths and intensities of light they are capable of absorbing, are better suited to different depths. Theoretically, some fish eyes can detect light as deep as 1000 m. At these depths of the aphotic zone, the only sources of light are organisms themselves, giving off light through chemical reactions in a process called bioluminescence.|$|E
25|$|Williams had {{neglected}} to tell Mansell that Prost had signed for 1993 at {{only the second}} race of the 1992 season in Mexico, a position that Mansell felt {{would be similar to}} their days together at Ferrari. To boot, Ayrton Senna had expressed a strong desire to drive for Williams and even offered to drive for them at no salary (only to later be rebuffed as Prost, whose rivalry with the Brazilian was just <b>as</b> <b>intense</b> <b>as</b> the one he had with Mansell, had a clause written into his contract which enabled him to block Senna's effort). Williams decided that there was little sense in paying the high fees Mansell went on to demand. With the original offer revoked, and with the premiere teams already committed to their incumbent drivers, Mansell decided to move on. An 11th hour offer was made to him at the Italian Grand Prix, but by then the damage was done; Mansell retired from F1.|$|E

500|$|A {{prominent}} gameplay {{element is}} [...] "reflex time", which slows down the game world while still allowing the player to aim and react at normal speeds. This effect {{is used to}} simulate the character's superhuman reflexes.

F.E.A.R. lead designer Craig Hubbard stated that Monolith Productions' primary goal was [...] "to make combat <b>as</b> <b>intense</b> <b>as</b> the tea house shootout {{at the beginning of}} John Woo's Hard-Boiled."

[...] IGN writer Ramsey Isler did not think there was anything [...] "particularly remarkable about the core elements of this story – it's the same old formula that both Fringe and The X-Files used frequently – but the episode has a generous helping of little revealing character elements sprinkled throughout." [...] Isler praised the final ten minutes for [...] "provid some really interesting action" [...] with Olivia's ending of the case, and the revelation of Simon's note in conjunction with Sam's knowledge of the First People. He ultimately graded the episode 7.5/10.|$|E
500|$|Although Verlaine {{was against}} drug use after Television formed, {{he once had}} a {{short-lived}} phase using psychedelic drugs, to which he makes reference in similes on songs such as [...] "Venus". The vignette-like lyrics follow an ostensibly drug-induced, revelatory experience: [...] "You know it's all like some new kind of drug / my senses are sharp and my hands are like gloves / Broadway looks so medieval, it seems to flap like little pages / I fell sideways laughing, with a friend from many stages." [...] According to Waterman, although psychedelic trips informed the experiences of many artists in lower Manhattan at the time, [...] "Venus" [...] contributed to the impression of Marquee Moon as a transcendental work in the vein of 19th-century Romanticism: [...] "Verlaine is into perception, and sometimes the perception he represents is <b>as</b> <b>intense</b> <b>as</b> a mind-altering substance." [...] Christgau said the lyric about Broadway lent the album its association among critics to the East Village, as it [...] "situates this philosophical action in the downtown night".|$|E
