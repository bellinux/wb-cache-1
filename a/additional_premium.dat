25|$|Between 1956 and {{the advent}} of Personal Pension Schemes in July 1988, Equitable sold {{policies}} with an option to choose at the retirement date between a fixed Guaranteed Annuity Rate (GAR) or the Current Annuity Rate (i.e. the market annuity rate at that time) (CAR). The latter reflected the anticipated investment return on the lump sum over the annuity holder's lifetime and often changed depending on long-term interest yields and views on future longevity. No <b>additional</b> <b>premium</b> was charged in respect of the guarantee.|$|E
25|$|Controlling {{interest}} {{level is}} the value that an investor {{would be willing to}} pay to acquire more than 50% of a company's stock, thereby gaining the attendant prerogatives of control. Some of the prerogatives of control include: electing directors, hiring and firing the company's management and determining their compensation; declaring dividends and distributions, determining the company's strategy and line of business, and acquiring, selling or liquidating the business. This level of value generally contains a control premium over the intermediate level of value, which typically ranges from 25% to 50%. An <b>additional</b> <b>premium</b> may be paid by strategic investors who are motivated by synergistic motives.|$|E
25|$|The {{liability}} {{limit of}} the owner's policy is typically the purchase price paid for the property. As {{with other types of}} insurance, coverages can also be added or deleted with an endorsement. There are many forms of standard endorsements to cover a variety of common issues. The premium for the policy may be paid by the seller or buyer as the parties agree. Usually a custom in a particular state or county on this matter reflects in most local real estate contracts. One should inquire about the cost of title insurance before signing a real estate contract that provides that he pay for title charges. A real estate attorney, broker, escrow officer (in the western states), or loan officer can provide detailed information as to the price of title search and insurance before the real estate contract is signed. Title insurance coverage lasts as long as the insured retains an interest in the land insured and typically no <b>additional</b> <b>premium</b> is paid after the policy is issued.|$|E

Carrier downgrades may result in the lender choosing to not pay <b>additional</b> <b>premiums,</b> requiring the borrower to post additional collateral or call the loan and collapse all the collateral to cover any moneys due to the Lender. Most premium finance platforms require carriers to be S&P rated A or greater.|$|R

25|$|The {{charge port}} area now {{comes with a}} light not {{provided}} on earlier models, {{and the ability to}} open the port door from inside the car or by using the key fob. The onboard charger in all 2013 Leafs has also been reduced in size and relocated to a new position under the hood, which increases cargo volume. The new base trim level is called the Leaf S model, and {{is the result of a}} strategy for affordability. The S trim replaces the LED headlights with less expensive projector beams, and uses 16-inch steel wheels with plastic covers rather than alloy wheels. The base trim does not include the navigation system and the remote connectivity that allows drivers to turn on the climate control and monitor battery charging remotely using a smartphone. LED headlamps, fog lights, 17-inch alloy wheels and leather seating, are reserved for the higher-end SL trim. <b>Additional</b> <b>premium</b> upgrades to the SL trim include a Bose seven-speaker audio system and around view monitor, which puts cameras in front, in back and on the side mirrors for parking assistance.|$|E

50|$|The trend {{up until}} 2007-2008 was to reduce {{premiums}} on GUL {{to the point}} where there was virtually no cash surrender values at all, essentially creating a level term policy that could last to age 121. Since then, many companies have introduced either a second GUL policy that has a slightly higher premium, but in return the policy owner has cash surrender values that show a better internal rate of return on surrender than the <b>additional</b> <b>premiums</b> could earn in a risk-free investment outside of the policy.|$|R

40|$|This {{special issue}} of AStA aims to offer an {{overview}} of some relevant problems in actuarial science, involving statistical aspects. For centuries, the function of (re) insurers has been to sell risk coverage. Insurance companies charge premiums for covering these risks. The premiums are collected in advance while claim amounts are known only later. In most cases, the amount of premium is fixed so that the insurer cannot counteract adverse experience by charging <b>additional</b> <b>premiums.</b> The liabilities of insurance companies have, thus, to be carefully assessed {{in order to ensure}} solvency and to achieve profitability. The increasing complexity of insurance policies (sometimes covering several perils or catastrophic events, or running over decades in a changing environment) requires sophisticated risk theory models and advanced statistical methods, such as those presented in this special issue...|$|R

25|$|Both House Republicans and President Obama {{proposed}} {{increasing the}} <b>additional</b> <b>premiums</b> {{paid by the}} wealthiest people with Medicare, compounding several reforms in the ACA that would {{increase the number of}} wealthier individuals paying higher, income-related Part B and Part D premiums.

If the brackets mandated for 2035 were implemented today, it would mean that anyone earning more than $47,000 (as an individual) or $94,000 (as a couple) would be affected. Under the Republican proposals, affected individuals would pay 40 percent of the total Part B and Part D premiums, which would be equivalent of $2,500 today.|$|R

30|$|The {{compensation}} scheme provides national coverage for damages caused by natural hazard-induced disasters, but {{also includes a}} preventive component. The Act of 1982 states that compensation should be provided only if the usual measures to prevent damages were not effective or could not be taken. Incentives for prevention have been reinforced through the 1995 introduction of the Risk Prevention Plan (RPP) that allows insurers to refuse insurance if buildings do not comply with RPP zoning or recommendations (Gérin 2011). The Act also established the Fund for the Prevention of Major Natural Risks (Fonds de Prévention des Risques Naturels Majeurs—FPRNM or “Barnier Fund”) in 1995, which is sustained by a 12 % levy on the <b>additional</b> <b>premiums</b> related to natural disasters. 3 This state fund subsidizes various individual or collective prevention measures under certain conditions, including existence of a RPP (Nussbaum 2015). There is growing interest among French insurance companies to optimize this fund allocation, and the insurance companies have investigated the question of preventive measures, their efficiency, and the role that evaluative results would have in their relations with insured people and public authorities (Gérin 2011).|$|R
