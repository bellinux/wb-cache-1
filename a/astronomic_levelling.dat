40|$|In {{the part}} I {{of this paper}} {{theoretical}} background of <b>astronomic</b> <b>levelling</b> and least squares collocation methods were given. Furthermore both accuracy and weights of astrogeodetic and astrogravimetric deflections of the vertical were de-termined. In the present part II the astrogeodetic and astrogravimetric geoid mod-els are developed from improved deflections of the vertical {{with the use of}} astro-nomical levelling and least squares collocation. In order to assess their accuracy all four computed models are tested on sites of satellite POLREF network connected to precise levelling network. 2. Determination of the Astrogeodetic Geoid Model Astronomical levelling provides geoid height differences N between the points of surveyed astrogeodetic deflections of the vertical, 	. Calculated geoid height differences between the astrogeodetic points can further be adjusted in the network adjustment. For the ABC triangle the condition of loop closure [3]: N N N AB BC CA 0 (1) must be fulfilled. The adjusted geoid height differences in the network can be ob-tained using least squares adjustment based on condition of equation) ...|$|E
40|$|In {{the field}} of gravity {{determination}} {{a special kind of}} boundary value problem respectively ill-posed satellite problem occurs; the data and hence side condition of our PDE are oblique second order derivatives of the gravitational potential. In mathematical terms this means that our gravitational potential v fulfills Δ v = 0 in the exterior space of the Earth and D v = f on the discrete data location which is on the Earth's surface for terrestrial measurements and on a satellite track in the exterior for spaceborne measurement campaigns. D is a first order derivative for methods like geometric <b>astronomic</b> <b>levelling</b> and satellite-to-satellite tracking (e. g. CHAMP); it is a second order derivative for other methods like terrestrial gradiometry and satellite gravity gradiometry (e. g. GOCE). Classically one can handle first order side conditions which are not tangential to the surface and second derivatives pointing in the radial direction employing integral and pseudo differential equation methods. We will present a different approach: We classify all first and purely second order operators D which fulfill Δ D v = 0 if Δ v = 0. This allows us to solve the problem with oblique side conditions as if we had ordinary i. e. non-derived side conditions. The only additional work which has to be done is an inversion of D, i. e. integration...|$|E
40|$|In past Century, the {{air power}} had {{undergone}} a significant journey. In its humble beginnings during WWI an airplane proved itself a perspective and highly capable new weapon. WWII demonstrated the importance of air superiority for waging a global warfare. The Cold War mastered technologies enabling air power {{to be not only}} a weapon a mass destruction but also a surgical tool. On one hand, an aircraft has become a state of art technology, yet on the other hand a cost for its development, procurement, and servicing grew into an <b>astronomic</b> <b>levels.</b> Therefore, since mid 1970 s there have been trends to shift airpower from quantity into quality, which has gained a new moment {{with the end of the}} Cold War. Starting with the first Gulf War, in past two decades demonstrated a growing importance of a multirole fighter aircraft that is able to carry out a full specter of missions for minimal costs. When analyzing five most potent airpowers of the 21 st century, we can witness that this is the trend is on and it will surely continue in future...|$|R
50|$|The {{northern}} part of the Shire expanded rapidly from the late 1960s onwards with the development of the Logan area, which had become a southeastern suburban growth corridor for Brisbane. On 8 June 1978, the Shire of Logan was separately incorporated, and Albert lost 110.0 km2 of its area and 54,650 people in the change—almost three-quarters of its population. The effect of this change was to transform Albert into a purely Gold Coast-area council. With the <b>astronomic</b> growth <b>levels</b> experienced by the Gold Coast area from the late 1970s onwards, the new Albert grew from 18,753 at the 1976 census to 143,697 in 1991.|$|R
40|$|Based on a 76 years {{time series}} of high water levels along the Belgian Coast at Ostend, the extreme value {{distribution}} of total water levels is investigated, {{as well as}} the separate distributions for the astronomic component and the storm surge levels. The series were derived by Technum-IMDC-Alkyon (2002) in a previous research study for the Flanders Hydraulics Research Laboratory. The extreme value analysis makes use of the recently developed QQR method based on regression in quantile plots (Beirlant et al., 2005). This method allows the tail heaviness of the extreme value distribution to be investigated and a generalized extreme value distribution to be fitted to water levels above an optimal threshold. Extremes were extracted from the series using three methods: the classical method with annual maxima, the full series of water level maxima during tidal periods, and through derivation of a partial-duration-series (PDS) with nearly independent extremes defined by independence criteria. The criteria are based on the independence period (4 to 10 tidal cycles) and the accuracy in the calculation of the <b>astronomic</b> water <b>level</b> component. Different PDS series were derived considering weak and strong independence. It is shown in Willems et al. (2007) that the different series need to converge asymptotically towards the same ext reme value distribution’s tail; see the results for Ostend in the Figure. The 76 years series is subject to a trend due to sea level rise. The effect of this historical sea level rise on the extreme value distribution’s tail was investigated. This was done comparing extreme water level quantiles (water levels for given exceedance probabilities, return periods or mean recurrence intervals) with and without detrending the different extreme water level series (taking the most recent year as reference). It is concluded that the detrending affects the water level quantiles only in a minor way (Figure). Derivation of coastal extreme value distributions is traditionally done through convolution of the distribution of stochastic storm surges and the deterministically known <b>astronomic</b> tidal <b>levels.</b> This paper, however, shows that this convolution does not lead to more accurate results in comparison with the direct use of total water levels. The authors explain this by the linear relation that exists between the total water level quantiles and the storm surge level quantiles in the tail of the extreme value distribution. Based on the parametric bootstrapping technique, it is furthermore shown that the asymptotic tail distribution, in coastal engineering used on the basis of extrapolations to higher return periods (e. g. to 10000 years in the Belgian coastal defense design), does not lead to less accurate results when convolution is not applied. This conclusion has important advantages for future coastal design applications; extreme value distributions can be derived in a far more simplified way, and with a more parsimonious mode...|$|R
40|$|Tide is a {{sea level}} up-down water motion {{basically}} depending on three different phenomena: the Earth-Moon-Sun gravitational relationship, the water surface fluid reaction to atmospheric meteorological dynamic {{action and the}} Newtonian vertical adjustment of the sea surface due to atmospheric pressure variations. The first tide component (astro-tide) is periodic and well known in all points of the Earth surface; the second one {{is directly related to}} the meteorological phenomenon and then it is foreseeable; the Newtonian component, on the contrary, is not readily predictable by a general hydrostatic law, because the factor “J ” that represents the Newtonian transfer (from the atmospheric weight to the consequent sea level) is variable in each harbour area. A statistical study and the related numerical data interpretation of the measurements performed in the Ports of Genoa, La Spezia, Marina di Carrara, Livorno, Piombino, Civitavecchia and Ravenna (belonging to the Italian Newtonian Meteotide Network) show port values of Jph (from 1. 4 - 1. 6 cm/hPa to> 2 cm/hPa, on the contrary of the off-shore areas where Jph is about 1 cm/hPa). This phenomenon (hydrobarometric tide wave) produces even double values of harbour sea level fluctuations amplitude in comparison to <b>astronomic</b> tide sea <b>level</b> oscillations, and is characterized by a wavelength from 8 - 12 h to same days and a 10 - 25 days/year as mean temporal occurrence in th...|$|R
