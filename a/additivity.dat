5|$|Gleason's theorem {{implies the}} nonexistence of {{certain types of}} hidden {{variable}} theories for quantum mechanics, strengthening a previous argument of John von Neumann. Von Neumann had claimed to show that hidden variable theories were impossible, but (as Grete Hermann pointed out) his demonstration made an assumption that quantum systems obeyed a form of <b>additivity</b> of expectation for noncommuting operators that might not hold a priori. In 1966, John Stewart Bell showed that Gleason's theorem {{could be used to}} remove this extra assumption from von Neumann's argument.|$|E
25|$|Another {{generalization}} is the finitely additive measure, {{which are}} sometimes called contents. This {{is the same}} as a measure except that instead of requiring countable <b>additivity</b> we require only finite <b>additivity.</b> Historically, this definition was used first. It turns out that in general, finitely additive measures are connected with notions such as Banach limits, the dual of L∞ and the Stone–Čech compactification. All these are linked {{in one way or another}} to the axiom of choice.|$|E
25|$|The {{proof of}} the {{identity}} requires only expressing the definition of norm {{in terms of the}} inner product and multiplying out, using the property of <b>additivity</b> of each component.|$|E
25|$|This {{can also}} be derived from the <b>additivity</b> of variances, since the total (observed) score {{is the sum of}} the {{predicted}} score and the error score, where the latter two are uncorrelated.|$|E
25|$|Tukey's range test, the Tukey lambda distribution, Tukey's test of <b>additivity</b> and Tukey's lemma all bear his name. He is {{also the}} creator of several little-known methods such as the trimean and median-median line, an easier {{alternative}} to linear regression.|$|E
25|$|There is a {{sense in}} which this kind of <b>additivity</b> expresses a {{fundamental}} postulate that goes beyond the simplest ideas of classical closed system thermodynamics; the extensivity of some variables is not obvious, and needs explicit expression; indeed one author {{goes so far as to}} say that it could be recognized as a fourth law of thermodynamics, though this is not repeated by other authors.|$|E
25|$|This {{culminated in}} modern {{probability}} theory, on foundations laid by Andrey Nikolaevich Kolmogorov. Kolmogorov combined {{the notion of}} sample space, introduced by Richard von Mises, and measure theory and presented his axiom system for probability theory in 1933. This became the mostly undisputed axiomatic basis for modern probability theory; but, alternatives exist, such as the adoption of finite rather than countable <b>additivity</b> by Bruno de Finetti.|$|E
25|$|This can be {{the case}} when {{multiple}} genes act in parallel {{to achieve the same}} effect. For example, when an organism is in need of phosphorus, multiple enzymes that break down different phosphorylated components from the environment may act additively {{to increase the amount of}} phosphorus available to the organism. However, there inevitably comes a point where phosphorus is no longer the limiting factor for growth and reproduction and so further improvements in phosphorus metabolism have smaller or no effect (negative epistasis). Some sets of mutations within genes have also been specifically found to be additive. It is now considered that strict <b>additivity</b> is the exception, rather than the rule, since most genes interact with hundreds or thousands of other genes.|$|E
25|$|Schott {{and many}} {{scientists}} and engineers afterwards applied the <b>additivity</b> principle to experimental data measured in their own laboratory within sufficiently narrow composition ranges (local glass models). This is most convenient because disagreements between laboratories and non-linear glass component interactions {{do not need to}} be considered. In the course of several decades of systematic glass research thousands of glass compositions were studied, resulting in millions of published glass properties, collected in glass databases. This huge pool of experimental data was not investigated as a whole, until Bottinga, Kucuk, Priven, Choudhary, Mazurin, and Fluegel published their global glass models, using various approaches. In contrast to the models by Schott the global models consider many independent data sources, making the model estimates more reliable. In addition, global models can reveal and quantify non-additive influences of certain glass component combinations on the properties, such as the mixed-alkali effect as seen in the diagram on the right, or the boron anomaly. Global models also reflect interesting developments of glass property measurement accuracy, e.g., a decreasing accuracy of experimental data in modern scientific literature for some glass properties, shown in the diagram. They can be used for accreditation of new data, experimental procedures, and measurement institutions (glass laboratories). In the following sections (except melting enthalpy) empirical modeling techniques are presented, which seem to be a successful way for handling huge amounts of experimental data. The resulting models are applied in contemporary engineering and research for the calculation of glass properties.|$|E

2500|$|At the {{beginning}} of glass research it was most important to know {{the relation between the}} glass composition and its properties. For this purpose Otto Schott introduced the <b>additivity</b> principle in several publications for calculation of glass properties. This principle implies that the relation between the glass composition and a specific property is linear to all glass component concentrations, assuming an ideal mixture, with Ci and bi representing specific glass component concentrations and related coefficients respectively in the equation below. The <b>additivity</b> principle is a simplification and only valid within narrow composition ranges as seen in the displayed diagrams for the refractive index and the viscosity. Nevertheless, the application of the <b>additivity</b> principle lead the way to many of Schott’s inventions, including optical glasses, glasses with low thermal expansion for cooking and laboratory ware (Duran), and glasses with reduced freezing point depression for mercury thermometers. Subsequently, English and Gehlhoff et al. published similar additive glass property calculation models.
