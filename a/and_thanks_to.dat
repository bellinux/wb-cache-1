5|$|Sport {{has been}} both {{one of the most}} unifying {{cultural}} forces in Northern England <b>and,</b> <b>thanks</b> <b>to</b> local rivalries such as the Lancashire–Yorkshire Roses rivalry, one of the most divisive. As huge numbers of people moved into recently-built cities with little cultural heritage, local sports teams offered the population a sense of place and identity that was otherwise absent.|$|E
5|$|The castle {{was damaged}} during World War II, but efforts {{to restore the}} castle began in the {{immediate}} aftermath of the war.

The 1992–93 NHL season was his most {{successful}} season as he {{played a key role}} in the upset of the Chicago Blackhawks, the reigning Clarence Campbell Conference regular season champions, sweeping them in four games in the first round of the playoffs.

The stonework was carefully repaired, with moulds made to recreate missing pieces. The Inner East Gatehouse was rebuilt, {{along with several}} of the other towers. The marquess carried out landscaping work, {{with the intent of}} eventually re-flooding the lakes, <b>and</b> <b>thanks</b> <b>to</b> several decades of purchases was finally able to demolish the local houses encroaching on the view of the castle.|$|E

5|$|Only Maryland and New York had yet {{to authorize}} {{independence}} {{towards the end of}} June. Previously, Maryland's delegates had walked out when the Continental Congress adopted Adams's radical May 15 preamble, and had sent to the Annapolis Convention for instructions. On May 20, the Annapolis Convention rejected Adams's preamble, instructing its delegates to remain against independence. But Samuel Chase went to Maryland <b>and,</b> <b>thanks</b> <b>to</b> local resolutions in favor of independence, was able to get the Annapolis Convention to change its mind on June 28. Only the New York delegates were unable to get revised instructions. When Congress had been considering the resolution of independence on June 8, the New York Provincial Congress told the delegates to wait. But on June 30, the Provincial Congress evacuated New York as British forces approached, and would not convene again until July 10. This meant that New York's delegates would not be authorized to declare independence until after Congress had made its decision.|$|E
5|$|In Bournemouth's first {{match of}} 2014–15, a 4–0 away win over Huddersfield on 9 August 2014, Pugh opened the scoring after only 26 seconds with a {{composed}} finish from Matt Ritchie's cross. On 25 October 2014, Pugh played as Bournemouth beat Birmingham City 8–0 away {{to set a}} club record win, in which he scored the first hat-trick {{of his career in}} the second half. Pugh and full-back Charlie Daniels formed a partnership on the left-hand side of the pitch during 2014–15, the duo starting all matches but one of a 14-match unbeaten run for Bournemouth. He scored the first goal in a 3–0 win over Bolton Wanderers on 27 April 2015 with a left-footed shot into the top corner; this result all but sealed Bournemouth's promotion into the Premier League. He played in a 3–0 away win against Charlton on 2 May 2015, which confirmed promotion <b>and,</b> <b>thanks</b> <b>to</b> Watford drawing their last match, the Championship title. This was the first time Bournemouth had been promoted into the top flight in the club's 125-year history.
