5|$|The games {{resulting}} from the license were widely criticized, with Hotel Mario being {{regarded as one of}} the worst Mario games and one of the worst video games, due to the animation of the shutting doors, the unresponsive controls <b>and</b> <b>especially</b> <b>for</b> the cutscenes that used full motion video.|$|E
5|$|Conversely, Croatian {{historian}} Davor Marijan {{concluded that}} the battle was too complex for the HV <b>and</b> <b>especially</b> <b>for</b> the HVO. He {{also pointed out that}} the HV and HVO suffered from ineffective command structures and poor intelligence, noting that they had failed to detect the presence of the VRS 16th Motorised and the 1st Armoured Brigades early on. Marijan also claims the HV had demobilised ten infantry brigades shortly before the battle, and his view is supported by Colonel General Novica Simić, commander of the VRS 16th Motorised Brigade, assigned to Tactical Group 1, which had been established by the 1st Krajina Corps to carry out the offensive.|$|E

5|$|Inheriting an Empire on {{the verge}} of disintegration, PedroII turned Portuguese-speaking Brazil into an {{emerging}} power in the international arena. The nation grew to be distinguished from its Hispanic neighbors on account of its political stability, zealously guarded freedom of speech, respect for civil rights, vibrant economic growth <b>and</b> <b>especially</b> <b>for</b> its form of government: a functional, representative parliamentary monarchy. Brazil was also victorious in three international conflicts (the Platine War, the Uruguayan War and the Paraguayan War) under his rule, as well as prevailing in several other international disputes and domestic tensions. PedroII steadfastly pushed through the abolition of slavery despite opposition from powerful political and economic interests. A savant in his own right, the Emperor established a reputation as a vigorous sponsor of learning, culture and the sciences. He won the respect and admiration of scholars such as Charles Darwin, Victor Hugo and Friedrich Nietzsche, and was a friend to Richard Wagner, Louis Pasteur and Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, among others.|$|E
5|$|The best-selling offshoots of {{industrial}} music have been industrial rock and metal; Ministry and Nine Inch Nails both recorded platinum-selling albums. Their success {{led to an}} increase in commercial success for some other industrial musicians; for example, the Nine Inch Nails remix album Further Down the Spiral, which included contributions from Foetus and Coil, was certified gold in 1996. The mid-1990s was a high point for industrial rock, when, in addition to bands that had been around since the 1980s, newer bands such as Gravity Kills, whose self-titled debut sold almost half a million records, had some chart and radio success, <b>and</b> <b>especially</b> <b>for</b> industrial metal, with Marilyn Manson releasing multiple platinum selling albums.|$|E
5|$|When the Empire of Brazil began aiding Uruguay in its {{struggle}} against Argentina, Rosas declared war in August 1851, starting the Platine War. This short conflict ended with Rosas being defeated and absconding to Britain. His last years were spent in exile {{living as a}} tenant farmer {{until his death in}} 1877. Rosas garnered an enduring public perception among Argentines as a brutal tyrant. Since the 1930s, an authoritarian, anti-Semitic, and racist political movement in Argentina called Revisionism has tried to improve Rosas's reputation and establish a new dictatorship in the model of his regime. In 1989, his remains were repatriated by the government in an attempt to promote national unity, seeking forgiveness for him <b>and</b> <b>especially</b> <b>for</b> the 1970s military dictatorship. Rosas remains a controversial figure in Argentina in the 21st century.|$|E
