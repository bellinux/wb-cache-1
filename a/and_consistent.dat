We find that when start-ups fail to raise VC, inconsistent VC feedback {{leads to a}} greater escalation of commitment than <b>consistent</b> <b>and</b> workable VC feedback. We show that single-loop learning mediates the relationship between VC feedback and escalation of commitment. We find that <b>consistent</b> <b>and</b> unworkable VC feedback {{increases the likelihood of}} a firm's exit, and that inhibited double-loop learning mediates the relationship between VC feedback and an exit. ...|$|R

Holland's disregard for procedures governing the safe operation of the B-52 aircraft that he commanded and the absence of firm <b>and</b> <b>consistent</b> corrective action by his superior officers allowed Holland to believe that he could conduct his flight in an unsafe manner, culminating with the slow, steeply banked, 360° turn around the control tower.|$|E
5|$|A complete, {{tenacious}} <b>and</b> <b>consistent</b> two-footed player, Nedvěd frequently {{played as}} a left-sided, offensive wide midfielder or as a left-winger throughout his career, {{due to his}} crossing ability with his left foot, as well as due to his ability to cut inside and shoot with his right foot, although {{he was capable of}} playing anywhere in midfield due to his offensive and defensive work-rate. He was also deployed as a central midfielder on occasion, as well as in an attacking midfield and playmaking role, or as a supporting striker, where he excelled as an assist-man due to his excellent dribbling ability, passing range and vision. Primarily known for his powerful shots and volleys from distance, as well as his stamina, he was also noted for his speed, endurance, technique and goal-scoring ability. He was also an accurate set-piece and penalty kick taker.|$|E

5|$|Bahá'í {{notions of}} {{progressive}} religious revelation result in their accepting {{the validity of}} the well known religions of the world, whose founders and central figures are seen as Manifestations of God. Religious history is interpreted as a series of dispensations, where each manifestation brings a somewhat broader and more advanced revelation that is rendered as a text of scripture and passed on through history with greater or lesser reliability but at least true in substance, suited for the time and place in which it was expressed. Specific religious social teachings (for example, the direction of prayer, or dietary restrictions) may be revoked by a subsequent manifestation so that a more appropriate requirement for the time and place may be established. Conversely, certain general principles (for example, neighbourliness, or charity) are seen to be universal <b>and</b> <b>consistent.</b> In Bahá'í belief, this process of progressive revelation will not end; it is, however, believed to be cyclical. Bahá'ís do not expect a new manifestation of God to appear within 1000 years of Bahá'u'lláh's revelation.|$|E
5|$|In {{the twentieth}} century, Ian Ramsey {{developed}} {{the theory of}} analogy, a development later cited in numerous works by Alister McGrath. He argued that various models of God are provided in religious writings that interact with each other: a range of analogies for salvation {{and the nature of}} God. Ramsey proposed that the models used modify and qualify each other, defining the limits of other analogies. As a result, no one analogy on its own is sufficient, but the combination of every analogy presented in Scripture gives a full <b>and</b> <b>consistent</b> depiction of God. The use of other analogies may then be used to determine if any one model of God is abused or improperly applied.|$|E
5|$|Macartney {{continued}} his rise {{with a more}} productive <b>and</b> <b>consistent</b> second season with both the ball and bat. In his second match in 1906–07, Macartney broke through for his first century, scoring 122 before taking match figures of 4/92 in an innings win over Queensland. In the next match, he took his first five-wicket innings haul, recording figures of 5/18 and 2/17 in an innings win over South Australia, including leading Test batsman Clem Hill twice. Macartney took wickets in each match; he ended the season with 405 runs at 40.50, with two further fifties, and took 30 wickets at 18.20 in nine matches.|$|E

5|$|One {{attempt to}} {{overcome}} these limitations is string theory, a quantum theory not of point particles, but of minute one-dimensional extended objects. The theory {{promises to be a}} unified description of all particles and interactions, including gravity; the price to pay is unusual features such as six extra dimensions of space in addition to the usual three. In what is called the second superstring revolution, it was conjectured that both string theory and a unification of general relativity and supersymmetry known as supergravity form part of a hypothesized eleven-dimensional model known as M-theory, which would constitute a uniquely defined <b>and</b> <b>consistent</b> theory of quantum gravity.|$|E
5|$|The Maya {{writing system}} {{is one of}} the {{outstanding}} achievements of the pre-Columbian inhabitants of the Americas. It was the most sophisticated and highly developed writing system {{of more than a dozen}} systems that developed in Mesoamerica. The earliest inscriptions in an identifiably Maya script date back to 300–200 BC, in the Petén Basin. However, this is preceded by several other Mesoamerican writing systems, such as the Epi-Olmec and Zapotec scripts. Early Maya script had appeared on the Pacific coast of Guatemala by the late 1st century AD, or early 2nd century. Similarities between the Isthmian script and Early Maya script of the Pacific coast suggest that the two systems developed in tandem. By about AD 250, the Maya script had become a more formalized <b>and</b> <b>consistent</b> writing system.|$|E
5|$|The Michiganensian {{described}} the defeat as follows:"There had been {{every reason to}} expect a victory from Chicago.

There was one great difference {{in the character of}} the play of the two teams. Michigan was playing her stock game of football, hard and steady, the game she could have been depended on to play at any time. Chicago seemed to have been trained and nerved to this one game. There could have been little doubt what the result of a series of contests would have been. But this one game, Chicago won by good generalship, by the most advantageous use of her greatest resource – a magnificent player in a telling place.|$|E

5|$|The {{demand for}} {{consistency}} between a quantum description {{of matter and}} a geometric description of spacetime, {{as well as the}} appearance of singularities (where curvature length scales become microscopic), indicate the need for a full theory of quantum gravity: for an adequate description of the interior of black holes, and of the very early universe, a theory is required in which gravity and the associated geometry of spacetime are described in the language of quantum physics. Despite major efforts, no complete <b>and</b> <b>consistent</b> theory of quantum gravity is currently known, even though a number of promising candidates exist.|$|E
5|$|The medieval era Jain logicians Akalanka and Vidyananda, {{who were}} likely contemporaries of Adi Shankara, {{acknowledged}} many issues with anekantavada in their texts. For example, Akalanka in his Pramanasamgraha acknowledges seven problems when anekantavada {{is applied to}} develop a comprehensive <b>and</b> <b>consistent</b> philosophy: dubiety, contradiction, lack of conformity of bases (vaiyadhi karanya), joint fault, infinite regress, intermixture and absence. Vidyananda acknowledged six {{of those in the}} Akalanka list, adding the problem of vyatikara (cross breeding in ideas) and apratipatti (incomprehensibility). Prabhācandra, who probably lived in the 11th-century, and several other later Jain scholars accepted many of these identified issues in anekantavada application.|$|E
5|$|Upon its release, Blackout {{received}} generally favorable {{reviews from}} music critics; some complimented it as Spears' most progressive <b>and</b> <b>consistent</b> album. The Times named {{it as the}} fifth best pop album of the decade. Blackout was originally scheduled to be released on November 13 in the United States, though it was ultimately rush-released after several unauthorized internet leaks.

Consequently, Blackout is distinguished as Spears' first studio album not to debut at number one in the United States, although it was later certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) for exceeding one million shipments. The album charted in within the top ten of several national charts internationally, and has attained several certifications worldwide.|$|E
