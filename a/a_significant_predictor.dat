Furthermore, studies show that women in sororities are almost twice as likely to experience rape than other college women.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} factors that may influence women's choices of whether or not to enter the pool of tenure track faculty, and for those who do pursue these positions, factors that influence their choices of the type of institution in which they will seek employment: research I universities, liberal arts universities, or community colleges. Feminist and role theories guided the conceptual model and research questions. It was hypothesized that career salience, family structure, social support at the familial and department levels, the presence of a faculty role model successfully balancing work and family, and perceived work to family and family to work conflict would influence intended career tracks of female doctoral students. The sample (n= 273) included female doctoral students who were United States citizens at The University of Maryland, College Park who were married, partnered, separated, divorced, widowed, or single with children. A letter explaining the study with a link to an online survey was emailed to all students in this population and completed surveys were compiled on an internet website. This study revealed that career salience was <b>a</b> <b>significant</b> positive <b>predictor</b> of students' intent to pursue research I and liberal arts university tenure track positions, and for women's increased interest throughout their doctoral program in pursuing such faculty positions. Marriage was <b>a</b> <b>significant</b> negative <b>predictor</b> for intent to pursue research I and liberal arts positions, while age and number of children were not <b>significant</b> <b>predictors.</b> Family support was <b>a</b> <b>significant</b> positive <b>predictor</b> for intent to pursue liberal arts positions, and <b>a</b> <b>significant</b> negative <b>predictor</b> for no intent to pursue faculty positions. Department faculty support was <b>a</b> <b>significant</b> negative <b>predictor</b> for career choice change scores for no intent to pursue faculty positions. Advisor support was <b>a</b> <b>significant</b> positive <b>predictor</b> of intent to pursue liberal arts faculty positions, whereas having a faculty role model was <b>a</b> <b>significant</b> negative <b>predictor</b> of no intent to pursue faculty positions. Work to family and family to work conflict were not significant mediating variables in the path between predictor and dependent variables. Implications for program and policy development are discussed...|$|R
25|$|According to this model, {{substance}} abuse problems may arise under two different personality traits: low BIS and high BAS. Since the BAS promotes {{the individual to}} pursue actions that may result in reward, BAS sensitivity {{is involved in the}} initiation of addiction. Significant associations have been found between high BAS such as alcohol misuse in school girls, hazardous drinking in men, illicit drug abuse, and tobacco use. BAS sensitivity is <b>a</b> <b>significant</b> <b>predictor</b> of reactivity to substance cues, or cravings. Conversely, BIS sensitivity is involved in avoiding negative situations or affect (such as withdrawal). Low BIS has been positively associated with continuing the addiction to relieve feelings of withdrawal, or for continued use to alleviate negative affect.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{investigate}} {{the accuracy of}} signal averaged electrocardiography (SAECG) and measurement of microvolt level T wave alternans as predictors of susceptibility to ventricular arrhythmias. DESIGN: Analysis of new data from a previously published prospective investigation. SETTING: Electrophysiology laboratory of a major referral hospital. PATIENTS AND INTERVENTIONS: 43 patients, not on class I or class III antiarrhythmic drug treatment, undergoing invasive electrophysiological testing had SAECG and T wave alternans measurements. The SAECG was considered positive {{in the presence of}} one (SAECG-I) or two (SAECG-II) of three standard criteria. T wave alternans was considered positive if the alternans ratio exceeded 3. 0. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Inducibility of sustained ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation during electrophysiological testing, and 20 month arrhythmia-free survival. RESULTS: The accuracy of T wave alternans in predicting the outcome of electrophysiological testing was 84 % (p < 0. 0001). Neither SAECG-I (accuracy 60 %; p < 0. 29) nor SAECG-II (accuracy 71 %; p < 0. 10) was <b>a</b> statistically <b>significant</b> <b>predictor</b> of electrophysiological testing. SAECG, T wave alternans, electrophysiological testing, and follow up data were available in 36 patients while not on class I or III antiarrhythmic agents. The accuracy of T wave alternans in predicting the outcome of arrhythmia-free survival was 86 % (p < 0. 030). Neither SAECG-I (accuracy 65 %; p < 0. 21) nor SAECG-II (accuracy 71 %; p < 0. 48) was <b>a</b> statistically <b>significant</b> <b>predictor</b> of arrhythmia-free survival. CONCLUSIONS: T wave alternans was <b>a</b> highly <b>significant</b> <b>predictor</b> of the outcome of electrophysiological testing and arrhythmia-free survival, while SAECG was not <b>a</b> statistically <b>significant</b> <b>predictor.</b> Although these results need to be confirmed in prospective clinical studies, they suggest that T wave alternans may serve as a non-invasive probe for screening high risk populations for malignant ventricular arrhythmias...|$|R
