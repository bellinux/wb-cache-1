5|$|On 23 October 1940, the German Military Administration adopted anti-Jewish {{legislation}} {{for the first}} time. The new laws, similar to the Nuremberg Laws adopted in Germany in 1935, coincided with the adoption of similar legislation in the Netherlands and in France. The laws of 28 October forbade Jews to practice certain professions (including the civil service) and forced Jews to register with their local municipality. On the same date, the German administration announced a definition of who was regarded as Jewish. Jewish-owned shops or businesses had to be marked by <b>a</b> <b>sign</b> <b>in</b> the window, and Jewish-owned economic assets had to be registered. From June 1940, a list of Jewish businesses had already been drawn up in Liège.|$|E

Kennedy rented rooms in Lynn in June 1870, and placed <b>a</b> <b>sign</b> <b>in</b> the yard, [...] "Dr. Kennedy"; he was 21 and Eddy 49. The practice became popular.

500|$|The {{building}} is {{adjacent to a}} rail trail, {{and there is a}} [...] bike rack by the building's northern end. The village of New Paltz purchased its section of the former Wallkill Valley rail corridor from Conrail in 1991, formally opening it on October9, 1993 as a public walkway, the Wallkill Valley Rail Trail. The permit allowing La Stazione to operate as a restaurant also required the placement of <b>a</b> <b>sign</b> <b>in</b> the building's parking lot to indicate the presence of the trail. The village allowed La Stazione to place a public picnic table under an overhang by the rail trail, on the condition that the restaurant did not provide outdoor food service. In August 1999, the restaurant was forced to remove a gas tank and gas line that were placed under the trail; failure to do so could have resulted in the revocation of La Stazione's certificate of occupancy, preventing the building from being operated as a restaurant.|$|E
500|$|Merrifield came to {{be known}} as the [...] "father of London's modern archaeology", the {{archaeologist}} Harvey Sheldon describing him as the [...] "father figure" [...] of London archaeology.

Hutton noted further that, [...] "when a top-ranking scholar like Gilchrist expresses concern about an issue, that is <b>a</b> <b>sign</b> <b>in</b> itself that it is emerging into greater prominence." [...] In 2014, the Society for Historical Archaeology's journal Historical Archaeology published an issue mainly comprising papers presented to a symposium held in 2012 in Baltimore, Maryland, USA, on the topic [...] "Manifestations of magic: The archaeology and material culture of folk religion".

500|$|After obtaining guns {{the conspirators}} {{returned}} to Portland, Oregon. They rented out {{an apartment in}} Portland to serve as their base {{of operations for the}} assassination of Turner. Rajneesh follower Carol Matthews (Ma Prem Samadhi) attempted to obtain the home address of Charles Turner, as she was doing research on him and his work in order to find another way of relating to his animosity toward the commune. According to federal prosecutors Matthews obtained a college yearbook of Turner's, and learned his car's license plate number and his parking location. Court records state that Matthews and an unindicted co-conspirator told officials they were conducting [...] "a voter survey", in order to obtain Turner's route number and post office box number. The two tried repeating the story with members of the U.S. Postal Service, but the postal officials did not give them Turner's address. They then drove around Turner's neighborhood and were able to find his home by locating <b>a</b> <b>sign</b> <b>in</b> front of his residence that said [...] "Turner". Matthews had pictures of Turner's residence developed; these were later obtained by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) during an investigation of the Rajneesh commune, and verified after being shown to Turner. The whole process was done in order to try and meet with him to interview and determine what his concerns were, as he refused to meet with anyone at his office.|$|E
500|$|Bluestar's Prophecy was {{released}} on 28 July 2009. It covers Bluestar's life from her birth {{to the beginning of}} Into the Wild. The novel begins on the day of Bluestar's death as she saves Fireheart and ThunderClan from the dog pack, a scene from A Dangerous Path. The novel then returns to when Bluestar was still a kit, Bluekit. Bluekit is apprenticed to Stonepelt as Bluepaw, and proves to be an excellent hunter, catching a squirrel [...] "almost as big as her" [...] on her first day of hunting. The next day, Goosefeather sees <b>a</b> <b>sign</b> <b>in</b> the vole Snowpaw (Bluepaw's sister) brings back to camp and proclaims that ThunderClan must attack WindClan. Later, he tells them that they must destroy WindClan's medicine supply in order to keep them at bay during winter. Pinestar is reluctant but agrees to attack at dawn. Bluepaw and Snowpaw are ordered {{to stay out of the}} fight, but they help Featherwhisker, the medicine cat apprentice, tend to the wounded. During the battle, Bluepaw's mother, Moonflower, destroys WindClan's medicine supplies, but is killed by Hawkheart, the WindClan medicine cat. Bluepaw enters a state of grief which lasts until Sunfall, the deputy and her new mentor since Stonepelt was injured during the WindClan battle and never healed, talks her out of it, telling her that she must honor Moonflower by doing well. She attends the Gathering that night, where she meets and becomes friendly with Crookedpaw and Oakheart of RiverClan.|$|E
500|$|On {{the morning}} of May 26, the Erie Railroad sent a {{statement}} out from Pavonia Terminal in Jersey City, New Jersey to disregard the order from the previous day. The new sign came down instantly and the conductors continued to call the station Turner once again. Old time locals felt the name Turner had more value to them and shouldn't be touched. A self-appointed committee run by the priest proposed a meeting on Saturday, June 4, 1910 at nearby Gillette Hall to protest the name change. The priest also offered that if the name was to remain Turner's, he would contribute $500 towards {{the construction of a}} new station. The post office also said they would remain named Turner even if the signage on the Erie Railroad station went back to the Harriman name. Sometime during the night between June 1 and June 2, the Erie Railroad took the station depot sign for Turner down once again and re-attached the Harriman sign to the station depot. Local resolutions were sent to the Erie showing citizens' displeasure at changing the signage once again. The order from the Erie stated that beginning on July 15, the station name would remain [...] "Harriman" [...] permanently. Father McAran returned to his outrage and continued to go to the press and give interviews on the issue at hand. To wrap the issue up, <b>a</b> <b>sign</b> <b>in</b> the front of the local church proclaiming [...] "LONG LIVE TURNER" [...] was destroyed. This hurt the enthusiasm of locals, who suggested renaming the local Arden station near the Harriman estate instead.|$|E

500|$|After {{numerous}} {{appearances on}} late night comedy shows, Miller {{decided that he}} might have a chance in Hollywood as an actor. Short of money, he signed with the up-and-coming label Smash Records, asked the label for $1,600 in cash in exchange for recording 16 sides. Smash agreed to the proposal, and Miller performed his first session for the company early in 1964, when he recorded the hits [...] "Dang Me" [...] and [...] "Chug-a-Lug". Both were released as singles, peaking at No.1 and No.3 respectively on country charts; both fared well on the Billboard Hot 100 reaching No.7 and No.9. The songs transformed Miller's career, although the former was penned by Miller in just four minutes. Later that year, he recorded the No.15 hit [...] "Do-Wacka-Do," [...] and soon after, the biggest hit of his career [...] "King of the Road", which topped Country and Adult Contemporary charts while peaking at No.4 on the Billboard 100. It also reached No.1 in the UK Singles Chart for one week in May 1965. The song was inspired by <b>a</b> <b>sign</b> <b>in</b> Chicago that read [...] "Trailers for Sale or Rent" [...] and a hobo who happened upon Miller at an airport in Boise, but [...] Miller needed months to write the song, which was certified gold in May 1965 after selling a million copies. It won numerous awards and earned a royalty check of $160,000 that summer. [...] Later in the year Miller scored hits with [...] "Engine Engine No.9", [...] "Kansas City Star" [...] (a Top Ten country hit in 1965 about a local television children's show personality who would rather stay in the safety and security of his success in Kansas City than become a bigger star – or risk failure – in Omaha), and [...] "England Swings" [...] (an adult contemporary No.1).
