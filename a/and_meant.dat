5|$|Brax {{said that}} {{personal}} data protection legislation needed to be adjusted to allow a freer access to information among professionals. She said that this had impeded {{the investigation into the}} Jokela incident, <b>and</b> <b>meant</b> that people in the teaching profession were left unable to help students to some degree.|$|E
5|$|During the 1950s and 1960s {{the college}} {{expanded}} through developments at Owengate and Bailey Court, both around Palace Green. In the 1970s, the college sold Lumley Castle. The proceeds {{were used to}} fund the development of Moatside Court, <b>and</b> <b>meant</b> that all the college's students were now housed within five minutes of the main castle. During this period there was rapid change in the size {{and structure of the}} college, which expanded to over 300undergraduates by 1979.|$|E
5|$|During the interwar period, Belgium {{had created}} a gold-based currency, called the Belga, which ran {{parallel}} to the Belgian franc. The Belga was intended for international trading <b>and</b> <b>meant</b> that the National Bank of Belgium amassed considerable gold reserves, amounting to some 600 tonnes by 1940.|$|E
5000|$|Goldberg {{described}} {{the issue of}} being white and involved with the armed struggle as follows: [...] "Being black and involved (in the struggle) meant you {{had the support of}} many people <b>and</b> it <b>meant</b> you got {{to be part of a}} community.

50|$|In 1896, Zonia Baber {{designed}} {{a new school}} desk with features specifically for the teaching of geography and other sciences. Unlike a regular school desk, Zonia's featured trays <b>and</b> compartments <b>meant</b> to store learning supplies. Having these trays <b>and</b> compartments <b>meant</b> that students using her desk would always have their learning supplies at hand.|$|R
5|$|Meanwhile, the United States began {{holding an}} annual {{national}} competition—the USA Outdoor Track and Field Championships—first held in 1876 by the New York Athletic Club. The establishment of general sports governing bodies for the United States (the Amateur Athletic Union in 1888) and France (the Union des sociétés françaises de sports athlétiques in 1889) put the sport on a formal footing <b>and</b> <b>meant</b> that international competitions became possible.|$|E
5|$|Rise (also {{known as}} Beyoncé Rise) is a perfume {{endorsed}} by Beyoncé and distributed through division Coty Beauty of manufacturer Coty, Inc. She collaborated with perfumer Loc Dong {{from the company}} International Flavors & Fragrances (IFF) for creating the scent. It marks her third fragrance following the release of Heat (2010) and Pulse (2011). Inspired by African-American author Maya Angelou <b>and</b> <b>meant</b> to showcase private sides of Beyoncé's personal life, Rise was created as a woman's fragrance.|$|E
5|$|Unlike most {{livestock}} farming in England at this time, the duck breeders and duck rearers of Aylesbury formed two separate groups. Stock ducks—i.e., ducks kept for breeding—were kept on {{farms in the}} countryside of the Aylesbury Vale, away from the polluted air and water of the town. This kept the ducks healthy, <b>and</b> <b>meant</b> a higher number of fertile eggs.|$|E

5000|$|The word [...] "Wyrley" [...] {{derives from}} two Old English words: wir <b>and</b> leah. Wir <b>meant</b> [...] "bog myrtle" [...] <b>and</b> leah <b>meant</b> [...] "woodland clearing", {{suggesting}} that Great Wyrley began as sparse woodland or marshland. [...] "Great" [...] refers to its dominant size over Little Wyrley.|$|R
5|$|Albert Balink, a Dutch journalist, {{began work}} on {{what was to become}} Pareh in 1934. Unlike The Teng Chun, the inexperienced Balink chose to target his film at Dutch audiences. He brought in two of the Wong brothers, Chinese filmmakers who had been {{inactive}} since making Zuster Theresia (Sister Theresa) in 1932. The Wongs donated their studio– an old tapioca flour factory– as well as filmmaking equipment. Meanwhile, much of the funding came from other backers. According to the Indonesian film historian Misbach Yusa Biran, the money came from the cinema mogul Buse, while EYE Film Institute records indicate that the film was backed by the Centrale Commissie voor Emigratie en Kolonisatie van Inheemschen <b>and</b> <b>meant</b> to promote migration from Java to Sumatra.|$|E
5|$|Another {{factor in}} the Mellotron's sound is that the {{individual}} notes were recorded in isolation. For a musician accustomed to playing in an orchestral setting, this was unusual, <b>and</b> <b>meant</b> that they had nothing against which to intonate. Noted cellist Reginald Kirby refused to downtune his cello to cover the lower range of the Mellotron, and so the bottom notes are actually performed on a double bass. According to Mellotron author Nick Awde, one note of the string sounds contains {{the sound of a}} chair being scraped in the background.|$|E
5|$|Cody Rhodes was a World Tag Team Champion {{throughout}} {{the beginning of}} 2008 alongside Hardcore Holly, who was acting as a mentor to him. Ted DiBiase made his first WWE appearance on the May 26 episode of Raw, in which he claimed that he and a mystery partner would take the World Tag Team Championship from Rhodes and Holly. At the Night of Champions pay-per-view event in June, DiBiase revealed his partner was running late and started the match without him, however Rhodes quickly betrayed Hardcore Holly by attacking him. This turned Rhodes into a villainous character <b>and</b> <b>meant</b> that he and DiBiase won the championship.|$|E

5|$|Exceptionally heavy {{rainfall}} in November 2012 caused a major {{break in the}} Grand Western Canal's banks, near Halberton, necessitating nearby homes to be evacuated. Two temporary dams were installed which allowed {{the rest of the}} canal to remain open <b>and</b> <b>meant</b> the horse drawn barge at Tiverton was able to run throughout the summer of 2013. Around 400 fish were returned to the canal from a flooded field but many fish including pike, eels, perch, bream, tench and roach were lost. About 25 people from the Environment Agency and Tiverton Angling Club assisted with saving the fish. The Environment Agency restocked the canal with 3,000 fish in January 2013 and by May the Environment Agency said they were flourishing.|$|E
5|$|The {{modifications}} {{are attributed}} to Maunsell’s Chief Draughtsman James Clayton, who had transferred to Ashford railway works in 1914 from Derby works. They {{were the result of}} cooperation between the South Eastern and Chatham Railway (SECR) and the Great Western Railway (GWR) when Maunsell was seconded to the Railway Executive Committee during the First World War. The aim was to create a series of standard freight and passenger locomotives for use throughout Britain, <b>and</b> <b>meant</b> that Clayton was privy to the latest GWR developments in steam design. These included streamlined steam passages, long-travel valves, the maximisation of power through reduced cylinder sizes and higher boiler pressure.|$|E
5|$|The problem {{occurred}} {{because of the}} way the vehicles were modified for right-hand-drive. The investigation showed that although the brake pedal had been moved to the right, it was still connected to a mechanism on the passenger side. This was covered by felt carpet <b>and</b> <b>meant</b> that both the front passenger and driver could activate the brakes. A further investigation by Watchdog later found the same problem in other Citroën models and some vehicles produced by Renault and Peugeot, some of which were registered in 2002. All three manufacturers worked with the Vehicle and Operator Services Agency (VOSA) to identify the severity of the problem but no vehicles were found to be affected enough to issue recalls.|$|E

5000|$|Legalism - Literally means “school of law”. This {{philosophy}} {{had three}} subjects: fa, shu, <b>and</b> shi. Fa <b>meant</b> “law or principle” {{and the law}} code must be clearly written and made public. Laws should reward those who obey them and punish those who break them. Shu meant “method, tactic or art” <b>and</b> this <b>meant</b> that secrets were to be employed by the ruler so others cannot {{take control of the}} dynasty. Shi meant “legitimacy, power, or charisma” <b>and</b> this <b>meant</b> that the position of the ruler was what held power. In the novel, the Duke of Ch'in espouses this philosophy.|$|R
5|$|A {{key element}} of the {{gameplay}} is its focus on guns over swords and magic. When deciding upon the game's basics, the team {{wanted to create a}} cinematic feeling in battles. If they had gone with a more traditional battle system, then it would have quickly lost its cinematic quality due to the prevalence of close combat. Likewise, they wanted the cinematic feel to persist throughout the whole game rather than restricted to cutscenes. A major challenge was {{to strike a balance between}} accessibility and difficulty when developing for a player base that might be made of up of both action game and RPG players. This resulted in the addition of strategy elements. Another wish was to create something new and fresh in the RPG market. When creating the gameplay style, the team looked at action movies such as The Matrix and Rebellion during their research. Despite its fast-paced action, the game relies heavily upon strategic, turn-based gameplay. During early development, the game was based on a real-time system <b>and</b> <b>meant</b> for only one character to be controlled by the player; the other two would have been handled by the game's artificial intelligence (AI). After some testing, they decided that this would create unwanted difficulties in gameplay such as characters dying off-screen without the player noticing or the AI not directing them properly.|$|E
5|$|Coulter's plan {{to attack}} on August 28 {{had to be}} postponed. Brigadier General Kim Hong Il, the ROK I Corps commander, {{told him he could}} not attack, that there were too many {{casualties}} and the South Korean were exhausted. The NK 5th Division above P'ohang-dong had begun to press south again and the ROK 3rd Division in front of it began to show signs of pulling back. On the 28th, the KMAG adviser to the ROK 3rd Division and Brigadier General Kim Suk Won clashed over whether the division should retreat or attack. That day, August 28, Walker issued a special statement addressed to the ROK Army, <b>and</b> <b>meant</b> also for the South Korean Minister of Defense, Shin Sung-mo. He called on the ROK troops to hold their lines in the Pusan Perimeter, and implored the rest of the UN troops to defend their ground as firmly as possible, counterattacking as necessary to prevent the North Koreans from consolidating their gains.|$|E

On the 28th, the KMAG adviser to the ROK 3rd Division, at a time he deemed favorable, advised South Korean Brigadier General Kim Suk Won, the division commander, to counterattack, but Kim refused to do so. The next day Kim {{said he was going to}} move his command post out of P'ohang-dong. The KMAG adviser replied that the KMAG group was going to stay in P'ohang-dong. Upon hearing that, Kim became hysterical but decided to stay for the time being to avoid loss of face.

5|$|During the 2006–07 season, manager Colin Todd {{had been}} sacked {{because of a}} poor run of results. Club captain David Wetherall was {{originally}} appointed Todd's successor on a caretaker basis, before being handed the role {{until the end of}} the season, during the following month. Wetherall could not stop City's run of poor form, and the club were relegated to League Two on 28 April 2007 after a 3–0 defeat at Chesterfield. It was the club's third relegation in seven seasons, <b>and</b> <b>meant</b> the 2007–08 season would be their first season in the fourth division of English football in 25years. On 22 May 2007, former City player Stuart McCall, who had played more than 400games for the club during two previous spells, was announced as the club's new manager to take over on 1 June 2007. Although the club had just 13players with first-team experience, the bookmakers made City second favourites to win the League Two title.|$|E
5|$|Especially {{important}} was the fishing and trade in herring and cod in the Atlantic and the Baltic Sea. The herring was of unprecedented significance to the economy of much of Northern Europe, {{and it was one}} of the most common commodities traded by the Hanseatic League, a powerful north German alliance of trading guilds. Kippers made from herring caught in the North Sea could be found in markets as far away as Constantinople. While large quantities of fish were eaten fresh, a large proportion was salted, dried, and, to a lesser extent, smoked. Stockfish, cod that was split down the middle, fixed to a pole and dried, was very common, though preparation could be time-consuming, <b>and</b> <b>meant</b> beating the dried fish with a mallet before soaking it in water. A wide range of mollusks including oysters, mussels and scallops were eaten by coastal and river-dwelling populations, and freshwater crayfish were seen as a desirable alternative to meat during fish days. Compared to meat, fish was much more expensive for inland populations, especially in Central Europe, and therefore not an option for most. Freshwater fish such as pike, carp, bream, perch, lamprey and trout were common.|$|E
5|$|In {{the medieval}} or post-medieval period, {{the remains of}} the hillfort were used as a rabbit warren which was used to breed rabbits, {{providing}} valuable meat and fur. Many warrens were surrounded by banks or walls to prevent the rabbits from escaping; escaped rabbits caused damage to nearby farmland <b>and</b> <b>meant</b> a loss in profit. The warren at Dolebury is completely enclosed by the substantial ramparts of the Iron Age hill fort and thus provided an ideal location to breed rabbits. The presence of pillow mounds and vermin traps demonstrate man's management of the site for husbandry. Ridge and furrow agriculture has also been identified, from aerial photographs, within the fort. Some of these structures, along with earlier Iron Age features, have been damaged by subsequent quarrying which may have been for lead, ochre or calamine. The site was described by John Leland in the 16th century. A three-storey building, believed to be the warrener's house and possibly a watch tower, surrounded by a garden, was in ruins by 1830.|$|E
