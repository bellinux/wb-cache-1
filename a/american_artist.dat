40|$|This article {{investigates the}} extent to which {{economic}} markets have incorpo-rated mainstream artistic acceptance of African American art. Prices of oil paintings sold at auction from 1972 to 2004 for African <b>American</b> <b>artists</b> are compared to their contemporaries. Gross means between the two groups reveal averages significantly lower for African <b>American</b> <b>artists</b> throughout the time period. Hedonic regressions, used to refine the statistical analysis by controlling for factors characterizing the painting and auction environment, also reveal that African <b>American</b> <b>artists</b> fetch lower prices. The hedonic regressions, however, reveal a narrowing gap between the two groups since price appreciation has been higher for works by African <b>American</b> <b>artists.</b> The high investment returns have made investment in paintings by African <b>American</b> <b>artists</b> a relatively profitable niche in recent years comparing well with traditional investments such as stocks and bonds. This profitability may continue since painting prices for African Americans have not completely caught up to those of contemporaries...|$|R
