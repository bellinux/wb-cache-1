25|$|Standing {{in a large}} atrium, Roberts {{first opened}} fire at the mall's food court that was across from him at his left. The first to be shot was 54-year-old shopper Cindy Ann Yuille, a hospice nurse {{and mother of two}} who was shot in the back; she died despite efforts of {{bystanders}} to treat her wound. 15-year-old Kristina Shevchenko, who was walking through the mall with her friend to reach the Town Center MAX station, was the second person to be shot; she received a bullet to the chest, but she survived and made it out of the mall, where she was treated for her gunshot wound.

25|$|Papen was {{a member}} of the highly {{exclusive}} Deutscher Herrenklub (German Gentlemen's Club) of Arthur Moeller van den Bruck. Papen, a man completely unknown to the general public, was well known in elite circles in Berlin for his sense of style which together with his colorful and much embellished recounting of his adventures in Mexico, the United States, Canada, Flanders, France and the Ottoman Empire in the World War and his capacity to tell a seemingly endless number of jokes all combined to make a much sought after dinner guest among the elite. Most people knew that the more fanciful exploits Papen described were exaggerations, if not fabrications, but Papen was such an entertaining raconteur who excelled at light conversation that few cared. At the Deutscher Herrenklub, Papen would spend hours drinking <b>and</b> <b>talking</b> <b>with</b> his best friend General Kurt von Schleicher who enjoyed his company. Schleicher and his friends liked to call Papen Fränzchen, a somewhat disparaging diminutive of his name Franz, but the French ambassador André François-Poncet who also a member of the Herrenklub noted:"Papen sometimes served as the butt of their jokes; they enjoyed making fun of and teasing him, without him taking the least offense".|$|E

500|$|Rathborne {{chose to}} open the episode with a shot {{centered}} on Sherilyn Fenn, finding the actress to be [...] "seductive" [...] and [...] "absorbing" [...] {{in a similar manner}} to screen icon Marilyn Monroe. Rathborne had initially worried that the episode featured too many static scenes of characters sitting <b>and</b> <b>talking,</b> <b>with</b> little action, and asked Lynch if she could borrow some of the imagery of the previous episode's surreal dream sequence to keep these conversations more interesting, adding brief snippets of footage as Cooper discussed the dream with the others. Rathborne has noted that this dream-centric approach to the character of Cooper is rooted in Carl Jung's theories of analytical psychology. She felt this was something that had not been seen on television before, and credits Lynch with introducing it to the series. She has also described the narrative, both of [...] "Episode 3" [...] and of Twin Peaks as a whole, as a [...] "Bildungsroman" [...] showing Cooper's development into a more rounded and enlightened person.|$|E

2500|$|When he {{was chosen}} as future speaker in 2005, Rubio {{delivered}} {{a speech to the}} House in which he asked members to look in their desks, where they each found a hardcover book titled 100 Innovative Ideas For Florida’s Future; but the book was intentionally blank, because it had not yet been written, and Rubio told his colleagues that they would fill in the pages together with the help of ordinary Floridians. In 2006, after traveling around the state <b>and</b> <b>talking</b> <b>with</b> citizens, and compiling their ideas, Rubio published the book. The National Journal called this book [...] "the centerpiece of Rubio’s early speakership". [...] About 24 of the [...] "ideas" [...] became law, while another 10 were partially enacted. Among the items from his 2006 book that became law were multiple-year car registrations, a requirement that high schools provide more vocational courses, and an expanded voucher-like school-choice program. [...] Rubio's defenders, and even some critics, point out that nationwide economic difficulties overlapped with much of Rubio's speakership, and so funding new legislative proposals became difficult.|$|E

2500|$|Among {{his many}} philanthropic efforts, the {{establishment}} of public libraries throughout the United States, Britain, Canada and other English-speaking countries was especially prominent. In this special driving interest and project of his he {{was inspired by a}} visit and tour he made with Enoch Pratt (1808–1896), formerly of Massachusetts but who made his fortune in Baltimore and ran his various mercantile and financial businesses very thriftily. Pratt in turn had been inspired and helped by his friend and fellow Bay Stater, George Peabody, (1795–1869) who also had made his fortune in the [...] "Monumental City" [...] of Baltimore before moving to New York and London to expand his empire as the richest man in America before the Civil War. Later he too endowed several institutions, schools, libraries and foundations in his home commonwealth, and also in Baltimore with his Peabody Institute in 1857, completed in 1866, with added library wings a decade later and several educational foundations throughout the Old South. Several decades later, Carnegie's visit with Mr. Pratt lasted for several days; resting and dining in his city mansion, then touring, visiting <b>and</b> <b>talking</b> <b>with</b> staff and ordinary citizen patrons of the newly established Enoch Pratt Free Library (1886) impressed the Scotsman deeply – years later he was always heard to proclaim that [...] "Pratt was my guide and inspiration".|$|E

[...] Dylan had moved to New York City to go to art school while Miller had started his own band called the 45's.

2500|$|In the 1980s, VFP opposed US-sponsored wars in Central America. On Easter Sunday, Apr 19, 1987, VFP members {{marched on}} President Reagan's Western White House in California, and Vice President Bush's {{vacation}} home in Kennebunkport, Maine, protesting U.S. intervention in Central America. From May 4–18, 1987, sixteen members of VFP representing eight states traveled through Guatemala, Honduras and Nicaragua conducting site visits {{and interviews with}} high level government, military, religious and private sector elders, <b>and</b> <b>talking</b> <b>with</b> many average citizens. Following their return, they published a 40-page delegation report that was distributed to 5,000 opinion leaders in the United States including members of the U.S. Senate and House of Representatives, the heads of many government offices and agencies, church, labor, and educational leaders, and media pace setters. In 1988, many VFP members participated in the Veterans Peace Convoy which was intended to truck medical and humanitarian aid to the suffering children of Nicaragua. Though the convoy was stopped by U.S. Customs and Treasury officials in Texas at the Laredo border checkpoint, on June 15, 1988, the vehicles were off-loaded into containers at a Texas port facility and about 95% of the cargo reached its destination in Nicaragua. In July 1988, VFP member Joe Ryan, an environmental scientist, of Tallahassee, Florida, established VFP's Nicaragua Environmental Science Project. Ryan spent two years working in Nicaragua training pollution control teams how to correct water contamination problems. The project was credited with significantly reducing the nation's infant mortality rate. Also in July 1988, VFP member Randy Parent of Caribou, Maine, drove a truckload of smelting and casting equipment to Guatemala where he established the Pro-Tierra Machine Tool Project to train members of several indigenous tribes how to make farm tools for the 100,000 members of the Pro-Tierra land reform movement. [...] VFP regularly sends election observers to Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua and El Salvador.|$|E
