25|$|<b>Aromatase</b> inhibitors {{have been}} used {{experimentally}} to reduce fibroids. The effect {{is believed to be}} due partially by lowering systemic estrogen levels and partially by inhibiting locally overexpressed <b>aromatase</b> in fibroids. However, fibroid growth has recurred after treatment was stopped. Experience from experimental <b>aromatase</b> inhibitor treatment of endometriosis indicates that <b>aromatase</b> inhibitors might be particularly useful in combination with a progestogenic ovulation inhibitor.|$|E
25|$|Estrogens are {{implicated in}} various estrogen-dependent {{conditions}}, such as ER-positive breast cancer, {{as well as}} a number of genetic conditions involving estrogen signaling or metabolism, such as estrogen insensitivity syndrome, <b>aromatase</b> deficiency, and <b>aromatase</b> excess syndrome.|$|E
25|$|Spironolactone {{has been}} found not to have {{activity}} as an <b>aromatase</b> inhibitor.|$|E
25|$|CYP19A (P450arom, <b>aromatase)</b> in {{endoplasmic}} reticulum of gonads, brain, adipose tissue, and elsewhere catalyzes aromatization of androgens to estrogens.|$|E
25|$|<b>Aromatase</b> inhibitors are {{typically}} given to postmenopausal women {{to lower the}} amount of bioavailable estrogen in their systems.|$|E
25|$|Adipose {{tissue is}} the {{greatest}} peripheral source of <b>aromatase</b> in both males and females, contributing {{to the production of}} estradiol.|$|E
25|$|As men age, the enzymes <b>aromatase</b> and 5-alpha reductase {{increase}} in activity. <b>Aromatase</b> and 5-alpha reductase {{are responsible for}} converting androgen hormones into estrogen and dihydrotestosterone, respectively. This metabolism of androgen hormones leads to a decrease in testosterone but raised levels of DHT and estrogen. Estrogen has {{a key role in}} the growth of cells in the prostate and DHT is an anabolic hormone many times more potent than testosterone that when combined, cause a synergy to induce BPH.|$|E
25|$|Several drugs induce hypogonadism, {{for example}} <b>aromatase</b> inhibitors used in breast cancer, {{methotrexate}} and other antimetabolite drugs, depot progesterone and gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonists.|$|E
25|$|Compulsions in male lab mice, such {{as those}} in {{obsessive-compulsive}} disorder (OCD), may be caused by low estrogen levels. When estrogen levels were raised through the increased activity of the enzyme <b>aromatase</b> in male lab mice, OCD rituals were dramatically decreased. Hypothalamic protein levels in the gene COMT are enhanced by increasing estrogen levels which are believed to return mice that displayed OCD rituals to normal activity. <b>Aromatase</b> deficiency is ultimately suspected which is involved in the synthesis of estrogen in humans and has therapeutic implications in humans having obsessive-compulsive disorder.|$|E
25|$|In {{those who}} have not yet {{undergone}} or completed epiphyseal closure, growth hormone can be administered, potentially in conjunction with an <b>aromatase</b> inhibitor or a GnRH analogue, to increase final height.|$|E
25|$|N,N-Didesmethyl-4-hydroxytamoxifen (norendoxifen), another active {{metabolite}} of tamoxifen, {{has been}} found to act as a potent competitive <b>aromatase</b> inhibitor (IC50 = 90 nM), and may also be involved in its antiestrogenic activity.|$|E
25|$|NET and {{its major}} active {{metabolite}} 5α-DHNET {{have been found}} to act as irreversible <b>aromatase</b> inhibitors (Ki = 1.7μM and 9.0μM, respectively). However, like the case of 5α-reductase, the concentrations required are probably too high to be clinically relevant at typical dosages. 5α-DHNET specifically has been assessed and found to be selective in its inhibition of <b>aromatase,</b> and does not affect cholesterol side-chain cleavage enzyme (P450scc), 17α-hydroxylase/17,20-lyase, 21-hydroxylase, or 11β-hydroxylase. Since it is not aromatized (and hence cannot be transformed into an estrogenic metabolite), unlike NET, 5α-DHNET has been proposed as a potential therapeutic agent in the treatment of ER-positive breast cancer.|$|E
25|$|In {{recent years}} some newer {{approaches}} to optimizing growth have been researched and {{are beginning to}} be used. It is possible to reduce the effects of androgens on the body by blocking the receptors with an antiandrogen such as flutamide and by reducing the conversion of testosterone to estradiol. This conversion is mediated by <b>aromatase</b> and can be inhibited by <b>aromatase</b> blockers such as testolactone. Blocking the effects and conversions of estrogens will allow use of lower doses of glucocorticoids with less risk of acceleration of bone maturation. Other proposed interventions have included bilateral adrenalectomy to remove the androgen sources, or growth hormone treatment to enhance growth.|$|E
25|$|As {{outlined}} above, recent {{additions to}} treatment to preserve growth include <b>aromatase</b> inhibition to slow bone maturation {{by reducing the}} amount of testosterone converted to estradiol, and use of blockers of estrogen for the same purpose.|$|E
25|$|Tamoxifen-treated {{breast cancer}} {{patients}} show evidence of reduced cognition, a major side effect of tamoxifen, and semantic memory scores. However memory impairment in patients treated with tamoxifen was less severe compared with those treated with anastrozole (an <b>aromatase</b> inhibitor).|$|E
25|$|Another line of {{research}} has focused on the proximate effects of circulating testosterone on the nervous system, as mediated by local metabolism within the brain. Testosterone can be metabolized to 17b-estradiol by the enzyme <b>aromatase,</b> or to 5-alpha-dihydrotestosterone (DHT) by 5a-reductase.|$|E
25|$|Adipose tissue {{possesses}} <b>aromatase,</b> {{an enzyme}} that converts androstenedione to estrone and testosterone to estradiol. The excess of adipose tissue in obese women creates {{the paradox of}} having both excess androgens (which are responsible for hirsutism and virilization) and estrogens (which inhibits FSH via negative feedback).|$|E
25|$|Various other diseases, invoked as {{possible}} explanations to his early demise, included Marfan syndrome, Wilson-Turner X-linked mental retardation syndrome, Fröhlich syndrome (adiposogenital dystrophy), Klinefelter syndrome, androgen insensitivity syndrome, <b>aromatase</b> excess syndrome {{in conjunction with}} sagittal craniosynostosis syndrome, Antley–Bixler syndrome or one of its variants, and temporal lobe epilepsy.|$|E
25|$|<b>Aromatase</b> {{is highly}} {{expressed}} in regions {{involved in the}} regulation of aggressive behavior, such as the amygdala and hypothalamus. In studies using genetic knock-out techniques in inbred mice, male mice that lacked a functional <b>aromatase</b> enzyme displayed a marked reduction in aggression. Long-term treatment with estradiol partially restored aggressive behavior, suggesting that the neural conversion of circulating testosterone to estradiol {{and its effect on}} estrogen receptors influences inter-male aggression. In addition, two different estrogen receptors, ERa and ERb, have been identified as having the ability to exert different effects on aggression in mice. However, the effect of estradiol appears to vary depending on the strain of mouse, and in some strains it reduces aggression during long days (16 h of light), while during short days (8 h of light) estradiol rapidly increases aggression.|$|E
25|$|Aside from 5α-reductase, <b>aromatase</b> may {{inactivate}} testosterone signaling in {{skeletal muscle}} and adipose tissue, so AAS that lack <b>aromatase</b> affinity, {{in addition to}} being free of the potential side effect of gynecomastia, might be expected to have a higher myotrophic-androgenic ratio in comparison. In addition, DHT is inactivated by high activity of 3α-HSD in skeletal muscle (and cardiac tissue), and AAS that lack affinity for 3α-HSD could similarly be expected to have a higher myotrophic-androgenic ratio (although perhaps also increased long-term cardiovascular risks). In accordance, DHT, mesterolone (1α-methyl-DHT), and mestanolone (17α-methyl-DHT) are all described as very poorly anabolic due to inactivation by 3α-HSD in skeletal muscle, whereas other DHT derivatives like oxandrolone, oxymetholone, drostanolone, and stanozolol are all poor substrates for 3α-HSD and are described as potent anabolics.|$|E
25|$|Testosterone is metabolized {{in various}} tissues by 5α-reductase into DHT, which is 3- to 10-fold more potent as an AR agonist, and by <b>aromatase</b> into estradiol, {{which is an}} {{estrogen}} and lacks significant AR affinity. In addition, DHT is metabolized by 3α-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (3α-HSD) and 3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (3β-HSD) into 3α-androstanediol and 3β-androstanediol, respectively, which are metabolites {{with little or no}} AR affinity. 5α-Reductase is widely distributed throughout the body, and is concentrated to various extents in skin (particularly the scalp, beard-area of the face, pubic area, and genital area (penis and scrotum)), prostate, seminal vesicles, liver, and the brain. In contrast, expression of 5α-reductase in skeletal muscle is undetectable. <b>Aromatase</b> is highly expressed in adipose tissue and the brain, and is also expressed significantly in skeletal muscle. 3α-HSD is also highly expressed in skeletal muscle.|$|E
25|$|The {{effect of}} {{estradiol}} (and estrogens in general) upon male reproduction is complex. Estradiol {{is produced by}} action of <b>aromatase</b> mainly in the Leydig cells of the mammalian testis, but also by some germ cells and the Sertoli cells of immature mammals. It functions (in vitro) to prevent apoptosis of male sperm cells.|$|E
25|$|Researches on the ovine sexually dimorphic nucleus (oSDN) in sheep {{demonstrate}} that the volume of oSDN varies with sexual partner preference in male sheep (rams). Homosexual rams (roughly 8% of the population) {{have been found to}} have oSDNs that are about half the size of those in heterosexual rams. In one study conducted by Roselli, et al., 4 heterosexual rams and 9 homosexual rams were exposed to 2 estrous ewes and 2 rams, with their sexual behaviors (mounts and ejaculations) being recorded. Heterosexual rams displayed significantly more mounts and ejaculations with ewes than with stimulus rams, whereas homosexual rams showed the opposite. Then series of brain sections, including hypothalamic, temporal lobe and diencephalon tissues, were imaged. Also, in situ hybridization was conducted to examine the level of the expression of cytochrome P450 <b>aromatase</b> in these brain sections. The results showed that the volume of oSDN in heterosexual rams is approximately 2 times greater than that in homosexual rams. The number of neurons within oSDN is significantly greater in homosexual rams than in heterosexual rams, so it is with the mean length of the oSDN. But the neuron density is similar in both kinds of rams. In addition, <b>aromatase</b> mRNA levels are also tested, showing that the level of <b>aromatase</b> mRNA is significantly greater in heterosexual rams than in homosexual rams.|$|E
25|$|Ketoconazole is a {{racemic mixture}} {{consisting}} of cis-(2S,4R)-(−) and cis-(2R,4S)-(+) enantiomers. The cis-(2S,4R) isomer was more potent in inhibiting progesterone 17α,20-lyase than its enantiomer (IC50 values of 0.05 and 2.38 μM, respectively) and in inhibiting 11β-hydroxylase (IC50 values of 0.152 and 0.608 μM, respectively). Both isomers were relatively weak inhibitors of human placental <b>aromatase.</b>|$|E
25|$|Two of the {{immediate}} metabolites of testosterone, 5α-DHT and estradiol, are biologically important and can be formed both in the liver and in extrahepatic tissues. Approximately 5 to 7% of testosterone is converted by 5α-reductase into 5α-DHT, with circulating levels of 5α-DHT about 10% of those of testosterone, and approximately 0.3% of testosterone is converted into estradiol by <b>aromatase.</b> 5α-Reductase is highly expressed in the male reproductive organs (including the prostate gland, seminal vesicles, and epididymides), skin, hair follicles, and brain and <b>aromatase</b> is highly expressed in adipose tissue, bone, and the brain. As much as 90% of testosterone is converted into 5α-DHT in so-called androgenic tissues with high 5α-reductase expression, and due to the several-fold greater potency of 5α-DHT as an AR agonist relative to testosterone, {{it has been estimated}} that the effects of testosterone are potentiated 2- to 3-fold in such tissues.|$|E
25|$|The {{brain is}} also {{affected}} by this sexual differentiation; the enzyme <b>aromatase</b> converts testosterone into estradiol {{that is responsible for}} masculinization of the brain in male mice. In humans, masculinization of the fetal brain appears, by observation of gender preference in patients with congenital diseases of androgen formation or androgen receptor function, to be associated with functional androgen receptors.|$|E
25|$|In females, {{synthesis}} of estrogens starts in theca interna {{cells in the}} ovary, by the {{synthesis of}} androstenedione from cholesterol. Androstenedione is a substance of weak androgenic activity which serves predominantly as a precursor for more potent androgens such as testosterone as well as estrogen. This compound crosses the basal membrane into the surrounding granulosa cells, where it is converted either immediately into estrone, or into testosterone and then estradiol in an additional step. The conversion of androstenedione to testosterone is catalyzed by 17β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (17β-HSD), whereas the conversion of androstenedione and testosterone into estrone and estradiol, respectively is catalyzed by <b>aromatase,</b> enzymes which are both expressed in granulosa cells. In contrast, granulosa cells lack 17α-hydroxylase and 17,20-lyase, whereas theca cells express these enzymes and 17β-HSD but lack <b>aromatase.</b> Hence, both granulosa and theca cells are essential {{for the production of}} estrogen in the ovaries.|$|E
25|$|Other {{endogenous}} estrogens, the biosyntheses {{of which}} do not involve <b>aromatase,</b> include 27-hydroxycholesterol, dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), 7-oxo-DHEA, 7α-hydroxy-DHEA, 16α-hydroxy-DHEA, 7β-hydroxyepiandrosterone, androstenedione (A4), androstenediol (A5), 3α-androstanediol, and 3β-androstanediol, and may have important endogenous functions as estrogens. Some estrogen metabolites, such as the catechol estrogens 2-hydroxyestradiol, 2-hydroxyestrone, 4-hydroxyestradiol, and 4-hydroxyestrone, as well as 16α-hydroxyestrone, are also estrogens {{with varying degrees of}} activity.|$|E
25|$|Estradiol, {{like other}} steroids, {{is derived from}} cholesterol. After side chain {{cleavage}} and using the Δ5 or the Δ4- pathway, Δ4-androstenedione is the key intermediary. A portion of the Δ4-androstenedione is converted to testosterone, which in turn undergoes conversion to estradiol by <b>aromatase.</b> In an alternative pathway, Δ4-androstenedione is aromatized to estrone, which is subsequently converted to estradiol.|$|E
25|$|The rodent AFP {{system can}} be {{overridden}} with massive injections of estrogen, which overwhelm the AFP system and will masculinize the fetus. The masculinizing effect of estrogens may seem counter-intuitive since estrogens are critical for the proper development of female secondary characteristics during puberty. However, {{this is not the}} case prenatally. Gonadal hormones from the testes, such as testosterone and antimullerian hormone are required to cause development of a phenotypic male. Without these hormones the fetus will develop into a phenotypic female even if genetically XY. Interestingly, the conversion of testosterone into estradiol by <b>aromatase</b> in many tissues may be an important step in masculinization of that tissue. Masculinization of the brain is thought to occur both by conversion of testosterone into estradiol by <b>aromatase,</b> but also by de novo synthesis of estrogens within the brain. Thus, AFP may protect the fetus from maternal estradiol that would otherwise have a masculinizing effect on the fetus, but its exact role is still controversial.|$|E
25|$|Testosterone can be metabolized by <b>aromatase</b> into estradiol, {{and many}} other AAS can be metabolized into their {{corresponding}} estrogenic metabolites as well. As an example, the 17α-alkylated AAS methyltestosterone and metandienone are converted by <b>aromatase</b> into methylestradiol. 4,5α-Dihydrogenated derivatives of testosterone such as DHT cannot be aromatized, whereas 19-nortestosterone derivatives like nandrolone can be but to a greatly reduced extent. Some 19-nortestosterone derivatives, such as dimethandrolone and 11β-MNT, cannot be aromatized due to steric hindrance provided by their 11β-methyl group, whereas the closely related AAS trestolone (7α-methyl-19-nortestosterone), in relation to its lack of an 11β-methyl group, can be aromatized. AAS that are 17α-alkylated (and not also 4,5α-reduced or 19-demethylated) are also aromatized but {{to a lesser extent}} than is testosterone. However, it is notable that estrogens that are 17α-substituted (e.g., ethinylestradiol and methylestradiol) are of markedly increased estrogenic potency due to improved metabolic stability, and for this reason, 17α-alkylated AAS can actually have high estrogenicity and comparatively greater estrogenic effects than testosterone.|$|E
25|$|High {{doses of}} potent estrogens such as {{diethylstilbestrol}} and ethinylestradiol {{were used in}} the past in the treatment of breast cancer. Their effectiveness is approximately equivalent to that of antiestrogen therapy with tamoxifen or <b>aromatase</b> inhibitors. The use of high dose estrogen therapy in breast cancer has mostly been superseded by antiestrogen therapy due to the improved safety profile of the latter.|$|E
25|$|Valproic acid {{has been}} found to be an {{antagonist}} of the androgen and progesterone receptors, and hence as a nonsteroidal antiandrogen and antiprogestogen, at concentrations much lower than therapeutic serum levels. In addition, the drug has been identified as a potent <b>aromatase</b> inhibitor, and suppresses estrogen concentrations. These actions are likely to be involved in the reproductive endocrine disturbances seen with valproic acid treatment.|$|E
25|$|Menopause {{occurs because}} of the sharp {{decrease}} of estradiol and progesterone production by the ovaries. After menopause, estrogen continues to be produced mostly by <b>aromatase</b> in fat tissues and is produced in small amounts in many other tissues such as ovaries, bone, blood vessels, and the brain where it acts locally. The substantial fall in circulating estradiol levels at menopause impacts many tissues, from brain to skin.|$|E
25|$|A {{dramatic}} {{demonstration of}} the importance of estrogens in the regulation of fat deposition comes from transgenic mice that were genetically engineered to lack a functional <b>aromatase</b> gene. These mice have very low levels of estrogen and are obese. Obesity was also observed in estrogen deficient female mice lacking the follicle-stimulating hormone receptor. The effect of low estrogen on increased obesity has been linked to estrogen receptor alpha.|$|E
25|$|Estrogen cycling was {{reported}} at the 31st annual San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium. About {{a third of the}} 66 participants - women with metastatic breast cancer that had developed resistance to standard estrogen-lowering therapy - a daily dose of estrogen could stop the growth of their tumors or even cause them to shrink. If study participants experienced disease progression on estrogen, they could go back to an <b>aromatase</b> inhibitor that they were previously resistant to and see a benefit - their tumors were once again inhibited by estrogen deprivation. That effect sometimes wore off after several months, but then the tumors might again be sensitive to estrogen therapy. In fact, some patients have cycled back and forth between estrogen and an <b>aromatase</b> inhibitor for several years. PET (positron emission tomography) scans before starting estrogen and again 24 hours later predicted those tumors which responded to estrogen therapy: the responsive tumors showed an increased glucose uptake, called a PET flare. The mechanism of action is uncertain, although estrogen reduces the amount of a tumor-promoting hormone called insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF1).|$|E
