40|$|The {{effectiveness}} of different low <b>air</b> <b>velocities</b> in maintaining thermal comfort and homeostasis during exercise at space station operational {{temperature and humidity}} was investigated. Five male subjects exercised on a treadmill for successive ten minute periods at 60, 71, and 83 percent of maximum oxygen consumption at each of four <b>air</b> <b>velocities,</b> 30, 50, 80, and 120 ft/min, at 22 C and 62 percent relative humidity. No consistent trends or {{statistically significant differences between}} <b>air</b> <b>velocities</b> were found in body weight loss, sweat accumulation, or changes in rectal, skin, and body temperatures. Occurrence of the smallest body weight loss at 120 ft/min, the largest sweat accumulation at 30 ft/min, and the smallest rise in rectal temperature and the greatest drop in skin temperature at 120 ft/min all suggested more efficient evaporative cooling at the highest velocity. Heat storage at all velocities was evidenced by increased rectal and body temperatures; skin temperatures declined or increased only slightly. Body and rectal temperature increases corresponded with increased perception of warmth and slight thermal discomfort as exercise progressed. At all <b>air</b> <b>velocities,</b> mean thermal perception never exceeded warm and mean discomfort, greatest at 30 ft/min, was categorized at worst as uncomfortable; sensation of thermal neutrality and comfort returned rapidly after cessation of exercise. Suggestions for further elucidation of the effects of low <b>air</b> <b>velocities</b> on thermal comfort and homeostasis include larger numbers of subjects, more extensive skin temperature measurements and more rigorous analysis of the data from this study...|$|R

25|$|When {{the ball}} is new the seam is {{used to create a}} layer of {{turbulent}} air {{on one side of the}} ball, by angling it to one side and spinning the ball along the seam. This changes the separation points of the air with the ball; this turbulent air creates a greater coverage of air, providing lift. The next layer of air will have a greater velocity over the side with the turbulent air due to the greater air coverage and as there is a difference in <b>air</b> <b>velocity,</b> the static pressure of both sides of the ball are different and {{the ball is}} both 'lifted' and 'sucked' towards the turbulent airflow side of the ball.|$|E
25|$|Development of the Concorde {{harnessed}} a then-new type of {{delta wing}} {{that was being}} developed at the RAE known as the ogee or ogival delta design. This design aimed to improve both supersonic performance through limited span, and low-speed performance {{through the creation of}} vortices between the wing and fuselage that increased <b>air</b> <b>velocity</b> over the wing and thereby increased lift. In order to make full use of this effect, the wing should be as long as possible, and highly swept at the root. Continued studies of this basic concept led to the ogee layout and it eventually become apparent that a series of full-scale flight tests would be necessary for its validation.|$|E

40|$|In {{conjunction}} with steady increases in production levels, longwall operators have applied greater quantities of ventilating air and spray water {{in an effort}} to control respirable dust and/or methane. <b>Air</b> <b>velocities</b> greater than 7. 6 mls (1500 fpm) have been measured on longwall faces. Operators have expressed concern over the potential entrainment of respirable dust at these high velocities. The greatest likelihood for entraining dust into the high velocity airstream may occur as shields are advanced allowing relatively dry particles to fall from the shield canopy directly into the airstream. Laboratory tests to simulate dust liberation during shield movement were conducted at the Pittsburgh Research Laboratory of NIOSH at velocities ranging from 2. 0 to 8. 2 m/s (400 to 1600 fpm).

25|$|Cubic {{feet per}} minute (CFM) is an often {{confusing}} term {{because it has}} no single definition that applies to all instances. Gases are compressible, which means that a figure in cubic feet per minute cannot necessarily be compared with another figure when it comes {{the mass of the}} gas. To further confuse the issue, a centrifugal fan is a constant CFM device or a constant volume device. This means that, provided the fan speed remains constant, a centrifugal fan will pump a constant volume of air. This {{is not the same as}} pumping a constant mass of air. Again, the fan will pump the same volume, though not mass, at any other air density. This means that the <b>air</b> <b>velocity</b> in a system is the same even though mass flow rate through the fan is not.|$|E
25|$|Porous bass trap {{absorbers}} {{need to be}} {{very thick}} to be effective at lower frequencies so they tend to be allocated either as diagonal wedges in the corners or as thick rectangular bulk behind false walls where they are {{out of the way and}} less likely to disrupt higher frequencies or room function. Air gap behind a porous panel absorber e.g. straddling a corner also helps to ensure it protrudes more into the room where there is more <b>air</b> <b>velocity,</b> improving its velocity-based absorption and extending its bandwidth while inducing some ripple in its absorption spectrum. Resonant bass trap absorbers need to be at a pressure maximum and tend to be thinner, so they are more conveniently and effectively positioned flat against a wall in a corner where the pressure is maximum, rather than straddling a corner where there is more velocity.|$|E
25|$|A {{heat sink}} is {{designed}} to maximize its surface area {{in contact with the}} cooling medium surrounding it, such as the air. <b>Air</b> <b>velocity,</b> choice of material, protrusion design and surface treatment are factors that affect the performance of a heat sink. Heat sink attachment methods and thermal interface materials also affect the die temperature of the integrated circuit. Thermal adhesive or thermal grease improve the heat sink's performance by filling air gaps between the heat sink and the heat spreader on the device. A heat sink is usually made out of copper and/or aluminium. Copper is used because it has many desirable properties for thermally efficient and durable heat exchangers. First and foremost, copper is an excellent conductor of heat. This means that copper's high thermal conductivity allows heat to pass through it quickly. Aluminium is used in applications where weight is a big concern.|$|E
40|$|Train {{tunnels and}} subways are an {{interesting}} field of ventilation. Trains move air through tunnels at rates of 600 m 3 /s (over 2 x 106 m 3 per hour) {{which is much more}} than flow rates in buildings. Air pressures can vary up to some 3000 Pa leading to <b>air</b> <b>velocities</b> in the range of 10 to 50 m/s. This can lead to unsafe situations and thermal discomfort. The development of high speed trains causes more concern for better tunnel design.

40|$|The {{objective}} is to accurately measure very low <b>air</b> <b>velocities</b> (0 - 100 ft/min) in U. S. large-opening underground metal/nonmetal mines. Hundreds of metal/nonmetal underground mines operate throughout the United States. They extract commercial products from deposits such as limestone, salt, and gypsum. Mining generates {{a wide variety of}} gases and dusts, such as silica, diesel exhaust, radon, blasting byproducts, and perhaps even methane. If these substances become airborne, they can adversely affect {{the health and safety of}} underground workers. Many metal/nonmetal mines have large cross-sectional airways that could be 60 times larger than an average underground coal mine entry. These large airways require adequate volumes of fresh air to dilute, make harmless, and exhaust the toxic and, at times, explosive byproducts. However, in some underground mine sections, air movement is barely perceptible. The technology of measuring very low <b>air</b> <b>velocities</b> will become increasingly more important for operators of large-opening stone mines in order to monitor miner exposure to diesel particulate matter. Conventional anemometers (e. g., vane) are capable of accurately measuring <b>air</b> <b>velocities</b> only above 100 ft/min. Thus, it was necessary to investigate other anemometry technology to detect low <b>air</b> <b>velocities</b> in the range of 0 - 100 ft/min. Two different portable ultrasonic anemometers were tested.

25|$|Air {{circulation}} rate: Drying {{time and}} timber quality {{depend on the}} <b>air</b> <b>velocity</b> and its uniform circulation. At a constant temperature and relative humidity, the highest possible drying rate is obtained by rapid circulation of air {{across the surface of}} wood, giving rapid removal of moisture evaporating from the wood. However, a higher drying rate is not always desirable, particularly for impermeable hardwoods, because higher drying rates develop greater stresses that may cause the timber to crack or distort. At very low fan speeds, less than 1m/s, the air flow through the stack is often laminar flow, and the heat transfer between the timber surface and the moving air stream is not particularly effective (Walker et al., 1993). The low effectiveness (externally) of heat transfer is not necessarily a problem if internal moisture movement is the key limitation to the movement of moisture, as it is for most hardwoods (Pordage and Langrish, 1999).|$|E
