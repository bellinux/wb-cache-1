40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{friction}} coefficient of <b>a</b> moving liquid <b>marble,</b> <b>a</b> small liquid droplet coated with hydrophobic powder and floating on another liquid surface. <b>A</b> floating <b>marble</b> can easily move across water surface {{due to the}} low friction, allowing for the transport of aqueous solutions with minimal energy input. However, the motion of <b>a</b> floating <b>marble</b> {{has yet to be}} systematically characterised {{due to the lack of}} insight into key parameters such as the coefficient of friction between the floating marble and the carrier liquid. We measured the coefficient of friction of <b>a</b> small floating <b>marble</b> using <b>a</b> novel experimental setup that exploits the non-wetting properties of <b>a</b> liquid <b>marble.</b> <b>A</b> floating liquid <b>marble</b> pair containing <b>a</b> minute amount magnetite particles were immobilised and then released in a controlled manner using permanent magnets. The capillarity-driven motion was analysed to determine the coefficient of friction of the liquid marbles. The "capillary charge" model was used to fit the experimental results. We varied the marble content and carrier liquid to establish a relationship between the friction correction factor and the meniscus angle...|$|R
