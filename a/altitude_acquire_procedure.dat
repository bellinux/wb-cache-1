40|$|This thesis {{describes}} an implemented system called NODDY for <b>acquiring</b> <b>procedures</b> from examples presented by a teacher. <b>Acquiring</b> <b>procedures</b> form examples involves several different generalization tasks. Generalization is an underconstrained task, {{and the main}} issue of machine learning is how to deal with this underconstraint. The thesis presents two principles for constraining generalization on which NODDY is based. The first principle is to exploit domain based constraints. NODDY demonstrated how such constraints can be used both to reduce the space of possible generalizations to manageable size, and how to generate negative examples out of positive examples to further constrain the generalization. The second principle is to avoid spurious generalizations by requiring justification before adopting a generalization. NODDY demonstrates several different ways of justifying a generalization and proposes a way of ordering and searching a space of candidate generalizations based on how much evidence would be required to justify each generalization. <b>Acquiring</b> <b>procedures</b> also involves three types of constructive generalizations: inferring loops (a kind of group), inferring complex relations and state variables, and inferring predicates. NODDY demonstrates three constructive generalization methods for these kinds of generalization...|$|R

40|$|In this {{bachelor}} thesis, a nonlinear {{mathematical model}} simulation and linear controller {{design for the}} U 1 -H 1 helicopter was achieved. This thesis {{is divided into two}} parts. In the first part, the nonlinear dynamic model is developed using the Matrix Laboratory Software and Heli-Dyn R Software, which is a modeling and simulation tool for rotorcraft developed by Dr. Ilkay Yavrucuk at Middle East Technical University. The non-linear model consists in a contribution of main rotor, tail rotor, fuselage, gravitational model, horizontal and vertical tail rotor. The U 1 -H 1 main rotor non-linear mathematical model was build by use of blade element momentum theory, inflow dynamics and flapping dynamics. The total forces and moments are used in 6 degrees of freedom equations of motion model and helicopter states are obtained for hover conditions and forward flight. Trim and linearization process was done by Heli-Dyn R Software. The second part consists in a stability augmentation systems (SAS) followed by a set of automatic flight control systems (AFCS) designed by use of PID controllers. The AFCS main objective is to ease the pilot by decreasing the workload. The stability augmentation systems was designed by use of optimal control, especially Linear Quadratic Tracking Controller (LQT) and Linear Quadratic Regulator Controller (LQR). The automatic flight control systems implemented are heading hold, attitude, hold <b>altitude</b> <b>acquire</b> and hold mode for hover condition and heading hold, attitude hold, <b>altitude</b> <b>acquire</b> and hold mode and airspeed hold for forward flight condition. Furthermore, in order to check the robustness of the controllers and directory modes, disturbances were added to the model. The nonlinear model in trim mode simulations shown that the U 1 -H 1 has achieved hovering conditions and forward flight successfully. Furthermore, the controllers and directory modes shown a successful dynamic behavior towards perturbations...|$|R

40|$|High {{altitude}} platform (HAP) drones {{can provide}} broadband wireless connectivity to ground users {{in rural areas}} by establishing line-of-sight (LoS) links and exploiting effective beamforming techniques. However, at high <b>altitudes,</b> <b>acquiring</b> the channel state information (CSI) for HAPs, which is a key component to perform beamforming, is challenging. In this paper, by exploiting an interference alignment (IA) technique, a novel method for achieving the maximum sum-rate in HAP-based communications without CSI is proposed. In particular, to realize IA, a multiple-antenna tethered balloon {{is used as a}} relay between multiple HAP drones and ground stations (GSs). Here, a multiple-input multiple-output X network system is considered. The capacity of the considered M*N X network with a tethered balloon relay is derived in closed-form. Simulation results corroborate the theoretical findings and show that the proposed approach yields the maximum sum-rate in multiple HAPs-GSs communications in absence of CSI. The results also show the existence of an optimal balloon's altitude for which the sum-rate is maximized. Comment: Accepted in IEEE Communications Letter...|$|R

40|$|This study {{examined}} how mood states affect nursing students' {{performance on a}} treatment procedure consisting of a novel combination of familiar clinical steps. Thirty third-year and fourth-year nursing students were first taught the procedure and then given both an anxious-mood and a calm-mood induction in a randomly assigned counterbalanced order. Anxiety was induced by showing a video of interviews with frontline nurses and doctors during the {{severe acute respiratory syndrome}} epidemic in Hong Kong, China; calmness was induced by a video of a nursing student's pleasant orientation to a clinical placement site. Nursing students were significantly less proficient in performing the newly <b>acquired</b> <b>procedure</b> after an anxious-mood induction (focused on occupational risks) than after a calm-mood induction. Therefore, managing clinical training site anxiety among nursing students may help to optimize learning and clinical performance. © SLACK Incorporated. postprin...|$|R

This paper describes the design, implementation and evaluation of a learning agent. In contrast to most Artificial Intelligence projects, the design centers on a user study, with a human-simulated agent to discover the interactions that people find natural. Our work shows that users instinctively communicate via “hints, ” or partially-specified, ambiguous, instructions. Hints may be input verbally, or by pointing, or by selecting from menus. They may be unsolicited, or arise {{in response to a}} query from the agent. We develop a theory of instruction types for an agent to interpret them.

40|$|There {{has been}} an {{increasing}} number of articles stressing the advantage of applying remote sensing products of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) and interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) for rapidly enhancing the volume of geological data in Amazonian areas, where forest cover is dense and high, clouds are abundant and accessibility is limited. The majority of these studies has emphasized geomorphology as a tool for both discussing tectonic reactivations during the Cenozoic and reconstructing Quaternary paleolandscapes. This work applies Digital Elevation Model (DEM) derived from the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) for delineating past morphological features under dense rainforest in an Amazonian lowland area. Previous use of this tool in southwestern Marajó Island (northern Brazil) helped to delineate, with exceptional precision, a paleochannel network hidden under the rainforest, which would be barely detected with other available remote sensing products. Fieldwork revealed that these paleochannels are related to palimpsest drainage systems developed mostly during the last 40, 000 14 C yr B. P. Measured <b>altitudes</b> <b>acquired</b> during topographic surveys attested that paleochannel areas are slightly higher than adjacent floodplains. This fact determined the successful application of SRTM-DEM for mapping paleochannels in Marajó Island. Integration of SRTM data with sedimentological information collected during fieldwork suggests paleoflows derived from continental areas located to south of the study area. This paleodrainage was active when the island was still connected to mainland. With island detachment due to reactivation of tectonic faults, the channels became abandoned and were progressively forested. The results obtained in the present study indicate that SRTM-DEM has high potential for unraveling similar morphological features from many other Amazonian areas with low topography and a dense forest cover.

The thesis is a follow up of previous research activities that focused on word problems {{and the use of}} experience gathered from them. The whole issue of word problems on motion was selected as the example of typical problems, which children have to face at school, and therefore, they acquire more or less a specific procedure of solving them (as established in prior research).

40|$|In X-ray guided procedures, {{the surgeon}} or interventionalist is {{dependent}} {{on his or her}} knowledge of the patient's specific anatomy and the projection images <b>acquired</b> during the <b>procedure</b> by a rotational X-ray source. Unfortunately, these X-ray projections fail to give information on the patient's anatomy in the dimension along the projection axis. It would be very profitable to provide the surgeon or interventionalist with a 3 D insight of the patient's anatomy that is directly linked to the X-ray images <b>acquired</b> during the <b>procedure.</b> In this paper we present a new robust 2 D- 3 D registration method based on the Projection-Slice Theorem. This theorem gives us a relation between the pre-operative 3 D data set and the interventional projection images. Registration is performed by minimizing a translation invariant similarity measure that is applied to the Fourier transforms of the images. The method was tested by performing multiple exhaustive searches on phantom data of the Circle of Willis and on a post-mortem human skull. Validation was performed visually by comparing the test projections to the ones that corresponded to the minimal value of the similarity measure. The Projection-Slice Theorem Based method was shown to be very effective and robust, and provides capture ranges up to 62 degrees. Experiments have shown that the method is capable of retrieving similar results when translations are applied to the projection images...|$|R
