25|$|The {{product of}} the unit, the <b>alkylate,</b> is {{composed}} of a mixture of high-octane, branched-chain paraffinic hydrocarbons (mostly isoheptane and isooctane). <b>Alkylate</b> is a premium gasoline blending stock because it has exceptional antiknock properties and is clean burning. The octane number of the <b>alkylate</b> depends mainly upon the kind of alkenes used and upon operating conditions. For example, isooctane results from combining butylene with isobutane and has an octane rating of 100 by definition. There are other products in the <b>alkylate</b> effluent, however, so the octane rating will vary accordingly.|$|E

The unit uses the AlkyClean® process technology jointly developed by Albemarle Corporation, CB and Neste Oil. Start-up of the unit, {{which has a}} capacity of 2,700 barrels per stream day of <b>alkylate</b> production, was on August 18. The AlkyClean process, together with Albemarle's AlkyStar catalyst produces high-quality <b>alkylate</b> product {{without the use of}} liquid acid catalysts in the <b>alkylate</b> manufacturing process.|$|E

50|$|<b>Alkylating</b> {{antineoplastic agents}} have limitations. Their {{functionality}} {{has been found}} to be limited when in the presence of the DNA-repair enzyme O-6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT). Cross-linking of double-stranded DNA by <b>alkylating</b> agents is inhibited by the cellular DNA-repair mechanism, MGMT. If the MGMT promoter region is methylated, the cells no longer produce MGMT, and are therefore more responsive to <b>alkylating</b> agents. Methylation of the MGMT promoter in gliomas is a useful predictor of the responsiveness of tumors to <b>alkylating</b> agents.|$|R

25|$|Small {{amounts of}} {{endogenous}} ethylene are also produced in mammals, including humans, due to lipid peroxidation. Some of endogenous ethylene is then oxidized to ethylene oxide, which {{is able to}} <b>alkylate</b> DNA and proteins, including hemoglobin (forming a specific adduct with its N-terminal valine, N-hydroxyethyl-valine). Endogenous ethylene oxide, just as like environmental (exogenous) one, can <b>alkylate</b> guanine in DNA, forming an adduct 7-(2-hydroxyethyl)-guanine, and this poses an intrinsic carcinogenic risk. It is also mutagenic.|$|E

Specifically, her lab's {{goal is to}} [...] "understand the biology, the biochemistry, and the {{genetics}} of numerous DNA repair pathways that act upon DNA alkylation damage." [...] This is applicable to human cancer research, because <b>alkylating</b> agents are used extensively in chemotherapy and other cancer treatments. She is researching [...] "how eukaryotic cells respond to <b>alkylating</b> agents." [...] <b>Alkylating</b> agents are drugs which work by replacing a hydrogen with an alkyl group, with the end result being DNA damage. [...] <b>Alkylating</b> agents inhibit protein synthesis and damages rapidly dividing cells, among which cancer cells are primarily affected because they divide so rapidly.

The molecular mechanisms involved in this mTOR-mediated hypoxia-induced chemoresistance, however, are unclear. Here we identify the mTOR target N-myc downstream regulated gene 1 (NDRG 1) as a key determinant of resistance toward <b>alkylating</b> chemotherapy, driven by hypoxia but also by therapeutic measures such as irradiation, corticosteroids, and chronic exposure to <b>alkylating</b> agents via distinct molecular routes involving hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) - 1 alpha, p 53, and the mTOR complex 2 (mTORC 2) /serum glucocorticoid-induced protein kinase 1 (SGK 1) pathway. Resistance toward <b>alkylating</b> chemotherapy but not radiotherapy was dependent on NDRG 1 expression and activity. In posttreatment tumor tissue of patients with malignant gliomas, NDRG 1 was induced and predictive of poor response to <b>alkylating</b> chemotherapy. On a molecular level, NDRG 1 bound and stabilized methyltransferases, chiefly O(6) -methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT), a key enzyme for resistance to <b>alkylating</b> agents in glioblastoma patients. In patients with glioblastoma, MGMT promoter methylation in tumor tissue was not more predictive for response to <b>alkylating</b> chemotherapy in patients who received concomitant corticosteroids...|$|R

Notably, variable costs greatly depend on the technology used, the factor making the difference being the acid consumption. Between 50 and 80nbsp&kg of H2SO4 frequently required to produce 1 ton of <b>alkylate.</b> At preferred condition, the consumption of acis can be much lower, such as 10–30nbsp&kg of acid per ton of <b>alkylate.</b> In a SAAU acid costs frequently account for about {{one third of the}} total operating costs of alkylation, hence there is considerable incentive to reduce H2SO4 consumption.|$|E

An aqueous acetone 4 -(4 ’-nitrobenzyl) pyridine (NBP) assay for <b>alkylating</b> activity was used at neutral pH {{to reproduce the}} Swain-Scott-Ogston reactivity sequence of nucleo-phile n constants, based on bimolecular competition between NBP and added nucleophiles for alkylation by nitrogen mustards, methanesulfonate esters, methyl iodide, epichloroh-ydrin, or 1, 3 -bis(2 -chloroethyl) - 1 -nitrosourea (BCNU). Nucleophile concentration-depen-dent decreases in the 540 -nm NBP product(s) permitted determination of the second-order rate constant ratio, k /k 0 bp, for alkylation of the competing nucleophile/NBP.

25|$|Currently, many {{countries}} set limits on gasoline aromatics in general, benzene in particular, and olefin (alkene) content. Such regulations led to increasing preference for high octane pure paraffin (alkane) components, such as <b>alkylate,</b> and is forcing refineries to add processing units to reduce benzene content.

50|$|Since cancer cells, in general, proliferate {{faster and}} with less error-correcting than healthy cells, cancer cells are more {{sensitive}} to DNA damage—such as being alkylated. <b>Alkylating</b> agents are used to treat several cancers. However, they are also toxic to normal cells (cytotoxic), particularly cells that divide frequently, {{such as those in}} the gastrointestinal tract, bone marrow, testicles and ovaries, which can cause loss of fertility.

40|$|Intrinsic or {{acquired}} chemoresistance to <b>alkylating</b> agents is a {{major cause}} of treatment failure in patients with malignant brain tumors. <b>Alkylating</b> agents, the mainstay of treatment for brain tumors, damage the DNA and induce apoptosis, but the cytotoxic activity of these agents is dependent on DNA repair pathways. For example, O 6 -methylguanine DNA adducts can cause double-strand breaks, but this is dependent on a functional mismatch repair pathway. Thus, tumor cell lines deficient in mismatch repair are resistant to <b>alkylating</b> agents. Perhaps the most important mechanism of resistance to <b>alkylating</b> agents is the DNA repair enzyme O 6 -methylguanine methyltransferase, which can eliminate the cytotoxic O 6 -methylguanine DNA adduct before it causes harm. Another mechanism of resistance to <b>alkylating</b> agents is the base excision repair (BER) pathway. Consequently, efforts are ongoing to develop effective inhibitors of BER. Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase plays a pivotal role in BER and is an important therapeutic target. Developing effective strategies to overcome chemoresistance requires the identification of reliable preclinical models that recapitulate human disease and which can be used to facilitate drug development.
