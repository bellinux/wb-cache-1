40|$|M. A. (Public Management and Governance) The South African {{road system}} is {{managed by the}} South African National Roads Agency Limited (SANRAL), which is an agency under the Department of Transport. The main aim of SANRAL is to connect major cities, towns and {{emerging}} villages. It has undertaken a project of upgrading and expanding of the road network in the Gauteng Province of South Africa, known as the e-tolling system. It allows for the free flow Electronic Tolling (E-Toll) system and records all vehicles passing through the tollgate without requiring them to stop or slow. <b>A</b> <b>built-in</b> <b>device</b> (tag) is fitted into the overhead gantry system to detect the passing vehicle, which reads an e-tag (if fitted), as well as recording the number plate of the vehicle. A fee for using the road will be charged and paid later from a registered e-toll account, linked to the vehicle user or if no e-tag is present a bill is submitted to the owner. The primary issue associated with the project relates to complaints from various interest groups, political parties and civic organisations regarding public participation in the planning and execution of e-tolling. This has resulted in mass marches and court cases, with the project, consequently undergoing delays, suspension and postponements. The study is, thus, motivated by the foregoing factors in endeavouring to assess {{the effectiveness of the}} public participation process in the initial stages of the e-tolling project. The research utilised an exploratory case study method; comprehensively appraising the public participation areas within the e-tolling project of Gauteng. The study employed both documentation reviews and interviews as data collection methods. The research design was predominantly qualitative, however data analysis was undertaken and presented in both qualitative and quantitative evaluations [...] ...|$|E
40|$|Vectors {{derived from}} human {{immunodeficiency}} virus (HIV) are highly efficient vehicles for in vivo gene delivery. However, their biosafety is of major concern. Here we exploit {{the complexity of the}} HIV genome to provide lentivirus vectors with novel biosafety features. In addition to the structural genes, HIV contains two regulatory genes, tat and rev, that are essential for HIV replication, and four accessory genes that encode critical virulence factors. We previously reported that the HIV type 1 accessory open reading frames are dispensable for efficient gene transduction by a lentivirus vector. We now demonstrate that the requirement for the tat gene can be offset by placing constitutive promoters upstream of the vector transcript. Vectors generated from constructs containing such a chimeric long terminal repeat (LTR) transduced neurons in vivo at very high efficiency, {{whether or not they were}} produced in the presence of Tat. When the rev gene was also deleted from the packaging construct, expression of gag and pol was strictly dependent on Rev complementation in trans. By the combined use of a separate nonoverlapping Rev expression plasmid and a 5 ' LTR chimeric transfer construct, we achieved optimal yields of vector of high transducing efficiency (up to 10 (7) transducing units [TU]/ml and 10 (4) TU/ng of p 24). This third-generation lentivirus vector uses only a fractional set of HIV genes: gag, pol, and rev. Moreover, the HIV-derived constructs, and any recombinant between them, are contingent on upstream elements and trans complementation for expression and thus are nonfunctional outside of the vector producer cells. This split-genome, conditional packaging system is based on existing viral sequences and acts as <b>a</b> <b>built-in</b> <b>device</b> against the generation of productive recombinants. While the actual biosafety of the vector will ultimately be proven in vivo, the improved design presented here should facilitate testing of lentivirus vectors...|$|E

5000|$|The building's modest {{interior}} finishes reflect {{not only}} the frugality of the federal building program during this period, but also the sparseness of the Greek Revival style.

40|$|A {{miniature}} intra-oral {{dental implant}} system including <b>a</b> <b>built-in</b> biosensor <b>device</b> is proposed in this article. The dental implant system, or platform, is replaced over maxilla and allows relatively non-invasive procedures for a novel biosensing scheme for human blood analysis. Due to {{placement of the}} implant fixture, periodontal ligaments and the pulp structure, which are regarded as the main origin of pain, are thus removed, and long-term, continuous blood analysis and management through maxillary bone marrow becomes achievable through the dental implant platform. The new pathway of biological sensing is {{for the first time}} presented to realize an accurate and painless approach without injections. The dental implant system mainly consists of an implant fixture and a prosthetic abutment, a biosensor module, a bluetooth 4. 0 wireless module and a dc button cell battery. The electrochemical biosensor possesses three electrodes, including working, reference and counter ones, which are arranged to pass through the titanium implant fixture below the biosensor module. The electrodes are exposed to the blood pool inside the maxillary bone marrow and perform oxidation/reduction reactions with the coating of biosensing enzyme. To prove the proposed platform, the immobilization process of glucose oxidase (GOD) enzyme and in vitro detections of glucose levels are successfully carried out, and proven sensitivity, linearity and repeatability of the glucose biosensor system are obtained. Moreover, a preliminary canine animal model adopting the new pathway shows significant consistency with the traditional method through dermal pricks for blood sugar detection. Despite the prospective results, further challenges in engineering implementation and clinical practices are addressed and discussed. In brief, the novel biosensing pathway and intra-oral biosensor platform may increasingly reveal their promising value and feasibilities in current bio-medical analysis, diagnosis, drug release and even healthcare technologies...|$|R
