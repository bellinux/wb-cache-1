40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 37 - 38) Conflicting {{findings have}} raised the problem {{of whether or not}} attribution <b>of</b> <b>responsibility</b> increases as the severity of consequences increases. In the present experiment the degree and direction <b>of</b> <b>assignment</b> <b>of</b> <b>responsibility</b> to a male or a female stimulus person (SP) were studied as a function of magnitude of consequences {mild or severe} in a bad accident. Ninety male Ss and ninety female Ss were assigned to the four treatment cells. Each S read a case history in which the SP was involved in a mishap. Results on a twelve item questionnaire measuring attribution <b>of</b> <b>responsibility</b> and other perceptions of the SP did not support Lerner's (1965) and Walster???s (1966) hypotheses that the <b>assignment</b> <b>of</b> <b>responsibility</b> increases as the magnitude of consequences increases. The trend was toward an inverse relationship, i. e., as the magnitude <b>of</b> consequences decreases, <b>assignment</b> <b>of</b> <b>responsibility</b> increases. The hypothesis that male Ss would attribute more responsibility than would female Ss was confirmed. There was a trend for male Ss to make more allowances for the female stimulus person in the severe case but not in the mild case. The results on the questionnaire corresponded with the results on the Internal-External Control scale which showed that female Ss attributed more control to chance and fate than male Ss did. Lerner's (1965) and Walster???s (1966) theories apparently cannot provide satisfactory explanations of the processes which underlie attribution <b>of</b> <b>responsibility...</b>|$|R

These causes put together resulted in the Czech pilots not being fully aware of the true configuration of the Learjet and the targets, which in turn led to them targeting the wrong target and one of them eventually firing on it. Contributing causes were that the Czech pilots had little to no experience of this kind of exercise, and that the target-towing Learjet had no means of monitoring the exercise. For instance the Learjet lacked a radar warning receiver that could have revealed that they had been targeted by the Gripens.|$|E

Most of these {{studies have been conducted}} in the United States and Western Europe. A small number of studies, however, have been conducted in developing countries. Review of the literature reveals the absence of studies on people 2 ̆ 7 s reactions toward AIDS patients in Saudi Arabia.

Structural equation modeling was used to test several hypotheses. Paths from <b>assignment</b> <b>of</b> <b>responsibility</b> to positive and negative affects were found to be in the predicted directions. Respondents who assigned more responsibility to the AIDS patient for his illness, reported more negative than positive affect. Also, the more positive affect expressed by the respondents the more willing they were to help the AIDS patient. Contrary to Weiner 2 ̆ 7 s prediction, no path was found from negative affect to willingness to help. No path was found from <b>assignment</b> <b>of</b> <b>responsibility</b> to willingness to help. Degree of religiosity and belief in a just-world had no influence on <b>assignment</b> <b>of</b> <b>responsibility.</b> Religious respondents reported less positive affect toward a friend with AIDS than less religious respondents.

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} one of {{the main}} problems in labour and industrial management in the occupational and industrial safety field - motivation to work safely. The problem is complex and should be solved by a set of measures, where the <b>assignment</b> <b>of</b> <b>responsibility</b> to employees for the results of their work is absent, including in the field of labour protection and industrial safety. In accordance with the obligatory management principles, employees' work resolves to the strict implementation of the actions prescribed by the regulations. The responsibility for the negative result rests with the person who enacted or instructs employees. Thus, the employee is practically exempt from responsibility for the final result. One of the possible solutions to this problem is to put an <b>assignment</b> <b>of</b> <b>responsibility</b> on the employees for the results of their activities also in the occupational and industrial safety field. This is illustrated by the experience of other states, particularly of Australia. In conclusion suggestions for improvement and development of the motivation system in the field of occupational and industrial safety...|$|R

40|$|The {{thesis is}} focused on the {{question}} of how responsibilities for the performance of public functions are assigned to levels or spheres of government. The term "public function" refers to the activities performed by governments in order to satisfy identified community needs. There is a paucity of validated knowledge concerning the particular phenomenon, and {{the purpose of the study}} is to make a research based contribution in this connection. Because of the exploratory nature of the study particular attention is paid to the orientation of the research in Public Administration terms, as well as to research design. A study of the <b>assignment</b> <b>of</b> <b>responsibilities</b> in a selection of foreign countries was undertaken, and the findings are recorded and evaluated. The conclusion reached is that in none of the countries studied a clear, comprehensive demarcation of governmental responsibilities has been achieved. Regarding South Africa, the thesis encompasses a historical overview, followed by separate analytical examinations of the arrangements set in place by the 1993 ("interim") and the 1996 ("final") Constitutions. In the pre-democratic era (1910 to 1994), ideological considerations patently played a prominent role. The treatment of the assignment question by the 1993 Constitution is found to have had substantial shortcomings, especially with regard to conceptual and technical aspects, the realisation of assignment principles, and the substance of assigned responsibilities. In the author's opinion a satisfactory deployment of responsibilities was not achieved. The 1996 Constitution improved the assignment scheme, notably through the better realisation of assignment principles, the introduction of exclusive powers for the provinces, and in dealing with the municipal domain. However, the 1996 Constitution also did not achieve a credible and clear-cut <b>assignment</b> <b>of</b> <b>responsibilities.</b> In assessing the degree to which a scientific approach to the assignment question is in evidence, the finding is that such an approach has not been established. A theoretical assignment model, following a Public Administration approach, is then presented. The model covers language, classification, assignment principles, and methodology. The thesis concludes with a reflection on the research, as well as on the practicalities of achieving improvement in the <b>assignment</b> <b>of</b> <b>responsibilities.</b> Public Administration and ManagementD.
