5|$|The shells {{are made}} of cast iron, {{as large as a}} bowl and shaped like a ball. Inside they contain half a pound of 'magic' gunpowder. They are sent flying towards the enemy camp from an eruptor; and when they get there <b>a</b> <b>sound</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> thunder-clap is heard, and flashes of light appear. If ten of these shells are fired {{successfully}} into the enemy camp, the whole place will be set ablaze...|$|E
2500|$|The film's fiery final {{sequence}} {{was shot}} without a stunt performer {{filling in for}} Leigh McCloskey. After the production's principal photography had been completed, the film's producer, Claudio Argento, asked if McCloskey {{would be willing to}} perform the stuntwork himself, as the stuntman hired for the job had broken his leg. The producer assured the actor: [...] "It'll be absolutely safe". The actor agreed, and when he walked onto the set the following day he observed [...] "three rows of flexiglass in front of everything and everyone is wearing hard hats. I'm the only guy standing {{on the other side of}} this! ...Needless to say, I did it all on instinct... I still feel that blast of the door blowing by me. When they tell you in words, its one thing, but when you feel that glass go flying past you with <b>a</b> <b>sound</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> Harrier jet, you never forget it!" ...|$|E
60|$|And {{a moment}} later there was <b>a</b> <b>sound</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> mighty rushing wind, and the {{relative}} had crossed the threshold at fifty m.p.h. under her own steam.|$|E
50|$|Chinese hinges may be {{designed}} to make <b>a</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> spoken word.|$|R
60|$|Then {{all that}} seemed cheering, din, and {{stamping}} roar deadened in <b>an</b> earth-shaking <b>sound</b> <b>like</b> <b>an</b> avalanche.|$|R
50|$|The {{man went}} {{for his third}} and last ox, and the robbers {{said that they would}} make him the band's leader if he stole it. The son made <b>a</b> <b>sound</b> <b>like</b> <b>an</b> ox bellowing in the woods, and the man, {{thinking}} it was his stolen oxen, ran off, leaving the third behind, and the son stole that one as well.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes; he's doing awfully well." [...] And <b>a</b> <b>sound</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> faint sigh {{caught his}} ears. [...] "Would you say he's changed much since you knew him, Dad?" ...|$|E
60|$|The {{question}} was not answered for, at that moment, <b>a</b> <b>sound</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> loud deep sigh was heard overhead. The natives started back; and even Stanley felt, for a moment, uncomfortable.|$|E
60|$|The woman, uttering <b>a</b> <b>sound</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> laugh, edged towards him, and Mr. Lavender edged away, so {{that they}} {{proceeded}} up the street crabwise, with Blink adhering jealously to her master's heels.|$|E
50|$|Audible Doppler {{and target}} size support passive vehicle type {{classification}} when {{identification friend or foe}} {{is not available}} from a transponder signal. Medium pulse repetition frequency (PRF) reflected microwave signals fall between 1,500 and 15,000 cycle per second, which is audible. This means <b>a</b> helicopter <b>sounds</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> helicopter, <b>a</b> jet <b>sounds</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> jet, and propeller aircraft <b>sound</b> <b>like</b> propellers. Aircraft with no moving parts produce a tone. The actual size of the target can be calculated using the audible signal.|$|R
60|$|Some minutes had passed, when <b>a</b> slight <b>sound,</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> {{fluttering}} bird, {{made him}} look up: Miss Dacre was standing at his side.|$|R
60|$|The name of {{the father}} of Genghis Khan is a word which can not be {{pronounced}} exactly in English. It <b>sounded</b> something <b>like</b> this, Yezonkai Behadr, with the accent on the last syllable, Behadr, and the <b>a</b> <b>sounded</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> in hark. This is as near as we can come to it; but the name, as it was really pronounced by the Mongul people, can not be written in English letters nor spoken with English sounds.|$|R
60|$|The Squire, {{who could}} see in, flung down his axe, and covered {{his eyes with}} his hands. The Rector uttered <b>a</b> <b>sound</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> deep oath, and he, too, flung down his axe.|$|E
60|$|Soames spun round, and met his visitor's eyes, and at {{the look}} he saw in them, <b>a</b> <b>sound</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> snarl escaped him. He drew his lips back in {{the ghost of a}} smile.|$|E
60|$|With <b>a</b> <b>sound</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> sob {{the groom}} fled. He was very white when he returned, {{even by the}} light of the lantern; and his hand trembled as he undid the {{fastenings}} and took the mare.|$|E
60|$|<b>A</b> <b>sound</b> suspiciously <b>like</b> <b>a</b> giggle {{came from}} the landing and fell heavily on Gale's ears. He {{closed his eyes and}} tried to think.|$|R
50|$|They are characterised by the Ligurian substratum. While Legnanese {{is closer}} to the Milanese dialect, Bustocco is very similar to the modern Ligurian language. In fact, there is the {{unstressed}} vowel u at the end of masculine nouns and other words (e.g. Bustocco gatu, secu, coldu, büceu, candu = Legnanese gatt, secch, cald, bicér, quand) and the elimination of some intervocalic consonants (e.g. Bustocco lauà = Legnanese lavurà). In both dialects the stressed <b>a</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> mix between a and o.|$|R
50|$|In Ciprés {{there is}} <b>a</b> rock that <b>sounds</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> bell.|$|R
60|$|Then {{there came}} another squall, {{which seemed to}} drive madly about all the echoes in the {{corridors}} above and in the cellars below. Again the noise ceased, and there came up <b>a</b> <b>sound</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> wheezy squeak.|$|E
60|$|Thyra made <b>a</b> <b>sound</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> strangled moan in {{the middle}} of August's speech. She heard the rest of it immovably. When it came to an end she stood and looked down upon him in a way that silenced him.|$|E
60|$|The Pellago Tavern was a {{transformed}} dwelling house. The {{pillars of}} the porch were aslant, and the rain-warped boards snapped beneath her feet. She hesitatingly opened the door. The hallway was dark and musty. <b>A</b> <b>sound</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> moan filtered down the unlighted stairs.|$|E
50|$|A starfish-like {{creature}} with <b>a</b> name that <b>sounds</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> popping <b>sound.</b>|$|R
6000|$|Turning, she stifled a yawn with <b>a</b> <b>sound</b> very <b>like</b> <b>a</b> groan. [...] "Then it's au revoir, Midgetina. Give me five minutes' start.... You know I am grateful?" ...|$|R
5000|$|This is what <b>a</b> Pipistrelle <b>sounds</b> <b>like</b> on <b>a</b> {{frequency}} division bat detector: ...|$|R
60|$|Then, suddenly, all was over. Levi's {{companion}} {{dropped to}} the sand without <b>a</b> <b>sound,</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> bundle of rags. For a moment he lay limp and inert; then one shuddering spasm passed over him and he lay silent and still, with his face half buried in the sand.|$|E
60|$|<b>A</b> <b>sound</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> sigh {{of relief}} went through the court. Then every one got up, {{and there was a}} {{movement}} to the doors. The policeman lifted the bar, and Ronald Mervyn stepped out a free man, and in a moment was surrounded by a number of his fellow officers, while some of his neighbours also pressed forward to shake him by the hand.|$|E
60|$|He {{sometimes}} read as he walked, {{and book}} in hand he frequently approached her now. This went on till six weeks had {{passed from the}} time of their first encounter. Latterly might have been once or twice heard, when he had moved out of earshot, <b>a</b> <b>sound</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> small gasping sigh; but no arrangements were disturbed, and Christopher continued to keep down his eyes as persistently as a saint in a church window.|$|E
6000|$|THE {{cabin in}} which I found myself {{was small and}} rather untidy. A youngish man with flaxen hair, a bristly straw-coloured moustache, and a {{dropping}} nether lip, was sitting and holding my wrist. For a minute we {{stared at each other}} without speaking. He had watery grey eyes, oddly void of expression. Then just overhead came <b>a</b> <b>sound</b> <b>like</b> <b>an</b> iron bedstead being knocked about, and the low angry growling of some large animal. At the same time the man spoke. He repeated his question,--"How do you feel now?" ...|$|R
50|$|A dummy {{is not to}} be {{confused}} with a blank, a cartridge for a firearm that contains propellant but no bullet or shot: a dummy does not produce <b>an</b> explosive <b>sound</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> blank does.|$|R
50|$|The male {{performs}} {{an aerial}} display during courtship, during which it makes <b>a</b> distinctive <b>sound</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> galloping horse. It is silent in winter. They nest in a well-hidden {{location on the}} ground, laying 3-4 eggs.|$|R
60|$|John did not {{indulge in}} this pleasantry until the exasperated diver was {{just outside of}} the house, and it was well {{that he was so}} prudent, for Maxwell turned round like a tiger and struck with {{tremendous}} force at his face. His hard knuckles met the panel of the door, in which they left an indelible print, {{and at the same time}} sent <b>a</b> <b>sound</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> distant cannon shot into the library.|$|E
6000|$|Old Jolyon {{had taken}} his cigar from under his white moustaches, stained by coffee at the edge, and looked at her, that little slip of a thing who had got such a grip of his heart. He knew more about 'swims' than his granddaughter. But she, having clasped {{her hands on his}} knees, rubbed her chin against him, making <b>a</b> <b>sound</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> purring cat. And, {{knocking}} the ash off his cigar, he had exploded in nervous desperation: ...|$|E
60|$|Godfrey {{lay with}} his gun pointed upwards; a minute later he heard the {{rustling}} of wings, which rose to <b>a</b> <b>sound</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> mighty wind, and then some forty yards overhead a dark cloud of birds swept along across the sky. Godfrey fired one barrel, waited {{a moment and then}} fired again. With a loud cry of surprise and alarm the flock divided in two, and almost instantly there were several heavy thuds on the ground close by.|$|E
2500|$|... robotic voice {{effects are}} used to make <b>an</b> actor's voice <b>sound</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> {{synthesized}} human voice.|$|R
60|$|Again--a fine, full, lofty tone, <b>a</b> deep, soft <b>sound,</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> storm whispering, made {{twilight}} undulate.|$|R
6000|$|To {{these words}} Cecilia {{answered}} with <b>a</b> <b>sound</b> almost <b>like</b> <b>a</b> gasp. [...] "I hadn't thought of that. Then we're responsible; it was we who advised Hilary {{to make her}} change her lodging." ...|$|R
