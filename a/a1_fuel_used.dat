500|$|In December 2008 an Air New Zealand jet {{completed}} the world's first commercial aviation test flight partially <b>using</b> jatropha-based <b>fuel.</b> [...] More {{than a dozen}} performance tests were undertaken in the two-hour test flight which departed from Auckland International Airport. A biofuel blend of 50:50 jatropha and Jet <b>A1</b> <b>fuel</b> was <b>used</b> to power one of the Boeing 747-400's Rolls-Royce RB211 engines. Air New Zealand set several criteria for its jatropha, requiring that [...] "the land it came from was neither forest nor virgin grassland in the previous 20 years, that the soil and climate it came from is not suitable {{for the majority of}} food crops and that the farms are rain fed and not mechanically irrigated". The company has also set general sustainability criteria, saying that such biofuels must not compete with food resources, that they must be as good as traditional jet fuels, and that they should be cost competitive.|$|R

50|$|A 2013-2014 study jointly {{hosted by}} NASA, German {{aerospace}} center DLR, and Canada's National Research Council NRC, determined that biofuels could reduce contrail generation. This reduction was explained by demonstrating that biofuels produce fewer soot particles, {{which are the}} nuclei around which the ice crystals form. The tests were performed by flying a DC-8 at cruising altitude with a sample-gathering aircraft flying in trail. In these samples, the contrail-producing soot particle count was reduced by 50 to 70 percent, using a 50% blend of conventional Jet <b>A1</b> <b>fuel</b> and HEFA (hyprocessed esters and fatty acids) biofuel produced from camelina.|$|R

40|$|Heavy duty diesel {{construction}} equipment consumes {{large quantities of}} fuel and subsequently emits significant quantities of air pollutants. This paper presents a methodology for characterizing <b>fuel</b> <b>use</b> and emissions rates of {{construction equipment}} {{in order to better}} estimate air pollution emission rates. The research is based on real-world data collected ftom the equipment as it performed construction activities in tlre fleld. This study examined five wheel loaders by estimating the weighted-average <b>fuel</b> <b>use</b> and emissions rates via an engine load modal analysis. For each wheel loader, the engine load data was classified into 10 modes, ranging from the minimum to the maximum engine load, and an average <b>fuel</b> <b>use</b> and emissions rates were determined for each mode. The overall weighted-average <b>fuel</b> <b>use</b> rate was determined by multiplying the modal average <b>fuel</b> <b>use</b> and emissions rates by the percentage of time spent in that particular engine mode and then summing the results for each of the 10 modes. Monte Carlo simulation was used to model the distributions of the weighted-average <b>fuel</b> <b>use</b> rate for each wheel loader by randomly selecting values (within specified ranges) for the percentage of time spent in each engine mode and the modal average <b>fuel</b> <b>use</b> rate. The resutts indicate that there is inter-vehicle variability in the weighted-average <b>fuel</b> <b>use</b> rates of the five wheel loaders. A sensitivity analysis was also performed in order to determine which variables have the greatest impact on thg wqighted-averagg <b>fuel</b> <b>use</b> and emissions rates...|$|R

40|$|The paper {{discusses}} {{some preliminary}} findings on how fuel prices {{and other factors}} are linked with automobile <b>fuel</b> <b>use,</b> travel and <b>fuel</b> economy. It is shown {{that there is a}} clear crosssectional relationship between fuel prices and both on-road (actual) fleet fuel intensity and new-car test fuel intensity. There is also a clear relationship between the fuel prices and both <b>fuel</b> <b>use</b> per car and <b>fuel</b> <b>use</b> per capita. Although the paper focuses on price effects, it discusses other determinants of <b>fuel</b> <b>use.</b> An important new element in the study is the quantification of the components of the differences in automobile <b>fuel</b> <b>use.</b> In particular, the authors have been able to develop comparable time series of numbers of vehicles, driving distances, and fuel intensity by fuel type. The discussion is focused on what the international data imply for <b>fuel</b> <b>use</b> in the USA, with particular emphasis on the comparison with Europe.

40|$|We {{review the}} {{circularity}} between estimates of automobile <b>use,</b> <b>fuel</b> consumption and fuel intensity.

40|$|Abstract Background In the {{backdrop}} of conflicting reports (some studies reported adverse outcomes of biomass <b>fuel</b> <b>use</b> whereas few studies reported absence of any association between adverse health effect and <b>fuel</b> <b>use,</b> {{may be due to}} presence of large number of confounding variables) on the respiratory health effects of biomass <b>fuel</b> <b>use,</b> this cross sectional survey was undertaken to understand the role of <b>fuel</b> <b>use</b> on pulmonary function. Method This study was conducted in a village of western India involving 369 randomly selected adult subjects (165 male and 204 female). All the subjects were interviewed and were subjected to pulmonary function test. Analysis of covariance was performed to compare the levels of different pulmonary function test parameters in relation to different <b>fuel</b> <b>use</b> taking care of the role of possible confounding factors.

40|$|Transport <b>fuel</b> <b>use</b> {{responds}} {{negatively to}} price increases (in both {{the short and}} the long run), and positively to population and income increases, according to this report, which describes the differing effects across the various transport modes. In the short run, car <b>fuel</b> <b>use</b> declines about 1. 5 per cent with a 10 per cent increase in the petrol price. This rises to about a 4 per cent decline when long-run demand and technology adjustments are made. As {{the average age of}} the car fleet is about 10 years, the long run stretches to 15 years and beyond. It is possible that the long-run responsiveness to radically higher fuel prices could even be greater, given threshold effects on consumer choices and technological development. International studies have suggested a response to significantly higher fuel prices of up to — 0. 7, combining demand and supply side (technology) changes (see References). Truck <b>fuel</b> <b>use</b> is more price-inelastic over the long term than car <b>fuel</b> <b>use.</b> Freight costs comprise 5 to 10 per cent of final goods costs and even at current (June 2008) freight rates, <b>fuel</b> <b>use</b> accounts for only about 30 per cent of freight rates. There is also a very low elasticity of substitution between long distance road and intercapital rail. Trucking <b>fuel</b> <b>use</b> (and activity) also increases more strongly with economic and income growth than does car <b>fuel</b> <b>use.</b> Bulk rail <b>fuel</b> <b>use</b> (most of rail freight) has a growth trend driven largely by commodity export increases and is thereby closely linked to world economic growth. It has a very low response to changes in its fuel costs, as these are built into export prices very rapidly. Aviation <b>fuel</b> <b>use,</b> like road freight and light commercial vehicle use, is considerably faster growing than car <b>fuel</b> <b>use,</b> as aviation travel responds strongly to rising incomes and economic growth. Nevertheless, for domestic aviation <b>fuel</b> <b>use,</b> a 10 per cent increase in aviation turbine fuel prices could be expected to result in a 2 per cent decline in passenger travel. International aviation <b>fuel</b> <b>use</b> is more <b>fuel</b> price elastic, reflecting the more ‘discretionary’ character of some tourism, business and family reunion travel; a 10 per cent increase in aviation turbine fuel could potentially result in a 6 per cent decline in passenger numbers...|$|R

The effect of biomass <b>fuel</b> <b>use</b> on cardiac geometry and function has not been well described. Our objective was to determine the association between air pollution from biomass <b>fuel</b> <b>use</b> with cardiac structure and function by transthoracic echocardiography. Methods: We identified a random sample of residents living in the high-altitude region of Puno, Peru. Daily biomass <b>fuel</b> <b>use</b> was self-reported in a questionnaire. Each participant underwent transthoracic echocardiography. Multivariable linear regression analyses were used {{to examine the relationship between}} biomass <b>fuel</b> <b>use</b> with each echocardiographic variable, adjusting for age, sex, height, body mass index, diabetes, physical activity, and tobacco use. Results: 187 participants were included in this analysis; 80 biomass fuel users and 107 nonusers. Fifty-eight percent of the participants were women. After adjusting for multiple variables, daily exposure to biomass fuel smoke was associated with increased left ventricular internal diastolic diameter, left atrial diameter, left atrial area (4 -chamber and 2 -chamber), septal E', and lateral E'. There was no relationship between biomass <b>fuel</b> <b>use</b> with left ventricular systolic function or right ventricular size or function. Conclusion: Daily biomass <b>fuel</b> <b>use</b> was associated with increased left ventricular and left atrial size in a population-based sample of individuals living at high-altitude in Puno, Peru. This difference in cardiac structure potentially increases the risk for multiple adverse cardiovascular outcomes in biomass fuel users.
