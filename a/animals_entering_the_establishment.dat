2500|$|A no-kill {{or limited}} admit shelter is a shelter that save healthy, treatable and rehabilitatable animals. [...] As a benchmark, at least 90% of <b>the</b> <b>animals</b> <b>entering</b> <b>the</b> shelter are {{expected}} to be saved. The save rate must be based on all <b>animals</b> <b>entering</b> <b>the</b> shelter: [...] "It does not matter if the animals are old, blind, deaf, missing limbs, or traumatized. All of these animals are worthy of our compassion, all of them can find homes, and all of them deserve to." ...|$|R
50|$|He painted portraits, {{historical}} {{pieces and}} landscapes, but chiefly excelled in fairs, markets and rural scenes with animals. Noahs ark and <b>the</b> <b>animals</b> <b>entering</b> <b>the</b> Ark {{was a favorite}} subject of his.|$|R
60|$|During {{this season}} of folly and frolic, {{there was an}} alarm of mad wolves in the two lower camps. One {{or more of these}} <b>animals</b> <b>entered</b> <b>the</b> camps for three nights successively, and bit several of the people.|$|R

50|$|<b>The</b> {{majority}} of <b>animals</b> <b>entering</b> <b>the</b> program are unwanted and/or abandoned dogs rescued from animal shelters. Each dog undergoes a comprehensive health assessment and a behavioral/training assessment. Dogs are then assigned a trainer {{and begin the}} 9- to 12-month training program.|$|R
40|$|Data are pooled and {{analyzed}} to differentiate the value between "packer " and "feeder" type cattle. Results indicate that <b>the</b> value of <b>animals</b> <b>entering</b> <b>the</b> stocker and feeding {{stages of the}} industry are sensitive to gender, color, breedtype, body condition, and {{the presence or absence}} of brands and/or horns...|$|R

6000|$|... "I'm going in," [...] said Dick {{in a low}} tone. [...] "Wait for me here," [...] and he <b>entered</b> <b>the</b> <b>establishment.</b> There were {{counters}} an both sides, and {{he walked}} to a position directly opposite to that occupied by the ex-schoolmaster.|$|R
50|$|The No Kill Equation {{consists}} of eleven essential elements identified by animal advocate Nathan Winograd {{for creating a}} No Kill Community: where the animal control agency does not put to death any healthy or treatable companion animals. As a benchmark, at least 90% of <b>the</b> <b>animals</b> <b>entering</b> <b>the</b> shelter {{are expected to be}} saved.|$|R
50|$|In 2009, the {{television}} program Underbelly: A Tale of Two Cities shows men {{taking part in}} games of two-up.

50|$|The model {{includes}} {{a set of}} tactics that, in combination, reduce <b>the</b> number of <b>animals</b> <b>entering</b> <b>the</b> shelter system and place most shelter animals in permanent homes. Some of these tactics are mobile adoption outreach units, aggressive early spay-neuter programs, medical treatment for treatable shelter animals, behavioral training in the shelter, training classes for the public, and structured adoption screening and matching.|$|R
50|$|The Gulf Trough closed between Georgia and Florida {{forming the}} {{complete}} peninsula allowing southward movement of Florida's first land mammals {{such as the}} early canids Enhydrocyon, Osbornodon, and Phlaocyon preying upon the proto-horse Miohippus, deer-like Hypertragulidae, and the extinct camel, Nothokemas. The fossil record shows that land <b>animals</b> <b>entered</b> <b>the</b> newly formed peninsula with the earliest land mammals unearthed in Hernando, County dating from ~24.8 Ma.|$|R
50|$|A rat cage trap is a metal cage {{box-shaped}} {{device that}} is designed primarily to catch rats without killing them. Food bait (not poisoned) is put in the cage trap. When an <b>animal</b> <b>enters</b> <b>the</b> cage and moves toward the bait, the mechanism triggers and closes a door over the entry point. The animal is caught alive and without injury. The animal can be transported and released elsewhere or subsequently killed.|$|R
50|$|Because the {{rabies virus}} {{is almost always}} caught from animals, rabies {{eradication}} has focused on reducing the population of wild and stray animals, controls and compulsory quarantine on <b>animals</b> <b>entering</b> <b>the</b> country, and vaccination of pets and wild animals. Many island nations, including Iceland, Ireland, Japan, Malta, and the United Kingdom, managed to eliminate rabies during the twentieth century, and more recently much of continental Europe has been declared rabies-free.|$|R
50|$|The 1934 ballet Bar aux Folies-Bergère with choreography by Ninette de Valois {{and music}} of Chabrier was created from, and based around, Manet's painting. The 1947 film The Private Affairs of Bel Ami {{faithfully}} references A Bar at the Folies-Bergère twenty nine {{minutes into the}} film with a look-alike actress, set and props as <b>the</b> main characters <b>enter</b> <b>the</b> <b>establishment.</b>|$|R

Innate immune response, or innate immunity, could immediately {{act as the}} first line of defense against various pathogens and do not involve the activation of antigen-specific lymphocytes. Innate immunity is sufficient to prevent the body from being routinely overwhelmed by a wide range of microorganisms that live on or in it (Kenneth, 2011).|$|R
2500|$|A [...] "no-kill" [...] shelter is {{an animal}} shelter {{that does not}} kill healthy or treatable animals even when the shelter is full, reserving {{euthanasia}} for terminally ill animals or those considered dangerous to public safety. A no-kill shelter uses many strategies to promote shelter animals; to expanding its resources using volunteers, excellent housing and medical protocols; and to work actively to lower the number of homeless <b>animals</b> <b>entering</b> <b>the</b> shelter system.|$|R

50|$|Unusual {{changes to}} low-elevation {{ecosystems}} caused {{the downfall of}} many if not all major forest birds on Kauaʻi. These changes began when the first Polynesians settled {{on the island and}} cleared some of the healthy land for crops. With every new settler, invasive plants and <b>animals</b> <b>entered</b> <b>the</b> Hawaiian Islands. Today, only about 40000 acre of Kauaʻi have not been drastically altered. Many avian diseases and parasites also pose a major threat to Hawaiʻi's forest birds.|$|R

6000|$|When <b>the</b> <b>animals</b> <b>entered</b> <b>the</b> Ark in pairs, one may {{imagine that}} allied species made much private remark on each other, and were tempted {{to think that}} so many forms feeding on the same store of fodder were eminently superfluous, as tending to {{diminish}} the rations. (I fear the part played by the vultures on that occasion would be too painful for art to represent, those birds being disadvantageously naked about the gullet, and apparently without rites and ceremonies.) ...|$|R
5000|$|He {{was born}} in Edinburgh in 1797, and in 1809 was apprenticed to the {{publisher}} Adam Black.

The Nawab of Malerkotla, Sher Khan opposed {{the killing of the}} younger sons of the 10th master Sri Guru Gobind Singh at Sirhind. This is known as Ha Da Nahra ("Voice against oppression.") The Sikhs felt that Sri Guru Gobind Singh had pardoned the Nawab. In lieu of this, Malerkotla was not displaced. Many people and <b>animals</b> <b>entered</b> <b>the</b> city for protection during Partition.|$|R
50|$|The {{organization}} provides animal sheltering to {{the town}} of Cochrane, Alberta and the surrounding communities. It is an open door shelter, in that no animal is turned away. The organization's policy is to euthanize {{only as a last resort}} for humane or public safety reasons. The organization stated in 2011 that it has been able to save more than 90% of <b>the</b> <b>animals</b> <b>entering</b> <b>the</b> shelter since its founding in 1998. Statistics reported for 2013 indicated save rates of 90.3% for dogs and 91.8% for cats.|$|R
5000|$|Most casinos {{are obliged}} to have an {{extensive}} array of security cameras and recorders which monitor and record all the action in a casino, {{which can be used}} to resolve some disputes. Some casinos use facial recognition software to detect known cheats, card counters or [...] "advantage players" [...] as they <b>enter</b> <b>the</b> <b>establishment.</b> Casinos can also use software to analyze game play, to uncover any unusual patterns in betting or payouts. It is usual to preserve recordings for lengthy periods of time.|$|R
5000|$|The National Council on Pet Population Study and Policy {{conducted}} a survey over four years, 1994-1997, and cautions {{against the use of}} their survey for wider estimates: [...] "It is not possible to use these statistics to estimate <b>the</b> numbers of <b>animals</b> <b>entering</b> <b>animal</b> shelters in <b>the</b> United States, or the numbers euthanized on an annual basis. The reporting Shelters may not represent a random sampling of U.S. shelters." [...] Summary statistics from the survey state that in 1997, 4.3 million <b>animals</b> <b>entered</b> <b>the</b> surveyed shelters; the shelters euthanized 62.6% of them, or 2.8 million animals. These numbers broke down to 56.4% of dogs euthanized, and 71% of cats. The original survey was sent to 5,042 shelters housing at least 100 dogs and cats each year, of whom only 1,008 shelters participated in 1997.|$|R
50|$|After {{they have}} finished, Angela insists the two go somewhere {{because she has}} {{something}} important to show Tycho. She takes him to an expensive cafe where they wait, though Angela will not tell Tycho what for. Eventually a man <b>enters</b> <b>the</b> <b>establishment</b> and Tycho immediately notices the resemblance between him and Angela - his is in fact Roland Chase, Angela's father, and owner of a large company. Angela stands up and her father, previously unaware she was there, catches sight of her. He does not look pleased.|$|R
40|$|The {{original}} publication {{is available}} at [URL] South Africa, very little research on motor vehicle accidents involving animals has been done. Transport networks expand while traffic volumes and speed increases. <b>Animals</b> <b>entering</b> <b>the</b> road reserve pose dangers to vehicles. In the Eastern Cape, {{the presence of an}} abundance of kudu creates hazardous driving conditions for motorists. For collision prevention and <b>the</b> <b>establishment</b> of public awareness programmes, it is imperative to identify hazardous sections. In this study road traffic collision reports of a chosen route in the Eastern Cape were analysed. It was determined that the presence of long stretches of game proof fences partially clustered the spatial distribution of collision sites. Road trajectories with few or no game proof fences displayed a random distribution of collision sites. “Hotspots” were identified on which traffic authorities can focus mitigating and preventative measures.

Police, {{almost all of them}} male, <b>entered</b> <b>the</b> <b>establishment</b> and walked around, taking the names and {{addresses}} of some 10 women and [...] "aggressively questioned" [...] volunteers. A Pussy Palace organizer stated “any women at the event were deeply angered and traumatized”. A judge of the Ontario Court of Justice held that the police had violated the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms by using male police officers in the raid, describing the police actions as analogous to a strip search.|$|R
