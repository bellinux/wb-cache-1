50|$|Pomerantz saw the {{potential}} of the South Pole as an observing platform remarkably early. Its proximity to the South magnetic pole of the Earth means that charged cosmic rays can be detected there without the deflections they experience when detected at lower <b>latitudes.</b> <b>Astronomical</b> observations near the Earth's poles can be done over long periods, without the diurnal variations at lower latitudes. The South Pole is at an altitude of nearly 3000 m, so the astronomical seeing should be comparable to other high-altitude observatories; the extreme cold in Antarctica also corresponds to relatively little water vapor in the atmosphere there, which is a particular advantage for infrared astronomy. Finally, the South Pole lies {{at the top of a}} very deep, nearly permanent ice sheet that has been used to advantage in experiments such as the IceCube Neutrino Detector.|$|R

40|$|Optical {{observations}} from a ground-based astrometric instrument provide a {{unique set of}} data sensitive to variations of local plumb line, which represent the change of local gravitational field on the ground. The local gravitational change could be caused by density variation or movement of underground mass in addition to tidal action. Earthquake was found to be related with gravitational change. A seismic zone could have abnormal underground material density, causing the variation of plume line on the ground. In this frame, the astrometric telescope can measure the variation of local plumb line by observing the local <b>astronomical</b> longitudes and <b>latitudes</b> from stars in the Hipparcos catalog. In this study, we estimate the deflection angle of the plumb line on a ground site, and give a relation between the angle, abnormal mass and site distance (depth and horizontal distance). Then we derive the abnormality of underground material density using the plumb lines measured at different sites, and study the earthquake gestation, development and occurrence. Using the deflection angles of plumb lines observed at two sites, we give a method to calculate the mass and the center of gravity of underground materials. We also estimate the abnormal masses of latent seismic zones with different energy, using thermodynamic relations, and introduce a new optical astrometric instrument we had developed...|$|R

Again his work was carried on far into the winter season under adverse conditions, and in December and January, 1849-'50, we find him engaged in geodetic and magnetic observations at and off Cape Florida. After some summer field-work {{on the coast of}} New England, he returned in September to take charge of the computing department of the Coast Survey office, in which he continued through the years 1851-'52-'53. The efficient condition of that department during that time is specially referred to by the assistants in charge of the office, Captain Benham and Major Stevens, the latter saving:"It affords me unusual gratification to acknowledge the services of Mr. Hilgard, in charge of the computing department, and to commend the zeal, promptitude, and accuracy of every member of that department."After 1853, while still continuing to have the supervision of the computing department, he was frequently detailed for work of special importance or difficulty, such as the measurement of bases, the testing and discussion of the errors of instruments, etc. On the 31st of March, 1854, while engaged in work on the Dauphin island base, the schooner Phoenix, with the entire party on board, was capsized in a squall and sunk to the topmast, on which the party took refuge, afterward escaping in a boat at considerable peril of their lives.

Most {{of our knowledge}} of it comes from Strabo, according to whom Hipparchus thoroughly and often unfairly criticized Eratosthenes mainly for internal contradictions and inaccuracy in determining positions of geographical localities. Hipparchus insists that a geographic map must be based only on <b>astronomical</b> measurements of <b>latitudes</b> and longitudes and triangulation for finding unknown distances. In geographic theory and methods Hipparchus introduced three main innovations.He {{was the first to}} use the grade grid, to determine geographic latitude from star observations, and not only from the sun’s altitude, a method known long before him, and to suggest that geographic longitude could be determined by means of simultaneous observations of lunar eclipses in distant places. In the practical part of his work, the so-called [...] "table of climata", Hipparchus listed latitudes for several tens of localities. In particular, he improved Eratosthenes' values for the latitudes of Athens, Sicily, and southern extremity of India. In calculating latitudes of climata (latitudes correlated with the length of the longest solstitial day), Hipparchus used an unexpectedly accurate value for the obliquity of the ecliptic, 23°40′ (the actual value {{in the second half of}} the 2nd century [...] was approximately 23°43′), whereas all other ancient authors knew only a roughly rounded value 24°, and even Ptolemy used a less accurate value, 23°51′. Hipparchus opposed the view generally accepted in the Hellenistic period that the Atlantic and Indian Oceans and the Caspian Sea are parts of a single ocean. At the same time he extends the limits of the oikoumene, i.e. the inhabited part of the land, up to the equator and the Arctic Circle. Hipparchus’ ideas found their reflection in the Geography of Ptolemy. In essence, Ptolemy's work is an extended attempt to realize Hipparchus’ vision of what geography ought to be.|$|R

After the appropriate processing of the data, an accuracy of sigma(Phi) =sigma(A) =+/- 0 ". 01, sigma(A) =+/- 0 ". 2 may be achieved for the determination of the astronomical coordinates and azimuth. The developed system compares favourably to older classical ones, due to its compactness and the accuracy obtained within a short period of time.

40|$|A {{brief and}} {{simplified}} overview of optical gyroscopes is presented {{with emphasis on}} recent developments in passive approaches. Why the Interest in Rotation Sensors? The measurement of rotation is of considerable interest {{in a number of}} areas. For example, inertial navigation systems as used in aircraft and spacecraft depend critically on accurate inertial rotation sensors. The allowable errors in rotation sensor performance depend on the particular application. Typical requirements for aircraft navigation lie be-tween 0. 01 and 0. 001 degrees /hour. In terms of earth rotation rate QE = 15 degrees /hour this becomes 10 - 3 to l 0 - 4 QE. A number of other applications of rotation sensors exist such as surveying where the accurate determination of azimuth and geodetic latitude is important [1]. In this case performance of 10 - 6 QE or better is needed. Geophysics appli-cations include the determination of <b>astronomical</b> <b>latitude,</b> and the monitoring of polar motion caused by wobble, rotation, precession and wandering effects [1].
