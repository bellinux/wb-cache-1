5000|$|Amtgard also {{utilizes}} armor for {{a number}} of classes. Armor grants anywhere from 1 to 6 points to a covered hit location. <b>Armor</b> <b>receives</b> a rating based on the type of armor and materials and techniques used to construct it. Each class is able to wear armor ranging from 0 to 6 points. A player may wear armor that is rated higher than the maximum allowed by their class, but it only grants armor up to the class maximum. Regular weapon hits to covered locations remove a single point of armor, however, several classes, spells and creatures are able to remove additional points per blow. Combat involving armor is simple in Amtgard. There are essentially three kinds of damage armor may be subject to. Normal melee attacks remove a single point. Armor breaking attacks will remove one point of armor from a location with more than three points, and all remaining points from a location with 3 or less points. An armor destroying attack will remove all armor from a location struck. Other class abilities enhance all armor worn to [...] "Ancestral Armor", which is removed one point at a time, regardless of the type of damage it is being struck with. As armor in Amtgard is not physically functional, realism and aesthetics are encouraged with armor in Amtgard, in order to enhance atmosphere and balance the substantial benefits offered by armor. Non-period, modern-looking materials and shoddy construction can reduce the protection granted by the armor.|$|R

Two years later he {{enrolled}} to the Moscow State University, graduating in 1936. Being a specialist in properties of metals and an aviation engineer, he was sent to the Soviet Army in 1940, but in 1942 recalled from the front to the laboratories of the Soviet Academy of Sciences. During those World War II years he defended a PhD (1943) and developed a pulsed X-ray radiography method for real-time analysis of damage induced by a projectile to the tank <b>armor,</b> <b>receiving</b> the State Prize for this work in 1946. The same year he was assigned to the Soviet atomic bomb project. Between 1946 and 1969 he worked at the Soviet Nuclear Center Arzamas-16 under top secret conditions, defending a habilitation in 1954. His administrative promotions were hampered by his outspoken nature, as he publicly opposed some official views and policies. In 1969 he returned to Moscow, assuming a position of department head at the Institute of Optical-Physical Measurements. Twenty years later he became a Chief Researcher at the Institute for High Energy Densities of the Russian Academy of Sciences.

Upon the company's arrival in Vietnam, a fourth line platoon was added; this was equipped with M106 4.2 in. mortar carriers (modified M113s). The mortar platoon often operated with Brigade infantry units to provide indirect fire support. It also deployed at times as a dismounted infantry unit. The remaining SPATS platoon was reequipped with M113s in late 1966 and the mortar platoon was deactivated in early 1967. From early 1967, D/16th had three line platoons equipped with M113s and eventually, its diesel version, the M113A1. It also standardized in late 1968 with three machine guns per track, one M2 [...]50 caliber and two M60 machine guns mounted on each side. After several years, the machine gun array varied considerably from APC to APC. The company conducted search and destroy missions, road and firebase security. Twenty-five D/16th paratroopers were killed in action and many more were wounded during the course of the war. Sixteenth Division's largest battle took place on 4 March 1968 at North Tuy Hoa.
