25|$|In July 1917, after {{consulting}} with architectural and artistic experts in London, Ware invited Edwin Lutyens and Herbert Baker, architects; Charles Aitken, {{director of the}} Tate Gallery; and author Sir James Barrie to tour British battlefield cemeteries near the front {{in an attempt to}} formulate broad ideas for the post-war design of these burying grounds. The trip began on 9 July. The group met formally on 14 July after the trip ended. Ware, Lutyens, and Baker agreed that every cemetery ought to obey a general theme (although the theme was not yet established), that there should only be four variations on the theme (monumental, garden or woodland, village, and town cemeteries), that grave markers should be uniform headstones (not crosses), and that cemetery walls should be horizontal. Aitken insisted on cemeteries of simple design and low cost, feeling public money should be spent on practical items like schools and hospitals. Baker wanted a cross at each cemetery, but Lutyens wanted a more <b>abstract</b> <b>symbol.</b> Aitken supported Baker in thinking that a cross was more appropriate in the French countryside. At one point, Baker suggested a cross with a pentagonal shaft (one side for each self-governing dominion), and for Indian cemeteries a column topped by appropriate symbol (such as the dharmacakra or Star of India).|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a formal approach to specify and verify object-oriented programs {{written in the}} `programming to interfaces' paradigm. Besides the methods to be invoked by its clients, an interface also declares a set of <b>abstract</b> function/predicate <b>symbols,</b> together {{with a set of}} constraints on these symbols. For each method declared in this interface, a specification template is given using these <b>abstract</b> <b>symbols.</b> A class implementing this interface can give its own definitions to the <b>abstract</b> <b>symbols,</b> as long as all the constraints are satisfied. This class implements all the methods declared in the interface such that the method specification templates declared in the interface are satisfied w. r. t. the definitions of the <b>abstract</b> function <b>symbols</b> in this class. Based on the constraints on the <b>abstract</b> <b>symbols,</b> the client code using interfaces can be specified and verified precisely without knowing what classes implement these interfaces. Given more information about the implementing classes, the specifications of the client code can be specialized into more precise ones without re-verifying the client code. Several commonly used interfaces and their implementations (including Iterator, Observer, Comparable, and Comparator) are used to demonstrate that the approach in this paper is both precise and flexible.

40|$|The {{precursor}} to the relational evaluation procedure (pREP) is a go/no-go successive discrimination procedure for examining stimulus equivalence. Previous {{research has shown that}} it does not readily produce equivalence responding unless some matching-to-sample (MTS) procedures are incorporated into the experimental sequence. Two experiments attempted to identify contextual cues that would generate equivalence responding on the pREP. Experiment 1 examined the effects of using <b>abstract</b> <b>symbols</b> or various verbal labels as response options on the pREP. Only the words same and different, when used as response options, reliably produced equivalence responding across 4 subjects. Experiment 2 examined different pretraining preparations designed to attach the functions of the words same and different to <b>abstract</b> <b>symbols</b> that could then be used as response options on the pREP. The most effective pretraining procedure involved multiple-exemplar training during which subjects were trained to respond to <b>abstract</b> <b>symbols</b> in the presence of pairs of stimuli that were either formally the same or different. The <b>abstract</b> <b>symbols</b> were subsequently used as response options with the pREP, and all subjects reliably demonstrated equivalence responding. The findings suggest that the relations of same and different may be fundamental to equivalence responding. These findings are discussed {{in terms of what they}} suggest about the nature of the equivalence phenomenon specifically and derived relational responding more generally...|$|R

50|$|Tangible {{symbols are}} {{a type of}} augmentative and {{alternative}} communication (AAC) that uses objects or pictures that share a perceptual relationship with the items they represent as symbols.

Whereas a glyph was a specific graphic shape from a particular font, whether the shape represented a single character or a set of characters.

It also had another glyph to represent the ligature [...] "ﬂ", which could be automatically composed (instead of the individual glyphs) wherever the two abstract characters [...] "f" [...] and [...] "l" [...] occurred in sequence in the source text.|$|E

5000|$|This {{story begins}} with the {{performer}} preparing for a night {{out in front of}} a full length mirror. Like in Why I Go to the Gym, most dialogue is an internal narration of the character's actions and thoughts. It is also set to a recorded composition, and has roots in rap, though is not a musical number. In this piece, the performer explores the strict, intricate structure of being a gay man on the dating scene. Most of it takes place in a bar, where the character is searching for a potential partner, relishing in the music and the surrounding gay men. As he browses, he labels each man methodically, calling them by descriptive nicknames such as [...] "Upbeat & Positive", [...] "Cute & Cuddly", and [...] "Gladiator Guppie". He goes on to describe them in detail, as if on a dating profile, first starting with an acronym, either GWM (gay white male) or GBM (gay black male), then moving on to their age, height, and weight. He further describes other details like color of their hair, their body type, and lastly, what they are looking for. Each man is not only a very specific type, but also seeks another, very specific type. Though the piece begins as lighthearted and vibrant, after the performer snorts drugs it quickly escalates to an aggressive, slurred-filled tirade, directed at a soldier {{in the back of the}} audience. Towards the end, the slurs become violent and the performer pulls a hunting knife out of his pocket, according to the stage directions not as a weapon necessarily, [...] "but rather as an <b>abstract</b> <b>symbol</b> of violence".|$|E
