5|$|After {{the success}} of Mayabazar (1957), {{directed}} by Kadiri Venkata Reddy, B. Nagi Reddy and Aluri Chakrapani of Vijaya Vauhini Studios planned to make a contemporary drama. Chakrapani came up with <b>an</b> <b>idea</b> <b>about</b> conflict between two older men who are polar opposites: one a debtor evading his creditors, {{and the other a}} wealthy gentleman with an inflated sense of prestige. L. V. Prasad was chosen to direct the film; he, Chakrapani and Vempati Sadasivabrahmam developed a script entitled Appu Chesi Pappu Koodu, after a popular Telugu idiom. It was the only film from Vijaya Vauhini Studios with dialogue written by Sadasivabrahmam.|$|E
5|$|The Heinz {{executive}} {{speaks with}} Don about his daughters' obsession with The Rolling Stones, and floats <b>an</b> <b>idea</b> <b>about</b> getting The Rolling Stones to do {{a commercial for}} Heinz. Don agrees, though he is unimpressed with the idea. Harry and Don make a Saturday night trip to a Rolling Stones concert to meet with Stones manager Allen Klein. They end up making conversation backstage with two pot-smoking female fans. When Harry leaves {{with one of the}} girls to talk with Klein, Don waxes poetic with one over her love for the band. She makes an insulting comment about the older generation. Don responds that the older generation is simply worried for youth. Harry fails miserably at his attempt to meet with The Rolling Stones, but Don is indifferent.|$|E
5|$|Later that evening, Peter, Quagmire and Joe discuss killing Jeff, with Joe (as {{a police}} officer), {{against the idea}} saying that Quagmire could be arrested for murder and it doesn't matter, while Quagmire says that it does and {{explains}} that people like Jeff never change. Joe is still against the idea but when the trio witness an infuriated Jeff severely attack Brenda for simply changing the channel on Quagmire's TV, he renounces his hesitance and agrees to murder him. The three decide to talk Jeff into a hunting trip {{in an attempt to}} kill him, and make it look like an accident. Having expected it, however, Jeff reveals his own gun, and knocks Peter and Joe out so that he can kill Quagmire in a deeper part of the woods. Once there, Quagmire talks Jeff into fighting him instead, during which Quagmire is seemingly strangled to death. Jeff then goes to dig a grave to put Quagmire's body in, until he sees an angry Quagmire, alive and well, behind the wheel of Peter's car. Quagmire reveals that he chokes himself everyday and kills Jeff by running him over, smashing his head into a tree with the car. Peter, Joe and Quagmire return home the next day, and present Brenda with a forged note from Jeff stating that he has decided to leave her. As Brenda breaks down in tears over Jeff, Peter notes that he wishes he could kill someone else and gets <b>an</b> <b>idea</b> <b>about</b> Mort before the episode ends.|$|E

25|$|Phylogeny {{can give}} {{some sense of}} history when {{combined}} {{with a little bit}} more information. Each difference in the DNA indicates divergence between one species and another. This divergence, whether via drift or natural selection, is representative of some lapse of time. Comparing DNA sequences alone gives a record of the history of evolution with an arbitrary measure of phylogenetic distance “dating” that last common ancestor. However, if information about the rate of genetic mutation is available or geologic markers are present to calibrate evolutionary divergence (i.e. fossils), we have a timeline of evolution. From there, with <b>an</b> <b>idea</b> <b>about</b> other contemporaneous changes in life and environment, we can begin to speculate why certain evolutionary paths might have been selected for.|$|E

25|$|These {{two events}} helped create <b>an</b> <b>idea</b> <b>about</b> North among the Pawnee Scouts as having supernatural powers and being invulnerable to harm. The scouts served distinctively in the Battle of the Tongue River on August 29. In the fight, about 200 United States {{soldiers}} and 70 Indian Scouts (including 30 of the Pawnee) captured an Arapaho village containing about 500 people, mostly women and children, under Medicine Man. The few Arapaho warriors counterattacked but were repulsed by the soldiers' repeating carbine's and mountain howitzer's fire. Sixty-three Arapahos, mostly unarmed noncombatants {{were killed and}} eighteen {{women and children were}} captured and later released. Additionally, hundreds of Arapaho horses and ponies were shot after the battle. Five U.S. soldiers and Indian Scouts were killed or mortally wounded and an additional two were wounded in the battle.|$|E
25|$|Even {{though both}} Junker Ove and Hilda suspect {{that they are}} in the wrong place in their lives as the story begins, they are not able to act on their own initiative. The dream gives Hilda an inkling of this other life, and the dream by the hill gives Junker Ove <b>an</b> <b>idea</b> <b>about</b> the ideal woman, but it is the {{crucifix}} and the golden goblet, two Christian symbols, which reveal the truth of the matter. Christianity is to be thanked for the restoration of harmony. Junker Ove gets his Hilda, and the promise of gold persuades Sir Mogens to be united with Birthe who, in a modern interpretation, represents the young woman with the unruly disposition unable to conform to society's norms. She is handed over - troll for gold - to Sir Mogens in order to continue her life somewhere else completely.|$|E
25|$|The Hongwu Emperor was {{wary of the}} {{political}} and social consequences that the maritime commerce could bring, so he sought to restrain it by outlawing private maritime trade. This policy continued well into the Yongle Emperor's reign. However, the Yongle Emperor himself aimed at consolidating imperial control over the maritime commerce, stopping the coastal criminality and disorder, providing employment for mariners and entrepreneurs, exporting Chinese products to foreign markets, importing desired goods for Chinese consumers, extending the tributary system, and displaying imperial majesty to the seas. The voyages functioned as trade commissions in the government's attempts of regulating the private maritime commerce by establishing an imperial monopoly over it and incorporate it into the tributary system. There was seemingly some sort of <b>an</b> <b>idea</b> <b>about</b> a foreign policy comprising an extended foreign trade, which came to be supported by a heavy military naval presence and a cultivation of shared interests with local allies.|$|E

25|$|Heading {{right for}} the junks, Canton opened up with her guns {{and by the time}} she was {{receiving}} enemy fire, Hay's ship came within range and engaged. After a few more minutes of accurate fire, Chui A-poo's fleet scattered and three junks were abandoned by their crews, most of whom drowned as their vessels were sunk around them. Towards the end of the engagement, shots from the Columbine hit one of the larger junks and it exploded, sending up a large plume of smoke. Ten junks escaped the battle due to the British who chose not to continue the chase for they had <b>an</b> <b>idea</b> <b>about</b> where the brigands were going. The British had already been at station non-stop for forty hours, another reason for abandoning the pursuit. Chui A-poo's pirates were reported to have suffered 250 casualties and a total of over 200 cannon were destroyed or captured and then taken back to Hong Kong. Three Royal Navy sailors were killed on the Columbine and one officer and six men wounded.|$|E

500|$|In early June before {{starting}} recording, Orbit met Madonna {{at her house}} in New York, and she played him the music she had worked on with other producers up to May 1997, which he felt sounded [...] "slick". They visited the Hit Factory later that week, where Madonna invited the producer to work on Ray of Light. Orbit then sent her a tape of musical snippets he was working on, which were usually eight or sixteen-bar phrases and stripped down versions of tracks that would later be heard on the album. Madonna listened to the samples, over and over again, until she was inspired to write lyrics. Once she had <b>an</b> <b>idea</b> <b>about</b> the lyrical direction of the song, she would take her ideas back to Orbit, and they would expand on the original music ideas. As most of the tracks pre-existed, Madonna worked on the lyrics while at home or while travelling.|$|E
500|$|In 1746, a {{group of}} {{publishers}} approached Johnson with <b>an</b> <b>idea</b> <b>about</b> creating an authoritative dictionary of the English language.

[...] Although he did not succeed in completing the work in three years, he did manage to finish it in eight.
