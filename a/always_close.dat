5|$|Rutherford Birchard Hayes {{was born}} in Delaware, Ohio, on October 4, 1822, the son of Rutherford Hayes, Jr. and Sophia Birchard. Hayes's father, a Vermont storekeeper, took the family to Ohio in 1817. He died ten weeks before Rutherford's birth. Sophia {{took charge of the}} family, {{bringing}} up Hayes and his sister, Fanny, the only two of their four children to survive to adulthood. She never remarried; Sophia's younger brother, Sardis Birchard, lived with the family for a time. He was <b>always</b> <b>close</b> to Hayes and became a father figure to him, contributing to his early education.|$|E
5|$|The Countess {{was left}} rich under Leicester's will; yet the {{discharge}} of his overwhelming debts diminished her wealth. In 1604–1605 she successfully defended her widow's rights in court when her possessions and her good name were threatened by the Earl's illegitimate son, Robert Dudley, who claimed that he was his father's legitimate heir, thus implicitly declaring her marriage bigamous. Lettice Knollys was <b>always</b> <b>close</b> to her large family circle. Helpless at the political eclipse of her eldest son, the second Earl of Essex, she lost both him and her third husband to the executioner in 1601. From the 1590s she lived chiefly in the Staffordshire countryside, where, in reasonably good health until the end, she died at age 91 on Christmas Day 1634.|$|E

In 2008, two other residences were opened near the Des Bourtoulets Quarter, Boulevard des Tilleuls and the station: The Villalodge du Parc, consisting of 16 villas and 54 apartments, and the residence of la Cheneraie, consisting of 62 apartments spread over four-storey buildings. Finally, north of the town, {{on the road to}} Galan, the Bastide de Piquegrue was created in 2009. It contains 34 semi-detached villas.|$|E
25|$|When {{the prince}} became Amir in 1919 and {{subsequently}} King in 1926, the queen {{had an important}} role in the evolution of the Country and was <b>always</b> <b>close</b> to her husband. He had her take part in all national events. He was said, ”I am your king, but the Minister of Education is my wife—your Queen”. Queen Soraya was the first Muslim consort who appeared in public together with her husband, something which was unheard of at the time. She participated with him in the hunting parties, riding on horseback, and in some Cabinet meetings. She was present at military parades with the king. During the war of Independence, she visited the tents of wounded soldiers, talked to them, offered them presents and comfort. She accompanied the king even in some rebellious provinces of the country, something which was a very dangerous thing to do at that time.|$|E

25|$|The {{enlargement}} of the thoracic cavity's vertical dimension by the contraction of the diaphragm, and its two horizontal dimensions by {{the lifting of the}} front and sides of the ribs, causes the intrathoracic pressure to fall. The lungs' interiors are open to the outside air, and being elastic, therefore expand to fill the increased space. The inflow of air into the lungs occurs via the respiratory airways (Fig. 2). In health these airways (starting at the nose or mouth, and ending in the microscopic dead-end sacs called alveoli) are always open, though the diameters of the various sections can be changed by the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems. The alveolar air pressure is therefore <b>always</b> <b>close</b> to atmospheric air pressure (about 100kPa at sea level) at rest, with the pressure gradients that cause air to move {{in and out of the}} lungs during breathing rarely exceeding 2–3kPa.|$|E
25|$|Another rival of Tipperary is Cork in the Munster Championship. These {{teams have}} met 80 {{times in the}} championship, {{more than any other}} rivalry in hurling. They have also met them countless times in the National League and {{pre-season}} challenge tournaments. A Tipp and Cork Munster hurling final in Semple Stadium is often claimed by supporters of both counties to be the most traditional Munster final and the games between them are nearly <b>always</b> <b>close.</b> The draw and replay games of 1987 and 1991 and the 1949–1954 rivalry encapsulates this rivalry and the 1991 replayed final in Thurles is claimed {{to be one of the}} greatest Munster hurling finals. This is one of the few rivalries in the provincial championships that is contested by two teams of similar stature whose honours and titles complement each other on a fairly equal basis. Kilkenny and Wexford in hurling have major difference in titles and in football, Dublin and Meath also have a gap between their respective winnings. The football teams of Galway and Mayo enjoy a similar rivalry and whose honours are divided in equal measure.|$|E
25|$|A Scheffler cooker (named {{after its}} inventor, Wolfgang Scheffler) uses a large ideally {{paraboloidal}} reflector which is rotated around an axis that is {{parallel with the}} earth's using a mechanical mechanism, turning at 15 degrees per hour {{to compensate for the}} earth's rotation. The axis passes through the reflector's centre of mass, allowing the reflector to be turned easily. The cooking vessel is located at the focus which is on the axis of rotation, so the mirror concentrates sunlight onto it all day. The mirror has to be occasionally tilted about a perpendicular axis to compensate for the seasonal variation in the sun's declination. This perpendicular axis does not pass through the cooking vessel. Therefore, if the reflector were a rigid paraboloid, its focus would not remain stationary at the cooking vessel as the reflector tilts. To keep the focus stationary, the reflector's shape has to vary. It remains paraboloidal, but its focal length and other parameters change as it tilts. The Scheffler reflector is therefore flexible, and can be bent to adjust its shape. It is often made up {{of a large number of}} small plane sections, such as glass mirrors, joined together by flexible plastic. A framework that supports the reflector includes a mechanism that can be used to tilt it and also bend it appropriately. The mirror is never exactly paraboloidal, but it is <b>always</b> <b>close</b> enough for cooking purposes.|$|E

500|$|The ten {{bases of}} merit are {{very popular in}} Buddhist countries. In China, other similar lists are also well-known. In Thai Buddhism, the word [...] "merit" [...] (...) is often {{combined}} with [...] "to do, to make" [...] (...) , and this expression is frequently used, especially in relation to giving. In Buddhist societies, such merit-making is common, especially those meritorious deeds which are connected to monks and temples. In this regard, there is a saying in Burma, [...] "Your hands are <b>always</b> <b>close</b> to offering donations". Contrary to popular conceptions, merit-making is done by both monastics and laypeople alike. Buddhist monks or lay Buddhists earn merit through mindfulness, meditation, chanting and other rituals. Giving is the fundamental way of making merit for many laypeople, as monks {{are not allowed to}} cook by themselves. Monastics in their turn practice themselves to be a good field of merit and make merit by teaching the donors. Merit-making has thus created a symbiotic relationship between laypeople and Sangha, and the Sangha is obligated to be accessible to laypeople, for them to make merit.|$|E

Initially, the colony proved unprofitable and insufficient, with the state <b>always</b> <b>close</b> to bankruptcy. The boom in demand for natural rubber, which was abundant in the territory, created a radical shift in the 1890s—to facilitate the extraction and export of rubber, all [...] "uninhabited" [...] land in the Congo was nationalised, with the majority distributed to private companies as concessions. Some was kept by the state. Between 1891 and 1906, the companies were allowed {{to do whatever they}} wished with almost no judicial interference, the result being that forced labour and violent coercion were used to collect the rubber cheaply and maximise profit. A native paramilitary army, the Force Publique, was also created to enforce the labour policies. Individual workers who refused to participate in rubber collection could be killed and entire villages razed. Individual white administrators were also free to indulge their own sadism.|$|E
