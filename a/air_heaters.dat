40|$|Thermal {{performance}} of a single and double pass solar <b>air</b> <b>heater</b> with fins attached and using a steel wire mesh as absorber plate was investigated experimentally. The effects of {{air mass flow rate}} range between 0. 012 Â kg/s and 0. 038 Â kg/s on the outlet temperature and thermal efficiency was studied. The bed heights were 7 Â cm and 3 Â cm for the lower and upper channels respectively. Result shows that, the efficiency increase with increasing air mass flow rate. For the same flow rate, the efficiency of the double pass is found to be higher than the single pass by 7 - 19. 4 %. Maximum efficiency obtained for the single and double pass <b>air</b> <b>heater</b> was 59. 62 % and 63. 74 % respectively for air mass flow rate of 0. 038 Â kg/s.

40|$|The {{influence}} of the heating system method on greenhouse microclimate was investigated overnight, using an experimental greenhouse tunnel with a tomato crop. The heating system consisted of plastic heating pipes located close to the gutter holding the growing substrate and an <b>air</b> <b>heater,</b> located 2. 6 in above the ground. All the measurements were performed during two periods: (a) a period when only pipe heating was used; and (b) a period with pipe and air heating together. Heating pipes only could maintain the desired inside air temperature up to a temperature difference between inside and outside air of 10 degrees C, whereas this difference was increased to 15 degrees C {{with the addition of}} the <b>air</b> <b>heater.</b> Energy consumption with a system combining heating pipes and an <b>air</b> <b>heater</b> was 19 % higher. The use of the <b>air</b> <b>heater</b> enhanced the vapour pressure difference and thus the crop transpiration. For both cases crop temperature was lower than air temperature but this difference was larger with the <b>air</b> <b>heater</b> and resulted in an increase in crop aerodynamic conductance. The use of the <b>air</b> <b>heater</b> for dehumidification purposes was also investigated. It was shown that with the <b>air</b> <b>heater,</b> although the mass transfer conductance to the cover was higher, condensation flux was smaller which resulted in less condensation at the inner surface of the cover. These results indicate that the use of a mixed system is favourable in greenhouse tunnel conditions since the use of the <b>air</b> <b>heater,</b> although increasing slightly the energy consumption, improves the control of both air temperature and humidity, particularly by keeping the inside air dew point temperature lower than the cover temperature and preventing the occurrence of condensation on the plastic films.

Several <b>air</b> <b>heater</b> deposit samples were collected in the selected regions of the <b>air</b> <b>heater</b> along with samples of the feed coal, bottom ash and fly ash for comparison of ash chemistry and mineralogy. The deposit samples were examined using a combination of ash chemistry and quantitative X-ray diffraction analysis; the ash samples by bulk chemical analysis to determine the major element chemistry and mineralogy by quantitative X-ray diffraction. Samples of the deposits were also analysed using optical microscopy and QEMSCAN, an automated electron beam image analysis system. Chemical and mineralogical analysis showed that the deposits are unusual in containing high amounts of sulphate, particularly of aluminium and, to a lesser extent, iron. From the analyses it appears that the formation of the deposits is due to the high sulphate content which is acting as a cementing agent. There is an indication that temperature could be another factor in formation of the deposits, with a decrease in temperature leading to the formation of sulphurous acid which then reacts with the reactive glassy amorphous fly ash phase to form the aluminium and iron sulphates. Dew point calculations indicated that this is a possible deposit formation mechanism based upon <b>air</b> <b>heater</b> temperature data obtained from the utility. There was no evidence that unburnt carbon has {{played a significant role in}} deposit formation.

50|$|Some {{applications}} allow doing {{without the}} circulation fan and air heating altogether. If the parts being processed are fairly simply geometrically, {{it may be}} feasible to use molds which are themselves integrally heated. For example, it is feasible to manufacture flat and single-curvature light aircraft landing gear springs on inexpensive aluminum molds with electric heating pads bonded directly {{to the bottom of}} the mold. This eliminates the cost of the motor and fan as well as the <b>air</b> <b>heaters</b> and uses much less electricity than a comparable electric autoclave would require. In this way, the autoclave provides consolidation pressure alone. There are limitations to this approach, such as mold complexity. Sometimes, the parts are heated from one side only; sometimes, the mold has top and bottom parts, each fitted with heaters. Although not usually feasible in a job shop, this type of autoclave can afford significant savings when only a small range of comparatively simple parts is being made.|$|E

5000|$|As {{the formula}} shows, the COP of a {{heat pump system}} can be {{improved}} by reducing the temperature gap [...] minus [...] at which the system works. For a heating system this would mean two things: 1) reducing the output temperature to around 30 C which requires piped floor, wall or ceiling heating, or oversized water to <b>air</b> <b>heaters</b> and 2) increasing the input temperature (e.g. by using an oversized ground source or by access to a solar-assisted thermal bank [...] ). Accurately determining thermal conductivity will allow for much more precise ground loop [...] or borehole sizing, resulting in higher return temperatures and a more efficient system. For an air cooler, COP could be improved by using ground water as an input instead of air, and by reducing temperature drop on output side through increasing air flow. For both systems, also increasing the size of pipes and air canals would help to reduce noise and the energy consumption of pumps (and ventilators) by decreasing the speed of fluid which in turn lower the Re number and hence the turbulence (and noise) and the head loss (see hydraulic head). The heat pump itself can be improved by increasing {{the size of the}} internal heat exchangers which in turn increase the efficiency (and the price) relative {{to the power of the}} compressor, and also by reducing the system's internal temperature gap over the compressor. Obviously, this latter measure makes such heat pumps unsuitable to produce high temperatures which means that a separate machine is needed for producing hot tap water.|$|E
50|$|The four 500 MW boilers at Cottam Power Station are {{manufactured}} by John Thompson Water Tube Boilers Limited, {{in conjunction with}} Clarke Chapman & Co. Ltd. Each has an evaporation rate at M.C.R. of 1.542 tonne/hour (3,400 lb/hr). The boiler plant has been designed for short time overload operation. By by-passing two of the H.P. feed heaters and increasing the firing rate by 8% an increase of 5% electrical output can be obtained. Coal is fed from the bunker to the fuel pulverising mills by variable speed drag-link feeders. The four barrel type mills rotated at 15 rev/min (94.25 Rad/min), and are swept by hot air which carries the P.F. mixture to eight classifiers that reject any unground pieces of coal back to the mill. Eight exhausters pass the P.F. to 32 turbulent P.F. burners arranged in four rows of eight burners on the boiler front. Each P.F. burner has an integral oil burner which is used for lighting up purposes and low load operation when instability with P.F. firing would be experienced. Combustion air is fed to the burners by two forced draught fans which pass warm air ducted {{from the top of}} the boiler house through two rotary regenerative <b>air</b> <b>heaters</b> to the secondary, or combustion air registers around each burner. The <b>air</b> <b>heaters</b> are so designed that they can be by-passed on the gas and air side to facilitate optimum operating conditions. The boiler feed water which is passed through the economiser before entering the drum is circulated around the combustion chamber water wall tubes by any three of the four boiler water circulating pumps. Steam from the drum is passed to the H.P. turbine through a horizontal primary super heater bank, pendant super heater platens, and pendant final super heater bank. The super heater platens which are situated directly above the combustion chamber differ from other heaters in that the heat is imparted to the steam by radiation as well as convection. The other heaters being later in the gas duct rely mainly on convection for heat transfer. Steam temperature control is achieved by two stages of attemperation, one of which s between the primary super heater and the super heater platens and the other, which controls the final steam temperature, is immediately before the final super heater inlet. Exhaust steam from the H.P. turbine is returned to the boiler for re-heating at a constant pressure before being returned to the I.P. turbine. This achieved by a horizontal primary and a pendant final re-heater situated in the gas duct. Steam temperature control is achieved by non-contact type attemperators. The boiler is kept clean by 42 gun type soot blowers in the combustion chamber and 42 long retractable blowers which clean the pendant and convection surfaces, all operating under automatic control from the control room. The hot gasses from the combustion chamber are drawn through the super heater and re-heater banks, air heater and precipitators by induced draught fans which expel the gasses through the F.G.D. to the chimney. The fans maintain a slight vacuum within the combustion chamber in order to prevent combustion gasses leaking into the boiler house. The precipitators which are entirely of steel construction collect the dust by electrostatic means and there are no mechanical collectors.|$|E
