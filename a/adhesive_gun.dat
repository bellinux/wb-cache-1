50|$|In his cyborg form, he had {{the ability}} to phase (move through solid matter) and used various special weapons. His spider/scorpionlike robot body was {{equipped}} with tentacles, a powerful stinger, plasma and laser weapons, and a molecular <b>adhesive</b> <b>gun,</b> and could also fire bolas, knives and spears of varying sizes. He also possessed a high degree of invulnerability, enough to protect him from the combined attacks of Storm, Cyclops and Jean Grey. This effect was supposedly augmented by external generators linked to his mainframe computer. When these had been destroyed, Cyclops and Havok could destroy his mechanical body, but not kill him. In addition, in his mechanical body's first appearance, it had a cardboard cutout of a man's suit and body that hung from Hodge's neck, affecting a (to his mind) more normal appearance when his attempt to absorb Warlock's techno-organic abilities had failed.|$|E
50|$|The holen tournament {{sees the}} {{continued}} use of intimidation techniques by the contestants, especially Tomas and Ka Noli, who openly display their firearms while playing with marbles. To counter this, Dagul uses a different strategy - he sticks <b>adhesive</b> labels proclaiming <b>gun</b> ownership to the rear windshield of his car, to appear as if he also owned guns when in fact, he didn't.|$|R
50|$|Hot adhesives, {{also known}} as hot melt adhesives, are {{thermoplastics}} applied in molten form (in the 65-180 Â°C range) which solidify on cooling to form strong bonds between {{a wide range of}} materials. Ethylene-vinyl acetate-based hot-melts are particularly popular for crafts because of their ease of use and the wide range of common materials they can join. A glue gun (shown at right) is one method of applying hot <b>adhesives.</b> The glue <b>gun</b> melts the solid adhesive, then allows the liquid to pass through its barrel onto the material, where it solidifies.|$|R
40|$|Bonding of {{brackets}} {{has changed}} the practice of orthodontics {{and has become a}} routine clinical procedure in a remarkably short time. Modification of technical devices, sealants, attachments and procedure are continuing. Several methods and techniques have been introduced by recent advances in indirect bonding techniques which have made clinician to do a more expensive laboratory work. A new method which is more simplified and employed in our department with few expenses to invest has been followed with application of Erkogum (transparent blocking wax) as <b>adhesive</b> and glue <b>gun</b> material as transfer tray with minimal efforts and time duration to obtain a precise indirect bonding technique. Our trails have made it more effective and efficiently manageable to obtain a desired bonding of attachments and ease to the patient...|$|R
