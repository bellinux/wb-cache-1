40|$|Tuned {{mass damper}} (TMD) {{is a widely}} used {{vibration}} control device, consisting of a mass, some springs and damping elements. Viscous damper is mostly used as a damping element; however, it has many unsustainable problems, e. g., poor durability, sensitive to the change of temperature, difficult to adjust the damping, oil leakage etc. In this paper, a new sustainable adaptive-passive eddy current tuned mass damper (ECTMD) with variable damping, which {{is very easy to}} be further upgraded to a semi-active one, is proposed. Four important parameters, e. g., adsorption position of permanent magnets, thickness of the conductive plate, thickness of the extra steel plate and the air gap between permanent magnets <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>conductive</b> <b>plate</b> are investigated by a parametric study. Two new evaluation indexes are put forward to indicate the damping mechanism of the proposed device. The relationship between effective damping coefficient and air gap is fitted through a quadratic function. Then, the corresponding design method of the proposed adaptive–passive ECTMD is presented. At last, the previous adaptive–passive ECTMD is upgraded to a semi-active one, which can adjust its eddy current damping through adjusting its air gap in real-time, based on the linear-quadratic-Gaussian algorithm. The effectiveness of semi-active ECTMD is evaluated through harmonic excitations and human-induced excitations. The results show that the semi-active ECTMD with variable damping has a better vibration control effect than the optimized passive one...|$|E
40|$|Microstrip-patch-style antennas that {{generate}} monopole radiation patterns {{similar to those}} of quarter-wave whip antennas can be designed to have dimensions smaller than those needed heretofore for this purpose, by taking advantage of a feed configuration different from the conventional one. The large sizes necessitated by the conventional feed configuration have, until now, made such antennas impractical for frequencies below about 800 MHz: for example, at 200 MHz, the conventional feed configuration necessitates a patch diameter of about 8 ft (. 2. 4 m). too large, for example, for mounting on the roof of an automobile or on a small or medium-size aircraft. By making it possible to reduce diameters to between a tenth and a third of that necessitated by the conventional feed configuration, the modified configuration makes it possible to install such antennas in places where they could not previously be installed and thereby helps to realize the potential advantages (concealment and/or reduction of aerodynamic drag) of microstrip versus whip antennas. In both the conventional approach and the innovative approach, a microstrip-patch (or microstrip-patch-style) antenna for generating a monopole radiation pattern includes an electrically conductive patch or plate separated from an electrically conductive ground plane by a layer of electrically insulating material. In the conventional approach, the electrically insulating layer is typically a printed-circuit board about 1 / 16 in. (. 1. 6 mm) thick. Ordinarily, a coaxial cable from a transmitter, receiver, or transceiver is attached at the center on the ground-plane side, the shield of the cable being electrically connected to the ground plane. In the conventional approach, the coaxial cable is mated with a connector mounted on the ground plane. The center pin of this connector connects {{to the center of the}} coaxial cable and passes through a hole in the ground plane and a small hole in the insulating layer and then connects with the patch above one-third of the radial distance from the center. The modified feed configuration of the innovative approach is an inductive-short-circuit configuration that provides impedance matching and that has been used for many years on other antennas but not on microstrip-style monopole antennas. In this configuration, the pin is connected to both the conductive patch and the ground plane. As before, the shield of the coaxial cable is connected to the ground plane, but now the central conductor is connected to a point on the pin between the ground plane <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>conductive</b> <b>plate</b> (see figure). The location of the connection point on the pin is chosen so that together, the inductive short circuit <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>conductive</b> <b>plate</b> or patch act as components of a lumped-element resonant circuit that radiates efficiently at the resonance frequency and, at the resonance frequency, has an impedance that matches that of the coaxial cable. It should be noted that the innovative design entails two significant disadvantages. One disadvantage is that the frequency bandwidth for efficient operation is only about 1 / 20 to 1 / 15 that of a whip antenna designed for the same nominal frequency. The other disadvantage is that the estimated gain is between 3 - 1 / 2 and 4 - 1 / 2 dB below that of the whip antenna. However, if an affected radio-communication system used only a few adjacent frequency channels and the design of the components of the system other than the antenna provided adequate power or gain margin, then these disadvantages could be overcome...|$|E

40|$|Elastomers {{are used}} as {{dielectric}} layers contained between <b>the</b> parallel <b>conductive</b> <b>plates</b> of capacitors. <b>The</b> introduction of filler particles into an elastomer changes its permittivity ε. When particle organization in a composite is intentionally varied, this alters its capacitance. Using numerical simulations, we examine how conductive particle chains introduced into polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) alter ε. The effects of filler volume fraction ψ, interparticle d and interchain spacing a, zigzag angle θ between adjacent particles and overall chain orientation, particle size r, and clearance h between particles <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>conductive</b> <b>plates</b> are characterized. When filler particles are organized into chainlike structures rather than being just randomly distributed in the elastomer matrix, ε increases {{by as much as}} 85 %. When particles are organized into chainlike forms, ε increases with increasing ψ and a, but decreases with increasing d and θ. A composite containing smaller particles has a higher ε when ψ< 9 % while larger particles provide greater enhancement when ψ is larger than that value.

40|$|We propose {{experiments}} {{that might be}} set up to detect {{the increase in the}} velocity of light in a vacuum in the laboratory frame for photons travelling between (<b>and</b> perpendicular to) <b>the</b> Casimir plates in a vacuum. The Casimir plates are two closely spaced, <b>conductive</b> <b>plates,</b> where an attractive force is observed to exist between the plates called the 'Casimir Force'. We propose that the velocity of light in a vacuum increases when propagating between two transparent Casimir Plates. We call this effect the 'Light Velocity Casimir Effect' or LVC effect. The LVC effect happens because the vacuum energy density in between the plates is lower than that outside <b>the</b> Casimir <b>plates.</b> <b>The</b> <b>conductive</b> <b>plates</b> disallow certain frequencies of electrically charged virtual particles to exist inside the plates, thus lowering the inside vacuum particle density, compared to the density outside the plates. The reduced (electrically charged) virtual particle density results in fewer photon scattering events inside the plates, which should increase the light velocity between the plates in a vacuum relative to the normal vacuum light speed. A similar effect, involving light velocity change, occurs when light travels through two different real material densities; for example when light propagates from water to air, a process known as optical refraction.
