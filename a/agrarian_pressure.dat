[...] The UFA {{had previously been}} divided between members who supported direct political action, and others such as Henry Wise Wood who wanted to remain an <b>agrarian</b> <b>pressure</b> group. [...] The former position was accepted following a series of public debates between Irvine and Wood at UFA meetings, though Wood was successful in restricting the UFA's membership to farmers. Irvine's first book, Farmers in Politics (1920), endorsed the UFA policies of economic co-operation and group government.|$|E
40|$|This study {{outlines}} {{the influence of}} agrarian movements {{on the process of}} US institutional capacity building during the period of 1840 - 1980. It investigates the specific nature of US institutional efforts at various stages of development over different eras, highlighting how they informed the formation of state institutional capacities. The unique strength and development of US farmer’s movements led to a state institutional development path that had important implications for economic and social development going forward. In demonstrating the specific and important influence of agriculture and agricultural social movements on US state institutional formation, it will be shown how the two forces of state intervention and social movement pressure converged in a symbiotic relationship to produce agro-industrialization. Through this study this agro-industrial developmental path will be shown to have roots in the state’s institutional response to <b>agrarian</b> <b>pressure</b> in the concrete historical political economy. This state led development I label the agro-industrial push and highlight its relationship with agrarian social movements in the development of industrial agribusiness in the US {{over the course of the}} second half of the nineteenth and first half of the twentieth Centuries. It will then be shown how the particular institutional capacities that the agro-industrial push developed, along with the economic and political outcomes it created, were used in the twentieth Century to impose the same project outside of the US. The findings of this investigation link together and augment existing approaches to US capitalist development, International Relations, and theories of the relationship between the state and the food system...|$|E
40|$|The farm, {{which had}} been the basical value of the Yugoslav {{agricultural}} history, has today lost its meaning. The ownership of land is to be considered under the new conditions of transformation, {{in relationship to the}} nature and function of land ownership. The majority of farmers are decreasingly interested in even owning the land, and do not intend to widen their estates. The expansion of the land maximum presents no solution of the agricultural and village development in future. Today, the <b>agrarian</b> <b>pressure</b> upon land is diminishing and the market-value of land is changing. In planes, the best land is often the cheapest. Nowadays, a tractor with all machine equipment costs more than 5 acres of flat land. A farmer will today not decide himself for agriculture only on basis of the size of his estate. The number of acres is no more a determinative factor for a farmer to be successful. Today, the question is, whether he is able to utilize fully his land by application of modern scientific achievements. It is obvious that the character of ownership is in many ways changing. For a farmer’s stability the ownership of land and the size of an estate are less and less important — mostly important is how and in which way the modern productional means of labour are being applied. The farmer’s greatest wish is to be treated as a worker working in the field, so that on basis of increased production and income he can realize his constitutional and legal rights like the workers working in organizations of associated labour. For a farmer, his good fortune is not »buried in the field«, but in the new socio-economic position, which is to be realized through the increased labour production and income. However, these changes in the relationship towards ownership are no product of consciousness itself, but they emerge from the total socio-economic development, from results realized in agriculture and from the totality of the village transformation. From the standpoint of agricultural development, land consolidation can enable easier cultivation of land by means of mechanization, and by more efficient machines. Today, there are no known scientific findings regarding the advantages of more rational application of mechanization, due to less idling of machines, repeated defects and breakings caused by narrow plots, insufficient quality of farming etc. The author stresses, that land consolidation is to be regarded {{from the point of view}} of the consolidation of definite cultures, and not just as a measure for grouping of plots. Through the realization of land redistribution new spaces open for further specialization in agriculture, for the development of commodity production and for the increase of income of associated farmers. Further on, land consolidation is a condition for the development of water-supply, forestry, road networks and other fields of activities. It is also useful from the point of view of environment protection. Land consolidation is, concludes the author, in itself one of the preconditions for more rapid associating of farmers 2 ̆ 7 labour and means. If observed from this point, it is significant as a measure of further socializing of agriculture and the development of socialistic self-management relations in agriculture and in the village. It does not mean the abolition of private ownership, but it considerably changes the character of ownership relations...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{studies the}} {{evolution}} of income inequality in central Spain during the late seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, taking as case study the province of Guadalajara. The {{first part of the}} paper presents the sources and the dataset that was created to estimate income inequality using grain tithes. The second section shows that through the period grain represented the lion share of total income and therefore that it {{can be used as a}} reliable proxy. The following part of the paper introduces an analysis of income inequality in the province during the period 1690 - 1800 and concludes that inequality decreased during the last third of the eighteenth century. Finally the paper addresses this unexpected result and concludes that it was consequence of the success of the land reform carried out by the central government in the late 1760 s. The reform was a success in Guadalajara thanks to the characteristics of its population and the lack of bargaining power of <b>pressure</b> groups. <b>Agrarian</b> history, Inequality, <b>Pressure</b> groups, Institutions...|$|R
40|$|The Yugoslav State of {{the period}} between {{the two world wars}} is a very {{interesting}} topic for the historian/researcher. By examining this historical period, particularly from the Serbian point of view, since the Serbs were both in theory and in practice the most powerful element of the state, one may discover the causes that led to the bloodshed of the 90 s. The experiment of a coexistence of all South Slavs failed. Should we however put the blame only on certain personalities or on the circumstances of the time or could the situation have possibly a different ending? Would it perhaps be preferable to create immediately {{after the end of the}} First World War an independent Croatia, an independent Slovenia and a “Greater Serbia”? Finally, should we believe that the theory of eternal enmities and hatred among the South Slavs is unsubstantiated and that it all started on 1 December 1918, when Prince Regent Alexander Karageorgevitch formally declared the creation of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes? From the very beginning my intention was to try to give an answer to the above questions. More specifically, I had in mind to present an analysis of the internal political situation of a neighboring country, the relations of which to Greece had passed through many different phases. Serbia, Greece’s ally, had become Yugoslavia, a state with a turbulent internal political life and many serious problems which have not been researched in detail. Of course, it wouldn’t be appropriate to claim that I have analyzed the issue of Serbian nationalism in its totality in the pages of this dissertation. Therefore, I preferred to limit my research and my analysis of the issue in its political dimensions, by examining Serbian nationalism in the context of the political developments that took place in the interwar period and by presenting the key protagonists, the most important and influential personalities of the country. Furthermore, I chose to focus primarily on the relations between the two larger national groups, the Serbs and the Croats. The reason for this is that I believe that the essence of the problematic political life of the Yugoslav Kingdom in the period between the two World Wars lies in the perpetuation of the Serbocroatian conflict. Had the relations between the two been normal, my firm belief is that there wouldn’t have been any chance for the Yugoslav edifice to treble despite the many difficulties present elsewhere. King Alexander Karageorgevitch and his effort to impose his “Yugoslavism” (or a covered “Greater Serbism”), the Serbian political parties and their leaders, Pashitch, Pribichevitch, Stoyadinovitch, but also Croats, like Raditch and Matchek, played a specific role, which is presented in the chapters of the dissertation. The role of the various Serbian nationalist organizations and also the turmoil created by the activities of the Croat Ustashas, the Albanian Kacaks and the Bulgarian VMRO receive particular attention as well. By showing the importance of some political developments in interwar Yugoslavia I attempt to make clear the leading role of the Serbian element and the serbocentric functioning of the State. Certainly, it would be impossible to write only about the activities of the Serbs without at the same time presenting what provoked them, for example the antistate activities of the Croats, of the Albanians and of the Slav-Macedonians. Thus, the light of my analysis falls equally on the activities of these groups and the turmoil they caused. In the introduction I thought it was necessary to briefly refer to the period from the beginning of the 20 th century to the creation of the Kingdom of the Serbs, Croats and Slovenes. In these pages I give the historical background and the most important developments in Serbia, which led to the union of the Serbs with the rest South Slavs. After that, the thesis consists of three parts: An important milestone is the 6 th of January 1929 when the Royal Dictatorship was proclaimed. The First part analyzes the first decade after the end of the war (1918 - 1929). The first chapter is about the early years of the new state up to the voting of the Vidovdan Constitution, hated by all non-Serbs. The second chapter analyzes Serbo-Croat relations and the problems that the country had to face when parliamentarianism failed. Finally, the third chapter examines the politics that were implemented in the Southern regions of the State (forced serbianization, <b>agrarian</b> reform, colonization, <b>pressure</b> exercised to the Albanian populations to leave the country) and the troubled situation there because of the guerilla activities of Albanians and Bulgarian/Slav-Macedonians. The Second part of the thesis deals with the period of the Royal Dictatorship (1929 - 1934). In the first chapter, the focus is on relations between Serbs and Croats up to the regicide in Marseille in October 1934. The continuation of the volatility of the situation in the country in the same period is described in the next chapter, where there is also a short reference to the Greeks of Yugoslavia and the pressure exercised on them by the authorities. Finally, the Third part of the thesis concerns the period of the Regency, which found Yugoslavia having close relations with the fascist and nazi regimes of Italy and Germany and led to its catastrophic defeat in the Second World War. ...|$|R
