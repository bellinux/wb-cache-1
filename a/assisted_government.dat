50|$|On May 7, a new {{battle for}} control of Mogadishu started between Al-Shabaab and Hizbul Islam against the ICU. Hundreds were killed and injured, tens of {{thousands}} displaced. By May 13, rebel forces gained the upper hand and made large gains taking {{over most of the}} capital. 113 civilians, 15 ICU fighters (pro-government) and 19 foreign insurgents were killed in the battle. Fighting on May 13 in Mogadishu left eight civilians dead as government forces took an intersection from al-Shabaab forces. AU forces near the Presidential Palace in Mogadishu <b>assisted</b> <b>government</b> soldiers in the fight by opening up an artillery barrage on markets and hideouts where suspected al-Shabaab militants were hiding in southern Mogadishu. A civilian reported seeing government forces moving ten bodies of masked men, al-Shabaab, and three comrades who had been killed in the fighting on May 14. Eleven civilians were also reported killed in fighting on May 14, as al-Shabaab commanders reported running out of ammunition.|$|E
5000|$|This Colony {{was last}} built under British rule. Colonisation began in 1926, however was never completed. It {{differed}} from the previous two large scale colonies in Jhelum and the Lower Bari Doab in {{that it did not}} reserve space for horse breeders. However military provision was provided for with the reservation of 75,000 acres for pensioned servicemen. Peasant grants reserved for agricultural castes formed the bulk of the land. The government decided that those eligible for peasant grants were those whose lands had been ruined by waterlogging,or by diluvion and river action, or those who that inhabited congested tracts. By 1929, over 70,000 acres had been allotted to sufferers from the districts of Sialkot, Gujranwala, Sheikhupura and Gujrat. The government specifiedthat residents of tracts which had so far received little or no canal land should also be selected, provided that such men were skilled agriculturists and promised to make good colonists. Reward grants amounting to 36,750 were awarded to non officials deemed to have rendered loyal service to the government, whilst Police Grants were given to those [...] "who have been conspicuous in aid to the Police, or who have <b>assisted</b> <b>government</b> in times of disorder or the like." [...] Grants to 'Criminal tribes' were made in the hope of reclaiming through resettlement tribes which displayed habitual criminal tendencies.|$|E

40|$|That {{capital market}} {{has a role}} to play in any economy is unarguable. That the {{performance}} of any capital market is dependent on a number of economic factors and political stability is not in question. It should also be borne in mind that the promotion of a capital market is intimately tied up with the objective of accelerated economic growth and development. However, there is need to highlight the factors that influence what happen in the capital market which may be neglected especially in emerging economies. Therefore the study is set to unmask the supportive and unsupportive factors that determine the direction and magnitude of events in Nigerian capital market. The prospect of the Nigerian Capital Market in providing long term fund for domestic and foreign industries and for public projects has been established but we must all be ready to handle the challenges posed by internationalization and globalization which make the world a global village. Capital market main function is to mobilize and allocate the nation resources to the numerous users. The importance of this is evident in the way the capital market has <b>assisted</b> <b>government</b> at all levels to raise development bonds to finance long-term and low pay-back infrastructural development. It has also assisted companies to raise funds for expansion and modernization of their asset which leads to increase productivity at higher profit. Thus it is a truism to say that the economic growth and development of Nigeria can be tied around the capital market and if the recommendations of this work are diligently and effectively applied, the Nigerian Capital Market will achieve efficiency thereby serving as catalyst to the economic growth and development of Nigeria. 1. ...|$|E
40|$|This study {{explores the}} role of {{community}} organizations in the planning process, using the Seattle, Washington, brownfields program {{as the focus of}} study. Applying scholarly literature from planning, social work, and environmental studies, this research focuses specifically on the effect that community organizations have on promoting public participation, influencing project outcomes, and mediating between neighborhood residents and government at three brownfield sites in Seattle. I apply multiple qualitative research methods in this study, including case studies, semi-structured interviews, and archival research, to identify conditions if and where community organizations have been integral to public involvement and influential to project outcomes. My descriptions, questions, and analyses are based upon existing brownfield studies, participation and community organization literature, and the communicative planning debates. This research shows a notable lack of meaningful participation by individuals in brownfields projects despite the presence of several active community organizations in each case and assumptions in the literature of organizations’ promotion of public participation. Government officials and developers in this study implemented ‘public participation’ but often produced little more than an outreach/advertising effort that lacked any real path for input, reflecting the rationalization of participation requirements by those in power. For their part, community organizations played a mediating role but the role was as much for the benefit of city officials and developers as it was for neighborhood residents. Organizations in these cases <b>assisted</b> <b>government</b> officials in gauging local concerns and added valuable support to developers seeking city approvals yet rarely provided increased access to the planning process or facilitated activism, often due to the political context of these developments. Despite the appearance of minimal opportunities for meaningful participation, however, residents appeared mostly satisfied by the planning processes and showed little concern for contamination highlighting Seattle’s neighborhood planning efforts of the previous decade and emphasizing the importance of trust, long-standing relationships, and “local” status. Calls for increased public participation in the literature and in practice may not be necessary (or at least not necessary in all phases of a project) as long as planners and politicians strengthen efforts to build relationships and trust between stakeholders...|$|E
40|$|Master of Arts in Fine Arts - Fine ArtsA Community Partnership Art Event, {{resulting}} from curating and facilitating an educational collaboration {{was held on}} the 23 March 2004, ten years into South Africa’s democracy. Through a Masters in Fine Arts coursework entitled “Creating, Curating and Critiquing” offered at the University of Witwatersrand, I attempted to test {{the boundaries of the}} Arts and Culture Learning Area and explore alternatives to the current definition of “outreach”. The grade six learners from The Ridge School, an independent boys’ preparatory school and Salvazione Christian School, an <b>assisted</b> <b>government</b> school, were brought together over a period of ten weeks during regular school art lessons. Through the guidance and expertise of various artists, workshops were cocoordinated with the collaborative ideas of the learners coming to the fore. The process and dialogue established between learners, artists and educators was intended to shift my own parameters of teaching primary school art. Focusing on people rather than the final products points to a readiness to view knowledge not as a commodity owned b# 31;# 31;the expert teacher, but rather as something which can be constructed and developed with the learners. Originally the collaboration was intended as a celebration of the opening of new premises for Salvazione Christian School. The public art happening was held in a tent next to the informal settlement where a large majority of the children from Salvazione Christian School live. 3 Rather than what might be described as a modernist approach to art education, where the focus seems to be on the artist and artwork, the focus was on linking art to social interaction, and it was through the discovery of a form of hybridity that a number of differences between the two communities were challenged and exposed. This resulted in an approach that seems similar to {{the manner in which the}} Indian writer, Salman Rushdie writes of hybridity: “Hybridity, impurity, intermingling, the transformation that comes of new and unexpected combinations of human beings, cultures, ideas, politics, movies, songs. ” (Coombes, 2000 : 39) Through this hybridity tensions were created and explored rather than a ‘rainbow’ or melting pot created, where differences are glossed over as in a multicultural approach. The primary research methodology was participant observation in which directly observed data was analyzed and interpreted. Data was gathered from the interactions in the workshops, setting up the exhibition and the art event. As intended, a link between art and ‘outreach’ was established. In order for this link to change into a community partnership, it must be seen as part of a much longer process. The process as a whole did become a different kind of primary school art space, preparing the way for possible positive transformation of the visual arts in the arts and culture learning area at primary school level...|$|E
