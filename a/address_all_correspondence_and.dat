40|$|Abstract — This article {{discusses}} {{methods for}} evaluating the progression of osteoarthritis through dynamic functional imag-ing as opposed to current static techniques. Comparison is made between static and dynamic methods of evaluating knee alignment. The correlation between dynamic knee moments during gait and bone mineral content is discussed. Knee load-ing is considered in terms of high tibial osteotomy, knee braces, pain, and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. New image-processing techniques for quantitating cartilage loss are described, and computational methods for generating true three-dimensional (3 -D) maps of cartilage thickness are devel-oped. Finally, new approaches to cross-correlate magnetic res-onance images with kinematic measurements are described. These new techniques promise to become powerful diagnostic tools to detect and characterize pathological load distributions across articular cartilage. Key words: dynamic functional imaging, dynamic knee loads, gait analysis, MRI, osteoarthritis. <b>Address</b> <b>all</b> <b>correspondence</b> <b>and</b> requests for reprints to: Thomas P.

40|$|Abstract—Stiffness {{following}} {{surgery or}} injury {{to a joint}} develops as a progression of four stages: bleeding, edema, granulation tissue, and fibrosis. Continuous passive motion (CPM) properly applied {{during the first two}} stages of stiffness acts to pump blood and edema fluid away from the joint and periarticular tissues. This allows maintenance of normal periar-ticular soft tissue compliance. CPM is thus effective in pre-venting the development of stiffness if full motion is applied immediately following surgery and continued until swelling that limits the full motion of the joint no longer develops. This concept has been applied successfully to elbow rehabilitation, and explains the controversy surrounding CPM following knee arthroplasty. The application of this concept to clinical practice requires a paradigm shift, resulting in our attention being focused on preventing the initial or delayed accumulation of periarticular interstitial fluids. Key words: bleeding, continuous passive motion (CPM), edema, fibrosis, granulation tissue, joint stiffness. <b>Address</b> <b>all</b> <b>correspondence</b> <b>and</b> requests for reprints to: Shawn W.

40|$|Abstract—In relapsing-remitting (RR) {{multiple}} sclerosis (MS), conventional magnetic resonance (MR) imaging (MRI) {{has proved to}} be a valuable tool to assess the lesion burden and activity over time. However, conventional MRI cannot charac-terize and quantify the tissue damage within and outside such lesions and only can provide some gross measures reflecting the presence of irreversible tissue damage, such as the load of T 1 “black holes ” and the severity of brain or cord atrophy. Other MR-based techniques, including cell-specific imaging, magnetization transfer (MT) MRI (MT-MRI), diffusion-weighted (DW) MRI (DW-MRI), proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1 H-MRS), and functional MRI (fMRI), have the potential to overcome this limitation and, consequently, to pro-vide additional information about the nature and the extent of MS tissue damage, which would inevitably remain undetected when only a conventional MRI is obtained. Cell-specific imag-ing should result in a better definition of the cellular mecha-and to improve our ability to assess the efficacy of experimen-tal treatments. <b>Address</b> <b>all</b> <b>correspondence</b> <b>and</b> requests for reprints to Massimo Fil...|$|E

Once {{viewed as a}} rhetorical and superficial language phenomenon, metaphor is now recognized to serve {{a fundamental role in}} our conceptual structuring and language comprehension processes. In particular, it is argued that certain experiential metaphors based upon intuitions of spatial relations are inherent in the conceptual organization of our most abstract thoughts. In this paper we present a two stage computational model of metaphor interpretation which employs a spatially-founded semantics to broadly characterise the meaning carried by a metaphor in terms of a conceptual scaffolding, an interim meaning structure around which a fuller interpretation is fleshed out over time. We then present a semantics for the construction of conceptual scaffolding which is based upon core metaphors of collocation, containment and orientation. The goal of this scaffolding is to maintain the intended association of ideas even in contexts in which system knowledge is insufficient for a complete interpretation. This two stage system of scaffolding and elaboration also models the common time lapse between initial metaphor comprehension and full metaphor appreciation. Several mechanisms for deriving elaborative inference from scaffolding structures, particularly in cases of novel or creative metaphor, are also presented. While the system developed in this paper has significant practical application, its also demonstrates that core spatial metaphors clearly {{play a central role in}} metaphor comprehension...|$|R

40|$|Abstract This paper {{discusses}} specific {{techniques for}} reha-bilitation of chronic {{low back pain}} through aggressive physical therapy with behavioral support. The rationale for approaching the outcome dimensions of impairments in back function and pain-related disability as opposed to chronic pain symptoms is explained. This approach requires that impairments in back function are systematically identified through the quantifica-tion of trunk flexibility, straight leg raising, back extensor strength, lifting ability, and endurance. The described treatment approach focuses on eliminating those impairments through aggressive, quota-based exercise and is usually completed within 8 weeks. It requires only a modest amount of space and equipment. Useful behavioral techniques for extinguishing pain behaviors, lessening pain beliefs, and for promoting well-ness are described. Results from a treatment program using these techniques demonstrate normal back function and reduced disability {{for a majority of}} treated persons. Applying such a program to the VA population is an important challenge.

40|$|Abstract—The {{difficulties}} {{inherent in}} demonstrating {{the effectiveness of}} an intervention that is as all-inclusive and poorly defined as neurorehabilitation, especially in a condi-tion as unpredictable and variable as Multiple Sclerosis (MS), {{are not to be}} underestimated. They require strict adherence to rigorous methodology and, in particular, the consistent use of a range of clinically appropriate and scien-tifically sound measures of outcome. Incorporating this approach, it is possible to evaluate rehabilitation at four dif-ferent levels, including (1) the broadest concept of service delivery; (2) packages of comprehensive care; (3) individual components of the package; and finally, (4) the intrinsic ele-ments of the rehabilitation process. Most recent studies have focused on in-patient rehabilitation and have demonstrated benefits across disability, handicap, and quality of life in patients with mild to severe disability. Such benefits persist following discharge into the community. Studies evaluating service delivery and components of the rehabilitation pack-age are in progress, but few investigators have taken on the intrinsic elements or `black box ' of rehabilitation. These recent studies underline the fact that the evaluation of reha-bilitation is feasible. Such studies are important, not simply to justify funding but to ensure continuing improvement {{of the way in which}} MS is managed. <b>Address</b> <b>all</b> <b>correspondence</b> <b>and</b> requests for reprints to: Alan J.

40|$|Abstract—Laboratory {{evaluation}} {{techniques for}} support sur-faces have centered largely around interface pressure (IP) measurement, typically analyzing discrete maximum and minimum levels, or calculating the average pressure. Nowa-days, alternating pressure air mattresses (APAMs) are used increasingly {{for the prevention}} and treatment of pressure sores. Pressure relief (PR) provided by an APAM is time-varying. A computerized system that measures IP, air pressure, and pressure-time characteristics of dynamic support surfaces has been developed for perfortttance assessment. Using this system, IP was recorded continuously and the durations of pressures below three thresholds (30, 20, and 10 mmHg) were calculated automatically. Fifteen sound volun-teers were {{used to evaluate the}} pressure-relieving characteris-tics of four APAMs, including one overlay. Results indicated significant differences (p< 0. 001) between products when durations below 20 and 10 mmHg thresholds were analyzed, showing some devices were only capable of momentarily relieving pressure. Maximum contact pressures on the sacrum were significantly lower (p< 0. 0001) on devices where infla-tion pressure was adjusted according to the body mass of the subject. With further clinical validation, this tool could assist in the selection of alternating surfaces of any description.

These individu-als and the clinicians and engineers {{who work with}} them need information regarding the effectiveness of various systems. This study developed a methodology for assess-ing {{the effectiveness of a}} technological writing support system and evaluated its success. The Long-Range Optical Pointer and 10 -Branch Abbreviation Expansion System developed at the Trace R&D Center at the University of Wisconsin was used. The study applied a single subject research design: a series of AB replications with natural-ly-occurring baselines comparing data within subjects across behavior, and across subjects. Behaviors assessed included typing rate, efficiency, and accuracy. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of this system with four {{individuals with}} severe physical disabilities and one able-bodied person. Among the data collected, typing rates were found to range from 3 to 15 words per minute, with suspected dependency on familiarity with the system. Discussion highlights the potential benefits of this system and the critical requirement to individually assess a person's needs in order to appropriately select and prescribe these types of technology. The need for further application-oriented single-subject research as well as classical human factors research is emphasized.

40|$|Abstract—Frequency {{lowering}} {{is a form}} {{of signal}} process-ing designed to match speech to the residual auditory capacity of a listener with a high frequency hearing loss. A vocoder-based frequency-lowering system similar to one studied by Lippmann was evaluated in the present study. In this system, speech levels in high frequency bands modulated one-third-octave bands of noise at low frequencies, which were then added to unprocessed speech. Results obtained with this system indicated, in agreement with Lippmann, that processing improved the recognition of stop, fricative, and affricate consonants when the listening bandwidth was restricted to 800 Hz. However, results also showed that processing degraded the perception of nasals and semivowels, consonants not included in Lippmann's study. Based on these results, the frequency-lowering system was modified so as to suppress the processing whenever low frequency components dom-inated the input signal. High and low frequency energies of an input signal were measured continuously in the modified system, and the decision to process or to leave the signal unaltered was based on their relative levels. Results indicated that the modified system maintained the processing advantage for stops, fricatives, and affricates without degrading the perception of nasals and semi-vowels. The {{results of the present study}} also indicated that training is an important consideration when evaluat-ing frequency-lowering systems. Key words: frequency-lowering systems, speech intelligi-bility, vocoder evaluation. <b>Address</b> <b>all</b> <b>correspondence</b> <b>and</b> requests for reprints to: Charlotte M...|$|E

This paper, the last of three companion articles (13, 14), describes the detectability of the sounds emitted by the NagoyaITraconex audible traffic signal, the unit most commonly found in the western United States and almost exclusively in California. To determine detectability, three groups of subjects with normal hearing-young sighted adults (controls), elderly sighted adults, and elderly blind adults-participated in an audio-logical study. Auditory stimuli, which consisted of APTS sounds embedded in various levels of interfering traffic noise, were presented to subjects seated inside a double-walled sound-treated chamber. The subjects were instructed to press down on a response button as soon as they heard the audible pedestrian traffic signal. The percentage of correct detections determined the absolute detectability of APTS under various SIN ratios. The subjects ' speed of response indicated how quickly a pedestrian might begin to cross the intersection upon hearing the APTS.

40|$|AbstractThis project {{focused on}} {{identifying}} {{the influence of}} subject characteristics and foam properties on seat contours in order to explain the load transfer between the buttocks and cushion. Seat contours were recorded for 17 people (11 spinal cord injured and six able-bodied individuals). Contour characteristics were represented by maximum contour depth, surface area, and displaced volume. Subject characteristics were represented as intertrochanteric distance, body weight, and lower extremity muscle tone. Two foams with different degrees of stiff-ness (45 - and 55 -pound indentation load deflection [ILD]) were studied. Multiple regression equations were calculated {{for each of the}} three contour characteristics by entering in all three sub-ject attributes. While the equations differ, all six exhibited a significant Multiple R (range: 0. 79 to 0. 92). Each subject characteristic was a significant predictor of at least one contour trait (p< 0. 05). The major difference between the two cushions was the predictive ability of muscle tone. For the stiffer HR 55 foam, muscle tone was the strongest predictor of all contour characteristics. Therefore, some conclusions can be drawn con-cerning the relationship between foam stiffness, tone, and resulting seat contours. These relationships help define the dif-ferences in load transfer as subject and cushion characteristics vary and are important in the design of contoured foam for use as wheelchair cushions. Key words: high resiliency foams, seat contours, tissue inter-face pressure, wheelchair cushions. <b>Address</b> <b>all</b> <b>correspondence</b> <b>and</b> reprint requests to: Stephen Sprigle, Univer...|$|E

40|$|Abstract The {{purpose of}} our study was to {{evaluate}} all contact pressures between the molded ankle-foot orthosis (MAFO) and the subject during activities of daily living. The MAFOs studied are used clinically to reduce plantar contact pressures associat-ed with foot ulcers in adult neuropathic diabetic subjects, alle-viating abnormal pressures by redistributing them to low-pressure plantar regions. While effective, MAFOs are often not used by the subject due to weight and comfort issues. An understanding of the contact pressures between the subject and the orthosis {{is a first step}} in improving basic MAFO design. Four nonimpaired, young adult males were tested in this study. A right-side MAFO was custom-molded and fitted for each sub-ject by the same orthotist. Real-time pressures were obtained for the entire contact area using the F-Scan pressure measurement system. The data obtained demonstrated high contact pressures along the metatarsals of the foot, around the heel and ankle, and adjacent to the strap attachment sites. No contact pressures were noted along the posterior calf region during any of the activities performed. These data suggest the calf region would be a suit-able site for material removal for weight reduction and increased comfort, especially in warm weather. In addition, these data may be useful to orthotists in improving the basic design and to researchers {{as a starting point for}} performing com-plex finite element analysis on the MAFO. <b>Address</b> <b>all</b> <b>correspondence</b> <b>and</b> requests for reprints to: Dr. Khamis Abu...|$|E

The current experiments were limited to a linear {{system in which the}} crossover frequency dividing the channels was systematically varied. The subjects for the experiment were nine individuals with mild to moderately severe sensorineural hearing loss with various audiometric con-figurations. The subjects listened to continuous discourse, in noise, via a computer-controlled digital master hearing aid containing two real-time data acquisition processors. Initially, a modified simplex procedure was used to obtain preferred frequency-gain responses using several different crossover frequencies. A round-robin procedure was then conducted in which each preferred response from the simplex was compared with every other pre-ferred response. The frequency-gain responses chosen most often for the two- and three-channel systems were compared. The results showed {{no significant differences between the}} preferred frequency-gain response for the two- versus the three-channel system. In addition, the preferred response chosen most often was not consistently observed at the same crossover frequency for all subjects, with the exception of those with steeply sloping hearing loss who chose 1, 120 Hz as the first or second preference for the two-channel system. The round-robin results were rank-ordered according to the number of times each frequency-gain response was chosen.

40|$|Abstract—People who {{are unable}} to hear {{acoustic}} alarm signals because they have a complete or partial hearing loss must rely on visual or tactile signals to warn them {{in the event of an}} emergency. However, consumers report that personal smoke detector devices which provide a visual alarm do not wake people reliably. We examined the ability of visual alerting de-vices to wake people from the deepest stages of sleep: slow wave sleep (SWS) and rapid-eye-movement sleep (REM). These re-sults were related to the physical (optical) characteristics of devices currently on the market. In Experiment 1, a range of strobe intensities and locations were investigated. Experiment 2 confirmed the results of this pilot study on an independent set of subjects. On each trial, the strobe was allowed to run at a constant intensity until the subject awoke, or a maximum of 5 min had elapsed. Even though a diffuse light remained directly over the subject's face for each trial, subjects did not wake consistently. Under the favorable optical (smoke-free) conditions of the pre-sent study, the most intense of the devices presently offered for sale in Canada cannot be relied on to wake a sleeping person in the event of a fire. It remains unclear whether any visual alerting device can be expected to safely wake a sleeper in an emergency situation.

40|$|Abstract—Lumbar corsets {{have been}} {{recommended}} for {{low back pain}} patients {{as a way of}} stabilizing the lumbar region, facilitating flexion movements, and reducing pain. However, little is known about how these devices affect lumbar motion. To determine the degree of changes in the lumbar region, our approach was to quantify three-dimensional kinematic data of the pelvis in harness-supported treadmill walking. Twelve healthy subjects (age= 32 ± 11. 8 years) walked on a motorized treadmill at 4. 5 km/h with and without wearing a lumbar corset. Three external markers overlying the sacrum were tracked by three ultrasound microphones, determining a local coordinate system, to obtain pelvic motions in the frontal, sagittal, and transverse planes. Raw kinematic data were low-pass filtered and normalized relative to the right heel strike. Mean values for net angular displacements of the pelvis were calculated for each plane within the 5 th and 95 th percentile. The Student's t-test demonstrated significant differences (P< 0. 001) between the corset/no-corset conditions in the frontal plane. An average 40 % decrease in the relative pelvis up- and downward move-ment occurred in the frontal plane (4. 1 °± 2. 9 ° vs. 7. 1 °± 3. 3 °). The analysis revealed no significant differences of net angular displacements in the sagittal (2. 9 °± 1. 4 vs. 3. 4 ° ± 1. 7 °) and the transverse planes (4. 4 °± 2. 6 ° vs. 4. 3 °± 2. 1 ').

40|$|As bstract. The {{relationships}} between brain blood flow (BBF) and ventilation (VI) were studied during sleep in 13 goats. Unilateral BBF was continuously measured with an electromagnetic flow probe; total and regional BBF were {{assessed by the}} radioactive microsphere technique in four animals. Interacting changes in VI and BBF occurred during both slow wave (SWS) and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. During SWS, significant decreases in VI and increases in arterial Pco 2 occurred compared to wakefulness. BBF during SWS correlated linearly with arterial CO 2 tension (PaCO 2); and the relationship {{was similar to that}} for awake goats breathing CO 2. During REM sleep, VI was significantly less than both the awake (W) and SWS states due principally to a decrease in tidal volume. BBF during REM sleep was significantly and substantially increased compared with both the W and SWS states; this increase was shared by all brain areas. The increase in BBF during REM sleep was greater than that predicted from changes in PaCO 2. In five goats provided with chronic sagittal sinus fistulae, arteriovenous oxygen difference was measured in separate studies and found to be significantly lower during REM sleep compared with W; brain 02 consumption was similar in magnitude in the REM and W states. Thus, the high BBF of REM sleep was also unexplained by an increase of brain metabolic activity. We conclude that, during SWS, increases in BBF are explained by hypoventilation and hypercapnia.
