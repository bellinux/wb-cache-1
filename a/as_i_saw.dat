5|$|An infinitive form, {{that uses}} the plain form of the verb and the {{preposition}} to, is used for verbal clauses that are syntactically subordinate to a finite verbal clause. Finite verbal clauses {{are those that are}} formed around a verb in the present or preterit form. In clauses with auxiliary verbs they are the finite verbs and the main verb is treated as a subordinate clause. For example, he has to go where only the auxiliary verb have is inflected for time and the main verb to go is in the infinitive, or in a complement clause such <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> him leave, where the main verb is to see which is in a preterite form, and leave is in the infinitive.|$|E

500|$|In December 1983, Jerôme Dahan and Laurent Boutonnat, two friends, {{composed}} {{a song called}} [...] "Maman a tort", about lesbian love between a girl committed to a mental hospital and her nurse. To find a performer, they held a casting. A girl aged 15–16 was initially chosen to perform the song, before being rejected because she {{was too young to}} sing its sexually ambiguous lyrics. Boutonnat then decided to ask one of his friends, Mylène Gautier, to sing the track. Both composers have said that they thought Gautier seemed psychotic and thus was the ideal person to record the track. Boutonnat said: [...] "As soon <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> her, with her triangular face, I realized that this would be her and nobody else. She looked crazy, it was perfect." [...] After they decided to work with her, Gautier took the pseudonym of Farmer, as a tribute to actress Frances Farmer.|$|E
500|$|Goya's {{series of}} {{aquatint}} etchings The Disasters of War (...) was not completed until 1820, {{although most of}} the prints were made in the period 18101814. [...] The album of proofs given by Goya to a friend, however, now in the British Museum, provides many indications of the order in which both the preliminary drawings and the prints themselves were composed. The groups identified as the earliest clearly seem to predate the commission for the two paintings, and include two prints with obviously related compositions (illustrated), as well <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> this, which is presumably a scene witnessed during Goya's trip to Saragossa. [...] (One cannot look at this) is clearly related compositionally and thematically; the female central figure has her arms outstretched, but pointing down, while another figure has his hands clasped in prayer, and several others shield or hide their faces. This time the soldiers are not visible even from behind; only the bayonets of their guns are seen.|$|E

500|$|Christian Clemenson went to Harvard with Cuse {{but still}} {{went through the}} normal {{audition}} channels to get the part of Poole. Clemenson was apprehensive about pursuing one of the lead roles in a television show because of the long time commitments involved. He later said, [...] "The similarities between this show and The Wild Wild West, and my character to that show's Artemus Gordon, was an important hook for me. It {{was one of my}} favorite shows growing up, and as soon <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> that Brisco County was based on the same kind of material and attitude as that show, I called my agent and said, 'I'll do anything I {{have to do to get}} this. Clemenson applied his experiences at Ivy League schools to play the uptight Poole. Praising Clemenson's work on Brisco, Cuse said, [...] "You can't give him anything he's not capable of doing. He adds the voice of intelligence and caution to balance our cast".|$|E
500|$|Fellini's {{creative}} process for La Strada started with vague feelings, [...] "a kind of tone", he said, [...] "that lurked, {{which made me}} melancholy {{and gave me a}} diffused sense of guilt, like a shadow hanging over me. This feeling suggested two people who stay together, although it will be fatal, and they don't know why". These feelings evolved into certain images: snow silently falling on the ocean, various compositions of clouds, and a singing nightingale. At that point, Fellini started to draw and sketch these images, a habitual tendency that he claimed he had learned early in his career when he had worked in various provincial music halls and had to sketch out the various characters and sets. Finally, he reported that the idea first [...] "became real" [...] to him when he drew a circle {{on a piece of paper}} to depict Gelsomina's head, and he decided to base the character on the actual character of Giulietta Masina, his wife of five years at the time: [...] "I utilized the real Giulietta, but <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> her. I was influenced by her childhood photographs, so elements of Gelsomina reflect a ten-year-old Giulietta." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{central theme}} {{in almost all}} {{renditions}} of the narrative favouring the Mortara family was that of Marianna Mortara's health. From July 1858 onwards it was reported across Europe {{that as a result}} of her grief, Edgardo's mother had practically if not actually gone insane, and might even die. The powerful image of the heartbroken mother was stressed heavily in the family's appeals both to the public and to Edgardo himself. Momolo and the secretary of Rome's Jewish community, Sabatino Scazzocchio, told Edgardo that his mother's life was at risk if he did not come back soon. When Marianna wrote to her son in August, Scazzocchio refused to deliver the letter on the grounds that, being relatively calm and reassuring in tone, it might work against the impression they were trying to give him that she was no longer herself and that only his return could save her. One correspondent reported in January 1859: [...] "The father shows a great deal of courage, but the mother is having a hard time carrying on.... If the Holy Father had seen this woman <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> her, he would not have the courage to keep her son another moment." ...|$|E

[...] "I recognized {{it to be a}} great logo as soon <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> it", says Richard. The logo was used on every Carpenters album thereafter; Richard said it was done [...] "to keep things consistent". The logo did not appear on the front cover of Passage but a small version appeared on the back cover.|$|E
2500|$|In 1993, Smith began another [...] {{relationship}} with Kelly Bates {{while she was}} only 14 years old, having met her while she was babysitting for friends. Approximately two years later, when she left school, Bates moved in with Smith {{at his home in}} Furnival Road, Gorton. She had concealed the relationship from her parents. Bates' mother said of her first meeting with Smith after the two began living together: [...] "As soon <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> Smith the hairs {{on the back of my}} neck went up. I tried everything I could to get Kelly Anne away from him." ...|$|E
2500|$|In the {{introduction}} for his 1985 short story collection Eye, author Herbert discussed the film's reception and {{his participation in}} the production, complimented Lynch, and listed scenes that were shot but {{left out of the}} released version. He wrote, [...] "I enjoyed the film even as a cut and I told it <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> it: What reached the screen is a visual feast that begins as Dune begins and you hear my dialogue all through it." [...] Herbert also commented, [...] "I have my quibbles about the film, of course. Paul was a man playing god, not a god who could make it rain." ...|$|E

2500|$|When she {{was nine}} years old, Richards had the His Dark Materials books read to her by her mother, feeling that she could [...] "be her". After she saw the stage {{adaption}} at the National Theatre, she says she [...] "just wanted to be Lyra". [...] Philip Pullman, author of the books, said, [...] "As soon <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> Dakota's screen test, I realised that the search was over." [...] Chris Weitz, the director, added that Richards [...] "made {{what should have been}} an extremely difficult decision quite easy." [...] The Golden Compass with Richards as Lyra was released worldwide in December 2007 and grossed $372 million.|$|E
2500|$|Here Reshevsky {{offered me}} a draw, which was accepted. Is this a {{grandmaster}} draw? I do not think so.

2500|$|The {{accident}} ended Kahlo's {{dreams of}} becoming a doctor and caused her pain and illness {{for the rest of}} her life; her friend Andrés Henestrosa stated that Kahlo [...] "lived dying". During her recovery, she started to consider a career as a medical illustrator, which would combine her interests in science and art, and began to paint. She had a specially-made easel that enabled her to paint in bed, and a mirror was placed above it so she could see herself. [...] Painting became a way for Kahlo to explore questions of identity and existence, and she later stated that the accident and the isolating recovery period made her desire, [...] "to begin again, painting things just <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> them with my own eyes and nothing more." ...|$|E

2500|$|As the Confederates poured {{men into}} the breach, Emerson Opdycke's brigade was in reserve, {{positioned}} in columns of regiments facing north in a meadow about 200 yards {{north of the}} Carter House. Opdycke quickly repositioned his men into line of battle, straddling the road, and they were confronted by masses of fleeing Union soldiers, pursued by Confederates. Opdycke ordered his brigade forward to the works. At the same time, his corps commander, David Stanley, arrived on the scene. He later wrote, [...] "I saw Opdycke {{near the center of}} his line urging his men forward. I gave the Colonel no orders <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> him engaged in doing the very thing to save us, to get possession of our line again." [...] As he rode forward, Stanley had his horse shot out from under him and a bullet passed through the back of his neck, putting him temporarily out of action.|$|E
2500|$|... "It {{was a tough}} fight getting upstairs. We {{searched the}} bedroom areas {{and it was very}} hot, we knew {{immediately}} that no-one could have survived the fire.

As soon <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> the body clearly I knew who it was. I used to be a fan, it's difficult to put my feelings into words. The scene was horrific in that corner of the room. I saw him lying there and thought what a pity it all was. I deal with many fires but this one was like walking down memory lane. We managed to salvage all his guitars and musical equipment. I feel a bit upset, all the firemen do. It was like seeing part of our lives gone forever." [...] – (Fire Officer) ...|$|E
2500|$|The Royalist centre {{attacked}} first, with Rupert {{keeping his}} own wing of cavalry in hand {{so that the}} horse and foot could hit the enemy simultaneously. Skippon's infantry moved forward over {{the crest of the}} ridge to meet the Royalist foot. There was time for only one volley of musketry before both sides were fighting hand-to-hand, the veteran Royalist infantry using their swords and the butt ends of their muskets. Sir Edward Walker, Charles's secretary of war, stated [...] "The Foot on either side hardly saw each other until they were within Carabine Shot, and so made only one Volley; our falling in with Sword and butt end of the Musquet did notable Execution, so much <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> their Colours fall and their Foot in great Disorder." [...] Skippon was wounded by a bullet which splintered his armour and struck him under the ribs, although he stayed on the field to prevent panic spreading. Even so, the Parliamentarians were hard-pressed and forced back.|$|E
