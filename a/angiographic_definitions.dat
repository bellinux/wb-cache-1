40|$|Objectives. This {{study was}} {{undertaken}} to compare coronary angioscopy with angiography {{for the detection}} of intimal dissection and intracoronary thrombus. Background. It has been demonstrated previously that coronary angioscopy provides more intravascular detail than cineangiography. Both imaging methods have to be compared directly to assess the additional diagnostic value of angioscopy. Methods. The angiograms and videotapes of 52 patients who had undergone angioscopy, were reviewed independently by two observers unaware of other findings. Classic <b>angiographic</b> <b>definitions</b> were used for dissection and thrombus. Angioscopic dissection was defined as visible cracks or fissures on the lumen surface or mobile protruding structures that are contiguous with the vessel wall. Angioscopic thrombus was defined as a red, white or mixed red and white intraluminal mass. Results. Angiography and angioscopy were in agreement in 40. 4 % of cases in the absence of thrombus and in 11. 5 % in the presence of thrombus. No fewer than 25 (48. 1 %) angioscopically observed thrombi remained undetected at angiography. With angioscopy as the standard, although the specificity of angiography for thrombus was 100 %, sensitivity was very low at 19 %. Angioscopic dissection was present in 40 patients (76. 9 %) versus angiographic dissection in 15 patients (28. 8 %). With regard to dissection, there was no correlation between the two imaging methods (r(phi) = 0. 15, p = 0. 29). Conclusions. Coronary angiography underestimates the presence of intracoronary thrombus. Angioscopy and angiography are complementary techniques for detecting and grading intimal dissections...|$|E
40|$|Data from experimental, clinical, and {{pathologic}} {{studies have}} suggested that the process of restenosis begins very early after coronary angioplasty. The present study was performed to determine prospectively the incidence of restenosis with use of the four National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute and the 50 % or greater diameter stenosis criteria, as well as a criterion based on a decrease of 0. 72 mm or more in minimal luminal diameter. Patients were recatheterized at 30, 60, 90, or 120 days after successful percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA). After PTCA all patients received 10 mg nifedipine three to six times a day and aspirin once a day until repeat angiography. Of 400 consecutive patients in whom PTCA was successful (less than 50 % diameter stenosis), 342 underwent quantitative angiographic follow-up (86 %) by use of an automated edge-detection technique. A wide variation in the incidence of restenosis was found dependent on the criterion applied. The incidence of restenosis proved to be progressive to at least the third month for all except NHLBI criterion II. At 4 months a further increase in the incidence of restenosis was observed when defined as a decrease of 0. 72 mm or more in minimal luminal diameter, whereas the criteria based on percentage diameter stenosis showed a variable response. The lack of overlap between the different restenosis criteria applied affirms the arbitrary nature of <b>angiographic</b> <b>definitions</b> currently in use. Restenosis should be assessed by repeat angiography, and preferably ascertained according to the change in absolute quantitative measurements of the luminal diameter...|$|E
40|$|A rare form of {{obstructed}} total anomalous pulmonary venous drainage is presented. A neonate with asplenia, {{pulmonary atresia}} and complex {{congenital heart disease}} also had drainage of the left lung forming a venous confluence that proceeded in an intrapulmonary fashion through the right lung. A hypoplastic pulmonary venous channel then emerged from the right upper lobe leading to the superior vena cava. Pulmonary venous obstruction was suspected on initial plain chest X-ray examination and on angiography, which revealed the pulmonary artery to be larger than anticipated.

40|$|Coronary artery {{anomalies}} (CAAs) may {{be discovered}} more often as incidental findings during the normal diagnostic process for other cardiac diseases or less frequently {{on the basis}} of manifestations of myocardial ischemia. The cardiovascular professional may be involved in their angiographic diagnosis, functional assessment and eventual endovascular treatment. A complete <b>angiographic</b> <b>definition</b> is mandatory {{in order to understand the}} functional effects and plan any intervention in CAAs: computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging are useful non-invasive tools to detect three-dimensional morphology of the anomalies and its relationships with contiguous cardiac structures, whereas coronary arteriography remains the gold standard for a definitive anatomic picture. A practical idea of the possible functional significance is mandatory for deciding how to manage CAAs: non-invasive stress tests and in particular the invasive pharmacological stress tests with or without intravascular ultrasound monitoring can assess correctly the functional significance of the most CAAs. Finally, the knowledge of the particular endovascular techniques and material is of paramount importance for achieving technical and clinical success. CAAs represent a complex issue, which rarely involve the cardiovascular professional at different levels. A timely practical knowledge of the main issues regarding CAAs is important in the management of such entities...|$|R
40|$|Background-Angiographic {{successful}} reperfusion {{in acute}} myocardial infarction {{has been defined as}} TIMI 3 flow. However, TIMI 3 flow does not always result in effective myocardial reperfusion. Myocardial blush grade (MBG) is an angiographic measure of myocardial perfusion. We hypothesized that optimal angiographic reperfusion is defined by TIMI 3 flow and MBG 2 or 3. Methods and Results-In 924 consecutive patients with TIMI 3 flow after angioplasty for {{acute myocardial infarction}}, we prospectively studied the value of MBG. End points were death, MACE, enzymatic infarct size, and residual left ventricular ejection fraction. Follow-up was 16 +/- 11 months. Of the 924 patients, 101 (11 %) patients had MBG 0 or 1. Mortality was significantly higher in patients with MBG 0 or 1 compared with patients with MBG 2 or 3 (relative risk, 4. 7; 95 % CI, 2. 3 to 9. 5; P Conclusions -MBG is a strong angiographic predictor of mortality in patients with TIMI 3 flow after primary angioplasty.

40|$|Oxidative stress (OS) {{is related}} to {{vascular}} inflammation possibly, contributing {{to the development of}} coronary ectasia (CE). Base excision repair (BER) and nucleotide excision repair are the main DNA repair pathways that can help to remove 8 -hydroxydeoxyguanine (8 -OHdG), a marker of OS. Human 8 -oxoguanine DNA glycosylase 1 (hOGG 1) is a key enzyme of the BER pathway and catalyzes the removal of 8 -OHdG. The aim of our study was to investigate the association between hOGG 1 Ser 326 Cys gene polymorphism and CE in a Chinese population. Five-hundred forty-seven patients who underwent diagnostic coronary angiography in a tertiary medical center were recruited. The <b>angiographic</b> <b>definition</b> of CE is the diameter of the ectatic segment being more than 1. 5 times larger compared with an adjacent healthy reference segment. The gene polymorphisms were analyzed by polymerase chain reaction. The urine 8 OHdG concentration was measured using a commercial ELISA kit. The distribution of hOGG 1 Ser 326 Cys genotypes was significantly different between CE and non-CE groups (p = 0. 033). The odds ratio of CE development for the Ser to the Cys variant was 1. 55 (95 % confidence interval (CI), 1. 04 – 2. 31, p = 0. 033). Both univariate and logistic regression analysis showed a significant association of hOGG 1 Ser 326 Cys polymorphism in the dominant model with CE development (p = 0. 009 and 0. 011, respectively). Urine 8 -OHdG levels were significantly higher in subjects carrying the hOGG 1 Ser variant than in those with the Cys/Cys genotype (p < 0. 03). In conclusion, our study suggests that the hOGG 1 Ser 326 Cys gene variant might play a role in susceptibility to the development of CE...|$|R

40|$|AbstractSince the {{introduction}} of thrombolytic therapy for acute myocardial infarction, the incidence of coronary artery reocclusion has been intensively studied. Also, the prediction and diagnosis of reocclusion by angiographic and clinical variables, as well its invasive and pharmacologic prevention, have gained much attention. By <b>angiographic</b> <b>definition,</b> reocclusion requires three angiographic observations: one with an occluded artery, one with a reperfused artery and a third {{for the assessment of}} subsequent occlusion (true reocclusion). Since {{the introduction}} of early intravenous reperfusion therapy, most studies use only two angiograms: one with a patent and one with a nonpatent infarct-related artery. A search for all published reocclusion studies revealed 61 studies (6, 061 patients) with at least two angiograms. The median time interval between the first angiogram after thrombosis and the second was 16 days (range 0. 1 to 365). Reocclusion was observed in 666 (11 %) of 6, 061 cases. Interestingly, the 28 true reocclusion studies showed an incidence of reocclusion of 16 ± 10 % (mean ± SD), and the 33 studies with only two angiograms 10 ± 8 % (p = 0. 04), suggesting that proven initial occlusion of the infarct-related artery is a risk factor for reocclusion after successful thrombolysis. The other predictors for reocclusion are probably severity of residual stenosis of the infarct-related artery after thrombolysis and perhaps the flow state after lysis. Reocclusion is most frequently seen in the early weeks after thrombolysis. The clinical course in patients with reocclusion is more complicated than in those without complication. Left ventricular contractile recovery after thrombolysis is hampered by reocclusion. Routine invasive strategies have not been proven effective against reocclusion. In the prevention of reocclusion, both antiplatelet and antithrombin strategies have been tested, including hirudin and hirulog, but the safety of these agents in thrombolysis is still questionable. Thus, reocclusion after thrombolysis is an early phenomenon and is more frequent after proven initial occlusion of the infarct-related artery. Reocclusion can be predicted by angiography after thrombolysis. Because reocclusion is detrimental, strategies to prevent it should be developed and carried out after thrombolytic therapy for acute myocardial infarction as soon as they are deemed safe...|$|R
40|$|Reversible {{cerebral}} vasoconstriction syndrome" (RCVS) is {{a recently}} described entity that is mainly {{characterized by the}} association of severe ("thunderclap") headaches with or without additional neurological symptoms and diffuse, multifocal, segmental narrowings involving large and medium-sized cerebral arteries. By <b>definition,</b> <b>angiographic</b> abnormalities disappear within 3 months. The clinical course is usually benign, with a higher prevalence in young women. RCVS is idiopathic {{in the majority of}} the cases. However, recent papers have outlined the role of precipitating factors, including the use of vasoactive substances. Some patients, nevertheless, have a more severe clinical course with transient or permanent ischemic events. Hemorrhagic complications appear to have been underestimated. They are usually restricted to circumscribed cortical subarachnoid hemorrhage, {{in the absence of any}} ruptured cerebral aneurysm. This limited bleeding is unlikely at the origin of the diffuse vasoconstriction. The finding of an unruptured cerebral aneurysm in RCVS patients is probably incidental. An overlap is possible between RCVS and other syndromes such as posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome. There is no standardized treatment regimen for RCVS patients. It appears rational to further investigate the efficacy and safety of the calcium-channel antagonist nimodipine...|$|R
