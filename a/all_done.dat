5|$|Square {{accumulated}} four SGI Origin 2000 series servers, four Onyx2 systems, and 167 Octane workstations for the film's production. The basic {{film was}} rendered at a custom render farm created by Square in Hawaii. It housed 960 Pentium III-933MHz workstations. Character movements were filmed using motion capture technology. Animator Matthew Hackett stated that while motion capture was effective {{for many of}} the scenes, in others animators still had to add movements manually. Hand and facial movements were <b>all</b> <b>done</b> manually. Some of General Hein's facial features and poses were based on Hackett. As animators did not want to use any actual photographs in the film, all backgrounds were done using matte paintings. 1,327 scenes in total needed to be filmed to animate the digital characters. The film consists of 141,964 frames, with each frame taking an average of 90 minutes to render. By the end of production Square had a total of 15 terabytes of artwork for the film. It is estimated that over the film's four-year production, approximately 200 people put in a combined 120 years of work on it.|$|E
5|$|On Earth, Nite Owl and Rorschach {{continue}} {{to uncover the}} conspiracy surrounding the death of The Comedian and the accusations that drove Manhattan into exile. They discover evidence that Veidt may be behind the plan. Rorschach writes his suspicions about Veidt in his journal, {{in which he has}} been recording his entire investigation, and mails it to New Frontiersman, a local right-wing newspaper. The pair then leave New York and confront Veidt at his Antarctic retreat. Veidt explains his underlying plan is to save humanity from impending nuclear war between the United States and Soviet Union by faking an alien invasion in New York City, which will annihilate half the city's population. He hopes this will unite the nations against a perceived common enemy. He also reveals that he had murdered The Comedian, arranged for Dr. Manhattan's past associates to contract cancer, staged the attempt on his own life in order to place himself above suspicion, and killed Moloch in order to frame Rorschach. This was <b>all</b> <b>done</b> in an attempt to prevent his plan from being exposed. Nite Owl and Rorschach find Veidt's logic callous and abhorrent, but Veidt has already enacted his plan.|$|E

25|$|The primary {{roles of}} women in a Puritan society were to be wives and mothers, and provide the family with their {{everyday}} needs.

It's the same way now, but I know in the end the result will be unique and powerful.|$|E
25|$|Airbus {{suggested}} Boeing's use of {{composite materials}} for the 787 fuselage was premature, and that the new A350 XWB was to feature large carbon fibre panels for the main fuselage skin. After facing criticism for maintenance costs, Airbus confirmed in early September 2007 the adoption of composite fuselage frames for the aircraft structure. The composite frames would feature aluminium strips to ensure the electrical continuity of the fuselage (for dissipating lightning strikes). Airbus will use a full mock up fuselage to develop the wiring, a different approach from the A380, on which the wiring was <b>all</b> <b>done</b> on computers.|$|E

25|$|There {{are over}} 70,000 known Chinese characters, yet {{approximately}} only 32,232 are supported for computer input, including both Traditional and Simplified characters (see GBK etc.).

25|$|After Griffith's {{death in}} 1955, his nephew and adopted son Calvin {{took over the}} team presidency.

By 1957, after an early flirtation with San Francisco (where the New York Giants would eventually move after that season ended), Griffith began courting Minneapolis–St. Paul, a prolonged process that resulted in his rejecting the Twin Cities' first offer before agreeing to relocate. The American League opposed the move at first, but in 1960 a deal was reached: The Senators would move and would be replaced with an expansion Senators team for 1961. Thus, the old Washington Senators became the Minnesota Twins.|$|E

25|$|We {{said this}} movie is a stylized movie, it’s not so {{different}} from the world of a musical. And there were a few other things that contributed to that direction. One was the decision on Universal’s part, a crazy decision, to shoot the movie almost entirely in the studio under a tarpaulin. They built this gigantic tarpaulin, and the Battery and all these other places were built as real places. The Richlands. And just so you know, this is the early ’80s and you had stylized films—like New York, New York—that were <b>all</b> <b>done</b> on set and that idea was in the air. That idea of a totally artificial universe. The point is that we had in mind one sentence inspired by George Lucas: “in a galaxy long ago,” a futuristic past. That was in our heads…there’s the past and there’s the future, sort of.|$|E
25|$|Sir C. P. Ramaswami Iyer {{liquidated}} the Quilon bank, {{and sealed}} off Malayala Manorama the leading news paper for criticizing the divan. Abraham Mar Thoma spoke about these notorious acts and visited {{those who were}} jailed by him. He further visited the Maharaja of Travancore and complaint about Divans tyrannical rule. Marthoma church at this point passed a church resolution against Divan and independent Travancore which infuriated the divan and ordered for the Metropolitans arrest and imprisonment. However the arrest order was not executed. It was <b>all</b> <b>done</b> at a point of time when other churches and communities of Travancore praised divan or feared to utter a word against the divan. Later the Marthoma church had {{to pay the price}} for that social action. The land allotted in the heart of Thiruvananthapuram to construct a church by Maharaja Sree Moolam Thirunal was taken back. Marthoma church was selectively targeted by Divan, by not giving permissions for construction of cemeteries and new church buildings.|$|E
25|$|A {{number of}} churches and other {{buildings}} in rural {{parts of the}} state are noted for their “folk baroque” architecture and decoration, especially in Atlixco and the southwest. Folk baroque consists of the use of tile and painted raised stucco based on more traditional Baroque designs, which was most popular in the 18th century. One well known church of this type is the church of Jolapan, which is modeled after the Tepalcingo Sanctuary in neighboring Morelos. The church of Jolalpan contains richly decorated pilasters, Solomonic columns and other elements in a design very similar to that of Tepalcingo. Between these {{there are a number of}} small churches which also show folk baroque influence such as those in Tlancualpican and Tzicatlán. The church in Tlancualpican is painted in bright blues, greens and red, with an ornate façade with sculpted leaves, tendrils and niches divided by spiral half-columns <b>all</b> <b>done</b> in stucco. Even more ornate is the church in Tzicatlán, which is a small rural farming village, with every bit of the surface of the main façade decorated with brightly colored images and sculptures.|$|E
