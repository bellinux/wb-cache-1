On 27 January 1987 Parliament accepted the Committee's reports on the complaints and found Jeyaretnam guilty of abusing the privileges of Parliament by alleging executive interference in the judiciary, and of contempt of the Committee and Parliament by publishing the newsletters. Fines totalling $26,000 were imposed. Upon Jeyaretnam's refusal to pay the fines, civil suits to recover them were brought against him by the Attorney-General acting on the Government's behalf.

5000|$|Tromdámh Guaire [...] (also {{known as}} Imtheacht na Tromdhaimhe) is an Irish piece of prose satire about the {{relationship}} between the patron and poet and the <b>abuse</b> <b>of</b> <b>privilege.</b> [...] Although the text itself is difficult to date, it {{is believed to have been}} composed no earlier than 1300. [...] The only surviving copy of this text is found in the manuscript Leabhar Mhic Cárthaigh Riabhaigh or The Book of Lismore which itself dates to the 15th century. The story is set in seventh-century Ireland and is a literary showcase and parody of the practice of satire that was common among professional poets at the time. Tromdámh Guaire takes on a humorous look at the Bardic Order which a 12th-century audience would have been aware of in order to [...] "fully appreciate the biting sarcasm and satire contained in the narrative". [...] This retrospective view does not give us an insight into seventh century Ireland, rather the 12th century perceptions of seventh century Ireland.http://www.vanhamel.nl/codecs/Tromd%C3%A1mh_Guaire ...|$|E

40|$|We {{consider}} the optimal choice set of candidates standing for elected office. The decision dimensions {{are in the}} number of candidates standing for election, the experiential base of the candidates standing for election as measured by the length of prior experience held by the candidates, and the proportion of candidates with such prior experience. We find that while there are benefits that accrue to having a larger choice, the optimal number of candidates is strictly finite. Second, to justify an increase in the optimal length of prior experience requires strong increases in the ratio of benefits that accrue from additional experience to the cost of <b>abuse</b> <b>of</b> <b>privilege.</b> The conditions under which an increase in the length of prior experience can be justified are where the cost associated with <b>abuse</b> <b>of</b> <b>privilege</b> is negligible.

Under this choice problem optimal pairings of length of experience and the proportion of candidates with prior experience may not exist. Hence, societies may be condemned to suboptimality even should the political system prove to be amenable to change, rendering disaffection endemic to the political system.

40|$|In her Vindication of the Rights of Men, Mary Wollstonecraft accused Edmund Burke {{of having}} {{contempt}} {{for his political}} opponents. Yet she herself expressed contempt for Burke and did so unapologetically. Readers have long regarded Wollstonecraft’s decision to match Burke’s contempt {{with one of her}} own as either a tactical blunder or evidence that she sought merely to ridicule Burke rather than argue with him. I offer an interpretation and defence of Wollstonecraft's rhetorical choices by situating the Vindication within eighteenth-century debates about the dangers of elite contempt and the best methods for stifling it. Rather than countering Burke’s contempt with more of the same, Wollstonecraft’s Vindication marks a distinction between two forms of contempt. The first expresses the false sense of superiority experienced by elites who owe their social elevation to arbitrary differences of wealth or family. As such, it represents both an <b>abuse</b> <b>of</b> <b>privilege</b> and an anxious recognition among elites that their claims to dignity may be unfounded. By contrast, the contempt Wollstonecraft directs at Burke represents a dignified withdrawal of esteem which signals that one’s opponent is unworthy of the dignity to which they lay claim. If Wollstonecraft appeared to treat Burke abusively it was because she came to consider this second form of contempt as an antidote to the abusive contempt of the privileged. I conclude by spelling out some implications of Wollstonecraft’s analysis of contempt for recent debates in political theory over the importance of dignity to democracy...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: We {{consider}} the optimal choice set of candidates standing for elected o¢ce. The decision dimensions {{are in the}} number of candidates standing for election, and the experiential base of the candidates standing for election as measured by the length of prior experience held by the candidates and the proportion of candidates with such prior experience. We …nd that while there are bene…ts that accrue to having a larger choice, the optimal number of candidates is strictly …nite. Second, to justify an increase in the optimal length of prior experience requires strong increases in the ratio of bene…ts that accrue from additional experience to the cost of abuse of priviledge. The conditions under which an increase in the length of prior experience can be justi…ed is where the cost associated with <b>abuse</b> <b>of</b> <b>privilege</b> is negligible. This would require the development of appropriate formal (legal and constitutional) and informal (civil society) institutions that ensure that abuse of o¢ce remain negligible. Finally, we allow the number of electoral candidates, the length of their prior experience, as well as the proportion of candidates with experience to vary. Strong non-linearities ensure that even very small changes in the parameters that characterize a society can generate strong changes in the optimal experiential base of the political class. Where political systems are slow to change, and do so by means of small incremental changes, severe dissatisfaction with political systems is readily explained in the current model as the result of very small social changes. Moreover, optimal pairings of length of experience and the proportion of candidates with prior experience may not exist. Hence societies may be condemned to suboptimality even should the political system prove to be amenable to change, rendering disa¤ection endemic to the political system...|$|E

50|$|The {{database}} assists community {{management by}} keeping track <b>of</b> <b>privileges,</b> penalties and warnings.

Short of applying one of these penalties, a privileged user may officially “warn” another user about behavior. The use of penalties and warnings (who gave them out and who received them) is recorded so that the community managers can track behavior of troublemakers and also detect <b>abuse</b> <b>of</b> <b>privileges.</b> The system also lets individual users “ignore” the behavior of another user.

5000|$|The {{essence of}} the revolutionary {{situation}} which existed in France in the 1780s was the bankruptcy of the king, and hence the state. This economic crisis {{was due to the}} rapidly increasing costs of government and to the overwhelming costs incurred by fighting two major wars: the Seven Years' War and the American Revolutionary War. These costs could not be met from the usual sources of state revenue. Since the 1770s, several attempts by different ministers to introduce financial stability had failed. The taxation system was burdensome upon the middle class and the more prosperous peasants, given that the nobles were largely able to exempt themselves from it. As a result, there was [...] "an insistent demand" [...] for reform <b>of</b> these <b>abuses</b> <b>of</b> <b>privilege,</b> for an equitable means of taxation and for improved government processes. David Thomson argued that the bourgeoisie and peasantry had [...] "something to lose, not merely something to gain" [...] in their demands for a fairer society and this fear too was {{a major factor in the}} revolutionary situation.|$|R

50|$|Towards {{the end of}} the 18th century, and {{influenced}} by the philosophy of John Locke, the granting of patents began to be viewed as a form of intellectual property right, rather than simply the obtaining <b>of</b> economic <b>privilege.</b> A negative aspect of the patent law also emerged in this period - the <b>abuse</b> <b>of</b> patent <b>privilege</b> to monopolise the market and prevent improvement from other inventors. A notable example of this was the behaviour of Boulton & Watt in hounding their competitors such as Richard Trevithick through the courts, and preventing their improvements to the steam engine from being realised until their patent expired.|$|R
