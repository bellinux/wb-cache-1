5|$|Gordimer's {{homage to}} Fischer extends to using {{excerpts}} from his writings and public {{statements in the}} book. Lionel Burger's treason trial speech from the dock is taken from the speech Fischer gave at his own trial in 1966.

40|$|In 1965, {{alongside}} {{the abolition of}} capital punishment, <b>a</b> mandatory <b>life</b> <b>sentence</b> <b>for</b> murder was implemented in England and Wales. The mandatory <b>life</b> <b>sentence</b> served as <b>a</b> signal {{to the public that}} the criminal justice system would still implement the most severe sanction of life imprisonment in cases of murder. Nearly 50 years later, this article examines whether the imposition of <b>a</b> mandatory <b>life</b> <b>sentence</b> <b>for</b> murder is still {{in the best interests of}} justice or whether English homicide law would be better served by a discretionary sentencing system. In doing so, the article considers debates surrounding the political and public need <b>for</b> <b>a</b> mandatory <b>life</b> <b>sentence</b> <b>for</b> murder by drawing upon interviews conducted with 29 members of the English criminal justice system. This research concludes that a discretionary sentencing framework is required to adequately respond to the many contexts within which the crime of murder is committed...|$|R
