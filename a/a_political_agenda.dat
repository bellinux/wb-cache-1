25|$|In this way, Wodiczko’s visual {{repertoire}} for his projections expanded {{beyond the}} body (ears, eyes, and hands {{as indicators of}} human sensibility) to include chains, missiles, tanks, coins, cameras, boots, swastikas, guns, candles, food baskets, and corporate logos. “In these projections,” writes Kathleen MacQueen, “the artist alternates between symbolic, iconic, and indexical images – the principal relations an image can have to its subject, according to the writings of Charles Sanders Peirce – that is, predicated on a cultural reference, a physical resemblance, or a physical relation respectively. In many instances they scramble all relations: the hand, an index of the body – someone’s body – is also an iconic representation of communication that might symbolically represent an open or closed ideological position.” The reductive, visual signs monumentally-sized to fit the facades on which they are projected, {{are not meant to}} read as logos for <b>a</b> <b>political</b> <b>agenda,</b> instead they suggest a perceptual contradiction to disrupt the kind of assumptions that beset the casual passerby.|$|E

25|$|The {{results of}} the {{investigation}} were that the shooting spree was caused by a mental illness (chronic delusions similar to schizophrenia), and not <b>a</b> <b>political</b> <b>agenda.</b> Zavistonovičius held a gun for hunting since 1975. The permits were periodically renewed. As part of the renewal process, Zavistonovičius had to pass an examination by a psychiatrist. None of the psychiatrists who examined Zavistonovičius noticed anything suspicious, a fact which caused much controversy. During the investigation it was uncovered that in 1985, Zavistonovičius had been referred to and examined by the Vilnius Psychiatric Hospital. Zavistonovičius was married three times. The third wife separated from him just ten months before the shooting and described his morbid jealousy and persecutory delusions, even though neighbors saw him as an intelligent and helpful man. Relatives had begun noticing various symptoms since 1978, which may have been related to a car crash in 1976. In light of these findings, the prosecutor's office explored a possibility of charging with negligence the seven doctors who signed off on Zavistonovičius' gun permit. However, it was determined that the doctors were not negligent: without a centralized database, they could not know that Zavistonovičius was treated at a psychiatric hospital, and in public his symptoms were masked and controlled well enough to pass the brief examination without suspicion.|$|E

[...] "Jigsaw Falling into Place" [...] is about a set of observations and different experiences, partly of the chaos witnessed by Yorke when he used {{to go out on the}} weekend in Oxford. Yorke said [...] "The lyrics are quite caustic—the idea of 'before you're comatose' or whatever, drinking yourself into oblivion and getting fucked-up to forget ... is partly this elation. But there's a much darker side." ...|$|E
500|$|Further to the {{betrayal}} they had felt at Lennon's non-activist stance in [...] "Revolution", New Left commentators condemned The Beatles for {{its failure to}} offer <b>a</b> <b>political</b> <b>agenda.</b> The Beatles themselves were accused of using eclecticism and pastiche {{as a means of}} avoiding important issues in the turbulent political and social climate. Jon Landau, writing for the Liberation News Service, argued that, particularly in [...] "Piggies" [...] and [...] "Rocky Racoon", the band had adopted parody because they were [...] "afraid of confronting reality" [...] and [...] "the urgencies of the moment". Like Landau, many writers among the New Left considered the album outdated and irrelevant; instead, they heralded the Rolling Stones' concurrent release, Beggars Banquet, as what Lennon biographer Jon Wiener terms [...] "the 'strong solution,' a musical turning outward, toward the political and social battles of the day".|$|E
500|$|By 1762, however, Johnson {{had gained}} notoriety for his dilatoriness in writing; the {{contemporary}} poet Churchill teased Johnson {{for the delay}} in producing his long-promised edition of Shakespeare: [...] "He for subscribers baits his hook / and takes your cash, but where's the book?" [...] The comments soon motivated Johnson to finish his Shakespeare, and, after receiving the first payment from a government pension on 20 July 1762, {{he was able to}} dedicate most of his time towards this goal. Earlier that July, the 24-year-old King George III granted Johnson an annual pension of £300 in appreciation for the Dictionary. While the pension did not make Johnson wealthy, it did allow him a modest yet comfortable independence for the remaining 22 years of his life. The award came largely through the efforts of Sheridan and the Earl of Bute. When Johnson questioned if the pension would force him to promote <b>a</b> <b>political</b> <b>agenda</b> or support various officials, he was told by Bute that the pension [...] "is not given you for anything you are to do, but for what you have done".|$|E

500|$|The book [...] {{includes}} {{an essay in}} which Johnson uses Cartman's actions and behavior as examples when discussing the logical problem of moral evil, and another essay by College of Staten Island professor Mark D. White cited the season two (1998) episode [...] "Chickenlover", in which Cartman is temporarily granted law enforcement powers, in its discussion regarding the command theory of law and what obligates a citizen to obey the law. Essays in the books , Blame Canada! South Park and Contemporary Culture, and Taking South Park Seriously have also analyzed Cartman's perspectives {{within the framework of}} popular philosophical, theological, political, and social concepts. Parker and Stone downplay the show's alignment with any particular political affiliation, and deny having <b>a</b> <b>political</b> <b>agenda</b> when creating an episode. In response to the focus on elements of satire in South Park, Parker has said that the main goal of the show is to portray Cartman and his friends as [...] "kids just being kids" [...] as a means of accurately showcasing [...] "what it's like to be in [...] in America".|$|E
500|$|The {{move towards}} greater {{involvement}} in political {{issues and the}} increasing popularity of the show in certain key demographics have led to examinations of where {{the views of the}} show fit in the political spectrum. Adam Clymer, among many others, has argued that The Daily Show is more critical of Republicans than Democrats. Stewart, who voted Democratic in the 2004 presidential election, acknowledged that the show has a more liberal point of view, but that it is not [...] "a liberal organization" [...] with <b>a</b> <b>political</b> <b>agenda</b> and its duty first and foremost is to be funny. He acknowledges that the show is not necessarily an [...] "equal opportunity offender", explaining that Republicans tended to provide more comedic fodder because [...] "I think we consider those with power and influence targets and those without it, not." [...] In an interview in 2005, when asked how he responded to critics claiming that The Daily Show is overly liberal, Stephen Colbert, also a self-proclaimed Democrat, said in an interview during the Bush Administration, when the Republicans held a majority in the House and Senate: [...] "We are liberal, but Jon's very respectful of the Republican guests, and, listen, if liberals were in power {{it would be easier to}} attack them, but Republicans have the executive, legislative and judicial branches, so making fun of Democrats is like kicking a child, so it's just not worth it." ...|$|E
