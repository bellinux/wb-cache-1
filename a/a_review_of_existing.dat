500|$|Despite {{cancelling}} the DDL project, {{the government}} endorsed the RAN's requirement for new destroyer-type warships and requested <b>a</b> <b>review</b> <b>of</b> <b>existing</b> foreign designs {{to find a}} replacement. The process of evaluating new designs was managed by {{what had been the}} DDL project office, and in line with the government's priorities it initially focused on selecting affordable warships of a proven design for further consideration. A large number of designs were studied by the project office, and the United States' s and a variant of the British Type 42 destroyer armed with SM-1 surface to air missiles were eventually short listed for detailed evaluation. The project team found that the Type 42 was the only design capable of meeting the Navy's requirement, and stated that the Oliver Hazard Perry class was [...] "a second rate escort that falls short of the DDL requirements on virtually every respect". Despite this, there were serious concerns over whether {{it would be possible to}} fit SM-1 missiles to the Type 42, and this led the government to approve the purchase of two Oliver Hazard Perry ships from the United States in April 1974.|$|E
