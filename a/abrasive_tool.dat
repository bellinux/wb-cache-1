50|$|Mining in Portland is done {{by using}} a room and pillar method. The mine is {{advanced}} by extracting the stone using an <b>abrasive</b> <b>tool</b> chain cutter mounted on a machine. Slots are cut into the top, bottom, sides and middle of the stone. A flat steel pillow is inserted into the middle cut and slowly inflated with water. The stones are gently broken off at the back without placing any stress on the resulting blocks. The method of extraction is significantly more expensive than blasting, but results in a higher yield thereby saving valuable reserves for future generations. The environmental benefits are substantial as mining significantly reduces the impact on wildlife and the local community with reduced noise and dust.|$|E

40|$|Abstract â€” In this paper, a {{finishing}} {{system with}} a mounted <b>abrasive</b> <b>tool</b> is proposed for polishing of metallic molds. The shape of the mounted <b>abrasive</b> <b>tool</b> is a ball-end type. When a metallic mold with curved surface is polished, not only {{the orientation of the}} mounted <b>abrasive</b> <b>tool</b> is fixed but also its revolution is locked. The motion of the mounted <b>abrasive</b> <b>tool</b> is feedforwardly controlled based on an initial trajectory calculated in advance. The surface is polished by the polishing force which consists of a contact force, motion and viscous friction forces acting between the mold and tool. In this case, the velocities in the normal and tangent directions are delicately regulated so that the polishing force can track the desired value. The effectiveness of the proposed system is proved by experiments using an industrial robot with a PC based controller. 1...|$|E
