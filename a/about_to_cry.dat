500|$|... "Until It Beats No More" [...] {{was used}} as an {{introduction}} to Lopez's performance at the American Music Awards on November 20, 2011. She wore a golden gown, with the words: [...] "Love... It's a journey and I still have questions" [...] appearing in a screen behind her. Lopez began to break down, appearing as though she was <b>about</b> <b>to</b> <b>cry.</b> She then paused, looked up and shed most of her clothes for a performance of [...] "Papi". Critics noted the [...] "fake breakdown" [...] to be poking fun at her breakdown during her performance of the song at the Mohegan Sun casino a month earlier. The performance was compared to Britney Spears's music video for [...] "Toxic" [...] and Lopez's performance during the 2001 American Music Awards.|$|E

6000|$|Christie had {{no answer}} to this little address, and was <b>about</b> <b>to</b> <b>cry</b> as the only {{adequate}} expression of her feelings, when a hearty [...] "Hear! Hear!" [...] from below made her laugh, and call out: ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It was Lew Flapp. But, oh, please, don't let {{him know}} I told you! He'll kill me if he finds it out!" [...] Link Smith was <b>about</b> ready <b>to</b> <b>cry.</b>|$|R
60|$|Cecilia quivered; for {{a moment}} it seemed that she was <b>about</b> <b>to</b> burst out <b>crying.</b> Stephen stroked her {{shoulder}} steadily. Cecilia must have felt his dread; she struggled loyally with her emotion.|$|R
5000|$|It is {{said that}} when he was <b>about</b> <b>to</b> expire, he <b>cried</b> out, [...] "Christ, son of the Living God, have mercy on us!". Hus' ashes were later thrown into the Rhine River.|$|R
6000|$|The Pere {{would not}} stir, for all Joan's pleadings. She was <b>about</b> <b>to</b> <b>cry</b> again; {{then she had}} an idea, and seized the shovel and deluged her own head with the ashes, {{stammering}} out through her chokings and suffocations: ...|$|E
6000|$|Wearyworld, who was {{so called}} because of his forlorn way of muttering, [...] "It's a weary warld, and nobody bides in't," [...] as he went his melancholy rounds, sighed like one <b>about</b> <b>to</b> <b>cry,</b> and Gavin changed the subject.|$|E
60|$|He stopped short, for {{something}} in her face perplexed him. It was impossible for her, of course, to feel disappointment to that extent, and yet she had all {{the appearance of a}} child <b>about</b> <b>to</b> <b>cry.</b> He felt suddenly awkward and ill at ease.|$|E
50|$|Pollio and Flavius enter surreptitiously, {{planning}} {{to spy on}} the druidess's secret rites. Pollio, though married to Norma, is smitten by Adalgisa. Hearing Norma's procession <b>about</b> <b>to</b> enter, Pollio <b>cries</b> out for help and alleges that Flavius has profaned the sanctum by embracing Adalgisa. Norma condemns Flavius to death.|$|R
6000|$|... "Sure it's owld men {{and women}} we're <b>about</b> <b>to</b> kill!" [...] <b>cried</b> Captain Rigg, {{lowering}} his formidable forehammer, with which, in default of a better weapon, he had armed himself, [...] "but hooray! Gineral, there may be lots o' the warrior reptiles in among the huts, and them poor craturs have been sent out to decaive us." ...|$|R
60|$|Drawing back hastily, {{the poor}} youth shouted to those outside {{to let them}} know what had occurred, but no one paid the least {{attention}} to him. He was <b>about</b> <b>to</b> renew his <b>cries</b> more loudly, when the thought occurred that perhaps they might attribute them to fear. This kept him quiet, and he made up his mind to endure in silence.|$|R
60|$|That broke Kitty's heart; and, {{spreading}} {{her hands}} before her face, she was <b>about</b> <b>to</b> <b>cry</b> again, when the sad sight which met her eyes dispelled the gathering tears. The new gloves were both split {{up the middle}} and very dirty with clutching at the steps as she went down.|$|E
6000|$|For {{a moment}} Henrietta seemed <b>about</b> <b>to</b> <b>cry.</b> Suddenly she exclaimed with enthusiasm: [...] "I {{will stay with}} you, Sidney. I will share your work, {{whatever}} it may be. I will dress as a dairymaid, and have a little pail to carry milk in. The world is nothing to me except when you are with me; and I should love to live here and sketch from nature." ...|$|E
60|$|One {{afternoon}} late, while Joan {{was half}} dreaming, half dozing the hours away, she was thoroughly aroused by the tramp of boots and loud voices of excited men. Joan slipped to the peephole in the partition. Bate Wood had raised a warning hand to Kells, who stood up, facing the door. Red Pearce came bursting in, wild-eyed and violent. Joan imagined he was <b>about</b> <b>to</b> <b>cry</b> out that Kells had been betrayed.|$|E
6000|$|... "I shall rely on {{your kind}} offices, in particular, Miss Van Cortlandt, to {{reconcile}} Mrs. Jarvis and Mrs. Hawker to the liberty I am <b>about</b> <b>to</b> take," [...] <b>cried</b> Sir George, as Grace burst upon {{them in the}} library, {{in a blaze of}} beauty that, in her case, was aided by her attire; [...] "and cold-hearted and unchristian-like women they must be, indeed, to resist such a mediator!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Stop," [...] she said; [...] "for {{your own}} sake stop. Man, will you really commit this awful, this useless crime? Think of the {{reckoning}} {{that must be}} paid here and hereafter; think of me, the woman you dishonoured, standing before the Judgment Seat of God, and bearing witness against your naked, shivering soul. Think of him, the good and harmless man whom you are <b>about</b> cruelly <b>to</b> butcher, <b>crying</b> in the ear of Christ, 'Look upon Juan de Montalvo, my pitiless murderer----'" ...|$|R
6000|$|Sally stirred {{and turned}} a strange look upon us all. [...] "In that case, then, if I am not mistaken, {{there were two}} Lone Star Rangers--and both have seen their last service!" [...] Sally's lips were trembling, the way they trembled when it was {{impossible}} to tell whether she was <b>about</b> <b>to</b> laugh or <b>cry.</b> The first hint of her old combative spirit or her old archness! A wave of feeling rushed over me, too much for me in my weakened condition. Dizzy, racked with sudden shooting pains, I closed my eyes; and the happiness I embraced was all the sweeter for the suffering it entailed. Something beat into my ears, into my brain, with the regularity and rapid beat of pulsing blood--not too late! Not too late! ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Whisht!" [...] said Tommy, in an {{agony of}} dread, [...] "she hears you, and she'll guess. We ain't {{speaking}} of nothing {{to give to}} you at Hogmanay," [...] {{he said to his}} mother with great cunning. Then he winked at Elspeth and said, with his hand over his mouth, [...] "I hinna twopence!" [...] and Elspeth, <b>about</b> <b>to</b> <b>cry</b> in fright, [...] "Have you spended it?" [...] saw the joke and crowed instead, [...] "Nor yet has I threepence!" ...|$|E
60|$|David in {{the middle}} of his games would {{suddenly}} remember the great blank and step aside to cry. It was one of his qualities that when he knew he was <b>about</b> <b>to</b> <b>cry</b> he turned aside to do it and I always respected his privacy and waited for him. Of course being but a little boy he was soon playing again, but his sudden floods of feeling, of which we never spoke, were dear to me in those desolate days.|$|E
60|$|This Mr. Boulder of whom Mr. Fyshe spoke might {{indeed have}} been seen at that moment at a further table of the lunch room eating a solitary meal, an oldish man with a great frame {{suggesting}} broken strength, with a white beard and with falling under-eyelids {{that made him look}} as if he were just <b>about</b> <b>to</b> <b>cry.</b> His eyes were blue and far away, and his still, mournful face and his great bent shoulders seemed to suggest all the power and mystery of high finance.|$|E
6000|$|Gwendolen {{was ready}} <b>to</b> <b>cry</b> with venation. But {{there was nothing}} to do but start; which she was <b>about</b> <b>to</b> do when her father hit upon an idea which filled him with delight because it so deftly covered all the {{difficulties}} of the situation and made things smooth and satisfactory: ...|$|R
40|$|Laboratory {{selection}} increased {{resistance to}} the Bacillus thuringiensis toxin Cry 1 C in a strain of diamondback moth (Plutella xylostella). The selected strain was derived from a field population that had evolved high levels of resistance to Bacillus thuringiensis subsp. kurstaki and moderate resistance <b>to</b> <b>Cry</b> 1 C. Relative to the responses of a susceptible strain of diamondback moth, the resistance <b>to</b> <b>Cry</b> 1 C of the selected strain increased to 62 -fold after six generations of selection. The realized heritability of resistance was 0. 10. Analysis of F(inf 1) hybrid progeny from reciprocal crosses between the selected strain and a susceptible strain showed that resistance <b>to</b> <b>Cry</b> 1 C was autosomally inherited. The dominance of resistance <b>to</b> <b>Cry</b> 1 C depended on the concentration; inheritance was increasingly dominant as the concentration decreased. Responses of progeny from single-pair families showed that resistance <b>to</b> <b>Cry</b> 1 C and resistance <b>to</b> <b>Cry</b> 1 Ab were inherited independently, which enhances opportunities for managing resistance. However, compared with projections based on previously reported recessive inheritance of resistance <b>to</b> <b>Cry</b> 1 A toxins, the potentially dominant inheritance of resistance <b>to</b> <b>Cry</b> 1 C observed here could accelerate evolution of resistance...|$|R
5000|$|During {{the game}} a player is <b>about</b> <b>to</b> {{run into the}} cheerleaders. Pete picks up Angela, like an impulse while Jamie is knocked over and then begins <b>to</b> <b>cry</b> because her nose is bleeding. As {{the first time that}} [...] "The Chicken" [...] (presumably Cleatus) has snubbed his [...] "girlfriend" [...] in favor of Angela, both Pete and Cleatus worry that they may have {{revealed}} too much. Afterward, Angela thanks Poole and is <b>about</b> <b>to</b> kiss him, but Pete stops it.|$|R
60|$|This {{contempt}} of ordinary proprietary requirements made {{the old lady}} spring out from {{the shelter of the}} shade. Brandishing her umbrella, she was <b>about</b> <b>to</b> <b>cry</b> out to the man to stop and shut the gate, but she restrained herself. The distance was too great, and, besides, she thought better of it. She went again into the shade, and waited. In about ten minutes the carriage came back, but without the lady. This time the driver got down, shut the gate after him, and drove rapidly away.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Ask {{him to do}} more, Rose of Sharon,' said Fakredeen, like a child <b>about</b> <b>to</b> <b>cry</b> for a toy, and {{he threw}} himself on his knees before Eva, and kept kissing her robe. 'Ask him to do more,' he repeated, in a {{suppressed}} tone of heart-rending cajolery; 'he can refuse you nothing. Ask him, ask him, Eva! I have no friend {{in the world but}} you; I am so desolate. You have always been my friend, my counsellor, my darling, my ruby, my pearl, my rose of Rocnabad! Ask him, Eva; never mind my faults; you know me by heart; only ask him!' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "My God!" [...] he thought, appalled; [...] "is it {{possible}} that I have not got {{to the bottom of}} this question?" [...] And, turning his back on the audience, he gazed in a sort of agony at the figure of Nelson towering into the sky above him. He was <b>about</b> <b>to</b> <b>cry</b> out piteously: [...] "Countrymen, I know not what I think. Oh! I am unhappy!" [...] when he inadvertently stepped back over the edge of the plinth, and, still entangled in the flag, was picked up by two policemen and placed in a dazed condition and a deserted spot opposite the National Gallery.|$|E
6000|$|... "No, Liddy--I don't {{want you}} any more. I can hardly say why I have taken <b>to</b> <b>crying</b> lately: I never used <b>to</b> <b>cry.</b> Good-night." ...|$|R
40|$|Two {{colonies of}} Asian corn borer, Ostrinia furnacalis (Guenée), artificially {{selected}} from a Bt-susceptible colony (ACB-BtS) for resistance <b>to</b> <b>Cry</b> 1 Ab (ACB-AbR) and Cry 1 Ac (ACB-AcR) toxins, were used to analyze inheritance patterns of resistance <b>to</b> <b>Cry</b> 1 toxins. ACB-AbR and ACB-AcR evolved significant levels of resistance, with resistance ratios (RR) of 39 -fold and 78. 8 -fold <b>to</b> <b>Cry</b> 1 Ab and Cry 1 Ac, respectively. The susceptibility of ACB-AbR larvae <b>to</b> <b>Cry</b> 1 Ac and Cry 1 F toxins, which had not previously been exposed, were significantly reduced, being > 113 -fold and 48 -fold, respectively. Similarly, susceptibility of ACB-AcR larvae <b>to</b> <b>Cry</b> 1 Ab and Cry 1 F were also significantly reduced (RR > nine-fold, RR > 18 -fold, respectively), indicating cross-resistance among Cry 1 Ab, Cry 1 Ac, and Cry 1 F toxins. However, ACB-AbR and ACB-AcR larvae were equally susceptible <b>to</b> <b>Cry</b> 1 Ie as were ACB-BtS larvae, indicating no cross-resistance between Cry 1 Ie and Cry 1 Ab or Cry 1 Ac toxins; this may provide considerable benefits in preventing or delaying the evolution of resistance in ACB <b>to</b> <b>Cry</b> 1 Ab and Cry 1 Ac toxins. Backcrossing studies indicated that resistance <b>to</b> <b>Cry</b> 1 Ab toxin was polygenic in ACB-AbR, but monogenic in ACB-AcR, whilst resistance <b>to</b> <b>Cry</b> 1 Ac toxin was primarily monogenic in both ACB-AbR and ACB-AcR, but polygenic as resistance increased...|$|R
5000|$|They become distressed at the {{possibility}} of each other's death, and agree that their only consolation would be <b>to</b> <b>cry.</b> However, they decide {{that it would be better}} <b>to</b> <b>cry</b> in luxury. Irwin observes: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "They {{looked at}} me, and I nodded. Harry Burnley lifted his glass to his lips, but lowered it untasted. He spilled {{half of it}} over the bar. His lips were {{trembling}} like a child that is <b>about</b> <b>to</b> <b>cry.</b> Ned Austin made a clatter in the ice-chest. He wasn't looking for anything. I don't think {{he knew what he}} was doing. Nobody spoke. Harry Burnley's lips were trembling harder than ever. Suddenly, with a most horrible, malignant expression he drove his fist into Kaluna's face. He followed it up. We made no attempt to separate them. We didn't care if he killed the half- caste. It was a terrible beating. We weren't interested. I don't even remember when Burnley ceased and let the poor devil crawl away. We were all too dazed.|$|E
60|$|Then {{a little}} shiver ran through her, and closing her hands tight {{she stared at}} the glass in horror. A face was pressed against it, a drawn, grey face that seemed awry with pain. There was, however, {{something}} that reminded her of somebody in it, and she was <b>about</b> <b>to</b> <b>cry</b> out when she felt a hand laid restrainingly on her arm. Glancing over her shoulder, she saw that her brother was also gazing at the window, and then she knew suddenly to whom the face belonged. It had gone when she looked round again, and it was evident that neither Sewell nor the corporal had seen it. Unfortunately, it appeared very unlikely that the man outside could have seen the latter, and she knew that something must be done, or in another moment or two Prospector Tomlinson would walk into the arms of the policeman. Leger appeared incapable of suggesting anything and was gazing at her with apprehension in his eyes.|$|E
6000|$|The {{expression}} of grief, {{due to the}} contraction of the grief-muscles, {{is by no means}} confined to Europeans, but appears to be common to all the races of mankind. I have, at least, received trustworthy accounts in regard to Hindoos, Dhangars (one of the aboriginal hill-tribes of India, and therefore belonging to a quite distinct race from the Hindoos), Malays, Negroes and Australians. With respect to the latter, two observers answer my query in the affirmative, but enter into no details. Mr. Taplin, however, appends to my descriptive remarks the words [...] "this is exact." [...] With respect to negroes, the lady who told me of Fra Angelico's picture, saw a negro towing a boat on the Nile, and as he encountered an obstruction, she observed his grief-muscles in strong action, with the middle of the forehead well wrinkled. Mr. Geach watched a Malay man in Malacca, with {{the corners of his mouth}} much depressed, the eyebrows oblique, with deep short grooves on the forehead. This expression lasted for a very short time; and Mr. Geach remarks it [...] "was a strange one, very much like a person <b>about</b> <b>to</b> <b>cry</b> at some great loss." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Cry!" [...] Ralph {{repeated}} indignantly. [...] "You don't {{suppose a}} boy of my age is going <b>to</b> <b>cry</b> like a girl! An English boy would be ashamed <b>to</b> <b>cry,</b> especially when Frenchmen were looking on." ...|$|R
50|$|She passionately loves swimming, {{and when}} she swims, she regains her gravity. This leads to the {{proposal}} that if she could be brought <b>to</b> <b>cry,</b> it might break the curse. But nothing can induce her <b>to</b> <b>cry.</b>|$|R
