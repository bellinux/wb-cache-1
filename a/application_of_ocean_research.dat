40|$|The {{ocean surface}} is {{organized}} into regions with distinct properties reflecting {{the complexity of}} interactions between environmental forcing and biological responses. The delineation of these functional units, each with unique, homogeneous properties and underlying ecosystem structure and dynamics, {{can be defined as}} ocean surface partitioning. The main purposes and <b>applications</b> <b>of</b> <b>ocean</b> partitioning include the evaluation of particular marine environments; generation of more accurate satellite ocean colour products; assimilation of data into biogeochemical and climate models; and establishment of ecosystem-based management practices. This paper reviews the diverse approaches implemented for ocean surface partition into functional units, using ocean colour remote sensing (OCRS) data, including their purposes, criteria, methods and scales. OCRS offers a synoptic, high spatial-temporal resolution, multi-decadal coverage of bio-optical properties, relevant to the <b>applications</b> and value <b>of</b> <b>ocean</b> surface partitioning. In combination with other biotic and/or abiotic data, OCRS-derived data (e. g., chlorophyll-a, optical properties) provide a broad and varied source of information that can be analysed using different delineation methods derived from subjective, expert-based to unsupervised learning approaches (e. g., cluster, fuzzy and empirical orthogonal function analyses). Partition schemes are applied at global to mesoscale spatial coverage, with static (time-invariant) or dynamic (time-varying) representations. A case study, the highly heterogeneous area off SW Iberian Peninsula (NE Atlantic), illustrates how the selection of spatial coverage and temporal representation affects the discrimination of distinct environmental drivers of phytoplankton variability. Advances in operational oceanography and in the subject area <b>of</b> satellite <b>ocean</b> colour, including development of new sensors, algorithms and products, are among the potential benefits from extended use, scope and <b>applications</b> <b>of</b> <b>ocean</b> surface partitioning using OCRS. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersio...|$|R

Lilypad Lab focuses on drainage basin and Central Ohio wildlife. The path forking right from the shipwreck leads to the Temple of Poseidon, an “ancient” stone chamber built around a 30-foot tall statue of Poseidon with waterfalls, fountains, and water jets. This second realm focuses not on the study of water, but on the properties of water and the stories it inspires - laminar flow, whirlpools, erosion, water bells, and mythology.|$|R
