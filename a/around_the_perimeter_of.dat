5|$|The {{shopping}} {{levels in}} the Clal Building are exceptionally large, with space for stores and a cinema. Stores are situated <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>perimeter</b> <b>of</b> a large, central atrium. Originally the atrium was open-air, but weather damage forced planners to install a semi-transparent roof. Several banks of elevators access upper-floor offices.|$|E
5|$|At Parken Stadium, {{where the}} final {{was to be}} played, the police erected iron fencing outside to {{separate}} the Arsenal and Galatasaray fans as a precaution. UEFA also requested that fences be put up <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>perimeter</b> <b>of</b> the pitch. The riots did not spread to the stadium, although there {{was an attempt to}} pull down the fences by fans heading towards the Arsenal area of the stadium before police stopped them.|$|E

5|$|Before 1914, a cycling track ran <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>perimeter</b> <b>of</b> {{the pitch}} where regular cycling {{meetings}} were hosted {{as well as}} athletic events. Aside from football-related uses, the stadium has seen various concerts staged along with other sporting events including boxing matches and international rugby league and rugby union matches. In 1999, the last ever final of the UEFA Cup Winners' Cup took place at Villa Park. Villa Park also hosted the 2012 FA Community Shield, as Wembley Stadium was in use for {{the final of the}} Olympic football tournament.|$|E
5|$|Finally, the Acurad system {{employed}} a patented double shot piston design. The {{idea was to}} use a second piston (located within the primary piston) to apply pressure after the shot had partially solidified <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>perimeter</b> <b>of</b> the casting cavity and shot sleeve. While the system was not very effective, it did lead the manufacturer of the Acurad machines, Ube Industries, to discover {{that it was just}} as effective to apply sufficient pressure at the right time later in the cycle with the primary piston; this is indirect squeeze casting.|$|E
5|$|Started in 1743 and {{originally}} {{known as}} Temple Park, Castle Park is located {{to the south}} of the castle. Its original name derived from the Knights Templar, who used to own a manor in Warwick. Houses <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>perimeter</b> <b>of</b> the park were demolished and the land they stood on incorporated into the park. Attempts to make profits from the park in the late 18th century included leasing it for grazing, growing wheat, and keeping sheep.|$|E
2500|$|During {{the second}} eruptive phase 80,000years ago, eruptions {{were no longer}} subglacial, but the volcano was {{surrounded}} by ice at least [...] thick. Lava flows during this eruptive phase melted some of the thick glacial ice and ponded <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>perimeters</b> <b>of</b> Hoodoo Mountain, which quickly solidified to form a barrier behind which more lava piled up. Such ice-marginal lava flows are anomalously thick and are normally bounded by steep cliffs with fine-scale cooling joints and lots of volcanic glass. These ice-marginal lava flows form the massive lava cliffs near the base of Hoodoo Mountain and are among Hoodoo's most prominent features.|$|R

5|$|The fences <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>perimeter</b> <b>of</b> {{the ground}} {{fronting}} the terracing (which were to prevent fans, notably hooligans, running onto the pitch) were removed immediately post Hillsborough, {{in time for}} the rearranged league fixture with Liverpool. The Everton match versus Luton Town in May 1991 was the final time that Gwladys Street allowed standing spectators. Seats were installed in the Paddock, while the Lower Gwladys Street was later completely rebuilt to accommodate seating with new concrete steps.|$|E
5|$|Immature fruit {{bodies are}} spherical—somewhat {{resembling}} puffballs with pointed beaks—and are partially or completely {{buried in the}} ground. As the fungus matures, the outer layer of tissue (the exoperidium) splits into four to eight pointed segments that spread outwards and downwards, lifting and exposing the spherical inner spore sac. The spore sac contains the gleba, a mass of spores and fertile mycelial tissue that when young is white and firm, but ages to become brown and powdery. Often, a layer of the exoperidium splits <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>perimeter</b> <b>of</b> the spore sac so that it appears to rest in a collar or saucer. Atop the spore sac is a small pointed beak, the peristome, which has a small hole from which spores may be released.|$|E
5|$|After Kansas {{failed to}} convert a shot on their next possession, North Carolina {{proceeded}} {{to pass the}} ball <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>perimeter</b> <b>of</b> the court for close to two minutes. After finding the right setup, Lennie Rosenbluth drove to the basket and scored. Following that possession, Kansas began to make outside jump shots. When combined with Carolina's inability to score, Kansas' improved jump shots led to a 102 Kansas run, with Kansas taking the lead nine minutes into the second half. In addition, as North Carolina players continued to foul Chamberlain {{in order to make}} him score from the free throw line, they began to get into foul trouble. Kansas' coach Dick Harp then began to hold the ball beginning with their next possession. Harp's plan worked for a while as Carolina was not able to overcome Kansas' three point lead; Kansas did not attempt a shot for over five minutes.|$|E

5|$|In {{the late}} 16th century, Lyme Regis was an {{important}} port, busier than Liverpool {{and one of the}} main links between England and mainland Europe. The combination of strong Puritan beliefs, and demands from King Charles I for ship money meant that upon the outbreak of the First English Civil War, the town was sympathetic to the Parliamentarian cause. Two local members of parliament (MP), Thomas Trenchard and Walter Erle claimed Lyme Regis for the Parliamentarians in 1642, and set about fortifying the town. Thomas Ceeley, another local MP, was assigned as governor of the town and its forces. He immediately set about removing those with Royalist loyalties from the area, and sent harrying forces around the region, as far as Exeter and Somerset. Lyme Regis had no permanent fortifications, and so Robert Blake established a set of earthen walls, ditches and forts <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>perimeter</b> <b>of</b> the town.|$|E
5|$|On 21 May 1956, a B-52B (52-0013) {{dropped a}} Mk-15 nuclear bomb over the Bikini Atoll {{in a test}} code-named Cherokee. It was the first air-dropped {{thermonuclear}} weapon. From 24 to 25 November 1956, four B-52Bs of the 93rd BW and four B-52Cs of the 42nd BW flew nonstop <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>perimeter</b> <b>of</b> North America in Operation Quick Kick, which covered 15,530miles (13,500nmi, 25,000km) in 31 hours, 30 minutes. SAC noted the flight time could have been reduced by 5 to 6 hours had the four inflight refuelings been done by fast jet-powered tanker aircraft rather than propeller-driven Boeing KC-97 Stratofreighters. In {{a demonstration of the}} B-52's global reach, from 16 to 18 January 1957, three B-52Bs made a non-stop flight around the world during Operation Power Flite, during which 24,325miles (21,145nmi, 39,165km) was covered in 45 hours 19 minutes (536.8 smph) with several in-flight refuelings by KC-97s.|$|E
5|$|The upper {{handling}} {{room was}} {{just below the}} visible part of the mount. It was armored and reinforced to support {{the weight of the}} mount. A person standing in the upper handling room could look up and see the bottom of the gun mount inside the training circle on which the mount rotated. Hanging from the mount, and rotating with it, was the equipment used to pass ammunition up to the mount. This included the lower ends of the projectile and powder case hoists. In {{the center of the room}} there was a vertical tube that also turned with the mount. This tube enclosed the electrical power and control cables going up to the mount. <b>Around</b> <b>the</b> <b>perimeter</b> <b>of</b> the upper handling room were the ready service ammunition racks welded to the bulkheads. Close by, either in a corner of the handling room or in an adjoining compartment was the upper end of an ammunition hoist from the magazine. The responsibility of the men stationed in the upper handling room was to shuttle 30 to 40 projectiles and 30 to 40 powder cases per minute from the ready service racks to the hoists while avoiding the equipment rotating with the mount. During quiet spells, they would replenish the ready service racks with ammunition from the magazines.|$|E
50|$|The lazy {{river was}} three-feet deep {{and made a}} circuit <b>around</b> <b>the</b> outer <b>perimeter</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> park.

5|$|Where battle {{could not}} be avoided, the late army broadly {{followed}} traditional practice as regards array. Heavy infantry would be drawn up in a main line, normally straight and several ranks deep. Mounted archers were stationed, together with light-armed slingers, {{in front of the}} main infantry line. Cavalry would be posted on the wings (light cavalry on the outside). Foot archers would form the rear rank(s) of the main infantry line. There would be a reserve line of infantry and cavalry of variable strength, {{to the rear of the}} main line, in order to deal with breaches in the main line and to exploit opportunities. At a distance of a mile or so to the rear of the army, its fortified camp of the previous night would contain its assistants and baggage, guarded by a small garrison. The camp could act as a refuge if the army was put to flight. Roman armies in the field never camped overnight without constructing defences. A ditch would be dug <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>perimeter</b> <b>of</b> the camp, and the spoil used to erect a rampart, which would then be topped with a palisade of sharpened wooden stakes arranged cross-hatched to form an impenetrable screen. Such defences, systematically patrolled, effectively precluded surprise attacks and enabled the troops to get a good night's sleep.|$|E
5|$|The 1996–97 season saw Oxford finish seventeenth, and {{included}} {{the sale of}} Scottish international defender Matt Elliott to Leicester City. Despite Smith's departure to West Bromwich Albion in December 1997, United finished twelfth the following season under his successor, and former captain, Malcolm Shotton. Shotton was previously the assistant manager of the Barnsley side that gained promotion to the Premier League. During October 1998, the backroom staff at the club went unpaid, due to United's financial situation with the new stadium, {{and the threat of}} administration caused a group of fans to set up a pressure group called Fighting for Oxford United's Life (FOUL). The group began to publicise the club's plight through a series of meetings and events, including a 'Scarf of Unity', which was a collection of scarfs from various clubs which was long enough to stretch <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>perimeter</b> <b>of</b> the pitch. Chairman Robin Herd stepped down to concentrate on his engineering projects, and in April 1999 Firoz Kassam bought Herd's 89.9% controlling interest in Oxford United for £1, with which he also inherited the club's estimated £15 million debt. Kassam reduced the £9 million of the debt to just £900,000, by virtue of a Company Voluntary Arrangement, by which unsecured creditors who were owed over £1,000 were reimbursed with 10p for every pound they were owed. Secured creditors were paid off when Kassam sold the Manor to another of his companies, for £6 million. Kassam set about completing the unfinished stadium, gaining planning permission for a bowling alley, multiplex cinema and hotel next to the stadium, following a series of legal battles which were eventually all settled. The season ended with relegation back to the Second Division.|$|E
