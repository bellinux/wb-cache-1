40|$|Security of a Multi-Processor System on Chip (MPSoC) is an {{emerging}} {{area of concern}} in embedded systems. MPSoC security is jeopardized by Code Injection attacks. Code Injection attacks, which {{are the most common}} types of software attacks, have plagued single processor systems. Design of MPSoCs must therefore incorporate security as one of the primary objectives. Code Injection attacks exploit vulnerabilities in " and legacy code. An architecture with a dedicated monitoring processor (MONITOR) is employed to simultaneously supervise the <b>application</b> <b>processors</b> on an MPSoC. The program code in the <b>application</b> <b>processors</b> is divided into basic blocks. The basic blocks in the <b>application</b> <b>processors</b> are statically instrumented with special instructions that allow communication with the MONITOR at runtime. The MONITOR verifies the execution of all the processors at runtime using control flow checks and either a timing or instruction count check. This thesis proposes a monitoring system called SOFTMON, a design methodology called SHIELD, a design flow called LOCS and an architectural framework called CUFFS for detecting Code Injection attacks. SOFTMON, a software monitoring system, uses a software algorithm in the MONITOR. SOFTMON incurs limited area overheads. However, the runtime performance overhead is quite high. SHIELD, an extension to the work in SOFTMON overcomes the limitation of high runtime overhead using a MONITOR that is predominantly hardware based. LOCS uses only one special instruction per basic block compared to two, {{as was the case in}} SOFTMON and SHIELD. Additionally, profile information is generated for all the basic blocks in all the <b>application</b> <b>processors</b> for the MPSoC designer to tune the design by increasing or decreasing the frequency of loop basic blocks. CUFFS detects attacks even without <b>application</b> <b>processors</b> communicating to the MONITOR. The SOFTMON, SHIELD and LOCS approaches can only detect attacks if the <b>application</b> <b>processors</b> communicate to the MONITOR. CUFFS relies on the exact number of instructions in basic blocks to determine an attack, rather than time-frame based measures used in SOFTMON, SHIELD and LOCS. The lowest runtime performance overhead was achieved by LOCS (worst case of 37. 5...|$|R

40|$|Security of MPSoCs is an {{emerging}} {{area of concern}} in embedded sys-tems. Security is jeopardized by code injection attacks, which {{are the most common}} types of software attacks. Previous attempts to detect code injection in MPSoCs have been burdened with significant per-formance overheads. In this work, we present a hardware/software methodology “SHIELD ” to detect code injection attacks in MPSoCs. SHIELD instruments the software programs running on <b>application</b> <b>processors</b> in the MPSoC and also extracts control flow and basic block execution time information for runtime checking. We employ a dedicated security processor (monitor processor) to supervise the <b>application</b> <b>processors</b> on the MPSoC. Custom hardware is designed and used in the monitor and <b>application</b> <b>processors.</b> The monitor processor uses the custom hardware to rapidly analyze infor-mation communicated to it from the <b>application</b> <b>processors</b> at runtime. We have implemented SHIELD on a commercial extensible processor (Xtensa LX 2) and tested it on a multiprocessor JPEG encoder pro-gram. In addition to code injection attacks, the system is also able to detect 83 % of bit flips errors in the control flow instructions. The experiments show that SHIELD produces systems with runtime which is at least 9 times faster than the previous solution. SHIELD in-curs a runtime (clock cycles) performance overhead of only 6. 6 % and an area overhead of 26. 9 %, when compared to a non-secure system...|$|R
