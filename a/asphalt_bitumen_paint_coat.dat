The reinforcing steels were coated with local coating materials (i) <b>bitumen,</b> (ii) enamel <b>paint,</b> and (iii) local anti-rust paint.

Design, construction and maintenance facilitate asphalt roads to provide the high standards of safety and comfortable but certain areas of a road are higher stressed than others. For that reason road paving industry is interested in utilizing alternative and sustainable binder materials for modified asphalt to improve the production, placement and performance of asphalt mixtures. However, sources of materials should be considered economically and environtmentally viable after applied in pavement. According to previous research, that has been developed that non crude petroleum binder derived from the production of bio-oil through fast pyrolysis of biomass. The main source of bio-oil can be contributed from biomass industry or renewable organic industry such as timber waste, oil palm waste, rice husk; coconut trunk fibers, municipal waste and sugar cane waste. Alternatively, the bio-oil can be as substitute material as modification of asphalt.

The first part of this dissertation is aimed at developing an understanding of the viscoelastic mechanical response of asphalt bitumen-CNT composites. Dynamic mechanical analysis experiments were designed to investigate the effect on viscoelastic behavior, including shear storage and loss moduli, the damping coefficient, stress relaxation moduli, and the multiple stress creep recovery (MSCR) behavior of the composites. Frequency scans show that the shear storage modulus, the shear loss modulus, and the stress relaxation modulus all increase with CNT loading, and increase as the test frequency increases. Additionally, the viscoelastic studies demonstrate <b>asphalt</b> <b>bitumen</b> becomes more elastic with an increase in CNT loading. CNTs improve cross-linking between the polymeric chains in the bitumen system. An industry standard penetration test reveals that the penetration index decreases with CNT loading. Multiple stress creep recovery (MSCR) analyses show that, with increasing CNT loading, strain recovery increases and the non-recoverable compliance decreases.

The temperature of the composites increases with exposure time. The temperature of the composites also increases with CNT loading, and with an increase {{in the power of the}} microwaves...|$|R

30|$|Due to {{its high}} compatibility, high {{temperature}} resistance, and high salt tolerance, oil sludge {{is also used}} {{in the production of}} asphalt concrete (Qinga et al. 2008). <b>Asphalt,</b> or <b>bitumen,</b> must be resistant to harsh conditions over the long term (Lewandowski 1994). Bituminous mixtures are used in Iran in mixes to form asphalt mixed with aggregates. There are different types of asphalt surfacing, e.g., for paved roads and airports. Aggregates are usually natural, synthetic or indirectly produced by factories producing melted metals. In most cases, natural stones have to broken down by crushers to achieve the fine grade required for mixing in with asphalt.
