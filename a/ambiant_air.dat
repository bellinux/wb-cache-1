40|$|International audienceThe work {{proposed}} {{deals with}} the diagnostics of a DC laminar argon plasma jet operating at atmospheric pressure in <b>ambiant</b> <b>air</b> using three techniques. Through the pumping effect of <b>ambiant</b> <b>air</b> by the laminar jet, {{it is possible to}} observe the UV OH spectrum at 306. 357 nm and to perform emission spectroscopy in order to carry out the OH rotational temperature close to the thermodynamic temperature of the gas. In addition, measurements of the refractive index is made by considering two different methods: optical interferometry and quantitative shadowgraphy. It is showed that the temperature obtained by the three diagnostics techniques are very close...|$|E
40|$|The {{study is}} made in the frame of a {{follow-up}} monitoring of all landfill sites in Wallonia, initiated by the Ministry of Environment and managed by ISSeP. The present report concerns a second campaign on the landfill site "Cour-au-Bois" at Braine-le-Château. The usual field inspection technique was applied together with a GC-MS analysis aiming at determining the chemical composition of the <b>ambiant</b> <b>air</b> around the tipping area...|$|E
40|$|The thermal {{behavior}} of tree trunks is currently only partially understood despite its {{great importance to}} forest productivity and climatic effects. From a remote sensing viewpoint, {{a better understanding of}} the relationship between the thermal regime of a tree and its thermal and microwave signal is necessary. The present study addresses two main questions: (1) How do tree trunk temperatures vary, spatially and temporally, in relation to different environmental factors. (2) How can observed thermal infrared radiations from the trunks describe these variations, and with which level of precision. In this study, measurements of internal temperatures (made with thermocouples), and of surface temperatures (made with thermographic images) of tree trunks under winter and summer conditions allowed us to describe the thermal {{behavior of}} trees. Results show that the radiant energy absorption can raise the surface and internal temperatures very rapidly and by several degrees above the <b>ambiant</b> <b>air</b> temperature. The temperature distribution tends to be highly asymmetric, with differences as large as 20 ÀC between the hottest and coldest areas of the trunk...|$|E
40|$|The {{uncertainty}} of benzene measurements {{obtained by the}} analysis of thermally desorbable Radiello diffusive samplers was evaluated according to the recent standard EN 14662 - 4 (2005). Considering the results of laboratory experiments, all the sources of uncertainty regarding the diffusive sampler method characteristics were accessed for the sampling times of 7 and 14 days. The {{major part of the}} uncertainty budget (> 79 %) was explained by the variation of the sampling rate due to the environmental factors (temperature and concentration level). For weekly sampling, the diffusive sampler method satisfies the data quality objectives of the European Directive to supply the indicative measurements as well as the reference measurement, since the expanded uncertainty is found lower than 25 %. Using a model-predicted sampling rate which depends on the concentration and temperature, the expanded uncertainty is significantly decreased. The Radiello sampler was found to give correct results for weekly sampling provided that the range of benzene concentrations remained between 0 and 10 µg. m- 3, which is generally observed in ambient air monitoring. For 2 -week sampling, the expanded {{uncertainty of}} measurements exceeds 30 %. However, this diffusive sampler can still be used to carry out an objective evaluation of benzene (minimum quality objective for the accuracy of 100 %). Therefore, the performance of this diffusive sampler method appears to be suitable for the benzene monitoring in <b>ambiant</b> <b>air.</b> JRC. H. 4 -Transport and air qualit...|$|E
