5|$|A 1998 MIT study {{concluded}} that a systemic bias against female faculty existed in its School of Science, although the study's methods were controversial. Since the study, though, women have headed departments within the Schools of Science and of Engineering, and MIT has appointed several female vice presidents, although allegations of sexism continue to be made.

5|$|Another non-animal {{research}} method is in silico or computer simulation and mathematical modeling {{which seeks to}} investigate and ultimately predict toxicity and drug affects in humans without using animals.

5|$|Clathrus ruber is {{the type}} species of the genus Clathrus, and {{is part of the}} group of Clathrus species known as the Laternoid series.

According to <b>a</b> <b>molecular</b> analysis published in 2006, out of the about 40 Phallales species used in the study, C.ruber is most closely related to Aseroe rubra, Clathrus archeri, Laternea triscapa, and Clathrus chrysomycelinus.|$|E
5|$|Complex: These viruses {{possess a}} capsid that is neither purely helical nor purely icosahedral, {{and that may}} possess extra {{structures}} such as protein tails or a complex outer wall. Some bacteriophages, such as Enterobacteria phage T4, have a complex structure consisting of an icosahedral head bound to a helical tail, which may have a hexagonal base plate with protruding protein tail fibres. This tail structure acts like <b>a</b> <b>molecular</b> syringe, attaching to the bacterial host and then injecting the viral genome into the cell.|$|E

5|$|In {{contrast}} to ion pumps, ion channels do not build chemical gradients but rather dissipate {{them in order}} to perform work or send a signal. Probably the most familiar and best studied example is the voltage-gated Na+ channel, which allows conduction of an action potential along neurons. All ion pumps have some sort of trigger or “gating” mechanism. In the previous example it was electrical bias, but other channels can be activated by binding <b>a</b> <b>molecular</b> agonist or through a conformational change in another nearby protein.|$|E
