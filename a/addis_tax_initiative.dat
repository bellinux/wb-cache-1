40|$|In a {{model of}} a {{representative}} democracy, we incorporate into the analysis of tax design the constitutional provision that allows voters to propose <b>tax</b> <b>initiatives.</b> In this paper, we present a theory of tax substitution as the rationale for a tax rate limit (TRL) initiative. In our model the tax system at the status quo is determined by the electoral competition between parties. This political institution aggregates the voters’ preferences for tax policy according to the voters’ marginal proportion of the expected vote that different coalition of voters can deliver in the election. The approval of a TRL, however, depends on the majority rule, and it aggregates the preferences of the median voter of <b>tax</b> <b>initiatives.</b> Thus, a TRL is the result of two political institutions with different mechanisms to aggregate the preferences of voters. Moreover, our paper distinguishes the role of perfect and imperfect information on the distribution of voters´ preferences for tax systems in approving a <b>tax</b> <b>initiative.</b> In this paper we identify conditions on the distribution of preferences and income of the electorate and the median voter that guarantee the approval (rejection) of <b>tax</b> <b>initiatives.</b> Taxation, <b>Tax</b> Limitations, Redistributive Effects, Structure and Scope of Government...|$|R

40|$|The {{international}} financial crisis which {{broke out in}} 2008 has had {{a major impact on}} fiscal sustainability of countries all over the world. Countries have responded with varying measures. Moreover, {{in the aftermath of the}} global financial crisis, international <b>initiatives</b> regarding <b>tax</b> governance have gained political momentum; various initiatives regarding fiscal policy have been taken at the global level, and several policies with implications for national tax policy and law are conducted at that level. Therefore, this paper will give an overview of the international <b>tax</b> <b>initiatives</b> at the level of the Group of Twenty (G- 20), the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), the United Nations (UN), the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Trade Organization (WTO). These international <b>tax</b> <b>initiatives</b> cannot be referred to as "international tax law". It would be more appropriate to see them as a hesitant beginning of a form of "global tax governance". This contribution will show that the unequivocal fiscal principle of ‘no taxation without representation’ poses an important challenge for the emergence of legitimate global tax governance, as most of the international initiatives lack an inclusive process. Whereas multiple international <b>tax</b> <b>initiatives</b> exist, we cannot yet discern the existence of globally effective tax governance...|$|R
