40|$|The paper {{presents}} the results of an experimental monitoring campaign carried out in a new-built Hybrid Operating Theater (OT). Fine Particles (FP) and Ultra Fine Particles (UFP) concentrations have been measured during 18 real surgery activities. The experimental campaign encompassed different types of surgeries, taking into <b>account</b> valuable <b>info</b> about use of Electro-Surgical Tools (ESTs), number of people inside OT and door openings frequency. Experimental results revealed a strict connection between the use of ESTs and the increase of fine and ultrafine particles concentration near surgical area due to surgical smoke which spreads out from the operating table towards the outer and less clean zone of the Hybrid OT. Tough it seems reasonable to assume that surgical smoke is potentially dangerous to both patients and personnel in operation rooms, both the generation rate and the exposure levels to UFP are, so far, quite unknown and undervalued. Our study shows that UFP in the surgical smoke generated by ESTs, and particularly by argon diathermy, affect the indoor air quality in OT...|$|R

40|$|The {{possibility}} of forming polycrystalline silicon films by pulse thermal annealing {{has been investigated}} using measurement of a photo-e. m. f., dark and light voltage-current characteristics. Investigated samples were resistors of rectangular form with the dimensions 400 x 40 µm² and had contact areas covering 100 x 100 µm². Ohmic behavior of contacts was ensured by additive diffusion of phosphorus atoms info the film under aluminium electrodes. It is shown that the samples before thermal treatment have utterly symmetrical dark and light voltage-current characteristics, which are essentially changed after samples treatment: at low applied voltages the samples resistance rises more than the order of its magnitude, and a value of a asymmetry coefficient reaches 20. Obtained results have been analyzed {{from the viewpoint of}} the model of polycrystalline film conductance taking <b>info</b> <b>account</b> intergranular barriers of the Shottky type. The conclusion is made that optimization of modes of thermal treatment regimes will enable to get rid from electroforming during fabrication of photocells based on such polycrystalline silicon film...|$|R
40|$|Part I {{concerns}} {{the analysis of}} the infrastructural problems at hand in San Pedro de la Paz. To get insight into the problems first an analysis of the location is made. This analysis involves the geographical characteristics of the city, historical development, land use, infrastructure etc. Based on this analysis a problem description is made. The major problem is the congestion of Ruta 160. This problem has different causes: the inter-communal traffic flows, trucks, public transport deficiency, connectivity of the secondary roads and organisational problems. To solve the congestion on Ruta 160 several solutions have been proposed by different parties. These proposed solutions are elaborated upon with figures of the road profiles and tables containing the road characteristics. To improve the congestion on Ruta 160 these solutions are combined into variants by the research team. The most promising variants are filtered using a set of constraints and demands. Finally in Part 1 the criteria that are used in the Multi-criteria analysis (MCA) of Part 4 are introduced and explained. These criteria are: time, costs, environmental impact, social impact, safety, comfort and co-benefits. Part II considers the Biobío River and the Los Batros wetlands north of the Ruta 160 Bridge. The influence of the infrastructure variants Costanera Sur, Puente Industrial and Ruta Humedal on this inland water system is analysed. For this analysis two existing 1 D HEC-RAS models of the Biobío River and Los Batros are modified to meet the current and proposed situations. The design conditions that are used for both models are discharges with a return period of 100 years. Also other discharges are used in order to evaluate the effects of the infrastructure for different situations. The results show that the water level in the Biobío River increases with a maximum of 10 centimetres due to the presence of Puente Industrial and Costanera Sur. The water level in (Estero) Los Batros experiences a negligible increase due to the presence of Ruta Humedal. The resulting water levels and LiDAR topography data are also used to create an inundation map for San Pedro de la Paz and the Biobío River. It can be concluded that in the present situation no mentionable floods occur along the southern bank of the Biobío River. This is also the case for the Costanera Sur situation since the riverbanks are heightened. For the design condition flooding occurs for parts of Los Batros. Ruta Humedal does not increase the flooded area in Los Batros but protects a part of the farmland located in that area from flooding. Several roads are also analysed on the tsunami impact with the NEOWAVE model. These roads consist of Ruta Costa (elevated coastal highway), Costanera Sur (elevated road along the riverbank) and Ruta Humedal (through the wetlands). They are combined into three different combinations: (I) Costanera Sur and Ruta Humedal, (II) Costanera Sur and Ruta Costa and (III) Costanera Sur, Ruta Humedal and Ruta Costa. To assess these combinations properly, first the generation of a tsunami by an earthquake is explained. Then an earthquake scenario has to be devised in order {{to come up with a}} worst case tsunami scenario. This scenario is derived from multiple major earthquakes that generated tsunamis that affected the coastal area around San Pedro de la Paz over the last centuries. This has led to a scenario MW 8. 9 and MW 9. 0, which both show inundation of the coastal area of San Pedro de la Paz but in different amounts. Since the amount of inundation of MW 8. 9 is not significant enough for a detailed analysis, only the results of MW 9. 0 are used. This scenario overtops the dunes and inundates the coastal neighbourhoods. In the case combination (II) and (III) this coastal inundation is completely prevented, only Los Batros has a small amount of inundation. Combination (I) does not prevent coastal inundation and seems to increase the amount of inundation in Los Batros. However, this increase of inundation in Los Batros could be due to deviations in the model itself and needs more research. Part IV starts with {{the analysis of the}} different solutions based on the criteria as defined in Part 1. The analysis is followed by the MCA. The MCA consists of three different steps. The first step is the weighting of the criteria. In this step the relative importance of the criteria is determined. This is done using pairwise combination of criteria. The pairwise combination of the criteria is presented in a survey to the research team and students of the UCSC. The weights of the different criteria as determined by both the students and the research team are used in the MCA. The results show major difference in what the students think are important criteria and what the research team thinks are in important criteria. The students view safety, time and costs as most important criteria. But the members of the research prioritize safety, environmental impact and social impact. Step 2 {{concerns the}} scoring of the different proposed solutions and the variants. The solutions are given a score for every criterion as defined in Part 1. This scoring is done by the research team and based on the analysis as done in Part 4. The absolutes scores from Part 2 show significant difference on solution level. The two proposed solutions with the highest scores are Ruta Costa and Ruta 160. The improvement of Pedro Aguirre Cerda scores relatively low. On variant level the differences are much smaller. The variants that have the highest scores are variant 1 A and 1 B. Step 3 of the MCA takes into <b>account</b> the <b>info</b> from the previous both steps by multiplying the absolute scores of step 2 with the weight of the criteria as determined in step 1. This multiplication results in the so-called relative weighted score. By taking into account the relative weights of the criteria the ranking of the variants changes significantly. When using the weights as defined by the students, variant 1 A scores the highest. When taking into account the weights of the criteria as defined by the research variant 1 B comes out on top.

40|$|La Ville de Nice bénéficie de deux {{ressources}} en eau d'excellente qualité, la Vésubie et la nappe alluviale du Var, qui se caractérisent par leur très faible teneur en matière organique biodégradable. La Compagnie Générale des Eaux, gestionnaire de son alimentation en eau potable, applique depuis sa mise au point au début du siècle le procédé de désinfection par l'ozone et distribue une eau sans ajouter de chlore. Un diagnostic complet de la qualité microbiologique et sanitaire de ce réseau non chloré et sans Carbone Organique Dissous Biodégradable (CODB) a été entrepris. Le suivi de la qualité de l'eau dans le réseau a consisté en des campagnes de prélèvements à partir de plusieurs points d'observation répartis sur l'ensemble du réseau. Ce suivi a permis de confirmer la bonne qualité de l'eau distribuée et le maintien de cette qualité tout au long de son transport dans les canalisations. Le CODB est absent sur l'ensemble des points confirmant l'absence de relargage et de contamination pendant le transport. La récupération des dépôts présents dans les canalisations n'a pas révélé de colonisation du réseau par des micro-organismes supérieurs. La quantité de biofilm présente sur les parois des canalisations a été évaluée en suivant la colonisation de pastilles de matériau immergées dans les réservoirs. Ce diagnostic complet de l'état microbiologique et sanitaire du réseau de Nice {{montre que}} l'absence de chloration n'entraîne pas de dégradation de la qualité bactériologique de l'eau et que c'est essentiellement l'absence de matière organique biodégradable qui limite la croissance bactérienne et qui contribue au maintien de la qualité de l'eau dans le réseau de distribution. Within {{the more general}} scope of studies aiming at a better knowledge of the mechanisms responsible for biological biodegradation in water systems, {{it was interesting to}} learn the microbiological behaviour of a drinking water network supplied with water free of biodegradable organics. The case in point is the town of Nice which enjoys excellent quality water ressources, {{to the extent that the}} Compagnie Générale des Eaux, managers of the municipal water utility, were able to apply ozonation as a disinfectant when the technique first appeared at the beginning of the century, and supply chlorine free water. The Municipal Services of the Town of Nice, the Nice Health Laboratory and the Compagnie Générale des Eaux bave therefore combined forces to carry out a study on the development of water quality in the supply network in such an animal environment. The objective is to make a complete diagnosis of the microbiological and hygienic quality of a chlorine-free network which would confirm the excellent quality of the distributed water and serve as a reference within the scope of general research on the removal of biodegradable organics for the supply of non chlorinated water. The study consisted of monitoring three supply systems fed by three different water works :- the Super Rimiez plant treating water from the river Vésubie in the following stages : flocculation, primary clarification, sand filtration and virucidal ozonation;-the Jean Moreno plant : water pumped from the alluvion layers of the Var and ozonated;-the Prairies plant : pumping and temporary chlorination of the Var aquifer with chlorine dioxyde. In order to take seasonal variations <b>info</b> <b>account,</b> our study lasted for a whole year, with sampling campaigns every two weeks on 20 observation points along the network, and on the raw water treated in three production plants. The physico-chemical and microbiological characteristics of the water samples were analyzed. Samples were collected at a high flow rate from fire hydrants near the observation points. The sediments were gathered in a plankton net and analyzed to detect the presence of possible animalcules. The immersion of PVC coupons in two reservoirs, fed respectively with the two types of water, enabled the growth kinetics of fixed bacteria to be followed, and the quantifies of fixed biomass at steady state to be compared. It was possible, by monitoring the chloride content (on average 25 mg Cl¯/l in Var water compared with 5 mg Cl¯/l in Vésubie water), to identify the precise influence of the two water resources. Total bacteria measured by epilluorescence are not very high compared with networks in other large towns. It will be noted, however, that the figure is higher in the network supplied from the Vésubie than in those treating water from the Var aquifer. Bacterial regrowth in circulating water is minor, showing that the influence of bacteria released by the biofilm installed on the pipe walls is minimized. This biofilm is present just the same, as is shown by the results of colonization an the immersed coupons in reservoirs. The quantity of fixed bacteria at steady state is different according to the type of water but, in both cases, it was lower than the figure obtained with water loaded with biodegradable organics. The total plate count remains low on the whole, even at end sections of the network. The presence at fecal bacteria was only observed at a few points during some of the studies and the Nice network, on the whole, is of excellent quality judged by the very few fecal contamination indicators found. The presence of Aeromonas hydrophila was detected in very small quantities and at a few of the sampling points only. Analyses of Dissolved Organic Carbon (on average 0. 3 mgC/l) and Biodegradable Dissolved Organic Carbon (less than 0. 1 mgC/l, by the minimum detection threshold method) reveal a very low concentration in organics and a total absence of BDOC on all sampling points, thus confirming the good quality of the water supplied and the tact that these is very little bacteria) remise and contamination while the water is in transit. Examination of the sediments in water mains and at the bottom of reservoirs did not reveal the existence of higher forma of microorganisms. This complete diagnosis of the mirobiological and health condition of the Nice water system has brought confirmation of the good quality of the water supplied throughout its transit in the water mains. The lack of chlorination dues not cause a deterioration of the bacteriological quality of the water, the sustainable quality of which is essentially linked with the absence of BDOC which restricting the growth of bacteria. The importance of these findings on such a distinctive network as that of the Nice utility will enable this study to be used as reference for future research on the means of maintaining the quality of water in supply networks without using chlorine...|$|R
