5|$|Several anti-angiogenesis drugs {{approved}} for other conditions, such <b>as</b> <b>cancer,</b> {{have been investigated}} in small clinical trials. The anti-VEGF antibody bevacizumab, for instance, has been used off-label in several studies. In the largest study conducted so far, bevacizumab infusion {{was associated with a}} decrease in cardiac output and reduced duration and number of episodes of epistaxis in treated HHT patients. Thalidomide, another anti-angiogenesis drug, was also reported to have beneficial effects in HHT patients. Thalidomide treatment was found to induce vessel maturation in an experimental mouse model of HHT and to reduce the severity and frequency of nosebleeds in the majority {{of a small group of}} HHT patients. The blood hemoglobin levels of these treated patients rose as a result of reduced hemorrhage and enhanced blood vessel stabilization.|$|E

5|$|In humans, plasma {{triglycerides}} such as triacylglycerols {{have been}} long debated {{as an important}} risk factor for not only cardiovascular disease but also for other relevant morbidities, such <b>as</b> <b>cancer,</b> renal disease, suicide, and all-cause mortality. The APOA5 gene was found by comparative sequencing of ~200 kbp of human and mice DNA as the last member of the gene cluster of apolipoproteins located on human chromosome 11 at 11q23. Two mouse transgenic mouse models (APOA5 transgenic and APOA5 knockout) confirmed {{the important role of}} this gene in plasma triglyceride levels of plasma triglycerides. Obesity and metabolic syndrome are both closely related to plasma triglyceride levels and APOA5. Recent meta-analyses suggest that the effect on metabolic syndrome development is more profound for rs662799 in Asian population and for rs3135506 for Europeans. Moreover, meta-analysis that focused on rs662799 and the risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus has suggested a significant association in Asian populations, but not in European populations.|$|E

40|$|Androgen {{receptor}} (AR) protein {{expression and}} function {{are critical for}} survival and proliferation of androgen-sensitive (<b>AS)</b> prostate <b>cancer</b> cells. Besides its ability {{to function as a}} transcription factor, experimental observations suggest that AR becomes a licensing factor for DNA replication in <b>AS</b> prostate <b>cancer</b> cells and thus must be degraded during each cell cycle in these cells to allow reinitiation of DNA replication in the next cell cycle. This possibility was tested by using the <b>AS</b> human prostate <b>cancer</b> cell lines, LNCaP, CWR 22 Rv 1, and LAPC- 4. These studies demonstrated that AR levels fluctuate both within and between various phases of the cell cycle in each of these AS lines. Consistent with its licensing ability, AR is degraded during mitosis via a proteasome-dependent pathway in these <b>AS</b> prostate <b>cancer</b> cells. In contrast, proteasome-dependent degradation of AR during mitosis is not observed in AR-expressing but androgen-insensitive human prostate stromal cells, in which AR does not function as a licensing factor for DNA replication. To evaluate mitotic degradation of AR in vivo, the same series of human <b>AS</b> prostate <b>cancers</b> growing <b>as</b> xenografts in nude mice and malignant tissues obtained directly from prostate cancer patients were evaluated by dual Ki- 67 and AR immunohistochemistry for AR expression in mitosis. These results document that AR is also down-regulated during mitosis in vivo. Thus, <b>AS</b> prostate <b>cancer</b> cells do not express AR protein during mitosis, either in vitro or in vivo, consistent with AR functioning as a licensing factor for DNA replication in <b>AS</b> prostate <b>cancer</b> cells...|$|R
