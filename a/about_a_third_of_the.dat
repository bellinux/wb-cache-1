5|$|Soviet {{composer}} Dmitri Shostakovich (1906–1975) {{completed his}} Symphony No. 7 on 27 December 1941 and dedicated {{it to his}} native Leningrad. At the time the city was about 16 weeks into its 900-day siege by Nazi German forces, which would kill <b>about</b> <b>a</b> <b>third</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> city's pre-war population.|$|E
5|$|Ammianus {{reports that}} 6,000 Germans perished on the {{battlefield}} and in the pursuit on land. (Libanius gives a figure of 8,000). Thousands more drowned {{as they tried to}} get across the river. It is thus likely that <b>about</b> <b>a</b> <b>third</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> German force lost their lives. However, it appears that the majority escaped, including the eight reges alongside Chnodomar. The Romans lost just 243 men, including four tribuni (regimental commanders) of which two were commanders of cataphracti.|$|E
5|$|Development {{continued}} as lots were sold southward to present day Oak Street, <b>about</b> <b>a</b> <b>third</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> way between Broadway and the House of Refuge. The principal road through the suburb {{at this time}} was Central Plank Road, which became Third Street. The emerging area was called the Southern Extension by this time.

5|$|Officials {{declared}} <b>about</b> <b>a</b> <b>third</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{state of}} Queensland as a disaster area following Cyclone Joy, directing state funds toward recovery efforts. The Queensland government provided monetary assistance to eligible {{families in the}} disaster zone and offered special loans to farmers affected by the storm. The federal government agreed to contribute 75%of overall relief costs. Following the cyclone's impacts in Australia, the name Joy was later retired by the World Meteorological Organization.|$|E
5|$|The global {{mortality}} rate from the 1918/1919 pandemic is not known, but an estimated 10% to 20% {{of those who}} were infected died. With <b>about</b> <b>a</b> <b>third</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> world population infected, this case-fatality ratio means 3% to 6% of the entire global population died. Influenza may have killed as many as 25million people in its first 25 weeks. Older estimates say it killed 40–50million people, while current estimates say 50–100million people worldwide were killed.|$|E

Since the late 1980s, Cameroon has been following programmes advocated by the World Bank and International Monetary Fund (IMF) to reduce poverty, privatise industries, and increase economic growth. The government has taken measures to encourage tourism in the country.|$|E

5|$|Although {{there is}} no {{reliable}} documentation of the demographic impact of the Black Death in Scotland, there are some indications of the immediate effects of the plague. Walter Bower recorded that 24, <b>about</b> <b>a</b> <b>third,</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> canons of St. Andrews died during the outbreak. There are also anecdotal references to abandoned land in the following decades. If the pattern followed that in England, then the population may have fallen to as low as half a million {{by the end of}} the fifteenth century. Compared with the distribution of population after the later Clearances and the Industrial Revolution, these numbers would have been relatively evenly spread over the kingdom, with roughly half living north of the River Tay.|$|E
5|$|By December, {{the bottom}} {{had dropped out}} of the {{commemorative}} coin market, and dealers who had purchased quantities found themselves unable to dispose of them at a profit. By 1940 the coin sets were selling for $15 per set. They thereafter recovered, and by the early 1960s had reached $100 a set, and by 1975 $550 per set of three. At the height of the second commemorative coin boom in 1980, they sold for $2,250 a set. R.S. Yeoman's A Guide Book of United States Coins, published in 2015, lists the sets at between $875 and $2,700 depending on condition. Individual coins are cataloged at <b>about</b> <b>a</b> <b>third</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> set prices.|$|E
5|$|During the 19th century various new {{industries}} were introduced, including lime quarrying. During {{the early decades}} of the 20th century the population exceeded 1,000; but this was followed by a lengthy decline. Although resident numbers are now less than 200, there was a small increase from 2001 to 2011. <b>About</b> <b>a</b> <b>third</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> population were recorded as Gaelic speaking at the former date. The modern economy is largely based on farming, fishing and tourism and the largest settlement is Achnacroish. Various shipwrecks have been recorded in the vicinity.|$|E

5|$|For {{more than}} 2,000 years, the Chadian Basin has been {{inhabited}} by agricultural and sedentary people. The region became a crossroads of civilizations. The earliest {{of these were}} the legendary Sao, known from artifacts and oral histories. The Sao fell to the Kanem Empire, the first and longest-lasting of the empires that developed in Chad's Sahelian strip {{by the end of}} the 1st millennium AD. Two other states in the region, Sultanate of Bagirmi and Wadai Empire emerged in the 16th and 17th centuries. The power of Kanem and its successors was based on control of the trans-Saharan trade routes that passed through the region. These states, at least tacitly Muslim, never extended their control to the southern grasslands except to raid for slaves. In Kanem, <b>about</b> <b>a</b> <b>third</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> population were slaves.|$|E
5|$|Ganymede is {{composed}} of approximately equal amounts of silicate rock and water ice. It is a fully differentiated body with an iron-rich, liquid core, and an internal ocean that may contain more water than all of Earth's oceans combined. Its surface {{is composed}} of two main types of terrain. Dark regions, saturated with impact craters and dated to four billion years ago, cover <b>about</b> <b>a</b> <b>third</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> satellite. Lighter regions, crosscut by extensive grooves and ridges and only slightly less ancient, cover the remainder. The cause of the light terrain's disrupted geology is not fully known, but was likely the result of tectonic activity due to tidal heating.|$|E
5|$|Geoffrey Chaucer's Troilus and Criseyde {{reflects}} a more humorous world-view than Boccaccio's poem. Chaucer {{does not have}} his own wounded love to display and therefore allows himself an ironic detachment from events and Criseyde is more sympathetically portrayed. In contrast to Boccaccio's final canto, which returns to the poet's own situation, Chaucer's palinode has Troilus looking down laughing from heaven, finally aware of the meaninglessness of earthly emotions. <b>About</b> <b>a</b> <b>third</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> lines of the Troilus are adapted from the much shorter Il Filostrato, leaving room {{for a more detailed}} and characterised narrative.|$|E
