40|$|Systematic {{investigations}} of sensorimotor control of interceptive actions in naturalistic conditions, such as catching or hitting a ball moving in three-dimensional space, requires precise {{control of the}} projectile flight parameters and of the associated visual stimuli. Such control is challenging when air drag cannot be neglected because the mapping of launch parameters into flight parameters cannot be computed analytically. We designed, calibrated, and experimentally validated an actuated launching apparatus that can control the average spatial position and flight duration of a ball at a given distance from a fixed launch location. The apparatus was constructed by mounting a ball launching machine with <b>adjustable</b> <b>delivery</b> speed on an actuated structure capable of changing the spatial orientation of the launch axis while projecting balls {{through a hole in}} a screen hiding the apparatus. The calibration procedure relied on tracking the balls with a motion capture system and on approximating the mapping of launch parameters into flight parameters by means of polynomials functions. Polynomials were also used to estimate the variability of the flight parameters. The coefficients of these polynomials were obtained using the launch and flight parameters of 660 launches with 65 different initial conditions. The relative accuracy and precision of the apparatus were larger than 98 % for flight times and larger than 96 % for ball heights at a distance of 6 m from the screen. Such novel apparatus, by reliably and automatically controlling desired ball flight characteristics without neglecting air drag, allows for a systematic investigation of naturalistic interceptive tasks...|$|E
5000|$|Neuromodulation aims {{to treat}} disease or injury by {{employing}} medical device technologies that would enhance or suppress {{activity of the}} nervous system with the delivery of pharmaceutical agents, electrical signals, or other forms of energy stimulus to re-establish balance in impaired regions of the brain. Researchers in this field face the challenge of linking advances in understanding neural signals to advancements in technologies delivering and analyzing these signals with increased sensitivity, biocompatibility, and viability in closed loops schemes in the brain such that new treatments and clinical applications can be created to treat those suffering from neural damage of various kinds. Neuromodulator devices can correct nervous system dysfunction related to Parkinson's disease, dystonia, tremor, Tourette's, chronic pain, OCD, severe depression, and eventually epilepsy. Neuromodulation is appealing as treatment for varying defects because it focuses in on treating highly specific regions of the brain only, contrasting that of systemic treatments that can have side effects on the body. Neuromodulator stimulators such as microelectrode arrays can stimulate and record brain function and with further improvements are meant to become <b>adjustable</b> and responsive <b>delivery</b> devices for drugs and other stimuli.|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe aim of {{diabetes}} treatment {{is to achieve}} tight glucose control to avoid the development of chronic diabetic complications while reducing the frequency of hypoglycaemic episodes. Continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) using an external pump is an intensive diabetes therapy recognized to improve metabolic control and glycaemic instability, and to reduce the frequency of severe hypoglycaemia. For years, the theoretical advantages of the insulin pump (constancy of basal <b>delivery,</b> <b>adjustable</b> basal rates, and low insulin depots allowing the reduction of glycaemic variability) have contributed to its reported superiority compared with multiple daily injections (MDI). However, insulin pump therapy is now challenged by new MDI regimens based on long-acting insulin analogues that could replace the use of CSII. As a consequence, health professionals now have to determine which patients are likely to benefit the most from CSII. Recently, several studies reported that children and adolescents, and patients whose blood glucose imbalance was initially the most pronounced with basal-bolus regimens, would particularly benefit from CSII. Other indications were also proposed in marginal clinical situations with highly selected patients in whom a significant improvement of blood glucose was demonstrated. Finally, the use of CSII in type 2 diabetic patients {{now appears to be}} a good alternative to the ineffective MDI regimens observed in some of these patients. However, past experience with CSII indicates that candidates for insulin pump therapy must be carefully selected and strongly motivated to improve their glucose control. Use of CSII also requires strict medical supervision by physicians and a regular programme of patient education by paramedical teams, to ensure optimal responsible use of this technique by healthcare professionals...|$|R
