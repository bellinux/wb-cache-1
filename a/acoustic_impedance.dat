5|$|This {{technology}} {{is widely used}} in confirming venous pathology diagnoses. The imaging capability needed, was made possible with the developments of Doppler and color Doppler. Doppler measurements using Doppler effect can show {{the direction of the}} blood flow and its relative velocity and color Doppler is the provision of color to help interpret the image, showing for example, the blood flow towards the probe in one color and that flowing away another. Whilst the equipment itself is costly, the procedure is not. Apart from the scanner, different probes are required according to the depth to be studied. A gel is used with the probe to make a good <b>acoustic</b> <b>impedance</b> contact. The training and expertise of the examiner is important because of the many technical complications that can present. Venous anatomy for example, is not constant, for example a patient's vein layout of the right limb is not identical to that of the left limb.|$|E
25|$|This {{bypassing}} of {{the middle}} ear also affects the frequency sensitivity of the ear. Sound is also reflected in proportion to the change of density or elasticity (mismatch of <b>acoustic</b> <b>impedance)</b> when passing through an interface, so that enclosing the head in a rigid helmet may cause a significant attenuation of sound originating in the water. Internal sound attenuation material my further reduce noise levels.|$|E
25|$|The head-joint tube is tapered {{slightly}} {{towards the}} closed end. Boehm described {{the shape of}} the taper as parabolic. Examination of his flutes did not reveal a true parabolic curve, but the taper is more complex than a truncated cone. The head joint is the most difficult part to construct because the lip plate and tone hole have critical dimensions, edges, and angles which vary slightly between manufacturers and in individual flutes, especially where they are handmade. Head joint geometry appears particularly critical to acoustic performance and tone, but there is no clear consensus on a particular shape amongst manufacturers. <b>Acoustic</b> <b>impedance</b> of the embouchure hole appears the most critical parameter. Critical variables affecting this <b>acoustic</b> <b>impedance</b> include: chimney length (hole between lip-plate and head tube), chimney diameter, and radiuses or curvature of the ends of the chimney. Generally, the shorter the hole, the more quickly a flute can be played; the longer the hole, the more complex the tone. Finding a particularly good example of a flute is dependent on play-testing. Head joint upgrades are usually suggested as a way to improve the tone of an instrument.|$|E

We give a general expression for the T-matrix of a 1 D Bur tube {{in terms of the}} normal <b>acoustic</b> <b>impedances</b> for the different components of the acoustic wavefield. This shows how the (leaky and non-leaky) eigenmodes are related to those frequencies at which the normal <b>acoustic</b> <b>impedances</b> for the scattered and the transmitted wavefield are equal. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|The Transmission Line Matrix (TLM) is a {{physical}} discretization approach used to solve the wave equation numerically. The method replaces a continuous system by a network or an array of lumped elements. The TLM method involves dividing the solution region into a rectangular mesh of the transmission line segments. The nodes of the mesh are the points of discontinuity for <b>acoustic</b> <b>impedances.</b> A computer program based on transmission-line matrix (TLM) model was developed to simulate the ultrasound propagation media with different <b>acoustic</b> <b>impedances.</b> The numerical model provides both frequency and time domain responses. The influence of variations {{in the shape of}} the incident pulse is discussed. The numerical results are compared with those obtained from experiments...|$|R
25|$|The {{microphone}} {{features a}} high membrane compliance {{with a large}} backchamber volume, a prepolarized backplane and a high impedance preamplifier located inside the backchamber. The windscreen, based on the high transmission coefficient of infrasound through matter, is made of a material having a low <b>acoustic</b> <b>impedance</b> and has a sufficiently thick wall to ensure structural stability. Close-cell polyurethane foam {{has been found to}} serve the purpose well. In the proposed test, test parameters will be sensitivity, background noise, signal fidelity (harmonic distortion), and temporal stability.|$|E
25|$|The {{shielding}} material used – wire gauze, fabric or foam – {{is designed}} {{to have a significant}} <b>acoustic</b> <b>impedance.</b> The relatively low particle-velocity air pressure changes that constitute sound waves can pass through with minimal attenuation, but higher particle-velocity wind is impeded to a far greater extent. Increasing the thickness of the material improves wind attenuation but also begins to compromise high frequency audio content. This limits the practical size of simple foam screens. While foams and wire meshes can be partly or wholly self-supporting, soft fabrics and gauzes require stretching on frames, or laminating with coarser structural elements.|$|E
25|$|An {{acoustic}} horn converts large pressure variations {{with a small}} displacement area into a low pressure variation with a large displacement area and vice versa. It does this through the gradual, often exponential increase of the cross sectional area of the horn. The small cross-sectional area of the throat restricts the passage of air thus presenting a high <b>acoustic</b> <b>impedance</b> to the driver. This allows the driver to develop a high pressure for a given displacement. Therefore the sound waves at the throat are of high pressure and low displacement. The tapered shape of the horn allows the sound waves to gradually decompress and increase in displacement until they reach the mouth where they are of a low pressure but large displacement.|$|E

For pore pressure prediction, 84 CDPs were selected on 14 inline seismic sections and 70 CDPs selected on 14 crosslines.

25|$|Diffraction {{refers to}} various {{phenomena}} that occur when a wave encounters an obstacle or a slit. It {{is defined as}} the bending of light around the corners of an obstacle or aperture into the region of geometrical shadow of the obstacle. In classical physics, the diffraction phenomenon is described as the interference of waves according to the Huygens–Fresnel principle. These characteristic behaviors are exhibited when a wave encounters an obstacle or a slit that is comparable in size to its wavelength. Similar effects occur when a light wave travels through a medium with a varying refractive index, or when a sound wave travels through a medium with varying <b>acoustic</b> <b>impedance.</b> Diffraction occurs with all waves, including sound waves, water waves, and electromagnetic waves such as visible light, X-rays and radio waves.|$|E
25|$|Loudspeaker {{efficiency}} {{is defined as}} the sound power output divided by the electrical power input. Most loudspeakers are inefficient transducers; only about 1% of the electrical energy sent by an amplifier to a typical home loudspeaker is converted to acoustic energy. The remainder is converted to heat, mostly in the voice coil and magnet assembly. The main reason for this is the difficulty of achieving proper impedance matching between the <b>acoustic</b> <b>impedance</b> of the drive unit and the air it radiates into. (At low frequencies, improving this match is the main purpose of speaker enclosure designs). The efficiency of loudspeaker drivers varies with frequency as well. For instance, the output of a woofer driver decreases as the input frequency decreases because of the increasingly poor match between air and the driver.|$|E

The nonuniform portions of the media are confined to layers of either finite or infinite thicknesses. The <b>acoustic</b> <b>impedances</b> of the nonuniform layers as functions of travel time are assumed known. The impulse responses are determined by evaluating the Fourier transforms of their reflection coefficients using infinite series expansions and contour integrations...|$|R
500|$|Ultrasonography {{is based}} on the {{principle}} that sound can pass through human body tissues and is reflected by the tissue interfaces {{in the same way that}} light can reflect back on itself, from a mirror. Tissue in the body will offer varying degrees of resistance, known as <b>acoustic</b> <b>impedance,</b> to the path of the ultrasound beam. When there is a high impedance difference between two tissues, the interface between them will strongly reflect the sound. When the ultrasound beam meets air, or solid tissue such as bone, their [...] impedance difference is so great that most of the acoustic energy is reflected making it impossible to see any underlying structures. The examiner will see just a shadow, instead of the image expected. Air will impede sound waves which is why a gel is used. The gel prevents air bubbles from forming between the probe, and the patient's skin and so helps the conduction of the sound waves from the transducer into the body. The watery medium also helps to conduct the sound waves. Liquids, including blood have a low impedance, which means that little energy will be reflected and no visualization possible. One of the important exceptions is that when the blood flow is very slow it can in fact be seen, in what is termed [...] "spontaneous contrast".|$|E
500|$|Prevention of {{pulmonary}} contusion {{is similar}} to that of other chest trauma. [...] Airbags in combination with seat belts can protect vehicle occupants by preventing the chest from striking the interior of the vehicle during a collision, and by distributing forces involved in the crash more evenly across the body. [...] However, in rare cases, an airbag causes pulmonary contusion in a person who is not properly positioned when it deploys. [...] Child restraints such as carseats protect children in vehicle collisions from pulmonary contusion. Equipment exists for use in some sports to prevent chest and lung injury; for example, in softball the catcher is equipped with a chest protector. [...] Athletes who do not wear such equipment, such as basketball players, can be trained to protect their chests from impacts. Protective garments can also prevent pulmonary contusion in explosions. Although traditional body armor made from rigid plates or other heavy materials protects from projectiles generated by a blast, it does not protect against pulmonary contusion, because it does not prevent the blast's shock wave from being transferred to the lung. [...] Special body armor has been designed for military personnel at high risk for blast injuries; these garments can prevent a shock wave from being propagated across the chest wall to the lung, and thus protect wearers from blast lung injuries. These garments alternate layers of materials with high and low <b>acoustic</b> <b>impedance</b> (the product of a material's density and a wave's velocity through it) in order to [...] "decouple" [...] the blast wave, preventing its propagation into the tissues.|$|E
2500|$|Head joint {{geometry}} appears particularly {{critical to}} acoustic performance and tone, {{but there is}} no clear consensus on a particular shape amongst manufacturers. <b>Acoustic</b> <b>impedance</b> of the embouchure hole appears the most critical parameter. Critical variables affecting this <b>acoustic</b> <b>impedance</b> include: chimney length (hole between lip-plate and head tube), chimney diameter, and radii or curvature of the ends of the chimney and any designed restriction in the [...] "throat" [...] of the instrument, such as that in the Japanese Nohkan Flute.|$|E
50|$|In {{amplifier}} and loudspeaker design electrical impedances, mechanical <b>impedances,</b> and <b>acoustic</b> <b>impedances</b> of {{the system}} have to be balanced such that the frequency and phase response least alter the reproduced sound across a very broad spectrum whilst still producing adequate sound levels for the listener. Modelling acoustical systems using the same (or similar) techniques long used in electrical circuits gave acoustical designers a new and powerful design tool.|$|R
50|$|When a {{seismic wave}} {{encounters}} a boundary between two materials with different <b>acoustic</b> <b>impedances,</b> {{some of the}} energy in the wave will be reflected at the boundary, {{while some of the}} energy will be transmitted through the boundary.

40|$|This paper {{studies the}} diffuse field sound {{absorption}} coefficient of a system consisting of a rigid perforated panel with a thin porous woven/matted material glued to its back, which is {{placed in front of}} an air cavity with a rigid backing. To cut the cost of trial and error diffuse field {{sound absorption coefficient}} measurements, a prediction method was developed. Measurements were made in a two-microphone impedance tube of the complex specific <b>acoustic</b> <b>impedances</b> of the unperforated rigid panel materials and of the thin porous materials in front of a rigidly terminated air cavity. These values were used in the transfer matrix method to predict the complex specific <b>acoustic</b> <b>impedances</b> of the perforated panels systems {{as a function of the}} angle of incidence of the sound. These calculations assumed the systems to have infinite or finite lateral extent. The measured diffuse field sound absorption coefficient values usually lay between the infinite and finite predictions. The most important variables are the perforation factor of the panel, the acoustic resistance of the thin porous material and the cavity depth...|$|R
2500|$|Scale and pitch: The {{standard}} pitch has varied widely over history, {{and this}} has affected how flutes are made. Although the standard concert pitch today is A4=440Hz, many manufacturers optimize the tone hole size/spacings for a higher pitch options such as A4=442Hz or A4=444Hz. (As noted above, adjustments to the pitch of one note, usually the A4 fingering, {{can be made by}} moving the headjoint {{in and out of the}} headjoint tenon, but the point here is that the mechanical relationship of A4 to all other pitches is set when the tone holes are cut. However, small deviations from the objective 'mechanical' pitch (which is related to <b>acoustic</b> <b>impedance</b> of a given fingering) can be made on the fly by embouchure adjustments.) ...|$|E
2500|$|Medical {{ultrasonography}} uses {{high frequency}} broadband sound {{waves in the}} megahertz range that are reflected by tissue to varying degrees to produce (up to 3D) images. This is commonly associated with imaging the fetus in pregnant women. Uses of ultrasound are much broader, however. [...] Other important uses include imaging the abdominal organs, heart, breast, muscles, tendons, arteries and veins. [...] While it may provide less anatomical detail than techniques such as CT or MRI, it has several advantages which make it ideal in numerous situations, in particular that it studies the function of moving structures in real-time, emits no ionizing radiation, and contains speckle {{that can be used}} in elastography. Ultrasound is also used as a popular research tool for capturing raw data, that can be made available through an ultrasound research interface, for the purpose of tissue characterization and implementation of new image processing techniques. The concepts of ultrasound differ from other medical imaging modalities in the fact that it is operated by the transmission and receipt of sound waves. The high frequency sound waves are sent into the tissue and depending on the composition of the different tissues; the signal will be attenuated and returned at separate intervals. [...] A path of reflected sound waves in a multilayered structure can be defined by an input <b>acoustic</b> <b>impedance</b> (ultrasound sound wave) and the Reflection and transmission coefficients of the relative structures. It is very safe to use and does not appear to cause any adverse effects. It is also relatively inexpensive and quick to perform. Ultrasound scanners can be taken to critically ill patients in intensive care units, avoiding the danger caused while moving the patient to the radiology department. The real time moving image obtained can be used to guide drainage and biopsy procedures. Doppler capabilities on modern scanners allow the blood flow in arteries and veins to be assessed.|$|E

40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the existence and}} behavior of localized and resonant acoustic modes of sagittal polarization associated with the interface between a superlattice (SL) and a substrate. These modes appear as well-defined peaks in the density of states, either inside the minigaps or inside the bulk bands of the SL and the substrate. It is shown that the interface modes strongly depend on the <b>acoustic</b> <b>impedances</b> of the substrate. Furthermore, a phonon incident on the superlattice from a substrate is partially reflected in the substrate, therefore the amplitudes and the phases of the reflection coefficients enable us to deduce the frequency ranges of the bulk bands and the minigaps of the superlattice {{as well as the}} frequency levels of the interface resonant modes. The densities of states and reflection coefficients, which are calculated as function of the frequency ω and the wave vector k (parallel to the interfaces), are obtained from an analytical determination of the Green's function for the superlattice/substrate interface.
