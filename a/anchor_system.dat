40|$|A {{limitation}} {{in research}} on bolt anchoring is the unknown relationship between dynamic perturbation and mechanical characteristics. This paper divides dynamic impulse loads into engineering loads and blasting loads and then employs numerical calculation software FLAC 3 D to analyze the stability of an <b>anchoring</b> <b>system</b> perturbed by an impulse load. The evolution of the dynamic response of the axial force/shear stress in the <b>anchoring</b> <b>system</b> is thus obtained. It is revealed that the corners and middle of the <b>anchoring</b> <b>system</b> are strongly affected by the dynamic load, and the dynamic response of shear stress is distinctly stronger {{than that of the}} axial force in the <b>anchoring</b> <b>system.</b> Additionally, the perturbation of the impulse load reduces stress in the anchored rock mass and induces repeated tension and loosening of the rods in the <b>anchoring</b> <b>system,</b> thus reducing the stability of the <b>anchoring</b> <b>system.</b> The oscillation amplitude of the axial force in the anchored segment is mitigated far more than that in the free segment, demonstrating that extended/full-length anchoring is extremely stable and surpasses simple anchors with free ends...|$|R
40|$|A landing {{mechanism}} to an asteroid with soft surface is developed. It {{consists of three}} landing feet, landing legs, cardan element, damping element, equipment base, <b>anchoring</b> <b>system,</b> and so on. Static structural analysis and modal analysis are carried out to check the strength and natural frequency of the landing mechanism with FEA. Testing platform for the <b>anchoring</b> <b>system</b> is introduced, and then the penetrating and anchoring tests of the <b>anchoring</b> <b>system</b> are carried out in different media. It shows that cohesion of the media has large influence on the penetrating and anchoring performance of the <b>anchoring</b> <b>system.</b> Landing tests of the landing mechanism with different velocities under simulated microgravity environment are carried out on the air-floating platform, and the impact accelerations are measured by the sensors on the landing mechanism. At the same time, these impact accelerations are processed by spectrum analysis to find the natural frequency of the landing mechanism...|$|R

40|$|Background: Bone <b>anchoring</b> <b>systems</b> {{are used}} {{extensively}} in orthopaedic surgery but have scarcely been reported as useful in abdominal wall or perineal hernia repair. After coccygectomy or sacrectomy {{the development of}} bowel herniation is not uncommon. Considering repair of such a perineal hernia, adequate fixation of the prosthetic mesh is difficult and, therefore, recurrence is rather frequent, mostly due to insufficient anchoring of the mesh to the bony structures. Methods: We discuss a patient in which the Mitek GII <b>anchoring</b> <b>system</b> was used to overcome the problem of soft-tissue-to-bone attachment in such cases. Conclusion: Bone <b>anchoring</b> <b>systems</b> {{seem to be an}} efficient method to overcome the problems of soft-tissue-to bone attachment in both abdominal and perineal hernia repair...|$|R

40|$|A {{technique}} is {{developed for the}} analysis of multiple underream <b>anchor</b> <b>systems</b> resting in an elastic soil. This technique may be used to consider <b>anchor</b> <b>systems</b> involving arbitrary <b>anchor</b> inclination and depth beneath the soil surface, as well as arbitrary number, shape, size and spacing of underreams. The approach is largely analytical in nature and involves {{only a fraction of the}} computation required for a finite element analysis. Consideration is given to the effects of anchor depth and inclination to the soil surface, and the spacing and number of underreams upon the elastic response of <b>anchor</b> <b>systems.</b> On the basis of the results from this study, a simple, approximate method for estimating the response of multiple underream anchors is proposed. This approach involves the use of several interaction charts, which are presented in the paper, and can be used as a hand method for estimating the load-displacement behaviour of quite general <b>anchor</b> <b>systems</b> to sufficient accuracy for most practical purposes. The use of the approximate approach is illustrated by an example. 1...|$|R

5000|$|Top rope {{climbing}} (or top roping) is a {{style in}} climbing {{in which the}} climber is securely attached to a rope which then passes up, through an <b>anchor</b> <b>system</b> {{at the top of}} the climb, and down to a belayer at the foot of the climb.

50|$|A {{box caisson}} is a {{prefabricated}} concrete box (it has sides and a bottom); {{it is set}} down on prepared bases. Once in place, {{it is filled with}} concrete {{to become part of the}} permanent works, such as the foundation for a bridge pier. Hollow concrete structures are usually less dense than water so a box caisson must be ballasted or anchored to keep it from floating until it can be filled with concrete. Sometimes elaborate <b>anchoring</b> <b>systems</b> may be required, such as in tidal zones. Adjustable <b>anchoring</b> <b>systems</b> combined with a GPS survey enable engineers to position a box caisson with pinpoint accuracy.|$|R

50|$|It is {{normally}} essential to include energy (or shock) absorbers within HLL {{in addition to}} those within the workers' PPE. Without such absorbers, the horizontal life line cannot deform significantly when arresting the fall. Because of the geometry of pulling across the horizontal line, this in turn results in large resolved forces being generated within the <b>anchor</b> <b>system,</b> sufficient to cause failure of the anchorage. This can occur even with energy absorbers being included in the PPE of the worker.|$|E

50|$|The sum {{of forces}} {{on all the}} {{individual}} anchors will commonly exceed 100%, and in some cases, the force on an individual anchor will be greater than the load. This may seem contradictory when only the magnitudes are summed. However, if the forces on the individual anchors are added as vectors, the resultant force on the <b>anchor</b> <b>system</b> {{is equal to the}} load. In simpler terms, the forces in the vertical direction are equal to the load force, but there are lateral forces as well - which increase as the V-angle increases.|$|E
40|$|Composite {{materials}} {{can be used}} to upgrade the load-carrying capacities of unreinforced masonry walls. The strength of the upgraded wall, however, is often limited by failure that occurs near the bottom of a wall due to a low capacity for load transfer between the wall and the foundation. The present paper provides information on an experimental investigation of a composite <b>anchoring</b> <b>system</b> on unreinforced concrete masonry walls. This system provides high-capacity load transfer between the fiber reinforced polymer (FRP) laminate retrofitted wall and the foundation. Six masonry wall-concrete footing assemblages were built, strengthened with FRP laminates, and tested. On all walls, a composite <b>anchoring</b> <b>system</b> provided the only connection between concrete foundation and masonry wall. Three walls (1219 mm x 1219 mm) had composite laminate applied in edge strips to both faces and were subjected to in-plane shear and a 22. 24 kN axial load. The capacity of these walls reached more than 120 kN (lateral load) before failure, which resulted from extensive cracking of the masonry units. The other three walls (406 mm x 1016 mm) had the tension surface fully covered with CFRP laminate and were tested in tension (bending) reaching a maximum load of 32 kN before failing due to masonry unit crushing. In each loading case, the <b>anchoring</b> <b>system</b> provided sufficient strength allowing the masonry units to fail before the CFRP laminate or composite anchors failed. The results of this research reveal that strength gains due to FRP laminate upgrades on unreinforced concrete masonry walls can be fully realized {{through the use of a}} composite <b>anchoring</b> <b>system.</b> ...|$|R

5000|$|In 2000, another American scientist, Bradley C. Edwards, {{suggested}} {{creating a}} 100,000 km long paper-thin ribbon using a carbon nanotube composite material. [...] He chose the wide-thin ribbon-like cross-section shape rather than earlier circular cross-section concepts because that shape would stand {{a greater chance}} of surviving impacts by meteoroids. The ribbon cross-section shape also provided large surface area for climbers to climb with simple rollers. Supported by the NASA Institute for Advanced Concepts, Edwards' work was expanded to cover the deployment scenario, climber design, power delivery system, orbital debris avoidance, <b>anchor</b> <b>system,</b> surviving atomic oxygen, avoiding lightning and hurricanes by locating the anchor in the western equatorial Pacific, construction costs, construction schedule, and environmental hazards.|$|E
50|$|If {{the route}} being climbed is a multi-pitch route the leader {{sets up a}} secure <b>anchor</b> <b>system</b> {{at the top of}} the pitch, also called a belay, from where they can belay as their partner climbs. As the second climber climbs, they remove the gear from the rock in case of {{traditional}} climbing or remove the quickdraws from the bolts in the case of sport climbing. Both climbers are now {{at the top of the}} pitch with all their equipment. Note that the second climber is protected from above while climbing, but the lead climber is not, so being the lead climber is more challenging and dangerous. After completing the climb, and with both climbers at the top of the pitch, both climbers must rappel or descend the climb in order to return to their starting point, or top out and walk off. All climbs do not necessarily require the lead climber to belay the second climber from the top. The belayer could lower the lead climber down after they have completed a single pitch route.|$|E
50|$|When {{selecting}} a rope for heavy top roping use, a large diameter (>= 10mm) static rope (or low-stretch rope) {{is recommended for}} the anchors to prevent rope wear and reduce rock erosion and to ensure maximum safety {{in the event of}} a fall. A dynamic rope should be used for the climbers. It is important to arrange the <b>anchor</b> <b>system</b> such that the climbing rope touches the rock as little as possible; damage to or destruction of the rope can result if a rope is loaded or dragged across sharp rocks enough times or with enough force. For anchors which are set back from the cliff edge, extending the anchor using multiple slings, a long adjustable-length sling, or a length of static line is common. Most practitioners run the climbing rope through two screwgate carabiners attached to the anchor, to provide backup in case one becomes undone. In the interests of safety at least two separate and redundant anchor points should be used, with forces distributed as evenly between them as possible. In the photo above, it can be seen that only the two locking carabiners protrude over the cliff edge, allowing the climbing rope a relatively free run from belayer to climber.|$|E
