Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) was used to confirm the existence of grafted monomers. The absorption bands characteristic of each monomer grafted were observed in the FTIR spectrum of the modified EPR and were taken as evidence of grafting. The percentage of grafting attained was also followed by FTIR analysis, where the amount of monomer incorporated in EPR was estimated from a calibration curve established for the monomers used in this work. The degree of grafting obtained was 1. 1 % by weight of EPR for itaconic acid, 1. 2 % for monomethyl itaconate and 2. 5 % for dimethyl itaconate.

The increase of not-extracted EPM with the increasing quantity of OMMT suggested strong interactions of the polymer chains with the inorganic substrate.

The dielectric relaxation analysis confirmed the evidence of strong interactions among montmorillonite and the polar diethylsuccinate groups for the macromolecules trapped due to the presence of the inorganic layers.

40|$|International audienceIn this article, {{ethylene-propylene}} copolymer/lamellar graphite nanocomposites were processed {{to be used}} in rotational molding. The {{addition of}} graphite aims at increasing the thermal conductivity of polyolefin and reducing processing cycle time. This article describes the different ways to get a well-controlled dispersion of fillers in the matrix. For that, the control of the filler/matrix interactions is necessary. Graphite was treated with a concentrated nitric acid and sulfuric acid solution to lead to a graphite intercalation compound (GIC). By heating at high temperature, expanded lamellar graphite is so obtained. As the graphite surface energy is higher than polyolefin matrix one, the initial graphite and expanded graphite were treated with stearic acid, commonly used in the case of calcium carbonate, in order to match the surface energy of the hydrophobic matrix.

40|$|Oxidation of bis[2, 2, 6, 6 ‐tetramethyl‐ 4 ‐piperidinyl] sebacate (HALS) to itroxy {{radicals}} {{has been}} monitored by ESR spectroscopy in three polymers: <b>an</b> <b>ethylene‐propylene</b> random <b>copolymer</b> (EPM), <b>a</b> styrene‐butadiene‐styrene block copolymer (SBS) {{and the same}} block copolymer previously hydroperoxidized by reaction with singlet oxygen. Nitroxy radicals are produced in all three polymers on irradiation {{in the presence of}} oxygen and, in the last one also in the dark, at room temperature. The mechanism of the reaction is discussed: it involves direct interaction of a peroxy radical with the piperidine nitrogen. The role of clustered hydroperoxides as a source of peroxy radicals is emphasized. Inhibition of the photo‐oxidation of all three polymers by HALS has been studied by oxygen absorption measurements and by infra‐red spectroscopy in the carbonyl region. The results indicate that HALS not only inhibits the propagation of the photo‐oxidation but also catalyses a new type of termination that, in some polymers, delays the production of ketones. It is suggested that the practical efficiency of HALS in keeping the mechanical properties of polyolefins exposed to sunlight is mainly due to that last effect.

The PP/EPR blends morphology, with very small domains of EPR dispersed in the PP matrix, indicates a good compatibility among these materials, {{which leads to a}} significant improvement on elongation at break and impact strength. The incorporation of EPR on the rubber phase of thermoplastic elastomeric blends (TPE) based on GTR and PP (TPEGTR) has a positive effect on their mechanical performance, attributed to the toughness enhancement of the PP matrix and to the establishment of shell-core morphology between the rubber phases. The mechanical properties of the ternary blends reveal that TPEGTR blends allow the upcycling of this GTR material by injection molding technologies. (c) 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J. Appl. Polym.

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. A diblock copolymer of Poly (Styrene-b- [ethylene-co-propylene]) {{has been used as}} a stabilizer in non-aqueous dispersion polymerizations of methyl methacrylate and vinyl acetate in n-heptane. The particles thus produced were stabilized by well defined surface layers of <b>ethylene-propylene</b> <b>copolymer</b> chains. The dependence of the particle size on the stabilizer, monomer and initiator concentrations was studied. Both seeded and one-shot polymerization techniques were investigated. Polymer particles were characterized by transmission electron microscopy to determine particle shape and size. The long term stability of both types of polymer particles suggests that the anchoring efficiency in both systems was good. Rheological studies confirmed the sphericity of the particles and showed the particles to be non-flocculated under shear. The thickness of the surface layer was determined from viscosity studies of the dispersions at 298, 308 and 318 K. Solution viscosities dispersions at of a narrow distribution standard of <b>ethylene-propylene</b> <b>copolymer</b> in n-heptane and in a binary liquid mixture of n-heptane and n-propanol (79 : 21, v/v) at 298, 308 and 318 K were obtained in order to estimate the root-mean-square end-to-end distance of free <b>ethylene-propylene</b> <b>copolymer</b> chains. The thickness of the surface layer was observed to increase on raising the temperature and to decrease on changing the solvency of the dispersion medium from a good solvent to almost a theta solvent for the <b>ethylene-propylene</b> <b>copolymer</b> chains. The dimensions of the surface layer were slightly larger than the dimensions of the free <b>ethylene-propylene</b> <b>copolymer</b> chains in solution suggesting that long ethylene-propylene chains terminally anchored at the interface are only slightly extended over random coil dimensions. Calculations of the mean separation distance between adjacent stabilizing <b>ethylene-propylene</b> <b>copolymer</b> chains indicated close-packing of <b>ethylene-propylene</b> <b>copolymer</b> chains at the particle-liquid interface which may contribute to the slight extension of the <b>ethylene-propylene</b> <b>copolymer</b> chain conformation. The theta-conditions for <b>ethylene-propylene</b> <b>copolymer</b> in <b>a</b> mixture of n-heptane and n-propanol were determined using samples obtained by hydrogenating polyisoprene standards. The solvency of the dispersion medium for the stabilizing <b>ethylene-propylene</b> <b>copolymer</b> chain on the polymer particles was reduced until flocculation occurred, and this was achieved by cooling the dispersion system to find the critical flocculation temperature or by adding a non-solvent (n-propanol) for the <b>ethylene-propylene</b> <b>copolymer</b> chains at constant temperature to find the critical flocculation volume. The polymer dispersions just retained stability at theta conditions and started to lose stability when the dispersion medium was changed to slightly worse than a theta system for the ethylene-propylene chains. The close correspondence of the flocculation conditions to the theta conditions for free <b>ethylene-propylene</b> <b>copolymer</b> chains confirms that the steric stabilization mechanism is operative for these dispersions...|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} the notch {{sharpening}} procedure on the fracture toughness computed under linear-elastic and elastic-plastic conditions (at low and high loading rates, respectively) of <b>a</b> bulk <b>ethylene–propylene</b> block <b>copolymer</b> has been investigated.

The crack growth initiation parameter, JIC, determined {{with the help of}} the elastic-plastic fracture approach, and the fracture toughness, KIC, obtained with specimens verifying linear-elastic fracture mechanics assumptions, of the steel razor blade sharpened samples were higher than that of the femtolaser sharpened specimens. The plastic deformation occurring ahead of the crack tip during the sharpening method seems to be the reason for the dissimilarity of the fracture values. Moreover, the strain hardening suffered by the material close to the notch tip reduces the stable crack growth resistance evaluated under elastic-plastic conditions.

40|$|The {{influence}} of electron beam (EB) irradiation {{on the impact}} properties of compatibilized polystyrene/ethylene-propylene-diene-monomer (PSIEPDM) blends was studied. The change in impact value upon irradiation proved to be strongly dependent {{on the type of}} compatibilizer used. Using a polystyrene/polybutadiene (SB) diblock copolymer as a compatibilizer, a twofold increase in Izod value could be achieved upon irradiation. Irradiation of a blend using <b>a</b> polystyrenel <b>ethylene-propylene</b> (SEP) <b>copolymer</b> as <b>a</b> compatibilizer resulted in a decrease in impact strength. These observations can be related to aradiation induced increase in interfacial adhesion in case of the SB copolymer, which does not occur for the SEP copolymer. Due to the abundance of double bonds in the SB copolymer, this copolymer reacts very fast upon irradiation and may co-crosslink with, or graft onto the EPDM phase. For the SEP copolymer erosslinking occurs only at much higher doses and is (partly) overruled by chain scission and consequently the adhesion between matrix and dispersed phase will hardly change.

40|$|The microphase {{structure}} of ionomers based on <b>an</b> amorphous, maleated <b>ethylene-propylene</b> <b>copolymer</b> was investigated by using small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) and solid-state NMR experiments. It was shown {{that in this}} kind of ionomers grafted maleic anhydride, its salts with Zn 2 + and a fraction of EPM chain fragments form immobilized, ion-rich aggregates. Three types of EPM chain units with different mobility were detected in the ionomers and in the ionomer precursor, which can be attributed to chain units with low mobility forming aggregates surrounded by an interfacial layer, EPM network chains interconnecting these aggregates, and network imperfections such as dangling ends and chain loops. When the the degree of neutralization is increased, the average dimension of the immobilized aggregate remains almost constant, while the thickness of the interfacial layer with restricted mobility slightly increases. The size of the aggregates in MAn-g-EPM ionomers is significantly larger compared to other ionomers, and as a consequence, the number of acid groups within an aggregate is also larger. At 50 % neutralization, the number of aggregates suddenly decreases. The changes in some macroscopic properties, such as compression set and tensile properties, are related to the morphology of the ionomers as determined by SAXS and NMR. When the degree of neutralization is increased, the properties of the materials change due to strengthening of the ionic aggregates...|$|R

Heterophasic {{propylene copolymers}} consist of two main components: a polymer matrix of isotactic polypropylene and <b>a</b> dispersed rubbery <b>ethylene-propylene</b> <b>copolymer,</b> which is not miscible into the matrix phase. While the matrix improves stiffness, the elastomeric phase enhances the impact strength and the mechanical behavior at low temperature. Heterophasic propylene copolymers are produced in -at-least- two stage processes. In the first stage, starting from the catalyst particle, the homopolymer matrix is build, in the second stage, ethylene-propylene-rubber is polymerized into the polymer particle. The morphology of hiPP particles is of great interest {{for a number of}} reasons since the quantity of EPR, as well as the size and distribution of the rubber domains within the particles will have a great influence on the final properties of the polymer. Since the rubber formed in the second stage is sticky, rubber formation on the outer surface of the particle might lead to particle agglomeration and subsequent operational problems. Providing sufficient porosity for rubber accommodation in the heco-stage is one key element for avoiding these operational issues. Furthermore, particle morphology influences heat- and mass transfer within the polymer particles and therefore has an impact on reaction conditions at the active sites of the catalyst. The current contribution deals with the the effect of reaction conditions, in particular prepolymerization conditions, on resulting particle morphology and how the matrix particle morphology influences rubber incorporation in the heco-stage. Matrix polymerization in both bulk and gas-phase polymerization followed by a gas-phase polymerization of the rubber are discussed for two different Ziegler-Natta catalysts.

In chapter 1, an overview is provided on the polyhomologation reaction. The reaction builds linear sp 3 carbon chains one carbon {{at a time}} using an organoborane catalyst. The traditional method is a living polymerization using sulfoxonium ylides under anhydrous conditions. The newly developed aqueous method is a polymerization of sulfoxonium salts in an aqueous base. Chapter 2 develops the synthesis of telechelic polymers including ω-hydroxyacid esters, α,ω-diols and α,ω-diacids using the aqueous polyhomologation reaction with control of chain length and PDI. These polymers were used as macromonomers to produce long-chain aliphatic polyesters. The obtained polyesters have thermal and mechanical properties indistinguishable compared to related materials derived from biomass. Chapter 3 reports the synthesis of <b>a</b> gradient ersatz <b>ethylene–propylene</b> <b>copolymer</b> using the traditional polyhomologation reaction. A new and convenient source of the ethylide monomer was developed for the introduction of methyl branch on the polymer backbone. The gradient copolymer contains a gradual change of methyl branch content along the polymer chain. Chapter 4 focuses on the precise monomer insertion on a carbon chain using a sulfonium benzylide. The polymerization and validation protocols were established to demonstrate the precise insertion. A thermally more stable benzylide needs to be developed to complete this study. In chapter 5, three 9 -borafluorene derivatives are designed and evaluated {{in search of a}} single-site catalyst for the polyhomologation reaction. The catalyst is being developed for the synthesis of the yet unknown polyethylidene. Computational studies indicated a preferred 1, 2 -migration of the sp 3 over sp 2 carbon when an electron-withdrawing group is installed on the aromatic rings at the ortho position to boron. Experimental studies revealed the presence of competing sp 2 carbon migration due to the required high reaction temperature from the high activation energy of 1, 2 -migration. A side reaction produced ethylidene–methylidene copolymers rather than polyethylidene due to the competing decomposition of ethylide.

For a given rubber the same set of parameters fitted the data in simple tension, simple compression, equal biaxial tension and pure shear up to the point of rupture. The compressible form of the strain energy function also described the thermoelastic data on natural rubber. The thermoelastic data on chlorinated <b>ethylene-propylene</b> <b>copolymer</b> rubber, taken out of the literature, were also predicted. From the new strain energy function it was possible to determine the interchain interactions. For natural rubber the interchain energy effects were found to be small (4 %) as compared to the intrachain energy effects. The experimental results on natural rubber established the range of validity of the statistical mechanical (molecular) and the continuum mechanical (phenomenological) theories. The temperature coefficient of the unperturbed dimensions of natural rubber determined from the internal energy component of the force yielded the conformational energies associated with the cis-polyisoprene chain...|$|R
40|$|Liquid {{chromatography}} at critical conditions (LCCC) of poly(propylene) (PP) holds unique {{potential to}} further augment {{the understanding of}} molecular heterogeneities present in PP. The critical conditions for isotactic poly(propylene) (iPP) and syndiotactic poly(propylene) (sPP) have been identified using porous graphitic carbon as stationary phase and combinations of adsorption and desorption promoting solvents. It is found that 1, 2, 4 -trichlorobenzene is a stronger desorption promoting eluent compared to 1, 2 -dichlorobenzene, while 2 -octanol shows a weaker adsorption promoting effect compared to 2 -ethyl- 1 -hexanol for all stereo-isomeric forms of PP. The fraction of desorption promoting solvent needs to reach critical conditions decreased in a linear manner with the temperature. High temperature 2 D liquid chromatography with infrared detection provides quantitative information about the fractions of the constituents (iPP and <b>ethylene–propylene</b> <b>copolymer)</b> of <b>a</b> model high impact PP sample at LCCC of iPP...|$|R
40|$|The {{target of}} the present study was to {{investigate}} the structure-property relationships of heterophasic ethylenepropylene (EP) copolymers based on a single-site (metallocene) catalyst (SSC) supported with an emulsion technology developed by Borealis. The structure of these copolymers, their morphology evolution, as well as resulting mechanical properties were studied by varying the composition of the dispersed phase, i. e. the amorphous <b>ethylene-propylene</b> <b>copolymer</b> or rubber (EPR), in a systematic series of bench-scale products. Next to composition effects, an attempt was made to understand the key differences between products based on Ziegler-Natta catalysts (ZNC) and single-site catalysts (SSC) in terms of polymer structure and property profile. A remarkably different phase morphology with very good phase coupling to the matrix PP and the absence of crystallizable polyethylene in the ethylene-rich copolymers (EPR) was observed for the SSCbased grades, resulting in a high level of impact strength over a wide composition range...|$|R
