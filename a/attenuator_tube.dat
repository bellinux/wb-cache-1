40|$|We have {{recently}} reported that transcription factor 8 (TCF 8) negatively regulates pathological angiogenesis by regulating endothelial invasiveness by {{acting as a}} transcriptional attenuator of matrix metalloproteinase 1. TCF 8 also modulates cell–matrix and cell–cell adhesion; however molecular mechanism of this TCF 8 function remains obscure. Here, we provide evidence that TCF 8 activates R-Ras, another class of angiogenic regulator, to suppress angiogenesis by a mechanism other than a transcriptional <b>attenuator.</b> <b>Tube</b> formation by human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) facilitated by TCF 8 suppression was significantly inhibited by the expression of onstitutive active mutant of R-Ras. When we examined the mRNA expression levels of R-Ras regulators, no significant changes were observed to explain the R-Ras activation by TCF 8. Interestingly, we found that TCF 8 bound to CalDAG-GEFIII, an R-Ras activator, in the cytosol, indicating that TCF 8 emanates signaling for R-Ras activation from cytosol to regulate angiogenesis negatively...|$|E

40|$|Since 1980 about 180 impact <b>attenuators</b> with crumpling <b>tubes</b> (RIMOB) are {{constructed}} in the Netherlands. The basic concept is a configuration of tubes which get crumpled on impact. It {{is very easy to}} replace damaged parts, which makes maintenance relatively cheap. The RIMOB is meant for the protection of e. g. gantry posts on motorway exits and piers of viaducts. In this report an inventory is made of a number of necessary data for an evaluation of the use and efficiency of the RIMOB. See also B 23840, 22615 and 30716...|$|R
40|$|Gas {{pulsation}} produces excessive {{noise in}} the piping system of the reciprocating compressor and even causes damage in the piping and the machine. Therefore, {{it is very important}} for reasonable analysis and proper control of pressure pulsation. The perforated <b>tube</b> <b>attenuator</b> is widely applied in the compressor because of its favourable performance of acoustic attenuation. For the attenuator design, pressure loss and transmission loss are the two equally significant parameters characterizing its performance. Even if an attenuator can greatly reduce the compressor pressure pulsation, but cause large pressure loss, it will not be used yet. So it’s necessary to pursue the attenuator with low pressure loss as well as low pressure pulsation. The traditional method of calculating pressure loss of the attenuator is according to empirical formulas, which only fit for simple structures. But for the perforated <b>tube</b> <b>attenuator,</b> the flow is complex, and the empirical formulas are not available to calculate the pressure loss. Presently, CFD method is used to calculate pressure loss of the attenuator with complex structure. Most perforated attenuators could consist of hundreds of small holes distributed on the pipe, so three-dimensional flow models ensure the accurate solution. This paper predicts pressure loss of the perforated <b>tube</b> <b>attenuator</b> with various geometry parameters using CFD. A three-dimensional CFD model of the attenuator was established under the following assumptions: (1) The physical parameters of the solid and fluid domain of the attenuator are constant; (2) The flow is steady turbulent flow; (3) The influence of the gravity is ignored; (4) The inlet velocity of the attenuator is homogeneous without impulse effect. The standard - model is used in this paper. The flow through the attenuator follows the law of conservation of mass, law of conservation of momentum and the law of conservation of energy. The solution of the model was implemented with the FVM method of the commercial CFD code fluent. According to the CFD model, the following three aspects were analyzed: (1) The influence of the hole diameter on the pressure loss (2) The influence of porosities on the pressure loss (3) The influence of the inlet velocity on the pressure loss Based on analysis of the above three aspects, an attenuator with low pressure loss as well as low pressure pulsation was designed...|$|R
40|$|In {{an earlier}} report the {{development}} and tests of the RIMOB (an impact <b>attenuator</b> with crumpling <b>tubes)</b> were described. See B 22165 (IRRD 269921). In this report the mathematical models are described which can determine the energy absorption capacity and {{the stability of the}} RIMOB. The models are only developed for frontal collisions of the RIMOB. Two mathematical models are developed. One model for the determination of the energy absorption capacity of the RIMOB, is based on frontal, central collisions and the other model is based on oblique angle collision on the nose of the RIMOB. The models are based on the energy balance: the kinetic energy of the colliding vehicle is fully absorbed by the RIMOB. The models are very pragmatic...|$|R
40|$|Three {{types of}} {{hydraulic}} attenuators are designed and investigated {{to study the}} pulsation-reduction characteristics in hydraulic system. Attenuator test rig is established to obtain pressure signals in time domain and frequency domain (5 Hz to 1200 Hz), respectively. Influences of changing source impedance and loading impedance to the attenuation rate (Ka) and pressure ratio of inlet and outlet (Pio) are discussed. Experiment results show that expansion chamber attenuator (ECA) is a better choice for a wide frequency range of pulsation reduction. Two types of perforated <b>tube</b> <b>attenuators</b> (PTA) have better performances in some certain frequency range. The performance of PTA can have further improvements by designing the damping holes diameters. The performance of the attenuator is mainly influenced by pump character and rotating speed. The system loading has limited influence on the performance comparing to source impedance...|$|R

5000|$|The {{simplest}} guitar amplifiers, such as some vintage amps {{and modern}} practice amps, {{have only a}} single volume control. Most have two volume controls: a first volume control called [...] "preamplifier" [...] or [...] "gain" [...] and a master volume control. The preamp or gain control is designed differently on different types of guitar amps. On an amp designed for an acoustic guitar, turning up the preamp knob will preamplify the signal, but even at its maximum setting, the preamp control is unlikely to produce much overdrive. However, with amps designed for electric guitarists playing electric blues, hard rock and heavy metal music, turning up the preamp or gain knob will usually produce overdrive or distortion. Some electric guitar amps have three controls in the volume section: preamplifier, distortion and master control. Turning up the preamp and distortion knobs in varying combinations can create a range of overdrive tones, from a gentle, warm growling overdrive suitable for a traditional blues show or a rockabilly band to the extreme distortion used in hardcore punk and death metal. On some electric guitar amps, the [...] "gain" [...] knob {{is equivalent to the}} distortion control on a distortion pedal, and similarly may have a side-effect of changing the proportion of bass and treble sent to the next stage.A simple, inexpensive amplifier may have only two tone controls, a passive bass and treble control.
