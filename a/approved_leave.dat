In all cases, the Residency Program Director, in discussion with the returning resident, should determine the training level to which the resident will return following the leave of absence and the necessary educational experiences required for the resident to attain the goals and objectives of the training program. A waiver of training should be considered an uncommon request for an exceptional resident following an <b>approved</b> <b>leave</b> of absence.

40|$|Aim: Utilizing the {{information}} that Gothenburg University (GU) has about the cohort of students in compulsory school TE programmes that started their studies in autumn 2011, this current research aims to explore the possible emerging patterns regarding students’ decision to depart from their studies. Theory: As a data-driven research, the theoretical basis of this study lies on grounded theory (Glaser & Strauss, 2008) aiming to describe the phenomenon of student departure through {{the information}} that students have given to GU regarding their decision to leave. Method: The research followed the true cohort of 190 students in compulsory school TE programmes longitudinally during the timeframe of autumn 2011 –autumn 2015. The data analysis comprised descriptive statistics for providing {{an overview of the}} scope of different forms of departure behaviour and Spearman’s rank-order correlation for exploring possible associations between those forms. Additionally, an inductive thematic analysis combined with descriptive statistics was conducted on the reasons students reported for leaving their studies. Results: The results show the rate of official non-completion of studies for the total sample to be 28. 4 %, whereas between the TE programmes, it varied from 22. 2 % for 0 - 3 rd, to 30. 8 % for 4 - 6 th, and 31. 0 % for 7 - 9 th grade teachers. More women left their studies than men in all programmes and the most common timeframe for leaving was during first and third semester. 21. 1 % of the students were granted an <b>approved</b> <b>leave</b> from studies, with the distribution varying from 14. 1 % for 4 - 6 th, to 24. 1 % for 0 - 3 rd and 27. 6 % for 7 - 9 th grade teachers. The most popular time to take a study break was during third and fifth semester; the most common duration of the break was two semesters. Moreover, results indicate that 44. 4 % of students who officially left from their TE programme, continued studies in the same university, whereas 55. 6 % did not. Most of the students that transferred inside GU remained in TE with an altered focus concerning the school level and/or the combination of subjects they would be teaching. The reasons students reported for departing tended to mirror a perceived mismatch between their expectations and the reality of the chosen education path, criticism towards the arrangement of TE, re-organisation of study path as well as personal and work-related issues. Lastly, this thesis directs attention to the phenomenon of the so-called ‘grey zone’ students and the effectiveness of the current application form for a non-completion of studies. Thesis ends with practical suggestions to GU for making the data collection regarding different forms of student departure behaviours more effective...|$|E

5000|$|Writer Manfred Petzold {{submitted}} his {{script to}} DEFA on 19 July 1958, {{under the title}} Celestial Wink. Beside of complying with the ideological demands of the time, by portraying the collectivization of farms in a positive manner - Joshua Feinstein cited the picture among DEFA's [...] "mission films", that had unambiguous political aims - it also took a highly critical position of the Catholic Church. The village priest, Melchior, was depicted as the main antagonist, who fiercely opposed the notion that his flock would join the communal farm, fearing that he would lose influence. The DEFA Board resisted {{this aspect of the}} plot, being concerned that it would offend Christian farmers and hinder the efforts to have them join the LPG's. The Film Production Commission recommended to make the priest less reactionary. But the figure of Melcior was only slightly more simpathetic in the script's new version, submitted on 11 June 1959 and subsequently approved. Principal photography took place from 17 June until 14 August of that year. A special screening was held for Hans Seidowsky, an official of the Department for Church and State Relations. He concluded that the plot must be significantly altered to avoid having the conflict between the values of Christianity and communism as the main subject of the film. On 30 March 1960, a final edition of the script was <b>approved,</b> <b>leaving</b> the priest with little impact on the events. An intensive process of editing removed all the problematic scenes. In one part of the film, where it was impossible to cut out a sequence in which old Grandma Kalhow had a vision of the Holy Virgin riding on a white cow, strong background noise was added to make her words inaudible. The title Celestial Wink was changed to No Trouble with Cleopatra, to dissasuade any connotation to religious issues.|$|R

Beginning in 2005, plans were made to extend I-195 west from its present-day western terminus along I-295 and I-95, continuing counterclockwise to the north, west and south around Trenton to the new interchange. I-295 would have been truncated to the current interchange with I-195. Officials from New Jersey and Pennsylvania had agreed to submit the I-195 request to American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials, as no route designation is official until approved by them. Had it been approved, approximately [...] would have been added to I-195. Interchange renumbering would have also taken place in concert with the future I-195 designation in Pennsylvania and both the planned and current I-195 designation in New Jersey. This proposal had received conditional approval from AASHTO.

Lane and Parker, for instance, <b>approved</b> industry <b>leaves</b> that allowed instructors to take {{a leave of absence}} from their instructor role {{to go back to work}} in the field for a limited time. Other chairs allowed instructors to work in the profession on a part time or casual basis (Corey, health sciences; and Connor, business). Because of their heavy teaching load, Blake and Drew indicated that industry connections mostly happen through attending industry events, such as conferences, or in specific training sessions put on by manufacturers of new technologies that have become part of the curriculum. In the social services department, there is an expectation that instructors engage in service, both within the institute as well as in their profession. Sam explained that this means that instructors are expected to “be involved with the professional association, … be on educational committees for people in the field …” Since accommodating instructors’ connections with the field is at the discretion of the chair, the chairs in our study enacted leadership of learning by valuing, encouraging, and accommodating instructor employment or service in the field.|$|R
