30|$|The <b>aging</b> <b>management</b> {{of nuclear}} power plant {{includes}} the following: (a) selecting safety systems, structures, and components; (b) understanding the aging process and identifying aging mechanisms; and (c) preventing and delaying the <b>aging</b> process. <b>Aging</b> <b>management</b> for digital control systems {{of nuclear power}} plants ensures that the systems are operating in an adequate safety margin throughout their life cycles (Simola 1999). IAEA NS-G- 2.12 (2009) provides guidance for the <b>aging</b> <b>management</b> of nuclear power plants, {{as well as a}} reference for the <b>aging</b> <b>management</b> of critical systems, structures, and components.

Software <b>aging</b> <b>management</b> is crucial because software is the core difference between digital and analog systems.

50|$|Fennell {{created the}} Four Phase Model as a {{framework}} to help clinicians comprehend and manage {{the integration of the}} experiences of patients with chronic illnesses. The four phases are crisis, stabilization, resolution, and integration. She explains that her model allows for therapeutic intervention in a flexible phase-specific manner so that individuals may integrate their illness into a meaningful life despite physical limitations. An integrated systems approach is uilized to include all aspects of an individual’s chronic illness; physical/behavioral, psychological, and social/interactive. The model recognizes a patient’s needs early in chronic illness may differ from the needs in later years, and may affect various responses to treatment, be it medical or psychosocial. Study results suggest that Fennell's model accurately describes the phases of illness adaptation that persons with chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) experience, and that phase models may help researchers understand disparate results seen in CFS research studies. The model may also be a useful tool for lifestyle modification in <b>age</b> <b>management.</b> Physicians, nurses, psychologists, and social workers are instructed in her courses on how to apply her approach to patients.|$|E

40|$|Purpose - The {{purpose of}} this paper is to present a study of <b>age</b> <b>management</b> in small and {{medium-sized}} enterprises (SMEs) in the UK. Design/methodology/approach - Qualitative data collection and exploratory research with six SMEs comprising of: initial interviews with representatives from the SMEs; action research activities designed to raise awareness of <b>age</b> <b>management</b> issues and age discrimination legislation; and follow-up interviews to ascertain if awareness raising activities resulted in any changes, or planned changes, in policy, practice and attitudes towards older workers. Findings - Good practice in <b>age</b> <b>management</b> can be found in SMEs, but was not found to be part of a systematic strategy. Negative practices and attitudes towards older workers are observed, with positive and negative age stereotypes coexisting. Negative stereotypes displayed can undermine the perceived economic value of older workers. There may be a gap between policy and practice, but awareness raising campaigns that reach employers can influence existing ways of working by showing the benefits of an age diverse workforce and helping reduce prejudices against older workers. Research limitations/implications - The sample size is small and context specific. However, the study usefully illustrates different approaches to <b>age</b> <b>management</b> policies and practices in SMEs, and the potential benefits of <b>age</b> <b>management</b> awareness in influencing attitudes and practices towards older workers in SMEs. Originality/value - The experience of <b>age</b> <b>management</b> in SMEs is under researched and examples of good practice in <b>age</b> <b>management</b> are often drawn from large organisations.

40|$|Abstract. Kori Unit 1, {{which is}} the oldest nuclear power plant (NPP) in Korea has been {{operated}} since 1978. In addition, 10 other NPPs have been operating more than 10 years. As the number of aging plants rise, public concern over the safety of operating NPPs has increased. Periodic safety review (PSR) {{in addition to the}} existing safety assessments are proposed by IAEA as an effective way to verify that operating NPPs maintain the high level of safety. In this regard, the Ministry of Science and Technology (MOST), Korea’s nuclear regulatory body, recently established an institutional process through revision to the atomic energy act to introduce PSR. This PSR considers, among other factors, improvements in safety standards and practices, the cumulative effects of plant aging, operating experience, and the evolution of science and technology. In particular, the assessment and <b>management</b> of plant <b>aging</b> {{is one of the major}} areas. It includes identification of the system, structure and components (SSCs) for <b>aging</b> <b>management,</b> assessment of <b>aging</b> effects and planning of <b>aging</b> <b>management</b> implementation program.

40|$|<b>Ageing</b> <b>management</b> at {{nuclear power}} plants should be {{proactive}} so that to timely detect the ageing degradations, and propose corrective actions to prevent structures, systems and components important to safety from ageing related faults. In order to mange the effect of ageing effectively, there are various plant programmes available which provide guidance on <b>ageing</b> <b>management</b> of active and passive components. Passive components are subject to <b>ageing</b> <b>management</b> review {{in order to identify}} ageing related degradations for given material, environment, stressors and operating loads. A comprehensive <b>ageing</b> <b>management</b> re-view is also required either for license renewal [1] or periodic safety review [2] of {{nuclear power plants}}. Active components which perform their intended functions with moving parts or with a change in con-figuration are subject to preventive maintenance and replacement based on qualified life or specified time period; therefore the <b>ageing</b> <b>management</b> review is typically not performed. Instead, the plant maintenance programmes are established that should be able to detect timely the component degradation before it fails. The plant maintenance and <b>ageing</b> <b>management</b> programmes aim at early detection of component ageing degradations; in an ideal case, there should not be that many ageing related event reports. Despite the plant efforts to handle the ageing of structures and components important to safety, a review of operating experience worldwide shows that there is still number of events reported that were caused by ageing related faults of systems and components to perform their intended functions. This Summary Report presents the results of a comprehensive study [3] performed by the European Clearinghouse on Operating Experience Feedback of NPP with the support of IRSN (Institut de Sûreté Nucléaire et de Radioprotection) and GRS (Gesellschaft für Anlagen und Reaktorsicherheit mbH).
