5|$|Even if {{an ancient}} and {{advanced}} extraterrestrial civilization wished to help humanity, humans could {{suffer from a}} loss of identity and confidence due to the technological and cultural prowess of the extraterrestrial civilization. However, a friendly civilization may calibrate its contact with humanity in such <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>as</b> to minimize unintended consequences. Michael A. G. Michaud suggests that a friendly and advanced extraterrestrial civilization may even avoid all contact with an emerging intelligent species like humanity, {{to ensure that the}} less advanced civilization can develop naturally at its own pace; this is known as the zoo hypothesis.|$|E
5|$|In {{spite of}} the freedom offered by the genres, gay {{characters}} often remain contrived and stereotypical, and most SF stories take for granted the continuation of heteronormative institutions. Alternative sexualities have usually been approached allegorically, or by including LGBT characters in such <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>as</b> to not contradict mainstream society's assumptions about gender roles. Works that feature gay characters {{are more likely to}} be written by women writers, and to be viewed as being aimed at other women or girls; big-name male writers are less likely to explore gay themes.|$|E

5|$|The book {{discusses}} {{the history of}} the division of the Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA) that assigns movie ratings, the Classification and Rating Administration. Heins quotes New York Supreme Court Judge Charles Ramos, who observed that film directors have since learned to style their movies in such <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>as</b> to receive certain ratings from the MPAA.|$|E
5|$|A {{special session}} of the {{legislature}} in 1965 changed the Senate to represent 16 districts and reapportioned the seats, again by county, but did so in such <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>as</b> to make the representation more proportional to population than it had been. Thus, the eastern shore, which had previously elected nine Senators, elected only four after 1965. This was done to preserve the ideal of having whole counties represented by a single Senator, rather than breaking counties up into multiple districts. A constitutional amendment in 1972 expanded the Senate to 47 members, elected from districts proportional to the population. These districts are reapportioned every ten years based on the United States Census to ensure they remain proportional.|$|E

5|$|Contemporary {{political}} sociology includes these areas of research, {{but it has}} been opened up to wider questions of power and politics. Today political sociologists are as likely to be concerned with how identities are formed that contribute to structural domination by one group over another; the politics of who knows how and with what authority; and questions of how power is contested in social interactions in such <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>as</b> to bring about widespread cultural and social change. Such questions {{are more likely to be}} studied qualitatively. The study of social movements and their effects has been especially important in relation to these wider definitions of politics and power.|$|E
5|$|One way of {{clustering}} {{a set of}} {{data points}} in a metric space into two clusters is to choose the clusters in such <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>as</b> to minimize {{the sum of the}} diameters of the clusters, where the diameter of any single cluster is the largest distance between any two of its points. This is preferable to minimizing the maximum cluster size, which may lead to very similar points being assigned to different clusters. If the target diameters of the two clusters are known, a clustering that achieves those targets may be found by solving a 2-satisfiability instance. The instance has one variable per point, indicating whether that point belongs to the first cluster or the second cluster. Whenever any two points are too far apart from each other for both to belong to the same cluster, a clause is added to the instance that prevents this assignment.|$|E
5|$|Owing to the {{original}} 1938 design of the battleships, the Tomahawk missiles could not be fitted to the Iowa-class unless the battleships were physically rebuilt in such <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>as</b> to accommodate the missile mounts that {{would be needed to}} store and launch the Tomahawks. This realization prompted the removal of the anti-aircraft guns previously installed on the Iowas and the removal of four of each of the battleships' ten 5"/38DP mounts. The mid and aft end of the battleships were then rebuilt to accommodate the missile magazines. This resulted in the construction of two separate platforms, one located {{between the first and second}} funnel and one located behind the second funnel, to which MK-143 Armored Box Launcher (ABL) canisters could be attached. Each Armored Box Launcher carried four missiles, and each of the battleships was outfitted with eight canisters, enabling the Iowa-class to carry and fire a total of 32 Tomahawk missiles.|$|E

5|$|Reveton {{initially}} began spreading {{in various}} European countries in early 2012. Variants were localized with templates branded with the logos of different law enforcement organizations {{based on the}} user's country; for example, variants used in the United Kingdom contained the branding of {{organizations such as the}} Metropolitan Police Service and the Police National E-Crime Unit. Another version contained the logo of the royalty collection society PRS for Music, which specifically accused the user of illegally downloading music. In a statement warning the public about the malware, the Metropolitan Police clarified that they would never lock a computer in such <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>as</b> part of an investigation.|$|E
5|$|Severe thunderstorms, {{which can}} spawn tornadoes and hailstorms, require wind shear to {{organize}} the storm in such <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>as</b> to maintain the thunderstorm {{for a longer period}} of time. This occurs as the storm's inflow becomes separated from its rain-cooled outflow. An increasing nocturnal, or overnight, low level jet can increase the severe weather potential by increasing the vertical wind shear through the troposphere. Thunderstorms in an atmosphere with virtually no vertical wind shear weaken as soon as they send out an outflow boundary in all directions, which then quickly cuts off its inflow of relatively warm, moist air and kills the thunderstorm.|$|E
5|$|The first list {{fragment}} {{is followed}} by the canon tables of Eusebius of Caesarea. These tables, which predate the text of the Vulgate, were developed to cross-reference the Gospels. Eusebius divided the Gospel into chapters and then created tables that allowed readers to find where a given episode in the life of Christ was located in each of the Gospels. The canon tables were traditionally included in the prefatory material in most mediaeval copies of the Vulgate text of the Gospels. The tables in the Book of Kells, however, are almost unusable because the scribe condensed the tables in such <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>as</b> to make them confused. In addition, the corresponding chapter numbers were never inserted into the margins of the text, making it impossible to find the sections to which the canon tables refer. The reason for the omission remains unclear: the scribe may have planned to add the references upon the manuscript's completion, or he may have deliberately left them out so as not to spoil the appearance of pages.|$|E

5|$|The story centres on a plot by SMERSH, the Soviet {{counter-intelligence}} agency, {{to assassinate}} Bond in such <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>as</b> to discredit both {{him and his}} organisation. As bait, the Russians use a beautiful cipher clerk and the Spektor, a Soviet decoding machine. Much of the action takes place in Istanbul and on the Orient Express. The book was inspired by Fleming's visit to Turkey on behalf of The Sunday Times to report on an Interpol conference; he returned to Britain by the Orient Express. From Russia, with Love deals with the East–West tensions of the Cold War, {{and the decline of}} British power and influence in the post-Second World War era.|$|E
5|$|The usual grave for a thrall was {{probably}} {{not much more than}} a hole in the ground. He {{was probably}} buried in such <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>as</b> to ensure both that he did not return to haunt his masters and that he could be of use to his masters after they died. Slaves were sometimes sacrificed to be useful in the next life. A free man was usually given weapons and equipment for riding. An artisan, such as a blacksmith, could receive his entire set of tools. Women were provided with their jewelry and often with tools for female and household activities. The most sumptuous Viking funeral discovered so far is the Oseberg Ship burial, which was for a woman (probably a queen or a priestess) who lived in the 9th century.|$|E
