40|$|Objective: to {{determine}} the efficient procedure of postoperative analgesia as a preventive means against the development of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and its associated death in the early postoperative period of <b>adenomectomy.</b> Subjects and methods: The results of treatment were analyzed in 425 patients with concomitant ischemic heart disease who had undergone transvesical <b>adenomectomy</b> at the Unit of Urology, Emergency Care Hospital One, in January 1999 to December 2006. Results. Comparison using Fisher&# 8217;s two-sided exact test showed {{that the incidence of}} AMI was statistically significantly higher in patients in whom postoperative analgesia had been made with trimeperidim on demand versus those in whom analgesia had been performed with the scheduled administration of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents or prolonged epidural anesthesia (p= 0. 02; p= 0. 0267). AMI-related death occurred in the on-demand anesthesia group statistically significantly more frequently (p= 0. 0064; p= 0. 0294). Comparison employing the Newmann-Calse test indicated that the magnitude of pain was statistically significantly less when the elective anesthesia was applied (q= 6. 884; p< 0. 01; q= 15. 954; p< 0. 01).

40|$|Post-prostatectomy urinary {{incontinence}} is an uncommon complication of <b>adenomectomies,</b> occurring in approximately 1 % of cases and being more frequent following radical prostatectomies. There {{is a significant}} implication {{in the quality of}} life for these patients. The surgical techniques employed for its treatment are the implantation of an artificial sphincter, peri-urethral injections and suburethral slings. Considering the low efficacy of peri-urethral injections and the high cost of artificial sphincters, we present in this work a technical modification of the suburethral sling, whose preliminary results are satisfactory. The fundamental modification in this technique is due to the replacement of the synthetic material usually employed for making the sling for autologous tissue, constituted by an aponeurotic strip taken from the rectus muscle of abdomen. This modification aims to minimize risks of urethral erosion that, despite it was not described in this population due to the use of synthetic materials, is a possibility when facing the tension that is used over the bulbar urethra. In addition to such aspects the autologous aponeurosis does not have a cost except for a short prolongation of the surgical act...|$|R

40|$|Background: Myeloperoxidase (MPO) is {{a member}} of the peroxidase- {{cyclooxygenase}} superfamily, which is secreted from stimulated leucocytes at inflammatory sites. It is well known that MPO catalyses oxidation reactions via the release of reactive halogenating and nitrating species and thus induces tissue damage. Several studies have already implicated MPO in the development of neoplasia. Chronic or recurrent prostatic inflammation has long been recognized as having the potential to initiate and promote the development of prostate cancer. The objective was to investigate whether MPO is present in the prostate. METHODS Human prostate material was obtained from biopsies, transurethral resections of the prostate (TURP), prostatic <b>adenomectomies,</b> and retropubic radical prostatectomies. Twenty-nine slides of normal prostate tissue, benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), and prostate cancer were reviewed by a pathologist. Immunohistochemical analysis using MPO-specific human antibody was performed to detect MPO in the prostate tissue. Results: Immunocytohistochemistry showed cellular colocalization of MPO in the secretory epithelial cells of the prostate with staining varying from light to strong intensity. Staining in the glandular apical snouts was often reinforced although staining of basal as well as of luminal glandular cells was also present. Conclusions: We identified, for the first time, the presence of MPO at the surface of prostatic epithelial cells. In view of the pro-oxidant properties of this enzyme, further research is needed to define whether MPO contributes to the development of prostatic lesions. © 2011 Wiley Periodicals,Inc.

40|$|Data on {{the extent}} and {{clinical}} significance of cardiovascular abnormalities in primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT) are conflicting. The main objective of this thesis was to evaluate the cardiovascular function in patients with mild PHPT without other known risk factors and to analyze the effect of parathyroid <b>adenomectomy.</b> Our second aim was to analyze whether an elevated parathyroid hormone level induces any acute effect on endothelial function. In a prospective case-control design, 51 consecutive PHPT patients without any known cardiovascular risk factor were compared to 51 randomly enrolled healthy controls. The patients were re-examined 15 ± 4 months after parathyroid <b>adenomectomy,</b> when parathyroid hormone and calcium levels had normalized. Vitamin D deficiency, defined as 25 -OH-D < 50 nmol/L, was found in 77 % of the patients compared to 20 % of the controls; 40 % of the PHPT patients were still vitamin D deficient at follow-up. Systolic blood pressure and triglyceride levels were higher in cases compared to controls and decreased after parathyroid <b>adenomectomy.</b> Cardiac morphology and function, evaluated by echocardiography and Doppler tissue imaging, were normal in both groups but the systolic myocardial velocities {{were higher in the}} PHPT group at baseline. Both systolic and diastolic blood pressure correlated to the PTH and calcium levels. Structural properties and function of the carotid and radial arteries, evaluated by ultrasound and pulse-wave analysis, were normal in both groups and did not change after parathyroid <b>adenomectomy.</b> Biomarkers of inflammation, coagulation and endothelial function were normal in both groups. The forearm blood flow response to metacholin and nitroprusside, analyzed in young healthy subjects, was not altered during parathyroid hormone infusion. In conclusion, patients with mild PHPT without known cardiovascular risk factors had normal cardiovascular structure and function but a higher systolic myocardial performance at baseline which decreased after parathyroid <b>adenomectomy.</b> Vitamin D deficiency was more common in cases. Parathyroid <b>adenomectomy</b> had an overall positive effect on blood pressure, vitamin D status and triglyceride level.

40|$|The aim of {{the present}} work is to {{describe}} the surgical technique and to assess the feasibility of laparoscopic extraperitoneal <b>adenomectomy</b> in a pilot study. Eighteen consecutive patients in whom an open <b>adenomectomy</b> was planned were operated on in a laparoscopic extraperitoneal fashion. In all patients indication was based on objective signs of obstruction. The laparoscopic approach was standard in all cases as follows: creation of a preperitoneal workspace, haemostatic control of lateral venous vesicoprostatic pedicles, transversal anterior incision of the prostate capsule, progressive enucleation of the adenoma {{with the help of}} an harmonic scalpel, suture of the posterior bladder neck to the prostate fossa, closure of the prostate capsule, and retrieval of the specimen. Feasibility was assessed by objective operative parameters (reconversion, operating time, and blood loss and transfusion requirements) and per operative complications. Data on short term follow-up are also available. Mean age of the patients was 67. 8 years (S. D. 6. 2) and mean prostatic weight calculated by TRUS 95. 1 cm(3) (S. D. 28. 1). Mean maximal flow (Q(max)) was 4. 3 ml/s (S. D. 3. 4) with four patients (22. 2 %) presenting in retention. Mean duration of intervention was 145 min (S. D. 32. 5) and mean blood loss 192 ml (S. D. 178). Mean excised tissue was 47. 6 g (S. D. 30). Neither conversions to open prostatectomy nor transfusions were required. The urethral catheter remained in place an average of 3. 0 days (S.

40|$|Background. Adrenocorticotropic hormone-dependent Cushing’s {{syndrome}} (ACTH-dependent CS) {{is a form}} of endogenous CS {{caused by}} abnormal production of ACTH, in 80  % of cases — due to ACTH oversecretion by a pituitary adenoma (Cushing’s disease), and in 20 % of cases — as a result of ectopic ACTH secretion by an extrapituitary tumor or, very rarely, due to a tumor secreting both ACTH and corticotropin-releasing hormone. The purpose of our study was to evaluate the efficiency of the treatment for ACTH-dependent CS in the postoperative period. Materials and methods. Under supervision, there were 234 patients, out of them 160 women and 74  men aged 26. 38  ±  3. 40 years.

Limited {{data concerning the}} function of ZFP 91 product show {{that it is a}} potential transcription factor upregulated in human acute mye-logenous leukemia and most recently found to be the non-canonical NF-κB pathway regulator. In order to test this finding on a larger number of samples, prostate specimens were obtain-ed from patients undergoing <b>adenomectomy</b> for BPH (n = 21), and as a control, from patients undergoing radical cystectomy for bladder cancer (prostates unchanged pathologically, n = 18). Similar studies were performed on cultured human prostat...|$|E
40|$|An {{alternative}} method to laparoscopic surgery {{has been developed}} for urological procedures. The surgery is minimal access because {{the length of the}} single skin incision ranges from 3 – 6 cm {{depending on the type of}} operation. It is direct access because the surgeon sees the operative area directly and stereoscopically by eye without video-optical support. The procedure requires a special open-lumen retractorscope (JakoscopeTM) with a high intensity fiberoptic light system and modified standard hand instruments. Among the procedures performed nephrectomy, ureterolithotomy, prostatic <b>adenomectomy,</b> spermatic vein ligation and others have been performed. The kidney procedures have been operated retroperitoneally through a minilumbotomy incision. The procedures are simple, rapid and the instruments are inexpensive. The postoperative pain and morbidity are comparable to the laparoscopic approach...|$|E
40|$|Acromegaly is a slowly {{progressive}} disease caused by excessive growth hormone (GH), which {{is related to}} a GH secreting pituitary tumor in most cases. Herein, we describe the epidemiology, clinical characteristics, and treatment of acromegaly in Korea with a literature review. The average annual incidence of acromegaly in Korea was 3. 9 cases per million people, which was {{within the range of}} previous Western studies. The primary treatment for acromegaly was also transsphenoidal <b>adenomectomy,</b> which accounted for 90. 4 % of patients whose primary therapeutic options were known. The overall surgical remission rates were 89 %, 87 %, 64 %, 70 %, and 50 % for modified Hardy classification I, II, IIIA, IIIB, and IV, respectively. An updated and larger study regarding the treatment outcome of medical/radiotherapy in Korean acromegalic patients is needed...|$|E
40|$|We {{describe}} {{the case of}} an acromegalic subject, who was the first patient ever treated with the GH receptor antagonist pegvisomant. Furthermore, in this particular patient, progression in tumor size was encountered during treatment with pegvisomant. The patient de-scribed did benefit from cotreatment with pegvisomant and oct-reotide, including decreased GH levels, normalization of serum in-sulin-like growth factor I concentrations, and improvement of visual field defects. (J Clin Endocrinol Metab 86 : 478 – 481, 2001) THIS 34 -YR-OLD MALE patient was treated by trans-sphenoidal selective <b>adenomectomy</b> for a convex GH-producing pituitary macroadenoma in February 1997. He had, at that time, active acromegaly with fatigue, headaches, excessive perspiration, and joint pains. Before surgery, a single injection of 50 mg octreotide sc decreased the serum GH concentration from 70 ng/mL to minimally 6 ng/m...|$|E
