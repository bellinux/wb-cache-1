5000|$|Other safety {{features}} include a loaded chamber indicator and an integrated limited <b>access</b> <b>lock</b> operated using {{a key to}} prevent unauthorized use. The latter key can be either a handcuff key or a special factory-supplied key. If required, the <b>access</b> <b>lock</b> can be omitted. The locking mechanism is located above the trigger area of the pistol and {{is characterized by a}} small circular plate with two holes in it (in the police version of the pistols there is a handcuff key hole instead of the two small holes). It has two positions: [...] "F" [...] and [...] "S". When pushed in and rotated to the [...] "S" [...] position with the provided key, the lock disables the trigger and barrel and prevents the pistol from being disassembled. This unique system of limiting access to the weapon was patented (...) by Friedrich Aigner in 1999.|$|E

50|$|Trapped key {{interlocking}} utilizes locks and keys for sequential control {{of equipment and}} machinery to ensure safe operation. Trapped key interlocks are widely used to ensure safe access to potentially live or dangerous plant or equipment in an industrial setting. A safe sequence of operations is enabled through transfer of keys that are either trapped or released in a predetermined order. For example, a key is used to isolate a power source (circuit breaker or supply valve), this key is then released and can then be used to gain access through a gate or door to a high risk area by inserting it into an <b>access</b> <b>lock.</b> The key will then remain trapped until the gate or door is closed. A personnel or safety key can be released from the <b>access</b> <b>lock,</b> this ensures that the gate or door can not be closed and the initial key released until this personnel or safety key is returned. This provides increased operator safety.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Distributed file systems use {{file lock}} {{mechanism}} to ensure consistency when the shared data are accessed by multiple nodes. In this paper, using the feature of distributed systems {{that the same}} file would be accessed frequently and the advantage of high concurrency of range lock, the semi-preemptible range lock for pNFS is proposed. Clients locally cache the finer-grained locks for ranges of files they hold. Clients retain or cache range locks even without the file instances. When an <b>access</b> <b>lock</b> is cached, a client answers some requests without a server message, improving performance by exploiting locality. Simulation {{results indicate that the}} proposed locking mechanism can effectively increase concurrency and decrease the communication cost of pNFS...|$|E

40|$|Many {{applications}} {{require the}} ability to obtain ex-clusive access to data, where an application is granted access privilege to an object that cannot be preempted and limits the actions of other pro-cesses. Local le systems support exclusive access to les by maintaining information about the ac-cess rights of current open le instances and check-ing subsequent opens for compatibility. Currently, implementing exclusive access in this manner for distributed le systems degrades performance by requiring every open of every le to be registered with a server that maintains global open state. We introduce a new distributed lock for man-aging le access, called a semi-preemptible lock, which avoids this performance limitation. Clients locally grant open requests for les that are consis-tent with a distributed semi-preemptible lock that they hold. We permit le system clients to retain or cache distributed locks, {{even in the absence}} of open le instances. When a le <b>access</b> <b>lock</b> is cached, a client services an open request for that le without a server message, improving performance by ex-ploiting locality, the afnity of les to clients. ...|$|E

40|$|Physical keys {{made from}} metal or woods {{have been used}} for centuries to operate locks. The {{routines}} for operating a lock did not change significantly by the time. Keys have been carried, stored, lost, searched, lent, and copied. The main intent of locking is making sure that the belongings are kept safe. Hence, security has always been main consideration. Although mechanical <b>Lock</b> <b>Access</b> Control Systems are easy and cost effective to implement, they are insecure and expensive to maintain. Traditional Digital <b>Lock</b> <b>Access</b> Control systems may decrease the problems of mechanical <b>lock</b> <b>access</b> control systems. However, they are still vulnerable to attacks and the costs are usually high. Smart <b>Lock</b> <b>Access</b> Control Systems decrease the security risks and costs caused by fetching, storing, and carrying the physical keys. They also enable distribution of access rights and monitoring activities online. Smart lock solutions are cost effective to implement since they use existing wireless Internet structure (such as home WiFi) and electric locks. A typical Smart <b>Lock</b> <b>Access</b> Control System includes three components: a lock controller which is a microcontroller for operating the electric lock, cloud servers for granting access to the users and monitor activities, and finally a mobile phone which is used as a gateway between the cloud servers and lock controller. This thesis work designs and implements an Android Library for smart phones which will be included in mobile applications to communicate with the lock controller and cloud servers of the system...|$|R
50|$|Turok 3: Shadow of Oblivion is {{an action}} game that is {{presented}} from a top-down perspective. To {{progress through the}} game, the player must control Turok {{through a series of}} levels while wiping out a large number of enemies using different types of weaponry. Some levels have keys that the player need to find to <b>access</b> <b>locked</b> areas and progress further through that level, while others require the player to control a vehicle and destroy structures. The game employs a password system to prevent the loss of progress. Although the game is set in the same fictional universe as its Nintendo 64 counterpart, it features a different storyline. The story follows Turok as he aids peaceful Dinosoids to stop a rebel Dinosoid sect from reawakening an ages-old war.|$|R
50|$|Special duct loading {{conditions}} may occur outside of dead, live, dust and temperature conditions. Ductwork associated with coal mills, coke grinding facilities, {{and to some}} extent grain processing facilities, may be subject to explosive dusts. Ductwork designed for explosive dust is typically designed for 50 psi internal pressure, and will typically have one explosion relief one vent per duct section. the likelihood of a dust explosion on an indirect coal mill system is 100%, over time. This can generate a plum of fire 5 ft. to 15 ft. in diameter, and 20 ft. to 30 ft. long.

50|$|Multi-party {{authorization}} {{technology can}} secure {{the most vulnerable}} and sensitive activities and data sources from attack by a compromised insider acting alone. It is somewhat analogous to weapons systems that require two individuals to turn two different keys in order to enable the system. One person cannot do it alone. Another example is to consider <b>access</b> to a <b>lock</b> box in a bank. That access requires multiple parties, one the lock box owner and another a bank official. Both individuals act together to <b>access</b> the <b>lock</b> box, while neither could do so alone.

40|$|Abstract: Even with Grid technologies, {{the main}} {{mode of access}} for the current High Performance Computing and High Throughput Computing {{infrastructures}} today is logging in via ssh. This mode of <b>access</b> <b>locks</b> scientists to particular machines as {{it is difficult to}} move the codes and environments between hosts. In this paper we show how switching the resource access mode to a Condor glidein-based overlay can bring together computational resources from multiple cyberinfrastructures. This approach provides scientists with a computational infrastructure anchored around the familiar environment of the desktop computer. Additionally, the approach enhances the reliability of applications and workflows by automatically rerouting jobs to functioning infrastructures. Two different science applications were used to demonstrate applicability, one from the field of astronomy and the other one from earth sciences. We demonstrate that a desktop computer is viable as a submit host and central manager for these kind of glidein overlays. However, issues of ease of use and security need to be considered...|$|R
50|$|Memory {{pages in}} working sets are trimmed more {{efficiently}} for multiprocessor systems {{depending on how}} recently they were <b>accessed.</b> <b>Lock</b> contention is reduced, {{as a number of}} unnecessary locks used in resource synchronizations (RAM allocation and mapping through Address Windowing Extensions, system page table entries, charging non-paged/paged pool quotas, charging commitment of pages) have been removed. The dispatcher lock contention has been reduced and the Page Frame Number (PFN) lock has been optimized for increased parallelism and granularity. Windows XP uses push locks on the event synchronization object if there is no contention as they support shared and exclusive acquisition. Push locks are used to protect handle table entries in the Executive, and in the Object Manager (to protect data structures and security descriptors) and Memory Manager (to protect AWE-related locks). Windows XP uses the SYSENTER/SYSEXIT mechanisms which require fewer clock cycles to transition to and from user mode to kernel mode to speed up system calls.|$|R
