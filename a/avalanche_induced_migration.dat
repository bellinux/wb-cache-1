40|$|CC and CXC {{chemokine}} receptor signalling {{networks are}} regulated in different ways. Here {{we show that}} intracellular calcium release and cell migration occur independent of Gβγ activation in response to CCL 3, whereas CXCL 11 <b>induced</b> <b>migration</b> of activated T-lymphocytes depends on Gβγ activation. Treatment {{of a range of}} cell types with gallein, a pharmacological inhibitor of Gβγ signalling, did not result in a reduction in CCL 3 <b>induced</b> cellular <b>migration,</b> but resulted in enhanced calcium mobilisation following chemokine stimulation. Inhibition of PI 3 kinase (PI 3 K) and AKT, which are activated downstream of Gβγ, equally had no effect on calcium release and a minor effect on cell migration. Similarly, inhibition of ERK 1 / 2 did not prevent CCL 3 <b>induced</b> <b>migration.</b> Interestingly, Gβγ as well as PI 3 K activation is necessary for CXCL 11 <b>induced</b> <b>migration</b> of activated T-cells. These data not only confirm a role for Gβγ signalling in CXCL 11 <b>induced</b> <b>migration,</b> but also demonstrate that targeting Gβγ as a therapeutic target to prevent migration in inflammatory disease may not be beneficial, at least not for CCL 3 <b>induced</b> <b>migration.</b> This highlights the distinct differences in the mechanisms on how CC- and CXC-receptors activate cellular migration.

Activation of the {{receptor tyrosine kinase}} ErbB 2 induces formation of proliferative structures that share properties with noninvasive early stage lesions. We conducted a genetic screen to identify cDNAs that can cooperate with ErbB 2 to <b>induce</b> <b>migration</b> in these cells, with the hypothesis that they would represent candidate “second hits” {{in the development of}} invasive breast carcinomas. We found that expression of transforming growth factor (TGF) β 1 and TGFβ 3 in cells expressing activated ErbB 2 <b>induces</b> <b>migration</b> in transwell chambers and invasive behavior in both basement membrane cultures and invasion chambers. The ability of ErbB 2 to cooperate with TGFβ correlated with sustained, elevated activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (Erk) -mitogen-activated protein kinase. Pharmacological reduction of Erk activity inhibited the cooperative effect of TGFβ and ErbB 2 on migration and expression of activated Erk kinase was sufficient to cooperate with TGFβ to <b>induce</b> <b>migration</b> and invasion, suggesting that sustained Erk activation is critical for ErbB 2 /TGFβ cooperation. In addition, we show that costimulation of ErbB 2 and TGFβ induces autocrine secretion of factors that are sufficient to <b>induce</b> <b>migration,</b> but not invasion, by means of both epidermal growth factor receptor-dependent and -independent processes. These results support the role of TGFβ as a pro-invasion factor in the progression of breast cancers with activated ErbB 2 and suggest that activation of the Erk and epidermal growth factor receptor pathways are key in mediating these events...|$|R

Both Indian and Bangladeshi experts were interviewed using semi-structured, in-depth interviews in order to explore insights from locally held perceptions and understandings of contextual factors. In total, 10 Bangladeshi and 15 Indian experts were interviewed, covering different disciplines, sectors, regions and job types, together providing a more complete and grounded picture of views of environmentally <b>induced</b> <b>migration</b> in Bangladesh and India. The results show that climate change is perceived by local experts as one of the key factors influencing migration in Bangladesh, both internally and externally.

Serum levels of the wnt antagonist, Dickkopf- 1, are increased in diseased patients and have been described to affect bone homeostasis in affected joints. Here we introduce an additional role for Dickkopf- 1, the induction of migration in fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLS) in vitro. Our results show that Wnt 5 a and surprisingly, DKK 1 <b>induce</b> <b>migration</b> in wound edge C 57 Bl/ 6 FLS.

40|$|Background: The {{chemokine}} CXCL 12 /SDF- 1 a {{interacts with}} its G-protein coupled receptor CXCR 4 to <b>induce</b> <b>migration</b> of lymphoid and endothelial cells. T cell specific adapter protein (TSAd) {{has been found}} to promote migration of Jurkat T cells through interaction with the G protein b subunit. However, the molecular mechanisms for how TSAd influences cellular migration have not been characterized in detail. Principal Findings: We show that TSAd is required for tyrosine phosphorylation of the Lck substrate IL 2 -inducible T cell kinase (Itk). Presence of Itk Y 511 was necessary to boost TSAd’s effect on CXCL 12 <b>induced</b> <b>migration</b> of Jurkat T cells. In addition, TSAd’s ability to promote CXCL 12 -induced actin polymerization and migration of Jurkat T lymphocytes was dependent on the Itk-interaction site in the proline-rich region of TSAd. Furthermore, TSAd-deficient murine thymocytes failed to respond to CXCL 12 with increased Itk phosphorylation, and displayed reduced actin polymerization and cell migration responses. Conclusion: We propose that TSAd, through its interaction with both Itk and Lck, primes Itk for Lck mediated phosphorylation and thereby regulates CXCL 12 <b>induced</b> T cell <b>migration</b> and actin cytoskeleton rearrangements...|$|R
40|$|LLM (Environmental Law and Governance), North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2015 Environmentally <b>induced</b> <b>migration</b> {{has been}} a {{contentious}} topic {{over the last two}} decades. Estimates show that over 30 million people worldwide are annually forced to migrate due to serious environmental degradation, natural disasters and depletion of natural resources. Thus the environment is irrefutably changing, and clear linkages can be drawn between environmental change and human mobility. Africa‘s developing status and its vulnerability in the context of environmental shocks compels research on prospective impacts and outcomes in order to develop proper mitigation and adaptation strategies, especially in Southern African Development Community (SADC) where the likelihood of protection measures being successfully implemented is relatively low. This dissertation is aimed at providing the reader with a detailed analysis of the regional normative framework regulating the issue of environmentally <b>induced</b> <b>migration</b> in SADC. Because environmental migrants are not considered to be ―refugees‖ in international law and on account of the fact that many policy makers and practitioners have their reservations as regards even acknowledging the existence of environmental migrants, protection and regulation in this regard is understandably lacking. A comprehensive framework is nonetheless required to regulate this phenomenon as it prompts serious security and sovereignty concerns. Until quite recently, most African countries had not even put in place national migration policies. Although many states have policies in place now, most have not yet been fully and effectively implemented. The normative framework governing specifically environmentally <b>induced</b> <b>migration</b> in SADC similarly renders rather disappointing results. Most of the applicable instruments do not directly raise the issue and the provisions indirectly touching upon the subject matter are subject to interpretation. A binding protocol must therefore be adopted by SADC Member States embracing elements contained in the instruments comprising the current framework. Such a protocol will however have to be liberal enough to acknowledge and provide for environmentally <b>induced</b> <b>migration</b> in its entirety whilst conservative enough so as not to undermine protection regimes for refugees in the true sense of the word. Conflicting interests and sovereignty considerations will, however, undoubtedly continue to hinder progress in this regard. The way forward is therefore away from ultimate sovereignty preservation and toward a regionalised approach where human rights no longer take a backseat. Master...|$|R
