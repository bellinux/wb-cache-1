With {{the onset of the}} Depression, she returned to Hollywood and began teaching voice, counting the actors Ramón Novarro and Frances Drake among her pupils. Subsequent theatrical performances on Broadway and on tour included supporting parts in Enter Madame, Night of Love, Claudia, <b>and</b> <b>Lo</b> <b>and</b> <b>Behold.</b> During the 1940s/50s, her voice mellowed to that of a mezzo-soprano and she enjoyed modest success on the concert recital circuit, singing occasionally on radio. On tour, many of her costumes were designed by her friend and patroness, heiress Natalie Hays Hammond, daughter of the real adventurer who discovered King Solomon's Mines.|$|E

2500|$|The kiss between Zoe and Kelly {{received}} criticism. Lesbian news site AfterEllen.com branded it a [...] "gratuitous ratings-stunt" [...] {{and said}} [...] "The writers bottled {{out and the}} two young women dismissed it as a one-off, assuring each other that neither of them was 'like that,' leaving lesbian and bisexual viewers feeling cheated. This was a wasted opportunity, a chance to explore an emotionally complex situation between best friends that became just another exploitive TV moment instead." [...] In an interview about homosexual television characters in The Guardian, scriptwriter Daran Little criticised lesbians in British soaps: [...] "Most lesbian characters are so lipstick. They start off straight <b>and,</b> <b>lo</b> <b>and</b> <b>behold,</b> they just can't resist it. You can see the straight fantasy at work behind the character". Journalist Paul Flynn stated that Zoe {{was an example of}} this, describing her as a [...] "tabloid-friendly 18-year-old—who [...] brushed with lesbianism for all of five minutes." [...] Kinsella defended the kiss in an interview, commenting, [...] "It's not a gratuitous ratings getting move, it's not some kind of big lesbian kiss. It's the way two best friends who have a lot of love for each other show their emotions." ...|$|E

2500|$|Giving {{the order}} to start {{production}} in spring 1962, Fellini signed deals with his producer Rizzoli, fixed dates, had sets constructed, cast Mastroianni, Anouk Aimée, and Sandra Milo in lead roles, and did screen tests at the Scalera Studios in Rome. He hired cinematographer Gianni Di Venanzo, among key personnel. But apart from naming his hero Guido Anselmi, he still couldn't decide what his character did for a living. The crisis {{came to a head}} in April when, sitting in his Cinecittà office, he began a letter to Rizzoli confessing he had [...] "lost his film" [...] and had to abandon the project. Interrupted by the chief machinist requesting he celebrate the launch of 8½, Fellini put aside the letter and went on the set. Raising a toast to the crew, he [...] "felt overwhelmed by shame… I was in a no exit situation. I was a director who wanted to make a film he no longer remembers. <b>And</b> <b>lo</b> <b>and</b> <b>behold,</b> at that very moment everything fell into place. I got straight {{to the heart of the}} film. I would narrate everything that had been happening to me. I would make a film telling the story of a director who no longer knows what film he wanted to make".|$|E

5000|$|Gallagher and Lyle left {{towards the}} end of 1971 to record as a duo, and would enjoy major success in 1976 with their hit-laden fifth album Breakaway. McGuinness Flint would {{continue}} to play some of their compositions in live performances. After several temporary members came and went, including comedian Neil Innes on piano, the group then recruited bassist Dixie Dean on a permanent basis, <b>and</b> recorded <b>Lo</b> <b>and</b> <b>Behold,</b> an album of Bob Dylan songs (which had not yet been officially recorded and released by the writer himself). This album was credited to Coulson, Dean, McGuinness, Flint, and issued in 1972. A single [...] "Let The People Go" [...] was banned by the BBC as it related to the Ulster crisis, a fate which also befell a contemporary single by Wings, [...] "Give Ireland Back to the Irish".|$|R

5000|$|The group {{signed with}} Sydney-based label, Citadel Records, to issue their second studio album, Lo & Behold, in December 1988. It was engineered-produced by Chris Thompson (the Wreckery). By {{the time the}} album had {{appeared}} Jex Saarelaht had joined on piano (ex-Kate Ceberano and Her Septet alongside Peter Jones). Jeannie Zakharov of The Canberra Times previewed their February 1989 gig where the band [...] "will get {{a little help from}} its friends {{in the form of the}} horn section from Hunters and Collectors". She gave a brief history: [...] "they started out playing Velvet Underground songs, went through a blues period then moved toward rock and roll with its various line-up changes, has got good reviews for its new album, <b>Lo</b> <b>and</b> <b>Behold,</b> <b>and</b> single 'Long Time Between Drinks'".|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT. Some theorists are {{bewildered by}} the {{effectiveness}} of mathematical concepts. For example, Steiner attempts {{to show that there}} can be no rational explanation of mathematical applicability in physics. Others (notably Penrose) are concerned primarily with the unexpected effectiveness within mathematics. Both views consist of two parts: a puzzle and a positive solution. I defend their paradoxical parts against the sceptics who do not believe that the very problem of effectiveness is a genuine one. Utilising Horwich’s theory of surprise, I argue that the central cases of effectiveness discussed by Steiner and Penrose are indeed surprising and call for an explanation. 1. STEINER’S PUZZLE There is a familiar problem of mathematical applicability which many theorists consider being the problem of mathematical applicability. Suppose I have two apples in one hand and two apples in another hand. I put all of the apples I am holding into the basket, <b>and</b> — <b>lo</b> <b>and</b> <b>behold</b> — there are four apples there. I repeat the procedure many times, and every time there are four apples in the basket, no less and no more. And suppose further I make a parody of Hempel, and think of my procedure as an experiment...|$|R

5000|$|According to Matt Skiba, {{the band}} were: [...] "doing the photo shoot {{and we had}} a {{completely}} different idea of what the record was going to look like. And Monica was there doing our styling; she got a bunch of outfits and she did the styling for pretty much all the new pictures for the record. She was there and the photographer was just doing all these different things and he had her stand in. He was toying with these different ideas with just a small portion of her face in the picture <b>and</b> then, <b>lo</b> <b>and</b> <b>behold,</b> she's our cover star. So we thought it looked cool and the people at the art department are in cahoots with the photographer who is amazing. Everybody who worked on the thing was cool and hands on and saw these pictures of her and were asking “who is that?” I said “that's my girlfriend” and they said “that's perfect, we have to use her." [...] I think it looks very cinematic, and that's what we were going for. Once it was coming together, it was like film noir.|$|R
5000|$|I Don't Want to Grow Up was {{recorded}} in April 1985 at Music Lab studios in Hollywood with producer and engineer David Tarling, {{who had worked with}} Stevenson on the recording and production of Black Flag's Loose Nut (1985), The Process of Weeding Out (1985), and In My Head (1985). [...] "He was really fond of those '80s production trappings, and the record is polluted and corrupted with them", Stevenson later reflected, complaining that [...] "It sounds like all weird, reverby, crazy '80s shit." [...] He also recalled that at one point Tarling passed out, leading Stevenson to take over the recording controls: [...] "He was having some kind of problems or something, and he was drinking a lot, and he got so drunk while we were recording that he passed out. So I basically kinda rolled his chair {{out of the way and}} rolled my chair in place of it, <b>and</b> then <b>lo</b> <b>and</b> <b>behold,</b> Bill Stevenson is an engineer! And of course that record sounds terrible! I fucked it up good and well, but that's how I started learning. So it was basically a DIY kinda thing." ...|$|R
60|$|The {{wagon and}} the oxen we {{left in the}} {{immediate}} charge of Goza and Tom, our driver and leader, both trustworthy boys, requesting a worthy Scotch missionary who lived in this distant place {{to keep an eye}} on them. Then, accompanied by Umbopa, Khiva, Ventvögel, and half a dozen bearers whom we hired on the spot, we started off on foot upon our wild quest. I remember we were all a little silent on the occasion of this departure, and I think that each of us was wondering if we should ever see our wagon again; for my part I never expected to do so. For a while we tramped on in silence, till Umbopa, who was marching in front, broke into a Zulu chant about how some brave men, tired of life and the tameness of things, started off into a vast wilderness to find new things or die, <b>and</b> how, <b>lo</b> <b>and</b> <b>behold!</b> when they had travelled far into the wilderness they found that it was not a wilderness at all, but a beautiful place full of young wives and fat cattle, of game to hunt and enemies to kill.|$|R

60|$|As {{we drove}} up nearer I saw the little porch {{in front of}} it crowded with gentlemen smoking cigars, and gazing on our {{approach}} just as any set of loafers do from the porch of a fashionable hotel. This was quite a new idea of the matter to me. We had been flattering ourselves on performing an incredible adventure; <b>and</b> <b>lo,</b> <b>and</b> <b>behold,</b> all the world were there waiting for us.|$|E
60|$|Now little Tom watched {{all these}} sweet things given away, till his mouth watered, {{and his eyes}} grew as round as an owl's. For he hoped that his turn would come at last; and so it did. For the lady called him up, and held out her fingers with {{something}} in them, and popped it into his mouth; <b>and,</b> <b>lo</b> <b>and</b> <b>behold,</b> it was a nasty cold hard pebble.|$|E
6000|$|... "My present {{business}} is to enjoy youth, and {{not to think of}} fettering myself, by promise or vow, to this man or that.

Bah! Les penseurs, les hommes profonds et passionnés ne sont pas à mon goût. Le Colonel Alfred de Hamal suits me far better. Va pour les beaux fats et les jolis fripons!

6000|$|... "It {{was never}} after dark she came, but {{daylight}} always, {{as far as}} I mind, but wanst, and that was on a Hallow Eve night. My mother was by the fire, making ready the supper; she had a duck down and some apples. In slips the Wee Woman, 'I'm come to pass my Hallow Eve with you,' says she. 'That's right,' says my mother, and thinks to herself, 'I can give her her supper nicely.' Down she sits by the fire a while. 'Now I'll tell you where you'll bring my supper,' says she. 'In the room beyond there beside the loom--set a chair in and a plate.' 'When ye're spending the night, mayn't ye as well sit by the table and eat {{with the rest of}} us?' 'Do what you're bid, and set whatever you give me in the room beyant. I'll eat there and nowhere else.' So my mother sets her a plate of duck and some apples, whatever was going, in where she bid, and we got to our supper and she to hers; and when we rose I went in, <b>and</b> there, <b>lo</b> <b>and</b> <b>behold</b> ye, was her supper-plate a bit ate of each portion, and she clean gone!" ...|$|R
2500|$|The notes {{accompanying}} the track listing on the LP sleeve {{were taken from}} a Zapple press release written by Richard DiLello, {{who served in the}} position of [...] "house hippy" [...] at the Beatles' Apple headquarters. Among DiLello's comments, he described [...] "No Time or Space" [...] as [...] "a pottage of space music" [...] and said of [...] "Under the Mersey Wall": [...] "in a mounting vortex of decibels, there came to pass a wrecked chord of environmental sound that went beyond the genre of hashish cocktail music.

60|$|In the evening, {{when every}} one {{had left the}} {{workshop}} and gone home, a great longing drove Labakan back {{to the place where}} the royal robe hung.

He felt he must try it on, <b>and</b> <b>lo!</b> <b>and</b> <b>behold,</b> it fitted {{as though it had been}} made for him.|$|E
6000|$|The old beast {{would never}} forgive his niece for marrying Bunter; and years afterwards, when people {{made a point}} of letting him know that she was in London, pretty nearly {{starving}} at forty years of age, he only said: [...] "Serve the little fool right!"

The Bunters were wealthy people now.|$|E
60|$|You {{may depend}} upon it {{the young man}} needed no second bidding to such a matter. Up he rose, and took his basket, and {{followed}} the old man, who led the way up one street and down another, until at last {{they came to a}} rickety, ramshackle house {{in a part of the}} town the young man had never been before. Here the old man stopped and knocked at the door, which was instantly opened, as though of itself, and then he entered with the young spendthrift at his heels. The two passed through a dark passage-way, and another door, <b>and</b> then, <b>lo</b> <b>and</b> <b>behold!</b> all was changed; for they had come suddenly into such a place as the young man would not have believed could be in such a house, had he not seen it with his own eyes. Thousands of waxen tapers lit the place as bright as day--a great oval room, floored with mosaic of a thousand bright colors and strange figures, and hung with tapestries of silks and satins and gold and silver. The ceiling was painted to represent the sky, through which flew beautiful birds and winged figures so life-like that no one could tell that they were only painted, and not real. At the farther side of the room were two richly cushioned couches, and thither the old man led the way with the young spendthrift following, wonder-struck, and there the two sat themselves down. Then the old man smote his hands together, and, in answer, ten young men and ten beautiful girls entered bearing a feast of rare fruits and wines which they spread before them, and the young man, who had been fasting since morning, fell to and ate as he had not eaten for many a day.|$|R
6000|$|<b>And</b> now, <b>lo</b> <b>and</b> <b>behold,</b> here I am {{in their}} heathenish Gehenna, where the Sabbath-day is just clean neglected; indeed, I have lost count myself, {{and do not}} know one day from the other. Oh, man, it's just rideec'lous. A body--I mean a soul--does not know where to turn." [...] Here Peter, whose accent I cannot attempt to {{reproduce}} (he was a Paisley man), burst into honest tears. Though I could not but agree with Peter that his situation was [...] "just rideec'lous," [...] I consoled him as well as I might, saying that a man should {{make the best of}} every position, and that [...] "where there was life there was hope," [...] a sentiment of which I instantly perceived the futility in this particular instance. [...] "Ye do not know the worst," [...] the Rev. Mr. McSnadden went on. [...] "I am here to make them sport, like Samson among the Philistines. Their paradise would be no paradise to them if they had not a pale-face, as they say, to scalp and tomahawk. And I am that pale-face. Before you can say 'scalping-knife' these awful Apaches may be on me, taking my scalp and other leeberties with my person. It grows again, my scalp does, immediately; but that's only that they may take it some other day." [...] The full horror of Mr. McSnadden's situation now dawned upon me, {{but at the same time}} I could not but perceive that, without the presence of some pale-face to torture--Peter or another--paradise would, indeed, be no paradise to a Red Indian. In the same way Tertullian (or some other early Father) has remarked that the pleasures of the blessed will be much enhanced by what they observe of the torments of the wicked. As I was reflecting thus two wild yells burst upon my hearing. One came from a band of Apache spirits who had stolen into the Ojibbeway village; the other scream was uttered by my unfortunate friend. I confess that I fled with what speed I might, nor did I pause till the groans of the miserable Peter faded in the distance. He was, indeed, a man in the wrong paradise.|$|R
60|$|In {{the first}} place, I {{have had the}} extreme {{satisfaction}} to be shown that photograph of your mother. It bears evident traces of the hand of an amateur. How is it that amateurs invariably take better photographs than professionals? I must qualify invariably. My own negatives have always represented a province of chaos and old night in which you might dimly perceive fleecy spots of twilight, representing nothing; so that, if I am right in supposing the portrait of your mother to be yours, I must salute you as my superior. Is that your mother's breakfast? Or is it only afternoon tea? If the first, do let me recommend to Mrs. Barrie to add an egg to her ordinary. Which, if you please, I will ask her to eat to the honour of her son, and I am sure she will live much longer for it, to enjoy his fresh successes. I {{never in my life}} saw anything more deliciously characteristic. I declare I can hear her speak. I wonder my mother could resist the temptation of your proposed visit to Kirriemuir, which it was like your kindness to propose. By the way, I was twice in Kirriemuir, I believe in the year '71, when I was going on a visit to Glenogil. It was Kirriemuir, was it not? I have a distinct recollection of an inn at the end--I think the upper end--of an irregular open place or square, in which I always see your characters evolve. But, indeed, I did not pay much attention; being all bent upon my visit to a shooting-box, where I should fish a real trout-stream, and I believe preserved. I did, too, and it was a charming stream, clear as crystal, without a trace of peat--a strange thing in Scotland--and alive with trout; the name of it I cannot remember, it was something like the Queen's River, and in some hazy way connected with memories of Mary Queen of Scots. It formed an epoch in my life, being the end of all my trout-fishing. I had always been accustomed to pause and very laboriously to kill every fish as I took it. But in the Queen's River I took so good a basket that I forgot these niceties; and when I sat down, in a hard rain shower, under a bank, to take my sandwiches <b>and</b> sherry, <b>lo!</b> <b>and</b> <b>behold,</b> there was the basketful of trouts still kicking in their agony.|$|R
