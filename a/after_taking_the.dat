5|$|Diefenbaker's {{successful}} leadership race {{had been}} run by Allister Grosart, an executive for McKim Advertising Ltd. Soon <b>after</b> <b>taking</b> <b>the</b> leadership, Diefenbaker got Grosart {{to help out}} at Tory headquarters, and soon appointed him national director {{of the party and}} national campaign manager. Grosart appointed a national campaign committee, something which had not been done previously by the Tories, but which, according to Grosart, provided the organizational key to success in 1957. The party was ill-financed, having only $1,000,000 to wage the campaign—half what it had in 1953. Grosart divided most of that money equally by constituency, to the disgruntlement of Quebec Tories, who were used to receiving a disproportionate share of the national party's financing.|$|E

5|$|On 15 June 1645, Koniecpolski's wife, Krystyna, died. Koniecpolski {{remarried}} soon <b>after,</b> <b>taking</b> <b>the</b> hand of 16-year-old Zofia Opalińska, {{daughter of}} future Crown Marshal Łukasz Opaliński, on 16 January 1646. The marriage was short lived, though, ending with Koniecpolski's death in Brody on 11 March 1646. Sources suggest {{that his new}} marriage {{was the cause of}} his death; Joachim Jerlicz wrote in his diary that Koniecpolski had overdosed on an aphrodisiac. His funeral was held in Brody on 30 April 1646.|$|E
5|$|On {{the final}} day of the summer {{transfer}} window, Tranmere Rovers signed Slovakian goalkeeper Peter Brezovan and bought ex-Rochdale striker George Donnelly for an undisclosed fee. Also, defender Hill signed a permanent deal after a successful contribution on a non-contract basis, though shortly after he suffered an Achilles tendon injury that ruled him out for six months. Tranmere was defeated 2–3 at Accrington Stanley, for the third time in the season losing the game <b>after</b> <b>taking</b> <b>the</b> lead. On 8 September, 33-year old Matthew Gill was named assistant manager. After goalless draws against Hartlepool United and Newport County, Tranmere was defeated by Exeter City and Carlisle United with former Rovers winger David Amoo scoring decisive goal for Carlisle.|$|E

5|$|Soon <b>after</b> <b>taking</b> <b>the</b> leadership, Whitlam reorganised the ALP caucus, {{assigning}} portfolios {{and turning}} the Labor frontbench into a shadow cabinet. While the Liberal-Country Coalition {{had a huge}} majority in the House of Representatives, Whitlam energised the party by campaigning intensively to win two by-elections in 1967: first in Corio in Victoria, and later that year in Capricornia (Queensland). The November half-Senate election saw a moderate swing to Labor and against the Coalition, compared with the general election the previous year. These federal victories, in which both Whitlam and Holt campaigned, helped give Whitlam the leverage he needed to carry out party reforms.|$|E
5|$|The IndyCar series had not visited Detroit since 2008, when Justin Wilson won {{the race}} <b>after</b> <b>taking</b> <b>the</b> lead in the last 20 laps when Hélio Castroneves was penalized for {{blocking}} him.

In September 2011, the Detroit City Council approved plans for the race to be held on the weekend of June 1–3, 2012. A month later, it was confirmed that the race would be run in 2012, sponsored by the Chevrolet arm of Detroit-based manufacturer General Motors.|$|E

5|$|The exact route {{taken by}} Odaenathus from Palmyra to Ctesiphon remains uncertain; it is {{probably}} similar to the route emperor Julian took in 363 during his campaign against Persia. Using this route, Odaenathus would have crossed the Euphrates at Zeugma then moved east to Edessa followed by Carrhae then Nisibis; here, he would have descended south along the Khabur River to the Euphrates valley and marched alongside the river's left bank to Nehardea. <b>After</b> <b>taking</b> <b>the</b> city, he penetrated the Sassanian province of Asōristān and marched along the royal canal Naarmalcha towards the Tigris where the Persian capital stood.|$|E
5|$|The free kick {{following}} the intentional safety {{was returned to}} near midfield, and Davis passed for a first down. Following the second down, Davis was sacked for a loss, but then scrambled for a first down to the Tech 25-yard line. From there, however, Boston College's offense began to struggle. During the four plays that followed, the Eagles were able to gain just one yard and turned the ball over on downs again. The final Boston College play was a sack of Davis, and Virginia Tech proceeded to run out the clock by kneeling on the ball <b>after</b> <b>taking</b> <b>the</b> field on offense.|$|E
5|$|A {{corporation}} called RX Tech excavates {{the crash}} site of a meteorite that impacted on Antarctica {{millions of years ago}} and finds strange Rapa Nui-like statues alongside the grave of one of HMS Beagle's sailors. Meanwhile, archaeologist-adventurer Lara Croft is searching for an artefact known as the Infada Stone in the ruins of an ancient Indian Hindu temple once inhabited by the Infada tribe. <b>After</b> <b>taking</b> <b>the</b> artefact from a researcher working for RX Tech, Lara is approached by RX Tech scientist Dr. Willard, who explains that polynesians came across a meteorite crater in Antarctica thousands of years ago and found that it held incredible power. Using rock from the meteorite, they crafted four crystalline artefacts, one of which is the Infada Stone. They then fled Antarctica for unknown reasons, but in the 19th century a group of sailors travelling with Charles Darwin came to Antarctica and rediscovered the artefacts. The four artefacts were then distributed across the globe. Dr. Willard has been able to track the artefacts by using the diary of one of the sailors. Lara agrees to help him find the other three.|$|E

5|$|After this turmoil, Severus faced no more {{internal}} threats for {{the rest}} of his reign, and the reign of his successor Caracalla passed uninterrupted for a while until he was murdered by Macrinus, who proclaimed himself emperor. Despite Macrinus having his position ratified by the Roman senate, the troops of Varius Avitus declared him to be emperor instead, and the two met in battle at the Battle of Antioch in 218 AD, in which Macrinus was defeated. However, Avitus himself, <b>after</b> <b>taking</b> <b>the</b> imperial name Elagabalus, was murdered shortly afterwards and Alexander Severus was proclaimed emperor by both the Praetorian Guard and the senate who, after a short reign, was murdered in turn. His murderers were working on behalf of the army who were unhappy with their lot under his rule and who raised in his place Maximinus Thrax. However, just as he had been raised by the army, Maximinus was also brought down by them and despite winning the Battle of Carthage against the senate's newly proclaimed Gordian II, he too was murdered when it appeared to his forces as though he would not be able to best the next senatorial candidate for the throne, Gordian III.|$|E
5|$|Chambers transitioned {{into the}} senior ranks soon <b>after,</b> <b>taking</b> <b>the</b> 100m silver medal behind his British {{teammate}} Darren Campbell at the 1998 European Championships. He achieved a new personal best in September at the 1998 IAAF World Cup with {{a run of}} 10.03s for third place and won a relay gold medal. At the 1998 Commonwealth Games he was a 100m semi finalist and set a games record {{as part of the}} 4×100m relay team. His ability attracted the attention of former sprinter and Commonwealth Games gold medallist Mike McFarlane, who became his coach. He came first in the 100m in the 1999 European Cup, then at a meet in Nuremberg he became only the second European sprinter (after Linford Christie) to break the ten second barrier with a time of 9.99s. Fellow British sprinter Jason Gardener scored a time of 9.98s in Lausanne soon after, becoming the third Briton to break the barrier. In spite of this, Chambers remained some distance behind his North American counterparts.|$|E
5|$|Delightful Dolly is a 1910 American silent short comedy {{produced}} by the Thanhouser Company. The film follows Marie Allen, an orphan girl who lives with her grandfather, who sees a large doll {{in the window of}} the shop. At night, she sneaks out to visit the shop with the doll, but finds it gone. She sneaks into the shop and ends up hiding in the box, to prevent from being discovered by the store clerk. She is taken to the home of the rich little girl, Daisy. <b>After</b> <b>taking</b> <b>the</b> doll's clothes, Marie hides in the box as Daisy approaches. When Daisy opens the box, Marie acts like a doll. When Daisy takes a break for food, Marie secretly takes the food and drink much to Daisy's bewilderment. Marie's grandfather arrives at the home and explains the situation and Marie receives the doll from the family. Little is known about the production or cast of the film, but Marie Eline played the role of Marie. The film was released on October 14, 1910 and was met with some praise in trade publications. The film is presumed lost.|$|E
