5|$|Māori quickly adopted {{writing as}} a means of sharing ideas, and many of their oral stories and poems were {{converted}} to the written form. Most early English literature was obtained from Britain and {{it was not until the}} 1950s when local publishing outlets increased that New Zealand literature started to become widely known. Although still largely influenced by global trends (modernism) and events (the Great Depression), writers in the 1930s began to develop stories increasingly focused on their experiences in New Zealand. During this period literature changed from <b>a</b> <b>journalistic</b> activity to a more academic pursuit. Participation in the world wars gave some New Zealand writers a new perspective on New Zealand culture and with the post-war expansion of universities local literature flourished. Dunedin is a UNESCO City of Literature.|$|E
5|$|Quatermass II {{received}} positive newspaper {{reviews in}} the Daily Mail and the Daily Express, although the BBC's Radio Times listings magazine published letters of both praise and criticism for the serial. The serial was also criticised internally at the BBC by Cecil McGivern, who felt {{it to be}} {{not as good as}} the original. One letter received by the production team before the transmission of episode five came from a woman in Haverfordwest who was concerned that she would never find out what happened in the end as the week before the final episode's transmission she was due to move to Ireland {{to spend the rest of}} her life in a convent; she wondered if the BBC could possibly write to her and let her know how the story resolved. After some debate as to whether the letter was <b>a</b> <b>journalistic</b> trick to uncover advance story details, Kneale eventually decided that it was genuine, and allowed Cartier to send a reply outlining the storyline's conclusion. Following episode six, some viewers wrote in to the BBC concerned at Quatermass's survival, as he had not been seen to definitely return to Earth in the experimental rocket ship.|$|E

25|$|Following the correction, <b>a</b> <b>journalistic</b> {{review was}} {{conducted}} by Al Ortiz, CBS News' executive director of standards and practices. He determined that red flags about Davies' account were missed. Davies had said to the program and written in his book that he told an alternative version of his actions to his employer, who he said had demanded that he stay inside his Benghazi villa as the attack unfolded. That alternative version was shared with US authorities and 60 Minutes was unable to prove the story Davies had told them was true.|$|E
25|$|Fallmerayer's anti-Russian sentiments {{were not}} yet fully developed, and upon his return to Munich in 1842, he was befriended by the Russian poet and diplomat Fyodor Tyutchev. This latter had been {{entrusted}} by Karl Nesselrode and Alexander von Benckendorff {{to find a new}} spokesperson for Russian interests in Germany. Fallmerayer's Greek thesis had aroused interest in Russian circles, and it was perhaps for this reason that Tyutchev approached Fallmerayer and proposed that he should serve as <b>a</b> <b>journalistic</b> mouthpiece for Czarist policy. Fallmerayer declined, and it has indeed been suggested that his growing opposition to Russian expansionism was provoked by this encounter.|$|E

25|$|In August 1894 the Irish Land and Labour Association (ILLA) {{was formed}} to agitate on behalf of small tenant farmers and agrarian labourers as {{follower}} organisation to the Irish Democratic Trade and Labour Federation, setting forth Michael Davitt’s achievements. As ILLA chairman, Sheehan in alliance with its secretary the Clonmel, County Tipperary solicitor J. J. O'Shee (Member of Parliament for West Waterford from 1895), they campaigned for radical changes both to the Irish Land Acts and the land and labour laws, in particular the granting of smallholdings to rural labourers. After Sheehan returned from <b>a</b> <b>journalistic</b> mission to England in 1898 he threw himself into organising the ILLA, {{at the same time}} convinced that social change could only be advanced by means of political and constitutional agitation, but at no times through physical force.|$|E
25|$|In May 1919 Voigt {{joined the}} {{advertising}} {{department of the}} Manchester Guardian and the following year was dispatched by the editor, C. P. Scott, to act as assistant to the newspaper's Berlin Correspondent, J. G. Hamilton. From 1920 until 1933 Voigt was the Manchester Guardian’s correspondent in Germany, reporting on political, social and economic conditions under the Weimar Republic. He threw himself wholeheartedly into the vibrant cultural and social scene of Weimar Germany and developed valuable contacts {{at all levels of}} German society and particularly on the left of German politics. In 1926 he scored <b>a</b> <b>journalistic</b> coup with his disclosures about the secret collaboration of the Reichswehr and the Soviet military authorities in direct contravention of the military clauses of the Treaty of Versailles, disclosures that sparked a major domestic and diplomatic crisis for the German Government.|$|E
25|$|Upon {{his return}} to the United States, the Arbeelys, a Greek Orthodox family of Damascene origins, had begun {{printing}} Kawkab America (American Star), the first Arabic-language newspaper in North America; Mokarzel set out to open his own newspaper Al-ʿAsr (The Epoch) with capital from his wealthy merchant friend, Najeeb Maalouf. Mokarzel and Nageeb Arbeely engaged in <b>a</b> <b>journalistic</b> feud, personally attacking each other resulting in series of lawsuits and counter-suits between the two newspapers. The enterprise floundered and was discontinued {{less than a year after}} its commencement. Mokarzel attended medical school for two years before dropping out. Meanwhile, Mokarzel was gaining notoriety for his controversial demeanor; he engaged in brawls and verbal disputes with other Arabic-speaking immigrants and was arrested on several occasions for libel and physical assault against members of the community affiliated with the Arbeely family. The brawls that started as a result of professional competition and personal antipathy evolved into sectarian battles between Mokarzel's Maronite entourage and the Orthodox families of the community. Despite his multiple arrests, Mokarzel was never jailed but the incidents were to continue. In 1895, Tannous Shishim, a Lebanese immigrant, petitioned for divorce from his wife Sophie on the ground of adultery and Mokarzel was named co-respondent in the court proceedings. The Arbeelys were quick to publish the culpable news in their newspaper along with a bilingual transcript of the judge's decision, further tarnishing the reputation of Mokarzel. The accused couple got married and eloped to Philadelphia to flea the community's public denunciation.|$|E

500|$|In June 1979 Stiefel asked {{a former}} Nazi Party archivist, August Priesack, {{to verify the}} {{authenticity}} of the diary, which he subsequently did. Priesack showed the diary to Eberhard Jäckel of the University of Stuttgart, who also thought the diary to be genuine, and wanted to edit it for publication. News of the diary's existence soon began to filter through to collectors of Hitler memorabilia. At the end of 1979 Tiefenthaeler contacted Heidemann to say that Stiefel had shown him around his collection, which included a Hitler diary—the only one Kujau had forged to that point. According to Hamilton [...] "the discovery inflamed Heidemann almost to madness", and he aggressively pressed for what would be <b>a</b> <b>journalistic</b> scoop.|$|E

Richardson wrote how [...] "Fleming's method is worth noting, and recommending: he does not start indulging in his wilder fantasies until he has laid down a foundation of factual description." [...] Elements of a review by Raymond Chandler for The Sunday Times were used as advertising for the novel; Chandler wrote that it was [...] "about the nicest piece of book-making {{in this type of}} literature which I have seen for a long time...

For example, Benson says that Hemingway drew out his experiences with [...] "what if" [...] scenarios: [...] "what if I were wounded {{in such a way}} that I could not sleep at night? What if I were wounded and made crazy, what would happen if I were sent back to the front?" [...] Hemingway believed that the writer could describe one thing while an entirely different thing occurs below the surface—an approach he called the iceberg theory, or the theory of omission.|$|E

500|$|At {{the press}} conference both Trevor-Roper and Weinberg {{expressed}} their doubts at the authenticity, and stated that German experts needed to examine the diaries to confirm whether the works were genuine.

He finished his statement by saying that [...] "I regret that the normal method of historical verification has been sacrificed to the perhaps necessary requirements of <b>a</b> <b>journalistic</b> scoop." [...] The leading article in The Guardian described his public reversal as showing [...] "moral courage". Irving, who had been described in the introductory statement by Koch as a historian [...] "with no reputation to lose", stood at the microphone for questions, and asked how Hitler could have written his diary in the days following the 20 July plot, when his arm had been damaged. He denounced the diaries as forgeries, and held aloft the photocopied pages he had been given from Priesack. He asked if the ink in the diaries had been tested, but there was no response from the managers of Stern. Photographers and film crews jostled to get a better picture of Irving, and some punches were thrown by journalists while security guards moved in and forcibly removed Irving from the room, while he shouted [...] "Ink!
