Why did you choose that name? When Ryan and I came up with the name in Astoria, when we <b>were</b> planning <b>our</b> first <b>bike</b> tour. It seemed fitting for {{what we were trying to}} do. We hadn't heard of anyone else who had done it and we hadn't booked that many shows. It was if we were flying into the unknown. We couldn't see what's going to happen.|$|R

5000|$|A {{music video}} {{for the song}} was filmed on 19 May 2016 in both singers' hometowns - Shakira's Barranquilla, Colombia and Vives's Santa Marta. It was {{directed}} by Spanish director and photographer Jaume de Laiguana. Some of the locations where it was filmed included Pescaíto and Shakira's college. The concept behind it was to follow the song's lyrics and allow Vives to take Shakira for a ride in the most important places where they grew up. The duo also wanted to show Colombian culture to its viewers, including [...] "unforgettable places", beaches, football fields. Various images were uploaded by both artists on their respective Instagram accounts prior to the clip's release. Prior to its release, Vives and Shakira shared numerous images showing them riding bicycles and being surrounded by fans. During {{an interview with the}} Associated Press, Vives described the shooting as both fun and emotional for the singers as they felt like [...] "kids again". He further elaborated, [...] "The work was intense but also delightful. Both for Shaki and for me, being back in our territory, plus the emotional load that this had for us, it was wonderful. We were really happy riding <b>our</b> <b>bikes,</b> singing on <b>our</b> <b>bikes.</b> We wanted to do everything barefoot. We strolled happily to several places... And watching Shaki contented, happy, reuniting with her friends, with her people, I think that the video registered a very, very special energy." ...|$|R

Cone states on the development of his character, [...] "Six months ago I drove cross-country with some friends. We brought <b>our</b> <b>bikes</b> so we could ride as much as possible.

I was seven or eight when I first saw their festivals and performance presentations from my parents’ bedroom window. I remember my awe at their colourful costumes, masks and music. On a daily basis I remember the pungent smell of the soy sauce they produced in a factory in their backyard. We also shopped at a small neighbourhood supermarket called Shinohara. We bought paper and sticks for our kites from a general store owned by another Japanese migrant. We would tell our mother {{that we were going}} to ride <b>our</b> <b>bikes</b> to the ‘Japonesa’ to get kite material. At home, caqui (Japanese kaki) was my favourite fruit, but we also had all sorts of vegetables the Japanese migrants brought from Japan.

5000|$|MotoGP's 800 cc era officially {{began with}} the first race of the 2007 MotoGP season, at the Losail International Circuit in Qatar. Casey Stoner won the race on the new GP7. The bike had a clear top speed {{advantage}} {{over the rest of}} the grid, due to its higher output motor. A new track record was set on the GP7. Second place contender and five time World champion, Yamaha's Valentino Rossi, realised that [...] "unfortunately, there was too much difference between (<b>our)</b> <b>bikes</b> in the straight" [...] and [...] "Our Yamaha will never go as quick on a straight as the Ducati." [...] These words turned out to be true, as the GP7 enjoyed a top speed advantage throughout the season, although the other manufacturers (Yamaha, Honda, Kawasaki and Suzuki) closed the gap significantly {{by the end of the}} year. Stoner and his Bridgestone-shod Ducati proved to be the top combination in MotoGP and he won the world championship at Motegi, Japan, on September 23, 2007, four races before the end of the season.|$|R
5000|$|According to the {{original}} Etemaad story, one of the boyfriends recalls the events in this way: [...] "In an instant, three young men approached us in a threatening manner and said some horrible things to us. Then, Mohammad, one of those men, attacked us with a rock. Samieh got off of my motorcycle and approached the men to fight them. Roozbeh and I were both scared, so we got on our motorcycles to flee, and just as we got on <b>our</b> <b>bikes,</b> I {{saw one of the}} men on the ground bleeding." [...] No source has reported what independent witnesses said about the encounter. The Etemaad news story also reports {{that at the time of}} the attack, Fatehi was a runaway who was disowned by her family; however, a phone interview with Fatehi's mother is reported to have shown that her mother displayed great concern about her daughter's fate, and that she tearfully pleaded for her daughter's life. In the same interview, Nazanin's mother reportedly confirmed that she had asked the mother of the deceased man for pardon, but that she had been refused.|$|R
40|$|Bike sharing systems {{facilitate}} {{and promote}} biking {{as a public}} transportation alternative, providing benefits {{to the health and}} the environment. Contemporary bike sharing systems are automated and robust, but still have drawbacks. These are, for example, dependence on immovable stations with limited capacity and availability of service, only present in selected cities. Moreover, currently there are no solutions for automated bike sharing for private and corporate use. In this thesis, we introduce a bike sharing system designed as a service for company employees. This system allows using the bikes for short trips or commuting. The focus of the thesis is on creating a smart bike lock, which is a device that enables automated bike access management. Currently, there are no smart bike locks available commercially off-the-shelf. However with <b>our</b> <b>bike</b> management system, relying on a custom-made smart bike lock, the companies can offer their employees shared bikes with minimal management effort. The system has been tested in a controlled environment, and the device has been evaluated. The results are positive: the device fulfils the core requirements of the system and can be used as part of the service. The current smart bike lock is still a prototype. Further work is necessary to improve the design and add features such as short range wireless...|$|R
40|$|Symmetry. Not {{only makes}} it our world round, but it's also {{what makes it}} go round. From the perfect {{circular}} wheels on <b>our</b> <b>bikes</b> and cars that deliver an enjoyable ride, to the error-correction protocols that keep e-mails from turning into junk; it's literally all around us. It's also symmetry that dictates the laws of nature. On the small scale the symmetry group of the Standard Model controls the interactions in molecules, atoms, and nuclei. On the large scale gravity is governed by Einstein's symmetry principle of our space-time. This thesis deals with a certain class of symmetries known as Kac-Moody algebras. In contrast to the symmetries of the Standard Model and gravity, Kac-Moody algebras are infinite. They appear {{in the context of}} M-theory, an as of yet unknown theory that might both describe the Standard Model and gravity. In this thesis we will show how Kac-Moody algebras unify all the low-energy limits of M-theory, which are known as supergravities. Moreover, the Kac-Moody algebras contain information that corresponds exactly to all the known gauge deformations of these supergravities. We will demonstrate how to obtain the field content of the various gauged supergravities from Kac-Moody algebras, and attempt to relate the equations of motion of both sides to each other. ...|$|R

40|$|Many {{cities and}} {{universities}} {{around the world}} are considering bike share and bike library programs in their sustainability plans. In such programs bikes are made available for participants to check out from a designated location and use for an allocated amount of time. As seniors we realized how heavily we have relied on <b>our</b> <b>bikes</b> these past four years. Overall, biking is very popular on campus, and a program that allows students to check out bikes for very low costs allows our campus to implement sustainable practices and encourages biking. During this project we studied bike share programs in the United States and around the world. We researched aspects of bike share programs including size, costs, and overall benefits. Cities have reported benefits including improved fitness of residents, decreased CO 2 emissions, decreased need for vehicular parking, and increased pressure to improve bike infrastructure. In addition, this program offers a sustainable solution to some of the challenges ESF will face in the future such as parking constraints. In order to create a successful program at SUNY ESF we conducted surveys, made general observations about bike transportation, and talked to various administrators. In the end, we developed a bike library program to fit the needs and constraints of SUNY ESF. In doing so, we hope to increase accessibility and connectivity between the campus and other areas of interest such as grocery stores, cultural points, and the city. We expect our program to expand as ridership increases, spreading to the rest of university hill and beyond...|$|R

25|$|Due to {{equipment}} {{rotation and}} maintenance concerns, Caltrain said in 2009 {{that it could}} not dedicate cars with higher bike capacity on trains with high bike demand. Many of you have written to ask a series of questions about this new effort: Why can’t we provide two bike cars on every train? Why can’t we provide two bike cars on my train? Why can’t we provide two bike cars on the most heavily used trains? Why is there only one bike car on trains that are supposed to have two bike cars? The simplest answer to most of these questions is that we don’t have enough bike cars to put two on every train, or even on every peak train, and, in doing all we can to expand service for our cycling customers, we have to be mindful of the impact of these changes on our entire system and all of our customers, particularly on on-time performance. All of our cars, not just <b>our</b> <b>bike</b> cars, serve <b>our</b> entire schedule throughout our entire day, which means they rotate through the schedule, and also must be rotated out of service for fueling, washing, maintenance and federally mandated safety and operational inspections. A train set that starts its day in San Jose may finish its day in Millbrae and be cycled to San Francisco for its daily maintenance and to begin the next day at the San Francisco station. Because of this rotation – because of the demands of our entire service schedule – we can’t guarantee that a specific stop on the schedule will have a specific train.}} Eventually, two bike cars were added to every train consist by 2011, and in 2016, a third bike car was added to Bombardier consists.|$|R
