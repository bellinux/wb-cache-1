5|$|Lynching was <b>a</b> <b>terrifying</b> and {{relatively}} uncommon spectacle. It could involve victims being hanged furtively by a mob at night, or {{in front of}} hundreds or even thousands of witnesses during the day. An audience of 10,000, including the mayor and chief of police, {{was said to have}} attended the lynching of Jesse Washington in Waco, Texas, in 1916. As well as being hanged, victims were sometimes burned alive and tortured, and body parts were removed and kept as souvenirs.|$|E
5|$|In Roanoke, Virginia, Wayne Weinsider (Bruce Campbell) and his {{pregnant}} wife Laura (Lisa Jane Persky) learn via an ultrasound scan that their unborn child has bizarre physical abnormalities, such as horn-like protrusions. Weinsider appears to be especially distraught after hearing the news. That night, Laura has <b>a</b> <b>terrifying</b> dream in which a demon-like figure snatches the baby from her womb. When she wakes up, the couple discover that Laura has seemingly miscarried. Laura's brother, local deputy sheriff Arky Stevens, reports her story to the X-Files section at the FBI. Agent Jeffrey Spender (Chris Owens) discards the report, but Agent Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) salvages the case and travels to Virginia, along with Agent Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) to interview the Weinsiders.|$|E

5|$|Adi Da's {{father told}} Rudi of his son's onetime {{aspiration}} {{to become a}} Lutheran minister. Feeling that he needed better grounding, in 1965 Rudi insisted that he marry Nina, find steady employment, lose weight, end his drug use, and begin preparatory studies to enter the seminary. As a student at Philadelphia's Lutheran Theological Seminary in 1967, Adi Da described undergoing <b>a</b> <b>terrifying</b> breakdown. Taken to a hospital emergency room, a psychiatrist diagnosed it as an anxiety attack. It {{was the first in}} a series of such episodes he would experience throughout his life, each followed by what he explained to be profound awakenings or insights. Feeling none of his Lutheran professors understood this experience, Adi Da left and briefly attended St. Vladimir's Russian Orthodox Seminary in Tuckahoe, New York. Disillusioned, he moved back to New York City and got a job working for Pan American Airlines, in hopes this would facilitate his being able to visit Swami Muktananda's ashram in India. He did so for four days in April 1968. Swami Muktananda encouraged Adi Da to end his studies with Rudi and study with himself directly.|$|E
5|$|Returning to Salisbury in January 1980, Mugabe {{was greeted}} by a {{supportive}} crowd. He settled into a house in Mount Pleasant, a wealthy white-dominated suburb. Machel had cautioned Mugabe not to alienate Rhodesia's white minority, warning him that any white flight after the election would cause economic damage {{as it had in}} Mozambique. Accordingly, during his electoral campaign Mugabe avoided the use of Marxist and revolutionary rhetoric. Mugabe insisted that in the election, ZANU would stand as a separate party to ZAPU, and refused Nkomo's request for a meeting. He formed ZANU into a political party, known as Zimbabwe African National Union – Patriotic Front (ZANU-PF). Predictions were made that ZANU-PF would win the election {{on the basis of the}} country's ethnic divisions; Mugabe was Shona, a community that made up around 70% of the country's population, while Nkomo was Ndebele, a tribal group who made up only around 20%. For many in the white community and in the British government, this outcome was <b>a</b> <b>terrifying</b> prospect due to Mugabe's avowed Marxist beliefs and the inflammatory comments that he had made about whites during the guerrilla war.|$|E
25|$|Among Italians the Pandafeche may {{refer to}} an evil witch, {{sometimes}} a ghost-like-spirit or <b>a</b> <b>terrifying</b> cat-like creature. Sleep paralysis among Cambodians is known as, “the ghost pushes you down,” and entails {{the belief in}} dangerous visitations from deceased relatives. In Egypt, sleep paralysis is conceptualized as <b>a</b> <b>terrifying</b> Jinn attack. The Jinn (i.e., evil genies) may terrorize and even kill its victims. Sleep paralysis is sometimes interpreted as space alien abduction in the United States.|$|E

25|$|Flak from German {{anti-aircraft}} guns resulted in planes either going under or over their prescribed altitudes.

25|$|Until {{the first}} century, comets were usually {{considered}} bad omens of deaths of kings or noble men, or coming catastrophes, or even interpreted as attacks by heavenly beings against terrestrial inhabitants. From ancient sources, such as Chinese oracle bones, {{it is known}} that their appearances have been noticed by humans for millennia. One very famous recording of a comet is the appearance of Halley's Comet as <b>a</b> <b>terrifying</b> omen on the Bayeux Tapestry, which records the Norman conquest of England in AD 1066.|$|E
25|$|The Khan also {{employed}} {{tactics that}} made his numbers seem greater than they actually were. During night operations he ordered each soldier to light three torches at dusk to give the illusion of an overwhelming army and deceive and intimidate enemy scouts. He also sometimes had objects tied to the tails of his horses, so that riding on open and dry fields raised {{a cloud of dust}} that gave the enemy the impression of great numbers. His soldiers used arrows specially notched to whistle as they flew through the air, creating <b>a</b> <b>terrifying</b> noise.|$|E
25|$|Pippin {{picked up}} the palantír of Orthanc after Gríma Wormtongue threw it at them. Later, obsessed by the mysterious stone, Pippin took it out of Gandalf's hands while the wizard slept, putting a rock in its place. Looking into the stone, he had <b>a</b> <b>terrifying</b> {{encounter}} with Sauron himself. In fact, Pippin is the only character in the book who is shown to speak directly to Sauron. To keep Pippin safe from Sauron's forces, Gandalf {{brought him to the}} city of Minas Tirith, separating him from his friends.|$|E

25|$|He bowls {{fast and}} {{obviously}} scorns to conserve his strength. He is {{in a hurry}} to be at the batsman. He turns sharply to begin his run, jumps off at a great pace, throws up his arm high, and then makes <b>a</b> <b>terrifying</b> leap into the air—a leap which one feels should be accompanied by a yell. At the end of his over he snaps up the ball, if it is anywhere within reach, and passes it hurriedly to the colleague who is having at them at the other end. With it all, his length was under control, and for a time the batsmen could make nothing of him.|$|E
25|$|Towards dusk, the Martians {{renew their}} offensive, {{breaking}} through the defence-line of siege guns and field artillery centred on Richmond Hill and Kingston Hill by a widespread bombardment of the black smoke; an exodus {{of the population of}} London begins. This includes the narrator's younger brother, a medical student, also unnamed, who flees to the Essex coast after the sudden, panicked, predawn order to evacuate London is given by the authorities, <b>a</b> <b>terrifying</b> and harrowing journey of three days, amongst thousands of similar refugees streaming from London. The brother encounters Mrs. Elphinstone and her younger sister-in-law, just in time to help them fend off three men who are trying to rob them. Since Mrs. Elphinstone's husband is missing, the three continue on together. After <b>a</b> <b>terrifying</b> struggle to cross a streaming mass of refugees on the road at Barnet, they head eastward. Two days later, at Chelmsford, their pony is confiscated for food by the local Committee of Public Supply. They press on to Tillingham and the sea. There they manage to buy passage to the Continent on a small paddle steamer, part of a vast throng of shipping gathered off the Essex coast to evacuate refugees. The torpedo ram HMS Thunder Child destroys two attacking tripods before being destroyed by the Martians, though this allows the evacuation fleet to escape, including the ship carrying the narrator's brother and his two travelling companions. Shortly thereafter, all organised resistance has ceased, and the Martians roam the shattered landscape unhindered.|$|E
25|$|The Rake: A hideous phantasm of {{a former}} sorcerer named Domville who tested Immacolata by {{becoming}} a necromancer {{in an attempt to}} seduce her, believing himself to be more powerful than her. The attempt failed when he brought forth 'the Surgeons' (although it is never confirmed, it is heavily implied that these were the Cenobites from Barker's earlier work 'The Hellbound Heart' and its subsequent film adaptation 'Hellraiser'), who proceeded to fillet him. He is resurrected by Immacolata as <b>a</b> <b>terrifying</b> boneless demon and sent to assassinate the Seerkind which he does, claiming the life of Lillia before being destroyed by a passing train after being lured onto the tracks by Cal and Nimrod.|$|E

25|$|The Muslim forces {{advanced}} {{towards the}} Accursed Tower {{and forced the}} Frankish garrison to retreat {{to the side of}} the Gate of St. Anthony. All counter-attacks and attempts made by the Hospitallers and the Templars to recapture the tower were in vain. King Henry II and the Master of the Hospital boarded their galleys and fled from Acre. William of Beaujeu, the Master of the Temple, and Matthew of Clermont were killed. By capturing these positions, the Muslim forces were now inside the city fighting the Franks in the streets and alleys of Acre, which turned into <b>a</b> <b>terrifying</b> chaos as the inhabitants were fleeing towards the sea. How many inhabitants perished on land and in sea is unknown.|$|E
25|$|La Comédie de la Mort, {{published}} in 1838, {{is a period}} piece much like Albertus. In this work, Gautier focuses {{on the theme of}} death, which for Gautier is <b>a</b> <b>terrifying,</b> stifling and irreversible finality. Unlike many Romantics before him, Gautier's vision of death is solemn and portentous, proclaiming death as the definitive escape from life's torture. During the time he wrote the work, Gautier was frequenting many cemeteries, which were then expanding rapidly to accommodate the many deaths from epidemics that swept the country. Gautier translates death into a curiously heady, voluptuous, almost exhilarating experience which diverts him momentarily from the gruesome reality and conveys his urgent plea for light over darkness, life over death. Several of these poems have been set as melodies by composers such as Berlioz, Bizet, Fauré, and Duparc.|$|E

Manager Stuart Ullman warns Jack that a previous caretaker, Charles Grady, developed cabin fever and killed his family and himself. In Boulder, Jack's son, Danny Torrance, has <b>a</b> <b>terrifying</b> premonition about the hotel, viewing a cascade of blood emerging from an elevator door, and then falls into a trance. Jack's wife, Wendy, tells a doctor that Danny has an imaginary friend named Tony, and that Jack has given up drinking because he dislocated Danny's shoulder following a binge.|$|E
