Aims. This paper presents first {{results from the}} 14 May, 2014 observing campaign of the Martian atmosphere at 4. 7 THz using the German REceiver for Astronomy at Terahertz frequencies (GREAT) instrument. Methods. The atomic oxygen 63 mu m transition, OI, was detected in absorption against the Mars continuum, with a high signal-to-noise ratio (similar to 35). A beam-averaged atomic oxygen from a global circulation model was used as input to the radiative transfer simulations of the observed line area and to obtain a new estimate on the column density using <b>a</b> <b>grid-search</b> <b>method.</b> Results. Minimizing differences between the calculated and observed line intensities in the least-square sense yields an atomic oxygen column density of (1. 1 +/- 0. 2) x 10 (17) cm(2). This value is about twice as low as predicted by a modern photochemical model of Mars. The radiative transfer simulations indicate that the line forms in the upper atmospheric region over a rather extended altitude region of 70 - 120 km. Conclusions. For the first time, a far-infrared transition of the atomic oxygen line was detected in the atmosphere of Mars. The absorption depth provides an estimate on the column density, and this measurement provides additional means to constrain the photochemical models in global circulation models and airglow studies. The lack of other means for monitoring the atomic oxygen in the Martian upper atmosphere makes future observations with the SOFIA observatory highly desirable...|$|E
30|$|Focal {{mechanisms}} often earthquakes {{were calculated}} using a recently-developed method by Zahradník et al. (2001), and Zahradník (2002). This method {{is based on}} the amplitude spectra of complete waveform data and the first-motion polarities, hereafter ASPO. The waveforms recorded by velocity sensors at the nearest local stations were employed. The take-off angles were calculated using the ray-method code ANGGRA (Jansky, 2001). In the ASPO method, the amplitude spectra were computed for waveforms of 60 s duration in the frequency range 1.0 – 2.0 Hz. The spectra were then synthesized by the discrete wave-number method of Bouchon (1981), and Coutant (1989), using the velocity model of El-Khrepy (2008). <b>A</b> <b>grid-search</b> <b>method</b> was applied to three parameters: strike, dip, and rake angles. For each set of these model parameters, both the observed, and synthetic, spectra were normalized in order to put them on a comparable amplitude level. Band-pass filtering from 1.0 to 2.0 Hz was performed for the amplitude spectra. The normalization was performed by dividing the spectra by their average value computed for all components and frequencies at all available stations (taken over all stations, components and frequencies). The misfit at each station was calculated as a weighted L 1 norm of the difference between the observed and synthetic amplitude spectra, and then summed over all stations, components and frequencies. The misfit function, introduced by Zahradník et al. (2001), not only reduces the undesired biasing effect of the largest amplitude at the near stations, but also normalizes the misfit values between 0 and 1. Here, amplitude spectra solutions were constrained with first-motion polarities to obtain optimum solutions whose misfits are between ± 5 %. The procedure was repeated for a set of ten trial source depths. We started with a coarse search with a broad depth range (5 – 40 km), and then a fine search was focused around the minimum misfit value in a narrow depth range of 2 -km intervals. To find the best-fit double-couple solution, the strike, dip, and rake were finely searched at 2 -degree intervals. Finally, the scalar moment was retrieved with no grid-search procedure, since the problem is linear with respect to the scalar moment. Instead of grid searching, unit-moment synthetic spectra were calculated for the preferred mechanism and depth. The ratio between the observed and synthetic spectra (averaged over all the data points) yields the seismic moment (Zahradník et al., 2004). The SGRAPH program (Ab-delwahed, 2012), with its implemented ASPO technique, is used to handle the processes of waveform analysis and focal mechanism estimation.|$|E

40|$|The largest {{earthquakes}} occur {{along the}} subduction thrust interface {{known as the}} seismogenic zone. Until recently, erosive margins like Tonga and Honshu have been thought to be unable to support earthquakes with magnitudes higher than 8. 5. However, Mw 9, 2011 Tohoku-oki earthquake in Honshu requires a reevaluation of this notion. The seismic potential of Tonga is likely affected by the vertical spatial extent of the up-dip and down-dip limits, which confines the seismogenic zone. The larger {{the area of the}} seismogenic zone, the higher the potential for larger earthquakes. Some models suggest that down-dip limit coincides with the fore-arc Moho while others suggest that they are coincident with thermally controlled mineralogical phase changes during slab descent. Tonga is an ideal place to discriminate between these possibilities, as the incoming Pacific plate is cold and thick with rapid convergence, extending cool isotherms deep into the system. In contrast, the fore-arc Moho is only ~ 16 km deep. This study tests the hypothesis that the down-dip limit of the Tonga seismogenic zone coincides with the fore-arc Moho and thus ceases the seismicity by initiating a stable sliding between the mantle and the subducting crust. We determine the depth of the down-dip limit in Tonga by mapping the distribution of earthquakes recorded for a six-month period from January 1, 2010 to June 30, 2010 by a deployment of ocean bottom seismographs above the Tonga subduction zone. The earthquakes are located by <b>a</b> combination of <b>grid-search</b> <b>method</b> and least-square inversion of the observed arrival times.

It is likely controlled by the degree of serpentinization in the mantle wedge controlling the transition from stick-slip to stable sliding...|$|R
