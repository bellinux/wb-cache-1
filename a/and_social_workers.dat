5|$|Following another Royal Commission {{investigation}} 1911, {{there were}} some rapid changes in prison policy. A new superintendent with outside experience, Hugh Hann, was appointed, {{and supported by the}} newly elected Labor government interested in penal reform. Fremantle Prison was partially used as a military gaol during both world wars. The World War II takeover necessitated the commissioning of Barton's Mill Prison in 1942, which remained opened after the war. Pardelup Prison Farm was another prison outstation established in 1927 to reduce overcrowding at Fremantle. Both facilities were part of reforms made to the prison system, but significant changes to the operation of Fremantle Prison did not begin until the 1960s. Comptroller General Colin Campbell introduced expedient prisoner assessments, officer training, work release programs, <b>and</b> <b>social</b> <b>workers</b> and welfare officers.|$|E
5|$|The {{majority}} of Paris's salaried employees fill 370,000 businesses services jobs, {{concentrated in the}} north-western 8th, 16th and 17th arrondissements. Paris's financial service companies are concentrated in the central-western 8th and 9th arrondissement banking and insurance district. Paris's department store district in the 1st, 6th, 8th and 9th arrondissements employ 10 percent of mostly female Paris workers, with 100,000 of these registered in the retail trade. Fourteen percent of Parisians work in hotels and restaurants and other services to individuals. Nineteen percent of Paris employees work for the State in either in administration or education. The {{majority of}} Paris's healthcare <b>and</b> <b>social</b> <b>workers</b> work at the hospitals and social housing concentrated in the peripheral 13th, 14th, 18th, 19th and 20th arrondissements. Outside Paris, the western Hauts-de-Seine department La Défense district specialising in finance, insurance and scientific research district, employs 144,600, and the north-eastern Seine-Saint-Denis audiovisual sector has 200 media firms and 10 major film studios.|$|E
5|$|In {{spite of}} these suspicions, many African-American leaders {{supported}} efforts to supply birth control to the African-American community. In 1929, James H. Hubert, a black social worker and leader of New York's Urban League, asked Sanger to open a clinic in Harlem.Engelman, p. 160. Sanger secured funding from the Julius Rosenwald Fund and opened the clinic, staffed with African-American doctors, in 1930. The clinic was guided by a 15-member advisory board consisting of African-American doctors, nurses, clergy, journalists, <b>and</b> <b>social</b> <b>workers.</b> It was publicized in the African-American press and African-American churches, and received the approval of W. E. B. Du Bois, co-founder of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP). In the early 1940s, the Birth Control Federation of America (BCFA) initiated a program called the Negro Project, managed by its Division of Negro Service (DNS).Engelman, pp. 175–177. As with the Harlem clinic, the primary aim of the DNS and its programs was to improve maternal and infant health. Based on her work at the Harlem clinic, Sanger suggested to the DNS that African Americans {{were more likely to}} take advice from a doctor of their own race, but other leaders prevailed and insisted that whites be employed in the outreach efforts. The discriminatory actions and statements by the movement's leaders during the 1920s and 1930s have led to continuing allegations that the movement was racist.Allegations of racism can be found in Franks, Angela (2005), Margaret Sanger's Eugenic Legacy: The Control of Female Fertility, McFarland; and in Davis, Angela (1981), Women, Race, and Class.|$|E

25|$|While {{some public}} health officials, pediatricians, <b>and</b> <b>social</b> <b>workers</b> wanted to {{eliminate}} midwifery, {{others did not}} think this would solve the problem. In the 1910s and 1920s, S. Josephine Baker, director of the New York City Bureau of Child Hygiene, advocated to keep midwives because many immigrants and African-Americans whom midwives have traditionally served could not afford the care of physicians. As such, {{the solution of the}} “midwife problem” was to train, license, and regulate them.|$|E
25|$|For the {{provision}} of primary care, Spain is currently divided geographically in basic health care areas (áreas básicas de salud), each one containing a primary health care team (Equipo de atención primaria). Each team is multidisciplinary and typically includes GPs, community pediatricians, nurses, physiotherapists <b>and</b> <b>social</b> <b>workers,</b> together with ancillary staff. In urban areas all the services are concentrated in a single large building (Centro de salud) while in rural areas the main center is supported by smaller branches (consultorios), typically single-handled.|$|E

25|$|A {{rehabilitation}} team is usually multidisciplinary as it involves staff with different skills {{working together to}} help the patient. These include physicians trained in rehabilitation medicine, clinical pharmacists, nursing staff, physiotherapists, occupational therapists, speech and language therapists, and orthotists. Some teams may also include psychologists <b>and</b> <b>social</b> <b>workers,</b> since at least one-third of affected people manifests post stroke depression. Validated instruments such as the Barthel scale {{may be used to}} assess the likelihood of a stroke patient being able to manage at home with or without support subsequent to discharge from a hospital.|$|E
25|$|Management {{of those}} with trauma often {{requires}} the help of many healthcare specialists including physicians, nurses, respiratory therapists, <b>and</b> <b>social</b> <b>workers.</b> Cooperation allows many actions to be completed at once. Generally {{the first step of}} managing trauma is to perform a primary survey that evaluates a person's airway, breathing, circulation, and neurologic status. After immediate life threats are controlled, a person is either moved into an operating room for immediate surgical correction of the injuries, or a secondary survey is performed that is a more detailed head-to-toe assessment of the person.|$|E
25|$|Because {{hotels in}} the U.S. were segregated, the men convened in Canada at the Erie Beach Hotel on the Canadian side of the Niagara River in Fort Erie, Ontario.

Moskowitz, who was Jewish, was then also Associate Leader of the New York Society for Ethical Culture. They met in 1906 at Harpers Ferry, West Virginia, and in 1907 in Boston, Massachusetts.|$|E
