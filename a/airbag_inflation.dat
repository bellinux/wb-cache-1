The radar's antenna is mounted at one of the lower corners of the lander tetrahedron. When the radar measurement showed the lander was the correct distance above the surface, the Zylon bridle was cut, releasing the lander from the parachute and backshell so that it was free and clear for landing. The radar data also enabled the timing sequence on <b>airbag</b> <b>inflation</b> and backshell RAD rocket firing.|$|E
40|$|Many {{industrial}} design optimization and stochastic analysis problems have the following common features: (i) the response functions are evaluated {{as a result}} of expensive numerical computations, and (ii) function values may contain some level of numerical noise. In this paper these features are addressed by the use of high quality approximations of the response functions with a particular focus on the Moving Least Squares Method (MLSM). The technique is illustrated by the application of MLSM to the automatic calibration and robustness assessment of the driver's <b>airbag</b> <b>inflation</b> process. Calibration of the dynamic response of the airbag is formulated as an optimization problem. The objective is to minimize the difference between the experimental test and numerical simulation results. Once calibration has been achieved, an assessment of its robustness is performed, which utilizes the same approximation by MLSM technology as in the optimization process...|$|E

The aim of this work is to provide information about the passenger presence and location within the vehicle, from stereo data. The results of this classification will be used for an active <b>airbag</b> control: the <b>inflation</b> could be activated, depovered or deactivated with respect to the seat configuration. The paper will focus on the extraction of a 3 D global representation of the seat area, from a 3 D image, and on the classification performed using this global description...|$|R
40|$|NURBS-based isogeometric {{analysis}} was first extended to thin shell/membrane structures {{which allows for}} finite membrane stretching as well as large deflection and bending strain. The assumed non-linear kinematics employs the Kirchhoff-Love shell theory to describe the mechanical behaviour of thin to ultrathin structures. The displacement fields are interpolated from the displacements of control points only, and no rotational degrees of freedom are used at control points. Due to the high order Ck (k ≥ 1) continuity of NURBS shape functions the Kirchhoff-Love theory can be seamlessly implemented. An explicit time integration scheme is used to compute the transient response of membrane structures to time-domain excitations, and a dynamic relaxation method is employed to obtain steady-state solutions. The versatility and good performance of the present formulation is demonstrated {{with the aid of}} a number of test cases, including a square membrane strip under static pressure, the inflation of a spherical shell under internal pressure, the inflation of a square <b>airbag</b> and the <b>inflation</b> of a rubber balloon. The mechanical contribution of the bending stiffness is also evaluated...|$|R
40|$|There is {{increasing}} pressure to reduce injuries and fatalities by effectively using airbags for side impact and out-of-position impact loading conditions. The simulation of these scenarios is particularly difficult as the occupant is {{interacting with the}} airbag at early times during the airbag deployment when the detailed behaviour of the airbag can have a significant effect. A new <b>airbag</b> <b>inflation</b> simulation capability that overcomes this problem has been integrated into the crash simulation software MADYMO. This allows accurate simulation of the gas flow within the airbag throughout the inflation and unfolding process. The new module uses CFD techniques to numerically model the interior volume of the airbag in detail. The pressure field within the airbag is directly coupled to the standard MADYMO FE model of the airbag. Hence, the acceleration and movement of the airbag and any bodies in contact with it can be predicted more accurately...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} a 3 -D vision {{system based on}} a new 3 -D sensor technology for the detection and classification of occupants in a car. New generation of so-called ”smart airbags ” require {{the information about the}} occupancy type and position of the occupant. This information allows a distinct control of the <b>airbag</b> <b>inflation.</b> In order {{to reduce the risk of}} injuries due to airbag deployment, the airbag can be suppressed completely in case of a child seat oriented in reward direction. In this paper we propose a 3 -D vision system based on a 3 -D optical time-of-flight (TOF) sensor, for the detection and classification of the occupancy on the passenger seat. Geometrical shape features are extracted from the 3 -D image sequences. Polynomial classifier is considered for the classification task. A comparison of classifier performance with principle components (eigenimages) is presented. This paper also discuss the robustness of the features with variation of the data. The full scale tests have been conducted on a wide range of realistic situations (adults/children/child seats etc.) which may occur in a vehicle. 1...|$|E
40|$|In van Opstal et al. (Comput Mech 50 : 779 – 788, 2012) <b>airbag</b> <b>inflation</b> {{simulations}} {{were performed}} where the flow was approximated by Stokes flow. Inside the intricately folded initial geometry the Stokes assumption is argued to hold. This linearity assumption {{leads to a}} boundary-integral representation, the key to bypassing mesh generation and remeshing. It therefore enables very large displacements with near-contact. However, such a coarse assumption cannot hold throughout the domain, where it breaks down one needs to revert to the original model. The present work formalizes this idea. A model adaptive approach is proposed, in which the coarse model (a Stokes boundary-integral equation) is locally replaced by the original high-fidelity model (Navier–Stokes) based on a-posteriori estimates of the error in a quantity of interest. This adaptive modeling framework aims at taking away the burden and heuristics of manually partitioning the domain while providing new insight into the physics. We elucidate how challenges pertaining to model disparity can be addressed. Essentially, the solution {{in the interior of}} the coarse model domain is reconstructed as a post-processing step. We furthermore present a two-dimensional numerical experiments to show that the error estimator is reliable...|$|E
40|$|The {{controlled}} combustion {{of solid}} propellants {{is vital to}} rocket motor design, weapon system design and gas generators used for <b>airbag</b> <b>inflation</b> and fire suppression. Given the characteristics of any propellant and structural system, a model of combustion {{should be able to}} establish the energy release and corresponding pressure generated by the propellant on the system. Due to inherent complexities associated with propellant ignition and combustion, the description of propellant burn and consequent impact on structural design is not well understood. This article investigates the nature of propellant burn through the development of a computer simulated model. More specifically, governing equations of solid propellant combustion based on the Nobel [...] Abel equation of state are introduced into a finite element environment to perform fluid-structure interaction modelling on the system. The Nobel [...] Abel Equation of State in conjunction with a steady state burning law, which describes the recession rate of the burning propellant, is incorporated into a finite element environment through a user subroutine. The fluid-structure interaction capabilities allowed for the impact of the evolving gasses on the structure of the system to be analysed. The derived model empowered the analysis {{of a wide range of}} system parameters their effect on system performance. Results of material stress/ strain and fluid dynamics are presented...|$|E
40|$|An energy {{absorbing}} airbag system includes {{one or more}} vent valve assemblies for controlling the release of <b>airbag</b> <b>inflation</b> gases to maintain inflation gas pressure within an airbag at a substantially constant pressure during a ride-down of an {{energy absorbing}} event. Each vent valve assembly includes a cantilever spring that is flat in an unstressed condition and that has a free end portion. The cantilever spring is secured to an exterior surface of the airbag housing and flexed to cause the second free end portion of the cantilever spring to be pressed, with a preset force, against a vent port or a closure covering the vent port to seal the vent port until inflation gas pressure within the airbag reaches a preselected value determined by the preset force whereupon the free end portion of the cantilever spring is lifted from the vent port by the inflation gases within the airbag to vent the inflation gases from within the airbag. The resilience of the cantilever spring maintains a substantially constant pressure within the airbag during a ride-down portion of an energy absorbing event by causing the cantilever spring to vent gases through the vent port whenever {{the pressure of the}} inflation gases reaches the preselected value and by causing the cantilever spring to close the vent port whenever the pressure of the inflation gases falls below the preselected value...|$|E
40|$|Recent {{laboratory}} investigations {{suggest that}} a deploying airbag may fracture the forearm. These studies positioned the arm in an overhand grasp placing the forearm over the airbag module. However, there is little published data on how drivers grip {{the steering wheel and}} the general proximity of the upper extremity to the airbag module. The objective of the current study was to identify 'real world' upper extremity positions and to correlate these with accident and experimental data. A survey of the National Automotive Sampling System (NASS) for the years 1995 - 1999 reveled {{an increase in the number}} of forearm fractures due to driver-airbag interaction. As NASS does not provide information about the position of the forearm, common upper extremity positions were identified in a volunteer driving population. These positions were simulated using a specially instrumented 50 th percentile male dummy to determine the relative injury risk for the different positions. Analysis showed that an under hand grasp of the wheel turned 90 degrees yielded the highest magnitude impact event. The single position was then simulated in nine cadaver experiments. Dual stage airbag deployments produced forearm fractures in two arms. Experiments using the contralateral arms from the fractured subjects with a single stage airbag deployment produced no fractures. Analysis of forearm kinematics suggests that increasing forearm velocity and thus, acceleration exposure, is associated with forearm injury. Further, the data suggests that reductions in acceleration exposure via reduced <b>airbag</b> <b>inflation</b> decreased the apparent risk of forearm fracture...|$|E

This dissertation presents a novel MEMS based human airbag system used as a hip protector. A Micro Inertial Measurement Unit (muIMU) which is based on MEMS accelerometers and gyro sensors is developed as the motion sensing part of the system. The result using this muIMU based on Support Vector Machine (SVM) training to recognize falling-motions are presented, where we showed that selected eigenvector sets generated from 200 experimental data can be separated into falling and other motions completely. For real-time recognition, the SVM filter should be embedded to a high speed DSP system for fast computation and complex filter analyses. After the simulations for SVM filter and FFT were performed on a computer simulator (TI DSP 320 C 6713), we used DSK 6713 (DSP Starter Kit) as our target board and integrated FFT and SVM filter on the chip. The whole algorithm works well with exist sensor data. Demo shows that our DSP system can successfully classify fall and non-fall states. At the same time, the system can trigger our <b>airbag</b> <b>inflation</b> mechanism when a fall occurs. The system was shown to open the airbag in real-time and protected the experimenter's hip area. by Shi, Guangyi. "March 2008. "Adviser: Wen Jung Li.

40|$|In 1997, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration amended its {{requirements}} for frontal crash performance under Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard 208 to temporarily allow 30 mph (48 kph) sled tests with unbelted dummies {{as an alternative}} to 30 mph head-on rigid-barrier vehicle tests. This change permitted automakers to reduce <b>airbag</b> <b>inflation</b> forces so that they {{would be less likely to}} injure occupants who are close to airbags when they first deploy. Most vehicle models were sled-certified starting in model year 1998. Airbag-related deaths have decreased since 1997; however, controversy persists about whether reduced inflation forces might be decreasing protection for some occupants in high-severity frontal crashes. To examine the effects of the regulatory changes, this study computed rate ratios (RR) and 95 percent confidence intervals (95 % CI) for passenger vehicle driver deaths per vehicle registration during 2000 – 02 at principal impact points of 12 o’clock for 1998 – 99 model year vehicles relative to 1997 models. Passenger vehicles included in the study had both driver and passenger front airbags, had the same essential designs during the 1997 – 99 model years, and had been sled-certified for drivers throughout model years 1998 and 1999. An adjustment was made for the higher annual mileage of newer vehicles. Findings were that the effect of the regulatory change varied by vehicle type. For cars, sport utility vehicles, and minivans combined, there was an 11 percent decrease in fatality risk in frontal crashes after changing to sled certification (RR= 0. 89; 95 % CI= 0. 82 – 0. 96). Among pickups, however, estimated frontal fatality risk increased 35 percent (RR= 1. 35; 95 % CI= 1. 12 – 1. 62). For a broad range of frontal crashes (11, 12, and 1 o’clock combined), the results indicated a modest net benefit of the regulatory change across all vehicle types and driver characteristics. However, the contrary finding for pickups needs to be researched further...|$|E
40|$|This study {{investigates the}} {{relevance}} of certain parameters for virtual testing of the driver's side OOP problem and attempts {{to answer the following}} questions: Which level of detail is needed in the airbag models to assess occupants' injury values for OOP scenarios? What is the influence of the airbag cover on the occupant response for OOP situations and how to accurately model the airbag cover? Are current dummy models suitable to assess the localized human injuries and/or is it beneficial to include human models for injury assessment? The combined multibody-FE code MADYMO was used. A virtual set-up of a folded driver airbag including cover, steering wheel and a simple seat forms the base model. Occupants were positioned according to the two OOP driver positions defined in FMVSS 208, i. e. chin on module to maximize neck injury risk and chest on module to maximize chest injury risk. The 5 th percentile Hybrid III. dummy model as well as the 5 th percentile human model were used and different <b>airbag</b> <b>inflation</b> and cover modeling techniques were investigated. Attention was focussed on analyses of the injury values obtained from the simulations of the different situations (with / without cover, use of gasflow, human / dummy model). From this study, it is concluded {{that it is important to}} take into account the geometrical effects of the airbag cover on airbag deployment and hence injury generation in OOP simulations. Adding a gasflow description to the airbag deployment simulation resulted in differences in the early deployment phase. If the dummy's injuries are determined in this phase (dependent of scenario), gasflow contributes to improved airbag modeling at the cost of higher CPU times. From the human model simulations, it is concluded that for this specific scenario, using dummy models could lead to underestimation of human injuries in the chest region, in contrast to overestimation of the head acceleration and the neck loads in the rebound phase. Therefore, human models could provide additional value compared to dummy models. Copyright © 2004 TNO-Automotive...|$|E
40|$|Mammalian cells {{require a}} {{continuous}} and sufficient supply of oxygen {{to carry out}} their functions. The oxygen pathway has an overall direction taking O 2 from the air to the mitochondria, which {{is a result of the}} mitochondrial O 2 consumption (VO 2) NO various effects on the mitochondria: at low concentrations for short periods NO specifically and irreversibly inhibits cytochrome c and reversibly inhibits cytochrome c oxidase, to decrease VO 2. Thus, NO can modulate VO 2 of skeletal muscle. The purpose of the present study was to measure VO 2 of the rat spinotrapezius muscle under conditions of altered NO. The methods used provide a direct way to measure PO 2 in the interstitium (PISFO 2) and use it as indicator of local metabolic changes. Intravital microscopy and phosphorescence quenching were used to record PISFO 2 in resting muscle for 120 s before, 60 s during, and 420 s after a period of tissue compression that abruptly halted perfusion. Control VO 2 measurements were made, followed by those in which the spinotrapezius muscle had been treated by topical application of agents known to alter NO levels (L-NAME, C-PTIO, Sperm/NO). The compression was achieved by rapid inflation of a Saran film air bag, attached to a X 20 objective lens, which pressed the muscle against the animal platform. The rapid pressure onset (0 - 120 mmHg in ISFO 2, which started immediately after the <b>airbag</b> <b>inflation,</b> was used to calculate VO 2 and was based on the assumption that the amount of blood in the tissue after compression was small. Control VO 2 was 5. 91 ± 0. 2 ml O 2 · kg- 1 · min- 1. Since the presence of RBCs sequestered in capillaries cannot be ruled out during compression, this value can be considered a lower limit for VO 2 by resting muscle. Comparison of baseline and treatment measurements of VO 2 showed no significant differences between them. This was unexpected based on in vitro studies and may reflect an impaired ability of the agents used to alter NO at the mitochondrial level...|$|E
40|$|Foot {{and ankle}} {{injuries}} in frontal car collisions {{are believed to}} be caused mainly by occupant contact with the floor and toepan, occupant interaction with the pedals, and the lower leg being deformed between the floor and knee bolster. A better understanding of the causes of foot and ankle injuries is required to design cars for improved safety of the legs. In this study, mathematical models were developed, evaluated by crash tests, and used in parametric studies to examine the factors that influence the injury outcome. The models will serve as a basis for the development of principles for countermeasures effective in a variety of crash situations. Dynamic tests with biological materials were conducted to obtain more information about injury tolerances of the human ankle in dorsiflexion loading. Mathematical vehicle-occupant models were developed in the multi body and finite element software MADYMO. The models were assessed by both crash tests and sled tests. Parametric studies were made using the mathematical models according to statistical methods. Two approaches were used in the mathematical modelling: investigation of the toepan design, and examination of the safety performance of the same car with and without safety systems. All of the toepan design parameters tested were found to have an effect on lower leg responses: the dummy responses also differed significantly depending on the foot position, occupant size and crash severity. To design cars for improved lower leg safety, efforts should be made to reduce the toepan acceleration and intrusion distance in particular. However, the simulations in this study showed that there is an important interaction between the timing of the peak acceleration and the intrusion distance: when the right foot of the driver was resting on the toepan {{at the time of the}} crash, the axial force in the right tibia increased with toepan acceleration; the intrusion magnitude was of minor importance. However, when the right foot rested initially on an accelerator that was displaced during the crash, the axial force increased with the intrusion magnitude, and toepan acceleration was of minor importance. Moreover, this study showed that the local deformation of the toepan is a likely cause of lower leg injuries and must be reduced. The interaction effects of the parameters investigated were also obvious in the examination of safety systems. Although an airbag in the toepan area might considerably reduce the tibial responses, the designers have to be aware that using a foot airbag optimized for a severe crash situation can actually increase the load on the lower leg in less severe crash situations. In this study, the foot-ankle load increased in 50 % of all crash situations. Therefore, it is desirable to be able to measure the occupant size and crash severity and to adjust the <b>airbag</b> <b>inflation</b> in a crash situation. In the biological tests, lower leg specimens were struck at the plantar side of the foot and the ankle responses were measured. The average dorsiflexion angle at the time of injury was 42 ° and the average ankle moment in tests with fractures was 61 Nm. The mathematical modelling techniques used in this study proved to be useful tools for investigating lower leg responses in car crashes. The models developed can simulate the complex shape of toepan intrusion and the interaction between the occupant and the vehicle. The investigation of the causes of injury provided valuable information for designing vehicles with better lower leg safety...|$|E
40|$|Mars Pathfinder, {{the first}} low-cost, quick Discovery class mission to be completed, {{successfully}} {{landed on the}} surface of Mars on July 4, 1997, deployed and navigated a small rover, and collected data from 3 science instruments and 10 technology experiments. The mission operated on Mars for 3 months and returned 2. 3 Gbits of new data, including over 16, 500 lander and 550 rover images, 16 chemical analyses of rocks and soil, and 8. 5 million individual temperature, pressure and wind measurements. The rover traversed 100 m clockwise around the lander, exploring about 200 square meters of the surface. The mission captured the imagination of the public, and garnered front page headlines during the first week. A total of about 566 million internet "hits" were registered during the first month of the mission, with 47 million "hits" on July 8 th alone, making the Pathfinder landing by far the largest internet event in history at the time. Pathfinder was the first mission to deploy a rover on Mars. It carried a chemical analysis instrument, to characterize the rocks and soils in a landing area over hundreds of square meters on Mars, which provided a calibration point or "ground truth" for orbital remote sensing observations. The combination of spectral imaging of the landing area by the lander camera, chemical analyses aboard the rover, and close-up imaging of colors, textures and fabrics with the rover cameras offered the potential of identifying rocks (petrology and mineralogy). With this payload, a landing site in Ares Vallis was selected because it appeared acceptably safe and offered the prospect of analyzing a variety of rock types expected to be deposited by catastrophic floods, which enabled addressing first-order scientific questions such as differentiation of the crust, the development of weathering products, {{and the nature of the}} early Martian environment and its subsequent evolution. The 3 instruments and rover allowed seven areas of scientific investigation: the geology and geomorphology of the surface, mineralogy and geochemistry of rocks and soils, physical properties of surface materials, magnetic properties of airborne dust, atmospheric science including aerosols, and rotational and orbital dynamics of Mars. Scientists were assembled into 7 Science Operations Groups that were responsible for requesting measurements by the 3 instruments, rover and engineering subsystems for carrying out their scientific investigations and for analyzing the data and reporting on their findings. The spacecraft was launched on December 4, 1996 and had a 7 month cruise to Mars, with four trajectory correction maneuvers. The vehicle entered the atmosphere directly following cruise stage separation. Parachute deployment, heatshield and lander separation, radar ground acquisition, <b>airbag</b> <b>inflation</b> and rocket ignition all occurred before landing at 2 : 58 AM true local solar time (9 : 56 : 55 AM PDT). The lander bounced at least 15 times up to 12 in high without airbag rupture, demonstrating the robustness of this landing system. Reconstruction of the final landing sequence indicates that the parachute/backshel 1 / 1 ander was tilted due to a northwest directed wind and wind shear, which resulted in the lander bouncing about I km to the northwest and initially downhill about 20 m from where the solid rockets fired. Two anomalously bright spots located in the lander scene are likely the heatshield, which continued in a ballistic trajectory about 2 km downrange (west southwest), and the backshell/parachute, which stayed nearer to where the rockets fired. Unconnected disturbed soil patches in the scene indicate that the final few bounces of the lander were from the east-southeast and were followed by a gentle roll to the west before coming to rest on the base petal. The location of the lander away from where the solid rockets fired and considerations of the exhaust products used to inflate the airbags and their fate, indicate that the Pathfinder landing system is one of the cleanest designed leaving the local area essentially contaminant free. The radio signal from the low-=gain antenna was received at 11 : 34 AM PDT indicating a successful landing...|$|E
