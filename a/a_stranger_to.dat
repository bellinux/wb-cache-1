5|$|Several {{witnesses}} {{testified against}} him. The widow Eliza Sharp {{testified that the}} voice of the killer was distinct. A test was devised allowing Mrs. Sharp to hear Beauchamp's voice; she immediately identified it as that of the killer. (Beauchamp claimed he had disguised his voice {{on the night of the}} murder and thought Mrs. Sharp would not recognize it). Patrick Henry Darby, an Old Court partisan, claimed that in 1824, he had a chance encounter with the man he now knew as Beauchamp. Darby said the man – <b>a</b> <b>stranger</b> <b>to</b> him at the time – had asked for Darby's help in prosecuting an unspecified claim against Sharp. The man then identified himself as the husband of Anna Cooke and said he intended to kill Sharp. Based on the circumstantial evidence, Beauchamp was held for trial at the next term of the circuit court in March 1826.|$|E

He appeared, too, in such Verdi parts as Manrico (in Il trovatore), Radames (Aida) and Otello (Otello).

His appointment allowed him a servant, paid as a royal expense, but women were completely prohibited on French navy ships at this time. At some point, the idea of Baret disguising herself as a man in order to accompany Commerson was conceived.

500|$|Henry Tudor was {{unfamiliar}} with the arts of war and <b>a</b> <b>stranger</b> <b>to</b> the land {{he was trying to}} conquer. He spent the first fourteen years of his life in Wales and the next fourteen in Brittany and France. [...] Slender but strong and decisive, Henry lacked a penchant for battle and was not much of a warrior; chroniclers such as Polydore Vergil and ambassadors like Pedro de Ayala found him more interested in commerce and finance. [...] Having not fought in any battles, Henry recruited several experienced veterans on whom he could rely for military advice and the command of his armies.|$|E

[...] Humphries was therefore the natural choice to work on the band's new material, although as <b>a</b> <b>stranger</b> <b>to</b> EMI's Abbey Road set-up he encountered some early difficulties. [...] On one occasion, Humphries inadvertently spoiled the backing tracks for [...] "Shine On", a piece that Waters and drummer Nick Mason had spent many hours perfecting, with echo.

Filipovitch-Robinson notes the intimate feel of the painting, which she attributes to Jovanović's familiarity with Balkan life. [...] "He was not <b>a</b> <b>stranger</b> <b>to</b> the scene," [...] she states. [...] "He knew his cast of village characters, their interactions, attitudes and consequent expressions and body language." [...] The composition itself, she continues, depicts both [...] "preparation and celebration". The gold coins the bride is wearing, Filipovitch-Robinson observes, are part of the dowry, and signal [...] "familial obligation and pride as well as contractual expectations even among villagers of modest means". She goes on to contrast the bride's elaborate garb with the impoverished plainness of her surroundings.|$|E

500|$|Crown Duel is a 2002 {{young adult}} fantasy novel written by American author Sherwood Smith, {{originally}} published as two separate books, Crown Duel (1997) and Court Duel (1998). Both stories {{take place in}} the fictional land of Sartorias-deles, a fantasy world Smith has written about since her youth. The first book follows the adventures of young Countess Meliara [...] "Mel" [...] Astiar of Tlanth as she and her small group of forces rebel against the greed of King Galdran; along the way the mysterious Marquis of Shevraeth aids her, though she distrusts him. With the king now dead, the second part focuses on Mel's journey to the court in Remalna-city, where she must navigate court intrigues surrounding Shevraeth's rise to power as king. [...] In 2008 Smith also published a prequel about Shevraeth: <b>A</b> <b>Stranger</b> <b>to</b> Command.|$|E
500|$|As {{he disliked}} both Arabs and Christians, some scholars, such as Bowersock, have taken Zosimus' {{silence on the}} matter as strong {{evidence}} against Philip's alleged Christianity. Others, like historian Warwick Ball, view Zosimus' evident distaste for Philip as noteworthy, and suggest that Zosimus' anti-Christian polemic is indirect in his writing on the emperor. Shahîd construes Zosimus' silence as an argument for Philip's Christianity. Zosimus, he argues, would never have shown such distaste for a pagan. Septimius Severus was a [...] "barbarian", an African born at Leptis Magna whose mother tongue was Phoenician and whose wife, Julia Domna, was a provincial from Emesa. But Severus gets a good press from Zosimus (1.8). Nor would Philip's assistance in the execution of Gordian be enough: the 3rd century was hardly <b>a</b> <b>stranger</b> <b>to</b> such bloodshed and treachery. Zosimus' hostility begins to makes sense, Shahîd contends, once we assume that {{he was aware of}} the tradition that viewed Philip as the first Christian emperor (and perhaps even accepted it). And it becomes perfectly clear once we understand the importance Zosimus attributes to the Secular Games, and the schematic incongruity he would behold when a Christian emperor was presiding over them.|$|E
500|$|The direct-to-video {{psychological}} thriller Peacock (2010), co-starring Ellen Page, Susan Sarandon and Bill Pullman, starred Murphy as a {{man with}} a split personality who fools people into believing he is also his own wife. Christian Toto of The Washington Times referred to the film as [...] "a handsomely mounted psychological drama with an arresting lead turn by Cillian Murphy", and noted that although Murphy wasn't <b>a</b> <b>stranger</b> <b>to</b> playing in drag, [...] his work in the film set a [...] "new standard for gender-bending performances". Murphy next starred alongside Leonardo DiCaprio, Ellen Page and Joseph Gordon-Levitt in Christopher Nolan's acclaimed blockbuster Inception (2010), playing entrepreneur Robert Fischer, whose mind is infiltrated by DiCaprio's character Cobb to convince him to dissolve his business. David Kyle Johnson noted that it was the [...] "third Nolan film in five years where Cillian Murphy's character spends on-screen time with a cloth bag over his head". Murphy also had uncredited cameo appearance as programmer Edward Dillinger Jr., son of original Tron antagonist Ed Dillinger (David Warner) in , released in December 2010, and the same year he also made a return to theatre in From Galway to Broadway and back again, which was a stage show that celebrated the Druid Theatre Company's 35th birthday.|$|E
