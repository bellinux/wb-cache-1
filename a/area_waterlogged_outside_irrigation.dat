30|$|From 1977 to 1982, {{value of}} {{pressurized}} irrigation has been increased therefore; a minor decreasing is observable for <b>area</b> <b>waterlogged.</b> However, value of area salinized has been increased due to increase of agricultural water withdrawal and consequently {{a part of}} it that is used for irrigation. From 1982 to 1987, localized irrigation has been increased (Pollok et al. 1990) hence; value of <b>area</b> <b>waterlogged</b> has been diminished. Also, percentage of area equipped for irrigation salinized has been increased due to increase of agricultural water withdrawal again. From 1987 to 1992, pressurized irrigation and agricultural water withdrawal have been increased. Hence, percentage of area equipped for irrigation salinized has been increased and <b>area</b> <b>waterlogged</b> has been decreased. From 1992 to 1997, values of surface irrigation (in comparison with pressurized irrigation), <b>area</b> <b>waterlogged,</b> agricultural water withdrawal, and percentage of area equipped for irrigation salinized, have been increased due to lack of appropriate management in the previous years and high costs as well as the dilemmas of these systems (Biswas 1986; Famoriyo 1984; Alam 1991). Note that NRI has been decreased from 1992 to 1997 and this indicates highlighted role of increase of surface irrigation (Houk et al. 2006). From 1997 to 2002, problems occurred in the previous period raised tendency to use of pressurized irrigation systems afresh but with a reasonable approach and competent management (Qadir and Oster 2004). This approach led to increase of pressurized irrigation as well as decrease of <b>area</b> <b>waterlogged</b> by irrigation. From 2002 to 2007, pressurized irrigation was still growing (Kigalu et al. 2008; Karlberg et al. 2007; Kheira 2009 b) and values of <b>area</b> <b>waterlogged</b> by irrigation and percentage of area equipped for irrigation salinized were decreased due to suitable management and decrease of agricultural water withdrawal. From 2007 to 2011, we could see a fall in agricultural water withdrawal (however, this index is allowable to increase if a suitable use), percentage of area equipped for irrigation salinized, and <b>area</b> <b>waterlogged</b> and a growth in spate irrigation that needs to specific attention to deal with sedimentation (Embaye et al. 2012). The good event is raise of localized irrigation and its considerable impact on water conservation (Ward and Pulido-Velazquez 2008). However, value of conservation agriculture area is not desirable yet. In the final step, cropping intensity (area equipped) has been studied for Africa in the previous half of century.|$|R

40|$|Satellite {{remote sensing}} coupled with Geographical Information Systems (GIS) offers an {{excellent}} alternative to conventional mapping techniques in monitoring and mapping of surface and sub-surface <b>waterlogged</b> <b>areas.</b> In the present study, pre-monsoon and post-monsoon surface <b>waterlogged</b> <b>areas</b> were delineated {{in all the}} 132 irrigation command areas of the Bihar State, India using Indian Remote Sensing (IRS- 1 D) Linear Imaging Self Scanning Sensor (LISS-III) data acquired during the period 2002 - 2003. Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI) was used primarily to delineate surface <b>waterlogged</b> <b>areas.</b> Perennial <b>waterlogged</b> and seasonal <b>waterlogged</b> <b>areas</b> were identified for the study area by integrating the <b>waterlogged</b> <b>areas</b> derived for both the pre- and post-monsoon seasons under GIS environment. Results show that the total surface <b>waterlogged</b> <b>area</b> in Bihar is 628 x 10 (3) ha, which is 10. 57 % of command area (5939 x 10 (3) ha) and spread over 132 command areas. Perennial surface inundation covers 2. 95 % of the <b>waterlogged</b> <b>area</b> in all the command <b>areas.</b> Maximum <b>waterlogged</b> <b>area</b> is observed in Gandak command (212 x 10 (3) ha) followed by Eastern Kosi irrigation scheme (116 x 10 (3) ha) and Sone modernization scheme (82 x 10 (3) ha), respectively. Further, <b>waterlogged</b> <b>areas</b> induced by rise in groundwater level were also assessed spatially under GIS environment using the ground water level data pertaining to pre- and post-monsoon seasons of the year 2002 - 2003 which were spread all over the study area. The analysis of pre- and post-monsoon groundwater levels indicates that the area under non-critical category during pre-monsoon period was reduced from 4287 x 10 (3) ha (72. 72 % of command) to 1391 x 10 (3) ha (23. 42 %) in the post-monsoon. Area under most critical category during post-monsoon period increased from 0. 083 x 10 (3) ha of command area in pre-monsoon period to 50 x 10 (3) ha. The study demonstrates utility of integration of remote sensing and GIS techniques for assessment of <b>waterlogged</b> <b>areas</b> particularly in regions where waterlogging conditions occur both due to excessive irrigation and accumulation of rain and floodwaters.

The salinity status of 158 irrigated rice {{fields in the}} Delta was measured with an electromagnetic conductivity meter (EM 38). Double-cropped fields (two rice crops per year on the same field) were least saline (average horizontal EM 38 reading: 0. 6 dS m- 1), followed by single-cropped drained fields (1. 6 dS m- 1), single-cropped non-drained fields (2. 5 dS m- 1), non-cropped sites <b>outside</b> <b>irrigation</b> schemes (4. 7 dS m- 1) and abandoned fields (5. 7 dS m- 1).

30|$|This paper {{examines}} {{land use}} policy and agricultural water management in Africa from 1962 to 2011. For this purpose, data were gathered from Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) and the World Bank Group. Using the FAO database, ten indices were selected: permanent crops to cultivated area (%), rural population to total population (%), total {{economically active population}} in agriculture to total economically active population (%), human development index, national rainfall index (mm/year), value added to gross domestic product by agriculture (%), irrigation water requirement (mm/year), percentage of total cultivated area drained (%), difference between national rainfall index and irrigation water requirement (mm/year), area equipped for irrigation to cultivated area or land use policy index (%). These indices were analyzed for all 53 countries {{in the study area}} and the land use policy index was estimated by two different formulas. The results show that value of relative error is < 20  %. In addition, an average index was calculated using various methods to assess countries’ conditions for agricultural water management. Ability of irrigation and drainage systems was studied using other eight indices with more limited information. These indices are surface irrigation (%), sprinkler irrigation (%), localized irrigation (%), spate irrigation (%), agricultural water withdrawal (10  km 3 /year), conservation agriculture area as percentage of cultivated area (%), percentage of area equipped for irrigation salinized (%), and <b>area</b> <b>waterlogged</b> by irrigation (%). Finally, tendency of farmers to use irrigation systems for cultivated crops has been presented. The results show that Africa needs governments’ policy to encourage farmers to use irrigation systems and raise cropping intensity for irrigated area.|$|R
