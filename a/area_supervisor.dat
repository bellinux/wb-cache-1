40|$|<b>Area</b> of {{specialization}} <b>supervisors</b> dynamically configure {{a set of}} air traffic control re-sources so that air traffic in the area can operate safely and efficiently. These resources include airspace sectors, air traffic control positions staffed by controllers, and physical air traffic control equipment. In this paper, we motivate and demonstrate an approach for finding multiple advisories that can assist <b>area</b> <b>supervisors</b> as they accomplish this task. The first motivating factor is that a preference for multiple good and also distinct advisories has been documented in similar contexts, including some air traffic management problems. The second factor that motivates our approach is that the model, problem statement, and algorithm used to generate a single advisory are incomplete and do not perfectly represent reality. The third factor, which we speculate is primarily {{a result of the}} second factor, is that <b>area</b> <b>supervisors</b> have indicated a preference for multiple (usually two or three) advi-sories over a single advisory. <b>Area</b> <b>supervisors</b> have further indicated that each proposed advisory should be different from the other proposed advisories. We investigate the set of advisories that perform best according to a particular objective function for some realistic problem instances. The best few advisories are typically not meaningfully different and therefore should not be presented together to supervisors, and this is the fourth and final factor that motivates our approach. Based on these motivating factors, we define a problem statement which requests multiple good advisories that are all sufficiently different from each other. We briefly describe a heuristic algorithm that was developed for this prob-lem. To more concretely illustrate and motivate the proposed approach, we present the advisories provided by this algorithm for a sample problem instance. We also demonstrate that the proposed heuristic can find feasible second advisories for as many realistic problem instances (15 of 18) as a nearly-exhaustive search. When executed on a desktop workstation computer, the proposed heuristic returns advisories for these realistic problem instances in less than one second per problem instance...|$|R

The development of OASIS is a major activity of the Dynamic Airspace Configuration (DAC) research focus area within the Aeronautics Research Mission Directorate (ARMD) Airspace Systems Program. OASIS is an advisory tool to assist Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) En Route <b>Area</b> <b>Supervisors</b> in their planning of sector combinedecombine operations as well as opening closing of Data-side (D-side) control positions. These advisory solutions are tailored to the predicted traffic demand over the next few hours. During the experiment, eight retired FAA personnel served as participants for a part-task evaluation of OASIS functionality, covering the user interface as well as the underlying algorithm. Participants gave positive feedback on both the user interface and the algorithm solutions for airspace configuration, including an excellent average rating of 94 on the tool usability scales. They also suggested various enhancements to the OASIS tool, which will be incorporated into the next tool development cycle for the full-scale human-in-the-loop evaluation to be conducted later this year...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{discusses}} a {{suite of}} multi sector planning tools for trajectory-based operations that were developed and evaluated in the Airspace Operations Laboratory (AOL) at the NASA Ames Research Center. The toolset included tools for traffic load and complexity assessment as well as trajectory planning and coordination. The situation assessment tools included an integrated suite of interactive traffic displays, load tables, load graphs, and dynamic aircraft filters. The planning toolset allowed for single and multi aircraft trajectory planning and data communication-based coordination of trajectories between operators. Also newly introduced was a real-time computation of sector complexity into the toolset that operators could use in lieu of aircraft count to better estimate and manage sector workload, especially in situations with convective weather. The tools were used during a joint NASA/FAA multi sector planner simulation in the AOL in 2009 that had multiple objectives with {{the assessment of the}} effectiveness of the tools being one of them. Current air traffic control operators who were experienced as <b>area</b> <b>supervisors</b> and traffic management coordinators used the tools throughout the simulation and provided their usefulness and usability ratings in post simulation questionnaires.
