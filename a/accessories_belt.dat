50|$|Designated EGA, the 3.3 {{was built}} at Trenton Engine in Trenton, Michigan. It uses SFI fuel injection, has roller tappets and {{features}} forged steel connecting rods, a one-piece cast camshaft, and either a cast aluminum or reinforced plastic intake manifold. The 3.3 has a timing chain, {{and is an}} interference engine meaning that the valves will collide with the pistons {{in the event of}} a timing chain failure. Unlike the 3.5 on which the water pump is driven by the timing belt, on the 3.3, the <b>accessory</b> <b>belt</b> drives the water pump.|$|R

The larger engine displacement allows for increased torque, reducing engine speeds (RPM), which improves fuel economy at highway speeds. Thanks to its electric water pump, the Prius engine is the first consumer automotive production engine that requires no <b>accessory</b> <b>belts,</b> which also further improves its fuel economy. The electric motors and other components of the hybrid powertrain are also smaller and more efficient than the industry average. Toyota estimates the new inverter, motor and transaxle are 20 percent lighter.|$|R
50|$|This {{model is}} the first of the WRX line to deviate from the EJ-series engine. It uses the new 2.0-liter FA20F engine, which has direct {{injection}} and a twin-scroll turbocharger. On all previous WRXs the turbocharger was located near the right-hand side of the firewall, close to the third cylinder. With the new FA20F, Subaru fitted the turbocharger {{at the front of the}} car, close to the serpentine <b>accessory</b> <b>belts.</b> There is a robust aluminum skid plate that protects the underside of the turbocharger. Mounting the turbo lower in the engine bay helps reduce the car's center of gravity to 19.5 in.|$|R

5000|$|This [...] {{engine was}} {{a version of}} the 3.3 but with a larger bore of 96 mm and the {{important}} addition of overhead cams. The 3.5L version has an intake arrangement with two separate manifolds and throttle bodies connected with a crossover valve. This provides better low and midrange torque. The four valves per cylinder are driven by a single overhead camshaft as opposed to the conventional DOHC arrangement for multivalve engines. Another difference with the 3.5 as opposed to the 3.3 is that it has a timing belt, not a timing chain. The water pump is also driven by the timing belt on the 3.5, whereas on the 3.3, the <b>accessory</b> <b>belt</b> drives it.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Automatic belt {{tensioner}} for stabilization of Engine <b>accessory</b> <b>belt</b> system is made increase its life, decrease {{noise and vibration}} and increase its commercial value. Therefore, it is important finding test mode to assess life of automatic {{belt tensioner}}. However, measurement and analysis test result in practical test condition on real road needs requiring much test time and finance. In this study, there is analyzed and established test mode which is loaded measured equivalent damage in real working condition, compared test condition of pre-established test mode and FTP- 75 mode of fuel efficiency test and verified {{advantages and disadvantages of}} each mode. Because FTP- 75 Mode is for measuring fuel efficiency related with engine, applying FTP- 75 mode is estimated suitability for test of engine accessory. Comparison and assessment of damage is investigated structure and pulley part. Equivalent damage is calculated with Palmgren-Miner Rule and representative stress method, test condition of automatic belt tensioner is investigated. This investigation is regarded as being useful to life evaluation of both automatic belt tensioner and other engine accessory component...|$|R

50|$|Engine {{timing was}} {{controlled}} by the all-steel, silent Morse timing chain (some early production engines had double-row roller timing sets), which was located beneath the aluminum timing cover {{at the front of}} the engine block. The timing chain sprockets, one each for the camshaft and crankshaft, were all-steel; for the last few years the LA engine came with nylon teeth on the sprockets. At the rear of the camshaft was cut a set of helical gear teeth, these being used to spin the distributor. Mounted to the front of the timing cover was a new-design counter-clockwise-rotation water pump, with much improved flow. Externally, the <b>accessory</b> drive <b>belt</b> was changed to a serpentine system; coupled with an automatic belt tensioner this increased belt life, reduced maintenance and contributed to lower noise and vibration levels.|$|R
50|$|In 2003 Louise {{started to}} {{collaborate}} with the St. Barth's based French designer Donale.

40|$|This {{study is}} {{motivated}} by issues in belt dynamics and paper forming where the oscillatory motion of the contact point between the belt and pulley or the web and roll is important. The objective is to evaluate {{the influence of the}} nonlinear contact boundary conditions on the dynamics of the belt or web. To accomplish this objective, two models are analyzed using perturbation methods. The first model represents a string on an elastic foundation (an approximation of the paper forming process) and the second model represents a tensioned beam (<b>accessory</b> drive <b>belt).</b> The first correction to the fundamental natural frequency and the dynamic belt/web length are determined {{as a function of the}} governing parameters. For both models, the change in belt length is found to be proportional to the radius of the pulley/roll and the initial belt/web energy...|$|R

50|$|By {{the end of}} the period, {{the types}} of {{personal}} jewellery worn by wealthy women were not very different from those found today, with rings, necklaces, brooches, lockets and (less often) earrings all popular. But <b>accessories</b> such as <b>belts</b> and purses, as well as other personal possessions such as combs and book-covers might also be jewelled in a way rarely found today. Poorer women wore smaller quantities of similar styles of personal jewellery in cheaper materials, as today. Wealthy men wore far more jewellery than today, often including large chain collars, and a cap badge, which might be very extravagant.|$|R
50|$|Mechanical {{fans are}} {{most common in}} trucks and SUVs, and some RWD cars. This is easier to {{accomplish}} because the engine is mounted longitudinally, with the <b>belt</b> <b>accessory</b> components mounted facing the radiator. The fan is mounted on the crankshaft pulley {{or one of the}} accessory pulleys (e.g. the water pump pulley) and will spin in between the radiator and the engine, drawing air back through the radiator and blowing it over the engine. Even though the air has been heated by passing through the radiator, it is still much less hot than the engine surface, so the airflow over the engine helps with cooling.|$|R
50|$|The International Federation for Equestrian Sports (FEI) regulates dress {{codes for}} {{competitive}} vaulting. Every 2-3 years, new guidelines are released, which consistently declare that vaulters must wear form-fitting uniforms {{that do not}} conceal the line and form of the vaulter's body, as well as not hinder {{the movement of the}} vaulter or the safe interaction between the vaulters. For that reason, <b>accessories</b> such as <b>belts,</b> capes or hats are prohibited. Additionally, men‚Äôs trousers must be secured at the ankle. It is expected that clothing be appropriate for the competition and does not give the effect of nudity. The most common form-fitting uniforms worn by vaulters are unitards.|$|R
50|$|During the 'Tanzimat' and 'Me≈ürutiyet' {{period in}} the 19th century, the common people still keeping to their {{traditional}} clothing styles presented a great contrast with the administrators and the wealthy wearing 'redingot', jacket, waistcoat, boyunbaƒüƒ± (tie), 'mintan', sharp-pointed and high-heeled shoes.Women's clothes of the Ottoman period were observed in the 'mansions' and Palace courts. 'Entari', 'ku≈üak', '≈üalvar', 'ba≈ü√∂rt√º', 'ferace' of the 19th century continued their existence without much change. In the 16th century women wore two-layer long 'entari' and 't√ºl', velvet shawl on their heads. Their outdoor clothing consisted of 'ferace' and 'yeldirme'.

40|$|In {{terms of}} street fashion, stylish {{young people in}} Tokyo use more <b>accessories</b> (such as <b>belts,</b> necklaces, and hats/caps) than those in Kumamoto to {{coordinate}} with their clothing, while those in Kumamoto tend to use a fashion technique called "the layered look" or combinations of independent items (such as a blouse and a shirt) more often than those in Tokyo. Factor analysis of a questionnaire on the secret of how to look fashionable extracted four factors: make-up and physique, sense of luxury and trends, love and money, and overall atmosphere. The results also showed that fashion elements that enhance one 2 ÃÜ 7 s appearance are accessories, hairstyle, make-up, physique, and color coordination...|$|R
