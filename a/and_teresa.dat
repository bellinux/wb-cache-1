5|$|Following his {{military}} service, Jose Sarria returned to San Francisco. He enrolled in college with plans {{of becoming a}} teacher. He and his sister Teresa began frequenting the Black Cat Bar, a center of the city's Beat and bohemian scene. Sarria <b>and</b> <b>Teresa</b> both became smitten with a waiter named Jimmy Moore and bet as to which of them could get him into bed first. José won the bet and soon Moore and he were lovers. Sarria began covering for Moore when {{he was unable to}} work and soon Black Cat owner Sol Stoumen hired him as a cocktail waiter.|$|E
5|$|Later, Tom is {{dropped off}} in a field somewhere. There, he discovers that other people were held captive on the {{spaceship}} as well. A Mech kills everyone, except for Tom, presumably to tell others about what he witnessed. He begins a pilgrimage back to Boston. On his way, he finds a girl, Teresa (Laine MacNeil) being mugged. Tom helps her. Teresa’s mother was murdered and Tom <b>and</b> <b>Teresa</b> bury her. They leave together on Teresa’s motorcycle. Later, they hear Mech fire and people. Teresa decides to leave {{and go to the}} mountains. Tom stays to find other survivors. There, he finds a Skitter. While attempting to kill it, Tom is shot by his son, Ben.|$|E

50|$|After the divorce, Teresa {{begins a}} {{relationship}} with Chris; but one night, as they are driving home, they are pulled over by a car that they think is the police; but it was Paul, posing {{as a police officer}} <b>and</b> stalking <b>Teresa.</b> Paul then shoots Chris <b>and</b> kidnaps <b>Teresa.</b> Paul holds Teresa hostage until the next day, when she manages to escape from him at a diner and hurries to a nearby establishment, where she calls 9-1-1. The police then catch Paul, who attempted to escape on a bus, <b>and</b> arrest him. <b>Teresa</b> is then returned home to her mother <b>and</b> daughter. <b>Teresa's</b> boyfriend Chris survived the shooting.|$|R
5|$|Tadeusz Rejtan {{was born}} on 20 August 1742 in Hruszówka (now, Hrushauka, Belarus) (date as given in the Polish Biographical Dictionary, some other sources give other dates). He {{was the son of}} a minor, but {{relatively}} wealthy noble, Dominik Rejtan, podkomorzy of Nowogródek (today Navahrudak, Belarus) <b>and</b> <b>Teresa</b> Wołodkowicz. He was likely the oldest of five brothers. His brother, Michał, would come to hold the position of pisarz (scribe) of Nowogródek. His grandfather, also named Michał, was the skarbnik (treasurer) of Mazyr. The family had been aligned to the powerful Radziwiłł family, and Tadeusz would also pledge his allegiance to them.|$|E
5|$|However, {{the policy}} of the Christian {{authorities}} was generally to block such emigration. Consequently, this option was only practically doable for the wealthiest among those living near the southern coast, and even then with great difficulty. For example, in Sierra Bermeja, Granada in 1501, an option of exile was offered as an alternative to conversion only for those who paid a fee of ten gold doblas, which most citizens could not afford. In the same year, villagers of Turre <b>and</b> <b>Teresa</b> near Sierra Cabrera in Almeria fought the Christian militias with help from their North African rescuers at Mojácar while leaving the region. The people of Turre were defeated and the planned escape turned into a massacre; the people of Teresa got away but their properties, except what could fit into their small boats, were left behind and confiscated.|$|E
5|$|In February 2007, during {{pre-production}} for The Dark Knight, Warner Bros. hired {{husband and}} wife screenwriting duo Michelle and Kieran Mulroney to script a Justice League film featuring a younger Batman in a separate franchise. George Miller was hired to direct the following September, with Armie Hammer cast as Batman a month later <b>and</b> <b>Teresa</b> Palmer as Talia al Ghul. Filming had nearly commenced at Fox Studios Australia in Sydney, but was pushed back over the Writer's Guild of America strike, and once more when the Australian Film Commission denied Warner Bros. a 45 percent tax rebate over lack of Australian actors in the film. Production offices were moved to Vancouver Film Studios in Canada for an expected July 2008 start and a planned summer 2009 theatrical release date, but Warner Bros. ultimately canceled Justice League following the success of The Dark Knight. Hammer's option on his contract lapsed and the studio was more willing to proceed with Christopher Nolan to finish his trilogy separately with The Dark Knight Rises.|$|E

5|$|Moonlight is a 2016 American drama film {{directed}} by Barry Jenkins. It is {{an adaptation of}} Tarell Alvin McCraney's play In Moonlight Black Boys Look Blue. Produced by Dede Gardner, Jeremy Kleiner, and Adele Romanski, it focuses {{on the life of}} Chiron, an African-American homosexual man struggling with his sexuality and identity while growing up in Miami, Florida. Moonlight stars Trevante Rhodes as Adult Chiron and André Holland as Adult Kevin, Chiron's closest friend. Naomie Harris, Mahershala Ali, and Janelle Monáe feature in supporting roles as Paula (Chiron's mother who suffers with drug addiction), Juan (a drug dealer), <b>and</b> <b>Teresa</b> (Juan's girlfriend) respectively. Moonlight premiered at the Telluride Film Festival on September 2, 2016. A24 provided the film an initial limited release on October 21 before expanding to a wide release on November 18 at more than 600 theaters.

5|$|The {{marriage}} between PedroII <b>and</b> <b>Teresa</b> Cristina started off badly. With maturity, patience and their first child, Afonso, their relationship improved. Later Teresa Cristina {{gave birth to}} more children: Isabel, in 1846; Leopoldina, in 1847; and lastly, Pedro, in 1848. However, both boys died when very young, which devastated the Emperor. Beyond suffering as a father, {{his view of the}} Empire's future changed completely. Despite his affection for his daughters, he did not believe that Princess Isabel, although his heir, would have any chance of prospering on the throne. He felt his successor needed to be male for the monarchy to be viable. He increasingly saw the imperial system as being tied so inextricably to himself, that it would not survive him. Isabel and her sister received a remarkable education, although they were given no preparation for governing the nation. PedroII excluded Isabel from participation in government business and decisions.|$|E
5|$|The script of {{the film}} went through several changes during filming. Due to the length {{of the film}}, scenes from a side-story {{involving}} the relationship between the character Tequila <b>and</b> <b>Teresa</b> Chang were cut. Another cut scene included Tequila playing clarinet over Benny's grave. With these cuts, Chow Yun-Fat felt his character was not very deep in comparison to Leung's character of Alan. To develop his character more, Chow asked John Woo to insert a mentor character in the film, which Woo himself would play. Chow felt that having Woo in this role would make Woo not cut out these scenes. Philip Kwok's role of Mad Dog was not in the script and was created on the set. Kwok first worked with Woo on his film Once a Thief and was asked to return to work on Hard Boiled. After reading the script, Woo felt that the character of Johnny Wong was not a strong enough physical threat. After seeing Kwok do several of the stunts while filming, Woo created the character of Mad Dog for him.|$|E
