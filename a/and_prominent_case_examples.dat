40|$|This article {{addresses}} {{some social}} and management {{issues relating to}} the subject of drugs in sport (doping). It begins with an overview of recent <b>and</b> <b>prominent</b> <b>cases</b> before developing a comparative approach that sets doping against other forms of drug use in society. The outcomes and implications of this comparison establish the basis for a discussion of how doping might be dealt with by the relevant authorities. The concluding points show that interventions towards education and prevention face the challenges of understanding and responding to the highly specific nature of the elite athlete...|$|R

5|$|The {{profile of}} the sport reached a new high in the 1980s, {{with a number of}} athletes {{becoming}} household names (such as Carl Lewis, Sergey Bubka, Sebastian Coe, Zola Budd and Florence Griffith-Joyner). Many world records were broken in this period, and the added political element between competitors of the United States, East Germany, and the Soviet Union, in reaction to the Cold War, only served to stoke the sport's popularity. The increase in the commercial capacity of track and field was also met with developments in the application of sports science, and there were many changes to coaching methods, athlete's diet regimes, training facilities and sports equipment. This was also accompanied by an increase in the use of performance-enhancing drugs, <b>and</b> <b>prominent</b> <b>cases,</b> such as those of Olympic gold medallists Ben Johnson and Marion Jones, damaged the public image and marketability of the sport.|$|R
40|$|In the Information Society an {{individual}} may {{take on an}} identity for each electronic service with {{which he or she}} engages. As a consequence, {{an individual}} may accumulate a vast array of personal identifiers for such 'services' and is also likely to accrue a range of physical representations of such multiple identification: credit card, debit card, driving licence, passport, library card, parking permit etc. Hence, multiple identity management is a significant issue for individuals and organisations. In this paper we unpack this issue in terms of a semiotic framework consisting of three interrelated processes - authentication, identification and enrolment. These processes serve to locate the three elements of the person, identifiers and identity that help define the socio-technical network which comprises the issue of personal identity in the Information Age. We test the explanatory utility of this framework against a contemporary <b>and</b> <b>prominent</b> <b>case</b> from the UK - an attempt by the government to introduce a national identity card. Such an identity token offers numerous potential benefits for individuals and organisations but raises major challenges to data protection, data privacy and public trust in the information governance of the UK...|$|R
40|$|In April 2014, news of long delays at the Phoenix VA Medical Center and the {{subsequent}} deaths of forty Veterans awaiting medical appointments shocked the nation. Based on this perceived failure among VA’s senior medical staff, legislation swept through the House and the Senate {{in an attempt to}} enhance accountability at the VA. By August 2014, President Obama signed the Veterans Access, Choice and Accountability Act of 2014 into law. This Act revises the termination procedures concerning the VA’s senior executives, by eliminating the notice requirement, significantly reducing the appellate procedures for adverse employment decision to the Merit Systems Protection Board, and nearly eliminating the role of the MSPB’s three-member Board in reviewing a final ALJ determination. As such, the Act raises procedural Due Process concerns. This Comment analyzes Section 707 of the Act in light of the Due Process Clause, pertinent legislative history, <b>and</b> <b>prominent</b> <b>case</b> law addressing the procedural due process framework. By balancing the interests at stake via the Mathews v. Eldridge test, this Comment argues that the Act’s provisions violate the due process rights of VA’s senior executives, and advocates for a more internal reform approach, centered on revising the agency’s performance appraisal procedures to enhance accountability...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. In this paper, we {{reviewed}} several outstanding contributions {{over the past}} decade in the field of augmented reality.

In addition, considering that augmented reality covers several topics, and it has intersection with pervasive computing and wearable computing in concept, only the promising technologies <b>and</b> some <b>prominent</b> <b>cases</b> are concerned. In our opinion, a typical AR application is a solution for special application scenarios, and in most cases a comprehensive system is needed. For simplicity, we divided the technologies adopted in AR application into three categories: acquiring the data of environment, registering the virtual object in real environment and presenting the composite data. At the end of the paper, we discussed the remained problems and future development trend of augmented reality...|$|R
50|$|Norwegian {{black metal}} {{has been an}} {{influence}} in world music since the late 20th century. Since the 1990s, Norway's export of black metal, a lo-fi, dark and raw form of heavy metal, has been developed by such bands as Emperor, Darkthrone, Gorgoroth, Mayhem, Burzum, and Immortal. More recently bands such as Enslaved, Kvelertak, Dimmu Borgir and Satyricon have evolved the genre into the present day while still garnering worldwide fans. Controversial events associated with the black metal movement in the early 1990s included several church burnings <b>and</b> two <b>prominent</b> murder <b>cases.</b>|$|R
40|$|Theories of {{bundling}} {{have had}} great importance in European competition policy in recent merger control {{and abuse of}} dominance <b>cases.</b> <b>Prominent</b> <b>examples</b> include GE/Honeywell, Tetra Laval/Sidel and the recent Microsoft decision. The European Commission has been heavily criticized in all of those cases. In this Paper we attempt to sketch how a systematic approach to bundling cases can be structured. We first {{provide an overview of}} existing bundling theories, concentrating on robust economic mechanisms and their empirical implications. This allows us to develop a number of clear criteria to identify potentially anticompetitive bundling. We show that a careful reading undermines recently proposed arguments for a (modified) per se legality rule for bundling. bundling; efficiency defenses; foreclosure; policy rules...|$|R

30|$|The TRIPS Agreement {{includes}} {{specific rules}} on compulsory licensing, parallel importation {{and the application}} of patent law. For instance, Article 30 allows governments to make limited exceptions to patent rights provided certain conditions are met. The Agreement goes on to recognize that such exceptions must not “unreasonably” conflict with the “normal” exploitation of the patent and must not unreasonably prejudice the legitimate interests of the patent owner, while taking the legitimate interest of third parties into account. Article 31 of the Agreement allows developed and developing countries to provide for compulsory licensing in their national legislation and does not limit the reasons for which governments may grant compulsory licences. Having said this, governments’ use of a patent without the authorization of the right holder can only be done only under a number of conditions that protect the legitimate interests of patent holders. There have, however, been instances when generic producers and originator companies in developed and developing countries have disagreed on issues of patent linkage and/or the extent of data protection. A <b>prominent</b> <b>case</b> law <b>example</b> extraterritorial application of national laws under TRIPS is European Union-Seizure of Generic Drugs in Transit (WT/DS 408, May 2011). Yet another Article 30 interpretation is in case law Canada-Pharmaceuticals (WTO/DS 114) that allows countries to allow manufacturers of generic drugs to use the patented invention, without the patent owner’s permission and before the patent protection expires, for the purpose of obtaining marketing approval from public health authorities.|$|R
5|$|Engin Raghip's {{solicitor}} was now Gareth Peirce– who had {{represented the}} Guildford Four <b>and</b> Birmingham Six, <b>prominent</b> <b>cases</b> of miscarriage of justice– and his barrister Michael Mansfield. Peirce applied for leave to appeal. She began to explore Raghip's mental state, arguing that his confession {{could not be}} relied upon, and arranged {{for him to be}} examined by Dr. Gísli Guðjónsson of the Institute of Psychiatry in London, a specialist in suggestibility; Guðjónsson concluded that Raghip was unusually suggestible, with a mental age of between 10 and 11. Silcott was again represented by Barbara Mills and Braithwaite by Steven Kamlish. Mills noted the lack of photographic or scientific evidence, and argued that Silcott would have been unlikely to stop firefighters from extinguishing a fire {{on the deck of the}} Tangmere block, given that he was renting a shop there.|$|R

He put his case in a way not calculated to offend on all sides, but still risking having that effect. He dealt with stereotypes, attempting to sift those that were artefacts of the institution of slavery from those that represented human variability and {{could be attributed to}} God. [...] Along with James Forten and William Watkins, Easton queried the [...] "immediatist" [...] assumptions common in white abolitionists. He stated that emancipated slaves would not be capable of self-improvement without help. His message was not what abolitionists, whether black <b>and</b> in many <b>prominent</b> <b>cases</b> escaped slaves, or white, much wanted to hear, and his reputation accordingly suffered. He is now seen as an early Afrocentrist writer, arguing for the cultural inheritance of Ancient Greece from Ancient Egypt. He used the scriptural ethnology of Hamitic and Japhetic lineages to argue for the cultural importance of Africa in the ancient Mediterranean world.|$|R

Allegations of vast impropriety surrounded the deal, and citizens began to question the veracity and legitimacy of Peña Nieto’s government. Moreover, when an investigation into these allegations was launched, Public Function Ministry head Virgilio Andrade - a close personal friend of President Peña Nieto - was put in charge, and many Mexicans cited the investigation as {{a conflict of interest}} in which [...] "the executive branch investigated itself." ...|$|R

40|$|The {{widespread}} {{adoption of}} Learning Analytics (LA) and Educational Data Mining (EDM) has somewhat stagnated recently, <b>and</b> in some <b>prominent</b> <b>cases</b> even been reversed following concerns by governments, stakeholders {{and civil rights}} groups. In this ongoing discussion, fears and realities are often indistinguishably mixed up, leading to an atmosphere of uncertainty among potential beneficiaries of Learning Analytics, as well as hesitations among institutional managers who aim to innovate their institution’s learning support by implementing data and analytics with a view on improving student success. In this paper, {{we try to get}} {{to the heart of the}} matter, by analysing the most common views and the propositions made by the LA community to solve them. We conclude the paper with an eight-point checklist named DELICATE that can be applied by teachers, researchers, policy makers and institutional managers to facilitate a trusted implementation of Learning Analytics. The efforts of Hendrik Drachsler have been partly funded by the EU FP 7 LACE-project. eu (grant number 619424).

40|$|Government {{contracting}} {{has experienced}} {{an explosion of}} available data in the last decade, marked {{by the rise of}} the global Open Contracting Data Standard.
