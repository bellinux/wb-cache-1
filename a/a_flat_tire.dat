The team also nearly won the team time trial at the 2002 Tour de France, thwarted by <b>a</b> <b>flat</b> <b>tire.</b> Jalabert again won the King of the Mountains and {{repeated}} his victory at the Clásica de San Sebastián. He retired {{at the end of}} the season.|$|E

25|$|I {{can tell}} how old I {{was because of}} where we lived - you know we moved all the time - and when I was just about two years old, I {{was walking down the}} street and having {{a hell of a lot}} of trouble because my {{shoelaces}} were untied and had come out of the holes, and every time I'd take a step I would step on one of those strings and stumble. And, you know, it was a major problem. <b>A</b> <b>flat</b> <b>tire's</b> nothing compared to that. And everybody who would pass would laugh and think it was so funny you know, me stumbling along.|$|R
5|$|The {{victory was}} the first in Vickers' career. After the race, Jeff Burton {{maintained}} his Drivers' Championship points lead, although that lead decreased significantly because he had <b>a</b> <b>flat</b> <b>tire</b> during the final laps of the race. Chevrolet maintained its lead in the Manufacturers' Championship, 51 points ahead of Dodge and 52 ahead of Ford with six races remaining in the season.|$|E

Il Matto complains that his watch is broken, then collapses and dies. Zampanò hides the body and pushes the car off the road where it bursts into flames.|$|E
5|$|At the mall, Michael {{opens to}} the women about his {{discomfort}} with Jan. Among other things, he tells them Jan has been videotaping them having sex and watching it with him afterwards. All the women assure Michael that Jan's behavior is not normal and urge {{him to get out}} of the relationship. He remains conflicted about what he should do about Jan, but at Phyllis's prompting he finally admits to himself that he wants to break up with her. Michael thanks them for their help by treating them to one item each at Victoria's Secret. On the drive back, Pam takes a step toward asserting herself by changing <b>a</b> <b>flat</b> <b>tire</b> on Meredith Palmer's (Kate Flannery) car.

Greece would eventually finish 17 seconds behind the next to last finisher.|$|R
50|$|The race {{restarted}} on lap 61. Harvick passed Kenseth {{going up}} turn 2 {{to take the}} lead. Martin Truex, Jr. {{got out of the}} groove in turn 11 and made an unscheduled stop with 22 laps to go. The culprit was <b>a</b> <b>flat</b> left-front <b>tire.</b>|$|R
50|$|A {{disadvantage}} is {{that many}} run-flat tires cannot be repaired if a puncture occurs. This is due to manufacturer's informing the automotive industry that the state in which the sidewall is in cannot be determined due to the compacted sidewall of rubber. Some brands may permit one repair to <b>a</b> run <b>flat</b> <b>tire,</b> while others do not allow any.|$|R
5|$|Johnson {{retained}} his {{pole position}} lead {{into the first}} corner, with Speed behind him. Two laps later, Harvick had moved into fourth position; Jamie McMurray, who began the race in eleventh, had moved up four positions to seventh place.

One lap later, Ambrose passed Johnson to become the new race leader. On lap 13, Johnson retook the lead off Ambrose. After having made three positions early, Harvick moved up into second position by passing Ambrose. On lap 16, Ambrose's car suffered <b>a</b> <b>flat</b> <b>tire</b> and came into the pit road.|$|E
5|$|On lap 206, Martin's car {{suffered}} <b>a</b> <b>flat</b> <b>tire</b> and {{the fourth}} caution was given as a result.

Matt Kenseth got sideways after suffering <b>a</b> <b>flat</b> left-front <b>tire</b> exiting 2 {{and was able to}} save it. Tony Stewart, trying to avoid Kenseth, got turned by Brett Moffitt into the wall.|$|R
25|$|Kenseth won the Diamond Hill Plywood 200 at Darlington Raceway in 2009. Kenseth led {{only the}} last four laps of the race– three of them under caution– after Busch had to pull into the pits due to <b>a</b> <b>flat</b> right-rear <b>tire</b> during the {{penultimate}} caution period {{and just as the}} race was about to get into a green-white-checkered finish.|$|R
5|$|Darcus Allen, {{a convicted}} murderer who {{previously}} served in an Arkansas prison with Clemmons, was allegedly {{present for the}} conversation. Also on Thanksgiving, Clemmons cut off a GPS monitor which Jail Sucks Bail Bonds had secured onto his ankle. On November 28, Clemmons showed two handguns to friends Eddie and Douglas Davis and told them he planned to shoot police officers with them; the exchange was witnessed by Clemmons' half-brother Rickey Hinton, with whom he shared a house. During the exchange, Clemmons danced around with the guns in his hands, claiming to be Lucifer. He told the men he had twice tried {{to go to a}} Tacoma police station, where he planned to walk in and start shooting. The first time the station was closed, and the second time he got <b>a</b> <b>flat</b> <b>tire</b> on the way there, Clemmons claimed. He talked about stopping at a crowded intersection or a school and shooting people there.|$|E
5|$|Kyle Busch {{moved up}} to fourth after passing Allmendinger on lap 54. After 55 laps, Stewart had {{moved up to}} eighth while Johnson had moved up to 12th. Three laps later, the second caution was given, after Keselowski {{developed}} <b>a</b> <b>flat</b> <b>tire</b> and crashed into the wall. All the front-runners made pit stops during the caution, with most asking for tires and adjustments. At the lap 65 restart, Edwards remained the leader before Hamlin moved past him on the following lap. On the 67th lap, Kurt Busch passed Edwards, moving him down to third. During lap 69, Kenseth passed Busch to move to fifth. Two laps later, Johnson was scored ninth, while Harvick was 12th. Afterward, Kyle Busch fell to the eighth position by the 73rd lap.

5|$|The race resumed on lap 39; after Earnhardt {{took the}} lead for one lap at lap 44 Jarrett assumed the lead and held it for the next 37 laps, until pit stops shuffled the field and saw Earnhardt, Jeff Gordon, and Bobby Labonte {{swapping}} the lead among themselves. Jimmy Spencer and Jeremy Mayfield each also led a single lap during the long green-flag period that ended on lap 107 when Dan Pardus hit the wall in turn two. Gordon had been leading {{at the time of}} the caution; he lost the lead to rookie Kenny Irwin, Jr. during pit stops, and Irwin retained the lead after the resumption of racing on lap 110, leading 15 laps in total until being passed by Gordon on lap 123 on account of having <b>a</b> <b>flat</b> <b>tire,</b> just before the caution came out once again for a rain shower.|$|E
50|$|A {{full chain}} guard also keeps {{the drive train}} (chain and {{external}} gears) clean and efficient by excluding water, mud, and grit which could splash onto the chain and front chainring, increase wear, and reduce drivetrain efficiency. To repair <b>a</b> rear <b>flat</b> <b>tire,</b> <b>a</b> fully enclosed chain guard must be partially disassembled to remove the back wheel, or the tire must be repaired in-place without removing the wheel.|$|R
50|$|Kenseth won the Diamond Hill Plywood 200 at Darlington Raceway in 2009. Kenseth led {{only the}} last four laps of the race - three of them under caution - after Busch had to pull into the pits due to <b>a</b> <b>flat</b> right-rear <b>tire</b> during the {{penultimate}} caution period {{and just as the}} race was about to get into a green-white-checkered finish.|$|R
50|$|The seventh caution flew with 69 laps {{to go when}} Michael Annett was slowing with <b>a</b> <b>flat</b> left-rear <b>tire.</b> Brad Keselowski {{stayed out}} when the leaders pitted and assumed the lead.

5|$|Suffering {{withdrawal}} syndrome from {{the lack of}} cable, Peter straps a television-sized cardboard cutout to himself, making it appear as though his whole world is actually a television programme. When Meg can no longer deal with the public scorn, she reveals that her father is really responsible for Quahog's loss of television, causing the town to turn against him. In an attempt to save Peter from further scorn and verbal attacks, Lois gives a heartfelt speech to the community about how television has kept them all from enjoying one another. Inspired by the speech, Peter drags the family to one outdoor activity after another, which quickly exhausts them. Once the family can no longer keep up with him, Peter decides to go off with William Shatner, who has appeared on the Griffin family doorstep after experiencing <b>a</b> <b>flat</b> <b>tire,</b> to a nearby festival.

40|$|The Butte City Fire {{occurred}} on July 1, 1994, west of Idaho Falls, ID. Ignited from <b>a</b> burning <b>flat</b> <b>tire,</b> the blaze {{was driven by}} high winds that caused it to cover over 20, 500 acres in just over 6. 5 hours. Sagebrush (Artemisia tridentata ssp. wyomingensis) is the principal shrub species of this high dese~t rangeland. With the absence of vegetation after the fire, erosion increased tremendously. Because the fire {{occurred on}} the Idaho National Engineering Laboratory, researchers were able to gather weather information from remote meteorological stations positioned on and around the site...|$|R
25|$|In 2010, he rebounded but he {{had still}} not won a race, though he made the Chase and {{finished}} second in both Dover races. He nearly won the fall Martinsville but <b>a</b> <b>flat</b> <b>tire</b> with 15 laps to go gave Denny Hamlin the win. A couple weeks later he and Jeff Gordon got into a wreck long after the caution was out. Burton walked up the track to confront Gordon and the two got into a shoving match. Burton finished 12th in the final standings. Afterwards, Burton assumed responsibility for the incident, stating he was attempting {{to catch up to}} Gordon, but was unable to see in the sunlight's glare.|$|E
25|$|At Texas, Harvick battled Johnson for the win {{numerous}} {{times during the}} race, {{but was unable to}} catch him as he narrowly beat Dale Earnhardt, Jr. to the line, resulting in another second-place finish. He led 63 laps in the Quicken Loans 400 at Michigan, but suffered <b>a</b> <b>flat</b> <b>tire.</b> Trying to recover, Harvick's day was cut short due to the race being called on lap 138 out of the 200 scheduled, due to torrential rain.

50|$|Harvick gave up {{the lead}} to pit on lap 121 {{and handed it to}} Dale Earnhardt Jr. He pitted the next lap and it went to Kenseth. He pitted the next lap and handed it to Keselowski. Harvick stopped a second time for <b>a</b> <b>flat</b> right-front <b>tire.</b> Debris in turn 3 brought out the fourth caution of the race on lap 125. That debris came from Harvick's car. Edwards opted not to pit and assumed the lead with rain just three miles out. The gamble failed and he pitted before the restart.|$|R
50|$|The race {{restarted}} on lap 36. After 26 laps, Keselowski, who restarted in eleventh, {{drove his}} way up to second. Denny Hamlin was running eighth when he made an unscheduled stop on lap 72. The reason for this was <b>a</b> <b>flat</b> right-front <b>tire.</b> To add insult to injury, he was tagged for speeding on pit road and was forced to serve a drive-through penalty. He rejoined the race in 40th two laps down. Debris in turn 4 brought out the third caution of the race on lap 80.|$|R
