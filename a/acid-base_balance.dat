5|$|The muscle {{weakness}} and {{increased risk of}} irregular heart beat in TPP result from markedly reduced levels of potassium in the bloodstream. Potassium is not in fact lost from the body, but increased Na+/K+-ATPase activity (the enzyme that moves potassium into cells and keeps sodium in the blood) leads to shift of potassium into tissues, and depletes the circulation. In other types of potassium derangement, the <b>acid-base</b> <b>balance</b> is usually disturbed, with metabolic alkalosis and metabolic acidosis often being present. In TPP, these disturbances are generally absent. Hypokalemia leads to hyperpolarization of muscle cells, making the neuromuscular junction less responsive to normal nerve impulses and leading to decreased contractility of the muscles.|$|E

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{study the}} effects on the water, electrolyte, and <b>acid-base</b> <b>balances</b> in rabbits {{submitted}} to antegrade enema with different solutions through appendicostomy. METHODS: Forty male New Zealand rabbits were submitted to appendicostomy, and distributed in 4 groups, according to the antegrade enema solution: PEG group, polyethylene glycol electrolyte solution (n= 10); ISS group, isotonic saline solution (n= 10); GS group, glycerin solution (n= 10); SPS group, sodium phosphate solution (n= 10). After being weighed, arterial blood gas analysis, red blood count, creatinine and electrolytes were measured at 4 times: preoperatively (T 1); day 6 postop, before enema (T 2); 4 h after enema (T 3); and 24 h after T 3 (T 4). RESULTS: In PEG group occurred Na retention after 4 h, causing alkalemia, sustained for 24 h with HCO 3 retention. In ISS group occurred isotonic water retention and hyperchloremic acidosis after 4 h, which was partially compensated in 24 h. GS group showed metabolic acidosis after 4 h, compensated in 24 h. In SPS group occurred hypernatremic dehydration, metabolic acidosis in 4 h, and hypokalemia, hypocalcemia, hypomagnesemia, and metabolic alkalosis with partially compensated dehydration in 24 h. CONCLUSIONS: All solutions {{used in this study}} caused minor alterations on water, electrolyte or <b>acid-base</b> <b>balances.</b> The most intense ones were caused by hypertonic sodium phosphate solution (SPS) and isotonic saline solution (ISS) and the least by polyethyleneglycol electrolyte solution (PEG) and glycerin solution 12 % (GS) ...|$|R

2500|$|The nephron is the {{structural}} and functional {{unit of the}} kidney. Each adult kidney contains around one million nephrons. The nephron utilizes four processes to alter the blood plasma which flows to it: filtration, reabsorption, secretion, and excretion.

Filtration occurs in the glomerulus: one-fifth of the blood volume that enters the kidneys is filtered.

Eight healthy adult, crossbred Bos taurus cattle received two treatments in a cross-over design: isotonic saline solution (IS) and test solution (TS) with 145 mEq of Na+, 5 mEq of K+, 4 mEq of Ca++, 2 mEq of Mg++, 96 mEq of Cl-, 60 mEq of lactate, 50 g of dextrose, and 4 mg of cyanocobalamin per liter. The solutions were IV infused in a volume corresponding to 5 % of BW, through 3 hours.

Glucose, L-lactate, Ca, P, Mg, pH, pCO 2, HCO 3 -, BE, Na+, K+, Cl-, and Ca++ were measured. Data were analyzed through repeated measures ANOVA.

2500|$|Ischemic stroke {{occurs because}} of a loss of blood supply to part of the brain, {{initiating}} the ischemic cascade. Brain tissue ceases to function if deprived of oxygen for more than 60 to 90 seconds, and after approximately three hours will suffer irreversible injury possibly leading {{to the death of}} the tissue, i.e., infarction. (This is why fibrinolytics such as alteplase are given only until three hours since the onset of the stroke.) Atherosclerosis may disrupt the blood supply by narrowing the lumen of blood vessels leading to a reduction of blood flow, by causing the formation of blood clots within the vessel, or by releasing showers of small emboli through the disintegration of atherosclerotic plaques. Embolic infarction occurs when emboli formed elsewhere in the circulatory system, typically in the heart as a consequence of atrial fibrillation, or in the carotid arteries, break off, enter the cerebral circulation, then lodge in and block brain blood vessels. Since blood vessels in the brain are now blocked, the brain becomes low in energy, and thus it resorts into using anaerobic metabolism within the region of brain tissue affected by ischemia. Anaerobic metabolism produces less adenosine triphosphate (ATP) but releases a by-product called lactic acid. Lactic acid is an irritant which could potentially destroy cells since it is an acid and disrupts the normal <b>acid-base</b> <b>balance</b> in the brain.

The control group created 6 cows, 11 gilts and 3 boars. The diet of the experimental cows (table No. 1) contained daily 250 mg Cd/kg of body weight (2 cows for 68 and 75 days), or 500 mg Cd/kg of body weight (5 cows for 183 - 328 days). Gilts and boars received 1 mg Cd/kg of body weight every day, at least for 90 days (boars), or 105 till 150 days (gilts) - table No. 17. Blood plasma was checked at cows in regular two-weeks intervals and results of haematology tests in experimental and control cows included determination of <b>acid-base</b> <b>balances</b> (pH, pCO 2, ABE and SBC) and metabolic profile (glucose, total protein, cholesterol, AST, GMT, ALT, carbamide, creatinine, b-carotene, Ca, P, Mg, Na, K).

Systemic haemodynamics were evaluated using pulse-wave analysis. Coagulation, <b>acid-base</b> status, calcium <b>balance</b> and dialysis efficiency were assessed using standard biochemical markers. RESULTS: Patients receiving the citrate dialysate had significantly lower systolic blood pressure (BP) (- 4. 3 mmHg, p < 0. 01) and peripheral resistances (PR) (- 51 dyne. sec. cm- 5, p < 0. 001) while stroke volume was not increased. In hypertensive patients there was a substantial reduction in BP (- 7. 8 mmHg, p < 0. 01). With the C+ dialysate the BP gap was less pronounced but the reduction in PR was even greater (- 226 dyne. sec. cm- 5, p < 0. 001). Analyses of the fluctuations in PR and of subjective tolerance suggested improved haemodynamic stability with the citrate dialysate. Furthermore, an increase in pre-dialysis bicarbonate and a decrease in pre-dialysis BUN, post-dialysis phosphate and ionised calcium were noted. Systemic coagulation activation was not influenced by citrate.

These data and modeling indicate that traditional under-standings of the nutrient availability–organic matter pro-duction relationship do not necessarily apply to the Baltic Sea. Modeling indicates that increased nutrient loads will not inhibit future Baltic Sea acidification; instead, increased mineralization and biological production will amplify the seasonal surface pH cycle.
