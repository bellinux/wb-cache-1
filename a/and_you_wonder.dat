Lawrence said the All of Us project was wholly inspired by the Cronulla riots. “You watch this stuff on TV <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>wonder</b> why people are doing this - this is no way for a multicultural society to behave,” said Lawrence.|$|E
500|$|A major effect {{required}} {{throughout the}} episode was face replacements, {{especially during the}} 'May vs. May' fight where it had to appear as if Wen was fighting herself. All the effects were completed in the two weeks between the filming and airing of the episode. Wen noted that [...] "Kevin Tancharoen directed [...] and he’s amazing with his directing with the Mortal Kombat series. So we had this really complicated sequence where we do this 360 and it reveals me and it reveals me again and there’s no cut <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>wonder</b> how that happens {{in one of the}} fight sequences. And that’s because they completely scanned and CGIed my face onto the stunt double. So there’s a tremendous amount of work that went into the fight scenes and we did not {{have a lot of time}} to do it." [...] She also elaborated that [...] "On the day of, you have the set and you have the cameras, and you have to deal with special effects, because on top of everything else we had to scan my face and go through this incredible process of taking a million pictures so they were able to meld it onto Sam’s face." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Distasteful, sir?" [...] {{said the}} captain, sternly. [...] "You have forced {{yourself}} {{on me for}} twice a week for some time past. You have insisted upon talking on every subject under the sun, whether I liked it or not. You have taken every opportunity of evading my wishes that you should not see my daughter, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>wonder</b> that I object to you.

60|$|The {{train is}} going {{at the rate}} of thirty miles an hour, the express speed in Germany, and a bridge comes in sight {{crossing}} over the line. On seeing this bridge, the guard, holding on by the window, leans his body as far back as ever it will go. You look at him, and then at the rapidly-nearing bridge, and calculate that the arch will just take his head off without injuring any other part of him whatever, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>wonder</b> whether the head will be jerked into the carriage or will fall outside.|$|E

6000|$|Why women suffer these wrongs--why {{they do not}} insist {{in having}} their clothes made small enough for them I cannot conceive. It can hardly be that they are disinclined to trouble {{themselves}} about matters of mere dress, for dress is the one subject that they really do think about. It is the only topic they ever get thoroughly interested in, and they talk about it all day long. If you see two women together, you may bet your bottom dollar they are discussing their own or their friends' clothes. You notice a couple of child-like beings conversing by a window, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>wonder</b> what sweet, helpful words are falling from their sainted lips. So you move nearer and then you hear one say: ...|$|E
60|$|In the Chinese bazaar are {{hundreds}} of small shops in which a miscellaneous collection of hardware and dry goods are to be found, and where many things are sold wonderfully cheap. You may buy gimlets at a penny each, white cotton thread at four balls for a halfpenny, and penknives, corkscrews, gunpowder, writing-paper, and many other articles as cheap or cheaper than you can purchase them in England. The shopkeeper is very good-natured; he will show you everything he has, and {{does not seem to}} mind if you buy nothing. He bates a little, but not so much as the Klings, who almost always ask twice what they are willing to take. If you buy a few things from him, he will speak to you afterwards every time you pass his shop, asking you to walk in and sit down, or take a cup of tea; <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>wonder</b> how he can get a living where so many sell the same trifling articles.|$|E
6000|$|... 'A little tired, eh, friend Wingfield?' he said sneering. 'Well, {{the play}} is rough till {{you get used to}} it. A night's sleep will refresh you, and to-morrow you will be a new man. Perhaps you believe that I have done my worst. Fool, this is but a beginning. Also you think doubtless that your obstinacy angers me? Wrong again, my friend, I only pray that you may keep your lips sealed to the last. Gladly would I give my share of this hidden gold in payment for two more such days with you. I have still much to pay you back, and look you, I {{have found a way to}} do it. There are more ways of hurting a man than through his own flesh--for instance, when I wished to be revenged upon your father, I struck him through her whom he loved. Now I have touched you <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>wonder</b> what I mean. Well, I will tell you. Perhaps you may know an Aztec lady of royal blood who is named Otomie?' ...|$|E

6000|$|... "'Acted' is {{the right}} word," [...] he said, just as composedly as before. [...] "The women on the stage {{are not the only}} women who can act. My mother's object was to make herself {{thoroughly}} acquainted with you, and to throw you off your guard by speaking in the character of a stranger. It is exactly like her to take that roundabout way of satisfying her curiosity about a daughter-in-law she disapproves of. If I had not joined you when I did, you would have been examined and cross-examined about yourself and about me, and you would innocently have answered under the impression that you were speaking to a chance acquaintance. There is my mother all over! She is your enemy, remember--not your friend. She is not in search of your merits, but of your faults. <b>And</b> <b>you</b> <b>wonder</b> why no impression was produced on her when she heard you addressed by your name! Poor innocent! I can tell you this--you only discovered my mother in her own character when I {{put an end to the}} mystification by presenting you to each other. You saw how angry she was, and now you know why." ...|$|E
60|$|By and by to the {{elephant}} stables, and I took a ride; {{but it was}} by request--I {{did not ask for}} it, and didn't want it; but I took it, because otherwise they would have thought I was afraid, which I was. The elephant kneels down, by command--one end of him at a time--and you climb the ladder and get into the howdah, and then he gets up, one end at a time, just as a ship gets up over a wave; and after that, as he strides monstrously about, his motion is much like a ship's motion. The mahout bores into {{the back of his head}} with a great iron prod <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>wonder</b> at his temerity and at {{the elephant}}'s patience, and you think that perhaps the patience will not last; but it does, and nothing happens. The mahout talks to the elephant in a low voice all the time, and the elephant seems to understand it all and to be pleased with it; and he obeys every order in the most contented and docile way. Among these twenty-five elephants were two which were larger than any I had ever seen before, and if I had thought I could learn to not be afraid, I would have taken one of them while the police were not looking.|$|E

5000|$|Also in 1979, {{during a}} concert {{on the beach}} in Capocotta (in fact also {{mentioned}} in the lyrics), before singing Nuntereggae più, Rino is said:"There's someone who wants to put a gag on me! I do not fear them! They will not succeed! I feel that, in the future, my songs will be sung by future generations, that, thanks to mass communication, they will understand what I mean tonight!
