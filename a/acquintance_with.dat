The research method used is descriptive-qualitative. The subjects are students at the Arabic Department who have taken Prose Analysis (Dirasah Natsriyyah) course. The result of the research shows that prose is an expression what lies in human’s heart. The goals of the learning is to understand theories used to analyze prose, and to apply them in text analysis. The themes studied included the understanding of prose, <b>acquintance</b> <b>with</b> some theoretical approaches for analysis, such as structuralism, semiotics, etc. The methods of learning employed are lecture, text analysis, and assignment. The media of learning used is power point. The evaluation is undertaken throughout the process of learning, in addition to what the students had achieved in their exams...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe Cartesian closed {{categories}} {{have been}} shown by several authors to provide the right framework of the model theory of λ-calculus. The second author developed this as a syntactic equivalence between two calculi, giving rise to {{a new kind of}} combinatory logic: the categorical combinatory logic, where computations can be done through simple rewrite rules, and, as usual with combinators, avoiding problems with variable name clashes. This paper goes further (though not requiring a previous knowledge of categorical combinatory logic) and describes a very simple machine where categorical terms can be considered as code acting on a graph of values (the essential actions are LISP's “cons” and “cdr”, as well as “rplacd” to implement recursion). The only saving mechanism is a stack containing pointers on code or on the graph. Abstractions are handled in the very same way as in P. Landin's SECD machine, using closures. The machine is called categorical abstract machine or CAM. The CAM is easier to grasp and prove than the SECD machine. The paper discusses the implementation of a real functional programming language, ML, through the CAM. A basic <b>acquintance</b> <b>with</b> λ-calculus is required...|$|E
40|$|Signing the {{construction}} {{contract with the}} selected contracor presents for the investor {{the beginning of the}} realization of the intention to build or reconstruct the facility under consideration. The contract requires the contractor to execute the given scope of works, and the investor to pay the contractual price. Both parties, the investor and the contractor, have to be aware of large risks accompanying the contract. The contract object is namely an endeavour that requires a large number of participants, significant financial means and a lot of time. Therefore, the contract has to be composed with dilligence. The key requirements in this process are thorough <b>acquintance</b> <b>with</b> legal nature of {{the construction}} contract, correct interpretation of the contractual clauses and familiarity with other properties of this type of contracts. Fulfilling these elements leads to successful cooperation of the parties and mutual satisfaction. Legal practice shows frequent conflicts or even lawsuits between the parties. In many cases the object of the conflict is the turn - key contract. The thesis concludes that the responsibility often lies, among other factors, in poorly prepared project documantation, as well as in legislature that allows the execution of tenders based on incomplete project documentation...|$|E
40|$|In this essay, we will {{evaluate}} the first literature histories of Turkish literature, mostly {{the works of}} Abdülhalîm Memdûh’s,Şahabettin Süleyman’s and Faik Reşat’s called Târîh-i Edebiyyât-ı ‘Osmâniyye. Besides, {{we will try to}} define the similar aspects of theliterature historians, writing Ottoman literature histories. To what extent are the private life of Abdülhalîm Memdûh and hispolitical life reflected in his work? It is striking that he attepted to found a secret society and he was arrested, he maintened his lifepassing under difficult conditions, {{with the help of his}} protector, Prenses Nazlı, his life passed with full of exiles, he became anopponent to second Abdülhamit, he died due to his using a drug-mixture for his insomnia, his death took place in Folcestone, acity of England, and his mortal remain was transfered to a hill he liked while he was a guest in Tunus at the option of PrensesNazlı. It is significant the editor of the work named Târîh-i Edebiyyât-ı ‘Osmâniyye written by Abdülhalîm Memdûh is Ohannes Ferîtwith Armenian origin who was known as the agent in the period og Abdülhamit II, his bohemian life was similar to ŞahabettinSüleyman’s life, they were both the admirers of the West. It is also important the life of Faik Reşat was full of disorders and hewas charged with paganism. We will try to assess all these questions and the similarities from different perspectives. The first Turkish literature work known as the history of literature written by Abdülhalîm Memdûh is Târîh-i Edebiyyât-ı‘Osmâniyye (1888 - 1889). After this work, nothing had been written during 22 years in the field of literature history in the Turkishliterature. In the second half of the 19 th century and first quarter of 20 th century some articles were written on early writers andthese were turned into books later on. A few works were written in the form of antology and biyography. Kudemadan Birkaç Şair(1881) by Recaizâde Mahmut Ekrem, Osmanlı Şairleri (1890) by Muallim Naci, Eslâf (1895 - 1896) by Faik Reşat are rare examples inthis cathegory. Some of these works are identified as literature history. Getting the litearture history lesson into the schedules ofuniversities and high schools had the numbers of literature history increased. In 1910 Şahabettin Süleyman, in 1911 Faik Reşat, in 1912 Ali Ekrem Bolayır and in the same year Mehmet Hayrettin, the teacher of Konya high school, published their works namedTârîh-i Edebiyyât-ı ‘Osmâniyye while in 1913, Şahabettin Süleyman and Mehmet Fuat Köprülü published Yeni Osmanlı Târîh-iEdebiyyâtı (The new ottoman literature history). In Turkish literature, literature histories havıng been written later on tendedtowards general Turkish literature (genel Türk edebiyatı) and westernization so in this essay we tried to compare Târîh-i Edebiyyât-ı‘Osmâniyye belonging to Abdülhalîm Memdûh, Şahabettin Süleyman and Faik Reşat from in many aspects mostly. In the first part of our essay, we focused on (dwell upon) the common lives and the writers who have works about theOttoman literature history. Some of these writers gave lessons in high school while the others gave them in universities. FaikReşat and Ali Ekrem Bolayır were in universities while Mehmet Hayrettin was in high school. Abdülhalîm Memdûh, ŞahabettinSüleyman and Faik Reşat have many common points. The most striking one is both three had financial problems and they lived alittle bohemian lives. The bohemian life reached its peak during the teenage life of Şahabettin Süleyman. In his teenage life,Abdülhalîm Memdûh became the member of many secret societies. Abdülhalîm Memdûh got the comfortable life thanks to themarriage with Prenses Nazlı, the daughter of the prince Mustafa Fazıl Paşa and as Abdülhalîm Memdûh, Şahabettin Süleyman alsolived in comfort thanks to a marriage. We know Mustafa Fazıl Paşa was sponsor of many newspapers and magazines of newOttoman society in Ottoman political history in 19 th century. Mustafa Fazıl Paşa was also a mason. Both Abdülhalîm Memdûhand Şahabettin Süleyman died in their young ages in abroad that this is really interesting. Abdülhalîm Memdûh died in the age of 39 in Folcestone, England owing to a medicine (drug) he took because of insomnia while Şahabettin Süleyman died in the age of 34 in Davos, Spain because of Spanish flu. Their deaths in young ages and abroad is interesting because it was not easy to goabroad in the last periods of Ottoman empire. These two writers could easily overcome this problem after getting rid of financial too) and could travel to the west only after his marriage. Faik Resat’s life is also important. He supported the old style but afterthe <b>acquintance</b> <b>with</b> the west, he became the admirer of the west and disposed all his poems related to the old styles (eski) butlater on he got back to his old style. It is possible to resemble him to Ziya Paşa. Abdi, from Şarkîkarahisar, one of the pioneers ofthe old literature and poet blamed Faik Reşat for frenklik and irreligion that this was a big accusition. It is a striking fact that thewriters having created the first works of Ottoman literature admired for the west and lived bohemian lives. At the same timeAbdülhalîm Memdûh’s being Young Turk (Jön Türk) gains importance at this point. It can be said Memdûh also had problemswith regime. His life full of banishment confirms this situation. It is interesting that Faik Reşat travelled to Trablusgarp with aneager of mektupçuluk in the year he suffered from financial difficulties. Trablusgarp was also visited by Abdülhalîm Memdûh. Hemust have published Târîh-i Edebiyyât-ı ‘Osmâniyye in Konya he and Ali Kemal were banished to. It is possible to say Faik Reşat wasa conscious literature historian. In this part of the essay we will try to compare the first ottoman histories in some aspects. As mentioned before, we will takeas a base the Works of Abdülhalîm Memdûh, Şahabettin Süleyman ve Faik Reşat (Târîh-i Edebiyyât-ı ‘Osmâniyye). Morever, we willbenefit from the other literature histories and the Works written in the field of antholojy and and biography. It is possible tocategorize the evaluations made in this section in 3 titles under the main title, the content analysis on Târîh-i Edebiyyât-ı ‘Osmâniyye...|$|E
