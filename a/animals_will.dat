5|$|A {{polymerase}} {{chain reaction}} test on a blood sample from affected <b>animals</b> <b>will</b> confirm a suspected case by identifying the viral DNA, though it is now common to start famciclovir treatment at the earliest possible moment rather than waiting for confirmation of the case. Prior {{to the development of}} the test, or in circumstances where it is not available, the disease may be misdiagnosed as any of a number of other conditions which have a quick onset leading to rapid death, including encephalomyocarditis and salmonellosis.|$|E
5|$|The {{diet and}} {{physiology}} of Edmontosaurus have been probed by using stable isotopes of carbon and oxygen as recorded in tooth enamel. When feeding, drinking, and breathing, animals take in carbon and oxygen, which become incorporated into bone. The isotopes {{of these two}} elements are determined by various internal and external factors, such as the type of plants being eaten, the physiology of the animal, salinity, and climate. If isotope ratios in fossils are not altered by fossilization and later changes, they can be studied {{for information about the}} original factors; warmblooded <b>animals</b> <b>will</b> have certain isotopic compositions compared to their surroundings, animals that eat certain types of plants or use certain digestive processes will have distinct isotopic compositions, and so on. Enamel is typically used because the structure of the mineral that forms enamel makes it the most resistant material to chemical change in the skeleton.|$|E
5|$|The selfish herd {{theory was}} {{proposed}} by W.D. Hamilton {{to explain why}} animals seek central positions in a group. The theory's central idea {{is to reduce the}} individual's domain of danger. A domain of danger is the area within the group in which the individual {{is more likely to be}} attacked by a predator. The center of the group has the lowest domain of danger, so <b>animals</b> <b>will</b> constantly strive to gain this position. Testing Hamilton's selfish herd effect, Alta De Vos and Justin O'Rainn (2010) studied brown fur seal predation from great white sharks. Using decoy seals, the researchers varied the distance between the decoys to produce different domains of danger. The seals with a greater domain of danger had an increased risk of shark attack.|$|E

5000|$|Active aphagia: Active aphagia is a {{complete}} rejection of food. The <b>animal</b> <b>will</b> physically push food away or move its head from it. One might first sample the food by smelling or tasting, then spit out anything in the mouth. Afterwards the <b>animal</b> <b>will</b> show {{a complete}} repulsion to the food. The animal reacts to food {{as if it is}} bitter or foul.|$|R
2500|$|The boids {{computer}} program, {{created by}} Craig Reynolds in 1986, simulates swarm behaviour following the above rules. Many subsequent and current models use variations on these rules, often implementing them {{by means of}} concentric [...] "zones" [...] around each animal. In the zone of repulsion, {{very close to the}} animal, the focal <b>animal</b> <b>will</b> seek to distance itself from its neighbours to avoid collision. Slightly further away, in the zone of alignment, the focal <b>animal</b> <b>will</b> seek to align its direction of motion with its neighbours. In the outermost zone of attraction, which extends as far away from the focal animal as it is able to sense, the focal <b>animal</b> <b>will</b> seek to move towards a neighbour.|$|R
5|$|<b>Animals</b> <b>will</b> use {{different}} gaits for different speeds, terrain and situations. For example, horses show four natural gaits, the slowest horse gait is the walk, {{then there are}} three faster gaits which, from slowest to fastest, are the trot, the canter and the gallop. Animals may also have unusual gaits that are used occasionally, such as for moving sideways or backwards. For example, the main human gaits are bipedal walking and running, but they employ many other gaits occasionally, including a four-legged crawl in tight spaces. Mammals show a vast range of gaits, the order that they place and lift their appendages in locomotion. Gaits can be grouped into categories according to their patterns of support sequence. For quadrupeds, there are three main categories: walking gaits, running gaits and leaping gaits. Walking {{is the most common}} gait, where some feet are on the ground at any given time, and found in almost all legged animals. Running is considered to occur when at some points in the stride all feet are off the ground in a moment of suspension.|$|E

25|$|Although {{animals have}} never evolved wheels for locomotion, {{a small number}} of <b>animals</b> <b>will</b> move at times by rolling their whole body. Rolling animals can be divided into those that roll under the force of gravity or wind and those that roll using their own power.|$|E
25|$|In some cases, <b>animals</b> <b>will</b> {{choose to}} engage in sexual {{activity}} with different sexes at different times in their lives, and will sometimes engage in sexual activity with different sexes at random. Same-sex sexual activity can also be seasonal in some animals, like male walruses who often engage in same-sex sexual activity with each other outside of the breeding season and will revert to heterosexual sexual activity during breeding season.|$|E
25|$|Homosexual pair-bonding can be {{established}} several ways; two of the main ways are pair bonding as partners or as companions. As partners, both <b>animals</b> <b>will</b> engage in sexual activities with each other. In companions bonding, sexual engagement is not necessary in the relationship. This form of homosexuality {{is more of a}} partnership and friendship; they spend all their time together. More than 70 species of birds engage in one of these two bonding.|$|E

25|$|During gliding, lift {{plays an}} {{increased}} role. Like drag, lift {{is proportional to}} velocity squared. Gliding <b>animals</b> <b>will</b> typically leap or drop from high locations such as trees, just as in parachuting, and as gravitational acceleration increases their speed, the aerodynamic forces also increase. Because the animal can utilize lift and drag to generate greater aerodynamic force, it can glide at a shallower angle than parachuting animals, allowing it to cover greater horizontal distance in the same loss of altitude, and reach trees further away.|$|E
25|$|In May 2016 the Baby Animals re-released Baby Animals as Baby Animals 25th Anniversary (or BA25), to {{celebrate}} 25 {{years since the}} original release of their debut. This expanded version includes live songs, unreleased tracks, B-sides and pre-studio demos. Also in that month they provided two gigs with the original line-up performing the debut album in full and the new line-up playing tracks from This Is not the End. In March 2017, it was announced the Baby <b>Animals</b> <b>will</b> perform a national headline tour with The Screaming Jets in June and July 2017.|$|E

25|$|Even with {{cooperation}} of the human element of the equation, reconciliation ecology can not help every species. Some animals, such as several species of waterfowl, show strong avoidance behaviors toward humans and any form of human disturbance. No matter how nice an urban park is built, the proximity of humans will scare away some birds. Other species must maintain large territories, and barriers that abound in human habitats, such as roads, will stop them from coexisting with humans. These <b>animals</b> <b>will</b> require undisturbed land set aside for them.|$|E
25|$|The BLM has {{established}} Herd Management Areas {{to determine where}} and how many <b>animals</b> <b>will</b> be sustained as free-roaming populations. Some populations of free-roaming horses and burros remain protected under the Act, but others have disappeared from places where there were once established populations. A few hundred free-roaming horses survive in Alberta and British Columbia. The BLM considers roughly 26,000 individuals a manageable number, but the feral mustang population in February 2010 was 33,700 horses and 4,700 burros. More {{than half of all}} mustangs in North America are found in Nevada (which features the horses on its State Quarter), with other significant populations in California, Oregon, Utah, Montana, and Wyoming. Another 34,000 horses are in holding facilities.|$|E
25|$|Males are {{territorial}} {{of their}} roosts, and will often fight other intruding males {{by means of}} boxing. Males follow a pattern of behavioral stages before fighting. This entails ear movements, head lifts, neck craning, wing unfolding, punch mimicking, and finally boxing with each other. Even though this is aggressive behavior, either male is allowed to stop fighting and leave the conflict, and injuries usually aren't worse than a few scrapes and bruises. It is also shown that males use distinct vocalizations during conflicts, which {{might be used to}} determine the identity of the competitor, and based on that information, parts of the pre-fighting stages can be skipped, and the <b>animals</b> <b>will</b> begin boxing.|$|E

6000|$|... "The Law of Effect is that: Of several {{responses}} made to {{the same}} situation, those which are accompanied or closely followed by satisfaction to the <b>animal</b> <b>will,</b> other things being equal, be more firmly connected with the situation, so that, when it recurs, {{they will be more}} likely to recur; those which are accompanied or closely followed by discomfort to the <b>animal</b> <b>will,</b> other things being equal, have their connections with that situation weakened, so that, when it recurs, they will be less likely to occur. The greater the satisfaction or discomfort, the greater the strengthening or weakening of the bond.|$|R

25|$|In {{order for}} an immunocontraceptive to be {{palatable}} for human use, {{it would need}} to meet or exceed the efficacy rates of currently popular forms of contraception. Currently the maximum reduction of fertility due to sperm vaccines in laboratory experiments with mice is ~75%. The lack of efficacy is due to variability of immunogenicity from one animal to another. Even when exposed to the same exact vaccine, some <b>animals</b> <b>will</b> produce abundant antibody titers to the vaccine's antigen, while others produce relatively low antibody titers. In the Eppin trial that attained 100% infertility, a small sample size (only 9 monkeys) was used, and even among this small sample 2 monkeys were dropped from the study because they failed to produce sufficiently high antibody titers.|$|E
25|$|In {{the ancient}} Andean civilizations such as Inca Empire, slings {{were made from}} llama wool. These slings {{typically}} have a cradle that is long and thin and features a relatively long slit. Andean slings were constructed from contrasting colours of wool; complex braids and fine workmanship can result in beautiful patterns. Ceremonial slings were also made; these were large, non-functional and generally lacked a slit. To this day, ceremonial slings are used {{in parts of the}} Andes as accessories in dances and in mock battles. They are also used by llama herders; the <b>animals</b> <b>will</b> move away from the sound of a stone landing. The stones are not slung to hit the animals, but to persuade them to move in the desired direction.|$|E
25|$|All cetaceans, {{including}} belugas, have physiological adaptations {{designed to}} conserve oxygen {{while they are}} under water. During a dive, these <b>animals</b> <b>will</b> reduce their heart rate from 100 beats a minute to between 12 and 20. Blood flow is diverted away from certain tissues and organs and towards the brain, heart and lungs, which require a constant oxygen supply. The amount of oxygen dissolved in the blood is 5.5%, which is greater than that found in land-based mammals and {{is similar to that}} of Weddell seals (a diving marine mammal). One study found a female beluga had 16.5 l of oxygen dissolved in her blood. Lastly, the beluga's muscles contain high levels of the protein myoglobin, which stores oxygen in muscle. Myoglobin concentrations are several times greater than for terrestrial mammals, which help prevent oxygen deficiency during dives.|$|E

50|$|The flight zone is an {{important}} principle for herding, working, and mustering livestock. An animal can be stimulated to move simply by skirting its flight zone, and the <b>animal</b> <b>will</b> move in the desired direction according {{to the point of}} balance. The point of balance is usually located at the animals shoulder according to their wide angled vision. An over-stimulated <b>animal</b> <b>will</b> have a larger flight zone, for example an excited or scared animal. A Cumulative Flight Zone is formed when animals move in a herd. In this situation the lead animal and the following animals Points of Balance, within the cumulative flight zone, must both be crossed to entice movement.|$|R
6000|$|All {{through the}} king's thirteenth year {{but one thing}} was talked of by the soothsayers, the statesmen, the little parliament, and the general people.
