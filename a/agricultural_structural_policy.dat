40|$|The Less Favoured Areas (LFAs) Directive (75 / 268) {{which was}} {{introduced}} in 1975, was the first common European instrument of regional <b>agricultural</b> <b>structural</b> <b>policy.</b> LFAs are areas where agriculture is hampered by permanent natural handicaps. The major objectives were to ensure the continuation of farming, thereby maintaining a minimum population level and preserving scenic landscapes and environmentally valuable habitats. In the Netherlands, the LFA measure is used as an additional payment, to compensate farmers for negative economic effects due to the conservation of these natural handicaps. It was not implemented as a stand alone policy, but is linked to measures aiming at active nature and landscape conservation management. In this paper, the effects will be examined of the regulations aiming at the conservation of natural handicaps on farm businesses within LFAs, when comparing them to farm businesses outside LFAs, where these regulations and handicaps do not exist. The main data source that was used is the Farm Accountancy Data Network. Reference groups of farms were compiled {{with the use of}} the simple and multiple imputation approach in Stars (Statistics for Regional Studies). Both analyses were tested with the use of a parametric and a nonparametric test. When comparing the results of both analyses, it can be concluded that there is no evidence that there is a statistical difference in family farm income corrected for and not corrected for LFA payment between the LFA farm businesses and the reference groups. Based on these findings it can be concluded that the size of the compensatory allowances is small and there is no evidence that it has a significant effect on the family farm income of LFA farm businesses. The main purpose of the Dutch LFA policy is to compensate farm businesses for negative economic effects due to the conservation of natural handicaps. Although this may be true for some individual farms, based on the methods used in this paper, it appears not to be the case for the collectivity of LFA premium beneficiaries as a whole.

40|$|In recent years, the Korean {{government}} {{has sought to}} encourage rural young people to enter farming and older farmers to leave it. The government‟s tool for promoting this intergenerational change has been <b>agricultural</b> <b>structural</b> adjustment <b>policy,</b> which includes farm entry policy, farm exit policy, competitiveness policy, and rural development policy. However, {{the number of young}} farmers has decreased and number of old farmers has increased. This research investigates why <b>agricultural</b> <b>structural</b> adjustment <b>policy</b> has failed, analyzing survey data on farm entry and exit using regression analysis, and with procedures enhanced by bootstrapping. The conclusions of the research are as follows. <b>Agricultural</b> <b>structural</b> adjustment <b>policy</b> does not induce young people to enter farming mainly because: 1) Rural young people have as little enthusiasm for farming as their urban counterparts; and 2) Competitiveness policy cancels the effects of farm entry <b>policy.</b> Meanwhile, <b>agricultural</b> <b>structural</b> adjustment <b>policy</b> has not induced old farmers to retire mainly because: 1) Older farmers are as reluctant to leave farming as younger ones; 2) Farm exit policy does not promote farm exit; and 3) Competitiveness policy and rural development policy, as well as farming conditions and farm exit barriers, cancel the effects of farm exit policy.

40|$|The paper {{outlines}} some chosen Polish programmes {{of rural}} areas shaping, {{developed in a}} few recent years {{against the background of}} permanent and sustain-able development. Development of the village and agriculture in the EU is based mainly on the common <b>agricultural</b> <b>policy,</b> <b>structural</b> <b>policy</b> and regional policy. Agricultural policy may be defined as price – profit <b>policy</b> and supporting <b>structural</b> <b>policy</b> while <b>structural</b> <b>policy</b> consists in influencing production factors which stimulate the changes on rural areas. Regional policy supports restructuring of agriculture, multifunctional development of rural areas and balancing unfavour-able differences between regions. The aim of those activities is creating the value and an economically sustained position of rural areas, especially as a place of liv-ing, working and relaxation in natural environment and taking into consideration a sensible development of agricultural structures as well. Thanks to a consequent policy of sustainable development in the recent dozen of years the EU has reached a considerable progress in LFA (Less Favoured Areas) reduction. The performed survey of chosen strategies of village and agriculture devel-opment worked out in Poland in the years 2001 - 2006 shows that in most cases they refer to Lisbon Strategy and have various range: from a partial reference to rural areas (The updated concept of the country spatial development) to a slightly broader expression of the problem (Our vision of Poland, The National Programme of Rural Development).

It concentrates on the EU’s Common <b>Agricultural</b> <b>Policy</b> and <b>Structural</b> <b>Policy</b> and calculates the possible fiscal consequences of enlarging the EU for various policy scenarios. Enlarging the EU could be financed without overstepping the current upper limit for the EU budget, but it increases the pressure for EU policy reform.

These reforms would lead to a distribution of net burdens, which was more strongly orientated according to the relative income of EU members.

Drawing on fieldwork conducted in two Chinese counties in 2008 and 2009, this article investigates how the new policy is being substantiated and implemented at the local level. It argues that by combining China’s new fiscal system of transfer payments to poor local governments with administrative reforms, intensified internal project evaluation, and efforts to increase the rural income through a mixture of infrastructural investment, agricultural specialization, the expansion of social welfare, and accelerated urbanization, “building a new socialist countryside” constitutes more than a political slogan and {{has the potential to}} successfully overcome rural poverty and the rural-urban divide.

After a short presentation of the Court's historical background, there is an examination of this institution's structure. Provisions regarding its Members, Personnel and Internal Organisation are analysed {{in an attempt to}} assess the Court’s structural framework An analysis of the Court's mission, namely to examine all the accounts (revenue/expenditure) of the Communities and of all bodies set up or simply financed by them, is next. The analysis focuses on the audit regarding the regularity/legality of the transactions and the soundness of the financial management. The method used for these audits, called the "systems based approach" is presented and explained. The reporting activities of the Court (Annual Report, Statement of Assurance, Special Reports), being of essential importance since they include the findings of the Court along with the replies of the audited institutions, are given much attention. Because of its competences the Court is {{a major player in the}} battle against fraud in the Communities and its role in that issue is also assessed. The thesis includes also an examination of the Court's auditing competences regarding expenditure for the second and third pillar of the European Union. The collaboration between the Court and the other institutions (Commission, Parliament, Council, European Investment Bank) is presented, focusing on the possibilities of improving it. The dependence of the Court on the assistance of the National Audit Institutions of the Member States, especially regarding on the spot checks is highlighted along with other aspects of their collaboration.

This study is part of an EU wide research project on employment development in leading and lagging rural regions of the EU. Total employment in Drenthe increased by 24, 500 jobs or with over 20 % in the period 1984 - 1996. Nearly 40 % of employment growth occurred in the community, social and personal services sector, 25 % in the trade, restaurant and hotel sector, 14 % in the financial services sector, 13 % in the construction sector and 12 % in the manufacturing sector. A substantial part of employment growth consists of part time jobs. Employment in the agricultural sector declined by over 2, 000 jobs in this period. Employment development is the result of many interacting factors. As strengths have been identified the beautiful landscape, which attracts tourists, labourers, entrepreneurs and retirees, the location of the region near the city of Groningen, the strategies of policymakers to create favourable preconditions for firm settlement, like zones of economic activities, low land prices and investment subsidies. Weak points in the employment situation are the peripheral location of Drenthe relatively to main economic centres, the cautious and risk averting attitude of many entrepreneurs and the relatively thinness of the economic structure.

This paper contributes to this line of research by building up composite indicators for different facets –social, economic, environmental and global– of farm sustainability using a methodological approach that combines Data Envelopment Analysis and Multi Criteria Decision Methods. This approach is applied to a database of 163 farms located in the Spanish Northern Plateau. Our findings show that both economic and environmental sustainability indicators are positively correlated, but {{that this is not}} the case for the social indicator. We also check the influence of a set of variables on farm sustainability using bootstrapping techniques, and showing that increasing farm size, membership on agricultural cooperatives and farmers’ medium and upper agricultural-specific technical education all exert a significant positive influence on sustainability.

The latter group is, everything else being equal, more likely to stay on the farm. This could imply that, if preventing migration from rural to urban areas is a policy objective, production support schemes will be effective for some groups, but will be less effective for the group with lifestyle objectives.

40|$|This paper {{explores the}} link between <b>agricultural,</b> {{environmental}} and <b>structural</b> <b>policies</b> and desertification in Southern Europe. The {{focus is on the}} way policy goals evolve in the implementation process and become translated into actions at the operative level. The results derive from policy stakeholder interviews from four research areas situated in Greece, Italy, Portugal and Spain. The significance of policies as drivers of desertification varies between the case study areas, and harmful land management practices often result from power imbalances between interest groups involved in land-use planning and policy implementation rather than from flaws in the policies themselves. The vagueness of the definition of what ‘desertification’ constitutes allows for different interpretations of its nature, significance and the consequent weight it is given in land management decision-making, thus lending itself to be both misinterpreted and misappropriated by different stakeholder interests. The paper discusses the interplay between five different discourses of desertification and four distinct agendas of policy implementation and land use. The agendas either enhance or mitigate desertification and represent the interests of actors who have acquired a powerful position in the network of stakeholders, often relying on, and simultaneously maintaining, discourses and structures that lend them first right to decision-making over the natural resources of the locality.

How the common agricultural policy, both through transfers from the EU budget and by disciplining domestic farming and non-farming policies, is expected to contribute to bridging the gaps is the topic of the second section. In the third section, by employing a non-parameter method (Data Envelopment Analysis), we are trying to assess the performance of the commercial farming pole, being known that the diffusion of technology is an important ingredient of the convergence process.

40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} {{strategic}} framework for policies to assist smallholders in developing countries. It describes the inevitable features of structural {{change in the}} agricultural and rural economy, the associated pressures that these changes place on smallholders, and the consequent need for policies to facilitate rather than impede adjustment. A key premise of the framework is that, {{for the majority of}} smallholders, the long term (i. e. inter-generational) future lies outside the sector. Hence, long-term policies need to make a distinction between those who potentially have a competitive future in the sector and those who do not. In either case, many of the necessary policies will not be agriculture-specific, so it is important that agricultural policies are framed in a broader economy-wide framework. In addition, a clear distinction needs to be made between short-term policies to reduce poverty and food insecurity and long-term policies to stimulate development. This is because there are intertemporal trade-offs (as well as complementarities) between policies that are likely to be effective in the short-run, and those promising most impact over the long-term. The paper discusses the role of different agricultural and non-agricultural policies in providing the appropriate policy mix in countries at different stages of development. smallholders, rural development, <b>agricultural</b> <b>policy,</b> <b>structural</b> change, <b>Agricultural</b> and Food Policy, Community/Rural/Urban Development, International Development, O 20, Q 18, R 23,...|$|R

The regional <b>structural</b> <b>policy</b> holds a permanent place in the German economic thought as a part o f the economic policy pursued by the State. A specific character of the federal state implies special regulations concerning the problem of subjectiveness. Goals of the regional <b>structural</b> <b>policy</b> ensue from the pyramid of goals accepted within the framework of social market economy doctrine. The instruments applied have been subordinated to these goals.
