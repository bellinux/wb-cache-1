40|$|During {{the last}} two decades, {{developing}} countries such as India have been exhibiting rapid increase in human population and vehicles, and increase in road accidents. Inappropriate driving behaviour {{is considered one of}} the major causes of road accidents in India as compared to defective geometric design of pavement or mechanical defects in vehicles. Apart from the other factors causing accidents such as poor road design,vehicle conditions, driver characteristics of frequent traffic violations, increase in crashes due to self-centred driving, etc. it can also be resulted in conditions such as lack of psychophysical abilities e. g. poor eye sight, poor vision at night time, glare blindness etc. Hence, improved driver screening facilities accompanied by availability of good driving aids such as <b>anti</b> <b>glare</b> glasses can be an effective and preventive measure to inhibit crash risks. This article is based on a case study jointly done by CSIR-Central Road Research Institute and Institute of Driver Training & Research, Maruti, Loni Border, Delhi, India to highlight visual limitations among the learner drivers which can influence (as per the literature review) driving behaviour with crash chances, which can be reduced through improving safety accompanied with better driver screening, providing free visual aids and modifying present licensing procedures...|$|E
40|$|Smart {{materials}} are predicted to ‘revolutionise ’ the A/E/C industry. They {{are supposed to}} enable a building to change colour, shape, size and opacity. However, past research shows that smart {{materials are}} still not used very often in engineering applications to their full potential. In this publication we advocate that materials should not be only chosen for simple properties such as visual, physical and insulating characteristics, but for capabilities such as being able to save/generate energy, store information, and to react to stimuli from their local environment. Therefore, this paper will research into the addition of SolaVeil to a window, its physical configuration and the possibility to model and analyse it through Building Performance simulation (BPS). This material is primarily designed to eliminate glare and redirect light. As a result it can reduce energy use caused by air conditioning and artificial lighting systems. This paper researches into the behaviour of SolaVeil in a computer simulation using two different case studies. The first will compare how changing the width but maintaining the reflective area affects illuminance distribution, and the second will determine which physical properties of SolaVeil are most effective. Finally, conclusions are drawn based on the case studies and it is shown that smaller width light shelves are the most suitable for an <b>anti</b> <b>glare</b> product. It is also determined that for SolaVeil to minimise glare in a room without compromising illuminance levels, it should have a light shelf angle of 40 degrees, cover between 40 - 60 % of a window and its strips should be spaced 5 mm...|$|E
