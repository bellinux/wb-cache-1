25|$|In some cases, an {{excessive}} use of perfumes may cause allergic reactions of the skin. For instance, <b>acetophenone,</b> ethyl acetate and acetone while present in many perfumes, are also known or potential respiratory allergens. Nevertheless, this may be misleading, since the harm presented by many of these chemicals (either natural or synthetic) is dependent on environmental conditions and their concentrations in a perfume. For instance, linalool, which is listed as an irritant, causes skin irritation when it degrades to peroxides, however the use of antioxidants in perfumes or reduction in concentrations can prevent this. As well, the furanocoumarin present in natural extracts of grapefruit or celery can cause severe allergic reactions and increase sensitivity to ultraviolet radiation.|$|E

500|$|Conant's {{investigations}} {{helped in}} the development of a more comprehensive understanding of the nature of acids and bases. He investigated the properties of certain acids which were many times stronger than mineral acid solutions in water.

These investigations used acetic acid as the solvent and demonstrated that sodium acetate behaves as a base under these conditions. [...] This observation is consistent with Brønsted–Lowry acid–base theory (published in 1923) but cannot be explained under older Arrhenius theory approaches. Later work with George Wheland and extended by William Kirk McEwen looked at the properties of hydrocarbons as very weak acids, including <b>acetophenone,</b> phenylacetylene, fluorene and diphenylmethane. Conant can be considered alongside Brønsted, Lowry, Lewis, and Hammett as a developer of modern understanding of acids and bases.|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: With the {{ultimate}} goal of identifying new compounds active against root-knot nematodes, a set of 14 substituted chalcones were synthesised, starting from <b>acetophenones.</b> These chalcones and various <b>acetophenones</b> were tested in vitro against Meloidogyne incognita. RESULTS: The most potent <b>acetophenones</b> were 4 -nitroacetophenone and 4 -iodoacetophenone, with EC 50 / 24 h values of 12 [*]±[*] 5 and 15 [*]±[*] 4 [*]mg[*]L- 1 respectively, somewhat weaker than that of the chemical control fosthiazate in our previous experiments (EC 50 / 24 h 0. 4 [*]±[*] 0. 3 [*]mg[*]L- 1). When we converted the <b>acetophenones</b> to chalcones, the nematicidal activity differed, based on their substitution pattern. The condensation of 4 -nitroacetophenone with 2, 4, 6 -trihydroxybenzaldehyde to give the corresponding chalcone (E) - 1 -(4 -nitrophenyl) - 3 -(2, 4, 6 -trihydroxyphenyl) prop- 2 -en- 1 -one led to a slight reduction in activity (EC 50 / 24 h value 25 [*]±[*] 17 [*]mg[*]L- 1). Moreover, (E) - 3 -(2 -hydroxy- 5 -iodophenyl) - 1 -(4 -methoxyphenyl) prop- 2 -en- 1 -one showed better activity (EC 50 / 24 h value 26 [*]±[*] 15 [*]mg[*]L- 1) than 4 -methoxyacetophenone (EC 50 / 24 h value 43 [*]±[*] 10 [*]mg[*]L- 1). CONCLUSIONS: <b>Acetophenones</b> and chalcones may represent good leads in the discovery of new nematicidal compounds and may have potential use in crop management as active ingredients...|$|R
40|$|AbstractRelationships between {{chemical}} mass {{shifts and}} physiochemical properties of ions are sought by examining substituted <b>acetophenones,</b> benzophenones, and pyridines in a modified ion trap mass spectrometer. Systematic changes in chemical mass shift occur {{with changes in}} substituent in the <b>acetophenones</b> and the benzophenones. Brown’s σ+ constant, which {{is a measure of}} electronic effects of substituents in reactions that involve positive charge development, is shown to correlate linearly with chemical mass shifts in para-substituted <b>acetophenones</b> and benzophenones. Brown’s σ+ constant also correlates with the ease of dissociation of the ions via a correlation with ionization energy. It is suggested that ease of dissociation is the underlying factor in determining chemical mass shifts. The experimental results also suggest that dissociative collisions between ions and buffer gas make a much greater contribution to chemical mass shifts than do elastic collisions...|$|R
40|$|The {{biological}} Baeyer-Villiger oxidation of <b>acetophenones</b> was {{studied by}} 19 F {{nuclear magnetic resonance}} (NMR). The 19 F NMR method was used to characterise the time-dependent conversion of various fluorinated <b>acetophenones</b> in either whole cells of Pseudomonas fluorescens ACB or in incubations with purified 4 '-hydroxyacetophenone monooxygenase (HAPMO). Whole cells of P. fluorescens ACB converted 4 '-fluoroacetophenone to 4 -fluorophenol and 4 '-fluoro- 2 '-hydroxyacetophenone to 4 -fluorocatechol without the accumulation of 4 '-fluorophenyl acetates. In contrast to 4 -fluorophenol, 4 -fluorocatechol was further degraded {{as evidenced by the}} formation of stoichiometric amounts of fluoride anion. Purified HAPMO catalysed the strictly NADPH-dependent conversion of fluorinated <b>acetophenones</b> to fluorophenyl acetates. Incubations with HAPMO at pH 6 and 8 showed that the enzymatic Baeyer-Villiger oxidation occurred faster at pH 8 but that the phenyl acetates produced were better stabilised at pH 6. Quantum mechanical characteristics explained why 4 '-fluoro- 2 '-hydroxyphenyl acetate was more sensitive to base-catalysed hydrolysis than 4 '-fluorophenyl acetate. All together, 19 F NMR proved to be a valid method to evaluate the biological conversion of ring-substituted <b>acetophenones</b> to the corresponding phenyl acetates, which can serve as valuable synthons for further production of industrially relevant chemicals.

40|$|<b>Acetophenones</b> are a {{class of}} {{aromatic}} compounds frequently produced by plants {{as a response to}} a stress or as a protection reaction against parasites or herbivors. In the present research, we investigated the role of the carbonyl moiety in a series of commercially available aromatic ketones tested for their nematicidal activity against the root-knot nematode Meloidogyne incognita (Kofoid et White) Chitwood. Interestingly, we found that the presence of electron withdrawing groups onto the aromatic ring were highly efficient in inducing nematode paralysis and death (EC 50 / 24 h between 2. 5 and 54. 8 mg/L and EC 50 / 72 h between 2. 3 and 65. 6 mg/L, respectively).
