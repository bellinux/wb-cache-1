50|$|By 1955, Studebaker {{was forced}} to abandon <b>Automatic</b> <b>Drive</b> because of high {{production}} costs, {{replacing it with a}} less-expensive Borg Warner unit, ironically based on Ford's Ford-O-Matic, that Studebaker called Flight-O-Matic. Borg-Warner continued to build Studebaker's <b>Automatic</b> <b>Drive</b> and market the unit overseas. It was used on British marques including Jaguar, Daimler, Humber and Ford Zephyr/Zodiac.|$|E

50|$|When the V8-engined {{cars were}} {{introduced}} in 1970, the default transmission was the four-speed <b>automatic,</b> <b>driven</b> via a fluid coupling rather than the more usual torque converter. Buyers could still opt for a four-speed manual box, however, and benefitted from a price reduction if they did so. The 4.5 litre version (offered from 1971 {{but only in the}} United States), was fitted with a three-speed automatic box with a torque converter. This engine/transmission combination became more widely available when incorporated in the successor model.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{introduces}} <b>automatic</b> model <b>driven</b> animation, a novel {{approach to}} validate requirements specifications. This approach, here applied to SCR specifications, is based on graphical animation. <b>Automatic</b> model <b>driven</b> animation consists in automatically deriving scenarios from requirements specifications; these scenarios are used to animate critical system behaviors through a graphical interface. Animation is useful at the very early stages of systems development to better understand models and requirements, to gain confidence that specifications capture informal requirements, and to detect faults. We introduce a technique, exploiting model checkers, to automatically generate animation sequences starting from requirements specifications, and we present a prototype tool for the generation and animation of scenarios...|$|R

Studies of the formation and breakdown of 20 diverse empires operating over almost 3, 000 years describe these processes with utmost clarity and paradigmatic simplicity. Taking territorial expansion as the basic parameter, we show that it can be represented in time by a single logistic equation in spite of the complicated sequences of events usually reported by historians. The driving forces of empire, leading to expansion and saturation at 14 days of travel from the capital, can be reduced to testosterone and progesterone...|$|R

A laser beam is used to detect people jumping on the track which is connected to a light dependent resistor to send signal to control room of the station and the train arriving on that platform. Simple encoded transmitter and receiver are used to design the system. The design not only deals with stopping the train in such cases but also catching the people on an <b>automatic</b> <b>driven</b> mechanical tray.

5000|$|But 1950 saw the “Next Look in Cars" [...] — Studebaker’s {{answer to}} the other {{manufacturers}} 1949 models. Considered very radical for the era, it had 3-point front styling (called the “bullet-nose” by some). Over 10,000 more Land Cruisers were sold in 1950 than in 1949. Studebaker <b>Automatic</b> <b>Drive</b> was introduced mid-year and was arguably the most advanced automatic transmission of the day. It featured reverse gear lock-out, hill-holder, anti-creep and a locking torque converter which allowed direct drive with virtually no converter power loss in high gear. The price of the 1950 Land Cruiser went down to $2187.|$|E
50|$|The {{original}} convertible coupe prototype had {{an incredibly}} awkward-looking body that allowed Green {{to enter and}} exit the vehicle without stooping - the windshield was purportedly 7 feet tall. However, two additional prototypes were built with more normal bodies - a brougham and a sedan - {{that would have been}} more palatable to prospective clients. Green sunk over $1,000,000 into the project, and the idea of building a taxicab using the system was toyed with. However the entire project was shelved by all parties involved when it became apparent the Depression wasn’t going away. However, Colonel Green did get his custom-built <b>automatic</b> <b>drive</b> automobile, albeit only one example.|$|E

5000|$|Chrysler was {{the last}} of Detroit's Big Three {{automakers}} to introduce a fully automatic transmission, some 14 years after General Motors had introduced Oldsmobile's Hydramatic automatic transmission and nearly three years after Ford's Ford-O-Matic. Packard's Ultramatic debuted in 1949, and Studebaker's <b>Automatic</b> <b>Drive</b> was introduced in 1950. The PowerFlite was simple in its construction and operation, with fewer parts than competing transmissions. It was also quite durable, being used behind every Chrysler Corporation engine from the lowly Plymouth Six to the Imperial's Hemi V-8. Unlike most other automatic transmissions, PowerFlite did not feature a [...] "Park" [...] range, making it necessary to use the handbrake whenever the car was parked. All Chrysler products at the time had a parking brake independent from the vehicle's wheel brakes, a single brake drum mounted on the driveshaft, just behind the transmission. This had the (intended) effect of locking both rear wheels {{in the same way that}} the [...] "Park" [...] setting did in other transmissions.|$|E
