5|$|Rani Mukerji (born 21 March 1978) is an Indian actress. She has won several awards, {{including}} seven Filmfare Awards. Her film roles {{have been}} cited as <b>a</b> <b>significant</b> <b>departure</b> <b>from</b> the traditional portrayal of women in Bollywood.|$|E
5|$|In <b>a</b> <b>significant</b> <b>departure</b> <b>from</b> {{conventional}} practice, {{the tables}} are not based on a bottom time defined as time of leaving the surface to time leaving the bottom, but on time to reach a depth of 6m during the ascent.|$|E
5|$|Design work on {{the class}} began in 1892 and lasted until 1894. The ships of the Kaiser Friedrich III class marked <b>a</b> <b>significant</b> <b>departure</b> <b>from</b> the {{previous}} s. Influenced by the Japanese cruisers' victory over a heavier-armed Chinese fleet at the Battle of Yalu, heavy-caliber guns designed to penetrate armor were abandoned and replaced with smaller quick-firing guns. These guns were intended to raze the superstructure of enemy battleships and demoralize the crew. The propulsion system was improved and reorganized to incorporate a third propeller shaft. The armor system, however, remained similar to that employed on the Brandenburgs.|$|E
50|$|Drop Out of Life was {{met with}} mostly {{positive}} review from critics. Thomas Nassiff from AbsolutePunk notes how it is <b>a</b> <b>significant</b> <b>departure</b> in sound <b>from</b> the band's previous album, Road Maps and Heart Attacks.|$|R
5000|$|The {{influence}} of constructivist theory on instructional design became more {{prominent in the}} 1990s as a counterpoint to the more traditional cognitive learning theory. Constructivists believe that learning experiences should be [...] "authentic" [...] and produce real-world learning environments that allow the learner to construct their own knowledge. This emphasis on the learner was <b>a</b> <b>significant</b> <b>departure</b> away <b>from</b> traditional forms of instructional design.|$|R
50|$|In <b>a</b> <b>significant</b> design <b>departure</b> <b>from</b> {{previous}} Aeronca aircraft, the strut-braced {{wings of}} the Sedan are all-metal assemblies. Such combinations of construction types were not common. While the Sedan mated a fabric-covered fuselage to all-metal wings, the contemporary Cessna 170 mated an all-metal fuselage to fabric-covered wings. Also unique to the Sedan, among Aeronca designs, are the single-piece wing struts.|$|R
5|$|The Adventure of Link is {{a direct}} sequel to the {{original}} The Legend of Zelda, again involving the protagonist, Link, on a quest to save Princess Zelda, who has fallen under a sleeping spell. The Adventure of Links emphasis on side-scrolling and role-playing elements, however, was <b>a</b> <b>significant</b> <b>departure</b> <b>from</b> its predecessor. , the game remains the only technical sequel to the original title, as all other entries in the series either are prequels or take place in an alternative reality, according to the official Zelda timeline.|$|E
5|$|Lacker was {{instrumental}} in convincing Presley to record with Memphis producer Chips Moman and his handpicked musicians at American Sound Studio in early 1969. The American Sound sessions represented <b>a</b> <b>significant</b> <b>departure</b> <b>from</b> the control customarily exerted by Hill and Range. Moman still {{had to deal with}} the publisher's staff on site, whose song suggestions he regarded as unacceptable. He was on the verge of quitting, until Presley ordered the Hill and Range personnel out of the studio. Although RCA executive Joan Deary was later full of praise for the producer's song choices and the quality of the recordings, Moman, to his fury, received neither credit on the records nor royalties for his work.|$|E
5|$|The {{demobilisation}} of the Australian military {{following the}} end of the Second World War was completed in 1947. Plans for post-war defence arrangements were predicated on maintaining a relatively strong peacetime force. It was envisioned that the Royal Australian Navy maintaining a fleet that would include two light fleet carriers, two cruisers, six destroyers, 16 others ships in commission and another 52 in reserved. The Royal Australian Air Force would have a strength of 16 squadrons, including four manned by the Citizen Air Force. Meanwhile, in <b>a</b> <b>significant</b> <b>departure</b> <b>from</b> past Australian defence policy which had previously relied on citizen forces, the Australian Army would include a permanent field force of 19,000 regulars organised into a brigade of three infantry battalions with armoured support, serving alongside a part-time force of 50,000 men in the Citizen Military Forces. The Australian Regular Army was subsequently formed on 30 September 1947, while the CMF was re-raised on 1 July 1948.|$|E
5000|$|Although Cynic were {{associated}} with the Florida death metal scene, Focus represented <b>a</b> <b>significant</b> <b>departure</b> musically <b>from</b> Death's Human and the early Cynic demo-tapes. It was therefore a hard album to market. Cynic found themselves touring to promote the album with brutal death metal band Cannibal Corpse and predictably received a mixed reception from their fans. When asked in an interview about the success of the 2007 reunion tour, Masvidal said: ...|$|R
50|$|For {{the most}} part, {{traditional}} patterns prevailed {{when it came}} to the distribution of electorates - National performed best in rural areas, while Labour was strongest in the cities. <b>A</b> very <b>significant</b> <b>departure</b> <b>from</b> traditional patterns, however, was New Zealand First's capture of all five Maori seats, which had traditionally been Labour strongholds. Although Labour was to reclaim these seats in the subsequent election, Labour's monopoly was no longer so secure as it had been.|$|R
50|$|Depending on the country, the CISG can {{represent}} <b>a</b> small or <b>significant</b> <b>departure</b> <b>from</b> local legislation {{relating to the}} sale of goods, and in this can provide important benefits to companies from one contracting state that import goods into other states that have ratified the CISG.|$|R
25|$|William Gibson depicts Kempe as a moody tragedian in his 1968 play A Cry of Players, <b>a</b> <b>significant</b> <b>departure</b> <b>from</b> Kempe's actual {{performance}} style.|$|E
25|$|The Republican Party {{nominated}} Phil Metschan to take Joseph's {{place on}} the ballot. Metschan, who had not run in the primary, opposed public power utilities, <b>a</b> <b>significant</b> <b>departure</b> <b>from</b> Joseph's platform.|$|E
25|$|Aquinas, {{father of}} Thomism, was immensely {{influential}} in Catholic Europe, placed a great emphasis on reason and argumentation, {{and was one}} of the first to use the new translation of Aristotle's metaphysical and epistemological writing. His work was <b>a</b> <b>significant</b> <b>departure</b> <b>from</b> the Neoplatonic and Augustinian thinking that had dominated much of early Scholasticism.|$|E
50|$|A coupe {{was added}} in 1998 for the 1999 model year, {{and then a}} {{convertible}} form in 1999 for the 2000 model year. In contrast to the coupe from the third-generation Camrys, the new two-door cars were given a separate nameplate Toyota Camry Solara, or simply Solara. They were also <b>a</b> <b>significant</b> styling <b>departure</b> <b>from</b> the sedan. The Solara was available in SE and SLE trims, corresponding roughly to the sedan's LE and XLE trims.|$|R
5000|$|Sons of the Desert {{exited the}} label and broke up. Drew Womack {{recorded}} a solo album for Smith Music Group in 2003 which featured several {{contributions from the}} band's other members, and a re-recording of [...] "Leaving October". In 2012, Womack released his first solo album in nearly a decade, Sunshine to Rain, following surgery to rebuild a vertebrae in his spine. The album is <b>a</b> <b>significant</b> musical <b>departure</b> <b>from</b> his previous work.|$|R
25|$|Producers Roy Huggins and Stephen J. Cannell {{devised the}} Rockford {{character}} as <b>a</b> rather <b>significant</b> <b>departure</b> <b>from</b> typical television detectives of the time, essentially Bret Maverick {{as a modern}} detective. Rockford had served time in California's San Quentin Prison in the 1960s due to a wrongful conviction. After five years, he was pardoned. His infrequent jobs as a private investigator barely allow him to maintain his dilapidated mobile home (which doubles as his office) {{in a parking lot}} on a Malibu, California beach.|$|R
25|$|By {{reducing}} or eliminating decades-long social programs, {{while at}} the same time lowering taxes and marginal tax rates, Reagan's approach to handling the economy marked <b>a</b> <b>significant</b> <b>departure</b> <b>from</b> that of many of his predecessor's Keynesian policies. Milton Friedman, the monetarist economist who was an intellectual architect of free-market policies, was a primary influence on Reagan.|$|E
25|$|The Kouilou, in {{addition}} to being a land of immigration, is also a land of emigration and expatriation during colonization. The creation of coffee and cocoa plantations in Fernando Po and Sao Tomé, Portage, schooling and the prospect of receiving a salary cause <b>a</b> <b>significant</b> <b>departure</b> <b>from</b> the local labour force towards Brazzaville, Gabon and Ubangi-Shari.|$|E
25|$|Also in 2002, Akita {{released}} Merzbeat, {{which was}} seen as <b>a</b> <b>significant</b> <b>departure</b> <b>from</b> his trademark abstract style in that it contains beat-oriented pieces. This has sparked some controversy among fans, though some reviewers pointed out that it sounded very similar to Aqua Necromancer (1998) which features samples of progressive rock drumming. Merzbird (2004) and Merzbuddha (2005) followed {{in a similar vein}} with sampled beats combined with Merzbow's signature harsh noise.|$|E
25|$|In August 1985, a French {{proposal}} that would have seen Mirage IVPs stationed at air bases inside neighbouring West German was made public; this deployment would have marked <b>a</b> <b>significant</b> philosophical <b>departure</b> <b>from</b> traditional French nuclear defence policy. Aviation authors Bill Gunston and Peter Gilchrist allege that French officials had historically discounted the option of recovering Mirage IVs at friendly territory as unduly optimistic, as those nations might become unfriendly or hostile {{in the aftermath of}} a French nuclear attack.|$|R
5000|$|In 1993 Jani Lane {{started working}} on his first solo project, titled [...] "Jabberwocky," [...] the album {{represented}} <b>a</b> <b>significant</b> musical <b>departure</b> <b>from</b> previous work but continued to be pushed back. Between 1997 and 2000, demos of Lane's solo material began surfacing on the Internet, with some bids on eBay reaching an estimated $US100.00 per copy.In 2002 Lane decided to postpone the [...] "Jabberwocky" [...] project and instead release a brand new project as his debut solo album. The [...] "Jabberwocky" [...] project remained unreleased.|$|R
50|$|June 2007 was {{the release}} of their second {{full-length}} album, KJ2 Zukkoke Dai Dassō. The album was <b>a</b> <b>significant</b> <b>departure</b> in sound <b>from</b> their first release, focusing the funk and rock side of things, but still didn't stop record sales as it had debut number-one on the Oricon and number-two overall {{for the month of}} June.|$|R
25|$|Simple Minds' second release, Real to Real Cacophony was <b>a</b> <b>significant</b> <b>departure</b> <b>from</b> the pop tunes of Life in a Day. The album had {{a darker}} {{and far more}} {{experimental}} atmosphere, announcing {{some of the new}} wave experimentation that became the band’s trademark sound over the next two albums. Much of the album was written in the studio, although Simple Minds had been playing early versions of several tracks during the recent tour dates.|$|E
25|$|Shostakovich {{confined}} himself {{largely to}} reorchestrating the opera, and was more {{respectful of the}} composer's unique melodic and harmonic style. However, Shostakovich greatly increased {{the contributions of the}} woodwind and especially brass instruments to the score, <b>a</b> <b>significant</b> <b>departure</b> <b>from</b> the practice of Mussorgsky, who exercised great restraint in his instrumentation, preferring to utilize the individual qualities of these instruments for specific purposes. Shostakovich also aimed for a greater symphonic development, wanting the orchestra to do more than simply accompany the singers.|$|E
25|$|A {{significant}} change from previous versions of IIS {{is that all}} web server configuration information is stored solely in XML configuration files, instead of in the metabase. The server has a global configuration file that provides defaults, and each virtual web's document root (and any subdirectory thereof) may contain a web.config containing settings that augment or override the defaults. Changes to these files take effect immediately. This marks <b>a</b> <b>significant</b> <b>departure</b> <b>from</b> previous versions whereby web interfaces, or machine administrator access, was required to change simple settings such as default document, active modules, and security/authentication.|$|E
40|$|The bat fauna of 25 Antillean islands is {{presented}} as a species presence-absence matrix, and used to construct a large population of randomized null-model matrices by Monte-Carlo simulation techniques. Comparison of the observed data matrix with the randomized population reveals <b>a</b> statistically <b>significant</b> <b>departure</b> <b>from</b> randomness which is interpreted as evidence of community structure. The Antillean bat fauna is marked by a pattern of high species co-occurrence, with endemics dominating in the northern Antilles and undifferentiated South American taxa dominating in the southern Antilles. The 2 ̆ 7 checkerboard 2 ̆ 7 distributions which have been identified in the bird populations of some tropical archipelagos are absent in Antillean bat fauna...|$|R
2500|$|The M26 was the {{culmination}} of a series of medium tank prototypes that began with the T20 in 1942 and represented <b>a</b> <b>significant</b> design <b>departure</b> <b>from</b> the previous line of U.S. Army tanks that had ended with the M4 Sherman; a number of design features were tested in the various prototypes, some of which were experimental dead-ends, but many of which would become permanent characteristics of subsequent modern U.S. Army tanks. The prototype series began as a medium tank upgrade of the M4 Sherman and ended as the U.S. Army's first operational [...] "heavy" [...] tank.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Calpain 3 {{is known}} as the {{skeletal}} muscle– specific member of the calpains, a family of intracellular nonlysosomal cysteine proteases. It was previously shown that defects in the human calpain 3 gene are responsible for limb girdle muscular dystrophy type 2 A (LGMD 2 A), an inherited disease affecting predominantly the proximal limb muscles. To better understand the function of calpain 3 and the pathophysiological mechanisms of LGMD 2 A and also to develop an adequate model for therapy research, we generated capn 3 deficient mice by gene targeting. capn 3 -deficient mice are fully fertile and viable. Allele transmission in intercross progeny demonstrated <b>a</b> statistically <b>significant</b> <b>departure</b> <b>from</b> Mendel’s law. capn 3 -deficient mic...|$|R
25|$|The {{film was}} remade as the 1977 {{television}} movie It Happened One Christmas. Lionel Chetwynd based the screenplay {{on the original}} Van Doren Stern short story and the 1946 screenplay. This remake employed gender-reversal, with Marlo Thomas as the protagonist Mary Bailey, Wayne Rogers as George Hatch, and Cloris Leachman as the angel Clara Oddbody. Leachman received her second Emmy nomination for this role. In <b>a</b> <b>significant</b> <b>departure</b> <b>from</b> his earlier roles, Orson Welles was cast as Mr. Potter. Following initial positive reviews, the made-for-television film was rebroadcast twice in 1978 and 1979, but has not been shown since on national re-broadcasts, nor issued in home media.|$|E
25|$|In many ways, Otso was <b>a</b> <b>significant</b> <b>departure</b> <b>from</b> the {{traditional}} Finnish icebreaker design. The extended bridge wings {{on top of}} the stylish superstructure feature full-depth all-round windows that provide almost 360 degree visibility from the main steering position, which has been moved to the starboard bridge wing from the centerline. Furthermore, {{the traditional}} colours dating back to the Imperial Russian era, yellow and black, were replaced with the colors of the flag of Finland, blue and white. Due to the extensive use of advanced automation, which allowed everything ranging from starting and stopping the main engines to raising and lowering the flag to be done remotely from the bridge, Otso had the smallest crew among Finnish state-owned icebreakers when she entered service in 1986. Later her crew has been further reduced to 20. Otso was also the first icebreaker in which the lifeboats, unusable in ice-infested waters, were replaced with inflatable life rafts that could be lowered on the ice.|$|E
25|$|Of the Blue Colour of the Sky is {{the third}} studio album by American rock band OK Go. It was {{released}} on January 12, 2010 on Capitol Records in the USA and EMI in the UK, and re-released on the band's independent label Paracadute Records on April 1. The album was produced by Dave Fridmann and was recorded in a span of seven months at Fridmann's Tarbox Road Studios in Cassadaga, New York. The album's name, lyrics, and concept are based on The Influence of the Blue Ray of the Sunlight and of the Blue Colour of the Sky, a pseudoscientific book published in 1876. Its style was noted as <b>a</b> <b>significant</b> <b>departure</b> <b>from</b> the power pop of their earlier albums. After the band's split with EMI and Capitol, Paracadute took over the promotional campaign and all distribution responsibilities. The album received generally positive reviews from music critics upon release and debuted at number 40 on Billboard 200 chart.|$|E
25|$|Although {{the film}} is a period piece, set in the 1920s, the Academy Award-winning {{original}} soundtrack composed by Vangelis uses a modern 1980s electronic sound, with a strong use of synthesizer and piano among other instruments. This was <b>a</b> bold and <b>significant</b> <b>departure</b> <b>from</b> earlier period films, which employed sweeping orchestral instrumentals. The title theme of the film has become iconic, and {{has been used in}} subsequent films and television shows during slow-motion segments.|$|R
5000|$|With {{consists}} {{mostly of}} dance-pop songs and ballads. In {{an interview for}} B-Pass magazine, Tohoshinki described With as an enduring and long-lasting album, with songs that can pass through time without seeming outdated. Unlike the electropop influences heard in their last few records, the dance-pop songs recorded in With adopted more retro sounds from disco, jazz, and soul. The laid-back feel of the album puts With as <b>a</b> <b>significant</b> musical <b>departure</b> <b>from</b> Tohoshinki's earlier works, which were described as [...] "intense and aggressive dance music" [...] by the duo. The album's title represents Tohoshinki's wishes to stay together and form a closer connection with their fans.|$|R
50|$|Fear Not, {{published}} by Turnstone Press in 2008, {{is a collection}} of poems that parody the self-help topics in the Gideon Bible. The poems intermingle biblical passages with contemporary self-help and advertising language. Poems are based upon the directory {{at the end of the}} Gideon Bible that suggests readings based on the readers state of mind, such as “Tempted to Lie”. Although based on the Gideon Bible the subject matter of the poems often diverge to reference pop culture, the holocaust and his family. Formally, this book represents <b>a</b> <b>significant</b> stylistic <b>departure</b> <b>from</b> his first book,Ending with Music. The poems are set up in two columns, like the King James Bible but use traditional formal shapes of English poetry (sonnet, sestina, nonce form).|$|R
