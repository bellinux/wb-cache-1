The volatile state of the Hawaiian volcanoes and their constant battle with the sea was a major element in Hawaiian mythology, embodied in Pele, the deity of volcanoes. After the arrival of Europeans on the island, in 1880–1881 James Dwight Dana directed the first formal geological study of the hotspot's volcanics, confirming the relationship long observed by the natives. 1912 marked the founding of the Hawaiian Volcano Observatory by volcanologist Thomas Jaggar, initiating continuous scientific observation of the islands.

5|$|As {{each region}} {{has its own}} {{traditional}} pattern, batiks are commonly distinguished by the region they originated in, such as batik Solo, batik Pekalongan, and batik Madura.

Batiks which do not fall neatly {{into one of these}} two categories are only referred to by their region. <b>A</b> <b>mapping</b> of batik designs from all places in Indonesia depicts the similarities and reflects cultural assimilation within batik designs.|$|E
5|$|The {{generalized}} Euclidean algorithm {{requires a}} Euclidean function, i.e., <b>a</b> <b>mapping</b> f from R into {{the set of}} nonnegative integers such that, for any two nonzero elements a and b in R, there exist q and r in R such that a = qb + r and f(r) < f(b). An example of this mapping is the norm function used to order the Gaussian integers above. The function f can be {{the magnitude of the}} number, or the degree of a polynomial. The basic principle is that each step of the algorithm reduces f inexorably; hence, if f can be reduced only a finite number of times, the algorithm must stop in a finite number of steps. This principle relies heavily on the natural well-ordering of the non-negative integers; roughly speaking, this requires that every non-empty set of non-negative integers has a smallest member.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. In this paper, we {{investigate}} topological watersheds [1]. One of our main results {{is a necessary}} and sufficient condition for <b>a</b> <b>map</b> G to be a watershed of <b>a</b> <b>map</b> F, this condition {{is based on a}} notion of extension. A consequence of the theorem is that there exists a (greedy) polynomial time algorithm to decide whether <b>a</b> <b>map</b> G is <b>a</b> watershed of <b>a</b> <b>map</b> F or not. We introduce a notion of “separation between two points ” of an image which leads to a second necessary and sufficient condition. We also show that, given an arbitrary total order on the minima of <b>a</b> <b>map,</b> it is possible to define a notion of “degree of separation of a minimum ” relative to this order. This leads to a third necessary and sufficient condition for <b>a</b> <b>map</b> G to be a watershed of <b>a</b> <b>map</b> F.
