500|$|Allan Bakke {{applied to}} UC Davis medical school again in 1974.

[...] Lowrey gave Bakke a poor evaluation, the only part of his application on which {{he did not have a}} high score. He was rejected again, although minorities were admitted in both years with significantly lower academic scores through the special program. Not all minority applicants whose admission was recommended under the program gained entry—some were rejected by the <b>admissions</b> <b>committee.</b> [...] This, however, did not affect the number of minority students to be admitted, sixteen. Although 272 white people between 1971 and 1974 had applied under this program, none had been successful; in 1974 the special <b>admissions</b> <b>committee</b> summarily rejected all white students who asked for admission under the program. Only one black student and six Latinos were admitted under the regular admissions program in that time period, though significant numbers of Asian students were given entry.|$|E

500|$|Bakke {{complained to}} Dr. George Lowrey, {{chairman}} of the <b>admissions</b> <b>committee</b> at the medical school, about the special admissions program. [...] At Lowrey's request, Assistant Dean Peter Storandt told Bakke his candidacy had come close and encouraged him to reapply. [...] If he was not accepted the second time, “he could then research the legal question. [...] He {{had been a good}} candidate. [...] I thought he’d be accepted and that would end the matter.” [...] Storandt also gave Bakke the names of two lawyers interested in the issue of affirmative action. The general counsel for the University of California said, “I don’t think Storandt meant to injure the university. [...] It’s simply an example of a non-lawyer advising on legal matters.” [...] Storandt stated, “I simply gave Allan the response you’d give an irate customer, to try and cool his anger. [...] I realized the university might be vulnerable to legal attack because of its quota, and I had the feeling by then that somebody somewhere would sue the school, but I surely didn’t know this would be the case.” Storandt was demoted and later left the university. According to Bernard Schwartz in his account of the Bakke case, Storandt was fired.|$|E

2500|$|The Echols Scholars {{program was}} created in 1960 as {{an answer to the}} soaring numbers {{introduced}} by the GI Bill. The Faculty Senate decided to create a program that would provide [...] "ambitious academic privileges to students". The program was designed to attract applicants deemed by the <b>admissions</b> <b>committee</b> to comprise the very top academic echelon of the prospective incoming class; the significant academic freedoms and other benefits afforded the small selection of applicants honored with the offer of an Echols Scholarship was meant to entice students likely to be accepted into Ivy League and other top schools to choose UVA in their stead. These privileges include living in an exclusive dorm first year, exemption from area requirements, an exclusive counseling program, an interdisciplinary major, and others. Echols Scholars are not selected through a separate admissions application process; rather, all applicants are automatically reviewed for Echols status during the general admissions process. For enrolled students not originally accepted with the Echols distinction, the school offers an additional first-year application program in which students enrolled in challenging classes are invited to apply. If accepted, they are then allowed to join the Echols Scholars Program {{for the rest of their}} tenure at the University.|$|E
