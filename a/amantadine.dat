5|$|Other {{drugs such}} as <b>amantadine</b> and anticholinergics may be useful as {{treatment}} of motor symptoms. However, the evidence supporting them lacks quality, so they are not first choice treatments. In addition to motor symptoms, PD {{is accompanied by a}} diverse range of symptoms. A number of drugs have been used to treat some of these problems. Examples are the use of quetiapine for psychosis, cholinesterase inhibitors for dementia, and modafinil for daytime sleepiness.|$|E
5|$|Tetrabenazine was {{approved}} in 2008 {{for treatment of}} chorea in Huntington's disease in the US. Other drugs that help to reduce chorea include neuroleptics and benzodiazepines. Compounds such as <b>amantadine</b> or remacemide are still under investigation but have shown preliminary positive results. Hypokinesia and rigidity, especially in juvenile cases, can be treated with antiparkinsonian drugs, and myoclonic hyperkinesia can be treated with valproic acid.|$|E
5|$|Fatigue: fatigue is {{very common}} and {{disabling}} in MS, {{and at the same}} time it has a close relationship with depressive symptomatology. When depression is reduced fatigue also tends to improve, so patients should be evaluated for depression before other therapeutic approaches are used. In a similar way, other factors such as disturbed sleep, chronic pain, poor nutrition, or even some medications can contribute to fatigue; medical professionals are therefore encouraged to identify and modify them. A few medications have been studied to treat MS-related fatigue, such as <b>amantadine</b> pemoline (which is a psychostimulant also used for attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder and narcolepsy), or modafinil, as well as psychological interventions of energy conservation, but the effects of all of them are small. Fatigue is therefore a very difficult symptom to manage for which no drugs are recommended.|$|E

25|$|All medical {{applications}} known so far involve not pure adamantane, but its derivatives. The first adamantane derivative {{used as a}} drug was <b>amantadine</b> – first (1967) as an antiviral drug against various strains of flu and then to treat Parkinson's disease. Other drugs among adamantane derivatives include adapalene, adapromine, <b>amantadine,</b> bromantane, carmantadine, chlodantane, dopamantine, memantine, rimantadine, saxagliptin, tromantadine, and vildagliptin. Polymers of adamantane have been patented as antiviral agents against HIV.|$|E
25|$|Influenza virus strains have {{developed}} drug resistance to <b>amantadine</b> and rimantadine, {{which are not}} effective against prevalent strains as of 2016.|$|E
25|$|Measured {{resistance}} to the standard antiviral drugs <b>amantadine</b> and rimantadine in H3N2 has increased from 1% in 1994 to 12% in 2003 to 91% in 2005.|$|E
25|$|The {{dominant}} {{strain of}} annual flu in January 2006 is H3N2. Measured {{resistance to the}} standard antiviral drugs <b>amantadine</b> and rimantadine in H3N2 has increased from 1% in 1994 to 12% in 2003 to 91% in 2005.|$|E
25|$|Patients who are {{vaccinated against}} {{streptococcus}} pneumoniae, health professionals, nursing-home residents and pregnant {{women should be}} vaccinated annually against influenza. During an outbreak, drugs such as <b>amantadine,</b> rimantadine, zanamivir and oseltamivir have been demonstrated to prevent influenza.|$|E
25|$|In a {{case study}} by Gondim et al. 2010, a seventy–seven-year-old woman with Parkinson's disease (PD) was {{administered}} <b>amantadine</b> {{after a year of}} various other antiparkinsonian treatments. Two days into her treatment, she started to experience musical hallucinations, which consisted of four musical pieces. The music persisted until three days after cessation of the drug. Although the patient was taking other medications at the same time, the timing of onset and offset suggested that <b>amantadine</b> either had a synergistic effect with the other drugs or simply caused the hallucinations. Although the case wasn't specific to intoxication, it leads to the idea that persons with PD who are treated with certain drugs can experience musical hallucinations.|$|E
25|$|There are {{two groups}} of {{antiviral}} drugs available for the treatment and prophylaxis of influenza neuraminidase inhibitors such as Oseltamivir (trade name Tamiflu) and Zanamivir (trade name Relenza) as well as adamantanes such as <b>amantadine</b> and rimantadine. Due to {{the high rate of}} side effects and risk of antiviral resistance, use of adamantanes to fight influenza is limited.|$|E
25|$|It was {{established}} that the virus {{was a combination of}} human, North American swine, and Eurasian swine influenza viruses; the viruses from the initial two Californian cases were also noted to be resistant to <b>amantadine</b> and rimantadine, two common influenza antiviral drugs. No contact with pigs was found for any of the seven Californian nor either of the two Texas cases, suggesting human-to-human transmission of the virus.|$|E
25|$|Cabergoline, an agonist of {{dopamine}} D₂ receptors which inhibits prolactin production, {{was found}} in a small study to fully restore orgasm in one third of anorgasmic subjects, and partially restore orgasm in another third. Limited data has shown that the drug <b>amantadine</b> may help to relieve SSRI-induced sexual dysfunction. Cyproheptadine, buspirone, stimulants such as amphetamines (including the antidepressant bupropion), nefazodone and yohimbine have been used to treat SSRI-induced anorgasmia. Reducing the SSRI dosage may also resolve anorgasmia problems.|$|E
25|$|Some {{evidence}} indicates other {{drugs such as}} <b>amantadine</b> and anticholinergics may be useful as treatment of motor symptoms in early and late PD, but since the quality of evidence on efficacy is reduced, they are not first-choice treatments. In addition to motor symptoms, PD {{is accompanied by a}} range of different symptoms. Different compounds are used to improve some of these problems. Examples are the use of clozapine for psychosis, cholinesterase inhibitors for dementia, and modafinil for day somnolence.|$|E
25|$|However, {{when the}} antigenicities of the seed strains and wild viruses do not match, {{vaccines}} fail {{to protect the}} vaccinees. In addition, {{even when they do}} match, escape mutants are often generated. Drugs available for the treatment of influenza include <b>Amantadine</b> and Rimantadine, which inhibit the uncoating of virions by interfering with M2, and Oseltamivir (marketed under the brand name Tamiflu), Zanamivir, and Peramivir, which inhibit the release of virions from infected cells by interfering with NA. However, escape mutants are often generated for the former drug and less frequently for the latter drug.|$|E
25|$|Influenza A virus subtype H3N2 is endemic in pigs in China, and {{has been}} {{detected}} in pigs in Vietnam, increasing fears {{of the emergence of}} new variant strains. The dominant strain of annual flu virus in January 2006 was H3N2, which is now resistant to the standard antiviral drugs <b>amantadine</b> and rimantadine. The possibility of H5N1 and H3N2 exchanging genes through reassortment is a major concern. If a reassortment in H5N1 occurs, it might remain an H5N1 subtype, or it could shift subtypes, as H2N2 did when it evolved into the Hong Kong Flu strain of H3N2.|$|E
25|$|The {{disease is}} {{characterized}} further by the gradual onset of defects in behavior and cognition, including dementia and speech impediments, {{beginning in the}} fourth or fifth decades of life. Death usually occurs within 10–20 years after a progressive worsening of symptoms. Caused by the Huntingtin gene, the disease eventually contributes to selective atrophy of the Caudate nucleus and Putamen, especially of GABAergic and acetylcholinergic neurons, with some additional degeneration of the frontal and temporal cortices of the brain. The disrupted signaling in the basal ganglia network is thought to cause the hyperkinesia. There is no known cure for Huntington’s Disease, yet there is treatment available to minimize the hyperkinetic movements. Dopamine blockers, such as haloperidol, tetrabenazine, and <b>amantadine,</b> are often effective in this regard.|$|E
25|$|If {{a person}} becomes sick with swine flu, {{antiviral}} drugs {{can make the}} illness milder and make the patient feel better faster. They may also prevent serious flu complications. For treatment, antiviral drugs work best if started soon after getting sick (within two days of symptoms). Beside antivirals, supportive care {{at home or in}} a hospital focuses on controlling fevers, relieving pain and maintaining fluid balance, as well as identifying and treating any secondary infections or other medical problems. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends the use of oseltamivir (Tamiflu) or zanamivir (Relenza) for the treatment and/or prevention of infection with swine influenza viruses; however, the majority of people infected with the virus make a full recovery without requiring medical attention or antiviral drugs. The virus isolated in the 2009 outbreak have been found resistant to <b>amantadine</b> and rimantadine.|$|E
25|$|Certain drugs {{increase}} the chances of déjà vu occurring in the user, resulting in a strong sensation that an event or experience currently being experienced has already been experienced in the past. Some pharmaceutical drugs, when taken together, have also been implicated {{in the cause of}} déjà vu. Taiminen and Jääskeläinen (2001) reported the case of an otherwise healthy male who started experiencing intense and recurrent sensations of déjà vu upon taking the drugs <b>amantadine</b> and phenylpropanolamine together to relieve flu symptoms. He found the experience so interesting that he completed the full course of his treatment and reported it to the psychologists to write up as a case study. Because of the dopaminergic action of the drugs and previous findings from electrode stimulation of the brain (e.g. Bancaud, Brunet-Bourgin, Chauvel, & Halgren, 1994), Taiminen and Jääskeläinen speculate that déjà vu occurs as a result of hyperdopaminergic action in the mesial temporal areas of the brain.|$|E

Other drugs used to lessen parkinsonian tremor include <b>amantadine</b> and anticholinergic drugs like benztropine ...|$|E
2500|$|Medications for fatigue, such as <b>amantadine</b> and pyridostigmine, {{have not}} {{been found to be}} {{effective}} in the management of PPS. Muscle strength and endurance training are more important in managing the symptoms of PPS than the ability to perform long aerobic activity. Management should focus on treatments such as hydrotherapy and developing other routines that encourage strength but do not affect fatigue levels. The recent trend is towards use of intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) which has yielded promising, albeit modest results, but [...] there is insufficient evidence to recommend it as a treatment.|$|E
2500|$|... roughly spherical. It is an enveloped virus; {{the outer}} layer is a lipid {{membrane}} which {{is taken from}} the host cell in which the virus multiplies. Inserted into the lipid membrane are [...] "spikes", which are proteins—actually glycoproteins, because they consist of protein linked to sugars—known as HA (hemagglutinin) and NA (neuraminidase). These are the proteins that determine the subtype of influenza virus (A/H1N1, for example). [...] The HA and NA are important in the immune response against the virus; antibodies (proteins made to combat infection) against these spikes may protect against infection. The NA protein is {{the target of the}} antiviral drugs Relenza and Tamiflu. Also embedded in the lipid membrane is the M2 protein, which is the target of the antiviral adamantanes <b>amantadine</b> and rimantadine.|$|E
2500|$|Animal and lab {{studies suggest}} that Relenza (zanamivir), {{which is in the}} same class of drugs as Tamiflu, may also be {{effective}} against H5N1. In a study performed on mice in 2000, [...] "zanamivir was shown to be efficacious in treating avian influenza viruses H9N2, H6N1, and H5N1 transmissible to mammals". In addition, mice studies suggest the combination of zanamivir, celecoxib and mesalazine looks promising producing a 50% survival rate compared to no survival in the placebo arm. While no one knows if zanamivir will be useful or not on a yet to exist pandemic strain of H5N1, it might be useful to stockpile zanamivir as well as oseltamivir {{in the event of an}} H5N1 influenza pandemic. Neither oseltamivir nor zanamivir can currently be manufactured in quantities that would be meaningful once efficient human transmission starts. In September, 2006, a WHO scientist announced that studies had confirmed cases of H5N1 strains resistant to Tamiflu and <b>Amantadine.</b> Tamiflu-resistant strains have also appeared in the EU, which remain sensitive to Relenza.|$|E
50|$|The anti-influenza virus drug, <b>amantadine,</b> is a {{specific}} blocker of the M2 H+ channel. In the presence of <b>amantadine,</b> viral uncoating is incomplete, and the RNP core fails to promote infection. Aminoadamantanes, including <b>amantadine</b> and rimantadine have been widely abandoned due to virus resistance, but thermodynamic considerations allow design of new derivatives.|$|E
50|$|In 2005, Chinese poultry {{farmers were}} {{reported}} to have used <b>amantadine</b> to protect birds against avian influenza. In Western countries and according to international livestock regulations, <b>amantadine</b> is approved only for use in humans. Chickens in China have received an estimated 2.6 billion doses of <b>amantadine.</b> Avian flu (H5N1) strains in China and southeast Asia are now resistant to <b>amantadine,</b> although strains circulating elsewhere still seem to be sensitive. If amantadine-resistant strains of the virus spread, the drugs of choice in an avian flu outbreak will probably be restricted to the scarcer and costlier oseltamivir and zanamivir, which work by a different mechanism and are less likely to trigger resistance.|$|E
50|$|Additional {{evidence}} for a role of BoDV-1 in psychiatric disorders comes from reports that the drug <b>amantadine,</b> {{which is used to}} treat influenza infections, has had some success in treating depression and clearing BoDV-1 infection. Counter-claims state that Borna virus infections are not cleared by <b>amantadine.</b> The issue is further {{complicated by the fact that}} <b>amantadine</b> is also used in the treatment of Parkinson's disease and may have direct effects on the nervous system.|$|E
50|$|In the 1960s, the adamantane {{derivative}} <b>amantadine</b> (1-aminoadamantane) {{was developed}} as {{an antiviral drug}} {{for the treatment of}} influenza. Other adamantane antivirals subsequently followed, such as rimantadine (1-(1-aminoethyl)adamantane) and adapromine (1-(1-aminopropyl)adamantane). It was serendipitously discovered in 1969 that <b>amantadine</b> possesses central dopaminergic psychostimulant-like properties, and subsequent investigation revealed that rimantadine and adapromine also possess such properties. <b>Amantadine</b> was then developed and introduced for the treatment of Parkinson's disease due to its ability to increase dopamine levels in the brain. It has also notably since been used to help alleviate fatigue in multiple sclerosis.|$|E
50|$|Excessive {{glutamate}} {{activity is}} believed to be involved in catatonia; when first-line treatment options fail, NMDA antagonists such as <b>amantadine</b> or memantine are used. <b>Amantadine</b> may have an increased incidence of tolerance with prolonged use and can cause psychosis, due to its additional effects on the dopamine system. Memantine has a more targeted pharmacological profile for the glutamate system, reduced incidence of psychosis and may therefore be preferred for individuals who cannot tolerate <b>amantadine.</b> Topiramate is another treatment option for resistant catatonia; it produces its therapeutic effects by producing glutamate antagonism via modulation of AMPA receptors.|$|E
50|$|Like rimantadine, <b>amantadine,</b> and adapromine, {{tromantadine}} is {{a derivative}} of adamantane.|$|E
