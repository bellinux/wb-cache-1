40|$|Glutamate {{racemase}} {{activity in}} Bacillus anthracis is of significant interest {{with respect to}} chemotherapeutic drug design, because l-glutamate stereoisomerization to d-glutamate is predicted to be closely associated with peptidoglycan and capsule biosynthesis, which are important for growth and virulence, respectively. In contrast to most bacteria, which harbor a single glutamate racemase gene, the genomic sequence of B. anthracis predicts two genes encoding glutamate racemases, <b>racE</b> 1 <b>and</b> <b>racE</b> 2. To evaluate whether <b>racE</b> 1 <b>and</b> <b>racE</b> 2 encode functional glutamate racemases, we cloned <b>and</b> expressed <b>racE</b> 1 <b>and</b> <b>racE</b> 2 in Escherichia coli. Size exclusion chromatography of the two purified recombinant proteins suggested differences in their quaternary structures, as RacE 1 eluted primarily as a monomer, while RacE 2 demonstrated characteristics of a higher-order species. Analysis of purified recombinant <b>RacE</b> 1 <b>and</b> <b>RacE</b> 2 revealed that the two proteins catalyze the reversible stereoisomerization of l-glutamate and d-glutamate with similar, but not identical, steady-state kinetic properties. Analysis of the pH dependence of l-glutamate stereoisomerization suggested that <b>RacE</b> 1 <b>and</b> <b>RacE</b> 2 both possess two titratable active site residues important for catalysis. Moreover, directed mutagenesis of predicted active site residues resulted in complete attenuation of the enzymatic activities of both <b>RacE</b> 1 <b>and</b> <b>RacE</b> 2. Homology modeling of <b>RacE</b> 1 <b>and</b> <b>RacE</b> 2 revealed potential differences within the active site pocket that might affect the design of inhibitory pharmacophores. These results suggest that <b>racE</b> 1 <b>and</b> <b>racE</b> 2 encode functional glutamate racemases with similar, but not identical, active site features...|$|R
5|$|The Straight Eight was {{the first}} car in series {{production}} in the United States with a straight-eight engine. The engine had a cast iron block, a detachable cast iron cylinder head, and an aluminum lower crankcase and oil pan. The crankshaft ran in three main bearings. While the prototype Straight Eight shown at the model's introduction had horizontal valves of the type used in earlier Duesenberg-designed marine <b>and</b> <b>racing</b> engines, the model that entered production had a shaft-driven single overhead camshaft which used rockers to operate two valves per cylinder in a hemispheric combustion chamber.|$|E
5|$|The Sunbeam Tiger is a {{high-performance}} V8 {{version of the}} British Rootes Group's Sunbeam Alpine roadster, designed in part by American car designer <b>and</b> <b>racing</b> driver Carroll Shelby and produced from 1964 until 1967. Shelby had carried out a similar V8 conversion on the AC Cobra, and hoped to be offered the contract to produce the Tiger at his facility in America. Rootes decided instead to contract the assembly work to Jensen at West Bromwich in England, and pay Shelby a royalty on every car produced.|$|E
5|$|A high {{accident}} rate may also occur because Thoroughbreds, {{particularly in the}} United States, are first raced as 2-year-olds, well before they are completely mature. Though they may appear full-grown and are in superb muscular condition, their bones are not fully formed. However, catastrophic injury rates are higher in 4- and 5-year-olds than in 2- and 3-year-olds. Some believe that correct, slow training of a young horse (including foals) may actually be beneficial to the overall soundness of the animal. This is because, during the training process, microfractures occur in the leg followed by bone remodeling. If the remodeling is given sufficient time to heal, the bone becomes stronger. If proper remodeling occurs before hard training <b>and</b> <b>racing</b> begins, the horse will have a stronger musculoskeletal system and will have a decreased chance of injury.|$|E
50|$|These {{bearings}} {{make use}} of both ceramic balls <b>and</b> <b>race.</b> These bearings are impervious to corrosion and rarely require lubrication if at all. Due to the stiffness and hardness of the balls <b>and</b> <b>race</b> these bearings are noisy at high speeds. The stiffness of the ceramic makes these bearings brittle and liable to crack under load or impact. Because both ball <b>and</b> <b>race</b> are of similar hardness wear can lead to chipping at high speeds of both the balls <b>and</b> the <b>race</b> this can cause sparking.|$|R

5|$|Conker's Bad Fur Day is an action-platform {{game where}} the player {{controls}} Conker the Squirrel {{through a series}} of three-dimensional levels. The game features an overworld where players can transition from one level to another, although many are initially blocked off until Conker earns a certain amount of cash. Each level is an enclosed area in which the player can freely explore to find tasks to do. The gameplay mostly relies on figuring out a way to help other characters by completing a linear sequence of challenges. These challenges may include defeating a boss, solving puzzles, gathering objects, <b>and</b> <b>racing</b> opponents, among others. The result is always a cash reward, which aids access to other areas in the overworld.|$|E

40|$|Background: A human {{proteome}} {{is relatively}} dynamic compared with its corresponding genome. Our {{aim was to}} study the heterogeneity of a human pituitary proteome {{as a function of}} gender, age, <b>and</b> <b>race.</b> Methods: Pituitary control tissues (n � 8) were used to extract proteins; each control tissue was analyzed (n � 3 – 5) with two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2 DGE) and PDQuest software. We obtained 30 high-resolution 2 DGE gels and conducted a comparative analysis as a function of gender, age, <b>and</b> <b>race.</b> Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry and liquid chromatography-electrospray ionizationquadrupole-ion trap tandem mass spectrometry were used to characterize the protein in each differential spot. Results: We detected � 1000 protein spots in each 2 DGE map, and 51 differential spots (7 differing with gender, 17 with age, 15 with <b>race,</b> <b>and</b> 12 with the coeffect of age <b>and</b> <b>race).</b> Among those 51, we characterized 28 proteins [5 differing with gender, 8 with age, 6 with race, 8 with the coeffect of age <b>and</b> <b>race,</b> <b>and</b> 1 (somatotropin chain 1) with all of these]. Somatotropin was related to gender, age, <b>and</b> <b>race,</b> <b>and</b> prolactin was higher in females than males. The differentially expressed proteins that were related to age were mainly those proteins associated with cell growth, proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis, and death; those proteins showed no difference with gender <b>and</b> <b>race.</b> Age <b>and</b> <b>race</b> affected some proteins associated with hormone regulation (e. g., follistatin, thyroid hormone receptor �- 2, adenylate cyclase-inhibiting G � protein). Conclusions: A heterogeneity exists in the human pituitary proteome as a function of gender, age, <b>and</b> <b>race.</b> ...|$|R
