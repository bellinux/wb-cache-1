5000|$|A [...] "lasagna cell" [...] is <b>accidentally</b> <b>produced</b> when salty moist food such as lasagna {{is stored}} in a steel baking pan and is covered with {{aluminum}} foil. After a few hours the foil develops small holes where it touches the lasagna, and the food surface becomes covered with small spots composed of corroded aluminum. In this example, the salty food (lasagna) is the electrolyte, the aluminum foil is the anode, and the steel pan is the cathode. If the aluminum foil only touches the electrolyte in small areas, the galvanic corrosion is concentrated, and corrosion can occur fairly rapidly. If an aluminum baking pan is used instead, the rate of corrosion is markedly reduced, but still may occur.|$|R

Left ventricular endocardial mapping <b>accidentally</b> <b>produced</b> a complete left bundle branch block and provoked prolongation of the QRS duration of VT, which was 143  ms. However, no changes occurred in the cycle length, inducibility, or maintenance of VT. The VT was eliminated successfully by catheter ablation at the pre-Purkinje potential (PP) recording site.

40|$|The {{information}} {{encoded in}} the polarization {{of a single}} photon can be transferred {{to a remote location}} by two-channel continuous-variable quantum teleportation. However, the finite entanglement used in the teleportation causes random changes in photon number. If more than one photon appears in the output, the continuous-variable teleportation <b>accidentally</b> <b>produces</b> clones of the original input photon. In this paper, we derive the polarization statistics of the $N$-photon output components and show that they can be decomposed into an optimal cloning term and completely unpolarized noise. We find that the accidental cloning of the input photon is nearly optimal at experimentally feasible squeezing levels, indicating that the loss of polarization information is partially compensated by the availability of clones.

40|$|A {{new class}} of quantum {{cryptography}} (QC) protocols that are robust against the most general photon number splitting attacks in a weak coherent pulse implementation has been recently proposed. In this article we give a quite exhaustive analysis of several eavesdropping attacks on these schemes. The eavesdropper (Eve) {{is supposed to have}} unlimited technological power while the honest parties (Alice and Bob) use present day technology, in particular an attenuated laser as an approximation of a single-photon source. They exploit the nonorthogonality of quantum states for decreasing the information accessible to Eve in the multi-photon pulses <b>accidentally</b> <b>produced</b> by the imperfect source. An implementation of some of these protocols using present day technology allow for a secure key distribution up to distances of ∼ 150 km.
