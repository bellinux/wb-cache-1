50|$|Algorithms used by {{assembly}} software {{are very}} diverse, {{and can be}} classified as based on iterative marker ordering, or graph based. Graph based applications {{have the capacity to}} order and orient over 10,000 markers, compared to the maximum 3000 markers capable of iterative marker applications. Algorithms can be further classified as greedy, non greedy, conservative, or non conservative. Bambus uses a greedy algorithm, defined as such because it joins together contigs with the most links first. The algorithm used by Bambus 2 removes repetitive contigs before orienting and ordering them into scaffolds. SSPACE also uses a greedy algorithm that begins building its first scaffold with the longest contig provided by the sequence data. SSPACE is the most commonly cited <b>assembly</b> <b>tool</b> in biology publications, likely {{due to the fact that}} it is rated as a significantly more intuitive program to install and run than other assemblers.|$|E

40|$|Metrology and Tooling are {{considered}} as discrete disciplines within Manufacturing Engineering, however, <b>assembly</b> <b>tooling</b> often {{acts as a}} checking mechanism. <b>Assembly</b> <b>tooling</b> has the primary function of controlling part location during assembly; with a secondary requirement as a quality gate. In-tool checks are manual mechanical checks of the assembly, these gauging checks assume the tooling has the correct, nominal geometry. Tooling conformance is certified periodically; however these intervals can be up to three years. Further examination of the metrology requirements within the aerospace industry with respect to large scale <b>assembly</b> <b>tooling</b> identify a requirement to: reduce manual metrology checks, reduce tooling recertification time, and enable greater automation. Currently, {{there is a lack}} of integration between metrology and Wing-box <b>assembly</b> <b>tooling.</b> This research investigates how to increase manufacturing confidence with respect to tooling conformance; and, ultimately improve the manufacturing process for aero-structures, through the increased and enhanced use of metrology in the <b>assembly</b> <b>tooling</b> environment. The Metrology Enhanced Tooling for Aerospace (META) framework has been created to provide a robust framework for deploying metrology in the tooling environment. The major elements of the framework are subsequently detailed and demonstrated in three chapters: i) large volume metrology networks, for the measurement of tooling structures; testing instrument performance, quantifying and improving the uncertainty estimation, and ultimately, establishing a rapid measurement process for assembly tooling; ii) embedded metrology systems demonstrates how local measurement systems can be utilised to replace and improve on, traditional in-tool checks; and iii) metrology feedback presents an example of an automated tooling pick-up that manipulates the assembly to achieve the design intent. The contributions can be summarised as: firstly, the creation of the META framework for the deployment of metrology in <b>assembly</b> <b>tooling</b> environment, accommodating and facilitating a number of the future <b>tooling</b> and <b>assembly</b> requirements. Secondly, the establishment of a generic commissioning methodology and measurement strategy for the rapid measurement of <b>assembly</b> <b>tooling</b> to increase tooling confidence.

Modern industries are adopting mass customization as a new strategy to handle the increasing diversity in customer demands. The main challenge is to produce an increasing variety of products with mass production efficiency.

RNA-seq has already been proven {{to be an important}} factor to research numerous incurable diseases like cancers. Like other high throughput technologies, it also produces a huge number of accurate but relatively short reads. So it remains a concerning issue for De Novo <b>assembly</b> <b>tools</b> to assemble this massive amount of short reads. Existing De Novo <b>assembly</b> <b>tools</b> to assemble RNA-seq data are developed mainly based on three different algorithms; Greedy, OLC, and Euler-path. Recent research has revealed that Euler-path approach works best for RNA-seq data. A few De Novo <b>assembly</b> <b>tools</b> are available nowadays that were developed using Euler-path approach. Most of these tools based on Euler-path can be used free of cost for non commercial purposes. However, the performance of these non-commercial usable tools varies under different criteria. Again, their performance has not been measured in all possible conditions. So, it is always a matter of concern, which tool should be used for a particular data.

40|$|RNA-Seq, or deep-sequencing of RNAs, {{is a new}} {{technology}} for transcriptome profiling using second generation sequencing. RNA-Seq has been widely used to identify and quantify transcriptomes at an unprecedented high resolution and low cost. An important computational problem arising from RNA-Seq is transcriptome assembly, in which the structures of transcripts (and their expression levels) are inferred simultaneously from RNA-Seq data. RNA-Seq transcriptome assembly allows {{for the detection of}} structural and quantitative changes of transcripts between samples, paving the way for novel biological discoveries. However, the problem of RNA-Seq transcriptome assembly is challenging because: (i) the complicated alternative splicing patterns of some genes result in a huge number of possible transcripts, (ii) different kinds of biases in RNA-Seq reads (including sequencing, positional and mappability biases) decrease the accuracy of assembly and expression level estimation algorithms, and (iii) the existing assembly tools can only reconstruct transcripts from a single sample, leading to a high false positive rate for comparing RNA-Seq experiments from multiple samples. We propose three different algorithms to address these challenges. First, we design a transcriptome <b>assembly</b> <b>tool,</b> IsoLasso, that balances different objectives (prediction accuracy, sparsity, interpretation) and takes advantage of the sparsity of expressed transcripts. Second, we use the quasi-multinomial distribution to model the RNA-Seq biases, and design a new algorithm, CEM, to handle different biases in both transcriptome assembly and transcript expression level estimation. Finally, we propose a multiple-sample transcriptome <b>assembly</b> <b>tool,</b> ISP, to assemble transcripts directly from RNA-Seq data of multiple samples. ISP reaches an improved performance compared to the assembly tools that consider one sample at a time, and helps to improve the accuracy of downstream differential analysis of transcriptomes between samples...|$|E
