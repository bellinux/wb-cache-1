5|$|<b>Another</b> <b>parameter</b> that {{measures}} {{the quality of}} a book embedding, beyond its number of pages, is its pagewidth. This is the maximum number of edges that can be crossed by a ray perpendicular to the spine within a single page. Equivalently (for book embeddings in which each edge is drawn as a monotonic curve), it is the maximum size of a subset of edges within a single page such that the intervals defined on the spine by pairs of endpoints of the edges all intersect each other.|$|E
5|$|Physical and {{chemical}} characteristics of volcanic ash are primarily {{controlled by the}} style of volcanic eruption. Volcanoes display a range of eruption styles which are controlled by magma chemistry, crystal content, temperature and dissolved gases of the erupting magma and can be classified using the volcanic explosivity index (VEI). Effusive eruptions (VEI 1) of basaltic composition produce <105 m3 of ejecta, whereas extremely explosive eruptions (VEI 5+) of rhyolitic and dacitic composition can inject large quantities (>109 m3) of ejecta into the atmosphere. <b>Another</b> <b>parameter</b> controlling the amount of ash produced is {{the duration of the}} eruption: the longer the eruption is sustained, the more ash will be produced. For example, {{the second phase of the}} 2010 eruptions of Eyjafjallajökull was classified as VEI 4 despite a modest 8 km high eruption column, but the eruption continued for a month, which allowed a large volume of ash to be ejected into the atmosphere.|$|E

50|$|The {{milling quality}} can be {{determined}} by two common parameters (i) total yield and (ii) head yield, also <b>another</b> <b>parameters</b> like degree of milling and broken rice are used to estimate milling quality an express in percentage By definition milling quality {{is the ability of}} rice kernels to stand milling and or polishing without breakage, and to yield higher amount of recovery.|$|R
25|$|<b>Another</b> <b>parameter</b> that {{concerns}} the thermal conductivity {{of the heat}} sink material is spreading resistance. Spreading resistance occurs when thermal energy is transferred from a small area to a larger area in a substance with finite thermal conductivity. In a heat sink, this means that heat does not distribute uniformly through the heat sink base. The spreading resistance phenomenon is shown by how the heat travels from the heat source location and causes a large temperature gradient between the heat source and {{the edges of the}} heat sink. This means that some fins are at a lower temperature than if the heat source were uniform across the base of the heat sink. This nonuniformity increases the heat sink's effective thermal resistance.|$|E
25|$|The pathwidth of a graph has a {{very similar}} {{definition}} to treewidth via tree decompositions, but is restricted to tree decompositions in which the underlying tree of the decomposition is a path graph. Alternatively, the pathwidth may be defined from interval graphs analogously {{to the definition of}} treewidth from chordal graphs. As a consequence, the pathwidth of a graph is always at least as large as its treewidth, but it can only be larger by a logarithmic factor. <b>Another</b> <b>parameter,</b> the graph bandwidth, has an analogous definition from proper interval graphs, and is at least as large as the pathwidth. Other related parameters include the tree-depth, a number that is bounded for a minor-closed graph family if and only if the family excludes a path, and the degeneracy, a measure of the sparsity of a graph that is at most equal to its treewidth.|$|E
2500|$|This {{suggests}} that we create a conditional prior of the mean on the unknown variance, with a hyperparameter specifying {{the mean of the}} pseudo-observations associated with the prior, and <b>another</b> <b>parameter</b> specifying the number of pseudo-observations. [...] This number serves as a scaling parameter on the variance, making it possible to control the overall variance of the mean relative to the actual variance parameter. [...] The prior for the variance also has two hyperparameters, one specifying the sum of squared deviations of the pseudo-observations associated with the prior, and another specifying once again the number of pseudo-observations. [...] Note that each of the priors has a hyperparameter specifying the number of pseudo-observations, and in each case this controls the relative variance of that prior. [...] These are given as two separate hyperparameters so that the variance (aka the confidence) of the two priors can be controlled separately.|$|E

2500|$|Support is the {{principle}} that describes how well the underlying mucosa (oral tissues, including gums) keeps the denture from moving vertically towards the arch in question during chewing, and thus being excessively depressed and moving deeper into the arch. [...] For the mandibular arch, this function is provided primarily by the buccal shelf, a region extending laterally from the back or posterior ridges, and by the pear-shaped pad (the most posterior area of keratinized gingival formed by the scaling down of the retro-molar papilla after the extraction of the last molar tooth). Secondary support for the complete mandibular denture {{is provided by the}} alveolar ridge crest. The maxillary arch receives primary support from the horizontal hard palate and the posterior alveolar ridge crest. [...] The larger the denture flanges (that part of the denture that extends into the vestibule), the better the stability (<b>another</b> <b>parameter</b> to assess fit of a complete denture). [...] Long flanges beyond the functional depth of the sulcus are a common error in denture construction, often (but not always) leading to movement in function, and ulcerations (denture sore spots).|$|E
