The compound is derived from a novel form of the monopropellant oxalohydroxamic acid. The two exocyclic C-O bond lengths of 1. 240 (3) and 1. 228 (4) A indicate double bonds.

30|$|The {{absorption}} peak at 3421  cm− 1 observed in control extract, which {{is due to}} OH stretching vibration, gets wider and shifted to 3391  cm− 1. This peak was assigned to the N–H group from protein present in the control extract. The N–H vibrational bands become weaker and broader in the spectrum of stabilized Au nanoparticles. The IR bands at 1702 and 1622  cm− 1 are <b>characteristic</b> <b>of</b> <b>amide</b> I whereas the band at 1515  cm− 1 is <b>characteristic</b> <b>of</b> <b>amide</b> II, respectively [8, 42, 43]. In Fig.  2 b, the two IR peaks <b>of</b> <b>amide</b> I were merged in one peak centered at 1629  cm− 1. These structural changes indicated that the reduction and stabilization of gold nanoparticles proceed via the coordination between N <b>of</b> the <b>amide</b> group and gold ions. The FTIR studies have confirmed the fact that the amide group form proteins has the stronger ability to bind metal indicating that the proteins could possibly form a layer covering the metal nanoparticles (i.e., capping of gold nanoparticles) to prevent agglomeration and thereby stabilize the medium. Comparison between spectra of untreated sample to the treated samples Au-NPs reveal only minor changes in the positions {{as well as on the}} magnitude of the absorption bands; wave numbers varying typically about ± 1 to 15  cm− 1.|$|R

40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the sensitivity of}} femtosecond Fourier transform two-dimensional infrared spectroscopy to protein secondary structure with a study of antiparallel beta-sheets. The results show that 2 D IR spectroscopy is more sensitive to structural differences between proteins than traditional infrared spectroscopy, providing an observable that allows comparison to quantitative models of protein vibrational spectroscopy. 2 D IR correlation spectra <b>of</b> the <b>amide</b> I region <b>Of</b> poly-L-lysine, concanavalin A, ribonuclease A, and lysozyme show cross-peaks between the IR-active transitions that are <b>characteristic</b> <b>of</b> <b>amide</b> I couplings for polypeptides in antiparallel hydrogen-bonding registry. For poly-L-lysine, the 2 D IR spectrum contains the eight-peak structure expected for two dominant vibrations of an extended, ordered antiparallel beta-sheet. In the proteins with antiparallel beta-sheets, interference effects between the diagonal and crosspeaks arising from the sheets, combined with diagonally elongated resonances from additional amide transitions, lead to <b>a</b> <b>characteristic</b> "Z"-shaped pattern for the amide I region in the 2 D IR spectrum. We discuss in detail how the number of strands in the sheet, the local configurational disorder in the sheet, the delocalization of the vibrational excitation, and the angle between transition dipole moments affect the position, splitting, amplitude, and line shape of the cross-peaks and diagonal peaks...|$|R
