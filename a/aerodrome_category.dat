50|$|The rescue fire {{services}} {{are based on}} a critical aircraft based on a statistical analysis of movements (take-offs and landings) on the airport. The <b>aerodrome</b> <b>category</b> is based {{on the size of the}} biggest aircraft taking a movement on the aerodrome. In addition, the number of movements of the critical aircraft is calculated, and the category can be decreased by one if the number of movements is lower than the standard describes. For example, at an airport regularly handling Boeing 737 and Airbus A320 aircraft with a single Boeing 777 service per week, the airport fire service has to cater up to the ICAO category 7 of the 737 and A320; a single 777 movement per week does not justify a full ICAO category 9 fire service. There are also minimum category levels based on e.g. the number of seats in the critical aircraft.|$|E

50|$|The Namibia Airports Company (NAC) {{is in the}} {{planning}} stages of constructing a new airport complete with <b>aerodrome</b> classification of <b>category</b> 4F (of the International Aviation Organization (ICAO) Aerodrome Reference Code in terms of Annex 14 of ICAO). This new development would render the airport to accommodate multiple wide-bodied code F aircraft. This project would require a new runway, including taxiways/ aprons. The NAC envisages a newly constructed terminal building which would include separate VIP check-in/ ancillary facilities. A new traffic control tower and fire station would complete the project. A N$900m/78km dual carriageway is being constructed linking the airport to Windhoek.|$|R
