2500|$|Mr. Frazier's {{testimony}} [...] adds, [...] "Just <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>in</b> {{the case}} of Mr. Curly, my initial feeling was, when I first heard about this, that the facts had not been established and we needed to be careful {{to make sure we}} understood the facts. As I was in -- in that 48-hour time period read the grand jury presentment, I reached the conclusion that given what had become public about the issues leading up to the presentment and given what was said in the presentment itself about Coach Paterno's testimony and about what the graduate student said to Coach Paterno, I felt that it would not send the right message if Coach Paterno was able to lead the football team out onto the field of play under those circumstances. So I didn't change my mind {{on the question of whether}} we had established all the key facts that related to Coach Paterno's involvement and/or responsibility. But I had reached the conclusion that, from the standpoint of what the University's values would be interpreted to be by the broader public, that what was known was sufficiently serious as it relates to child sexual abuse that it would send the wrong message about our values as a University if Coach Paterno were allowed to coach as though none of this had ever happened." ...|$|E
6000|$|The {{elephants}} were, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>said,</b> <b>in</b> a line {{formed with}} admirable precision, about three hundred of them. The following little diagram will explain matters:- ...|$|E
6000|$|I fancied it was {{possible}} to read in his face the thought which he had in mind, and my cheeks were flaming red <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>in</b> the tone of one who admits his error: ...|$|E
60|$|And now for Mr. K.'s arguments, which, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>said,</b> are <b>in</b> number four.|$|R
6000|$|... "My first {{movement}} Watson," [...] said he, as he bustled {{into his}} frockcoat, [...] "must, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>said,</b> be <b>in</b> {{the direction of}} Blackheath." ...|$|R
60|$|But, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> have <b>said,</b> <b>in</b> that spirit-land wither I had journeyed is to {{be found}} neither time nor space nor any other {{familiar}} thing.|$|R
60|$|And this {{relation}} to the higher arts we will study at the source of chief power in all the normal skill of Christendom, Florence; and chiefly, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>said,</b> <b>in</b> the work of one Florentine master, Sandro Botticelli.|$|E
60|$|Sin, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>said,</b> <b>in</b> {{the nature}} of it, is horrible, though it be but one single sin as to act; yea, though it be but a sinful thought; and so worthily calls for the damnation of the soul.|$|E
6000|$|... "See {{how pretty}} they look! And how nicely the work went on {{while we were}} making them! That was because you obeyed me so well while we were doing it. You did exactly <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>in</b> every thing." ...|$|E
60|$|An {{hour later}} <b>I</b> found myself, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> have <b>said,</b> <b>in</b> a flag-stoned {{hall of the}} Yildiz Kiosk, {{with the task of}} amusing and {{entertaining}} the Sultan.|$|R
60|$|Every {{plant is}} divided, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> just <b>said,</b> <b>in</b> the main, into two parts, and these have {{opposite}} natures. One part seeks the light; the other hates it. One part feeds on the air; {{the other on}} the dust.|$|R
60|$|Such was the {{application}} {{that had come}} to me this morning,--only, instead of by note, it came, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> have <b>said,</b> <b>in</b> the person of the applicant, a thin, delicate, consumptive-looking being, wearing that rusty mourning which speaks sadly at once of heart bereavement and material poverty.|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{was done}} by a little musical-box," [...] he quietly replied. [...] "After it had been wound up, the regulator, or something, broke, and it ran down, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>said,</b> <b>in</b> about three seconds. But it must have played all the notes, you know!" ...|$|E
6000|$|When this {{disturbance}} was at {{its height}} Hiram ran toward the ladder {{as if it was}} his intent to ascend, despite the warning which had been given; but I clutched his arm, holding him back by main strength <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>in</b> a hoarse whisper: ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And why not? But never mind. Do not {{suppose that}} I am rebuking you. <b>As</b> <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>in</b> my letter, we are quits now, {{and there is}} no place for scolding on either side. We are quits now; but I am punished and you are rewarded." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 2. No {{dead bodies}} lay unburied or uncovered; {{and if any}} one walked {{from one end of}} the city to another, no funeral, or sign of it, was to be seen in the daytime, except a little, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> have <b>said,</b> <b>in</b> the first three weeks in September.|$|R
60|$|The {{architecture}} of the Greeks and Romans themselves was not good, but it was natural; and, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>said</b> before, good <b>in</b> some respects, and for a particular time.|$|R
6000|$|... "Now {{we shall}} {{go up the}} river, Anders," [...] <b>said</b> <b>I.</b> Anders assented, <b>as</b> {{he would have done}} had I {{proposed}} going down the river, or across the river, or anywhere in the wide world; for, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>said</b> it <b>in</b> English, he did not understand me. Evidently he did not care whether he understood me or not! ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No," [...] I said. [...] "I waited till I {{had seen}} you, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>in</b> my telegram. I {{wrote him a}} letter simply telling him that you were coming, as Miss Westenra was not so well, and that I should let him know if need be." ...|$|E
60|$|For these beds (known as the Woolwich and Reading beds) dip {{under that}} vast bed of London clay, {{four hundred and}} more feet thick, which (<b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>in</b> my last chapter) was {{certainly}} laid down by the estuary of some great tropic river, among palm-trees and Anonas, crocodiles and turtles.|$|E
6000|$|... "Same <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>in</b> my cable. Every {{last one}} of them, semaphore, lamp code, Marconi--a copy, mind you, not the original. That was too dangerous. But it's the real goods, and you can lay to that." [...] He slapped the German upon the {{shoulder}} with a rough familiarity from which the other winced.|$|E
60|$|For this reason, I say, I did not {{discover}} {{anything of}} that kind to her; but <b>I</b> placed her, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> have <b>said,</b> <b>in</b> Amy's stead in the other affairs of receiving money, interests, rents, and the like, and she was as faithful as Amy could be, and as diligent.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> was not, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> have <b>said,</b> born <b>in</b> the town, {{but went}} there very young--so young that I have no remembrance of any earlier time.|$|R
6000|$|Doctor Winchester {{had come}} close to us and was bending over looking at the cat's claws; <b>as</b> <b>I</b> spoke he <b>said</b> <b>in</b> a quick, sharp way: ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Two {{or three}} of the men took off little {{ornaments}} and gave them to me; one bright pretty boy especially I remember, who took off his shell necklace and put it round my neck, making me understand, partly by words, but more by signs, that {{he was afraid to}} come now, but would do so if I returned, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>said,</b> <b>in</b> eight or ten moons.|$|E
6000|$|... "But {{now that}} we're here," [...] she went on, [...] "I'm {{not going to}} have you letting every little thing {{discourage}} you. I don't see what there was in Mr. Dryfoos's manner to give you any anxiety. He's just a common, stupid, inarticulate country person, and he didn't know how to express himself, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>in</b> the beginning, and that's the reason he didn't say anything." ...|$|E
60|$|That is {{the romance}} {{that has been}} told about the big shops; in the {{literature}} and art which they have bought, and which (<b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>in</b> my recent articles) will soon be quite indistinguishable from their ordinary advertisements. The literature is commercial; {{and it is only}} {{fair to say that the}} commerce is often really literary. It is no romance, but only rubbish.|$|E
60|$|The vessel {{in which}} these new comers had sailed was, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> have <b>said,</b> wrecked <b>in</b> a {{hurricane}} near the Bermuda Isles, where, after much labor, they had contrived to build these two small ships.|$|R
60|$|I {{can hardly}} {{describe}} accurately the exact {{position of the}} Masters family without first telling all that I know about the Morton family; and it is absolutely essential that the reader should know all the Masters family intimately. Mr. Masters, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> have <b>said</b> <b>in</b> the last chapter, was the attorney in Dillsborough, and the Mortons had been for centuries past the squires of Bragton.|$|R
6000|$|... "Of {{one thing}} I am resolved," [...] Geoffrey said, [...] "I will not live at your expense any longer, Gerald. I can speak Spanish very fairly now, and can either take service in some Spanish family or, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>said,</b> get work <b>in</b> the field." ...|$|R
60|$|All exotic sayings, {{dark and}} {{ambiguous}} speakings, affected words, and, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>in</b> the last chapter, abridgement, or words cut off, {{as they are}} foolish and improper in business, so, indeed, are they in any other things; hard words, and affectation of style in business, is like bombast in poetry, a kind of rumbling nonsense, and {{nothing of the kind}} can be more ridiculous.|$|E
60|$|It was quite, quite true. No use in denying it. The {{figure that}} escaped {{through the window}} was dressed in man's clothes, to be sure, {{and as far as}} one could judge from the foreshortening and the {{peculiar}} stoop, had a man's form and stature. But the hand was a woman's--soft, and white, and delicate: nay more, the hand, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>in</b> my haste, was line for line Aunt Emma's.|$|E
60|$|<b>As</b> <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>in</b> my {{last that}} it was best for nobody to write to me, and as my sending you another little letter can {{therefore}} give you no other trouble than the trouble of reading it (perhaps you may not find leisure for even that, though I hope you will some day), I am now going to devote an hour to writing to you again. This time, I write from Rome.|$|E
60|$|A cry {{broke from}} all hands. The next moment, forgetting their own {{disappointment}} in that contagious sentiment of success, they gave three cheers that scared the sea-birds; {{and the next}} they had crowded round the captain, and were jostling together and groping with emulous hands in the new-opened mat. Box after box rewarded them, six in all; wrapped, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> have <b>said,</b> <b>in</b> a paper envelope, and the paper printed on in Chinese characters.|$|R
60|$|We were, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> have <b>said,</b> <b>in</b> the dining-room: the lustre, {{which had}} been lit for dinner, filled {{the room with a}} festal breadth of light; the large fire was all red and clear; the purple {{curtains}} hung rich and ample before the lofty window and loftier arch; everything was still, save the subdued chat of Adele (she dared not speak loud), and, filling up each pause, the beating of winter rain against the panes.|$|R
6000|$|God the Father, and Jesus Christ his Son, are {{for having}} things seen; {{for having the}} Word of life held forth. They light not a candle {{that it might be}} put under a bushel, or under a bed, but on a candlestick, that all that come in may see the light (Matt 5:15; Mark 4:21; Luke 8:16; 11:33). and, <b>I</b> say, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>said</b> before, <b>in</b> whom is it, light, like so to shine, as in the souls of great sinners? ...|$|R
