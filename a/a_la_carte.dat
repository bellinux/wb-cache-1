5|$|The {{extraordinary}} initial {{success of}} Pinafore in America was seen first-hand by J. C. Williamson. He soon made arrangements with D'Oyly Carte {{to present the}} opera's first authorised production in Australia, opening on 15 November 1879 at the Theatre Royal, Sydney. Thereafter, his opera company played frequent seasons of the work (and the subsequent Savoy operas) until at least 1963. In the U.S., the piece never lost popularity. The Internet Broadway Database links to a non-exhaustive list of 29 productions on Broadway alone. Among the professional repertory companies continuing to present Pinafore regularly in the U.S. are Opera <b>a</b> <b>la</b> <b>Carte,</b> based in California, Ohio Light Opera and the New York Gilbert and Sullivan Players, which tours the opera annually and often includes it in its New York seasons.

40|$|A cable {{operator}} chooses to bundle or provide programs <b>a</b> ̀ <b>la</b> <b>carte</b> by striking <b>a</b> {{balance between the}} incentive to maximize total surplus and min-imize transfer payments to program providers.

40|$|Wouter Swierstra’s {{data types}} <b>a</b> ̀ <b>la</b> <b>carte</b> is <b>a</b> {{technique}} to modu-larise data type definitions in Haskell. We give an alternative im-plementation of data types <b>a</b> ̀ <b>la</b> <b>carte</b> that offers {{more flexibility in}} composing and decomposing data types. To achieve this, we re-fine the subtyping constraint, {{which is at the}} centre of data types <b>a</b> ̀ <b>la</b> <b>carte.</b> On the one hand this refinement is more general, allow-ing subtypings that intuitively should hold but were not derivable beforehand. This aspect of our implementation removes previous restrictions on how data types can be combined. On the other hand our refinement is more restrictive, disallowing subtypings that lead to more than one possible injection and should therefore be consid-ered programming errors. Furthermore, from this refined subtyping constraint we derive a new constraint to express type isomorphism. We show how this isomorphism constraint allows us to decompose data types and to define extensible functions on data types in an ad hoc manner. The implementation makes essential use of closed type families in Haskell. The use of closed type families instead of type classes comes with a set of trade-offs, which we review in detail. Finally, we show that our technique can be used for other similar problem domains...|$|R

40|$|Formal {{reasoning}} in proof assistants, {{also known as}} mechaniza-tion, has high development costs. Building modular reusable com-ponents is a key issue in reducing these costs.

However, MTC’s use of extensible Church-encodings is unsatisfactory. This paper takes a better approach to the problem with datatype-generic programming (DGP). It applies well-known DGP tech-niques to represent modular datatypes, to build functions from functor algebras with folds and to compose proofs from proof alge-bras by means of induction. Moreover, for certain functionality and proofs our approach can achieve more reuse than MTC: instead of composing modular components we provide a single generic defi-nition once and for all...|$|R

40|$|In {{previous}} work we have illustrated {{the benefits that}} compositional data types (CDTs) offer for im-plementing languages and in general for dealing with abstract syntax trees (ASTs). Based on Swier-stra’s data types <b>a</b> ̀ <b>la</b> <b>carte,</b> CDTs are implemented as a Haskell library that enables the definition of recursive data types and functions on them in a modular and extendable fashion. Although CDTs provide {{a powerful tool for}} analysing and manipulating ASTs, they lack a convenient representation of variable binders. In this paper we remedy this deficiency by combining the framework of CDTs with Chlipala’s parametric higher-order abstract syntax (PHOAS). We show how a generalisation from functors to difunctors enables us to capture PHOAS while still maintaining the features of the original implementation of CDTs, in particular its modularity. Unlike previous approaches, we avoid so-called exotic terms without resorting to abstract types: this is crucial when we want to perform transformations on CDTs that inspect the recursively computed CDTs, e. g. constant folding. ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} Modular Reifiable Matching (MRM) : a {{new approach}} to two level types using a fixpoint of list-of-functors rep-resentation. MRM allows the modular definition of datatypes and functions by pattern matching, using a style similar to the widely popular Datatypes <b>a</b> ̀ <b>la</b> <b>Carte</b> (DTC) approach. However, unlike DTC, MRM uses a fixpoint of list-of-functors approach to two-level types. This approach has advantages that help with various aspects of extensibility, modularity and reuse. Firstly, modular pat-tern matching definitions are collected using a list of matches that is fully reifiable. This allows for extensible pattern matching def-initions to be easily reused/inherited, and particular matches to be overridden. Such flexibility is used, among other things, to imple-ment extensible generic traversals. Secondly, the subtyping relation between lists of functors is quite simple, does not require back-tracking, and is easy to model in languages like Haskell. MRM is implemented as a Haskell library, and its use and applicability are illustrated through various examples in the paper...|$|R
