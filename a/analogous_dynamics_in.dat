40|$|Modelling {{the process}} of {{recombination}} leads to a large coupled nonlinear dynamical system. Here, we consider a particular case of recombination in discrete time, allowing only for single crossovers. While the <b>analogous</b> <b>dynamics</b> <b>in</b> continuous time admits a closed solution, this no longer works for discrete time. A more general model (i. e. without the restriction to single crossovers) has been studied before and was solved algorithmically by means of Haldane linearisation. Using the special formalism introduced by Baake and Baake (2003), we obtain further insight into the single-crossover dynamics and the particular difficulties that arise in discrete time. We then transform the equations to a solvable system in a two-step procedure: linearisation followed by diagonalisation. Still, the coefficients of the second step must be determined in a recursive manner, but once this is done for a given system, they allow for an explicit solution valid for all times. Comment: J.

40|$|Recent {{years have}} seen {{dramatic}} developments in the technology of intense pulsed light sources in the THz frequency range. Since many dipole-active excitations in solids and molecules also lie in this range, {{there is now a}} tremendous potential to use these light sources to study linear and nonlinear dynamics in such systems. While several experimental investigations of THz-driven dynamics in solid-state systems have demonstrated a variety of interesting linear and nonlinear phenomena, comparatively few efforts have been made to drive <b>analogous</b> <b>dynamics</b> <b>in</b> molecular systems. In the present Perspective article, we discuss the similarities and differences between THz-driven dynamics in solid-state and molecular systems on both conceptual and practical levels. We also discuss the experimental parameters needed for these types of experiments and thereby provide design criteria for a further development of this new research branch. Finally, we present a few recent examples to illustrate the rich physics that may be learned from nonlinear THz excitations of phonons in solids as well as inter-molecular vibrations in liquid and gas-phase systems...|$|E

40|$|This {{contribution}} {{is concerned with}} mathematical models for {{the dynamics of the}} genetic composition of populations evolving under recombination. Recombination is the genetic mechanism by which two parent individuals create the mixed type of their offspring during sexual reproduction. The corresponding models are large, nonlinear dynamical systems (for the deterministic treatment that applies in the infinite-population limit), or interacting particle systems (for the stochastic treatment required for finite populations). We review recent progress on these difficult problems. In particular, we present a closed solution of the deterministic continuous-time system, for the important special case of single crossovers; we extract an underlying linearity; we analyse how this carries over to the corresponding stochastic setting; and we provide a solution of the <b>analogous</b> deterministic discrete-time <b>dynamics,</b> <b>in</b> terms of its generalised eigenvalues and a simple recursion for the corresponding coefficients.

40|$|Human {{activity}} {{has resulted in}} the emergence of fire-induced forest-shrubland mosaics in many southern temperate forest landscapes. In New Zealand (NZ), this transformation was caused by the introduction of fire to previously very low fire-frequency ecosystems. High levels of seed and seedling predation by exotic mammals and the reduction of avian pollination and seed dispersal further influence vegetation change and can cause successions to become completely arrested. <b>Analogous</b> <b>dynamics</b> occur <b>in</b> many other Southern Hemisphere forest landscapes where changes in fire regimes and the introduction of mammalian herbivores and predators have resulted in forest-shrubland mosaics. We developed a spatially explicit state-and-transition model to disentangle the effects of altered fire regimes; invasive pyrophyllic shrub species; seed and seedling predation by exotic mammals; and lowered rates of long-distance seed movement on long-term landscape dynamics and state transitions. Our modelling highlights a threshold in fire frequency where forest systems move to a fire-induced early-successional shrubland state. Because early-successional vegetation in NZ and many other southern temperate forests is much more flammable than mature late-successional vegetation, this shrubland state will persist until fire is suppressed. Our modelling suggests also that in the absence of fire there are critical thresholds in seed predation beyond which succession may become completely arrested in a mid-successional state. Even moderate levels of predation slow regeneration and move the tipping point at which forests shift to early-successional shrublands in the direction of less frequent fire. The presence of invasive pyrophyllic shrubs in the landscape also influences the location of thresholds in fire frequency at which state shifts occur. Restoring these landscapes to their formerly forested condition will require the removal of fire as well as mammalian seed/ling predators and the reinstatement of pollination and dispersal services. Removal of seed predators may act as an effective component of fire control by allowing secondary successions to proceed more quickly, thereby reducing landscape-level flammability...|$|R
40|$|The core {{concept of}} quantum {{simulation}} is the mapping of an inaccessible quantum system onto a controllable one by identifying <b>analogous</b> <b>dynamics.</b> We map the Dirac equation of relativistic quantum mechanics in 3 + 1 dimensions onto a multi-level superconducting Josephson circuit. Resonant drives determine the particle mass and momentum and the quantum state represents the internal spinor dynamics, which are {{cast in the}} language of multi-level quantum optics. The degeneracy of the Dirac spectrum corresponds to a degeneracy of bright/dark states within the system and particle spin and helicity are employed to interpret the multi-level dynamics. We simulate the Schwinger mechanism of electron-positron pair production by introducing an analogous electric field as a doubly degenerate Landau-Zener problem. All proposed measurements can be performed well within typical decoherence times. This work opens a new avenue for experimental study of the Dirac equation and provides a tool for control of complex <b>dynamics</b> <b>in</b> multi-level systems...|$|R

We identify conditions under which attractive and repulsive dimers exhibit <b>analogous</b> <b>dynamics.</b> Our studies reveal that coherent transport and periodic oscillations of appropriately prepared one- and two-atom wavepackets can be achieved, which may facilitate information transfer in optical lattice based quantum computation schemes.

40|$|Latent viruses {{generally}} {{defend their}} host cell against superinfection by nonlatent virulent mutants that could destroy the host cell. Superinfection inhibition thus {{seems to be}} a prerequisite for the maintenance of viral latency. Yet viral latency can break down when resistance to superinfection inhibition, known as ultravirulence, occurs. To understand the evolution of viral latency, we have developed a model that analyzes the epidemiology of latent infection in the face of ultravirulence. We show that latency can be maintained when superinfection inhibition and resistance against it coevolve in an arms race, which can result in large fluctuations in virulence. An example is the coevolution of the virulence and superinfection repressor protein of phage lambda (cI) and its binding target, the lambda oLoR operator. We show that this repressor/operator coevolution is the driving force for the evolution of superinfection immunity groups. Beyond latent phages, we predict <b>analogous</b> <b>dynamics</b> for any latent virus that uses a single repressor for the simultaneous control of virulence and superinfection...|$|R

40|$|Holographic photopolymers develop {{permanent}} index change via the polymerization {{and subsequent}} diffusion of monomer. It is well-known that to achieve high-fidelity recording, {{the rate of}} polymerization must be small {{in comparison to the}} rate of diffusion, particularly for strong exposures that consume significant fractions of the available monomer. When this condition is violated, polymerization is slowed in high-intensity regions by the local depletion of monomer, resulting in broadening of recorded features. This paper shows that a diffusing inhibitor has <b>analogous</b> <b>dynamics</b> controlled by the ratio of inhibitor diffusion rate to inhibition rate. When the ratio is small, inhibitor is locally depleted in bright regions, resulting in localized acceleration of polymerization. This causes recorded index features to be narrower than the incident optical exposure. Theoretical, numerical and experimental studies are used to illustrate this fact and show that this narrowing can be used to compensate for the broadening caused by monomer dynamics. Both effects are emphasized for rapid, strong recordings, suggesting that an inhibitor may be used to increase recording fidelity in this limit...|$|R

40|$|This Article {{analyzes}} the legal regulation of abortion {{within the context}} of Europe’s multilevel system for the protection of fundamental rights. The Article examines the constitutional dynamics and challenges that emerge in the field of abortion law from the overlap between national and supranational norms in Europe, comparing the European multilevel architecture with the United States (U. S.) federal system. To this end, the Article summarizes the main trends in the regulation of abortion in the various European Union (“EU”) countries, assesses the growing impact of the EU and the European Convention on Human Rights in the field of abortion law, and emphasizes how supranational law generates new pressures and creates several inconsistencies within the domestic legal systems of those states which restrict abortion rights. It then explores how <b>analogous</b> <b>dynamics</b> have historically been at play in the U. S. federal system. Finally, the Article evaluates—in light of the U.

40|$|Above a {{critical}} surface chemistry-dependent particle loading associated with nanoscale interparticle spacing, ligand-ligand interactions-both electrostatic and steric-come into play and govern {{the structure and}} dynamics of charged oligomer-functionalized nanoparticle suspensions. We report in particular on the structure, ion transport, and rheology of suspensions of nanoparticle salts created by cofunctionalization of silica particles with tethered sulfonate salts and oligomers. Dispersion of the hairy ionic particles into medium and high dielectric constant liquids yields electrolytes with unique structure and transport properties. We find that electrostatic repulsion imparted by ion dissociation can be tuned to control the dispersion state and rheology through counterion size (i. e., Li+, Na+, and K+) and dielectric properties of the dispersing medium. Analysis of small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) structure factors and the mechanical modulus shows that when the interparticle spacing approaches nanometer dimensions, weakly entangled anchored ligands experience strong and long-lived topological constraints analogous to those normally found in well-entangled polymeric fluids. This finding provides insight into the molecular origins of the surprisingly similar rubbery plateau moduli observed in hairy nanoparticle suspensions and entangled polymers of the same chemistry as the tethered ligands. Additionally, we find that a time-composition superposition (TCS) principle exists for the suspensions, {{which can be used}} to substantially extend the observation time over which <b>dynamics</b> are observed <b>in</b> jammed, soft glassy suspensions. Application of TCS reveals dynamical similarities between the suspensions and entangled solutions of linear polymer chains; i. e., a hairy particle trapped in a cage appears to exhibit <b>analogous</b> <b>dynamics</b> to a long polymer chain confined to a tube. © 2014 American Chemical Society...|$|R

The recent interest for complex multisoliton dynamics is covered. The soliton rain dynamics, which displays some analogy with the water cycle, is presented. <b>Dynamics</b> <b>analogous</b> to various states of matter, and chaotic multiple pulse dynamics, including noise-like pulses and dissipative rogue waves are also reported.
