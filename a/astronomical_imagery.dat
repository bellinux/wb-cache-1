The series encompasses the relationships the characters build with each other, climaxing whenever two of the characters start dating. The central focuses of Strawberry Panic! are the lesbian relationships and friendships between the girls from the three schools and the Etoile position and competition; the anime is more relationship-heavy while the manga is more competition-heavy. The story of what happens to the other half of St. Miator's Etoile pairing is explored in the latter portion of the anime. Depending on the media type, the depiction of the relationships between the girls is variously presented, with more explicit fan service– appealing visuals of the girls in provocative situations– in the anime adaptation than in the manga or light novels. A hint of <b>astronomical</b> star <b>imagery</b> is seen throughout the series, as well as minor Catholic religious undertones including a St. Mary statue on campus and a large Catholic church in the center of Astraea Hill.|$|R
40|$|Nezami Ganjavi {{is one of}} {{the famous}} figures of Persian poetry whose poetry has been {{considered}} to need commentary and interpretation for a long time. One of the reasons of complexity in his poems is the precise usage of <b>astronomical</b> terms and <b>imagery</b> capacities of zodiac and heavenly bodies. This article discusses one of the verses in the preface of Makhzan al-Asrar and the Prophetâs Ascension. In our view, commentators of Makhzan al-Asrar have not understood the delicacy of this verse due to considering it as a simple verse or lack of attention to Nezamiâs imagery, and have sometimes proposed a meaning which is incongruent with his exact information about the zodiac. Considering the shape of Virgo and Leo and their location beside each other in the heaven, he has elaborated a prevailing theme in Persian poetry which has been pointed out repeatedly in old and new astrological books, his other verses and poems of great poets like Khaqani.

The poem has been cited as manifesting “the extremes of the metaphysical style”, but in this it sits well with others there that are like it: John Denham’s “Elegy on the death of Henry Lord Hastings”, for example, or Marvell’s rather smoother “Upon the death of the Lord Hastings”. The several correspondences among the poems there are sometimes explained {{as the result of the}} book’s making a covert Royalist statement. In the political circumstances following the recent beheading of the king, it was wise to dissemble grief for him while mourning another under the obscure and closely wrought arguments typical of the Metaphysical style.|$|E

This implies that fortune is a force of nature that is greater than mankind, and cannot be manipulated. The 'game of chance' that Fortune puts into play can be related to that of politics, expressing the fact that the characters must play their luck in both fortune and politics to identify a victor. The play culminates, however, in Antony's realization that he is merely a card, not a player in this game.|$|E

High accuracy is achieved via a sign-preserving, shifted log transform applied to features with peaked, heavy-tailed distributions. The imbalanced data problem is handled by oversampling positive examples, selectively sampling misclassified negative examples, and iteratively training multiple SVMs for improved supernova recognition on unseen test data.

The high quality imagery {{produced}} by the world's observatories can be a key to effectively engaging with the public and helping to inspire {{the next generation of}} scientists.

Most astronomical images are natively digital, with their data traveling from telescopes to scientists as a series of ones and zeroes and with tens and even {{hundreds of}} terabytes of data available from a single observatory archive (Brunner, 2001). These data span the entire electromagnetic spectrum from radio waves to infrared light to X-rays and gamma rays – a majority of which is undetectable to the human eye without technology.

Assuming axial symmetry, our reconstruction algorithm uses a single input image (a) to produce a high-resolution 3 D visualization that closely resembles the original image when rendered from the same viewpoint (b). From a novel vantage point, the emission along the principal axis of the nebula accumulates and creates a luminous halo (c). As the vantage point approaches the symmetry axis, the received intensity further increases and the perceived shape of the nebula changes toward two entangled rings (d). The resolution of the reconstructed volume is 512 3 voxels. Original image: Bruce Balick (University of Washington), Vincent Icke (Leiden University, The Netherlands), Garrelt Mellema (Stockholm University), and NASA. Abstract—The 3 D visualization of astronomical nebulae is a challenging problem since only a single 2 D projection is observable from our fixed vantage point on Earth. We attempt to generate plausible and realistic looking volumetric visualizations via a tomographic approach that exploits the spherical or axial symmetry prevalent in some relevant types of nebulae. Different types of symmetry can be implemented by using different randomized distributions of virtual cameras. Our approach {{is based on an}} iterative compressed sensing reconstruction algorithm that we extend with support for position-dependent volumetric regularization and linear equality constraints. We present a distributed multi-GPU implementation that is capable of reconstructing high-resolution datasets from arbitrary projections. Its robustness and scalability are demonstrated for <b>astronomical</b> <b>imagery</b> from the Hubble Space Telescope. The resulting volumetric data is visualized using direct volume rendering.

40|$|This thesis {{considers}} the use {{a range of}} writers {{in the early to}} mid-Victorian period have made of interplays between the fantastic and the mimetic modes in their texts. I respond to critical assessments of the role of fantasy writing within Victorian fiction, and develop new articulations both of this role and of the nature of fantastic-mimetic interplays. In doing so, I interrogate Stephen Prickett’s categorization of Victorian fantasy writing as an unconscious creative force and Rosemary Jackson’s detailing of ‘Victorian fantasy realism’ as an evocation of negative tensions within Victorian culture. I transpose Julia Kristeva’s theories of transformative poetic intertextuality into the context of intertextualities between pairings of a fantasy and a realist text by four different Victorian authors. Chapter One explores how uncanny textualites in Charlotte Brontë's juvenile novella, The Spell (1834), and her mature work Jane Eyre (1847) represent the fragmented nature of aesthetic identities in nineteenth-century artistic, religious and authorial contexts, and how this representation suggests ways of negotiating resolution. Chapter Two investigates the use of polyphonic textuality (combinations of fairy tale and ghost story motifs) in Nicholas Nickleby (1838 - 1839) and A Christmas Carol (1843) by Charles Dickens dramatizes the emotional complications of disability in terms of a wide spectrum of social exclusion. Chapter Three examines how <b>astronomical</b> <b>imagery</b> and cognitive dissonance represent educational reform in George Eliot's The Lifted Veil (1859) and Daniel Deronda (1876). Chapter Four traces the extended interrogation and transcendence of emotional deprivation in George Macdonald's Adela Cathcart, developed by a heteroglossic voice through the fairy tales 'The Light Princess', 'The Shadows' and 'The Giant's Heart' (all first published in 1864). I propose that these critical interrogations can best be understood through an adaptation of Damien Broderick’s theory of modern transrealism, adapted to the historical context of the Victorian period...|$|E

[...] Department of Theatre. University of Missouri [...] Kansas City, 2015 Pericles's apparent inferiority to Shakespeare’s mature works raises many questions for scholars. Was Shakespeare collaborating with an inferior playwright or playwrights? Did he allow so many corrupt printed versions {{of his works}} after 1604 out of indifference? Re-dating Pericles from the Jacobean to the Elizabethan era answers these questions and reveals previously unexamined connections between topical references in Pericles and events and personalities {{in the court of}} Elizabeth I: John Dee, Philip Sidney, Edward de Vere, and many others. The tournament impresas, alchemical symbolism of the story, and its lunar and <b>astronomical</b> <b>imagery</b> suggest Pericles was written long before 1608. Finally, Shakespeare’s focus on father-daughter relationships, and the importance of Marina, the daughter, as the heroine of the story, point to Pericles as written for a young girl. This thesis uses topical references, Shakespeare’s anachronisms, Shakespeare’s sources, stylometry and textual analysis, as well as Henslowe’s diary, the Stationers' Register, and other contemporary documentary evidence to determine whether there may have been versions of Pericles circulating before the accepted date of 1608. I also delve into the printing and publication history of Pericles, as well as some stylometric analysis, to show how and why this probably early play might have been appropriated by victualler George Wilkins (1576 - 1618) and others, and revived to feed a growing demand for Shakespeare’s works.

40|$|Abstract: We {{have created}} a website, called "Black Holes: Gravity's Relentless Pull", which {{explains}} the physics and astronomy of black holes for a general audience. The site emphasizes user participation and is rich in animations and <b>astronomical</b> <b>imagery.</b> It won the top prize of the 2005 Pirelli INTERNETional Awards competition for the best communication {{of science and technology}} using the internet. This article provides a brief overview of the site. The site starts with an opening animation that introduces the basic concept of a black hole. The user is then invited to embark on a journey from a backyard view of the night sky to a personal encounter with a singularity. This journey proceeds through three modules, which allow the user to: find black holes in the night sky; travel to a black hole in an animated starship; and explore a black hole from up close. There are also five "experiments" that allow the user to: create a black hole; orbit around a black hole; weigh a black hole; drop a clock into a black hole; or fall into a black hole. The modules and experiments offer goal-based scenarios tailored for novices and children. The site also contains an encyclopedia of frequently asked questions and a detailed glossary that are targeted more at experts and adults.
