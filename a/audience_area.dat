5|$|On 16 June 2014, the EBU {{confirmed}} that the 2014 contest would be held at three large former shipbuilding sheds of Malta Shipbuilding. The middle shed would be the main <b>audience</b> <b>area</b> and stage, while the two side sheds would be used as audience entrances and exits, restrooms, and refreshment stalls. In total, there was capacity for 4,000–4,500 people inside the buildings.|$|E
5|$|The present Theatre Royal in Drury Lane, {{designed}} by Benjamin Dean Wyatt {{on behalf of}} the committee led by Whitbread, opened on 10 October 1812 with a production of Hamlet featuring Robert Elliston in the title role. The new theatre made some concessions toward intimacy, seating 3,060 people, about 550 fewer than the earlier building (though this size is still considered an extremely large theatre). On 6 September 1817, gas lighting was extended from the <b>audience</b> <b>area</b> to the stage, making it the first British theatre to be gaslit throughout. In 1820 the portico that still stands at the theatre's front entrance on Catherine Street was added, and in 1822 the interior underwent a significant remodelling. The colonnade running down the Russell Street side of the building was added in 1831.|$|E
5|$|To keep low {{frequency}} sound {{focused on the}} <b>audience</b> <b>area</b> {{and not on the}} stage, and to keep low frequencies from bothering people outside of the event space, a variety of techniques have been developed in concert sound to turn the naturally omnidirectional radiation of subwoofers into a more directional pattern. Several examples of sound reinforcement system applications where sound engineers seek to provide more directional bass sound are music festivals, which often have several bands performing at the same time on different stages; large raves or EDM events, where there are multiple DJs performing {{at the same time in}} different rooms or stages; and multiplex movie theatres, in which there are many films being shown simultaneously in auditoriums that share common walls. These techniques include setting up subwoofers in a vertical array; using combinations of delay and polarity inversion; and setting up a delay-shaded system. With a cardioid dispersion pattern, two end-fire subwoofers can be placed one in front of the other. The enclosure nearest the listener is delayed by a few milliseconds The second subwoofer is delayed a precise amount corresponding to the time it takes sound to traverse the distance between speaker grilles.|$|E

50|$|The {{exterior}} {{shape of}} the building follows the form of its interior spaces with backstage and <b>audience</b> <b>areas</b> clearly visible. The sides of the building are clad in white marble to harmonize with the other buildings in the Civic Center Complex- the City-County Building, Veterans Memorial Building and Cobo Hall and Arena. The Jefferson Avenue and river facades are covered with a mica-flecked blue granite in a basket-weave pattern.|$|R
25|$|It {{was first}} called the New Bandstand, {{and then the}} Central Bandstand, to {{differentiate}} it from other bandstands in Herne Bay, especially the bandstand which stood {{on the roof of}} the King's Hall and has since been demolished. The north or seaward side of the Central Bandstand was built in 1924, with alterations in 1931. The original architect was Herbert Kempton Dyson, M.I.Struct.E (1880–1944), who was a founder member of the Concrete Institute, and specialised in reinforced concrete structures. The 1924 section has two outside seaward-facing balconies with space for deckchairs, including a cantilevered roof for the lower deck and for covering the stage inside. Metal, glazed screens at the east and west sides of the building crossed the promenade, and could be moved to protect the audience from wind, or retracted into the wings to allow promenaders to cross when no band was playing. The seating area was a railed-off section of the promenade, and the seating on the roof above the stage included two copper-covered domes, plus two domes which doubled as refreshment kiosks. The roof is now inaccessible for safety reasons. By the late 1920s the <b>audience</b> <b>area</b> in front of the stage had extended across Tower Gardens to the edge of the footpath and road.|$|E
25|$|The {{building}} {{was constructed in}} three sections to fulfill the established criteria. The first section, projecting outwards, had various workshops, cloakrooms and the foyer {{on the ground floor}} while upstairs it had a restaurant and a scenography studio. The second section housed the theatre proper. The boxes contained separate dressing rooms while the <b>audience</b> <b>area</b> was flat so that the hall could also be used as a ballroom. The third section, the stage, was designed in three sweeps with two lateral compartments large enough for backstage requirements. In his design for the horseshoe-shaped auditorium, Piermarini was inspired by the architecture of the Teatro di San Carlo in Naples but changed the degree of curvature so as to improve visibility and the acoustics. The acoustics were further enhanced by a number of subsequent modifications. For the ceiling, a finely decorated wooden facing served as a natural sounding board, ensuring almost perfect sound in every part of the hall. It was considered to be among the best of the times. Another little trick was to reduce significantly the size of the usually huge columns separating the various stages. For the hall's decor, Piermarini worked with prominent artists such as Giuseppe Levati and Giocondo Albertolli while also consulting the poet Giuseppe Parini. The theatre underwent many alterations during the Napoleonic period after which it lost its Neoclassical interiors as a result of work carried out by artists such as Francesco Hayez.|$|E
2500|$|A {{stage and}} a blue plywood amphitheater are erected {{southeast}} of the National Christmas Tree, and the placement of heavy plastic mats and metal folding chairs {{in front of the}} stage (with seating for only 200 people at most) creates an <b>audience</b> <b>area</b> for performances. A plywood nativity scene, [...] Yule log fire pit, and barn for donkeys, reinder, and sheep are built south of the Pathway of Peace. Speakers on high stands throughout the area broadcast the live performances, or provide recorded music for viewers' enjoyment. Since the Pageant of Peace and Pathway of Peace are traditions extending back only to 1954, they are not considered historic elements by the National Park Service.|$|E

2500|$|In 2003, Barbar {{was asked}} {{to return to a}} LARES {{installation}} he had just left, the Sunset Center in Carmel, California, as its new acoustic signature was perceived as being too long and too detailed. Bruno Weil, conductor of the Carmel Bach Festival, had requested Barbar to emulate within the Sunset Center the acoustics of a large church. Formerly characterized as having [...] "sponge-like acoustics", the Sunset Center's LARES-enhanced acoustics made coughs and rustlings from the audience be heard too loudly on stage, and reverberation in the <b>audience</b> <b>area</b> was likened to [...] "the Grand Canyon" [...] by one observer. The City of Carmel paid US$10,000 for Barbar's extra ten days of tuning the system. With the assistance of Carmel Bach Festival management, the system was re-tuned with favorable results. Music critic Scott MacClelland wrote: [...] "The search for the optimal acoustic in the Sunset auditorium continues. A controversial electronic enhancement system was built into the renovation – to compensate for some inherent shortcomings of the room — and was freshly tweaked by its designer before this year’s festival began. (It was even further adjusted between the opening Saturday night program and the Sunday matinee under review.) Most of the undesirable artifacts of the original tuning are now gone, and the sonic imagery today may be as good as it gets." ...|$|E
50|$|Heaters {{under each}} seat help control the theatre {{temperature}} for the audience; {{the goal is}} to maintain two temperature zones in the theatre. The stage is kept at a higher temperature while the <b>audience</b> <b>area</b> is kept at a lower temperature.

50|$|Everything on {{the stage}} and in the <b>{{audience}}</b> <b>area</b> is totally black, and the audience seats can easily be removed {{in order to make the}} room much easier to configure for alternative setups. There are up to approximately 200 seats for this stage.|$|E
50|$|The same {{interest}} in extreme facilities went into other ventures. The studios and offices were built at 1717 West 2nd in Roswell. The plant {{was more than}} 50000 sq ft and had two large studios, with overhead control rooms and separate <b>audience</b> <b>areas</b> complete with bleachers. The plant {{was inspired by the}} then recent CBS Television City facility in the Los Angeles area. The small AM station was sold to other interests (eventually becoming KRSY) when Barnett won a permit for a new station on 1020 kHz. The new KSWS radio station, which went on the air in 1965, was 50,000 watts by day and 10,000 watts by night. That station is today's KCKN.|$|R
5000|$|Pros: Photographs {{are good}} tools {{to make or}} {{emphasize}} a point or to explain a topic. For example, when explaining the shanty-towns in a third word country it would be beneficial to show a picture of one so the reader can {{have a better understanding}} of how those people live. A photograph is also good to use when the actual object cannot be viewed. For example, in a health class learning about cocaine, the teacher cannot bring in cocaine to show the class because that would be illegal, but the teacher could show a picture of cocaine to the class. Using local photos can also help emphasize how your topic is important in the <b>audience's</b> <b>area.</b>|$|R
5000|$|In 2002, {{the show}} {{built a new}} set and {{designed}} a new logo and graphics. The new set was much larger and brighter than the previous [...] "basement" [...] set.

40|$|Tumor Foderato d’Infanzia' was a {{performance}} directed and designed by Andrea Cusumano. 'Dead Class' by Tadeusz Kantor inspired his treatment for this production. Developing from Cusumano's interest in Kantor, this production explored the dramaturgical potential {{of space and}} objects. It followed a series of workshops, studies and installation-performances in which he developed an approach creating meaning by crossing the borders between written drama, directing, dramaturgy, and set-design. The methodology was developed in two previous experimental productions:'Something about Lisistrata', installation-performance, April 2005, ‘Cantieri Culturali’, Palermo, and 'Drabina Jakuba', theatre piece, March 2006, ‘Cricoteka’, Krakow. 'Tumor' started with the physical construction of a set in {{the site where the}} play would take place and responded to particular features of both the performance and <b>audience</b> <b>areas.</b> He then produced objects referring to specific subjects that were previously discussed in group-dynamic sessions with the performers. From improvisations, the group constructed sequences, text and a dramaturgy initiated by the space and the objects, rather then a written script...|$|R

40|$|Presented at the 10 th International Conference on Auditory Display (ICAD 2004) Spatial {{impression}} {{refers to}} the attributes of subjective space beyond localization. In the field of auditorium acoustics, auditory spatial impression is often divided into `apparent source width', `envelopment' and sometimes `intimacy'. In separate experiments, this study considers how visual and auditory spatial impression vary within two auditoria, and hence similarities between these two sensory modes. In the visual experiment, the `spaciousness', `envelopment', `stage dominance', `intimacy' and target distance were judged by subjects using grayscale projected photographs, taken from various positions in the <b>audience</b> <b>areas</b> of the two auditoria when a visual target was on stage. In the auditory experiment, the `apparent source width', `envelopment', `intimacy' and performer distance were judged using an anechoic orchestral recording convolved with binaural impulse responses measured from the same positions in the two auditoria. Results show target distance to be of primary importance in auditory and visual spatial impression – thereby providing a basis for covariance between some attributes of auditory and visual spatial impression. Nevertheless, some attributes of spatial impression diverge between the senses...|$|R
