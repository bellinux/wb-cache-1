5|$|The {{recovery}} of European wolf populations began after the 1950s, when traditional pastoral and rural economies declined and thus removed {{the need to}} heavily persecute wolves. By the 1980s, small <b>and</b> <b>isolated</b> wolf populations expanded {{in the wake of}} decreased human density in rural areas and the {{recovery of}} wild prey populations.|$|E

5|$|According to some sources, 26 April {{marks the}} end of this battle, {{although}} less severe <b>and</b> <b>isolated</b> clashes in that region continued until 30 April. Other sources note that heavy fighting still took place on 27 April, and that the German advance was only completely halted by 28 April. By {{the end of}} the month, the Polish Second Army and the Soviet forces had repelled the German attack, forming a line toward Kamenz–Doberschütz–Dauban, and was preparing to launch an offensive toward Prague.|$|E
5|$|Apeomyoides savagei is {{a fossil}} rodent from the Miocene of the United States, the only {{species in the}} genus Apeomyoides. It is known from fragmentary jaws <b>and</b> <b>isolated</b> teeth from a site in the early Barstovian, around 15–16 million years ago, of Nevada. Together with other species from {{scattered}} localities in the United States, Japan, and Europe, Apeomyoides is classified in the subfamily Apeomyinae of the extinct rodent family Eomyidae. Apeomyines are a rare but widespread group {{that may have been}} adapted to a relatively dry habitat.|$|E

5|$|Bitter, {{confused}} fighting continued {{behind the}} 35th Infantry's {{line for the}} next week. Battalions, companies, and platoons, cut off <b>and</b> <b>isolated,</b> fought independently of higher control and help except for airdrops which supplied many of them. Airdrops also supplied relief forces {{trying to reach the}} front-line units. Tanks and armored cars drove to the isolated units with supplies of food and ammunition and carried back critically wounded on the return trips. In general, the 35th Infantry fought in its original battle line positions, while at first one battalion, and later two battalions, of the 27th Infantry fought toward it through the estimated 3,000 North Koreans operating in its rear areas.|$|E
5|$|Both Pyrrhocorax {{species have}} {{extensive}} geographical ranges and large populations; neither {{is thought to}} approach the thresholds for the global population decline criteria of the IUCN Red List (i.e., declining more than 30% in ten years or three generations), and they are therefore evaluated as being of Least Concern. However, some populations, particularly on islands such as Corsica and La Palma are small <b>and</b> <b>isolated.</b>|$|E
5|$|Emperors {{could choose}} whether to {{supervise}} the policy bureaucracy or to pursue scholarship, cults, hobbies, or women instead. However, Frederick W. Mote argues that most Song emperors – who spent much of their childhood confined <b>and</b> <b>isolated</b> within a luxurious palace – were aloof conformists detached {{from the world of}} normal affairs and thus relied on officialdom to administer the government. While the mainstream view is that the Song court exercised the highest degree of restraint and courtesy towards civil officials, the new protocol of enhanced deferential treatment by officials towards the emperor during conferences and meetings further eroded the emperor's close contact with his ministers.|$|E

5|$|Even {{before the}} Bern disputation, Zwingli was {{canvassing}} for {{an alliance of}} reformed cities. Once Bern officially accepted the Reformation, a new alliance, das Christliche Burgrecht (the Christian Civic Union) was created. The first meetings were held in Bern between representatives of Bern, Constance, and Zurich on 5–6 January 1528. Other cities, including Basel, Biel, Mülhausen, Schaffhausen, and St Gallen, eventually joined the alliance. The Five (Catholic) States felt encircled <b>and</b> <b>isolated,</b> so they searched for outside allies. After two months of negotiations, the Five States formed die Christliche Vereinigung (the Christian Alliance) with Ferdinand of Austria on 22 April 1529.|$|E
5|$|Heavy rains caused {{landslides}} {{and flash}} flooding, which {{were responsible for}} extensive crop and property damage. Throughout the island of Shikoku, 14people were killed. In Mishima, two landslides claimed {{a total of four}} lives. Another landslide in Tsukude killed a 53-year old man, a 78-year old women, and a 14-year old girl. Hokkaido suffered the most severe flooding in 10years. Several major rivers on the island overflowed their banks, leaving towns inundated <b>and</b> <b>isolated.</b> Around 1,200residents in Tsukigata were evacuated after a nearby river overflowed its banks.|$|E
5|$|In mid-February, Wellington's army {{broke out}} of its small area of conquered {{territory}} near Bayonne. Moving east, the Allies drove the French back from several river lines. After a pause in the campaign, the western-most Allied corps surrounded <b>and</b> <b>isolated</b> Bayonne. Resuming their eastward drive, the remaining two Allied corps pushed Soult's army back to Orthez where the French marshal offered battle. In subsequent operations, Soult decided to abandon the large western port of Bordeaux and fall back east toward Toulouse. The next action was the Battle of Toulouse.|$|E

Deuce N' Domino took advantage of Hardy and MVP's fight with each other <b>and</b> <b>isolated</b> Hardy. Hardy tossed MVP {{out of the ring}} and delivered a Twist of Fate to Deuce and pinned Deuce. In result, MVP and Matt Hardy retained the WWE Tag Team Title.|$|E
5|$|It {{has been}} found that urban populations of common toad occupying small areas <b>and</b> <b>isolated</b> by {{development}} show a lower level of genetic diversity and reduced fitness as compared to nearby rural populations. The researchers demonstrated this by genetic analysis and by noting the greater number of physical abnormalities among urban as against rural tadpoles when raised in a controlled environment. It was considered that long term depletion in numbers and habitat fragmentation can reduce population persistence in such urban environments.|$|E
5|$|Nesomys narindaensis is an extinct rodent {{that lived}} in northwestern Madagascar.

The presence of N.narindaensis, a rare element in the local rodent fauna, suggests that the region was previously more humid.|$|E

5|$|On 9 February 2014, Swiss voters {{narrowly}} {{approved by}} 50.3% a ballot initiative {{launched by the}} national conservative Swiss People's Party (SVP/UDC) to restrict immigration, and thus reintroducing a quota system on the influx of foreigners. This initiative was mostly backed by rural (57.6% approvals) and suburban agglomerations (51.2% approvals), <b>and</b> <b>isolated</b> towns (51.3% approvals) of Switzerland {{as well as by}} a strong majority (69.2% approval) in the canton of Ticino, while metropolitan centres (58.5% rejection) and the French-speaking part (58.5% rejection) of Switzerland rather rejected it. Some news commentators claim that this proposal de facto contradicts the bilateral agreements on the free movement of persons from these respective countries.|$|E
