5|$|<b>Although</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> {{gained a}} {{significant}} online presence, it was successful {{before the advent}} of Internet communities.

5|$|<b>Although</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> {{not been}} shown {{experimentally}} if the spores can survive the passage through an animal's digestive tract, the regular presence of Cyathus on cow or horse manure {{strongly suggest that}} this is true. Alternatively, the hard outer casing of peridioles ejected from splash cups may simply disintegrate over time, eventually releasing the spores within.|$|E
5|$|During {{the late}} 19th and 20th centuries the {{importance}} of the wool trade in the village declined and it became largely a dormitory area for the cities of Bristol and Bath, <b>although</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> continued to be the commercial centre of the valley.|$|E
5|$|Exmoor {{also has}} a henge located near to Parracombe, <b>although</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> been damaged by ploughing. Alongside this, the moor bears a profusion of other Bronze Age monuments, {{including}} between 300 and 400 round barrows, standing stones, and linear stone settings. The creation of these different monument types might explain why so few stone circles were apparently created here.|$|E

5|$|Organometallic {{chemistry}} of vanadium is well developed, <b>although</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> mainly only academic significance. Vanadocene dichloride is a versatile starting reagent and even finds some applications in organic chemistry. Vanadium carbonyl, V(CO)6, {{is a rare}} example of a paramagnetic metal carbonyl. Reduction yields V (isoelectronic with Cr(CO)6), which may be further reduced with sodium in liquid ammonia to yield V (isoelectronic with Fe(CO)5).|$|E

5|$|The Anthology of Pliny's Natural History is an {{epitome of}} Pliny the Elder's Natural History {{dedicated}} to King Henry II of England.

5|$|The fungus {{probably}} favours calcareous soil, <b>although</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> {{been found}} {{on nearly every}} soil type. It appears on sand, peat, limestone soils, rankers and Cambisols. It endures acidic as well as alkaline and low-nutrient to relatively high-nutrient soils. Heavily eutrophic soils are inappropriate for its habitat.|$|E
5|$|This {{species is}} mainly diurnal, {{especially}} {{in the north of}} its range. Further south it is said to be active in the evening, and it may even be active at night during the summer months. It is predominantly a terrestrial species, <b>although</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> been known to climb up banks and into low bushes in order to bask or search for prey.|$|E

5|$|US-64 {{has been}} a part of the United States Numbered Highways system from the program's {{inception}} in 1926.

5|$|A recent calm period, {{with almost}} no {{earthquake}} or magmatic activity at Hualālai, has seen the growth of homes, businesses, and resorts on the mountain's flanks. The most recent major activity at the volcano was in 1929, when an intense earthquake swarm rocked Hualālai, most likely caused by magmatic action near the volcano's peak. <b>Although</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> been relatively placid in the recent past, Hualālai is still potentially active, {{and is expected to}} erupt again within the next 100years.|$|E
5|$|A tidal {{disruption}} {{event of}} this sort is when a star interacts with a supermassive black hole shredding the star, {{and in some cases}} creating a relativistic jet which produces bright emission of gamma ray radiation. The event GRB 110328A (also denoted Swift J1644+57) was initially argued to be produced by the disruption of a main sequence star by a black hole of several million times the mass of the Sun, <b>although</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> subsequently been argued that the disruption of a white dwarf by a black hole of mass about 10 thousand times the Sun may be more likely.|$|E
