The Test XI {{suffered}} a big defeat, due to Bradman's 212 {{and a bag}} of twelve wickets by leg-spinner Frank Ward. Rather undiplomatically, Bradman let the members of the Test team know that despite their recent success, they were not quite <b>as</b> <b>good</b> <b>as</b> <b>they</b> believed themselves to be.|$|E

The game played out on even footing with Preston giving <b>as</b> <b>good</b> <b>as</b> <b>they</b> got in the early stage until Tottenham finally got the breakthrough and ended the game with a 5–1 victory with Peter Crouch scoring a hat-trick in the process.|$|E

25|$|Analysts and pollsters offered {{different}} opinions on whether smaller extraparliamentary parties had chances to enter parliament or not. According to some pollsters, the FRITZ had very good {{chances of getting}} into parliament, and the LIF with its founder Schmidt as its leading candidate, as well; the conditions were <b>as</b> <b>good</b> <b>as</b> <b>they</b> had never been before for smaller parties, according to some. Analysts agreed that apart from LIF and FRITZ, all others would fail to enter parliament. Analysts furthermore asserted that the candidacy of the FRITZ would likely make the race for third place between Greens and FPÖ very competitive, as the FRITZ would likely gain protest votes which would otherwise go to the FPÖ. The critical time for the extraparliamentary parties was stated {{to be the very}} first phase of the campaign, when the larger parties had not yet really started campaigning and the smaller parties had a chance to gain publicity.|$|E
500|$|The Sooners {{began their}} season on September 2 against the UAB Blazers coached by Watson Brown. The Sooners' offense {{performed}} well with quarterback Paul Thompson completing 58% {{of his passes}} for 227yards. Heisman hopeful Adrian Peterson performed well also, rushing for 139yards, plus an additional 69-yard reception and two touchdowns. However, the Oklahoma defense did not perform as well as expected, giving up over 300yards of offense. Bob Stoops himself said that [...] "they weren't nearly <b>as</b> <b>good</b> <b>as</b> <b>they</b> were billed to be."

However it does seem that Staunton was involved in more than his fair share of chess disputes. H. J. R. Murray suggested that these frequent wars of words may have originated from leading players' and commentators' jealousy over Staunton's unexpected {{rise to the top}} in the early 1840s, and from snobbish disdain about his humble and possibly illegitimate birth. Saidy and Lessing wrote that, [...] "He can hardly be blamed if the struggles and privations of his youth warped his character so that he became a jealous, suspicious, and vitriolic man." ...|$|E

500|$|Scarponi, {{as well as}} John Gadret, {{the rider}} {{elevated}} onto the podium now in third place overall, both expressed sympathy for Contador and the feeling that being awarded these prestigious results {{in a court of}} law nearly a year after the race concluded kept them from feeling <b>as</b> <b>good</b> <b>as</b> <b>they</b> would were they attained on the road. Both Scarponi's overall championship and Gadret's podium finish constituted the first such results for either of them in a Grand Tour. Gadret, who had supported Contador's presence in the Giro peloton when the race began, reconsidered his position in hindsight, saying the Spaniard's attendance irrevocably changed the race. Further reactions from other personalities within the sport toward the ruling and the case itself were near universally negative. WADA celebrated the decision, calling the court [...] "robust and thorough" [...] in its jurisprudence of the World-Anti Doping Code.|$|E

IGN's Colin Moriarty argued the game as a major improvement over the original Mega Man and that it even surpasses the critically acclaimed Mega Man 2 in quality. Moriarty justified this claim with the third installment's attempt at better storytelling, its longer length than any other classic Mega Man game, and its inclusion of all eight Mega Man 2 Robot Masters {{in addition to its}} own. Brett Alan Weiss (AllGame) described it as doing what [...] "a great sequel is supposed to do by recapturing the fun, spirit and excitement of its predecessors while adding new levels, characters and challenges." ...|$|E

Jon Wiederhorn of Entertainment Weekly called it [...] "the {{heaviest}} and most danceable disc in [...] 12-year career" [...] while giving it an A-. Heidi MacDonald of CMJ New Music Monthly compared Xtort to getting {{hit with a}} wrecking ball, saying, [...] "When KMFDM does what it does best, {{it is the best}} at what it does, namely jack-hammer industrial anthems that hit with stunning precision and power." [...] Sandy Masuo of Rolling Stone called the album [...] "the product of a first-rate lineup," [...] and praised the album's diversity, saying, [...] "The 10 tracks on Xtort are grounded in KMFDM's smart synthesis of metallic crunch, swiveling rhythms and sophisticated electronics, but it's the organic elements that give the album a zesty twist." [...] Kevin M. Williams of the Chicago Sun-Times gave the album an [...] "essential" [...] rating, and said, [...] "KMFDM has some major mojo working with Xtort".Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic was less enthusiastic, saying, [...] "it would be nice to hear [...] branch out and start to experiment a little bit more", and commenting that while Xtort did not sound much different from previous releases, [...] "KMFDM sounds <b>as</b> <b>good</b> <b>as</b> <b>they</b> ever have, and several tracks rank among their best."

They settled in Glen Ellyn where, Chuck established a youth football program. Together with Tom Hoffman, Chuck coached both the Churchill Blue Raiders and Glen Ellyn Rams. During the Rams' first year, Larry Krupp served as student manager of the team. In 2004, Ortmann was inducted into the University of Michigan Athletic Hall of Honor. Asked about the honor, Ortmann modestly said: “When fans start talking about putting an all-time Michigan team together, I think they're wrong to pick someone from the old era. I led the Big Ten one year with 750 yards running and passing. A guy like John Navarre has as many yards and passes in a game as I did in a season.
