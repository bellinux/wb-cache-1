The objective of this work is to use the linear SAM models to study how inequality is modified by several exogenous injections of income. The set of multipliers and indicators presented is applied to the economy of Extremadura - a region situated in the southwest of Spain-. In particular, together with the accounting multipliers, two redistributed income matrices are presented to show how changes in final demand and in income transfers cause opposite effects in inequality. For contrasting these results, we also use Gini and Theil indices. Finally, a major reduction in both would result from an appropriate re-allocation of transfers...|$|E

A NAM is defined as the presentation of a sequence of integrated accounts and balancing items in a matrix that elaborates the linkages between a supply and use table and institutional sector accounts.

This paper develops the theory of aggregation and applies it to the social <b>accounting</b> <b>matrix</b> model of multipliers. First, we define the concept of linear aggregation in a SAM database context. Second, we define the aggregated partitioned matrices of multipliers which are characteristic of the SAM approach.
