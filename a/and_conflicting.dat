5|$|After {{finishing}} Scandal, Kurosawa {{was approached}} by Daiei studios, which asked the director to make another film for them. Kurosawa picked a script by an aspiring young screenwriter, Shinobu Hashimoto, with whom he would eventually work on nine of his films. Their first joint effort was based on Ryūnosuke Akutagawa's experimental short story In a Grove, which recounts {{the murder of a}} samurai and the rape of his wife from various different <b>and</b> <b>conflicting</b> points-of-view. Kurosawa saw potential in the script, and with Hashimoto's help, polished and expanded it and then pitched it to Daiei, who were happy to accept the project due to its low budget.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{unfavourable}} currency conditions <b>and</b> <b>conflicting</b> {{pressures on}} the military budget, several prospective procurements of modern aircraft such as the SEPECAT Jaguar and the British Aerospace Sea Harrier were put on hold following the 1971 war; the indigenously developed HAL HF-24 Marut had also not been as successful as hoped, thus the IAF decided to retain the ageing fleets of Hunters and English Electric Canberra bombers. After considering several foreign aircraft to replace the Hunter, including the Dassault Mirage F1, the Saab 37 Viggen, and several Soviet models, the Indian government announced its intention to procure 200 Jaguars, {{a large portion of}} which were to be assembled domestically, in October 1978. In 1996, the last of the IAF's Hunters were phased out of service, the remaining single squadron operating the Hunter converting to the newer Sukhoi Su-30MKI.|$|E
5|$|Limousins {{generally}} have {{lower levels of}} intra-muscular fat (marbling) and subcutaneous fat when compared with British breed cattle grown in similar conditions. Marbling, together with tenderness and flavour, {{has been associated with}} eating quality in some countries, and attracts a higher quality grading with associated premiums, although the link between marbling and palatability is not universally supported. In some countries, Limousin's lean, tender meat is considered to be of outstanding quality and marketed through specialist outlets. Beef producers targeting the higher marbling specifications of some markets, but who have concerns over the poorer feed conversion efficiency and yield associated with higher marbling British breed cattle, use Limousin sires over British breed cows, or British breed sires over Limousin cows, in crossbreeding programmes that aim to achieve a balance between the different <b>and</b> <b>conflicting</b> production demands.|$|E
40|$|Intergroup {{competition}} <b>and</b> <b>conflict</b> are pervasive {{problems in}} human society, {{giving rise to}} such phenomena as prejudice, terrorism, ethnic cleansing, and interstate war (Choi & Bowles, 2007; Fiske, 2002). This chapter reviews classic and contemporary theory and research on (a) the origins of intergroup competition <b>and</b> <b>conflict,</b> <b>and</b> (b) the way humans regulate intergroup competition <b>and</b> <b>conflict.</b> To some extent, this chapter builds on earlier analyses of interpersonal <b>and</b> small-group <b>conflict</b> (de Dreu, 2008, 2010 a; Tyler & Blader, 2003). Although interpersonal and small-group competition <b>and</b> <b>conflict</b> share critical features with intergroup competition <b>and</b> <b>conflict,</b> the latter includes structural features and psychological mechanisms not present in the former. Specifically, intergroup competition <b>and</b> <b>conflict</b> operate at two distinct yet closely intertwined levels of analysis: that {{of the individual and}} that of the group to which one belongs (henceforth, the in-group). Intergroup competition <b>and</b> <b>conflict</b> thus represents an amalgam of individual self-interests, values, and beliefs that converge into and are informed by group interests, values, and beliefs, and both the individual and group-level interests, values, and beliefs are shaped by and instrumental to the intergroup competition <b>and</b> <b>conflict...</b>|$|R
40|$|Markets {{exist within}} {{a world of}} {{constant}} exchanges which {{form the basis for}} changes and the creation of new markets. Therefore, it is important to research these exchanges. One of the areas in which market creation can be observed is interorganisational collaborations, as firms increasingly collaborate to create markets. In market creation practice, however, interorganisational tension <b>and</b> <b>conflict</b> can form from divergent approaches and vested interests of the partners. Interorganisational tension represents the opposing intentions of interorganisational forces, <b>and</b> <b>conflict</b> is generated through disagreements. The aim of this research is to investigate interorganisational tension <b>and</b> <b>conflict</b> on market creation practice. Specifically, it attempts to: (i) expand interorganisational tension <b>and</b> <b>conflict</b> <b>and</b> provide insights to these concepts, as well as establishing a two-dimensional interorganisational tension (productive and unproductive) understanding, (ii) explore the interactions between interorganisational tension <b>and</b> <b>conflict,</b> (iii) develop a conceptual framework that explains the level of market creation depending on the effects of interorganisational tension <b>and</b> <b>conflict,</b> (iv) develop a typology of partnering firms based on interorganisational tension <b>and</b> <b>conflict</b> practice. To achieve this aim, and to respond to the research calls, this study follows a grounded theory approach which intends to expand the understanding of interorganisational tension <b>and</b> <b>conflict.</b> According to the findings, a major characteristic of interorganisational tension is its two dimensions: productive and unproductive. However, it is the intertwined nature of tension <b>and</b> <b>conflict</b> that influences market creation. Fundamental to these are the six interorganisational tension <b>and</b> three <b>conflict</b> types revealed by the findings of this study. The core theoretical contributions of the study are a dynamic framework that portrays the dynamic interactions between interorganisational tension <b>and</b> <b>conflict</b> on market creation practice, and a typology of market-creating partnering firms. Collectively, they explicate the development of market creation practice, and firms’ reactions to interorganisational tension <b>and</b> <b>conflict...</b>|$|R

5|$|While {{many sources}} {{recommend}} additional intravenous agents to reduce {{damage to the}} kidney, most of the evidence supporting this practice comes from animal studies, and is inconsistent <b>and</b> <b>conflicting.</b> Mannitol acts by osmosis to enhance urine production and is thought to prevent myoglobin deposition in the kidney, but its efficacy has not been shown in studies {{and there is a}} risk of worsening kidney function. The addition of bicarbonate to the intravenous fluids may alleviate acidosis (high acid level of the blood) and make the urine more alkaline to prevent cast formation in the kidneys; evidence suggesting that bicarbonate has benefits above saline alone is limited, and it can worsen hypocalcemia by enhancing calcium and phosphate deposition in the tissues. If urine alkalinization is used, the pH of the urine is kept at 6.5 or above. Furosemide, a loop diuretic, is often used to ensure sufficient urine production, but evidence that this prevents kidney failure is lacking.|$|E

40|$|Psychologists {{know that}} peace <b>and</b> <b>conflict</b> form the {{conditions}} within which psychological lives are actually lived, {{and that those}} lives make up social contexts of peace <b>and</b> <b>conflict.</b> Psychologists also share an understanding that peace <b>and</b> <b>conflict</b> are anything but simple. These little words “peace” and “conflict” are used to name very different and determining configurations of events in different places and times, and the naming of such configurations as peaceful or warlike is itself a social action that affects the social contexts so described. In his term as associate editor of Peace <b>and</b> <b>Conflict,</b> P. Hegarty aims to encourage new research that incorporates a reflexive understanding of psychologists’ work in naming, explaining, and intervening in peace <b>and</b> <b>conflict.</b> As a historian of psychology, he wants to insist on recognition that the peace <b>and</b> <b>conflict</b> that we study and our ways of studying them are historical. He urges new empirical research to examine contemporary peace <b>and</b> <b>conflict</b> {{as part of an}} “eventful psychology” that will be all the more impactful for the recognition that it is situated in history...|$|R
