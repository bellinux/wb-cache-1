40|$|Due to {{the ongoing}} trend towards <b>application</b> <b>service</b> <b>provisioning</b> (ASP), the {{monitoring}} of user-oriented quality of service (QoS) parameters (e. g., transaction duration) is gaining more and more momentum. However, most techniques currently used for application management cannot provide this kind of user-oriented information. At present, only instrumentation techniques are suited to provide the required information. On the other hand instrumentation techniques cause considerable efforts due {{to the need to}} insert code into an application to be monitored. Therefore they are hardly used today. The architecture proposed in this paper greatly reduces the efforts of management instrumentation by utilizing the component based structure of future applications. Additionally, a means for automated correlation of transactions based on control flows is introduced. Thus, the proposed architecture lays the foundation for a widespread use of application instrumentation...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: In this paper, we analyse <b>Application</b> <b>Service</b> <b>Provisioning</b> (ASP) {{by means}} of a {{framework}} derived from the strategic network approach presented in the management strategy literature. Our ex-post analysis focuses on a failed ASP project, in which a small software company and a large telecommunications operator formed an alliance in order to launch an innovative ASP software offering in the market. The objective of the paper is to operationalize the new strategic network oriented concepts in order to better understand and manage problems in developing integrated ASP offerings. Our results from both conceptual and empirical work indicate that several important new issues can be raised if the ASP integration is examined as a strategic network (a kind of software ecosystem). We propose a framework that identifies these factors and test its power to predict success or failure in our case. On the basis of our analyses, we propose practical guidelines to be followed when moving from the management of products and services to the management of an ASP partnership network...|$|E

Application Service Providers are companies that provision software applications over the Internet. The ASP will change traditional software businesses by turning software applications from products to services. This study researched {{the state of the}} current software business, ASP and the ability of Finnish software companies to gain partners in the international ASP competition based on the situation in November 2000. The current state of ASP business was examined by researching literature and four Finnish software companies that make use or are going to make use of ASP in the future. Because the concept of ASP is new, the amount of previous researches concerning ASP is very limited. The current state of software companies in this research is based on a study made by Forsell and Nukari in 1999 and on an international research of 100 software firms made by Harvard Business School in 1999. In this research it was found out that Finnish ASPs seek value added service and technology partners {{on the basis of their}} quality and trustworthiness. The partners co-operate in marketing, support and research. The current ASP market is fast changing, fast growing, immature and uncertain, but the faith in it is very strong. Finnish companies regard finding competent partners difficult because of the still immature market. Technology and security do not prevent the widespread use of ASP. The keys to success in the ASP market are co-operation with qualified partners, specializing in existing strengths, and qualitative and secure software products...|$|E
30|$|Big data {{analytics}} {{is associated with}} cloud computing (e.g. [1, 77]; [79], an Internet-based computing model that is increasingly seen as the most suitable solution for highly resource intensive and collaborative applications as an on-demand network access to a shared pool of computing resources (memory capacity, energy, computational power, network bandwidth, interactivity, etc.) [1, 7, 80]. This entails that computer-processing resources, which reside in the cloud, are virtualized and dynamic, which implies that only display devices for information and services need to be physically present in relation to urban domains where diverse stakeholders (administrators, planners, landscape architects, sustainability strategists, authorities, citizens, etc.) can make use of software applications and services to improve sustainability. Such stakeholders can access cloud-based software applications through a web browser and a lean client (a computer program that depends on its server to fulfill its computational roles) or mobile devices while software tools and urban data of all kinds are stored on servers at a remote location. Indeed, cloud computing model is based on hosted services {{in the sense of}} <b>application</b> <b>service</b> <b>provisioning</b> running client server software locally. In this respect, smart sustainable city applications pertaining to transport, traffic, mobility, energy, public health, civil security, education, and so on reside ‘in the cloud’ and can be accessible per demand. Moreover, the software development platform can be offered in a public, private, or hybrid network, where the cloud provider manages the platform that runs the applications and relieves the cloud clients from the burden of securing dedicated platforms, which would otherwise be very demanding and costly in terms of resources and time. The cloud clients can accordingly benefit from tested, scalable, reliable, and maintainable platforms offered by the cloud provider. Another advantage involves service process optimization through advanced functionalities of software development platforms, namely flexibility, interoperability, reusability, scalability, and cooperation. There is also a great opportunity to slash or minimize energy consumption associated with the operation of ICT infrastructure, {{especially when it comes to}} large-scale deployments like in the case of smart sustainable cities as to different departments and service agencies. Beloglazov et al. [81] develop policies and algorithms that aim at increasing energy efficiency in cloud computing. Energy consumption is way too lower than if all urban entities have their own software development platforms. These are indeed shared by multiple users as well as dynamically reallocated per demand. This approach maximizes the use of computational power and reduces energy usage and thus mitigate GHG emissions associated otherwise with powering a variety of functions as well as data centers dispersed throughout the departments and service agencies of smart sustainable cities. Whether public or private, the cloud provider includes the cloud environment’s servers, storage, networking, and data center operations. This implies that the cloud provider has the actual energy-consuming computational resources; users or clients can simply log on to the network without installing anything, thereby curbing energy usage and making the best of the available computational power. Energy efficiency in cloud computing can result from energy-aware scheduling and server consolidation [82]. Mastelic et al. [83] provides a survey on energy efficiency in cloud computing. Also, cloud computing is seen as a form of green computing, especially if it is based on renewable energy like solar panels. It has other intuitive benefits because it relies on sharing of resources and maximizing the effectiveness of the shared resources, thereby reducing the costs otherwise incurred by ICT operations as to human, technical, and organizational resources. In cloud computing, supercomputers in large data centers as a distributed system of many servers are used to deliver services in a scalable manner as well as to enable the storage and processing of vast quantities of data. Cloud computing offers great opportunities for streamlining data processing [84]. In all, cloud computing constitutes an efficient and elegant solution in terms of facilitating the huge demand for computing resources associated with big {{data analytics}} for decision-making processes in relation to the operational functioning and planning of cities in terms of sustainability. Through the use of cloud computing, smart sustainable cities can accordingly have higher possibilities to perform more effectively and efficiently thanks to the advanced technological features underlying the functioning of cloud computing model.|$|E

Our conclusion {{is that there is a}} clear role for the ASP but that the buyers (most notably, those large organisations who want a third party to manage their software applications) need to be fully aware of the pros and cons of using one. At the same time, the suppliers need to consider how well the architecture of their delivery platforms fits with the service they are offering. The Patien...|$|R

40|$|The <b>Application</b> <b>Service</b> <b>Provision</b> (ASP) model offers {{access to}} {{centrally}} managed and hosted applications, via the Internet, on a subscription / rental basis. From {{its inception in}} the late 1990 s, many have heralded the ASP delivery model as {{the new wave of}} IT outsourcing. Initially however, uptake of the ASP paradigm failed to match the hype, due in no small part to the de-valuation of dot. com share prices in early 2000, which caused the closure of numerous on-line service providers, and which eroded the confidence of many with regard to renting application access. However uptake of the ASP model is steadily increasing (recent estimates indicate spending on software-as-a service should reach 15. 2 billion by 2007) and the emergence of hosted applications from key industry players indicate that the delivery of software-as-a-service may become an increasing feature of software product releases. Presented herein, is a framework, including the architecture and system configuration required, to ensure High Availabilityand Optimum System Performance in an <b>Application</b> <b>Service</b> Provider (ASP) Envimoment. This thesis contends that High Availability and Scalability are becoming increasingly important components of overall system architectures.
