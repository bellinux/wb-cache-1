In February 2013 Benn was among those who gave their support to the People's Assembly in a letter published by The Guardian newspaper.

5|$|In <b>a</b> <b>speech</b> <b>at</b> the Berlin Geographical Society in 1919, Detzner {{claimed that}} the natives of New Guinea had opposed Australian {{domination}} and resisted a military recruitment that amounted to slavery, that even the English plantation holders wished to remain independent of Australia, and that the natives were collecting money to build a war memorial for the Germans. The report on Detzner's speech, transmitted from a news agency in London, caused a small flutter in Australian government circles, but generally was dismissed; an earlier report by the Australian judiciary had absolved the Australian force of improper recruiting or treatment of the New Guineans. An angry {{letter to the editor}} from another Australian source, who claimed to have been in service in Morobe from 1914–1915, received little attention.|$|E

5|$|In {{the years}} {{following}} the Spanish Civil War, Hitler gave several possible motives for German involvement. Among these were the distraction it provided from German re-militarisation; the prevention of the spread of communism to Western Europe; {{the creation of a}} state friendly to Germany to disrupt Britain and France; and the possibilities for economic expansion. Although the offensive on Madrid was abandoned in March 1937, a series of attacks on weaker Republican-controlled areas was supported by Germany; despite prolonging the Civil War, it would help to distract the other western powers from Hitler's ambitions in central Europe. The offensive on Vizcaya, a mining and industrial centre, would help fuel German industry. On 27 June 1937, Hitler (in <b>a</b> <b>speech</b> <b>at</b> Wurzburg) declared he supported Franco to gain control of Spanish ore.|$|E
