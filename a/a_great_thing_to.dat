500|$|A {{modified}} and fictionalized {{account of}} the Baird nomination formed the core of Wendy Wasserstein's 1996 play An American Daughter, which was later made into a 2000 television film. [...] Wasserstein saw the episode, {{as well as what}} happened to Wood, as an example of double standards and sexism, and used it as a vehicle to explore the nature and status of American feminism as of the 1990s. [...] She said of its role in illustrating feminist issues, [...] "I mean, if Nannygate hadn't existed, what <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> make up as a way of talking about it." [...] An American Daughter became one of Wasserstein's most ambitious works, and also her most political.|$|E
500|$|In {{the years}} after the 1918 Armistice, Pankhurst {{continued}} to promote her nationalist vision of British unity. She maintained a focus on women's empowerment, but her days of fighting with government officialdom were over. She defended the presence and reach of the British Empire: [...] "Some talk about the Empire and Imperialism {{as if it were}} something to decry and something to be ashamed of. t is <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> be the inheritors of an Empire like ours... great in territory, great in potential wealth.... If we can only realise and use that potential wealth we can destroy thereby poverty, we can remove and destroy ignorance." [...] For years she travelled around England and North America, rallying support for the British Empire and warning audiences about the dangers of Bolshevism.|$|E
500|$|Inside No. 9, for Pemberton, {{offered the}} [...] "perfect vehicle" [...] for revisiting the {{possibility}} of dialogue-free television. Shearsmith said that, {{at the start of}} the writing process, the pair did not have the intention of scripting the entire episode without dialogue, and that it would be [...] "great" [...] to have ten minutes without it. However, Pemberton said it was easier to write once they had entered the correct [...] "mindset". Once half an episode had been written, Pemberton said, the pair thought [...] "we've just got to keep going". The only dialogue in the episode is right at the end; [...] "what <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> get to the end and just have one line of dialogue", Pemberton suggested, comparing the concept to that of the Mel Brooks film Silent Movie.|$|E

500|$|On March 20, they sailed {{first to}} England, where Crane was warmly received. [...] They arrived in Athens in early April; between April 17 (when Turkey {{declared}} war on Greece) and April 22, Crane wrote his first published report of the war, [...] "An Impression of the 'Concert'". [...] When he left for Epirus in the northwest, Taylor remained in Athens, where she became the Greek war's first woman war correspondent. [...] She wrote under the pseudonym [...] "Imogene Carter" [...] for the New York Journal, a job that Crane had secured for her. [...] They wrote frequently, traveling throughout the country separately and together. [...] The first large battle that Crane witnessed was the Turks' assault on General Constantine Smolenski's Greek forces at Velestino. [...] Crane wrote, [...] "It is <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> survey {{the army of the}} enemy. [...] Just where and how it takes hold upon the heart is difficult of description." [...] During this battle, Crane encountered [...] "a fat waddling puppy" [...] that he immediately claimed, dubbing it [...] "Velestino, the Journal dog". Greece and Turkey signed an armistice on May 20, ending the 30-day war; Crane and Taylor left Greece for England, taking two Greek brothers as servants and Velestino the dog with them.|$|E
500|$|Before Megan Mullally {{was given}} the role of Karen, she had {{previously}} been cast as a series regular on sitcoms such as The Ellen Burstyn Show, My Life and Times, and Rachel Gunn. Mullally guest starred on many other shows, including Ned & Stacey, on which she first worked with Messing. Mullally informed her agent {{that she did not}} want to do any more sitcoms or auditions for sitcoms, during the time that Will & Grace came around. [...] "Because my feeling was, like, Look, I've done it. It's not clicking. It's not for me. But he [...] was always arguing the point that the right thing hadn't come along yet." [...] She initially auditioned for the role of Grace, but admitted that {{she did not want to}} audition for the part of Karen. When asked about Karen's voice, Mullally revealed that the voice was an [...] "instinctive thing". She also said, [...] "...I think it was just a feeling that I had that it would be better for the pace of the show and it would be funnier in some way, but I didn't know why. Karen has a lot of joy, even when she's in a bad mood. She's pretty much happy with who she is, and that is something I think is <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> play, because the character of Karen could have been very unlikeable, and I think she's likeable because she has joy and she can be very childlike." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{individual}} character arcs {{were laid out}} by the series' creative team, with Marvel's only initial guidelines being to work around Captain America: The Winter Soldier, which sees the organization S.H.I.E.L.D. destroyed. Jed Whedon said on this, [...] "if someone told you that concept, you'd think it was <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> have happen {{at the beginning of}} the show or the end of Season 3. To have it happen in the middle of your first season is an interesting kind of riddle". The writers worked to establish a [...] "regular day at S.H.I.E.L.D." [...] and the existing hierarchy, and then [...] "to blow that up, we knew the way to best illustrate that was by putting it on a personal level with our main man Coulson". Tancharoen elaborated that [...] "We see what it actually looks like for S.H.I.E.L.D. to crumble in Captain America 2, we see the Helicarriers literally barreling through the Triskelion, we see the massive destruction throughout the city, but the benefit of our show is we get to dive into the emotional toll of that." [...] Therefore, it was decided {{at the beginning of the}} series that one of the main characters would be a traitor, with Jed Whedon saying [...] "since this is an infiltration based on betrayal on a massive scale, we wanted to have it on the small scale, and have it be a really personal dagger to the heart." ...|$|E

2500|$|A free agent, Martínez did {{not sign}} {{with a major}} league team during the winter. In March, he joined the Dominican Republic's squad for the 2009 World Baseball Classic, {{in an attempt to}} {{showcase}} his arm. Martínez pitched six scoreless innings with 6 strikeouts and no walks, but the team was quickly eliminated from the tournament and no MLB contract was forthcoming. In July 2009, Phillies scouts evaluated Martínez in two simulated games against the Phillies DSL team, leading to a one-year, $1-million contract. Martínez told reporters, [...] "I would just like to be the backup. If I could be the backup, that would be <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> have—a healthy Pedro behind everybody else, in case something happens. That would be a great feeling to have on a team, eh?" ...|$|E
2500|$|Axelrod {{was born}} on the Lower East Side of Manhattan, New York City, {{and grew up in}} its Stuyvesant Town area. He was raised in a liberal Jewish family. His mother, Myril Bennett (née Davidson), was a {{journalist}} at PM, a liberal-leaning 1940s newspaper, and later an advertising executive at Young & Rubicam. [...] His father, Joseph Axelrod, was a psychologist and avid baseball fan, who migrated from Eastern Europe to the United States at the age of eleven. He attended Public School 40 in Manhattan. Axelrod's parents separated when he was eight years old. Axelrod traces his political involvement back to his childhood. Describing the appeal of politics, he told the Los Angeles Times, [...] "I got into politics because I believe in idealism. Just {{to be a part of}} this effort that seems to be rekindling the kind of idealism that I knew when I was a kid, it's <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> do. So I find myself getting very emotional about it." [...] At thirteen years old, he was selling campaign buttons for Robert F. Kennedy. After graduating from New York's Stuyvesant High School in 1972, Axelrod attended the University of Chicago, where he majored in Political Science.|$|E

2500|$|Debnam-Carey thanked Lexa's creators, and said, [...] "It {{has been}} an honour to portray [...] To envelop myself in her skin. To be given the freedom to {{represent}} a moment in our cultural and social zeitgeist—she has left a great imprint on me. I will miss her. May we meet again." [...] While at Paleyfest 2016 promoting Fear the Walking Dead, she addressed Lexa's death publicly for the first time. In an interview with Entertainment Weekly, {{she said she was}} [...] "surprised by the intensity and the fury" [...] that came from fans and she did not think [...] "anyone on the show expected such social outcry." [...] To Debnam-Carey, [...] "any attention we can draw to a movement like that is an amazing thing, and is <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> pursue and keep working towards." [...] She emphasized Lexa's death never came from a place of hate or negativity from the writers or Rothenberg, or anyone in the crew, and the death was purely a creative decision made due to her obligations to Fear the Walking Dead. [...] "I know obviously that it's hard when there are social issues going on and maybe they were dealt with in an insensitive way for some people," [...] stated Debnam-Carey. [...] "And I hate that people feel like that. That's really awful if people feel ostracized or targeted." [...] At her second Q panel weekend at Copenhagen Comic-Con, she said, [...] "It saddens me to think that this was an event that tarnished the show." ...|$|E
