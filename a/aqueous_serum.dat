40|$|Nonpolar {{paramagnetic}} additives {{mixed into}} the <b>aqueous</b> <b>serum</b> of colloidal polymer dispersions are {{absorbed by the}} polymer particles with a rate {{that depends on the}} diffusion coefficient of the additive in the polymer. The absorption leads to an immobilization of the additive which can be detected in the electron paramagnetic resonance spectrum. By fitting the time dependence of the immobilized fraction to the appropriate diffusion model, it is possible to determine the diffusion coefficient of the additive in the polymer if the polymer particles are approximately uniform in size. This opens up a new way to determine diffusion coefficients in the range between 10 (- 14) and 10 (- 17) cm(2) s(- 1), as are expected for low-molecular-weight additives in polymers below their glass- transition temperature...|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{impact of}} orange juice pulp on the {{physical}} release of limonene to the headspace of freshly prepared orange juice was evaluated both in-vitro and in-vivo. Atmospheric pressure chemical ionization mass spectrometry was used to analyse {{the impact of the}} matrix on the dynamic release of the volatile aroma compound, limonene, in orange juice. Pulp and <b>aqueous</b> <b>serum</b> was isolated (by centrifugation and filtration) from freshly prepared orange juice and subsequently reconstituted at varying pulp addition levels in serum (0 g/ 100  g– 20 g/ 100  g, wwb). The addition of pulp significantly enhanced the static headspace concentration of limonene with a 210 fold increase with 10 g/ 100  g pulp addition. In addition, pulp enhanced the ability of the orange juice serum to replenish limonene in the headspace after dynamic headspace dilution. The release of limonene was studied under realistic consumer consumption conditions (In-nose delivery) by atmospheric pressure chemical ionisation-mass spectrometry; pulp significantly enhanced the amount of limonene exhaled in the nasal airflow (retronasal delivery). Surprisingly, given the variations in limonene concentration, naïve consumers did not perceive samples as significantly different on consumption. This is presumably due to the wide range of other aroma compounds not evaluated in this study that contribute to the perceived aroma...|$|E
40|$|Tomato (Solanum Iycopersicum) puree {{is created}} by {{homogenising}} the flesh of tomato fruits. The viscosity of this material and the fibrous content is of commercial interest. Tomato puree consists of suspended particles (consisting of whole cells, broken cells and cellular fragments) in an <b>aqueous</b> <b>serum.</b> The contribution of the non-soluble and soluble material to tomato puree rheology was studied {{with reference to the}} varying composition of solids and firmness of tomato fruit at four stages of ripeness; mature green, breaker, pink and red ripe. When purees from the red ripe and the breaker fruit with initial total solids contents of approximately 5. 5 % were diluted to a range of total solids content (between 5 and 1 %), both samples decreased in viscosity with total solids. To observe the effect of the serum on tomato puree viscosity, the pellet fraction containing the particles was spun out of the tomato purees by centrifugation so that the particle fraction and the serum could be assessed separately. On further investigation, the viscosity of puree was shown to be affected only to a small degree by the viscosity of the serum. The fact that stirred viscosity was independent of whether the suspension medium constituted of sucrose solution or serum phase showed that little contribution to the viscosity is coming from the soluble hydrocolloids in the tomato sera. Most dominant for viscosity was the particle fraction. The particle fraction was affected by the maturity of the fruit which in turn was associated with changes in fruit texture, particle size and size distribution of the puree. The particles did not behave as rigid spheres, as shown by the large departure from the corresponding Krieger Dougherty fit (Krieger and Dougherty 1959), ripened fruit deviating the furthest. This suggested the more ripened fruit has softer (less rigid) particles, which was shown to have softer tissue before the pureeing process. This may also have made the tissue more susceptible to rupture into smaller particles during pureeing. Quantitative data for size distribution measured by laser light scattering show that as the tomato ripened from green to red, particles were smaller; the mean diameters for the particles in the four puree samples were 893 J. lm (mature green), 542 J. lm (breaker), 377 J. lm (pink), and 262 J. lm (red ripe) and of a broader size distribution. Pureed mature green (unripe) fruit were shown to offer more potential as an effective natural viscosifier for foods such as soups and sauces, but they may not meet requirements of taste or colour. The last part of this research (chapter 7) therefore focused on tomatoes with variations in their genes rather than ripeness, harvested at breaker + 7 days. Tomatoes at the same stage of ripeness from the Solanum pennel/ii tomato introgression lines (ILs) were grown and harvested from the glass houses at the University of Nottingham. A screening process was developed to compare the viscosity of small samples of tomato puree from 55 of the ILs, 164 fruits in total; the remaining 21 lines did not produce quantities of fruit sufficient for analysis. The samples were diluted with water to the same total solids of 3. 5 %. The mean stirred viscosity value for all the lines measured was 132 ± 45 cPo The viscosity was calculated from typically three replicate measurements on three individual fruits per line. Although the particle volume and weight fraction of the puree and the initial total solids content had a strong influence on stirred viscosity, it was shown that the variation between individual fruit was greater than that between the different ILs. Previous texture studies of the IL lines showed marked variations yet there was no clear relationship between the puree viscosities and the expected texture of the whole fruits.

Results: In serum, calcium levels did not statistically differ between non-diabetics and diabetics. The phosphorus level was also not significantly different. In the aqueous humor, however, while calcium levels did not differ significantly, the phosphorus levels in diabetics were considerably higher than those in non-diabetics.

Methods: In this exprimental study, 72 male wistar Rats (250 - 300 g) were divided into 6 groups equally {{and at the same}} maintenance condition. strptozotosin (60 mg/kg) was used for diabetes induction 2 - 6 groups and then feed all of groups with usual food and water freely and we give them the Tribulus terrestris Extract, Allium schoenoprasum and Walnut leaves aqueous extract, mixture of 3 extracts and Glibenclamide orderly and daily after 72 hour in 2 - 6 groups additional food and water. serum glucose were determined before the study, and at 1 th and 4 th weeks after the study. Results: serum glucose was significantly lower in diabetic Rats of 2 - 6 groups(P< 0. 001) but Walnut leaves aqueous extract had maximum effects (P= 0. 002). Also the results show that using mixture of 3 extract wont have more effects on decreasing serum glucose. Conclusion: In spite of better effects of Walnut leaves <b>aqueous</b> extract on <b>serum</b> glucose rather than Tribulus terrestris Extract and Allium schoenoprasum, we can use them just as complemented common Diabetic medicine. Also not only consume more than one medicine can have better effect on control of serum glucose but also due to medicinal mixed and inconsistent effects. ...|$|R
40|$|A {{series of}} new squaraine rotaxanes have been {{synthesized}} with a tetralactam macrocycle and stopper groups of varying sizes and functionalities. In chloroform solvent, the relative {{size of the}} stopper group appears to have little influence on the high mechanical stability of the rotaxane structure. There is no evidence for unthreading (sometimes referred to as deslipping), even {{in the presence of}} competing chloride salts or elevated temperatures. A difference in rotaxane stability emerges as the polarity of the organic solvent is increased. Squaraine rotaxanes with small stopper groups undergo unthreading in the polar aprotic solvent DMSO. However, a water soluble tetracarboxylic acid derivative was found to be highly stable in <b>aqueous</b> solvents containing <b>serum...</b>|$|R
40|$|A simple chromatographic {{procedure}} is {{reported for the}} determination of some less prescribed but equally important benzodiazepines (Clotiazepam, clozapine and pinazepam) in serum. The optimization studies {{have been made in}} CN, C 18 and C 8 columns, using mobile phase containing sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS) modified with either propanol, butanol or pentanol. The method proposed for the determination of the three benzodiazepines using a mobile phase of 0. 13 M SDS, 2. 4 % pentanol- 0. 01 M phosphate buffer- 0. 1 % triethylamine (pH 7) at 25 °C and UV detection (240 nm) in a C 8 column. The serum samples was injected directly, without any pretreatment, eluted in less than 8 min, in accordance to their relative polarities, as indicated by their octanol-water partition coefficients. The limits of detection (ng/mL) was in the 1. 6 to 5. 6 and 7 to 87 range, for <b>aqueous</b> and <b>serum</b> samples, respectively. Repeatability and intermediate precision was tested for three different concentrations of the drugs, resulting in the 0. 1 to 2 range. The results obtained here for the separation of the three benzodiazepines in serum were also counter checked at Department of Bio-analytical Chemistry, Universitat Jaume I, Castelló, Spain...|$|R
