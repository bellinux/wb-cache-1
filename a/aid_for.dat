5|$|Metcalfe {{opposed the}} spoils {{system and the}} {{doctrine}} of nullification. He favored protective tariffs and federal <b>aid</b> <b>for</b> internal improvements. He oversaw {{the establishment of a}} road connecting Shelbyville to Louisville. When President Andrew Jackson vetoed federal <b>aid</b> <b>for</b> a turnpike connecting Maysville and Lexington, Metcalfe continued constructing it with state funds. (The road is now a portion of U.S. Route 68.) Metcalfe's term also saw the commissioning of the state's first railroad and the beginning of plans for a canal at the Falls of the Ohio. At the governor's recommendation, the state legislature approved additional <b>aid</b> <b>for</b> education, and the creation of district schools.|$|E
5|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the storm, the Mexican Army provided <b>aid</b> <b>for</b> the people affected. A total of 110 communities requested assistance from the government. By September14, an estimated 200,000 food packages were distributed to the region. Damage repairs from Hurricane Frank totaled to 100million pesos ($8.3million USD).|$|E
5|$|By July9, 11municipalities across Quebec were {{declared}} disaster {{areas and}} made eligible for federal funding. Ten more municipalities were placed under this declaration on July11 following further damage assessments. The Canadian Red Cross provided residents in Marsoui {{with food and}} aid.

5|$|During the 1950s and 1960s, a {{time when}} federal <b>aid</b> <b>for</b> urban renewal was plentiful, Albany did not have growth in its economy or infrastructure. It lost more than 20 percent of its {{population}} during the Corning years, as people moved to newer housing in the suburbs, followed {{by most of the}} downtown businesses moving there as well. While cities across the country grappled with similar issues, the problems were magnified in Albany: interference from the Democratic political machine hindered progress considerably.|$|E
5|$|European {{banks are}} {{estimated}} to have incurred losses approaching €1 trillion between {{the outbreak of the}} financial crisis in 2007 and 2010. The European Commission approved some €4.5 trillion in state <b>aid</b> <b>for</b> banks between October 2008 and October 2011, a sum which includes the value of taxpayer-funded recapitalisations and public guarantees on banking debts. This has prompted some economists such as Joseph Stiglitz and Paul Krugman to note that Europe is not suffering from a sovereign debt crisis but rather from a banking crisis.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the passage}} of Sudal, {{officials}} in Yap {{declared a state of}} emergency, and a day after the typhoon struck, United States President George W. Bush ordered federal disaster <b>aid</b> <b>for</b> the FSM. The latter declaration provided funding for 75% of the debris removal cost and emergency services. Less than a week after the storm, the Pacific Islands Forum provided $11,500 to Yap for relief efforts. Over the subsequent weeks, the FSM government established a typhoon relief fund of about $250,000. Additionally, the United States government allocated $7,443,000 for relief efforts.|$|E

5|$|In January 1957, Diefenbaker {{took his}} place as Leader of the Official Opposition. In February, St. Laurent {{informed}} him that Parliament would be dissolved in April for an election on June 10. The Liberals submitted a budget in March; Diefenbaker attacked it for overly high taxes, failure to assist pensioners, {{and a lack of}} <b>aid</b> <b>for</b> the poorer provinces. Parliament was dissolved on April 12. St. Laurent was so confident of victory that he did not even bother to make recommendations to the Governor General to fill the 16 vacancies in the Senate.|$|E
5|$|In Pennsylvania, then-governor Dick Thornburgh {{allocated}} $1million {{in emergency}} <b>aid</b> <b>for</b> the disaster areas, and activated 600National Guardsmen {{to help with}} clean up. After nine water plants were closed, the companies relied on reserves to provide water supply to local residents while also encouraging cutting back on usage. About 2,900people in Washington County lost access to clean water.|$|E
5|$|In his {{writings}} Aflaq had been stridently {{in favor of}} free speech and other human rights and <b>aid</b> <b>for</b> the lower classes. During the Military Committee's gradual take over of power in Syria, Aflaq rallied against {{what he saw as}} the establishment of a military dictatorship, instead of the democracy for which Aflaq had planned. These ideals were never realized by the governments that used his ideology. Most scholars see the Assad government in Syria and Saddam Hussein's government in Iraq to have only employed Aflaq's ideology as a pretense for dictatorship.|$|E

5|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the storm, the Government of El Salvador was criticized for failing to keep the public well informed. It provided over $300,000 in aid and declared a state of emergency; additionally, a state of mourning was declared. The United Nations World Food program began distributing food set aside for victims of the El Salvador Civil War. The U.S. Embassy in Guatemala provided $25,000 in <b>aid</b> <b>for</b> the country. Mexican authorities rushed to supply food and water to the homeless.|$|E

5|$|On May22, a {{day after}} the typhoon struck the island, U.S. President Gerald Ford {{declared}} Guam a major disaster area. In September 1976, the United States Senate passed a bill that included <b>aid</b> <b>for</b> the storm victims. Ultimately, the U.S. government provided $200million in aid and reconstruction funding in the two years following the typhoon's passage. This included about $80million to repair Guam's military facilities, which took several years to complete. Following the typhoon's passage and through the 1980s, the island's wooden homes underwent the process of being replaced by safer concrete homes.|$|E
5|$|The 2007–2008 {{academic}} {{year was the}} most successful fundraising year to date for NYU, with the school raising $698 million in only the first 11 months of the year, representing a 70% increase in donations from the prior year.

5|$|The {{next most}} common use is as an <b>aid</b> <b>for</b> smoking cessation. Bupropion reduces the {{severity}} of nicotine cravings and withdrawal symptoms. Bupropion is helpful for smoking cessation in smokers with no history of depression; thus, the effectiveness of bupropion is not due to its antidepressant effect. A typical bupropion treatment course lasts up to twelve weeks, with people halting the use of tobacco about ten days into the course. Bupropion approximately doubles the chance of quitting smoking successfully. The effectiveness of bupropion is comparable to nicotine replacement therapy, but less effective than varenicline.|$|E
5|$|The twin {{policies}} of the Truman Doctrine and the Marshall Plan led to billions in economic and military <b>aid</b> <b>for</b> Western Europe, Greece, and Turkey. With the US assistance, the Greek military won its civil war. Under the leadership of Alcide De Gasperi the Italian Christian Democrats defeated the powerful Communist-Socialist alliance in the elections of 1948. At {{the same time there}} was increased intelligence and espionage activity, Eastern Bloc defections and diplomatic expulsions.|$|E
5|$|These {{additional}} {{revenues were}} expected, {{when combined with}} spending cuts including a reduction of $200 million in higher education spending, to meet the state's balanced-budget requirement. A clause was also inserted into the budget cutting state <b>aid</b> <b>for</b> schools that hold over $1 billion in endowments. The only school in New Jersey that fell into this category was Princeton University, which had an endowment with assets over $11 billion in 2006. The university that had the largest endowment next to Princeton {{at the time was}} Drew University which had a $225 million endowment fund.|$|E
