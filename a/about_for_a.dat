5|$|The Champs-Élysées in 1855 {{were not}} yet the grand avenue laid out by Baron Haussmann in the 1860s, but an unpaved allée. The public who were {{flocking}} to Offenbach's theatre {{in the summer and}} autumn of 1855 could not be expected to venture there in the depths of a Parisian winter. He cast <b>about</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> suitable venue and found the Théâtre des Jeunes Élèves, known also as the Salle Choiseul or Théâtre Comte, in central Paris. He entered into partnership with its proprietor and moved the Bouffes-Parisiens there for the winter season. The company returned to the Salle Lacaze for the 1856, 1857, and 1859 summer seasons, performing at the Salle Choiseul in the winter. Legislation enacted in March 1861 prevented the company from using both theatres, and appearances at the Salle Lacaze were discontinued.|$|E
5|$|The Comet 4 first flew on 27 April 1958 and {{received}} its Certificate of Airworthiness on 24 September 1958; {{the first was}} delivered to BOAC the next day. The base price of a new Comet 4 was around £1,140,000, equivalent to £ in today's pounds. The Comet 4 enabled BOAC to inaugurate the first regular jet-powered transatlantic services on 4 October 1958 between London and New York (albeit still requiring a fuel stop at Gander International Airport, Newfoundland, on westward North Atlantic crossings). While BOAC gained publicity as the first to provide transatlantic jet service, {{by the end of}} the month rival Pan American World Airways was flying the Boeing 707 on the same route, and in 1960 the Douglas DC-8 as well. The American jets were larger, faster, longer-ranged, and more cost-effective than the Comet. After analysing route structures for the Comet, BOAC reluctantly cast <b>about</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> successor, and in 1956 entered into an agreement with Boeing to purchase the 707.|$|E

He arranged to travel as a war correspondent to South Africa, fortified by a letter of recommendation to the high commissioner, Alfred Milner, from the Colonial Secretary, Joseph Chamberlain, {{who had been a}} friend of his father, and by a promise of a military attachment. His reputation was considerably improved by his war reports published in national newspapers, and by his own military exploits, particularly his capture by and escape from the Boers.|$|E

Their activities are watched by a teenage boy, Nicholas, whom Sir Ivor had brought from Russia to New Zealand, under the guise of caring for the boy until the dangerous situation in Russia abated. Although Nicholas is grateful to Sir Ivor for his help, he is extremely worried about his family, whom he has not heard <b>about</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> long time - and he is worried about the lack of information he receives whenever he asks Sir Ivor about them. Nicholas is also upset that Sir Ivor refuses to allow him to leave the house, or to have any friends of his own age.|$|E

25|$|French reconnaissances had {{confirmed}} Saxe in {{his belief}} that the allies would endeavour to relieve Tournai by attempting to force a passage from the south-east via the hamlet of Fontenoy and {{the small town of}} Antoing on the Scheldt. The French commander now cast <b>about</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> good spot where he might await the attack in security, finally settling on a potentially strong defensive position on {{the eastern side of the}} Scheldt, about 5 miles (~9km) south-east of Tournai. To guard against any break-out by the Dutch from within the besieged city the Marquis of Dreux-Brézé was left with 21,550 men in the trenches, and orders to contain the garrison of about 8,000 men at all costs. Louis XV took to the field in person, accompanied by his son Louis, and their enormous retinue. After observing the siege at Tournai, the King moved on to the Château de Calonne between Tournai and Antoing. That same day, 8 May, Saxe began to move his main troops into position to face the Pragmatic Army.|$|E
25|$|He {{was born}} in Chelsea, London. His father, a native of Lanark, {{had served as a}} soldier, losing an arm at the Battle of Fontenoy, and was admitted, first as an inmate, and {{afterwards}} as an outdoor pensioner, at Chelsea Hospital. Gillray commenced life by learning letter-engraving, at which he soon became adept. This employment, however, proved irksome to James, so he wandered <b>about</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> time with a company of strolling players. After a very checkered experience, he returned to London and was admitted as a student in the Royal Academy, supporting himself by engraving, and probably issuing a considerable number of caricatures under fictitious names. His caricatures are almost all in etching, some also with aquatint, and a few using stipple technique. None can correctly be described as engravings, although this term is often loosely used to describe them. Hogarth's works were the delight and study of his early years. Paddy on Horseback, which appeared in 1779, is the first caricature which is certainly his. Two caricatures on Admiral Rodney's naval victory at the Battle of the Saintes, issued in 1782, were among the first of the memorable series of his political sketches.|$|E
25|$|In 1712 {{when the}} War of the Spanish Succession was turning against Habsburg Austria, Prince Eugene of Savoy cast <b>about</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> way for his shaken troops {{to gain a}} success. He heard that the {{garrison}} of Fort de Knocque was weak and its security was lax. Eugene called for a partisan named La Rue, told him his plan to surprise the garrison and instructed him to call on the governor of Ostend to give him whatever help he needed. At the same time Eugene alerted Lieutenant General Robert Murray at Lille to hold some troops ready {{to assist in the}} coup. La Rue's free company and some troops from Ostend stealthily took position in gardens near the fort where they caught and killed two sentries. La Rue disguised several of his men as peasants with their loaded weapons concealed in a cart. Appearing before the fort, they called out that they wanted to sell their wares to the officers and were admitted. The first group of partisans seized the door to the fort. After that, it was easy for a second disguised group to burst into the fort to find most of the officers and men inside their barracks. A few men raised the alarm but they were rapidly subdued at sword and bayonet point. When Murray arrived, he found the garrison prisoners of war. The general put a Dutch garrison into the fort and returned to Lille.|$|E

After William Beckford sold Fonthill Abbey, in 1822, he was looking <b>about</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> {{suitable}} new seat, Prior Park was his first choice: [...] ""They wanted too much for it," [...] he recalled later; [...] "I should have liked it very much; it possesses such great capability of being made a very beautiful spot."

500|$|Mary's {{earliest}} {{years were}} happy ones, {{judging from the}} letters of William Godwin's housekeeper and nurse, Louisa Jones. But Godwin was often deeply in debt; feeling {{that he could not}} raise the children by himself, he cast <b>about</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> second wife. In December 1801, he married Mary Jane Clairmont, a well-educated woman with two young children of her own—Charles and Claire. [...] Most of Godwin’s friends disliked his new wife, describing her as quick-tempered and quarrelsome; but Godwin was devoted to her, and the marriage was a success. Mary Godwin, on the other hand, came to detest her stepmother. William Godwin's 19th-century biographer C. Kegan Paul later suggested that Mrs Godwin had favoured her own children over those of Mary Wollstonecraft.|$|E

500|$|Peggy's {{breast cancer}} storyline was devised at the {{suggestion}} of a scriptwriter in a story conference session and, according to the production staff, was an idea [...] "that had been knocking <b>about</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> long time." [...] In Lesley Henderson's book, Social Issues in Television Fiction, an EastEnders researcher explains that: [...] "A lot of illnesses [...] translate quite readily into strong dramatic material", and the experience of being hospitalised or waiting on test results is something everyone can identify with. The programme sought expert advice on [...] "storyline visuals" [...] {{from a variety of sources}} including cancer organisations, breast cancer charities and medical professionals. There were anticipated problems with running a breast cancer story, such as timing, characterisation, casting, and interweaving the plot with other ongoing storylines. A story editor has explained: [...] "EastEnders is perceived as being an issue-led show, but it isn't, it's character and story-led [...] If you haven't got the character to fulfill that storyline then it won't work. You've got to be careful to make sure that the illness actually impacts on the family dynamics and the character development." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1962, {{with the}} success of the Fantastic Four, Marvel Comics editor and head writer Stan Lee was casting <b>about</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> new superhero idea. He said the idea for Spider-Man arose from a surge in teenage demand for comic books, and the desire to create a {{character}} with whom teens could identify. In his autobiography, Lee cites the non-superhuman pulp magazine crime fighter the Spider (see also The Spider's Web and The Spider Returns) as a great influence, and in a multitude of print and video interviews, Lee stated he was further inspired by seeing a spider climb up a wall—adding in his autobiography that he has told that story so often he has become unsure of {{whether or not this is}} true. Although at the time teenage superheroes were usually given names ending with [...] "boy", Lee says he chose [...] "Spider-Man" [...] because he wanted the character to age as the series progressed, and moreover felt the name [...] "Spider-Boy" [...] would have made the character sound inferior to other superheroes. At that time Lee had to get only the consent of Marvel publisher Martin Goodman for the character's approval. In a 1986 interview, Lee described in detail his arguments to overcome Goodman's objections. Goodman eventually agreed to a Spider-Man tryout in what Lee in numerous interviews recalled as what would be the final issue of the science-fiction and supernatural anthology series Amazing Adult Fantasy, which was renamed Amazing Fantasy for that single issue, #15 (cover-dated August 1962, on sale June 5, 1962). In particular, Lee stated that the fact that it had already been decided that Amazing Fantasy would be cancelled after issue #15 was the only reason Goodman allowed him to use Spider-Man. While this was indeed the final issue, its editorial page anticipated the comic continuing and that [...] "The Spiderman ... will appear every month in Amazing." ...|$|E

500|$|... "If Paris {{were worth}} a mass to Henry IV, Boston {{was worth a}} conversion, in the Puritan sense, to William Phips." [...] The turmoil in England and William's {{accession}} to the throne had prompted New France's Governor {{to take advantage of}} the political turmoil in New England, launching a series of Indian raids across the northern frontier in 1689 and early 1690. [...] When a frontier town in Maine was overrun in early March 1690, the French were perceived as instigators and the provisional government of Massachusetts, began casting <b>about</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> major general to lead an expedition against the French in Acadia. Phips had not demonstrated military interests as a young man. During King Philip's War, when many took up arms, Phips built ships and cut lumber. John Knepp's journal testifies to Phips constitutional disinterest in military discipline. [...] Yet Phips control of the naval gunship, and his subsequent actions, seem to have suggested he was a good candidate to lead a large military expedition. Sewall writes: Saturday, March 22. Sir William Phips offers himself to go in person, the Governor [...] sends for me, and tells me of it, I tell the [...] Court; they send for Sir William who accepts to go, and is appointed to command the forces. Major Townsend relinquishes with thanks. Sir William had been sent to at first; but some feared he would not go; others thought his Lady would not consent. Court makes Sir William free and swear him Major General, and several others. Adjourn to Boston, Wednesday,14 night one o'clock.This is Sewall's entire entry and he has no entry for the next day. It shows that Phips, though knighted, and one of the richest men in the colony, and highly active on the colony's behalf, was not yet able to vote or serve under the provisional government, as they were following the old charter wherein only church members were free. The court, not the church, made Phips free on this Saturday, according to Sewall. Sewall was religiously devout and active in his church congregation and would not likely have misspoken or deliberately withheld information on this point. Sewall's diary is generally considered trustworthy and is widely referenced by historians.|$|E
