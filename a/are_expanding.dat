5|$|In 1983, {{less than}} 1% of hospice {{providers}} offered pediatric care; by 2001, that number {{had grown to}} 15%. The first pediatric hospice facility in the United States, the George Mark Children's House Hospice of San Francisco, opened in 2003. While pediatric hospice options <b>are</b> <b>expanding,</b> as of 2006 many adult-oriented hospice programs remained ill-prepared to handle younger populations.|$|E
5|$|In a 1960 paper, American {{astronomer}} Olin J. Eggen {{concluded that}} Capella {{was a member}} of the Hyades moving group, a group of stars moving in the same direction as the Hyades cluster, after analysing its proper motion and parallax. Members of the group are of a similar age, and those that are around 2.5 times as massive as the Sun have moved off the main sequence after exhausting their core hydrogen reserves and <b>are</b> <b>expanding</b> and cooling into red giants.|$|E
5|$|While {{the global}} {{financial}} system is edging toward greater stability, governments must deal with differing regional or national needs. Some nations are trying to orderly discontinue unconventional monetary policies installed to cultivate recovery, while others <b>are</b> <b>expanding</b> their scope and scale. Emerging market policymakers face a challenge of precision as they must carefully institute sustainable macroeconomic policies during extraordinary market sensitivity without provoking investors to retreat their capital to stronger markets. Nations' inability to align interests and achieve international consensus on matters such as banking regulation has perpetuated the risk of future global financial catastrophes.|$|E
50|$|Macros <b>are</b> <b>expanded</b> by preprocessor, before {{compilation}} proper; templates <b>are</b> <b>expanded</b> at compile time. Macros <b>are</b> always <b>expanded</b> inline; templates {{can also}} <b>be</b> <b>expanded</b> as inline functions when the compiler deems it appropriate. Thus both function-like macros and function templates have no run-time overhead.|$|R

5|$|Nocturnally active, {{the prickly}} shark rests {{during the day}} in deeper {{offshore}} waters and performs a diel migration to shallower inshore waters at dusk. Individual sharks have a small home range and tend to remain within a given local area. This species consumes a variety of bony and cartilaginous fishes, and cephalopods. Since it moves slowly, it may use suction to capture prey. It is aplacental viviparous, with females producing sizable litters. The prickly shark is not known to be dangerous to humans and has minimal economic value. It is caught incidentally by commercial deepwater fisheries, which <b>are</b> <b>expanding</b> and may potentially threaten its population. Thus, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has assessed this species as Near Threatened.|$|E
5|$|Outside of India, golden jackals in the Caucasus and Turkey {{indicate}} the next highest genetic diversity, while those in Europe indicate low genetic diversity, which confirms their more recent expansion into Europe. Genetic data {{indicates that the}} golden jackals of the Peloponnese Peninsula in Greece and the Dalmatian coast in Croatia may represent two ancient populations that have survived into modern times. Golden jackals in the Balkans originated from those expanding from southeast Europe and from the Caucasus. Golden jackals from both the Balkans and the Caucasus <b>are</b> <b>expanding</b> into the Baltic. In the Middle East, golden jackals from Israel have a higher genetic diversity than European jackals. This {{is thought to be}} due to Israeli jackals having hybridized with dogs, gray wolves, and African golden wolves, creating a hybrid zone in Israel.|$|E
5|$|Since then, {{the hospice}} {{industry}} has rapidly expanded. This growth has accompanied the AIDS epidemic and {{the aging of}} the population, with related illnesses. By 1995, hospices were a $2.8 billion industry, with $1.9 billion from Medicare alone funding patients in 1,857 hospice programs with Medicare certification. In that year, 72% of hospice providers were non-profit. By 1998, there were 3,200 hospices either in operation or under development throughout the United States and Puerto Rico, according to the National Hospice and Palliative Care Organization (NHPCO). According to 2007's Last Rights: Rescuing the End of Life from the Medical System, hospice sites <b>are</b> <b>expanding</b> at a national rate of about 3.5% per year. In 2007, 1.4 million people in the United States used hospice, with more than one-third of dying Americans using the service, approximately 39%. In 2008, Medicare alone, which pays for 80% of hospice treatment, paid $10 billion to the 4,000 Medicare-certified providers in the United States.|$|E

25|$|Before European colonization, {{burrowing}} owls probably inhabited every suitable {{area of the}} New World, but in North America, {{they have}} experienced some restrictions in distribution since.

25|$|The central {{stars of}} {{planetary}} nebulae are very hot. Only when a star has exhausted {{most of its}} nuclear fuel can it collapse to such a small size.

25|$|The central {{stars of}} {{planetary}} nebulae are very hot. Their luminosity, though, is very low, implying {{that they must}} be very small.

Spectroscopic observations show that all planetary nebulae <b>are</b> <b>expanding,</b> and so the idea arose that planetary nebulae were caused by a star's outer layers being thrown into space {{at the end of its}} life.|$|E
