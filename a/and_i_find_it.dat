I think {{there are too many}} songwriters writing sad, depressive songs, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>find</b> <b>it</b> really boring, listening to music where people are just complaining. People should stop whining! I find it much more challenging to make songs that are pop songs, to make happy songs, and that's why I like to do it. I really like to make quite hopeful, happy music {{with a little bit of}} melancholy in it, with a little spice of melancholy." ...|$|E
500|$|In January, Davis wrote home, expressing {{frustration}} at the slow logistics of replacement aircraft parts, claiming this was slowing down missions. He {{also began to}} express contempt for the F-86, feeling at times it was being outperformed by the MiG and that [...] "something {{will have to be}} done" [...] to give the UN pilots more of an advantage in combat. He also said that he had begun to grow tired of the constant publicity about him. [...] "They're trying to make a hero of me <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>find</b> <b>it</b> rather embarrassing", he wrote in a letter. At other times, Davis indicated he preferred to stay in combat.|$|E
500|$|The Oregon Law Review {{described}} Bare-faced Messiah as [...] "a revealing, enthralling {{biography of}} a controversial public figure." [...] Charles Platt, writing in the Washington Post, called the book [...] "impressively thorough" [...] though he chided Miller for [...] "miss no opportunity to poke fun at Hubbard. Indeed, he belittles the man so thoroughly, the exercise almost begins to seem pointless." [...] He noted that {{in advance of the}} publication of his review, the Church of Scientology had sent his newspaper [...] "a large package of documents intending to refute many of Miller's statements." [...] His review was subsequently disputed by the Church of Scientology International's Vice President, Brian Anderson, who denounced the book {{in a letter to the}} newspaper, claiming that it had been [...] "obviously calculated to make a quick buck capitalizing on L. Ron Hubbard's name" [...] and was a [...] "fast and shoddy" [...] work. In response, Platt pointed out that [...] " [...] does not dispute the success of L. Ron Hubbard's work; he merely presents evidence that suggests fraud. This is the point of Russell Miller's book, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>find</b> <b>it</b> significant that Brian Anderson makes no attempt to answer it." ...|$|E

500|$|I'm {{influenced}} by everything. By books, by the weather, by the water, by my shoes, if they're comfortable or not. Everything. One {{of it is}} music, but I {{think it is very}} important with people who are dealing with making music that they are not only {{influenced by}} music. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>find</b> <b>it</b> very sad when you find a record, and it says on : [...] "this record was inspired by Miles Davis." [...] Because it's like making...a film, you don't make a film about a film, you make a film about real life. And you wouldn't sit down and write a book about a book, it's like recycling, it misses the point. And music isn't brilliant unless it goes beyond the point of being music and becomes real life. So I'm influenced by real life. And when people listen to my music and say [...] "Oh, I can see great influence from this artist in there", I read that and I say [...] "Okay, I didn't succeed". But if people listen to my music and say [...] "Oh, this made me feel like this and that [...] ", that's right. It should be beyond style, beyond influence, it should be about pure emotion, and real life.|$|E
500|$|Malouma began singing as a child, first {{performed}} on the stage when she was twelve and began appearing in solo concerts with a traditional repertoire by age fifteen. In addition to her father's guidance, she was inspired by other traditional artists including Oum Kalthoum, Abdel Halim Hafez, Fairouz, Dimi and Sabah. As she matured, she increasingly became interested in blues music, which appealed to her as it bore a resemblance to the traditional music she knew. Malouma wrote her first song, [...] "Habibi Habeytou" [...] (My beloved, I loved him) when she was sixteen. It was a song protesting the tradition of men turning their wives {{out of their homes}} to marry younger women. It brought her instant recognition, but created a backlash, causing physical attacks from the established Muslim community. Soon after she wrote it, her family moved to Nouakchott, the capital, to help her launch her music career, but in the strongly traditional society, Malouma was forced to marry, abandoning singing until the late 1980s. She was later accused by her father of ruining his reputation. In addition to the criticisms stemming from her songs, she had disgraced her family by divorcing twice: her first husband had been forced upon her, while the second came from a noble family, who would not allow her to sing. Yet after hearing one of her songs, her father commented: [...] "You have created something new <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>find</b> <b>it</b> touching. Unfortunately, I will not live long {{enough to be able to}} protect you." ...|$|E
2500|$|Throughout Pearl Jam's career, Vedder has {{interacted with}} the crowd during the band's concerts. Early in Pearl Jam's existence, Vedder and the band became known for their intense live performances. Vedder participated in stage diving as well as crowd surfing. During {{the early part of}} Pearl Jam's career, Vedder was known to climb the stage {{lighting}} rig and hang from the stage roof. Looking back at this time, Vedder said, [...] "It's hard for us to watch early performances, even though that's when people think we were on fire and young. Playing music for as long as I had been playing music and then getting a shot at making a record and at having an audience and stuff, it's just like an untamed force...a different kind of energy. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>find</b> <b>it</b> kind of hard to watch those early performances because it's so just fucking, semi-testosterone-fueled or whatever. But it didn't come from jock mentality. It came from just being let out of the gates." ...|$|E
