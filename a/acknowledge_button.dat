50|$|Digital {{systems may}} {{communicate}} text messages from computer-aided dispatch (CAD). For example, a display in a tow truck may give a textual location for {{a call and}} any related details. The tow truck driver may press an <b>acknowledge</b> <b>button,</b> sending data {{in the opposite direction}} and flagging the call as received by the driver. They can be used for analog telemetry systems, such as the livestock tank levels, as described above. Another possibility is the lubricating oil pressure in a transit bus engine, or the current speed of the bus. Analog conditions are translated into data words. Some systems send radio paging messages which can either 1) beep a paging receiver, 2) send a numeric message, or 3) send a text message.|$|E
5000|$|Also {{known as}} [...] "Fault" [...] or [...] "Defect". When held steady or flashing, {{it means that}} a trouble {{condition}} exists on the panel. Trouble conditions are often activated by a contaminated smoke detector or an electrical problem within the system. Trouble conditions are also activated by a zone being disabled (disconnected from the system), a circuit being disabled, low power on the backup battery, the disabling of a notification appliance, the ground faults, or short or open circuits. Usually the alarm panel's sounder will activate if a trouble condition exists, though older systems would sometimes activate a bell or other audible signal connected to the panel. In a trouble condition, the panel displays the zone or devices causing the condition. Usually, the [...] "Trouble" [...] indicator goes out automatically when the situation causing the trouble condition is rectified, however in some systems the panel must be reset to clear the trouble alarm. Some panels have more specific indicators such as 'Trouble-PSU' which shows when the panel itself is compromised and 'Trouble-Bell' ('Sounder Fault' on UK panels) which shows that the notification appliances are not functioning correctly. On most panels, an <b>acknowledge</b> <b>button</b> is pressed {{to turn off the}} panel's sounder.|$|E
50|$|On Jeans Day, {{people across}} British Columbia, Canada, wear their jeans and their lapel pin or <b>button</b> <b>acknowledging</b> {{their support of}} BC Children's Hospital. Jeans Day {{typically}} falls on the last Thursday in April.|$|R
5000|$|All CityRail trains {{now have}} an {{additional}} safety feature, which has been fitted since the accident. In addition to the deadman handle and foot pedal, the trains are fitted with [...] "task linked vigilance" [...] - which resets a timer every time the driver activates certain controls. If there is no change in control, a flashing lamp and then buzzer sound and the driver is required to <b>acknowledge</b> a vigilance <b>button.</b> If the train's driver does not use the controls and does not acknowledge the vigilance alarm, the vigilance system is activated and makes an emergency brake application. All trains have also been fitted with data loggers to record the driver's and guard's actions as they work the train, {{as well as the}} train's speed. Such a system had been fitted to G7, but was in the early stage of fleet roll-out, and hence had not been commissioned and switched on {{at the time of the}} accident.|$|R
