30|$|The JS and ECS are {{marginal}} seas {{located along}} the eastern margin of the Eurasian continent (Fig.  1). The JS is connected with the North Pacific Ocean, Okhotsk Sea, and East China Sea. Although the maximum water depth in the JS is 3700  m, the straits connecting to <b>adjacent</b> <b>seas</b> are shallow (<[*] 130  m), meaning that intermediate and deep waters in the JS are separated from the <b>adjacent</b> <b>seas.</b> The only surface water flowing into the JS is the Tsushima Warm Current (TWC) flowing from the ECS through the Tsushima Strait. Since the TWC originates from the Kuroshio Current in the subtropical North Pacific Ocean and mixes with nutrient-rich coastal water derived from the Yangtze River in the ECS, this surface current supplies heat, salt, and nutrients to the JS.|$|R

On 9January 1940 {{he was appointed}} acting Chief of the Air Staff (CAS), following {{the resignation of the}} incumbent, Air Vice-Marshal Goble. Anderson remained in the position until 10February, when Air Chief Marshal Sir Charles Burnett, seconded from the Royal Air Force, arrived to take over. The Australian government at this stage had so little faith in the leadership of its Air Force that it had briefly considered offering temporary command of the service to a Royal Australian Navy officer, Second Naval Member Commodore Maitland Boucher, before deciding against such a [...] "monumental slight to the senior ranks of the RAAF" [...] and settling on Anderson. After relinquishing his temporary position as CAS, Anderson briefly reverted to his previous role as Air Member for Supply before taking over as Air Member for Personnel (AMP) in March 1940; he was succeeded in November by Air Vice-Marshal Henry Wrigley. The next month, Anderson took over from Air Commodore Cole as Air Officer Commanding Central Area, with responsibility for air defence, protection of <b>adjacent</b> <b>sea</b> lanes, and aerial reconnaissance for most of New South Wales; he remained at this post until it was disbanded in August the following year.|$|E

500|$|In January 1940, the Chief of the Air Staff, Air Vice-Marshal Jimmy Goble, {{proposed}} organising the RAAF along functional {{lines with}} Home Defence, Training, and Maintenance Commands, but the Federal {{government did not}} take up this plan. Goble was replaced in February by a Royal Air Force (RAF) officer, Air Chief Marshal Sir Charles Burnett, who focussed on rapid expansion of the RAAF {{to meet the needs}} of the Empire Air Training Scheme and believed that Australia's huge land mass would make a functional command system unwieldy. He proceeded to reorganise the Air Force into a geographically based [...] "area" [...] system. The roles of each area command were the same: air defence, protection of <b>adjacent</b> <b>sea</b> lanes, and aerial reconnaissance. Each area was led by an Air Officer Commanding (AOC) who was responsible for the administration and operations of all bases and units within his boundary. Exceptions to this policy included aircraft depots and the Central Flying School that trained flying instructors, as their range of responsibilities crossed area boundaries and therefore came under the direct control of RAAF Headquarters. The static area system was primarily defensive in nature, but considered well-suited to training new pilots, who could be instructed at flying schools and mentored through their initial squadron postings, all within the same geographical region.|$|E

2500|$|At night, {{the land}} cools off {{faster than the}} ocean due to {{differences}} in their heat capacity, which forces the dying of the daytime sea breeze as the temperature of the land approaches that of the ocean.

If there is sufficient moisture and instability available, the land breeze can cause showers, or even thunderstorms, over the water. Overnight thunderstorm development offshore due to the land breeze can be a good predictor for the activity on land the following day, {{as long as there are}} no expected changes to the weather pattern over the following 12–24 hours.
