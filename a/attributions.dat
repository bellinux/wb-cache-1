5|$|In {{the domain}} of secular music, Josquin left {{numerous}} French chansons, for from three to six voices, {{as well as a}} handful of Italian secular songs known as frottole, as well as some pieces which were probably intended for instrumental performance. Problems of attribution are even more acute with the chansons than they are with other portions of his output: while about 70 three and four-voice chansons were published under his name during his lifetime, only six of the more than thirty five- and six-voice chansons attributed to him were circulated under his name during the same time. Many of the <b>attributions</b> added after his death are considered to be unreliable, and much work has been done in the last decades of the 20th century to correct <b>attributions</b> on stylistic grounds.|$|E

5|$|Thirty poems {{attributed}} to Narihira {{were included in}} the early 10th-century Kokinshū, and many more in later anthologies, but the <b>attributions</b> are dubious. Ki no Tsurayuki mentioned Narihira in his kana preface to the Kokinshū as one of the Six Poetic Geniuses—important poets of an earlier age. He was also included in Fujiwara no Kintō's later Thirty-Six Poetic Geniuses.|$|E
5|$|Most playwrights of {{the period}} {{typically}} collaborated with others at some point, and critics agree that Shakespeare did the same, mostly early and late in his career. Some <b>attributions,</b> such as Titus Andronicus and the early history plays, remain controversial while The Two Noble Kinsmen and the lost Cardenio have well-attested contemporary documentation. Textual evidence also supports the view {{that several of the}} plays were revised by other writers after their original composition.|$|E
5|$|Otto Pächt and Friedrich Winkler {{continued}} and developed on Panofsky's work. They were key in identifying sources of iconography and ascribing attribution, {{or at least}} differentiating anonymous masters under names of convenience. The paucity of surviving documentation has made attribution especially difficult, a problem compounded by the workshop system. It {{was not until the}} late 1950s, after the research of Friedländer, Panofsky and Meyer Schapiro, that the <b>attributions</b> generally accepted today were established.|$|E
25|$|Hostile <b>attribution</b> bias {{has also}} been {{documented}} in adult populations, and adults {{with high levels of}} hostile <b>attribution</b> bias are over 4 times more likely to die by the age of 50 than adults with low levels of hostile <b>attribution</b> bias. Hostile <b>attribution</b> bias is particularly linked to relational problems in adulthood, including marital conflict/violence and marital/relationship dissatisfaction. Finally, parents with high levels of hostile <b>attribution</b> bias are also much more likely to use harsh discipline and aggressive parenting, which may further contribute to the intergenerational continuity in hostile <b>attribution</b> bias and aggression across time.|$|R
40|$|The current article {{addresses}} the psychometric {{qualities of the}} German Version of Gudjonsson's Blame <b>Attribution</b> Inventory (GBAI), a self-report scale for measuring <b>attribution</b> of blame for crime. The GBAI was administered to a criminal sample of forensic and criminal inmates (n = 107). Findings indicate that the German version of the Gudjonsson's Blame <b>Attribution</b> Inventory possesses acceptable test-retest stability and good internal consistency. Factor analysis reproduced the three basic dimensions of the GBAI external <b>attribution,</b> mental-element <b>attribution,</b> and guilt-feeling <b>attribution.</b> Forensic patients had higher mental-element <b>attribution</b> and guilt-feeling <b>attribution</b> scores than the prison inmates. Interestingly, sexual offenders who were prisoners, showed the lowest guilt-feeling <b>attribution,</b> while sexual offenders who were forensic patients had the highest guilt-feeling <b>attribution</b> scores. Since earlier research reported a tendency of faking good in sexual offenders, we suggest that the forensic sexual offenders may demonstrate a social desirable response tendency {{in an attempt to}} gain sympathy and/or earlier parole. All in all, our data show that the German version of the GBAI is a valuable tool for measuring attributional styles of offender...|$|R

5|$|The healing <b>attributions</b> of Eshmun were {{combined}} with his divine consort Astarte's fertilizing powers; the latter had an annex chapel with a sacred paved pool within the Eshmun sanctuary. Pilgrims {{from all over}} the ancient world flocked to the Eshmun Temple leaving votive traces of their devotion and proof of their cure. There is evidence that from the 3rd century BC onwards there have been attempts to Hellenize the cult of Eshmun and to associate him with his Greek counterpart Asclepius, but the sanctuary retained its curative function.|$|E
5|$|Connoisseurship in {{the late}} Ming period {{centered}} on these items of refined artistic taste, which provided work for art dealers and even underground scammers who themselves made imitations and false <b>attributions.</b> The Jesuit Matteo Ricci while staying in Nanjing wrote that Chinese scam artists were ingenious at making forgeries and huge profits. However, there were guides to help the wary new connoisseur; Liu Tong (died 1637) wrote a book printed in 1635 that told his readers how to spot fake and authentic pieces of art. He revealed that a Xuande era (1426–1435) bronzework could be authenticated by judging its sheen; porcelain wares from the Yongle era (1402–1424) could be judged authentic by their thickness.|$|E
5|$|More recent {{research}} from art historians such as Lorne Campbell relies on X-ray and infrared photography {{to develop an}} understanding of the techniques and materials used by the painters. The conservation of the Ghent Altarpiece in the mid-1950s pioneered methodologies and scholarship in technical studies. Examination of paint layers and underlayers was later applied to other Netherlandish works, allowing for more accurate <b>attributions.</b> Van Eyck's work, for example, typically shows underdrawings unlike Christus' work. These discoveries, too, hint at the relationships between the masters of the first rank and those in the following generations, with Memling's underdrawings clearly showing van der Weyden's influence.|$|E
50|$|Bernard Weiner {{proposed}} {{a detailed account}} of the attributional approach to learned helplessness. His <b>attribution</b> theory includes the dimensions of globality/specificity, stability/instability, and internality/externality. A global <b>attribution</b> occurs when the individual believes that the cause of negative events is consistent across different contexts. A specific <b>attribution</b> occurs when the individual believes that the cause of a negative event is unique to a particular situation. A stable <b>attribution</b> occurs when the individual believes the cause to be consistent across time. Unstable <b>attribution</b> occurs when the individual thinks that the cause is specific to one point in time. An external <b>attribution</b> assigns causality to situational or external factors, while an internal <b>attribution</b> assigns causality to factors within the person.|$|R

40|$|Abstract—The {{notion of}} <b>attribution</b> is usually tied to identity: {{the ability to}} {{associate}} the originator of something with that data. This notion is both a simplification of the myriad aspects of <b>attribution,</b> and a masking of {{many different types of}} <b>attribution</b> under the rubric of “identity. ” Current efforts at <b>attribution</b> of data in the network focus either on traceback of packets or signing data at various network layers, and management of the keys involved. As the Internet evolves into the next generation network, and people implement testbeds to facilitate that evolution, they can design support mechanisms for other forms of <b>attribution.</b> What types of <b>attribution</b> should those mechanisms support? This paper presents requirements for <b>attribution</b> that will be useful both in the next generation infrastructure and in the data it manages. I...|$|R
5|$|The Bruges {{exhibition}} {{renewed interest}} in the period and initiated scholarship that was to flourish in the 20th century. Johan Huizinga was the first historian to place Netherlandish art squarely in the Burgundian period – outside of nationalistic borders – suggesting in his book The Waning of the Middle Ages, published in 1919, that the flowering of the school in the early 15th century resulted wholly from the tastes set by the Burgundian court. Another exhibition visitor, Georges Hulin de Loo, published an independent critical catalogue highlighting {{the large number of}} mistakes in the official catalogue, which had used <b>attributions</b> and descriptions from the owners. He and Max Friedländer, who visited and wrote a review of the Bruges exhibition, went on to become leading scholars in the field.|$|E
5|$|The first {{generations of}} artists were active {{during the height}} of Burgundian {{influence}} in Europe, when the Low Countries became the political and economic centre of Northern Europe, noted for its crafts and luxury goods. Assisted by the workshop system, panels and a variety of crafts were sold to foreign princes or merchants through private engagement or market stalls. A majority were destroyed during waves of iconoclasm in the 16th and 17th centuries; today only a few thousand examples survive. Early northern art in general was not well regarded from the early 17th to the mid-19th century, and the painters and their works were not well documented until the mid-19th century. Art historians spent almost another century determining <b>attributions,</b> studying iconography, and establishing bare outlines of even the major artists' lives. Attribution {{of some of the most}} significant works is still debated.|$|E
5|$|There {{have been}} {{significant}} challenges for art historians {{in establishing the}} names of Netherlandish masters and attributing specific works. The historical record is very poor, such that some major artists' biographies are still bare outlines, while attribution is an ongoing and often contentious debate. Even the most widely accepted <b>attributions</b> are typically only {{as a result of}} decades of scientific and historical research originating from after the start of the 20th century. Some painters, such as Adriaen Isenbrandt and Ambrosius Benson of Bruges, who were mass-producing panels to be sold at fair stalls, have had as many as 500 painting attributed to them.|$|E

5|$|While still {{involved}} in the disputes over Legislative Council <b>attributions,</b> Filitti was a member, and later President, of the state's Heraldry and Genealogy Commission. The appointment again brought him into disagreement with the Romanian monarch, this time involving the heraldic symbols of Greater Romania. Filitti and Kirileanu suggested redesigned coats of arms of the Romanian counties, each bearing the Steel Crown, as a show of national unity; Ferdinand disagreed, and the counties were only allowed their simple escutcheons. He was turning {{his attention to the}} Slătineanu branch of his family, and completed a biographical study on Ion Slătineanu, governor of Brăila in the 1830s (hosted by the magazine Analele Brăilei, 1/1929).|$|E
5|$|During the 16th century, Josquin {{gradually}} {{acquired the}} {{reputation as the}} greatest composer of the age, his mastery of technique and expression universally imitated and admired. Writers as diverse as Baldassare Castiglione and Martin Luther wrote about his reputation and fame; theorists such as Heinrich Glarean and Gioseffo Zarlino held his style as that best representing perfection. He was so admired that many anonymous compositions were attributed to him by copyists, probably to increase their sales. More than 370 works are attributed to him; {{it was only after}} the advent of modern analytical scholarship that some of these <b>attributions</b> were challenged, and revealed as mistaken, on the basis of stylistic features and manuscript evidence. Yet in spite of Josquin's colossal reputation, which endured until the beginning of the Baroque era and was revived in the 20th century, his biography is shadowy, and virtually nothing is known about his personality. The only surviving work which may be in his own hand is a graffito {{on the wall of the}} Sistine Chapel, and only one contemporary mention of his character is known, in a letter to Duke Ercole I of Ferrara. The lives of dozens of less revered Renaissance composers are better documented than that of Josquin.|$|E
25|$|Numerous biases in the {{attribution}} process have been discovered. For instance, the fundamental attribution error is {{the tendency to}} make dispositional <b>attributions</b> for behavior, overestimating the influence of personality and underestimating the influence of situations. The actor-observer difference is a refinement of this bias, the tendency to make dispositional <b>attributions</b> for other people's behavior and situational <b>attributions</b> for our own. The self-serving bias is the tendency to attribute dispositional causes for successes, and situational causes for failure, particularly when self-esteem is threatened. This leads to assuming one's successes are from innate traits, and one's failures are due to situations, including other people. Other ways people protect their self-esteem are by believing in a just world, blaming victims for their suffering, and making defensive <b>attributions,</b> which explain our behavior in ways which defend us from feelings of vulnerability and mortality. Researchers have found that mildly depressed individuals often lack this bias and actually have more realistic perceptions of reality (as measured by the opinions of others).|$|E

40|$|Impaired {{mental state}} <b>attribution</b> is a core social {{cognitive}} deficit in schizophrenia. With functional {{magnetic resonance imaging}} (fMRI), this study examined {{the extent to which the}} core neural system of mental state <b>attribution</b> is involved in mental state <b>attribution,</b> focusing on belief <b>attribution</b> and emotion <b>attribution.</b> Fifteen schizophrenia outpatients and 14 healthy controls performed two mental state <b>attribution</b> tasks in the scanner. In a Belief <b>Attribution</b> Task, after reading a short vignette, participants were asked infer either the belief of a character (a false belief condition) or a physical state of an affair (a false photograph condition). In an Emotion <b>Attribution</b> Task, participants were asked either to judge whether character(s) in pictures felt unpleasant, pleasant, or neutral emotion (other condition) or to look at pictures that did not have any human characters (view condition). fMRI data were analyzing focusing on a priori regions of interest (ROIs) of the core neural systems of mental state attribution: the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), temporoparietal junction (TPJ) and precuneus. An exploratory whole brain analysis was also performed. Both patients and controls showed greater activation in all four ROIs during the Belief <b>Attribution</b> Task than the Emotion <b>Attribution</b> Task. Patients also showed less activation in the precuneus and left TPJ compared to controls during the Belief <b>Attribution</b> Task. No significant group difference was found during the Emotion <b>Attribution</b> Task in any of ROIs. An exploratory whole brain analysis showed a similar pattern of neural activations. These findings suggest that while schizophrenia patients rely on the same neural network as controls do when attributing beliefs of others, patients did not show reduced activation in the key regions such as the TPJ. Further, this study did not find evidence for aberrant neural activation during emotion <b>attribution</b> or recruitment of compensatory brain regions in schizophrenia...|$|R
