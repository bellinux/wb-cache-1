50|$|<b>Azadirachtin,</b> <b>a</b> {{chemical}} compound {{belonging to the}} limonoid group, is a secondary metabolite present in neem seeds.

40|$|The {{effects of}} <b>azadirachtin</b> <b>A,</b> a tetranortriterpenoid from the neem tree Azadirachta indica J., on both {{development}} and interaction between Trypanosoma cruzi, the causative agent of Chagas' disease, and its vector Rhodnius prolixus were studied. Given through a blood meal, a dose-rsponse relationship of azadirachtin was established using antifeedant effect and ecdysis inhibition as effective parameters. A singlo dose of <b>azadirachtin</b> <b>A</b> {{was able to}} block the onset of mitosis in the epidermis and ecdysteroid titers in the hemnolymph, determined by radioimmuneassay, were too low for an induction of ecadysis. The survival of T. cruzi was also studied in R. prolixus treated with the drug. If the trypomastigotes were fed in presence of <b>azadirachtin</b> <b>A</b> the number of parasites drastically decreased. If the drug was applied after infection of the bug with T. cruzi, the parasite was still abolished from the gut. If the insect was pretreated with <b>azadirachtin</b> <b>A</b> before infection the same observation was obtained. A single dose of <b>azadirachtin</b> <b>A</b> was enough for a permanent resistance of the insect host against its reinfection with T. cruzi and for blocking the ecdysis for a long time. The effects of <b>azadirachtin</b> <b>A</b> on the hormonal balance of the host and growth inhibition of the parasite will be discussed {{on the basis of}} the present results...|$|E

40|$|<b>Azadirachtin</b> <b>A</b> {{was given}} through a blood meal to 4 th-instar larvae and to adult females of Rhodnius prolixus.

Long-term experiments with subsequent four feedings on azadirachtin-free blood were performed with 4 th-instar larvae and with adult females. Only in the low-dose azadirachtin larval groups (0. 01 and 0. 1 microng/ml of blood), development was partially restored; after a single 1. 0 microng/ml treatment about 50 % of the treated larvae {{were still alive}} 120 days later without any adult emergence.

40|$|Azadirachta indica, {{known as}} neem tree and {{traditionally}} called “nature's drug store” makes part of several African pharmacopeias and {{is widely used}} for the preparation of homemade remedies and commercial preparations against various illnesses, including malaria. Employing a bio-guided fractionation approach, molecules obtained from A. indica ripe and green fruit kernels were tested for activity against early sporogonic stages of Plasmodium berghei, the parasite stages that develop in the mosquito mid gut after an infective blood meal. The limonoid deacetylnimbin (3) was identified as one the most active compounds of the extract, with a considerably higher activity {{compared to that of}} the close analogue nimbin (2). Pure deacetylnimbin (3) appeared to interfere with transmissible Plasmodium stages at a similar potency as <b>azadirachtin</b> <b>A.</b> Considering its higher thermal and chemical stability, deacetylnimbin could represent a suitable alternative to <b>azadirachtin</b> <b>A</b> for the preparation of transmission blocking antimalarials...|$|E
40|$|Biopesticides {{are a good}} {{alternative}} to the synthetic pesticide. Both leaves and fruit of neem plant {{are known to have}} bitter taste having fungicidal, insecticidal and nematicidal properties. <b>Azadirachtin,</b> chemically <b>a</b> tetranorterpenoid component of neem acts on the mitotic cells and blocks the microtubule polymerization. Certain activities of genes and proteins are also altered by <b>azadirachtin.</b> <b>As</b> <b>a</b> botanical insecticide <b>azadirachtin</b> is effective against many biological processes. It may cause a reduction in feeding habit, suspend the molting process, larvae and pupae death and also cause sterility in the emerging adults, this all depend on the given dose. Apart from azadirachtin, many other components of neem also have insecticidal properties. Among them are saponins that are found to have antimicrobial activity that inhibits moulds and protecting plant from attack of insects. Likewise Nim 80 and Neemas are also neem products that produce the insecticidal activity. In addition Parker oil TM is also effective insecticide which is a commercial product. There is a maximum weight loss when azadirachtin and NPV are used in combination.

50|$|Mites infesting {{their hosts}} at the outer {{surface of the}} skin are removed by {{treatment}} with topically applied acaricides (chemicals to kill mites and ticks applied to the skin). Numerous commercial formulations are available, representing several different chemical groups. Examples are: synthetic pyrethroids such as flumethrin; formamidines such as amitraz; and phenylpyrazoles such as fipronil. Botanical acaricides are represented by <b>azadirachtin,</b> <b>an</b> extract of the neem tree. Aqueous suspensions of fungi naturally pathogenic to mites, such as Metarhizium anisopliae, are another potential alternative to chemical acaricides. Good potential for vaccination of sheep to control Psoroptes ovis infestation has been demonstrated.|$|R
40|$|The role of <b>azadirachtin,</b> <b>an</b> active {{component}} of a medicinal plant Neem (Azadirachta indica), on TNF-induced cell signaling in human cell lines was investigated. Azadirachtin blocks TNF-induced activation of nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) and also expression of NF-κB-dependent genes such as adhesion molecules and cyclooxygenase 2. Azadirachtin inhibits the inhibitory subunit of NF-κB (IκBα) phosphorylation and thereby its degradation and RelA (p 65) nuclear translocation. It blocks IκBα kinase (IKK) activity ex vivo, but not in vitro. Surprisingly, azadirachtin blocks NF-κB DNA binding activity in transfected cells with TNF receptor-associated factor (TRAF) 2, TNF receptor-associated death domain (TRADD), IKK, or p 65, but not with TNFR, suggesting its effect is at the TNFR level. Azadirachtin blocks binding of TNF, but not IL- 1, IL- 4, IL- 8, or TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) with its respective receptors. Anti-TNFR antibody or TNF protects azadirachtin-mediated down-regulation of TNFRs. Further, in silico data suggest that azadirachtin strongly binds in the TNF binding site of TNFR. Overall, our data suggest that azadirachtin modulates cell surface TNFRs thereby decreasing TNF-induced biological responses. Thus, <b>azadirachtin</b> exerts <b>an</b> anti-inflammatory response by a novel pathway, which may be beneficial for anti-inflammatory therapy...|$|R

40|$|Coelaenomenodera lameensis is {{the major}} pest of oil palm. The fight against this pest is {{achieved}} by using several methods including the injection of systemic insecticide {{in the trunk of}} the palm. The tests were conducted at the agro-industrial units of Toumanguié, located 90 km from Abidjan. <b>Azadirachtin</b> <b>A</b> was used in systemic treatment at four concentrations: 0. 1, 0. 2, 0. 4 and 0. 6 g/ml. Chiffon sleeves were placed on the palms to assess the effect of products on C. lameensis. Systemic injections were made during the dry and rainy seasons. The efficacy of azadirachtin was assessed by reference to thiamethoxam, an insecticide used in the fight against this pest. The effective minimal concentration was 0. 4 g/ml of azadirachtin. This concentration generated the cumulated mortality rates of 38. 92 % in dry season and 19. 28 % in rainy season on the adults after 28 days of treatment.

40|$|In {{the course}} of their {{coevolution}} with insects, plants have learnt to protect themselves by chemical means. Semiochemical act as antifeedants or deterrents, others by disrupting growth and development. By use of the Epilachna varivestis bioassay we isolated from Azadirachta indica seed a group of triterpenoids which interfee with larval growth and development in ppm range. Main components are the <b>azadirachtins</b> <b>A</b> and B with identical biological activity. Various other azadirachtins were obtained, either as minor seed components or by chemical modification of the naturally occuring compounds. Structure vs. activity relation studies enabled us to postulate a basic structural element that should still be biologically active and with much simpler chemical structure than natural compounds. What underlies the biological activity of these insect growth inhibitors? Their interference with the hormonal regulation of development and reproduction has been studied in Locusta migratoria and Rhodnius prolixus. In addition, tritiated dihydroazadirachtin A was used. With this approach, a precise correlation between administered dose, resulting effects, and retention of the compound was established.
