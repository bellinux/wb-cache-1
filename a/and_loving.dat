5|$|A {{number of}} saints and {{historical}} figures have followed and presented specific approaches to Christian meditation. Both Eastern and Western Christian teachings {{have emphasized the}} use of meditation as an element in increasing one's knowledge of Christ. The Spiritual Exercises of Ignatius of Loyola use meditative mental imagery, {{with the goal of}} knowing Christ more intimately <b>and</b> <b>loving</b> him more ardently. In The Way of Perfection, St. Theresa of Avila taught her nuns how to try to get to know Christ by using meditation and mental prayer. Hesychastic prayer and meditation continues {{to be used in the}} Eastern Orthodox tradition as a spiritual practice that facilitates the knowing of Christ.|$|E

40|$|This {{thesis is}} a study of John Loving's search for God <b>and</b> <b>love</b> in Eugene O'Neill's play, Days Without End. Through John's efforts to search for God <b>and</b> <b>love,</b> <b>and</b> his {{multiple}} personality, the writer {{is trying to find}} out his need of God <b>and</b> <b>love.</b> The writer is curious about the way he searches God <b>and</b> <b>love,</b> <b>and</b> how he finds Him <b>and</b> his <b>love.</b> The writer is also interested in John's attitude towards God <b>and</b> <b>love</b> after he has multiple personality. From the analysis, it can be seen clearly that he fails to get a lasting faith since he is not capable of getting the truth outside the Truth' of God's love. He also tries to express his <b>love</b> <b>and</b> his need of Father Baird's love through all his letters to him, <b>and</b> get Elsa's <b>love</b> <b>and</b> restore her faith in <b>love</b> <b>and</b> marriage through his idea of the ideal marriage. Meanwhile, as his split off personality, Loving, born from John's disappointment, anger and hatred of the loss of God of <b>Love</b> <b>and</b> <b>love,</b> does anything to kill John's faith in Him <b>and</b> His <b>love,</b> <b>and</b> destroy John's <b>love</b> <b>and</b> ones whom he loves. After his realization, he fights against Loving's evil and hateful spirit in order to find Him <b>and</b> <b>love</b> again. Therefore, through his efforts to find Him <b>and</b> <b>love,</b> John's need of God <b>and</b> <b>love</b> is vividly revealed...|$|R
5|$|Charlie Bucket (Freddie Highmore) {{is a kind}} <b>and</b> <b>loving</b> boy {{living in}} poverty with his parents (Noah Taylor and Helena Bonham Carter) and four {{bedridden}} grandparents. They all rely on his father for income, employed at a toothpaste factory, responsible for putting the caps on the tubes. However, Mr. Bucket eventually loses his job because the factory replaced him with a machine that puts the caps on the tubes. Down the street is Willy Wonka's (Johnny Depp) chocolate factory, which reopened after industrial espionage forced him into seclusion and sacking his employees. Charlie's Grandpa Joe (David Kelly) worked for Wonka before the termination.|$|E
5|$|ML Pin {{recalled}} {{in his autobiography}} that although {{his mother was a}} kind <b>and</b> <b>loving</b> figure, his father was rather strict and acted more like a teacher than a father, and that he was often fearful of him. A loyal servant of the crown, MR Pia introduced ML Pin to King Vajiravudh when he was seven years old. Another often-recounted story from his childhood is that of how, before having learned to count, when his mother asked him to gather half a bunch of betel leaves for her, ML Pin set down to picking up one leaf with each hand at a time, separating them equally into two piles.|$|E

5|$|The {{purpose of}} {{marriage}} in the Bahá'i faith is mainly to foster spiritual harmony, fellowship and unity {{between a man and}} a woman and to provide a stable <b>and</b> <b>loving</b> environment for the rearing of children. The Bahá'í teachings on marriage call it a fortress for well-being and salvation and place marriage and the family as the foundation of the structure of human society. Bahá'u'lláh highly praised marriage, discouraged divorce, and required chastity outside of marriage; Bahá'u'lláh taught that a husband and wife should strive to improve the spiritual life of each other. Interracial marriage is also highly praised throughout Bahá'í scripture.|$|E
5|$|However, once {{he learned}} that a betrothal had finally been arranged, the Emperor ended his {{relationship}} to Domitila. She returned to her native province of São Paulo on 27 August, where she remained. Days earlier, on 2 August, the Emperor had been married by proxy to Amélie of Leuchtenberg. He was stunned by her beauty after meeting her in person. The vows previously made by proxy were ratified in a Nuptial Mass on 17 October. Amélie was kind <b>and</b> <b>loving</b> to his children and provided a much needed sense of normality to both his family and the general public. After Domitila's banishment from court, the vow the Emperor made to alter his behavior proved to be sincere. He had no more affairs and remained faithful to his spouse. In an attempt to mitigate and move beyond other past misdeeds, he made peace with José Bonifácio, his former minister and mentor.|$|E
5|$|In 1673, the Duke of York's {{conversion}} to Catholicism became public, and {{he married a}} Catholic princess, Mary of Modena, who was only {{six and a half}} years older than Anne. Charles II had no legitimate children, and so the Duke of York was next in the line of succession, followed by his two surviving daughters from his first marriage, Mary and Anne—as long as he had no son. Over the next ten years, the new Duchess of York had ten children, but all were either stillborn or died in infancy, leaving Mary and Anne second and third in the line of succession after their father. There is every indication that, throughout Anne's early life, she and her stepmother got on well together, and the Duke of York was a conscientious <b>and</b> <b>loving</b> father.|$|E

5|$|In {{the town}} of Glenview, Ohio, Evan Trautwig (Ben Stiller) is an active {{participant}} in the community and senior manager of the local Costco store. His life is disrupted when the store's night security guard is murdered. The local police have no leads and show no interest in investigating further. Determined to find the killer and bring him to justice, Evan decides to form a neighborhood watch. However, he only manages to recruit Bob (Vince Vaughn), a construction worker <b>and</b> <b>loving</b> father; Franklin (Jonah Hill), a high school dropout who dreams of being a police officer but failed the written, physical, and mental health tests; and Jamarcus (Richard Ayoade), a recent divorcé.|$|E
5|$|Now {{a prince}} (pangeran), Amir {{was given the}} title Tengku Pangeran Indra Putera. He lived with Kamiliah in their own home. By all accounts, she was a devout <b>and</b> <b>loving</b> wife, and in 1939 the couple had their only child, a {{daughter}} named Tengku Tahura. According to Dini, Amir professed to Kamiliah that he could never love her as he had Sundari and that he felt obligated to marry her, something which Kamiliah reportedly accepted. The poet retained an album with his Javanese sweetheart's photographs at home and would often isolate himself from his family, lost in thought. As a prince of Langkat, Amir became a court official, handling administrative and legal matters, and at times judging criminal cases. He once represented the sultanate at the funeral of PakubuwonoX in Java– Amir's last trip to the island.|$|E
5|$|In {{that same}} year, Edmund Grey, {{the son of}} a Marick family maid and gardener, returns to town to see his {{childhood}} friend, Angelique. Dimitri is furious to see Edmund again since he had stolen money from Dimitri's father to pay for his education. Dimitri is stunned when Edmund informs him that they are half-brothers. Edmund had discovered this when he found a will of Hugo Marick that states he is not only his illegitimate son, but that he is the lawful heir to Wildwind. Helga had planted the will because she believed Dimitri was going to leave Angelique for Erica. When Dimitri assures Helga he will stay with Angelique, she destroys the will {{in order to keep the}} estate for her daughter. Edmund accuses Dimitri of stealing the will and files a lawsuit to have Hugo's body exhumed in order to perform a DNA test. Dimitri believes Edmund is lying about everything and is infuriated by the lawsuit. The hatred between the two deepens even more. Eventually, the truth about what Helga did is revealed and she dies. Dimitri and Edmund agree to put the past behind them and they bond as brothers. They develop an extremely close <b>and</b> <b>loving</b> relationship, but they also continue to have a standing rivalry.|$|E

5|$|On Election Day, Perot {{finished}} {{in third place}} behind Clinton (the winner) and Bush. Perot received 19,743,821 votes, which accounted for 18.91% of the popular vote. He failed to win any states in the Electoral College because of the relatively even distribution of his support, but did win over 30% {{of the vote in}} Maine and 27% in Utah, finishing second in both states. Perot was the first third party candidate since George Wallace in 1968 to finish first in a county, winning counties in Alaska (divided into boroughs), California, Nevada, Colorado, Kansas, Texas and Maine. He won his largest percentage in Matanuska-Susitna Borough, Alaska <b>and</b> <b>Loving</b> County, Texas with over 40%. According to exit polls, 52% of Perot's supporters were male, 94% were white, 63% were aged between 18 and 44, and about 2/3 had not received a college degree. The income of supporters mirrored the general public. In terms of ideology, 53% identified as moderates, 27% were conservative and 20% were liberal, while two-thirds were either members of the Democratic Party or were politically independent.|$|E
