50|$|Housing {{segregation}} {{affects the}} development <b>of</b> concentrated <b>areas</b> <b>of</b> <b>poverty,</b> especially among racial minorities groups. Housing segregation interacts with existing poverty rates among minority groups, especially African Americans and Hispanics, {{to perpetuate the}} cycle of poor people moving into concentrated <b>areas</b> <b>of</b> <b>poverty.</b> These concentrated <b>areas</b> <b>of</b> <b>poverty</b> often experience a lack of public services and infrastructure. Studies have shown that these residential areas often have less employment opportunities, unequal schooling environments, and increased health risks. These factors combine to perpetuate poverty and prevent social and spatial mobility. The lack of employment opportunities come in many different forms such as decreased accessibility to jobs because of transportation or unavailability of jobs due to location. The result of unequal economic opportunities is the increase in income segregation. This further perpetuates poverty because low-income residents experience higher rent burden which forces them to accept low quality housing. This cycle <b>of</b> <b>poverty</b> also extends between generations. This means that children living in low-income neighborhoods {{are more likely to}} experience poverty and the same living standards as their parents' generation.|$|R

50|$|In the 1940s {{when the}} Bronx was usually divided into the East Bronx and West Bronx, {{a group of}} social workers {{identified}} a pocket of poverty on East 134th Street, east of Brown Place, and called it the South Bronx. This <b>area</b> <b>of</b> <b>poverty</b> would spread {{in part due to}} an illegal practice known as blockbusting and to Robert Moses building several housing projects in the neighborhood. The poverty greatly expanded northward, following the post-war phenomenon colloquially referred to as white flight, reaching a peak in the 1960s when the socioeconomic North Bronx-South Bronx boundary reached Fordham Road. At this time a wave of arson destroyed or damaged many of the residential, commercial, and industrial structures in the area.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{sets out}} to explore the {{achievements}} of civil society in the <b>area</b> <b>of</b> <b>poverty</b> reduction. The focus is mainly on three domains (1) Advocacy; (2) Policy Change and (3) Service Delivery. Three case studies illustrate how poverty can be addressed at various levels and through different approaches: (1) Shack Dwellers International (SDI) operating internationally to advocate for the urban poor’s rights; (2) civil society organizations participating {{in the formulation of}} PRSPs to call for pro-poor policy reforms at the national level; and finally (3) the example of BRAC (formerly the Bangladesh Rural Advancement Committee) providing services to the poorest at the grassroots level. Drawing on these case studies, the paper explains the keys to success and reasons for failure of civil society organizations in tackling poverty reduction effectively. It concludes by pointing out the challenges faced by civil society in the <b>area</b> <b>of</b> <b>poverty</b> reduction and presents recommendations on ‘what is still missing’ for civil society to play a more effective role in poverty reduction. ...|$|E

40|$|Every program {{designed}} to decrease poverty is based upon assumptions either as to the nature and causes of poverty or {{what is necessary to}} help the poor improve their lot (Spilerman and Elish, 1970; Task Force on Economic Growth and Opportunity, 1966; Valentine, 1968). Often these assumptions are only implicit, and supervisors of the program might not even agree with the assumptions if they were stated. Nevertheless, a program would itself make no sense unless certain statements about poverty were true. For example, a program of economic development to increase employment opportunities assumes that, first, much poverty is due to structural features, especially a shortage of jobs in the labor force, and that employment of the poor will be a major factor in decreasing poverty. On the other hand, job training assumes that there are jobs, but that the poor are not qualified to fill the openings. The amount of support or opposition to programs in the <b>area</b> <b>of</b> <b>poverty</b> depends not only upon cost and apparent effectiveness, but also upon the concepts of poverty extant in the public view. As sociologists are increasingly involved in applied work in the <b>area</b> <b>of</b> <b>poverty,</b> the necessity of knowing the assumptions and concepts found among leaders in {{the public and private sectors}} is of paramount importance. Failures in communication and actual disagreements can only be minimized if the sociologist is aware of the implicit assumptions in programs and the often unexpressed concepts held by those who are to accept or reject his recommendations...|$|E

Such energy poverty indicators provide an invaluable extra dimension in the assessment in that they relate to all three sustainability spheres: economic, social and environmental.

40|$|The {{evolution}} of a ‘poverty alleviation ’ focus within ACIAR is briefly described. ACIAR has undertaken intensive efforts with ex ante and ex post economic evaluation for many years, but explicit measurement of achievement in the <b>area</b> <b>of</b> <b>poverty</b> alleviation has been minimal. This is because: (a) the concept of poverty alleviation is elusive; (b) calculation of poverty alleviation first requires the calculation of economic benefits (unless poverty alleviation is to be ‘self assessed’); (c) calculation of economic benefits from research can be difficult per se; and (d) the distribution of economic benefits is difficult/impossible to discern in a partial equilibrium framework. In light of these issues, the pragmatic approach taken within ACIAR is described. This approach remains fairly strongly focussed upon the assessment of economic benefits, but with a poverty alleviation flavour. 1...|$|E
