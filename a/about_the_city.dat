5|$|The open {{world was}} {{modelled}} on Southern California and Los Angeles, and its design and in-game render constituted {{much of the}} game's early work.

Google Maps projections of Los Angeles were used by the team to help design Los Santos' road networks. To reflect and reproduce Los Angeles' demographic spread, the developers studied census data and watched documentaries <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>city.</b> The team considered creating the open world the most technically demanding aspect of the game's production.|$|E
5|$|Two decades later, Phoenix was {{the subject}} of discussions <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>city</b> budget. In the late 1970s, the fireboat's annual {{operating}} expenses were about $1.2million. Mayor George Moscone met with the San Francisco Port Commission in 1977 to determine whether Phoenix would be refurbished, replaced, or scrapped with no replacement. An improvement bond was passed in November 1977 to build a new fireboat. Local naval architects Morris Guralnick Associates submitted a design in 1980 to replace Phoenix, but the estimated construction costs far exceeded the bond. Instead, Mayor Dianne Feinstein redirected the funds to refurbish Phoenix in 1981–1982.|$|E
