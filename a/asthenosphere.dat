5|$|More {{recent studies}} by volcanologists {{associated}} with the Geological Survey of Canada have indicated that the subducted extension of the Nookta Fault may be {{the primary cause of}} the alkalic structure of the Wells Gray-Clearwater volcanic field. The volcanism might have been mostly generated by asthenospheric upwelling possibly by displacement along the transform fault. If the transform fault had a section of vertical tearing to contain potentially different dip angles between the Explorer and Juan de Fuca Plates, the subducted plate <b>asthenosphere</b> may possibly flow upward into the mantle wedge. Similarly, if the displacement had a section of extension, a horizontal slab window-like gap would have developed, again allowing a pathway for upwelling magma. In either case, the unsettled <b>asthenosphere</b> might have experienced low degrees of decompressional melting and interacted with North American lithosphere to yield within plate compositions.|$|E
5|$|The {{mechanically}} rigid {{outer layer}} of Earth, the lithosphere, {{is divided into}} pieces called tectonic plates. These plates are rigid segments that move in relation to one another at one of three types of plate boundaries: convergent boundaries, at which two plates come together, divergent boundaries, at which two plates are pulled apart, and transform boundaries, in which two plates slide past one another laterally. Earthquakes, volcanic activity, mountain-building, and oceanic trench formation can occur along these plate boundaries. The tectonic plates ride {{on top of the}} <b>asthenosphere,</b> the solid but less-viscous part of the upper mantle that can flow and move along with the plates.|$|E
5|$|The {{creation}} of the abyssal plain {{is the result of}} the spreading of the seafloor (plate tectonics) and the melting of the lower oceanic crust. Magma rises from above the <b>asthenosphere</b> (a layer of the upper mantle), and as this basaltic material reaches the surface at mid-ocean ridges, it forms new oceanic crust, which is constantly pulled sideways by spreading of the seafloor. Abyssal plains result from the blanketing of an originally uneven surface of oceanic crust by fine-grained sediments, mainly clay and silt. Much of this sediment is deposited by turbidity currents that have been channelled from the continental margins along submarine canyons into deeper water. The rest is composed chiefly of pelagic sediments. Metallic nodules are common in some areas of the plains, with varying concentrations of metals, including manganese, iron, nickel, cobalt, and copper.|$|E
5|$|The lithosphere, which rides {{atop the}} <b>asthenosphere,</b> {{is divided into}} a number of tectonic plates that are {{continuously}} being created and consumed at their opposite plate boundaries. Oceanic crust and tectonic plates are formed and move apart at mid-ocean ridges. Abyssal hills are formed by stretching of the oceanic lithosphere. Consumption or destruction of the oceanic lithosphere occurs at oceanic trenches (a type of convergent boundary, also known as a destructive plate boundary) by a process known as subduction. Oceanic trenches are found at places where the oceanic lithospheric slabs of two different plates meet, and the denser (older) slab begins to descend back into the mantle. At the consumption edge of the plate (the oceanic trench), the oceanic lithosphere has thermally contracted to become quite dense, and it sinks under its own weight in the process of subduction. The subduction process consumes older oceanic lithosphere, so oceanic crust is seldom more than 200 million years old. The overall process of repeated cycles of creation and destruction of oceanic crust is known as the Supercontinent cycle, first proposed by Canadian geophysicist and geologist John Tuzo Wilson.|$|E
25|$|The {{outer layers}} of the Earth are divided into the {{lithosphere}} and <b>asthenosphere.</b> The division is based on differences in mechanical properties and in the method for the transfer of heat. The lithosphere is cooler and more rigid, while the <b>asthenosphere</b> is hotter and flows more easily. In terms of heat transfer, the lithosphere loses heat by conduction, whereas the <b>asthenosphere</b> also transfers heat by convection and has a nearly adiabatic temperature gradient. This division {{should not be confused}} with the chemical subdivision of these same layers into the mantle (comprising both the <b>asthenosphere</b> and the mantle portion of the lithosphere) and the crust: a given piece of mantle may be part of the lithosphere or the <b>asthenosphere</b> at different times depending on its temperature and pressure.|$|E
25|$|Basal drag ({{friction}}): Plate motion {{driven by}} {{friction between the}} convection currents in the <b>asthenosphere</b> and the more rigid overlying lithosphere.|$|E
25|$|Where the oceanic {{crust is}} subducted under a {{continental}} plate sediments {{will be carried}} down to warmer zones in the <b>asthenosphere</b> and lithosphere. Under these conditions calcium carbonate decomposes to produce carbon dioxide which, along with other gases, give rise to explosive volcanic eruptions.|$|E
25|$|It has {{generally}} been accepted that tectonic plates are able to move because of the relative density of oceanic lithosphere and the relative weakness of the <b>asthenosphere.</b> Dissipation of heat from the mantle is acknowledged to be the original source of the energy required to drive plate tectonics through convection or large scale upwelling and doming. The current view, though still {{a matter of some}} debate, asserts that as a consequence, a powerful source of plate motion is generated due to the excess density of the oceanic lithosphere sinking in subduction zones. When the new crust forms at mid-ocean ridges, this oceanic lithosphere is initially less dense than the underlying <b>asthenosphere,</b> but it becomes denser with age as it conductively cools and thickens. The greater density of old lithosphere relative to the underlying <b>asthenosphere</b> allows it to sink into the deep mantle at subduction zones, providing most of the driving force for plate movement. The weakness of the <b>asthenosphere</b> allows the tectonic plates to move easily towards a subduction zone. Although subduction is thought to be the strongest force driving plate motions, it cannot be the only force since there are plates such as the North American Plate which are moving, yet are nowhere being subducted. The same is true for the enormous Eurasian Plate. The sources of plate motion are a matter of intensive research and discussion among scientists. One of the main points is that the kinematic pattern of the movement itself should be separated clearly from the possible geodynamic mechanism that is invoked as the driving force of the observed movement, as some patterns may be explained by more than one mechanism. In short, the driving forces advocated at the moment can be divided into three categories based on the relationship to the movement: mantle dynamics related, gravity related (mostly secondary forces), and earth rotation related.|$|E
25|$|Volcanism in {{this field}} appears {{to be related to}} {{volcanism}} which is widespread in this part of Asia. Localized <b>asthenosphere</b> upwellings may be responsible for these volcanic events at Hangai and other volcanic centres around Lake Baikal. Other theories for the Hangai postulate a mantle plume or the removal of part of the lithosphere by asthenospheric currents.|$|E
25|$|The key {{principle}} of plate tectonics {{is that the}} lithosphere exists as separate and distinct tectonic plates, which ride on the fluid-like (visco-elastic solid) <b>asthenosphere.</b> Plate motions range up to a typical 10–40mm/year (Mid-Atlantic Ridge; about as fast as fingernails grow), to about 160mm/year (Nazca Plate; about as fast as hair grows). The driving mechanism behind this movement is described below.|$|E
25|$|In the 1960s, it was {{discovered}} that the Earth's lithosphere, which includes the crust and rigid uppermost portion of the upper mantle, is separated into tectonic plates that move across the plastically deforming, solid, upper mantle, which is called the <b>asthenosphere.</b> This theory is supported by several types of observations, including seafloor spreading and the global distribution of mountain terrain and seismicity.|$|E
25|$|The basaltic {{rocks in}} the oceanic and {{continental}} sectors of the Cameroon line are similar in composition, although the more evolved rocks are quite distinct. The similarity in basaltic rocks may indicate {{they have the same}} source. Since the lithosphere mantle below Africa must be different in chemical and isotopic composition from the younger lithosphere below the Atlantic, one explanation is that the source is in the <b>asthenosphere</b> rather than in metasomatized lithosphere.|$|E
25|$|A type of basin {{formed by}} the moving apart of two pieces of a {{continent}} is called a rift basin. Rift basins are elongated, narrow and deep basins. Due to divergent movement, the lithosphere is stretched and thinned, so that the hot <b>asthenosphere</b> rises and heats the overlying rift basin. Apart from continental sediments, rift basins normally also have part of their infill consisting of volcanic deposits. When the basin grows due to continued stretching of the lithosphere, the rift grows and the sea can enter, forming marine deposits.|$|E
25|$|Between 18 and 12 mya the Puna-Altiplano {{region was}} subject to an episode of flat {{subduction}} of the Nazca Plate. A steepening of the subduction after 12 mya resulted in the influx of hot <b>asthenosphere.</b> Until that point, differentiation and crystallization of rising mafic magmas had mostly produced andesitic magmas. The change in plate movements and increased melt generation caused an overturn and anatexis of the melt generating zone, forming a density barrier for mafic melts which subsequently ponded below the melt generating zone. Dacitic melts escaped from this zone, forming diapirs and the magma chambers that generated APVC ignimbrite volcanism.|$|E
25|$|Slab-pull: Current {{scientific}} {{opinion is that}} the <b>asthenosphere</b> is insufficiently competent or rigid to directly cause motion by friction along {{the base of the}} lithosphere. Slab pull is therefore most widely thought to be the greatest force acting on the plates. In this current understanding, plate motion is mostly driven by the weight of cold, dense plates sinking into the mantle at trenches. Recent models indicate that trench suction plays an important role as well. However, the fact that the North American Plate is nowhere being subducted, although it is in motion, presents a problem. The same holds for the African, Eurasian, and Antarctic plates.|$|E
25|$|For much of {{the last}} quarter century, the leading theory of the driving force behind tectonic plate motions envisaged large scale {{convection}} currents in the upper mantle, which can be transmitted through the <b>asthenosphere.</b> This theory was launched by Arthur Holmes and some forerunners in the 1930s and was immediately recognized as the solution for the acceptance of the theory as originally discussed in the papers of Alfred Wegener {{in the early years of}} the century. However, despite its acceptance, it was long debated in the scientific community because the leading theory still envisaged a static Earth without moving continents up until the major breakthroughs of the early sixties.|$|E
25|$|A third type of basin exists along {{convergent}} plate boundaries – {{places where}} one tectonic plate moves under another into the <b>asthenosphere.</b> The subducting plate bends and forms a fore-arc basin {{in front of}} the overriding plate—an elongated, deep asymmetric basin. Fore-arc basins are filled with deep marine deposits and thick sequences of turbidites. Such infill is called flysch. When the convergent movement of the two plates results in continental collision, the basin becomes shallower and develops into a foreland basin. At the same time, tectonic uplift forms a mountain belt in the overriding plate, from which large amounts of material are eroded and transported to the basin. Such erosional material of a growing mountain chain is called molasse and has either a shallow marine or a continental facies.|$|E
25|$|As the {{northern}} Atlantic {{opened to the}} east of Greenland during the Eocene, North America and Eurasia drifted apart; the Mid-Atlantic Ridge formed as an oceanic spreading center and a part of the submarine volcanic system of mid-oceanic ridges. The initial plume head may have been several thousand kilometers in diameter, and it erupted volcanic rocks {{on both sides of the}} present ocean basin to produce the North Atlantic Igneous Province. Upon further opening of the ocean and plate drift, the plume and the mid-Atlantic Ridge are postulated to have approached one another, and finally met. The excess magmatism that accompanied the transition from flood volcanism on Greenland, Ireland and Norway to present-day Icelandic activity was the result of ascent of the hot mantle source beneath progressively thinning lithosphere, according to the plume model, or a postulated unusually productive part of the mid-ocean ridge system. Some geologist have suggested that the Iceland plume could have been responsible for the Paleogene uplift of the Scandinavian Mountains by producing changes in the density of the lithosphere and <b>asthenosphere</b> during the opening of the North Atlantic.|$|E
25|$|Following the February 2000 encounter, Galileos {{mission at}} Jupiter was {{extended}} {{for a second}} and final time with the Galileo Millennium Mission. The focus of this extended mission was joint observation of the Jovian system by both Galileo and Cassini, which performed a distant flyby of Jupiter en route to Saturn on December 30, 2000. Discoveries during the joint observations of Io revealed a new plume at Tvashtar and provided insights into Io's aurorae. Distant imaging by Galileo during the Cassini flyby revealed a new red ring plume deposit, similar to the one surrounding Pele, around Tvashtar, one of the first of this type seen in Io's polar regions, though Galileo would later observe a similar deposit around Dazhbog Patera in August 2001. Galileo performed three additional flybys of Io, on August 6 and October 16, 2001 and January 17, 2002, during the Galileo Millennium Mission. Both encounters in 2001 allowed Galileo to observe Io's polar regions up-close, though imaging from the August 2001 flyby was lost due to a camera malfunction. The data from the magnetometer confirmed that Io lacked an intrinsic magnetic field, though later analysis of this data in 2009 did reveal evidence for an induced magnetic field generated by the interaction between Jupiter's magnetosphere and a silicate magma ocean in Io's <b>asthenosphere.</b> During the August 2001 flyby, Galileo flew through the outer portions of the newly formed Thor volcanic plume, allowing for the first direct measurement of composition of Io's volcanic material. During the October 2001 encounter, Galileo imaged the new Thor eruption site, a major new lava flow at Gish Bar Patera, and the lava lake at Pele. Due to a safing event prior to the encounter, nearly all of the observations planned for the January 2002 flyby were lost.|$|E
500|$|The {{subduction}} of the Nazca {{plate and}} the Antarctic plate beneath {{the western side}} of South America has generated a belt of volcanic activity named the Andean Volcanic Belt. The belt is separated in a number of volcanic zones by segments lacking recent volcanic activity; in these segments, shallow subduction of the plates presumably displaces the <b>asthenosphere</b> away from these segments. The segments with active volcanism are the Northern Volcanic Zone (NVZ), the Central Volcanic Zone (CVZ), the Southern Volcanic Zone (SVZ) and the Austral Volcanic Zone [...] (AVZ). [...] The [...] "Volcanoes of the World" [...] catalogue counts about 575 eruptions in the entire volcanic belt.|$|E
500|$|That {{spreading}} ridges {{could be}} subducted was recognized {{early in the}} development of plate tectonic theory, but there was little consideration of the ensuing effects. In the 1980s came realization that the magma welling up from the <b>asthenosphere</b> through the subducted ridge would not reach seawater, and thus not be quenched to form rock and close the gap. Continued spreading would lead to a widening gap or [...] "window" [...] in the subducting plate through which there could be increased flow of magma The implications of this for Siletzia were first shown by [...] and [...] (following the pioneering work by [...] ). [...] subsequently identified the fan-shaped wake of volcanics of distinctive geochemistry left by the widening Kula-Farallon slab window across northeastern Washington and into Idaho.|$|E
500|$|Earth's interior, {{like that}} of the other {{terrestrial}} planets, is divided into layers by their chemical or physical (rheological) properties. The outer layer is a chemically distinct silicate solid crust, which is underlain by a highly viscous solid mantle. The crust is separated from the mantle by the Mohorovičić discontinuity. The thickness of the crust varies from about [...] (kilometers) under the oceans to 30–50km for the continents. The crust and the cold, rigid, top of the upper mantle are collectively known as the lithosphere, and it is of the lithosphere that the tectonic plates are composed. Beneath the lithosphere is the <b>asthenosphere,</b> a relatively low-viscosity layer on which the lithosphere rides. Important changes in crystal structure within the mantle occur at 410 and [...] below the surface, spanning a transition zone that separates the upper and lower mantle. Beneath the mantle, an extremely low viscosity liquid outer core lies above a solid inner core. The Earth's inner core might rotate at a slightly higher angular velocity than the remainder of the planet, advancing by 0.1–0.5° per year. The radius of the inner core is about one fifth of that of Earth.|$|E
2500|$|Imbabura is {{a volcano}} in the {{southern}} Ring of Fire. [...] As the Nazca Plate is subducted beneath the South American Plate, the former melts with exposure to the hotter <b>asthenosphere.</b> [...] This melted rock, which is less dense than the crust above it, rises to the surface. [...] The result is an arc of volcanoes, which includes Imbabura, 100–300km away from the subduction zone.|$|E
2500|$|Alternative models include: 1) flow of {{material}} from {{the top layer of}} the mantle (<b>asthenosphere)</b> {{around the edge of the}} Juan de Fuca Plate (a.k.a. [...] "Vancouver slab"), 2) flows reflecting lithospheric topography (such as the edge of the craton), 3) faulting in the lithosphere, or 4) extension of the Basin and Range province (which in turn may be due to interactions between the North American, Pacific, and Farallon Plates, and possibly with the subduction of the triple point where the three plates came together), but none is yet fully accepted.|$|E
2500|$|Two main {{zones are}} {{distinguished}} {{in the upper}} mantle: the inner <b>asthenosphere</b> composed of plastic flowing rock of varying thickness, on average about [...] thick, and the lowermost part of the lithosphere composed of rigid rock about [...] thick. A thin crust, {{the upper part of}} the lithosphere, surrounds the mantle and is about [...] thick. Recent analysis of hydrous ringwoodite from the mantle suggests that there is between one and three times as much water in the transition zone between the lower and upper mantle than in all the world's oceans combined.|$|E
2500|$|Tectonic {{plates are}} able to move because the Earth's {{lithosphere}} has greater mechanical strength than the underlying <b>asthenosphere.</b> Lateral density variations in the mantle result in convection; that is, the slow creeping motion of Earth's solid mantle. Plate movement {{is thought to be}} driven by a combination of the motion of the seafloor away from spreading ridges due to variations in topography (the ridge is a topographic high) and density changes in the crust (density increases as newly formed crust cools and moves away from the ridge). At subduction zones the relatively cold, dense crust is [...] "pulled" [...] or sinks down into the mantle over the downward convecting limb of a mantle cell. Another explanation lies in the different forces generated by tidal forces of the Sun and Moon. The relative importance of each of these factors and their relationship to each other is unclear, and still the subject of much debate.|$|E
2500|$|There {{are several}} factors {{that control the}} depth of trenches. [...] The most {{important}} control is the supply of sediment, which fills the trench {{so that there is}} no bathymetric expression. It is therefore not surprising that the deepest trenches (deeper than [...] ) are all nonaccretionary. [...] In contrast, all trenches with growing accretionary prisms are shallower than [...] A second order control on trench depth is the age of the lithosphere at the time of subduction. Because oceanic lithosphere cools and thickens as it ages, it subsides. The older the seafloor, the deeper it lies, and this determines the minimum depth from which the seafloor begins to descend. [...] This obvious correlation can be removed by looking at the relative depth, the difference between regional seafloor depth and maximum trench depth. Relative depth may be controlled by the age of the lithosphere at the trench, the convergence rate, and the dip of the subducted slab at intermediate depths. Finally, narrow slabs can sink and roll back more rapidly than broad plates, because it is easier for underlying <b>asthenosphere</b> to flow {{around the edges of the}} sinking plate. [...] Such slabs may have steep dips at relatively shallow depths and so may be associated with unusually deep trenches, such as the Challenger Deep.|$|E
2500|$|Stratovolcanoes are {{a common}} feature of {{subduction}} zones. The magma that forms them arises when water, which is trapped both in hydrated minerals and in the porous basalt rock of the upper oceanic crust, is released into mantle rock of the <b>asthenosphere</b> above the sinking oceanic slab. The release of water from hydrated minerals is termed [...] "dewatering", and occurs at specific pressure/temperature conditions for specific minerals as the plate subducts to lower depths. The water freed from the subducting slab lowers the melting point of the overlying mantle rock, which then undergoes partial melting and rises due to its density relative to the surrounding mantle rock, and pools temporarily {{at the base of}} the lithosphere. The magma then rises through the crust, incorporating silica rich crustal rock, leading to a final intermediate composition. When the magma nears the surface it pools in a magma chamber under the volcano. The relatively low pressure of the magma allows water and other volatiles (CO2, S2−, Cl−) dissolved in the magma to begin to come out of solution, much like when a bottle of carbonated water is opened. Once a critical volume of magma and gas accumulates, the obstacle provided by the volcanic cone is overcome, leading to a sudden explosive eruption.|$|E
2500|$|Trenches are centerpieces of the {{distinctive}} physiography of a convergent plate margin. Transects across trenches yield asymmetric profiles, with relatively gentle (~5°) outer (seaward) slopes and a steeper (~10–16°) inner (landward) slopes. [...] This asymmetry {{is due to}} the fact that the outer slope is defined by the top of the downgoing plate, which must bend as it starts its descent. [...] The great thickness of the lithosphere requires that this bending be gentle. As the subducting plate approaches the trench, it first bends upwards to form the outer trench swell, then descends to form the outer trench slope. The outer trench slope is typically disrupted by a set of sub-parallel normal faults that 'staircase' the seafloor down to the trench. The plate boundary is defined by the trench axis itself. Beneath the inner trench wall, the two plates slide past each other along the subduction decollement, the seafloor intersection of which defines the trench location. The overriding plate typically contains a volcanic arc and forearc region. The volcanic arc is caused by physical and chemical interactions between the subducted plate at depth and asthenospheric mantle associated with the overriding plate. The forearc lies between the trench and the volcanic arc. Globally, forearcs have the lowest heatflow from the interior Earth because there is no <b>asthenosphere</b> (convecting mantle) between the forearc lithosphere and the cold subducting plate.|$|E
2500|$|Convergent {{boundaries}} (Destructive) (or active margins) occur {{where two}} plates slide {{toward each other}} to form either a subduction zone (one plate moving underneath the other) or a continental collision. At zones of ocean-to-continent subduction (e.g. the Andes mountain range in South America, and the Cascade Mountains in Western United States), the dense oceanic lithosphere plunges beneath the less dense continent. Earthquakes trace {{the path of the}} downward-moving plate as it descends into <b>asthenosphere,</b> a trench forms, and as the subducted plate is heated it releases volatiles, mostly water from hydrous minerals, into the surrounding mantle. The addition of water lowers the melting point of the mantle material above the subducting slab, causing it to melt. The magma that results typically leads to volcanism. At zones of ocean-to-ocean subduction (e.g. Aleutian islands, Mariana Islands, and the Japanese island arc), older, cooler, denser crust slips beneath less dense crust. This motion causes earthquakes and a deep trench to form in an arc shape. The upper mantle of the subducted plate then heats and magma rises to form curving chains of volcanic islands. Deep marine trenches are typically associated with subduction zones, and the basins that develop along the active boundary are often called [...] "foreland basins". Closure of ocean basins can occur at continent-to-continent boundaries (e.g., Himalayas and Alps): collision between masses of granitic continental lithosphere; neither mass is subducted; plate edges are compressed, folded, uplifted.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>asthenosphere</b> (from Greek ἀσθενής asthenḗs 'weak' + [...] "sphere") is {{the highly}} viscous, {{mechanically}} weak and ductilely deforming {{region of the}} upper mantle of the Earth. It lies below the lithosphere, at depths between approximately 80 and 200 km below the surface. The Lithosphere-Asthenosphere boundary is usually referred to as LAB. The <b>asthenosphere</b> is almost solid, although some of its regions could be molten (e.g., below mid-ocean ridges). The lower boundary of the <b>asthenosphere</b> is not well defined. The thickness of the <b>asthenosphere</b> depends mainly on the temperature. In some regions the <b>asthenosphere</b> could extend as deep as 700 km. It is considered the source region of mid-ocean ridge basalt (MORB).|$|E
50|$|The {{outer layers}} of the Earth are divided into the {{lithosphere}} and <b>asthenosphere.</b> This is based on differences in mechanical properties and in the method for the transfer of heat.

5000|$|The {{upper part}} of the <b>asthenosphere</b> is {{believed}} to be the zone upon which the great rigid and brittle lithospheric plates of the Earth's crust move about. Due to the temperature and pressure conditions in the <b>asthenosphere,</b> rock becomes ductile, moving at rates of deformation measured in cm/yr over lineal distances eventually measuring thousands of kilometers. In this way, it flows like a convection current, radiating heat outward from the Earth's interior. Above the <b>asthenosphere,</b> at the same rate of deformation, rock behaves elastically and, being brittle, can break, causing faults. The rigid lithosphere is thought to [...] "float" [...] or move about on the slowly flowing <b>asthenosphere,</b> creating the movement of tectonic plates.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>asthenosphere</b> {{is a part}} of {{the upper}} mantle just below the {{lithosphere}} that is involved in plate tectonic movement and isostatic adjustments. The lithosphere-asthenosphere boundary is conventionally taken at the 1300 °C isotherm, above which the mantle behaves in a rigid fashion and below which it behaves in a ductile fashion. Seismic waves pass relatively slowly through the <b>asthenosphere</b> [...] compared to the overlying lithospheric mantle, thus it has been called the low-velocity zone (LVZ), although the two are not exactly the same. This decreasing in seismic waves velocity from lithosphere to <b>asthenosphere</b> could be caused by the presence of a very small percentage of melt in the <b>asthenosphere.</b> The lower boundary of the LVZ lies at a depth of 180-220 km, whereas the base of the <b>asthenosphere</b> lies at a depth of about 700 km.
