40|$|Since {{years it}} is known that radio {{communication}} used by ATC can easily be intruded and is therefore subject to recurrent attacks. Nevertheless the voice communication between pilots and controllers is still the most flexible and efficient medium especially in a busy traffic environment, in non-standard situations or simply when exchanging air-ground messages in plain language is needed. As vulnerability seems not dominant compared to the number of crucial damages, voice communication is still the basic and most important communication method within the <b>aeronautical</b> <b>mobile</b> <b>service.</b> This motivated the development of a prototype for secure ATC communications (SACom) within the frame of the Global ATM Security Management Project (GAMMA). The challenge when designing a security management prototype for ATM is not only {{to find out if the}} concept is appropriate to minimize the expected impact of possible attacks. In fact the benefit for the participating stakeholders has to be evaluated and proven by appropriate evidence. The need for evidence leads to the understanding that there is a clear lack existing between the theoretically defined outlines by NextGen and SESAR and the measures at hand to validate prototypes in the area of ATM security. The document highlights the approach to validate the proposed system to secure ATC communication. Therefore the paper describes the intended prototype to secure ATC voice communication and the different modules it consists of. Moreover the surrounding validation environment and the dedicated validation platform for investigating the prototype is elaborated and described in detail. To achieve this, reader’s mindset will be sharpened for the idea of validation platform subsets and validation environment building blocks Within the project the prototype for secure ATC communication has been designed and developed. The verification of the prototype has been conducted in the Air Traffic Management Validation Center of the DLR in 2015 / 2016, whereas the first validation exercises were conducted in late spring of 2016. During the exercises the benefit of each single module as the benefit of the correlated value of all indicators will be validated. The prototype is not only been verified and validated as a single system. Moreover, during the preparatory work for the validation exercises a small scale experimental setup was used together with partners in the project in order to elaborate added value of the presented prototype already as a pre-production sample. The results obtained already demonstrate the general feasibility of the developed prototype. A detailed discussion of the preliminary validation results will be done in the full paper. This research-in-progress paper presents the initial findings from the validation and initial implementation of the security management prototype for secure ATC communications. The recent work supports the current security engineering needs and offers an iteratively deployable capability to complement the current ATM/CNS system and future deployment activities under SESAR or NextGen. The applied approach for the validation of this single prototype provides a mature basis for setting up a distinct methodology for validation of other ATM security oriented systems...|$|E

40|$|A {{critical}} {{aspect of}} the Access 5 program is identifying appropriate spectrum for civil and commercial purposes. However, currently, there is no spectrum allocated for the command/control link between the aircraft control station and the unmanned aircraft.

40|$|This paper {{reports on}} the {{performance}} of <b>Aeronautical</b> <b>Mobile</b> Satellite <b>Service</b> (AMSS), based on simulation results, when incorporated into the Aeronautical Telecommunications Network (ATN). A comparison between its performance under current data traffic load and under future ATN traffic load was used to determine the reliability of AMSS in providing continuous communications between the ground and the aircraft over remote regions of the globe. The simulation involved modeling AMSS through the use of the published standards to ensure the accuracy of the results. Although the results indicated that there is indeed a reduced capacity (to about one-fourth) and efficiency of the system at the increased traffic load, the reduction in performance does not lead to the conclusion that an alternative to AMSS must be found. On the contrary, some modifications to the protocols controlling the operation of AMSS and updating the system with new technologies, would make it as valid {{a solution to the problem}} as it is today...|$|R

40|$|This {{presentation}} is an overview on Satellite Communication for the Aeronautical Telecommunication Management (ATM) research. Satellite Communications are being {{considered by the}} FAA and NASA as a possible alternative to {{the present and future}} ground systems supporting Air Traffic Communications. The international Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) have in place Standards and Recommended Practices (SARPS) for the <b>Aeronautical</b> <b>Mobile</b> Satellite <b>Services</b> (AMSS) which is mainly derived from the pre-existing Inmarsat service that has been in service since the 1980 s. The Working Group A of the <b>Aeronautical</b> <b>Mobile</b> Communication Panel of ICAO has also been investigating SARPS for what is called the Next Generation Satellite Service (NGSS) which conforms less to the Inmarsat based architecture and explores wider options in terms of satellite architectures. Several designs are being proposed by Firms such as Boeing, ESA, NASA that are geared toward full or secondary usage of satellite communications for ATM. Satellite communications for ATM can serve several purposes ranging from primary usage where ground services would play a minimal backup role, to an integrated solution where it will be used to cover services, or areas that {{are less likely to be}} supported by the proposed and existing ground infrastructure. Such Integrated roles can include usage of satellite communications for oceanic and remote land areas for example. It also can include relieving the capacity of the ground network by providing broadcast based services of Traffic Information Services messages (TIS-B), or Flight Information Services (FIS-B) which can take a significant portion of the ground system capacity. Additionally, satellite communication can play a backup role to support any needs for ground replacement, or additional needed capacity even after the new digital systems are in place. The additional bandwidth that can be provided via satellite communications can also open the door for many new applications that generally will enhance the standard services provided. All of those possibilities were investigated and comments, as well as descriptions of those analyses are put forward, as well as suggestions for future areas of study...|$|R
