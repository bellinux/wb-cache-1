5|$|The first toothless {{ancestors}} of Mysticetes {{appeared before the}} first radiation in the late Oligocene. Eomysticetus <b>and</b> <b>others</b> <b>like</b> <b>it</b> showed no evidence in the skull of echolocation abilities, suggesting they mainly relied on their eyesight for navigation. The eomysticetes had long, flat rostra that lacked teeth and had blowholes located halfway up the dorsal side of the snout. Though the palate is not well-preserved in these specimens, they {{are thought to have}} had baleen and been filter feeders. Miocene baleen whales were preyed upon by larger predators like killer sperm whales and Megalodon.|$|E
5|$|This action (<b>and</b> <b>others</b> <b>like</b> <b>it)</b> was {{intensely}} unpopular {{with the}} other investors, however, and he was blackballed from entry in the New York Stock Exchange several times before regaining admittance. Following the event, a rule was made to limit the length of any option contracts to sixty days, to prevent a similar coup on the short side. After some troubles, Little was again worth $2 million by 1846 (equivalent to about $ million today). However, his fortunes were again reversed that year when he attempted but failed to corner the Norwich and Worcester Railroad and was obligated to pay out for thousands of inflated shares that he had himself bid up in price, losing about {{a million dollars in}} the process—a staggering sum at the time.|$|E
5|$|Air Force {{planners}} {{believed that}} Operation Commando Hunt VII (1 November 1971 to 29 March 1972) {{would be the}} most fruitful of the entire campaign. During this dry season phase, the U.S. averaged 182 attack fighters, 13 fixed-wing gunships, and 21 B-52 sorties per day. As a result of this all-out effort, U.S. intelligence analysts claimed 10,689 North Vietnamese trucks were destroyed and credited AC-130E Spectres alone with 7,335 of these kills. During the campaign, however, ominous signs appeared in the mountains of Laos. On 10 January 1972, a U.S. 0–1 observation aircraft, flying near the Mu Gia Pass, dodged the first surface-to-air missile(SAM) launched from Laotian soil. This event, <b>and</b> <b>others</b> <b>like</b> <b>it,</b> were compounded by the crossing into Laotian airspace of North Vietnamese MiG fighters. Both of these threats tended to force off B-52 and tactical air strikes. During the campaign, ten American aircraft were lost to SAMs (mostly SA-2 Guideline)s and another thirteen were lost to more conventional weapons.|$|E

5|$|Little {{is known}} about Atangana's childhood. Like other Beti boys, he would have learned to fish, hunt, and trap, and would have {{memorised}} his family's genealogy and folk wisdom. Explorers from the German Empire appeared near his village in 1887 {{in search of a}} direct route to the ivory trade in the savannas to the north. They had claimed Beti lands as part of their Kamerun colony in 1884, and by February 1889 they had established a permanent base in the area, which they named Jaunde after the local people. The Ewondo opposed the foreigners at first, although Atangana was probably not yet old enough to participate in the fighting. After the defeat of Omgba Bissogo in 1895 <b>and</b> <b>others</b> <b>like</b> <b>it,</b> Ewondo resistance waned. The Germans randomly appointed chiefs and mayors to serve under them, and took local youths to perform menial tasks; Atangana was among them, sent by his uncle to be a houseboy.|$|E
5|$|The {{majority}} of the toxic effects information came from a study conducted between 1 April 2005 to 1 September 2005. The study recorded all presentations associated with party pill use at the Emergency Department of Christchurch Hospital, New Zealand by recording them on a prospective data collection form. The aim was to study the patterns of human toxicity related {{to the use of}} benzylpiperazine-based 'party pills'. 61 patients presented on 80 occasions. Patients with mild to moderate toxicity experienced symptoms such as insomnia, anxiety, nausea, vomiting, palpitations, dystonia and urinary retention. Significantly, fourteen toxic seizures were recorded with two patients suffering life-threatening toxicity with status epilepticus and severe respiratory and metabolic acidosis. It was concluded that BZP appears to induce toxic seizures in neurologically normal subjects. The results of this study <b>and</b> <b>others</b> <b>like</b> <b>it</b> showed that BZP can cause unpredictable and serious toxicity in some individuals, but the data and dosage collection were reliant on self reporting by drug users, which may result in under-reporting (or over-reporting), and there were complicating factors like the frequent presence of alcohol and other drugs.|$|E

25|$|Vicari et al. {{describe}} that {{it remains unclear}} whether neural circuits involved in semantic and episodic memory overlap partially or completely, and this case {{seems to suggest that}} the two systems are independent. Both of the patient's hippocampal and diencephalic structures on the right and left sides were disconnected. When C.L. came to Vicari et al.'s office, her chief complaint was forgetfulness involving both semantic and episodic memory. After administering a battery of neuropsychological tests, Vicari determined that C.L. performed well in tests of visual naming and sentence comprehension, visual-spatial ability, and “general semantic knowledge about the world.” They also noted an improved vocabulary and general knowledge base after 18 months. C.L.'s episodic memory, on the other hand, was far below expectations: She could not retain daily events, where she had gone on vacation, the names of places she had been, and other such information. However, this study <b>and</b> <b>others</b> <b>like</b> <b>it</b> are susceptible to subjectivity, since it is not always possible to clearly distinguish between episodic and semantic memory. For this reason, the topic remains controversial and debated.|$|E
25|$|No {{video game}} console {{manufacturer}} has allowed any game marked AO {{to be published}} in North America; however, the PC gaming service Steam has allowed AO titles such as Hatred to be published on its platform. No major retailers are willing to sell AO-rated games. However, Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas was rated AO after the presence of the Hot Coffee add-on became evident. The add-on was later removed and the game rated M. In the 109th Congress and 110th Congress, the Video Games Enforcement Act was introduced to the US House of Representatives. The act required an identification check for the purchase of M and AO rated games. The bill <b>and</b> <b>others</b> <b>like</b> <b>it</b> did not succeed because of likely First Amendment violations. Although no law mandates identification checking for games with adult content, a 2008 survey by the Federal Trade Commission showed that video game retailers have voluntarily increased ID verification for M- and AO-rated games, and sales of those games to underage potential buyers decreased from 83% in 2000 to 20% in 2008. A further survey in April 2011, found that video game retailers continued to enforce the ratings by allowing only 13% of underage teenage shoppers to buy M-rated video games, a statistically significant decrease from the 20% purchase rate in 2009.|$|E

All featured the rise and eventual fall of an organized criminal. As described by crime film scholar Jack Shadoian the maxim became, [...] "If the films insist that one can’t win, under that given it’s how you lose that counts." [...] Scarface was the most controversial and violent; the film took nearly a year to reach theaters due to battles with censors. Obviously based {{on the life of}} Al Capone, Scarface <b>and</b> <b>others</b> <b>like</b> <b>it</b> outraged civic leaders who felt that movies were glorifying the lifestyles of criminals.|$|E

Justice Robert Grier of the U.S. Supreme Court, as circuit justice, tried the case, and instructed the jury to acquit on the grounds that though the defendants might be guilty of murder or riot, they were not charged with that, and were not guilty of treason.
