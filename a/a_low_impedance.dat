25|$|A {{lightning}} protection {{system is designed}} to protect a structure from damage due to lightning strikes by intercepting such strikes and safely passing their extremely high currents to ground. A {{lightning protection}} system includes a network of air terminals, bonding conductors, and ground electrodes designed to provide <b>a</b> <b>low</b> <b>impedance</b> path to ground for potential strikes.|$|E
25|$|The {{output of}} a given {{microphone}} delivers the same power whether it is low or high impedance. If a microphone is made in high and low impedance versions, the high impedance version has a higher output voltage for a given sound pressure input, and is suitable for use with vacuum-tube guitar amplifiers, for instance, which have a high input impedance and require a relatively high signal input voltage to overcome the tubes' inherent noise. Most professional microphones are low impedance, about 200Ω or lower. Professional vacuum-tube sound equipment incorporates a transformer that steps up the impedance of the microphone circuit to the high impedance and voltage needed to drive the input tube. External matching transformers are also available {{that can be used}} in-line between <b>a</b> <b>low</b> <b>impedance</b> microphone and a high impedance input.|$|E
25|$|Equipment bonding {{conductors}} provide <b>a</b> <b>low</b> <b>impedance</b> {{path between}} normally non-current-carrying metallic parts {{of equipment and}} one of the conductors of that electrical system's source. If any exposed metal part should become energized (fault), such as by a frayed or damaged conductor, it creates a short circuit, causing the overprotection device (circuit breaker or fuse) to open, clearing (disconnecting) the fault. It is important to note this action occurs regardless of whether there is a connection to the physical ground (earth); the earth itself has no role in this fault-clearing process since current must return to its source; however, the sources are very frequently connected to the physical ground (earth). (see Kirchhoff's circuit laws). By bonding (interconnecting) all exposed non-current carrying metal objects together and to other metallic objects such as pipes or structural steel, they should remain near the same voltage potential, thus reducing the chance of a shock. This is especially important in bathrooms where one may be in contact with several different metallic systems such as supply and drain pipes and appliance frames. When a system needs to be connected to the physical ground (earth), the equipment bonding conductor also becomes the equipment earthing conductor (see above).|$|E

500|$|Ultrasonography {{is based}} on the {{principle}} that sound can pass through human body tissues and is reflected by the tissue interfaces {{in the same way that}} light can reflect back on itself, from a mirror. Tissue in the body will offer varying degrees of resistance, known as acoustic impedance, to the path of the ultrasound beam. When there is a high impedance difference between two tissues, the interface between them will strongly reflect the sound. When the ultrasound beam meets air, or solid tissue such as bone, their [...] impedance difference is so great that most of the acoustic energy is reflected making it impossible to see any underlying structures. The examiner will see just a shadow, instead of the image expected. Air will impede sound waves which is why a gel is used. The gel prevents air bubbles from forming between the probe, and the patient's skin and so helps the conduction of the sound waves from the transducer into the body. The watery medium also helps to conduct the sound waves. Liquids, including blood have <b>a</b> <b>low</b> <b>impedance,</b> which means that little energy will be reflected and no visualization possible. One of the important exceptions is that when the blood flow is very slow it can in fact be seen, in what is termed [...] "spontaneous contrast".|$|E
2500|$|The tuned circuit, {{consisting}} of a coil and a capacitor connected together, acts as a resonator, similar to a tuning fork. Electric charge, induced in the antenna by the radio waves, flows rapidly {{back and forth between}} the plates of the capacitor through the coil. The circuit has a high impedance at the desired radio signal's frequency, but <b>a</b> <b>low</b> <b>impedance</b> at all other frequencies. [...] Hence, signals at undesired frequencies pass through the tuned circuit to ground, while the desired frequency is instead passed on to the detector (diode) and stimulates the earpiece and is heard. The frequency of the station received is the resonant frequency f of the tuned circuit, determined by the capacitance C of the capacitor and the inductance L of the coil: ...|$|E
2500|$|Ungrounded metal objects {{close to}} {{electric}} field {{sources such as}} neon signs or conductors carrying alternating currents can have measurable voltage levels caused by capacitive coupling. [...] Since voltages detected by high-impedance instruments disappear or become greatly reduced when <b>a</b> <b>low</b> <b>impedance</b> is substituted, the effect is sometimes called [...] phantom voltage (or ghost voltage). The term is often used by electricians, and might be seen, for example, when measuring the voltage at a lighting fixture after removing the bulb. [...] It is not unusual to measure phantom voltages of 50–90 volts when testing the wiring of ordinary 120V circuits with a high-impedance instrument. While the voltage produced may read almost to the full supply voltage, the capacitance or mutual inductance between the wires of building wiring systems is typically quite low and incapable of supplying significant amounts of current.|$|E

50|$|The {{result of}} this is that even {{ballpark}} impedance matching to an amplifier is impossible. This has a major effect on frequency response, and the amplifier must be able to tolerate <b>a</b> very <b>low</b> <b>impedance</b> load at <b>low</b> frequencies.|$|R
40|$|The nominal {{performance}} of AEA CBPD under simulated EOS-Aqua/Aura flight hardware configuration has been demonstrated. There {{is no evidence}} of cell rupture or excessive heat production during or after CBPD switch activation under simulated high cell impedance (open-circuit cell failure mode). Inadvertent CBPD switch activation with <b>a</b> charged cell (<b>low</b> <b>impedance</b> path) intermittently closes and opens up the switch, therefore the device may or may not provide protection against future open-circuit cell failure. Further testing with switches F 01 and F 02 may provide clarification.

2500|$|The early {{earphones}} {{used with}} wireless-era crystal sets had moving iron drivers that {{worked in a}} way similar to the horn loudspeakers of the period; modern loudspeakers use a moving-coil principle. Each earpiece contained a permanent magnet about which was a coil of wire which formed a second [...] electromagnet. Both magnetic poles were close to a steel diaphram of the speaker. When the audio signal from the radio was passed through the electromagnet's windings, current was caused to flow in the coil which created a varying magnetic field that augmented or diminished that due to the permanent magnet. This varied the force of attraction on the diaphragm, causing it to vibrate. The vibrations of the diaphragm push and pull {{on the air in}} front of it, creating sound waves. Standard headphones used in telephone work had <b>a</b> <b>low</b> <b>impedance,</b> often 75 Ω, and required more current than a crystal radio could supply. Therefore, the type used with crystal set radios (and other sensitive equipment) was wound with more turns of finer wire giving it a high impedance of 2000-8000 Ω.|$|E

The nominal performance of AEA CBPD under flight operating conditions (vacuum except zero-G, and high impedance cell) has been demonstrated.

50|$|In {{reflection}} seismology, a dim spot is <b>a</b> local <b>low</b> amplitude seismic attribute anomaly {{that can}} {{indicate the presence}} of hydrocarbons and is therefore known as a direct hydrocarbon indicator. It primarily results from the decrease in acoustic impedance contrast when a hydrocarbon (with <b>a</b> <b>low</b> acoustic <b>impedance)</b> replaces the brine-saturated zone (with a high acoustic impedance) that underlies a shale (with the <b>lowest</b> acoustic <b>impedance</b> of the three), decreasing the reflection coefficient.|$|R

50|$|In pre-RCD era, the TT {{earthing}} system was unattractive for general use {{because of the}} difficulty of arranging reliable automatic disconnection (ADS) {{in the case of a}} line-to-PE short circuit (in comparison with TN systems, where the same breaker or fuse will operate for either L-N or L-PE faults). But as residual current devices mitigate this disadvantage, the TT {{earthing system}} has become much more attractive providing that all AC power circuits are RCD-protected. In some countries (such as the UK) is recommended for situations where <b>an</b> <b>low</b> <b>impedance</b> equipotential zone is impractical to maintain by bonding, where there is significant outdoor wiring, such as supplies to mobile homes and some agricultural settings, or where a high fault current could pose other dangers, such as at fuel depots or marinas.|$|R

500|$|The inverted-L antenna is a {{monopole}} antenna {{bent over to}} run {{parallel to the ground}} plane. [...] It has the advantage of compactness and a shorter length than the λ/4 monopole, but the disadvantage of <b>a</b> very <b>low</b> <b>impedance,</b> typically just <b>a</b> few ohms. [...] The inverted-F antenna combines the advantages of both these antennae; it has the compactness of the inverted-L and the impedance matching capability of the F-type.|$|R

These limit the circuit topologies available; for example, most, {{but not all}} active filter topologies provide <b>a</b> buffered (<b>low</b> <b>impedance)</b> output. However, remember that the internal output impedance of operational amplifiers, if used, may rise markedly at high frequencies and reduce the attenuation from that expected. Be aware that some high-pass filter topologies present the input with almost a short circuit to high frequencies.|$|R
50|$|By convention, {{loudspeakers}} {{are designed}} to generate the same sound pressure level (SPL) at the listener for the same voltage at varying frequencies - regardless {{of the variation in}} electric power.
