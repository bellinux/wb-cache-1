25|$|Most {{oscilloscopes}} have a graticule {{as part of}} {{the visual}} display, to facilitate measurements. The graticule may be permanently marked inside the face of the CRT, or it may be a transparent external plate made of glass or <b>acrylic</b> <b>plastic.</b> An internal graticule eliminates parallax error, but cannot be changed to accommodate different types of measurements. Oscilloscopes commonly provide a means for the graticule to be illuminated from the side, which improves its visibility.|$|E

25|$|Radar became {{small enough}} to be carried on board aircraft, but the fragile feed horns and reflectors needed to be {{protected}} and streamlined from the airstream. Moulded radomes were constructed, using the Perspex <b>acrylic</b> <b>plastic</b> that was already in use for cockpit windows. This could be heated to soften it, then moulded or vacuum formed to shape. Other polymers developed at this time, notably Nylon, found uses in compact radio equipment as high-voltage insulators or dielectrics.|$|E
25|$|Deep Diver was 22 {{feet long}} and 8.5 feet tall. It weighed 8.25 tons dry. It allowed one pilot and three {{observers}} to dive {{for a total of}} 32 man-hours to a depth limit of 1350 feet. The pressure hull was made of steel, 54 inches thick for the pilots' and divers' compartments. Deep Divers main hatch was 23 inches in diameter. The submersible featured no manipulators. It had twenty-one <b>acrylic</b> <b>plastic</b> viewports. The ballast and trim tanks provided 845 pounds and 676 pounds of positive buoyancy, respectively, when emptied. A large battery pod containing four battery banks could be jettisoned in an emergency, providing an additional 1500 pounds of buoyancy.|$|E
2500|$|The Russian psychic Alla Vinogradova {{was said}} {{to be able to move}} objects without {{touching}} them on transparent <b>acrylic</b> <b>plastic</b> or a plexiglass sheet.

50|$|Dee's Drive-In {{was famous}} for the large clown marquee outside each {{drive-in}} with the title Dee's Hamburgers. The clown was brightly colored and had a large round belly, and would hold four large balloons, each one spelling out a fast food item for sale inside the restaurant. The original clown was designed by Paul Jensen of Salt Lake City. As an added attention-getting device, the clown marquee rocked back and forth. The marquee was designed in 1968 by the Young Electric Sign Company and manufactured using Plexiglas, <b>acrylic</b> <b>plastics</b> and flashing lights.|$|R

2500|$|Counterfeit coins {{are made}} by {{different}} processes including casting, stamping, electrotyping, and copying with a pantograph or spark erosion. In a 2009 survey, 99% of fake £1 coins found in cash centres were made of a nickel-brass, of which three fifths contained some lead and a fifth were of a very similar alloy to that used by the Royal Mint. [...] The remaining 1% were made of simple copper-zinc brass, or lead or tin, or both. Those made of lead or tin may have a gold-coloured coating; counterfeits made of <b>acrylic</b> <b>plastic</b> containing metal powder to increase weight have occasionally been found.|$|E
2500|$|The first in-socket {{artificial}} {{eyes were}} made of gold with colored enamel, later evolving into the use of glass (thus the name [...] "glass eye") by the Venetians in the later part of the sixteenth century. These were crude, uncomfortable, and fragile and the production methodology remained known only to Venetians {{until the end of}} the 18th century, when Parisians took over as the center for artificial eye-making. But the center shifted again, this time to Germany because of their superior glass blowing techniques. Shortly following the introduction of the art of glass eye-making to the United States, German goods became unavailable because of World War II. As a result, the US instead made artificial eyes from <b>acrylic</b> <b>plastic.</b>|$|E
2500|$|In late 1969 Elliot Berman joined Exxon's {{task force}} which {{was looking for}} {{projects}} 30 {{years in the future}} and in April 1973 he founded Solar Power Corporation, a wholly owned subsidiary of Exxon at that time. The group had concluded that electrical power would be much more expensive by 2000, and felt that this increase in price would make alternative energy sources more attractive. He conducted a market study and concluded that a price per watt of about $20/watt would create significant demand. The team eliminated the steps of polishing the wafers and coating them with an anti-reflective layer, relying on the rough-sawn wafer surface. The team also replaced the expensive materials and hand wiring used in space applications with a printed circuit board on the back, <b>acrylic</b> <b>plastic</b> on the front, and silicone glue between the two, [...] "potting" [...] the cells. Solar cells could be made using cast-off material from the electronics market. By 1973 they announced a product, and SPC convinced Tideland Signal to use its panels to power navigational buoys, initially for the U.S. Coast Guard.|$|E

40|$|Inorganic anions such as chloride, fluoride, and {{phosphate}} {{continue to}} be extensively used as food additives, drugs, and agricultural fertilizers. Cyanide has common industrial use as a raw material {{in the production of}} organic chemicals and polymers such as nitriles, nylon, and <b>acrylic</b> <b>plastics.</b> 1 Cyanide is also critical to the gold-extraction process. 2 Thus, the widespread application of cyanide raises a number of environmental concerns, particularly in terms of its retention in leech circuits, recovery, and potential for contamination. 2 These issues necessitate the development of sensor molecules that can adequately detect these anions in a variety of settings. Optical sensors for anions have recently received considerable attention, focused mainly upon the supramolecular chemistry of receptor design. 3 The binding event is typically monitored by changes in color, fluorescence intensity, or both from a chromophor...|$|R
5000|$|The {{principal}} application, consuming approximately 75% of the MMA, is {{the manufacture}} of polymethyl methacrylate <b>acrylic</b> <b>plastics</b> (PMMA). Methyl methacrylate is also used {{for the production of}} the co-polymer methyl methacrylate-butadiene-styrene (MBS), used as a modifier for PVC. Another application is as cement used in total hip replacements as well as total knee replacements. Used as the [...] "grout" [...] by orthopedic surgeons to make the bone inserts fix into bone, it greatly reduces post-operative pain from the insertions but has a finite lifespan. Typically the lifespan of methylmethacrylate as bone cement is 20 years before revision surgery is required. Cemented implants are usually only done in elderly populations that require more immediate short term replacements. In younger populations, cementless implants are used because their lifespan is considerably longer. [...] Also used in fracture repair in small exotic animal species using internal fixation.|$|R

40|$|Microbial {{fermentation}} {{of renewable}} feedstocks into plastic monomers can decrease our fossil dependence and reduce global CO 2 emissions. 3 -Hydroxypropionic acid (3 HP) {{is a potential}} chemical building block for sustainable production of superabsorbent polymers and <b>acrylic</b> <b>plastics.</b> With the objective of developing Saccharolnyces cerevisiae as an efficient cell factory for high-level production of 3 HP, we identified the beta-alanine biosynthetic route as the most economically attractive according to the metabolic modeling. We engineered and optimized a synthetic pathway for de novo biosynthesis of beta-alanine and its subsequent conversion into 3 HP using a novel beta-alanine-pyruvate aminotransferase discovered in Bacillus cereus. The final strain produced 3 HP at a titer of 13. 7 +/- 0. 3 g L- 1 with a 0. 14 +/- 0. 0 C-mol C-mol(- 1) yield on glucose in 80 h in controlled fed-batch fermentation in mineral medium at pH 5, and this work therefore lays the basis for developing a process for biological 3 HP production...|$|R
