5|$|On 17 March 1773, Edgeworth's {{first wife}} Anna Maria Elers {{gave birth to}} their fifth child, Anna Maria Edgeworth, {{at the age of}} 29. Ten days later she died from puerperal fever. Edgeworth was still in Lyon to avoid temptation leaving his {{expectant}} wife in the care of Day. On learning of the death of his wife, Edgeworth travelled to London, where he consulted Day as to Honora Sneyd's situation. On learning that she remained in good health and unattached, he promptly headed to Lichfield to see Honora at the Sneyds, with the intention of proposing. His offer was accepted immediately, and {{there was no mention of}} the conventional waiting period before remarrying after widowhood. <b>Although</b> <b>Mr.</b> Sneyd was opposed to his daughter's marriage, the couple were married at Lichfield Cathedral on 17 July 1773, officiated by Canon Thomas Seward, Anna Seward being a bridesmaid. After marrying, problems with the Edgeworth family estates in Ireland required the couple to immediately move to Edgeworthstown, County Longford in Ireland.|$|E
5|$|One of the {{two main}} event matches came next, as Randy Savage defended the WWF World Heavyweight Championship against the Ultimate Warrior. <b>Although</b> <b>Mr.</b> Perfect had claimed {{that he would be}} in the corner of one of the competitors, he did not come to ringside for the {{beginning}} of the match. Savage and the Warrior traded the advantage back and forth, with Savage performing several clotheslines and punching his opponent and the Ultimate Warrior countering with atomic drops. Savage executed two double axe handles from the top rope, but the Warrior caught him when Savage attempted the move a third time. After the Warrior missed a move and fell outside the ring, Savage jumped from the top rope and performed another double axe handle. Once the wrestlers got back into the ring, Ric Flair and Mr. Perfect walked down the aisle and stood at ringside. The match continued as normal until Perfect reached into the ring and tripped Savage, who was running to gain momentum for a maneuver. The Ultimate Warrior accidentally threw Savage into referee Earl Hebner. As a result of the ref bump, Hebner was not able to make the three-count when Savage pinned the Warrior after performing a diving elbow drop. Perfect and Flair revived the Ultimate Warrior, only to attack him when he stood up. The Warrior recovered and attempted a running splash, but Flair hit him with a chair. Savage saw the Warrior injured and realized that Flair and Perfect were causing trouble rather than trying to help either man. In retaliation, Savage jumped off the top rope to attack Flair, but Flair hit him in the leg with a chair. Savage was unable {{to get back into the}} ring, so the Ultimate Warrior won the match via countout. Flair and Perfect continued to attack Savage until the Warrior chased them away. Savage and the Ultimate Warrior then hugged and walked backstage together.|$|E

25|$|Mr. Trowbridge {{returned}} from the school {{to say that the}} only hope for safety to any Americans seemed to be to return to the school, staying there alone, separated from the Armenians. He declared that we were powerless to save the Armenians. It seems that after we left the school, Miss Wallace, Mr. Chambers, and a young Armenian preacher attempted to cross the street from Miss Wallace's to the school. Just at this time a mob rushed around the corner. The infuriated Turks recognized the preacher as an Armenian, and <b>although</b> <b>Mr.</b> Chambers threw his arms about him and did all in his power to save the man's life, they shot him dead. Not a single Armenian would they leave alive, the assassins shouted, as Mr. Chambers dragged the murdered preacher into the building.|$|E
25|$|Uyesugi {{pleaded not}} guilty by reason of {{insanity}} and claimed that he felt like an outcast at work and that he feared his colleagues were conspiring to have him fired. Dr. Park Dietz and Dr. Daryl Matthews testified for the defense that he was insane, citing the delusions about how others were tampering with his fish. Lead prosecution expert witness Dr. Harold Hall testified that the Defendant fulfilled the criteria for a diagnosis of schizophrenia, but he did not meet the criteria for either insanity or extreme emotion or mental disturbance (EMED). Dr. Michael Welner testified for the prosecution that <b>although</b> <b>Mr.</b> Uyesugi was in his opinion a schizophrenic, he carried out the shooting because he was angry that he would be fired for insubordination, and that his own account of concealment before the crime demonstrated that he knew what he had done was wrong.|$|E
500|$|Kutzer {{thinks the}} tale has a [...] "nightmarish quality". Poor Mrs. Tittlemouse cannot keep {{one step ahead}} of the various intruders. Although the house is her own, she has no control over who inhabits it: she finds bees nesting in an empty {{storeroom}} and woodlice hiding in the plate rack. She is trapped in her own home, her hours occupied with fighting off invaders from without to the point where she is sure she will [...] "go distracted". <b>Although</b> <b>Mr.</b> Jackson drives the unwanted intruders away, he leaves behind a mess of honey smears, moss, thistledown, and dirty footprints that Mrs. Tittlemouse invests two weeks of her life into cleaning up.|$|E

500|$|<b>Although</b> <b>Mr.</b> Dooley {{would become}} {{famous for his}} {{commentary}} on national affairs, the columns of the first years were generally more local in scope. Through the lips of Dooley, Dunne built a detailed view of Bridgeport, a vibrant community with its own idiosyncrasies and with important local figures. According to historian Charles Fanning, this made Bridgeport [...] "the most solidly realized ethnic neighborhood in nineteenth-century American literature". In the first year, {{less than half of}} the columns were political in nature, but this proportion increased as Dunne used Dooley as a weapon for reform of the corrupt city council; according to Dunne's biographer, Elmer Ellis, [...] "over the eight years from 1892 to 1900 there was no single force for improvement more important than the Dooley essays". Dunne depicted Bridgeport as a community whose Irish nature is on the verge of dissolution as other ethnic groups move in, an evolution to which Dooley reacts in various ways ranging from resignation to near-panic.|$|E
500|$|Norris Yates, in his The American Humorist (1964), {{argued that}} Dooley is entirely reliant on the papers for information, and has {{understood}} them badly. He wrote that Mr. Dooley {{is intended to}} be the opposite of the well-informed citizen sought by the Progressive Movement, and that his comments contain more truth than he knows. John O. Rees, in his journal article on Mr. Dooley, suggested that the barkeeper is intended to act in full awareness of how fantastic his words can be; he is expanding on what he has seen in the papers, turning it into a pointed story for the entertainment and edification of Hennessy, and himself. Dooley's apparent misrenderings of the literary quotations Hogan has supposedly regaled him with are, most frequently, too pointed to be mere muddling from the uneducated mind, for example alluding to Gray's Elegy in stating, while discussing high-society gossip, [...] "No one wants to hear what Hogan calls, 'The short and simple scandals of the poor'." [...] <b>Although</b> <b>Mr.</b> Dooley claims not to read books, this is not true as he reviews at least two, Roosevelt's tale of his time in Cuba and Sinclair's The Jungle. Occasionally Hennessy is fooled into believing what Dooley has spoken is literally so, forcing the publican to explain to his customer that what he has said was [...] "a joke. I med it up." ...|$|E
500|$|Hard Target {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} on its initial release praising the film's action scenes but noting the poor story and Jean-Claude Van Damme's acting abilities. On the film review television show Siskel & Ebert, Roger Ebert stated that Hard Target is [...] "not very smart and it's not very original, {{but it is}} well made on a technical level. The stunts are impressive... as an action picture, it's well made, but it never becomes more than competent action and I just can't recommend it for that". Gene Siskel also gave the film a thumbs down on the show stating that [...] "John Woo is a good filmmaker... Van Damme is pretty wooden... You notice the style in the film because {{there is not much}} substance". Janet Maslin of The New York Times wrote that [...] "Van Damme has still not broken the habit of his own blank-faced posturing, <b>although</b> <b>Mr.</b> Woo films him in the most aggrandizing style imaginable". In Variety, Emanuel Levy wrote that Hard Target was [...] "a briskly vigorous, occasionally brilliant actioner starring Jean-Claude Van Damme. However, hampered by a B-script with flat, standard characters, and subjected to repeated editing of the violent sequences to win an R rating, pic doesn't bear the unique vision on display in Woo's recent [...] "The Killer" [...] and [...] "Hard-Boiled." [...] Van Damme and the director's reputation should ensure initial commercial kick on the way to solid if not spectacular box office". Desson Thompson of The Washington Post wrote that [...] "When Van Damme isn't duking it out with the English language, scriptwriter Chuck Pfarrer is filling Henriksen's mouth with villainous pseudo-profundities. Even in a second-rate action picture like this, and despite Henriksen's commendable efforts, they're painful to listen to... Woo's creative presence is practically stifled. There are some flashes of his deliriously wild style—a slow-motion moment here, a well-chosen freeze-frame there. He also introduces American audiences to his taste for unique motorcycle stunts and very, very loud car explosions. But these Wooisms are disappointingly minimal". Lance Henriksen received a Saturn Award for Best Supporting Actor for his portrayal of Emil Fouchon in the film. In 1997, Woo looked back on Hard Target stating that it was [...] "in some ways, quite a troublesome movie to make, but I'm rather happy with the way the action scenes turned out". Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of [...] "B" [...] on an A+ to F scale.|$|E

2500|$|A {{number of}} {{sketches}} for the Monty Python's Flying Circus television show (1969–73) were filmed {{on location in}} and around both Torquay and neighbouring Paignton. It was while staying in Torquay at the Gleneagles Hotel with the Python team in 1971, that John Cleese found inspiration (and the setting, although not the actual film location) for the popular sitcom Fawlty Towers (1975, 1979). Incidents during the Pythons' stay are said to include the owner, Donald Sinclair, having thrown Eric Idle's suitcase {{out of the window}} thinking it was a bomb. Cleese later described the eccentric owner as, [...] "the most wonderfully rude man I have ever met", <b>although</b> <b>Mr.</b> Sinclair's widow has since said her husband was totally misrepresented in the comedy.|$|E

2500|$|Diagnostic modalities, {{dependent}} on circumstances, include X-ray, MRI, MR arthrography, double-contrast arthrography, and ultrasound. <b>Although</b> <b>MR</b> arthrography is currently considered the gold standard, ultrasound {{may be most}} cost-effective. [...] Usually, a tear will be undetected by X-ray, although bone spurs, which can impinge upon the rotator cuff tendons, may be visible. [...] Such spurs suggest chronic severe rotator cuff disease. [...] Double-contrast arthrography involves injecting contrast dye into the shoulder joint to detect leakage out of the injured rotator cuff [...] and its value {{is influenced by the}} experience of the operator. The most common diagnostic tool is magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), which can sometimes indicate the size of the tear, as well as its location within the tendon. [...] Furthermore, MRI enables the detection or exclusion of complete rotator cuff tears with reasonable accuracy and is also suitable to diagnose other pathologies of the shoulder joint.|$|E
