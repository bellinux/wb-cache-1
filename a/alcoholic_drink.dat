5|$|Beer is {{considered}} to be a social lubricant in many societies and is consumed in countries all over the world. There are breweries in Middle Eastern countries such as Syria, and in some African countries. Sales of beer are four times those of wine, which is the second most popular <b>alcoholic</b> <b>drink.</b>|$|E
5|$|Arak is a Levantine {{alcoholic}} spirit (~40–63% Alc. Vol./~80–126 proof) {{from the}} anis drinks family, common in Israel {{and throughout the}} Middle East. It is a clear, colorless, unsweetened anise-flavored distilled <b>alcoholic</b> <b>drink</b> (also labeled as an Apéritif). It is often served neat or mixed with ice and water, which creates a reaction turning the liquor a milky-white colour. It is sometimes also mixed with grapefruit juice to create a cocktail known as 'Arak eshkoliyyot', literally 'Arak grapefruit'.|$|E
5|$|In many societies, beer is {{the most}} popular <b>alcoholic</b> <b>drink.</b> Various social traditions and {{activities}} are associated with beer drinking, such as playing cards, darts, or other pub games; attending beer festivals; engaging in zythology (the study of beer); visiting a series of pubs in one evening; visiting breweries; beer-oriented tourism; or rating beer. Drinking games, such as beer pong, are also popular. A relatively new profession is that of the beer sommelier, who informs restaurant patrons about beers and food pairings.|$|E
50|$|For example, {{the total}} UK {{consumer}} expenditure on food in 2014, {{which is the}} Total Addressable Market of food market is £198 billion (including catering, <b>alcoholic</b> <b>drinks,</b> non-alcoholic drinks and other foods). The Serviceable Available Market for <b>alcoholic</b> <b>drinks,</b> which producers of <b>alcoholic</b> <b>drinks</b> target and serve is £49 billion. Since the market for <b>alcoholic</b> <b>drinks</b> is not monopoly, the Share of Market for a company producing <b>alcoholic</b> <b>drinks</b> can never reach 100% of SAM.|$|R

5000|$|Universities have {{conducted}} studies {{to compare the}} outcomes of the consumption of regular <b>alcoholic</b> <b>drinks</b> and of caffeinated <b>alcoholic</b> <b>drinks.</b> The University of Florida surveyed 802 college students who had mixed alcohol and caffeine, and found they were {{three times more likely}} to leave a bar highly intoxicated and four times more likely to want to drink and drive than drinkers who did not consume <b>alcoholic</b> energy <b>drinks.</b> [...] Another study surveyed 697 students from Wake Forest University and found that the students who had consumed caffeinated alcoholic beverages were more likely to drink and drive, take advantage of someone sexually, or end up needing medical treatment. [...] From this perspective, it is inferred that caffeinated <b>alcoholic</b> <b>drinks</b> cause one to act in ways that would be less likely if one were drinking non-caffeinated <b>alcoholic</b> <b>drinks.</b>|$|R
5|$|On the airplane, Jack jokingly tells {{a flight}} {{attendant}} named Cindy (Kimberley Joseph) that his <b>alcoholic</b> <b>drink</b> is not strong, and {{she gives him a}} stronger one. Charlie runs by while being called after by flight attendants before turbulence shakes the plane, scaring Rose, who is sitting across from Jack. The two talk, and Rose mentions that her husband is in the bathroom. The plane gets exceptionally shaky, causing a man to hit the plane's ceiling and oxygen masks to fall.|$|E
5|$|A widely {{consumed}} liquor among Palestinian Christians, non-religious Palestinians {{and many}} less-stringently observant Muslims is Arak. Arak {{is a clear}} anise-flavored <b>alcoholic</b> <b>drink</b> that is mixed with water to soften it {{and give it a}} creamy white color. It is consumed during special occasions such as holidays, weddings, and gatherings or with the mezze. Beer is also a consumed drink and the Palestinian town of Taybeh in the central West Bank contains one of the few breweries in Palestine. In addition to regular beer, the brewery produces non-alcoholic beer for observant Muslims. The nearby town of Birzeit is also home to Shepherds Brewery.|$|E
5|$|The {{most popular}} <b>alcoholic</b> <b>drink</b> in Switzerland is wine. Switzerland is notable for {{the variety of}} grapes grown {{because of the large}} {{variations}} in terroirs, with their specific mixes of soil, air, altitude and light. Swiss wine is produced mainly in Valais, Vaud (Lavaux), Geneva and Ticino, with a small majority of white wines. Vineyards have been cultivated in Switzerland since the Roman era, even though certain traces can be found of a more ancient origin. The most widespread varieties are the Chasselas (called Fendant in Valais) and Pinot noir. The Merlot is the main variety produced in Ticino.|$|E

5|$|Beer is {{the oldest}} and most widely {{consumed}} <b>alcoholic</b> <b>drink</b> in the world, and the third most popular drink overall after water and tea. Beer is brewed from cereal grains — most commonly from malted barley, though wheat, maize (corn), and rice are also used. During the brewing process, fermentation of the starch sugars in the wort produces ethanol and carbonation in the resulting beer. Most modern beer is brewed with hops, which add bitterness and other flavours and act as a natural preservative and stabilizing agent. Other flavouring agents such as gruit, herbs, or fruits may be included or used instead of hops. In commercial brewing, the natural carbonation effect is often removed during processing and replaced with forced carbonation.|$|E
5|$|The first {{forms of}} art {{recognised}} on the Altiplano are petrographs and petroglyphs in various locations on the Altiplano, mainly {{at the rock}} shelters of the Bogotá savanna. El Abra, Piedras del Tunjo and Tequendama are among the oldest sites where rock art has been discovered. The Herrera Period, commonly defined from 800 BC to 800 AD, was {{the age of the}} first ceramics. The oldest Herrera pottery has been discovered in Tocarema and dates to 800 BC. Herrera art is also represented by the archaeoastronomical site, called El Infiernito by the Spanish. On a field outside Villa de Leyva, menhirs in the shape of aligned phalluses were erected. This site, the oldest remaining of constructed art, dated at 500 BC, formed an important place for religious rituals and festivities where great quantities of the <b>alcoholic</b> <b>drink</b> chicha was consumed. The evidence for festivities at this site are from a later date, already in the Muisca Period.|$|E
5|$|In {{temperate}} climates {{there is}} a sudden movement of sap {{at the end of}} the winter as trees prepare to burst into growth. In North America, the sap of the sugar maple (Acer saccharum) is most often used in the production of a sweet liquid, maple syrup. About 90% of the sap is water, the remaining 10% being a mixture of various sugars and certain minerals. The sap is harvested by drilling holes in the trunks of the trees and collecting the liquid that flows out of the inserted spigots. It is piped to a sugarhouse where it is heated to concentrate it and improve its flavour. One litre of maple syrup is obtained from every forty litres of sap and has a sugar content of exactly 66%. Similarly in northern Europe the spring rise in the sap of the silver birch (Betula pendula) is tapped and collected, either to be drunk fresh or fermented into an <b>alcoholic</b> <b>drink.</b> In Alaska, the sap of the sweet birch (Betula lenta) is made into a syrup with a sugar content of 67%. Sweet birch sap is more dilute than maple sap; a hundred litres are required to make one litre of birch syrup.|$|E

5000|$|In {{general the}} <b>alcoholic</b> <b>drinks</b> market in Philippines showed a {{dramatic}} volume growth in 2007 and beer {{was a large}} contributor to that growth. The major beer producer, San Miguel Corp, developed a strong marketing campaign to increase drinking by consumers in the Philippines. San Miguel Corp continued to be the leading player and the key manufacturer in 2007, with the smaller and emerging brewers trying to grab {{a share of the}} market. Domestic beer remained {{one of the most popular}} <b>alcoholic</b> <b>drinks</b> in 2007 and sari-sari stores and independent food stores continued to be the main outlets. There are also establishments that are called [...] "beerhouses" [...] which could be described as a cross between a bar and a restaurant. Consumption and sales of <b>alcoholic</b> <b>drinks</b> in the Philippines are projected to expand positively during 2008. With increasing disposable incomes, a young demographic population will evolve. This, together with the emerging influence of Western drinking and pub culture, will collectively act to positively increase <b>alcoholic</b> <b>drinks</b> in the country. In terms of types of <b>alcoholic</b> <b>drinks,</b> beer and spirits will continue to comprise the largest volumes.|$|R
