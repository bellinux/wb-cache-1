40|$|The authors {{consider}} efficient {{methods of}} amortizing actuarial {{gains and losses}} in defined-benefit pension plans. In the context of a simple model where asset gains and losses emerge as a consequence of random (independent and identically distributed) rates of investment return, {{it has been shown that}} direct amortization of such gains and losses leads to more variable funding levels and contribution rates, compared with an indirect and proportional form of amortization that “spreads ” the gains and losses. Stochastic simulations are performed and they indicate that spreading remains more efficient than amortization with simple AR(1) and MA(1) rates of return. Similar results are obtained when a more comprehensive actuarial stochastic investment model (which includes economic wage inflation) is simulated. Proportional spreading is rationalized as the contribution control that optimizes mean square deviations in the contributions and fund levels when the funding process is Markovian and the fund is invested in two assets (a random risky and a risk-free asset). Efficient spreading and <b>amortization</b> <b>periods</b> are suggested for the United States, the United Kingdom, and Canada...|$|R

Prefunding USPS's retiree health benefits began in 2007, and the liability is about half funded. In contrast, USPS funds its workers' compensation benefits on a pay-as-you-go basis, and the entire liability is unfunded. The largest unfunded liabilities, in order of decreasing size, are $ 48 billion for retiree health, $ 19 billion for pensions, and $ 17 billion for workers' compensation.

50|$|The Dominion Housing Act was {{the first}} major housing {{initiative}} in Canada. It was implemented in 1935 under Prime Minister Bennett for the purpose of responding to the housing shortage caused by the Great Depression. The government allocated $10 million to assist the DHA in providing mortgage assistance, as well as commissioning a study of housing needs in Canada. The act was administered through joint agreements between the Department of Finance and private lending institutions. The government provided borrowers with loans amounting to 20% of the value of their homes, in addition to the 60% which had traditionally been supplied by loaning institutions. The government also split the burden of defaults evenly with lending institutions, thereby enabling them to increase <b>amortization</b> <b>periods</b> and provide below-market interest rates. The Special Committee, which was commissioned to study Canadian housing, recommended that an independent agency be established for the purpose of administering the Act; however, the government didn't take any action to this effect. The DHA was abandoned in 1938, at which time it was replaced by the National Housing Act. Prior to its termination, the program supplied loans for the construction of 4903 homes.|$|R

40|$|Road {{transport}} {{has long}} been the dominant form of transport for freight and passenger movement throughout the world. Because most road projects require investments with long <b>amortization</b> <b>periods</b> and because many projects do not generate enough demand to become self-financing through some type of user fee or toll, the road sector remains {{in the hands of the}} public sector to a much greater extent than other transport activities. But governments throughout the world, including those of many poor African and South Asian countries, are commercializing their operations to cut costs, improve user orientation, and increase sector-specific revenue. There seems to be demand for toll roads in specific settings, but the problems met by many of this"first generation"of road concessions-from Mexico to Thailand-have given toll projects a bad reputation. Many mistakes were made, and tolling is obviously not the best solution for every road. Most of the alternatives aim at improving efficiency (lowering costs). But there are many ways of getting the private sector involved in toll roads, thus reducing public sector financing requirements for the sector. Understanding the context in which toll roads are viable is essential both for their initial success and for effective long-run regulation.

Quality of credit portfolios is directly linked {{to the quality of}} the projects that are used to generate them. This study assesses the quality of a non probabilistic sample of 213 livestock projects to which credit was granted by a financial institution in 3 consecutive years. Between 15 - 20 projects where obtained in each of the 12 regional branches covering the national territory. Fifteen different types of deficiencies where found. The most frequent deficiencies found were: the use of nominal interest rates, (100 %), omission to include production costs (44 %) including incomes from other activities (43 %), and high calving rates (25 %). The number of deficiencies per type of project was of 5. 5 in the case of enterprises dealing with double purpose production (beef-milk); 6. 3 for cow-calf production, and 6. 5 for pasture fattening. Results were highly significant for the deficiencies by branches and significant for type of project. No statistical differences were found in relation to the year of preparation. There are statistical differences (P< 0. 05) in deficiencies found between double purpose and cow-calf projects as well as between double purpose and pasture fattening. The exaggerated frequency of deficiencies, together with the fact that they were not detected by regular institutional supervision mechanisms, shows an obvious failure of these mechanisms but more over, it shows the possibility that these deficiencies are considered by the institution as â€œaccepted problemsâ€ or â€œunderstood valuesâ€, since there are other priorities regarding credit policies such as use of nominal interests rates, short <b>amortization</b> <b>periods,</b> etc. Credit, livestock projects, project quality., Agribusiness,...|$|R

This study uses a measure of high profitability (rank order of return on assets relative to industry peers) to identify oil and gas companies more likely to manage earnings {{during the period from}} 2002 to 2008. Two measures of discretionary accruals (total and current discretionary accruals), and a measure of discretionary depreciation, depletion, and amortization (DDA) were used as indicators of discretion exercised in reporting earnings. Data on oil and gas reserve disclosures was also hand-collected from Forms 10 -K to investigate whether managers use reserve estimate revisions to reduce reported earnings through increasing the annual depletion expense. Results suggest that both oil and gas refining and producing firms use negative discretionary accruals to reduce reported earnings.
