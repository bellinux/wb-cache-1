5|$|By {{the time}} Eline struck Mozambique, {{there was already}} {{incoming}} assistance from the international community, responding to the earlier flooding. Mozambique's president at the time, Joaquim Chissano, requested for additional aid after the storm struck, asking for $65 million for both reconstruction and emergency aid, and later increasing the request to $160 million. By the end of February 2000, various countries had pledged $13.5 million to Mozambique, well short of the required needs, but that rose to nearly $119 million by March 17. By March 4, 39.6 tons of various relief goods reached the country, to be distributed from the towns of Bilene and Magul. The supplies nearly overwhelmed the small airport at Maputo, <b>as</b> <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> distribution caused food to decay in the sun.|$|E
5|$|For {{many poor}} {{women and men}} whose work hours have {{reached the point where}} they cannot cut back on leisure time anymore to make time for {{domestic}} and paid work, work intensity is an issue because they often intensify their work time by doing two or more activities at once, such as taking care of children while cooking. Work intensity can lead to many negative health consequences, such <b>as</b> <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> sleep, stress, and lack of recreation.|$|E
5|$|In 1953, Robert S. Dietz and {{his colleagues}} first {{identified}} the swell behavior. It was suggested that the cause was mantle upwelling. Later work pointed to tectonic uplift, caused by reheating within the lower lithosphere. However, normal seismic activity beneath the swell, as well <b>as</b> <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> detected heat flow, caused scientists to suggest dynamic topography as the cause, in which {{the motion of the}} hot and buoyant mantle plume supports the high surface topography around the islands. Understanding the Hawaiian swell has important implications for hotspot study, island formation, and inner Earth.|$|E

5|$|In Suicide (1897), Durkheim {{explores the}} differing suicide rates among Protestants and Catholics, arguing that {{stronger}} social control among Catholics results in lower suicide rates. According to Durkheim, Catholic society has normal levels of integration while Protestant society has low levels. Overall, Durkheim treated suicide {{as a social}} fact, explaining variations in its rate on a macro level, considering society-scale phenomena such <b>as</b> <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> connections between people (group attachment) and lack of regulations of behavior, rather than individuals' feelings and motivations.|$|E
5|$|An individual's {{belief that}} an {{environmental}} claim lacks honesty {{can have a}} negative effect on attitude toward a brand. If, on the other side, the consumer grants credibility to the claim, the individual will behave more respectfully toward the environment. The problem in extending that credibility to a brand is that consumers interested in ecological products generally are skeptical of commercial advertisements. This skepticism is due to various factors such <b>as</b> <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> language, the absence of scientific knowledge necessary to interpret advertising meaning, and, in particular, the falsehoods and exaggeration of some advertising techniques. To resolve this problem, independent organizations may choose to guarantee messages on the environmental benefits of brands with environmental labeling systems sponsored by independent organizations. This practice tries to diminish perceived biases in environmental information by promoting standardization of the information with the aim of improving confidence in the evaluation of environmental benefits of products—all of which should positively affect the purchase intention.|$|E
5|$|Based upon data {{taken from}} the United States using these methods, cirrus cloud cover was found to vary diurnally and seasonally. The {{researchers}} found that in the summer, at noon, the cover is the lowest, {{with an average of}} 23% of the United States' land area covered by cirrus. Around midnight, the cloud cover increases to around 28%. In winter, the cirrus cloud cover did not vary appreciably from day to night. These percentages include clear days and nights, as well as days and nights with other cloud types, <b>as</b> <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> cirrus cloud cover. When these clouds are present, the typical coverage ranges from 30% to 50%. Based on satellite data, cirrus covers an average of 20% to 25% of the Earth's surface. In the tropical regions, this cloud covers around 70% of the region's surface area.|$|E

5|$|Development {{took about}} a year and a half, with the team aiming for as much realism as possible. Certain features, {{including}} multiplayer, were dropped. Over 15 million copies were sold, and ports for various games consoles were released, most in 1995. Theme Park received generally positive reviews. Reviewers praised the gameplay and humour, but criticised console ports for reasons such <b>as</b> <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> save or mouse support. The game received a Japanese localisation (in addition to normal Japanese releases), Shin Theme Park, released in 1997 for the Sega Saturn and Sony PlayStation, and remakes for the Nintendo DS and iOS, released in 2007 and 2011 respectively. Theme Hospital is Bullfrog's thematic successor to the game, and two direct sequels followed: Theme Park World (known as Sim Theme Park in some territories) and Theme Park Inc (also known as SimCoaster).|$|E
5|$|In the 1950s, the U.S. Congress, {{then the}} {{governing}} {{institution of the}} District of Columbia, undertook the Southwest D.C. urban renewal project, {{the first in the}} capital district and one of the earliest such programs in the nation. In 1946, Congress passed the District of Columbia Redevelopment Act, which established the District of Columbia Redevelopment Land Agency (RLA) and provided legal authority to clear land and funds to spur redevelopment in the capital. Congress also gave the National Capital Planning Commission (NCPC) the authority to designate which land would be redeveloped, and how. The RLA was not funded, however, until passage of the Housing Act of 1949. A 1950 study by the NCPC found that the small Southwest quarter of the city suffered from high concentrations of old and poorly maintained buildings, overcrowding, and threats to public health (such <b>as</b> <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> running indoor water, sewage systems, electricity, central heating, and indoor toilets). Competing visions for the redevelopment ranged from renovation to wholesale leveling of neighborhoods, but the latter view prevailed as more likely to qualify for federal funding. Original plans called for the demolition of almost all structures in Southwest Washington beginning in 1950, but legal challenges led to piecemeal razing of the area until the mid-1950s.|$|E
