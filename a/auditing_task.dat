40|$|Assessing {{the quality}} of {{industrial}} control loops is an important <b>auditing</b> <b>task</b> for the control engineer. However, there are complications when considering the ubiquitous nonlinearities present in many industrial control loops. If one simply ignores these nonlinearities, there is the danger of over-estimating {{the performance of the}} control loop in rejecting disturbances and thereby possibly overlooking loops that need attention. To address this problem, several techniques have been recently developed to extend the control performance assessment (CPA) of single input/single output linear systems to nonlinear systems. This article surveys these nonlinear CPA techniques and compares their performances using three case studies. These results can be used to guide control engineers to select the most suitable CPA techniques for their particular applications...|$|E

Because of its immense importance in both developed and developing countries, many recent studies noticed the need to enhance corporate governance in developing countries. Considering the case of Lebanon where corporate governance is not legally enforced, companies tend to neglect the importance of maintaining quality corporate governance. Several recent studies suggested the importance of existing interactions among the major components of corporate governance in any corporation and internal audits. This thesis seeks to explore the effects of corporate governance components’ on internal <b>audit</b> <b>tasks</b> in medium-Large corporations in the Lebanese financial sector. The results showed that corporate governance components affect internal <b>audit</b> <b>tasks.</b> When the components are considered separately, top management and audit committee are found to have significant influences on the internal <b>audit</b> <b>tasks</b> whereas internal <b>audit</b> <b>tasks</b> are less influenced by external auditors and board of directors.

40|$|Abstract: In Cloud Computing Public {{auditing}} on {{the integrity}} of shared data is very big issue, because the public auditing scheme will predictably reveal confidential information, and identity privacy to public verifiers. This survey, propose a new scheme called a novel privacy-preserving mechanism which supports public auditing on shared data stored in the cloud. In particular, this scheme takes advantage of ring signatures to compute verification metadata. The ring signature scheme is needed to audit the correctness of shared data. With this mechanism, {{the identity of the}} signer on each block in shared data is kept secret or private from public verifiers. Public verifiers are one who are able to efficiently verify shared data integrity without retrieving the entire file. In addition, this mechanism is able to perform multiple auditing tasks simultaneously instead of single <b>auditing</b> <b>task.</b> This survey shows the effectiveness and efficiency of our mechanism when auditing shared data integrity.

The aggregation and derivative properties of our model help the three stakeholders to maintain strong authentication processes. A CU sets its priorities, QoS requirements, and anticipate timeframe for the completion of each task within the provided services. If the CU is not satisfied with the agreed requirements, the model immediately would enable the CU to refer the issue of incorrectness and inaccuracy of the paid services to the CSP. This feature of our proposed scheme not only improves the CUs experience but also warns the CSP to keep updating the cloud services and maintaining the agreed QoS according to the service level agreement (SLA).|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{investigate}} whether expert knowledge developed for one <b>audit</b> <b>task</b> can be transferred to a different <b>audit</b> <b>task.</b> Knowledge transfer refers to the situation in which knowledge developed for one task will aid decision making performance in another task (Singley 2 ̆ 6 Anderson 1989). Transfer of knowledge occurs to the extent that common elements exist in the tasks (Singley 2 ̆ 6 Anderson 1985). This dissertation provides an analysis of the going concern judgment and the loan credit review judgment. An auditor is required to assess the financial viability of an individual firm in both tasks. The existence of this common element suggests that certain loan credit review knowledge may transfer to the going concern judgment. ^ The results of an experimental task administered to 60 in-charge accountants indicate that financial service auditors with loan credit review experience are more accurate than manufacturing auditors without loan credit review experience in their evaluations of 2 ̆ 2 substantial doubt 2 ̆ 2 made for the two firms in the novel industry context. For the two firms in the manufacturing industry context, there was no statistical difference between the accuracy of financial service auditors and manufacturing auditors. Moreover, the four evaluations of 2 ̆ 2 substantial doubt 2 ̆ 2 were completed by financial service auditors in significantly less time. Overall, these results suggest that certain loan credit review knowledge transfers to aid going concern decision making performance. ^ The results have both theoretical and practical implications. From a theoretical perspective, the results show that certain types of knowledge can be transferred across <b>tasks</b> within <b>auditing.</b> In so doing, this study is the first to identify such transfer within auditing (Davis 2 ̆ 6 Solomon 1989; Bedard 2 ̆ 6 Chi 1993). From a practical perspective, the results reveal one way that an audit firm can improve the utilization of its existing firm knowledge. There may be other situations where knowledge developed for one <b>audit</b> <b>task</b> will transfer and aid judgment performance in another <b>audit</b> <b>task.</b> Thus, these results may provide the impetus for future knowledge transfer investigations. ...|$|R

30|$|Auditors’ {{learning}} {{on the job}} and their choice of professional services jointly affect audit quality. The learning effect has a favorable impact on audit quality (Low 2004). While performing audits over time, auditors accumulate client-specific knowledge so that their posterior beliefs about clients are updated and become more precise. Bobek et al. (2012) pointed out that audit team communication, auditor–client negotiation strategy, and usefulness of prior auditing experience are significantly related to successful resolution of audit challenges. In addition, Bierstaker and Wright (2001) found that both ability and experience are determinants of performance on an ill-structured analytical review task and an ill-structured internal control <b>auditing</b> <b>task.</b> Ill-structured problems are routinely encountered in auditing. In order to solve an ill-structured problem, a problem solver must draw on experience, knowledge, and cognitive abilities. Vera-Muñoz et al. (2006) emphasized the importance to audit effectiveness of audit team members sharing knowledge and expertise with each other to affect a favorable audit outcome. Over time, auditors gain more client-specific knowledge, which is proportional to audit performance (Beck and Wu 2006). Auditor knowledge and expertise are also associated with superior performance in an audit (Nelson and Tan 2005). Also, experience affords opportunities to gain additional knowledge—which when combined with ability—positively affects performance (Libby and Luft 1993).|$|E
30|$|Task {{performance}} {{has been defined}} as work-related to three essential components of any task, namely product of the task, required acts necessary to perform the task, and information cues on which a person can base the judgment about the execution of the task. Stajkovic and Luthans (1998) indicated that self-efficacy is positively and strongly related to work-related performance. The relationship between self-efficacy and work-related performance is moderated by task complexity and locus of performance. Complex auditing tasks typically represent multifaceted construct with different implications for behavioral, information processing, and cognitive facilities of the task performer. Bandura (1986) pointed out that highly complex tasks require different skills necessary for their successful execution by placing greater demands on required knowledge, cognitive ability, memory capacity, behavioral facility, information processing, persistence, and physical effort. Bierstaker and Wright (2001) found that both ability and experience are determinants of performance on an ill-structured analytical review task and an ill-structured internal control <b>auditing</b> <b>task.</b> Ill-structured problems are routinely encountered in auditing. In order to solve an ill-structured problem, a problem solver must draw on experience, knowledge, and cognitive abilities. Therefore, professional development is a learning process that can promote personal growth, improve auditing skills, revolutionize working procedures, and increase auditing report quality.|$|E

30|$|Vancouver et al. (2001) found {{a strong}} {{correlation}} between self-efficacy and performance at the personal level of analysis. The strong positive relationship is the result of past performances influence on self-efficacy as described by Bandura (1986). Hoy and Miskel (2001) believed that the past work performance has {{a significant impact on the}} individual’s self-efficacy. The continuous success would definitely enhance individuals’ self-efficacy whereas the constant failures would create personal doubt and reduce personal self-efficacy. Since auditors accumulate knowledge and experience from clients to make professional judgments, auditing experience and professionalization can influence professional awareness. Professional judgment determines auditing procedures, and professionalization provides an advantage in client disputes. Nelson (2009) stated that a knowledgeable auditor can identify errors and process complex evidence. Moriarity (1979) found better performance by experienced auditors at bankruptcy prediction, which reflected superior ability of experienced auditors at auditing tasks. Cervone et al. (1991) observed that individuals with high self-efficacy learn more from feedback, respond more adaptively to decision environment, and overtime, are better able to translate their learning into performance. Therefore, to successfully resolve a challenge and complete an <b>auditing</b> <b>task,</b> the problem solver must draw upon experience, knowledge, and cognitive abilities. As specific knowledge is accumulated and more auditing skills are being developed, auditors become more likely to produce professional and comprehensive auditing reports.|$|E
40|$|Cloud service {{providers}} offer various facilities to their clients. The clients with limited resources opt {{for some of}} these facilities. They can outsource their bulk data to the cloud server. The cloud server maintains these data in lieu of monetary benefits. However, a malicious cloud server might delete some of these data to save some space and offer this extra amount of storage to another client. Therefore, the client might not retrieve her file (or some portions of it) as often as needed. Proofs of retrievability (POR) provide an assurance to the client that the server is actually storing all of her data appropriately and they can be retrieved at any point of time. In a dynamic POR scheme, the client can update her data after she uploads them to the cloud server. Moreover, in publicly verifiable POR schemes, the client can delegate her <b>auditing</b> <b>task</b> to some third party specialized for this purpose.
