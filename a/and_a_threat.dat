5|$|Many {{whites and}} some blacks were alarmed by MalcolmX and the {{statements}} he made during this period. He and the Nation of Islam {{were described as}} hatemongers, black supremacists, racists, violence-seekers, segregationists, <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>threat</b> to improved race relations. He was accused of being antisemitic. One {{of the goals of}} the civil rights movement was to end disenfranchisement of African Americans, but the Nation of Islam forbade its members from participating in voting and other aspects of the political process. Civil rights organizations denounced him and the Nation as irresponsible extremists whose views did not represent African Americans.|$|E
5|$|Most of the {{judicial}} system and legal codes of the Weimar Republic remained in use {{during and after the}} Nazi era to deal with non-political crimes. The courts issued and carried out far more death sentences than before the Nazis took power. People who were convicted of three or more offences—even petty ones—could be deemed habitual offenders and jailed indefinitely. People such as prostitutes and pickpockets were judged to be inherently criminal <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>threat</b> to the racial community. Thousands were arrested and confined indefinitely without trial.|$|E
5|$|Poaching is {{a serious}} problem in the country, {{particularly}} of elephants for the profitable ivory industry <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>threat</b> to lives of rangers even in the national parks such as Zakouma. Elephants are often massacred in herds in and around the parks by organized poaching. The problem is worsened {{by the fact that the}} parks are understaffed and that a number of wardens have been murdered by poachers.|$|E

5|$|The {{defeat at}} Bathys Ryax signalled {{the end of}} the Paulicians as a {{military}} power <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>threat</b> to Byzantium. Basil followed this success by a series of campaigns in the East against the Paulician strongholds and the Arab emirates. Tephrike itself was taken in 878 and razed to the ground. The remaining Paulicians were resettled in the Balkans, while a large contingent was shipped off to Southern Italy to fight for the Empire under Nikephoros Phokas the Elder.|$|E
5|$|While the FAN was {{supplied}} {{economically and}} militarily by Sudan and Egypt, Goukouni received the armed support of Kamougué's FAT and Acyl's CDR {{shortly after the}} beginning of the battle, and was provided with Libyan artillery. On 6 June, the FAN assumed control of the city of Faya. This alarmed Goukouni, and he signed, on 15 June, a Treaty of Friendship with Libya. The treaty gave Libya a free hand in Chad, legitimising its presence in that country; the treaty's first article committed the two countries to mutual defence, <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>threat</b> against one constituted a threat against the other.|$|E
5|$|Conflicts between Armenia and Azerbaijan first {{appeared}} in 2006, when Azeri media criticized the event's website for listing Nagorno-Karabakh as the birthplace of Armenia's first representative, André, as {{it was part of}} the Azerbaijan SSR at the time. Conflicts notably escalated throughout the 2009 contest: during the semi-finals, Azeri officials objected to the depiction of the Nagorno-Karabakh monument We Are Our Mountains during an introductory video for the Armenian entry. Armenia responded during the finals by displaying multiple images of the monument whilst presenting its results. Following the contest, allegations emerged that Azerbaijan's state broadcaster had tampered with its feed of the broadcast to censor the Armenian entry, and that the Azeri government was interrogating citizens who voted for Armenia, accusing them of being unpatriotic <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>threat</b> to security. Following an inquiry, Azerbaijan was fined by the European Broadcasting Union (EBU) for breaching the privacy of voters.|$|E

5|$|In 1934 Wodehouse {{moved to}} France for tax reasons; in 1940 {{he was taken}} {{prisoner}} at Le Touquet by the invading Germans and interned for nearly a year. After his release he made six broadcasts from German radio in Berlin to the US, which had not yet entered the war. The talks were comic and apolitical, but his broadcasting over enemy radio prompted anger and strident controversy in Britain, <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>threat</b> of prosecution. Wodehouse never returned to England. From 1947 until his death {{he lived in the}} US, taking dual British-American citizenship in 1955. He was a prolific writer throughout his life, publishing more than ninety books, forty plays, two hundred short stories and other writings between 1902 and 1974. He died in 1975, at the age of 93, in Southampton, New York.|$|E
5|$|The Second Republic was {{a source}} of hope to the poorest in Spanish society <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>threat</b> to the richest, but had broad support from all {{segments}} of society. Niceto Alcalá-Zamora was the first prime minister of the Republic. The wealthier landowners and the middle class accepted the Republic {{because of the lack of}} any suitable alternative. Elections to a constituent Cortes in June 1931 returned a large majority of Republicans and Socialists, with the PSOE gaining 116 seats and Lerroux's Radical Party 94. Lerroux became foreign minister. The government was controlled by a Republican–Socialist coalition, whose members had differing objectives. Some more conservative members believed that the removal of the monarchy was enough by itself, but the Socialists and leftist Republicans demanded much wider reforms.|$|E

25|$|Throughout the {{lifetime}} of the Third Republic (1870-1940) there were battles over {{the status of the}} Catholic Church. The French clergy and bishops were closely associated with the Monarchists and many of its hierarchy were from noble families. Republicans were based in the anticlerical middle class who saw the Church's alliance with the monarchists as a political threat to republicanism, <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>threat</b> to the modern spirit of progress. The Republicans detested the church for its political and class affiliations; for them, the church represented outmoded traditions, superstition and monarchism.|$|E
25|$|While fascism {{accepted}} {{the importance of}} material wealth and power, it condemned materialism which identified as being present in both communism and capitalism and criticized materialism for lacking acknowledgement {{of the role of}} the spirit. In particular, fascists criticized capitalism not because of its competitive nature nor support of private property, which fascists supported—but due to its materialism, individualism, alleged bourgeois decadence and alleged indifference to the nation. Fascism denounced Marxism for its advocacy of materialist internationalist class identity, which fascists regarded as an attack upon the emotional and spiritual bonds of the nation <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>threat</b> to the achievement of genuine national solidarity.|$|E
25|$|Opposition to Bosco and {{his work}} came from various quarters. Traditionalist clergy accused him of {{stealing}} the young and old people away from their own parishes. Nationalist politicians (including some clergy) saw his several hundred young men as a recruiting ground for revolution. The Marquis de Cavour, chief of police in Turin, regarded the open-air catechisms as overtly political <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>threat</b> to the State, and was highly suspicious of Bosco's support for {{the powers of the}} papacy. Bosco was interrogated on several occasions, but no charges made. Closure may have been prevented by orders from the king that Bosco was not to be disturbed.|$|E
