40|$|Cooperative {{communication}} {{is a new}} communication paradigm that allows multiple transceivers to collaborate as a cluster for data transmission, and such clustering could greatly improve the transmission quality due to cooperative diver-sity. For conventional cooperation protocols, each cooperating device uses orthogo-nal channels to relay different messages for mitigating co-channel interference and avoiding transmission collision, but doing so would significantly reduce the band-width efficiency. One way to tackle this issue is to use wireless network coding, in which different messages are smartly combined at cooperating devices to save the channel use for data relaying. Network coding has been widely used in wireline networks, but only until very recently was grafted onto the wireless networks. In the research community, it has been unknown {{for a long time}} whether network-coded cooperation is able to achieve the same diversity gain as the conventional diversity technique. On the industry side, how to efficiently apply network coding in the current wireless systems has also been an open design problem in the past few years.

40|$|This {{research}} is {{an investigation into}} a creative and technical 'pixel' element that may facilitate Urban Digital Media, a field that inhabits the intersection between architecture, information and culture {{in the arena of}} technology and building. It asks how contemporary requirements of public space in our everyday life, such as adaptability, new modes of communication and transformative environments that offer flexibility for future needs and uses, can be addressed by a new form of public display, assembled through the use of an advanced pixel, described as an interactive Polymedia Pixel with situated media device protocol. The weakness of many current media facades for building-scale interactive installation environments lies in the dearth of quality creative content and unresponsiveness in terms of potential human factors, richness of locative situation and contextual interaction (Sauer, 2004). Media facades have evolved from simple 2 D visual displays to 3 D voxel arrays for depicting static and moving images with a spatial depth dimension (Haeusler, 2009). As a subsequent step in this development, the research investigates a display that reacts to the need for empathetic and responsive urban digital media; integrates multiple modalities; smart energy-saving; and collaborative community engagement. The Polymedia Pixel, which is presented in its research and development in this paper, contributes to the evolution of building-scale interactive installation environments. The paper firstly discusses the attributes of the Polymedia Pixel in order to address the above mentioned weaknesses of public displays. In responding to these necessities, the prototype of the developed Polymedia Pixel with its technology is outlined. The Polymedia Pixel reserach <b>aims</b> <b>to</b> <b>addres...</b>|$|R

Machines designed to be capable of explicit social interaction with people necessitates employing the human frame of reference to a certain extent.

40|$|Abstract—Today, {{designers}} and engineers on collaborative design environments often work in parallel and independently using different tools distributed at separate locations. Due to unique characteristic of engineering design, interaction during product development {{is difficult to}} support. As the {{information and communication technologies}} advances, computer supported collaborative design (CSCD) becomes more promising. Nevertheless, a potential problem remains between the product design and manufacturing, which mainly lies on the geometric shape of products that exists inherent in mass-customization. Meanwhile, CAD/CAM technologies have their own authoring tools, which govern the use of independent language and format for expressing various features and geometry. This condition creates incompatibility and has significant impact to the product costs. This paper is <b>to</b> <b>addres...</b>|$|R

Approximately 795, 000 strokes are reported each year in the US, 87 percent of which are ischemic.

In this paper, we first compare the un-cooperative pulling of Web contents used by commercial CDNs with the cooperative pushing. Our results show that the latter can achieve comparable users' perceived performance with only 4 - 5 % of replication and update traffic compared to the former scheme. Therefore we explore how to efficiently push content to CDN nodes. Using trace-driven simulation, we show that replicating content in units of URLs can yield 60 - 70 % reduction in clients' latency, compared to replicating in units of Web sites. However, it is very expensive to perform such a fine-grained replication. <b>To</b> <b>addres...</b>|$|R
