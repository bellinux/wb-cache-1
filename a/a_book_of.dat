5|$|<b>A</b> <b>Book</b> <b>of</b> the Dead papyrus was {{produced}} to order by scribes. They were commissioned {{by people in}} preparation for their own funeral, or by the relatives of someone recently deceased. They were expensive items; one source gives the price of <b>a</b> <b>Book</b> <b>of</b> the Dead scroll as one deben of silver, perhaps half the annual pay of a labourer. Papyrus itself was evidently costly, as there are many instances of its re-use in everyday documents, creating palimpsests. In one case, <b>a</b> <b>Book</b> <b>of</b> the Dead was written on second-hand papyrus.|$|E
