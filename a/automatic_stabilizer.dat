25|$|The JG thus fulfils an {{absorption}} {{function to}} minimise the real {{costs associated with}} the flux of the private sector. When private sector employment declines, public sector employment will automatically react and increase its payrolls. So in a recession, the increase in public employment will increase net government spending, and stimulate aggregate demand and the economy. Conversely, in a boom, the decline of public sector employment and spending caused by workers leaving their JG jobs for higher paid private sector employment will lessen stimulation, so the JG functions as an <b>automatic</b> <b>stabilizer</b> controlling inflation. The nation always remains fully employed, with a changing mix between private and public sector employment. Since the JG wage is open to everyone, it will functionally become the national minimum wage.|$|E
25|$|The Great Recession {{had caused}} federal {{government}} revenues {{to fall to}} their lowest level relative {{to the size of}} the economy for 50 years, with tax revenues falling nearly $400 billion (20%) between 2008 and 2009. At the same time, safety net expenditures caused expenditures to rise considerably. For example, <b>automatic</b> <b>stabilizer</b> spending (such as unemployment compensation, food stamps, and disability payments, which increased without legislative action) ranged between $350–420 billion annually from 2009 to 2012, roughly 10% of the expenditures. This drove the budget deficit up even without any policy steps by President Obama, creating significant debt concerns. This resulted in a series of bruising debates with the Republican Congress, which attempted (with much success) to blame the President for the deficits caused primarily by the recession that began during the Bush administration.|$|E

25|$|One {{narrative}} {{for explaining}} {{the economic and}} budgetary performance during President Obama's tenure uses sectoral balances. By definition, a country running a trade deficit (capital surplus) and where private savings exceeds business investment (private sector surplus) must run a government budget deficit, as the three must net to zero. Both Martin Wolf and Paul Krugman explained that as the Great Recession hit, the saving (deleveraging) {{of the private sector}} significantly increased, while business investment declined in the face of reduced consumer spending. This created an enormous private sector surplus. Since the trade deficit did not change significantly, the offset was a large increase in the government budget deficit. The record drop in tax revenue and large increases in <b>automatic</b> <b>stabilizer</b> expenditures (such as unemployment compensation, food stamps, and disability payments) were the mechanism for much of the additional deficit and debt increases, even before new economic policies were implemented. The significant reduction in demand implied by the increase in the private sector surplus (i.e., consumers and businesses saving rather than spending or investing) created a severe recession.|$|E

30|$|The Great Recession has revived {{aggregate}} demand management policies. In particular, <b>automatic</b> <b>stabilizers</b> are praised {{since they are}} rule based and thus operate swiftly and symmetrically across the cycle. However, <b>automatic</b> <b>stabilizers</b> are not a result of macro design but {{the structure of the}} social safety net and the taxation system. The participation tax is a key determinant of the strength of the <b>automatic</b> <b>stabilizers.</b> Paradoxically, the disincentive effects of high participation taxes are often discussed {{at the same time as}} <b>automatic</b> <b>stabilizers</b> are praised. The paper considers the sources of <b>automatic</b> <b>stabilizers</b> and whether they (un)intentionally have been weakened via structural reforms to strengthen work incentives. It is considered whether it is possible to maintain strong <b>automatic</b> <b>stabilizers</b> without jeopardizing incentives via the design of the social safety net (workfare) or business cycle-dependent unemployment insurance. The criticism that <b>automatic</b> <b>stabilizers</b> may prolong downturns is also considered. Finally, it is discussed to what extent {{aggregate demand}} management policy can stabilize labour markets and, in particular, whether it is well targeted towards marginalized groups. Also, the potential sources of marginalization in the labour market are discussed.|$|R

30|$|<b>Automatic</b> <b>stabilizers</b> work by {{stabilizing}} {{private consumption}} and thus {{one component of}} aggregate demand. This implies that the specific effects of the <b>automatic</b> <b>stabilizers</b> in general are shock dependent. Two dimensions of shocks are important, namely {{the nature of the}} shock (demand or supply) and its persistence (temporary or permanent). In general, the optimal policy response depends {{on the nature of the}} shock, while <b>automatic</b> <b>stabilizers</b> in some sense “average” across shock types. 9 <b>Automatic</b> <b>stabilizers</b> do not distinguish between temporary and permanent shocks. Since it is possible to diversify temporary but not permanent shocks, this is important. The effects of aggregate shocks as reflected in the budget balance accumulate over time if shocks are persistent. It is an implication that <b>automatic</b> <b>stabilizers</b> can never be an “auto pilot”. If shocks are persistent, close monitoring and intervention are needed to avoid that public debt comes on an unsustainable trajectory; for further discussion, see e.g. Andersen (2005).|$|R
50|$|To Keynesians, {{unemployment}} insurance {{acts as an}} <b>automatic</b> <b>stabilizer.</b> Benefits automatically increase when unemployment is high and fall when unemployment is low, smoothing the business cycle; however, others claim that the taxation necessary to support this system serves to decrease employment.|$|E

30|$|The {{paper is}} {{organized}} as follows: Section  2 clarifies some key properties of <b>automatic</b> <b>stabilizers,</b> and Section  3 discusses their source {{and in particular}} the relation to participation taxes. Section  4 considers ways to strengthen <b>automatic</b> <b>stabilizers</b> without jeopardizing incentives, and Section  5 discusses whether <b>automatic</b> <b>stabilizers</b> can be a source of persistence in the labour market.

30|$|But what is {{the source}} of the <b>automatic</b> <b>stabilizers?</b> The size of <b>automatic</b> <b>stabilizers</b> is not a direct result of macro design but rather a {{by-product}} of policy choices in relation to tax, social and labour market policies. The <b>automatic</b> <b>stabilizers</b> are therefore the net outcome of the design of the social safety net and taxation schemes.

50|$|A {{progressive}} tax code {{is believed to}} mitigate the effects of recessions by taking a smaller percentage of income from lower-income consumers than from other consumers in the economy so they can spend more of their disposable income on consumption and thus restore equilibrium.

It also mitigates inflation by taking more money from the wealthiest consumers so their large level of consumption does not create demand-driven inflation.|$|E
30|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{both the}} source and role of <b>automatic</b> <b>stabilizers</b> and therefore how fiscal and labour market policies interact. The part of <b>automatic</b> <b>stabilizers</b> related to employment variations is shown to depend fundamentally on the participation tax. This brings forth the tight interrelation between distribution/insurance, incentives and macroeconomic stability. The policy dilemma is that increasing participation taxes to strengthen <b>automatic</b> <b>stabilizers</b> may worsen incentive problems, which naturally poses the question “are there any ways to mitigate this dilemma?” The paper discusses how to maintain/strengthen <b>automatic</b> <b>stabilizers</b> without jeopardizing incentives via {{the design of the}} social safety net (workfare) or by building business cycle conditions into it (business cycle contingencies). 4 A particular concern is whether short-run stability via <b>automatic</b> <b>stabilizers</b> is achieved at the costs of more sluggish adjustment and thus persistence in employment. Despite the virtues of <b>automatic</b> <b>stabilizers,</b> the fundamental question is what aggregate demand management can accomplish in a labour market context. Most macro analyses implicitly assume labour to be homogeneous, an assumption which is decreasingly accurate. 5 In particular, in relation to the risks of marginalization (long-term unemployment), aggregate demand management policies are not well targeted and more specific labour market policies may be called for.|$|R
40|$|The large {{volatility}} of GDP {{due to the}} economic crisis, particularly in transition economies, has brought the issue of <b>automatic</b> <b>stabilizers</b> back into the focus of economic policy. The vast majority of empirical literature in this field relates to the estimation {{of the size of}} <b>automatic</b> <b>stabilizers</b> in developed countries, usually based on macroeconomic data. On the other hand empirical literature on this topic based on micro data, particularly for transition economies, is limited. This paper provides an evaluation of the size of <b>automatic</b> <b>stabilizers</b> in one transition economy (Serbia), by combining tax-benefit simulation modelling based on micro data and econometric methods based on macroeconomic data. The results show that, in the case of shock, around 17 % of fall in market income would be absorbed by <b>automatic</b> <b>stabilizers.</b> Although the stabilizing effects of the tax-benefit system in Serbia are lower than in other European countries, the total size of <b>automatic</b> <b>stabilizers</b> is close to the average value in these countries, due to the higher elasticity of demand to income. The results also show that progressivity-enhancing income tax reform would only slightly increase <b>automatic</b> <b>stabilizers,</b> due to the large informal economy and the large share of agriculture in total households’ income...|$|R
30|$|We {{build on}} former work (see Dolls et al. 2012) which investigates the {{magnitude}} of <b>automatic</b> <b>stabilizers</b> inherent in the tax and transfer systems of 19 EU countries plus the US 1. We relate these estimates of <b>automatic</b> <b>stabilizers</b> to new information on discretionary fiscal stimuli. Our empirical analysis points to a robust negative relationship between these two pillars of fiscal and social policy. This suggests that policy makers may indeed have taken into consideration the strength of <b>automatic</b> <b>stabilizers</b> when they decided how much to spend on discretionary fiscal policy packages in the crisis. These results are interesting because they shed {{new light on the}} factors determining the fiscal policy response of governments to the crisis. Our findings have important implications for the ongoing policy debate about institutional reforms following the sovereign debt crisis.

Other factors like the initial budgetary position or the size of the shock in the country under consideration have to be taken into account.|$|R

40|$|We {{examine the}} effects of the economy on the {{government}} budget as well as the effects of the budget on the economy.

50|$|A {{booming economy}} tends {{to improve the}} budget deficit, as high levels of {{activity}} and employment generate higher tax revenues, while safety net expenditures (e.g., automatic stabilizers such as unemployment, food stamps, and disability) are reduced. Further, since GDP is higher, budgetary measures relative to GDP are lower. On the other hand, a slumping economy (recession) works in the opposite direction, as lower economic activity and higher unemployment reduce tax revenues, and higher <b>automatic</b> <b>stabilizer</b> spending occurs. The effects of the Great Recession were discussed in the background section. So a key to understanding {{the connection between the}} economy and the budget is employment.

30|$|<b>Automatic</b> <b>stabilizers</b> {{are widely}} seen {{to play a}} key role in {{providing}} income insurance for households and hence in stabilizing demand and output. The automatic action of tax-transfer policies was accompanied in most countries by discretionary action in the field of tax, social and labor market policy.

Therefore, especially for the recent crisis, it is important to assess the contribution of <b>automatic</b> <b>stabilizers</b> to the overall fiscal expansion and to compare their magnitude across countries. Understanding the relationship between <b>automatic</b> <b>stabilizers</b> and discretionary fiscal policy is crucial, because countries with larger <b>automatic</b> <b>stabilizers</b> have to rely less on discretionary fiscal stimulus packages, other things being equal.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} the stabilizing effects of Swiss fiscal policy. First, {{we find that}} the federation adopted a countercyclical fiscal policy in approximately 60 % of all periods observed. During recessions, fiscal policy was always countercyclical and therefore helped to stabilize the economy. In case of the cantons, fiscal policy was countercyclical in 55 % of all recessions. In recent years, there has been a trend for both the federation and the cantons toward stronger stabilization. Second, the two stabilizing instruments of fiscal policy, <b>automatic</b> <b>stabilizers</b> and discretionary fiscal policy are compared with each other. Over the last 50 years, <b>automatic</b> <b>stabilizers</b> have been expanded continuously, particularly on the federal level. We find that the impulse of <b>automatic</b> <b>stabilizers</b> is about twice as large as the one of discretionary fiscal policy.
