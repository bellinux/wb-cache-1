40|$|The <b>absorption</b> <b>profiles</b> of {{different}} types of nanocomposite thin films were calculated in the framework of an effective susceptibility approach. The approach is based on the Green function method and allows calculations of the optical properties of thin films with an inhomogeneous distribution of inclusions. Two different types of three-component nanocomposites were considered: nanocomposites consisting of two types of spherical particles of the same dimensions embedded into a dielectric matrix and nanocomposites consisting of core-shell particles embedded into a dielectric matrix. Both the partial concentrations of the spherical particles and the shell parts in the compound particles strongly influence the <b>absorption</b> <b>profiles</b> of the films. The influence of the film thickness on the <b>absorption</b> <b>profiles</b> for both types of nanocomposite films was obtained. (C) 2010 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinhei...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Leaf anatomy plays a {{functional}} role in propagating {{light through the}} leaf; palisade mesophyll {{has been shown to}} facilitate the channelling of collimated light deeper into the spongy mesophyll. Direct measurements of the propagation of diffuse light into the leaf, however, are absent. Using chlorophyll fluorescence imaging of leaf cross-sections, we measured light <b>absorption</b> <b>profiles</b> in leaves under direct (collimated), diffuse and low-angle monochromatic light. Low-angle and diffuse light was absorbed closer to the irradiated surface than direct light perpendicular to the surface. The shapes of internal <b>absorption</b> <b>profiles</b> indicated that leaves were influenced by the directional quality of the incident light. In addition, <b>absorption</b> <b>profiles</b> revealed that leaves were not simple light absorbing objects and that cellular anatomy influences the direction of light travelling into the mesophyll. These findings also suggest a mechanism for previously measured differences in leaf level photosynthesis under opposing light regimes...|$|R

The resulting ensemble of simulated profiles is qualitatively similar to those observed in HIRES spectra of 0. 4 < z < 1. 0 Mgii systems (Churchill, this volume). Additionally, we discuss the statistical contribution from satellite galaxies, which would be expected to contribute additional absorption subcomponents and are likely to have been more numerous at intermediate redshifts.

40|$|SUMMARY The Bethe-Bloch {{stopping}} power relations for inelastic collisions {{have been used}} to determine the absorption of electron and proton energy for models of graphite, epoxy, and graphite/epoxy composites. Electron energies from 0. 2 to 4. 0 MeV and proton energies from 0. 3 to 1. 75 MeV, the energies that exist in geosynchronous Earth orbit (GEO), were used. <b>Absorption</b> <b>profiles</b> due to inelastic collisions for monoenergetic electrons were determined for cured neat epoxy resin, pure graphite, and graphite/epoxy composites. Electron energy losses due to bremsstrahlung were determined from these values. The <b>absorption</b> <b>profiles</b> due to inelastic collisions for monoenergetic protons were determined only for the cured epoxy resin. Finally, the dose-depth profiles in a cured epoxy resin were determined for an environment of distributed electron and pro-ton energies that closely approximated the energy distribution in GEO.

40|$|We present OH and H I Zeeman {{observations}} of the NGC 6334 complex taken with the Very Large Array. The OH <b>absorption</b> <b>profiles</b> associated with the complex are relatively narrow (∆vFWHM ∼ 3 km s − 1) and single-peaked {{over most of the}} sources. The H I <b>absorption</b> <b>profiles</b> contain several blended velocity components. One of the compact continuum sources in the complex (source A) has a bipolar morphology. The OH <b>absorption</b> <b>profiles</b> toward this source display a gradient in velocity from the northern continuum lobe to the southern continuum lobe; this velocity gradient likely indicates a bipolar outflow of molecular gas from the central regions to the northern and southern lobes. Magnetic fields of the order of 200 µG have been detected toward three discrete continuum sources in the complex. Virial estimates suggest that the detected magnetic fields in these sources are of the same order as the critical magnetic fields required to support the molecular clouds associated with the sources against gravitational collapse.

High velocity (+ 200 to + 400 km/s), variable column density gas {{is visible in}} all IUE spectra from 1979 - 1992 in transitions of Si II, C II, Al III, Fe III, Si IV, and C IV.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of the present study}} was to check for the possibility to successfully predict individual in vivo dissolution / <b>absorption</b> <b>profiles</b> resulting from fasted administration of a diclofenac extended release pellet formulation. For this purpose dissolution profiles were generated with different dissolution setups using a set of media reflecting pH-conditions in the different segments of the gastrointestinal tract. Since gastric emptying of pellets seemed to be a critical factor for in vivo drug release, a set of different gastric residence times was screened in in vitro studies. Subsequently, in vitro release profiles were first directly compared with the individual in vivo <b>absorption</b> <b>profiles</b> and in a second step a mathematical model, which had been developed in a previous study, was applied to calculate predicted individual in vivo release profiles based on in vitro release profiles and individual gastric emptying. The comparison of predicted individual in vivo release profiles and individual in vivo absorption profilesshowed a high degree of similarity, thus confirming the suitability ofa set of different gastric residence times used in in vitro drug release testing. Additionally, obtained results indicated that a substantial part of variability of diclofenac <b>absorption</b> <b>profiles</b> can be explained by the variability of pellets gastric emptying kinetics...|$|R

At low current-densities, krypton's spectral-line output in the near-IR range is better matched to the <b>absorption</b> <b>profile</b> of neodymium-based laser media than xenon emission, and very closely matches the narrow absorption-profile of Nd:YAG. None of xenon's spectral lines match Nd:YAG's absorption lines so, when pumping Nd:YAG with xenon, the continuum radiation must be used.|$|E
40|$|The collision-induced 1 st {{overtone}} {{infrared absorption}} band of deuterium {{was observed at}} room temperature. The band was studied in the pure gas and in binary mixtures with argon and nitrogen at a path length of 194. 3 cm at pressures up to 800 atm. The observed <b>absorption</b> <b>profiles</b> of the band do not show any splitting of the Q branch and this indicates that {{the contribution of the}} short-range overlap forces to the intensity of the band is negligible. The enhancement <b>absorption</b> <b>profiles</b> of D₂-AR mixtures show only single-transition quadrupolar lines. But the enhancement profiles of D₂-N₂ mixtures, in addition, show the double transitions Q₂(J) of D₂ + S₀(J) of N₂, and double vibrational transitions Q₁(J) of D₂ + Q₁(J) of N₂ which occur on the low frequency side of the pure overtone band. Major contribution to the intensity of the <b>absorption</b> <b>profiles</b> of pure deuterium comes from the double transitions Q₂(J) + S₀(J) and Q₁(J) + Q₁(J) in the colliding pairs of D₂ molecules. Integrated absorption coefficients were measured and binary and ternary absorption coefficients were derived. [...] The observed enhancement <b>absorption</b> <b>profiles</b> of D₂-Ar and D₂-N₂ were analyzed by a computational procedure into their component lines to yield values of the half widths δs. The analysis of the profiles of D₂-Ar confirmed the fact that the contribution of the overlap forces to the intensity of the band is negligible. From the analysis of the pure overtone profiles of D₂-N₂, the contribution of the double transitions, Q₂(J) of D₂ + S₀(J) of N₂, to the intensity of the band was estimated. The quadrupole moment of the nitrogen molecule was obtained as 1. 14 ea²₀ from the ratio of the binary absorption coefficients of the band due to single and double transitions...|$|R

At low laser intensity, nonsaturated <b>absorption</b> <b>profiles</b> were measured to correct fluorescence reabsorption.

50|$|Xenon is used {{extensively}} {{because of its}} good efficiency, although krypton is often used for pumping neodymium doped laser rods. This is because the spectral lines in the near-IR range better match the absorption lines of neodymium, giving krypton better transfer efficiency even though its overall power output is lower. This is especially effective with Nd:YAG, which has a narrow <b>absorption</b> <b>profile.</b> Pumped with krypton, these lasers can achieve up to twice the output power obtainable from xenon. Spectral line emission is usually chosen when pumping Nd:YAG with krypton, but since all of xenon's spectral lines miss the absorption bands of Nd:YAG, when pumping with xenon the continuum emission is used.|$|E

The prominent systems are the - 140 km/s and the - 513 km/s systems. The - 140 km/s system has characteristically broad <b>absorption</b> <b>profiles</b> and is dominated by Fe II, Cr II absorptions. The - 513 km/s system has very narrow <b>absorption</b> <b>profiles</b> and is dominated by Fe I, V II and Ti II. Both systems have many lines with lower levels being well above the ground state. Moreover, the lower levels are separated by spin energies and we suspect there is population inversion. This indicates that the species are being pumped by stellar radiation.

50|$|The {{properties}} desired of CSSNCs {{when using}} them for biological applications include high quantum yield, narrow fluorescence emission, broad <b>absorption</b> <b>profile,</b> stability against photobleaching, 20 second fluorescent lifetime, and high brightness. High quantum yields mean that minimal energy {{will need to}} be put into the quantum dot to induce fluorescence. A narrow fluorescence emission allows for multiple colors to be imaged at once without color overlap between different types of CSSNCs. Having a broad <b>absorption</b> <b>profile</b> allows multiple CSSNCs to be excited at the same wavelength and thus, multiple CSSNCs could be imaged simultaneously. Having a 20-second fluorescent lifetime allows for time-resolved bioimaging. The utility of CSSNCs is that they can be a complement to organic fluorophores. CSSNCs are less susceptible to photobleaching, but less is known about them compared to organic fluorophores. CSSNCs have 100-1000 times the two-photon fluorescence efficiency as organic dyes, exemplifying their value.In the cases where CSSNCs are used in biological medium, the core is a quantum dot and the shell can be an organic molecule or biological ligands, such as a DNA, that are used for biocompatibility and targeting. The shell can also be an organic molecule to which a biological molecule is later conjugated, furthering the modularity of core-shell structure. The most popular core/shell pair used is CdSe core with ZnS or CdS shell, which improves the quantum yield and protects against photobleaching compared to that of the core material alone. The size of the CSSNC is directly correlated to the color of fluorescence, so being able to control particle size is desirable. However, it is generally unknown how the shell molecules, and salt concentration, pH, and temperature of the media affect the CSSNCs’ properties and remains empirical.|$|E
50|$|Solar {{spectrum}} at the Earth surface changes constantly {{depending on}} the weather and sun position. This results in the variation of φ(λ), QE(λ), α(λ) and thus the short-circuit currents JSCi. As a result, the current densities Ji are not necessarily matched and the total current becomes lower. These variations can be quantified using the average photon energy (APE) which is the ratio between the spectral irradiance G(λ) (the power density of the light source in a specific wavelength λ) and the total photon flux density. It can be shown that a high (low) value for APE means low (high) wavelengths spectral conditions and higher (lower) efficiencies. Thus APE is a good indicator for quantifying {{the effects of the}} solar spectrum variations on performances and has the added advantage of being independent of the device structure and the <b>absorption</b> <b>profile</b> of the device.|$|E
50|$|A {{ruby laser}} most often {{consists}} of a ruby rod that must be pumped with very high energy, usually from a flashtube, to achieve a population inversion.

Ruby {{is one of the}} few solid state lasers that produce light in the visible range of the spectrum, lasing at 694.3 nanometers, in a deep red color, with a very narrow linewidth of 0.53 nm. The ruby laser is a three level solid state laser. The active laser medium (laser gain/amplification medium) is a synthetic ruby rod that is energized through optical pumping, typically by a xenon flashtube. Ruby has very broad and powerful absorption bands in the visual spectrum, at 400 and 550 nm, and a very long fluorescence lifetime of 3 milliseconds. This allows for very high energy pumping, since the pulse duration can be much longer than with other materials. While ruby has a very wide <b>absorption</b> <b>profile,</b> its conversion efficiency is much lower than other mediums.|$|E
