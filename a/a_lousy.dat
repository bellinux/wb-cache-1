[...] Since Grohl's mixing console was not automated, at times four people—Vig, Grohl, Moulder and engineer James Brown—had to work simultaneously on the board, something Grohl found interesting because every song was done differently and [...] "even the mixes sounded like performances" [...] The mixes were tested out in the cars of the band members and Vig, as they felt that [...] "if it sounds good on <b>a</b> <b>lousy</b> stereo, it will sound good anywhere".|$|E

Don Cherry's passionate defence of the Canadian team led to a sharp increase in his popularity. Toronto Maple Leafs owner Harold Ballard had special gold medals made up for the Canadian team. Ballard stated that [...] "I believe the Canadian boys deserve the gold medal and I'm going to see to it that they get them.

500|$|Guitar Hero Encore: Rocks the 80s was {{released}} to generally lukewarm reviews and has received overall less praise {{than the first}} two games in the series. Most critics agreed that the game's $49.99 price point was too high, considering the reduced soundtrack. GameSpot criticized the amount of songs with regard to the game's price. The reviewer commented that [...] "thirty songs for $50 is <b>a</b> <b>lousy</b> value any way you slice it" [...] and the game [...] "feels like a quick and dirty cash-in." [...] The reviewer also commented that the soundtrack was [...] "eclectic," [...] but [...] "solid." [...] Other reviewers, including 1UP.com, IGN, and Electronic Gaming Monthly criticized the game for its musical selection. GameSetWatch compared the game to Lou Reed's Metal Machine Music, saying that the game is [...] "totally Harmonix's contractual obligation game" [...] due to the bare minimum of changes made from Guitar Hero II.|$|E
500|$|Over {{the first}} three days at Twickenham, Harrison had {{presented}} new compositions such as [...] "All Things Must Pass", [...] "Let It Down" [...] and [...] "Hear Me Lord" [...] for consideration; these and other [...] "numerous beautiful songs", music journalist Martin O'Gorman writes, [...] "received derision and disinterest from Lennon or heavy-handed interference from McCartney". On 8 January, Harrison debuted [...] "I Me Mine", a song inspired by the bickering and negativity within the band. It was met with ridicule by Lennon and an argument ensued between the two musicians, during which Lennon dismissed Harrison's abilities as a songwriter. According to Sulpy and Schweighardt, Lennon's resentment was most likely a reaction to Harrison's productivity throughout the sessions, since he himself was [...] "unable to write a decent new song". In addition, Harrison had been alone in voicing his objections to Ono's presence, telling the couple how, in Lennon's later recollection, [...] "Dylan and a few people said she's got <b>a</b> <b>lousy</b> name in New York".|$|E
500|$|The Swedish {{director}} Ingmar Bergman {{called his}} own film The Virgin Spring [...] "touristic, <b>a</b> <b>lousy</b> imitation of Kurosawa", and added, [...] "At that time my {{admiration for the}} Japanese cinema was at its height. I was almost a samurai myself!" [...] In Italy, Federico Fellini in an interview declared the director [...] "the greatest living example of all that an author of the cinema should be"—despite admitting to having seen only one of his films, Seven Samurai. In France, Roman Polanski in 1965 cited Kurosawa {{as one of his}} three favorite filmmakers (with Fellini and Orson Welles), singling out Seven Samurai, Throne of Blood and The Hidden Fortress for praise. The Italian director Bernardo Bertolucci considered the Japanese master's influence to be seminal: [...] "Kurosawa's movies and La Dolce Vita of Fellini are the things that pushed me, sucked me into being a film director." [...] German New Wave director Werner Herzog has cited Kurosawa as one of his greatest influences: [...] "Of the filmmakers with whom I feel some kinship, Griffith... Buñuel, Kurosawa and Eisenstein's Ivan the Terrible, all come to mind." [...] When asked to list his favorite directors, Russian director Andrei Tarkovsky cited Kurosawa as one of his favorites and named Seven Samurai as one of his ten favorite films.|$|E

500|$|Lennon's quote was {{featured}} in a 3 July article in The New York Times Magazine and provoked no reaction. In late July, when Datebook republished the interviews, editor Art Unger put Lennon's quote [...] "I don't know which will go first—rock 'n' roll or Christianity!" [...] on the cover. Also on the cover was a quote from Paul McCartney regarding America: [...] "It's <b>a</b> <b>lousy</b> country where anyone black is a dirty nigger!" [...] In Birmingham, Alabama, WAQY DJ Tommy Charles heard about Lennon's remarks from his coworker Doug Layton, and was immediately incensed, saying, [...] "That does it for me. I {{am not going to}} play the Beatles any more". Charles and Layton asked for listeners' views on Lennon's comment and the response was overwhelmingly negative. Charles later stated, [...] "We just felt it was so absurd and sacrilegious that something ought to be done to show them that they can't get away with this sort of thing". Al Benn, who was the bureau manager for United Press International News, heard the WAQY show and immediately filed a news report in New York City, culminating in a major news story in The New York Times on 5 August. Over twenty other stations followed WAQY's lead with similar announcements. Some stations in the Deep South went further, organising demonstrations with bonfires, drawing hordes of teenagers to publicly burn their Beatles records and other memorabilia.|$|E

Kenneth tells Tracy Jordan (Tracy Morgan) about this, but Tracy advises him to do <b>a</b> <b>lousy</b> job so that he loses the promotion. While giving a tour around the 30 Rock building, Kenneth does a terrible job, {{and as a result of}} his behavior, Pete is forced to dismiss him. At the same time, Jenna Maroney (Jane Krakowski) is shocked to see her boyfriend and Jenna impersonator, Paul (Will Forte), dressed as singer Cher. At Feyoncé (Susan Heyward) and Grizz Griswold's (Grizz Chapman) wedding, which is being held at the TGS set, Jenna is not amused that Paul showed up dressed as Cher, but is surprised that Paul is dressed as her on his left side and Cher on his right, and as a result, the two make-up. Later, at Grizz's wedding, Jack tells Liz that Carol is looking for her. Carol tells Liz that he would like to give her a chance so that the two can have a relationship. At the same time, Kenneth, who is drunk, gets on stage, and gives a ranting speech to his former co-workers, ultimately telling them that he loves them all and hopes that they get everything they want in life.|$|E
500|$|For {{the first}} series, {{interior}} sets were {{built at the}} Blue Shed Studios in Salford. Three directors and three film crews were used to film the six 50-minute episodes over 14 weeks from March to May 1998. Locations included an empty shop unit near Piccadilly station for the charity shop sex scene in Episode 3 and a Masonic Lodge for the gala dinner scenes in Episode 6. In the second year, the sets were moved to the Spectrum Arena in Warrington, where filming ran from March to June. The series featured the first location shoots outside Manchester; a short scene in Episode 2 featuring Bathurst was filmed over half a day in Blackpool; Bathurst, Norris and a small production crew filmed scenes in Paris for Episode 3; exterior location scenes of the characters on holiday in Episode 6 were filmed on Lindisfarne, though the castle interiors were shot at Hoghton Tower. The second series also featured more visual effects; in Episode 5 Adam dreams about being chased by a giant testicle (which was computer-generated) and in Episode 6 a fireworks explosion was supervised by pyrotechnics experts. The testicle dream scene drew mixed reaction. The Mirrors television critic Charlie Catchpole praised it but Robert Bathurst was critical: [...] "I hated that sequence. I thought it was really unfunny. It was <b>a</b> <b>lousy</b> prop and awful graphics and {{there was too much}} of it—it would have been much better if it was like a Monty Python foot come smacking down like that and get it over with. You couldn't keep up that surprise and hilarity for all the minutes it was on the screen." [...] By the third series, Cold Feets sets were permanently located on a Granada warehouse stage and were left intact between series. This meant the basic sets could be used on other Granada programmes, such as The Grimleys and My Beautiful Son. After the final episode was filmed in 2002, the sets were dismantled and taken to a landfill.|$|E

500|$|Wade Keller of the Pro Wrestling Torch Newsletter {{reviewed}} the show. He felt that Rhino versus Jeff Jarrett was [...] "not {{much of a}} main event, but it followed the old rule of having the replacement babyface wrestler in a main event always win so fans don't feel ripped off." [...] As for the Iron Man match for the TNA X Division Championship between A.J. Styles and Christopher Daniels, Keller expressed {{that it was a}} [...] "very good match" [...] that had a [...] "nice change of pattern with just one fall during the match, but ultimately the first two-thirds wasn't particularly exciting or engrossing enough to top their previous Iron Man match." [...] He {{went on to say that}} Styles and Daniels [...] "were great in the final minutes at conveying sheer exhaustion mixed with desire to win" [...] and that they [...] "had a tough act to follow with the stunt filled Monsters Ball." [...] As for the Monster's Ball match, Keller said it was a [...] "good one" [...] but it was [...] "tough to go to four stars for a match that includes so many huge spots and little long-term selling, but it's also hard not to rate it this high when there's a potential [...] "big spot of the year" [...] and a crowd chanting [...] "That was awesome!" [...] afterward." [...] Meanwhile, Keller felt the World Tag Team Championship match was [...] "average" [...] and that it [...] "just didn't feel like a major PPV title match." [...] "Just a highspot fest with <b>a</b> <b>lousy</b> ending. The highspots were good, but it was far from a standout Ultimate X match. The [...] "can't miss" [...] match just missed based on not fulfilling high expectations," [...] is what Keller had to say regarding the Ultimate X match.
