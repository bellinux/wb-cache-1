5|$|Agriculture is the {{economic}} foundation of most countries, and {{for developing countries}} a likely source of economic growth. Growth in agriculture can benefit the rural poor, though it does not <b>always</b> <b>do</b> so. Profits from crops can increase from higher value crops, better marketing, value-adding activities such as processing, or expanded access {{for the public to}} markets.Profits can also decrease through reduced demand or increased production. Crop diversity can protect againstcrop failure, and can also offer higher returns.|$|E

25|$|During Bright Week—the week {{beginning}} on Pascha (Easter Sunday)—the Holy Doors remain open the entire week, and whenever the priest or deacon enter {{or leave the}} sanctuary during services they <b>always</b> <b>do</b> so through the Holy Doors.

During negotiations, de Gaulle chided Britain for relying {{too much on the}} Americans, saying that sooner or later they would <b>always</b> <b>do</b> what was in their best interests. Wilson said he then gently raised the spectre of the threat of a newly powerful Germany {{as a result of the}} EEC, which de Gaulle agreed was a risk.

25|$|A sup (supremum) of X is a least {{upper bound}} on X, namely an upper bound on X that is less or equal to every upper bound on X. Dually an inf (infimum) of X is a {{greatest}} lower bound on X. The sup of x and y always exists in the underlying poset of a Boolean algebra, being x∨y, and likewise their inf exists, namely x∧y. The empty sup is 0 (the bottom element) and the empty inf is 1 (top). It follows that every finite set has both a sup and an inf. Infinite subsets of a Boolean algebra {{may or may not}} have a sup and/or an inf; in a power set algebra they <b>always</b> <b>do.</b>|$|E
25|$|This slide led to {{the first}} {{fatality}} at the park, a head injury suffered in 1980 by an employee whose sled ran off the track; he then fell down a large embankment and hit his head on a rock, which killed him. Hay bales at the curves were meant to cushion the impact of those whose sleds jumped the track (a frequent occurrence), but did not <b>always</b> <b>do</b> so effectively. According to state records, in 1984 and 1985 the alpine slide produced 14 fractures and 26 head injuries. While park officials regularly asserted its safety, saying that 90-year-old grandmothers could and did ride it, {{in the early years}} of the park the slide was responsible for the bulk of the accidents, injuries, lawsuits, and state citations for safety violations.|$|E

500|$|Other {{programs}} that undertake to parse Perl, such as source-code analyzers and auto-indenters, {{have to contend}} not only with ambiguous syntactic constructs {{but also with the}} undecidability of Perl parsing in the general case. Adam Kennedy's PPI project focused on parsing Perl code as a document (retaining its integrity as a document), instead of parsing Perl as executable code (that not even Perl itself can <b>always</b> <b>do).</b> It was Kennedy who first conjectured that [...] "parsing Perl suffers from the 'halting problem'", which was later proved.|$|E

500|$|According to Chad Meister, {{professor}} of philosophy at Bethel College, most philosophers accept Plantinga's free will defense and thus see the logical problem of evil as having been sufficiently rebutted. Robert Adams says that [...] "it {{is fair to say}} that Plantinga has solved this problem. That is, he has argued convincingly for the consistency of God and evil." [...] William Alston has said that [...] "Plantinga [...] has established the possibility that God could not actualize a world containing free creatures that <b>always</b> <b>do</b> the right thing." [...] William L. Rowe has written [...] "granted incompatibilism, there is a fairly compelling argument for the view that the existence of evil is logically consistent with the existence of the theistic God", referring to Plantinga's argument.|$|E

His financial situation was very likely desperate, as extortionists and other criminals who steal large amounts of money nearly <b>always</b> <b>do</b> so, according to experts, because they need it urgently; otherwise, the crime is not worth the considerable risk.

500|$|Gens' {{wife and}} {{daughter}} at first went to Kaunas but, after {{the formation of the}} ghetto, they returned to Vilnius and lived near the ghetto's perimeter. His wife used her maiden name rather than Gens'. According to Leonard Tushnet, there were unfounded rumors that the couple had divorced. Gens did not refute the rumors, as he thought they would help protect his family. Other sources state that the two were divorced to protect Elvyra and Ada. Elvyra Gens was opposed to her husband taking {{a leading role in the}} government of the ghetto and urged him to [...] "pass" [...] as a Lithuanian. It is not clear exactly why Gens went into the ghetto, but in a letter to his wife, Gens said [...] "This is the first time in my life that I have to engage in such duties. My heart is broken.

500|$|While {{brainstorming}} {{for ideas}} to the game's plot, Sakamoto decided to create an original story instead of remaking a Metroid game because he [...] "always [...] to do something really unprecedented, something people have never played before".

That's something I hope we'll <b>always</b> <b>do.</b> If you can challenge something new, you {{can look forward to}} the public response, be it good or bad." [...] The game introduces gameplay mechanics that are new to the Metroid series. Metroid Fusion offers a more direct, almost mission-based structure that supports the player to explore areas. Objectives are also flexible in how they can be completed, acting [...] "more as a guide for what the player should do instead of giving a completely blank map and saying 'Here you go, {{figure out what to do}} and how to do it.|$|E

The country was skipped {{for the next}} five tours until the singer {{released}} her thirteenth studio album, Rebel Heart (2015). To promote the album, Madonna announced the Rebel Heart Tour, and confirmed that she would be coming to Australia with the concert, as well as visit New Zealand for the first time. Before arriving in Australia, Madonna announced an extra show on March 10, 2016, at Melbourne's Forum Theatre. The show was billed as an intimate gig, and was described by the singer as a fusion of music, art and comedy. It was titled as Madonna: Tears of a Clown show and was created for the singer's Australian fans, who had waited for her to perform there for the last 23 years. During her promotional appearance at The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon in April 2015, Madonna confessed that she is a [...] "kind of closet comedian" [...] and did a skit on the show; she added, [...] "I <b>always</b> <b>do</b> extravaganzas, they always cost a billion dollars to make ... nobody makes any money ... and sometimes I dream about simplicity."

Usher once told MTV, [...] "He {{influenced}} me {{in so many}} ways, more than just music ..... as a humanitarian, as a philanthropist, as an artist, as an individual who transcended culture. I wouldn't be who I am today without Michael Jackson." [...] During the television special '', Usher was able to dance with Michael while performing [...] "You Rock My World". Prince being another main influence, Usher said [...] "every album I’d <b>always</b> <b>do</b> like one song that is very Prince-influenced, because he's a great influence on me musically, especially just kind of being expansive and creating music that represents many different genres." [...] In Time magazine's [...] "100 Most Influential People" [...] issue, he explained [...] "I was interested in music {{and trying to find}} a model. It was Michael, or it was Prince. He had an attitude, a rawness that Michael didn't have. He was not urban, but he was our version of what cool could be." [...] In addition, he has spoken of Marvin Gaye and Stevie Wonder as great musicians and philanthropists stating that [...] "they figured out what they were as they were going, by inspiration as well...allowing their music to speak to where they were and what they had to say". Other musical influences include Luther Vandross, Janet Jackson, Maze featuring Frankie Beverly, Al Green, and Boyz II Men.|$|E
500|$|After {{looking at}} agriculture, Cochrane {{considers}} {{the relationship between}} animals and genetic engineering. The question of whether an animal has a right not to be genetically engineered, he suggests, makes no sense, as live animals are not engineered, and embryos have no interests, so cannot have rights. Instead, Cochrane considers whether animals have a right {{not to have been}} engineered, arguing {{that it is not the}} case that they <b>always</b> <b>do,</b> and that if [...] "genetic engineering gives the animals lives with opportunities for well-being that are similar to or better than ordinary members of their species, then it is ordinarily permissible." [...] Cochrane then addresses four reasons to oppose this claim; first, the notion that genetic engineering instrumentalizes animals, second, the idea that genetic engineering is repugnant, third, that genetic engineering reveals a flaw in character (see virtue ethics) and fourth, that genetic engineering denies the dignity of animals. Cochrane finds none of these arguments reason to abandon the principle. Cochrane considers whether animals may ever have a right not to have been engineered. He argues that animals have a right not to be engineered such that they have lives not worth living. He then rejects some reasons for believing that animals have a right not to be engineered with diseases or disabilities, but concludes that they do, as engineered animals have an interest [...] "in having been engineered with sufficient opportunities for well-being", an interest which is strong enough to ground a concrete right. However, Cochrane argues that he is not advocating perfectionism, as he is concerned not with equal capacities between members of a species, but equal opportunities for well-being. Finally, Cochrane considers the possibility of engineering nonsentient, non-conscious livestock, arguing that, ordinarily, there is no wrong in engineering nonconscious entities.|$|E
