5|$|After {{his release}} from Bradford, Brandon spent {{a period of time}} {{training}} with Scottish-side Dundee United, although that was because he was visiting his friend and former teammate Danny Cadamarteri and would not be offered a contract, before he was offered a trial with Port Vale in July 2010. It proved to be an unsuccessful trial, with Brandon spending time <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>game.</b> He later held talks with Conference North side Guiseley, a non-league team from near Bradford. At the start of 2011, he signed for Thai Premier League side BEC Tero Sasana.|$|E
5|$|According to the NPD Group, Brütal Legend sold {{approximately}} 215,000 {{copies in}} the United States in October 2009, with about 150,000 copies being for the Xbox 360 platform, {{making it the}} 12th-top-selling game in that month. These numbers were {{not considered to be}} strong, and were attributed to the difficult marketing of the game, which emphasized Jack Black's involvement and the heavy metal nature of the game, but did not assert what the gameplay would actually be like, with the possibility that the mention of the RTS elements of the game would have possibly driven more players <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>game.</b> In an interview in February 2011, Schafer claimed that the game had sold over 1.4 million copies. According to data collected through Nielsen SoundScan, some songs contained within Brütal Legends soundtrack saw digital sales increases of up to 700% following the game's release, similar to the effects of Guitar Hero and Rock Band, though impact on overall sales of these songs was rather small.|$|E
25|$|As in all RPGs, {{the player}} assumes {{the role of}} a {{character}} (often in a fantasy world or science-fiction world) and takes control over many of that character's actions.

25|$|In 2012, {{despite being}} the proud {{owner of an}} Irish passport, Turner was still {{considered}} as an American under Basketball Ireland and Superleague regulations. Despite having accumulated over a decade living in Ireland and spending {{the vast majority of}} his time in Ireland, being married to an Irish woman and having Irish children, Turner was not allowed to compete in Basketball Ireland competitions as an Irishman. As a result, Turner stood down from his duties with Killester and took on Basketball Ireland's Superleague and its regulation which dictated that he must compete as a foreign player. Turner remained <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>game</b> and Killester for two seasons. During his absence, Killester missed the postseason in 2012–13 but managed to win the league in 2013–14.|$|E
25|$|Namath {{quickly became}} a star for the Jets. The team {{improved}} to 6–6–2 in 1966 and 8–5–1 in 1967, when Namath became the first-ever quarterback to throw for more than 4,000 yards in a single season. By 1968, Ewbank's team was {{becoming one of the}} top teams in the AFL. All of its main starters returned from the year before, and the Jets brought in All-Pro guard Bob Talamini from the Houston Oilers. The team started the season with a 3–2 record, but won eight of its last nine games to finish the regular season 11–3 and win the AFL East Division by four games. One of the Jets' losses in 1968 was a November contest against the Oakland Raiders that later {{came to be known as}} the Heidi Game. After Jim Turner kicked a field goal for the Jets that gave them a 32–29 lead with just over a minute left to play, NBC cut <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>game</b> to a scheduled broadcast of the children's movie Heidi. The Raiders went on to win the game by scoring two touchdowns in the final 42 seconds. Ewbank's wife Lucy called the locker room to congratulate him on the win, only to learn the team had lost.|$|E

Deciding that six-plus years had been too long since someone had won the top prize, producers conducted a tournament to find a third million dollar winner. For the first nine weeks of the 2009–10 season, each episode saw contestants attempt to qualify for what {{was referred to as}} the [...] "Tournament of Ten". Contestants were seeded based on how much money they had won, with the biggest winner ranked first and the lowest ranked tenth.

He played in five regular season games before needing season-ending surgery on his right knee. He averaged 5.8 points per game, 2.8 rebounds per game, and 4.6 assists per game in 24.4 minutes during the 2012–13 season. Roy was waived by Minnesota on May 10, 2013.

Computer and Video Games said [...] "Eorzea {{is a beautiful}} world with huge potential for vast adventures, but it's just a shame that this first voyage into {{it is such a}} mis-step". 1UP.com said that [...] "playing [...] is like playing with a toy stuck in a plastic bag: it can be fun for a while and you can get the general idea, but you can't appreciate the full experience", stating that future updates would likely rectify this issue. IGN said that [...] "Much of the promise of the combat system and depth of the crafting mechanics are drowned, unfortunately, under a sea of interface and performance issues that hinder the experience at nearly every step", further stating that while patches might improve the experience, its state {{at the time of the}} review made it [...] "not a world worth visiting". GameSpot, in addition to warning players <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>game,</b> said that [...] "Final Fantasy XIV is a notable entry to the genre but only for what it lacks".|$|E

[...] During the station break {{which began with}} the network announcement, Goodman called a BOC phone to which only he knew the number and which {{was not part of}} NBC's CIrcle-7 exchange (which blew a fuse 26 times in an hour). When Cline answered it, Goodman ordered him {{to go back to the}} game. Although Cline knew there was no way to reconnect the feed, he promised to do the best he could. By the time the game ended at 7:07, thousands of viewers were calling the network to complain about missing the end of the football game. Others called newspapers, television stations, even the New York City Police Department, both to seek the final score, and simply to vent. Humorist Art Buchwald wrote [...] "Men who wouldn't get out of their chairs in an earthquake rushed to the phone to scream obscenities [...]" [...] As people learned of the outcome, some became upset because Ridlehuber's touchdown meant the Raiders had won by more than the point spread of 7, and bets thought to be won were now lost. In Oakland, Gowdy and DeRogatis left the broadcast booth to tell Ellis that the final two minutes were the most exciting they had ever seen. Ellis replied, [...] "It's too bad America didn't see it." [...] Realizing that the original call had been lost, Ellis had the two sportscasters re-create their descriptions of the two Raider touchdowns on tape.|$|E
500|$|Williams {{was then}} {{confirmed}} {{to play against}} England at Swansea on 12 January in a team much changed from that which was beaten by South Africa the previous month. The London Express commented that neither he nor Maddock on the other wing, had much merit, but were selected {{for a lack of}} choice, the whole team being unexceptional. Welsh spectators, expecting defeat {{at the hands of the}} English, stayed <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>game,</b> and only 5,000 turned out, a record low for international rugby in Wales. But the headline in the 'Pink Edition' of the Evening Express read [...] "St George Routed", as Wales beat England 22–0. Right from the start, the Welshmen seemed up to the task. An early try-scoring opportunity was lost when Gabe was tackled and unable to make the pass to Williams, who was in the clear. Wales came close to scoring a few more times, until Gabe receiving the ball from Trew, timed his pass perfectly to Williams, and he scored in the corner. Most of the play till this point had been in England's 25, but when the English broke out, Williams' defensive play was called into action. At half time, with further tries from Gibbs and Maddock, the Welsh were leading 13–0. England started the second half well but, after a long period in the Welsh half, Wales got an attacking opportunity, and Gabe, receiving the ball from Trew, beat his opposite number, and passed to Williams, who scored a second try in the corner. Maddock and Brown then scored two more tries, for a total of six to Wales.|$|E
