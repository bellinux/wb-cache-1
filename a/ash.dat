5|$|Emerald <b>ash</b> borer {{primarily}} infest and {{can cause}} significant damage to <b>ash</b> species including green <b>ash</b> (Fraxinus pennsylvanica), black <b>ash</b> (Fraxinus nigra), white <b>ash</b> (Fraxinus americana), and blue <b>ash</b> (Fraxinus quadrangulata) in North America. In Europe, Fraxinus excelsior is the main <b>ash</b> species colonized by EAB. <b>Ash</b> susceptibility can vary due to the attractiveness of chemical volatiles to adults, or the ability of larvae to detoxify phenolic compounds. Emerald <b>ash</b> borer has also been found infesting white fringe tree in North America, which is a non-ash host, but {{it is unclear whether}} the trees were healthy when first infested, or were already in decline due to drought.|$|E
5|$|Young forests (trees <2 years old) {{are most}} at risk from <b>ash</b> falls {{and are likely to}} be {{destroyed}} by <b>ash</b> deposits >100 mm. <b>Ash</b> fall is unlikely to kill mature trees, but <b>ash</b> loading may break large branches during heavy <b>ash</b> falls (>500 mm). Defoliation of trees may also occur, especially if there is a coarse <b>ash</b> component within the <b>ash</b> fall.|$|E
5|$|<b>Ash</b> {{accumulation}} {{will also}} affect pasture, plants and trees which {{are part of}} the horticulture and agriculture industries. Thin <b>ash</b> falls (<20 mm) may put livestock off eating, and can inhibit transpiration and photosynthesis and alter growth. There may be an increase in pasture production due to a mulching effect and slight fertilizing effect, such as occurred following the 1980 Mount St. Helens and 1995/96 Mt Ruapehu eruptions. Heavier falls will completely bury pastures and soil leading to death of pasture and sterilization of the soil due to oxygen deprivation. Plant survival is dependent on <b>ash</b> thickness, <b>ash</b> chemistry, compaction of <b>ash,</b> amount of rainfall, duration of burial and the length of plant stalks at the time of <b>ash</b> fall. The acidic nature of <b>ash</b> will lead to elevated soil sulfur levels and lowered soil pH, which can reduce the availability of essential minerals and alter the soil’s characteristics so that crops and plants will not survive. <b>Ash</b> will also impact upon arable crops, such as fruit, vegetables and grain. <b>Ash</b> can burn plant and crop tissue reducing quality, contaminate crops during harvest and damage plants from <b>ash</b> loading.|$|E

5|$|<b>Ash</b> may disrupt {{transportation}} systems over large areas for hours to days, including roads and vehicles, railways and ports and shipping. Falling <b>ash</b> {{will reduce the}} visibility which can make driving difficult and dangerous. In addition, fast travelling cars will stir up <b>ash,</b> creating billowing clouds which perpetuate ongoing visibility hazards. <b>Ash</b> accumulations will decrease traction, especially when wet, and cover road markings. Fine-grained <b>ash</b> can infiltrate openings in cars and abrade most surfaces, especially between moving parts. Air and oil filters will become blocked requiring frequent replacement. Rail transport is less vulnerable, with disruptions mainly caused by reduction in visibility.|$|E
5|$|<b>Ash</b> {{particles}} {{of less than}} 10 µm diameter suspended in the air {{are known to be}} inhalable, and people exposed to <b>ash</b> falls have experienced respiratory discomfort, breathing difficulty, eye and skin irritation, and nose and throat symptoms. Most of these effects are short-term and are not considered to pose a significant health risk to those without pre-existing respiratory conditions. The health effects of volcanic <b>ash</b> depend on the grain size, mineralogical composition and chemical coatings {{on the surface of the}} <b>ash</b> particles. Additional factors related to potential respiratory symptoms are the frequency and duration of exposure, the concentration of <b>ash</b> in the air and the respirable <b>ash</b> fraction; the proportion of <b>ash</b> with less than 10µm diameter, known as PM10. The social context may also be important.|$|E

Realizing Pikachu's condition is critical, <b>Ash</b> pleads him to go inside his Poké Ball so that <b>Ash</b> can protect him from the approaching Spearow. Pikachu, after seeing how much <b>Ash</b> cares for it, performs a powerful Thunder attack which drives the Spearow away, but also destroys Misty's bike. As the rain-clouds part, a mysterious golden bird flies over a rainbow and Ash's Pokédex informs him {{that there is no}} current data on this Pokémon and that there are several yet to be identified. <b>Ash</b> carries Pikachu into Viridian City, and Pikachu licks Ash's cheek.|$|E

5|$|<b>Ash</b> soon {{comes to}} realize that the Pikachu refuses to go inside his Poké Ball and prefers his independence. As <b>Ash</b> carries the {{reluctant}} Pikachu, he hopes that they can be friends, but Pikachu acts aloof and openly shows his distrust of <b>Ash.</b> Just then, the two stumble upon a Pidgey in the wild and <b>Ash</b> unsuccessfully tries to catch it by throwing a Poké Ball. <b>Ash</b> uses his Pokédex and finds out that in order to catch a Pokémon, a trainer must first use their Pokémon to battle it, thereby weakening it, to be caught by a Poké Ball. With Pikachu being uncooperative, <b>Ash</b> tries to fight the Pidgey himself, but is easily beaten, which greatly amuses Pikachu. The Pidgey escapes and <b>Ash</b> finds a Rattata rummaging through his pack. He chases the Pokémon off as he hears cooing behind him. He turns to see several Pidgey gathered in the tall grass. Frustrated, <b>Ash</b> throws a rock at what he believes is the Pidgey. However, {{it turns out to be}} a Spearow, which starts attacking Pikachu and <b>Ash.</b> Pikachu shocks Spearow, and in the process alerts a whole flock. The angered Spearow flock gives chase and eventually catches up and attacks Pikachu. <b>Ash</b> quickly grabs Pikachu and dives down a waterfall in order to escape from the flock of Spearow, and the two are fished out down river by a young girl named Misty, who tells <b>Ash</b> to take the injured Pikachu to the Pokémon Center in Viridian City. Seeing the Spearow flock approaching, <b>Ash</b> escapes with Pikachu taking Misty's bike.|$|E
5|$|At home, staying {{informed}} about volcanic activity, and having contingency plans {{in place for}} alternative shelter locations, constitutes good preparedness for an <b>ash</b> fall event. This can prevent some impacts associated with <b>ash</b> fall, reduce the effects, and increase the human capacity to cope with such events. A few items such as a flashlight, plastic sheeting to protect electronic equipment from <b>ash</b> ingress, and battery operated radios, are extremely useful during <b>ash</b> fall events.|$|E
5|$|Communication plans {{should be}} made {{beforehand}} to inform of mitigation actions being undertaken. Spare parts and back-up systems should be in place prior to <b>ash</b> fall events to reduce service disruption and return functionality as quickly as possible. Good preparedness also includes the identification of <b>ash</b> disposal sites, before <b>ash</b> fall occurs, to avoid further movement of <b>ash</b> and to aid clean-up. Protective equipment such as eye protection and dust masks should be deployed for clean-up teams in advance of <b>ash</b> fall events.|$|E

5|$|Damage to {{buildings}} and structures can range from complete or partial roof collapse to less catastrophic damage of exterior and internal materials. Impacts depend on the thickness of <b>ash,</b> whether it is wet or dry, the roof and building design and how much <b>ash</b> gets inside a building. The specific weight of <b>ash</b> can vary significantly and rain can increase this by 50-100%. Problems associated with <b>ash</b> loading are {{similar to that of}} snow; however, <b>ash</b> is more severe as 1) the load from <b>ash</b> is generally much greater, 2) <b>ash</b> does not melt and 3) <b>ash</b> can clog and damage gutters, especially after rain fall. Impacts for <b>ash</b> loading depend on building design and construction, including roof slope, construction materials, roof span and support system, and age and maintenance of the building. Generally flat roofs are more susceptible to damage and collapse than steeply pitched roofs. Roofs made of smooth materials (sheet metal or glass) are more likely to shed <b>ash</b> than roofs made with rough materials (thatch, asphalt or wood shingles). Roof collapse can lead to widespread injuries and deaths and property damage. For example, the collapse of roofs from <b>ash</b> during the 15 June 1991 Mount Pinatubo eruption killed about 300 people.|$|E
5|$|Emerald <b>ash</b> borer {{threatens the}} entire North American Fraxinus genus. It has {{killed at least}} tens of {{millions}} of <b>ash</b> trees so far and threatens to kill most of the 8.7 billion <b>ash</b> trees throughout North America. Emerald <b>ash</b> borer kills young trees several years before reaching their seeding age of 10 years. In both North America and Europe, the loss of <b>ash</b> from an ecosystem can result in increased numbers of invasive plants, changes in soil nutrients, and effects on species that feed on <b>ash.</b>|$|E
