40|$|Background Anaphylaxis to {{teicoplanin}} {{appears to}} be extremely rare, with only one confirmed case report worldwide. Two <b>anaesthetic</b> <b>allergy</b> clinics in the UK have received a number of suspected cases referred for investigation, and we present here the first case series of teicoplanin allergy. Methods We investigated 20 cases of suspected teicoplanin allergy, identified from the two clinics {{over a period of}} two years. We devised a set of five criteria to categorize the certainty of their diagnosis. These included: (1) reaction within 15 min of administration of teicoplanin, (2) ≥ 2 features of anaphylaxis present, (3) positive skin testing or challenge testing, (4) raised serum mast cell tryptase (MCT), (5) alternative diagnosis excluded. Based on these criteria we defined the likelihood of IgE-mediated allergy to teicoplanin as: definite-met all criteria; probable-met criteria 1. 2 and 5, plus 3 or 4; uncertain-met criteria 1. 2 and 5; excluded- any others. Results We identified 7 ‘definite’, 7 ‘probable’ and 2 ‘uncertain’ cases of teicoplanin allergy. Four cases were excluded. Conclusions IgE-mediated anaphylaxis to teicoplanin {{appears to be}} more common than previously thought. This is true even if only definitive cases are considered. Investigation of teicoplanin allergy is hampered by the lack of standardized skin test concentrations. In some cases, there was a severe clinical reaction, but without any skin test evidence of histamine release. The mechanism of reaction in these cases is not known and requires further study...|$|E
40|$|A 35 -year-old female {{had severe}} anaphylactoid {{reactions}} to pnlocaine and lignocaine on separate occasions Intradermal testing was positive to serial dilutions of both drugs and negative to bupivacaine, which was subsequently used uneventfully While intradermal testing for local <b>anaesthetic</b> <b>allergy</b> has limited applica-tion {{it would appear}} that when such te*ts are positive in high dilution they may discriminate between safe and unsafe anaesthetic agents. The majority of patients with a history of allergy to local anaesthetic drugs are not allergic (de Shazo and Nelson, 1979) and true allergy, particularly to amide local anaesthetics, is rare. We report a patient with allergy to a number of local anaesthetic drugs in whom intradermal testing enabled subsequent reg-ional anaesthesia to be administered with safety. CASE REPORT The patient was a female born in 1946. She had a past history of eczema and allergy to shellfish, cosmetics and deodorants. During her first preg-nancy in 1975 she attended a dental practitioner who performed an inferior dental block with 1 % prilocaine with 1 : 100000 adrenaline. Within lOmin of the injection her face became swollen bilaterally and she complained of faintness and breathlessness. No further details are available. Six months later while she was in labour a pudendal block was per-formed for forceps delivery with 1 % xylocaine 20 ml. Within minutes the patient complained of feeling unwell and developed a generalized flushing with large weals and bronchospasm. Her face and conjunctiva became swollen. She was given hydro-cortisone 100 mg, promethazine 50 mgi. v. and 1 : 1000 adrenaline 0. 2 ml i. m. The bronchospasm and flushing settled, while oedema persisted for 12 h. Intradermal testing was carried out in 1980 using 0. 1 -ml injections of dilutions of local anaesthetics in normal saline on the anterior aspect of the arm. The results are shown in table I. The testing was per-formed because the patient was 3 months pregnan...|$|E
30|$|Children with CP {{may have}} {{specific}} problems with anaesthesia, including difficulties with intravenous access and intubation, idiosyncratic responses to certain <b>anaesthetic</b> drugs and <b>allergies</b> to medications, dressings or skin preparation materials. Documentation {{of problems with}} previous anaesthetics is extremely helpful for a new management team in an adult tertiary care facility.|$|R
40|$|Background Sheffield National Adverse Reactions Consultancy Service (NARCOS) investigates and triages {{suspected}} perioperative <b>anaesthetic</b> {{reactions to}} <b>allergy</b> clinics, using serial tryptase samples, urinary methylhistamine and clinical {{information on a}} pro forma request. Objective To determine if current UK guidelines on serial tryptase samples are achieved and describe the patterns of tryptase release. Method A retrospective review of 3455 NARCOS cases. Tryptase and clinical details were analysed. 1746 had sufficient clinical information to grade the reactions according to the Ring and Messmer scale. Results 98...|$|R
