5|$|At {{the same}} time, the Soviets were {{designing}} and constructing increasingly sophisticated <b>anti-ballistic</b> <b>missile</b> defense systems to protect strategically important facilities around Moscow, reducing {{the threat posed}} by American ICBMs. These developments compelled the U.S. Secretary of Defense, Robert McNamara, to commission a study to look into ways of improving the survivability of the U.S. nuclear arsenal.|$|E
5|$|Following {{his visit}} to China, Nixon met with Soviet leaders, {{including}} Brezhnev in Moscow. These Strategic Arms Limitation Talks resulted in two landmark arms control treaties: SALT I, the first comprehensive limitation pact signed by the two superpowers, and the <b>Anti-Ballistic</b> <b>Missile</b> Treaty, which banned the development of systems designed to intercept incoming missiles. These aimed to limit the development of costly anti-ballistic missiles and nuclear missiles.|$|E

5|$|After the war, Bethe {{also played}} an {{important}} role in the development of the hydrogen bomb, though he had originally joined the project with the hope of proving it could not be made. Bethe later campaigned with Albert Einstein and the Emergency Committee of Atomic Scientists against nuclear testing and the nuclear arms race. He helped persuade the Kennedy and Nixon administrations to sign, respectively, the 1963 Partial Nuclear Test Ban Treaty and 1972 <b>Anti-Ballistic</b> <b>Missile</b> Treaty (SALT I).|$|E
5|$|Nike-X was an <b>anti-ballistic</b> <b>missile</b> (ABM) system {{designed}} in the 1960s by the US Army to protect major cities in the United States from attacks by the Soviet Union's intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) fleet during the Cold War. The X in the name referred to its experimental basis and {{was supposed to be}} replaced by a more appropriate name when the system was put into production. This never came to pass; the Nike-X program was canceled and replaced by a much lighter defense system known as Sentinel.|$|E
5|$|The PTBT was a {{first of}} a series of nuclear arms control {{treaties}} in the second half of 20th century. The PTBT has been considered the stepping stone to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) of 1968, which made explicit reference to the progress provided by the PTBT. In addition to the NPT, the PTBT was followed within ten years by the Outer Space Treaty and Treaty of Tlatelolco in 1967, Seabed Arms Control Treaty in 1971, and the <b>Anti-Ballistic</b> <b>Missile</b> Treaty in 1972. In 1974, the Threshold Test Ban Treaty prohibited underground tests with yields above 150 kilotons.|$|E

5|$|These radars {{have been}} {{installed}} at six different radar stations {{and as of}} 2012 are operational at three – Balkhash, Mishelevka and Olenegorsk. The 1972 <b>Anti-Ballistic</b> <b>Missile</b> Treaty required that early warning radars were located {{on the periphery of}} national territory and faced outwards. This caused problems when the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991 as many of the radar stations were now in newly independent states. The first station to close was Skrunda, in newly independent Latvia. A 1994 agreement between Russia and Latvia agreed that the two Dnepr radars there would stop working in 1998, and would be fully demolished by 2000.|$|E
5|$|In the 1970s, the Soviet Union {{reached the}} peak of its {{political}} and strategic power {{in relation to the}} United States. The first SALT Treaty effectively established parity in nuclear weapons between the two superpowers, the Helsinki Treaty legitimised Soviet hegemony over Eastern Europe, and the United States defeat in Vietnam and the Watergate scandal weakened the prestige of the United States. Brezhnev and Nixon also agreed to pass the <b>Anti-Ballistic</b> <b>Missile</b> Treaty, which banned both countries from designing systems that would intercept incoming missiles so that neither the U.S. or the Soviet Union would be tempted to strike the other without the fear of retaliation. The Soviet Union extended its diplomatic and political influence in the Middle East and Africa.|$|E
5|$|Nixon ended American {{involvement}} {{in the war in}} Vietnam in 1973 and brought the American POWs home, and ended the military draft. Nixon's visit to China in 1972 eventually led to diplomatic relations between the two nations, and he initiated détente and the <b>Anti-Ballistic</b> <b>Missile</b> Treaty with the Soviet Union the same year. His administration generally transferred power from Washington D.C. to the states. He imposed wage and price controls for ninety days, enforced desegregation of Southern schools and established the Environmental Protection Agency. Nixon also presided over the Apollo 11 moon landing, which signaled the end of the moon race. He was reelected in one of the largest electoral landslides in U.S. history in 1972 when he defeated George McGovern.|$|E
25|$|He made {{important}} {{contributions to the}} design, guidance and control of anti-aircraft systems during World War II and, continuing post-World War II during the Cold War, to the design and control of <b>missiles</b> and <b>anti-ballistic</b> <b>missiles.</b>|$|R

50|$|From the {{beginning}} of the Cold War, The United States, Russia, and other nations have all attempted to develop <b>Anti-ballistic</b> <b>missiles.</b> The United States developed the LIM-49 Nike Zeus in the 1950s in order to destroy incoming ICBMs.|$|R
5|$|Nike Zeus was an <b>anti-ballistic</b> <b>missile</b> (ABM) system {{developed}} by the US Army during the late 1950s and early 1960s, designed to destroy Soviet intercontinental ballistic missile warheads before they could hit targets in the United States. It was designed by Bell's Nike team, and was initially based on the earlier Nike Hercules anti-aircraft missile. The original Zeus A, given the tri-service identifier XLIM-49, was designed to intercept warheads in the upper atmosphere, mounting a 25 kiloton W31 nuclear warhead. During development, the concept changed to protect a much larger area and intercept the warheads at higher altitudes. This required the missile to be greatly enlarged into the totally new design, Zeus B, mounting a 400 kiloton W50 warhead. In several successful tests, the B model proved itself able to intercept warheads, and even satellites.|$|E
5|$|STRAT-X, or Strategic-Experimental, was a U.S. government-sponsored study {{conducted}} during 1966 and 1967 that comprehensively analyzed the potential {{future of the}} U.S. nuclear deterrent force. At the time, the Soviet Union was making significant strides in nuclear weapons delivery, and also constructing <b>anti-ballistic</b> <b>missile</b> defenses to protect strategic facilities. To address a potential technological {{gap between the two}} superpowers, U.S. Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara entrusted the classified STRAT-X study to the Institute for Defense Analyses, which compiled a twenty-volume report in nine months. The report looked into more than one hundred different weapons systems, ultimately resulting in the MGM-134 Midgetman and LGM-118 Peacekeeper intercontinental ballistic missiles, the s, and the Trident submarine-launched ballistic missiles, among others. Journalists have regarded STRAT-X as a major influence on the course of U.S. nuclear policy.|$|E
5|$|In 1955 the US Army began {{considering}} {{the possibility of}} further upgrading their Nike B surface-to-air missile (SAM) as an <b>anti-ballistic</b> <b>missile</b> to intercept ICBMs. Bell Labs, the primary contractor for Nike, was asked to study the issue. Bell returned a report stating that the missile could be upgraded to the required performance relatively easily, but the system would need extremely powerful radar systems to detect the warhead {{while it was still}} far enough away to give the missile time to launch. All of this appeared to be within the state of the art, and in early 1957 Bell was given the go-ahead to develop what was then known as Nike II. Considerable interservice rivalry between the Army and Air Force led to the Nike II being redefined and delayed several times. These barriers were swept aside in late 1957 after the launch of the R-7 Semyorka, the first Soviet ICBM. The design was further upgraded, given the name Zeus, and assigned the highest development priority.|$|E
50|$|Targets {{short-range}} tactical ballistic missiles, {{which usually}} travel {{at less than}} 1.5 km/s (3,400 mph). Tactical <b>anti-ballistic</b> <b>missiles</b> (ABMs) have short ranges, typically 20-80 km (12-50 miles). Examples of currently-deployed tactical ABMs: American MIM-104 Patriot and Russian S-300V.|$|R
50|$|Common {{examples}} include long-range air-to-air missiles that use semi-active radar homing (SARH) {{during most of}} the missile's flight, and then use an infrared seeker or active radar homing once they approach their target. Similar {{examples include}} surface-to-air <b>missiles,</b> <b>anti-ballistic</b> <b>missiles,</b> and some anti-tank missiles.|$|R
50|$|In {{the early}} part of the Cold War, the cost-exchange ratio favoured the defender, since the cost of {{missiles}} increases rapidly with size, and interceptors are generally much smaller than ballistic missiles. This gave a strong impetus to the development and deployment of <b>anti-ballistic</b> <b>missiles</b> in the 1960s.|$|R
25|$|The A-35 <b>anti-ballistic</b> <b>missile</b> {{system was}} a Soviet {{military}} <b>anti-ballistic</b> <b>missile</b> (ABM) system deployed around Moscow to intercept enemy ballistic missiles targeting {{the city or}} its surrounding areas. The A-35 was the only Soviet ABM system allowed under the 1972 <b>Anti-Ballistic</b> <b>Missile</b> Treaty. In development since the 1960s and in operation from 1971 until the 1990s, it featured the nuclear-tipped A350 exoatmospheric interceptor missile. The A-35 {{was supported by the}} two Dunay radars (NATO: Cat House and Dog House) and the Soviet early warning system. It was followed by the A-135 in the early 1990s.|$|E
25|$|Chevaline (pronounced: Shev-a-leen) was {{a system}} to improve the {{penetrability}} of the warheads used by the British Polaris nuclear weapons system. Devised as {{an answer to the}} improved Soviet <b>anti-ballistic</b> <b>missile</b> defences around Moscow, the system increased the probability that at least one warhead would penetrate Moscow's <b>anti-ballistic</b> <b>missile</b> (ABM) defences, something which the Royal Navy's earlier UGM-27 Polaris re-entry vehicles (RV)s were thought to be unlikely to do.|$|E
25|$|Moreover, the U.S. {{withdrawal}} from the <b>Anti-Ballistic</b> <b>Missile</b> Treaty in 2002 had allowed the United States to pursue missile defenses, including space-based.|$|E
50|$|Kosmos 101 (Космос 101 meaning Cosmos 101), {{also known}} as DS-P1-Yu No.4 was a Soviet {{satellite}} which {{was used as a}} radar calibration target for tests of <b>anti-ballistic</b> <b>missiles.</b> It was built by the Yuzhnoye Design Bureau, and launched in 1965 as part of the Dnepropetrovsk Sputnik programme.|$|R
