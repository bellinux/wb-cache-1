40|$|International audienceThe Malm-Lower Cretaceous {{period is}} often {{considered}} {{to represent a}} period of time markedly devoid of crustal deformations, and of heat and mass transfers in western France, although numerous evidences of such transfers are reported in varied basins from western Iberia to western Africa. Migrating evaporitic-derived brines and seawater interacted with both the sedimentary cover and the basement in the Poitou High located at the boundary between Aquitaine and Paris Basins. Occurring after sedimentation, this activity induced significant alterations of the sediments by dolomitization and silicification, and the basement by <b>adularization</b> and locally by concentration of F-Ba (Pb-Zn) assemblages that are typical of carbonate-hosted metal deposits. Thus, metals were leached from metamorphic/granitic basement already weathered and peneplaned during Triassic time, and were redeposited by brines during this main fluid event. The main objective {{of this study was to}} decipher the timing of this major fluid/heat/mass transfer on the basis of 40 Ar/ 39 Ar and K-Ar dating of epigenetic minerals having similar paragenetic and geochemical signatures over an extended area from the Atlantic Ocean coast to the French Massif Central. A Late Jurassic fluid stage (146 - 156 Ma) significantly younger than what is generally reported in Western Europe was obtained. This fluid event occurred within a segment of a continental margin that was located away from main rift zones and far (more than 500 km) from major deformation areas such as the main rift or orogenic zones all over Western Europe. These results yield a new concept based on wide wavelength relationships between fluid movements and geodynamic events affecting both the sedimentary basins and their basements...|$|E
40|$|International audienceIn {{southern}} Brittany (France), the Porphyroid nappe, a Variscan tectonic unit made {{of volcanic}} pyroclastic deposits that {{was involved in}} a low-temperature/high-pressure prograde metamorphic path followed by exhumation and extension, displays evidence for very large and distributed strains achieved through dissolution/crystallization processes. Such distributed strains at low temperature are rather unusual in felsic lithologies. Recent studies have documented that these rocks deformed within a system closed to fluids. This paper presents results of detailed analyses of fluid inclusions and stable isotopes within the deformed metavolcanics and their undeformed counterparts in order to document the fluid history of the tectonic unit. Results show that its initial thermal evolution, likely occurring in a context of basin inversion, involved important open-system alteration, with K-metasomatism (<b>adularization),</b> oil impregnation and hydration. During the subsequent tectonic evolution, the fluids maintained a constant composition in the C-H-O-N system within the Porphyroid nappe and its para-autochthon, being water-rich and containing hydrocarbon components likely related to oil pyrolysis/oxidation. Atoll-like fluid inclusion morphology and rare undisturbed fluid inclusions with steep isochore slopes are consistent (> 750 MPa) with pressures estimated for the peak of metamorphism using mineral solid-solution thermodynamics. Fluid inclusions indicate a sub-isothermal retrograde path (between 420 and 300 Â°C) followed by a high thermal gradient {{at the end of the}} retrograde path. Within the underlying para-autochthonous unit, only the late, high-temperature gradient is recorded by fluid inclusions. The sub-isothermal low-grade path suggests fast exhumation of the unit, without thermal relaxation. The high geotherm observed at the end of the P-T path is consistent with the post-thickening extensional collapse and associated intrusion of granites documented in the area. Hydration and heterogeneous oil/water distribution achieved in the early metasomatic evolution of the porous pyroclastic deposits are responsible for subsequent fluid confining in the Porphyroid nappe and for its strongly distributed strain pattern...|$|E
40|$|Recent {{research}} has discovered high-grade Au ores in NNE-SSW trending shear zones in metamorphic proterozoic and palaeozoic terranes, some 40 km NW of Santiago de Compostela (NW Spain). The orebodies {{are bound to}} late-stage Hercynian structures, mainly due to brittle deformation, which are superimposed on earlier ductile shear zones, cutting through various catazonal lithologies, including ortho- and paragneisses, amphibolites, eclogites, and granites. Ore mineralogy, alteration, and ore textures define a frame whose main features are common to all prospects in the area. Main minerals are arsenopyrite and pyrite - accompanied by quartz, adularia, sericite, + (tourmaline, chlorite, carbonates, graphite), as main gangue minerals - with subordinate amounts of boulangerite, bismuthinite, kobellite, jamesonite, chalcopyrite, marcasite, galena, sphalerite, rutile, titanite, scheelite, beryl, fluorite, and minor native gold, electrum, native bismuth, fahlore, pyrrhotite, mackinawite, etc., defining a meso-catathermal paragenesis. Detailed microscopic study allows the author to propose a general descriptive scheme of textural classification {{for this type of}} ore. Most of the ores fill open spaces or veins, seal cracks or cement breccias; disseminated ores with replacement features related to alteration (mainly silicification, sericitization, and <b>adularization)</b> are also observed. Intensive and repeated cataclasis is a common feature of many ores, suggesting successive events of brittle deformation, hydrothermal flow, and ore precipitation. Gold may be transported and accumulated in any of these events, but tends to be concentrated in later ones. The origin of the gold ores is explained in terms of hydrotherreal discharge, associated with mainly brittle deformation and possibly related to granitic magmas, in the global tectonic frame of crustal evolution of West Galicia. The mineralogical and textural study suggests some criteria which will be of practical value for exploration and for ore processing. Ore grades can be improved by flotation of arsenopyrite. Non-conventional methods, such as pressure or bacterial leaching, may subsequently obtain a residue enriched in gold...|$|E
