5|$|The vast {{majority}} of FBO/Robertson-Cole pictures, produced during either the silent era or the transitional period of the conversion to sound cinema, {{are considered to be}} lost films, with no copies now known to exist. Partly in consequence, many of FBO's star actors <b>are</b> <b>barely</b> remembered today.|$|E
5|$|Physically, the Australian blacktip shark {{can only}} {{reliably}} {{be distinguished from}} the common blacktip shark {{by the number of}} vertebrae (174–182 total, 84–91 before the tail in C. tilstoni, 182–203 total, 94–102 before the tail in C. limbatus). It has a moderately robust, spindle-shaped body and a long, pointed snout. The anterior rims of the nostrils are slightly enlarged into low triangular flaps. The large, circular eyes are equipped with nictitating membranes. The furrows at the corners of the mouth <b>are</b> <b>barely</b> evident. There are 32–35 upper and 29–31 lower tooth rows; each upper tooth has a slender, upright cusp and fine serrations that become coarser near the base, while the lower teeth are narrower and more finely serrated. The five pairs of gill slits are long.|$|E
5|$|The book {{contains}} an evenly distributed mixture of natural history, travel, and observation of human societies, including the towns with their Catholic processions. Only {{the most remarkable}} discoveries of animals and plants are described, and theories such as evolution and mimicry <b>are</b> <b>barely</b> mentioned. Bates remarks that finding a new species is only the start; he also describes animal behaviour, sometimes in detail, as for the army ants. He constantly relates the wildlife to the people, explaining how the people hunt, what they eat and what they use as medicines. The book is illustrated with drawings by leading artists including E. W. Robinson, Josiah Wood Whymper, Joseph Wolf and Johann Baptist Zwecker.|$|E

5|$|One of {{the most}} {{original}} monuments in Jordan, and perhaps in the Hellenistic period in the Near East, is the village of Iraq Al-Amir in the valley of Wadi Al-Sir, southwest of Amman, which is home to Qasr Al-Abd (Castle of the Slave). Other nearby ruins include a village, an isolated house and a fountain, all of which <b>are</b> <b>barely</b> visible today due to the damage brought by a major earthquake that hit {{the region in the}} year 362. Qasr Al-Abd {{is believed to have been}} built by Hyrcanus of Jerusalem, who was the head of the powerful Tobiad family. Shortly after he began the construction of that large building, in 170 BC upon returning from a military campaign in Egypt, Antiochus IV conquered Jerusalem, ransacked a temple where the treasure of Hyrcanus was kept and appeared determined to attack Hyrcanus. Upon hearing this, Hyrcanus committed suicide, leaving his palace in Philadelphia uncompleted. The Tobiads fought the Arab Nabateans for twenty years until they lost the city to them. After losing Philadelphia, we no longer hear of the Tobiad family in written sources.|$|E
5|$|The first lower molar is rounded at {{the front}} end and the labial and lingual conules of the anteroconid, the frontmost cusp, <b>are</b> <b>barely</b> distinct. The second lower molar is {{elongated}} and has a crest, the anterolophid, before the two cusps that form {{the front edge of}} the molar in some other oryzomyines, the protoconid and metaconid. A distinct ridge (anterolabial cingulum) is at the outer front (anterolabial) edge of the molar, before the protoconid. The lower third molar is about as long as the second and also has an anterolophid, albeit a less well-defined one. The first lower molar has large roots {{at the front}} and back of the tooth and usually one or two smaller ones in between, at the labial and lingual side. The second and third lowers molars have either two roots, one labial and one lingual, or only one at the front, and another large root at the back.|$|E

25|$|The bats use audible {{calls to}} {{communicate}} with each other. When at rest, they chirrup; when faced with an aggressive situation, they screech. They use social communication, touch, and chemical cues.

25|$|Austracantha minax minax (Thorell, 1859) - Found in {{mainland}} Australia and surrounding islands, including Tasmania. Characterised by yellow to orange colouration being prevalent {{on the bottom}} of the abdomen and on the legs. The spines are more slender and <b>are</b> <b>barely</b> arched. The rear spines are almost the same length as the side spines. This is the nominate subspecies.|$|E
25|$|The figurine {{is roughly}} biconical. Typical of other venus figures, the {{feminine}} features are overemphasized: the thighs and hips are large while the belly, breasts and buttocks are protruding. The head is a cone, the arms <b>are</b> <b>barely</b> sketched, {{and there are}} no hands, feet, or shoulders at all. The back is concave. In some points a few traces of red ochre paint are still visible.|$|E

25|$|The game {{tends to}} {{emphasize}} {{some aspects of}} the source material more than others. Much of the focus of the game is paid to combat, high-tech weaponry and cybernetic modification; however, performance-enhancing and recreational drug use is either played down or discouraged. Although artificial intelligence, genetic engineering, and cloning <b>are</b> <b>barely</b> mentioned in the core rulebook they are reintroduced in later add-ons such as the chromebook manuals.|$|E
25|$|Cost {{recovery}} in municipal and communal systems is generally low and usually revenues <b>are</b> <b>barely</b> sufficient to cover operating costs and routine maintenance. However, there are exceptions. For example, a program supported by USAID since 1992 in the Altiplano required communities to repay 50% of investment costs, {{which they did}} with only very limited payment arrears, showing the willingness of communities to pay for water supply.|$|E
25|$|Like all trilobites, {{the body}} {{is divided into three}} {{functional}} segments known as tagmata (singular: tagma), which in turn are divided into three lobes - the central lobe (axial) and two lateral lobes (pleural). Aside from faint depressions in the thorax, Bumastus is unusual in that the three lobes <b>are</b> <b>barely</b> discernible from each other. The axial lobe of Bumastus is also very broad in comparison to the pleural lobes.|$|E

However, the potential of decentralized electricity systems (i.e. solar photovoltaics or PV, wind, etc.) for disperse populations was recognized {{by the government in}} the Rural Electrification Plan (PLABER). This component established that the service to households, schools and health facilities in areas of low population density would rely on locally available renewable energy sources.|$|E
25|$|Water {{supply and}} {{sanitation}} in Tanzania has been characterised by decreasing access to improved water {{sources in the}} 2000s (especially in urban areas), steady access {{to some form of}} sanitation (around 93 percent since the 1990s), intermittent water supplies, and generally low quality of service. Many utilities <b>are</b> <b>barely</b> able to cover their operation and maintenance costs through revenues because of low tariffs and poor efficiency. There are significant regional differences, with the best performing utilities being Arusha, Moshi, and Tanga.|$|E
