Though still outnumbered, Smith demanded {{the surrender of}} US fleet from commander William B. Renshaw who had run aground aboard the USS Westfield. While under the flag of truce, Renshaw blew up his vessel and died in the explosion. Smith boarded the USS John F. Carr and captured her as well, {{while the rest of}} the US Navy ships escaped to sea. Aboard the captured USS John F. Carr, Smith gave chase to the fleeing Union ships, however the small ship was unable to match the speed of the larger warships. Turning <b>around</b> <b>back</b> to the bay, Smith captured three small Union ships (the Cavallo, Elias Pike, and Lecompte) with their cargo.|$|E
25|$|In 1902, the Hartley College {{became the}} Hartley University College, a degree {{awarding}} {{branch of the}} University of London. This was after inspection of the teaching and finances by the University College Grants Committee, and donations from Council members (including William Darwin the then Treasurer). An increase in student numbers in the following years motivated fund raising efforts to move the college to greenfield land <b>around</b> <b>Back</b> Lane (now University Road) in the Highfield area of Southampton. On 20 June 1914, Viscount Haldane opened the new site of the renamed Southampton University College. However, {{the outbreak of the}} First World War six weeks later meant no lectures could take place there, as the buildings were handed over by the college authorities for use as a military hospital. To cope with the volume of casualties, wooden huts were erected {{at the rear of the}} building. These were donated to university by the War Office after the end of fighting, in time for the transfer from the high street premises in 1920. At this time, Highfield Hall, a former country house and overlooking Southampton Common, for which a lease had earlier been secured, commenced use as a halls of residence for female students. South Hill, on what is now the Glen Eyre Halls Complex was also acquired, along with South Stoneham House to house male students.|$|E

Further writing assistance from Astudillo continued with [...] "¿Qué Creias?", which was written in its entirety {{in the back of}} a car while the band was touring in California. Tejano singer David Lee Garza lent his [...] "soulful" [...] accordion style on the track. The song [...] "La Carcacha" [...] was written by A.B. after he and Ojeda saw a broken-down car at a restaurant in Ovalo, Texas; Ojeda told A.B. that the Spanish word for it was [...] "carcacha". A month later, A.B. bought a BMW, ordered takeout, and overheard a conversation between two women who said that they would date a man because of his car. A.B. said that this was his inspiration to write a comical song with a moral message; it took him six months to write the song, as he was [...] "fiddling <b>around</b> <b>back</b> and forth" [...] to perfect it. The last song that was recorded for the album, [...] "Amame", was written by Astudillo and Selena; this was the first song that Selena had written since [...] "My Love" [...] (1989).|$|E
500|$|The {{roller coaster}} has a simple layout with a 180 ft drop at 87 degrees, meaning {{it does not}} have a true {{vertical}} drop. [...] The car slowly ascends 60 feet at a 45 degree angle to build tension, then levels out, slowly travelling around a curve on a unique chain system, seen only on Oblivion, as the cars approach the drop. As each car reaches the drop it is held by a holding chain for a maximum of five seconds, giving the rider {{a clear view of the}} long drop, before a brake is released allowing the car to drop into the tunnel. This is followed by a highly banked turn that climbs up and makes the train lie on its side as it goes through. Then after dropping out of the turn the train climbs over a small rise in the track to the brakes, slowing down, and then pulls <b>around</b> <b>back</b> to the station. The open design cars accommodate sixteen passengers in two rows of eight. The back row is slightly raised to give passengers a clear view of the drop. A pre-recorded and disembodied voice saying 'don't look down' was played just before release. In 2004, this sound effect was removed due to sound restrictions on the park and instead the words [...] "Don't look down" [...] have been painted on the floor of the guest observation area where the ride enters the ground. The words are clearly visible to riders when the train is hanging over the edge of the drop.|$|E

60|$|So, {{though he}} was so eager and so hungry, he made himself keep {{perfectly}} still, while he studied out a plan.

Just outside the cowyard was a pile of old boards. Reddy crawled behind this pile of old boards and then crouched and settled himself to be patient.

60|$|Not a {{spark of}} hope {{remained}} to Lightfoot. He simply stood still and trembled, partly with fear and partly with weariness. Then a surprising thing happened. The man spoke softly. He advanced, not threateningly but slowly, and in a friendly way. He walked <b>around</b> <b>back</b> of Lightfoot and then straight towards him. Lightfoot walked on a few steps, and the man followed, still talking softly. Little by little he urged Lightfoot on, driving him towards an open shed in which was a pile of hay. Without understanding just how, Lightfoot {{knew that he had}} found a friend. So he entered the open shed and with a long sigh lay down in the soft hay.|$|E

Peter saw him lift his head to listen. In a few minutes he began to trot that way. He was coming {{to find out what}} that fuss was about. Peter knew that Reddy wouldn't come straight up there. That isn't Reddy's way. He would steal <b>around</b> <b>back</b> of the old stone wall {{on the edge of the}} Old Orchard, which was back of Peter, and would try to see what was going on without being seen himself.|$|E
6000|$|Kennicott did not {{recognize}} her till he drew up before the house. Then he condescended, [...] "Better jump out here and I'll take the boat <b>around</b> <b>back.</b> Say, see if the back door is unlocked, will you?" [...] She unlatched the door for him. She realized that she still carried the damp glove she had stripped off for Erik. She drew it on. She {{stood in the center}} of the living-room, unmoving, in damp coat and muddy rubbers. Kennicott was as opaque as ever. Her task wouldn't be anything so lively as having to endure a scolding, but only an exasperating effort to command his attention so that he would understand the nebulous things she had to tell him, instead of interrupting her by yawning, winding the clock, and going up to bed. She heard him shoveling coal into the furnace. He came through the kitchen energetically, but before he spoke to her he did stop in the hall, did wind the clock.|$|E
6000|$|So Sammy silently flew <b>around</b> <b>back</b> of {{the hunter}} {{and stopped in}} a tree where he could watch all that the man did. For some time Sammy sat there watching. The hunter was sitting behind a sort of fence of bushes which quite hid him from any one who might happen {{to be out on}} the Big River. But of course Sammy could see him perfectly, because he was behind him. Out in front of that little fence, which was on {{the very edge of the}} water, were a number of what Sammy at first took to be some of Mrs. Quack's relatives. [...] "Why doesn't he shoot them?" [...] thought Sammy. He puzzled over this as he watched them until {{suddenly}} it came into his head that he hadn't seen one of them move since he began watching them. The man changed his position, and still those Ducks didn't move, although some of them were so near that they simply couldn't have helped knowing when the hunter moved unless they were more stupid than any one of Sammy's acquaintance.|$|E

6000|$|... "And to eat {{we had to}} go {{in close}} to shore where the water was not at all deep, because it is only in such places that we can get food," [...] {{continued}} Mrs. Quack. [...] "It takes a lot of strength to fly as we fly, and strength requires plenty of food. Mr. Quack knew all the best feeding-places, for he had made the long journey several times, so every day he would lead the way to one of these. He always chose the wildest and most lonely looking places he could find, as far as possible from the homes of men, but even then he was never careless. He would lead us <b>around</b> <b>back</b> and forth over the place he had chosen, and we would all look with all our might for signs of danger. If we saw none, we would drop down a little nearer and a little nearer. But with all our watchfulness, we never could be sure, absolutely sure, that all was safe. Sometimes those terrible two-legged creatures would be hiding in the very middle of the wildest, most lonely looking marshes. They would be covered with grass so that we couldn't see them. Then, as we flew over them, would come the bang, bang, bang, bang of terrible guns, and always some of our flock would drop. We would have to leave them behind, for we knew if we wanted to live we must get beyond the reach of those terrible guns. So we would fly our hardest. It was awful, just simply awful!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{will have}} your wish gratified soon, I have no doubt," [...] resumed the Colonel. [...] "Well, {{now for the}} story of McColloch's mad ride for life and his {{wonderful}} leap down Wheeling hill. A year ago, when the fort was besieged by the Indians, the Major got through the lines and made off for Short Creek. He returned next morning with forty mounted men. They marched boldly up to the gate, and all succeeded in getting inside save the gallant Major, who had waited {{to be the last}} man to go in. Finding it impossible to make the short distance without going under the fire of the Indians, who had rushed up to prevent the relief party from entering the fort, he wheeled his big stallion, and, followed by the yelling band of savages, he took the road leading <b>around</b> <b>back</b> of the fort {{to the top of the}} bluff. The road lay along the edge of the cliff and I saw the Major turn and wave his rifle at us, evidently with the desire of assuring us that he was safe. Suddenly, on the very summit of the hill, he reined in his horse as if undecided. I knew in an instant what had happened. The Major had run right into the returning party of Indians, which had been sent out to intercept our reinforcements. In a moment more we heard the exultant yells of the savages, and saw them gliding from tree to tree, slowly lengthening out their line and surrounding the unfortunate Major. They did not fire a shot. We in the fort were stupefied with horror, and stood helplessly with our useless guns, watching and waiting for the seemingly inevitable doom of our comrade. Not so with the Major! Knowing that he was a marked man by the Indians and feeling that any death was preferable to the gauntlet, the knife, the stake and torch of the merciless savage, he had grasped at a desperate chance. He saw his enemies stealthily darting from rock to tree, and tree to bush, creeping through the brush, and slipping closer and closer every moment. On three sides were his hated foes and on the remaining side--the abyss. Without a moment's hesitation the intrepid Major spurred his horse at the precipice. Never shall I forget that thrilling moment. The three hundred savages were silent as they realized the Major's intention. Those in the fort watched with staring eyes. A few bounds and the noble steed reared high on his hind legs. Outlined by the clear blue sky the magnificent animal stood for one brief instant, his black mane flying in the wind, his head thrown up and his front hoofs pawing the air like Marcus Curtius' mailed steed of old, and then down with a crash, a cloud of dust, and the crackling of pine limbs. A long yell went up from the Indians below, while those above ran to the edge of the cliff. With cries of wonder and baffled vengeance they gesticulated toward the dark ravine into which horse and rider had plunged rather than wait to meet a more cruel death. The precipice at this point is over three hundred feet in height, and in places is almost perpendicular. We believed the Major to be lying crushed and mangled on the rocks. Imagine our frenzy of joy when we saw the daring soldier and his horse dash out of the bushes that skirt the base of the cliff, cross the creek, and come galloping to the fort in safety." ...|$|E
