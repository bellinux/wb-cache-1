5|$|In {{east central}} Florida, <b>a</b> <b>warm</b> sector, {{a region of}} warm surface air between a cold front and <b>a</b> <b>warm</b> front, was {{positioned}} ahead of a progressing cold front. Large scale lift {{was supported by a}} very strong jet stream aloft, with strong vertical shear evident, conducive for rotating thunderstorms and tornadoes. Instability increased overnight with temperatures and dew points increasing through the pre-dawn hours. For example, northwest of Orlando, temperatures were still at , which was about 3 degrees warmer than the average high for the day and 14 degrees warmer than the average low. The conditions helped to form a long-tracked supercell thunderstorm that traveled from Sumter County to the coastal waters of Volusia County during {{the early morning hours of}} February 2, 2007, producing three tornadoes along its track.|$|E

40|$|We {{investigated}} {{the effects of}} <b>a</b> <b>warmer</b> climate, and seasonal trends, {{on the fate of}} oil spilled in the Arctic. Three well blowout scenarios, two shipping accidents and a pipeline rupture were considered. We used ensembles of numerical simulations, using the OSCAR oil spill model, with environmental data for the periods 2009 – 2012 and 2050 – 2053 (representing <b>a</b> <b>warmer</b> future) as inputs to the model. Future atmospheric forcing was based on the IPCC’s A 1 B scenario, with the ocean data generated by the hydrodynamic model SINMOD. We found differences in “typical” outcome of a spill in <b>a</b> <b>warmer</b> future compared to the present, mainly due to a longer season of open water. We have demonstrated that ice cover is extremely important for predicting the fate of an Arctic oil spill, and find that oil spills in <b>a</b> <b>warming</b> climate will in some cases result in greater areal coverage and shoreline exposure...|$|R

5|$|Warm seclusions {{may have}} cloud-free, eye-like {{features}} at their center (reminiscent of tropical cyclones), significant pressure falls, hurricane-force winds, and moderate to strong convection. The most intense warm seclusions often attain pressures less than 950millibars (28.05inHg) with a definitive lower to mid-level warm core structure. <b>A</b> <b>warm</b> seclusion, {{the result of}} a baroclinic lifecycle, occurs at latitudes well poleward of the tropics.|$|E
5|$|<b>A</b> <b>warm</b> {{seclusion}} is {{the mature}} {{phase of the}} extratropical cyclone lifecycle. This was conceptualized after the ERICA field experiment of the late 1980s, which produced observations of intense marine cyclones that indicated an anomalously warm low-level thermal structure, secluded (or surrounded) by a bent-back warm front and a coincident chevron-shaped band of intense surface winds. The Norwegian Cyclone Model, as developed by the Bergen School of Meteorology, largely observed cyclones {{at the tail end}} of their lifecycle and used the term occlusion to identify the decaying stages.|$|E
5|$|An {{occluded}} front is formed {{during the process}} of cyclogenesis when a cold front overtakes <b>a</b> <b>warm</b> front. The cold and warm fronts curve naturally poleward into the point of occlusion, which is also known as the triple point in meteorology. It lies within a sharp trough, but the air mass behind the boundary can be either warm or cold. In a cold occlusion, the air mass overtaking the warm front is cooler than the cool air ahead of the warm front, and plows under both air masses. In <b>a</b> <b>warm</b> occlusion, the air mass overtaking the warm front is not as cool as the cold air ahead of the warm front, and rides over the colder air mass while lifting the warm air. A wide variety of weather can be found along an {{occluded front}}, with thunderstorms possible, but usually their passage is associated with a drying of the air mass. Occluded fronts are indicated on a weather map by a purple line with alternating half-circles and triangles pointing in direction of travel. Occluded fronts usually form around mature low pressure areas.|$|E
