40|$|Approximate Bayesian {{computation}} (ABC) {{constitutes a}} class of computational methods rooted in Bayesian statistics. In all model-based statistical inference, the likelihood function is of central importance, since it expresses the probability of the observed data under a particular statistical model, and thus quantifies the support data lend to particular values of parameters and to choices among different models. For simple models, an analytical formula for the likelihood function can typically be derived.

Up until now, a formal method of statistical inference has been lacking for many of those models, where explicit likelihood functions were intractable. In this Article, we investigate Approximate Bayesian Computation (<b>ABC)</b> <b>methods</b> to infer important parameters of stochastic environmental models. <b>ABC</b> <b>methods</b> have been recently suggested to perform model-based inference in a Bayesian setting when model likelihoods are analytically or computationally intractable and have not been applied to environmental systems analysis or water quality modeling before.

We find that all algorithms perform well and that the uncertainty in the inferred number of corresponding wastewater pulses varies between 6 % and 28 %.

40|$|Approximate Bayesian Computation (<b>ABC)</b> <b>methods</b> {{have gained}} in their {{popularity}} {{over the last}} decade because they expand the horizon of Bayesian parameter inference methods to the range of models for which only forward simulation is available. The majority of the <b>ABC</b> <b>methods</b> rely on the choice of a set of summary statistics to reduce the dimension of the data. However, as has been noted in the ABC literature, the lack of convergence guarantees that is induced by the absence of a vector of sufficient summary statistics that assures inter-model sufficiency over the set of competing models, hinders the use of the usual <b>ABC</b> <b>methods</b> when applied to Bayesian model selection or assessment. In this paper, we present a novel ABC model selection procedure for dynamical systems based on a newly appeared multi-level Markov chain Monte Carlo method, self-regulating ABC-SubSim, and a hierarchical state-space formulation of dynamic models. We show that this formulation makes it possible to independently approximate the model evidence required for assessing the posterior probability of each of the competing models. We also show that ABC-SubSim not only provides an estimate of the model evidence as a simple by-product but also it gives the posterior probability of each model {{as a function of the}} tolerance level, which allows the ABC model choices made in previous studies to be understood.

In contrast to classical Bayesian inference, this method does not build on the avail-ability of the likelihood function, but instead relies on a distance function which measures the distance between some empirical summary statistics and their sim-ulation based counterparts. An open question is the selection of these statistics, particularly regarding their sufficiency properties. In this paper we propose an indirect approach with summary statistics based on statistics of a suitably chosen auxiliary model. We show sufficiency of these statistics for Indirect <b>ABC</b> <b>methods</b> based on parameter estimates (ABC-IP), likelihood functions (ABC-IL) and scores (ABC-IS) of that auxiliary model.
