5|$|By {{broadcasting}} {{accusations of}} communism among Fretilin leaders and sowing discord in the UDT coalition, the Indonesian government fostered instability in East Timor and, observers said, created <b>a</b> <b>pretext</b> for invading. By May {{tensions between the}} two groups caused UDT to withdraw from the coalition.|$|E
5|$|In other instances, {{managers}} deliberately {{used the}} reforms {{as an opportunity}} to cut wages, exaggerating wage cuts made by the ministries so that {{they would be able to}} cut back on overall expenditure. In one case, a manager of a concrete factory was sentenced to eight months corrective labour after being found guilty of using the reforms as <b>a</b> <b>pretext</b> to extract unpaid overtime from workers.|$|E
5|$|Such open {{display of}} anti-British {{feelings}} and humiliation prompted the Governor General {{of the time}} Richard Wellesley to recall Knox to India and unilaterally suspend the diplomatic ties. The Treaty of 1801 was also unilaterally annulled by the British on 24 January 1804. The suspension of diplomatic ties also gave the Governor General <b>a</b> <b>pretext</b> to allow the ex-King Rana Bahadur to return to Nepal unconditionally.|$|E
5000|$|<b>A</b> typical <b>pretext</b> to deny {{emigration}} was {{the real}} or the alleged association with state secrets.|$|R
5000|$|Dmitry Peskov, {{spokesman}} for the Russian President Vladimir Putin, described the US air strikes on the Shayrat airbase as [...] "an act of aggression against a sovereign state delivered in violation of international law under <b>a</b> far-fetched <b>pretext....</b> <b>a</b> serious blow to Russian-US relations, which are already in a poor state".|$|R

5|$|Using his {{responsibility}} for the Volksdeutsche of the Banat as <b>a</b> <b>pretext,</b> Meyszner constantly interfered with operational orders issued to the 7th SS Division. In September 1943, the total police forces at his disposal comprised the 5th SS-Polizei Regiment, minus one company detached to occupied Greece and seven battalions of Hilfspolizei (auxiliary police) of various ethnicities, which had only received 4–5 weeks training due to constant employment.|$|E
5|$|In February 1828, {{shortly before}} his 41st birthday, Etty soundly {{defeated}} John Constable by 18 votes to five to become a full Royal Academician, {{at the time the}} highest honour available to an artist. By this time, complaints about his supposed indecency were beginning to resurface. All but one of the 15 paintings Etty exhibited at the Royal Academy in the 1820s had included at least one nude figure, and Etty was acquiring a reputation for using respectable themes as <b>a</b> <b>pretext</b> for nudity.|$|E
5|$|In {{response}} to British requests for direct negotiations to avoid war, Germany made demands on Poland, which only served as <b>a</b> <b>pretext</b> to worsen relations. On 29 August, Hitler demanded that a Polish plenipotentiary immediately travel to Berlin {{to negotiate the}} handover of Danzig, and to allow a plebiscite in the Polish Corridor in which the German minority would vote on secession. The Poles refused {{to comply with the}} German demands and on the night of 30–31 August in a violent meeting with the British ambassador Neville Henderson, Ribbentrop declared that Germany considered its claims rejected.|$|E
25|$|Critics have {{alleged that}} Currie's {{approach}} {{is nothing more}} than <b>a</b> complex <b>pretext</b> to avoid applying foreign law if there are two or more personal laws.|$|R
25|$|<b>A</b> strong <b>pretext</b> for the Dutch {{to attack}} Klunkung would appear later, and {{materialize}} in the 1908 Dutch intervention in Bali, which {{would put a}} final end to autochthonous rule in Bali.|$|R

5|$|Philip's {{campaign}} in Greece became linked with a new, fourth, Sacred War. The citizens of Amphissa in Ozolian Locris had begun cultivating land sacred to Apollo on the Crisaean plain south of Delphi; after some internal bickering the Amphictyonic council decided {{to declare a}} sacred war against Amphissa. A Thessalian delegate proposed that Philip should be made leader of the Amphictyonic forces, which therefore gave Philip <b>a</b> <b>pretext</b> to {{campaign in}} Greece; it is, however, probable that Philip would have gone ahead with his campaign anyway.|$|E
5|$|The Kuomintang (KMT) {{party in}} China {{launched}} a unification campaign against regional warlords and nominally unified China in the mid-1920s, but was soon {{embroiled in a}} civil war against its former Chinese Communist Party allies and new regional warlords. In 1931, an increasingly militaristic Empire of Japan, which had long sought influence in China as the first step of what its government saw as the country's right to rule Asia, used the Mukden Incident as <b>a</b> <b>pretext</b> to launch an invasion of Manchuria and establish the puppet state of Manchukuo.|$|E
5|$|The final {{steps in}} the shift to empire may have been {{triggered}} by Athens' defeat in Egypt, which challenged the city's dominance in the Aegean {{and led to the}} revolt of several allies, such as Miletus and Erythrae. Either because of a genuine fear for its safety after the defeat in Egypt and the revolts of the allies, or as <b>a</b> <b>pretext</b> to gain control of the League's finances, Athens transferred the treasury of the alliance from Delos to Athens in 454–453BC.|$|E
30|$|Phishing {{refers to}} the effort of posting {{personal}} information, usually financial in nature relating to bank accounts and credit cards, using <b>a</b> false <b>pretext</b> as bait. Phishing attempts typically send a spam email.|$|R

5|$|Tự Đức {{continued}} {{to hope that}} Vietnamese compliance with the treaty would convince France to return the three southern provinces. In the words of Gian, Vietnam's full cooperation with the 1862 treaty was necessary to maintain {{the possibility of a}} territorial retrocession. The French officers in Saigon, the capital of Cochinchina, frequently accused the Nguyễn court of violating the treaty by quietly supporting continued resistance. In 1867, they took this as <b>a</b> <b>pretext</b> to seize the other three provinces in southern Vietnam: Vĩnh Long, Hà Tiên and An Giang.|$|E
5|$|When Hitler {{asked for}} <b>a</b> <b>pretext</b> for the {{invasion}} of Poland in 1939, Himmler, Heydrich, and Heinrich Müller masterminded a false flag plan code-named Operation Himmler. It involved a fake attack on the German radio station at Gleiwitz on 31 August 1939. Heydrich masterminded the plan and toured the site, which was about four miles from the Polish border. Wearing Polish uniforms, 150 German troops carried out several attacks along the border. Hitler used the ruse {{as an excuse to}} launch his invasion.|$|E
5|$|With the Conservatives {{leading in}} the polls, Diefenbaker wanted a new election, hopeful that his party would gain a {{majority}} of seats. It was then Canadian constitutional practice that the Governor General could refuse a dissolution early in a parliament's term, unless the government had been defeated in the House, or was winning divisions by {{only a handful of}} votes. Diefenbaker sought <b>a</b> <b>pretext</b> for a new election.|$|E

5|$|As the JNA {{disengaged}} from Croatia, its personnel {{prepared to}} set up a new Bosnian Serb army; Bosnian Serbs declared the Serbian Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina on 9 January 1992. Between 29 February and 1 March 1992, a referendum on independence of Bosnia and Herzegovinawhich would later be cited as <b>a</b> <b>pretext</b> for the Bosnian Warwas held. Bosnian Serbs set up barricades in the capital Sarajevo and elsewhere on 1 March, and the next day the first fatalities of the war were recorded in Sarajevo and Doboj. In the final days of March, the Bosnian Serb army started shelling Bosanski Brod, and Sarajevo was attacked on 4 April.|$|E
5|$|As the Yugoslav People's Army (Jugoslovenska narodna armija – JNA) {{withdrew from}} Croatia {{following}} the acceptance and start of {{implementation of the}} Vance plan, its 55,000 officers and soldiers born in Bosnia and Herzegovina were transferred to a new Bosnian Serb army, which was later renamed the Army of Republika Srpska (Vojska Republike Srpske – VRS). This reorganisation followed the declaration of the Serbian Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina on 9 January 1992, ahead of the 29 February – 1 March 1992 referendum on the independence of Bosnia and Herzegovina. This declaration would later be cited by the Bosnian Serbs as <b>a</b> <b>pretext</b> for the Bosnian War. On 4 April, JNA artillery began shelling Sarajevo. At the same time, the JNA and the Bosnian Serb forces clashed with the HVO at the Kupres Plateau, capturing Kupres by 7 April.|$|E
5|$|As the Yugoslav People's Army (Jugoslovenska narodna armija – JNA) {{withdrew from}} Croatia {{following}} {{the implementation of}} the Vance plan, it was reorganised into a new Bosnian Serb army.

This declaration was later cited by the Bosnian Serbs as <b>a</b> <b>pretext</b> for the Bosnian War. Bosnian Serbs began fortifying the capital, Sarajevo, and other areas on 1 March. On the following day, the first fatalities of the war were recorded in Sarajevo and Doboj. On 27 March, Bosnian Serb forces bombarded Bosanski Brod with artillery, drawing a border crossing by the Croatian Army (Hrvatska vojska – HV) 108th Brigade in response.|$|E

5000|$|At the {{invitation}} of French-speaking factions in Vaud, 12,000 French troops under general Ménard invaded Vaud on 28 January. An alleged incident, in which French soldiers were killed by Swiss soldiers, was cited as <b>an</b> <b>pretext.</b> They occupied Vaud without resistance and were cheered on by the population. A second army under general Schauenburg advanced from Mont-Terrible, the former Prince-Bishopric of Basel, towards Bern and demanded its government to put pro-French Revolutionary parties in power. The Bernese refusal to do so {{was used by the}} French to justify war. On 3 February, the Légion fidèle or [...] "Loyal Legion" [...] was formed out of French-speaking volunteers from Vaud who wished to stay loyal to Bern and recapture the Lemanic Republic.|$|R
5|$|At the temple, Kassandra is {{assaulted}} by Khryse, a priest who disguises himself as Apollo {{in order to}} seduce her. She sees through his trickery and fights him off, but the god feels insulted by her refusal and makes the city's residents stop believing her prophecies. Menelaus' brother Agamemnon uses Helen's flight as <b>a</b> <b>pretext</b> for war and soon begins launching daily raids on Troy, beginning the Trojan War. Kassandra spends {{more time with her}} family to help with daily tasks while the menled by Hectorfight off the Akhaian invaders. The war continues sporadically despite the attempts of former Trojan ally Odysseus to end the conflict.|$|E
5|$|Contradicting the Succession Act, which {{restored}} Mary and Elizabeth to {{the line}} of succession, Edward named Dudley's daughter-in-law Lady Jane Grey, the granddaughter of Henry VIII's younger sister Mary, as his successor. Lady Jane's mother was Frances Brandon, Mary's cousin and goddaughter. Just before Edward VI's death, Mary was summoned to London to visit her dying brother. She was warned, however, that the summons was <b>a</b> <b>pretext</b> on which to capture her and thereby facilitate Lady Jane's accession to the throne. Therefore, instead of heading to London from her residence at Hunsdon, Mary fled into East Anglia, where she owned extensive estates and Dudley had ruthlessly put down Kett's Rebellion. Many adherents to the Catholic faith, opponents of Dudley's, lived there. On 9 July, from Kenninghall, Norfolk, she wrote to the privy council with orders for her proclamation as Edward's successor.|$|E
5|$|During the Second Macedonian War (200–196 BC), Macedon {{had given}} Sparta control over Argos, an {{important}} {{city on the}} Aegean coast of Peloponnese. Sparta's continued occupation of Argos {{at the end of}} war was used as <b>a</b> <b>pretext</b> for Rome and its allies to declare war. The anti-Spartan coalition laid siege to Argos, captured the Spartan naval base at Gythium, and soon invested and besieged Sparta itself. Eventually, negotiations led to peace on Rome's terms, under which Argos and the coastal towns of Laconia were separated from Sparta and the Spartans were compelled to pay a war indemnity to Rome over the next eight years. Argos joined the Achaean League, and the Laconian towns were placed under Achaean protection.|$|E
25|$|On <b>a</b> flimsy <b>pretext,</b> <b>a</b> Republican French army invaded Switzerland in January 1798 {{and forced}} the country into an uneasy {{alliance}} marked by occasional revolts. By the start of hostilities with Austria in early 1799, Masséna was {{in command of the}} Army of Helvetia. Going on the offensive, the French inflicted defeats on the Austrians at Maienfeld, Chur and Feldkirch on 6 and 7 March. Ordered to attack Feldkirch in late March by his superior Jean-Baptiste Jourdan, Masséna attacked with troops under Nicolas Oudinot. Jourdan's defeats at Ostrach and Stockach soon forced the French to recoil.|$|R
