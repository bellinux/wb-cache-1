40|$|International audienceBACKGROUND: Histoplasma capsulatum and Pneumocystis organisms cause host infections {{primarily}} {{affecting the}} lung tissue. H. capsulatum is endemic in the United States of America and Latin American countries. In special environments, H. capsulatum is {{commonly associated with}} bat and bird droppings. Pneumocystis-host specificity has been primarily studied in laboratory animals, {{and its ability to}} be harboured by wild animals remains as an important issue for understanding the spread of this pathogen in nature. Bats infected with H. capsulatum or Pneumocystis spp. have been found, with this mammal serving as a probable reservoir and disperser; however, the co-infection of bats with both of these microorganisms has never been explored. To evaluate the impact of H. capsulatum and Pneumocystis spp. infections in this flying mammal, 21 bat lungs from <b>Argentina</b> (<b>AR),</b> 13 from French Guyana (FG), and 88 from Mexico (MX) were screened using nested-PCR of the fragments, employing the Hcp 100 locus for H. capsulatum and the mtLSUrRNA and mtSSUrRNA loci for Pneumocystis organisms. RESULTS: Of the 122 bats studied, 98 revealed H. capsulatum infections in which 55 of these bats exhibited this infection alone. In addition, 51 bats revealed Pneumocystis spp. infection of which eight bats exhibited a Pneumocystis infection alone. A total of 43 bats (eight from AR, one from FG, and 34 from MX) were found co-infected with both fungi, representing a co-infection rate of 35. 2 % (95 % CI = 26. 8 - 43. 6 %). CONCLUSION: The data highlights the H. capsulatum and Pneumocystis spp. co-infection in bat population's suggesting interplay with this wild host...|$|R
40|$|Artículo de publicación ISIThe Mejillonia terrane, {{named after}} the Mejillones Peninsula (northern Chile), has been {{traditionally}} considered an early Paleozoic block of metamorphic and igneous rocks displaced along the northern Andean margin in the Mesozoic. However, U–Pb SHRIMP zircon dating of metasedimentary and igneous rocks shows that the sedimentary protoliths were Triassic, and that metamorphism and magmatism {{took place in the}} Late Triassic (Norian). Field evidence combined with zircon dating (detrital and metamorphic) further suggests that the sedimentary protoliths were buried, deformed (foliated and folded) and metamorphosed very rapidly, probably within few million years, at ca. 210 Ma. The metasedimentary wedge was then uplifted and intruded by a late arc-related tonalite body (Morro Mejillones) at 208 ± 2 Ma, only a short time after the peak of metamorphism. The Mejillones metamorphic and igneous basement represents an accretionary wedge or marginal basin that underwent contractional deformation and metamorphism {{at the end of a}} Late Permian to Late Triassic anorogenic episode that is well known in Chile and Argentina. Renewal of subduction along the pre-Andean continental margin in the Late Triassic and the development of new subduction-related magmatism are probably represented by the Early Jurassic Bólfin–Punta Tetas magmatic arc in the southern part of the peninsula, for which an age of 184 ± 1 Ma was determined. We suggest retaining the classification of Mejillonia as a tectonostratigraphic terrane, albeit in this new context.

40|$|The {{present study}} {{evaluated}} the reproductive compatibility of the crosses between adult ticks {{of the following}} three geographically different populations of Amblyomma cajennense: State of So Paulo (SP), southeastern Brazil; State of Rondnia (RO), northern Brazil; and Colombia (CO). In addition, crosses between A. cajennense ticks from <b>Argentina</b> (<b>AR)</b> and SP ticks were also performed. The Argentinean population (AR) was compatible with SP because their crosses resulted in high % egg hatching (mean values ranging from 71. 5 to 93. 5 %), similarly to all homologous (intrapopulational) crosses. In contrast, the tick populations SP, RO, and CO were shown to be incompatible with each other, since their heterologous (interpopulational) crosses always resulted in very low % egg hatching (range: 0 - 5 %). The F(1) larval offspring derived from some of these females that yielded 5 % egg hatching were reared until the F(1) adult stage. In all cases, only adult females molted from engorged nymphs. These F(1) females {{were likely to be}} a product of thelytokous parthenogenesis of the SP, RO, and CO females that were used in the heterologous crosses. Reproductive incompatibility is not expected to occur between different populations of a single species. Thus, our results suggest that the taxon A. cajennense might be represented by a complex of different species, whereas SP and AR ticks might represent a single species. Further populational genetic studies, coupled with extensive morphological analyses, are needed to clarify and determine a possible complex of valid species that might have been classified under the taxon A. cajennense.

40|$|Background Ripening of {{fleshy fruit}} {{is a complex}} {{developmental}} process involving the differentiation of tissues with separate functions. During grapevine berry ripening important processes contributing to table and wine grape quality take place, some of them flesh- or skin-specific. In this study, transcriptional profiles throughout flesh and skin ripening were followed during two different seasons in a table grape cultivar ‘Muscat Hamburg’ to determine tissue-specific as well as common developmental programs. Methodology/Principal Findings Using an updated GrapeGen Affymetrix GeneChip® annotation based on grapevine 12 ×v 1 gene predictions, 2188 differentially accumulated transcripts between flesh and skin and 2839 transcripts differentially accumulated throughout ripening {{in the same manner}} in both tissues were identified. Transcriptional profiles were dominated by changes at the beginning of veraison which affect both pericarp tissues, although frequently delayed or with lower intensity in the skin than in the flesh. Functional enrichment analysis identified the decay on biosynthetic processes, photosynthesis and transport as {{a major part of the}} program delayed in the skin. In addition, a higher number of functional categories, including several related to macromolecule transport and phenylpropanoid and lipid biosynthesis, were over-represented in transcripts accumulated to higher levels in the skin. Functional enrichment also indicated auxin, gibberellins and bHLH transcription factors to take part in the regulation of pre-veraison processes in the pericarp, whereas WRKY and C 2 H 2 family transcription factors seems to more specifically participate in the regulation of skin and flesh ripening, respectively. Conclusions/Significance A transcriptomic analysis indicates that a large part of the ripening program is shared by both pericarp tissues despite some components are delayed in the skin. In addition, important tissue differences are present from early stages prior to the ripening onset including tissue-specific regulators. Altogether, these findings provide key elements to understand berry ripening and its differential regulation in flesh and skin.

40|$|Abstract Background Epidemiological studies {{worldwide}} {{have shown}} that A. fumigatus exhibits important phenotypic and genotypic diversity, and these findings have been of great importance in improving the {{diagnosis and treatment of}} diseases caused by this fungus. However, few studies have been carried out related to the epidemiology of this fungus in Latin America. This study´s aim is to report on the epidemiology of the fungus by analyzing the phenotypic variability of Aspergillus section Fumigati isolates from different Latin American countries and the relationship between this variability, the geographical origin and genotypic characteristics. Methods We analyzed the phenotypic characteristics (macro- and micromorphology, conidial size, vesicles size, antifungal susceptibility and thermotolerance at 28, 37 and 48 °C) of A. section Fumigati isolates from Mexico (MX), <b>Argentina</b> (<b>AR),</b> Peru (PE) and France (FR). The results were analyzed using analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Tukey's multiple comparison test to detect significant differences. Two dendrograms among isolates were obtained with UPGMA using the Euclidean distance index. One was drawn for phenotypic data, and the other for phenotypic and genotypic data. A PCoA was done for shown isolates in a space of reduced dimensionality. In order to determine the degree of association between the phenotypic and genotypic characteristics AFLP, we calculated the correlation between parwise Euclidean distance matrices of both data sets with the nonparametric Mantel test. Results No variability was found in the macromorphology of the studied isolates; however, the micromorphology and growth rate showed that the PE isolates grew at a faster rate and exhibited the widest vesicles in comparison to the isolates from MX, AR and FR. The dendrogram constructed with phenotypic data showed three distinct groups. The group I and II were formed with isolates from PE and FR, respectively, while group III was formed with isolates from MX and AR. The dendrogram with phenotypic and genotypic data showed the same cluster, except for an isolate from FR that formed a separate cluster. This cluster was confirmed using PCoA. The correlation between the phenotypic and genotypic data of the isolates revealed a statistically significant association between these characteristics. Conclusions The PE isolates showed specific phenotypic characteristics that clearly differentiate them {{from the rest of the}} isolates, which matches the genotypic data. The correlation between the phenotypic and genotypic characteristics showed a statistically significant association. In conclusion, phenotypic and genotypic methods together increase the power of correlation between isolates. </p...|$|R
40|$|The Angora goat {{populations in}} <b>Argentina</b> (<b>AR),</b> France (FR) and South Africa (SA) {{have been kept}} {{geographically}} and genetically distinct. Due to country-specific selection and breeding strategies, {{there is a need}} to characterize the populations on a genetic level. In this study we analysed genetic variability of Angora goats from three distinct geographical regions using the standardized 50 k Goat SNP Chip. A total of 104 goats (AR: 30; FR: 26; SA: 48) were genotyped. Heterozygosity values as well as inbreeding coefficients across all autosomes per population were calculated. Diversity, as measured by expected heterozygosity (HE) ranged from 0. 371 in the SA population to 0. 397 in the AR population. The SA goats were the only population with a positive average inbreeding coefficient value of 0. 009. After merging the three datasets, standard QC and LD-pruning, 15 105 SNPs remained for further analyses. Principal component and clustering analyses were used to visualize individual relationships within and between populations. All SA Angora goats were separated from the others and formed a well-defined, unique cluster, while outliers were identified in the FR and AR breeds. Apparent admixture between the AR and FR populations was observed, while both these populations showed signs of having some common ancestry with the SA goats. LD averaged over adjacent loci within the three populations per chromosome were calculated. The highest LD values estimated across populations were observed in the shorter intervals across populations. The Ne for the Angora breed was estimated to be 149 animals ten generations ago indicating a declining trend. Results confirmed that geographic isolation and different selection strategies caused genetic distinctiveness between the populations.

40|$|Background]: Rapid and {{consistent}} genotyping {{is an important}} requirement for cultivar identification in many crop species. Among them grapevine cultivars {{have been the subject}} of multiple studies given the large number of synonyms and homonyms generated during many centuries of vegetative multiplication and exchange. Simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers have been preferred until now because of their high level of polymorphism, their codominant nature and their high profile repeatability. However, the rapid application of partial or complete genome sequencing approaches is identifying thousands of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) that can be very useful for such purposes. Although SNP markers are bi-allelic, and therefore not as polymorphic as microsatellites, the high number of loci that can be multiplexed and the possibilities of automation as well as their highly repeatable results under any analytical procedure make them the future markers of choice for any type of genetic identification. [Results]: We analyzed over 300 SNP in the genome of grapevine using a re-sequencing strategy in a selection of 11 genotypes. Among the identified polymorphisms, we selected 48 SNP spread across all grapevine chromosomes with allele frequencies balanced enough as to provide sufficient information content for genetic identification in grapevine allowing for good genotyping success rate. Marker stability was tested in repeated analyses of a selected group of cultivars obtained worldwide to demonstrate their usefulness in genetic identification. [Conclusions]: We have selected a set of 48 stable SNP markers with a high discrimination power and a uniform genome distribution (2 - 3 markers/chromosome), which is proposed as a standard set for grapevine (Vitis vinifera L.) genotyping. Any previous problems derived from microsatellite allele confusion between labs or the need to run reference cultivars to identify allele sizes disappear using this type of marker. Furthermore, because SNP markers are bi-allelic, allele identification and genotype naming are extremely simple and genotypes obtained with different equipments and by different laboratories are always fully comparable.
