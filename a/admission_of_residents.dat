40|$|Background The health {{mobility}} is {{an increasingly}} debated {{issue in the}} European arena under the European Union directive on cross- border patients migration. The Italian health system, due to its characteristics of administrative and fiscal federalism, is well suited {{to the analysis of}} the dynamics of interregional flows of patients. Our study aims to analyze time series patient- s’mobility among the 21 among Italian regions. Methods We used hospital discharge data obtained from the Ministry of Health, ranging from 1998 to 2008. The information collected for each of the 19 Italian regions and the two autonomous provinces of Bolzano and Trento were: <b>admission</b> <b>of</b> <b>residents</b> in their regional hospitals (R); admission to hospitals of patients ‘‘attracted’’ from other regions (A); <b>admission</b> <b>of</b> <b>residents</b> ‘‘escaped’’ in other regions (E). The data were grouped into two time series: from 1998 to 2002 and from 2003 to 2008 (1 regional administrative mandate is 5 years long). For the statistical analysis of time trends we used the non-parametric test of Cuzick. Significance was set at P < 0. 05. Results 13 / 21 Regions changed their R trends: only some, placed in North Italy (Piedmont, V. Aosta, Trento, Friuli, Marche) had an increase. 12 / 21 Regions changed the A trend but only Calabria had a reduction one. 11 / 21 Regions changed the E trend: in 4 there was an increase. Conclusions The reduction of E could be read as a regain of the loses (increase demand satisfaction and/or improvement of health care performances) which were previously experienced. An increase of A could be read as a better offer; an increase of R identifies a regain in satisfying the inner demand of regional residents and/or improvements of the health care system. More significant is the jointly interpretation of R, E and A which made possible to identify several scenarios, for example good policy is when we found attractiveness ability trend, without the loss of inner residents. This scenario seems to have generally occurred in Northern Italy (for example Piedmont, V. Aosta, Trento, Friuli). Other Regions showed an increase of E and a reduction of R (Veneto, Tuscany, Umbria and Abruzzo). This condition was more critical. Apulia and Sardinia did not show significant variations. Key messages Patients’ mobility is a proxy of health policy. The European microcosm of the italian regions showed that areas mainly located in Northern increased local health care demand’satisfaction, while others increased escapes and decreased attractions...|$|E

40|$|Study {{objectives}}. The {{objectives of}} this study were twofold. First, we used simulation to investigate three statistical methodologies for analyzing recurrent event data in the presence of environmental covariates to determine which procedure performs well under what situation. Secondly, we investigated the association between daily air pollution and hospital <b>admissions</b> <b>of</b> respiratory diseases by analyzing data from Vancouver, British Columbia. Settings and study population. Five air pollutants: carbon monoxide (CO), coefficient of haze (CoH), nitrogen dioxide (NO 2), sulfur dioxide (SO 2) and particulate matter 10 microns or less in diameter (PM 10) were considered in this study. The event of interest was daily respiratory hospital <b>admissions</b> <b>of</b> <b>residents</b> (65 + years) of Vancouver, B. C. from April 01, 1995 to March 31, 1999. The dates <b>of</b> hospital <b>admission</b> for each individual 2 ̆ 7 s repeated visits due to respiratory diseases were recorded. Statistical methodologies. Three statistical methods were studied in this study, namely, Dewanji and Moolgavker 2 ̆ 7 s model (2000, 2002) based on a Poisson process assumption (Model I), Nividi 2 ̆ 7 s model (1998, 2002) for bidirectional case-crossover designs (Model II), and the usual time series analysis using a generalized linear model with natural splines (ns) to smooth time (Model III). A simulation method was used to evaluate and compare these procedures. The mean square error (MSE) was the criterion used for evaluation. (Abstract shortened by UMI.)

40|$|Abstract Background Socioeconomic status {{could affect}} the demand for {{hospital}} care. The aim {{of the present study}} was to assess the role of age, socioeconomic status and comorbidity on acute hospital admissions among elderly. Methods We retrospectively examined the discharge abstracts data of acute care hospital <b>admissions</b> <b>of</b> <b>residents</b> in Rome aged 75 or more years in the period 1997 – 2000. We used the Hospital Information System of Rome, the Tax Register, and the Population Register of Rome for socio-economic data. The rate of hospitalization, modified Charlson's index of comorbidity, and level of income in the census tract of residence were obtained. Rate ratios and 95 % confidence limits were computed to assess the relationship between income deciles and rate of hospitalization. Cross-tabulation was used to explore the distribution of the index of comorbidity by deciles of income. Analyses were repeated for patients grouped according to selected diseases. Results Age was associated with a marginal increase in the rate of hospitalization. However, the hospitalization rate was inversely related to income in both sexes. Higher income was associated with lower comorbidity. The same associations were observed in patients admitted with a principal diagnosis of chronic condition (diabetes mellitus, heart failure, chron obstructive pulmonary disease) or stroke, but not hip fracture. Conclusion Lower social status and associated comorbidity, more than age per se, are associated with a higher rate of hospitalization in very old patients. </p...|$|R

40|$|Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is endemic in many {{hospital}} settings, including nursing homes. It is {{an important}} nosocomial pathogen that causes mortality and an economic burden to patients, hospitals, and the community. The epidemiology of the bacteria in nursing homes is both hospital- and community-like. Transmission occurs via hands of health care workers (HCWs) and direct contacts among residents during social activities. In this work, mathematical modeling in both deterministic and stochastic frameworks is used to study dissemination <b>of</b> MRSA among <b>residents</b> and HCWs, persistence and prevalence of MRSA in a population, and possible means of controlling the spread of this pathogen in nursing homes. The model predicts that: (i) without strict screening and decolonization of colonized individuals at admission, MRSA may persist; (ii) decolonization <b>of</b> colonized <b>residents,</b> improving hand hygiene in both residents and HCWs, reducing the duration of contamination of HCWs, and decreasing the resident:staff ratio are possible control strategies; (iii) the mean time that a resident remains susceptible since admission may be prolonged by screening and decolonization treatment in colonized individuals; (iv) in the stochastic framework, the total number <b>of</b> colonized <b>residents</b> varies and may increase when the <b>admission</b> <b>of</b> colonized <b>residents,</b> the duration <b>of</b> colonization, the average number <b>of</b> contacts among <b>residents,</b> or {{the average number of}} contacts that each resident requires from HCWs increases; (v) an introduction of a colonized individual into an MRSA-free nursing home has a much higher probability of leading to a majo...|$|R

40|$|Objective: This {{population-based}} study {{investigates the}} influence of geographical location on hospital admissions, utilisation and outcomes for fall-related injury in older adults, adjusting for age, sex and comorbidities. Methods: A linked dataset <b>of</b> all <b>admissions</b> <b>of</b> NSW <b>residents</b> aged 65 and older, hospitalised at least once for a fall-related injury between 2003 and 2012, was used to estimate rates of hospitalisations, total lengths-of-stay, 28 -day readmissions, and 30 -day mortalities. These were standardised for age, sex, comorbidity, and remoteness. Results: Compared to urban residents, rural residents were hospitalised less (p< 0. 0001) and hospitalisation rates increased at a lower rate (0. 8 % vs 2. 6 % per year) from 2003 to 2012. Rural residents had a shorter median total length of stay (5 vs 7 days, p< 0. 0001), a higher 28 -day readmission rate (18. 9 % vs 17. 0 %, p< 0. 0001) and higher 30 -day mortality (5. 0 % vs 4. 9 %, p= 0. 0046). Conclusions: Over the study period, rural <b>residents</b> <b>of</b> NSW had lower rates of fall-related injury hospitalisation and a lower annual increase in hospitalisation rates compared to urban residents. When hospitalised, rural residents had a shorter length-of-stay, but higher rates of readmission and mortality. These differences existed following standardisation.

40|$|Since {{the early}} 70 's, the policy {{regarding}} public hospitals in Belgium has been oriented towards distinguishing various geographical regions (within the country) and, within each region, {{various levels of}} technology, each having a specific function. But how does one delineate a region? The application of a log-linear model, first introduced by Birch (1963), shows that in the vast area of Liege and its surrounding localities, there are several autonomous sub-regions. Analysis of flows of patients from their "commune" of residence to the "commune" of the hospitals where they are admitted indicates that: (i) admissions are very frequent within each sub-region; (ii) there are strong exchanges between certain sub-regions, in particular between Huy and Waremme and between Verviers and Stavelot-Malmedy. Moreover, use of the model of quasi-symmetry, introduced by Caussinus (1965), suppresses {{the effect of the}} flows within each sub-region and illustrates the specific attractiveness of the city of Liege and its university hospital. Finally, the projection of interactive flows between Greater Liege and its surrounding regions shows that the former hosts 93 % <b>of</b> the hospital <b>admissions</b> <b>of</b> its <b>residents.</b> Hospital <b>admission</b> is a sound example of the urban function of which geographic strength may be of interest for delineating regions within countries.

40|$|Four major {{principles}} currently underlie U.

These principles are embodied in federal law, the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) first codified in 1952. The Immigration Amendments of 1965 replaced the national origins quota system (enacted after World War I) with per-country ceilings. The Immigration Act of 1990 was the last law to significantly revise the statutory provisions on employment-based permanent immigration to the United States. The report opens with brief explanations of the employment-based preference categories and the per-country ceilings governing annual <b>admissions</b> <b>of</b> LPRs. The {{focus is on the}} five major employment-based preference categories. The report continues with a statistical analysis of the pending caseload of approved employment-based LPR petitions. The same analyses of approved pending employment-based petitions are performed on two different sets of data: approved pending petitions with the DOS National Visa Center; and approved pending petitions with USCIS, known by the petition number as the I- 485 Inventory. The report concludes with a set of legislative options to revise per-country ceilings that are meant to serve as springboards for further discussions...|$|R
40|$|Some of {{the most}} vexing and {{persistent}} questions in U. S. immigration policy involve whether and how to design programs to admit temporary workers. These questions often prompt disagreement, even among those who otherwise agree on many aspects of immigration law and policy. To address these questions, this Article starts with a brief overview <b>of</b> temporary worker <b>admissions</b> in U. S. immigration law today, and then summarizes the main points typically made by supporters and skeptics. It next identifies key questions {{for those who would}} design temporary worker programs. The main part of the Article then explains how analysis of temporary worker programs generally reflects some combination of four broad perspectives. One perspective evaluates temporary worker programs as a force in the U. S. economy that benefits many citizens and permanent residents but disadvantages others. A second perspective views <b>admission</b> <b>of</b> temporary workers not only in comparison to its traditional foil — <b>admission</b> <b>of</b> permanent <b>residents</b> — but also to immigration outside the law. A third perspective analyzes temporary worker admissions not only as a vital facet of immigration law, but also as essential to international economic development. A fourth perspective assesses temporary admissions in the context not just of immigration law, but also of citizenship, especially by looking at the integration of future generations. Comparing and evaluating these four perspectives can shed light on current debates by broadening and deepening analysis of temporary worker programs. Overall, the broad assessment provided by a balanced combination of these perspectives generally suggests cautious support for temporary worker programs, but only if they are carefully designed and coordinated with initiatives outside of immigration law. ...|$|R
50|$|Different {{programmes}} of IIMs follow different admission processes. <b>Admission</b> for <b>residents</b> <b>of</b> India to {{the flagship}} two-year PGP programmes at all IIMs {{is based on}} the Common Admission Test (CAT).

40|$|Introduction: the {{relationship}} between air pollution and hospital admissions has been well studied. In this study, {{the results of the}} Italian EpiAir Project are reported on the effect of air pollution on hospital admissions in 9 Italian cities during 2001 - 2005. The association between particulate matter (PM 10) and gases (NO 2 and O 3) and hospital admissions for cardiac, cerebrovascular, respiratory conditions, pulmonary embolism and diabetes has been evaluated. Material and methods: The study population consists of 701, 902 hospital <b>admissions</b> <b>of</b> subjects <b>residents</b> in nine Italian cities and hospitalized in the city in the period 2001 - 2005. We used a case-crossover approach and the statistical analysis considered the relevant temporal and meteorological factors for confounding adjustment. The results for ozone refer to the warm semester. The analysis of the association between air pollution and admissions was conducted for each city, and the city-specific estimates were meta-analyzed to obtain pooled results. Results: we found an immediate effect of PM 10 and NO 2 (lag 0) for cardiac diseases as a group and for specific conditions (coronary syndrome and heart failure). No effect of ozone was observed. For cerebrovascular diseases we did not observe a positive effect of the three pollutants. An effect of NO 2 on pulmonary embolism was detected. The association between air pollutants and hospitalization for respiratory diseases (respiratory infections, COPD and asthma) showed different lags for the three pollutants: the effect of PM 10 was immediate at lag 0 - 1 while the effects of NO 2 and ozone were prolonged at lag 0 - 5. The strongest association was between NO 2 and asthma admissions, especially in children. No effects on diabetes were found. Conclusions: the main {{results of the present study}} confirm the deleterious short term impact of air pollution on cardiovascular and respiratory morbidity in Italian cities...|$|R

However, ethnicity has generally not been well recorded in cancer registries in the UK. The {{aim of this study}} was to determine the completeness of ethnicity coding in the Thames Cancer Registry (TCR) database and within the Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) data as held by the London Health Observatory, and to investigate factors associated with ethnicity being recorded. Methods Records for 111821 hospital <b>admissions</b> <b>of</b> London <b>residents</b> with a malignant cancer as a primary diagnosis between April 2002 and March 2003 and records for 25581 London residents diagnosed with cancer in 2002 were examined. Data on sex, age, cancer network of residence, deprivation, proportion of non-whites in the local authority population, and site of cancer were available. The proportion of patients in each group with a valid ethnicity code was calculated. In the TCR data proportions were also calculated adjusted for all other variables. Results Ethnicity was recorded for 90661 (81. 1 %) <b>of</b> the hospital <b>admissions</b> in the HES data and 5796 (22. 7 %) patients on the TCR database. Patients resident in areas with a higher proportion <b>of</b> non-white <b>residents</b> and the most deprived populations were more likely to have an ethnic code on the TCR database, though this pattern was not seen in the HES data. Adjustment did not materially affect the association between deprivation and ethnicity being recorded in the TCR data. Conclusion There was a large difference in completeness of ethnicity between the data sources. In order to improve the level of recording in TCR data there needs to be better recording of ethnicity in sources TCR data collection staff have access to, or use of information from other sources e. g. electronic data feeds from hospitals or pathology laboratories, or HES data itself supplied directly to TCR. Efforts to collect ethnicity data should be encouraged in all healthcare settings. Future research should explore where the difficulties collecting ethnicity information lie, whether with patients, healthcare professionals or the recording procedure, and how such problems can be overcome. </p...|$|R

Material and methods: for each city, we performed descriptive analyses of mortality data included in the study. We considered subjects aged 35 + years old, resident and deceased within the cities in the study period (2001 - 2005) for non-accidental causes For each deceased subject, information were collected on hospital discharge diagnoses in the previous 2 -year period. Urgent hospital <b>admissions</b> <b>of</b> subjects <b>resident</b> in nine cities and hospitalized within the city for specific diseases (including cardiac, cerebrovascular and respiratory conditions) were also included as endpoints Annual mean raw death and hospitalization rates were calculated far each city. Results: 276205 deaths and 701, 902 urgent hospital admissions have been included in the study Annual mean crude death rates for non accidental tames in the population aged + 35 yrs resident and deceased in the municipalities ranged from 12 1 and 15. 7 per 1, 000 <b>residents.</b> the percentage <b>of</b> deceased subjects with {{at least one of the}} selected comorbidities ranged from 32 to 48 % Annual Mean crude urgent hospitalization rates in the resident population ranged from 5 5 to 11 7 per 1, 000 residents far cardiac diseases, 1 7 to 3 7 per 1, 000 residents for cerebrovascular diseases and 3 3 to 10 7 per 1, 000 residents for respiratory diseases.

40|$|The {{subject of}} the article is export {{processing}} zones of Bangladesh, which may become a sample for development of mechanic engineering in Russia. Export processing zone, {{as a kind of}} special economic zones, is a quite useful tool for the country's economy. They allow reaching a number of government objectives: increase employment, attract investment and enhance volume of collected taxes. In addition to the direct eff ect, the emergence of export processing zones has indirect impact on the economy by increasing purchases from suppliers by SEZ residents.  Providing tax and customs benefi ts to residents, the state puts companies outside the zones at a disadvantage. However, to counter this, state imposes restrictions on <b>admission</b> <b>of</b> products <b>of</b> <b>resident</b> companies on domestic market. These restrictions may relate to establishment either of a certain percentage of products that can be delivered freely on the internal market or share that can be delivered after payment of customs duties and taxes. The purpose of this work is to show the results of Bangladesh EPZs and to present basic directions of development for such zone specialized in mechanic engineering in Russia. The methodological base of the research is comparative analysis, cause-eff ect relationships, as well as historical method. In this article the author analyzes the experience of creation of export processing zones in Bangladesh, where they are suffi ciently proven: new jobs and enterprises have been created - investments to these zones account for a signifi cant share of total investments to the country. Moreover export of Bangladesh has increased signifi cantly. At the same time the goal for diversifying the country industry has not been met: textile is the main branch is in these zones. At the article the author points to the possibility of using this experience in Russia in terms of mechanic engineering. Availability of qualifi ed personnel, training base, transfer of production from Europe, weakened national currency, government's desire to diversify Russian export may be crucial to attract investments to such Russian zones. </p...|$|R
