5|$|Compton <b>and</b> <b>Evans</b> {{continued}} {{to resist the}} Australians on the final morning, the latter being the more aggressive, and proceedings were briefly interrupted by rain less than 30 minutes {{after the start of}} play. At the time, it appeared the downpour might cause the match to end in a draw. After half an hour of stoppages, play resumed <b>and</b> <b>Evans</b> attacked, hitting two fours in quick succession. England's wicket-keeper played Johnston and Johnson confidently, but Bradman nevertheless persisted in giving Compton easy singles in order to bring Evans on strike so he could be targeted. For his part, Compton thought his partner could be relied upon and accepted the runs gifted to him by the Australian captain, while Evans {{continued to}} attack the bowling. The batsmen appealed against the light after the first stoppage of the day, but were turned down. Australia took the new ball, but the home team's batsmen continued to proceed steadily, Evans being particularly aggressive. After a second interruption for poor light, this time for ten minutes, play resumed, and England had added a further 60 runs to their overnight total to reach 405/6.|$|E

5|$|On the February 3, 2016 {{episode of}} Lucha Underground, Mundo faced Killshot in a winning effort. After the match, Mundo taunted Lucha Underground Champion Mil Muertes, {{only to be}} confronted by Cage. Mundo {{defeated}} Cage on February 24, after interference from the debuting Taya, subsequently becoming Mundo's valet. On the May 25 episode of Lucha Underground, Taya revealed to PJ Black and Jack Evans that their partner Fénix was injured by Mundo. As Mundo revealed himself as Fénix's replacement for their match, Black <b>and</b> <b>Evans</b> allied with the two. Later {{that night in the}} main event, Mundo, Black <b>and</b> <b>Evans</b> defeated Rey Mysterio Jr., Prince Puma and Dragon Azteca Jr. to win the Lucha Underground Trios Championship, the first championship for each in Lucha Underground. The week after, Mundo, Black <b>and</b> <b>Evans,</b> now collectively billed as Worldwide Underground, retained their championships in a rematch via disqualification. During the match, Mundo delivered a low blow to Azteca Jr. while Taya distracted the referee. After seeing Mundo's actions, Puma hit a low blow to Mundo, causing a disqualification towards Puma's team. On the June 8 episode of Lucha Underground, Mundo teamed up with Taya, Ivelisse, Fénix, King Cuerno and Pentagón Jr. in a 12-man tag team match where the winning team would go on to face each other in a six-man elimination match to determine the No. 1 contender for the Lucha Underground Championship. Mundo's team won defeating Rey Mysterio Jr., Prince Puma, Sexy Star, The Mack, Son of Havoc and El Texano Jr. The week after, Mundo lost the six-man elimination match which was won by Pentagón Jr. Worldwide Underground lost their titles to Aero Star, Drago and Fénix at the third and final part Ultima Lucha Dos, which aired on July 20.|$|E

5|$|Travelling onwards through Dijon and Switzerland, Etty <b>and</b> <b>Evans</b> {{passed over}} the Simplon Pass and on to Milan, where they viewed Leonardo's The Last Supper and visited the Brera Gallery. After a sixteen-day {{cabriolet}} ride through the gruelling heat of an unusually hot summer, the two men reached Florence, where they stayed for two days visiting the city's galleries. On 10August, the two men finally reached Rome.|$|E
5|$|Two {{days after}} the release of the Parley version, Dickens sued on the cases of {{copyright}} infringement and won. The publishers declared themselves bankrupt and Dickens was left to pay £700 in costs. The small profits Dickens earned from A Christmas Carol further strained his relationship with his publishers, and he broke with them in favour of Bradbury <b>and</b> <b>Evans,</b> who had been printing his works to that point.|$|E
5|$|After several {{exhausting}} {{tours of}} Italy, the band split in 1972. They reformed in 1975, releasing Godbluff and frequently touring Italy again, before a major line-up change {{and a slight}} rename to Van der Graaf. The band split in 1978. After many years apart, the band finally united at a gig at the Royal Festival Hall and a short tour in 2005. Since then, the band has continued as a trio of Hammill, Banton, <b>and</b> <b>Evans,</b> who record and tour regularly in between Hammill's concurrent solo career.|$|E

5|$|After the {{collapse}} of the 2013 season, the coach met with Osvaldo Alonso, Clint Dempsey, <b>and</b> <b>Evans</b> since they were a core group of players. The group agreed on the aforementioned changes to the team. Starting striker Eddie Johnson was later traded while a new central defender, winger, midfielder, goalkeeper, and depth at the forward position were brought in. The team played 2014 with Dempsey and Obafemi Martins playing more through the middle as the Sounders won the US Open Cup and the Supporters Shield.|$|E
5|$|Evans {{started with}} Landells in 1840. His duties {{included}} delivering proofs of drawings {{to be approved}} by artists such as Edward Dalziel, or authors such as Charles Dickens. A year later, Landells launched Punch magazine, and as early as 1842 had Evans illustrate covers for the new publication. Evans worked and became friends with Myles Birket Foster, John Greenaway and George Dalziel. Foster <b>and</b> <b>Evans</b> became lifelong friends. When Landells received a commission from the Illustrated London News to provide illustrations of Queen Victoria and Prince Albert, he sent Evans and Foster to Balmoral to make sketches, which Evans engraved. Toward the end of his apprenticeship, the demands of the Illustrated London News caused Evans to work late into the night and return early in the morning.|$|E
5|$|Evans was {{the only}} member of the Apple entourage to be invited to attend (and be a witness) when McCartney and Linda Eastman were married at Marylebone Registry Office on 12 March 1969. Evans wrote in his diary that he was due to be there at 9.45am, but McCartney's brother, Michael's train from Birmingham was late. Peter Brown <b>and</b> <b>Evans</b> passed the {{register}} office at 9.15, and saw that there were only a few photographers and ardent fans standing in the rain, but when they left, after the wedding at 11.30am, they were mobbed by a crowd of about 1,000 people. When the Beatles played on the roof of Apple's offices in Savile Row, Evans was told to delay the policemen (who had arrived to stop the concert), as long as was possible.|$|E

5|$|Following {{the final}} orchestral crescendo, the song ends {{with one of}} the most famous final chords in music history. Overdubbed in place of the vocal {{experiment}} from 10 February, this chord was added during a session at EMI's Studio Two on 22 February. Lennon, McCartney, Starr <b>and</b> <b>Evans</b> shared three different pianos, with Martin on a harmonium, and all played an E-major chord simultaneously. The chord was made to ring out for over forty seconds by increasing the recording sound level as the vibration faded out. Towards the end of the chord the recording level was so high that listeners can hear the sounds of the studio, including rustling papers and a squeaking chair.|$|E
5|$|He {{returned}} to comics in 1965 doing one story each in Gold Key Comics' Ripley's Believe It or Not! #1 (June 1965), The Twilight Zone #12 (Aug. 1965), and Boris Karloff Tales of Mystery #11 (Sept. 1965), and helped launch Warren Publishing's black-and-white horror-comics magazines Creepy and Eerie with several stories in early issues, while contributing to Warren's war comics magazine Blazing Combat. He {{was instrumental in}} recruiting other former EC Comics artists as Frazetta, Krenkel, Torres, Crandall, <b>and</b> <b>Evans,</b> as well as artist Gray Morrow and writer-editor Archie Goodwin.|$|E
5|$|However, Evans {{may have}} overly {{emphasised}} a political {{interpretation of the}} sermon for his own political gain; the see of Derry had just opened <b>and</b> <b>Evans</b> wished to have his friend William Nicolson take the position. Evans' political intrigue provoked Swift during an inspection of the clergy of Meath at Trim. Swift, as vicar of Laracor spoke during a synod to defend himself, his sermons, and his politics, and instead of resolving the issue, only caused more dispute between the two.|$|E

5|$|In 1880, Crane {{illustrated}} <b>and</b> <b>Evans</b> printed, The Baby's Bouquet: a Fresh Bunch of Old Rhymes and Tunes, {{which went}} on to sell {{hundreds of thousands of}} copies. The book shows influences ranging from the Pre-Raphaelites, Japanese art to the incipient arts and crafts movement. In 1889, Flora's Feast: A Masque of Flowers was published, featuring flowers represented as human figures, for which Evans used as many as eight colour blocks. Their later collaborations includes an edition of Alice in Wonderland with coloured versions of John Tenniel's 1890 illustrations, and the 1899 A Floral Fantasy in an Old English Garden.|$|E
5|$|In 2012, Schott <b>and</b> <b>Evans</b> {{suggested}} that the regularity in squamosal ornamentation throughout the ontogeny of Stegoceras was consistent with species recognition, but the change from flat to domed frontoparietals in late age suggests that the function of this feature changed through ontogeny, and was perhaps sexually selected, possibly for intra-specific combat. In 2012, Caleb M. Brown and Anthony P. Russell {{suggested that}} the stiffened tails were probably not used as defence against flank-butting, but may have enabled the animals to take a tripodal stance during intra-specific combat, with the tail as support. Brown and Russell found that the tail could thereby help in resisting compressive, tensile, and torsional loading when the animal delivered or received blows with the dome.|$|E
5|$|Numerous notable riders {{were present}} in the race peloton, though their reasons for {{attending}} varied slightly. Top stage racers like Cadel Evans, Ivan Basso, Robert Gesink, Vincenzo Nibali, Joaquim Rodríguez, Andy Schleck, and Marco Pinotti were present. Evans' attendance was mainly for racing kilometers before attempting to win the Tour de France. Basso, who likewise planned to peak at the Tour de France, came to the race hoping for overall victory. He named Gesink as a potential rival, and Gesink for his part claimed Basso as a rider he fears. Schleck, Nibali, <b>and</b> <b>Evans</b> were named by one pre-race analysis as possible contenders, but not favorites, due to their plans to be at peak form later in the season.|$|E
