While {{it has been}} praised for its impressive graphics, memorable sound, <b>and</b> <b>responsive</b> controls, it {{has been criticized for}} its repetitive gameplay and complicated password system. It has since been considered a classic example of a multiple-genre game that set a standard for others such as the title Sigma Star Saga and incorporated gameplay elements from other titles such as The Legend of Zelda, Metroid, and 1942.|$|E
5|$|Attachments between {{infants and}} {{caregivers}} form {{even if this}} caregiver is not sensitive <b>and</b> <b>responsive</b> in social interactions with them. This has important implications. Infants cannot exit unpredictable or insensitive caregiving relationships. Instead they must manage themselves {{as best they can}} within such relationships. Based on her established Strange Situation Protocol, research by developmental psychologist Mary Ainsworth in the 1960s and 1970s found that children will have different patterns of attachment depending primarily on how they experienced their early caregiving environment. Early patterns of attachment, in turn, shape — but do not determine — the individual's expectations in later relationships.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to longitudinal studies, {{there has been}} psychophysiological research on the biology of attachment. Research has begun to include neural development, behaviour genetics and temperament concepts. Generally, temperament and attachment constitute separate developmental domains, but aspects of both contribute {{to a range of}} interpersonal and intrapersonal developmental outcomes. Some types of temperament may make some individuals susceptible to the stress of unpredictable or hostile relationships with caregivers in the early years. In the absence of available <b>and</b> <b>responsive</b> caregivers it appears that some children are particularly vulnerable to developing attachment disorders.|$|E

5|$|Within {{attachment}} theory, Bowlby, in Attachment and Loss, volume one of Attachment (1969), {{makes it}} quite clear that infants become attached to carers who are sensitive <b>and</b> <b>responsive</b> in their social interactions with them and that this {{does not have to}} be the mother or indeed a female. As a matter of social reality mothers are more often the primary carers of children and therefore are more likely to be the primary attachment figure, but the process of attachment applies to any carer and infants develop a number of attachments according to who relates to them and the intensity of the engagement. However, attachment theory relates to the development of attachment behaviours and relationships after about 7 months of age and there are other theories and research relating to earlier carer–infant interactions.|$|E
5|$|A new guitar {{controller}} {{was developed}} for Guitar Hero 5, sold with bundles with the game though the option for standalone versions {{has not yet been}} determined. Like other Guitar Hero controllers, the guitar-shaped unit features five colored fret buttons on the neck of the guitar, a strum bar to mimic the act of strumming, a whammy bar to alter the pitch of a note, and additional buttons specific to the game console for maneuvering through the game's menus. The unit is mostly a redesign of the World Tour model with a new red finish and includes the touchpad that is farther up the neck of the controller, allowing the player to play notes via tapping or to slide along its surface for specially marked sections on the note track. The Guitar Hero 5 unit features a more accurate <b>and</b> <b>responsive</b> touchpad due to it being tracked digitally and with added tactile responses, a more accurate strum bar, and a controller finish that makes it easier to handle with sweaty hands. The game remains compatible with previous Guitar Hero game controllers as well as those from Rock Band and selected other rhythm games.|$|E

5|$|The Selle Français is a French sport horse, now {{recognized}} internationally {{as a top}} breed for show jumping and three-day eventing. Selection criteria for breeding stock focuses on their jumping abilities. Show jumping is a technical sport, calling for lively <b>and</b> <b>responsive</b> yet powerful horses. Horses with more Thoroughbred blood in them have also been very competitive in three-day eventing, where speed and stamina are needed {{to be successful in}} all three portions (dressage, three-day eventing and show jumping) of the event. Thanks to these qualities, the Selle Français is seen on international show jumping and three-day eventing teams, both in France and elsewhere. In dressage, the Selle Français has gradually improved, but has faced stiff competition from northern European breeds, which often have more active gaits. In addition, many French breeders guide their horses to the more popular and profitable sport of show jumping, which sometimes deprives the dressage system of good horses. The World Breeding Federation for Sport Horses (WBFSH) ranks warmblood stud books based on their success in eventing, show jumping and dressage. In 2013, the ANSF was ranked as the 3rd best show jumping stud book in the world, topped only by the Dutch Warmblood and Belgian Warmblood breeds, and a Selle Français horse was ranked first in the world. The stud book was ranked at 6th in the world in eventing, with the top horse placed at 25th. The ANSF was ranked 19th in dressage, beaten by many of the more popular dressage breeds, including Dutch Warmbloods, Hanoverians and Westphalians.|$|E

40|$|Background and Objective: In recent years, {{there has}} been a growing {{interest}} in the interrelationships among obsessive- compulsive disorder, impulsivity, and serotonin and previous studies produced mixed results. This study aimed at investigating the comparison of impulsivity between <b>responsive</b> <b>and</b> non-responsive obsessive-compulsive patients to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). Subjects and Methods: In an ex post facto design, using Sadock and Sadock's (2007) definition, and through convenience sampling, 27 Obsessive-Compulsive patients were divided into two groups (<b>responsive</b> <b>and</b> non-responsive to SSRI) and were examined through 11 th Barratt Impulsivity Scale, Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale (symptom checklist), and Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV. Results: The mean scores of impulsivity and its components in responsive patients were higher in comparison with non responsive ones. Centroids of <b>responsive</b> <b>and</b> non <b>responsive</b> groups were significantly different regarding impulsivity, attentional, motor, and non-planning impulsiveness (p< 0. 009). Among the four variables, there were significant differences only in impulsivity (p< 0. 01), attention (p< 0. 01) <b>and</b> impulsiveness between <b>responsive</b> <b>and</b> non <b>responsive</b> groups (p < 0. 05). Conclusion: The findings of this research shows that there is a significant difference in impulsivity level between <b>responsive</b> <b>and</b> non-responsive obsessive-compulsive patients to SSRIs, and the mean score of impulsivity in non-responsive patients is higher. However, attending to some paradoxes in the literature, more researches are needed to provide a comprehensive theoretical explanation for the interrelationships among impulsivity,OCD, and responsivity to SSRIs.

25|$|Infants whose {{mothers are}} more {{sensitive}} {{are more likely to}} display secure attachment relationships. Because the maternal figure is generally accessible <b>and</b> <b>responsive</b> to the infant's needs, the infant is able to form expectations of the mother's behaviour. Once expectations are met and the infant feels a consistency in the mother's sensitivity, the infant is able to find security in the maternal figure. Those infants whose mothers do not respond to the signals from their children or respond inappropriately to their children's cries for attention will form insecure and anxious attachments because the infants are unable to consistently depend on the maternal figures for predictable and safe responses.|$|E
40|$|Decentralization {{is often}} hailed for moving govern-ment closer to its {{citizens}} and providing opportuni-ties {{for participation in}} decision making.

One mechanism intendedtomakedevelopmentplanning <b>and</b> management more <b>responsive</b> <b>and</b> account-able arises from what the World Bank has called community-driven development (CDD). A great deal of empirical evidence reveals that decentralization will not always achieve the goal of making local governments more <b>responsive</b> <b>and</b> accountable. They are often susceptible to elite cap-ture: that is, public decision making often reflects disproportionate influence by well-off and well-connected groups.
