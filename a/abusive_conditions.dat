500|$|In {{addition}} to legal scholars, the Supreme People's Court of the People's Republic of China had criticized the system. In {{light of the}} widespread disapproval of the system, HRIC called in 2001 for the system to be abolished entirely. [...] Among its criticisms it cited {{the fact that the}} wording of re-education through labor laws was excessively vague, allowing authorities to manipulate it; the fact that the punishment given in re-education centers was too severe for the crimes committed; the <b>abusive</b> <b>conditions</b> at re-education centers; and the variation of re-education through labor laws from one province to another. The Chinese Ministry of Justice, has also noted that the system violated items in the Chinese constitution. [...] Wang Gongyi, vice-director of the Institute of Justice Research affiliated to the Ministry of Justice, said that the re-education through labor system contradicts several items in the Constitution, the Criminal Procedure Law, and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, which China signed in 1998.|$|E

40|$|Internal {{short-circuit}} is {{the most}} dangerous <b>abusive</b> <b>condition</b> for Li-ion batteries and has been the root cause for several catastrophic accidents involving Li-ion batteries in recent years. Large-format Li-ion batteries are particularly vulnerable to internal short-circuits because of high energy content. Nail penetration test is commonly used to study the internal short-circuits, but the test results usually have poor reproducibility and offer limited insight. In this work, a 3 D multiscale electrochemical-thermal coupled model is used to investigate the nail penetration process in a large-format Li-ion cell. A parametric study is carried out and the results reveal strong coupling of the cell thermal response and electrochemical behaviour, which is influenced substantially by key parameters including shorting resistance, nail diameter, nail thermal conductivity, and cell capacity. The present study provides some insight that will help design more reliable experimental internal short-circuit testing protocols and improve the abuse tolerance of Li-ion cells. © The Author(s) 2014.

Since {{the establishment of the}} Bracero Program, America's guest worker programs have been accused of creating <b>abusive</b> working <b>conditions,</b> withholding payments, lowering wages for domestic farm workers, and providing inadequate incentives for workers to return to their home countries. Many trade associations, such as the Associated Builders and Contractors and the National Electrical Contractors Association, oppose guest worker programs because of their economic consequences, while labor groups, such as Laborers' International Union of North America, United Food and Commercial Workers International Union, and the International Brotherhood of Boilermakers, are sensitive to the American guest worker program's history of rights violations.|$|R

5000|$|Migrant {{domestic}} {{workers can}} become extremely {{dependent on their}} employers {{through all of the}} aforementioned risks. [...] In many cases, employers will withhold their immigration papers and confiscate their passports, which adds to their dependency and helplessness. This makes it difficult for migrant domestic workers to contact law enforcement officials in order to report <b>abusive</b> working <b>conditions.</b> Additionally, “the absence of work contracts and the fact that in many countries domestic employment is not recognized in labor legislation allows employers to impose working conditions unilaterally.” [...] Employers frequently consider their migrant domestic workers as their property or do not treat them as “proper” employees. [...] Sometimes their place of work is also their shelter, making migrant domestic workers dependent on their employers.|$|R

40|$|This policy brief aims {{to spark}} {{reflection}} on the conditions of domestic workers, {{and the importance of}} independent institutions like trade unions for protecting their rights. Drawing on conversations with domestic workers in Lima, Peru, it shows how particularly those who live with their employees are often subjected to maltreatment. Trade unions perform essential services by informing domestic workers of their labour rights, empowering them to demand these from their employers, and providing legal aid. Parallels are drawn to the au pair programme in Norway. Despite a comprehensive legal framework, au pairs may face similar problems associated with living in the home of the employer, with the additional insecurity of working and living in an unfamiliar country.
