The correlation between tightness and infiltration was determined using an empirically validated dynamic IDA-ICE simulation model of a two-storey detached house. The effect of wind conditions, Finnish climate conditions, balance of ventilation system and leakage distribution on infiltration were studied with the simulation model. According to the results, the <b>average</b> <b>infiltration</b> <b>rate</b> and heat energy consumption increase almost linearly with the building leakage rate n 50 of the building envelope.

Field experiments {{were conducted in}} Hsin-Pu of Hsin-Chu County, Taiwan, to measure the soil water content of various types of bund. Measurements revealed that the soil was unsaturated along the sloped surface of the terrace. Experimental results also indicated that seepage face flow did not develop even after 2 days of heavy rainfall. A three-dimensional model, FEMWATER, was adopted to simulate percolation and lateral seepage under various bund conditions. In a flat paddy, the rate of percolation of bunds under which a plow sole was located, was 0. 40 cm d 21, close to the <b>average</b> <b>infiltration</b> <b>rate</b> of a flooded paddy. The percolation of the bund without plow sole was 0. 85 cm d 21, or double the <b>average</b> <b>infiltration</b> <b>rate</b> of a flooded paddy. Infiltration in the central area of a terraced paddy is mainly vertically downward, whereas flow near the bund is predominantly lateral. The paddy field near the bund has a high hydraulic gradient. The simulated infiltration flux into the bund (1. 47 cm d 21) after 85 days of rice cultivation exceeded that into the central area (0. 54 cm d 21) {{by a factor of}} 2. 72. The final percolation flux from the bund (1. 24 cm d 21) also exceeded the final percolation from the plow sole (0. 68 cm d 21) by a factor of 1. 82. The lateral seepage fluxes through the bund, downward and upward along the slope surface, are 2. 01 and 22. 12 cm d 21, respectively.

Soil infiltration capacity plays a vital role in determining the inputs from precipitation and enhancing water storage, which are important for the maintenance and survival of vegetation patches in arid and semi-arid areas. Our study investigated the effects of different artificial grasslands on soil physical properties and soil infiltration capacity. The artificial grasslands were Medicago sativa, Astragalus adsurgens, Agropyron mongolicum, Lespedeza davurica, Bromus inermis, Hedysarum scoparium, A. mongolicum + Artemisia desertorum, A. adsurgens + A. desertorum and M. sativa + B. inermis. The soil infiltration capacity index (SICI), which was based on the <b>average</b> <b>infiltration</b> <b>rate</b> of stage I (AIRSI) and the <b>average</b> <b>infiltration</b> <b>rate</b> of stage III (AIRS III), was higher (indicating that the infiltration capacity was greater) under the artificial grasslands than that of the bare soil. The SICI of the A. adsurgens + A. desertorum grassland had the highest value (1. 48) and bare soil (0. 59) had the lowest value. It was evident that artificial grassland could improve soil infiltration capacity. We also used principal component analysis (PCA) to determine that the main factors that affected SICI were the soil water content at a depth of 20 cm (SWC 20), the below-ground root biomasses at depths of 10 and 30 cm (BGB 10, BGB 30), the capillary porosity at a depth of 10 cm (CP 10) and the noncapillary porosity at a depth of 20 cm (NCP 20). Our study suggests that the use of Legume-poaceae mixtures and Legume-shrub mixtures to create grasslands provided an effective ecological restoration approach to improve soil infiltration properties due to their greater root biomasses. Furthermore, soil water content, below-ground root biomass, soil capillary porosity and soil non-capillary porosity were the main factors that affect the soil infiltration capacity. <br style="orphans: 2; text-align: -webkit-auto; widows: 2;" /...|$|E

This research aims to determine 1) infiltration rate when the condition is not raining and the day condition is raining, 2) the influence of soil physical characteristic and vegetation against the infiltration rate, 3) the potential of Alun Kapuas Park to absorb rainwater. Infiltration rate measurement method uses double ring infiltrometer, then it is analyzed by the method of Horton.

Extensive studies on runoff from South Texas croplands and urban areas exist; however, little is known of the importance or impact of runoff generated from South Texas rangelands. Therefore, the objectives of this study are: (1) to assess the impacts of various rangeland management practices (grazing, herbicide treatment of the woody shrubs, and herbicide treatment of the shrubs followed by burning) on water yield and (2) to assess the impacts of various rangeland management practices on sediment loss and levels of nitrogen and phosphorus in runoff water. Three 1 -ha watersheds, WS 1 -HB (Herbicide and Burn), WS 2 -HERB (Herbicide), and WS 3 -UNT (Control-Graze only), were surveyed and installed on Chaparral-Mixedgrass Communities located on a Monteola soil on the Welder Wildlife Refuge near Sinton, Texas. Ten months following treatment, woody shrub canopy cover was reduced by 41 %, 60 %, and 10 % in WS 1, 2, and 3, respectively. Grass, forb, and litter standing crop increased in all 3 watersheds except for grass and forb standing crops in WS 1 -HB. <b>Average</b> <b>infiltration</b> <b>rates</b> for run 1 simulations were greater than 100 mm/hr except WS 3 -UNT brush plots (76 mm/hr).

Four soil textures of varying fineness (Loamy Sand, Loam, Silty Loam, and Sandy Loam) and three negative pressure values (0, – 5, and – 10 kPa) were used. As irrigation time increased, wetting front movement speeds decreased, and as negative pressure increased, wetting front size decreased. Coarse soils had the smallest wetting front under greater negative pressure. Next, water infiltration rate decreased as irrigation time increased, and coarse soils had the lowest <b>average</b> <b>infiltration</b> <b>rate</b> under greater negative pressure. Finally, salt content increased with distance from the irrigation emitter and with increased negative pressure. Further, coarse soils {{were found to have}} decreased desalination under greater negative pressure. Thus, soil texture has a strong effect on NPI efficiency.

We monitor infiltration dynamics at multiple scales (up to the scale of the entire pond) by measuring the ponding depth, sediment water content and groundwater levels, using pressure sensors, single-ring infiltrometers, soil sensors, and observation wells. During a month (January 2015) of continuous intensive MAR (2. 45  [*]×[*]  106  m 3 discharged to a 10. 7  ha area), groundwater level has risen by 17  m attaining full connection with the pond, while <b>average</b> <b>infiltration</b> <b>rates</b> declined by almost 2 orders of magnitude (from [*]∼[*]  11 to [*]∼[*]  0. 4  m d− 1). This reduction can be explained solely by the lithology of the unsaturated zone that includes relatively low-permeability sediments. Clogging processes at the pond-surface – abundant in many MAR operations – are negated by the high-quality desalinated seawater (turbidity [*]∼[*]  0. 2  NTU, total dissolved solids [*]∼[*]  120  mg L− 1) or negligible compared to the low-permeability layers.

It differs from the conventional concrete since it usually contains a smaller amount of fine aggregate. There is typically single size aggregate in pervious concrete which provides larger air void than conventional concrete to increase the <b>rate</b> of <b>infiltration.</b> Most jurisdictions have different pervious concrete mix designs. This research was aimed at developing and testing five design mixes of pervious concrete to identify the appropriate mix which would provide the maximum compressive strength with an acceptable permeability rate and flexural strength for the District of Columbia. The tests were conducted on the five design mixes using three different types of compaction methods (self-consolidating, half-rodding and Standard Proctor Hammer). Based on the results, a design mix with a compressive strength of 3, 500 {{pounds per square inch}} (psi) with a maximum coefficient of permeability of 57. 8 inches per hour (in/hr) was identified as the optimum.

Five different classifications of surfaces were tested with pavement ages ranging from six months to 21 years. Two sets of tests were run on 12 concrete grid pavers lots with sand. The initial test was on the existing condition of the surface and second test was run after the removal {{the top layer of}} residue (0. 5 - 0. 8 in. or 1. 3 - 1. 9 cm) to simulate maintenance. Maintenance improved the surface <b>infiltration</b> <b>rate</b> on 11 of 12 sites. The tests showed that maintenance improved surface-permeability at a confidence level of 97 %. The mean <b>average</b> surface <b>infiltration</b> <b>rate</b> increased from 2. 1 cfs/ac (2. 1 in. /hr), for existing conditions, to 3. 5 cfs/ac (3. 5 in. /hr) after maintenance. Ten permeable interlocking concrete pavements (PICP) sites were also tested. This study found that sites built in close proximity to loose fine particles had surface <b>infiltration</b> <b>rates</b> two orders of magnitude less than sites free of loose fines. Averages of each condition are 1. 7 cfs/ac (1. 7 in. /hr) and 900 cfs/ac (900 in. /hr) respectively. The report’s principal conclusion...|$|R
40|$|Two large hydrologic issues {{face the}} Kings Basin, severe and chronic {{overdraft}} of about 0. 16 M ac-ft annually, and flood risks along the Kings River and the downstream San Joaquin River. Since 1983, these floods have caused over 1 B in damage in today’s dollars. Capturing flood flows of sufficient volume could help address these two pressing issues which {{are relevant to}} many regions of the Central Valley and will only be exacerbated with climate change. However, the Kings River has high variability associated with flow magnitudes which suggests that standard engineering approaches and acquisition of sufficient acreage through purchase and easements to capture and recharge flood waters would not be cost effective. An alternative approach investigated in this study, termed On-Farm Flood Flow Capture, involved leveraging large areas of private farmland to capture flood flows for both direct and in lieu recharge. This study investigated the technical and logistical feasibility of best management practices (BMPs) associated with On-Farm Flood Flow Capture. The investigation was conducted near Helm, CA, about 20 miles west of Fresno, CA. The experimental design identified a coordinated plan to determine <b>infiltration</b> <b>rates</b> for different soil series and different crops; develop a water budget for water applied throughout the program and estimate direct and in lieu recharge; provide a preliminary assessment of potential water quality impacts; assess logistical issues associated with implementation; and provide an economic summary of the program. At check locations, we measured <b>average</b> <b>infiltration</b> <b>rates</b> of 4. 2 in/d for all fields and noted that <b>infiltration</b> <b>rates</b> decreased asymptotically over time to about 2 – 2. 5 in/d. Rates {{did not differ significantly}} between the different crops and soils tested, but were found to be about an order of magnitude higher in one field. At a 2. 5 in/d <b>infiltration</b> <b>rate,</b> 100 acres are required to infiltrate 10 CFS of captured flood flows. Water quality of applied flood flows from the Kings River had concentrations of COC (constituents of concern; i. e. nitrate, electrical conductivity or EC, phosphate, ammonium, total dissolved solids or TDS) one order of magnitude or more lower than for pumped groundwater at Terranova Ranch and similarly for a broader survey of regional groundwater. Applied flood flows flushed the root zone and upper vadose zone of nitrate and salts, leading to much lower EC and nitrate concentrations to a depth of 8 feet when compared to fields in which more limited flood flows were applied or for which drip irrigation with groundwater was the sole water source. In demonstrating this technology on the farm, approximately 3, 100 ac-ft was diverted, primarily from April through mid-July, with about 70...|$|R
40|$|Paper {{presented}} at ISMAR 7, Theme - Water Reuse and MAR, Abu Dhabi, UAE, 9 - 13 October 2010 A small-scale field experiment consisting of surface infiltration tests {{was conducted at}} Ban Nong Na, located in Bangrakum District, Phitsanulok Province, situated in the Lower Yom River Basin. The shallow groundwater in this area has been heavily pumped for growing rice all year round, and within the past decade static water levels within the gravel, sand and silt aquifers have decreased {{to a depth of}} up to ten meters below the ground surface. Research is currently being conducted to investigate the feasibility of managed aquifer recharge by surface ponding methods in the Lower Yom River Basin. This study, which forms one component of the broader project, aims to assess infiltration processes and clogging effects at the laboratory (column) scale and at the small scale (25 m 2) in the field. The laboratory experiment consisted of two main components: 1) physical, chemical and biological analyses of raw water and the ambient groundwater and 2) soil column testing under constant head conditions over a period of 100 hours. The field experiment consisted of three main components: 1) characterization of the physical and hydraulic properties of the unsaturated and saturated media 2) pretreatment design considering levels of turbidity removal using synthetic poly and sand filter, and 3) infiltration testing under constant head conditions over a period of 30 hours. These works are intended to provide the design criteria for establishing a larger scale (1, 600 m 2) pilot recharge system at the study site. <b>Average</b> <b>infiltration</b> <b>rates</b> for the laboratory experiment for source waters with mean turbidities of 0. 5 and 100 NTU were found to be 3. 27 and 0. 15 m/d respectively. The <b>infiltration</b> <b>rate</b> from the field experiment with an average turbidity 50 NTU was 2. 53 m/d; a magnitude commensurate with the lab study. Since <b>infiltration</b> <b>rates</b> in excess of 1 m/day are desirable for the pilot trial, the turbidity of the raw canal water used for recharge will be controlled to be less than 50 NTU. Whilst both the laboratory and field experiments were brief and longer test periods needed, more extensive investigations will be performed over the 2010 monsoon season during the full-scale pilot trial...|$|R
40|$|Pollutant {{transport}} in {{overland flow}} over surfaces with spatially varying microtopography, roughness, and infiltration was investigated using the diffusion wave equation and transport rate-based equation. The finite volume method {{in space and}} an implicit backward difference scheme in time were employed in the numerical solution of the 2 D governing equations. The developed model was first tested against an analytical solution and an experimental study involving overland flow and the associated pollutant transport, subsequently a series of numerical tests were carried out. Non-point source pollution was investigated under spatially varying microtopography, roughness, and infiltration. The simulation results showed that microtopography and roughness were the dominant factors causing significant spatial variations in solute concentration. When the spatially varying microtopography {{was replaced by a}} smooth surface, the result was an overestimation of the solute rate at the outlet of the upland. On the other hand, when the spatially varying roughness was replaced by the average roughness and spatially varying infiltration rate by the <b>average</b> <b>infiltration</b> <b>rate,</b> the pollutant discharge at the outlet of the upland was not significantly affected. The numerical results further showed that one cannot ignore the spatial variations of slope and roughness when investigating the local pollutant concentration distribution.

40|$|In {{this case}} study, the {{building}} infiltration rate and indoor aerosol concentration levels in two buildings equipped with passive house technology and a “conventional” house were investigated in Ócsa, Hungary. Blower-door tests {{were applied to}} estimate the <b>average</b> <b>infiltration</b> <b>rate</b> and particle induced X-ray emission (PIXE) {{analysis was used to}} characterize the elemental compositions of particle samples. We compared the change in mass concentration, mass size distribution and elemental composition of coarse and fine aerosol fraction in the selected buildings and outdoor sampling site. On the basis of the Blower-door test and our calculations the infiltration rate of the conventional building is approximately 8 - 19 times higher and the total air change rate is 2 - 3 times higher than those of the passive buildings. Nevertheless, the concentrations of particulate matter and the average of the indoor/outdoor ratios for coarse fraction aerosols (particles with aerodynamic diameter bigger than 2. 5 m) were higher in houses with passive house technology, indicating remarkable accumulation mechanism. On the basis of the mass size distribution, we found the filtration of the coarse size fraction is solved at the passive house. Furthermore, the fine size fraction containing combustion related elements (S, K, Pb, Zn) could be transported with outdoor air through the ventilation system. In these cases the effectiveness of removing contamination through infiltration and window opening are comparable to the effectiveness through mechanical ventilation. Without realizing the effective filtration possibilities of the ventilation system, the indoor air quality cannot be improved even in passive houses. ...|$|E

Thinning is a crucial practice in the forest ecosystem management. The soil infiltration rate and water storage capacity of pine-oak mixed forest under three different thinning intensity treatments (15 %, 30 %, and 60 %) were studied in QinlingMountains of China. The thinning operations had a significant influence on soil infiltration rate and water storage capacity. The soil infiltration rate and water storage capacity in different thinning treatments followed the order of control (nonthinning) : < 60 %, < 15 %, and < 30 %. It demonstrated that thinning operation with 30 % intensity can substantially improve soil infiltration rate and water storage capacity of pine-oak mixed forest in Qinling Mountains. The soil initial infiltration rate, stable infiltration rate, and <b>average</b> <b>infiltration</b> <b>rate</b> in thinning 30 % treatment were significantly increased by 21. 1 %, 104. 6 %, and 60. 9 %, compared with the control. The soil maximal water storage capacity and noncapillary water storage capacity in thinning 30 % treatment were significantly improved by 20. 1 % and 34. 3 % {{in contrast to the}} control. The soil infiltration rate and water storage capacity were significantly higher in the surface layer (0 ∼ 20 cm) than in the deep layers (20 ∼ 40 cm and 40 ∼ 60 cm). We found that the soil property was closely related to soil infiltration rate and water storage capacity. 1...|$|E
40|$|This study {{evaluated}} {{the effectiveness of}} chiselling and elemental sulfur fertilization in improving an upland and a swale range site with fine loamy, carbonatic, typic calcixeroll soils in the Ait Rbaa Perimeter of central Morocco. Ponding infiltration, soil water content on a mass basis of the 0 - to 10 -cm and 10 - to 20 -cm soil layers, peak season biomass production, and botanical composition were monitored during the two growing seasons following the treatments (1984 / 85 and 1985 / 86). Chiselling significantly improved infiltration on both sites, although the improvement was greater on the finer and less stony swale site, where chiselling resulted in more stable ridges. The land treatment also increased the average water content by weight of the 0 - to 20 -cm soil layer. The increase was more frequent on the upland site and most pronounced on its o- to 10 -cm surface soil layer. In the chiselled treatments, average soil water content decreased with soil depth on the upland site while it increased on the swale site because of differential furrow stability and soil texture. Both the <b>average</b> <b>infiltration</b> <b>rates</b> of 5 cm of water and the average water content varied with sampling time, although generally in opposite directions. The application of elemental sulfur at the rates of 0, 30, and 60 kg ha- 1 did not significantly affect any of the measured variables. Average peak season biomass production was 11 % greater with chiselling. Chiselling also positively affected botanical composition on the upland site by depressing average forb proportion and increasing legume ratio in the first growing season. The gain in biomass {{does not seem to}} be high enough to strongly recommend chiselling in the Ait Rbaa Perimeter before performing an economic analysis of the operation...|$|R
40|$|Inflow and {{infiltration}} is {{a phenomenon}} in sewerage systems that can have negative effects {{on the environment and}} human health if not treated properly. Collaboration has been made between Universiti Malaysia Pahang (UMP) and Indah Water Konsortium Sdn. Bhd. (IWK) where the purpose is to evaluate the amount of inflow and infiltration happening in sewerage systems of residential areas in Kuantan. For this part of the study, one sewer pipeline (MH 92 a–MH 92 b) was selected at the residential area of Bandar Putra, having a population equivalent of 1694. The method used in this research was the Flowrate method to tabulate data. ISCO 2150 and 4250 Area Velocity Flowmeters were used to measure flow rate data in the sewer pipeline, whereas ISCO 674 Rain Gauge was used to collect rainfall intensity data. Calibration of all the equipment was done at the Hydrology and Hydraulic Laboratory in UMP. The data was collected for 41 days with each measurement separated by an interval of five minutes. The result shows that the <b>average</b> percentage <b>Infiltration</b> <b>Rate</b> of Qpeak and Qave in this residential catchment were 10. 3 % and 26. 5 % which is higher than the value mentioned in Hammer and Hammer (2012). Inflow and infiltration is a real concern, so more study is required to determine whether revision of the <b>infiltration</b> <b>rate</b> recommended in the Malaysian Standard is needed...|$|R

The impact of land applying aerobically digested (ArD) and anaerobically digested (AnD) biosolids and beef cattle manure (BCM) to restore marginal rangelands was evaluated in the current study. While an average dry matter yield of 84. 1 lbs/acre was recorded for rangeland control plots, the dry matter yield for rangeland plots receiving ArD, AnD and BCM ranged from 129. 0 to 664. 1 lbs/acre. Forage grown on biosolids-amended rangelands showed maximum crude protein contents of 19. 67 %, 15. 26 % and 14. 22 % for ArD, AnD and BCM {{land application}} sites, respectively, compared to 10. 15 % for the control plots. Field tests indicated an <b>average</b> moisture <b>infiltration</b> <b>rate</b> of 7. 07 cm/hr for control plots compared {{to a maximum of}} 7. 14, 9. 98 and 9. 56 cm/hr in plots receiving ArD, AnD and BCM, respectively.
