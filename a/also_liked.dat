5|$|In a {{retrospective}} review, Jeuxvideo.com had high {{praise for the}} level design, graphics, and animations. They also found the music excellent {{in comparison to the}} annoying and repetitive soundtrack of most Breakout clones. The magazine <b>also</b> <b>liked</b> how the game fit the Kirby universe, apart from its increased difficulty—Jeuxvideo.com occasionally had trouble hitting the slow-paced ball with precision.|$|E
5|$|Gervais' {{performance}} has been praised by critics, being listed {{as one of}} the best guest appearances on The Simpsons by writers for Entertainment Weekly and The Times. Groening <b>also</b> <b>liked</b> the performance and invited Gervais to appear on the show again. The episode as a whole, however, received mixed reviews from critics. A live-action remake of the regular animated opening sequence of The Simpsons aired at the beginning of the episode.|$|E
5|$|Molyneux was {{impressed}} with the creature's navigation code: he stated that it is the largest piece of code, and that players could change the map repeatedly and creatures will still find routes to their destinations. Molyneux <b>also</b> <b>liked</b> the fact that the game adapts to the player, enabling the choice of the preferred methods and strategies, and stated that his favourite part of the game is how the player digs out rather than build up, meaning the player has heavy involvement in building the level. He stated that he was proud of Dungeon Keepers concept, but remarked that doing original things takes time. He <b>also</b> <b>liked</b> that people were unable to describe Dungeon Keeper in any particular way. Molyneux disliked the user interface, saying the team overdid the control panel, and commented that it was a reminder that the player was playing a video game. This was a key reason the user interface of his next video game, Black & White, did not feature panels, buttons, or icons.|$|E

5|$|Throughout {{the writing}} process, several cast members would give {{suggestion}} notes to the writers {{on how to}} improve some scenes. The writers were frequently annoyed with Armitage, who gave out more notes than any other cast members, however the writers <b>also</b> <b>liked</b> some of his ideas and included them in the scripts. The producers believed that the seventh series was among the more brutal than the others, citing the violent death of Ben.|$|E

5|$|As Ko and Aoba {{enter their}} summer break, {{a girl named}} Akane Takigawa with a {{striking}} resemblance to Wakaba moves in next door to Ko. This causes mixed feelings among the various characters, particularly Ko, Aoba, and Akaishi (who had <b>also</b> <b>liked</b> Wakaba). Akane soon becomes friends with Ko and Tsukishimas, and begins working in the Tsukishima cafe. As another year begins, the romantic subplots further solidify when Yūhei expresses an interest in Aoba. Meanwhile, Seishu gains a new assistant coach in the form of Yūhei's older brother Junpei, after Ichiyo agrees to marry him if Seishu makes it to Koshien.|$|E
5|$|At the time, prison-based {{films were}} not {{considered}} likely box office successes, but Darabont's script was read by then-Castle Rock Entertainment producer Liz Glotzer, whose interest in prison stories, and reaction to the script, led her to threaten to quit if Castle Rock did not produce The Shawshank Redemption. Director and Castle Rock co-founder Rob Reiner <b>also</b> <b>liked</b> the script. He offered Darabont between $2.4 million and $3 million {{to allow him to}} direct it himself. Reiner, who had previously adapted King's novella The Body into the 1986 film Stand by Me, planned to cast Tom Cruise as Andy and Harrison Ford as Red.|$|E
5|$|Edward had {{a normal}} {{upbringing}} for {{a member of}} a royal family. The prince was interested in horses and horsebreeding, and became a good rider; he <b>also</b> <b>liked</b> dogs, in particular greyhounds. In his letters, he shows a quirky sense of humour, joking about sending unsatisfactory animals to his friends, such as horses who disliked carrying their riders, or lazy hunting dogs too slow to catch rabbits. He was not particularly interested in hunting or falconry, both popular activities in the 14th century. He enjoyed music, including Welsh music and the newly invented crwth instrument, as well as musical organs. He did not take part in jousting, either because he lacked the aptitude or because he had been banned from participating for his personal safety, but he was certainly supportive of the sport.|$|E

5|$|Items {{from the}} TV series such as multi-perspective screens (as {{shown on the}} box cover) were popular for {{illustrating}} multiple viewpoints of an objective. The use of episode start and end graphics to mark the start and end of missions was <b>also</b> <b>liked.</b> The script was generally described as being a redeeming feature of the game, although fans of the series may find that the viewpoints, motives and reasoning of the villains isn't covered well. Cutscenes were singled out for particular praise by IGN, highlighting good use of camera angles and tight focus. Voice acting was generally popular, although some lines suffered from poor direction or emphasis. In contrast, device and ambiance sounds were well received with gunfire getting a particular mention.|$|E
5|$|Nickell, Pederson, and Rossow {{looked for}} effects with {{significant}} years. They asked 83 undergraduate students to rate, {{on a scale}} from 1 to 7, how much they liked the years between 1976 and 2001, the months of the year, the seasons, times of day, and even types of pet in an attempt to disguise the aim of the study. Analysis of the data showed that participants liked the year of their birth much more than the average of the four years after they were born. The researchers also found that the year of high school graduation was <b>also</b> <b>liked</b> better than average. Of the months of the year, the most liked month was the one in which the participants were born.|$|E
5|$|As her fame grew, Coffin {{gained the}} {{opportunity}} to put her design principles into practice on a larger scale. Her practice had grown large {{enough for her to}} need an assistant by 1911, and by 1918 she had moved her office to larger premises at 830 Lexington Avenue. She also took on James Scheiner, an architect, as an associate. He became a key part of Coffin's practice, working on large-scale tasks such as overseeing work on the ground. This in turn opened up new opportunities for her to take on new, larger commissions. Coffin insisted on being paid the same fees as a male architect and to be treated equally in contracts; this was a novelty in itself, at a time when women were usually paid less than men. She <b>also</b> <b>liked</b> to employ women to work with her on commissions, giving them the chance to undertake apprenticeships that male prejudice had denied her when she had first started on her career.|$|E

5|$|Following Hendrix's {{arrival in}} London, Chandler began {{recruiting}} members for a band designed {{to highlight the}} guitarist's talents, the Jimi Hendrix Experience. Hendrix met guitarist Noel Redding at an audition for the New Animals, where Redding's knowledge of blues progressions impressed Hendrix, who stated that he <b>also</b> <b>liked</b> Redding's hairstyle. Chandler asked Redding {{if he wanted to}} play bass guitar in Hendrix's band; Redding agreed. Chandler then began looking for a drummer and soon after, he contacted Mitch Mitchell through a mutual friend. Mitchell, who had recently been fired from Georgie Fame and the Blue Flames, participated in a rehearsal with Redding and Hendrix where they found common ground in their shared interest in rhythm and blues. When Chandler phoned Mitchell later that day to offer him the position, he readily accepted. Chandler also convinced Hendrix to change the spelling of his first name from Jimmy to the exotic looking Jimi.|$|E
5|$|Critics {{have noted}} Allen's {{interactions}} with other characters during the series, and IGN's Richard Osborn enjoyed the comic relief of his clashes with Kanda against the series' dark plot. John Rose of the Fandom Post considered {{the team of}} Allen and fellow Exorcist Yu Kanda the greatest strength of the manga's second volume. In a later review, Rose enjoyed the plotline in which Allen was unable to distinguish innocents from Akumas. Allen's rematch with enemy Noah Tyki Mikk was praised by Casey Brienza of Anime News Network. Brienza <b>also</b> <b>liked</b> his new abilities, the Innocence Crown Clown and Allen's sword, comparing it to a sword in Final Fantasy VII wielded by protagonist Cloud Strife. Reviewing the same fight, Otaku USAs Joseph Luster praised Allen's development during the series and enjoyed his battle with Tyki. Leroy Douresseaux of Comic Book Bin liked Allen's situation in volume 21, and wanted {{to see more of}} the same instead of the focus on Kanda's fight against the Akuma of Alma Karma. During Allen's imprisonment for saving Alma, Anne Lauenroth of Anime News Network found the growing camaraderie between Allen and Tyki interesting; it led to Allen's decision to leave the Order after putting his comrades in danger, and his goodbye to Lenalee was mournful.|$|E
5|$|From there, Wheeler {{was invited}} to direct a Society of Antiquaries {{excavation}} at the Roman settlement of Verulamium, which existed on land recently acquired by the Corporation of St Albans. He took on this role for four seasons from 1930 to 1933, before leaving a fifth season of excavation {{under the control of}} the archaeologist Kathleen Kenyon and the architect A. W. G. Lowther. Wheeler enjoyed the opportunity to excavate at a civilian as opposed to military site, and <b>also</b> <b>liked</b> its proximity to his home in London. He was particularly interested in searching for a pre-Roman Iron Age oppidum at the site, noting that the existence of a nearby Catuvellauni settlement was attested to in both classical texts and numismatic evidence. With Wheeler focusing his attention on potential Iron Age evidence, Tessa concentrated on excavating the inside of the city walls; Wheeler had affairs with at least three assistants during the project. After Tessa wrote two interim reports, the final excavation report was finally published in 1936 as Verulamium: A Belgic and Two Roman Cities, jointly written by Wheeler and his wife. The report resulted in the first major published criticism of Wheeler, produced by the young archaeologist Nowell Myres in a review for Antiquity; although stating that there was much to praise about the work, he critiqued Wheeler's selective excavation, dubious dating, and guesswork. Wheeler responded with a piece in which he defended his work and launched a personal attack on both Myres and Myres's employer, Christ Church, Oxford.|$|E
