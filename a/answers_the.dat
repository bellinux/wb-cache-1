5|$|The Frontline is {{a topical}} debate {{television}} series in Ireland, which aired for 60 minutes every Monday night on RTÉ One at 22:30. It debuted on Monday, 21 September 2009. The Frontline replaced a similar political analysis show Questions and <b>Answers.</b> <b>The</b> programme features around an invited audience and featured guests.|$|E
5|$|Contestants {{are given}} a series of lifelines to aid them with {{difficult}} questions. They can use as many lifelines as desired per question, but each lifeline can only be used once per game. Three lifelines {{are available from the}} start of the game. Depending on the format of the show, additional lifelines may become available after the contestant correctly <b>answers</b> <b>the</b> fifth or tenth question. In the clock format, usage of lifelines temporarily paused the clock while the lifelines were played.|$|E
50|$|Each {{question}} {{gives the}} contestant three opportunities to answer: <b>answering</b> <b>the</b> question alone, <b>answering</b> <b>the</b> question {{with an additional}} clue to <b>the</b> <b>answer,</b> and <b>answering</b> <b>the</b> question {{with a choice of}} two answers.|$|R
50|$|An {{answer to}} either set of {{questions}} {{will allow us to}} devise a means of <b>answering</b> <b>the</b> other. <b>Answering</b> <b>the</b> former question set first is called particularism, whereas <b>answering</b> <b>the</b> latter set first is called methodism. A third solution is skepticism, which proclaims that since one cannot have an <b>answer</b> to <b>the</b> first {{set of questions}} without first <b>answering</b> <b>the</b> second set, and one cannot hope to <b>answer</b> <b>the</b> second set of questions without first knowing <b>the</b> <b>answers</b> to <b>the</b> first set, we are, therefore, unable to answer either. This has the result of our being unable to justify any of our beliefs.|$|R
30|$|In this section, we {{describe}} the available datasets, our data preparation steps and present our analysis. We use explanatory linear regression models to <b>answer</b> <b>the</b> first RQ, correlation analysis to <b>answer</b> <b>the</b> second RQ, and evaluate predictive models to <b>answer</b> <b>the</b> third RQ.|$|R

5|$|Each episode {{consists}} of three rounds. A team of four contestants starts the game; one player is eliminated after two rounds of play. For each question, the team has 60 seconds to unanimously agree on an answer; the available money decreases the longer it takes. Each contestant must enter the same response on their respective panel and then everyone must simultaneously lock in an answer and stop the clock. If the team <b>answers</b> <b>the</b> question correctly, they bank whatever money is left on the clock; if they are wrong, or if time runs out, their bank is reduced by half.|$|E

In November 2009, the viewership was reduced to 333,000, less than the 493,000 received by The Apprentice on TV3 When George Lee appeared on the programme explaining his resignation from politics on 8 February 2010, the viewing figures were at 627,000.|$|E

5|$|In this bonus round, {{each member}} of the winning team plays the same {{question}} individually. While the first contestant is asked the question, the second is isolated offstage so that they cannot see or hear the question. The two teammates have a total of 40 seconds to answer (in seasons 1 and 2, the time limit was 30 seconds); the clock stops when the first contestant submits an answer, and resumes when the second contestant first sees the question. If one team member <b>answers</b> <b>the</b> question correctly, they receive an additional $1,000; if both answer correctly, their winnings are augmented to $10,000.|$|E

Harry tells Adrian that he, his friend Tony (whose left arm is in a sling) and several others survived the megatsunami and are shipwrecked on an island.

Lilly says that she sees an island, and the ark finds the shipwrecked cruise ship Genesis and her survivors on a beach.|$|E
5|$|Critics were {{generally}} favorable towards Brain Age 2, which received aggregated scores of 77% from Metacritic and 79.04% from GameRankings.

The rules were exactly the same as they were for a normal million dollar {{question}} under the clock format introduced the season before, except here, the contestants had no lifelines at their disposal. Each contestant received a base time of 45 seconds.

Stevie heads to the bathroom to get Tom's medication, but freezes when he sees the corpse of Migg in the bath. Tom tells him not to worry, and that Migg is not real.

5|$|Though these {{measures}} were established to counter {{many of the}} irrationalities in the Soviet economic system, the reform {{did not try to}} change the existing system radically; it instead tried to improve it gradually. Success was ultimately mixed, and Soviet analyses on why the reform failed to reach its full potential have never given any definitive <b>answers.</b> <b>The</b> key factors are agreed upon, however, with blame being put on the combination of the recentralisation of the economy with the decentralisation of enterprise autonomy, creating several administrative obstacles. Additionally, instead of creating a market which in turn would establish a pricing system, administrators were given the responsibility for overhauling the pricing system themselves. Because of this, the market-like system failed to materialise. To make matters worse, the reform was contradictory at best. In retrospect, however, the Eighth Five-Year Plan as a whole is considered {{to be one of the}} most successful periods for the Soviet economy, and the most successful for consumer production.|$|E

Bonus cash is given to the three contestants who <b>answer</b> <b>the</b> questions correctly in the shortest amount of time. <b>Answering</b> <b>the</b> Whammy question incorrectly causes the contestant to lose any money accumulated to that point.|$|R
5|$|Three {{days before}} the 1995 Illinois state competition, Steinmetz High School {{obtained}} copies of the tests from the DeVry Institute of Technology, where the state finals were being held. The team was therefore able to look up and memorize the <b>answers.</b> <b>The</b> cheating allowed Steinmetz to beat perennial powerhouse Whitney Young Magnet High School, who had won the Illinois state finals in 22 of the previous 23 years. Six of the twelve students in the nation who scored over 900 points on the math test came from Steinmetz High School, prompting the Illinois state Academic Decathlon to suspect cheating. The Steinmetz team was disqualified after team members refused to take an alternate version of the test, and its coach eventually resigned. The incident was dramatized in the movie Cheaters.|$|E

Scully <b>answers</b> <b>the</b> phone, and {{the person on the}} other line, who sounds just like her dead sister Melissa, tells her that someone needs her help. Scully traces the call to a nearby home in San Diego where a group of cops are investigating the suicide of a woman, Roberta Sim. The lead detective, Kresge, tells Scully that it was impossible for Roberta to have dialed, as she died before the telephone call was made. That night after dinner Scully reveals to her mother that due to her abduction and cancer she is unable to bear children. Scully flashes back to when as a child, she hid her pet rabbit from her brother in a lunchbox, only for it to suffocate and die. Scully receives another telephone call from the same person on her cell phone, which was once again made from the Sim home. Roberta's husband, Marshall, is meeting with two dark-suited men inside his house and has no desire to listen to and help Scully figure out what is going on.|$|E
