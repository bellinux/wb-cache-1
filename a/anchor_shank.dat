The SUHR collaborated with the SA Government and the Kangaroo Island Scuba Club {{to carry out the}} recovery. Assistance to the project was also provided by another 23 government agencies, private organisations and individuals. On 31 March 1980, an <b>anchor</b> <b>shank</b> was recovered from the wreck site followed by its stock on 1 April. Both parts were temporarily stored in the waters of West Bay for eventual collection and transfer by the fishing vessel, Lady Buick, to Kingscote respectively during April and May 1980. The shank and the stock were then respectively conveyed to Port Adelaide on MV Troubridge and on HMAS Banks. Conservation was carried out by Amdel in Adelaide. The conserved anchor was returned to Kangaroo Island where it was placed on display at the Flinders Chase Homestead in the Flinders Chase National Park, following a formal ceremony on 26 March 1982 attended by David Wotton, the SA Minister of Environment and Planning.|$|E
