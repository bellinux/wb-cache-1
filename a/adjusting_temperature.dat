Expensive strategies are currently used by manufacturers {{to slow down the}} reactions in order to avoid a strong temperature increase which could dramatically affect the purity of the final product.

Therefore, within the concept of process intensification, miniaturisation of the process is considered to reduce the technology constraints to the benefit of chemistry. On that purpose, a two-step methodology is implemented to move towards a more sustainable sulfonation process.

Therefore, temperature especially inner temperature difference or deformation of structures must be controlled or regulated sometimes {{in order to reduce}} thermal stresses or excessive deformation and to extend the life-span of structures. In this paper, the electro-thermal effects of smart cement are used to <b>adjust</b> <b>temperature</b> difference or deformation of concrete beams without the need of peripheral non-structural materials. Concrete beams for temperature and deformation adjustment were fabricated, and some experimental results as well as the related conclusions about temperature difference and deformation were produced.

The research results in this paper are the bases of temperature and deformation adjustment for mass concrete structures.

40|$|This work {{analyzes}} several {{drift compensation}} mechanisms in {{wireless sensor networks}} (WSN). Temperature is an environmental factor that greatly affects oscillators shipped in every WSN mote. This behavior creates the need of improving drift compensation mechanisms in synchronization protocols. Using the Flooding Time Synchronization Protocol (FTSP), this work demonstrates that crystal oscillators are affected by temperature variations. Thus, the influence of temperature provokes a low performance of FTSP in changing conditions of temperature. This article proposes an innovative correction factor that minimizes the impact of temperature in the clock skew. By means of this factor, two new mechanisms are proposed in this paper: the <b>Adjusted</b> <b>Temperature</b> (AT) and the Advanced <b>Adjusted</b> <b>Temperature</b> (A 2 T). These mechanisms have been combined with FTSP to produce AT-FTSP and A 2 T-FTSP. Both have been tested in a network of TelosB motes running TinyOS. Results show that both AT-FTSP and A 2 T-FTSP improve the average synchronization errors compared to FTSP and other temperature-compensated protocols (Environment-Aware Clock Skew Estimation and Synchronization for WSN (EACS) and Temperature Compensated Time Synchronization (TCTS)) ...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: We {{report a}} {{hydrothermal}} reaction to make t-selenium nanotubes, {{in the absence}} of a surfactant or polymer to direct nanoparticle growth, and without externally added forces (such as ultrasonic). A series of electron microscopy characterization results suggest that the growth of t-selenium nanotubes is governed by a nucleation-dissolution-recrystallization growth mechanism. In this mechanism, t-selenium nanoparticles were initially formed in the hydrothermal system, then the t-selenium nanoparticles started to dissolve into the solution and grow onto large nanoparticles of selenium, and spherelike microparticles were obtained. The spherelike microparticles then gradually dissolved to generate selenium atoms in the solution; these selenium atoms were renewedly transferred onto the surfaces of the spherelike microparticles and were recrystallized. Along with the dissolution-recrystallization process, the spherelike microparticles gradually evolved into novel groovelike nanostructures. The nanogrooves could grow along the circumferential direction and the tuber axis direction until all spherelike microparticles had been completely consumed, eventually growing into t-selenium nanotubes. Studies found that this growth mechanism is strongly affected by temperature and concentrations of NaOH. By <b>adjusting</b> <b>temperature</b> and concentrations of NaOH, t-selenium nanotubes, nanowires, microrods, porous microtubes, and polyhedrons can be synthesized, respectively. 1...|$|E
