500|$|Author Bill Martin {{recognises}} the Beatles and the Beach Boys as {{the most}} significant contributors {{to the development of}} progressive rock, transforming rock from dance music into music that was made for listening to. Citing a quantitative study of tempos in music from the era, musicologist Walter Everett identifies the Beatles' 1965 album Rubber Soul as a work that was [...] "made more to be thought <b>about</b> <b>than</b> danced to", and an album that [...] "began a far-reaching trend" [...] in its slowing-down of the tempos typically used in pop and rock music. Upon release, the Beach Boys' 1966 album Pet Sounds was hailed by British newspapers as [...] "the most progressive pop album ever". Clevelands Troy Smith believes that the album [...] "established the group as forefathers of progressive pop, right from the beginning chords of 'Wouldn't It Be Nice', a Wall of Sound style single".|$|E
500|$|MTV {{was first}} to name Lopez {{as one of the}} many {{performers}} to take to the stage at the 2009 American Music Awards. which aired on November 22, 2009. She later confirmed this on a KIIS-FM interview with DJ SKEE, saying that the performance would debut her new single, [...] "Louboutins". The performance took on a boxing theme, and featured famous ring announcer Michael Buffer introducing Lopez to the stage. Lopez performed in a boxing-like outfit and had a costume change halfway through the performance. The performance began in the ring and ended with Lopez walking through the audience. However the performance did not go as planned when the choreographed [...] "dramatic stunt of climbing up a human pyramid of semi-naked male dancers" [...] went wrong. [...] "She lost her balance after jumping off a dancer's back, and landed on her derriere." [...] In E! Online's [...] "Top Five Worst Concert Diggers", Lopez's fall was ranked at number five. However, according to The Daily Mail Natalie Trombetta, Lopez responded in a professional way, [...] "ever the professional, Jennifer quickly recovered her poise and carried on with the show." [...] Close friend and American TV presenter Ryan Seacrest, agreed calling it [...] "the greatest recovery ever!" [...] According to MTV, [...] "the tumble was edited out of the West Coast feed of the show, out of respect for Lopez, by the show's producers". Becky Bain of 'Idolator' suggested that the tumble was more talked <b>about</b> <b>than</b> the actually single itself, which was confirmed when MTV reported {{that it was one of}} the most searched things on the internet. After the incident will.i.am praised Lopez for being a true entertainer. [...] "That shows she's a true entertainer and devoted, She came out of it and still rocked it. It doesn't matter how you fall– just how you get up. She got up." ...|$|E
500|$|Observing {{similarities}} between the character and herself, Rashad described Clair as [...] "a warm, loving mother"; the actress is also similar in both appearance and personality to Camille. Rashad's acting had always been more straight-faced to counter Cosby's humor, typically playing straight woman to Cosby's comedic antics. In preparation for the second season, Cosby decided to provide Rashad with more comedic material upon learning that the actress is [...] "capable of handling comedy on her own–without Cliff." [...] Jets Robert E. Johnson observed that Rashad portrays her character using [...] "soft, sophisticated humor". The sixth season episode [...] "Off to See the Wretched", in which Clair scolds Vanessa for traveling to Baltimore to see a rock concert against her parents' orders, features Rashad's most [...] "uncontrolled" [...] performance as the character. Speaking fondly of his co-star, Cosby said [...] "There's nobody whom I can be more thankful <b>about</b> <b>than</b> Phylicia." [...] In {{the aftermath of a}} highly publicized article originally published in TV Guide before the series premiered that labeled Cosby [...] "one of the most arrogant celebrities", Rashad took over the majority of the show's promotional appearances herself. Rashad also defended Cosby against the accusations, calling him [...] "one of the most intelligent people I have ever known. In addition to being a few years younger than Clair was originally intended to be, Rashad is only 10 years older than actress Sabrina LeBeauf, who portrays eldest child Sondra. Meanwhile, actress Ethel Ayler, who portrays Clair's mother Carrie, is only 14 years her senior. Originally, actress Clarice Taylor auditioned for the role of Carrie, deliberately making herself over in attempt to look young enough to play Rashad's mother before Cosby ultimately cast her as his own character's.|$|E

The character {{was one of the few}} to have experienced life 'outside' of Coronation Street. In some ways this predicts the growth of globalisation, and the decline of similar communities. In an episode from 1961, Barlow declares: [...] "You can't go on just thinking about your own street these days. We're living with people on the other side of the world. There's more to worry <b>about</b> <b>than</b> Elsie Tanner and her boyfriends." [...] Roache is the only remaining member of the original cast, which makes him the longest-serving actor in Coronation Street, and in British and global soap history.|$|E
2500|$|Author and musicologist Walter Everett {{recognises}} {{the album}} {{as a successful}} combination of [...] "rich multipart vocals brimming with expressive dissonance treatment, a deep exploration of different guitars and the capos that produced different colors from familiar finger patterns, surprising new timbres and electronic effects, a more soulful pentatonic approach to vocal and instrumental melody tinged by frequent twelve-bar jams that accompanied the more serious recording, and a fairly consistent search for meaningful ideas in lyrics". Everett credits several of these qualities, as on Revolver, as the inspiration for many progressive rock bands of the early 1970s. Citing a quantitative study of tempos in music from the era, he also identifies Rubber Soul as a work that was [...] "made more to be thought <b>about</b> <b>than</b> danced to", and an album that [...] "began a far-reaching trend" [...] in its slowing-down of the tempos typically used in pop and rock music.|$|E

2500|$|Although reviewers {{have read}} {{political}} intonations into the album's ostensible themes, deeming it “unashamedly prog in its ambition and dimensions”, Turner {{is reluctant to}} admit to such an agenda. [...] "I'd hesitate to call the record 'political' because Isis has never taken a public political stand on anything. At the same time, it's intended to draw a parallel between the system that Bentham created and what's {{going on in the}} world right now". Likewise, he notes that the album is “absolutely not about a political agenda. I always try to write about stuff that is specific to my life during the time I write an album. And I try to find things that I'm emotionally and intellectually attached to. We've never been a political band. But right now politics are such a great importance. You can travel everywhere and you simply cannot ignore them. And so this is one of the main things that have been occupying my mind during the creation of this record. So beyond these things just being interesting themselves they have a lot of relevance to what's {{going on in the world}} right now [...] I think these things are relevant to everybody's lives and specifically to me and this band and what we experienced through living in this country over the last couple of years. And also I think my lyrics are so abstract and fragmented sometimes that I feel like those things are a better representation of what I'm writing <b>about</b> <b>than</b> printed lyrics might be.” Despite his denial that Panopticon is politically motivated, Turner does refer to the then-incumbent George W. Bush administration's tenure as a source of inspiration; about how Bentham's essay bore relevance to “hit home in terms of how [...] is treating its own citizens outside and within the country.” ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1969, Haggard {{released}} [...] "Okie From Muskogee," [...] with lyrics ostensibly {{reflecting the}} singer's {{pride in being}} from Middle America where people are conventionally patriotic, don't smoke marijuana, don't take LSD, don't protest by burning draft cards or otherwise challenge authority. In the ensuing years, Haggard gave varying statements regarding whether he intended the song as a humorous satire or a serious political statement in support of conservative values. In a 2001 interview, Haggard called the song a [...] "documentation of the uneducated that lived in America at the time." [...] However, he made several other statements suggesting that he meant the song seriously. On the Bob Edwards Show, he said, [...] "I wrote it when I recently {{got out of the}} joint. I knew {{what it was like to}} lose my freedom, and I was getting really mad at these protesters. They didn't know anything more about the war in Vietnam than I did. I thought how my dad, who was from Oklahoma, would have felt. I felt I knew how those boys fighting in Vietnam felt." [...] In the country music documentary series Lost Highway, he elaborated: [...] "My dad passed away when I was nine, and I don't know if you've ever thought about somebody you've lost and you say, 'I wonder what so-and-so would think about this?' I was drivin' on Interstate 40 and I saw a sign that said '19 Miles to Muskogee.' Muskogee was always referred to in my childhood as 'back home.' So I saw that sign and my whole childhood flashed before my eyes and I thought, 'I wonder what dad would think about the youthful uprising that was occurring at the time, the Janis Joplins.... I understood 'em, I got along with it, but what if he was to come alive at this moment? And I thought, what a way to describe the kind of people in America that are still sittin' in the center of the country sayin', 'What is goin' on on these campuses?'" [...] In the American Masters documentary about him, he said, [...] "That's how I got into it with the hippies.... I thought they were unqualified to judge America, and I thought they were lookin' down their noses at something that I cherished very much, and it pissed me off. And I thought, 'You sons of bitches, you've never been restricted away from this great, wonderful country, and yet here you are in the streets bitchin' about things, protesting about a war that they didn't know any more <b>about</b> <b>than</b> I did.
