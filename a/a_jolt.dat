5|$|In December 1990, B-1B (s/n 83-0071) {{from the}} 96th Bomb Wing, 337th Bomb Squadron, Dyess AFB, Texas, {{experienced}} <b>a</b> <b>jolt</b> {{that caused the}} #3 engine to shut down with its fire extinguisher activating. This event, coupled with the October 1990 engine incident, led to a 50+ day grounding of the B-1Bs not on nuclear alert status. The problem was eventually traced back to problems in the first-stage fan, and all B-1Bs were equipped with modified engines.|$|E
5|$|The pilots felt <b>a</b> <b>jolt,</b> and the {{autopilot}} disengaged. As Records {{took hold of}} his control column, Haynes focused on the tail engine, whose instruments indicated it was malfunctioning; he found its throttle and fuel supply controls jammed. At Dvorak's suggestion, a valve cutting fuel to the tail engine was shut off. This part of the emergency took 14 seconds.|$|E
5|$|Between 1929 and 1935, {{under the}} strain of World Depression, {{political}} thinking worldwide received <b>a</b> <b>jolt</b> from the spread of international communism. Indian political parties, movements and considerable sections of leadership were also affected by inter-continental ideologies. The Self-Respect Movement also came {{under the influence of}} the leftist philosophies and institutions. E.V. Ramasamy, after establishing the Self-Respect Movement as an independent institution, began to look for ways to strengthen it politically and socially. To accomplish this, he studied the history and politics of different countries, and personally observed these systems at work.|$|E

60|$|The {{two women}} had been talking a long time when a team and <b>a</b> <b>jolting</b> wagon swept into sight, and Mrs. Hastings rose {{as the man who}} drove pulled up his horses.|$|R
50|$|The Kazakh horse averages 144 cm for stallions and mares average 142 cm. They weigh between 400 to 500 kg. The breed is {{criticized for}} a short stride and <b>a</b> <b>jolting</b> trot. However, they are also very hardy and able to cover long distances.|$|R
25|$|Health {{problems}} notwithstanding, {{the latter}} 1950s proved decisively fruitful for Jane Frank {{as a serious}} artist. Having fairly well recovered from her injuries in the traumatic 1952 accident, she studied for a period in 1956 with the great abstract expressionist painter Hans Hofmann in Provincetown, Massachusetts, and this mentoring gave her <b>a</b> <b>jolt</b> of inspiration and encouragement. She soon had solo exhibitions at the Baltimore Museum of Art (1958), the Corcoran Gallery of Art (1962), the Bodley Gallery in New York (1963) and Goucher College (1963), among others.|$|E
25|$|The {{revolutions}} of 1830 gave <b>a</b> <b>jolt</b> to the settled European {{system that}} had been created in 1814–15. The United Kingdom of the Netherlands was rent in half by the Belgian Revolution, the Kingdom of Portugal {{was the scene of}} civil war, and the Spanish were about to place an infant princess on the throne. Poland was in arms against the Russian Empire, while the northern powers (Russia, Prussia, and Austria) formed a closer alliance that seemed to threaten the peace and liberties of Europe. Polish exiles called on Britain to intervene against Russia during the November Uprising of 1830.|$|E
25|$|Anaximander {{attributed}} some phenomena, such as {{thunder and}} lightning, {{to the intervention}} of elements, rather than to divine causes. In his system, thunder results from the shock of clouds hitting each other; the loudness of the sound is proportionate {{with that of the}} shock. Thunder without lightning {{is the result of the}} wind being too weak to emit any flame, but strong enough to produce a sound. A flash of lightning without thunder is <b>a</b> <b>jolt</b> of the air that disperses and falls, allowing a less active fire to break free. Thunderbolts are the result of a thicker and more violent air flow.|$|E
60|$|He {{awoke in}} a fright, while the hamper was being lifted into the carrier's cart. Then there was <b>a</b> <b>jolting,</b> and <b>a</b> {{clattering}} of horse's feet; other packages were thrown in; for miles and miles--jolt--jolt--jolt! and Timmy Willie trembled amongst the jumbled up vegetables.|$|R
5000|$|Coat of Arms: Red shield, <b>a</b> <b>jolted</b> golden grapevine, foliated {{and golden}} tendrils, silvery fruit, under a cross of the Sovereign Military Hospitaller Order of Saint John of Jerusalem of Rhodes and of Malta {{on top of}} silver and blue waived stripes. Silver mural crown with three towers. White listel with caption in black: [...] "Vale de Gouvinhas".|$|R
60|$|Nobody spoke, and {{the girl}} was {{wondering}} by what means the strain could be relieved, which, though few heard what Barrington said, all seemed to feel, when {{out of the darkness}} came a second beat of hoofs, and by and by a man swaying on the driving-seat of <b>a</b> <b>jolting</b> wagon swept into the light from the windows. Then, there were voices outside, and a breathless lad came in.|$|R
25|$|At about 11:45pm ship's time Gracie was jarred awake by <b>a</b> <b>jolt.</b> He sat up, {{realized}} the ship's engines {{were no longer}} moving, and partially dressed, putting on a Norfolk jacket over his regular clothes. Reaching the Boat Deck, he {{realized the}} ship was listing slightly. He returned to his cabin {{to put on his}} life jacket and on the way back found the women he had been chaperoning. He escorted them up to the Boat Deck and made sure they entered lifeboats. He then retrieved blankets for the women in the boats, and along with his friend Smith assisted Second Officer Charles Lightoller in filling the remaining lifeboats with women and children.|$|E
500|$|Ambrose's family takes {{refuge in}} the TARDIS, but the Doctor, Amy and Rory find {{a crack in the}} cavern wall similar to those they have seen before. The Doctor surmises that the crack was caused by an {{explosion}} in time, which might have left [...] "shrapnel" [...] behind. He reaches in and pulls out an object which he wraps in a handkerchief. Before he can explain, Restac, dying from the toxic exposure, crawls around the corner and fires at the Doctor, but Rory pushes him {{out of the way and}} takes the shot, dying in Amy's arms. As the crack begins to absorb Rory's body, the Doctor realises that Rory will be written out of history and forces Amy to board the TARDIS before the drill explodes. He tries to help her concentrate on remembering Rory, but <b>a</b> <b>jolt</b> from the TARDIS causes her to lose concentration and her memories of Rory are lost. The Doctor finds Amy's engagement ring, which Rory had stowed before the events, on the floor of the TARDIS.|$|E
500|$|In {{the wake}} of the actor Robin Williams' suicide, Savage said that suicide is an [...] "aggressive act" [...] that shows no {{consideration}} for loved ones left behind. The assertion prompted criticism, but a caller to The Savage Nation said the radio host's frank talk about the subject helped him decide to not take his own life. A caller who identified himself as Joe told Savage he had been contemplating suicide for the past several months, and especially in the most recent week previous to the call. After Savage discovered that Joe was suffering financially, he asked his audience to join in helping Joe get {{through the rest of the}} month by donating through the Savage Legal Defense Fund. The Fund raised over $10,000 in just a few days. Another caller from Detroit had given Savage <b>a</b> <b>jolt</b> by referring to his days as a phone line crisis counselor as being predominantly dealing with suicide calls. The advice that the Detroit caller had given – [...] "you are taking a permanent solution for a temporary problem" [...] encouraged Savage to reach out to the suicidal caller he had.|$|E
50|$|Eighteen hours later, {{they arrived}} in Philadelphia. Without anyone {{questioning}} {{the contents of the}} chest, it was then placed on <b>a</b> <b>jolting</b> carriage ride with Lear still confined and to the American Anti-Slavery Society Office. Upon arriving, William Still, chairman of the Vigilance Committee, untied the chest and Lear emerged from it alive. Lear remained at the Still residence until traveling to her final destination in south central New York where her fiancé was waiting.|$|R
5000|$|From 1988 to 1992 Crow was a {{notoriously}} shambolic affair {{that could easily}} derail though equipment failures. Bringing performances to <b>a</b> <b>jolting</b> stop. Driven by the nervy personalities of brothers Peter (guitar, vocals) and John (drums) and combined with the combustible bassist Jim Woff and lead guitarist Peter Archer, Crow was highly unpredictable. The original bass player and founding member was Paul Gormack, who left the band {{just prior to the}} recording of the debut album ...|$|R

500|$|Lou Lumenick of the New York Post {{expressed}} his compliments about the film's crew, [...] "It's a remarkable story, vividly and urgently told by French-Canadian director Vallée from a pointed, schmaltz-free script by Craig Borten and Melissa Wallack." [...] A. O. Scott reviewed the film for The New York Times and said, [...] "Matthew McConaughey brings <b>a</b> <b>jolt</b> of unpredictable energy to Dallas Buyers Club, an affecting if conventional real-life story of medical activism." [...] The Wall Street Journals film critic thinks [...] "Matthew McConaughey continues to amaze." [...] David Denby of The New Yorker talked about McConaughey's physical transformation in his words, [...] "It's McConaughey's spiritual transformation {{that is most}} remarkable. His gaze is at once desperate and challenging." [...] Rolling Stone's Peter Travers said, [...] " [...] explosive, unerring portrayal defines what makes an actor great, blazing commitment to a character and the range to make every nuance felt." [...] Film critic Rex Reed reviewed the film for The New York Observer and said, [...] "Dallas Buyers Club represents {{the best of what}} independent film on a limited budget can achieve-powerful, enlightening and not to be missed." [...] The Wraps Alonso Duralde said why he watched the film, [...] "McConaughey is the only reason to see Dallas Buyers Club, but he's enough of a reason to see Dallas Buyers Club." ...|$|E
500|$|Writing for The Huffington Post, Carly Steyer {{credited}} Kim {{with teaching}} {{the importance of}} maintaining a healthy work-life balance: [...] "She paid an appropriate amount of attention to her schoolwork, and worked hard, but didn't slave over it {{to the extent that}} she didn't have any time left to save the world." [...] The character has also received positive attention from feminist critics; in her article [...] "12 Life Lessons 'Kim Possible' Taught Us That Are Still Pretty Relevant", Kadeen Griffiths of Bustle described Kim as an [...] "amazingly feminist" [...] character [...] "that taught girls that it was okay to overachieve, that worrying about boys didn't make you any less of a hero, and that you could invent your own slang and still sound (sort of) cool." [...] Griffiths went on to hail the character as [...] "our cartoon idol when it came to reaching for the stars and pulling it off flawlessly", concluding, [...] "at {{the end of the day}} Kim Possible could do anything. And so can all of us." [...] BuzzFeed ranked Kim ninth on its list of [...] "17 Characters From Your Childhood That Were More Feminist Than You Remember", with author Ellie Bate crediting the character with [...] "break the sexist stereotype that all cheerleaders are nothing but bimbos". Bustle writer Sarah Freymiller agreed that [...] "Kim offers a model for femininity that both bolsters and works against the typical 'high school cheerleader' stereotype." [...] Pride ranked Kim 11th on its list of [...] "13 Cartoon Characters Who Defied Gender Stereotypes". In her article [...] "Power feminism, mediated: Girl power and the commercial politics of change", Rebecca C. Hains of Salem State College cited Kim among several [...] "strong powerful girl [...] heroes" [...] who are responsible for [...] "breaking the mold by placing girls at the center of narratives with active agency and unfettered power" [...] during the early 2000s. MTV compared the character to American spy Virginia Hall in their article [...] "9 Cartoon Feminists Who Remind Us of Real-life Badass Women". While ranking Kim Possible: So the Drama the 12th most feminist Disney Channel Original Movie, Priya Krishna of BuzzFeed described Kim as [...] "obviously great". Comparing Kim to comic book superheroine Wonder Woman, Kathryn Shattuck of The New York Times wrote, [...] "MOVE over, boy wonders. The newest superhero on the block doesn't need a gimmicky mask or <b>a</b> <b>jolt</b> of testosterone to get the job done ... Kim Possible is ready and able to rescue humankind from evildoers without sacrificing her interest in boys and clothes." [...] However, in her book Girlfighting: Betrayal and Rejection, author Lyn Mikel Brown dismissed Kim as both a feminist and role model because of her alleged reliance on Ron's intelligence, as well as the observation that [...] "Her biggest threat is not evil, in fact, but the head cheerleader". Since her debut, Kim has proven herself a popular character among both girls and boys, although McCorkle admitted that [...] "whenever you have a girl in the lead doing all the action stuff, there’s a certain age group of boys who won’t admit they like the stuff. They really want to see the boy in that role." [...] McCorkle recalled an incident in which a fan of the show was very much surprised to learn that the writers were actually men upon meeting them; the fan had always just assumed that they were both young women because of the way in which they characterized Kim. At one point, fans of the character had sent her over one million e-mails via her interactive website.|$|E

60|$|Lawson {{pretended to}} sleep. Parker smoked a pipe while striding along behind the wagon. Elsie drove, {{and of course}} Curtis could not leave her to guide the team alone. Necessarily, they talked freely on many topics, and all restraint, all reserve, were away at last. It is {{difficult}} to hold a formal and carefully considered conversation in <b>a</b> <b>jolting</b> buckboard climbing towards a great range of shining peaks, and every frank speech brought them into friendlier relation. Considered in this light, the afternoon assumed vast importance.|$|R
50|$|After {{this the}} people have been told, so as to say: “This work which you regard as {{absolutely}} impossible, is not any difficult for Allah, for which He may have to make lengthy preparations. Just <b>a</b> single <b>jolt</b> will upset this system {{of the world and}} <b>a</b> second <b>jolt</b> will be enough to cause you to appear as living beings in the new world.

Joe knew immediately the thumb of his left hand was damaged, though he wasn't sure as to the extent. [...] "In the midst of the fight, with your adrenaline pumping, it's hard to gauge such things. My mind was on more important matters. Like how I was going to deal with Yemelyanov {{for the rest of the}} fight."

2500|$|March Fires {{received}} generally positive reviews. Sean Palmer of The Sydney Morning Herald {{gave the}} album a 4-star review, stating that [...] "March Fires is a gem and channels emotion but never {{to the point}} of nausea, leaving you feeling comfortable in the pleasant tones of a band that know what they are doing." [...] He noted the stylistic similarities of the album to the band's previous work and wrote [...] "There is nothing here to shock or bewilder unless you are expecting Birds of Tokyo to return to their alt-rock origins with a hardened edge. If that's the case, you will be in for <b>a</b> <b>jolt</b> of disappointment, as beneath Kenny's words there is an astounding sense of positivity - as though one can climb that mountain, fix that bridge or restore faith."

50|$|Soulmates often {{discover}} their connection by accident, when the soulmates kiss or touch, or {{when one of}} them drinks the other's blood. In Secret Vampire, Poppy and James have been friends for years but realize they are soulmates only when James drinks Poppy's blood. In Daughters of Darkness, Mary-Lynnette and Ash each feel <b>an</b> electric <b>jolt</b> when they first shake hands. In The Chosen, Rashel's bare hand brushes Quinn's, and they both receive <b>a</b> shivering <b>jolt.</b> <b>A</b> soulmate also has the ability to completely enter his/her soulmate's mind. When this occurs, their minds are forcibly opened to each other and each can explore the other's memories, thoughts, and feelings freely. In Huntress, it is revealed that memories can be blocked, but any lapse in concentration or excessive time in a soulmate's mind will remove the blockages.|$|R

5000|$|AllMusic {{awarded the}} album with 3 stars and its review by Scott Yanow states: [...] "At 25, Williamson {{displayed}} an original tenor sound and, {{although some of}} his soloing is in the Greg Osby/Gary Thomas 'M Base' mode, he {{was not limited to}} that abstract style of improvising". The Penguin Guide review says: [...] "What is lastingly impressive about A Waltz for Grace is its tremendous rhythmic variety. 'Groove Thang' (a UK recorded soprano-percussion duet) leads directly into the fuller-sounding 'Synthesis' from New York, both largely dependent on Williamson's ability to balance a line over <b>a</b> <b>jolting,</b> staccato pulse".|$|R
