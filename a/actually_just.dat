5|$|The video {{begins with}} Spears {{appearing}} bored in class at a Catholic high school. Her assistant Felicia Culotta {{played the role}} of Spears's teacher. When the bell rings, Spears runs out into the hall and begins a choreographed dance in the corridor. After this, Spears is outside, now adorned in an pink athletic outfit, and seen in a car. Along with a couple of other students, she performs a number of gymnastic moves before heading back inside. She is then sitting on the bleachers in the gymnasium watching a basketball game, and she dances in the gymnasium. Her love interest is revealed sitting close to her, played by her real-life cousin Chad. After this short segment, Spears begins her final dance routine and the video ends shortly afterwards, and the bell rings and Spears leaves the gymnasium, revealing that the whole thing had <b>actually</b> <b>just</b> been Spears's daydream. During the very beginning, Spears is seen with her sleeves down. Some people who see the music video may not recognize this, but when the bell rings, the sleeves of exactly the same gray-and-white shirt she is wearing are rolled up, even when she gets into singing.|$|E
5|$|When we came {{to record}} it in the studio we {{struggled}} because there was something just not quite right about it and I wasn't happy about where we'd left it and where we were happy to leave it and we couldn't put our finger on what it was {{and so it was}} a really nice day one day, me and Chris were just trying, I was <b>actually</b> <b>just</b> trying to record bass at the time and me and Chris were just sitting down trying to brainstorm it and work out what was wrong and so I started trying to just do a few different bass lines and stuff. Between the two of us we came up with just this kind of groove, which stays on the same note as opposed to change, it's quite technical but it kind of added a bit of bounce to the song and it made it roll along in a much more fluid way. It was a bit mechanical before and it's just interesting how something small like that can really change the whole vibe of a song. It was just nice because from there on it was one of our favourite tracks and it almost didn't get on the record but it's now one of our favourite tracks.|$|E
5|$|Nietzsche {{rejected}} fundamental {{components of}} Kant's ethics, particularly his argument that morality, God, and immorality, {{can be shown}} through reason. Nietzsche cast suspicion {{on the use of}} moral intuition, which Kant used as the foundation of his morality, arguing that it has no normative force in ethics. He further attempted to undermine key concepts in Kant's moral psychology, such as the will and pure reason. Like Kant, Nietzsche developed a concept of autonomy; however, he rejected Kant's idea that valuing our own autonomy requires us to respect the autonomy of others. A naturalist reading of Nietzsche's moral psychology stands contrary to Kant's conception of reason and desire. Under the Kantian model, reason is a fundamentally different motive to desire because it has the capacity to stand back from a situation and make an independent decision. Nietzsche conceives of the self as a social structure of all our different drives and motivations; thus, when it seems that our intellect has made a decision against our drives, it is <b>actually</b> <b>just</b> an alternative drive taking dominance over another. This is in direct contrast with Kant's view of the intellect as opposed to instinct; instead, it is just another instinct. There is thus no self-capable of standing back and making a decision; the decision the self-makes is simply determined by the strongest drive. Kantian commentators have argued that Nietzsche's practical philosophy requires the existence of a self-capable of standing back in the Kantian sense. For an individual to create values of their own, which is a key idea in Nietzsche's philosophy, they must be able to conceive of themselves as a unified agent. Even if the agent is influenced by their drives, he must regard them as his own, which undermines Nietzsche's conception of autonomy.|$|E

25|$|Promoted to ensign, he {{was present}} at the relief of Peñíscola, Spain, and Palermo in Sicily; his service in these and other actions {{resulted}} in his promotion to ship lieutenant. Participating in the 1707 defence of the French naval base of Toulon cost him his left eye. In 1711 he served in the Spanish Navy under the orders of Andrés de Pez.

25|$|The Latino {{demographics}} caused {{controversy in}} the 1970s, when many drug cartels were selling drugs, even though most people were not actually affected by it. While some media sources placed culpability on the wire transfer stores along Roosevelt Avenue as vestiges of the drug-selling, these stores were actually useful to the community. Latino clubs and bars on the avenue were also pointed to as another trace of evidence, even though most were <b>actually</b> <b>just</b> places for typical Latino immigrants to hang out. Little India was also controversial. Although Indians are a minority in Jackson Heights, a vibrant commercial area developed on 74th Street in the 1990s, and by 1993, {{it was the largest}} Asian Indian shopping area in the country.|$|E

25|$|Fregoli took London by storm. He did quick-fire performances, impersonating Wagner, Rossini, Verdi and Paderewski {{one after}} another. He would exit stage left as a street {{musician}} and appear almost immediately stage right as a woman. Everybody - including the great actors and performers of the day, such as Dan Leno - {{wanted to see}} him, and his run was extended and extended, as was the seating in the theatre; not bad for someone who didn't even speak English. The general view of him was that, apart from his obvious abilities as a quick change artist he was - unlike his rivals - a consummate actor and a brilliant writer. He gave private performances for royalty and aristocrats (such as the Rothschilds, for whom he calmly explained all of his tricks). He inspired a host of imitators, male and female. Every theatre in London soon had its protean artist; even Biondi was there, performing at the same time. There were spoofers and parodists: journalists claimed tipsy theatregoers were demanding their money back upon discovering that all the performers they had just witnessed were <b>actually</b> <b>just</b> one man.|$|E
25|$|From Shaker Square eastward, both lines enter Shaker Heights {{and operate}} at street level with grade crossings, {{reflecting}} {{this portion of}} the lines' history as streetcar lines. The Blue and Green Lines separate from each other just east of Shaker Square at , with the Blue Line extending southeast in the median of Van Aken Boulevard and the Green Line continuing east in the median of Shaker Boulevard. The station-stops east of Shaker Square on both lines are adjacent to street intersections and most comprise merely concrete platforms with simple shelters. Both lines have grade crossings in this area, except for the Blue Line at Lee Road where the line descends into an excavated cut and under a bridge carrying Lee Road over the tracks and the Green Line from Warrensville Road eastward. The central median of Shaker Boulevard expands at Warrensville Road—it was originally planned for a high-speed parkway—and the Green Line continues along this median with Warrensville Road crossing on a bridge overhead. There is also a bridge at Green Road, although the station is <b>actually</b> <b>just</b> west of the bridge and only layover tracks extend beneath the bridge.|$|E
25|$|The first {{versions}} of Windows (1.0 through to 3.11) were <b>actually</b> <b>just</b> programs run from MS-DOS which then {{took over the}} screen and launched an application called Program Manager; later on, Windows 95, though still being based on MS-DOS, was its own operating system, using a 16-bit DOS-based kernel and a 32-bit user space. Windows 95 introduced many staple features that remain in current {{versions of}} Windows today, including the Start menu, the taskbar, and Windows Explorer (renamed File Explorer in Windows 8). In 1997, Microsoft released Internet Explorer 4 which included the (at the time) controversial Windows Desktop Update, which aimed to integrate Internet Explorer and the web into the user interface and also brought many new features into Windows, {{such as the ability}} to display JPEG images as the desktop wallpaper and single window navigation in Windows Explorer, all of which still exist in Windows today. In 1998, Microsoft released Windows 98, which also included the Windows Desktop Update and Internet Explorer 4 by default. The inclusion of Internet Explorer 4 and the Desktop Update led to an infamous anti-trust case. Windows 98 also included plug and play, which allowed devices to simply work when plugged in instead of requiring a system reboot, and USB support out of the box, which was previously only available in specially updated versions of Windows 95 which were only shipped to OEMs and not available to the general public. Windows ME, the last DOS-based version of Windows, was aimed at consumers and released in 2000. It introduced the Help and Support Center, System Restore, and updated user-friendly versions of the Disk Defragmenter and other system tools.|$|E
