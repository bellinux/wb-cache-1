40|$|We {{present a}} {{mathematical}} model of the eBay auction protocol and perform {{a detailed analysis of}} the effects that <b>the</b> eBay proxy <b>bidding</b> system and <b>the</b> minimum <b>bid</b> increment have on the auction properties. We first consider the revenue of the auction, and we show that when bidders use <b>the</b> eBay proxy <b>bidding</b> system there is an optimal value for <b>the</b> minimum <b>bid</b> increment at which the auctioneer’s revenue is maximised. We then show that <b>the</b> minimum <b>bid</b> increment also introduces an inefficiency to the auction, whereby bidders who enter the auction late may find that their valuation is insufficient to allow them to <b>advance</b> <b>the</b> current <b>bid</b> by <b>the</b> minimum <b>bid</b> increment (and this may occur despite them actually having the highest valuation for the item). Finally, we use these results to consider appropriate strategies for bidders. We show that whilst last minute bidding (sniping) is an effective strategy against bidders engaging in incremental bidding (and against those with common values), in general, delaying bidding is disadvantageous. Thus, when several bidders submit last minute bids, we show that rather than seeking to bid as late as possible, a bidder should try to be the first sniper to submit their bid (i. e. they should ‘snipe before the snipers’) ...|$|R
25|$|The lack of {{resistance}} to the wider sweep of the ROK 1st Division's <b>advance</b> confirmed that <b>the</b> <b>bid</b> to block and attack the North Korean I Corps had been futile. To the east, the fact that the Chinese 26th Army still had forces deployed to delay <b>the</b> <b>advance</b> of <b>the</b> 3d and 25th Divisions had become equally clear. On the I Corps' right, the 25th Division had run into a large number of minefields and small but well entrenched Chinese groups employing small arms, machine gun, and mortar fire. At nightfall on March 24 General Bradley's forces held positions almost due west of Uijongbu in the 3d Division's zone at corps center.|$|R
2500|$|Environmental groups, {{such as the}} Israel Union for Environmental Defense, {{have called}} for a {{moratorium}} on new desalination plants, beyond the ones already in <b>the</b> <b>advanced</b> <b>bidding</b> stages. [...] "We believe that even in 2020, we can make do with desalination 315 million cubic meters", a report says. It calls for water conservation, the treatment of wastewater and the recycling of greywater, as well as using construction techniques that allow rainwater to percolate into underground water reservoirs. The authors of the report claim that this would reduce the need for massive desalination of seawater and the environmental damage it causes, including the emission of greenhouse gases. In October 2011 the Water Authority published a Master Plan for Desalination in Israel.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the relationship between}} <b>the</b> price <b>bid</b> for a takeover target, the probability of <b>the</b> <b>bid</b> succeeding and <b>the</b> target 2 ̆ 7 s price {{over the course of}} <b>the</b> <b>bid.</b> We test and reject Samuelson and Rosenthal 2 ̆ 7 s (1986) expected value hypothesis.

This lack of observed convergenece appears to be due to an early cessation of trading in many of <b>the</b> <b>bids</b> that succeed. In <b>the</b> case of <b>bids</b> that fail, <b>the</b> target 2 ̆ 7 s share price is typically observed to rise above <b>the</b> <b>bid</b> price early in <b>the</b> <b>bid.</b> We consider several explanations for this, and suggest that the expectation of a subsequent <b>bid</b> is <b>the</b> most plausible explanation.
