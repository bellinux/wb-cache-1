25|$|A rhinoplastic {{correction}} can {{be performed}} on {{a person who is}} under sedation, under general anaesthesia, or under local anaesthesia; initially, a local anaesthetic mixture of lidocaine and epinephrine is injected to numb the area, and temporarily reduce vascularity, thereby limiting any bleeding. Generally, the plastic surgeon first separates the nasal skin and the soft tissues from the osseo-cartilagenous nasal framework, and then corrects (reshapes) them as required, afterwards, sutures the incisions, and then applies either an external or an internal stent, and tape, to immobilize the newly reconstructed nose, and so facilitate the healing of the surgical cuts. Occasionally, the surgeon uses either an autologous cartilage graft or a bone graft, or both, in order to strengthen or to alter the nasal contour(s). The autologous grafts usually are harvested from the nasal septum, but, if it has insufficient cartilage (as can occur in a revision rhinoplasty), then either a costal cartilage graft (from the rib cage) or an auricular cartilage graft (concha from the ear) is harvested from the patient’s body. When the rhinoplasty requires a bone graft, it is harvested from either the cranium, the hips, or the rib cage; moreover, when neither type of <b>autologous</b> <b>graft</b> is available, a synthetic graft (nasal implant) is used to augment the nasal bridge.|$|E

40|$|We {{randomly}} assigned 17 patients with scaphoid non-union at the proximal pole to three treatment groups: (1) autologous iliac graft (n= 6), (2) autologous iliac graft + osteogenic protein- 1 (OP- 1; n= 6), and (3) allogenic iliac graft + OP- 1 (n= 5). Radiographic, scintigraphic, and clinical assessments were performed throughout the follow-up period of 24  months. OP- 1 improved {{the performance of}} both autologous and allogenic bone implants and reduced radiographic healing time to 4  weeks compared with 9  weeks in group  1. Helical CT scans and scintigraphy showed that in OP- 1 -treated patients sclerotic bone was replaced by well-vascularised bone. The addition of OP- 1 to allogenic bone implant equalised the clinical outcome with the <b>autologous</b> <b>graft</b> procedure.

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{describe}} {{methods and}} outcomes of excisional revision of a filtering bleb (bleb revision) using free conjunctival <b>autologous</b> <b>graft</b> either for bleb repair or for bleb reduction after trabeculectomy and deep sclerectomy with an implant. METHODS: Retrospective medical records were reviewed for a consecutive non-comparative case series comprising patients who underwent excisional revision of a filtering bleb between May 1998 -January 2001. Excisional revision using free conjunctival <b>autologous</b> <b>graft</b> (bleb revision) was performed either for bleb repair, to treat {{early and late}} leaks and hypotony with maculopathy, or for bleb reduction, to improve ocular pain, discomfort, burning, foreign body sensation, tearing, and fluctuations of visual acuity. The revision consisted of bleb excision and free conjunctival <b>autologous</b> <b>graft.</b> The bleb histopathology was analyzed in patients who underwent bleb repair. RESULTS: Sixteen patients {{were included in the}} study, consisting of nine patients who had a trabeculectomy and seven patients who had a deep sclerectomy with an implant. Bleb revision was necessary in 14 patients due to leaking filtering bleb (bleb repair), and in 2 patients due to bleb dysesthesia (bleb reduction). After a follow-up of 15. 1 +/- 8. 4 months, the mean intraocular pressure (IOP) rose from 7. 8 +/- 6. 3 mm Hg to 14. 3 +/- 6. 5 mm Hg, and the visual acuity from 0. 4 +/- 0. 3 to 0. 7 +/- 0. 3, with a P value of 0. 008 and 0. 03, respectively. The complete success rate at 32 months, according to the Kaplan-Meier survival curve, was 38. 3 %, and the qualified success rate was 83. 3 %. Four patients (25 %) required additional suturing for persistent bleb leak. To control IOP, antiglaucoma medical therapy was needed for six patients (37. 5 %) and repeated glaucoma surgery was needed for one patient. CONCLUSION: Free conjunctival <b>autologous</b> <b>graft</b> is a safe and successful procedure for bleb repair and bleb reduction. However, patients {{should be aware of the}} postoperative possibility of requiring medical or surgical intervention for IOP control after revision...|$|E

40|$|Background. In our {{preliminary}} experiments {{we found}} that composite skin grafts consisting of allogeneic acellular dermis and thin epidermal <b>autologous</b> <b>grafts</b> applied to the excised burn wound in one stage led to better results in terms of viscoelastic properties than <b>autologous</b> split-thickness skin <b>grafts.</b> 					Patients and methods. In ten burn patients we applied composite skin grafts consisting of allogeneic acellular dermis and thin epidermal <b>autologous</b> <b>grafts</b> and followed {{the quality of the}} reconstructed skin cover with a special device, Cutometer MPA 580, over a period of four years. 					Results. The cutometric curves demonstrated better viscoelastic properties in composite skin grafts than in conventional split-thickness skin grafts after four years. We found Cutometer MPA 580 to be an advantageous device for the objectification of improved quality of reconstructed skin cover. 					Discussion. Among the various methods the cutometer showed the advantage of being a non-invasive, precise, and objective method of measuring skin’s viscoelastic properties. The Vancouver Scar Score is a subjective evaluation of skin viscoelasticity. 					Conclusion. Our prospective clinical study clearly demonstrated that cutometric measurement produced objective results in contrast to clinical evaluation, the Vancouver Scar Score, and other non-quantitative methods. Our hypothesis that composite skin grafts consisting of allogeneic acellular dermis and thin epidermal <b>autologous</b> <b>grafts</b> applied onto the excised burn wound in one stage led to better results in terms of viscoelastic properties than <b>autologous</b> split-thickness skin <b>grafts</b> was fully confirmed...|$|R

40|$|Bone graft is {{generally}} considered fundamental in achieving solid fusion in scoliosis correction and pseudarthrosis following instrumentation may predispose to implant failure. In endoscopic anterior-instrumented scoliosis surgery, autologous rib or iliac crest graft has been utilised traditionally but both techniques increase operative duration and cause donor site morbidity. Allograft bone and bone- morphogenetic-protein alternatives may improve fusion rates but this remains controversial. This study's objective was to compare two-year postoperative fusion rates {{in a series of}} patients who underwent endoscopic anterior instrumentation for thoracic scoliosis utilising various bone graft types. Significantly better rates of fusion occurred in endoscopic anterior instrumented scoliosis correction using femoral allograft compared to autologous rib-heads and iliac crest graft.
