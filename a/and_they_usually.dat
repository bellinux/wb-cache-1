5|$|The main {{change in}} {{structure}} from the 2nd-century army was {{the establishment of}} large escort armies (comitatus praesentales), typically containing 20,000–30,000 top-grade palatini troops. These were normally based near the imperial capitals: (Constantinople in the East, Milan in the West), thus far from the empire's borders. These armies' primary function was to deter usurpers, <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>usually</b> campaigned under the personal command of their emperors. The legions were split into smaller units comparable in size to the auxiliary regiments of the Principate. Infantry adopted the more protective equipment of the Principate cavalry.|$|E
25|$|Most {{importers}} just import {{red colour}} base cars. For {{green and blue}} taxis, the owners have to convert the cars into the correct colour, <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>usually</b> only paint the exterior, and people {{can still see the}} original red colour from the door gap or engine compartment.|$|E
25|$|These {{individuals}} are administrators who supersede the Chief of Department, <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>usually</b> specialize {{in areas of}} great importance to the Department, such as counterterrorism, operations, training, public information, legal matters, intelligence, and information technology. Despite their role, as civilian administrators of the Department, deputy commissioners are prohibited from taking operational control of a police situation (the Commissioner and the First Deputy Commissioner may take control of these situations, however).|$|E
25|$|From the {{phosphonium}} salts, these reagent {{are formed}} more readily, requiring only NaOH, <b>and</b> <b>they</b> are <b>usually</b> more air-stable. These are less reactive than simple ylides, <b>and</b> so <b>they</b> <b>usually</b> fail to react with ketones, necessitating {{the use of}} the Horner–Wadsworth–Emmons reaction as an alternative. <b>They</b> <b>usually</b> give rise to an E-alkene product when they react, rather than the more usual Z-alkene.|$|R

25|$|In practice, many Incapacity Benefit {{recipients}} declared 'fit for work' formally appealed {{against the}} initial decision <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>usually</b> continued to receive Incapacity Benefit until their appeals were heard, at which stage more than 50% of 'fit for work' decisions were overturned and the claimant was moved onto ESA, not JSA. Furthermore, some people taken off Incapacity Benefit after their reassessment claimed ESA successfully {{at a later}} date after their illness worsened.|$|E
25|$|The most {{effective}} strategy predators use against schooling fish is first to scare them into forming a bait ball. Strategies {{such as those}} outlined {{in the previous section}} can work to a degree against freely streaming fish schools, but work much better if the fish school is first compacted into a bait ball. It is difficult for predators working individually to scare a fish school into a bait ball, <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>usually</b> work together.|$|E
25|$|Pirate {{cartridges}} for the NES were rare, but Famicom {{ones were}} common and widespread in Asia. Most were produced in Hong Kong or Taiwan, <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>usually</b> featured {{a variety of}} small (32k or less) games which were selected from a menu and bank switched. Some were also hacks of existing games (especially Super Mario Bros.), and a few were cartridge conversions of Famicom Disk System titles such as the Japanese SMB2.|$|E

25|$|Shia mosques {{are usually}} Twelvers but cater to Zaydis and Ismailis also <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>usually</b> to include {{facilities}} for women. There are 200,000 Shias in Britain from Iran, Iraq, Pakistan, Turkey and elsewhere. Various Shia mosques include the Husseini Islamic Centre in Stanmore, Harrow which acts {{as one of}} the main Shia Muslim mosques in Britain. Others include Al Masjid ul Husseini in Northolt, Ealing, Imam Khoei Islamic Centre in Queens Park, Brent & Islamic Centre of England, Maida Vale.|$|E
25|$|Gymnasiums {{have its}} courses (smerovi), {{and the most}} common ones are the Socio-Linguistics Course, Science-Mathematics Course, Information Technology Course, Bilingual Course, and the General Course. Students can only choose one course (they do it when they write their wish list for {{preferred}} schools and courses) <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>usually</b> don't change it until they graduate. Every course has the same number and list of classes, but the difference is in their schedules (for example, the Socio-Linguistic Course might have English classes five times a week, while the Science-Mathematics Course offers two English classes a week).|$|E
25|$|Eluvial deposits—those {{that had}} {{weathered}} from the lode {{in the usual}} way, but had not then been transported by flowing water—were also worked; these tended to be poorer deposits {{due to the lack}} of sorting that a stream provides, <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>usually</b> did not have such a ready supply of water available to work them. They are found on gently sloping hillsides. Where possible the water needed to work these deposits was carried by a leat from the nearest available river, or if the site was above such supplies, reservoirs were constructed to collect rainwater and runoff from hillsides.|$|E

25|$|In {{addition}} to art and architecture, {{there was an}} explosion of musical activity in Minas Gerais in the 18th century. Printed copies of European music, as well as accomplished musicians, made the journey to the area, and soon a local school of composition and performance was born and achieved considerable sophistication. Several composers worked in Minas Gerais in the 18th century, mainly in Vila Rica (now Ouro Preto), Sabará, Mariana, and other cities. Some of the names which have survived include José Joaquim Emerico Lobo de Mesquita, Marcos Coelho Netto, Francisco Gomes da Rocha and Ignácio Parreiras Neves; they cultivated a style related to the classical European style but marked by more a more chordal, homophonic sound, <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>usually</b> wrote for mixed groups of voices and instruments.|$|E
25|$|The {{present state}} of Chhattisgarh was carved out of Madhya Pradesh on 1 November 2000. The demand for a {{separate}} state was first raised in the 1920s. Similar demands kept cropping up at regular intervals; however, a well-organised movement was never launched. Several all-party platforms were formed <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>usually</b> resolved around petitions, public meetings, seminars, rallies and strikes. A demand for separate Chhattisgarh was raised in 1924 by the Raipur Congress unit and also discussed in the Annual Session of the Indian Congress at Tripuri. A discussion also took place of forming a Regional Congress organisation for Chhattisgarh. When the State Reorganisation Commission {{was set up in}} 1954, the demand for a separate Chhattisgarh was put forward, but was not accepted. In 1955, a demand for a separate state was raised in the Nagpur assembly of the then state of Madhya Bharat.|$|E
25|$|In 1810 the {{government}} of the Qing Dynasty issued a pardon to all pirates operating in China, thousands accepted and joined the Qing navy which began the decline of piracy in the Far East. However, though many pirates chose to give up their criminal ways, thousands continued pirating along the southern Chinese coast. The pirates used war-junks and occasionally other vessels as well. Several different pirate groups were active in this time <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>usually</b> operated in mass against merchant vessels. By 1847 the Royal Navy began to take more serious measures against the pirates. They had already engaged the Chinese brigands in combat as early as 1839 and it took until the late 1860s to finally put an end to fleets of pirate junks but even then piracy continued in China but was done so in a different way as new steam vessels meant a change in tactics.|$|E

25|$|There {{has been}} a long and fierce debate on whether to use the Latin alphabet, the Tifinagh alphabet, or the Arabic alphabet, as the {{official}} alphabet for Berber in Algeria and Morocco, between Berber activists and the anti-Berber establishments, mainly those with Arab-Islamic agendas or orientations. The Berber activists overwhelmingly favor the use of the Latin alphabet in order to ensure a quick development and proliferation of the Berber language (Tamazight) in schools, in public institutions, and on the internet. A small number of them prefer the neo-Tifinagh alphabet. The states of Morocco and Algeria usually distance themselves from Latin-based Berber writing, fearing that it would strengthen the position of Berber against Arabic and French, and thus leading to a stronger Berber political activism. The Arab-Islamic establishments and political parties often reject the Latin alphabet as a Berber alphabet for the same reasons, <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>usually</b> brand it as a tool to westernize and Christianize Berbers.|$|E
25|$|Although the N.S.S. {{claimed to}} be interdenominational, the schools run by the Society became {{increasingly}} identified and involved with the Church of England. The Society acknowledged {{that one of its}} primary aims, despite its non-denominational constitution, was to carry the ministry of the Church to isolated areas which could not afford to support a clergyman. In 1923 they merged into a denominational school system known as the Church of England schools. The existence of the society was one of the influences in the evolution of a denominational school system in Newfoundland. The teachers sent out in the society’s early years were well trained and highly regarded as leaders within the communities in which they lived, <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>usually</b> served as catechists or lay readers as well. A considerable number later elected to become ordained as Anglican priests and furnished the Newfoundland church with one of its main sources of clerics during the 19th century. Regarding themselves as missionaries as well as pedagogues, they strove to inculcate the virtues of hard work, regular habits, sobriety, and the observance of Sunday as a day of rest.|$|E
500|$|The nitride anion (N3−) is {{the strongest}} π donor known amongst ligands (the second-strongest is O2−). Nitrido {{complexes}} are generally made by thermal decomposition of azides or by deprotonating ammonia, <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>usually</b> involve a terminal {≡N}3− group. The linear azide anion (...) , being isoelectronic with nitrous oxide, carbon dioxide, and cyanate, forms many coordination complexes. Further catenation is rare, although [...] (isoelectronic with carbonate and nitrate) is known.|$|E
50|$|Simple phosphoranes are reactive. Most hydrolyze <b>and</b> oxidize readily. <b>They</b> are {{therefore}} prepared using air-free techniques. Phosphoranes are more air-stable when they contain an electron withdrawing group. Some examples are Ph3P=CHCO2R and Ph3P=CHPh.

500|$|Reviews of {{the plot}} were {{generally}} positive. Mike Hale of The New York Times described the episode as [...] "taut, restrained and well acted", as well as [...] "interesting for its extremely close tracking of the Strauss-Kahn case," [...] and felt that the verdict was [...] "disappointing in dramatic terms but understandable." [...] TVfanatic.com gave the episode a 3.5/5 rating, calling the episode [...] "your typical SVU fare", but felt that the episode was missing its typical argument {{between two of the}} detectives, as they [...] "provided their own perspectives on the issue <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>usually</b> represent the division in the show's audience's members." [...] The site also felt that the crime was a little too current; the episode's original broadcast was only a month after the charges against Strauss-Kahn were dismissed.|$|E
500|$|Sloughs are {{channels}} of free-flowing water {{in between the}} sawgrass marshes. Sloughs are deeper than sawgrass marshes, about , and may stay flooded for at least 11months {{out of the year}} if not multiple years in a row. The peat beds that support sawgrass are slightly elevated and may begin abruptly creating ridges of grass. The borders between these systems are called [...] "ridge-and-slough" [...] landscapes. Aquatic animals such as turtles, young alligators, snakes, and fish live in sloughs <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>usually</b> feed on aquatic invertebrates, such as the Florida apple snail. Plants grow here, usually submerged or floating like bladderwort (Utricularia), waterlily (Nymphaeaceae), or spatterdock (Nuphar lutea). Major sloughs in the Everglades system include the Shark River Slough draining to Florida Bay, Lostmans Slough bordering The Big Cypress, and Taylor Slough in the eastern Everglades.|$|E
500|$|The {{special train}} {{consisted}} of three passenger cars pulled by one locomotive. [...] The three cars used were baggage car #210, dining car #1407, and Pullman Muskegon. [...] Altogether, the three cars weighed a total of 170short tons (155metric tons). [...] While the three cars remained constant throughout {{the run of the}} Scott Special, the locomotive did not. [...] In order to prevent delays on the trip as the train would need to stop for water and fuel, nineteen locomotives were prepared along the route so that as one reached the end of its supplies, it would relay the three cars off to the next fully fueled and ready locomotive to continue the run. [...] For the more strenuous grades over Cajon Pass in California and Raton Pass in New Mexico and Colorado, helpers were added to get the train up and over the summits. [...] At various points throughout the run, problems such as hotboxes did occur, or in one instance a complete mechanical failure of the locomotive, but in each case, the train's crew was able to get the train to the next relay point, <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>usually</b> arrived ahead of schedule.|$|E
