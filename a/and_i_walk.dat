25|$|During the Golden Age of Radio, Scott reprised {{her film}} roles in {{abridged}} radio versions. Typical were her appearances on Lux Radio Theatre: You Came Along with Van Johnson in the Robert Cummings role <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>Walk</b> Alone. Scott {{was also a}} guest host/narrator on Family Theater.|$|E
500|$|Wendell Corey plays Walter [...] "Tex" [...] Warner, bandleader of the Rough Ridin' Cowboys and the {{roadshow}} that Deke joins and revitalizes. Corey {{was known}} for his appearances in Alfred Hitchcock's Rear Window and Joseph Anthony's The Rainmaker. A decade earlier, he co-starred with Lizabeth Scott in 1947's Desert Fury <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>Walk</b> Alone.|$|E
500|$|The cast {{included}} some notable real-world strippers such as Pandora Peaks. Rhames plays a bouncer named Shad. The filmmakers, in trying actors out for Shad's part, looked for someone [...] "at least 6'2 and physically massive...any ethnicity." [...] (Rhames is African American). Reynolds played Congressman Dilbeck, and he based his performance after politicians he knew {{in his early}} life, through his father, a police chief. Reynolds was not an actor that the filmmakers originally had in mind for the part, but Reynolds wanted it, contacted Castle Rock head Rob Reiner, and traveled to Miami to audition. [...] He accepted a salary lower than what he had made in his earlier career. Moore's own daughter Rumer Willis, who was 7 years old when the film was released, played Erin's daughter Angela. As Moore explained, [...] "she [...] wanted it so badly" [...] that Moore asked that Willis be considered for the part. In reality this required Willis to see Moore dancing topless, for {{a scene in which}} Angela sees Erin performing. [...] However, Moore said that this was acceptable, as [...] "We don't shame the body, we encourage the body as something beautiful and natural, and my children bathe with me, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>walk</b> around naked." ...|$|E
60|$|Miller <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>walked</b> away to {{the club}} together, pondering deeply on the {{implications}} of the night's performance.|$|R
60|$|She turned away, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>walked</b> by {{her side}} in silence. When she reached the companion-way, she stepped inside a little abruptly.|$|R
6000|$|... "... <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>walked</b> {{a couple}} of blocks, and there was exactly the same model in Schwartz and Gulderstein's window at twenty-six fifty...." ...|$|R
2500|$|At {{times the}} TNIV offers a {{different}} or nuanced {{understanding of a}} passage. For example, in the NIV, Psalm 26:3 reads, [...] "For your love is ever before me, / <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>walk</b> continually in your truth." [...] The TNIV reads, [...] "For I have always been mindful of your unfailing love / and have lived in reliance on your faithfulness." [...] There {{are a number of}} changes in this one verse, but of special note is the TNIV's translation of the Hebrew word â€™emet. The TNIV translators took this word to mean more than simple honesty in Psalm 26:3, referring more specifically to reliability or trustworthiness.|$|E
6000|$|... "Come on, Jack. Suppose you <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>walk</b> {{back and}} see if we can locate the fellows," [...] {{suggested}} Fred. [...] "They don't know us, so they won't be suspicious." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Dan," [...] he said, [...] "let you <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>walk</b> {{around two}} or three minutes. We'll stay close by so that Sam can give us the signal in case the men show up, and we may find Hazelton." ...|$|E
6000|$|She <b>walked</b> round me, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>walked</b> round her, but {{we could}} neither of us {{discover}} anything amusing about the other. The booking-clerk said-- ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Exactly a year today, Siegmund <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>walked</b> here--by the day, Thursday. We {{went through}} the larch-wood. Have you ever been through the larch-wood?' ...|$|R
60|$|As it happened, Lord Ragnall <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>walked</b> {{together}} {{ahead of}} the others, to the first covert, which was half a mile or more away.|$|R
6000|$|... "Let Pharaoh hear me," [...] {{answered}} Userti in a cold, clear voice, [...] "they are not. In {{this great}} matter my lord the Prince walks one road <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>walk</b> another. My counsel, will, and intent {{are those of}} Pharaoh." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No; not regular fun, you know. It {{has been}} very jolly. I go down with Gerald--Carrie's husband, you know--to the barracks, and I know most of the {{officers}} of his regiment now, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>walk</b> about a bit by myself; but I have not gone beyond the Rock, yet." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'We {{brought the}} cart, maning {{to go right}} on to Castle Boterel afore ye landed,' said his father. '"Put in the horse," [...] says Martin. [...] "Ay," [...] says I, [...] "so we will;" [...] and did it straightway. Now, maybe, Martin had better go on wi' the cart for the things, and you <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>walk</b> home-along.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No," [...] she answered, [...] "because Major Vernon <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>walked</b> {{to church}} <b>and</b> heard {{a very good}} sermon upon the {{observance}} of the Sabbath." ...|$|R
60|$|Three minutes later, {{to their}} {{infinite}} surprise, the bridge thudded down to span the ditch, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>walked</b> out upon it with Bianca at my side.|$|R
60|$|On his departure, J----- <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>walked</b> a {{good way}} down Oxford Street and Holborn with him, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> took leave of him with the kindest wishes for his welfare.|$|R
6000|$|... "Foolish boy," [...] he said, [...] "hast thou {{not lived}} long enough in my shop {{to know that a}} blow will breed a brawl; that a dirk will cut the skin as fast as a needle pierces leather; that I love peace, though I never feared war, and care not which side of the {{causeway}} my daughter <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>walk</b> upon so we may keep our road in peace and quietness?" ...|$|E
60|$|And thence the {{botanist}} <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>walk</b> on to {{the apartments}} that have been set aside for us, and into which the poor little rolls of the property that has accumulated about us in Utopia, our earthly raiment, and a change of linen and the like, have already been delivered. As we go I find I have little to say to my companion, until presently I am struck by a transitory wonder {{that he should have}} so little to say to me.|$|E
60|$|DEAR MRS. ROGERS,--The {{billiard table}} {{is better than}} the doctors. It is driving out the {{heartburn}} in a most promising way. I have a billiardist on the premises, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>walk</b> not less than ten miles every day with the cue in my hand. And the walking is not the whole of the exercise, nor the most health-giving part of it, I think. Through the multitude of the positions and attitudes it brings into play every muscle in the body and exercises them all.|$|E
6000|$|When Sara <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>walked</b> {{home from}} the church Sara said, [...] "Well, {{considering}} the chances she has had, Blanche Lawrence hasn't done so well after all." ...|$|R
60|$|Jerry was {{satisfied}} {{to act as}} sentinel, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>walked</b> leisurely back to the shore, believing that much time must elapse before we would get the desired opportunity.|$|R
60|$|I {{threw the}} {{pole and line}} away, and then Rectus <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>walked</b> up to the hotel. We forgot all about Celia, who was left to go home when she chose.|$|R
6000|$|... "When our {{march is}} over, {{you should see}} our camp, and all the care {{bestowed}} on it. Our baggage and our General's tents and guard are placed quite in {{the centre of the}} camp. We have outlying sentries by twos, by threes, by tens, by whole companies. At the least surprise, they are instructed to run in on the main body and rally round the tents and baggage, which are so arranged themselves as to be a strong fortification. Sady and I, you must know, are marching on foot now, and my horses are carrying baggage. The Pennsylvanians sent such rascally animals into camp that they speedily gave in. What good horses were left, 'twas our duty to give up: and Roxana has a couple of packs upon her back instead of her young master. She knows me right well, and whinnies when she sees me, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>walk</b> by her side, and we have many a talk together on the march.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Not exactly,' Ernest {{answered}} with a smile; 'but he has not entirely learned the way we here regard these penal measures. His sympathies are one-sided as to Alexander, no doubt. He thinks merely of the hunted, wretched life the man bears about with him, and he forgets poor bleeding, groaning, down-trodden, long-suffering Russia. It is the common way of Englishmen. They do not realise Siberia and Poland and the Third Section, {{and all the rest}} of it; they think only of Alexander as of the benevolent despot who freed the serf and befriended the Bulgarian. They never remember that they have all the freedom and privileges themselves which you poor Russians ask for in vain; they do not bear in mind that he has only to sign his name to a constitution, a very little constitution, and he might walk abroad as light-hearted in St. Petersburg to-morrow as you <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>walk</b> in Regent Street to-day. We are mostly lopsided, we English, but you must bear with us in our obliquity; we have had freedom ourselves so long that we hardly know how to make due allowance for those unfortunate folks who are still in search of it.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Yes, if by His mercy I {{may indeed}} {{be brought to the}} home where they dwell! But as the power of keen {{enjoyment}} of this world was never mine, as it is given to bright healthy creatures with eyes and teeth and limbs sound and firm, so I try to remember dear Father's words, that [...] "he did not mean that he was fit to go because there was little that he cared to stop here for." [...] And I don't feel morbid like, only with a diminished capacity for enjoying things here. Of the mere animal pleasures, eating and drinking are a serious trouble. My eyes don't allow me to look about much, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>walk</b> with [...] "unshowing eye turned towards the earth." [...] I don't converse with ease; there is the feeling of difficulty in framing words. I prefer to be alone and silent. If I must talk, I like the English tongue least of all. Melanesia doesn't have such combinations of consonants and harsh sounds as our vernacular rejoices in. If I speak loud, as in preaching, I am pretty clear still; but I can't read at all properly now without real awkwardness.|$|E
6000|$|On the {{day after}} we got to Trossachs Hotel, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> don't know any place I would rather spend weeks at than there, Jone <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>walked</b> through the [...] "darksome glen" [...] where the stag, ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Are {{you going}} to speak in the tows hall to-night?" [...] the boy demanded. I {{admitted}} it. He went off, pausing once to stare back at me.... Maude <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>walked</b> on.|$|R
60|$|The old sailor chuckled {{to himself}} {{with an air}} of {{superior}} knowledge, and shuffled away with his shrimp-net, while my sister <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>walked</b> slowly homewards through the hot and stagnant air.|$|R
6000|$|... 13. I {{have left}} off Lady Kerry's bitter, and got another box of pills. I have no fits of giddiness, but only some little {{disorders}} towards it; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>walk</b> {{as much as}} I can. Lady Kerry is just as I am, only a great deal worse: I dined to-day at Lord Shelburne's, where she is, and we con ailments, which makes us very fond of each other. I have taken Mr. Harley into favour again, and called to see him, {{but he was not}} within; I will use to visit him after dinner, for he dines too late for my head: then I went to visit poor Congreve, who is just getting out of a severe fit of the gout; and I sat with him till near nine o'clock. He gave me a Tatler(9) he had written out, as blind as he is, for little Harrison. It is about a scoundrel that was grown rich, and went and bought a coat of arms at the Herald's, and a set of ancestors at Fleet Ditch; 'tis well enough, and shall be printed in two or three days, and if you read those kind of things, this will divert you. It is now between ten and eleven, and I am going to bed.|$|E
60|$|There is a {{frivolous}} and fanciful debate I {{have often}} {{had with a}} friend, about whether {{it is better to}} find one's way or to lose it, to remember the road or to forget it. I am so constituted as to be capable of losing my way in my own village and almost in my own house. And I am prepared to maintain the privilege to be a poetic one. In truth I am prepared to maintain that both attitudes are valuable, and should exist side by side. And so my friend <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>walk</b> side by side along the ways of the world, he being full of a rich and humane sentiment, because he remembers passing that way a few hundred times since his childhood; while to me existence is a perpetual fairy-tale, because I have forgotten all about it. The lamp-post which moves him to a tear of reminiscence wrings from me a cry of astonishment; and the wall which to him is as historic as a pyramid is to me as arresting and revolutionary as a barricade. Now in this, I am glad to say, my temperament is very English; and the difference is very typical of the two functions of the English and the French. But in practical politics the French have a certain advantage in knowing where they are, and knowing it is where they have been before. It is in the Roman Empire.|$|E
60|$|So far I {{have said}} nothing of Nettie. I have {{departed}} widely from my individual story. I {{have tried to}} give you the effect of the change in relation to the general framework of human life, its effect of swift, magnificent dawn, of an overpowering letting in and inundation of light, and the spirit of living. In my memory all my life before the Change has the quality of a dark passage, with the dimmest side gleams of beauty that come and go. The rest is dull pain and darkness. Then suddenly the walls, the bitter confines, are smitten and vanish, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>walk,</b> blinded, perplexed, and yet rejoicing, in this sweet, beautiful world, in its fair incessant variety, its satisfaction, its opportunities, exultant in this glorious gift of life. Had I the power of music I would make a world-wide motif swell and amplify, gather to itself this theme and that, and rise at last to sheer ecstasy of triumph and rejoicing. It should be all sound, all pride, all the hope of outsetting in the morning brightness, all the glee of unexpected happenings, all the gladness of painful effort suddenly come to its reward; it should be like blossoms new opened and the happy play of children, like tearful, happy mothers holding their first-born, like cities building to the sound of music, and great ships, all hung with flags and wine bespattered, gliding down through cheering multitudes to their first meeting with the sea. Through it all should march Hope, confident Hope, radiant and invincible, until at last it would be the triumph march of Hope the conqueror, coming with trumpetings and banners through the wide-flung gates of the world.|$|E

6000|$|The dubious {{daylight}} ended, <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>walked</b> the Town alone, unminding whither {{bound and}} why, As from each gaunt street and gaping square a mist of light ascended [...] And dispersed upon the sky.|$|R
6000|$|... 'No; I've not {{a moment}} to stay. I'm to meet Bury again at Woodside at six o'clock, he drove me there, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>walked</b> on, looking in at your lodgings by the way, Ulick.' ...|$|R
