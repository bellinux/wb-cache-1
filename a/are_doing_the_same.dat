A band of {{survivors}} reveal that they lured the creatures {{to eradicate the}} Tolmekians, and <b>are</b> <b>doing</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> to the Valley. They capture Nausicaä to prevent her from warning the Valley, but {{with the help of}} Asbel and his mother, Nausicaä escapes on a glider. Flying home, she finds two Pejite soldiers baiting thousands of Ohm into the Valley using a wounded baby Ohm. The Tolmekians deploy tanks and the Giant Warrior against them, but their tanks cannot stop Ohm, and the Giant Warrior, hatched prematurely, disintegrates.|$|E
5|$|The next scene {{shows the}} {{sarcophagus}} with Constantina, {{the daughter of}} the Emperor Constantine, asleep on top of it, wearing a crown. She has been afflicted with leprosy, and heard of the vision at Agnes' tomb, and come to pray there. The presence at left of a young man on crutches, not in the source, suggests that others <b>are</b> <b>doing</b> <b>the</b> <b>same.</b> The sleeping woman beside the tomb is either another such, or an attendant on the princess. As Constantina sleeps, Agnes, holding her lamb, appears to her, saying Si in xpm (Christum) credideris sanaberis ("If you believe in Christ you will be healed", an adaptation of the text in the source). In the final scene, the cured, and baptized, Constantina tells her crowned father the story, with the inscription Hec est virgo sapiens una de numero prudencium ("This is a wise virgin, one of the number of the prudent").|$|E

2500|$|Horacio de la Vega, {{marketing}} director for Guadalajara 2011, cited the 1992 Summer Olympics in Barcelona as the inspiration for infrastructure improvements. [...] "Barcelona wasn't Barcelona before it got the Olympic Games. In a more modest sense, we <b>are</b> <b>doing</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> in Guadalajara", he said. The budget was estimated at US $200 million, of which $180 million was for sports infrastructure. Some of the funding went to general street improvement and public transportation.

2500|$|The game runs in {{non-linear}} [...] "real-time", {{meaning that}} as McCoy investigates and gathers clues, the NPC characters <b>are</b> <b>doing</b> <b>the</b> <b>same,</b> completing their own objectives and performing random actions {{elsewhere in the}} game world. A {{good example of this}} is found in the computer mainframe, which is accessible from the police headquarters. When the player uploads their KIA data into the mainframe, any evidence collected by other Blade Runners is automatically downloaded into the player's KIA. This tends to be random, with different pieces of evidence discovered by different Blade Runners becoming available at different times of the game.|$|E
2500|$|Most {{research}} on memory and aging {{has focused on}} how older adults perform worse at a particular memory task. [...] However, researchers have also discovered that simply saying that older adults <b>are</b> <b>doing</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> thing, only less of it, is not always accurate. [...] In some cases, older adults seem to be using different strategies than younger adults. [...] For example, brain imaging studies have revealed that older adults {{are more likely to}} use both hemispheres when completing memory tasks than younger adults. In addition, older adults sometimes show a positivity effect when remembering information, which seems to be a result of the increased focus on regulating emotion seen with age. For instance, eye tracking reveals that older adults showed preferential looking toward happy faces and away from sad faces.|$|E

2500|$|His {{style has}} been noted for its unique instrumentation, {{utilizing}} {{a vast array of}} ethnic instruments, recorded sounds, synthetic textures, and the traditional orchestra, often concurrently. [...] When asked about his inclination for embracing new techniques and constantly shifting his musical palette throughout his career, Goldsmith said, [...] "It seems like it's me, and that's that! [...] Certain composers <b>are</b> <b>doing</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> thing over and over again, which I feel is sort of uninteresting. [...] I don't find that you grow very much in that way. [...] I like to keep changing, trying to do new things. [...] Basically, I'm saying the same thing with a little different twist on it. Once you {{get caught up in the}} creative process, something inside takes over, and your subconscious just does it for you." ...|$|E
2500|$|The various monographs {{thus are}} not {{attempts}} to present what Nietzsche or Spinoza strictly intended, but re-stagings of their ideas in different and unexpected ways. Deleuze's peculiar readings aim {{to enact the}} creativity he believes is the acme of philosophical practice. A parallel in painting Deleuze points to is Francis Bacon's Study after Velázquez—it is quite beside the point to say that Bacon [...] "gets Velasquez wrong". Similar considerations apply, in Deleuze's view, to his own uses of mathematical and scientific terms, pace critics such as Alan Sokal: [...] "I'm not saying that Resnais and Prigogine, or Godard and Thom, <b>are</b> <b>doing</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> thing. I'm pointing out, rather, that there are remarkable similarities between scientific creators of functions and cinematic creators of images. And {{the same goes for}} philosophical concepts, since there are distinct concepts of these spaces." ...|$|E
2500|$|Thomas {{revealed}} in 2013 {{that he had}} discovered, through a Data Protection request, {{that he had been}} under police surveillance {{as a result of his}} investigative journalism for Channel 4 and the New Statesman and put on the domestic extremist database. He cautioned other journalists, [...] "I apologise for the boastful tone but the police have monitored public interest investigations in my case since 1999. More importantly if the police are keeping tabs on a lightweight like myself then they <b>are</b> <b>doing</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> and more to others. This is more than supposition as I know of other NUJ members on the database." [...] The following year, Thomas and five journalists and photographers who had also been under surveillance by the London Metropolitan Police Service's National Domestic Extremism and Disorder Intelligence Unit (NDEDIU) began legal action against the force. The NDEDIU's reports obtained by Thomas described him as a [...] "general rabble rouser and alleged comedian" [...] and stated, [...] "Mark Thomas stops. Has quantity of cress on rear of his cycle." [...] He told The Independents Adam Lusher, [...] "The police's powers of observation are to be admired, I did indeed have cress on my bike. [...] Is it really suitable to spend taxpayers' money observing the movement of cress?" ...|$|E
