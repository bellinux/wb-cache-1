Jennings moderated the final debate among the Democratic presidential candidates in March, and anchored Peter Jennings Reporting: Who Is Ross Perot? and a subsequent 90-minute town forum with Perot and a studio audience in June. On September 9, 1992, ABC {{announced that it}} would be switching the format of its political coverage to give less recognition to staged sound bites. [...] "We're aware that <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>you</b> are turned off by the political process and that many of you put {{at least some of the}} blame on us," [...] Jennings told viewers on World News Tonight. [...] "We'll only devote time to a candidate's daily routine if it is more than routine. There will be less attention to staged appearances and sound bites designed exclusively for television." [...] After Bill Clinton was elected as president in November 1992, Jennings featured the new administration in two of his specials for children; he anchored President Clinton: Answering Children's Questions in February 1993; and Kids in the Crossfire: Violence in America in November 1993, a live special from a Washington, D.C. junior high school which featured Attorney General Janet Reno and rapper MC Lyte.|$|E

Brian decided to leave the band in July, so we've {{had plenty of time to}} let the initial shock die down. We're aware that <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>you</b> already knew, so we apologize for not announcing this sooner. There were many reasons. He thought long and hard about his decision, and he came to the conclusion that he would like to do other things than play bass for the band. We respect him for it. We'd be lying to say that we're not all completely bummed that Brian won't be a part of Relient K anymore. And though we know things won't be the same without him, it must be said that we have always valued our friendships with him more than our on-stage relationship.|$|E

2500|$|Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times {{gave the}} film {{four out of}} five stars, saying [...] "Perhaps the most {{engaging}} thing about [...] "Puss in Boots" [...] is that it never takes itself too seriously." [...] Stephen Holden of The New York Times gave the film three and a half stars out of five, saying [...] "It is a cheerfully chaotic jumble of fairy tale and nursery rhyme characters parachuted into a Spanish storybook setting." [...] Lou Lumenick of the New York Post gave the film one and a half stars out of four, saying [...] "Basically, this toon is a tired riff on Sergio Leone's spaghetti Westerns, punctuated by more puns and cat jokes than you can shake a litter box at." [...] Claudia Puig of USA Today gave the film three out of four stars, saying [...] "With his impeccable comic timing and lyrical Spanish accent, Banderas' swashbuckling charmer is an undeniable treat." [...] Michael O'Sullivan of The Washington Post gave the film three out of four stars, saying [...] "Puss in Boots" [...] proves {{there is at least one}} cat with multiple lives. The feature-length animated spinoff - a star turn for the popular [...] "Shrek" [...] supporting character voiced by Antonio Banderas - is almost shockingly good. And not just because <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>you</b> will approach it with lowered expectations."

"Some of you {{may feel}} that it's out of place here to talk on a {{strictly}} highbrow and artistic subject, but I {{want to come out}} flatfooted and ask you boys to O.K. the proposition of a Symphony Orchestra for Zenith. Now, where <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>you</b> make your mistake is in assuming that if you don't like classical music and all that junk, you ought to oppose it. Now, I want to confess that, though I'm a literary guy by profession, I don't care a rap for all this long-haired music. I'd rather listen to a good jazz band any time than to some piece by Beethoven that hasn't any more tune to it than a bunch of fighting cats, and you couldn't whistle it to save your life! But that isn't the point. Culture has become as necessary an adornment and advertisement for a city to-day as pavements or bank-clearances. It's Culture, in theaters and art-galleries and so on, that brings thousands of visitors to New York every year and, to be frank, for all our splendid attainments we haven't yet got the Culture of a New York or Chicago or Boston--or at least we don't get the credit for it. The thing to do then, as a live bunch of go-getters, is to CAPITALIZE CULTURE; to go right out and grab it.|$|E
