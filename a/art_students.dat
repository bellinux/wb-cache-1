5|$|Barbera took art {{classes at}} the <b>Art</b> <b>Students</b> League of New York and the Pratt Institute and was hired {{to work in the}} ink and paint {{department}} of Fleischer Studios. In 1932, he joined the Van Beuren Studios as an animator and storyboard artist. He worked on cartoon series such as Cubby Bear and Rainbow Parades, and Tom and Jerry. This Tom and Jerry series starred two humans; it was unrelated to Barbera's later cat-and-mouse series. When Van Beuren closed down in 1936, Barbera moved over to Paul Terry's Terrytoons studio.|$|E

5|$|Louise had artistic {{training}} from childhood, {{first with}} Susan Durant from 1864, then Mary Thornycroft from 1867, and further lessons with Edgar Boehm. She also then attended National Art Training School, or NATS, which {{marks the first}} time a member of the British royal family attended a public education institution. Like many women artists in the nineteenth century, Louise had to make do with training intended for industrial designers and art teachers rather than fine artists.

5|$|The {{curriculum}} emphasizes writing; {{students are}} required to complete a semester project each term on a topic chosen in conjunction with an advisor, and are required to complete a research paper during their third year. All students must pass a basic-studies comprehensive examination to register for upper-level courses, and at least one area-studies comprehensive examination (usually in their area of concentration) to graduate. A senior thesis is required of all students. Usually an analytic or expository essay, it may also be a piece of original fiction, poetry, a performance or work of visual <b>art.</b> <b>Students</b> are encouraged to present their theses orally, and the public is invited to the presentations.|$|E

40|$|When {{we teach}} {{business}} courses for liberal <b>arts</b> <b>students,</b> our challenges will be {{how we can}} effectively teach students who have different majors, years, interests, and backgrounds in the same class. For example, if we focus on business major students, we may lose other students from different majors. This problem will appear in two critical educational components for liberal <b>arts</b> <b>students,</b> which are teaching and mentoring. This means that we will need two things. One is teaching effectiveness in a whole class {{and the other is}} mentoring effectiveness for individual students in the class. Therefore, we must consider class management and individual-level treatments of students carefully in order to improve teaching effectiveness for liberal <b>arts</b> <b>students.</b>   In this paper, our goal is to propose such a comprehensive education model particularly for instructors who teach business courses for liberal <b>arts</b> <b>students.</b>   We propose our own comprehensive model based on various literature reviews and empirical studies.   Then, we research on effectiveness of our model empirically. Particularly, we try to test if our model could satisfy both teaching and mentoring effectiveness in order to validate our theoretical arguments and this initial educational model for liberal <b>arts</b> <b>students.</b> This study will give us a clearer picture of the comprehensive business education model to make teaching more effective for liberal <b>arts</b> <b>students.</b>   </p...|$|R

5|$|By {{the early}} 1930s she was {{attending}} art {{classes at the}} <b>Art</b> <b>Students</b> League of New York, and in 1941 she had her first solo exhibition. A student of Hans Hofmann and Chaim Gross, Nevelson experimented with early conceptual art using found objects, and dabbled in painting and printing before dedicating her lifework to sculpture. Usually created out of wood, her sculptures appear puzzle-like, with multiple intricately cut pieces placed into wall sculptures or independently standing pieces, often 3-D. A unique feature of her work is that her figures are often painted in monochromatic black or white. A figure in the international art scene, Nevelson was showcased at the 31st Venice Biennale. Her work is seen in major collections in museums and corporations. Nevelson {{remains one of the}} most important figures in 20th-century American sculpture.|$|E

5|$|Starting in 1929, Nevelson studied art {{full-time}} under Kenneth Hayes Miller and Kimon Nicolaides at the <b>Art</b> <b>Students</b> League. Nevelson credited {{an exhibition}} of Noh kimonos at the Metropolitan Museum of Art {{as a catalyst for}} her to study art further. In 1931 she sent her son Mike to live with family and went to Europe, paying for the trip by selling a diamond bracelet that her now ex-husband had given her on the occasion of Mike's birth. In Munich she studied with Hans Hofmann before visiting Italy and France. Returning to New York in 1932 she once again studied under Hofmann, who was serving as a guest instructor at the <b>Art</b> <b>Students</b> League. She met Diego Rivera in 1933 and worked as his assistant on his mural Man at the Crossroads at Rockefeller Plaza. The two had an affair which caused a rift between Nevelson and Rivera's wife, Frida Kahlo, an artist Nevelson greatly admired. Shortly thereafter, Nevelson started taking Chaim Gross's sculpture classes at the Educational Alliance. She continued to experiment with other artistic mediums, including lithography and etching, but decided to focus on sculpture. Her early works were created from plaster, clay and tattistone. During the 1930s Nevelson began exhibiting her work in group shows. In 1935, she taught mural painting at the Madison Square Boys and Girls Club in Brooklyn as part of the Works Progress Administration (WPA). She worked for the WPA in the easel painting and sculpture divisions until 1939. For several years, the impoverished Nevelson and her son walked through the streets gathering wood to burn in their fireplace to keep warm; the firewood she found served as the starting point for the art that made her famous. Her work during the 1930s explored sculpture, painting and drawing. Early ink and pencil drawings of nudes show the same fluidity seen in the works of Henri Matisse. Nevelson also created terra-cotta semi-abstract animals and oil paintings.|$|E
5|$|The School for Creative and Performing Arts {{opened in}} August 1973, {{as the only}} grade four through six school for the {{performing}} arts in the country and the first public school that combined all of the arts in a single program. The curriculum included art, instrumental music, choral music, dance and drama, and was not organized strictly by grade, but permitted students to advance as soon as their abilities allowed. Murray explained: Fourth through sixth grades will be together in classes. Teaching will often be done in teams. <b>Art</b> <b>students</b> will design scenery for plays, written by drama students. Music pupils will supply the music. They work together regardless of age. In reading classes they will read according to their own individual levels. A brilliant music student, capable of interpreting Beethoven's wildest dreams, might stumble on fifth level reading. This does not make him a dunce simply a slow reader.|$|E
5|$|The make-up for Citizen Kane {{was created}} and applied by Maurice Seiderman (1907–1989), a junior {{member of the}} RKO make-up department. Seiderman's family came to the United States from Russia in 1920, {{escaping}} persecution. As a child Seiderman had won a drawing competition and received an apprenticeship at the Moscow Art Theatre, where {{his father was a}} wigmaker and make-up artist. In New York his uncle was a theatrical scenic painter, and he helped Seiderman get into the union. He worked on Max Reinhardt's 1924 production of The Miracle and with the Yiddish Art Theatre, and he studied the human figure at the <b>Art</b> <b>Students</b> League of New York. After he moved to Los Angeles he was hired first by Max Factor and then by RKO. Seiderman had not been accepted into the union, which recognized him as only an apprentice, but RKO nevertheless used him to make up principal actors.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{reports on}} a {{teaching}} strategy that I have developed over {{the last ten years}} to enhance the learning of music theory and history for first year performing <b>arts</b> <b>students</b> at a regional Australian university. The strategy was developed in response to the difficulties some performing <b>arts</b> <b>students</b> face with academic learning in their first year of study, and in particular, their reluctance to engage with academic learning that they see as irrelevant to their training as performing artists. This paper describes the teaching strategy, which has at its core live performance, and includes discussion of relevant literature, responses from students over several years, thus providing evidence that this strategy is effective in engaging these performing <b>arts</b> <b>students</b> in their academic learning. The paper concludes with suggestions for future research to enhance the learning for tertiary performing <b>arts</b> <b>students...</b>|$|R

5|$|During the {{production}} of Paths of Glory in Munich in early 1957, Kubrick met and romanced the German actress Christiane Harlan, who played a small though memorable role in the film. Kubrick married Harlan in 1958, and the couple remained together 40 years, {{until his death in}} 1999. Besides his stepdaughter, they had two daughters together: Anya Renata (April 6, 1959 – July 7, 2009) and Vivian Vanessa (born August 5, 1960). In 1959 they settled into a home at 316 South Camden Drive in Beverly Hills with Harlan's daughter, Katherina, aged six. They also lived in New York, during which time Christiane studied art at the <b>Art</b> <b>Students</b> League of New York, later becoming an independent artist. The couple moved to the United Kingdom in 1961 to make Lolita, and Kubrick hired Peter Sellers to star in his next film, Dr. Strangelove, Sellers was unable to leave the UK, so Kubrick made Britain his permanent home thereafter. The move was quite convenient to Kubrick, since he shunned the Hollywood system and its publicity machine, and he and Christiane had become alarmed with the increase in violence in New York.|$|E
