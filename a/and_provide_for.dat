5|$|By May 1933, two draft bills had emerged, a {{cautious}} and legalistic one by John Dickinson (Under Secretary of Commerce) and an ambitious one focusing on trade associations by Hugh Johnson. Many leading businessmen—including Gerard Swope (head of General Electric), Charles M. Schwab (chairman of Bethlehem Steel Corporation), E. H. Harriman (chairman of the Union Pacific Railroad), and Henry I. Harriman, {{president of the}} U.S. Chamber of Commerce—helped draft the legislation. A two-part bill, the first section promoting cooperative action among business to achieve fair competition <b>and</b> <b>provide</b> <b>for</b> national planning and a second section establishing a national public works program, was submitted to Congress on May 15, 1933.|$|E
5|$|During the arc, Rukia's past is explored. She died as {{an infant}} and was sent to Soul Society with her older sister, Hisana. Though Hisana {{initially}} tried to protect <b>and</b> <b>provide</b> <b>for</b> Rukia, she could not ensure her own survival while caring for a baby as well, and thus abandoned Rukia. As Rukia grew up, she befriended Renji Abarai, and entered the Soul Reaper academy, where she was adopted into the Kuchiki family. One year prior to the adoption, Hisana died after asking her husband, Byakuya, to find and adopt Rukia as his sister. This remains unknown to Rukia until Byakuya confesses it to her. When she was accepted into the 13th Division, Rukia befriended the lieutenant of her division, Kaien Shiba, and trained under him. During {{the course of a}} mission, Kaien was irreversibly possessed by a hollow and Rukia inadvertently kills him.|$|E
5|$|However {{the series}} of power struggles between the lesser nobility (szlachta), the higher nobility (magnates), and elected kings, {{undermined}} citizenship values and gradually eroded the government's authority, ability to function <b>and</b> <b>provide</b> <b>for</b> national defense. The infamous liberum veto procedure was used to paralyze parliamentary proceedings beginning {{in the second half}} of the 17th century. After {{the series of}} devastating wars in the middle of the 17th century (most notably the Chmielnicki Uprising and the Deluge), Poland-Lithuania stopped being an influential player in the politics of Europe. During the wars the Commonwealth lost an estimated 1/3 of its population (higher losses than during World War II). Its economy and growth were further damaged by the nobility's reliance on agriculture and serfdom, which, combined with the weakness of the urban burgher class, delayed the industrialization of the country.|$|E

5|$|In England, {{prior to}} the nineteenth century, common law {{considered}} children to be the property of their father. However, {{the economic and social}} changes that occurred during the nineteenth century lead to a shift in ideas about the dynamics of the family. Industrialization separated the home and the workplace, keeping fathers away from their children in order to earn wages <b>and</b> <b>provide</b> <b>for</b> their family. Conversely, mothers were expected to stay in the home and care for the household and the children. Important social changes such as women's suffrage and child development theories allowed for ideas surrounding the importance of maternal care.|$|E
5|$|Lead {{poisoning}} is preventable. This includes {{by individual}} efforts such as removing lead-containing {{items from the}} home, workplace efforts such as improved ventilation and monitoring, and nationwide policies such as laws that ban lead in products such as paint and gasoline, reduce allowable levels in water or soil, <b>and</b> <b>provide</b> <b>for</b> cleanup of contaminated soil. The major treatments are removal {{of the source of}} lead and the use of medications that bind lead so it can be eliminated from the body, known as chelation therapy. Chelation therapy in children is recommended when blood levels are greater than 40–45µg/dl. Medications used include dimercaprol, edetate calcium disodium, and succimer.|$|E
5|$|Metro {{planners}} {{designed the}} system with passenger safety and order maintenance as primary considerations. The open vaulted ceiling design of stations {{and the limited}} obstructions on platforms allow few opportunities to conceal criminal activity. Station platforms are built away from station walls to limit vandalism <b>and</b> <b>provide</b> <b>for</b> diffused lighting of the station from recessed lights. Metro's attempts to reduce crime, combined with how the station environments were designed with crime prevention in mind, has contributed to Metro being among the safest and cleanest subway systems in the United States. There are nearly 6,000 video surveillance cameras used across the system to enhance security.|$|E

Core drilling commenced that September while the Bureau of Reclamation accelerated its studies and designs for the dam. It would still help control floods <b>and</b> <b>provide</b> <b>for</b> irrigation and hydroelectricity, though at a reduced capacity. Most importantly, it would not raise its reservoir high enough to irrigate the plateau around the Grand Coulee. However, the dam's design provided for future raising and upgrading.|$|E
5|$|RPGs {{can suffer}} {{in the area}} of exploration. Traditional RPGs {{encourage}} exploration of every detail of the game world, <b>and</b> <b>provide</b> <b>for</b> a more organic experience in which NPCs are distributed according to the internal logic of the game world or plot. Action games reward players for quick movement from location to location, and tend to ensure that no obstacles occur along the way. Games such as Mass Effect streamline the player's movements across the game world by indicating which NPCs can be interacted with, and by making it easier for players to find locations and shopkeepers who can exchange items for money or goods. Some of the best characteristics of RPGs can be lost when these road blocks are eliminated in the name of streamlining the player's experience.|$|E
