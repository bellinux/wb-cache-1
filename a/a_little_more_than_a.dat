5|$|The {{contract}} for Metro's fare collection system was awarded in 1975 to Cubic Transportation Systems. Electronic fare collection using paper magnetic stripe cards started on July 1, 1977, <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> {{year after the}} first stations opened. Prior to electronic fare collection, exact change fareboxes were used. Metro's historic paper farecard system is also shared by Bay Area Rapid Transit, which Cubic won a {{contract for}} in 1974. Any remaining value stored on the paper cards was printed on the card at each exit, and passes were printed with the expiration date.|$|E
5|$|When the rarefication wave {{reaches the}} other (open) {{end of the}} tube, air rushes in to fill the slight vacuum. <b>A</b> <b>little</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> 'neutral' amount of air enters the tube and causes a {{compression}} wave to travel back up the tube (image 4). Once the compression wave reaches the mouthpiece end of the 'tube', it is reflected again back down the pipe. However at this time, either because the compression wave 'bumped' the reed or because of the natural vibration cycle of the reed, the gap opens and another 'puff' of air is sent down the pipe.|$|E
5|$|All known planets transit the star; {{this means}} that all six planets' orbits appear to cross {{in front of their}} star as viewed from the Earth's perspective. Their inclinations {{relative}} to Earth's line of sight, or how far above or below the plane of sight they are, vary by <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> degree. This allows direct measurements of the planets' periods and relative diameters (compared to the host star) by monitoring each planet's transit of the star. Simulations suggest that the mean mutual inclinations of the planetary orbits are about 1°, meaning the system is probably more coplanar (flatter) than the Solar System, where the corresponding figure is 2.3°.|$|E

5|$|Kagame {{was born}} to a Tutsi family in {{southern}} Rwanda. His mother was younger sister to King Ndahindurwa's wife. When he was two years old, the Rwandan Revolution ended centuries of Tutsi political dominance; his family fled to Uganda, where he {{spent the rest of}} his childhood. In the 1980s, Kagame fought in Yoweri Museveni's rebel army, becoming a senior Ugandan army officer after Museveni's military victories carried him to the Ugandan presidency. Kagame joined the Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF), which invaded Rwanda in 1990; leader Fred Rwigyema died early in the war and Kagame took control. By 1993, the RPF controlled significant territory in Rwanda and a ceasefire was negotiated. The assassination of Rwandan President Juvénal Habyarimana was the starting point of the genocide, in which Hutu extremists killed <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> million Tutsi and moderate Hutu combined. Kagame resumed the civil war, and ended the genocide with a military victory.|$|E
