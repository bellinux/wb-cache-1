40|$|AbstractThe 68 kDa Src {{substrate}} associated during mitosis is an RNA binding protein with Src homology 2 and 3 domain binding sites. A {{role for}} Src <b>associated</b> <b>in</b> mitosis 68 as an adaptor protein in signaling transduction {{has been proposed}} in different systems such as T-cell receptors. In the present work, we have sought to assess the possible role of Src <b>associated</b> <b>in</b> mitosis 68 in insulin receptor signaling. We performed in vivo studies in HTC-IR cells and in vitro studies using recombinant Src <b>associated</b> <b>in</b> mitosis 68, purified insulin receptor and fusion proteins containing either the N-terminal or the C-terminal Src homology 2 domain of p 85 phosphatidylinositol- 3 -kinase. We have found that Src <b>associated</b> <b>in</b> mitosis 68 is a substrate of the insulin receptor both in vivo and in vitro. Moreover, tyrosine-phosphorylated Src <b>associated</b> <b>in</b> mitosis 68 was found to associate with p 85 phosphatidylinositol- 3 -kinase in response to insulin, as assessed by co-immunoprecipitation studies. Therefore, Src <b>associated</b> <b>in</b> mitosis 68 {{may be part of}} the signaling complexes of insulin receptor along with p 85. In vitro studies demonstrate that Src <b>associated</b> <b>in</b> mitosis 68 <b>associates</b> with the Src homology 2 domains of p 85 after tyrosine phosphorylation by the activated insulin receptor. Moreover, tyr-phosphorylated Src <b>associated</b> <b>in</b> mitosis 68 binds with a higher affinity to the N-terminal Src homology 2 domain of p 85 compared to the C-terminal Src homology 2 domain of p 85, suggesting a preferential association of Src <b>associated</b> <b>in</b> mitosis 68 with the N-terminal Src homology 2 domain of p 85. This association may be important for the link of the signaling with RNA metabolism...|$|R

Kenya's victories over Sri Lanka and Zimbabwe, among others– and a forfeit by the New Zealand team, which refused to play in Kenya because of security concerns– enabled Kenya to reach the semi-finals, the best result by an <b>associate.</b> <b>In</b> the final, Australia made 359 runs {{for the loss of}} two wickets, the largest ever total in a final, defeating India by 125 runs.|$|E
5|$|As {{time went}} on, Louis XVIII {{realised}} that France would never accept {{an attempt to}} return to the Ancien Régime. Accordingly, he created another policy in 1805 with a view toward reclaiming his throne: a declaration that was far more liberal than his former ones. It repudiated his Declaration of Verona, promised to abolish conscription, retain Napoleon I's administrative and judicial system, reduce taxes, eliminate political prisons, and guarantee amnesty to everyone who did not oppose a Bourbon Restoration. The opinions expressed in the declaration were largely those of the Count of Avaray, Louis's closest <b>associate</b> <b>in</b> exile.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{having the}} stronger, more {{powerful}} army, Carinus held the weaker position. His rule was unpopular, {{and it was}} later alleged that he had mistreated the Senate and seduced his officers' wives. It is possible that Flavius Constantius, the governor of Dalmatia and Diocletian's <b>associate</b> <b>in</b> the household guard, had already defected to Diocletian in the early spring. When the Battle of the Margus began, Carinus' prefect Aristobulus also defected. In {{the course of the}} battle, Carinus was killed by his own men. Following Diocletian's victory, both the western and the eastern armies acclaimed him augustus. Diocletian exacted an oath of allegiance from the defeated army and departed for Italy.|$|E
40|$|ObjectiveThe {{purpose of}} this study was to clarify the role and {{clinical}} significance of metastasis <b>associated</b> <b>in</b> colon cancer 1 in resected stage I non–small cell lung cancers. MethodsTumor specimens were collected from 146 consecutive patients who underwent a complete resection for stage I lung adenocarcinoma from 1998 to 2007 at the University of Occupational and Environmental Health. We analyzed the expression of metastasis <b>associated</b> <b>in</b> colon cancer 1 mRNA of primary lung adenocarcinomas by real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction. ResultsThe average postoperative observation period was 49. 4 months. Thirteen (8. 9 %) of 146 patients had recurrences after surgery. Overexpression of metastasis <b>associated</b> <b>in</b> colon cancer 1 mRNA was identified in 62 patients (42. 5 %). Metastasis <b>associated</b> <b>in</b> colon cancer 1 was overexpressed in 9 (69. 2 %) of 13 patients and 53 (39. 9 %) of 133 patients with and without recurrence, respectively (P = . 004). The median metastasis <b>associated</b> <b>in</b> colon cancer 1 copy number was 3. 0 and 1. 4 in patients with and without tumor recurrence, respectively. Metastasis <b>associated</b> <b>in</b> colon cancer 1 overexpression was associated with poorer disease-free survival according to the survival analysis (P = . 033). ConclusionsMetastasis <b>associated</b> <b>in</b> colon cancer 1 gene overexpression may be a useful marker for predicting postoperative recurrence in patients with lung adenocarcinoma after surgery...|$|R

5|$|Giraffe groups {{tend to be}} sex-segregated {{although}} mixed-sex groups made {{of adult}} females and young males are known to occur. Particularity stable giraffe groups are those made of mothers and their young, which can last weeks or months. Social cohesion in these groups is maintained by the bonds formed between calves. Female association appears {{to be based on}} space-use and individuals may be matrilineally related. In general, females are more selective than males in who they associate with in regards to individuals of the same sex. Young males also form groups and will engage in playfights. However, as they get older males become more solitary but may also <b>associate</b> <b>in</b> pairs or with female groups. Giraffes are not territorial, but they have home ranges. Male giraffes occasionally wander far from areas that they normally frequent.|$|E
5|$|In April 1936, {{he and the}} Minister of the Interior Ion Inculeț {{allowed the}} a youth {{congress}} to gather in Târgu Mureș, {{aware of the fact}} that it was masking a fascist gathering; delegates to the congress, traveling in a special train commissioned by the government, vandalized Ion Duca's memorial plate in Sinaia train station, and, upon their arrival in Târgu Mureș, made public their violent anti-Semitic agenda.

5|$|It is ectomycorrhizally {{associated}} with several tree species and is symbiotic with them. In Europe, these include hardwood and, less frequently, conifer species. It appears most commonly under oaks, but also under beeches, chestnuts, horse-chestnuts, birches, filberts, hornbeams, pines, and spruces. In other areas, A.phalloides {{may also be}} {{associated with}} these trees or with only some species and not others. In coastal California, for example, A.phalloides is associated with coast live oak, {{but not with the}} various coastal pine species, such as Monterey pine. In countries where it has been introduced, it has been restricted to those exotic trees with which it would <b>associate</b> <b>in</b> its natural range. There is, however, evidence of A.phalloides associating with hemlock and with genera of the Myrtaceae: Eucalyptus in Tanzania and Algeria, and Leptospermum and Kunzea in New Zealand. This suggests the species may have invasive potential.|$|E

This suggestion is unpopular, as it is clear that Diocletian meant for Maximian to act {{with a certain amount of}} independence. It may be posited, however, that Diocletian felt the need to bind Maximian closer to him, by making him his empowered <b>associate,</b> <b>in</b> order to avoid the possibility of having him striking some sort of deal with Carausius.|$|E
5|$|Oscar Finley and Wally Figg are the bickering {{partners}} {{of a small}} law firm in the South Side of Chicago; in fact, {{for much of the}} time they are just a pair of ambulance chasers. Oscar's character holds the firm together despite the childish and unethical behavior of Wally, his junior partner. Their bickering is often mediated by Rochelle, the highly competent African American secretary, who had learned a lot of law in her eight years in the office. Meanwhile, David Zinc, a graduate of the Harvard Law School, is completely fed up with the grinding and dehumanizing – though well-paid – life of an <b>associate</b> <b>in</b> the law firm of Rogan Rothberg, where in five years of work he had never seen the inside of a courtroom, in fact, David's expertise was in long-term bonds a job he hated. David suddenly breaks away, goes on a drinking binge and by chance finds himself at the Finley & Figg office. Feeling an elevating sense of freedom and vowing never to go back, Zinc willingly relegates himself to working for the two disreputable street lawyers and ambulance chasers.|$|E
