A crucial {{point is the}} availability of a complete set of data. However, in some cases this requirement cannot be fulfilled.

Several algorithms have been reported in literature, but the majority of them require a-priori knowledge of the shape and composition of the sample or they present a high computational cost. Recently a new algorithm has been proposed. It allows to recover the lacking projections without any a-priori assumption and with a relatively low computational cost.

Non-piloted radiative ignition of the paper was found to occur more easily in microgravity than in normal gravity. Ignition of the sample was achieved under all conditions studied (shuttle cabin air, 21 %– 50 % O 2 in JAMIC), with transition to flame spread occurring for all but the lowest oxygen and flow conditions.

40|$|The {{problem of}} {{broadband}} noise generated by turbulence impinging on a downstream blade row is examined from a theoretical viewpoint. Equations are derived for sound power spectra {{in terms of}} 3 dimensional wavenumber spectra of the turbulence. Particular attention is given to issues of turbulence inhomogeneity associated with the near field of the rotor and variations through boundary layers. Lean and sweep of the rotor or stator cascade are also handled rigorously with a full derivation of the relevant geometry and definitions of lean and sweep angles. Use of the general theory is illustrated by 2 simple theoretical spectra for homogeneous turbulence. Limited comparisons are made with data from model fans designed by Pratt & Whitney, Allison, and Boeing. Parametric studies for stator noise are presented showing trends with Mach number, vane count, turbulence scale and intensity, lean, and sweep. Two conventions are presented to define lean and sweep. In the "cascade system" lean is a rotation out of its plane and sweep is a rotation of the airfoil in its plane. In the "duct system" lean is the leading edge <b>angle</b> viewing the <b>fan</b> from the front (along the fan axis) and sweep is the <b>angle</b> viewing the <b>fan</b> from the side (,perpendicular to the axis).

The <b>fan</b> <b>angle</b> was shown to be directly related to the limiting air flow velocity. Despite the convective heating from the upstream flame, the downstream flame was inhibited due to the 'oxygen shadow' of the upstream flame for the air flow conditions studied. Downstream flame spread rates in air, measured after upstream flame spread was complete and extinguished, were slower than upstream flame spread rates at the same flow.
