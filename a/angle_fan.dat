A crucial {{point is the}} availability of a complete set of data. However, in some cases this requirement cannot be fulfilled.

In order to perform a reconstruction of the image from the partial set of projections, the data must be preprocessed. Several algorithms have been reported in literature, but the majority of them require a-priori knowledge of the shape and composition of the sample or they present a high computational cost. Recently a new algorithm has been proposed. It allows to recover the lacking projections without any a-priori assumption and with a relatively low computational cost. It is based on a morphing technique, which affords in general terms the problem of curve matching and has been specialized to the case of tomographic reconstruction.

40|$|The {{problem of}} {{broadband}} noise generated by turbulence impinging on a downstream blade row is examined from a theoretical viewpoint. Equations are derived for sound power spectra {{in terms of}} 3 dimensional wavenumber spectra of the turbulence. Particular attention is given to issues of turbulence inhomogeneity associated with the near field of the rotor and variations through boundary layers. Lean and sweep of the rotor or stator cascade are also handled rigorously with a full derivation of the relevant geometry and definitions of lean and sweep angles. Use of the general theory is illustrated by 2 simple theoretical spectra for homogeneous turbulence. Limited comparisons are made with data from model fans designed by Pratt & Whitney, Allison, and Boeing. Parametric studies for stator noise are presented showing trends with Mach number, vane count, turbulence scale and intensity, lean, and sweep. Two conventions are presented to define lean and sweep. In the "cascade system" lean is a rotation out of its plane and sweep is a rotation of the airfoil in its plane. In the "duct system" lean is the leading edge <b>angle</b> viewing the <b>fan</b> from the front (along the fan axis) and sweep is the <b>angle</b> viewing the <b>fan</b> from the side (,perpendicular to the axis).
