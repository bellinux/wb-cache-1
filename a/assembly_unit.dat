50|$|In Human papillomavirus, two late {{proteins}} {{are involved}} in capsid formation: a major (L1) and a minor (L2) protein, in the approximate proportion 95:5%. L1 forms a pentameric <b>assembly</b> <b>unit</b> of the viral shell {{in a manner that}} closely resembles VP1 from polyomaviruses. Intermolecular disulphide bonding holds the L1 capsid proteins together. L1 capsid proteins can bind via its nuclear localisation signal (NLS) to karyopherins Kapbeta(2) and Kapbeta(3) and inhibit the Kapbeta(2) and Kapbeta(3) nuclear import pathways during the productive phase of the viral life cycle. Surface loops on L1 pentamers contain sites of sequence variation between HPV types. L2 minor capsid proteins enter the nucleus twice during infection: in the initial phase after virion disassembly, and in the productive phase when it assembles into replicated virions along with L1 major capsid proteins. L2 proteins contain two nuclear localisation signals (NLSs), one at the N-terminal (nNLS) and the other at the C-terminal (cNLS). L2 uses its NLSs to interact with a network of karyopherins in order to enter the nucleus via several import pathways. L2 from HPV types 11 and 16 was shown to interact with karyopherins Kapbeta(2) and Kapbeta(3). L2 capsid proteins can also interact with viral dsDNA, facilitating its release from the endocytic compartment after viral uncoating.|$|E

Since computer numerical control machine tool is a large system with complicated structure and function, and there are complex association relationships among quality characteristics in assembly process, then it is difficult and inaccurate to analyze the whole computer numerical control machine tool quality characteristic association at one time.

40|$|Using subfragments of the {{simian virus}} 40 (SV 40) core origin, we {{demonstrate}} that two alternative modules {{exist for the}} assembly of T-antigen (T-ag) double hexamers. Pentanucleotides 1 and 3 and the early palindrome (EP) constitute one <b>assembly</b> <b>unit,</b> while pentanucleotides 2 and 4 and the AT-rich region constitute a second, relatively weak, <b>assembly</b> <b>unit.</b> Related studies indicate that on the unit made up of pentanucleotide 1 and 3 and the EP <b>assembly</b> <b>unit,</b> the first hexamer forms on pentanucleotide 1 and that owing to additional protein-DNA and protein-protein interactions, the second hexamer is able to form on pentanucleotide 3. Oligomerization on the unit made up of pentanucleotide 2 and 4 and the AT-rich region is initiated by assembly of a hexamer on pentanucleotide 4; subsequent formation of the second hexamer takes place on pentanucleotide 2. Given that oligomerization on the SV 40 origin is limited to double-hexamer formation, {{it is likely that}} only a single module is used for the initial assembly of T-ag double hexamers.

40|$|AbstractBackground: The {{structure}} of simian virus 40 (SV 40), previously determined at 3. 8 å resolution, shows how its pentameric VP 1 <b>assembly</b> <b>units</b> are tied together by extended C-terminal arms. In order to define more precisely the possible assembly mechanisms, we have refined the structure at 3. 1 å resolution. Results New {{data from a}} high-intensity synchrotron source {{have been used for}} phase extension by electron-density averaging and refinement, exploiting only the strict 5 -fold non-crystallographic symmetry for the real-space averaging steps. The accurate model enables us to study important structural features of the virus particle in detail. The remarkably invariant core of the VP 1 pentamer bears the docking sites for the C-terminal arms from other pentamers. These contacts are the principal way in which pentameric <b>assembly</b> <b>units</b> are linked together in the capsid. Only at the interface between five-coordinated and six-coordinated pentamers do the pentamer cores appear to interact strongly. There are two cation-binding sites per VP 1 monomer, seen in a soaking experiment with gadolinium nitrate. These sites are quite close to each other at the interfaces between pentamers. Conclusion We propose that the contact between five-coordinated and six-coordinated pentamers may help to generate a six-pentamer nucleus, with which further pentamers can assemble to generate the complete particle. Calcium ions probably stabilize the {{structure of}} the assembled particle, rather than direct its assembly...|$|R
