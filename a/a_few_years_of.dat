5|$|All {{three letters}} of John were likely written within <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>years</b> <b>of</b> each other, and {{internal}} {{evidence indicates that}} they were written after the Gospel of John, placing them {{in the second half}} of the first century. This dating makes sense given their allusions and opposition to Gnostic and docetic teaching, which denied the full humanity of Jesus, and which was gaining ascendancy at the end of the first century.|$|E

5|$|The {{concept of}} {{evolution}} was widely accepted in scientific circles within <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>years</b> <b>of</b> {{the publication of}} Origin, but the acceptance of natural selection as its driving mechanism was much less widespread. The four major alternatives to natural selection in the late 19th century were theistic evolution, neo-Lamarckism, orthogenesis, and saltationism. Alternatives supported by biologists at other times included structuralism, Georges Cuvier's teleological but non-evolutionary functionalism, and vitalism.|$|E
5|$|The rise {{to power}} of the Bolsheviks marked the turning point for the {{newspaper}} however, as the new government enacted increasingly repressive measures against the publication of dissident literature and against anarchist agitation in general, and after <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>years</b> <b>of</b> low-profile publishing, the Golos Truda collective was finally expunged by the Stalinist regime in 1929.|$|E

5|$|After <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>years</b> <b>of</b> {{unsteady}} peace, in 1648 the Second English Civil War broke out, {{this time}} with Charles' Royalist supporters joined by Scottish forces. The Parliamentary navy was based in the Downs, protected by the nearby Henrician castles, but by May a Royalist insurrection was underway across Kent. Sandown Castle declared for the King, and the soldier and former naval captain Major Keme then convinced the garrisons at Deal and Walmer to surrender. Sandgate Castle probably joined the Royalists as well. With both the coastal fortresses and the navy now under Royalist control, Parliament feared that foreign forces might be landed along the coast, or military aid sent to the Scots.|$|E

Wigan Borough, founded in 1919, became the town's first club {{to play in the}} Football League when in 1921 they became founder members of the Football League Third Division North.

5|$|In 1525 or 1526, Gérard {{withdrew his}} son from the Collège de Montaigu and {{enrolled}} {{him in the}} University of Orléans to study law. According to contemporary biographers Theodore Beza and Nicolas Colladon, Gérard believed that Calvin would earn more money as a lawyer than as a priest. After <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>years</b> <b>of</b> quiet study, Calvin entered the University of Bourges in 1529. He was intrigued by Andreas Alciati, a humanist lawyer. Humanism was a European intellectual movement which stressed classical studies. During his 18-month stay in Bourges, Calvin learned Koine Greek, a necessity for studying the New Testament.|$|E

5|$|M-150 {{is a state}} {{trunkline}} {{highway in}} the US state of Michigan that runs through Rochester Hills and Rochester. It is more commonly known as Rochester Road and runs from a southern terminus at the M-59 freeway north through downtown Rochester to a northern terminus at Tienken Road. M-150 has been a state trunkline since around 1930, and within <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>years</b> <b>of</b> its commissioning, it was extended south through Royal Oak and north into rural Oakland County. After changes in 1960s, the highway terminated in Troy at Interstate75 (I-75) on the southern end and Tienken Road on the north. Since 1987, it has ended at M-59.|$|E
5|$|Throughout his life, William Gibbs and {{his wife}} Matilda Blanche Crawley-Boevey (known as Blanche), principally lived in London, for {{the greater part of}} his {{marriage}} at 16 Hyde Park Gardens, which the family owned until Blanche's death. But as he travelled regularly on business to the Port of Bristol he required a residence in the area; thus it was, in 1843, he came to buy Tyntes Place, which he subsequently renamed Tyntesfield. Within <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>years</b> <b>of</b> making his purchase, Gibbs began a major program of rebuilding and enlarging of the mansion.|$|E
5|$|Coalhouse Fort is an {{artillery}} fort {{built in the}} 1860s to guard the lower Thames from seaborne attack. It stands at Coalhouse Point in Essex on the north bank of the river, at a location near East Tilbury that was vulnerable to raiders and invaders. It was the last {{in a series of}} fortifications dating back to the 15th century and was the direct successor to a smaller mid-19th century fort built on the same site. Constructed during a period of tension with France, its location on marshy ground caused problems from the start and led to a lengthy construction process. The fort was equipped with a variety of large-calibre artillery guns and the most modern defensive facilities at the time, including shell-proof casemates protected by granite facing and cast-iron shields. However, its lengthy construction and the rapid pace of artillery development at the time meant that it was virtually obsolete for its original purpose within <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>years</b> <b>of</b> its completion.|$|E

5|$|During {{the early}} 1950s, one of Luton's {{greatest}} sides emerged under manager Dally Duncan. The team included Gordon Turner, {{who went on}} to become Luton's all-time top goalscorer, Bob Morton, who holds the record for the most club appearances, and Syd Owen, an England international. During this period, Luton sides also featured two England international goalkeepers, Ron Baynham and Bernard Streten, as well as Irish internationals Seamus Dunne, Tom Aherne and George Cummins. This team reached the top flight {{for the first time in}} 1955–56, after finishing the season in second place behind Birmingham City on goal average. <b>A</b> <b>few</b> <b>years</b> <b>of</b> success followed, including an FA Cup Final appearance against Nottingham Forest in 1958–59; at the end of the season, Owen was voted FWA Footballer of the Year. However, the club was relegated the following season and, by 1964–65, was playing in the fourth tier.|$|E
5|$|Following <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>years</b> <b>of</b> uneasy peace, the Yorkists' {{rebellion}} erupted once again, and John Neville fought alongside {{with his}} father and elder brother Thomas at the Battle of Blore Heath in September 1459. Although the Earl of Salisbury fought off the Lancastrians, both his sons were captured, and John, with Thomas, spent the next year imprisoned. Following his release in 1460, he took part in the Yorkist government. His father and brother died in battle just after Christmas 1460, and in February the next year, John - now promoted to the peerage as Lord Montagu - and Warwick fought the Lancastrians again at St Albans. John was once again captured and not released until his cousin Edward - York's son - won a decisive victory at Towton in March 1461, and was crowned King Edward IV.|$|E
5|$|Lingbao scriptures arose as {{a direct}} result of the success of earlier Shangqing texts. Lingbao scriptures are all based on a text known as the Text of the Five Talismans (Wufujing), which was {{compiled}} by Ge Chaofu between 397 and 402 and borrowed from the work of Ge Hong, his great uncle. Being the most ancient Lingbao text, the Five Talismans provided the framework of the remainder of the Lingbao canon, which was based on the five directions. Because all Lingbao texts descended from the Five Talismans, it was believed that they had been revealed to Ge Xuan, presumably the original owner of the Five Talismans. Ge Xuan is purported to have transmitted the Lingbao texts first to his disciple Zheng Siyuan, who then transmitted it to Ge's grandnephew Ge Hong (284-364), who is well known for his alchemical innovations. The claim that the Lingbao texts derive from Ge Xuan, however, was likely a way of legitimizing them through the exaggeration of their antiquity. In reality, they were likely assembled by Ge Chaofu himself. Within <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>years</b> <b>of</b> the texts' dissemination, they had become extremely popular.|$|E
