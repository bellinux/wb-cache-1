Given a simple, binary component feed, <b>analytical</b> <b>methods</b> such as the McCabe–Thiele method or the Fenske equation {{can be used to}} assist in the design. For a multi-component feed, computerized simulation models are used both for design and subsequently in operation of the column as well.

5|$|Beryllium is {{a health}} and safety issue for workers. Exposure to {{beryllium}} in the workplace {{can lead to a}} sensitization immune response and can over time develop chronic beryllium disease (CBD). The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) in the United States researches these effects in collaboration with a major manufacturer of beryllium products. The goal of this research is to prevent sensitization and CBD by developing {{a better understanding of the}} work processes and exposures that may present a potential risk for workers, and to develop effective interventions that will reduce the risk for adverse health effects. NIOSH also conducts genetic research on sensitization and CBD, independently of this collaboration. The NIOSH Manual of <b>Analytical</b> <b>Methods</b> contains methods for measuring occupational exposures to beryllium.|$|E

40|$|It {{is often}} in the {{interest}} of a designer to know the transient state of stress in a plate subjected to an underwater explosion. In this paper, an <b>analytical</b> <b>method</b> based on Taylor’s fluid-solid interaction (FSI) model, Mindlin plate theory, Laplace transform, and its inversion is proposed to examine the elastic dynamic response of a plate subjected to an underwater explosion. This <b>analytical</b> <b>method</b> includes shear deformation, the moments and membrane stress in the plate, and the FSI effect and considers a full profile of possibilities. The results of the response-time histories and the response distribution on the plate in terms of displacements and stresses from the <b>analytical</b> <b>method</b> are compared with finite element analysis (FEA) to validate this method, and the comparison indicates good agreement. Comparison of the acceleration at the center of an air-backed plate between the <b>analytical</b> <b>method</b> and the experiment from relevant literature, shows good agreements, and the <b>analytical</b> <b>method</b> and its FSI model are validated. The influence of the FSI is investigated in detail. All extreme values of the response-time histories decrease as the thickness increases for the non-FSI case.
