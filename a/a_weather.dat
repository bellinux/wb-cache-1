50|$|<b>A</b> <b>weathering</b> rind is <b>a</b> discolored, {{chemically}} altered, outer zone or {{layer of}} a discrete rock fragment {{formed by the}} processes of weathering. The inner boundary of <b>a</b> <b>weathering</b> rind approximately parallels the outer surface of the rock fragment {{in which it has}} developed. Rock fragments with weathering rinds normally are discrete clasts, ranging in size from pebbles to cobbles or boulders. They typically occur either lying {{on the surface of the}} ground or buried within sediments such as alluvium, colluvium, or glacial till. <b>A</b> <b>weathering</b> rind represents the alteration of the outer portion of a rock by exposure to air or near surface groundwater over a period of time. Typically, <b>a</b> <b>weathering</b> rind may be enriched with either iron or manganese (or both), and silica, and oxidized to a yellowish red to reddish color. Often <b>a</b> <b>weathering</b> rind exhibits multiple bands of differing colors.|$|R

5|$|A {{subtropical}} cyclone is <b>a</b> <b>weather</b> {{system that}} has some characteristics of a tropical cyclone and some characteristics of an extratropical cyclone. They can form in a wide band of latitudes, from the equator to 50°. Although subtropical storms rarely have hurricane-force winds, they may become tropical in nature as their cores warm. From an operational standpoint, a tropical cyclone is usually not considered to become subtropical during its extratropical transition.|$|E
5|$|<b>A</b> <b>weather</b> {{phenomenon}} {{known as}} the föhn (with an identical effect to the chinook wind) can occur at all {{times of the year}} and is characterised by an unexpectedly warm wind, bringing air of very low relative humidity {{to the north of the}} Alps during rainfall periods on the southern face of the Alps. This works both ways across the alps but is more efficient if blowing from the south due to the steeper step for oncoming wind from the south. Valleys running south to north trigger the best effect.|$|E
5|$|Data {{collected}} by land locations coding in METAR are conveyed worldwide via phone lines or wireless technology. Within many nations' meteorological organizations, this data is then plotted onto <b>a</b> <b>weather</b> map using the station model. A station {{model is a}} symbolic illustration showing the weather occurring at a given reporting station. Meteorologists created the station model to plot a number of weather elements in a small space on weather maps. Maps filled with dense station-model plots {{can be difficult to}} read, but they allow meteorologists, pilots, and mariners to see important weather patterns.|$|E

5|$|Early in its {{developmental}} stages, Imbudo affected {{portions of}} Micronesia, particularly Ulithi. There, <b>a</b> <b>weather</b> station measured a peak wind gust of 85km/h (53mph); winds of similar intensity {{were reported in}} Yap. Rainfall from Imbudo in Micronesia peaked at 226mm (8.89in) over a six-hour period on Yap. The rainfall from the passing tropical cyclone caused $75,000in property damage and $25,000in agricultural and crop-related damage.|$|E
5|$|In 1943, the Navy {{asked for}} control of Sea Cloud and Nourmahal, another former yacht {{converted}} into <b>a</b> <b>weather</b> ship. On April 9, 1943, the United States Navy commissioned Sea Cloud as USS Sea Cloud (IX-99), though she maintained a Coast Guard crew. She was assigned to Task Force 24.|$|E
5|$|In January 2014, Sydney-based web {{developers}} Katia Eirin and Bennett Wong created Doge Weather, <b>a</b> <b>weather</b> {{website and}} mobile app incorporating the meme.

High winds, surf, and rain also affected Sapwuafik. Rough seas killed a person on Pohnpei. Crop damage in the country totaled $3million, and overall property damage was estimated at $100million, mostly on Chuuk.|$|E
5|$|Nearly a {{year after}} the passage of Igor, <b>a</b> <b>weather</b> buoy from St. John's was spotted near the Shetland Islands north of Scotland on September12, 2011. In early October, Newfoundland was again struck by a {{tropical}} cyclone– Hurricane Ophelia. Though a weaker storm, Ophelia caused more damage than expected as it destroyed infrastructure repaired in the wake of Igor. The mayor of Marystown criticized government officials for not increasing the size of repairs, especially to culverts, to account for flooding.|$|E
5|$|Persona 4 {{takes place}} in a fictional Japanese {{countryside}} and is indirectly related to earlier Persona games. The player-named protagonist is a high-school student who moved into the countryside from the city for a year. During his year-long stay, he becomes involved in investigating mysterious murders while harnessing the power of summoning Persona. The game features <b>a</b> <b>weather</b> forecast system with events happening on foggy days to replace the moon phase system implemented in the previous games.|$|E

5|$|Planetary atmospheres are {{affected}} by the varying insolation or internal energy, leading to the formation of dynamic weather systems such as hurricanes, (on Earth), planet-wide dust storms (on Mars), a greater-than-Earth-sized anticyclone on Jupiter (called the Great Red Spot), and holes in the atmosphere (on Neptune). At least one extrasolar planet, HD 189733 b, has been claimed to have such <b>a</b> <b>weather</b> system, similar to the Great Red Spot but twice as large.|$|E
5|$|The Belle Plaine {{service area}} (mile 26) opened on July 24, 2003, {{replacing}} a previous structure {{at the site}} that had been destroyed by a grease fire.

5000|$|Huntite, {{dolomite}} and magnesite {{appear to}} be so very closely related, that a genetic relationship seems to be implied. In {{a number of instances}} all three carbonates are found in close association; for example Faust (1953) described huntite occurring together with dolomite and magnesite (amongst other minerals); Carpenter (1961) found huntite associated with aragonite, magnesium calcite and dolomite; Larrabee (1969) reported on huntite together with (amongst many others) aragonite, calcite, dolomite and magnesite in serpentinite on <b>a</b> <b>weathered</b> dunite rock. <b>A</b> <b>weathered</b> basalt in Australia was found to contain huntite in association with magnesite (Cole & Lancucki, 1975). Huntite together with magnesite was found by Calvo et al. (1995) in lake sediments of Northern Greece. Huntite in combination with magnesite occurs in <b>a</b> <b>weathered</b> serpentinite near Hrubšice, Czech Republic according to Němec (1981) According to the mineral and locations database of [...] "mindat.org" [...] huntite, together with aragonite, calcite, dolomite and magnesite {{can be found in the}} [...] "U Pustého Mlýna" [...] quarry near Hrubšice, Czech Republic.http://www.mindat.org/min-1951.html ...|$|R
