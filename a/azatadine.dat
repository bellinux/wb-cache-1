50|$|Trinalin is {{the trade}} {{name of an}} {{antihistamine}} and decongestant formulation consisting of one milligram <b>azatadine</b> maleate and 120 milligrams of pseudoephedrine sulfate in a base of acacia and other inactive ingredients.|$|E
50|$|C. elegans {{is able to}} {{transform}} the tricyclic antidepressants amitriptyline and doxepin, the tetracyclic antidepressant mirtazapine, the muscle relaxant cyclobenzaprine, the typical antipsychotic chlorpromazine {{as well as the}} antihistamine and anticholinergic methdilazine and <b>azatadine.</b> It is also able {{to transform}} the antihistamines brompheniramine, chlorpheniramine and pheniramine.|$|E
40|$|The {{metabolism}} of the antihistamine <b>azatadine</b> by the zygomycete fungus Cunninghamella elegans ATCC 9245 was investigated. Within 72 h {{from the}} addition of the drug to 48 -h-old cultures grown in Sabouraud dextrose broth, 95 % of <b>azatadine</b> was biotransformed. Two major metabolites, 7 -hydroxyazatadine (25 %) and 8 -hydroxyazatadine (50 %), and two minor metabolites, N-desmethylazatadine and 9 -hydroxyazatadine, were isolated by high-performance liquid chromatography and characterized by mass spectrometric and proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopic analyses...|$|E
40|$|A {{total of}} 132 {{patients}} with symptoms associated with either upper respiratory allergies or {{the common cold}} was enrolled in this 5 -day study. <b>Azatadine</b> maleate/pseudoephedrine sulfate syrup was compared to placebo using a double-blind design. Evaluation of efficacy was based on results in eighty patients and that of safety in 115. Onset of relief was significantly better (p = 0 · 03) with <b>azatadine</b> maleate/pseudoephedrine sulfate syrup than with placebo. However this was due mainly to the distribution of patients who indicated 'no relief': ten in the combination group as opposed to sixteen in the placebo group. Over-all evaluation of results indicated that a significantly greater degree ofsymptomatic relief was achieved with the active test formulation than with placebo on both Days 3 (p = 0 · 03) and 5 (p = 0 · 04) of therapy. Somnolence was the most frequently reported side-effect...|$|E
40|$|Due to the {{difficulty}} of monitoring trace levels of cyproheptadine (CYP) residues in complicated biological matrices, specific adsorption materials for the preconcentration and clean-up of CYP are indispensable. In this work, CYP was extracted from urine using dummy molecularly imprinted SPE (DMISPE) to avoid leakage of the imprinting molecules during the desorption phase. For synthesis of DMISPE, <b>azatadine</b> (AZA) was employed as the dummy template, methacrylic acid (MAA) as the monomer, ethylene glycol dimethacrylate (EGDMA) as the cross-linker, 2, 2 '-azobis(2 -methylpropionitrile) (AIBN) as the initiator, and dichloromethane as the porogen solvent. An LC-MS/MS method was used to analyze CYP. Two MRM (multiple reaction monitoring) transitions for each analyte were monitored using diphenylpyraline hydrochloride (DPP. HCl), which was used as an internal standard. The advantages of DMISPE include obtaining less complex chromatograms and reducing ion suppression in ESI. The process efficiencies for DMISPE and SPE were 80 % and 12 %, respectively. In addition, the demonstrated reusability of the DMISPE cartridges is an advantage compared with single-use SPE cartridges or immunoaffinity materials...|$|E
40|$|SUMMARY A {{series of}} {{comparative}} trials on nine popular and pharmacologically distinct regimens {{for the treatment}} of hay fever was undertaken in the course of normal general practice in the pollen seasons of 1981 - 83. One hundred and forty doctors recruited 640 patients to assess the overall usefulness of the treatments on daily diaries. 'Usefulness' was scored on a linear analogue scale weighing up the degree of hay fever symptoms during treatment, side effects and ease of use of the preparation. The regimen with the highest overall usefulness score was beclomethasone diproprionate with sodium cromoglycate eye drops (Beconase and Opticrom). Although the score was not significantly higher than those for methylprednisolone acetate (Depo-Medrone), astemizole (Hismanal) or terfenadine (Triludan), Beconase/Opticrom scored signif-icantly better than mequitazine (Primalan), chlorpheniramine maleate (Piriton), sodium cromoglycate nasal insufflation with xylometazoline/antazoline eye drops (Rynacrom and Otrivine-Antistin) and <b>azatadine</b> maleate (Optimine). Beconase/Opticrom was first in rank order with respect to all the other regimens {{for the treatment of}} both mild and severe hay fever. Dimethothiazine (Banistyl), also shown to be useful, has since been withdrawn from prescription...|$|E
