5|$|Like its predecessor, no {{official}} album accompanied the motion picture; however, there are ten songs {{featured in the}} film itself and two music videos embedded in its subsequent home release. Two singles of The Sounds, Dance with Me and Rock 'n Roll, were promoted on Kimberly's car stereo. Besides these, the music video of Seven Days a Week accompanied the film's DVD. Middle of Nowhere by The Blank Theory was both heard on Evan's car radio and inserted in the DVD along with its music video. Rocky Mountain High by John Denver was covered twice in the end credits by Pete Snell and Jude Christodal. Christodal also performed My Name is Death during Brian's death and the end credits. Other songs integrated were Highway to Hell by AC/DC (on Kimberly's car AV), Jon F. Hennessy by FT (on Rory's vehicle audio), Vitamin by Incubus (during Evan's house fire) <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>Got</b> You by (hed) Planet Earth (during Rory's party).|$|E
25|$|The {{one that}} {{finished}} my career was when I got hit in my eye by John Maguire from Queensland...He got one to really rear up, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> back to hook {{and it went}} between the visor and the top part of the helmet and smashed in my eye. That finished me. After that, I didn't want to be there. I thought of other things I wanted to do in life. Even though I continued playing on in Shield {{for two or three}} years, I just didn't want to be there.|$|E
25|$|I was {{lobbying}} at the Council of Europe and at Parliament; I {{was over}} in Washington, in Jo'burg, in South America. It was 'let's get guns for the Contras', that sort of stuff. I was enjoying it immensely, I got to go with these guys and fire off AK-47s. I always like to go where the action is, and for that period in the Reagan/Thatcher days, it was great fun, it was all expenses paid <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> to see the world. I {{used to think that}} World Briefing was a bit funny. The only scary thing about those publications was the mailing listpeople like George Bushand the fact that Hart would talk to the head of British Intelligence for an hour. I used to think it was us having a laugh, putting some loony right-wing sell in, and that somebody somewhere was taking it seriously. You've got to understand that we had a sense of humour about this.|$|E

500|$|Following the album's release, Milian {{was cast}} in a lead role in the horror film Pulse, {{starring}} alongside Kristen Bell and Ian Somerhalder.

I didn’t want to sanitize it, and I didn’t, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> my ass kicked for it." ...|$|E

I was out {{shopping}} at the time <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> this call on my mobile. I was just like, 'OH MY GOD!'

500|$|In 2001, Chabon {{reflected}} {{on the success of}} his first novel by saying that while [...] "the upside was that I was published <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> a readership, ... downside ... was that, emotionally, this stuff started happening and I was still like, 'Wait a minute, is my thesis done yet?' It took me a few years to catch up." [...] In 1991, Chabon published A Model World, a collection of short stories, many of which had been published previously in The New Yorker.|$|E

500|$|I enjoyed {{working with}} her very much. Mariah <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> along very great. We had never talked and never sang {{together}} before. We just had a chance for camaraderie, singer-to-singer, artist-to-artist, that kind of thing. We just laughed and talked and laughed and talked and sang in between that ... It's {{good to know that}} two ladies of soul can still be friends. We talked about doing other things together, enterprise-wise, which is cool, because she's got a good, vivid mind, that girl. She's a smart lady. I really like Mariah.|$|E

500|$|At {{the early}} stages of filming, stars Connelly and Bowie found it {{difficult}} to interact naturally with the puppets they shared most of their scenes with. Bowie told Movieline [...] "I had some initial problems working with Hoggle and the rest because, for one thing, what they say doesn't come from their mouths, but {{from the side of the}} set, or from behind you." [...] Connelly remarked, [...] "it was a bit strange , but I think both Dave [...] <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> over that and just took it as a challenge to work with these puppets.
