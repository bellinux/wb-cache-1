50|$|As {{with many}} double acts, Lee <b>and</b> <b>Herring</b> {{performed}} as contrasting personalities: one mature and straight-laced (Lee) {{and the other}} puerile <b>and</b> cheeky (<b>Herring).</b> As with several other double acts, Lee <b>and</b> <b>Herring</b> had a certain irony to their style and constantly checked themselves and made reference to this. The characters of Lee <b>and</b> <b>Herring</b> were parodies <b>and</b> exaggerations of their real life selves.|$|R

5|$|Although Buffy <b>and</b> <b>her</b> friends {{deal with}} death every week, often in very gruesome and fantastic ways, in this episode they are bewildered {{by the natural}} death of Joyce Summers, the {{divorced}} mother of Buffy <b>and</b> <b>her</b> sister Dawn and occasionally a mother figure to their friends. They struggle to comprehend what the loss means {{to each of them}} and to the group. Buffy must begin to face her life <b>and</b> <b>her</b> duties as the Slayer without parental support and comfort. The episode was stripped of all music—a regular staple of the Buffy series—and disorienting effects were included to convey the sense of displacement and loss associated with the death of a close family member.|$|E

5|$|Before, Beyoncé's {{approach}} to heartbreak was always literal, her voice <b>and</b> <b>her</b> words declaiming her feelings with a studied earnestness {{that at times}} was difficult to believe, let alone connect with. 'Irreplaceable' is the first song in which Beyoncé lies to herself, and the way her voice perfectly betrays that lie (revealing a giveaway tremble in the stiff upper lip of the lyrics) simultaneously renders it her most sophisticated <b>and</b> <b>her</b> most honest performance to date.|$|E
