5|$|Music {{and dance}} are an {{integral}} part of Cameroonian ceremonies, festivals, social gatherings, and storytelling. Traditional dances are highly choreographed and separate men and women or forbid participation by one sex altogether. The goals of dances range from pure entertainment to religious devotion. Traditionally, music is transmitted orally. In a typical performance, <b>a</b> <b>chorus</b> <b>of</b> singers echoes a soloist.|$|E
5|$|This is not {{say there}} was no popular concern; by 2005 for example <b>a</b> <b>chorus</b> <b>of</b> US {{executives}} along with trade union and mid-ranking government officials had been speaking out about what they perceived to be unfair trade practices by China.|$|E
5|$|Alice Faye sang it with Louis Prima's {{band in the}} 1939 film Rose of Washington Square. It was {{signature}} tune of Hi Gang!, {{a popular}} BBC Radio comedy show of the early WWii years, starring the American actors Bebe Daniels and her husband Ben Lyon, who had settled in London, and the British comedian Vic Oliver. In 1943, Daffy Duck sang <b>a</b> <b>chorus</b> <b>of</b> it in Yankee Doodle Daffy.|$|E

5|$|In the 19th century, {{approaches}} to Handel in German and English-speaking countries diverged further. In Leipzig in 1856, the musicologist Friedrich Chrysander and the literary historian Georg Gottfried Gervinus founded the Deutsche Händel-Gesellschaft {{with the aim}} of publishing authentic editions of all Handel's works. At the same time, performances in Britain and the United States moved away from Handel's performance practice with increasingly grandiose renditions. Messiah was presented in New York in 1853 with <b>a</b> <b>chorus</b> <b>of</b> 300 and in Boston in 1865 with more than 600.|$|E
5|$|Vocalist Andrew Schwab has {{remained}} the band's lead lyricist. Schwab has said most lyrics are based on his emotions. He also tries to incorporate social commentary from literature. Prominent influences include comic book artist Chris Ware and writers Chris Bachelder, Don DeLillo, Aldous Huxley, George Orwell, and T. S. Eliot. He has written lyrics around {{a variety of topics}} that include alcohol abuse ("One-Armed Man"), conformity ("S.M.C."), emptiness ("Evil (<b>A</b> <b>Chorus</b> <b>of</b> Resistance)"), greed ("Cold and Calculated"), nightlife ("Molotov"),, spirituality ("Chapter 2"), pornography ("P.S."), and child molestation ("Sioux Lane Spirits").|$|E
5|$|Barton's {{subsequent}} conviction, {{a four-month}} suspended sentence for the earlier assault on Ousmane Dabo at Manchester City, was handed out while serving this sentence. He returned to playing action on 30 August 2008, six {{days before his}} FA hearing, as a second-half substitute during Newcastle's 3–0 defeat to Arsenal. He came on to <b>a</b> <b>chorus</b> <b>of</b> boos from the Arsenal supporters. Shortly into this return match, Barton was involved in an incident with Samir Nasri, putting in a strong tackle, for which the referee did not give a foul. The tackle, though hard, was legal. Minutes later, Nasri deliberately clipped Barton while tracking back, {{for which he was}} booked. At the end of the match, Newcastle manager Kevin Keegan was involved in an altercation with Nasri and Arsenal captain William Gallas, in regards to the incident.|$|E

5|$|In 1869, Boston was {{the site}} of the National Peace Jubilee, a massive gala to honor {{veterans}} and to celebrate the return of peace. Conceived by composer Patrick Gilmore, who had served in an army band, the celebration was held in a colossal arena in Boston's Back Bay neighborhood designed to hold 100,000 attendees and specifically built for the occasion. A new hymn was commissioned for the occasion, written by Oliver Wendell Holmes Sr. and set to American Hymn by Matthais Keller. Spanning five days, the event featured <b>a</b> <b>chorus</b> <b>of</b> nearly 11,000 and an orchestra of more than 500 musicians. It was the largest musical gathering on the continent up to that time.|$|E
5|$|In the city, Argante and Armida, {{in danger}} {{from a common}} enemy, become {{reconciled}} and prepare their troops for battle. Goffredo's army advances, and battle finally commences. After a struggle for supremacy, Jerusalem falls to Goffredo; Argante is overcome and captured by Rinaldo, while Armida is taken by Eustazio. Rinaldo and Almirena celebrate their love and forthcoming marriage. Armida, accepting her defeat, breaks the wand which {{is the source of}} her evil power and together with Argante embraces Christianity. Goffredo expresses his forgiveness to his beaten foes and sets them free, before victors and vanquished join in <b>a</b> <b>chorus</b> <b>of</b> reconciliation.|$|E
5|$|The {{main reason}} for calling is to allow male frogs to attract a mate. Males may call {{individually}} or there may be <b>a</b> <b>chorus</b> <b>of</b> sound where numerous males have converged on breeding sites. Females of many frog species, such as the common tree frog (Polypedates leucomystax), reply to the male calls, which acts to reinforce reproductive activity in a breeding colony. Female frogs prefer males that produce sounds of greater intensity and lower frequency, attributes that stand out in a crowd. The rationale for this {{is thought to be}} that by demonstrating his prowess, the male shows his fitness to produce superior offspring.|$|E

5|$|Before the 2010–11 season began, {{there was}} much {{anticipation}} around the league over the fates of an elite pack of free agents, featuring the likes of Bosh, Dwyane Wade, LeBron James, and Amar'e Stoudemire. Bosh and James eventually chose to converge in Miami with Wade, and the sign-and-trade transaction that ensued resulted in the Raptors receiving two first-round draft picks and a trade exception from Miami. Prior to this, Toronto had drafted Ed Davis, also a left-handed power forward like Bosh. After Bosh left, Colangelo sought to trade Calderón, Evans and the disenchanted Türkoğlu for Tyson Chandler, Leandro Barbosa, and Boris Diaw, but the trade involving Chandler collapsed at the last minute, as Chandler {{was traded to the}} Dallas Mavericks instead. Belinelli was then traded to New Orleans Hornets for Julian Wright, and 13 games into the season, Jack, David Andersen, and Marcus Banks to New Orleans for Peja Stojaković and Jerryd Bayless. Bosh's first return to Toronto was received to <b>a</b> <b>chorus</b> <b>of</b> boos, but not as nearly as harsh as what former Raptors Tracy McGrady and Vince Carter received upon their respective returns. Without Bosh, Toronto as a team regressed and were only able to secure 22 wins in the regular season.|$|E
5|$|Brazil's {{substitution}} of Paulinho for Fernandinho and Ramires for Hulk {{resulted in an}} improvement in their play after the restart; Germany goalkeeper Manuel Neuer saved shots in quick succession from Oscar, Paulinho and Fred. By the 60th minute, though, the Germans came close to scoring again, with Júlio César denying Müller twice. Another German goal indeed came in the 69th minute – Lahm's low cross found substitute André Schürrle, who side-footed {{the ball into the}} net from close range. 10 minutes later, Schürrle ran onto Müller's cross from the left and hit a powerful shot over Júlio César at the near post. At this point with the score at 7–0, the remaining home fans gave the Germans a standing ovation, applauding both Schürrle's goal and Germany's overall performance. Close to the end, Özil received a through ball but just missed the chance to make it eight. Seconds later, Oscar received a long ball and scored in the 90th minute to make it 7–1. The final score matched Brazil's worst ever loss (6–0 to Uruguay in 1920) and ended a run of 62 competitive home matches unbeaten for Brazil. The Brazilian players left the pitch in tears to <b>a</b> <b>chorus</b> <b>of</b> boos.|$|E
5|$|On 12 November 1880 Wagner {{conducted}} a private {{performance of the}} prelude for his patron Ludwig II of Bavaria at the Court Theatre in Munich. The premiere of the entire work was given in the Festspielhaus at Bayreuth on 26 July 1882 under the baton of the Jewish-born German conductor Hermann Levi. Stage designs were by Max Brückner and Paul von Joukowsky who took their lead from Wagner himself. The Grail hall {{was based on the}} interior of Siena Cathedral which Wagner had visited in 1880, while Klingsor's magic garden was modelled on those at the Palazzo Rufolo in Ravello. In July and August 1882 sixteen performances of the work were given in Bayreuth conducted by Levi and Franz Fischer. The production boasted an orchestra of 107, <b>a</b> <b>chorus</b> <b>of</b> 135 and 23 soloists (with the main parts being double cast). At the last of these performances, Wagner took the baton from Levi and conducted the final scene of act 3 from the orchestral interlude to the end.|$|E

5|$|The gradual {{switch from}} amateur to {{professional}} continued in 1968, when {{for the first}} time the chorus was supplemented by a smaller, professional group of singers; the mix of amateur and professional choristers continued over the next five years. At the end of the 1960s the main WNO company, now a year-round operation, consisted of 8 salaried principal singers, 57 guest soloists and <b>a</b> <b>chorus</b> <b>of</b> 90 amateurs and 32 professionals. As well as the Bournemouth players, the company engaged the Royal Liverpool Philharmonic, City of Birmingham Symphony and Ulster orchestras for different venues. In the last season of the decade 32 performances were given in Cardiff and 61 elsewhere in the UK. In addition to the main company, WNO maintained two smaller groups: one, with orchestra, toured Welsh towns, the other, consisting of 12 singers with piano, toured 79, mostly small, towns in Wales and England. WNO instituted its own training scheme for young singers during the decade.|$|E
