25|$|On 2 July, {{the four}} foreign {{observers}} {{returned to the}} battlefield at 5am, in time to witness a meeting between Generals Lee, Longstreet, Hill, John Bell Hood and Henry Heth. Once more, Fremantle climbed his tree {{to see what was}} happening, this time in the company of Captain Scheibert. After touring the Confederate lines, Fremantle returned to that position at about 2pm on the advice of General Longstreet, but was frustrated that the attack did not take place until well after 4pm. For the first time, the Englishman heard the 'Rebel Yell', as well as a Confederate band playing polkas and waltzes <b>above</b> <b>the</b> <b>din</b> of battle. That evening, news reached the observers of the wounding of General Hood, as well as the death of General William Barksdale.|$|E
500|$|Two guardsmen, Miomandre and Tardivet, each {{separately}} {{attempted to}} face down {{the crowd and}} were overpowered. [...] The violence boiled over into savagery as Tardivet's head was shorn off and raised aloft on a pike. As battering and screaming filled the halls around her, the queen ran barefoot with her ladies to the king's bedchamber and spent several agonizing minutes banging on its locked door, unheard <b>above</b> <b>the</b> <b>din.</b> In a close brush with death, they barely escaped through the doorway in time.|$|E
500|$|The most {{influential}} {{of the contemporary}} reports came from Citizen Boullemer, and was published in over 1000 pamphlets later in the year. Boullemer claimed {{to be among the}} few surviving eyewitnesses: [...] "there arrived from all exits of the city, five to six thousand peasants, women and children, armed [...] guns, scythes, knives, shovels and pikes. [...] They shouted, running the streets: peace! [...] peace!" [...] Boullemer's account continues: they descended on Machecoul, confronted a detachment of the National guard that had come to enforce the levy. One hundred National Guardsmen and police defended the town against them. Louis-Charles-César Maupassant, a farmer, merchant and a deputy to the Convention, tried to harangue the attackers into quiescence, but could not be heard <b>above</b> <b>the</b> <b>din.</b> [...] Most of the Republican troops and officials scattered [...] before the threatening crowd. [...] According to Louis Mortimer-Ternaux, another eye-witness, only three officers and five or six gendarmes remained at their posts. [...] At that time, according to him, some national guardsmen who had tried to escape through an alley were ambushed by peasants, pursued, and finally brought down by the crowd {{at the feet of the}} deputy, Maupassant. [...] The crowd then pulled him off his horse and killed him with a stroke of a shovel.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Above</b> <b>the</b> <b>Dining</b> Room is <b>the</b> Drawing Room and, above that, Lady Churchill's Bedroom, {{described}} by Churchill as [...] "a magnificent aerial bower".|$|R
6000|$|<b>Above</b> <b>the</b> general <b>din</b> came <b>the</b> {{voice of}} La Tour d'Azyr, who had half-risen from his seat: [...] "Mountebank! This {{is not the}} theatre!" ...|$|R
6000|$|The mob came swaying back, and a rich voice swelled <b>above</b> all <b>the</b> <b>din,</b> 'Boys, boys, is it burning {{your friends}} you are? Then, {{for the first}} time, Mr. Kendal started, and muttered, 'foolish lad! is he here?' ...|$|R
2500|$|In 1932, Dr. Hauer's {{medicine}} show, which {{toured the}} southern Appalachian region, hired Acuff {{as one of}} its entertainers. The purpose of the entertainers was to draw a large crowd to whom Hauer could sell medicines (of suspect quality) for various ailments. While on the medicine show circuit, Acuff met the legendary Appalachian banjoist Clarence Ashley, from whom he learned [...] "The House of the Rising Sun" [...] and [...] "Greenback Dollar", both of which Acuff later recorded. As the medicine show lacked microphones, Acuff learned to sing loud enough to be heard <b>above</b> <b>the</b> <b>din,</b> a skill that would later help him stand out on early radio broadcasts.|$|E
2500|$|Some {{forms of}} the story are highly unlikely; the most {{widespread}} is that he shouted to Brooklyn, [...] "Damn the torpedoes! Go ahead!" [...] Men present at the battle doubted that any such verbal communication could be heard <b>above</b> <b>the</b> <b>din</b> of the guns. More likely, if it happened, is that {{he said to the}} captain of Hartford, [...] "Damn the torpedoes. Four bells, Captain Drayton." [...] Then he shouted to the commander of Metacomet, lashed to Hartfords side, [...] "Go ahead, Jouett, full speed." [...] The words have been altered in time to the more familiar, [...] "Damn the torpedoes, full speed ahead!" ...|$|E
2500|$|Gil Kaufamn of Addicted to Noise {{described}} the album as a [...] "surprisingly non-guitar rock mix of ambient noise, shifting trip-hop beats, grinding jungle rhythms and an ocean-size chunk of buzzing noise that, somehow, gels and rises <b>above</b> <b>the</b> <b>din</b> thanks to catchy hooks and killer song construction." [...] Metro Weekly characterized the album as [...] "a heavy mix of electronic pop and guitar rock with samples, electronica and trip-hop beats {{thrown into the}} mix." [...] Billboard noted that [...] "acting {{on the premise that}} more is more, foursome Garbage thrashes out power pop with enough skill and passion to rate among the cream of the alternative crop. First single 'Queer' is a modern rock success, and other cuts—especially 'Only Happy When It Rains', 'Stupid Girl', and 'Supervixen'—are capable of keeping interests high. Proof that success can come from the oddest combinations." ...|$|E
6000|$|Some one {{was singing}} the [...] "Carmagnole" [...] in drunken, {{discordant}} tones. Keys rattled, bolts were drawn; doors were being flung open. <b>The</b> noise increased. <b>Above</b> <b>the</b> general <b>din</b> he heard <b>the</b> detestable {{voice of the}} turnkey.|$|R
60|$|Outside {{the clamor}} increased. Shrill yells rent the air, long, rolling war-cries sounded <b>above</b> all <b>the</b> <b>din.</b> <b>The</b> {{measured}} stamp of moccasined feet, {{the rush of}} Indians past the cabin, the dull thud of hatchets struck hard into the trees--all attested to {{the excitement of the}} savages, and the imminence of terrible danger.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> President's <b>Dining</b> Room is {{a dining}} room located in the {{northwest}} corner of {{the second floor of the}} White House. It is located directly <b>above</b> <b>the</b> Family <b>Dining</b> Room on <b>the</b> State Floor and looks out upon the North Lawn. <b>The</b> <b>Dining</b> Room is adjacent to the Family Kitchen, a small kitchen designed for use by the First Family, and served by a dumbwaiter connected to the main kitchen on the ground floor.|$|R
2500|$|Suddenly, Batra {{realized}} {{that one of}} his men had been shot. Turning his face toward Subedar Raghunath Singh, who was sitting behind a nearby boulder, maintaining an iron grip on his AK-47, Batra shouted <b>above</b> <b>the</b> <b>din</b> of flying bullets: [...] "Aap aur main usko evacuate karenge," [...] (We wil evacuate him, you and I). With bullets flying around him, he pushed the JCO toward the safer side and taking his place instead, saying: [...] "You have a family and children to go back to, I'm not even married. Main sar ki taraf rahunga aur aap paanv uthayenge" [...] (I will take the head and you take his feet). Batra courageously exposed himself to enemy fire to drag the injured soldier to safety, and in the process was shot in the chest by an enemy sniper from very close range and a split-second later, by a splinter from an RPG which hit him in the head. Captain Batra collapsed next to the injured soldier, succumbing to the fatal wounds.|$|E
2500|$|Around {{the same}} time, {{a group of}} Vincent's staff {{officers}} who had come forward to watch the action let out a cheer. Their men took up the cheer, relieving their tension but depriving them of {{the element of surprise}} that was their primary advantage given the lopsided number of troops they faced. Instead of striking fear in their adversaries, the yells served to direct their attention to where the British were, helping the rousing troops to focus their attention and musket fire and making it nearly impossible for officers' orders to be heard <b>above</b> <b>the</b> <b>din.</b> Any hope of catching the Americans unaware and bayoneting them in their sleep was now lost and the British fixed their flints to their muskets and attacked. Lieutenant James Fitzgibbon and three sergeants of the Light Company of the 49th were able to keep their men from taking up the shout [...] "until a late stage of the affair, when firing on our side became general". Gradually, the American troops began to recover from the initial surprise, recover their poise and start firing at the attacking British, at times {{from as far away as}} [...] The American artillery also entered the fray after having previously been rendered useless due to the dampness settling into the powder.|$|E
2500|$|In his autobiography, {{written with}} help from ghostwriter Mickey Herskowitz, Rather wrote {{that he was in}} Dallas to return film from an {{interview}} that morning in Uvalde at the ranch of former Vice President John Nance Garner who actually celebrated his 95th (Rather erroneously called it his 98th) birthday on November 22. Although hired in August to set up a southern bureau for CBS in New Orleans, Rather had only recently moved from Dallas to New Orleans in November [...] and would not have been in Dallas except for the need to get film to Dallas CBS affiliate KRLD-TV (now KDFW) to feed to New York. Although he had no assigned reporting role in Dallas, Rather says he happened to be [...] "on {{the other side of the}} railroad tracks, beyond the triple underpass, thirty yards from a grassy knoll that would later figure in so many conspiracy theories." [...] His job was to fetch a film drop from a camera truck at that location and take it to the station for editing. He did not witness or hear the shooting, he said. He heard nothing of what may have caused the commotion until he reached KRLD, running all the way through Dealey Plaza, [...] "The moment I cleared the railroad tracks I saw a scene I will never forget. Some people were lying on the grass, some screaming, some running, some pointing. Policemen swarmed everywhere and distinctly <b>above</b> <b>the</b> <b>din,</b> I heard one shout, 'DON'T ANYBODY PANIC.' And of course, there was nothing but panic wherever you looked." ...|$|E
6000|$|He {{heard the}} flutter of many fans, the frou-frou of silk dresses, and <b>above</b> all <b>the</b> <b>din</b> and sound of dance music, he heard an inane laugh and an {{affected}} voice repeating the doggerel rhyme {{that was even}} now written on that dirty piece of paper which Robespierre had placed before him: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No!" [...] exclaimed Rebecca, [...] "they bear {{themselves}} right yeomanly--the Black Knight {{approaches the}} postern with his huge axe--the thundering blows which he deals, you may hear them <b>above</b> all <b>the</b> <b>din</b> and shouts of the battle--Stones and beams are hailed {{down on the}} bold champion--he regards them no more than if they were thistle-down or feathers!" ...|$|R
60|$|Now the {{two great}} fleets closed in a titanic {{struggle}} far <b>above</b> <b>the</b> fiendish <b>din</b> of battle in the gorgeous gardens of the therns. Slowly the two lines of Helium's battleships joined their ends, and then commenced the circling within {{the line of the}} enemy which is so marked a characteristic of Barsoomian naval warfare.|$|R
2500|$|Garbage was {{acclaimed}} {{by contemporary}} critics. In Entertainment Weekly, Steven Mirkin said the band's songwriting {{was just as}} exceptional as Vig's guitar and drum sounds, highlighting the [...] "menacing sexuality, sonic playfulness, inventive guitar treatments, and cool vocals by Shirley Manson". Gil Kaufman from Addicted to Noise found the record's sound [...] "akin to a Jackson Pollock painting, thick layers upon layers of sound that have been stripped down, torn apart, pasted together and then stripped again, until {{the result is a}} dizzying soundscape that reveals fresh nuances upon repeated listening". He added that the music's mix of ambience, rhythms, and noise [...] "gels and rises <b>above</b> <b>the</b> <b>din</b> thanks to catchy hooks and killer song construction." [...] Melody Maker hailed it as the closest to [...] "perfection as a pop/rock record" [...] as can be, while NME called it [...] "a reminder of how sweet angst can {{be in the hands of}} talented players". Garbage was voted the 19th best album of 1995 in the Pazz & Jop, an annual poll of American critics published by The Village Voice. The newspaper's Robert Christgau was somewhat less impressed by the album. He named [...] "Queer" [...] and [...] "Supervixen" [...] as its highlights while jokingly writing [...] "if Whale is Tricky without a dark side, Garbage is Whale without Tricky and depressed about it". Keith Harris wrote in The Rolling Stone Album Guide that the record's electronic guitar hooks and Manson's [...] "pop-star-as-one-night-stand" [...] persona were seductive but had a [...] "tawdry disposability".|$|E
60|$|Suddenly, <b>above</b> <b>the</b> <b>din,</b> Cyril {{heard the}} voice of Prince Rupert sound like a trumpet.|$|E
60|$|Inside, <b>above</b> <b>the</b> <b>din</b> and fray, We {{heard the}} loud musicians play The 'Treues Liebes Herz' of Strauss.|$|E
60|$|The heedless tumult of {{her song}} {{seemed to give}} courage to sounds and voices much fainter. Soon a lovelit rival in some distant thicket broke into song, and far and near their voices echoed <b>above</b> <b>the</b> elfin <b>din</b> of timbrel and fife and hunting-horn. I began to wish the moon away that dazzled my eyes, yet could not muffle my ears.|$|R
60|$|Through the hum {{of varied}} noises which filled her own house, she {{distinguished}} presently more strange, more ominous sounds that came from afar, like the thunders of Jove, and like them sounded weird and threatening in her ear; hoarse cries and shouts which seemed like peremptory commands, and groans that rose <b>above</b> <b>the</b> muffled <b>din</b> with calls of terror and of pain.|$|R
60|$|Following it was {{a mighty}} rush of flame as if the {{interior}} was a seething mass of fire; loud shouts of command rang out, and then came even <b>above</b> all <b>the</b> <b>din</b> <b>the</b> clatter of a horse's iron-shod hoofs as he dashed madly away in affright. Involuntarily Seth had followed with his eyes the flight of the shutter, and, unconscious of even having made a movement, he sprang toward Ninety-four as if {{in the time of}} danger that was his post of duty.|$|R
60|$|The Pesident wildly rang his bell, and his voice, quivering with excitement, {{was heard}} {{once or twice}} <b>above</b> <b>the</b> <b>din.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "Not {{without leaving}} behind {{him what he}} has {{deliberately}} stolen," [...] commented Endicott, raising his oily voice <b>above</b> <b>the</b> <b>din.</b>|$|E
60|$|Eustace {{lowered his}} foot and gazed at her meditatively, then at the odd-job man, then at the scullery-maid, whose voice rose high <b>above</b> <b>the</b> <b>din.</b>|$|E
60|$|Ever and anon {{a tongue}} of flame would lick {{up into the}} night towards that russet patch of sky, betraying the cause of it and proclaiming that incendiaries were at work. <b>Above</b> <b>the</b> ominous <b>din</b> that told of the {{business}} afoot there came now and again the crack of a musket, and dominating all other sounds was the sullen roar of the revolted peasants, the risen serfs, the rebellious vassals of the Siegneur de Bellecour.|$|R
60|$|The {{long blast}} of a trumpet was heard even <b>above</b> <b>the</b> {{tremendous}} <b>din.</b> In an instant the barricades were deserted, and the defenders {{rushed into the}} houses. The partition walls between these on the lower floors had already been knocked down, and without suffering from the heavy fire which the assailants opened, {{as soon as they}} gained the crest of the barricade, the defenders retreated along these covered ways until in rear of the second line of defence.|$|R
6000|$|Now {{he raises}} his clear loud voice <b>above</b> all <b>the</b> <b>din</b> of <b>the</b> town. It drowns the buzzing talk of many tongues and draws each man's mind from his own business; it rolls {{up and down the}} echoing street, and ascends to the hushed chamber of the sick, and penetrates {{downward}} to the cellar kitchen where the hot cook turns from the fire to listen. Who of all that address the public ear, whether in church or court-house or hall of state, has such an attentive audience as the town-crier! What saith the people's orator? ...|$|R
60|$|Even <b>above</b> <b>the</b> <b>din</b> {{caused by}} so vast a {{multitude}} a sharp metallic sound was presently heard {{like that of}} innumerable hammers striking on steel.|$|E
6000|$|... "This is madness, Macumazahn," [...] {{he shouted}} <b>above</b> <b>the</b> <b>din.</b> [...] "Are we to stop here and be stamped flat by {{a horde of}} water-pigs?" ...|$|E
60|$|Twenty rocks {{were dropped}} down together. Even <b>above</b> <b>the</b> <b>din</b> of {{shouting}} the crash as they fell below was heard, followed instantly by yells and cries.|$|E
60|$|Small {{parties of}} {{soldiers}} entered the houses. Shouts and yells {{could be heard}} even <b>above</b> <b>the</b> surrounding <b>din.</b> Men jumped from windows or ran {{out into the street}} only to be cut down by the troops there, and so each body of soldiers continued to advance until they met in the centre of the street, and then, after a few words between the officers, each party returned by the way it had come. They had done their work, and the street had been completely cleared of the plunderers.|$|R
60|$|In {{this fight}} Sarah had {{certainly}} {{the honor of}} first blood. She was a courageous woman, and was determined to do her best {{in defense of the}} house. As an appropriate weapon, she had placed the end of the spit in the fire, and at the moment of the attack it was white-hot. Seeing the shutter bend with the pressure of the Indians against it, she seized the spit, and plunged it through the loophole with all her force. A fearful yell followed, which rose even <b>above</b> <b>the</b> tremendous <b>din</b> around.|$|R
6000|$|... "Meanwhile the slayers stayed {{not their}} hands, and {{on every side}} spears flashed, and the fierce shout of triumph went up to heaven. There too on the wall stood Maiwa, a white garment {{streaming}} from her shoulders, an assegai in her hand, her breast heaving, her eyes flashing. <b>Above</b> all <b>the</b> <b>din</b> of battle I could catch the tones of her clear voice as she urged the soldiers on to victory. But victory was not yet. Wambe's soldiers gathered themselves together, and bore our men back by the sheer weight of numbers. They began to give, then once more they rallied, and the fight hung doubtfully.|$|R
