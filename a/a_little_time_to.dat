500|$|Tony Scott, {{a critic}} for Variety, thought the {{characters}} were [...] "amiable enough", but they needed [...] "sharper dialogue and fresher observations." [...] Scott {{did not think}} the carpool segment worked, but he liked the opening sequence in the bar. He also praised Lessac's direction, calling it [...] "inventive". Peter Weiniger from The Age was prepared to give the series a chance based on the episode, saying [...] "Like most American sitcoms, The Drew Carey Show {{has its share of}} snappy one-liners but it gives the impression of trying a little too hard. To be fair, this is the first of a series, and we have yet to see the characters develop. Even Seinfeld took <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> become essential viewing." ...|$|E
500|$|Sandra Gonzalez of Entertainment Weekly was {{generally}} positive {{on most of}} the songs featured in the episode. She gave the performance of [...] "Loser Like Me" [...] a [...] "B", and explained that [...] "This one took <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> grow on me. I liked it better on the show than when I heard it by itself, which is weird because it's exactly the same thing. Goes to show how much of a difference a good performance [...] makes." [...] Gonzalez gave the highest grade to the cover versions of [...] "Misery" [...] and [...] "Raise Your Glass", both performed by the Dalton Academy Warblers. In her review for [...] "Misery", she praised the performance, and gave it an [...] "A". She opined, [...] "I'm a sucker for a Warbler-ized pop song, especially when it makes Blaine dance and make his weird, animated faces. They're simply adorable, and these Warblers are simply amazing." [...] Gonzalez gave the performance of [...] "Raise Your Glass" [...] an [...] "A". The lowest grade given by Gonzalez was a [...] "D" [...] for Santana's performance of [...] "Trouty Mouth". She explained [...] "If we're taking this song as a joke, it gets a 'B−' because Santana sounded great. But [...] I think about how bad I felt for Sam watching his utter mortification." [...] "Candles" [...] {{was generally}} well received by Gonzalez. She gave the performance a [...] "B" [...] and went on to write [...] "It’s really hard for this pair {{to live up to the}} awesomeness of 'Baby, It's Cold Outside'. I'm sure they could one day, but this one fell a bit short for me musically. [...] In the context of the show, however, it was a great moment." ...|$|E
2500|$|As {{the novel}} became popular, the reviews became {{positive}}; Crawford Woods, also in The New York Times, wrote a positive review countering Lehmann-Haupt's negative review: {{the novel is}} [...] "a custom-crafted study of paranoia, a spew from the 1960s and — in all its hysteria, insolence, insult and rot — a desperate and important book, a wired nightmare, the funniest piece of American prose"; and [...] "this book is such a mind storm that we may need <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> {{know that it is}} also literature[...] [...] it unfolds a parable of the nineteen-sixties {{to those of us who}} lived in them in a mood — perhaps more melodramatic than astute — of social strife, surreal politics and the chemical feast." [...] About Thompson, Woods said he [...] "trusts the authority of his senses, and the clarity of a brain poised between brilliance and burnout".|$|E

2500|$|The ram {{air ducts}} {{at the front}} of the drooping, rounded nose {{squeezed}} frontal area away from the headlight, and this, along with the need for a narrow frontal area, necessitated a stacked headlight and high beam behind a single lens. Moreover, the need to reduce the extreme drag encountered at high speeds determined the Hayabusa's entire bulbous, and much-criticized, bodywork design. Koblenz remarked, [...] "non-traditional styling generates the main controversy of the Hayabusa." [...] When viewed through the eyes of those who judged its beauty on the basis of its functionality, or given <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> get used to it, the bike's looks did find admirers. The striking two-tone copper/silver paint scheme was similarly loved by some and hated by others, but was successful if the intent of an all-new, flagship product is to make a bold statement. So while it was called ugly by some in the press, those who aren't appalled by its bulbous silhouette... Styling reminiscent of a walleye pike." [...] this aerodynamic shape was key to the Hayabusa's ability to reach record-setting speeds.|$|E
