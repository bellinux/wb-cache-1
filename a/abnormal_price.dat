On average, post-SEO earnings announcements are met with a significantly negative <b>abnormal</b> stock <b>price</b> reaction. Although this negative reaction accounts for a disproportionately large portion of long-run post-SEO abnormal stock returns, on average, <b>abnormal</b> stock <b>price</b> reactions to post-SEO earnings announcements are reliably negative only within the smallest quartile of equity issuers. For small firms, therefore, these findings are broadly consistent with the hypothesis that firms issue equity when the market over-estimates the firm’s future earnings performance...|$|R
40|$|Purpose - Numerous {{studies suggest}} that {{announcements}} of capital offerings cause <b>abnormal</b> <b>price</b> reaction in stock markets. However, despite extensive research, relevant studies on the property sector are still relatively scarce, {{especially in the case}} of Hong Kong. The determinants of the post-offering price effects, which vary across industries and regions, are yet to be identified. This paper aims to examine the abnormal stock return phenomenon of Hong Kong property developers and construction companies surrounding the announcement and offer dates of capital issuances. Design/methodology/approach - It employs the event-study methodology and regression analysis to verify such effects. Findings - The major findings are: on equity offering announcements, there is a significant negative price reaction; the pre-offering debt/equity ratio of a firm is significantly associated with the level of <b>abnormal</b> <b>price</b> reactions; and on debt offerings there is, to the contrary, a modest increase in stock prices. Practical implications - This study has identified a set of determinants of the post-offering stock price effects. Originality/value - It can be concluded that there is evidence of <b>abnormal</b> <b>price</b> effects over the announcement and offer dates of capital issuances with unique characteristics of the property and construction sectors in Hong Kong.

The {{evidence suggests that}} the observed stock prices react within 90 minutes after the ad hoc disclosures. Trading volumes take even longer to adjust. We find no evidence for <b>abnormal</b> <b>price</b> reactions or abnormal trading volume before announcements. The bigger the company that announces an ad hoc disclosure, the less severe is the <b>abnormal</b> <b>price</b> effect following the announcement. The number of analysts is negatively correlated to the trading volume effect before the ad hoc disclosure.

40|$|We {{examine the}} turn-of-the-year effect (January effect) in UK listed {{securities}} {{and find that}} it is significant but not persistent through time. In contrast to the US studies, equities of all sizes are affected. Although important, we reject the hypothesis that seasonalities in insider trading are the main determinant of the turn-of-the-year effect. In addition, the tax-loss selling hypothesis, which is commonly {{thought to be a}} cause of the January effect in the US, is tested with the April year-end for UK investors. We find evidence of excess <b>abnormal</b> share <b>price</b> returns. However, this does not impact upon excess <b>abnormal</b> share <b>price</b> returns in January. Our results are important because they provide an insight into stock return seasonality in the UK and reject some widely held beliefs on this issue...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to examine the propensity, {{characteristics}} and performance of directors' trades. Consistent with prior research we show that on average, directors outperform the market. However, we also find that there exist a large number of trades which do not share these <b>abnormal</b> share <b>price</b> returns and consequently have little information content. This has important consequences for market participants who use director trading activity as a signal for their own trading strategies. Using different measures of directors' trades based on trade characteristics, we report that purchases by directors are more informative than sales. In addition, the number of directors trading within a twenty day window and the percentage of the directors' holding that is being traded are both important factors in the <b>abnormal</b> share <b>price</b> performance following the trade.

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{behavior}} of stock and option prices around block trades in stocks. The results indicate that for both uptick and downtick block trades the stock prices adjust within a fifteen minute period after the block trade. Moreover, for uptick blocks {{there is no evidence}} of any stock price reaction before the block trade. However, the adjustment of stock price for downtick blocks begins about fifteen minutes before the block trade. They also find that option price behavior differs considerably from stock price behavior. Specifically, the authors' results suggest that options exhibit <b>abnormal</b> <b>price</b> behavior starting thirty minutes before the block and ending one hour after the block. The pattern is more pronounced for downtick blocks and for put options. The authors interpret this <b>abnormal</b> <b>price</b> behavior of options before the block trade as consistent with intermarket frontrunning. Copyright 1992 by American Finance Association. ...|$|E

Using a unique product-level scanner data set of a national grocery chain, we find a pronounced and significant reduction in beef sales following the first discovered infection, which dissipates slowly {{over the next three}} months. Cattle futures show a comparable pattern of <b>abnormal</b> <b>price</b> drops to the scanner data.

40|$|The result {{shows that}} the stock prices {{recorded}} positive abnormal returns for both inclusion and exclusion on the announcement day. In general, price effects for inclusion in both periods are considerably smaller magnitude than those {{for changes in the}} S&P 500, and the Nikkei 500. The result also {{shows that the}} trading volume, on average, increase (decrease) for stocks added (deleted), on the announcement day. The temporary price effect for exclusion support price-pressure hypothesis in both periods. The price-pressure hypothesis also exists for inclusion in period 1995 - 2004. Inclusion in period 2000 - 2004 supports both the information hypothesis and the downward-sloping-demand-curve hypothesis. No evidence to support the liquidity hypothesis. In general, parametric test has better result than the non-parametric test for both <b>abnormal</b> <b>price</b> returns and abnormal trading volume measurement in this study. However, Generalized Sign Test, non-parametric test, in finding the cumulative average <b>abnormal</b> <b>price,</b> has better result than parametric test.

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{capital market}} reactions to international bank {{mergers and acquisitions}} in North America and Europe. We investigate combined <b>abnormal</b> share <b>price</b> patterns of targets, bidders, and their five respective closest peers upon the events of takeover an-nouncement and deal closing or cancellation. We apply this methodology to test whether capital markets believe in merger gains through market power exploitation. We therefore dis-tinguish five common M&A hypotheses – market power, merger wave, pre-emptive merger, economies of scale and scope, and financial distress – by relating characteristic and mutually exclusive <b>abnormal</b> share <b>price</b> patterns to each hypothesis. Based on these combined CAR patterns we find that investors {{seem to believe that}} the only chance for realizing gains from bank mergers is through the exploitation of market power of the post-merger combined enti-ty. Our findings hold for several robustness checks. By applying a multinomial logistic re-gression model, we show that our indication of market power effects significantly concurs with large relative target size, intra-industry M&A, and a strong increase in market concentra...|$|R

The average intraday price impact of repurchase trades is negative, since, because of execution rules, 60 % are seller-initiated.

We find evidence consistent with two hypotheses: repurchases provide price support, and the market learns that the shares are undervalued. Consistent with the latter, we find that repurchasing companies have superior timing. Share prices show abnormal losses (gains) before (after) the repurchase trades. We find no significant market reaction to the mandatory public disclosure of the trade details. Copyright 2006 The Authors Journal compilation (c) 2006 Blackwell Publishing Ltd. ...|$|E
