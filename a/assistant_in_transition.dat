40|$|Aims: Investigate {{the number}} and type of tasks performed, delayed or not {{completed}} by regulated and unregulated (assistant) nurses. Background: <b>Assistants</b> <b>in</b> Nursing change the work environment of the nurses with whom they work. As the number of <b>Assistants</b> <b>in</b> Nursing working on acute units grows, {{it is important to}} understand how their presence influences nursing care. Design: Descriptive analysis of survey data from 62 acute nursing units across three Australian states between 2008 – 2010. Methods: All staff providing nursing care to patients were asked to complete a survey that included demographics, the number of tasks delayed/incomplete and the completion of six specific tasks. Nonparametric tests compared <b>Assistants</b> <b>in</b> Nursing (n = 25) to regulated nurses (n = 1630), and regulated nurses on units with no <b>Assistants</b> <b>in</b> Nursing (n = 1356) to those on units with up to 5 % assistants (n = 76) and over 5 % assistants (n = 198). Results: More regulated nurses on units with zero, or up to 5 % <b>Assistants</b> <b>in</b> Nursing, completed tasks usually associated with assistants’ scope of practice, relative to those on units with over 5 % <b>Assistants</b> <b>in</b> Nursing. Statistically significant differences were found between the units in delays responding to the patient bell and in the planning of nursing care. Conclusion: This study suggests that <b>Assistants</b> <b>in</b> Nursing have an impact on the nature and timeliness of care provided in acute hospital units, that is relative to the proportion of staffing they comprise, to the effectiveness of integration and to the clarity of their scope of practice and associated delegation. Relevance to clinical practice: With increasing employment of <b>Assistants</b> <b>in</b> Nursing in acute hospital settings comes the requirement to optimise their use. This needs to include a well-articulated scope of practice, clear delegation of tasks and effective integration with the rest of the care team...|$|R

40|$|Objective: The study {{addressed}} {{one central}} aim. This {{was to explore}} the experience of <b>Assistants</b> <b>in</b> Nursing being exposed to Dementia Care Mapping coupled with reflection to improve older residents care in a residential aged care facility. Design and Setting: A qualitative exploratory design was employed to gain an in depth understanding of <b>Assistants</b> <b>in</b> Nursing experience of creating new care for older residents using Dementia Care Mapping and feedback.
