The aim {{of this study was to}} analyze the association between the smoking status of Korean adolescents’ parents and friends <b>and</b> their own <b>smoking</b> behavior. The study assessed a nationwide sample of 72, 060 middle and high students from the 10 th Korea Youth Risk Behavior Web-based Survey (2014). Descriptive analysis, chi-square tests, and multiple logistic regression analysis were used to probe the association between family <b>and</b> friend <b>smoking</b> status <b>and</b> adolescent <b>smoking</b> behavior. The current cigarette smoking rates were 13. 3 % of boys and 4. 1 % of girls. The corresponding rates for electronic cigarette smoking were 4. 1 % and 1. 5 %, respectively. Higher exposure to secondhand smoke, smoking by any family member, more friends <b>smoking,</b> <b>and</b> witnessed <b>smoking</b> at school were associated with current <b>smoking</b> <b>and</b> electronic <b>smoking.</b> The smoking status of family and friends was significantly related to adolescent smoking behavior.

40|$|Objective To {{analyze the}} {{relation}} between <b>smoking</b> <b>and</b> passive <b>smoking</b> with heart rate variability parameters in male adolescents.

RR intervals were obtained by a heart rate monitor, on supine position, for 10 minutes. After collecting the RR intervals, time (standard deviation of all RR intervals, root mean square of the squared differences between adjacent normal RR intervals {{and the percentage of}} adjacent intervals over 50 ms) and frequency domains (low and high frequency and sympathovagal balance) parameters of heart rate variability were obtained. Results No significant differences between smoker and nonsmoker adolescents were observed in heart rate variability parameters (p> 0. 05). Similarly, heart rate variability parameters did not show significant difference between exposed and not exposed to passive smoking (p> 0. 05).

A quantitative research method was employed. The samples included three hundred current smoker adolescents between the ages of 15 to 18. The data were collected by means of self-administered questionnaires and then analyzed by AMOS software. The direct structural model was employed to determine the path relationships between the individual factor of stress <b>and</b> cigarette <b>smoking</b> behavior. In addition, a multi-group analysis approach was applied to assess the moderating effect of self-efficacy on the relationship between stress <b>and</b> cigarette <b>smoking</b> behavior among adolescents. The results of testing the structural equation model revealed that there is a positive significant relationship between the individual factor of stress <b>and</b> cigarette <b>smoking</b> behavior.

40|$|Purpose: To {{report on}} the {{prevalence}} <b>and</b> correlates of <b>smoking</b> <b>and</b> sexual activity in a community sample of Hong Kong Chinese adolescents. Methods: Participants (N = 4116) aged 13 to 18 years were surveyed regarding <b>smoking</b> <b>and</b> physical heterosexual activity, relationships with family members, family involvement, social support, school performance and emotional adjustment. Data were analyzed using logistic regression analyses. Results: About 30 % of participants reported ever <b>smoking</b> <b>and</b> 3. 5 % reported sexual intercourse. Current smoking was correlated with age, school performance and quality of relationship with mother. Sexual intercourse was correlated with age, gender, family involvement <b>and</b> social support. <b>Smoking</b> <b>and</b> sexual activity were significantly correlated with each other. <b>Smoking</b> <b>and</b> increasing levels of heterosexual physical contact were negatively correlated with emotional adjustment, even after controlling for common predictors to health-endangering behaviors and emotional adjustment. Conclusions: <b>Smoking</b> <b>and</b> sexual activity among adolescents are far less common in Hong Kong than in the West and their presence in a Hong Kong adolescent should alert the health practitioner {{to the possibility of}} significant psychosocial stress and maladjustment. © Society for Adolescent Medicine, 2001. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
