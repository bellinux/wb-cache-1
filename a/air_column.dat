5|$|Extratropical {{cyclones}} form along linear {{bands of}} temperature/dewpoint gradient with significant vertical wind shear, {{and are thus}} classified as baroclinic cyclones. Initially, cyclogenesis, or low pressure formation, occurs along frontal zones near a favorable quadrant of a maximum in the upper level jetstream known as a jet streak. The favorable quadrants are usually at the right rear and left front quadrants, where divergence ensues. The divergence causes air to rush out {{from the top of}} the <b>air</b> <b>column.</b> As mass in the column is reduced, atmospheric pressure at surface level (the weight of the <b>air</b> <b>column)</b> is reduced. The lowered pressure strengthens the cyclone (a low pressure system). The lowered pressure acts to draw in air, creating convergence in the low-level wind field. Low-level convergence and upper-level divergence imply upward motion within the column, making cyclones tend to be cloudy. As the cyclone strengthens, the cold front sweeps towards the equator and moves around the back of the cyclone. Meanwhile, its associated warm front progresses more slowly, as the cooler air ahead of the system is denser, and therefore more difficult to dislodge. Later, the cyclones occlude as the poleward portion of the cold front overtakes a section of the warm front, forcing a tongue, or trowal, of warm air aloft. Eventually, the cyclone will become barotropically cold and begin to weaken.|$|E

25|$|The {{trombone}} is {{a musical}} instrument in the brass family. Like all brass instruments, sound is produced when the player's vibrating lips (embouchure) cause the <b>air</b> <b>column</b> inside the instrument to vibrate. Nearly all trombones have a telescoping slide mechanism that varies {{the length of the}} instrument to change the pitch. Many modern trombone models also utilize a rotary valve as a means to lower pitch of the instrument. Variants such as the valve trombone and superbone have three valves like those on the trumpet.|$|E
40|$|There {{are many}} resonanse {{phenomena}} in nature {{which are very}} familiar. They show the characteristic of waves. Thus the resonance phenomena in <b>air</b> <b>columns</b> and in stretched strings are often taught in generel physics courses. But we can not find any reason why resonance phenomena are happened for some proper lengthes of the <b>air</b> <b>columns</b> or the stretched strings in texbooks. Thus in order to answer this problem the wave motions in the tubes or in the strings are represented to be a superpoosition of all waves reflected at both ends. Equations for the <b>air</b> <b>columns</b> of 5 different bondary conditions and the stretched strings are obtained which lead the standing waves having the maximum amplitudes for the proper lengthes as resonance...|$|R
40|$|The spatial {{organization}} of deep moist convection in radiative–convective equilibrium over a constant sea surface temperature is studied. A 100 -day simulation is performed with a three-dimensional cloud-resolving model over a (576 km) 2 domain with no ambient rotation and no mean wind. The convection self-aggregates within 10 days into quasi-stationary mesoscale patches of dry, subsiding and moist, rainy <b>air</b> <b>columns.</b> The patches ultimately merge {{into a single}} intensely convecting moist patch surrounded by a broad region of very dry subsiding air. The self-aggregation is analyzed as an instability of a horizontally homogeneous convecting atmosphere driven by convection–water vapor–radiation feedbacks that systematically dry the drier <b>air</b> <b>columns</b> and moisten the moister <b>air</b> <b>columns.</b> Column-integrated heat, water, and moist static energy budgets over (72 km) 2 horizontal blocks show that this instability is primarily initiated by the reduced radiative cooling of <b>air</b> <b>columns</b> {{in which there is}} extensive anvil cirrus, augmented by enhanced surface latent and sensible heat fluxes under convectively active regions due to storm-induced gustiness. Mesoscale circulations intensify the later stages of self-aggregation by fluxing moist static energy from the dry to the moist regions. A simple mathematical model of the initial phase of self-aggregation is proposed based on the simulations...|$|R
25|$|In summary, the balanced-flow speeds apply well to <b>air</b> <b>columns</b> {{that can}} be {{regarded}} as homogeneous (constant density, no vertical motion) or, at most, stably stratified (non-constant density, yet no vertical motion).|$|R
25|$|A {{tuning fork}} {{can be held}} {{near the mouth of}} a long pipe which is dipping into a barrel of water. In this system it is the case that the pipe can be brought to {{resonance}} if the length of the <b>air</b> <b>column</b> in the pipe is equal to (1 + 2n)λ/4 where n is an integer. As the antinodal point for the pipe at the open end is slightly outside the mouth of the pipe it is best to find two or more points of resonance and then measure half a wavelength between these.|$|E
25|$|The 'slide', {{the most}} {{distinctive}} {{feature of the}} trombone (cf. valve trombone), allows the player to extend {{the length of the}} <b>air</b> <b>column,</b> lowering the pitch. To prevent friction from slowing the action of the slide, additional sleeves were developed during the Renaissance, and these stockings were soldered onto the ends of the inner slide tubes. Nowadays, the stockings are incorporated into the manufacturing process of the inner slide tubes and represent a fractional widening of the tube to accommodate the necessary method of alleviating friction. This part of the slide must be lubricated frequently. Additional tubing connects the slide to the bell of the instrument through a neckpipe, and bell or back bow (U-bend). The joint connecting the slide and bell sections is furnished with a ferrule to secure the connection of the two parts of the instrument, though older models from the early 20th century and before were usually equipped with friction joints and no ancillary mechanism to tighten the joint.|$|E
25|$|Maddieson {{and colleagues}} also {{confirm that the}} ejective fricatives in Tlingit are in fact true ejectives. This is counter to the widely held {{assumption}} that ejective fricatives are not actually phonetically ejective, but are instead produced as a sequence of fricative and glottal stop. In Tlingit, at least, the articulation of ejective fricatives does include complete closure of the glottis before frication begins, and the larynx is raised {{in the same manner}} as with ejective stops. Characteristically, the ejective fricatives in Tlingit feature a much smaller aperture for frication than what is found in ordinary fricatives. This articulation provides increased resistance to counter the continual loss of dynamic airstream pressure. In addition, ejective fricatives appear to include tightening of the pharyngeal muscles which reduces the diameter of the <b>air</b> <b>column</b> and thus further increases pressure. This pharyngeal constriction is not true pharyngealization, however, since the diameter is still greater than that found in pharyngealized consonants in other languages.|$|E

25|$|Even if <b>air</b> <b>columns</b> are {{homogeneous}} with height, {{the density}} of each column can change from location to location, firstly since air masses have different temperatures and moisture content depending on their origin; and then since air masses modify their properties as they flow over Earth’s surface.|$|R

500|$|Most modern {{clarinets}} have [...] "undercut" [...] tone {{holes that}} improve intonation and sound. Undercutting means chamfering {{the bottom edge}} of tone holes inside the bore. Acoustically, this makes the tone hole function {{as if it were}} larger, but its main function is to allow the <b>air</b> <b>column</b> to follow the curve up through the tone hole (surface tension) instead of [...] "blowing past" [...] it under the increasingly directional frequencies of the upper registers.|$|E
500|$|Covering or {{uncovering}} the tone holes varies {{the length of}} the pipe, changing the resonant frequencies of the enclosed <b>air</b> <b>column</b> and hence the pitch. A clarinetist moves between the chalumeau and clarion registers through use of the register key; clarinetists call the change from chalumeau register to clarion register [...] "the break". The open register key stops the fundamental frequency from being reinforced, and the reed is forced to vibrate at three times the speed it was originally. This produces a note a twelfth above the original note. Most instruments overblow at two times the speed of the fundamental frequency (the octave), but as the clarinet acts as a closed pipe system, the reed cannot vibrate at twice its original speed because it would be creating a 'puff' of air at the time the previous 'puff' is returning as a rarefaction. This means it cannot be reinforced and so would die away. The chalumeau register plays fundamentals, whereas the clarion register, aided by the register key, plays third harmonics (a perfect twelfth higher than the fundamentals). The first several notes of the altissimo range, aided by the register key and venting with the first left-hand hole, play fifth harmonics (a major seventeenth, a perfect twelfth plus a major sixth, above the fundamentals). The clarinet is therefore said to overblow at the twelfth and, when moving to the altissimo register, seventeenth. By contrast, nearly all other woodwind instruments overblow at the octave or (like the ocarina and tonette) do not overblow at all. A clarinet must have holes and keys for nineteen notes, a chromatic octave and a half from bottom E to B, in its lowest register to play the chromatic scale. This overblowing behavior explains the clarinet's great range and complex fingering system. The fifth and seventh harmonics are also available, sounding a further sixth and fourth (a flat, diminished fifth) higher respectively; these are the notes of the altissimo register. This is also why the inner [...] "waist" [...] measurement is so critical to these harmonic frequencies.|$|E
2500|$|The {{detachable}} cup-shaped mouthpiece {{is similar}} to that of the baritone horn and closely related to that of the trumpet. It has the venturi: a small constriction of the <b>air</b> <b>column</b> that adds resistance greatly affecting the tone of the instrument, and is inserted into the mouthpiece receiver in the slide section. [...] The slide section consists of a leadpipe, the inner and outer slide tubes, and the bracing, or stays. Modern stays are soldered, while sackbuts (medieval precursors to trombones) were made with loose, unsoldered stays (this remained the pattern for German trombones until the mid-20th century).|$|E

2500|$|Valves {{are used}} to change the length of tubing of a brass {{instrument}} allowing the player to reach the notes of various harmonic series. Each valve pressed diverts the air stream through additional tubing, individually or {{in conjunction with other}} valves. This lengthens the vibrating <b>air</b> <b>column</b> thus lowering the fundamental tone and associated harmonic series produced by the instrument. Designs exist, although rare, in which this behaviour is reversed, i.e., pressing a valve removes a length of tubing rather than adding one. [...] One modern example of such an ascending valve is the Yamaha YSL-350C trombone, in which the extra valve tubing is normally engaged to pitch the instrument in , and pressing the thumb lever removes a whole step to pitch the instrument in C. [...] Valves require regular lubrication.|$|E
