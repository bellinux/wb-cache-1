In 1946, Clementine Paddleford, a food writer for the New York Herald Tribune, wrote that “pretty girls” served popovers “unendingly,” dispensing one thousand daily at the Manhattan Candlelight. Paddleford described the restaurant’s salad bar as a special feature and said dinners were “simple, plain-American – good!” Beef, lamb, and calf’s liver were available “plain roasted <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> at home” or “plain broiled” with “no lathering of strange sauces,” Paddleford said, adding that by this time Murphy was serving a half million diners annually at her two locations.|$|E
500|$|Reviews of Lansbury's {{performance}} were overwhelmingly positive. In The New York Times, Stanley Kauffmann wrote: [...] "Miss Lansbury is a singing-dancing actress, not {{a singer}} or dancer who also acts...

[...] While Henn {{served as the}} supervising {{animator}} of Simba as a cub, credited as Young Simba, Aquino was placed in charge of animating the character as he appears as an adult. [...] The Lion King was Disney's first animated feature film to feature absolutely no humans since Robin Hood (1973). [...] According to Aquino, animating four-legged creatures is difficult because the artists {{are faced with the}} task of drawing [...] "twice as many legs ... <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> with human characters" [...] and must also attribute to them both human and animal-like qualities. [...] For assistance, Aquino drew influence from previous animated films that feature four-legged creatures as their main characters, citing Bambi, Lady and the Tramp (1955) and The Jungle Book (1967) as his main sources of inspiration.|$|E

Abra covering up that he was operating on his arms-dealer father. Maddy hiding the fact she killed her junkie sister's daughter.

500|$|Riegels {{sent letters}} to athletes who made similar mistakes. For example, Riegels {{sent a letter}} to Paramount High School's Jan Bandringa in 1957, who had intercepted a pass only to run it 55 yards into his own end zone, {{resulting}} in a safety for Centennial High, who won the game 9–7. Riegels wrote in the letter: [...] "For many years I've had to go along and laugh whenever my wrong-way run was brought up, even though I've grown tired listening and reading about it. But it certainly wasn't the most serious thing in the world. I regretted doing it, even <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>do,</b> but you'll get over it." [...] In addition, during an NFL game in 1964 between the Minnesota Vikings and San Francisco 49ers, Minnesota defensive end Jim Marshall ran a recovered fumble 66 yards into his own end zone (resulting in a safety, but the Vikings won 27–22). Riegels reportedly later sent Marshall a letter reading [...] "Welcome to the club".|$|E
500|$|Holby City premiered on 12 January 1999 on BBC One. Fourteen {{series of}} the show have since aired, and a fifteenth began airing on 16 October 2012. The show's first series ran for nine episodes. In June 2000, then Director-General of the BBC Greg Dyke pledged extra funding for BBC One, some of which was used for extra episodes of Holby City. The second and third series ran for 16 and 30 episodes respectively, with new episodes then airing {{on a weekly basis}} from the fourth series onwards. Series four to nine and eleven all ran for 52 episodes, while series ten ran for 53 episodes, {{including}} the stand-alone finale episode [...] "Mad World", set outside the hospital. All series from then on continued to consist of 52 episodes, with exception to the twelfth series, which consisted of 55 episodes in total. Young explained of the increase in series length: [...] "Longer runs allow you to develop really strong storylines for the regular characters. As long <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> volume with passion, it'll work." [...] The series reached its 500th episode on 13 April 2010.|$|E

[...] , commenting on the change of mood in the final section, writes, [...] "The sense of relief after the stifling pathos of the opening sections is palpable ... After so much pathos, the final coda led by the sopranos releases the pent-up energy in an explosion of joy." [...] comments, [...] "The words, to the end of this section, are based on Isaiah 58:7-8 ... It brings Jesus’ words to mind, ‘Inasmuch <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> it unto them, you do it unto me’ and his denunciation of the careless rich. Isaiah continues, ‘Then shall thy light break forth as the morning and thy healing shall spring forth speedily; and thy righteousness shall go before thee.’ Bach sets the paraphrase of these last words to a glorious fugue, with two expositions, and so brings to an end one of his finest choruses and one that is worthy indeed of the inspired words of Isaiah.” [...] also expresses his admiration for Bach's setting: [...] "The chorus of the first movement, set to two beautiful verses of Isaiah, brings out the meaning of that text in the Sermon on the Mount, 'Blessed [...] are the merciful, for they shall obtain mercy,' and the cantata ...|$|E
500|$|Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic gave a mixed {{review of}} Most Wanted, stating that [...] "hardcore fans will be hard-pressed {{for a reason}} to add this to their collection" [...] and that the new songs—"Wake Up", [...] "Beat of My Heart" [...] and [...] "Break My Heart"—"sound a bit like leftovers". Although he wrote that Most Wanted [...] "isn't a terrible album by any means, it's not {{particularly}} a good one, since Duff's two pop albums [...] have distinctive personalities that don't necessarily mesh together , and are both more fun than this." [...] Bill Lamb of About.com noted that the three new songs [...] "seem to be marking time instead of finding a new direction" [...] but said that [...] " [...] remaining bulk of this collection is strong." [...] Anthony Miccio, from the Baltimore City Paper, wrote that the album [...] "doesn't signify the closure of a brief career" [...] but is [...] "meant to satisfy an audience that won't be offended by the opportunity to buy their favorite songs again and again." [...] He noted that Duff's voice was not strong enough and stated that the [...] "rock tracks are surprisingly sluggish." [...] Talia Kraines of BBC Music commented that [...] "... there isn't enough here to warrant a purchase if you're already the owner of her back catalogue. But if you're after your first taste of Duff-flavoured pop to listen to in the background <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> your homework, then this album can do no harm." ...|$|E
500|$|Man on the Moon: The End of Day {{received}} generally positive {{reviews from}} critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream publications, the album received an average score of 71, based on 15 reviews. The Boston Globe praised the experimental {{quality of the}} album: [...] "It's spacey, adventurous, and ridiculously intriguing if only because it's so different". Complimenting Cudi's [...] "introspective persona, ear for melody, and eclectic taste in beats," [...] Entertainment Weekly music reviewer Simon Vozick-Levinson called him [...] "a hyped upstart who really does represent a promising new phase in the genre's evolution." [...] David Jeffries of AllMusic called it [...] "a soul searcher [...] may require more patience than your everyday debut", but [...] "perfects the futuristic bleak-beat hip-hop Kanye purposed a year earlier, and rewards the listener with every tripped-out return." [...] Greg Kot, writing in the Chicago Tribune, believed that the album {{had the potential to}} turn heads as well as [...] "bum-rush the charts." [...] Slant Magazines Paul Schrodt wrote that the album attempts to be [...] "both a bigger pop platform and indie credibility", and felt that Cudi's verses [...] "are too good to ignore" [...] so long <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> not take them too seriously. Ann Power of the Los Angeles Times called Man on the Moon a [...] "standout release" [...] in spite of [...] "Cudi's voice". Billboard magazine's Michael Menachem said that the album is [...] "anything but a traditional hip-hop recording" [...] and that Cudi's [...] "delivery is confident in a poetic and artful way". David Bevan of The A.V. Club said that, despite its filler, Cudi's [...] "thick layer of open, intense self-loathing is a clever way of unifying Man On The Moon as pure mood piece, a stream-of-consciousness pop voyage that’s more Phil Collins than rap." ...|$|E

500|$|Either/Or portrays two life views. Each life view {{is written}} and {{represented}} by a fictional pseudonymous author, with the prose of the work reflecting and depending on the life view being discussed. For example, the aesthetic life view is written in short essay form, with poetic imagery and allusions, discussing aesthetic topics such as music, seduction, drama, and beauty. The ethical life view is written as two long letters, with a more argumentative and restrained prose, discussing moral responsibility, critical reflection, and marriage. The views of the book are not neatly summarized, but are expressed as lived experiences embodied by the pseudonymous authors. The book's central concern is the primal question asked by Aristotle, [...] "How should we live?" [...] His book was certainly informed by Epictetus; [...] "Consider first, man, what the matter is, and what your own nature is able to bear. If you would be a wrestler, consider your shoulders, your back, your thighs; for different persons are made for different things. Do {{you think that you}} can act <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> and be a philosopher, that you can eat, drink, be angry, be discontented, as you are now? You must watch, you must labor, you must get the better of certain appetites, must quit your acquaintances, be despised by your servant, be laughed at by those you meet; come off worse than others in everything—in offices, in honors, before tribunals. When you have fully considered all these things, approach, if you please—that is, if, by parting with them, you have a mind to purchase serenity, freedom, and tranquillity. If not, do not come hither; do not, like children, be now a philosopher, then a publican, then an orator, and then one of Caesar’s officers. These things are not consistent. You must be one man, either good or bad. You must cultivate either your own reason or else externals; apply yourself either to things within or without you—that is, be either a philosopher or one of the mob."
