40|$|AbstractBackground: The novel focal {{adhesion}} protein actopaxin includes tandem unconventional calponin homology (CH) domains and a less well-conserved N-terminal stretch. Dominant-negative {{studies have}} implicated actopaxin in focal adhesion formation. Results: PAT- 6 /actopaxin, the sole actopaxin homolog in C. elegans, {{is located in}} body wall muscle attachments that are in vivo homologs of focal adhesions. We show using pat- 6 protein null alleles that PAT- 6 /actopaxin has critical nonredundant roles during attachment maturation. It is required to recruit UNC- 89 and myofilaments to newly forming attachments, and also to reposition the attachments so that they form the highly ordered array of dense body and M line attachments that are characteristic of mature muscle cells. PAT- 6 /actopaxin is not required for the deposition of UNC- 52 /perlecan in the basal lamina, nor for the initiation of <b>attachment</b> <b>assembly,</b> including the clustering of integrin into foci and the recruitment of attachment proteins PAT- 4 /ILK, UNC- 112, and DEB- 1 /vinculin from the cytosol. PAT- 6 /actopaxin, PAT- 4 /ILK, and UNC- 112 are each required for the same steps during <b>attachment</b> <b>assembly</b> in vivo, consistent {{with the notion that}} they work together in multiprotein complex. Supporting this idea, PAT- 4 /ILK can simultaneously bind to PAT- 6 /actopaxin and UNC- 112, forming a ternary complex, in yeast three-hybrid assays. Finally, we show that both calponin homology domains are required for PAT- 6 /actopaxin's critical functions during <b>attachment</b> <b>assembly</b> in vivo. Conclusions: We show directly by loss-of-function genetics that PAT- 6 /actopaxin plays essential roles during the maturation of integrin-mediated muscle attachments in vivo...|$|E

However, efficient production of HPV 16 capsids in mammalian cells has been difficult, possibly because the HPV genome contains negative regulatory elements. To circumvent these problems, we cloned the HPV 16 L 1 and L 2 genes from a healthy HPV 16 -infected woman into a Semliki Forest virus based expression vector (P. Liljeström and H. Garoff,Biotechnology 9, 1356 – 1361, 1991). Recombinant HPV 16 L 1 - or L 2 -producing Semliki Forest virus was generated and used for infection of mammalian cells. The HPV 16 L 1 and L 2 proteins were efficiently expressed and the majority of the L 1 protein self assembled into virus-like particles (VLPs). Coexpression of L 1 and L 2 resulted in incorporation of L 2 into the VLPs. The particles had a density of ∼ 1. 3 g/ml as determined by density gradient centrifugation. Transmission electron microscopy revealed that the particles had a morphology similar to native virions.

Centromere identity in humans is epigenetically determined, with no DNA sequence either necessary or sufficient. A prime candidate for the epigenetic mark is assembly into centromeric chromatin of centromere protein A (CENP-A), a histone H 3 variant found only at functional centromeres. A new covalent fluorescent pulse-chase labeling approach using SNAP tagging has now been developed and is used to demonstrate that CENP-A bound to a mature centromere is quantitatively and equally partitioned to sister centromeres generated during S phase, thereby remaining stably associated through multiple cell divisions. Loading of nascent CENP-A on the megabase domains of replicated centromere DNA is shown to require passage through mitosis but not microtubule <b>attachment.</b> Very surprisingly, <b>assembly</b> and stabilization of new CENP-A–containing nucleosomes is restricted exclusively to the subsequent G 1 phase, demonstrating direct coupling between progression through mitosis and assembly/maturation {{of the next generation}} of centromeres...|$|R

40|$|Humans express {{three major}} {{splicing}} isoforms of LAP 2, a lamin- and chromatin-binding nuclear protein. LAP 2 β and γ are integral membrane proteins, whereas α is intranuclear. When truncated recombinant human LAP 2 β proteins {{were added to}} cell-free Xenopus laevis nuclear assembly reactions at high concentrations, a domain common to all LAP 2 isoforms (residues 1 – 187) inhibited membrane binding to chromatin, whereas the chromatin- and lamin-binding region (residues 1 – 408) inhibited chromatin expansion. At lower concentrations of the common domain, membranes attached to chromatin with a unique scalloped morphology, but these nuclei neither accumulated lamins nor replicated. At lower concentrations of the chromatin- and lamin-binding region, nuclear envelopes and lamins assembled, but nuclei failed to enlarge and replicated on average 2. 5 -fold better than controls. This enhancement was not due to rereplication, as shown by density substitution experiments, suggesting the hypothesis that LAP 2 β is a downstream effector of lamina assembly in promoting replication competence.

40|$|Glycoprotein B (gB) homologs are conserved {{throughout}} the family Herpesviridae {{and appear to}} serve essential, universal functions, as well as specific functions unique to a particular herpesvirus. Genetic analysis is a powerful tool to analyze protein function, and while it has been possible to generate virus mutants, complementation of essential virus knockouts has been problematic. Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) gB (UL 55) plays {{an essential role in}} the replication cycle of the virus. To define the function(s) of gB in HCMV infection, the BAC system was used to generate a recombinant virus in which the UL 55 gene was replaced with galK (pAD/CreΔUL 55). UL 55 deletions in the viral genome have been made before, demonstrating that UL 55 is an essential gene. However, without being able to successfully complement the genetic defect, a phenotypic analysis of the mutant virus was impossible. We generated fibroblasts expressing HCMV gB that complement pAD/CreΔUL 55 and produce infectious virions lacking the UL 55 gene but containing wild-type gB on the virion surface (ΔUL 55 -gB HCMV). This is the first successful complementation of an HCMV mutant with a glycoprotein deleted. To characterize ΔUL 55 infection in the absence of gB, noncomplementing cells were infected with ΔUL 55 -gB virus. All stages of gene expression were detected, and significant amounts of DNase-resistant viral DNA genomes, representing whole intact virions, were released into the infected cell supernatant. Gradient purification of these virions revealed they lacked gB but contained other viral structural proteins. The gB-null virions were able to attach to the cell surface similarly to wild-type gB-containing virions but were defective in virus entry and cell-to-cell spread. Glycoprotein B-null virions do, however, contain infectious DNA, as IE gene expression can be detected in fibroblasts following treatment of attached gB-null virions with a membrane fusion agent, polyethylene glycol. Taken together, our results indicate that gB is required for virus entry and cell-to-cell spread of the virus. However, HCMV gB is not absolutely required for virus <b>attachment</b> or <b>assembly</b> and egress from infected cells...|$|R

40|$|In oocytes, where centrosomes are absent, the {{chromosomes}} {{direct the}} assembly of a bipolar spindle. Interactions between chromosomes and microtubules are essential for both spindle formation and chromosome segregation, but the nature and function of these interactions is not clear. We have examined oocytes lacking two kinetochore proteins, NDC 80 and SPC 105 R, and a centromere-associated motor protein, CENP-E, to characterize the impact of kinetochore-microtubule <b>attachments</b> on spindle <b>assembly</b> and chromosome segregation in Drosophila oocytes. We found that the initiation of spindle assembly results from chromosome-microtubule interactions that are kinetochore-independent. Stabilization of the spindle, however, depends on both central spindle and kinetochore components. This stabilization coincides with changes in kinetochore-microtubule attachments and bi-orientation of homologs. We propose that the bi-orientation process begins with the kinetochores moving laterally along central spindle microtubules towards their minus ends. This movement depends on SPC 105 R, can occur {{in the absence of}} NDC 80, and is antagonized by plus-end directed forces from the CENP-E motor. End-on kinetochore-microtubule attachments that depend on NDC 80 are required to stabilize bi-orientation of homologs. A surprising finding was that SPC 105 R but not NDC 80 is required for co-orientation of sister centromeres at meiosis I. Together, these results demonstrate that, in oocytes, kinetochore-dependent and -independent chromosome-microtubule attachments work together to promote the accurate segregation of chromosomes...|$|R
40|$|Aurora B kinase (AURKB) is the {{catalytic}} subunit of the chromosomal passenger complex (CPC), {{an essential}} regulator of chromosome segregation. In mitosis, the CPC {{is required to}} regulate kinetochore microtubule (K-MT) <b>attachments,</b> the spindle <b>assembly</b> checkpoint, and cytokinesis. Germ cells express an AURKB homolog, AURKC, which can also function in the CPC. Separation of AURKB and AURKC function during meiosis in oocytes by conventional approaches has not been successful. Therefore, the meiotic function of AURKC is still not fully understood. Here, we describe an ATP-binding-pocket-AURKC mutant, that when expressed in mouse oocytes specifically perturbs AURKC-CPC and not AURKB-CPC function. Using this mutant we show {{for the first time}} that AURKC has functions that do not overlap with AURKB. These functions include regulating localized CPC activity and regulating chromosome alignment and K-MT attachments at metaphase of meiosis I (Met I). We find that AURKC-CPC is not the sole CPC complex that regulates the spindle assembly checkpoint in meiosis, and as a result most AURKC-perturbed oocytes arrest at Met I. A small subset of oocytes do proceed through cytokinesis normally, suggesting that AURKC-CPC is not the sole CPC complex during telophase I. But, the resulting eggs are aneuploid, indicating that AURKC is a critical regulator of meiotic chromosome segregation in female gametes. Taken together, these data suggest that mammalian oocytes contain AURKC to efficiently execute meiosis I and ensure high-quality eggs necessary for sexual reproduction...|$|R
40|$|Cell <b>attachment</b> and the <b>assembly</b> of cytoskeletal and {{signaling}} complexes downstream of integrins {{are intimately}} linked and coordinated. Although many intracellular proteins have {{been implicated in}} these processes, a new paradigm is emerging from biochemical and genetic studies that implicates integrin-linked kinase (ILK) and its interacting proteins, such as CH-ILKBP (α-parvin), paxillin, and PINCH in coupling integrins to the actin cytoskeleton and signaling complexes. Genetic studies in Drosophila, Caenorhabditis elegans, and mice point to an essential role of ILK as an adaptor protein in mediating integrin-dependent cell attachment and cytoskeletal organization. Here we demonstrate, using several different approaches, that inhibiting ILK kinase activity, or expression, results in the inhibition of cell attachment, cell migration, F-actin organization, and the specific cytoskeletal localization of CH-ILKBP and paxillin in human cells. We also demonstrate that the kinase activity of ILK is elevated in the cytoskeletal fraction and that the interaction of CH-ILKBP with ILK within the cytoskeleton stimulates ILK activity and downstream signaling to PKB/Akt and GSK- 3. Interestingly, the interaction of CH-ILKBP with ILK is regulated by the Pi 3 kinase pathway, because inhibition of Pi 3 kinase activity by pharmacological inhibitors, or by the tumor suppressor PTEN, inhibits this interaction as well as cell attachment and signaling. These data demonstrate that the kinase and adaptor properties of ILK function together, in a Pi 3 kinase–dependent manner, to regulate integrin-mediated cell attachment and signal transduction...|$|R

To {{elucidate the}} post-translational events required for their assembly, acetate-requiring mutants of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii that have combined deficiencies in both plastid-encoded cytochrome f and nucleus-encoded cytochrome c 6 have been identified and analyzed. For strains ct 34 and ct 59, where the phenotype displays uniparental inheritance, the mutations were localized to the chloroplast ccsA gene, which was shown previously to be required for heme attachment to chloroplast apocytochromes. The mutations in another eight strains were localized to the nuclear genome. Complementation tests of these strains plus three previously identified strains of the same phenotype (ac 206, F 18, and F 2 D 8) indicate that the 11 ccs strains define four nuclear loci, CCS 1 -CCS 4. We conclude that {{the products of the}} CCS 1 -CCS 4 loci are not required for translocation or processing of the preproteins but, like CcsA, they are required for the heme <b>attachment</b> step during <b>assembly</b> of both holocytochrome f and holocytochrome c 6.

40|$|AbstractBackground: The {{kinetochore}} <b>attachment</b> (spindle <b>assembly)</b> checkpoint arrests {{cells in}} metaphase to prevent exit from mitosis {{until all the}} chromosomes are aligned properly at the metaphase plate. The checkpoint operates by preventing activation of the anaphase-promoting complex (APC), which triggers anaphase by degrading mitotic cyclins and other proteins. This checkpoint is active during normal mitosis and upon experimental disruption of the mitotic spindle. In yeast, the serine/threonine protein kinase Bub 1 and the WD-repeat protein Bub 3 are elements of a signal transduction cascade that regulates the kinetochore attachment checkpoint. In mammalian cells, activated MAPK is present on kinetochores during mitosis and activity is upregulated by the spindle assembly checkpoint. In vertebrate unfertilized eggs, a special form of meiotic metaphase arrest by cytostatic factor (CSF) is mediated by MAPK activation of the protein kinase p 90 Rsk, which leads to inhibition of the APC. However, {{it is not known}} whether CSF-dependent metaphase arrest caused by p 90 Rsk involves components of the spindle assembly checkpoint. Results: xBub 1 is present in resting oocytes and its protein level increases slightly during oocyte maturation and early embryogenesis. In Xenopus oocytes, Bub 1 is localized to kinetochores during both meiosis I and meiosis II, and the electrophoretic mobility of Bub 1 upon SDS-PAGE decreases during meiosis I, reflecting phosphorylation and activation of the enzyme. The activation of Bub 1 can be induced in interphase egg extracts by selective stimulation of the MAPK pathway by c-Mos, a MAPKKK. In oocytes treated with the MEK 1 inhibitor U 0126, the MAPK pathway does not become activated, and Bub 1 remains in its low-activity, unshifted form. Injection of a constitutively active target of MAPK, the protein kinase p 90 Rsk, restores the activation of Bub 1 in the presence of U 0126. Moreover, purified p 90 Rsk phosphorylates Bub 1 in vitro and increases its protein kinase activity. Conclusions: Bub 1, an upstream component of the kinetochore attachment checkpoint, is activated during meiosis in Xenopus in a MAPK-dependent manner. Moreover, a single substrate of MAPK, p 90 Rsk, is sufficient to activate Bub 1 in vitro and in vivo. These results indicate that in vertebrate eggs, kinetochore attachment/spindle assembly checkpoint proteins, including Bub 1, are downstream of p 90 Rsk and may be effectors of APC inhibition and CSF-dependent metaphase arrest by p 90 Rsk...|$|R
40|$|A {{chimeric}} Pestivirus {{was constructed}} using an infectious cDNA clone of bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV) [J. Virol. 70 (1996) 8606]. After deletion {{of the envelope}} protein E 2 -encoding region, the respective sequence of classical swine fever virus (CSFV) strain Alfort 187 was inserted in-frame resulting in plasmid pA/CP 7 _E 2 alf. After transfection of in vitro-transcribed CP 7 _E 2 alf RNA, autonomous replication of chimeric RNA in bovine and porcine cell cultures was observed. Efficient growth of chimeric CP 7 _E 2 alf virus, however, could only be demonstrated on porcine cells, and {{in contrast to the}} parental BVDV strain CP 7, CP 7 _E 2 alf only inefficiently infected and propagated in bovine cells. The virulence, immunogenicity, and "marker vaccine" properties of the generated chimeric CP 7 _E 2 alf virus were determined in an animal experiment using 27 pigs. After intramuscular inoculation of 1 x 10 (7) TCID(50), CP 7 _E 2 alf proved to be completely avirulent, and neither viremia nor virus transmission to contact animals was observed; however, CSFV-specific neutralizing antibodies were detected from day 11 after inoculation. In addition, sera from all animals reacted positive in an E 2 -specific CSFV-antibody ELISA, but were negative for CSFV-E(RNS) -specific antibodies as determined with a CSFV marker ELISA. After challenge infection with highly virulent CSFV strain Eystrup, pigs immunized with CP 7 _E 2 alf were fully protected against clinical signs of CSFV infection, viremia, and shedding of challenge virus, and almost all animals scored positive in a CSFV marker ELISA. From our results, we conclude that chimeric CP 7 _E 2 alf may not only serve as a tool for a better understanding of Pestivirus <b>attachment,</b> entry, and <b>assembly,</b> but also represents an innocuous and efficacious modified live CSFV "marker vaccine"...|$|R
