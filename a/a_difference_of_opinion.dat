5|$|Gandhi {{believed}} that Buddhism, Jainism and Sikhism were traditions of Hinduism, with shared history, rites and ideas. At other times, {{he acknowledged that}} he knew little about Buddhism other than his reading of Edwin Arnold's book on it. Based on that book, he considered Buddhism to be a reform movement and the Buddha to be a Hindu. He stated he knew Jainism much more, and he credited Jains to have profoundly influenced him. Sikhism, to Gandhi, {{was an integral part}} of Hinduism, in the form of another reform movement. Sikh and Buddhist leaders disagreed with Gandhi, a disagreement Gandhi respected as <b>a</b> <b>difference</b> <b>of</b> <b>opinion.</b>|$|E

2500|$|By 1848, {{divergence}} {{of practice}} and belief {{led to the development}} of two separate branches.

25|$|Whether the President may speak {{publicly}} {{on issues}} without the Government's approval was discussed heavily during the 2011 presidential election. While some candidates {{and members of}} the public suggested that the President has power to do so, the Law Minister, K.Shanmugam, stated that the President's ability to speak freely is limited to those matters that, according to the Constitution, he exercises discretionary powers over. He should not act as a political centre distinct from the Government. <b>A</b> <b>difference</b> <b>of</b> <b>opinion</b> also exists over whether the President exercises soft power.|$|E
25|$|The {{wall was}} a {{temporary}} addition to support the arch above it, which had been weakened after the damage in the 1808 fire; it blocks {{the view of the}} rotunda, separates the entrance from the Catholicon, sits on top of the now-empty and desecrated graves of four 12th-century crusader kings—including Godfrey of Bouillon and Baldwin I of Jerusalem—and is no longer structurally necessary. There is <b>a</b> <b>difference</b> <b>of</b> <b>opinion</b> as to whether it is the 13th Station of the Cross, which others identify as the lowering of Jesus from the cross and locate between the 11th and 12th stations up on Calvary.|$|E
25|$|By 1880, {{the members}} of the X Club had {{prominent}} positions within the scientific community, and the club was highly regarded, but it was beginning to fall apart. In 1883, Spottiswoode died of typhoid and at the same time, according to Spencer, only two of the remaining eight members of the X club were in good health. Attendance at meetings began to dwindle and by 1885, Frankland and Lubbock urged for the election of new members. There was <b>a</b> <b>difference</b> <b>of</b> <b>opinion</b> on the matter and it was eventually dropped. In 1889, a rift emerged in the group when Huxley and Spencer had an argument over land nationalisation policies and refused to talk with one another.|$|E
50|$|The {{principle}} of such election rules {{in a club}} {{is that it is}} self-perpetuating to preserve the current ethos (and exclusivity) of the club, by ensuring that candidates are congenial to (almost) all the existing members; i.e., new members are elected by unanimous or near-unanimous agreement <b>of</b> voting members. <b>A</b> <b>difference</b> <b>of</b> <b>opinions</b> could be divisive, so that an election must be taken secretly as well as correctly.|$|R

25|$|Immediately {{after the}} A.G.N.A. was signed, Ribbentrop {{followed}} up with the next step that was intended to create the Anglo-German alliance, namely the Gleichschaltung (co-ordination) of all societies demanding the restoration of Germany's former colonies in Africa. On 3 July 1935, {{it was announced that}} Ribbentrop would head the efforts to recover Germany's former African colonies. Hitler and Ribbentrop believed that demanding colonial restoration would pressure the British into making an alliance with the Reich on German terms. But there was <b>a</b> <b>difference</b> <b>of</b> <b>opinion</b> between Ribbentrop and Hitler: Ribbentrop sincerely wished to recover the former German colonies, whereas for Hitler, colonial demands were just a negotiating tactic. Germany would renounce its demands in exchange for a British alliance.|$|E
25|$|By Talmudic {{times the}} {{practice}} of levirate marriage was deemed secondary in preference to halizah because of the brother's questionable intentions; indeed, to marry a brother's widow for her beauty was regarded by Abba Saul as equivalent to incest. Bar Kappara also recommends halizah. <b>A</b> <b>difference</b> <b>of</b> <b>opinion</b> appears among the later authorities, with Isaac Alfasi, Maimonides, and the Spanish school generally upholding the custom, while Rabbeinu Tam and the Northern school prefer halizah. A change of religion {{on the part of}} the surviving brother does not affect the obligation of the levirate, or its alternative, the halizah. Additionally, if the surviving brother is married, Ashkenazim, who follow the takkanah of Gershom ben Judah abolishing polygamy, would be compelled to perform halizah.|$|E
25|$|When McLane entered Jackson’s cabinet he {{immediately}} assumed {{a position of}} leadership. Articulate, persuasive and energetic, he had mastered the issues under debate and was confident he could lead {{the others in the}} administration, including the President. Recognizing there was <b>a</b> <b>difference</b> <b>of</b> <b>opinion</b> with Jackson over the Bank, he sought to work out a plan with the bank president, Nicholas Biddle, to provide for the upcoming renewal of the bank’s charter in return for the accomplishment of a key objective of the President, the retirement of the national debt. On December 7, 1831 he proposed a sweeping plan to accomplish that and more. Acclaimed for its Hamiltonian creativity, McLane had taken the initiative on the administration’s agenda, and was acting very much in the role of a Prime Minister. With enough time he was certain Jackson would soften his position and consent to the approach.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Through the {{investigation}} of a few (exemplary) fragments coming from the jurisprudential literature between II and III century A.

500|$|The {{film was}} {{shot on the}} island of Barra in 1948, with a unit of 80 staff from Ealing, {{although}} many of these were inexperienced because of filming by Ealing Studios on other works. The summer of 1948 brought heavy rain and gales, and the shoot ran five weeks over its planned 10-week schedule, and the film went £20,000 over budget (£ in [...] pounds). There was tension which led to disagreements between Danischewsky and Mackendrick during filming, including <b>a</b> <b>difference</b> <b>of</b> <b>opinion</b> concerning the moral tone of the film. Mackendrick sympathised with the pompous, high-minded, but spoilsport attempts of Waggett to foil the looting, while Danischewsky's sympathy lay with the islanders and their removal of the drink. Mackendrick later said: [...] "I began to realise that the most Scottish character in Whisky Galore! is Waggett the Englishman. He is the only Calvinist, puritan figure – and all the other characters aren't Scots at all: they're Irish!" ...|$|E
