40|$|The term {{bracketing}} {{has increasingly}} been employed in qualitative research. Although this term proliferates in scientific studies and professional journals, its application and operationalization remains vague and, often, superficial. The growing disconnection {{of the practice}} <b>of</b> <b>bracketing</b> in research from its origins in phenomenology has resulted in its fre-quent reduction to a formless technique, value stance, or black-box term. Mapping the subtle theoretical and philosophical underpinnings <b>of</b> <b>bracketing</b> will facilitate identification and delineation of core elements that compose bracketing, and distinguish how different research approaches prioritize different bracketing elements.

40|$|The use <b>of</b> <b>bracketing</b> {{in wealth}} surveys is {{sometimes}} criticized {{on the grounds}} that it will encourage respondents to substitute rough guesses for careful thought. In such a manner, the use <b>of</b> <b>bracketing</b> will "crowd out" more specific answers, creating the illusion of a reduction in nonresponse. This paper examines the patterns of wealth response in the first two waves of the Health and Retirement Study. On average, people do not appear to transition to <b>bracketing.</b> New tests <b>of</b> the breakeven level of crowding-out are suggested.

The {{purpose of this study}} was to evaluate the effect of an ultrasonic precrack preparation on the debonding force and failure modes <b>of</b> ceramic <b>bracket</b> removal. MethodsEighty extracted premolars were assigned to four groups: Inspire, precrack Inspire, Clarity, and precrack Clarity groups, with each group containing 20 teeth. The precrack preparations were made at the mesial gingival line angle <b>of</b> Inspire <b>brackets</b> and on the mesial side <b>of</b> Clarity <b>brackets</b> with an ultrasonic tip. Debonding force, failure modes, and bracket breakage score were measured and recorded. Fracture surfaces after bracket debonding were observed with scanning electron microscopy (SEM). ResultsWe found that the ultrasonic precrack preparation could significantly decrease the average debonding force and the mean <b>bracket</b> breakage scores <b>of</b> both kinds <b>of</b> ceramic <b>brackets.</b> After bracket debonding, 80 % <b>of</b> <b>brackets</b> in the precrack Inspire group and 100 % <b>of</b> <b>brackets</b> in the precrack Clarity group showed no bracket failure. However, only 25 % <b>of</b> <b>brackets</b> in the Inspire group and 75 % <b>of</b> <b>brackets</b> in the Clarity group showed no bracket failure. SEM micrographs showed a precrack notch at the adhesive resin after precrack preparation, and no enamel damage was noted after the bracket debonding. ConclusionThe ultrasonic precrack preparation can significantly decrease the debonding force and may guide the bracket debonding through a favorable fracture plane without damage to either the bracket or the enamel...|$|R

40|$|Background : Beside bracket position, {{the timing}} <b>of</b> <b>bracket</b> {{placement}} {{is one of}} the most essential in orthodontic treatment with fixed appliances. Even it seems simple the timing <b>of</b> <b>bracket</b> placement can be crucial and significantly influence the result of orthodontic treatment. However it is often found brackets are placed without complete understanding of its purpose and effects, which could be useless and even detrimental for the case. Purpose : The aim of this case report is to show that the timing <b>of</b> <b>bracket</b> placement could be different depending on the cases. Case : Five different cases are presented here with different timing <b>of</b> <b>bracket</b> placement. Case management : On these cases, brackets were placed on the upper arch first, on the lower arch first, or even only on some teeth first. Good and efficient orthodontic treatment results were achieved. Conclusion : For every orthodontic case, from the very beginning <b>of</b> treatment, <b>bracket</b> should be placed with the end result in mind. If brackets are correctly placed at a correct time, better treatment result could be achieved without unnecessary round tripping tooth movement. </span...|$|R

40|$|Due to {{functional}} requirement of a structural detail brackets {{with and without}} scallop are frequently used in bridges, decks, ships and offshore structure. Scallops are designed to serve as passage way for fluids, to reduce weld length and plate distortions. Moreover, scallops are used to avoid intersection {{of two or more}} welds for {{the fact that there is}} the presence of inventible inherent initial crack except for full penetrated weld and the formation of multi-axial stress state at the weld intersection. Welding all around the scallop corner increase the possibility of brittle fracture even for the case the bracket is not loaded by primary load. Avoiding of scallop will establish an initial crack in the corner if bracket is welded by fillet welds. If the two weld run pass had crossed, this would have given a 3 D residual stress situation. Therefore the presences and absence of scallop necessitates the 3 D FEA fatigue resistance of both types <b>of</b> <b>brackets</b> using effective notch stress approach (). FEMAP 10. 1 with NX NASTRAN was used for the 3 D FEA. The first and main objective of this research was to investigate and compare the fatigue resistance <b>of</b> <b>brackets</b> with and without scallop. The secondary goal was the fatigue design of scallops in case they cannot be avoided for some reason. The fatigue resistance for both types <b>of</b> <b>brackets</b> was determined based on approach using 1 mm fictitiously rounded radius based on IIW recommendation. Identical geometrical, boundary and loading conditions were used for the determination and comparison of fatigue resistance of both types <b>of</b> <b>brackets</b> using linear 3 D FEA. Moreover the size effect <b>of</b> <b>bracket</b> length was also studied using 2 D SHELL element FEA. In the case <b>of</b> <b>brackets</b> with scallop the flange plate weld toe at the corner of the scallop was found to exhibit the highest and made the flange plate weld toe critical for fatigue failure. Whereas weld root and weld toe at the weld intersections were the highly stressed location for brackets without scallop. Thus weld toe for brackets with scallop, and weld root and weld toe for brackets without scallop were found to be the critical area for fatigue failure. Employing identical parameters on both types <b>of</b> <b>brackets,</b> brackets without scallop had the highest except for full penetrated weld. Furthermore the fatigue resistance <b>of</b> <b>brackets</b> without scallop was highly affected by the lack of weld penetration length and it was found out that decreased as the weld penetration was increased. Despite the fact that the very presence of scallop reduces the stiffness and also same time induce stress concentration, based on the 3 D FEA it is worth concluding that using scallop provided better fatigue resistance when both types <b>of</b> <b>brackets</b> were fillet welded. However brackets without scallop had the highest fatigue resistance when full penetration weld was used. This thesis also showed that weld toe for brackets with scallop was the only highly stressed area unlike brackets without scallop in which both weld toe and weld root were the critical locations for fatigue failure when different types of boundary conditions were used. Weld throat thickness, plate thickness, scallop radius, lack of weld penetration length, boundary condition and weld quality affected the fatigue resistance of both types <b>of</b> <b>brackets.</b> And as a result, bracket design procedure, especially welding quality and post weld treatment techniques significantly affect the fatigue resistance of both type <b>of</b> <b>brackets...</b>|$|R
