40|$|Like most Western European countries, Germany stringently regulates {{dismissals}} and layoffs. Critics {{contend that}} this regulation raises {{the costs of}} employment adjustment and hence impedes employers' {{ability to respond to}} fluctuations in demand. Other German labor policies, however, most especially the availability of unemployment insurance benefits for those on short time, facilitate the <b>adjustment</b> <b>of</b> <b>average</b> hours per worker in lieu of layoffs. Building on earlier work, we compare the adjustment of employment, hours and inventories to demand shocks in the German and U. S. manufacturing sectors. We find that, in the short run, whereas U. S. employers rely principally on the adjustment of employment levels to respond to demand shocks, German employers rely principally on the <b>adjustment</b> <b>of</b> <b>average</b> hours per worker. The adjustment of overall labor input is generally similar in the two countries. Short-time work makes a very important contribution to short-run hours adjustment in Germany. We find little evidence that inventories help to buffer demand fluctuations in either country. Our findings suggest that, given appropriate supporting institutions, strong worker job security can be compatible with employers' need for flexibility in staffing levels. ...|$|E

Our analysis of productivity change, however, shows that technological improvements adopted by a few banks pushed out the efficient frontier, and that, on average, commercial banks experienced productivity gains. For banks with assets less than 0 million, however, technological improvement was insufficient to offset increased inefficiency, and thus productivity declined over the period.

40|$|Molecules of the {{extracellular}} matrix (ECM) can modulate {{the efficacy of}} synaptic transmission and neuronal excitability. These mechanisms are crucial for the homeostatic regulation of neuronal firing over extended timescales. In this study, we introduce a simple mathematical model of neuronal spiking balanced by {{the influence of the}} ECM. We consider a neuron receiving random synaptic input in the form of Poisson spike trains and the ECM, which is modeled by a phenomenological variable involved in two feedback mechanisms. One feedback mechanism scales the values of the input synaptic conductance to compensate for changes in firing rate. The second feedback accounts for slow fluctuations of the excitation threshold and depends on the ECM concentration. We show that the ECM-mediated feedback acts as a robust mechanism to provide a homeostatic <b>adjustment</b> <b>of</b> the <b>average</b> firing rate. Interestingly, the activation of feedback mechanisms may lead to a bistability in which two different stable levels <b>of</b> <b>average</b> firing rates can coexist in a spiking network.

40|$|Abstract—We {{propose a}} unified {{computational}} framework {{to build a}} statistical atlas of the cardiac fiber architecture from diffusion tensor magnetic resonance images (DT-MRIs). We apply this framework to a small database of nine ex vivo canine hearts. An average cardiac fiber architecture and a measure of its variability are computed based on most recent advances in diffusion tensor statistics. This statistical analysis confirms the already established good stability of the fiber orientations and a higher variability of the laminar sheet orientations within a given species. The statistical comparison between the canine atlas and a standard human cardiac DT-MRI shows a better stability of the fiber orientations than their laminar sheet orientations between the two species. The proposed computational framework {{can be applied to}} larger databases of cardiac DT-MRIs from various species to better establish intra- and inter-species statistics on the anatomical structure of cardiac fibers. This information will be useful to guide the <b>adjustment</b> <b>of</b> <b>average</b> fiber models onto specific patients from in vivo anatomical imaging modalities.

The index can thus represent a general business climate, i. e., expectations about the future course of the economy. This approach is empirically tested with the survey expectations published by the ZEW and ifo institute. The estimated co-efficients make economic sense and are highly significant. In particular, besides effects from fundamental data like the output gap in the recent past, one can identify a strong herding mechanism within both panels, such that metaphor-ically speaking the agents do not just join the crowd but follow each single motion of it. In addition, the transition probabilities of the ZEW agents are found to be influenced by the ifo climate but not the other way round. JEL classification: D 84, E 32, E 37...|$|R

40|$|In {{this thesis}} radar {{altimeter}} measurements over ice sheets {{carried out by}} the satellite GEOSAT between 1987 and 1989 are analysed for the area of the ice shelf Ekstroemisen in Antarctica. All altimeter measurements have to be improved for compensation of different influences during the way of the signal in the atmosphere, tidal influences etc. for the correct determination of heights. Additional corrections are necessary over ice. The retracking correction improves the measurement of the travel time of the signal by analysis of the returning waveform. The <b>average</b> <b>of</b> the retracking corrections {{in the area of the}} Ekstroemisen amounts to 70 cm. The accuracy of the height of the satellite orbit effects directly the accuracy of the height profiles. The adjustment uses the exact repeating satellite orbits for the computation of an addition constant for every height profile. The improved height profiles are used for the <b>adjustment</b> <b>of</b> an <b>averaged</b> height profile. The accuracy of the height profiles is given by the root mean square which are determined by the adjustment and vary in the range between #+-# 0. 3 m and #+-# 1. 3 m.

40|$|This study {{addresses}} the functional mapping of deep brain regions activated by odours in rats. For this purpose, manganese-enhanced MRI (MEMRI) was chosen. This method uses manganese (Mn) as an exogenous contrast agent (1). Manganese, a calcium analogue, is recruited by activated neurons {{and then slowly}} eliminated. This allows stimulations to be performed on conscious animals and images to be subsequently acquired under anaesthesia. Image contrast depends on intra-neuronal Mn concentration, and so reflects neuronal activity throughout the stimulation period. However, a major drawback of this technique is the toxic effect of manganese, which may alter locomotor behaviour and/or olfactory perception. First, we defined the maximal manganese dose that provided a good contrast in fMRI studies while simultaneously preserving normal behaviour in animals when Mn was injected into nostrils (2). Also, Mn remanence prevents control and activation state images being obtained in a single-subject experiment. Images have to be acquired through multisubject studies and spatial variation of Mn concentration assessed by groupwise image comparison. We have developed an original image processing sequence comprising (i) a semi-supervised brain segmentation method based on fast <b>adjustment</b> <b>of</b> an <b>average</b> three-dimensional brain model obtained from 20 manual segmentations and (ii) an iterative algorithm normalizing images in both spatial and intensity dimensions, independently of an a priori image target.

40|$|Musculoskeletal {{models are}} {{intended}} {{to be used to}} assist in prevention and treatments of musculoskeletal disorders. To capture important aspects of shoulder dysfunction, realistic simulation of clavicular and scapular movements is crucial. The range of motion of these bones is dependent on thoracic, clavicular and scapular anatomy and therefore different for each individual. Typically, patient or subject measurements will therefore not fit on a model that uses a cadaveric morphology. Up till now, this problem was solved by adjusting measured bone rotations such that they fit on the model, but this leads to <b>adjustments</b> <b>of</b> on <b>average</b> 3. 98 ° and, in some cases, even more than 8 °. Two novel methods are presented that decrease this discrepancy between experimental data and simulations. For one method, the model is scaled to fit the subject, leading to a 34 % better fit compared to the existing method. In the other method, the set of possible joint rotations is increased by allowing some variation on motion constraints, resulting in a 42 % better fit. This change in kinematics also affected the kinetics: muscle forces of some important scapular stabilizing muscles, as predicted by the Delft Shoulder and Elbow Model, were altered by maximally 17 %. The effect on the glenohumeral joint contact force was however marginal (1. 3 %). The methods presented in this paper might lead to more realistic shoulder simulations and can therefore be considered a step towards (clinical) application, especially for applications that involve scapular imbalance. © 2013 International Federation for Medical and Biological Engineering...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the transition from}} open channel flow to flow over submerged vegetation using velocity measurements collected with acoustic Doppler velocimetry (ADV) and particle-image velocimetry (PIV). Submerged canopies were constructed from arrays of rigid circular cylinders of height h in water of depth H. Both the canopy density, described by the frontal area per volume (a), and degree of submergence (H/h) were varied. Flow adjustment occurs in three stages. First, velocity begins to decelerate upstream of the canopy, due to a high-pressure region generated at the canopy leading edge, and continues to decelerate within the canopy, due to canopy drag. Rapid flow deceleration within the canopy creates strong vertical flux out through {{the top of the}} canopy that extends over a length proportional to the canopy drag length scale, (CDa) − 1, with CD being the canopy drag coefficient. Second, a mixing layer develops at the canopy interface, with the stress {{at the top of the}} canopy initially increasing, but eventually reaching a constant value. At this point, the flow within the canopy is fully developed. The length scale for mixing-layer development is related to canopy drag (CDa) and the depth ratio (H/h). In the third stage, the boundary layer above the mixing layer adjusts to the channel boundary conditions. A model is developed to predict the <b>adjustment</b> <b>of</b> vertically <b>averaged</b> velocity within the canopy. Measurements confirm that the flow adjustment is not dependent on canopy length.

In these `digital experiments', different units (people, devices, products) respond differently to the treatment. This article presents a fast and scalable Bayesian nonparametric analysis of such heterogeneous treatment effects and their measurement in relation to observable covariates. New results and algorithms are provided for quantifying the uncertainty associated with treatment effect measurement via both linear projections and nonlinear regression trees (CART and Random Forests). For linear projections, our inference strategy leads to results that are mostly in agreement with those from the frequentist literature. We find that linear regression <b>adjustment</b> <b>of</b> treatment effect <b>averages</b> (i. e., post-stratification) can provide some variance reduction, but that this reduction will be vanishingly small in the low-signal and large-sample setting of digital experiments. For regression trees, we provide uncertainty quantification for the machine learning algorithms that are commonly applied in tree-fitting. We argue that practitioners should look to ensembles of trees (forests) rather than individual trees in their analysis.
