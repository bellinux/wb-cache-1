There have also been numerous identifications of Nomadic pastoralism in archaeological sites, identified by a prevalence of sheep and goat bones, a lack of grain or grain-processing equipment, very limited architecture showing a set of characteristic traits, a location outside the region's zone of agriculture, and ethnographic analogy to modern nomadic pastoral peoples.|$|E
5|$|Anti-Earp {{writers and}} {{researchers}} use Frank Waters' Earp Brothers of Tombstone, <b>as</b> <b>their</b> <b>primary</b> source for material that presents Wyatt Earp {{as something of}} a villainous monster, aided and abetted by his brothers who were almost brutes. Waters detested the Earps so badly that he presented a book that was terribly flawed, poorly edited, and brimming with prevarications. In his other work, Waters is poetic. In the Earp Brothers of Tombstone, he {{is little more than a}} tabloid hack, trying to slander someone he dislikes. To date, no reason has been uncovered for the bias Frank Waters exhibited against Wyatt Earp and his brothers.|$|E

However, the two clubs {{felt it would}} have been a shame for neither to wear their traditional colours, and they agreed to toss a coin to see who would have first choice. Manchester United won the toss and therefore wore their usual European colours of red shirts, white shorts and white socks, while Bayern wore silver shirts, shorts and socks, all with maroon trim.|$|E
5|$|HMS Hotspur was {{inspired}} by a series of French coast-defence ships with the ram <b>as</b> <b>their</b> <b>primary</b> weapon. The layout of Glatton was modified with a fixed turret and her freeboard was increased over that of the older ship. The single 12-inch gun was mounted on a turntable and could pivot at each gun port to maximise its arc of fire. It was nominally capable of firing forward, but this proved to damage the upper deck.|$|E

5|$|The Early Neolithic was {{a revolutionary}} period of British history. Between 4500 and 3800 BCE, it saw a {{widespread}} change in lifestyle as the communities {{living in the}} British Isles adopted agriculture <b>as</b> <b>their</b> <b>primary</b> form of subsistence, abandoning the hunter-gatherer lifestyle that had characterised the preceding Mesolithic period. This came about through contact with continental societies, although it is unclear to what extent this {{can be attributed to}} an influx of migrants or to indigenous Mesolithic Britons adopting agricultural technologies from the continent. The region of modern Kent would have been a key area for the arrival of continental European settlers and visitors, because of its position on the estuary of the River Thames and its proximity to the continent.|$|E
5|$|The French {{operations}} in the area were hampered {{by a lack of}} a suitable base close to the mouth of the Adriatic; the British had given the French free access to Malta, but it was hundreds of miles away. The Austrians also possessed several submarines, one of which torpedoed the dreadnought Jean Bart in December 1914. The threat from underwater weapons greatly limited French naval activities in the Adriatic. As the war progressed, the French eventually settled on Corfu <b>as</b> <b>their</b> <b>primary</b> naval base in the area. Later in the war, Vérité was sent to Mudros along with her sister ships. After the end of the war, Vérité was stricken from the naval register in 1922 and subsequently broken up for scrap.|$|E

5|$|During {{the spring}} of 1990, Anjali Dutt was hired to replace Moulder, who had left {{to work with the}} bands Shakespears Sister and Ride. Dutt {{assisted}} in the recording of vocals and several guitar tracks. During this period, the band recorded in various studios, often spending just a single day at a studio before deciding that it was unsuitable. In May 1990, My Bloody Valentine settled on Protocol in Holloway <b>as</b> <b>their</b> <b>primary</b> location, and work began in earnest on the album, as well as a second EP, Tremolo. Like Glider, Tremolo contained a song—"To Here Knows When"—that would later appear on Loveless. The band stopped recording during the summer of 1990 in order to tour in support of the release of Glider. When Moulder returned to the project in August, he was surprised by how little work had been completed. By that point Creation Records was concerned at how much the album was costing. Moulder left again in March 1991 to work for the noise pop band The Jesus and Mary Chain.|$|E
5|$|Even though {{social impact}} of {{television}} in Croatia {{is considered to}} be imperfect and that of variable quality, television is important in the society because it offers a way for non-governmental organizations to communicate their concerns to the public and to criticize the government and other aspects of politics of Croatia.

That percentage varies significantly by geographic regionfrom 43% in Zagreb and areas surrounding the capital to 79% in Slavoniabut in every region it surpasses all other sources of information, the second most widely used source of information being the Internet averaging at 19%.

The ravages of history have greatly reduced {{the percentage of}} ethnic minorities living in Kraków. The official and unofficial numbers differ, {{as in the case}} of Romani people. Hence, according to the 2002 census, among those who have declared their national identity (irrespective of language and religion) in Kraków Voivodeship, 1,572 were Slovaks, followed by Ukrainians (472), Jews (50) and Armenians (22). Romani people, officially numbered at 1,678, are estimated at over 5,000.

The region of modern Kent would have been a key area for the arrival of continental European settlers and visitors, because of its position on the estuary of the River Thames and its proximity to the continent.|$|E
5|$|The Impact Global Championship is a {{professional}} wrestling world heavyweight championship owned by the promotion Impact Wrestling, formerly Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA). From June 2002 to May 2007, TNA used the NWA World Heavyweight Championship <b>as</b> <b>their</b> <b>primary</b> championship due to {{an agreement with the}} National Wrestling Alliance (NWA). On May 13, 2007, the NWA abruptly ended the arrangement and retrieved control of the NWA World Heavyweight Championship. On the same night, TNA were set to host their annual Sacrifice pay-per-view event, in which the NWA World Heavyweight Championship was to be defended by then-champion Christian Cage against Kurt Angle and Sting in a three-way match. Angle won the match and on the following episode of TNA's television program Impact! on May 17, was declared the new TNA World Heavyweight Champion. He was stripped of the championship later in the program, with Management Director Jim Cornette citing a problematic finish to the title match. The ownership of the championship was decided on June 17, 2007 at TNA's Slammiversary event in a King of the Mountain match involving Angle and Cage along with A.J. Styles, Chris Harris and Samoa Joe, which Angle won.|$|E
5|$|The filmmakers chose St. Vincent <b>as</b> <b>their</b> <b>primary</b> {{shooting}} location, as {{it contained}} the quietest beach they could find, and built three piers and a backlot for Port Royal and Tortuga.

For budget reasons, the ships were built on docks, with only six days spent in the open sea for the battle between the Black Pearl and the Interceptor. The Dauntless and the Black Pearl were built on barges, with computer-generated imagery finishing the structures. The Black Pearl was also built on the Spruce Goose stage, {{in order to control}} fog and lighting. The Interceptor was a re-dressed Lady Washington, a full-scale replica sailing ship from Aberdeen, Washington, fully repainted before going on a 40-day voyage beginning December 2, 2002, arriving on location on January 12, 2003.
