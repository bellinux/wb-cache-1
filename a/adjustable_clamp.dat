50|$|A selfie stick is a monopod {{used to take}} selfie {{photographs}} by positioning a smartphone or camera beyond the normal range of the arm. The metal sticks are typically extensible, with a handle on one end and an <b>adjustable</b> <b>clamp</b> {{on the other end}} to hold a phone in place. Some have remote or Bluetooth controls, letting the user decide when to take the picture, and models designed for cameras have a mirror behind the viewscreen so that the shot can be lined up. In contrast to a monopod for stabilising a camera on the ground, a selfie stick's arm is thickest and strongest at the opposite end from the camera in order to provide better grip and balance when held aloft. Safety concerns and the inconvenience the product causes to others have resulted in them being banned at many venues, including all Disney Parks, both Universal Studios Orlando and Hollywood.|$|E

30|$|Accordingly, a {{main finding}} of our study, in which cardiac output was {{maintained}} stable, was {{the preservation of}} intestinal perfusion and oxygenation. We used a comprehensive approach for evaluation that included measurements of regional blood flow, oxygen transport and consumption, tissue PCO 2, and videomicroscopy of the villi. After 2  h of an IAH of 20  mm Hg and a mean final APP lower than 50  mm Hg, all variable values were preserved. In addition, the superior mesenteric artery blood flow {{was not related to}} APP. This finding evidences the intestinal ability to autoregulate blood flow at lower driving pressures than other organs, such as the kidney. In line with our results, a previous animal study in which intestinal perfusion pressure was reduced by means of an <b>adjustable</b> <b>clamp</b> showed an ischemic threshold of only 33  mm Hg of MAP [23]. Taking everything into account, we might speculate that in IAH, intestinal oxygenation and perfusion are preserved despite the fall in APP, because the intestine has a very low limit of flow autoregulation. The maintenance of cardiac output, however, seems to be required for such preservation.|$|E

To {{evaluate}} {{effects of}} graded intestinal hypoperfusion and reperfusion on intestinal metabolic parameters as assessed by a modified continuous saline tonometry technique. Materials. Twelve barbiturate-anaesthetized female pigs. Methods. Measurements were performed {{prior to and}} during three predefined levels of superior mesenteric mean arterial blood pressure (PSMA 70, 50 and 30 mmHg, respectively, each 80 min long), obtained by an <b>adjustable</b> <b>clamp</b> around {{the origin of the}} superior mesenteric artery, and during reperfusion. We continuously measured jejunal mucosal perfusion (laser Doppler flowmetry), jejunal tissue oxygen tension (PO 2 TISSUE; microoximetry) and intramucosal PCO 2 (continuous saline tonometry) and calculated net intestinal lactate production, mesenteric oxygenation, PCO 2 gap (jejunal mucosal PCO 2 −arterial PCO 2) and pHi. Results. At PSMA 70 and 50 mmHg mesenteric oxygen uptake and net lactate production remained unaltered, in spite of decreased oxygen delivery. At these PSMA levels PCO 2 gap increased, while pHi and PO 2 TISSUE decreased. At PSMA 30 mmHg pronounced increases in PCO 2 gap and mesenteric net lactate production as well as marked decreases in PO 2 TISSUE and pHi were demonstrated. Data indicate absence of anaerobic conditions at an intestinal perfusion pressure (IPP) ⩾ 41 mmHg, a pHi⩾ 7. 22 or PCO 2 gap⩽ 15. 8 mmHg. Conclusions.

40|$|THE use of indicator-dilution curves dur-ing cardiac {{catheterization}} has greatly clarified the hemodynamics of various con-genital cardiovascular malformations. 1 2 As presently used, {{the combination of}} indicator-dilution curves and oximetry is usually suffi-cient to establish a definitive diagnosis. In some subjects with small left-to-right intra-cardiac shunts, however, the usual diagnostic methods are inadequate. In attempts to prove the existence of small shunits additional diag-nostic procedures may be required such as the placement of 2 catheters in {{the right side of}} the heart 3 or catheterization of the left side of the heart. 4 The present study reports the injection of indicator substance with the cath-eter in the pulmonary wedge position as an additional diagnostic aid. Material and Methods In mongrel dogs, a cardiac catheter was wedged in the pulmonary artery, and, with use of the Westinghouse intensifier, sufficient quantities of Renographin or Hypaque were injected to outline graphically the course followed by a wedge injec-tion.

30|$|Gradual {{development}} of varus and procurvatum occurs with proximal femoral lengthening, {{irrespective of the}} type of external fixator device used. With circular systems, the possibility of correction of the deformity after lengthening is useful. Some monolateral rail systems also posses <b>adjustable</b> <b>clamps</b> (e.g. the micrometric swivel clamp of the Orthofix LRS) that allow the correction of the varus component to be reduced but, being a device applied in the coronal plane, correction of procurvatum is more difficult. In general, this deformity is not a clinically significant issue in subtrochanteric lengthening if the target lengthening is kept 5 – 6  cm. Should the surgeon wish to achieve a greater length using a monolateral device, consideration should then be given for bifocal femoral lengthening where it is possible to achieve 5  cm of lengthening at each osteotomy site. Bifocal femoral lengthening should not be used for lengthening for congenital pathologies (especially longitudinal deficiency of the femur) as the tension created in the soft tissues will become excessive.|$|R

40|$|AbstractPurpose: Experiments were {{designed}} to determine effects of dietary supplementation with L -arginine on structure and function of flow-restricted vein grafts. Methods: Saphenous veins were placed as bilateral interposition grafts in femoral arteries of two groups of adult male mongrel dogs; one group was maintained on a normal diet (control), the other group supplemented with L -arginine (200 mg/kg per day) beginning 1 week before surgery. In each dog, flow was reduced by 50 % in one graft by placing an <b>adjustable</b> <b>clamp</b> on the artery distal to the distal anastomosis. Plasma amino acids and oxidized products of nitric oxide (NOx) were measured before and after L -arginine feeding. At postoperative week 4, grafts were removed and prepared for organ chamber studies to determine functions of the endothelium or smooth muscle and for histology. Results: Plasma L -arginine increased within 3 hours after feeding and increased from 141 ± 8 nmol/mL to 169 ± 11 nmol/mL (n = 6) after 5 weeks of supplementation. Plasma ornithine and citrulline paralleled arginine, whereas circulating NOx was unchanged. Maximal contractions to 60 mmol/L KCl were reduced in grafts from L -arginine–fed dogs. Endothelium-dependent relaxations to the calcium ionophore A 23187 and relaxations of the smooth muscle NO were reduced in grafts from L -arginine–fed dogs. Neointimal hyperplasia was increased in grafts with reduced flow and not affected by arginine feeding. Conclusions: Dietary supplementation with L -arginine did not increase plasma NO in dogs with peripheral vein grafts or increase endothelium-dependent relaxations in control or flow-restricted grafts. Therefore, dietary supplementation with L -arginine may not improve long-term functions of flow-restricted peripheral bypass grafts. (J Vasc Surg 2001; 33 : 829 - 39. ...|$|E
40|$|Experimental and {{analytical}} studies {{of a new}} seismic isolation and energy dissipation system for buildings were conducted. The system (GT-BIS) was developed by Federico Garza-Tamez of Monterrey, Mexico. The system is composed of four elements: (1) base isolation devices, (2) damping devices, (3) an <b>adjustable</b> <b>clamp</b> {{which can be used}} to adjust the effective length of the tension members, and (4) a single pin wind restraint disengaging device. The main components are the isolation devices. The base columns of the building are supported by cables, or rods, or other tension members which are attached to a small frame that encircles each column and rests on the foundation. With proper use of the clamping device the building response to an earthquake is like that of a single-degree-of-freedom pendulum. The clamps may be adjusted to achieve the desired period of vibration. The GT-BIS also employs a novel hydraulic damping system that very effectively dissipates seismic energy. The damping system is designed {{in such a way that}} it permits translation but inhibits torsional motion. The wind restraint device utilizes a spring loaded pin which does not allow relative displacement between the building and the foundation under wind loading but disengages when an earthquake occurs. Free vibration, sinusoidal and earthquake simulation tests of a l/ 8 -scale model of a nine story building were conducted on the earthquake simulator at the US Army Construction Engineering Research Laboratory located in Champaign, Illinois. As a results of these tests the following conclusions were made: 1. The GT -BIS isolation system is very effective at reducing the acceleration response and base shear of a building subjected to an earthquake. The base shears of the isolated model varied from 4 percent to 35 percent of those of the fixed base model...|$|E

40|$|In 1934, {{pathologist}} Harry Goldblatt {{established the}} first animal model of hypertension. This model provided researchers {{with the tools}} to delineate the renin-angiotensin system of blood pressure control and, eventually, to design enzyme inhibitors {{for the treatment of}} chronic hypertension. As early as the mid– 19 th century, physicians had noted that patients with kidney disease and those with long-term high blood pressure (hypertension) both had enlarged heart muscles. The first clue to this kidney–hypertension connection came from physiologists Robert Tigerstedt and Per Bergman who injected kidney extracts into rabbits, thus triggering a dramatic rise in blood pressure. In a prophetic explanation, they suggested that the kidneys produced a soluble protein— they called it renin—that triggered a rise in blood pressure (1). A little help from man’s best friend Decades later, the duo’s results prompted attempts to provoke hypertension by stressing or injuring the kidneys of animals. None were successful until Harry Goldblatt arrived on the scene. Goldblatt had noted a characteristic narrowing of the renal blood vessels in patients who had died of hypertension. He reasoned that a decreased blood flow, and thus oxygen supply, to the kidneys (ischemia) might somehow trigger hypertension. To test this idea, Goldblatt partially constricted the major renal arteries of dogs using a self-styled <b>adjustable</b> silver <b>clamp.</b> Partial constriction of both renal arteries resulted in a reproducible and persistent rise in blood pressure, in the absence of overt renal failure. Clamping other large arteries—splenic or femoral— had no effect, indicating that hypertension resulted specifically from kidney ischemia. Goldblatt published these result...|$|R
40|$|The {{appearance}} of proteinuria in patients suf-fering from {{congestive heart failure}} is a common clinical occurrence. Since such patients, without any intrinsic renal disease, frequently have both an elevated renal venous pressure and a reduced renal blood flow (1), {{it would seem that}} either one or both of these factors may lead to protein-uria. Proteinuria has been produced experimentally by partial obstruction either of the renal artery or of the renal vein (2 - 5). In most of this work, however, studies of renal hemodynamics were in-complete, or when adequate pressure and blood flow measurements were made (6, 7), the ex-periments were such {{that it was impossible to}} de-termine specifically which hemodynamic factor was responsible for the {{appearance of}} the pro-teinuria. The present study was undertaken in an at-tempt to define further the hemodynamic changes responsible for the excretion of protein by the acutely congested kidney. METHODS Experiments were performed on 26 adult female mon-grel dogs weighing between 10 kg. and 30 kg.

Several procedures were performed and adjustable or non-adjustable instruments have been used to decrease pulmonary blood flow. Most of them were applied to newborns, but no instrument is designed and available for the use in adults. The study "Adjustable Vessel Constrictor" was performed for the conception, development and experimental animal trial of an externally <b>adjustable</b> vessel <b>clamp,</b> called "Constrictor". It was surgically placed around the pulmonary artery trunc and allowed chronically progressive reduction of the perfused diametral area.

The analysis of 25 experimental animal trials and the consequent modifications of the constrictor led to the patented final version, which allows the chronically progressive induction of right ventricular hypertrophy. The analysis of the animal trials data (histology of myocard, echocardiographic parameters and characteristic changes in pressure load) revealed, that the externally adjustable constrictor allows the increase in ventricular afterload up to 80 % of the systemic pressure and thereby leads to myocardhypertrophy with preservation of intact ventricular function within 3 weeks of chronically progressive constriction...|$|R

In the control group (n = 6), no stenosis was induced Each dog was subjected to 2 h of myocardial ischemia followed by balloon deflation and 24 h of reperfusion. Myocardial blood flow assessed with microspheres was similar during balloon inflation in both groups and indicative of profound ischemia. Transmural {{blood flow to the}} reperfused zone assessed 1 min after balloon deflation was significantly greater in control dogs without residual stenosis (383 % of normal compared with 120 % of normal in dogs with stenosis) (p < 0. 01). Compromise of transmural flow persisted in dogs with stenosis (85 % compared with 121 % of normal in control dogs after 1 h, p < 0. 05; and 49 % compared with 68 % after 24 h of reperfusion, p < 0. 05). Diminution of subendocardial blood Row after reperfusion was particularly marked. The extent of infarction was greater in the heart of dogs with residual stenosis. Thus, residual critical coronary stenosis compromises nutritional perfusion and salvage of reperfused myocardium after recanallzation. These observations underscore the need for prompt identification of patients with high grade residual stenosis early after coronary thrombolysis and the potential value of angioplasty or coronary surgery in selected patients soon after initial recanalization...|$|R

As the requirements for space missions extend to new regions of space and more stringent requirements are placed on spacecraft performance, it becomes necessary {{to better understand the}} underlying conduction mechanisms that determine the dynamic response of insulators to temperature, electric field dose rate, and sample conditioning and history. This study performed detailed measurements of the transient conductivity of representative highly disordered insulating materials using the constant voltage method and analyzed the data with dynamic models for the time, temperature, and electric field dependant conductivity. We describe substantial upgrades to an existing Constant Voltage Chamber (CVC), which improved the precision of conductivity measurements by more than an order of magnitude. A battery operated voltage source supplied a highly stable applied voltage. Data acquisition and analysis algorithms and the interfaces between electronics and the data acquisition system were optimized for higher precision and accuracy. Painstaking attention to ground loops, shielding, filtering and other associated issues greatly reduced electrical noise in the extremely low (3 ̆c 0. 2 fA) current measurements.. Mechanical systems, including vacuum and cryogenic equipment, were also modified to eliminate excessive noise.

A sliding-base mechanical fractionator that permits more effi-cient and accurate separation of medium and fine (20 - 5 ~ and 5 - 2 #, respectively) silt fractions from unconsolidated sediments has been de-veloped. For the coarse silt (50 - 20 /z) fraction, the unit developed by Beavers and Jones (1962, p. 303 - 304) is satisfactory and efficient. However, be-cause of long sedimentation times, this unit is too time consuming when separating the medium and fine silt fractions.
