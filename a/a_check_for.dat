Jerry (Jim O'Heir) is allowed to play the piano, but everyone dismisses his skilled playing as a racket. Mark finally returns to propose and walks on the set with the ring, but Leslie stops him by mooning the camera. Detlef Schrempf and Tom finally arrive at the end of Leslie's programming block.

25|$|As {{shown by}} the table above, because many {{procedures}} are optional, border guards have discretion in deciding how rigorously they check travellers at external border crossing points. As a result, {{the length of time}} taken to perform checks differs between Schengen countries. Under the previous regime (whereby those with the right to freedom of movement were subject only to a 'minimum check'), <b>an</b> entry <b>check</b> <b>for</b> <b>an</b> EU, EEA or Swiss citizen took around five seconds on average in Italy, whilst in Norway, on average it took around 1 minute. The disparities in checks on third-country nationals (who are subject to <b>a</b> more thorough <b>check)</b> are even greater. <b>For</b> example, <b>an</b> entry <b>check</b> <b>for</b> <b>an</b> Annex II national takes around 15 seconds on average in Greece, whilst it takes three to five minutes on average in Slovakia. Similarly, <b>an</b> entry <b>check</b> <b>for</b> <b>an</b> Annex I national on average lasts around 30–60 seconds in The Netherlands, whilst in Latvia, it lasts around two to five minutes on average.|$|R

5|$|Another {{explanation}} surmised is that Wagner did not consent {{because he}} felt he was not receiving just compensation from the ATC for his baseball card. Wagner had a history of being a tough negotiator; he had announced his retirement from baseball in December 1907, but returned shortly {{before the start of the}} 1908 baseball season after receiving a $10,000 contract, double his salary from the 1907 season. This theory has its flaws, however, since Wagner sent Gruber <b>a</b> <b>check</b> <b>for</b> $10 to compensate him for the fee ATC would have paid him if Wagner had given permission to create his baseball card. Michael O'Keeffe and Teri Thompson, authors of The Card: Collectors, Con Men, and the True Story of History's Most Desired Baseball Card, asked why Wagner would compensate Gruber for $10, a substantial amount of money at the time (approximately equal to $275 in 2016), if he refused authorization for monetary reasons. The ATC had already produced a number of T206 Honus Wagner baseball cards; the exact number is unknown, but is speculated to be between 50 and 200. They stopped production of the card, however, after Wagner denied authorization.|$|E
5|$|Around 1995, the Government Service Insurance System (GSIS) {{called a}} bidding {{to sell the}} property. The tender went to a Malaysian firm, the Renong Berhad and ITT-Sheraton combine over Emilio Yap, a Chinese Filipino billionaire tycoon {{and owner of the}} Manila Bulletin, the country's largest {{newspaper}} by circulation. Yap went to the Supreme Court of the Philippines and won by matching Rehong's bid and citing the Constitution's Filipino First policy in the ownership of a 'national patrimony'. Fifty one percent of the ownership was awarded to Yap's Manila Prince Hotel Corporation (MPHC), while new owners joined on April 25, 1997 as 49 percent shareholder. Yap signed <b>a</b> <b>check</b> <b>for</b> ₱673.2 million and the MPHC took over the property on May 7, 1997. One of the first things Yap did was to pull down the three brass chandeliers in the lobby, upon recommendation of a feng shui expert, and replace them with five.|$|E
5|$|Jim Halpert (John Krasinski) convinces {{regional}} manager Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) {{that he needs}} to choose someone to act as an Assistant to the Assistant to the Regional Manager (A.A.R.M.). Jim designs several Dwight-oriented challenges as tryouts for the position, and it is inevitably found that Dwight is the most qualified. Angela Lipton (Angela Kinsey) is forced to bring her child, Phillip, to work, after her daycare turns her child away. Dwight, upon overhearing that Phillip has been eating the type of paper which he himself regards as the most flavorful, begins to think that Angela's son is actually his. To test this theory, Dwight offers the child either <b>a</b> <b>check</b> <b>for</b> one million dollars or a beet; Phillip picks the beet. Dwight tells Angela that he will marry her if the child is his, but she denies that this is the case. Dwight then confers with Jim, asking whether he should propose to Angela or his girlfriend Esther, who he thinks is the more logical choice. Jim tells Dwight {{that he needs to}} put aside logic and follow his instincts. Dwight makes up his mind and proposes to Angela, who says yes. Angela finally reveals to Dwight that Phillip is indeed his son, explaining that she lied about his parentage in order to test Dwight's feelings for her.|$|E
