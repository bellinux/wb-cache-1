The idea of a saint appearing before laity was common in Northern art of the period, and is also represented in van Eyck's Virgin and Child with Canon van der Paele (1434–36). There, the Canon is portrayed <b>as</b> <b>if</b> having just momentarily paused to reflect on a passage from his hand-held bible as the Virgin and Child with two saints appear before him, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> embodiments of his prayer.|$|E

25|$|When {{rescission}} is claimed, it is {{not possible}} to also claim expectation damages <b>as</b> <b>if</b> the contract were to be performed. Either rescission, or damages <b>as</b> <b>if</b> the contract were still in force, can be claimed, but it would be inconsistent to do both. In Whittington v Seale-Hayne it was held that damages for losses <b>as</b> <b>if</b> the contract were still in force, and to put the claimant in the position <b>as</b> <b>if</b> he had never entered it, could not both be claimed. So where Mr Whittington's prize poultry died on a polluted farm which Seale-Hayne represented was sanitary, Mr Whittington got an indemnity for council rates and repair costs, but not for the loss of profits. At the time it was not possible to also recoup costs for the dead poultry, but later Hedley Byrne negligence or Misrepresentation Act 1967 s 2(1) provided this remedy.|$|E
