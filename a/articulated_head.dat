50|$|The Martin Jetpack {{is a small}} VTOL {{device with}} two ducted fans that provide lift and a 2.0-litre V4 piston 200-horsepower {{gasoline}} engine. Although its pilot straps onto it and does not sit, the device cannot be classed as a backpack device because it is too large to be worn while walking. Although the Martin Jetpack {{does not meet the}} Federal Aviation Administration's classification of an ultralight aircraft: it meets weight and fuel restrictions, but it cannot meet the power-off stall speed requirement. The intention is to create a specific classification for the jetpack - it uses the same petrol used in cars, is relatively easy to fly, and is cheaper to maintain and operate than other ultralight aircraft. Most helicopters require a tail rotor to counteract the rotor torque, which, along with the <b>articulated</b> <b>head</b> complicate flying, construction, and maintenance enormously. The Martin Jetpack is designed to be torque neutral - it has no tail rotor, no collective, no articulating or foot pedals - and this design simplifies flying dramatically. Pitch, roll and yaw are controlled by one hand, height by the other.|$|E

40|$|The <b>Articulated</b> <b>Head</b> is a {{collaboration}} between the performance artist Stelarc and researchers from the Marcs Auditory Laboratories at the University of Western Sydney, to explore the potential for robot-human communication. A three-dimensional image programmed with a complex range of human facial expressions and wide repertoire of everyday speech is mounted on a robotic structure to create a human/machine hybrid. As a gallery installation, the <b>Articulated</b> <b>Head</b> works to establish real-time dialogue between a virtual presence and physically present human being (the gallery visitor), but what does ‘presence’ mean in this situation? At one level, it means simply that the two conversational participants are co-present in time and space. Their engagement, though, involves highly nuanced processes of mutual sensory detection that may be far more subtly communicative than the verbal content of the dialogue. One might say quite literally that they are attracted to each other. This presentation explores the historical association between presence, attraction and magnetism in electro-mechanical research, {{going back to the}} speculations of Renaissance Magus John Dee (1527 - 1608) whose writings on magnetic rays may still have something to teach us about sensory interaction between different kinds of intelligent bodies. Stelarc professes a dislike for historical research into antecedents, and that is not the nature of this enquiry. Rather, I am interested in how certain ideas and images form cultural feedback loops across time, forming remote conversations of another kind...|$|E

50|$|The Emucarididae have a non-calcified {{exoskeleton}} {{that consists}} of an <b>articulating</b> <b>head</b> shield (or cephalon), thorax and tail shield (or pygidium), {{and there are no}} constrictions where these parts meet. The cephalon is semi-circular and has a straight back margin. The thorax consists of 3 or 4 narrow segments. The pygidium is 1-2× as long as the cephalon and has a distinct border furrow. The mouth plate (or hypostome) that sits on the belly-side of the cephalon is elongated and divided by a straight left-to-right suture. The frontal portion is approximately square with two pointed horns that extend from the frontal margin to the sides (like in a capital T), the back portion is longer than wide with a round back margin. The pair of relatively short antennas are implanted behind the horns of the hypostome and stick out to the sides. There appear to be three pairs of limbs under the cephalon, carrying side branches with bristle-like gills (or setae).|$|R
40|$|Research objective: {{to develop}} and {{implement}} a new clinical method of producing a set of kappa-splints for splint therapy: treatment and prevention of various forms of pathological teeth abrasion in combination with dentition defects and dentition deformations, which will enable to prevent significant disorders in the dentition. Materials and Methods: 36 patients aged 30 - 59 have been selected for the targeted research with a generalized form of pathological tooth wear in combination with dentition defects and dentition deformations. Results: After studying the movements of conventional hinge axis in <b>articulate</b> <b>heads</b> of TMJ with the help of condylograph «Cadiax Compact», some asynchronous, asymmetrical bias of <b>articulate</b> <b>heads</b> during the movements of the mandible were revealed in patients with pathological tooth wear in combination with dentitiondefects and dentition deformations. While examining, the patients complained about the aesthetic defects due to the abrasion of teeth and the change of their colour, the discomfort while closing, chewing and phonetic disorders. In the clinical picture of these patients, the typical symptoms of TMJ dysfunction can be singled out, such as pain and crunch in joints, fatigue of chewing muscles and pain in the muscles, the displacement of the mandible to the side during vertical movements, a feeling of fullness in the ears, headaches and bruxism. Dentition deformations were presented as a violation of the occlusal curve. The results indicate on the presence of functional TMJ disorders and masticatory muscles dysfunction in pathological teeth abrasion in combination with dentition defects. So, in most cases, temporary prosthesis structures and occlusal splints can be applied to normalize occlusive correlations at the dysfunction of TMJ and masticatory muscles. Gradual lifting of occlusion has been done due to a set of kappa-splints in terms of 14 days, 1 month and 3 months from 1. 0 to 5. 0 mm to the full restoration of occlusal height, depending on the severity of pathological teeth abrasion. It is the gradual application of a kappa-splints’ set which allows prevention of further tooth wear; it doesn’t influence the periodontium of teeth; it’s aesthetic and does not violate the pronunciation of sounds. The material, which a kappa-splints set is made of, provides better fixation and bite separation with optimal thickness throughout the dentition, which allows the lower jaw to take a position that helps to restore the functional balance of the entire dentition. Conclusions: 1. According to the results of the research it has been established that the orthopedic treatment with the help of occlusive splints at the preparatory stage for the patients with occlusive disorders at pathological dental hard tissues abrasion in combination with dentition defects, periodontium tissue disease and dentition deformations are urgent for the normalization of occlusive correlations of the jaws. 2. After studying the movements of conventional hinge axis in <b>articulate</b> <b>heads</b> of TMJ with the help of condylograph «Cadiax Compact» and eliminating the symptoms of stress in masticatory muscles of the patients with occlusive disorders at pathological dental hard tissues abrasion, it is the gradual application of a kappa-splints set, made of hard transparent plates of Ercodent Ercodur material (Germany) with a thickness of 1. 0 to 5. 0 mm, which allows prevention of further tooth wear, normalization of occlusive correlations of the jaws, separating a bite with optimum thickness throughout the dentition, thus the lower jaw takes a position at which the state of functional equilibrium of the entire dentition is restored...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} early {{vertebrate}} fossil remains from the Lower Palaeozoic strata of the Barrandian area (Bohemian Massif). It {{is presented as}} a compilation of four papers that were published or submitted in scientific peer-reviewed journals with impact factor. All included papers are focused on the most abundant and diverse vertebrate fauna from the Barrandian area - the placoderms. Placodermi are early vertebrates characterized by <b>articulated</b> <b>head</b> and trunk shields composed of dermal bony plates. In the Barrandian area, they occur exclusively in the Devonian of the Prague Basin. The main objectives of the thesis are modern taxonomic revisions of the placoderm taxa from the Prague Basin as well as discussions about trends in their abundance, diversity, and distribution in space and time, taphonomy, and the evolutionary and phylogenetic implications of their morphology. Two characteristic placoderm associations were distinguished. In the Lochkovian and Pragian, members of the group Acanthothoraci dominate the placoderm record. Acanthothoracid placoderms are among the most basal jawed vertebrates and thus a detailed study of their morphology has a great potential to illuminate the relationships and evolutionary patterns among the stem jawed vertebrates. They are most abundant in the [...] ...|$|E
