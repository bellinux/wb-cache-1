25|$|In 2005, after a {{modelling}} career, Pettyfer {{made his}} professional acting début in the British television production of Tom Brown's Schooldays, playing the lead character, Tom Brown; he received positive reviews for the role. In June 2005, he {{was cast in}} his most prominent role so far, that of teenage MI6 spy Alex Rider in the film Stormbreaker, {{based on the novel}} by Anthony Horowitz. He was one of 500 who auditioned for the role. Pettyfer chose to appear in the film over a role in the film Eragon, noting that he preferred Stormbreaker because it would be filmed in Britain, in the Isle of Man, while Eragon would film in Hungary; Pettyfer is afraid of flying, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>liked</b> the looks of the cast for Stormbreaker. Stormbreaker was released on 21 July 2006 in the United Kingdom, on 6 October 2006 in the United States and on 21 September 2006 in Australia.|$|E
25|$|Brighton's {{transformation}} from fishing village to high-class, fashionable spa town and resort {{happened in the}} second half of the 18th century and was prompted by several factors. Sea-bathing and drinking seawater became an upper-class fad, encouraged by the publication in 1750 of local doctor Richard Russell's book on the subject. The good climate—sunny, mild and breezy—also became widely known when Brighton's first guidebook was published by Anthony Relhan in 1761. Road improvements encouraged visitors from London and elsewhere: the road from London to Brighton, notorious for its poor (sometimes impassable) condition, was turnpiked throughout its length in 1770. The arrival of royalty and the effects of their patronage then gave the town such prestige that it became Britain's largest and most important seaside resort. The Duke of Cumberland lived in the town from 1779; the Prince of Wales first visited him in 1783 (although he may also have come in search of Brighton's reputed health benefits); <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>liked</b> it so much that he came back every year and eventually took up residence at the Royal Pavilion.|$|E

Audrey Williams asked Rose if her husband could sing a song for him on that moment, Rose agreed, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>liked</b> Williams' musical style.

The song's recording was commenced at ACME Recording, Long Island, California, and at Ollywood Studios, Hollywood, California, by Gamson. Kesha told Rolling Stone that Stephen was one of her favorite tracks on the album. She explained that the song stemmed from her experiences with a man that she had been [...] "stalking since [...] was 15." [...] It was written when the singer was sixteen, in collaboration with her mother. She found David Gamson to produce the song.

He noted the [...] "fascinating dynamic" [...] between Dexter and Rudy, sensing [...] "interesting psycho-sexual undercurrents" [...] developing. TV Guide Paula Paige felt that [...] "Seeing Red" [...] proved that each episode of Dexter was a constant improvement on the last. She enjoyed Dexter's manipulation by Rudy and found his solution to Paul's threats [...] "perfect". Jonathan Toomey of TV Squad wrote that he was [...] "in awe" [...] of the episode. He was particularly impressed with Dexter's choice to frame Paul rather than kill him, and a minor storyline involving Lt. María LaGuerta (Lauren Vélez) and her betrayal of her superior, Capt. Tom Matthews (Geoff Pierson).|$|E
500|$|... "Sad" [...] {{was written}} by Maroon 5's lead singer Adam Levine {{together}} with band's guitarist, Valentine.

He further stated that it was cool <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>liked</b> the chords to the verse. He later went to the studio where Levine had a concept for the song including couple of lines for the chorus. It was produced by Levine and Valentine together with Noah [...] "Mailbox" [...] Passovoy. For an interview with MTV News, Levine told that [...] "Sad" [...] is his most personal track on the album, although not revealed the inspiration behind it. The song was recorded at Conway Studios in Los Angeles by Noah Passovoy while Eric Eylands served as engineering assistant.

[...] Will Leitch of New York magazine said the episode marked a [...] "major step" [...] for the series and had some particularly sweet moments between Michael and Pam.

500|$|In 2006, {{he played}} Mark Thatcher in Coup!, a dramatisation of the {{attempted}} coup in Equatorial Guinea. He also starred as Adrien opposite Nicholas Tennant in the UK premiére of Members Only at the Trafalgar Studios. He accepted the {{part because it}} was [...] "funny, plausible, plausibly absurd and cruel" [...] <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>liked</b> {{that it was a}} translation from an original French play. He enjoyed working on it, telling What's on Stage: [...] "Nick is a really good actor and really good to work with in that you can have completely frank discussions about tiny issues and it's totally ego-free. We're all just discussing the point and not playing games with each other. It does make the working practice easier. If there's only two of you in a play, you are equally responsible – there's nobody else to blame if it goes wrong. So its a greater risk and there's no hiding". At the end of the year, he appeared opposite Richard Wilson in Whipping it Up, a play about whips in a fictional David Cameron government. To research his role, he watched more Commons debates.|$|E
500|$|Stevens {{launched}} his 50-state project in 2003 with the album Michigan and chose {{to focus on}} Illinois with this recording because [...] "it wasn't a great leap", <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>liked</b> the state because he considered it the [...] "center of gravity" [...] for the American Midwest. Before creating the album, Stevens read literature by Illinois authors Saul Bellow and Carl Sandburg, and studied immigration records and history books for the state—he made the deliberate decision to avoid current events and focused on historical themes. He also took trips through several locations in Illinois and asked friends and members of Internet chat rooms for anecdotes about their experiences in the state. Although he began work in 2004 on Oregon-themed songs and briefly considered releasing a Rhode Island 7", Stevens has since not released another album focused on a state, saying in a November 2009 interview with Paste that [...] "the whole premise was such a joke," [...] and telling Andrew Purcell of The Guardian in October 2009 [...] "I have no qualms about admitting [...] was a promotional gimmick." [...] An Arkansas-related song was released through NPR as [...] "The Lord God Bird" [...] and material intended for New Jersey and New York became The BQE.|$|E
500|$|In July 2008, actress Nayantara {{was signed}} {{for the female}} lead role in Paiyaa for a record salary of 1 crore. Speaking about the issue, the {{director}} admitted that {{she was one of}} his favourite actress <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>liked</b> her performance in Yaaradi Nee Mohini. He also quoted: [...] "The way her career graph shot up is intriguing. Unlike others her career progressed in reverse gear. She paired up with the superstar {{during the early years of}} her career and started accepting roles with heroes of next generation." [...] She also expressed her interest to work in the project. However, plans were made to trim the film's budget due to the economic recession, and discussions were held with Nayantara to reduce her salary. The talks resulted in failure and Nayantara left the project in December 2008. Later, she was accused of cheating the director by refusing to return an advance of 15 lakh she had taken before commencement, after walking out of the film. The director filed a complaint with the Tamil Film Producers Council, which decided to ban the actress. Subsequently, Trisha was reported to have won the role, before Tamannaah was finalised as the female lead, who was signed for 80 lakh. Later in December 2008, Milind Soman, who had last appeared in Pachaikili Muthucharam, was signed up for the main antagonist's role, a Mumbai-based don, with other minor antagonists numbering up to 18.|$|E

500|$|Costa's overall style {{allowed him}} {{to play in a}} great variety of settings. According to critic Alun Morgan, [...] "his mind was never {{cluttered}} up with thoughts of stylistic divisions. He was at home with any jazz group, provided it swung and generated a feeling of happiness". On piano, his [...] "trademark sound", remarked Ken Dryden, [...] "was the emphasis of the middle and lower registers while nearly ignoring the top two octaves". Some of Costa's more linear, right-hand playing was influenced by his listening to Bud Powell records while in the army. Costa's playing was more than just one-handed lines: during a period when the typical approach to jazz piano was to concentrate on right-hand solos while adding only basic left-hand support, Costa used both hands in creating his own vigorous sound. His piano playing on the informally recorded album Fuerst Set is typical of his style; it was later described by critic Whitney Balliett: Each improvisation resembled an excellent drum solo in its rhythmic intensity, pattern of beats, and elements of surprise. Costa liked to use octave chords in the left hand and single-note lines in the right, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>liked</b> to thunder endlessly down in the lower registers of the piano. At such times, he played chords in both hands and with stunning effect. He would let loose a staccato passage and then an impossible two-handed arpeggio, or he would deliver on-the-beat or offbeat chords – seesawing them, making them into sixty-fourth notes, somehow slurring them, and developing great drive and momentum.|$|E
500|$|Sevigny {{encountered}} young screenwriter and aspiring director Harmony Korine in Washington Square Park in New York City {{during her}} {{senior year of high}} school in 1993. The two became close friends, which resulted in her being cast in the low-budget independent film Kids (1995). Directed by Larry Clark and written by Korine, Sevigny plays a New York teenager who discovers she is HIV positive. According to Sevigny, she was originally cast in a much smaller role in the film, but ended up replacing Canadian actress Mia Kirshner. Just two days before production began, the leading role went to the then-19-year-old Sevigny, who had no professional acting experience; she said of her casting in the role, [...] "Harmony [...] just thought I was this sweet, cute girl <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>liked</b> my blonde hair." [...] Nonetheless, Kids was highly controversial; the film was given an NC-17 rating by the Motion Picture Association of America for its graphic depiction of sexuality and recreational substance and drug use involving teenagers. Despite its controversy, Kids was taken note of critically and commercially: respected film critic Janet Maslin considered the film a [...] "wake-up call to the modern world" [...] about the nature of the American youth in contemporary urban settings. Sevigny's performance was praised, with critics noting that she brought a tenderness to the chaotic, immoral nature of the film: [...] "Sevigny provided the warm, reflective center in this feral film". She ended up receiving an Independent Spirit Award nomination for Best Supporting Female.|$|E
500|$|Ken Tucker of Entertainment Weekly {{said that}} Madonna {{delivered}} a [...] "joyous, unironic, openhearted" [...] show {{rather than a}} cautious performance. According to Tucker, the singer was in [...] "full command"; although the visuals lacked flow, the song transitions meshed [...] "perfectly". Neil McCormick of The Daily Telegraph called the show a [...] "tribute to Madonna" [...] and a [...] "shameless" [...] promotion of the singer's return to the music scene after directing W.E.: [...] "The message [...] {{is that she is}} back in business. I suspect she’d settle for a global number one over global harmony". Troy Patterson of Slate wrote that Madonna retained her [...] "greatest marketing agent" [...] title with the show and praised its costumes, sets and the singer's repeated self-referencing. Linda Holmes of NPR said, [...] "What's curious, given how much 'ewww, she's too old' stuff went around on Twitter, is that everything she did Sunday night is exactly what it should mean to age gracefully". Miriam Coleman of Rolling Stone called the show a [...] "serious spectacle", and Mario Tarradell of The Dallas Morning News called it a [...] "high-concept music video": [...] "Madonna brilliantly manipulates the combined impact of visuals and sonics. The 13-minute performance was an eye-popping marvel". A Huffington Post reviewer wrote, [...] "Love her or hate her, there's no doubt that only Madonna can bring a certain level of pop flair to a performance". Spencer Kornhaber of The Atlantic praised the show's choreography and cinematography: [...] "With so, so much to look at, Madonna remained the center of attention. That is, until the end, when white light and smoke engulfed her and she dropped down through the stage, out of sight".
