5|$|Perl {{also takes}} {{features}} from shell programming. <b>All</b> <b>variables</b> are marked with leading sigils, which allow variables to be interpolated directly into strings. However, unlike the shell, Perl uses sigils on all accesses to variables, and unlike most other programming languages that use sigils, the sigil doesn't denote {{the type of}} the variable but the type of the expression. So for example, to access a list of values in a hash, the sigil for an array ("@") is used, not the sigil for a hash ("%").|$|E

25|$|In a 1997 study, economists Francine Blau and Lawrence Kahn took a set {{of human}} capital {{variables}} such as education, labor market experience, and race into account and additionally controlled for occupation, industry, and unionism. While the gender wage gap was considerably smaller when <b>all</b> <b>variables</b> were taken into account, {{a substantial portion of}} the pay gap (12%) remained unexplained.|$|E
25|$|Taking x = 2 in {{the third}} law above shows {{that it is not}} an {{ordinary}} algebra law, since 2×2 = 4. The remaining five laws can be falsified in ordinary algebra by taking <b>all</b> <b>variables</b> to be 1, for example in Absorption Law 1 the left hand side would be 1(1+1) = 2 while the right hand side would be 1, and so on.|$|E

25|$|Given some {{algebraic}} structure, {{an identity}} is an equation in which <b>all</b> <b>variables</b> are tacitly universally quantified, {{and in which}} all operations are among the primitive operations proper to the structure. Algebraic structures axiomatized solely by identities are called varieties. Many standard results in universal algebra hold only for varieties. Quasigroups are varieties if left and right division are taken as primitive.|$|E
25|$|This is {{the briefest}} {{sketch of the}} constructions. Note that the constructions {{are exactly the same}} in ZFC and in NFU, except for the {{difference}} in the constructions of the natural numbers: since <b>all</b> <b>variables</b> are restricted to strongly cantorian sets, {{there is no need to}} worry about stratification restrictions. Without the Axiom of Counting, it might be necessary to introduce some applications of T in a full discussion of these constructions.|$|E
25|$|These axioms are all {{first order}} statements. That is, <b>all</b> <b>variables</b> range over the natural numbers and not sets thereof, a fact even {{stronger}} than their being arithmetical. Moreover, there {{is but one}} existential quantifier, in axiom 3. Axioms 1 and 2, together with an axiom schema of induction make up the usual Peano-Dedekind definition of N. Adding to these axioms any sort of axiom schema of induction makes redundant the axioms 3, 10, and 11.|$|E

30|$|The Pearson {{correlation}} {{was used to}} measure intra-examiner reliability. The mean Pearson correlation for <b>all</b> <b>variable</b> was 0.932, and it ranged from 0.801 to 0.988, which implies a highly significant correlation between the observations (p[*]=[*]< 0.01).|$|R
25|$|Local {{functions}} can {{be defined}} {{in the body of}} another method, constructor or property’s getter and setter. Such functions have access to <b>all</b> <b>variables</b> in the enclosing scope, including parent method local variables. They are in scope for the entire method, regardless of whether they’re invoked before or after their declaration. Access modifiers (public, private, protected) cannot be used with local functions. Also they do not support function overloading. It means there cannot be two local functions in the same method with the same name even if the signatures don’t overlap. After a compilation, a local function is transformed into a private static method, but when defined it cannot be marked static.|$|E
25|$|Writing in the Java {{programming}} language {{is the primary}} way to produce code that will be deployed as byte code in a Java virtual machine (JVM); byte code compilers are also available for other languages, including Ada, JavaScript, Python, and Ruby. In addition, several languages {{have been designed to}} run natively on the JVM, including Scala, Clojure and Apache Groovy. Java syntax borrows heavily from C and C++, but object-oriented features are modeled after Smalltalk and Objective-C. Java eschews certain low-level constructs such as pointers and has a very simple memory model where every object is allocated on the heap and <b>all</b> <b>variables</b> of object types are references. Memory management is handled through integrated automatic garbage collection performed by the JVM.|$|E
25|$|The {{continuous}} interplay (exchange or trade) done {{by economic}} actors in all markets sets the prices for all {{goods and services}} which, in turn, make the rational managing of scarce resources possible. At the same time, the decisions (choices) made by the same actors, while they are pursuing their own interest, determine the level of output (production), consumption, savings, and investment, in an economy, {{as well as the}} remuneration (distribution) paid to the owners of labour (in the form of wages), capital (in the form of profits) and land (in the form of rent). Each period, as if they were in a giant feedback system, economic players influence the pricing processes and the economy, and are in turn influenced by them until a steady state (equilibrium) of <b>all</b> <b>variables</b> involved is reached or until an external shock throws the system toward a new equilibrium point. Because of the autonomous actions of rational interacting agents, the economy is a complex adaptive system.|$|E
30|$|After the ADF unit root {{test for}} <b>all</b> the <b>variables</b> {{in the whole}} sub-periods, it can be {{concluded}} that <b>all</b> the <b>variables</b> are stationary in the first-order difference and can be conducted with a co-integration test.|$|R

25|$|An {{alternative}} view is {{that the}} voltage at the top of R2 is set by the emitter current of the output transistor. That view leads to an entirely passive feedback network made up of R2 and Rf. The variable controlling the feedback is the emitter current, so the feedback is a current-controlled current source (CCCS). We search through the four available two-port networks and find the only one with a CCCS is the g-parameter two-port, shown in Figure 4. The next task is to select the g-parameters so that the two-port of Figure 4 is electrically equivalent to the L-section made up of R2 and Rf. That selection is an algebraic procedure made most simply by looking at two individual cases: the case with V1 = 0, which makes the VCVS {{on the right side of}} the two-port a short-circuit; and the case with I2 = 0. which makes the CCCS on the left side an open circuit. The algebra in these two cases is simple, much easier than solving for <b>all</b> <b>variables</b> at once. The choice of g-parameters that make the two-port and the L-section behave the same way are shown in the table below.|$|E
500|$|Krom {{writes that}} a formula is {{consistent}} if repeated {{application of this}} inference rule cannot generate both the clauses [...] and , for any variable [...] As he proves, a 2-CNF formula is satisfiable {{if and only if}} it is consistent. For, if a formula is not consistent, {{it is not possible to}} satisfy both of the two clauses [...] and [...] simultaneously. And, if it is consistent, then the formula can be extended by repeatedly adding one clause of the form [...] or [...] at a time, preserving consistency at each step, until it includes such a clause for every variable. At each of these extension steps, one of these two clauses may always be added while preserving consistency, for if not then the other clause could be generated using the inference rule. Once <b>all</b> <b>variables</b> have a clause of this form in the formula, a satisfying assignment of all of the variables may be generated by setting a variable [...] to true if the formula contains the clause [...] and setting it to false if the formula contains the clause [...]|$|E
