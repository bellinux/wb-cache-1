5|$|FBI {{special agent}} Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) goes to {{investigate}} the murder. The victim, a twenty-two-year-old backpacker, now shows signs of body decay usually associated with old age. Later, at a pay-phone, she asks her partner, John Doggett (Robert Patrick), to check the X-Files for cases mentioning glycoproteins. While discussing the case with Doggett, the bus passes her, and she follows it to a gas station {{in the middle of}} the desert. A man with an injured hand learns that she is a medical doctor <b>and</b> <b>fills</b> her car with gasoline laced with water. Scully returns to the gas station and is told that rain got into the gas canisters.|$|E
5|$|Many {{important}} biochemical reactions, such {{as energy}} generation, use concentration gradients across membranes. The {{general lack of}} internal membranes in bacteria means reactions such as electron transport occur across the cell membrane between the cytoplasm and the periplasmic space. However, in many photosynthetic bacteria the plasma membrane is highly folded <b>and</b> <b>fills</b> most of the cell with layers of light-gathering membrane. These light-gathering complexes may even form lipid-enclosed structures called chlorosomes in green sulfur bacteria. Other proteins import nutrients across the cell membrane, or expel undesired molecules from the cytoplasm.|$|E

40|$|The {{classical}} {{concept that}} mean bed elevation over an entire stream reach is lowered by scour during flood-wave passage and is restored by deposition {{in the waning}} flood phase (mean-bed scour <b>and</b> <b>fill)</b> can be challenged. The alternative that both scour <b>and</b> <b>fill</b> occur concurrently at different migrating loci within a reach (local scour <b>and</b> <b>fill)</b> is more consistent with published field data. The field and laboratory investigations reported herein suggest that mean-bed scour <b>and</b> <b>fill</b> in a uniform channel is minor compared to local scour <b>and</b> <b>fill</b> caused by bedform migration, and that maximum local scour <b>and</b> <b>fill</b> may occur on the waning flood in some instances. The field experiment, utilizing a rectilinear array of buried maximum-scour indicators (scour-cords), produced data for contouring of maximum scour <b>and</b> <b>fill</b> in an ephemeral streambed during two floods. In the first flood, 24 em of scour <b>and</b> <b>fill</b> was measured for a bankfull flow depth of 23 cm. In the second, maximum scour <b>and</b> <b>fill</b> was at least 66 cm for a bankfull flow depth of 34 cm. Estimates of antidune amplitudes for the two floods, based on theoretical models and laboratory and field observations, are 28 to 64 cm and 48 to 97 cm, respectively. This indicates that all scour <b>and</b> <b>fill</b> measured by the scour-cord array could {{have been caused by}} antidune migration. Laboratory experiments were conducted in an 18 m-long open-circuit flume with automated sediment and water input-rate controls. A series of experiments in a 26. 7 cm-wide sand-bed channel with rigid walls, at grade for a simulated flood patterned after those typical of ephemeral streams, showed that mean-bed scour <b>and</b> <b>fill</b> was less than 3 percent of local scour <b>and</b> <b>fill.</b> For these experiments, mean sand size was 0. 3 mm, channel slope was. 009, maximum water depth was 40 mm, maximum local scour <b>and</b> <b>fill</b> was 22 mm, and maximum mean-bed scour <b>and</b> <b>fill</b> was 0. 6 mm. Maximum mean bed elevation variation was thus only two sand-grain diameters. Fill occurred at peak flow followed by scour to the pre-flood mean bed elevation on the waning flood. Maximum local scour <b>and</b> <b>fill</b> took place {{near the end of the}} simulated floods, when bedform amplitudes were the greatest. A series of simulated-flood experiments in a sand-bed channel with erodible sand banks showed scour <b>and</b> <b>fill</b> behavior qualitatively similar to that of the rigid-wall channel. Bank erosion, channel meandering, and braiding prevented quantitative scour <b>and</b> <b>fill</b> measurements in these alluvial-bank experiments. Measured flow and bedform parameters <b>and</b> scour <b>and</b> <b>fill</b> data derived from small laboratory scour-chains were compatible with those estimated from the theoretical model used in the field experiment...|$|R

5|$|Splash dams, greased chutes, {{railroad}} landings, railroad {{branch lines}} and steam donkey operations {{were among the}} strategies utilized to exploit the watershed's resources of timber. Unfortunately, railroad embankments <b>and</b> <b>fills</b> used to build up tributaries had artificially straightened them in the process, and erosion increased dramatically on the barren hillside, causing many streams to become much siltier than they naturally would be. Nearly all the old-growth forest in the watershed is now gone, and the forests that remain are mostly second-growth stands.|$|E
5|$|Birds {{have one}} of the most complex {{respiratory}} systems of all animal groups. Upon inhalation, 75% of the fresh air bypasses the lungs and flows directly into a posterior air sac which extends from the lungs and connects with air spaces in the bones <b>and</b> <b>fills</b> them with air. The other 25% of the air goes directly into the lungs. When the bird exhales, the used air flows out of the lungs and the stored fresh air from the posterior air sac is simultaneously forced into the lungs. Thus, a bird's lungs receive a constant supply of fresh air during both inhalation and exhalation. Sound production is achieved using the syrinx, a muscular chamber incorporating multiple tympanic membranes which diverges from {{the lower end of the}} trachea; the trachea being elongated in some species, increasing the volume of vocalisations and the perception of the bird's size.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was the {{determination}} of the geometric structural parameters of a glass textile reinforcement, which is embedded into an epoxy polymer matrix, by micro-computed tomography (CT). Therefore, four different glass fabrics were investigated. The CT images of the composites feature a good contrast between glass reinforcement and polymer matrix. The resolution is high enough for the determination of the geometric structural parameters: wavelength of warp <b>and</b> <b>fill</b> yarn, amplitude of warp <b>and</b> <b>fill</b> yarn, width of warp <b>and</b> <b>fill</b> yarn, height of warp <b>and</b> <b>fill</b> yarn <b>and</b> the gap between two adjacent warp <b>and</b> <b>fill</b> yarns.

5|$|Leaving Lebanon, {{the line}} ascended a small gully and then headed north-northeasterly across the {{highlands}} to Dodds. The never-used grade from Dodds to Waynesville descended into the Little Miami River valley via Newman Run before turning north and ending at the latter village. Portions of the right-of-way and stone abutments for several never-built bridges remain {{on what is}} now farmland. The line as completed turned north at Dodds, and required several cuts <b>and</b> <b>fills</b> to traverse the rolling terrain. At Hempstead, just north of Hempstead Road, the line split. The original route continued north, parallel to Woodman Drive, to the old Dayton and South Eastern Railroad (now the Iron Horse Trail) at Lebanon Junction. A 1915 extension was built parallel to the ex-D, and ended at the Panhandle Route (now the Creekside Trail to the east) at Clement. Part of this line is still operated by the Norfolk Southern Railway, and to the south the right-of-way is being used for {{an extension of the}} Iron Horse Trail. The other branch headed northwesterly into downtown Dayton, steadily descending as it passed south of the University of Dayton and alongside the Great Miami River. The main passenger and freight depots were at Washington Street, which the CL passed over on the first such grade separation in Dayton. The first freight depot opened with the line in 1912, and was replaced in 1930 by a larger structure, itself torn down in 1966.|$|E
5|$|Lewis died in 1893, and in {{the next}} decade the DL built no new lines. However, a group of investors bought the company, {{including}} the Dayton terminal property, in 1901 for $250,000 from Lewis's heirs. The first segment of the line into downtown Dayton was completed in late 1902, branching off the main line at Hempstead and ending at Lambeth, site of the Dayton State Hospital. Unable to obtain a franchise from Dayton, and still unprofitable, the DL entered receivership in January 1905, and was sold at foreclosure in April 1907 and reorganized in May as the Dayton, Lebanon and Cincinnati Railroad and Terminal Company. The bondholders who had organized the new company succeeded in obtaining the franchise, and sold the stock to a new group of investors in January 1909. Construction was restarted in April, and in November the branch reached the intersection of Brown and Caldwell Streets and the National Cash Register plant. Finally, after completing the cuts <b>and</b> <b>fills</b> required along the east bank of the Great Miami River, the DL opened its new main line in 1912, to a passenger depot {{on the north side of}} Washington Street, several blocks south and west of the city's main Union Station. A freight depot was located just to the north, at Eaker Street, and just beyond was an interchange track (not part of the original line) connecting to the Cincinnati, Hamilton and Dayton Railway (B system) and, via that line, the Pittsburgh, Cincinnati, Chicago and St. Louis Railway (Panhandle Route, part of the Pennsylvania system).|$|E

40|$|Our {{theme in}} this {{dissertation}} is {{the theory of}} empty <b>and</b> <b>filled</b> intentions (leere und erfüllte Intentionen), as that theory is introduced, developed, and employed in the opening years of Husserl‘s career. The first major exposition and employment of the theory is provided by Husserl‘s Logical Investigations (Logische Untersuchungen, 1900 / 1). In chapter 1, we show how the introduction of empty <b>and</b> <b>filled</b> intentions in Investigation I arises from Husserl‘s attempt {{to understand the nature}} and function of signs. In chapter 2, we turn to Husserl‘s further exploration and use of the theory of empty <b>and</b> <b>filled</b> intentions in Investigations V and VI. To elucidate the background and development of the theory of empty <b>and</b> <b>filled</b> intentions, we turn to Philosophy of Arithmetic (Philosophie der Arithmetik, 1891). In chapters 3 and 4, we uncover a series of parallels between the theory of empty <b>and</b> <b>filled</b> intentions in Logical Investigations and the theory of ―symbolic and authentic presentations‖ (symbolische und eigentliche Vorstellungen) in Philosophy of Arithmetic. This leads us to argue that the theory of empty <b>and</b> <b>filled</b> intentions is actually a more mature version of the theory of symbolic and authentic presentations...|$|R
