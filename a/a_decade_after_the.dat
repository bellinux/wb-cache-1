5|$|The DK Rap {{is remembered}} for its {{negative}} reception. Renditions {{of the song}} later appeared in Super Smash Bros. Melee and Donkey Konga. Over <b>a</b> <b>decade</b> <b>after</b> <b>the</b> game's release, its composer said that the rap was enjoying a resurgence in popularity despite its initial unpopularity. In 2017, he composed a similar rap for Yooka-Laylee, a platform game made in homage to Rare's oeuvre.|$|E

5|$|<b>A</b> <b>decade</b> <b>after</b> <b>the</b> fact, {{during the}} second round of child abuse allegations, Jackson's lawyers would file a memo stating that the 1994 {{settlement}} was made without his consent. A later disclosure by the FBI of investigation documents compiled over nearly 20 years led Jackson's attorney to suggest that no evidence of molestation or sexual impropriety from Jackson toward minors existed. According to reports, the Department of Children and Family Services (Los Angeles County) investigated Jackson beginning in 1993 with the Chandler allegation and again in 2003. Reports show the LAPD and DCFS did not find credible evidence of abuse or sexual misconduct.|$|E

The federal district court ordered that the three students be admitted to Murphy for the 1964 school year, leading to the desegregation of Mobile County's school system.|$|E

5|$|Little {{is known}} about the {{preparations}} for the 6th Congress. It was convened <b>a</b> <b>decade</b> <b>after</b> <b>the</b> 5th WPK Congress (in 1970), outside the party norm of a quadrennial meeting. There was no official reason for its postponement, but it was probably {{due to the fact that}} WPK General Secretary Kim Il-sung spent much of the 1970s gathering support (and creating an independent power base) for his son and planned successor Kim Jong-il. In addition, a great deal of time was spent restructuring party organizations and functions. The primary reason for the 6th Congress was to formalize Kim Jong-il as Kim Il-sung's chosen successor.|$|E
5|$|Nearly <b>a</b> <b>decade</b> <b>after</b> <b>the</b> Tagora {{had ceased}} production, {{the view of}} the car in the {{automotive}} press was that it was merely average though there was little actively wrong with the car. The view was that the Tagora had the advantage of refinement, good manners and, in V6 form, good performance. Rust was identified as the single biggest problem for the surviving cars, usually around the rear suspension mountings. Buckley suggested that the car might attain collectible status by 2003.|$|E

5|$|Rare's Blast Corps began a run {{of seven}} highly lauded and {{respected}} Nintendo 64 games, including GoldenEye 007, Banjo-Kazooie, Perfect Dark, and Jet Force Gemini. Retro Gamer wrote that Rare had doubled the number of classic Nintendo 64 games and was an important alliance for Nintendo. Microsoft acquired Rare in 2002 for a record price of $377 million. The industry had changed, Blast Corps designer Martin Wakeley reflected <b>a</b> <b>decade</b> <b>after</b> <b>the</b> game's 1997 release. In 2009, Wakeley said, a studio would rarely entrust the scope of a project like Blast Corps to a team of four recent graduates.|$|E
5|$|The last {{experimental}} {{flight was}} flown in 1971, {{due to a}} lack of candidate storms and a changeover in NOAA's fleet. More than <b>a</b> <b>decade</b> <b>after</b> <b>the</b> last modification experiment, Project Stormfury was officially canceled. Although a failure in its goal of reducing the destructiveness of hurricanes, Project Stormfury was not without merit. The observational data and storm lifecycle research generated by Stormfury helped improve meteorologists' ability to forecast the movement and intensity of future hurricanes.|$|E
5|$|The move to Memphis did {{not solve}} the Grizzlies' {{financial}} problems, and as of 2011 the team's cumulative loss was US$100million.

5|$|Drowned God was {{released}} on October31, 1996 for the Windows 95 operating system. In its first two weeks, it sold 34,000copies in the United States. It {{was one of the}} top ten best-selling video games in United States during the first month after its release, but bugs and poor support from the developers caused it to fall out of favor with gamers by December. By February 1998, the game had sold over 60,000copies. Around the time of the game's release, Horse stated that its story was incomplete, and {{that the rest of the}} story would be revealed in a sequel called CULT, planned to center around Area51.

5|$|In Final Fantasy XIII-2, a 24-year-old Hope is {{leader of}} the {{scientific}} expedition group known as the Academy <b>a</b> <b>decade</b> <b>after</b> <b>the</b> events of Final Fantasy XIII. He helps Noel and Serah in their journey to find Lightning when they arrive in his time. Other than knowing that time travel is possible and wishing to undo events of the past, Hope is planning on reviving Cocoon with a different power source. Originally planning to create an artificial fal'Cie, he is dissuaded upon seeing a vision of Serah fighting his creation. He and his assistant Alyssa Zaidelle then use a time capsule to go 387 {{years into the future}} to oversee Hope's New Cocoon Project, a plan to build a man-made Cocoon in preparation for Cocoon's destined fall in the next century. When the old Cocoon does fall, Hope and Sazh manage to rescue Vanille and Fang from the crystal pillar before it crumbles.|$|E
5|$|John Kadlec of Beta Engineering {{originally}} planned {{the use of}} 8-inch HCS, which he specified could withstand 120 pounds per square foot, a load which exceeded specifications on all 8-inch HCS. During the bidding process, the owners were advised by a bidder, Precon, that the specified load could not be handled by the HCS without reinforcements from a composite concrete topping. However, Kadlec advised the owners that the plans called for 8-inch HCS which could withstand the load without reinforcement from topping. The contract was thus awarded to Coreslab, despite Coreslab's design tables indicating that the specified project loads were 38% higher than the maximum load. In 1992, over <b>a</b> <b>decade</b> <b>after</b> <b>the</b> mall's construction, Coreslab retracted the claim {{to be able to}} support the load without the use of a composite topping.|$|E

5|$|The Flushing Line west of 103rd Street {{opened in}} 1917. The IRT agreed {{to operate the}} line under the {{condition}} that any loss of profits would be repaid by the city.

The station, as well as two other stations at Willets Point Boulevard and 111th Street, was approved in 1921 as part of an extension of the Flushing Line past 103rd Street. Construction of the station and the double-deck bridge over the Flushing Creek began on April 21, 1923, with the station built via cut-and-cover methods. The bridge was completed in 1927, and the station opened on January 21, 1928, over <b>a</b> <b>decade</b> <b>after</b> <b>the</b> line initially began operation.|$|E
5|$|The Republicans {{nominated}} John Marshall Harlan, who {{had served}} in the Union Army. In joint debates across the state, McCreary stressed what many Kentuckians felt were abuses of power by Republican President Ulysses S. Grant during the Reconstruction Era. Harlan countered by faulting the state's Democratic politicians for continuing to dwell on war issues almost <b>a</b> <b>decade</b> <b>after</b> <b>the</b> war's end. He also attacked what he perceived as Democratic financial extravagance and the high number of pardons granted by sitting Democratic governor Preston Leslie. Harlan claimed these as evidence of widespread corruption in the Democratic Party. McCreary received solid support from the state's newspapers, nearly all of which had Democratic sympathies. Despite a late infusion of cash and stump speakers in favor of his opponent, McCreary won the general election by a vote of 130,026 to 94,236.|$|E
