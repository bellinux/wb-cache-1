Such lack of uniformity of response causes many difficulties in the interpretation of biological data. This has resulted in the development, in recent years, of special techniques for obtaining and analyzing experimental results.

While some statistical techniques have long been recognized as valuable in the reduction of large masses of data to comprehensible form, it has been only recently that exact methods of treating small numbers of observations have been worked out.

In this paper, the model of MSM (Maize Simulation Model) was calibrated and validated for the prediction of maize forage production at Agricultural College, Shiraz University in 1382 and 1383 by using maize forage yield under furrow irrigation with four irrigation and three nitrogen treatments. Irrigation treatments were I 4, I 3, I 2, and I 1, with the depth of water 20 % greater than, equal to, 20 % and 40 % less than potential crop water requirements, respectively.

40|$|AbstractPerennial crops {{can be used}} as {{renewable}} resource but only rare information concerning their site-specific biomass production are available. Also, their yield stability as well as the quality of the produced biomass, whether for energetic or material utilisation, is relatively unknown. Perennial crops offer several ecological benefits such as protection of soil and waterbodies, long flowering and cover for wild animals during winter. Most of these crops have a high yield potential and are – after planting and establishing is completed – labour efficient to cultivate. Concerning climate change and the presumed higher risk of extreme weather conditions, perennial crops might be a good supplement to common annual crops. The aim of a Bavarian project, started 2014, is to evaluate several perennial crops at six Bavarian sites with varying soils and climatic conditions. Cup plant (Silphium perfoliatum), sida (Sida hermaphrodita), tall wheatgrass (Agropyron elongatum), switchgrass (Panicum virgatum) and miscanthus (Miscanthus x giganteus) are cultivated in field trials in 100 m 2 plots and four replications. The annual crops maize and rye are similarly grown as references. Besides plant development and yield measurement, the potential methane yield and/or fuel properties will be determined to assess the quality and suitability of these crops for different usages. Trials concerning cultivation techniques and weed control complement the <b>agricultural</b> <b>investigations.</b> Ecological aspects of perennial cropping will be evaluated by measuring carbon levels in the soil as well as stocking rates of earthworms used as indicator for changes in soil biota as a result of perennial crop cultivation. Yield and quality results from foregoing trials for the various crops and first data of the now started field trials will be presented.

40|$|This thesis {{explores the}} use of {{fluorescent}} tracers to monitor the redistribution of soil at high temporal and spatial resolutions. Soil redistribution happens on a second by second basis with individual particles moving millimetres at a time. There are few, if any, existing tracing methods which permit the monitoring of soil movements at temporal and spatial scales that are commensurate with the scales at which these movements happen. This thesis charts {{the development of new}} tracing technologies that allow for the movement of soil to be monitored at high spatial and temporal resolution, resolutions which are commensurate with the movement of individual particles. This will allow for deeper insight into how soil moves and has a range of applications for fundamental soil movement studies to applied <b>agricultural</b> <b>investigations.</b> In order to study the movement of clay a novel fluorescent clay tracer was created along with fluorescent imaging techniques which allowed for the movement of this tracer to be captured. The movement of larger soil particles is also important and by using a commercially available fluorescent tracer combined with fluorescent videography it was possible to track the movement of individual soil particles across a soil surface during a simulated rainfall event. The movement of these particles was captured 50 times a second with sub-mm precision. A similar system was then developed for use in the field environment and was demonstrated at field scale by monitoring the redistribution of a tracer across a soil surface as a result of tillage. It was also possible to monitor the vertical redistribution of the tracer within the soil profile by digging soil pits. The methods detailed here show {{that it is possible to}} gain much information about the redistribution (i. e. change in location) of soil across a soil surface without the inconvenience, expense and system perturbation that is caused by traditional sampling. Overall these methods demonstrate that it is possible for soil tracing to operate in a data rich environment providing new opportunities to develop, parameterise and evaluate soil movement models...|$|E

Remotely sensed images facilitate a diverse array of non-intrusive <b>agricultural</b> <b>investigations</b> including new approaches such as high-throughput phenotyping. This research examines the variability of surface reflectance and estimates two biophysical parameters associated with crops. ^ The first goal of the project was to provide an estimation of reflectance variability within low-resolution satellite imagery. The quantified variability of intra-pixel spectral reflectance can then be used to determine the level of uncertainty in estimating biophysical characteristics of plants. The study revealed how the variability in a composite spectral signal emanating from a large pixel was influenced by crop type, phenological stage, and irrigation method. ^ A second goal {{of this study was to}} examine algorithms developed using multi-temporal airborne hyperspectal imagery for estimation and mapping of canopy Chl content in irrigated and rainfed maize and soybean fields. The optimal spectral range for two conceptual models, Chlorophyll Index and Normalized Difference, were determined and calibrated for the spectral bands of AISA, Sentinel- 2 MSI and Sentinel- 3 OLCI sensors. The results showed that CI red edge model derived solely from airborne imagery was capable of accurately estimating canopy Chl in fields with different crop management practices, field history and climatic conditions. The spatial and temporal dynamics of canopy Chl content were elucidated for maize and soybean fields at different phenological stages and rainfall regimes. ^ The final goal of this study was to evaluate the performance of several vegetation indices for estimating green leaf biomass (GLB) in maize and soybean fields using canopy reflectance collected at close-range and airborne imagery. It was determined that models containing red edge and near-infrared bands were capable of accurately predicting GLB in maize and soybean where estimations could be done across a wide range of GLB including moderate-to-high biomass. The red edge WDRVI 0. 2, at Sentinel- 2 MSI band 6, appeared to be non-species-specific and the most accurate index for estimation of GLB in both crops. ^ The findings pertaining to the estimation of crop biophysical properties can be used to support the advancement of plant phenotyping. ...|$|E

The development of internet and the {{information and communication technologies}} (TIC) has open a range of possibilities to the digital document production related to virtual university libraries, which guarantee the access to the scientific investigation and therefore to the knowledge in the actual global society. This work analyzed the changes accomplished in the Spanish university politics regarding the preservation, diffusion and access of the defended Theses in every Spanish university; the steps taken to manage it; ongoing projects focus in allowing access to this non-conventional literature; and the reasons why all these changes should be legitimated in every country.

The first approach to answering this question is to verify if different weather stations that are geographically close to each others, show elevation trends starting at the same time, possible related to global radiative forcing. However, if these trends start at quite different period among the several weather stations, the elimination of local radiative forcing as the main responsible for this trend is not possible. The aim of this work was to detect continuous trends in annual minimum air temperature series of six weather stations of the State of São Paulo, Brazil. The initial date of those trends was also evaluated. The series were fitted to the normal distribution. The Mann-Kendall test did not detected elevation trends starting at the same time among the analyzed series. Thus, local radiative forcing seems to be a more important factor, responsible for the average increase of the meteorological variable under investigation, than global radiative forcing.
