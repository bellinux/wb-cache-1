5|$|William Herschel was {{the first}} {{astronomer}} to attempt to determine the distribution of stars in the sky. During the 1780s he established a series of gauges in 600 directions <b>and</b> <b>counted</b> the stars observed along each line of sight.

40|$|Previous {{research}} suggests that block adding, subtracting <b>and</b> <b>counting</b> direction are early forms of number-space mapping. In this study, an embodiment perspective on these skills was taken. Embodiment theory assumes that cognition emerges through sensory-motor interaction with the environment. In line with this assumption, it was investigated if <b>counting</b> <b>and</b> adding/subtracting direction in young children {{is related to the}} hand they use during task performance. Forty-eight 3. 5 -year-old children completed a block adding, subtracting <b>and</b> <b>counting</b> task. They had to add and remove a block from a row of three blocks <b>and</b> <b>count</b> a row of five blocks. Adding, subtracting <b>and</b> <b>counting</b> direction were related to the hand the children used for task performance. Most children who used their right hand added, removed <b>and</b> started <b>counting</b> the blocks at {{the right side of the}} row. Most children who used their left hand added, removed <b>and</b> started <b>counting</b> the blocks at the left side of the row. It can be concluded that number-space mapping, as measured by direction of adding, subtracting <b>and</b> <b>counting</b> blocks, in young children is embodied: It is not fixed, but is related to the situation...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{proposes a}} method for {{detecting}} errors concerning article usage and singular/plural usage based on the mass count distinction. Although the mass count distinction is particularly important in detecting these errors, it has been pointed {{out that it is}} hard to make heuristic rules for distinguishing mass <b>and</b> <b>count</b> nouns. To solve the problem, first, instances of mass <b>and</b> <b>count</b> nouns are automatically collected from a corpus exploiting surface information in the proposed method. Then, words surrounding the mass (count) instances are weighted based on their frequencies. Finally, the weighted words are used for distinguishing mass <b>and</b> <b>count</b> nouns. After distinguishing mass <b>and</b> <b>count</b> nouns, the above errors can be detected by some heuristic rules. Experiments show that the proposed method distinguishes mass <b>and</b> <b>count</b> nouns in the writing of Japanese learners of English with an accuracy of 93 % and that 65 % of article errors are detected with a precision of 70 %. ...|$|R
5|$|Although {{initially}} Paskevich {{opposed the}} idea of an all-out assault of the city, the actions of Ramorino and Łubieński forced his hand. His force was low on provisions and supplies: by early September the main Russian force had only 5 days' worth of food and horse fodder. On 28 August Paskevich accepted some of his generals' advice, and ordered preparations for a general attack. After several days of quarrels within the Russian staff, it was decided on 4 September that the main thrust should be aimed at the strongest Polish positions behind the suburb of Wola. The assault was to focus on the central rampart in Wola, Fort 56, and the surrounding fortifications. The Russian I Infantry Corps was to storm Fort 57 and continue towards Forts 56 and 58. The II Infantry Corps was to focus on nearby Forts 54 and 55. Other sectors of the front were to be only lightly pressed by diversionary attacks. Paskevich probably did not want to enter Warsaw, <b>and</b> <b>counted</b> on the Polish defenders to abandon the city or surrender once the outer ring of defences was pierced and the city centre was threatened with fire.|$|E
5|$|As late as 13:35 the German 352nd {{division}} was {{reporting that the}} assault had been hurled back into the sea. From the German vantage point at Pointe de la Percée, overlooking the whole beach from the western end, {{it seemed that the}} assault had been stopped at the beach. An officer there noted that troops were seeking cover behind obstacles, <b>and</b> <b>counted</b> ten tanks burning. By 07:35, the third battalion of the 726th Grenadier Regiment, defending Draw F-1 on Fox Green beach, was reporting that 100–200 American troops had penetrated the front, with troops inside the wire at WN-62 and WN-61 attacking the Germans from the rear. Casualties among the defenders were mounting. While the 916th regiment, defending the center of the 352nd zone, was reporting that the landings had been frustrated, it was also requesting reinforcements. The request could not be met, because the situation elsewhere in Normandy was becoming more urgent for the defenders. The reserve regiment, the 915th of the 352nd division, which had earlier been ordered against the American airborne landings to the west of Omaha, was diverted to the Gold zone east of Omaha, the defenses there having crumbled.|$|E

The Inn was home to many important barristers and politicians, most notably Francis Bacon, <b>and</b> <b>counted</b> Elizabeth herself as a patron. Thanks to the efforts of prominent members such as William Cecil and Gilbert Gerard, Gray's Inn became the largest of the four by number, with over 200 barristers recorded as members.

5|$|In 2004–05, {{researchers}} from Dubna and Livermore identified a new dubnium isotope, 268Db, as a fivefold alpha decay {{product of the}} newly created element 115. This new isotope proved to be long-lived enough to allow chemical experimentation. In the 2004 experiment, a thin layer {{was removed from the}} surface of the target (with dubnium on it), dissolved in aqua regia with tracers and lanthanum carrier, from which precipitated various +3, +4, and +5 species on adding ammonium hydroxide. The precipitate was washed and dissolved in hydrochloric acid, in which it was converted to nitrate form then dried on a film <b>and</b> <b>counted.</b> It mostly contained a +5 species, which was immediately assigned to dubnium, but also a +4 species; based on that result, the team decided that additional chemical separation was needed. In 2005, the experiment was repeated, with the final product being hydroxide rather than nitrate precipitate, which was processed further at both Livermore (based on reverse phase chromatography) and Dubna (based on anion exchange chromatography). The +5 species was effectively isolated; dubnium in that experiment appeared three times in tantalum-only fractions and not even once in niobium-only fractions. However, it was noted that these experiments were insufficient to draw conclusions about the general chemical profile of dubnium.|$|E

Afterwards, Scherger began to restore order and launched a Hudson light bomber on a reconnaissance mission, though there was no further contact with Japanese forces.|$|E
