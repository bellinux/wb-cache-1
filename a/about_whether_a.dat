5|$|In {{the case}} of ministerial discretion, it has been {{established}} in Carltona Ltd. v. Commissioner of Works (1943) that it is not unlawful for a civil servant to take a decision on behalf of the minister, even where a statute confers discretion on a minister. Parliament will expect only that the power is to be exercised by an appropriate official. However, the minister is ultimately responsible for decisions taken on his or her behalf. While there has been discussion in case law <b>about</b> <b>whether</b> <b>a</b> minister should be required to personally exercise discretion in decisions that affect a person's liberty, the courts have usually been reluctant to hold so. Such a requirement, however, has been made by way of statutes which require the minister to act personally.|$|E
5|$|After World War II, {{a debate}} <b>about</b> <b>whether</b> <b>a</b> country should {{introduce}} financial planning to develop itself or rely on private entrepreneurs emerged. Nurkse {{believed that the}} subject of who should promote development does not concern economists. It is an administrative problem. The crucial idea was that {{a large amount of}} well dispersed investment should be made in the economy, so that the market size expands and leads to higher productivity levels, increasing returns to scale and eventually the development of the country in question. However, {{it should be noted that}} most economists who favoured the balanced growth hypothesis believed that only the state has the capacity to take on the kind of heavy investments the theory propagates. Further, the gestation period of such lumpy investments is usually long and private sector entrepreneurs do not normally undertake such high risks.|$|E
5|$|At {{a meeting}} of the S-1 Executive Committee on 14 November 1942, Chadwick had {{expressed}} a fear that the alpha particles emitted by plutonium could produce neutrons in light elements present as impurities, which in turn would produce fission in the plutonium and cause a predetonation, a chain reaction before the core was fully assembled. This had been considered by Oppenheimer and Seaborg the month before, and the latter had calculated that neutron emitters like boron had to be restricted to one part in a hundred billion. There was some doubt <b>about</b> <b>whether</b> <b>a</b> chemical process could be developed that could ensure this level of purity, and Chadwick brought the matter to the S-1 Executive Committee's attention for it to be considered further. Four days later, though, Lawrence, Oppenheimer, Compton and McMillan reported to Conant that they had confidence that the exacting purity requirement could be met.|$|E
50|$|For example, {{courts of}} law make judgments, without {{bringing}} in metaphysics, <b>about</b> <b>whether</b> <b>an</b> individual was acting {{of their own}} free will in specific circumstances. It is assumed {{in a court of}} law that someone could have done otherwise than they did—otherwise no crime would have been committed.|$|R

5|$|Moakes has {{indicated}} that there was no worry <b>about</b> <b>whether</b> <b>a</b> song could be recreated live in concert {{in the same way as}} it would appear on record. A brass section and a chamber choir were hired as additional musicians. Drum machines and distorted guitars were used more extensively than in Bloc Party's previous works to create a sense of manipulation to the basic rock palette. Drummer Matt Tong was initially sceptical of moulding songs with programmed drums, as opposed to using his physical output, but agreed to the idea when the band recorded some of the tracks in their entirety. On some songs, the guitars were disregarded and the band focused solely on the beat. Okereke's voice was often used as an instrument by being looped, vocoded, or run through effects pedals.|$|E
5|$|The {{failure of}} Vajpayee's {{moderate}} strategy {{led to a}} shift in the ideology of the party toward a policy of more hardline Hindu nationalism. In 1984, Advani was appointed president of the party, and under him it became the political voice of the Ram Janmabhoomi movement. In the early 1980s, the Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP) began a campaign {{for the construction of a}} temple dedicated to the Hindu deity Rama at the site of the Babri mosque in Ayodhya. The mosque had been constructed by the Mughal Emperor Babur in 1527. There is a dispute <b>about</b> <b>whether</b> <b>a</b> temple once stood there. The agitation was on the basis of the belief that the site was the birthplace of Rama, and that a temple had been demolished to construct the mosque. The BJP threw its support behind this campaign, and made it a part of their election platform. It won 86 Lok Sabha seats in 1989, a tally which made its support crucial to the National Front government of V. P. Singh.|$|E
5|$|After the British had {{departed}} Tug Argan, the Italians swiftly began {{to bring a}} close to their operations in Somaliland. Units of the Black Watch, 2nd Battalion King's African Rifles, and the 1/2 Punjab Regiment formed a small rearguard at Barakasan, which fought gamely into the night of 17 August to buy the main force time to evacuate. The Royal Navy {{had already begun to}} evacuate military personnel from Berbera on 16 August, operations that were not interfered with, possibly due to uncertainty <b>about</b> <b>whether</b> <b>a</b> peace treaty might be signed in the near future. By 19 August, all military forces, including the rearguard, the remainder of which had embarked late the previous day, had been evacuated by sea. An estimated 5,300–5,700 troops in total were evacuated to Aden. Italian forces, who had been held up by naval bombardment by HMS Ceres on 17 August, arrived in an empty Berbera on the 19th, effectively completing their conquest of British Somaliland. In total, Britain had suffered extremely light casualties, with 38 dead, 102 wounded, and 120 missing; however 10 artillery pieces had to be left behind and were captured by the Italians. In comparison, Italy paid dearly for the province, suffering 465 deaths and 1530 wounded.|$|E

25|$|In 1974, The Structure of Scientific Revolutions {{was ranked}} {{as the second}} most {{frequently}} used book in political science courses focused on scope and methods. In particular, Kuhn’s theory {{has been used by}} political scientists to critique behavioralism, which claims that accurate political statements must be both testable and falsifiable. The book also proved popular with political scientists embroiled in debates <b>about</b> <b>whether</b> <b>a</b> set of formulations put forth by a political scientists constituted a theory, or something else.|$|E
25|$|Later in 843, Liu Congjian died.

Under Li Deyu's advocacy, Emperor Wuzong ordered a general campaign against Liu Zhen, and in 844, under pressure from imperial troops, Liu Zhen's subordinate Guo Yi (郭誼) killed Liu Zhen and surrendered.|$|E
25|$|Colin McGinn {{argues that}} the Chinese room {{provides}} strong evidence that the hard problem of consciousness is fundamentally insoluble. The argument, to be clear, is not <b>about</b> <b>whether</b> <b>a</b> machine can be conscious, but about whether it (or anything else for that matter) can {{be shown to be}} conscious. It is plain that any other method of probing the occupant of a Chinese room has the same difficulties in principle as exchanging questions and answers in Chinese. It is simply not possible to divine whether a conscious agency or some clever simulation inhabits the room.|$|E

25|$|In Denmark, {{occupational}} safety and health is regulated by the Danish Act on Working Environment and cooperation at the workplace. The Danish Working Environment Authority carries out inspections of companies, draws up more detailed rules on health and safety at work and provides information on health and safety at work.

25|$|Deontological {{issues are}} issues <b>about</b> <b>whether</b> <b>a</b> person has an ethical duty or {{responsibility}} {{to take an}} action. Nearly all scholars and societies around the world agree that voluntarily donating organs to sick people is ethically permissible. Although nearly all scholars encourage organ donation, fewer scholars believe that all people are ethically required to donate their organs after death. Similarly, nearly all religions support voluntary organ donation as a charitable act of great benefit to the community, although a few small groups, like the Roma (gypsies), oppose organ donation on religious grounds. Issues surrounding patient autonomy, living wills, and guardianship make it nearly impossible for involuntary organ donation to occur.|$|E

25|$|In {{recognized}} competitions, {{all players}} {{are required to}} record all the moves of both players in order to resolve disputes <b>about</b> <b>whether</b> <b>a</b> player has made an illegal move and what the position should now be. In addition, {{if there is a}} time limit rule that requires each player to complete a specified number of moves in a specified time, as there is in most serious competition, an accurate count of the moves must be kept. All chess coaches strongly recommend the recording of one's games so that one can look for improvements in one's play. The algebraic and descriptive notations are also used in books about chess.|$|E
25|$|Most {{educational}} {{institutions in the}} U.S. are non-profit; for-profit {{colleges and universities are}} usually more expensive and academically inferior, with many cases of scams. Colleges and universities in the U.S. vary in terms of goals: some may emphasize a vocational, business, engineering or technical curriculum while others may emphasize a liberal arts curriculum. Many combine {{some or all of the}} above. Another consideration is the male-female ratio; overall, 56% of enrolled college students are women, but the male-female ratio varies by college and year and program. Admissions guidance counselors can offer views <b>about</b> <b>whether</b> <b>a</b> public or private school is best, and give a sense of the tradeoffs.|$|E
