50|$|Radical {{polymerization}} also aids {{synthesis of}} nanocomposite hydrogels. These gels {{are made of}} water-swellable nano-scale clay (especially those classed as smectites) enveloped by a network polymer. They are often biocompatible and have mechanical properties (such as flexibility and strength) that promise applications such as synthetic tissue. Synthesis involves free radical polymerization. The general synthesis procedure is depicted in Figure 28. Clay is dispersed in water, where it forms very small, porous plates. Next the initiator and a catalyst are added, followed by adding the organic monomer, generally an acrylamide or <b>acrylamide</b> <b>derivative.</b> The initiator is chosen to have stronger interaction with the clay than the organic monomer, so it preferentially adsorbs to the clay surface. The mixture and water solvent is heated to initiate polymerization. Polymers grow off the initiators that are in turn bound to the clay. Due to recombination and disproportionation reactions, growing polymer chains bind to one another, forming a strong, cross-linked network polymer, with clay particles acting as branching points for multiple polymer chain segments. Free radical polymerization used in this context allows the synthesis of polymers {{from a wide variety}} of substrates (the chemistries of suitable clays vary). Termination reactions unique to chain growth polymerization produce a material with flexibility, mechanical strength and biocompatibility.|$|E

A new phenanthrene-labeled chain transfer agent (CTA) was synthesized and used to control the RAFT polymerization of a hydrophobic <b>acrylamide</b> <b>derivative,</b> N-decylacrylamide (DcA). This first block was further used as macroCTA to polymerize N,N-diethylacrylamide (DEA) in order to prepare diblock copolymers with the same hydrophobic block of PDcA (number average molecular weight: Mn = 2720 g mol- 1, polydispersity index: Mw/Mn = 1. 13) and various PDEA blocks of several lengths (Mn = 10000 to 60000 g mol- 1) with a very high blocking efficiency.

The critical micelle concentration (CMC) was determined using the Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) between phenanthrene linked {{at the end of}} the PDcA block and anthracene added to the solution at a low concentration (10 - 5 M), based on the fact that energy transfer only occurs when phenanthrene and anthracene are located in the core of the micelle.

The investigations aim at preparation of dynamic micelles with tunable corona properties. Highly functionalized polyethylene oxide) macro-chain-transfer agents (PEO-CTAs) of two molecular weights (2 and 5 kDa) are used as mediating agents in reversible addition fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) polymerization. The synthesis is accomplished by first polymerizing n-butyl acrylate as a hydrophobic block and then chain extending the diblock copolymers further with various (meth) <b>acrylamide</b> <b>derivatives,</b> <b>acrylamide</b> (AAm), N-isopropylacrylamide (NIPAAm), N,N-diethylacrylamide (DEAAm,) and N-(2 -hydroxypropyl) methacrylamide (HPMA). Due to {{the high degree of}} functionalization of the PEO-CTA, the blocking efficiency is near quantitative and the diblock copolymers can be obtained easily {{in a wide range of}} compositions and with an excellent control of the molecular weights and polydispersities (< 1. 15). Similarly, chain extension with the different (meth) acrylamide proceeds with very high blocking efficiencies to obtain well-defined block terpolymers. The hydrophilic-to-hydrophobic balance as well as the chain lengths of the hydrophilic blocks can be adjusted as desired. The second part of this study describes the aqueous solution characteristics of the micellar aggregates of the block terpolymers. A significant effect of the preparation pathway (direct dissolution or dialysis from a common solvent) on the type of formed aggregates is found, indicating a strong influence of the dissolution kinetics. The self-assembled aggregates are of dynamic character as they can undergo fusion and fission processes, induced by both temperature and time. Large-scale rearrangement of the architectures are possible as ensured by the low glass-transition temperature of the hydrophobic block, poly(n-butyl acrylate). Depending on the hydrophilic-to-hydrophobic balance and the pair of hydrophilic end blocks employed, spherical micelles, worm-like micelles, and vesicles can be found. The corona structure of the micelles can be tuned by changing the length and type of hydrophilic polymers used. © 2008 American Chemical Society...|$|R

The central intent of many research studies in the field of NCHs conducted so far was to change hydrogel properties with the introduction of various clays and variation of the clay content. Here, we demonstrate that the properties of NCHs significantly vary depending on initiating conditions used for hydrogel synthesis via in situ polymerisation in solutions of high monomer concentrations (above 1 mol L- 1). A unique, complementary combination of real-time dynamic rheology and pulsed NMR/MRI has been used to study the influence of the composition of a redox initiating system on the gelation process and hydrogel properties. The molar ratio of the persulphate initiator to tertiary amine activator affects the polymerisation kinetics, morphology and mechanical properties of the hydrogels. We further show that activator-dominated systems tend to produce hydrogels with higher storage modulus and lower water intake. This trend is attributed to the increase in the cross-linking degree. From the analysis of the water state in NCH and hydrogels prepared with and without an organic cross-linker, it was concluded that clay platelets did not form covalent bonds with polymer molecules but contributed to the formation of a physical network. There is evidence of self-crosslinking of polymer chains during acrylamide polymerisation at high monomer concentration.

The {{research}} {{presented in}} this dissertation was concerned with the living radical polymerization (LRP) of an amphiphilic, water-soluble, bi-substituted and biologically compatible <b>acrylamide</b> <b>derivative,</b> namely n-acryloylmorpholine (NAM). The primary objective {{of this research was}} the synthesis of novel block copolymers containing poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) and various chain lengths of poly(acryloylmorpholine) (polyNAM) using a LRP technique, namely reversibleaddition fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) polymerization. This is the first report on the synthesis of these block copolymers using RAFT polymerization. These novel siloxane block copolymers were synthesized using a monohydroxyterminated PDMS material which had to first be modified into a thiocarbonylthiocontaining moiety in order for it to be used as macromolecular chain transfer agent (macroCTA) in the RAFT copolymerization with NAM. Suitable reaction conditions for the synthesis of these novel block copolymers had to, firstly, be determined, and secondly, optimized. In order to determine suitable reaction conditions, a series of homopolymerizations with NAM were first performed in order to compare which chain transfer agent (CTA), solvent, temperature etc. could possibly be best suited for the block copolymerizations of PDMS-b-polyNAM. Reported in this work is the first account of the homopolymerization of NAM and 2 -(dodecylsulfanyl) thiocarbonylsulfanyl- 2 -methyl propionic acid (DMP) as CTA using RAFT polymerization. The resulting novel siloxane block copolymers are amphiphilic in nature and the existence of these structures was confirmed by size exclusion chromatography/multiangle light scattering (SEC/MALS), proton nuclear magnetic resonance (1 H-NMR) spectroscopy, gel elution chromatography (GEC) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM).

Nevertheless, water-soluble copolymers with N,N-dimethylacrylamide (DMAAm) as a comonomer are obtained either by free radical polymerization (10 000 ≤ M n ≤ 17 500 g mol - 1; 1. 5 ≤ PDI ≤ 1. 8) or by reversible addition-fragmentation transfer (RAFT) -mediated controlled/living radical polymerization (2000 ≤ M n ≤ 5700 g mol - 1; 1. 1 ≤ PDI ≤ 1. 2). Deprotection under UV light (λ = 366 nm) at ambient temperature is followed by UV/vis monitoring of the protecting group release, which proceeds to completion between 40 min and 2 h within the studied range of concentration as demonstrated by 1 H NMR spectroscopy. Thiol-maleimide addition is subsequently carried out and found to proceed with a nearly quantitative yield (ca. 90 %) as measured by 1 H NMR.

40|$|Clostridium difficile (C. difficile) {{bacteria}} {{are the leading}} cause of nosocomial diarrhoea in the UK. The problem with the removal of C. difficile from hospitals is that it can sporulate and therefore be difficult to remove/kill using conventional methods. The spores enter the body via the faecal-oral route and in the presence of germinants (taurocholate), germinate into vegetative cells in the intestine, cause infection and produce symptoms via the release of two main toxins. The project’s aim was to produce polymeric steroid-based antimicrobial materials which will be able to germinate spores and then destroy the resulting vegetative cells. Deoxycholic acid, lithocholic acid and cholic acid were chemically manipulated to do this. Various methods were tried to attach di-amines with varying tertiary amine-based groups to the parent bile acids, with success found using ethyl chloroformate to activate the carboxylic acid group via an anhydride group, with yields up to 90 %. Once synthesised, the bile amides were screened for germinatory activity. The variables included the chain length {{and the nature of the}} groups on the tertiary amine. Once germination had been achieved the tertiary amine group was quaternized using various alkyl halides to introduce potential antimicrobial functionality. From the manipulation of the tertiary amine, several compounds were found to be germinants. Several quaternized materials also displayed antimicrobial activity. Work was undertaken to attach acryloyl groups to the 3 -OH group of chemically modified lithocholic acid, with success of then polymerising the monomer. Co-germinants are amino acids, such as glycine and alanine which assist taurocholate in the germination of C. difficile spores.

Efficiency of the photopolymerization reaction was followed by frontal affinity chromatography of 1, 2 -dihydroxybenzene (catechol) as cis-diol model solute.

The optimal conditions of use of the miniaturized boronate affinity monolithic column (μBAMC) were determined and adapted to the in-line coupling with capillary electrophoresis. Catechol was specifically preconcentrated in a pH 8. 5 phosphate buffer/MeOH (80 / 20, v/v) mixture. A volume up to 20 times the monolith volume can be percolated with a quantitative recovery yield. Three catecholamines were purified, preconcentrated and in-line separated. Elution from the μBAMC was performed with a small plug of acidic solution, allowing field amplified sample stacking of solutes within the plug before their in-line electrophoretic separation at pH 8. 75.

An interesting and promising application of azopolymer is in the fabrication and modification of topographical feature using mild conditions for cell engineering in order to provide useful substrates for controlling cellular orientation and migration. In Chapter 2, we describe the synthesis of all azopolymer brushes via RAFT technique by "grafting from" approach. RAFT polymerization is one of the finest synthetic methodologies to achieve polymers having narrow polydispersity index and high graft density. The thickness of the polymer brushes was controlled by tuning concentration of the RAFT agent immobilized on glass surface as well as polymerization time. Polymer brushes of polymethacrylic acid (pMAb) were firstly prepared and then post modified with a derivative of a well-known azobenzene (Disperse Red 1) on the side chains and a cyanine 5 dye (Cy 5) on top of the polymer brush. A comprehensive characterization of each synthesized sample is also presented. In Chapter 3 the influence of the azobenzene molecules on the polymer brush dynamics was investigated for the first time by Fluorescence Correlation Spectroscopy (FCS). For this purpose three type of azopolymer brushes were used. Two dynamics were observed, a short one coming from the fluctuation of azobenzene and a long one related to the main chain of the polymer brush, where Cy 5 was linked. Furthermore, dynamics was reversible. Thanks to FCS data, we could propose a mechanism of azobenzene dynamics that led to obtain a pattern of micrometric widths, resembling to SRG. In Chapter 4, we discuss mainly on the synthesis of a new type of azopolymer brushes, based on <b>acrylamide</b> <b>derivative</b> of Disperse red 1 as monomer, by RAFT approach. Using Lloyd's mirror method SRGs were created and the reversibility of the pattern was obtained by sonication using water at room temperature. These azopolymer brushes were conducted and biocompatibility test with NIH- 3 T 3 and HUVEC cells. These primary results foresee the possibility to use these azopolymer brushes as novel cell instructive biomaterials...|$|E
