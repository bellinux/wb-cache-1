In 17 {{of these patients}} there was a persistent release of myosin light chains lasting until the 4 th hospital day, whereas in 7 patients myosin light chains were only detectable during the initial 24 h after admission. The presence of myosin light chains correlated with signs of ischemia in the electrocardiogram (ECG) (p < 0. 05) and with the extent of coronary artery narrowing (p < 0. 05).

40|$|AbstractObjectives. This {{study was}} {{designed}} to determine the severity of coronary artery disease in patients with postprandial angina pectoris. Background. Postprandial angina is a manifestation of coronary artery disease. Although seen in clinical practice, very little has been published about the syndrome, and no anatomic correlations have been described. Methods. Questionnaires were given to 408 patients with chest pain and objective evidence of ischemia. Thirty-five patients (8. 6 %) were identified as having postprandial angina (Group A). The other 373 patients (Group B) had nonpostprandial angina and served as the control group. Coronary angiography was performed in all patients, and the results were analyzed. Results. Postprandial angina was observed predominantly in men (91 % vs. 66 %, p = 0. 0036). It was associated with a high incidence of rest angina (83 % in Group A vs. 51 % in Group B, p = 0. 0005) and a very high incidence of left main (34 % vs. 10 %, p = 0. 0001) and three-vessel (82 % vs. 54 %, p = 0. 001) coronary artery disease.

40|$|High-dosage nitrates {{are more}} {{effective}} {{for the management of}} anginal symptoms but produce more adverse effects, including development of tolerance and the zero-hour effect (rebound <b>angina</b> <b>at</b> the end of the dosing interval). Such effects may reduce the beneficial effect of treatment on quality of life. In a self-controlled, 6 -month study, the effects on symptoms and quality of life of 50 mg and 100 mg sustained-release isosorbide mononitrate (SR ISMN), administered once daily, on anginal symptoms and quality of life (QOL) were assessed in 453 patients with stable angina pectoris. QOL was assessed by means of a test battery based on the Medical Outcomes Short-Form 36 Health Survey and the Angina Pectoris Quality of Life Questionnaire. The internal consistency and reliability of the multiitem scales were estimated by use of Cronbach's alpha coefficient. Based on their improvements in New York Heart Association (NYHA) angina classification, patients who received 100 mg daily showed greater improvement than those who received 50 mg daily; the mean difference between treatments was consistent with a significantly greater improvement of mobility and angina indices. Adverse effects, as estimated by side-effect index, including rebound <b>angina</b> <b>at</b> times of <b>rest,</b> and by patient compliance rating, differed slightly between the two treatment regimens and were even less problematic with the higher dosage than with the lower dosage. Psychological distress index and life satisfaction scores also were significantly higher with 100 mg than with 50 mg daily. The {{results of this study suggest}} that SR ISMN 100 mg once daily provided a better NYHA angina classification than SR ISMN 50 mg did and did not produce further adverse effects.

40|$|The term {{coronary}} artery spasm (CAS) refers to a sudden, intense vasoconstriction of an epicardial {{coronary artery}} that causes vessel occlusion or near occlusion. Although CAS {{may be involved in}} other coronary syndromes, it represents the usual cause of variant angina. The variant form of angina was first described in 1959 by Prinzmetal et al, 1 who used this term to indicate that angina attacks, unlike {{the most common form of}} effort <b>angina,</b> occurred <b>at</b> <b>rest</b> and were associated with ST-segment elevation, rather than ST-segment depression, on the ECG (Figure 1). Because myocardial ischemia occurred in the absence of any change in myocardial oxygen demand, the authors hypothesized that it was caused by an increased tonus of vessels at the level of coronary stenoses. 1 Some years later, in fact, coronary angiography, performed during spontaneous angina attacks, demonstrated that CAS is the usual cause of variant angina. 2 4 Coronary angiography also showed that CAS could occur at the site of a stenosis (either minor or severe) or in angiographically normal coronary arteries, 5 usually at a localized segment of an epicardial artery (focal spasm) (Figure 2). 6 However, sometimes CAS involves 2 or more segments of the same (multifocal spasm) or of different (multivessel spasm) epicardial coronary arteries, or may also involve diffusely one or multiple coronary branches. 7 Careful assessment of clinical history and 24 - to 72 -hour ambulatory ECG monitoring are usually sufficient to achieve the diagnosis of variant angina, whereas the use of provocative tests of CAS (eg, intravenous ergonovine, intracoronary ergonovine, or acetylcholine administration) is required in about 10...|$|R
40|$|SUMMARY To {{investigate}} {{the events that}} lead to acute myocardial ischemia we monitored continuously the ECG, the left ventricular (four patients) or aortic (two patients) pressure and the great cardiac vein oxygen saturation (CSO 2 S) by a fiberoptic catheter in six patients with frequent anginal attacks at rest. We recorded 137 transient ischemic episodes (10 with chest pain) characterized by ST-segment elevation in 28 episodes, depression in three episodes and by pseudonormalization of previously inverted or flat T waves in 106 episodes. The onset of electrocardiographic and hemodynamic changes was preceded by a large drop in CSO 2 S in all 135 episodes with ST-T changes in the anterior leads but not in two episodes with ST elevation on inferior leads. The fall in CSOS 2, consistently followed by signs of left ventricular function impairment and never preceded by any detectable increase in the hemodynamic determinants of myocardial oxygen consumption, probably reflects a reduction in regional perfusion. Thus, a reduction in coronary flow may cause transient ischemia in patients with <b>angina</b> <b>at</b> <b>rest.</b> These episodes {{may be associated with}} variable, often minor electrocardiographic changes and occasionally with anginal pain. <b>ANGINA</b> <b>AT</b> <b>REST</b> is traditionally ascribed to the presence of critical atherosclerotic stenosis involving large coronary arteries and limiting the regional cor...|$|E

Eighty-one per cent presented concomitantly or had previously presented some other manifestations of coronary artery disease. These patients {{were divided into two}} subgroups. In subgroup 1 (40 patients), episodes of non-exertional angina were associated with a pattern of hyperacute subepicardial injury and, frequently, with ventricular arrhythmias. In subgroup 2 (55 patients), the episodes of <b>angina</b> <b>at</b> <b>rest</b> were attended by horizontal ST depression, isolated T wave inversion, or trivial ST-T changes. Coronary angiographic findings were similar in both subgroups. Symptoms regressed in only 9 % of patients in subgroup 1 while they were receiving beta-receptor antagonists, whereas amiodarone alone or amiodarone with nifedipine was successful in 58 %. Of these patients, 25 % developed a myocardial infarction shortly after admission. In subgroup 2 patients, beta-blockers were successful in 61 %.

40|$|To {{determine}} if the occurrence {{and the consequences of}} spontaneous predischarge postinfarction ischemia could be predicted early after hospital admission, a consecutive series of patients with acute myocardial infarction was studied and followed for 3 years.

Patients who died within the first 3 days were excluded from analysis. Among the 943 patients who survived at least 3 days, 165 (17. 5 %) had spontaneous ischemia before discharge. They had a higher 1 -year post-hospital mortality (16 vs. 10 %), but did not have significantly higher total 3 -year mortality rates.

40|$|Six {{decades ago}} Prinzmetal et al. (1) {{described}} a {{particular form of}} <b>angina</b> that occurred <b>at</b> <b>rest,</b> {{in the absence of}} any increase of myocardial oxygen demand, and was associated with ST-segment elevation on electrocardiography rather than with the usual ST-segment depression observed during effort angina. The investigators suggested that this variant form of angina was caused by a primary reduction of coronary blood flow consequent to an increased tonus of stenotic coronary arteries (1). Some years later, coronary angiographic studies showed that variant angina was indeed caused by coronary artery spasm (CAS) (2). Accordingly, it is now often referred as vasospastic angina (VSA). CAS is defined as a sudden, intense, reversible vasoconstriction of a coronary artery branch resulting in subtotal or total occlusion. It can occur in stenotic or angiographically normal coronary segments, can be focal or diffuse, and can involve 1 or multiple epicardial coronary arteries. VSA occurs frequently at night or in the early morning, but in some patients it prevails in the afternoon. Angina episodes may be sporadic or present in clusters and may spontaneously subside and then recur after a variable period of time.

40|$|Background. The goal of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the role of the fibrinolytic system in patients with unstable <b>angina</b> <b>at</b> <b>rest</b> associated with transient electrocardiographic changes. Methods and Results. Tissue plasminogen activator activity in plasma was comparable among patients with unstable angina (n = 17), patients with stable exertional angina (n = 10), and control patients with normal coronary arteriograms (n= 8). In contrast, plasminogen activator inhibi-tor- 1 (PAI- 1) activity in plasma was elevated in the unstable angina group (21. 67 ±+ 9. 52 AU/mi) as compared with either the stable angina group (12. 01 ±+ 7. 06 AU/mil, p< 0. 02) or the controls (12. 49 ± 8. 54 AU/mil, p< 0. 02). Coronary angiography performed within 24 hours after the last anginal episode showed a similar extent of coronary artery disease in the unstable and stable angina groups. However, intracoronary thrombi were observed in eight patients in the unstable angina group while no thrombus was noted in the stable angina group (, 2 = 7. 22, p < 0. 01). Conclusions. We conclude that patients with unstable <b>angina</b> <b>at</b> <b>rest</b> have a reduced fibrinolytic activity and an increased incidence of intracoronary thrombi.

40|$|The {{original}} publication {{is available}} at [URL] patient underwent aortocoronary saphenous bypass grafting to the left anterior descending coronary artery (LADA) and its first diagonal branch for the relief of severe angina pectoris. There was difficulty in exposure of the LADA, which was covered by {{a thick layer of}} epicardial adipose tissue. Post-operatively the patient continued to experience severe retrosternal pain which prompted early repeat coronary angiography. This revealed an aortocoronary vein fistula (AVF) secondary to the inadvertent anastomosis of one of the saphenous vein grafts to the left anterior descending coronary vein (LADV). It was only after this procedure that clinical examination revealed a grade 2 / 6 high-frequency continuous murmur best heard in the 2 nd and 3 rd left intercostal spaces. The persistance of severe <b>angina</b> pectoris <b>at</b> <b>rest</b> and on effort led to performance of revision operation. The LADV was then transected and ligated, and an extended saphenous vein reimplanted into the LADA proper. This provided complete relief from angina. This is the first such case reported in South Africa and the sixth documented. In all the aortosaphenous vein grafts had been inserted into the LADV; all exhibited the classic continuous murmur postoperatively, apart from 1 patient who had an ejection systolic murmur. None of the other 5 patients complained of postoperative angina and only 3 were subjected to revision surgery. The literature is reviewed, with emphasis on the rationale for performing the first elective aortocoronary vein anastomosis in 1968. Clinical features of iatrogenic AVF are detailed and an attempt is made to assess when re-operation is indicated. It is easy to fail to notice this complication; however, its correction can have a dramatic effect on the patient's symptoms. It is the author's belief that many more such cases exist but are not being detected, probably because of lack of appreciation of the possibility of this iatrogenic condition occurring.

40|$|The {{function}} of both {{right and left}} sides of the heart was studied during spontaneous attacks of <b>angina</b> pectoris <b>at</b> <b>rest</b> in 7 patients showing ST depression (type I) and 4 showing ST elevation (type II) during the attack. In none of the 44 type I attacks and 29 type II attacks which were recorded did circulatory changes; the latter were different in the two groups. Type I attacks showed: a) a brief fall in arterial pressure, accompanied by b) a rise of right atrial and pulmonary wedge pressures and c) a decrease of cardiac output, right and left stroke work, the mean rate of systolic ejection, and indirect left ventricular pre-ejection dP/dt. In {{the course of the}} attack a hypertensive phase followed, which was paralleled by an increase of heart rate, cardiac output, left and right stroke work, and mean systolic ejection rate, left dP/dt; right atrial pressure and wedge pressure remained raised. All of the circulatory functions started to revert towards the pre-attack levels coincident with the waning phase of the electrocardiographic alteration, the latter occurring either spontaneously or after nitroglycerin. Type II attacks for the entire duration of the electrocardiographic changes showed: a) a reduction of arterial pressure, cardiac output, right and left stroke work, mean systolic ejection rate, and left dP/dt, b) a rise of right atrial and wedge pressures, and c) quite small changes of heart rate. When the electrocardiogram started to revert to the pre-attack aspect, the cardiac function rapidly improved and, after a supernormal phase, returned to the basal levels in about 2 minutes. It is concluded: 1) that no circulatory factor interfering with the mechanical effort of the heart is responsible for eliciting spontaneous angina: 2) that in type I attacks right and left ventricular impairment occurs which recovers rapidly, possibly through a sympathetic compensation; 3) that in type II attachs dys{{function of}} both sides of the heart occurs and persists throughout the episode of electrocardiographic alteration; 4) that the dynamic impairment is probably more severe in type I than in type II angina...|$|R
