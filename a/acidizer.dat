SDA-treated silage had the highest lactic acid and acetic acid concentrations, but its DML and VBN/TN were lower than the negative control, but not significant (P＞ 0. 05). For aerobic stability, SD-treated silage were the greatest (＞ 213 h), and SDA-teated silage (＞ 147 h) were poorer than the positive control (LuproMix-treated, ＞ 187 h), but better than the negative control (118 h). 【Conclusion】Thus, addition of SD or SDA {{did not affect the}} quality of corn silage but significantly improve...|$|E
