5|$|<b>Aggressive</b> {{resemblance}} {{is used by}} predators or parasites. In special <b>aggressive</b> resemblance, {{the animal}} looks like something else, luring the prey or host to approach, for example when a flower mantis resembles {{a particular kind of}} flower, such as an orchid. In general <b>aggressive</b> resemblance, the predator or parasite blends in with the background, for example when a leopard is hard to see in long grass.|$|E
5|$|Recent {{models of}} {{economic}} defence in a group-foraging context {{predict that the}} frequency of <b>aggressive</b> interactions should decline as resource density increases. Studies with scaly-breasted munia show that the intensity of <b>aggressive</b> encounters was highest when patch location was signaled, {{and the effect of}} changing resource density depended on whether patch location was signaled or not. Signaling patch location was equivalent to making the resources more spatially predictable. Changing patch density had no effect on the number of <b>aggressive</b> encounters when the location of food was not signaled. When food location was signaled, increasing patch density resulted in the predicted {{decrease in the number of}} <b>aggressive</b> encounters.|$|E

5|$|Cure {{rates in}} {{clinical}} trials have ranged from 20–45%; although clinical trials often include only younger people and those able to tolerate <b>aggressive</b> therapies. The overall cure rate for all people with AML (including the elderly and those unable to tolerate <b>aggressive</b> therapy) is likely lower. Cure rates for promyelocytic leukemia can {{be as high as}} 98%.|$|E

5|$|In 2002, then-San Francisco Supervisor Newsom {{promoted}} the Care Not Cash program which cut county general assistance programs {{to be replaced}} with housing {{and other forms of}} service. He also promoted a 2003 ban (Proposition M: <b>Aggressive</b> Solicitation Ban) on <b>aggressive</b> panhandling which included a ban for panhandling on public transportation and near ATMs. It also prohibited repeatedly soliciting money, blocking the way, touching or following a person while soliciting, or intentionally trying to intimidate.|$|E
5|$|Melanoma is a {{malignant}} proliferation of melanocytes {{and the most}} <b>aggressive</b> type of skin cancer.|$|E
5|$|Midazolam, in {{combination}} with an antipsychotic drug, is indicated for the acute management of schizophrenia when it is associated with <b>aggressive</b> or out-of-control behaviour.|$|E
5|$|Players {{can play}} a more <b>aggressive</b> run-and-gun game by using gadgets and weapons to {{eliminate}} enemies. They can interact with environmental objects, such as ledges and zip-lines, to navigate levels. Conviction mark-and-execute system returns in Blacklist, with refinements and additions to allow players to mark several targets. When they attack, they can kill all marked targets instantly. Improvements made the system work more fluidly. A variety of enemies (including soldiers and dogs) are encountered in the game, following the protagonist and alerting their companions. Players {{have the option to}} kill them, leave them untouched, or incapacitate them, and the game classifies their choices in one of three categories: Ghost (stealthy play), Panther (stealthy, <b>aggressive</b> play), and Assault (<b>aggressive</b> play).|$|E
5|$|Potamon fluviatile is an <b>aggressive</b> species, mostly attacking {{with the}} larger right claw, since 90% of {{individuals}} are right-handed.|$|E
5|$|Sebaceous carcinoma, an {{uncommon}} and <b>aggressive</b> cutaneous tumour.|$|E
5|$|Spiders {{can also}} be the prey of <b>aggressive</b> mimics. The assassin bug Stenolemus bituberus preys on spiders, {{entering}} their web and plucking its silk threads until the spider approaches. This vibrational <b>aggressive</b> mimicry matches a general pattern of vibrations which spiders treat as prey, having a similar temporal structure and amplitude to leg and body movements of typical prey caught in the web.|$|E

5|$|The crests and frills of some dinosaurs, {{like the}} marginocephalians, theropods and lambeosaurines, {{may have been}} too fragile to be used for active defense, and so they were likely used for sexual or <b>aggressive</b> displays, though little is known about dinosaur mating and territorialism. Head wounds from bites suggest that theropods, at least, engaged in active <b>aggressive</b> confrontations.|$|E
5|$|The {{official}} {{election campaign}} began in late September 2007. The campaigns {{of the three}} front runners were based mostly on the personal appeal of the candidates, with few concrete statements about political issues. Zmago Jelinčič led an <b>aggressive</b> campaign, focusing on denouncing the three front runners, the Government, the ethnic and religious minorities, the Roman Catholic Church, and demanding an <b>aggressive</b> policy towards neighbouring Croatia.|$|E
5|$|The {{reproductive}} {{habits of}} the Sumatran rhinoceros have been studied in captivity. Sexual relationships begin with a courtship period characterized by increased vocalization, tail raising, urination, and increased physical contact, with {{both male and female}} using their snouts to bump the other in the head and genitals. The pattern of courtship is most {{similar to that of the}} black rhinoceros. Young Sumatran rhino males are often too <b>aggressive</b> with females, sometimes injuring and even killing them during the courtship. In the wild, the female could run away from an overly <b>aggressive</b> male, but in their smaller captive enclosures, they cannot; this inability to escape <b>aggressive</b> males may partly contribute to the low success rate of captive-breeding programs.|$|E
5|$|There is a three-tiered {{system for}} histologically {{classifying}} endometrial cancers, ranging from cancers with well-differentiated cells (grade I), to very poorly-differentiated cells (grade III). Grade I cancers {{are the least}} <b>aggressive</b> and have the best prognosis, while grade III tumors are the most <b>aggressive</b> and likely to recur. Grade II cancers are intermediate between grades I and III in terms of cell differentiation and aggressiveness of disease.|$|E
5|$|A {{capacity}} for <b>aggressive</b> behavior {{should not be}} overstated with the giant otter. Researchers emphasize that even between groups, conflict avoidance is generally adopted. Within groups, the animals are extremely peaceful and cooperative. Group hierarchies are not rigid and the animals easily share roles.|$|E
5|$|<b>Aggressive</b> mimicry {{is found}} in predators (or parasites) that share the same {{characteristics}} as a harmless species, allowing them to avoid detection by their prey (or host). The mimic may resemble the prey or host itself, or another organism that is either neutral or beneficial to the signal receiver. In this class of mimicry, the model may be affected negatively, positively or not at all. Just as parasites can {{be treated as a}} form of predator, host-parasite mimicry is treated here as a subclass of <b>aggressive</b> mimicry.|$|E
5|$|Agonistic {{behaviour}} typically {{consists of}} squabbles between individuals climbing over or passing each other. This occasionally involves biting. Males that are strangers may wrestle, chase, and bite each other. In extreme situations, a male {{may try to}} displace a smaller rival from a tree. This involves the larger aggressor climbing up and attempting to corner the victim, which tries either to rush past him and climb down or {{to move to the}} end of a branch. The aggressor attacks by grasping the target by the shoulders and repeatedly biting him. Once the weaker individual is driven away, the victor bellows and marks the tree. Pregnant and lactating females are particularly <b>aggressive</b> and attack individuals that come too close. In general, however, koalas tend to avoid energy-wasting <b>aggressive</b> behaviour.|$|E
5|$|Although {{he was a}} hard-driving, <b>aggressive</b> panzer {{commander}} {{early in}} the war, Model became {{best known as a}} practitioner of defensive warfare. His success {{at the head of the}} Ninth Army in the defensive battles of 1941–42 determined his future career path.|$|E
5|$|Amplexus {{lasts for}} 10 to 15 minutes. Once mated, the males will defend the females {{for a short}} period (around 15 minutes). After this period, the females begin to exhibit <b>aggressive</b> {{behavior}} and will drive off the males. They will then bend their fourth and fifth pereonites at a 90-degree angle. Once their genital openings (located on the fifth pereonite) are aligned {{with the opening of the}} brood pouches, they quickly deposit fertilized eggs into them. Females carrying fertilized eggs remain highly <b>aggressive</b> towards males throughout the brooding period, indicating maternal behavior intended to protect the developing embryo from male aggression.|$|E
5|$|Another <b>aggressive</b> mimic of the cleaner wrasse, the bluestriped fangblenny, {{has evolved}} an opioid-containing venom which dulls pain and lowers blood pressure, {{confusing}} the bitten host {{and giving the}} cheating mimic time to escape.|$|E
5|$|Arsenal faced Blackburn Rovers in the semi-final {{which was}} played on 16 April 2005. Two goals from Van Persie {{and one from}} Pirès gave Arsenal a 3–0 win, in a match marred by Blackburn's <b>aggressive</b> tactics.|$|E
5|$|Bedell-Sivright had a {{reputation}} as an <b>aggressive</b> and hard rugby player, as well as a ferocious competitor. He was an inaugural inductee into the Scottish Rugby Hall of Fame, and in 2013 was inducted into the International Rugby Board (IRB) Hall of Fame.|$|E
5|$|CS {{is used in}} spray form by many {{police forces}} as a {{temporary}} incapacitant and to subdue attackers or persons who are violently <b>aggressive.</b> Officers who are trained in the use and application of CS spray are routinely exposed to {{it as part of}} their training.|$|E
5|$|Certain planes feature <b>aggressive,</b> multi-segmented {{creatures that}} perish {{when all of}} their {{segments}} are eaten by the player's creature; however, they can eat segments of the player's creature to regrow their own. These creatures release many cells upon death, which can restore {{the health of the}} player's creature, temporarily increase the size of its mouth, or cause it to sprout decorative protrusions. Players are not required to eat these or any other organisms; they may travel to higher or lower planes at any time. Being defeated by <b>aggressive</b> creatures does not result in death, but causes the player's creature to float to a higher plane. In the Flash version, the player can replay the game with a jellyfish-like organism by defeating an <b>aggressive</b> creature on the bottom plane. If the player reaches the bottom again, the creature there is their original worm-like creature, and defeating it starts the game over as that organism.|$|E
5|$|Complicated UTIs {{are more}} {{difficult}} to treat and usually requires more <b>aggressive</b> evaluation, treatment and follow-up. It may require identifying and addressing the underlying complication. Increasing antibiotic resistance is causing concern about the future of treating those with complicated and recurrent UTI.|$|E
5|$|Cuban iguanas reach sexual {{maturity}} {{at an age}} of two to three years. Males are gregarious when immature, but become more <b>aggressive</b> as they age, vigorously defending territories in competition for females. Females are more tolerant of each other, except after laying their eggs.|$|E
5|$|DAAS {{are known}} for their <b>aggressive,</b> provocative style; their habit of {{involving}} audience members and their tendency to attack topical and sometimes controversial issues in their comedy.|$|E
5|$|David Andrew Lace (born David Andrew Williams on 2 September 1962, Portsmouth) {{had spent}} a {{significant}} amount of his life in care or boy's homes and hostels and was considered a loner with an <b>aggressive</b> temper. He changed his surname when he was adopted by the Lace family as a child.|$|E
5|$|Despite being quadrupedal the {{ring-tailed lemur}} can rear up and balance {{on its hind}} legs, usually for <b>aggressive</b> displays. When {{threatened}} the ring-tailed lemur may jump {{in the air and}} strike out with its short nails and sharp upper canine teeth in a behaviour termed jump fighting. This is extremely rare outside of the breeding season when tensions are high and competition for mates is intense. Other <b>aggressive</b> behaviours include a threat-stare, used to intimidate or start a fight, and a submissive gesture known as pulled-back lips.|$|E
5|$|Due to its slow movements, the addax is an {{easy target}} for predators such as lions, humans, African hunting dogs, cheetahs and leopards. Caracals, hyenas and servals attack calves. The addax are {{normally}} not <b>aggressive,</b> though individuals may charge if they are disturbed.|$|E
