2500|$|Although the Colts {{made the}} playoffs for three {{straight}} years from 1975 to 1977, there had still been no progress made on a new park for the team.

In 1976, he acknowledged publicly that he had received an [...] "attractive offer" [...] to move the franchise to Phoenix, Arizona. Then, in 1977, he said, [...] "I like Baltimore and want to stay there, but {{when are we going to}} find out something about our stadium? I'm getting offers from towns like Indianapolis to build me a new stadium and give me other inducements to move there. I dont want to but I'd like to see some action in Baltimore." [...] In 1979, Hoffberger sold the Orioles to Washington D.C. attorney Edward Bennett Williams, who declared 1980 to be a trial year for the fans of Baltimore. He then went on to explain his concerns with Memorial Stadium, saying it had [...] "inadequate parking and inadequate <b>access</b> <b>and</b> <b>egress.</b> Frankly, I don't know if those problems will ever be solvable at that location." [...] Irsay began shopping the Colts around in earnest, talking first to officials from the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum Commission, Memphis, Tennessee, and Jacksonville, Florida where he visited the Gator Bowl packed with 50,000 cheering fans trying to convince him that Jacksonville would be the best home for the Colts. That same year Irsay presented Maryland's Governor Harry Hughes with a request for $25 million in renovation to the 64,124 seat Memorial Stadium. Irsay's request for $25 million in improvements was decreased to $23 million by the Maryland legislature. The plan added more seats (but none of the revenue-generating skyboxes), improving the plumbing and would have given both teams better office space. The plan's approval was contingent on both the Colts and Baltimore Orioles signing long term leases. The Orioles challenged the requested football improvements and refused to sign anything more than a one-year lease. Irsay also refused to sign long term. As a result, the funds and improvements never came.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{photosynthetic}} {{conversion of}} water to molecular oxygen is catalyzed by the Mn 4 CaO 5 cluster in Photosystem II and provides nearly our entire supply of atmospheric oxygen. The Mn 4 CaO 5 cluster accumulates oxidizing equivalents in response to light-driven photochemical events within Photosystem II and then oxidizes two molecules {{of water to}} oxygen. The Mn 4 CaO 5 cluster converts water to oxygen much more efficiently than any synthetic catalyst because its protein environment carefully controls the cluster's reactivity at each step in its catalytic cycle. This control is achieved by precise choreography of the proton and electron transfer reactions associated with water oxidation and by careful management of substrate (water) <b>access</b> <b>and</b> proton <b>egress.</b> This review describes the FTIR studies undertaken {{over the past two}} decades to identify the amino acid residues that are responsible for this control and to determine the role of each. In particular, this review describes the FTIR studies undertaken to characterize the influence of the cluster's metal ligands on its activity, to delineate the proton egress pathways that link the Mn 4 CaO 5 cluster with the thylakoid lumen, and to characterize the influence of specific residues on the water molecules that serve as substrate or as participants in the networks of hydrogen bonds that make up the water <b>access</b> <b>and</b> proton <b>egress</b> pathways. This information will improve our understanding of water oxidation by the Mn 4 CaO 5 catalyst in Photosystem II and will provide insight into the design of new generations of synthetic catalysts that convert sunlight into useful forms of storable energy.

40|$|The muscarinic toxin MT 7 is {{the most}} {{selective}} ligand for the muscarinic M(1) receptors. Previous {{studies have shown that}} the toxin interacts with the antagonist-receptor complex and slows the antagonist dissociation rate, possibly by binding to an allosteric site <b>and</b> impeding the <b>access</b> to <b>and</b> <b>egress</b> from the orthosteric binding pocket. In the present study, we investigated the action of MT 7 on agonist-occupied receptors in functional and radioligand binding assays of the cloned human muscarinic M(1) receptor expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells. In time-course experiments, the addition of MT 7 rapidly blocked the acetylcholine-stimulated guanosine- 5 '-O-(3 -[(35) S]thio) triphosphate binding to membrane G proteins. Similarly, in acetylcholine-treated cells MT 7 completely stopped the agonist-stimulated [(3) H]inositol phosphate accumulation. In dissociation experiments using membranes pre-equilibrated with [(3) H]acetylcholine, the addition of MT 7 increased the rate of radioligand dissociation. The data indicate that MT 7, while partially stabilizing the antagonist-receptor complex, effectively destabilizes the agonist-occupied muscarinic M(1) receptors. ...|$|R

40|$|This paper uses {{state of}} the art stated choice designs to parameterise modal choice models for {{commuting}} and non-commuting travel futures in the presence of new public transport infrastructure (variations of new heavy rail, light rail and dedicated busway systems). D-optimal choice experiments are developed for a set of labelled modal alternatives in which respondents establish a reference benchmark based on the existing service levels (for <b>access,</b> linehaul <b>and</b> <b>egress</b> trip legs) which is used in a computer aided personal interview instrument to generate future scenarios of service levels for current and prospective new modals options. We show that a fully integrated stated choice experiment provides all the information required to obtain behaviourally relevant parameter estimates (within a nested logit framework) for all but the mode-specific constants (MSCs). The MSCs can be calibrated for the current modes within a network model setting, giving the transport planner an appropriate model for predicting the patronage potential for proposed new public transport infrastructure services. A useful by-product is a new set of behavioural values of travel time savings for <b>access,</b> <b>egress,</b> linehaul <b>and</b> wait times. ...|$|R
40|$|A network {{equilibrium}} {{model is}} {{proposed for the}} simultaneous prediction of mode choice and route choice in congested networks with motorized and nonmotorized transport modes. In Hong Kong, motorized and nonmotorized modes are competing travel alternatives, as the average trip length is relatively short because of high-density development in urban areas. In addition, nonmotorized modes such as walking usually serve as complements to motorized trips. For example, transit passengers have to walk to gain <b>access</b> to <b>and</b> <b>egress</b> from transit stops. Here, the transit and walking modes are representatives of motorized and nonmotorized transport modes, respectively. The fundamental congestion effects of each mode and intermodal interactions {{are taken into account}} in the simultaneous mode and route choice problem. An equivalent variational inequality (VI) problem is formulated to capture all the components of the proposed model in an integrated framework. A solution algorithm is presented for solving the VI problem. A numerical example is used to illustrate the application of the proposed model and solution algorithm. More refined estimates of travel times and network flows can be obtained with the proposed model. Department of Civil and Environmental Engineerin...|$|R
40|$|Value pricing {{projects}} {{implemented in}} the U.

On operating projects, pricing keeps congestion from occurring on priced lanes, reduces congestion on toll facilities, changes travel behavior, and improves utilization of existing highway capacity. Revenues from tolls have been used to provide funding for transportation improvements. Yet, issues remain with regard to public attitudes toward projects involving tolls; equity concerns; and political acceptance. Technical issues have also stalled several projects, including high construction costs that limit self-financing capability; <b>access</b> to <b>and</b> <b>egress</b> from priced lanes within freeways; and difficulties with regard to enforcement of toll exemption restrictions for high-occupancy vehicles (HOVs) on priced lanes.

40|$|Transport {{planners}} and policymakers are increasingly considering multimodal public transport and travel demand management (TDM) strategies {{to stem the}} unsustainable travel behaviour trends associated with modern-day, car-dominated travel. Multimodal public transport, however, implies that people change transport mode, which may mean that {{they can no longer}} implement their usual activity patterns, perhaps even resulting in increased car use. The quality of public transport is determined not only by the quality of the main transport mode, but also by the before (<b>access)</b> <b>and</b> after (<b>egress)</b> modes. The interconnectivity of the different modes also becomes important in order to realise a trip. An important question from a policy perspective is, therefore, how people make decisions regarding location, activity scheduling and mode choice when faced with multimodal public transport alternatives. These decisions span different time horizons; the long-, medium- and short-term implications of multimodal public transport are addressed in the AMADEUS research programme, of which this dissertation forms part. National travel survey data for The Netherlands were used to address some of the research questions. An extensive activity diary data collection exercise was undertaken during April to September 2000 in the Utrecht-Almere-Amsterdam urban region of The Netherlands to collect detailed, multimodal activity-travel data. The data collection exercise relied on a specifically designed activity travel diary to capture the detailed stages of public transport. The results suggest that multimodal public transport users have distinctly different characteristics compared to other transport mode users. Considering the relationship between the different time elements, it was found that <b>access,</b> <b>egress</b> <b>and</b> line-haul times are not necessarily influenced by the same variables, while the interconnectivity ratio (access plus egress divided by total trip time) showed different distribution curves for different multimodal chains. Assuming that people make least uncertain decisions first, the results suggest that mode choice ranks lower on the chain of travel behaviour decisions and that individuals make activity scheduling and participation decisions before they make mode choice decisions. The results of this dissertation can be used to inform {{planners and}} policymakers about the implications of public transport and travel behaviour...|$|R

The consequences of diving incidents range from merely annoying to rapidly fatal, and the result often depends on the equipment, skill, response and fitness of the diver and diving team. The hazards include the aquatic environment, the use of breathing equipment in an underwater environment, exposure to a pressurised environment and pressure changes, particularly pressure changes during descent and ascent, and breathing gases at high ambient pressure. Diving equipment other than breathing apparatus is usually reliable, but has been known to fail, and loss of buoyancy control or thermal protection can be a major burden which may lead to more serious problems.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{continue}} the argument which {{was presented in}} a previous paper in Environment and Planning B. There, two spatial genotypes were established within a sample of sixteen Turkish vernacular houses. The first was configurationally integrated around the principal living room or sofa, and the second was configured {{by means of the}} external paved courtyard which gave access to the dwelling from the street. Houses of the first type were shown to structure significant configurational differences within the suite of principal, first-floor living rooms. The sofa seems to have acted as an integrating hinge which linked these spaces together, <b>and</b> controlled <b>access</b> to <b>and</b> <b>egress</b> from the relatively segregated street outside. The second type of room arrangement was characterised by an integration core whch ran from the exterior through to the interior of the dwelling, and was centred on an external paved courtyard. In this paper we explore further the spatial properties of the two house types, and characterise these as 'deep core' and 'shallow core', respectively. It is proposed that the first may be considered a more introverted or centripetal plan, and the second a more extroverted or centrifugal layout. These differences are shown to embody alternative forms of household organisation, in that they support different conceptions of family life, gender relations, and ways of receiving guests into the home. The social origin of the genotypes is attributed to the existence of conservative and liberal tendencies within Turkish society during the period at which the houses were constructed. ...|$|R

It is suggested that by introducing a number of existing and practical safety measures, elevators can become the primary means of egress, as well as the primary means of ingress to a building. Elevators transport more people, and do this with a safety record that surpasses any other means of transportation.
