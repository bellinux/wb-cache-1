5|$|The {{limestone}} {{sculpture of}} Seneb {{and his family}} {{is part of the}} collection of the Egyptian Museum in Cairo. It depicts Seneb and his wife sitting next to each other with their children in the lower register. Seneb is depicted sitting cross-legged on a block of stone with his <b>arms</b> <b>folded</b> in a position characteristic of a scribe. His wife Senet sits alongside him, wearing a long robe with long sleeves and a wig covering her natural hair, which can be glimpsed on her forehead. She encircles him with her arms in a gesture of affection and support. She is shown with a slight smile on her face to signify her contentment and happiness.|$|E
5|$|The nesting Nemegtomaia {{specimen}} {{was placed}} on top of what was probably a ring of eggs, with its <b>arms</b> <b>folded</b> across them. None of the eggs are complete, but they are estimated to have been 5to 6cm (2to 2.3in) wide and 14to 16cm (5to 6in) long when intact. The specimen {{was found in a}} stratigraphic area that indicates Nemegtomaia preferred nesting near streams that would provide soft, sandy substrate and food. Nemegtomaia may have protected its eggs by covering them with its tail and wing feathers. The skeleton of the nesting specimen has damage that indicates it was scavenged by skin beetles. The diet of oviraptorids is uncertain, but their skulls are most similar to other animals that are known or thought to have been herbivorous. Nemegtomaia is known from the Nemegt and Baruungoyot Formations, which are thought to represent humid and arid environments that coexisted in the same area.|$|E
5|$|Mummification was a {{tradition}} that many other pre-Columbian civilisations practiced. On the Altiplano, the habit of conserving the dead started in the Herrera Period, around the 5th century AD. The Muisca continued this culture and prepared their deceased beloved {{members of the society}} by putting the bodies above fires. The heat would dry the body and the phenol conserve the organs and protect them from decomposition, a process that took up to eight hours. After drying, the bodies were wrapped in cotton cloths and placed in caves, buried, or in some cases placed on elevated platforms inside temples, such as the Sun Temple. The position of the mummies was with their <b>arms</b> <b>folded</b> across the chest and the hands around the chin, while the legs were placed over the abdomen. During the preparation of the mummies, the Muisca played music and sang songs honouring their dead. The habit of mummification continued well into the colonial period; the youngest mummies found date from {{the second half of the}} 18th century.|$|E

500|$|In a floridly worded proclamation, {{published}} on 10 November and addressed “To The Men of New York”, Smyth wrote that, “in {{a few days}} the troops under my command will plant the American standard in Canada” and he urged New Yorkers not to “stand with your <b>arms</b> <b>folded</b> and look on in this interesting struggle” but to “advance…to our aid. I will wait for you a few days.” [...] Smyth’s statement of intent appears to have attracted no attention from his opponents across the border.|$|E
500|$|The {{standing}} {{image is}} the focus of much discussion among historians and archaeologists, since there is a general belief {{that it is not a}} statue of the Buddha. The image is [...] tall, and stands on a low pedestal shaped like a lotus. It leans back in a relaxed manner, its <b>arms</b> <b>folded</b> across its chest. [...] The statue's face carries a sorrowful expression and the reclining image—which depicts the Buddha's parinirvana—lies next to it, which has led some to believe that it is the monk Ānanda, who is lamenting the Buddha's demise at his deathbed. [...] The remains of the walls, however, indicate that the two images were once in separate chambers, rather than next to each other. Paranavithana believes that the statue is of the Buddha, which depicts the para dukkha dukkhitha mudra or [...] "sorrow for the sorrow of others". However, this is a rarely used gesture in Sinhalese sculpture, and is seen at only a few locations in the country. Another possibility is that the image shows the Buddha during his second week after enlightenment, which he spent gazing at the Bodhi Tree in gratitude for providing him shelter. The image is not mentioned in the Chulavamsa, which only mentions the other three. While this may be an indication that it is not an image of the Buddha, it is also possible that it may have been made at an earlier period than the others.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT. In {{the recent}} years when {{accomplishing}} anthropological investigations, some complementary anthropological test are included {{for a better}} characterization of a population. For {{the aims of the}} present investigation there have been used the following: Hand clasping, <b>Arm</b> <b>folding,</b> Leg folding, leading hand. The purpose of the study is to be discovered anthropological differences concerning age or sex in the examined population, and to be detected possible changes occurring in dependence of age. In respect of the hand clasping the right hand type predominates over the left, the opposite is noted about <b>arm</b> <b>folding.</b> As a whole right leading hand type dominates over left in the examined population. Total domination of the left or right hand type occurs rarely, in comparison with the mixed type...|$|R
50|$|The {{manner in}} which a person <b>folds</b> <b>arms</b> is one of the clearest dynamic {{morphological}} characteristics by which each person can be assigned to one of two alternative phenotypes. Interestingly, once adopted manner of <b>arms</b> <b>folding</b> across the chest does not change throughout the lifetime and persons easily give up the unusual folding position, most commonly at the first attempt. It has been shown that the phenotypes of these properties are distributed independently with left-handed and right-handed people.|$|R
500|$|The Nemegtomaia {{specimen}} MPC-D 107/15 {{was found}} {{associated with a}} nest with eggs; its feet {{were placed in the}} centre of what was probably a ring of eggs, with the <b>arms</b> <b>folded</b> across the tops of the eggs {{on each side of the}} body, a posture similar to what is seen in other fossils of brooding oviraptorids. The collected part of the nest is about 90cm (35in) wide and 100cm (30in) long; the skeleton occupies the upper 25cm (10in) of the block, whereas the remaining 20cm (8in) is occupied by broken eggs and shells. There is no evidence of plant material in the nest, but there are fragments of undetermined bones. The nest does not preserve any complete eggs or embryos, which prevents determination of the size, shape, number, and arrangement of the eggs in the nest. It is probable that there were originally two layers of eggs below the body, and there do not appear to have been eggs in the centre of the nest. Most eggs (seven distinct eggs have been identified) and egg fragments were recovered either in the lower layer of the nest or under the skull, neck, and limbs of the specimen, and the bones either rested directly on the eggs or were within 5mm (0.2in) of their surfaces. That the skeleton was directly positioned on top of it shows that the nest was not completely covered by sand. Though the placement of the eggs does not suggest a specific arrangement in the nest, most other oviraptorid nests show that the eggs were arranged in pairs in up to three levels of concentric circles. The eggs of MPC-D107/15 were therefore most likely displaced during burial, or by external factors, such as strong winds, sandstorms, or predators. This also supports the idea that the upper layer of eggs was not buried, as fully buried eggs would have been less likely to be transported by external factors.|$|E

2500|$|One of the {{innovations}} in sculpture {{that occurred during}} the Middle Kingdom was the block statue, which would continue to be popular through to the Ptolemaic age almost 2,000 years later. Block statues consist of a man squatting with his knees drawn up to his chest and his <b>arms</b> <b>folded</b> on top his knees. Often, these men are wearing a [...] "wide cloak" [...] that reduces the body of the figure to a simple block-like shape. Most of the detail is reserved for the head of the individual being depicted. In some instances the modeling of the limbs has been retained by the sculptor. There are two basic types of block statues: ones with the feet completely covered by the cloak and ones with the feet uncovered.|$|E

Cosway also forbade his wife from painting, possibly {{out of fear of}} the gossip which surrounded women painters. Her Self-Portrait with <b>Arms</b> <b>Folded</b> is seen as a response to his limitation of her work, her folded arms acting as a sign of her inability to practice. [...] But, [...] in time he realised his wife's talent and helped her to develop it. More than 30 of her works were displayed at the Royal Academy of Art from 1781 until 1801. She soon enhanced her reputation as an artist, especially when her portrait of the Duchess of Devonshire in the character of Cynthia was exhibited. Among her personal acquaintances were Lady Lyttelton; the Hon. Mrs. Darner, the Countess of Aylesbury; Lady Cecilia Johnston; and the Marchioness of Townshend.|$|E
2500|$|With Australians out {{for their}} third low score {{in a row and}} with no rain in sight England had every chance of making a large total on a good wicket and {{equalising}} the series. It was an opportunity they did not take as Ian Johnson caught Reg Simpson (4) off Keith Miller (2/39), who then took a magnificent driving catch to take John Dewes (8) off Bill Johnston (2/28). Cyril Washbrook was joined by Len Hutton – still batting in the middle order – to re-establish their old partnership and set about restoring the innings. Washbrook (21) made some charming cover-drives before he was given out lbw to Ray Lindwall (2/46), although only he and Don Tallon appealed and the other nine fielders remained silent. Jack Iverson was brought on and saw a ball flick off Hutton's pads as he checked a sweep (it was the over before lunch). Iverson yelled [...] "Catch it", Tallon dived forwards to take the ball an inch off the ground and the bewildered opener was given out for 12. Only Iverson appealed and [...] "Not even Tallon, {{one of the most notorious}} appealers of all time, asked for a catch". and Miller, standing four feet away at silly-leg [...] "stood there with his <b>arms</b> <b>folded,</b> feet wide apart, completely uninterested" [...] Hutton returned to the pavilion with a face like thunder and [...] Umpire Cooper was obviously upset that he so obviously disagreed with the decision and ended the over after only seven balls. One Yorkshireman was soon followed by another as Brian Close swished a ball to Sam Loxton and England went into lunch on 54/5. Captain Freddie Brown and Gilbert Parkhouse returned to the crease after lunch and made the best of things, but the Welshman's stilt-like footwork was his undoing and he was caught by Hassett off Miller. He was replaced by Trevor Bailey who steadfastly defended at one end while his captain brought the crowd to its feet hitting Johnson straight down the ground for six and through the covers for four. He hit three more boundaries in his 62 and they added 65 for the seventh wicket. Bailey was out first, bowled by Lindwall and Brown was caught by Johnson off Iverson. Godfrey Evans hit Lindwall straight to the boundary and took 8 runs off Miller, which resulted in a bouncer, which the keeper dodged like a boxer, and the bowler being booed. Evans cracked another four past point off Miller, who was removed from the attack, and passed 1,000 runs in Tests, but was [...] "c Johnson, b Iverson" [...] for 49 and was cheered by the crowd when he left. Alec Bedser (5 not out) had batted for nearly an hour helping Evans, but Doug Wright (2) only lasted five minutes and England were out for 197, exceeding Australia's First Innings by only 3 runs. This was both a failure and a relief, given how the innings had progressed.|$|E

50|$|Falk and Ayala (1971) {{in their}} {{research}} {{found that these}} variants are largely inherited, although their genetic make up cannot be attributed the existing Mendelian models. 1 In this regard, Ferronato et al. (1974) found no significant correlation between parents and children. Individual type of <b>arms</b> <b>folding</b> is slightly less studied than the manner of clasping hands. In search of the main factors that determine this dimorphism, the same difficulties emerge as with clasping hands. However, utilising the findings and the views of many authors, {{it can be concluded}} that the manner of <b>arms</b> <b>folding</b> is hereditary and that it inherits the model that does not fit into the genetics concept of simple Mendelian characters, although in this respect there are contradictory findings. The main conclusion is that the manifestation of alternative phenotypes with these characteristics is irrespective of sex and age, and that it is not related to handedness.|$|R
