50|$|MEGF10 is a {{regulator}} {{of satellite}} cell myogenesis and interacts with Notch1 in myoblasts. It {{has been shown}} to be the cause of early-onset myopathy, <b>areflexia,</b> respiratory distress and dysphagia.|$|E
50|$|Hyporeflexia {{refers to}} below normal or absent {{reflexes}} (<b>areflexia).</b> It {{can be detected}} {{through the use of}} a reflex hammer. It is the opposite of hyperreflexia.Hyporeflexia is generally associated with a lower motor neuron deficit (at the alpha motor neurons from spinal cord to muscle), whereas hyperreflexia is often attributed to upper motor neuron lesions (along the long, motor tracts from the brain). The upper motor neurons are thought to inhibit the reflex arc, which is formed by sensory neurons from intrafusal fibers of muscles, lower motor neurons (including alpha and gamma motor fibers) and appurtenant interneurons. Therefore, damage to lower motor neurons will subsequently result in hyporeflexia and/or <b>areflexia.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Patients {{who start}} taking colchicine, {{and who have}} {{compromised}} renal function, develop a myopathy that shows symptoms in proximal muscle weakness, distal sensory loss and <b>areflexia.</b> A muscle biopsy shows a vacuolar myopathy without significant cell death or inflammation.|$|E
50|$|Vestibulocochlear {{dysfunction}} progressive familial, known also as familial progressive vestibulocochlear dysfunction is an {{autosomal dominant}} disease {{that results in}} sensorineural hearing loss and vestibular <b>areflexia.</b> Patients report feelings of vague dissiness, blurred vision, dysequilibrium in the dark, and progressive hearing impairment.|$|E
50|$|Lambert-Eaton myasthenic {{syndrome}} (LEMS) is an autoimmune {{disorder that}} affects the presynaptic portion of the neuromuscular junction. This rare disease can be marked by a unique triad of symptoms: proximal muscle weakness, autonomic dysfunction, and <b>areflexia.</b> Proximal muscle weakness {{is a product of}} pathogenic autoantibodies directed against P/Q-type voltage-gated calcium channels, which in turn leads to a reduction of acetylcholine release from motor nerve terminals on the presynaptic cell. Examples of autonomic dysfunction caused by LEMS include erectile dysfunction in men, constipation, and, most commonly, dry mouth. Less common dysfunctions include dry eyes and altered perspiration. <b>Areflexia</b> is a condition in which tendon reflexes are reduced and it may subside temporarily after a period of exercise.|$|E
50|$|CMV polyradiculomyelopathy (PRAM) {{is one of}} {{the five}} {{distinct}} neurological syndromes caused by CMV in HIV/AIDS. It causes subacute ascending lower extremity weakness with paresthesias and radicular pain, hyporeflexia or <b>areflexia,</b> and urinary retention. It has been suggested that CMV polyradiculomyelopathy should be treated with both ganciclovir and foscarnet in patients who develop the disease while taking either of these drugs.|$|E
50|$|Note that, in spinal shock, {{which is}} {{commonly}} {{seen in the}} transection of the spinal cord (Spinal cord injury), <b>areflexia</b> can transiently occur {{below the level of}} the lesion and can , after some time, become hyperreflexic. Furthermore, cases of severe muscle atrophy or destruction could render the muscle too weak to show any reflex and {{should not be confused with}} a neuronal cause.|$|E
50|$|Symptoms of the Roussy-Lévy {{syndrome}} mainly {{stem from}} nerve damage {{and the resulting}} progressive muscle atrophy. Neurological damage may result in absent tendon reflexes (<b>areflexia),</b> some distal sensory loss and decreased excitability of muscles to galvanic and faradic stimulation. Progressive muscle wasting results in weakness of distal limb muscles (especially the peronei), gait ataxia, pes cavus, postural tremors and static tremor of the upper limbs, kyphoscoliosis, and foot deformity.|$|E
50|$|Characteristics of the {{syndrome}} include {{the presence of}} acanthocytes (burr-cell malformation of the erythrocytes), and the reduction or even absence of B-lipoproteins. Complications include retinitis pigmentosa, degenerative changes in {{the central nervous system}} involving the cerebellum and long tracts, fatty diarrhea, ataxia, <b>areflexia,</b> demyelination, defective intestinal lipid absorption with low serum cholesterol level, intestinal malabsorption, amaurosis, retarded growth, and steatorrhea. Intellectual development may be slightly retarded.Many afflicted with {{the syndrome}} are unable to walk.|$|E
50|$|Chronic {{inflammatory}} demyelinating polyneuropathy, {{also known}} as Vidaurri's disease, {{is believed to be}} due to immune cells, which normally protect the body from foreign infection, incorrectly attacking the nerves in the body instead. As a result, the affected nerves fail to respond, or respond only weakly, and on occasion, inordinately, to stimuli, causing numbing, tingling, pain, progressive muscle weakness, loss of deep tendon reflexes (<b>areflexia),</b> fatigue, and abnormal sensations. The likelihood of progression of the disease is high.|$|E
50|$|In 1926, {{scientists}} Gustave Roussy and Gabrielle Lévy reported 7 cases {{within a}} same {{family of a}} dominantly inherited disorder over 4 generations. They noticed that prominent features of this disorder were an unsteady gait during early childhood and <b>areflexia,</b> or the absence of reflexes, which eventually lead to clumsiness and muscle weakness. During a nerve biopsy of {{a few of the}} original patients, the demyelinating lesions found led the scientists to believe that the Roussy-Lévy syndrome was a variant of demyelinating Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT-1).|$|E
50|$|The {{syndrome}} typically presents as {{a progressive}} flaccid symmetric paralysis with <b>areflexia,</b> often causing respiratory failure. Electromyographic studies and nerve conduction studies show normal motor conduction velocity and latency with decreased amplitude of compound muscle action potentials. F wave and sensory nerve action potentials are often normal in this illness. Pathologically, it is a noninflammatory axonopathy without demyelination. Antibodies attack the coating {{of the motor}} neurons without causing inflammation or loss of myelin. It does not affect sensory neurons, so sensation remains intact despite loss of movement.|$|E
5000|$|Spinal shock {{was first}} defined by Whytt in 1750 as {{a loss of}} [...] {{accompanied}} by motor paralysis with initial loss but gradual recovery of reflexes, following a spinal cord injury (SCI) - most often a complete transection. Reflexes in the spinal cord {{below the level of}} injury are depressed (hyporeflexia) or absent (<b>areflexia),</b> while those above the level of the injury remain unaffected. The 'shock' in spinal shock does not refer to circulatory collapse, and {{should not be confused with}} neurogenic shock, which is life-threatening ...|$|E
50|$|Dejerine-Sottas {{disease is}} {{characterized}} by moderate to severe lower and upper extremity weakness and loss of sensation, which occur mainly in the lower legs, forearms, feet and hands. Loss of muscle mass and reduced muscle tone can occur as the disease progresses. Other symptoms may include pain in the extremities, curvature of the spine, clawed hands, foot deformities, ataxia, peripheral <b>areflexia,</b> and slow acquisition of motor skills in childhood. Symptoms that are less common can include limitation of eye movements, other eye problems such as nystagmus or anisocoria, or mild hearing loss.|$|E
50|$|The {{onset of}} myelomalacia {{may be so}} subtle that it is overlooked. Depending {{on the extent of}} the spinal cord injury, the {{symptoms}} may vary. In some cases, the symptom may be as common as hypertension. Though every case is different, several cases reported loss of motor functions in the extremities, <b>areflexia</b> or sudden jerks of the limbs, loss of pain perception, or even paralysis; all of which are possible indicators of a damaged and softened spinal cord. In the most severe cases, paralysis of the respiratory system manifests in death.|$|E
50|$|Xylazine {{administration}} {{can lead to}} diabetes mellitus and hyperglycemia. Other possible side effects that can occur are <b>areflexia,</b> asthenia, ataxia, blurred vision, disorientation, dizziness, drowsiness, dysarthria, dysmetria, fainting, hyporeflexia, slurred speech, somnolence, staggering, coma, apnea, shallow breathing, sleepiness, premature ventricular contraction, tachycardia, miosis, and dry mouth. Rarely, hypotonia, dry mouth, urinary incontinence and nonspecific electrocardiographic ST segment changes occur. It {{has been reported that}} the duration of symptoms after human overdose is 8 to 72 hours. Further research is necessary to categorize the side effects that occur when xylazine is used in conjunction with heroin and cocaine.|$|E
5000|$|CNS {{symptoms}} {{begin with}} {{mild cognitive impairment}} and slowed reactions, and in a very severe form often progress to unconsciousness. [...] Patients may present with neuropathic pain early in the infection. Eventually severe infection will lead to ascending weakness, quadriparesis, <b>areflexia,</b> respiratory failure, and muscle atrophy, and will lead to death if not treated. Occasionally patients present with cranial nerve palsies, usually in nerves 7 and 8, and rarely larvae will enter ocular structures. [...] Even with treatment, damage to the CNS may be permanent and result {{in a variety of}} negative outcomes depending on the location of the infection, and the patient may suffer chronic pain as a result of infection.|$|E
50|$|Among {{the various}} {{disorders}} {{associated with the}} ubiquitin-proteasome pathway is X-linked {{infantile spinal muscular atrophy}} (XL-SMA). The fatal childhood disorder is associated with loss of anterior horn cells and infantile death. Clinical features include hypotonia, <b>areflexia,</b> and multiple congenital contractures. In a large-scale mutation analysis, screening of six XL-SMA families provided results indicating two novel missense mutations in two families and a novel synonymous C->T substitution in another three familiesfootnote. All of these detected mutations were located in exon 15 of the UBE1 gene (the gene encoding ubiquitin-activating enzyme) and were observed to segregate with disease in the families. In brevity, UBE1 missense may lead to a disturbed complex building with gigaxonin, a protein involved in axonal structure and neuronal maintenance. This can lead to impaired degradation of microtubule-associated protein 1B (MAP1B), resulting in the build-up of MAP1B protein, which may enhance neuronal cell death. Thus, mutations in UBE1 are suspected to be the cause of genetic defects in XL-SMA individuals.|$|E
50|$|The {{disorder}} causes flaccid paraplegia (impairment {{of motor}} function in lower extremities), total <b>areflexia</b> (below normal {{or absence of}} reflexes) of the pelvic limbs and anus, loss of deep pain perception caudal (toward the coccyx, or tail) {{to the site of}} spinal cord injury, muscular atrophy (wasting away of muscle tissue), depressed mental state, and respiratory difficulty due to intercostal (muscles that run between the ribs) and diaphragmatic paralysis. Gradual cranial migration of the neurological deficits (problems relating to the nervous system), is known as ascending syndrome and {{is said to be a}} typical feature of diffuse myelomalacia. Although clinical signs of myelomalacia are observed within the onset (start) of paraplegia, sometimes they may become evident only in the post-operative period, or even days after the onset of paraplegia. Death from myelomalacia may occur as a result of respiratory paralysis when the ascending lesion (abnormal damaged tissue) reaches the motor nuclei of the phrenic nerves (nerves between the C3-C5 region of the spine) in the cervical (neck) region.|$|E
50|$|AMAN, {{also known}} as Chinese Paralytic Syndrome, was first {{described}} {{by a group of}} Johns Hopkins University and University of Pennsylvania neurologists in collaboration with neurologists from the Second Teaching Hospital of Hebei Medical School and Beijing Children's Hospital. In 1991, Guy Mckhann, Jack Griffin, Dave Cornblath and Tony Ho from Johns Hopkins University and Arthur Asbury from University of Pennsylvania visited China to study a mysterious epidemic of paralytic syndrome occurring in northern China. Every summer, hundreds of children from rural China developed acute paralysis and respiratory failure. Hospitals were overwhelmed with number of cases and often ran out of ventilators and hospital beds. Examination of these children showed that many of them had acute flaccid paralysis and <b>areflexia</b> but with little or no sensory loss. Electrophysiological testing of these children showed motor axonal loss with occasional conduction block with a lack of demyelinating features and normal sensory potentials. In contrast, the common form of Guillain-Barré syndrome in the West often presents with sensory loss and demyelination on electrophysiology testing and is more common in adults. Later, several autopsies confirmed the focus of the immune attack was at the motor axolemma especially around the nodes of Ranvier. These cases showed deposition of antibody and complement along the motor axolemma and associated macrophage infiltration.|$|E
40|$|Multiple {{sclerosis}} (MS) {{is characterized}} by inflammatory lesions throughout the central nervous system. Spinal cord inflammation correlates with many neurological defecits. Most MS patients suffer from micturition dysfunction with urinary incontinence and difficulty in emptying the bladder. In experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) induced in female Lewis rats, a model of MS, we investigated at distinct clinical severity scores the micturition reflex by cystometrograms. All rats presenting symptomatic EAE suffered from micturition reflex alterations with either detrusor <b>areflexia</b> or hyperactivity. During pre-symptomatic EAE, a majority of rats presented with detrusor <b>areflexia,</b> whereas at onset of clinical EAE, detrusor hyperactivity was predominant. During progression of EAE, detrusor <b>areflexia</b> and hyperactivity were equally expressed. Bladder hyperactivity was suppressed by activation of glycine and GABA receptors in the lumbosacral spinal cord with an order of potency: glycine > GABAB > GABAA. Detrusor <b>areflexia</b> was transformed into detrusor hyperactivity by blocking glycine and GABA receptors. Spinalization abolished bladder activity in rats presenting detrusor hyperactivity and failed to induce activity in detrusor <b>areflexia.</b> Altogether, the results reveal an exaggerated descending excitatory control in both detrusor reflex alterations. In detrusor <b>areflexia,</b> a strong segmental inhibition dominates this excitatory control. As in treatment of MS, electrical stimulation of sacral roots reduced detrusor hyperactivity in EAE. Blockade of glycine receptors in the lumbosacral spinal cord suppressed the stimulation-induced inhibitory effect. Our data help to better understand bladder dysfunction and treatment mechanisms to suppress detrusor hyperactivity in MS...|$|E
40|$|A {{clinical}} syndrome of tonic pupil {{associated with}} tendon <b>areflexia</b> was first described by Holmes and Adie; autonomic neuropathy and peripheral neuropathy can be associated. The postulated mechanism of <b>areflexia</b> in Holmes-Adie syndrome is a synaptic disorder of the spinal reflex pathways. We report {{a case of}} a Holmes-Adie syndrome variant with hitherto unreported cranial neuropathy. A 41 year old woman developed insidious onset of sensory symptoms related to her left trigeminal and chorda tympani nerves over a few months. Physical examination showed generalised tendon <b>areflexia</b> and a left sided Adie's pupil. Imaging did not reveal any structural abnormality. Electrophysiological studies demonstrated an absent blink reflex on stimulating the left supraorbital and infraorbital nerves. These findings were suggestive of a dysfunction affecting the brain stem reflex arc. The pathophysiological process of Holmes-Adie syndrome may be more widespread than previously thought.
