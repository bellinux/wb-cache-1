6000|$|They lost no time, {{but they}} did not eat in haste, and Alton glanced at Seaforth when the meal was done. [...] "You'll stop right here, Charley, by the tent," [...] he said. [...] "I can't quite tell when Tom <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>back</b> again." ...|$|E

Parkins," [...] he added, turning to his secretary, [...] "if any one calls, just say that my wife <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>back</b> early in the afternoon. And you'd better step upstairs to the {{laboratory}} and give my compliments to Inspector French, and say that I hope he and Miss Laura will join us at Delmonico's for luncheon at one o'clock." ...|$|E

'Ou then, he just said, [...] "If {{there comes}} {{such a person}} to inquire after Mr. Brown, you will say I am gone {{to look at the}} skaters on Loch Creeran, as you call it, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>back</b> here to dinner." [...] But he never came back, though I {{expected}} him sae faithfully that I gae a look to making the friar's chicken mysell, and to the crappitheads too, and that's what I dinna do for ordinary, Mr. Glossin. But little did I think what skating wark he was gaun about--to shoot Mr. Charles, the innocent lamb!' ...|$|E
6000|$|The {{mention of}} his wife {{recalled}} him to himself, oddly enough, when Demorest's name had failed. But very differently. Out of his whirling consciousness came the instinctive feeling {{that he could not}} see her now. He turned, crossed the room, sat down on the sofa beside Mrs. Horncastle, and without, however, looking at her, said, with his eyes on the floor, [...] "No; and I've been thinking that it's hardly worth while to disturb her so early to-morrow as I should have to go. So I think it's a good deal better to let her have a good night's rest, remain here quietly with you to-morrow until the stage leaves, and that both of you come over together. My horse is still saddled, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>back</b> at Hymettus before Demorest has gone to bed." ...|$|E

The result is that I am pestered to death {{by a set of}} needy vagabonds who want to marry me. In this position, I am exposed to slanders and insults. Even if I didn't know that the men were after my money, there {{is not one of them}} whom I would venture to marry. He might turn out a tyrant and beat me; or a drunkard, and disgrace me; or a betting man, and ruin me. What I want, you see, for my own peace and protection, is to be able to declare myself married, and to produce the proof in the shape of a certificate. A born gentleman, with a character to lose, and so much younger in years than myself that he wouldn't think of living with me--there is the sort of husband who suits my book! I'm a reasonable woman, gentlemen. I would undertake to part with my husband at the church door--never to attempt to see him or write to him afterward--and only to show my certificate when necessary, without giving any explanations. Your secret would be quite safe in my keeping. I don't care a straw for either of you, so long as you answer my purpose. What do you say to paying my bill (one or the other of you) in this way? I am ready dressed for the altar; and the clergyman has notice at the church. My preference is for Mr. Cosway," [...] proceeded this terrible woman with the cruelest irony, [...] "because he has been so particular in his attentions toward me. The license (which I provided on the chance a fortnight since) is made out in his name. Such is my weakness for Mr. Cosway. But that don't matter if Mr. Stone would like to take his place. He can hail by his friend's name. Oh, yes, he can! I have consulted my lawyer. So long as the bride and bridegroom agree to it, they may be married in any name they like, and it stands good. Look at your watch again, Mr. Stone. The church is in the next street. By my calculation, you have just got five minutes to decide. I'm a punctual woman, my little dears; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>back</b> to the moment." ...|$|E
