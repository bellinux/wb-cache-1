5|$|Henry {{probably}} {{spent some}} of his earliest years in his mother's household, and accompanied Matilda to Normandy in the late 1130s. Henry's later childhood, probably {{from the age of}} seven, was spent in Anjou, where he was educated by Peter of Saintes, a noted grammarian of the day. In late 1142, Geoffrey decided to send the nine-year-old to Bristol, the centre of Angevin opposition to Stephen in the south-west of England, accompanied by Robert of Gloucester. Although having children educated in relatives' households was common among noblemen of the period, sending Henry to England also had political benefits, as Geoffrey was coming under criticism for refusing to join the war in England. For about a year, Henry lived alongside Roger of Worcester, one of Robert's sons, and was instructed by a magister, Master Matthew; Robert's household was known for its education and learning. The canons of St Augustine's in Bristol also helped in Henry's education, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>remembered</b> them with affection in later years. Henry returned to Anjou in either 1143 or 1144, resuming his education under William of Conches, another famous academic.|$|E
5|$|On February 28, Garza's {{half-brother}} Moya {{testified against}} him and said Garza admitted he had received US$3,000 for Fischer's murder {{while he was in}} Brownsville. Garza's defense tried to discredit Moya's statements by saying he was facing drug offenses in Dallas, and was cooperating with prosecutors by testifying against Garza to receive a reduced sentence. Moya denied such arrangements were in place. He said the gun used at the murder scene was bought in Dallas while he was there, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>remembered</b> seeing it in Garza's home in San Antonio. Records from the gun shop in Dallas showed Garza bought the same type of gun on February 1, 1993. In addition, a Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) investigator testified he helped record the suspect's conversations, while a Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) technician helped improve the clarity of the tapes. The defense attorneys brought in experts to discredit the recordings, and to prove they had been tampered with.|$|E
25|$|In 1831, 14-year-old Charlotte was {{enrolled}} {{at the school of}} Miss Wooler in Roe Head, Mirfield. Patrick could have sent his daughter to a less costly school in Keighley nearer home but Miss Wooler and her sisters had a good reputation <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>remembered</b> the building which he passed when strolling around the parishes of Kirklees, Dewsbury, and Hartshead-cum-Clifton where he was vicar. Margaret Wooler showed fondness towards the sisters and she accompanied Charlotte to the altar at her marriage. Patrick's choice of school was excellent – Charlotte was happy there and studied well. She made many lifelong friends, in particular Ellen Nussey and Mary Taylor who later went to New Zealand before returning to England. Charlotte returned from Roe Head in June 1832, missing her friends, but happy to rejoin her family.|$|E

25|$|Coleman and Brown bicycled into Norwood on July 13 {{at about}} 9:30a.m. Less {{than three hours}} later, they drove away in a car {{belonging}} to Harry Walters, who was unconscious, and his wife, Marlene, 43, who had been raped and beaten to death. Harry Walters survived and later testified that Coleman and Brown inquired about a camper he had offered for sale. While Walters {{sat on the couch}} and discussed the trailer title with Coleman, Coleman picked up a wooden candlestick and, after admiring it, hit Walters {{on the back of the}} head with it. The impact of the blow broke the candlestick and drove a chunk of bone against Mr. Walters' brain, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>remembered</b> little else of the incident beyond that point. Sheri Walters, Harry and Marlene's daughter, returned home from work at about 3:45p.m., where she found her mother dead at the bottom of the basement steps, and her father still alive. Both had ligatures around their throats and electrical cords tied around their bare feet, her father's hands were handcuffed behind his back, while her mother's hands were bound behind her back and her head was covered with a bloody sheet. The coroner indicated Marlene Walters had been bludgeoned on the head approximately 20 to 25 times, with twelve lacerations, some of which were made with a pair of locking pliers, covered her face and scalp. The back of her skull was crushed to pieces, and parts of her skull and brain were missing. The living room hallway and basement were splattered with blood, and shards of a broken soda bottle, bearing Coleman's fingerprints, were found in the living room. Strands of Marlene Walters' hair were found on a bloodstained magazine rack located in the living room, and bloody footprints made by two different kinds of shoes were found in the basement. The Walters' car, a red Plymouth Reliant, was missing, as well as money, jewelry, and shoes which had been stolen. Two bicycles, clothes and shoes not belonging to the Walters had been left behind.|$|E
500|$|Ford {{was also}} a notorious {{alcoholic}} whose excesses contributed to his death six years after Johnson's visit. This event deeply affected Johnson, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>remembered</b> Ford in his Life of Fenton, saying that Ford's abilities, [...] "instead of furnishing convivial merriments to the voluptuous and dissolute, might have enabled him to excel among the virtuous and the wise". Having spent six months with his cousins, Johnson returned to Lichfield, but Hunter, [...] "angered by the impertinence of this long absence", refused {{to allow him to}} continue at the grammar school.|$|E
500|$|In {{the summer}} of 1990, {{a few weeks before}} his 17th birthday, his father led a group of high school math students, {{including}} Sergey, on a two-week exchange program to the Soviet Union. His roommate on the trip was future Carnegie Mellon University computer science professor John Stamper. As Brin recalls, the trip awakened his childhood fear of authority <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>remembered</b> that [...] "his first impulse on confronting Soviet oppression had been to throw pebbles at a police car". Malseed adds, [...] "On {{the second day of the}} trip, while the group toured a sanatorium in the countryside near Moscow, Brin took his father aside, looked him in the eye and said, 'Thank you for taking us all out of Russia.'" ...|$|E

2500|$|... “After The Bondman, I chanced {{on an old}} Manxman in Kirk Maughold, {{who told}} me that he had known the place all his life, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>remembered</b> Adam Fairbrother and the six big lazy brothers, and the girl Greeba, and the mill at Port-e-Vullin (for it was “himself that felled it”), but he was “plagued mortal” to fix Jason, the Icelander, and he couldn’t meet with anyone in the parish who remembered {{anything}} about him.” ...|$|E
2500|$|A century later, Shakespeare {{editor and}} {{historian}} A. L. Rowse wrote {{a biography of}} Shakespeare, where, similarly, he firmly asserted that the writer was not a secret Catholic, but a Protestant: [...] "He was an orthodox, confirming member of the Church into {{which he had been}} baptised, was brought up and married, in which his children were reared and in whose arms he at length was buried". Shakespeare had also become the godfather of William Walker in the Church of England, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>remembered</b> his godson in his will with twenty shillings.|$|E

5000|$|For some {{considerable}} {{time in the}} early 1960s he {{played the role of}} 'Freddie' in the stage production of My Fair Lady at Drury Lane, when Sam Lewis was musical director.

60|$|She found that, {{much as she}} had dreaded it, she had by {{no means}} {{realized}} the discomposure she secretly endured when they met at breakfast, <b>and</b> <b>he,</b> <b>remembering</b> her repulse, was cold--she was colder; and Violet, who, in the morning freshness, was growing less timid, shrank back into awe of her formal civility.|$|R
50|$|Man has two {{problems}} with memory: <b>he</b> cannot <b>remember</b> the things <b>he</b> wants to <b>remember,</b> <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>remembers</b> things <b>he</b> would rather forget. Johnson thinks people would benefit more from increased forgetfulness than from increased memory. If we could stop brooding on painful and useless memories, {{we would be}} better able to learn things we need to know. People should try to banish troublesome memories by keeping busy with new pursuits.|$|R
