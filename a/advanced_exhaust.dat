A subsonic, three-dimensional parabolized Navier-Stokes (PNS) code is used to construct stall margin design charts for optimum-length <b>advanced</b> <b>exhaust</b> systems' circular-to-rectangular transition ducts. Computer code validation has been conducted to examine the capability of wall static pressure predictions.

40|$|The ZMOTTO {{program was}} {{developed}} to model mathematically a spark-ignited internal combustion engine. ZMOTTO is a large, general purpose program whose calculations can be established at five levels of sophistication. These five models range from an ideal cycle requiring only thermodynamic properties, to a very complex representation demanding full combustion kinetics, transport properties, and poppet valve flow characteristics. ZMOTTO is a flexible and computationally economical program based on a system of ordinary differential equations for cylinder-averaged properties. The calculations assume that heat transfer is {{expressed in terms of}} a heat transfer coefficient and that the cylinder average of kinetic plus potential energies remains constant. During combustion, the pressures of burned and unburned gases are assumed equal and their heat transfer areas are assumed proportional to their respective mass fractions. Even the simplest ZMOTTO model provides for residual gas effects, spark <b>advance,</b> <b>exhaust</b> gas recirculation, supercharging, and throttling. In the more complex models, 1) finite rate chemistry replaces equilibrium chemistry in descriptions of both the flame and the burned gases, 2) poppet valve formulas represent fluid flow instead of a zero pressure drop flow, and 3) flame propagation is modeled by mass burning equations instead of as an instantaneous process. Input to ZMOTTO is determined by the model chosen. Thermodynamic data is required for all models. Transport properties and chemical kinetics data are required only as the model complexity grows. Other input includes engine geometry, working fluid composition, operating characteristics, and intake/exhaust data. ZMOTTO accommodates a broad spectrum of reactants. The program will calculate many Otto cycle performance parameters for a number of consecutive cycles (a cycle being an interval of 720 crankangle degrees). A typical case will have a number of initial ideal cycles and progress through levels of nonideal cycles. ZMOTTO has restart capabilities and permits multicycle calculations with parameters varying from cycle to cycle. ZMOTTO is written in FORTRAN IV (IBM Level H) but has also been compiled with IBM VSFORTRAN (1977 standard). It was developed on an IBM 3033 under the TSS operating system and has also been implemented under MVS. Approximately 412 K of 8 bit bytes of central memory are required in a nonpaging environment.

40|$|The HSCT {{exhaust nozzle}} must manage high {{temperature}} exhaust gases and pressure gradients while meeting HSCT economic and noise goals. The important features and requirements for an HSCT exhaust nozzle are shown for a 2 DCD (two-dimensional convergent-divergent) design.

Exhaust nozzle weight has an adverse effect on the overall aircraft range, payload, and engine specific fuel consumption and is therefore the primary driver for <b>advanced</b> <b>exhaust</b> nozzle materials. Because of the large airflow and pressure gradients, exhaust nozzles are extremely large and heavy when made from current materials. The use of advanced materials with higher specific strength will reduce the weight of exhaust nozzle components. In addition to the flow of high-temperature exhaust gases into the exhaust nozzle, ambient air is entrained to reduce gas exit velocities and suppress sound. This leads to components exposed to extremely high temperature gradients and, hence, high thermal stresses.
