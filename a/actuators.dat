In addition to its authorized strength, the 509th had attached to it on Tinian 51 civilian and military personnel from Project Alberta, known as the 1st Technical Detachment. The 509th Composite Group's 393d Bombardment Squadron was equipped with 15 Silverplate B-29s.

5|$|The XF-104 had {{a radical}} wing design. Most {{supersonic}} jets use a swept or delta wing. This allows a reasonable balance between aerodynamic performance, lift, and internal space for fuel and equipment. However {{the most efficient}} shape for high-speed, supersonic flight had {{been found to be}} a small, straight, mid-mounted, trapezoidal wing of low aspect ratio and high wing loading. The wing was extremely thin, with a thickness-to-chord ratio of only 3.4%. The leading edges of the wing were so thin (0.016in/0.41mm) and so sharp that they presented a hazard to ground crews, and protective guards had to be installed during ground operations. The thinness of the wings meant that fuel tanks and landing gear had to be contained in the fuselage. The hydraulic <b>actuators</b> driving the ailerons were only one inch (25mm) thick to fit into the available space and were known as Piccolo <b>actuators</b> because of their resemblance to this musical instrument. The wings had electrically driven leading and trailing edge flaps to increase lift at low speed. The XF-104 did not feature the Boundary Layer Control System of the production aircraft.|$|E

50|$|When precise angular {{positioning}} over {{only a small}} total angle is required, a linear <b>actuator</b> (either manual, or motorized) may be used.

The linear <b>actuator</b> presses against a contact surface fixed to the stage platform such that extension or retraction of the <b>actuator</b> causes the platform to rotate.

40|$|The <b>actuator</b> line method made it {{possible}} to describe the near wake of a wind turbine more accurately than with the <b>actuator</b> disk method. Whereas the <b>actuator</b> line generates the helicoidal vortex system shed from the tip blades, the <b>actuator</b> disk method sheds a vortex sheet {{from the edge of the}} rotor plane. But with the <b>actuator</b> line come also temporal and spatial constraints, such as the need for a much smaller time step than with <b>actuator</b> disk. While the latter one only has to obey the Courant-Friedrichs-Lewy condition, the former one is also restricted by the grid resolution and the rotor tip-speed. Additionally the spatial resolution has to be finer for the <b>actuator</b> line than with the <b>actuator</b> disk, for well resolving the tip vortices. Therefore this work is dedicated to examining a method in between of <b>actuator</b> line and <b>actuator</b> disk, which is able to model the transient behaviour, such as the rotating blades, but which also relaxes the temporal constraint. Therefore a larger time-step is used and the blade forces are swept over a certain area.
