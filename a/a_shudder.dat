500|$|The Court {{returned}} {{to the issue of}} abortion in the 2000 case of Stenberg v. Carhart, in which it invalidated a Nebraska statute outlawing partial-birth abortion. Justice Stephen Breyer wrote for the Court that the law was unconstitutional because it did not allow an exception for the health of the woman. Scalia dissented, comparing the Stenberg case to two of the most reviled cases in Supreme Court history: [...] "I am optimistic enough to believe that, one day, Stenberg v. Carhart will be assigned its rightful place {{in the history of this}} Court's jurisprudence beside Korematsu and Dred Scott. The method of killing a human child... proscribed by this statute is so horrible that the most clinical description of it evokes <b>a</b> <b>shudder</b> of revulsion".|$|E
500|$|Above the waterline, {{there was}} little {{evidence}} of the collision.

No one was very much alarmed but knew we had struck something". Fireman George Kemish heard a [...] "heavy thud and grinding tearing sound" [...] from the starboard hull.|$|E

500|$|... (Nine hundred {{was roughly}} {{the number of}} men in a single {{infantry}} battalion, and as regiments were formed on local lines, most would have been from the same county; it is thus emphasised that his crime is a black mark against both the regiment, as a whole, and against his comrades.) The fourth verse comes to the hanging; Files sees the body against the sun, and then feels his soul as it [...] "whimpers" [...] overhead; the term reflects <b>a</b> <b>shudder</b> in the ranks as they watch Deever die. Finally, the Sergeant moves the men away; though it is not directly mentioned in the poem, they would be marched past the corpse on the gallows – reflecting that the recruits are shaking after their ordeal, and that [...] "they'll want their beer to-day".|$|E
2500|$|The storyline {{received}} positive {{attention from}} critics. Dianne Butler, {{writing for the}} Herald Sun, quipped [...] "the bride and groom give a bit of <b>a</b> <b>shudder</b> when Paul Robinson arrives at their door {{on the morning of}} the wedding, but I think that's most people's reaction any time Paul shows up. But it's a lovely day – yellow roses, Karl doesn't sing – apart from the robbery, and the screaming and the ambulances. Neighbours eh? Brilliant. Nobody's done a wedding like this in years." [...] Kate Lucey from Sugar called [...] "Neighbours: The Explosion" [...] one of the serial's [...] "biggest storylines of the year" [...] and included it in her feature on upcoming dramatic soap storylines. Lucey said [...] "With an upcoming fire in the Rovers Return for Coronation Street, an explosion in Neighbours and the newly announced plans for a pregnancy in EastEnders, we're not really sure where to look first." [...] Daniel Kilkelly from Digital Spy stated that the explosion was [...] "one of 2013's biggest storylines." [...] Of the explosion, a columnist from New! commented [...] "This is one episode you DO NOT want to miss!" ...|$|E
