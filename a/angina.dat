5|$|Coronary {{artery disease}} {{is also known}} as ischemic heart disease, is caused by {{atherosclerosis}} – a build-up of plaque along the inner walls of the arteries which narrows them, reducing the blood flow to the heart. A stable plaque may cause chest pain (<b>angina)</b> or breathlessness during exercise or at rest, or no symptoms at all. A ruptured plaque can block a blood vessel and lead to ischaemia of the heart muscle, causing unstable <b>angina</b> or a heart attack. In the worst case this may cause cardiac arrest, a sudden and utter loss of output from the heart. Obesity, high blood pressure, uncontrolled diabetes, smoking and high cholesterol can all increase the risk of developing atherosclerosis and coronary artery disease.|$|E
5|$|Toothache may {{be caused}} by dental (odontogenic) {{conditions}} (such as those involving the dentin-pulp complex or periodontium), or by non-dental (non-odontogenic) conditions (such as maxillary sinusitis or <b>angina</b> pectoris). There are many possible non-dental causes, {{but the vast majority of}} toothache is dental in origin.|$|E
5|$|Beginning around 1890, Rimsky-Korsakov {{suffered}} from <b>angina.</b> While this ailment initially wore him down gradually, the stresses concurrent with the 1905 Revolution {{and its aftermath}} greatly accelerated its progress. After December 1907, his illness became severe, {{and he could not}} work. In 1908 he died at his Lubensk estate near Luga (modern day Plyussky District of Pskov Oblast), and was interred in Tikhvin Cemetery at the Alexander Nevsky Monastery in Saint Petersburg, next to Borodin, Glinka, Mussorgsky and Stasov.|$|E
5|$|On {{the basis}} of symptoms, it is {{possible}} to distinguish HSP from hypersensitivity vasculitis (HV). In a series comparing 85 HSP patients with 93 HV patients, five symptoms were found to be indicative of HSP: palpable purpura, abdominal <b>angina,</b> digestive tract hemorrhage (not due to intussussception), hematuria and age less than 20. The presence of three or more of these indicators has an 87% sensitivity for predicting HSP.|$|E
5|$|The next morning, Sakae is {{discovered}} dead by Kenji and the Jinnouchis. Her youngest son Mansaku (Tadashi Nakamura) explains {{that she had}} <b>angina,</b> and that Love Machine had deactivated her heart monitor. Kenji, Sakuma, {{and most of the}} Jinnouchis initiate a plan to defeat Love Machine with a supercomputer using ice blocks as a coolant, while Natsuki and the others prepare a funeral for Sakae.|$|E
5|$|Wagner {{completed}} Parsifal in January 1882, and {{a second}} Bayreuth Festival was held for the new opera, which premiered on 26 May. Wagner was by this time extremely ill, having suffered a series of increasingly severe <b>angina</b> attacks. During the sixteenth and final performance of Parsifal on 29 August, he entered the pit unseen during act 3, took the baton from conductor Hermann Levi, and led the performance to its conclusion.|$|E
5|$|In February 1926, Andranik left Fresno {{to reside}} in San Francisco in an {{unsuccessful}} attempt to regain his health. According to his death certificate found in the Butte County, California records, Andranik died from <b>angina</b> on 31 August 1927 at Richardson Springs, California. On 7 September 1927, citywide public attention was accorded to him for his funeral in the Ararat Cemetery, Fresno. The New York Times reported that more than 2,500 members of the Armenian community attended memorial services in Carnegie Hall, New York City.|$|E
5|$|Low-dose aspirin use irreversibly {{blocks the}} {{formation}} of thromboxane A2 in platelets, producing an inhibitory effect on platelet aggregation during the lifetime of the affected platelet (8–9 days). This antithrombotic property makes aspirin useful for reducing the incidence of heart attacks in {{people who have had}} a heart attack, unstable <b>angina,</b> ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack. 40mg of aspirin a day is able to inhibit a large proportion of maximum thromboxane A2 release provoked acutely, with the prostaglandin I2 synthesis being little affected; however, higher doses of aspirin are required to attain further inhibition.|$|E
5|$|Accelerated {{deposition}} of cholesterol {{in the walls}} of arteries leads to atherosclerosis, the underlying cause of cardiovascular disease. The most common problem in FH {{is the development of}} coronary artery disease (atherosclerosis of the coronary arteries that supply the heart) at a much younger age than would be expected in the general population. This may lead to <b>angina</b> pectoris (chest pain or tightness on exertion) or heart attacks. Less commonly, arteries of the brain are affected; this may lead to transient ischemic attacks (brief episodes of weakness {{on one side of the}} body or inability to talk) or occasionally stroke. Peripheral artery occlusive disease (obstruction of the arteries of the legs) occurs mainly in people with FH who smoke; this can cause pain in the calf muscles during walking that resolves with rest (intermittent claudication) and problems due to a decreased blood supply to the feet (such as gangrene).|$|E
5|$|Pulpitis is {{classified}} as reversible when the pain is mild to moderate and lasts {{for a short time}} after a stimulus (for instance, cold or sweet); or irreversible when the pain is severe, spontaneous, and lasts a long time after a stimulus. Left untreated, pulpitis may become irreversible, then progress to pulp necrosis (death of the pulp) and apical periodontitis. Abscesses usually cause throbbing pain. The apical abscess usually occurs after pulp necrosis, the pericoronal abscess is usually associated with acute pericoronitis of a lower wisdom tooth, and periodontal abscesses usually represent a complication of chronic periodontitis (gum disease). Much less commonly, non-dental conditions can cause toothache, such as maxillary sinusitis, which can cause pain in the upper back teeth, or <b>angina</b> pectoris, which can cause pain in the lower teeth.|$|E
5|$|Susan and David {{defy the}} group and go check on Mr. Griffin. The two find him dead {{as a result of}} {{coronary}} arrest after being unable to take his medication for <b>angina.</b> Mark convinces {{the rest of the group}} to cover up the death. He instructs Susan, who was the last one known to the police to see Mr. Griffin, to tell them Mr. Griffin kept looking at his watch during the conference and left with a pretty woman. Jeff, Mark, and David bury the body in the mountains. Betsy and David also drive Mr. Griffin's car to the airport, but the officer who gave Betsy a ticket sees her there. Worried that the officer might later identify the car as Mr. Griffin's, Jeff and Betsy move the car into Jeff's garage so he can repaint it before they hide it elsewhere.|$|E
5|$|Tadalafil was {{initially}} formulated by Glaxo Wellcome (now GlaxoSmithKline) {{under a new}} drug development partnership between Glaxo and Icos that began in August1991. The drug was originally researched {{as a treatment for}} cardiovascular diseases such as hypertension and <b>angina,</b> but focus quickly shifted to ED with the success of another PDE5 inhibitor, sildenafil (Viagra), which had been developed by Pfizer. Icos began research on tadalafil in 1993, and clinical trials started two years later. Glaxo let the partnership with Icos lapse in 1996, including the company's 50% share of profits from resulting drugs, because the drugs in development were not in Glaxo's core markets. In 1998, Icos formed a 50/50 joint venture with Indianapolis-based Eli Lilly (Lilly Icos LLC) to develop and commercialize tadalafil as Cialis. The release of Cialis in the United States was delayed in April2002 when the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recommended that Icos perform more studies, improve labelling, and address manufacturing issues. Cialis was approved in Europe in November2002 and in the United States a year later. The drug was approved for once-daily use for ED in Europe in June2007 and in the United States in January2008.|$|E
5|$|When Tom goes missing, Darren {{is desperate}} to find him. Thinking that Tom has run away, he assumes {{that he will}} come home if Nancy is there and convinces Sienna to change her {{statement}} about Nancy. Nancy is released from the mental institute because of this. However, it is revealed that Sienna actually kidnapped Tom and kept him hostage in a basement. Tom is able to escape and along with Nancy, they expose Sienna for everything. Sienna attacks Nancy causing her to have temporary brain damage and attempts to kill Tom, Charlie and Oscar although they are saved and Nancy recovers. Following Darren's treatment of Nancy, things are hard between them and get even worse when Nancy attempts to get revenge on Darren. However, they eventually reconcile and get engaged again. However, things only get worse when Sienna blackmails Darren to get Tom to change his statement or she'll create even more problems for the Osbornes. Following a heart attack, Darren is given <b>angina</b> spray however Sienna takes this while Darren is on a camping trip and Nancy leaves him on his own on the trip following an argument. Darren starts {{to have a heart}} attack and Sienna, realizing what she's done, saves him at the last minute.|$|E
25|$|Worsening <b>angina</b> attacks, sudden-onset <b>angina</b> at rest, and <b>angina</b> lasting {{more than}} 15 minutes are {{symptoms}} of unstable <b>angina</b> (usually grouped with similar conditions as the acute coronary syndrome). As these may precede a heart attack, they require urgent medical attention and are, in general, treated {{in similar fashion}} to myocardial infarction.|$|E
25|$|In stable <b>angina,</b> the {{developing}} atheroma is protected with a fibrous cap. This cap may rupture in unstable <b>angina,</b> allowing blood clots to precipitate and further decrease {{the area of}} the coronary vessel's lumen. This explains why, in many cases, unstable <b>angina</b> develops independently of activity.|$|E
25|$|<b>Angina,</b> {{also known}} as <b>angina</b> pectoris, is chest pain or pressure, usually due to not enough {{blood flow to the}} heart muscle.|$|E
25|$|Also {{known as}} 'effort angina', this {{refers to the}} classic type of <b>angina</b> related to {{myocardial}} ischemia. A typical presentation of stable <b>angina</b> is that of chest discomfort and associated symptoms precipitated by some activity (running, walking, etc.) with minimal or non-existent symptoms at rest or after administration of sublingual nitroglycerin. Symptoms typically abate several minutes after activity and recur when activity resumes. In this way, stable <b>angina</b> may {{be thought of as}} being similar to intermittent claudication symptoms. Other recognized precipitants of stable <b>angina</b> include cold weather, heavy meals, and emotional stress.|$|E
25|$|In the United States, 10.2 {{million are}} {{estimated}} to experience <b>angina</b> with approximately 500,000 new cases occurring each year. <b>Angina</b> is more often the presenting symptom of coronary artery disease in women than in men. The prevalence of <b>angina</b> rises with increasing age, {{with a mean age}} of onset of 62.3 years. After five years post-onset, 4.8% of individuals with <b>angina</b> subsequently died from coronary heart disease. Men with <b>angina</b> were found to have an increased risk of subsequent acute myocardial infarction and coronary heart disease related death than women. Similar figures apply in the remainder of the Western world. All forms of coronary heart disease are much less-common in the Third World, as its risk factors are much more common in Western and Westernized countries; it could, therefore, be termed a disease of affluence. The adoption of a rich, Westernized diet and subsequent increase of smoking, obesity, and other risk factors has led to an increase in <b>angina</b> and related diseases in countries such as China.|$|E
25|$|Isosorbide mononitrate is a nitrate-class drug {{used for}} the {{prophylactic}} treatment of <b>angina</b> pectoris; that is, it is taken {{in order to prevent}} or at least reduce the occurrence of <b>angina.</b> Research on isosorbide mononitrate as a cervical ripener to reduce time at hospital to birth is supportive.|$|E
25|$|Atherosclerosis is {{the most}} common cause of {{stenosis}} (narrowing of the blood vessels) of the heart's arteries and, hence, <b>angina</b> pectoris. Some people with chest pain have normal or minimal narrowing of heart arteries; in these patients, vasospasm is a more likely cause for the pain, sometimes in the context of Prinzmetal's <b>angina</b> and syndrome X.|$|E
25|$|UA {{may occur}} unpredictably at rest, {{which may be}} a serious {{indicator}} of an impending heart attack. What differentiates stable <b>angina</b> from unstable <b>angina</b> (other than symptoms) is the pathophysiology of the atherosclerosis. The pathophysiology of unstable <b>angina</b> is the reduction of coronary flow due to transient platelet aggregation on apparently normal endothelium, coronary artery spasms, or coronary thrombosis. The process starts with atherosclerosis, progresses through inflammation to yield an active unstable plaque, which undergoes thrombosis and results in acute myocardial ischemia, which, if not reversed, results in cell necrosis (infarction). Studies show that 64% of all unstable anginas occur between 22:00 and 08:00 when patients are at rest.|$|E
25|$|Both PCI and CABG {{are more}} {{effective}} than medical management at relieving symptoms, (e.g. <b>angina,</b> dyspnea, fatigue).|$|E
25|$|Hospital {{admission}} {{for people}} with the following symptoms is recommended, as they may have unstable angina: pain at rest (which may occur at night), pain on minimal exertion, <b>angina</b> that seems to progress rapidly despite increasing medical treatment. All people with suspected <b>angina</b> should be urgently referred to a chest pain evaluation service, for confirmation of the diagnosis and assessment {{of the severity of}} coronary heart disease.|$|E
25|$|Late graft stenosis, {{particularly}} of saphenous vein grafts due to atherosclerosis causing recurrent <b>angina</b> or myocardial infarction.|$|E
25|$|Secondary {{prevention}} of myocardial infarction, stroke, unstable <b>angina,</b> and revascularization {{in people with}} established coronary heart disease.|$|E
25|$|<b>Angina</b> pectoris can {{be quite}} painful, but many {{patients}} with <b>angina</b> complain of chest discomfort rather than actual pain: the discomfort is usually described as a pressure, heaviness, tightness, squeezing, burning, or choking sensation. Apart from chest discomfort, anginal pains may also be experienced in the epigastrium (upper central abdomen), back, neck area, jaw, or shoulders. This is explained by the concept of referred pain, and {{is due to the}} fact that the spinal level that receives visceral sensation from the heart simultaneously receives cutaneous sensation from parts of the skin specified by that spinal nerve's dermatome, without an ability to discriminate the two. Typical locations for referred pain are arms (often inner left arm), shoulders, and neck into the jaw. <b>Angina</b> is typically precipitated by exertion or emotional stress. It is exacerbated by having a full stomach and by cold temperatures. Pain may be accompanied by breathlessness, sweating, and nausea in some cases. In this case, the pulse rate and the blood pressure increases. Chest pain lasting only a few seconds is normally not <b>angina</b> (such as precordial catch syndrome).|$|E
25|$|Nitroglycerin is {{used for}} the {{treatment}} of <b>angina,</b> acute myocardial infarction, severe hypertension, and acute coronary artery spasms.|$|E
25|$|Exertional <b>angina,</b> postmyocardial {{infarction}} {{with left}} ventricular dysfunction, congestive heart failure, or dependence on medication to control dysrhythmias.|$|E
25|$|However, the {{pathophysiology}} of <b>angina</b> {{in females}} varies significantly {{as compared to}} males. Non-obstructive coronary disease {{is more common in}} females.|$|E
25|$|The main {{goals of}} {{treatment}} in <b>angina</b> pectoris are relief of symptoms, slowing {{progression of the}} disease, and reduction of future events, especially heart attacks and death. Beta blockers (e.g., carvedilol, propranolol, atenolol) have {{a large body of}} evidence in morbidity and mortality benefits (fewer symptoms, less disability and longer life) and short-acting nitroglycerin medications have been used since 1879 for symptomatic relief of <b>angina.</b> Calcium channel blockers (such as nifedipine (Adalat) and amlodipine), isosorbide mononitrate and nicorandil are vasodilators commonly used in chronic stable <b>angina.</b> A new therapeutic class, called If inhibitor, has recently been made available: Ivabradine provides pure heart rate reduction leading to major anti-ischemic and antianginal efficacy. ACE inhibitors are also vasodilators with both symptomatic and prognostic benefit. Statins are the most frequently used lipid/cholesterol modifiers, which probably also stabilize existing atheromatous plaque. Low-dose aspirin decreases the risk of heart attack in patients with chronic stable <b>angina,</b> and was part of standard treatment. However, in patients without established cardiovascular disease, the increase in hemorrhagic stroke and gastrointestinal bleeding offsets any benefits and it is no longer advised unless the risk of myocardial infarction is very high.|$|E
25|$|Thomas Jones died in 1803; {{the cause}} of death was <b>angina</b> pectoris. He was buried at the family chapel at Caebach, Llandrindod Wells.|$|E
25|$|Thrombolytic {{drugs are}} {{contraindicated}} {{for the treatment}} of unstable <b>angina</b> and NSTEMI and {{for the treatment of}} individuals with evidence of cardiogenic shock.|$|E
25|$|GTN is {{also used}} in the {{treatment}} of anal fissures, though usually at a much lower concentration than that used for <b>angina</b> treatment.|$|E
25|$|Nadolol is used {{to treat}} {{hypertension}} and for long-term treatment of <b>angina</b> pectoris and is approved by the FDA for these purposes.|$|E
25|$|Major {{risk factors}} for <b>angina</b> include {{cigarette}} smoking, diabetes, high cholesterol, high blood pressure, sedentary lifestyle, and family history of premature heart disease.|$|E
25|$|A {{few other}} causes are rare, but {{possibly}} fatal, and include parapharyngeal space infections: peritonsillar abscess ("quinsy"), submandibular space infection (Ludwig's <b>angina),</b> and epiglottitis.|$|E
