The document detailed a number of “capability gaps”, which had been identified during the brigade′s training with Ukrainian troops that had experience fighting against Russian-backed forces in eastern Ukraine. The report described deficiencies in air defense and electronic warfare units {{as well as an}} over-reliance on satellite communications and GPS navigation systems. These are said to make the unit vulnerable to an enemy with high-end equipment and technology.|$|E

5|$|An <b>article</b> <b>published</b> in 1997 {{reported}} {{research of}} the mechanics of Apatosaurus tails by Nathan Myhrvold and paleontologist Philip J. Currie. Myhrvold carried out a computer simulation of the tail, which in diplodocids like Apatosaurus was a very long, tapering structure resembling a bullwhip. This computer modeling suggested sauropods were capable of producing a whiplike cracking sound of over 200 decibels, comparable to the volume of a cannon being fired.|$|E

An <b>article</b> <b>published</b> in The Atlantic in 2011 asserted that Sarria had also donated materials to the Smithsonian Institution.

5|$|In an <b>article</b> <b>published</b> on 8May several {{satellite}} experts {{questioned the}} analysis of satellite pings made by Inmarsat staff because the Doppler frequency shifts measured were apparently not properly corrected against the satellite's own drift (a periodic North-South oscillation of 3° every 24hours). Without any additional data being released, the implication of this new analysis was that the northern portion of the Inmarsat satellite pings arc could not be ruled out. The Malaysian government released the satellite data three weeks later.|$|E
5|$|Several {{publications}} re-reviewed {{the game}} later and re-evaluated their initial judgement. Black & White {{was selected by}} GameSpy as the most over-rated game of all time in an <b>article</b> <b>published</b> in September 2003, citing a lack of true interaction with the townspeople and poor use of the much-lauded creatures as reasons it disappointed.

5|$|Sources also {{disagree}} on the number rescued and final death toll. The official history of the ship gives 36 rescued and 336 dead, and the Navios de Guerra Brasileiros gives 36and 339.

The New York Times gave figures of 28saved and 347lost, while the St. Petersburg Times gave 32and 395. Sources do agree, however, that four American sound technicians were killed.|$|E

5|$|According to the US Department of Agriculture (USDA), {{the total}} number of animals used in the US during 2015 was 820,812, down from almost 1.2 million in 2005, however, this number does not include rats and mice, which make up around 90% of {{research}} animals. By comparing with EU data, where all vertebrate species are counted, Speaking of Research estimated that around 12 million vertebrates were used in research in the US in 2016. A 2015 <b>article</b> <b>published</b> in the Journal of Medical Ethics, argued that the use of animals in the US has dramatically increased in recent years. Researchers found this increase is largely the result of an increased reliance on genetically modified mice in animal studies.|$|E

He held several positions {{in the years that}} followed: White House Staff Assistant in 1971, Assistant Director of the Cost of Living Council from 1971–73, and Deputy Assistant to the president from 1974–1975. As deputy assistant, Cheney suggested several options in a memo to Rumsfeld, including use of the US Justice Department, that the Ford administration could use to limit damage from an <b>article,</b> <b>published</b> by The New York Times, in which investigative reporter Seymour Hersh reported that Navy submarines had tapped into Soviet undersea communications as part of a highly classified program, Operation Ivy Bells.|$|E

5|$|In 1969, she {{graduated}} with a Bachelor of Arts, with departmental honors in political science. After some fellow seniors requested that the college administration allow a student speaker at commencement, {{she became the first}} student in Wellesley College history to speak at the event. Her address followed that of commencement speaker Senator Edward Brooke. After her speech, she received a standing ovation that lasted seven minutes. She was featured in an <b>article</b> <b>published</b> in Life magazine, due to the response to a part of her speech that criticized Senator Brooke. She also appeared on Irv Kupcinet's nationally syndicated television talk show as well as in Illinois and New England newspapers. That summer, she worked her way across Alaska, washing dishes in Mount McKinley National Park and sliming salmon in a fish processing cannery in Valdez (which fired her and shut down overnight when she complained about unhealthful conditions).|$|E
5|$|In an <b>article</b> <b>published</b> on May 3, 2006, The New York Times {{addressed}} the controversy. The paper {{acknowledged that the}} mainstream media—itself included—had been criticized for focusing on Bush's act with Bridges while ignoring Colbert's speech. The paper then quoted several passages of Colbert's more substantial criticism {{of the president and}} discussed various reactions to the event. On May 15, The New York Times public editor, Byron Calame, wrote on his blog that more than two hundred readers had written to complain about the exclusion of any mention of Colbert from the paper's initial lengthy article covering the dinner. Calame quoted his deputy bureau chief in Washington, who said that a mention of Colbert in the first article could not have been long enough to do his routine justice. But he also noted that the paper should have printed an in-depth article specifically covering Colbert's speech in the same issue, rather than waiting until days after the fact.|$|E
5|$|In <b>article</b> <b>published</b> by the Guardian newspaper, the {{community}} importance of pirate radio was highlighted. Sanjae {{a young girl}} {{at the age of}} 3 was told she had just weeks to live due to a rare lung tissue disease. It would require at least £50.000 to send Sanjae to the US to have a life or death operation. A weekly popular talk show entitled the 'Nubian Forum talk show' which took place on the now deceased radio station, Power Jam FM raised awareness and began raising money. Within days two other pirate radio stations, Galaxy FM and Genesis FM joined forces to help; both of which helped raise thousands of pounds each. With the exception of the Hackney Gazette, no other mainstream media was interested. It is therefore argued that {{had it not been for}} Power Jam FM, Galaxy FM and Genesis FM, Sanjae would have died.|$|E

Methods: Observational study including all <b>articles</b> <b>published</b> in Gaceta Sanitaria during 2007 – 2011. We retrieved the number of citations from the ISI Web of Knowledge database in June 2013 and also information on other variables such as number of <b>articles</b> <b>published</b> by the corresponding author in the previous 5 years (searched through PubMed), selection for a press release, publication language, article type and topic, and others. Results: We included 542 articles. Of these, 62. 5 % were cited in the period considered. We observed an increased odds ratio of citations for articles selected for a press release and also with the number of <b>articles</b> <b>published</b> previously by the corresponding author. <b>Articles</b> <b>published</b> in English do not seem to increase their citations.
