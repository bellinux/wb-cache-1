5|$|<b>As</b> <b>the</b> <b>previous</b> {{storm was}} moving along the {{coastline}} {{of the southeastern}} United States, a new hurricane was observed in the western Caribbean Sea, about halfway between Honduras and Jamaica. Its intensity, based on a ship report, was estimated at 105mph (165km/h). The hurricane moved slowly west-northwestward, and another ship experienced its strong winds on October7. There were no further observations, so its complete track is unknown.|$|E

5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the Han dynasty, the Liu family associated its dynasty with the water phase <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>previous</b> Qin dynasty had done. By 104 BCE, to accompany the installment of the new Taichu Calendar (太初历), the Han court aligned itself with the earth phase to legitimately supplant the Qin's element. Yet by 26 CE (shortly after the downfall of Wang Mang) the new Eastern Han court made a retrospective argument that Han's element had always been fire.|$|E
5|$|Elihu Root, Austen Chamberlain, Charles G. Dawes, Frank B.

5|$|Eventually {{it became}} obvious, even to Ney, that cavalry alone were {{achieving}} little. Belatedly, he organised a combined-arms attack, using Bachelu's division and Tissot's regiment of Foy's division from Reille's II Corps (about 6,500infantrymen) plus those French cavalry that remained {{in a fit}} state to fight. This assault was directed along much the same route <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>previous</b> heavy cavalry attacks (between Hougoumont and La Haye Sainte). It was halted by a charge of the Household Brigade cavalry led by Uxbridge. The British cavalry were unable, however, to break the French infantry, and fell back with losses from musketry fire.|$|E

Chris Willis stated this tie was not as bad <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>previous</b> weeks because the Athletics had old players from the Akron Indians, a winning team in the Ohio League.|$|E

It was {{visible to the naked eye}} for a record 18months, twice as long <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>previous</b> record holder, the Great Comet of 1811. Accordingly, Hale–Bopp was dubbed the Great Comet of 1997.|$|E
5|$|Many fans wanted Snake Eater {{to use a}} 3D camera, {{but this}} was {{ultimately}} not implemented in the game. Kojima views Metal Gear Solid, Sons of Liberty and Snake Eater as a trilogy, and wished to keep the camera the same <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>previous</b> two {{in order to keep}} the feel of the three games the same. He did, however, acknowledge that the current trend for video games is to use the 3D camera. The camera was later implemented in an updated version of Snake Eater titled , and further installments in the franchise.|$|E
5|$|Survivor Series 1992 was {{attended}} by 17,500 fans, the same number <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>previous</b> year.

The pay-per-view buyrate was 1.4, which means that 1.4 percent of households to which the event was available purchased the pay-per-view. This was, to that point, the lowest buyrate in Survivor Series history and down more than one-third from the previous year's 2.2 buyrate. The buyrate was higher than that of any of the following twelve Survivor Series events, however.|$|E
