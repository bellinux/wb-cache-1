2500|$|Movies {{are treated}} {{separately}} {{by the law}} {{as part of the}} category [...] "audiovisual works". Russian law does not require [...] "moving images": according to Elst, a slide show may be a [...] "audiovisual work" [...] if its internal consistency amongst the images is high enough. The law does, however, require that the images be recorded somehow: a live television broadcast is not an <b>audiovisual</b> <b>work</b> (but is covered by the broadcaster's neighbouring rights). For movies, the law exhaustively enumerates all the initial copyright holders: the director, the author of the script, and the composer of the film music, if any. The law stipulates a transfer of the economic rights relating to publishing the film (including the rights to subtitling and redubbing) to the producer, unless the contract specifies otherwise. Although not considered authors, other individuals such as the camera director or the set designer do have a copyright on their individual works. They may exploit their works independently of the film: a set designer may authorize the use of the set design for a theatre production, and a composer retains his right to remuneration if the music is performed. If the authors or other co-creators of a movie are employed by the producer, their works are subject to the rules for employee-created works. In this case, all economic rights are transferred by default to the producer.|$|E

In the thesis, I mainly deal with Czech private law legislation, as regulated particularly in Act No. 121 / 2000 Coll., Copyright Act, as amended, and with regards to License Agreement in Act No. 89 / 2012 Coll., Civil Code, as amended, or other legal acts. In the first chapter, I focus on different sources of legal regulation of an <b>audiovisual</b> <b>works</b> and its historical development in public international law, secondary law of the EU and also in national legislation. In the second, third and fourth chapter, I elaborate on the defintion of the term "audiovisual work" and its author, {{as well as the}} term and author of a "work audiovisually used" and "performances audiovisually used. " These works and performances, together with audio records, constitute basic elements which <b>audiovisual</b> <b>works</b> might be composed of. In chapter five and six, I highlight the specific position of audio and audiovisual records producers and define the term of a "producer of audio record" and "producer of audiovisual record". Moreover, producers of an <b>audiovisual</b> <b>works</b> are given particular rights towards authors of works and performances audiovisually [...] ...|$|R
