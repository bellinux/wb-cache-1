5|$|The Irish and British {{authorities}} co-operated in the chartering of ships. They made combined {{purchases of}} wheat, maize, sugar, animal feeds and petrol. At {{the start of}} the war, Irish ships joined convoys protected by the Royal Navy. The advantages were protection <b>and</b> <b>cheaper</b> insurance. These advantages were not borne out by experience. So they chose to sail alone.|$|E

BNEF estimated that battery packs will require less than 1% of the known reserves of lithium, nickel, manganese, and copper through 2030, and 4% of the world’s cobalt. After 2030, the study states that new battery chemistries will probably shift to other source materials, making packs lighter, smaller, <b>and</b> <b>cheaper.</b>|$|E
5|$|Government family-friendly {{initiatives}} such {{as child}} subsidies <b>and</b> <b>cheaper</b> child care facilities can also greatly decrease the gender {{difference in the}} workplace, due to the woman being able to work longer hours outside the home.

5|$|In 1873 the Pekin duck was {{introduced}} to the United Kingdom. Although its meat was thought to have a poorer flavour than that of the Aylesbury duck, the Pekin was hardier <b>and</b> <b>cheaper</b> to raise. Many breeders switched to the Pekin duck or to Aylesbury-Pekin crosses. By the beginning of the 20th century competition from the Pekin duck, inbreeding, and disease in the pure-bred Aylesbury strain and the rising cost of duck food meant the Aylesbury duck industry was in decline.|$|E

5|$|Part of {{a larger}} {{beautification}} plan for the Midway Plaisance, Time was constructed from {{a new type of}} molded, steel-reinforced concrete that was claimed to be more durable <b>and</b> <b>cheaper</b> than alternatives. It was said to be the first of any kind of finished work of art made of concrete. Before the completion of Millennium Park in 2004, it was considered the most important installation in the Chicago Park District. Time is one of several Chicago works of art funded by Benjamin Ferguson's trust fund.|$|E
5|$|The {{monument}} {{was designed}} to commemorate the Duke of Wellington's victory at the Battle of Waterloo. Construction of the original design commenced in 1817; a revised <b>and</b> <b>cheaper</b> design was eventually used, though, and building was completed in 1854. It is now owned by the National Trust, who closed the monument {{to the public in}} 2007, owing to safety concerns. Surveys have shown that extensive renovation work will be needed to reopen the internal staircase to the viewing platform. As of 2015 the work is still ongoing.|$|E
5|$|Work on {{building}} a smaller <b>and</b> <b>cheaper</b> computer began in 1952, {{in parallel with}} Meg's ongoing development. Two of Kilburn's team, Richard Grimsdale and D. C.

Initially the only devices available were germanium point-contact transistors, less reliable than the valves they replaced but which consumed far less power.|$|E

She was easily distinguishable from her sister ship, , as the latter had straight masts and funnels, while those of York were angled to the rear. In addition, York also had a very tall bridge designed to clear the aircraft catapult originally planned to be carried on the superfiring ('B') gun turret forward.|$|E
5|$|Although 85% {{of world}} crude {{production}} was still coming from Pennsylvania wells in the 1880s, drilling in Russia and Asia began {{to reach the}} world market. Robert Nobel had established his own refining enterprise in the abundant <b>and</b> <b>cheaper</b> Russian oil fields, including the region's first pipeline and the world's first oil tanker. The Paris Rothschilds jumped into the fray providing financing. Additional fields were discovered in Burma and Java. Even more critical, {{the invention of the}} light bulb gradually began to erode the dominance of kerosene for illumination. But Standard Oil adapted, developing a European presence, expanding into natural gas production in the U.S. then into gasoline for automobiles, which until then had been considered a waste product.|$|E
5|$|At this distance, {{the land}} {{would be far}} beyond the maximum {{anticipated}} size of the city's growth, greatly reducing any potential hazards. The London and South Western Railway(LSWR)– which had connected London to Woking in 1838– would enable bodies and mourners to be shipped from London to the site easily and cheaply. Although the Brookwood site was a long distance from London, Broun and Sprye argued that {{the speed of the}} railway made it both quicker <b>and</b> <b>cheaper</b> to reach than the seven existing cemeteries, all of which required a slow and expensive horse-drawn hearse to carry the body and mourners from London to the burial site.|$|E
40|$|Software {{developers}} need {{to manage}} requirements. To do so, {{they can choose}} between “ultra-lightweight,” “lightweight, ” and “heavyweight ” requirements management tools. Ultra-lightweight tools are simple, flexible, <b>and</b> <b>cheap</b> but do not scale very well. Lightweight tools are also simple, flexible, <b>and</b> <b>cheap</b> but do not scale well. Heavyweight tools scale well, but are complex, inflexible, and costly. Problems with these tools are decreasing the quality and/or increasing the cost of non-trivial software development efforts.

5|$|Because amateur botany {{was popular}} in Britain {{during the second}} half of the eighteenth century, The Botanic Garden, despite its initial high cost, was a bestseller. In 1799 it was in a fourth edition as The Botanic Garden; A Poem in Two Parts at a smaller and more {{affordable}} octavo size, and this was another best-seller. There were three early Irish editions, and a second American edition had appeared by 1807. Despite the huge demand in 1799 and into the early 1800s, <b>and</b> <b>cheaper</b> pirated American and Irish imports, there was room in the market for another edition in Britain 1824 with a reprinting in 1825.|$|E
5|$|Business {{aviation}} {{has shown}} strong growth, although {{the numbers of}} aircraft on the UK register have declined. This reflects a shift away from turboprop aircraft towards foreign-registered business jets based in the UK, which {{are estimated to be}} growing in numbers. However, twin piston-engined aircraft numbers have declined significantly, reflecting pressures on the light air-taxi segment from increasingly flexible <b>and</b> <b>cheaper</b> scheduled services, and a more sophisticated corporate charter business. The amount of flight training conducted by UK schools has declined, largely at the hands of competition from foreign schools, which benefit from lower costs and better weather.|$|E
5|$|In 1856, {{the church}} inaugurated {{a system of}} {{handcart}} companies in order to enable poor European emigrants to make the trek more cheaply. Handcarts, two-wheeled carts that were pulled by emigrants instead of draft animals, were sometimes used as an alternate means of transportation from 1856 to 1860. They were seen as a faster, easier, <b>and</b> <b>cheaper</b> way to bring European converts to Salt Lake City. Almost 3,000 Mormons, with 653 carts and 50 supply wagons, traveling in 10 different companies, made the trip over the trail to Salt Lake City. While {{not the first to}} use handcarts, they were the only group to use them extensively.|$|E

5|$|In 1995, Square {{showed an}} {{interactive}} SGI technical demonstration of Final Fantasy VI for the then {{next generation of}} consoles. The demonstration used Silicon Graphics's prototype Nintendo 64 workstations to create 3D graphics. Fans believed the demo was of a new Final Fantasy title for the Nintendo 64 console; however, 1997 saw the release of Final FantasyVII for the Sony PlayStation. The switch was due to a dispute with Nintendo over its use of faster but more expensive cartridges, {{as opposed to the}} slower <b>and</b> <b>cheaper,</b> but much higher capacity Compact Discs used on rival systems. Final FantasyVII introduced 3D graphics with fully pre-rendered backgrounds. It was because of this switch to 3D that a CD-ROM format was chosen over a cartridge format. The switch also led to increased production costs and a greater subdivision of the creative staff for Final FantasyVII and subsequent 3D titles in the series.|$|E
5|$|Kinman {{claimed to}} have {{migrated}} to California in 1849 during the great Gold Rush {{and worked as a}} prospector in Pierson B. Reading's party on the Trinity River near present day Douglas City. He then returned to Illinois for two years. In 1852, he travelled to California and explored the Humboldt Bay area, near present day Eureka, California. Humboldt Bay had been recently rediscovered by gold miners seeking a faster <b>and</b> <b>cheaper</b> route to transport supplies. An early settlement in the area was also named Uniontown, but is now known as Arcata. During this period, prospectors and their suppliers were often flush with gold, but had little to spend it on.|$|E
5|$|Lead {{production}} designer Richard Hudolin flew to Los Angeles, 1996 {{to gather}} material from Stargate for reference {{and found the}} original film prop stored outside in the Californian desert. Although the prop had severely disintegrated, he could take a detailed mould for Stargate SG-1 production to build its own prop. The new Stargate was engineered to turn, lock the chevrons, and be computer-controlled to dial specific gate addresses. A portable Stargate prop was built for on-location shoots and required six workers and one full day to set up. Since visual effects are sometimes faster <b>and</b> <b>cheaper,</b> a computer-generated Stargate was occasionally used in on-location shoots in later seasons.|$|E
