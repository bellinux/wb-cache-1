25|$|The {{following}} year, Mickelson captured {{his second}} major at the 2005 PGA Championship at Baltusrol, in a Monday final-round conclusion {{that had been}} forced by inclement weather the previous day. On the 18th hole, Mickelson hit one of his trademark soft pitches from deep greenside rough to within <b>a</b> <b>foot</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>half</b> (0.45 m) of the cup, and made his birdie to finish at a 4-under-par total of 276, one shot ahead of Steve Elkington and Thomas Bjørn.|$|E
25|$|In 1992 Lowe was {{commissioned}} by the Minnesota Arts Commission for Cloquet Community College. The sculpture sits within a large grouping of pine trees, made of polished stainless steel it hovers <b>a</b> <b>foot</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>half</b> above the ground, intertwining through the trees like a stream. Utilized as a bench, large rocks are also placed underneath from nearby riverbeds to be glimpsed at under thin slits cut into the steel to represent the flowing of the water.|$|E
25|$|Telescopic {{fishing rods}} are {{designed}} to collapse down to a short length and open to a long rod. 20 or even 30ft rods can close to as little as <b>a</b> <b>foot</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>half.</b> This makes the rods very easy to transport to remote areas or travel on buses, compact cars, or public buses and subways. Telescopic fishing rods are made from the same materials as conventional multi-piece rods. Graphite, carbon, and sometimes fibreglass, or composites of these materials, {{are designed to}} slip into each other so that they open and close. The eyes on the spinning rods are generally, but not always, a special design to aid in making {{the end of each}} section stronger. Various grade eyes available in conventional rods are also available in telescopic fishing rods. The eyeless Tenkara style rods are also of this type and are typically made from carbon and/or graphite.|$|E

500|$|Shane Rangi as Asterius the Minotaur and Josh Campbell as {{the voice}} of Asterius. An elderly minotaur who aids Caspian. He is killed during the raid while holding the gate open to allow some of the army to escape. Rangi also stood in for Aslan, the Bulgy Bear, the Werewolf, another Minotaur, and the Wild Bear on set. Rangi played General Otmin in the {{previous}} film and Tavros in The Voyage of The Dawn Treader. He was able to see more in the redesigned animatronic minotaur heads, though [...] "in order to make the eye line straight and correct, you've actually got to hold your head down, so your view is only about <b>a</b> <b>foot</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>half</b> in front of you, which still makes it a little bit hard". This resulted in Rangi knocking himself against the rising gate of the Telmarine castle, although he was fine and it was the animatronic head that bore the brunt of the damage. The costumes were still very hot, reducing him to a [...] "walking waterfall". Although a head sculpt of Aslan was used to stand in for the character on the first film, Rangi had to portray the character on set because Lucy interacts with him more. Rangi lost four kilograms wearing all his costumes.|$|E
500|$|St Stephen's Chapel {{remained}} largely unchanged until 1692 when Sir Christopher Wren, {{at the time}} the Master of the King's Works, was instructed to make structural alterations. He lowered the roof, removed the stained glass windows, put in a new floor and covered the original gothic architecture with wood panelling. He also added galleries from which the public could watch proceedings. The result was described by one visitor to the chamber as [...] "dark, gloomy, and badly ventilated, and so small... when an important debate occurred... the members were really to be pitied". When the future Prime Minister William Ewart Gladstone remembered his arrival as a new MP in 1832, he recounted [...] "What I may term corporeal conveniences were... marvellously small. I do not think that in any part of the building it afforded the means of so much as washing the hands." [...] The facilities were so poor that, in debates in 1831 and 1834, Joseph Hume, a Radical MP, called for new accommodation for the House, while his fellow MP William Cobbett asked [...] "Why are we squeezed into so small a space that it is absolutely impossible that there should be calm and regular discussion, even from circumstance alone... Why are 658 of us crammed into a space that allows each of us no more than <b>a</b> <b>foot</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>half</b> square?" ...|$|E

"The President, who was <b>a</b> <b>foot</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>half</b> {{taller and}} a hundred pounds heavier than George, struck him a resounding clap {{on the back and}} caught his hand in an immense fist. Wrenching George's arm up and down with a pumping motion that might have drawn oil from a dry Texas well, Johnson congratulated him on the briefing, and on his {{services}} to the country and its voters. As he released George, he said, 'Anytime {{you want to talk to}} me, just pick up the phone and come over.' It was a vintage LBJ performance." ...|$|E

50|$|Ascender - These {{are used}} to ascend ropes. Devices that used lever cams were once used, though these have now been {{overtaken}} in popularity by toothed cam devices which slip less. A minimum of two ascenders are used, one attached to the harness at waist level, and another attached to <b>a</b> footloop <b>and</b> moved by hand. A third ascender may be attached to <b>a</b> <b>foot</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> ropewalking technique used.|$|R
2500|$|In {{the middle}} of the room is placed a vessel of about <b>a</b> <b>foot</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>half</b> high which is called here a [...] "baquet". It is so large that twenty people can easily sit round it; near the edge of the lid which covers it, there are holes pierced [...] {{corresponding}} to the number of persons who are to surround it; into these holes are introduced iron rods, bent at right angles outwards, and of different heights, so as to answer to the part of the body to which they are to be applied. Besides [...] these rods, there is a rope which communicates between the baquet and one of the patients, and from him is carried to another, and so on the whole round. [...] The most sensible effects are produced on the approach of Mesmer, who is said to convey the fluid by certain motions of his hands or eyes, without touching the person. I have talked with several who have witnessed these effects, who have convulsions occasioned and removed by a movement of the hand...|$|E
2500|$|Hirsh {{had good}} leverage, pitched down to hitters, {{and had a}} refined {{repertoire}} of pitches. [...] He had a [...] "plus" [...] 2-seam fastball that had sink and good movement at 91–94mph, and threw a [...] "filthy" [...] hard-breaking slider that was consistently precise, and had bite at 80–86mph (managers rated it the best breaking ball in the Texas League). [...] Hirsh continued to refine his moderate changeup, which had fair deception and movement in the low-80s. [...] He also threw a 4-seam fastball in the 94–96mph range. [...] He was not afraid to pitch inside, and threw strikes to {{both sides of the}} plate. [...] "I'm 6-foot-8 and I keep a high three-quarters arm angle," [...] noted Hirsh. [...] "You figure the mound is <b>a</b> <b>foot</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>half,</b> and my arm may be another two, three, four feet. [...] It makes the batter have to look up instead of straight at me, and he may have a difficult time adjusting." [...] During the 2007 season, Hirsh had trouble throwing his fastball enough. Pitching coach Bob Apodaca gave this assessment of Hirsh before 2008: [...] "All Jason has to do is trust his stuff. [...] He has the type of fastball you work off, but he was using his fastball the way you'd use an off-speed pitch —- to try and trick hitters." ...|$|E

[...] The wings were permanently bent upwards by , the inboard main landing gear lost two actuator doors, and the two inboard main gear struts were left dangling. Most affected was the tail, where large outer parts of the horizontal stabilizer had been ripped off. [...] The entire left outboard elevator had been lost along with its actuator, which had been powered by the hydraulic system that ruptured and drained.|$|R
50|$|The {{body was}} {{discovered}} by commercial peat cutters in 1952, and is now on display at The Landesmuseum at the Schloß Gottorf in Schleswig, Germany. Unfortunately, {{by the time the}} body was noticed by the peat cutters, and before the peat-cutting machinery could be shut down, <b>a</b> hand, <b>a</b> <b>foot,</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> leg had been severed from the body. The body had been very well preserved by the peat, and despite this damage it is still an important archaeological discovery. Shortly after the discovery of Windeby I, another bog body (an adult male) was found nearby and dubbed Windeby II.|$|R
