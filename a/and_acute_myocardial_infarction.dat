INTRODUCTION: The {{purpose of this study was}} to compare the trends and epidemiological characteristics of hospitalizations for MOF and other frequent diseases between years  2000 and 2008 in Switzerland. METHODS: Trends in the number, age-standardized incidence, mean LOS, and cost of hospitalized MOF <b>and</b> MCE (<b>acute</b> <b>myocardial</b> <b>infarction,</b> stroke, <b>and</b> heart failure) were compared in women and men aged ≥ 45  years, based on data from the Swiss Federal Statistical Office. RESULTS: Between 2000 and 2008, the incidence of acute hospitalizations for MOF increased by 3. 4 % in women and 0. 3 % in men. In both sexes, a significant decrease in hip fractures (- 15. 0 % and - 11. 0 %) was compensated by a concomitant, significant increase in nonhip fractures (+ 24. 8 % and + 13. 8 %). Similarly, the incidence of acute hospitalizations for MCE increased by 4. 4 % in women and 8. 2 % in men, as an aggregated result from significantly increasing <b>acute</b> <b>myocardial</b> <b>infarctions</b> <b>and</b> significantly decreasing strokes. While the mean LOS in the acute inpatient setting decreased almost linearly between years  2000 and 2008 in all indications, the inpatient costs increased significantly (p[*]<[*] 0. 001) for MOF (+ 30. 1 % and + 42. 7 %) and MCE (+ 22. 6 % and + 47. 1 %) in women and men, respectively.
