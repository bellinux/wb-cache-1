She allowed the property to fall into disrepair {{and by the time}} of her death in 1961 it was in <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>poor</b> condition. It was then purchased by the National Trust and leased to the John Lewis Partnership, who restored it over many years. In the 21st century it is still used by the Partnership as a corporate hotel for their employees and retired staff.|$|E

5|$|Thyroid cancers {{are treated}} by {{removing}} the whole or part of thyroid gland. Radioactive Iodine 131 may be given to radioablate the thyroid. Thyroxine is given to replace the hormones lost and to suppress TSH production, as TSH may stimulate recurrence. With {{the exception of the}} rare anaplastic thyroid cancer, which carries <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>poor</b> prognosis, most thyroid cancers carry an excellent prognosis and can even be considered curable.|$|E
5|$|Like solid bromine and iodine, solid {{chlorine}} crystallises in the orthorhombic crystal system, in a layered lattice of Cl2 molecules. The Cl–Cl {{distance is}} 198pm (close to the gaseous Cl–Cl distance of 199pm) and the Cl···Cl distance between molecules is 332pm within a layer and 382pm between layers (compare the van der Waals radius of chlorine, 180pm). This structure means that chlorine is <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>poor</b> conductor of electricity, and indeed its conductivity {{is so low}} as to be practically unmeasurable.|$|E
5|$|Like solid {{chlorine}} and iodine, solid bromine crystallises in the orthorhombic crystal system, in a layered lattice of Br2 molecules. The Br–Br {{distance is}} 227pm (close to the gaseous Br–Br distance of 228pm) and the Br···Br distance between molecules is 331pm within a layer and 399pm between layers (compare the van der Waals radius of bromine, 195pm). This structure means that bromine is <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>poor</b> conductor of electricity, with a conductivity of around 5×10−13Ω−1cm−1 {{just below the}} melting point, although this {{is better than the}} essentially undetectable conductivity of chlorine.|$|E

5|$|The 2007 defence {{of the cup}} in France got off to <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>poor</b> start, with a {{below par}} victory over the United States and a heavy 36–0 defeat to South Africa leaving the holders {{on the brink of}} {{elimination}} at the group stage. Improved performances against Samoa and Tonga saw England again reach the knockout stages as pool runners-up, before a surprise 12–10 defeat of Australia in Marseille and a narrow 14–9 victory over the host nation France carried England to a second successive final appearance. The final was played in Paris on 20 October against South Africa, who won by 15 points to 6.|$|E
5|$|Another {{prominent}} {{church in}} the capital, the Church of the Holy Apostles, which had been in <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>poor</b> state {{near the end of}} the 5th century, was likewise rebuilt. Works of embellishment were not confined to churches alone: excavations at the site of the Great Palace of Constantinople have yielded several high-quality mosaics dating from Justinian's reign, and a column topped by a bronze statue of Justinian on horseback and dressed in a military costume was erected in the Augustaeum in Constantinople in 543. Rivalry with other, more established patrons from the Constantinopolitan and exiled Roman aristocracy (like Anicia Juliana) might have enforced Justinian's building activities in the capital as a means of strengthening his dynasty's prestige.|$|E
5|$|Benchley {{started at}} the Tribune as a reporter. He was <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>poor</b> one, unable to get {{statements}} from people quoted in other papers, and eventually had greater success covering lectures around the city. He was promised a position at the Tribunes Sunday magazine when it launched, and he {{was moved to the}} magazine's staff soon after he was hired, eventually becoming chief writer. He wrote two articles a week: the first a review of non-literary books, the other a feature-style article about whatever he wanted. The liberty gave his work new life, and the success of his pieces in the magazine convinced his editors to give him a signed byline column in the Tribune proper.|$|E

5|$|In 2015, {{pancreatic}} cancers of {{all types}} resulted in 411,600 deaths globally. Pancreatic cancer is the fifth {{most common cause of}} death from cancer in the United Kingdom, and the fourth most common in the United States. The disease occurs most often in the developed world, where about 70% of the new cases in 2012 originated. Pancreatic adenocarcinoma typically has <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>poor</b> prognosis: after diagnosis, 25% of people survive one year and 5% live for five years. For cancers diagnosed early, the five-year survival rate rises to about 20%. Neuroendocrine cancers have better outcomes; at five years from diagnosis, 65% of those diagnosed are living, though survival varies considerably {{depending on the type of}} tumor.|$|E
5|$|In the 1969–70 FA Cup quarter final, Liverpool {{played against}} {{struggling}} Second Division side Watford at Vicarage Road and lost 1–0 after <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>poor</b> performance. The Liverpool site records that the defeat signalled {{the end for}} St John, Hunt, Byrne, Yeats and Lawrence; the incomers included Ray Clemence, Alec Lindsay, Larry Lloyd, John Toshack, Brian Hall and Steve Heighway. Apart from Hall who graduated through the reserves, they were all signed from clubs in lower divisions or even, {{in the case of}} Heighway, from non-league football. Adding the new players to Tommy Smith, Ian Callaghan, Chris Lawler and Emlyn Hughes, Shankly formed the nucleus of a second great team which went on to dominate English and European football in the 1970s.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} evening Hare took the stand to give evidence. Under {{cross-examination}} about the murder of Docherty, Hare claimed Burke had been the sole murderer and McDougal had twice been involved by bringing Docherty {{back to the house}} after she had run out; Hare stated that he had assisted Burke in the delivery of the body to Knox. Although he was asked about other murders, he was not obliged to answer the questions, as the charge related only to the death of Docherty. After Hare's questioning, his wife entered the witness box, carrying their baby daughter who was suffering from whooping cough. Margaret used the child's coughing fits as a way to give herself thinking time for some of the questions, and told the court that she had <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>poor</b> memory and could not remember many of the events.|$|E

5|$|When the Whitlam Government came {{to power}} in late 1972, the CMF was in <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>poor</b> state. The new {{government}} moved quickly to end conscription, and this caused the CMF's strength to fall by roughly 5,000 to 23,119 by June 1973. In 1973 a committee of inquiry into the CMF was announced, under the chairmanship of Dr. T.B Millar and the subsequent report developed from this inquiry became known as the Millar Report. Far from being a vehicle of the Regular Army to denigrate the CMF as some opponents predicted, the report did much to highlight many of the conceptual and structural problems that the CMF was afflicted by at the time, however, {{the way in which the}} government chose to implement the recommendations, and indeed the way in which some of them were allowed to lapse, ultimately served to at least partially justify some of the cynicism voiced in certain CMF circles about the report.|$|E
5|$|Nojpetén fell to a Spanish {{assault on}} 13 March 1697, more than 150 {{years after the}} conquest {{of the rest of}} the Yucatán Peninsula and more than 160 years after the conquest of the Guatemalan Highlands. The lengthy delay in conquering the Petén region was due to a {{combination}} of its geographical remoteness and inhospitality and the fierce reputation of its Maya inhabitants. During this time the Itza used the Yalain as an eastern buffer against Spanish approach from Belize. The lengthy indirect contact between the Itza and the Spanish invaders allowed the Itza to develop an understanding of Spanish strategy and tactics that was honed over the period of almost two centuries that the Itza were surrounded by European-dominated territories. This understanding distinguished the conquest of Petén from the 16th-century conquests of the Aztecs, Maya and Incas. In contrast, the Spanish had <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>poor</b> understanding of the Itza and their neighbours and viewed them as ignorant savages whose kingdom was protected by Satan from the Christianising efforts of the Spanish Empire and the Roman Catholic Church. From the time that Hernán Cortés crossed Petén in the early 16th century, the Spanish mistakenly believed the king of the Itza (the Aj Kan Ek) was the overlord of the entire central Petén region.|$|E

40|$|Attribute grammars are well-designed to {{construct}} complex algorithms by composing several ones together. Actually, {{there exists a}} powerful transformation called descriptional composition which highly simplifies the composition of two attribute grammars by removing useless intermediate constructions. However, most of non-linear algorithms can not be expressed with attribute grammars. Thus, many compositions can not be simplified by the descriptional composition. In this paper, we present Equational Semantics, a formalism largely inspired by attribute grammars but where nonlinear algorithms can be encoded. More precisely, instead of being restricted to one input static tree {{as it is the}} case for attribute grammars, an algorithm encoded with Equational Semantics may use dynamically constructed trees. This formalism consists in <b>an</b> <b>very</b> <b>poor</b> abstract syntax. We present its semantics and some of its transformations such as partial evaluation and descriptional composition (also called defores [...] ...|$|R
25|$|The {{principal}} rock of {{the park}} is the granite of Nordingrå, the park belonging to the Nordingrå massif. It consists of a rapakivi granite, formed about 1500 million years ago.

To the north-east {{of the park}}, one can also find diabase, which was formed 1200 million {{years ago in the}} faults of the Nordingrå massif. Since granite forms <b>a</b> substrate <b>very</b> <b>poor</b> in nutrients, the diabase constitutes by contrast <b>a</b> <b>very</b> fertile terrain, which permits a richer vegetation.|$|R
