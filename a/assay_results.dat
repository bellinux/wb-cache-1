25|$|When {{multiple}} assays {{measure the}} same target their results and utility {{may or may}} not be comparable depending on the natures of the assay and their methodology, reliability etc. Such comparisons are possible through study of general quality attributes of the assays e.g. principles of measurement (including identification, amplification and detection), dynamic range of detection (usually the range of linearity of the standard curve), analytic sensitivity, functional sensitivity, analytic specificity, positive, negative predictive values, turn around time i.e. time taken to finish a whole cycle from the preanalytic steps till the end of the last post analytic step (report dispatch/transmission), throughput i.e. number of assays done per unit time (usually expressed as per hour) etc. Organizations or laboratories that perform Assays for professional purposes e.g. medical diagnosis and prognostics, environmental analysis, forensic proceeding, pharmaceutical research and development must undergo well regulated quality assurance procedures including method validation, regular calibration, analytical quality control, proficiency testing, test accreditation, test licensing and must document appropriate certifications from the relevant regulating bodies in order to establish the reliability of their assays, especially to remain legally acceptable and accountable for the quality of the <b>assay</b> <b>results</b> and also to convince customers to use their assay commercially/professionally.|$|E

2500|$|In 1991, Gwen Resources Limited {{performed}} a detailed program of diamond drilling, geological mapping, trenching and surveying at Beanland. After {{this work was}} completed, a 3,392 ton bulk sample was taken from an open pit in January 1992 to confirm old <b>assay</b> <b>results</b> on the Beanland Vein. Equipment consisted of a Caterpillar D6, a Gardner-Denver hydraulic track drill and a John Deere backhoe to remove the blasted material. The extracted ore was shipped to the Kerr-Addison Mine mill in Virginiatown for processing. All of the ore was stockpiled in the mill yard rather than being directly dumped into the crusher and therefore directly into the mill. Because the ore was stockpiled, where it froze {{and had to be}} blasted, it was handled twice which put up the costs of the milling. The mill results were not as high as expected. It was discovered that the ore had a higher percentage in silver than gold. The cause of this was probably due to a deposit of silver hidden in the very high erratic values of gold and silver. Such an occurrence is quite common in the Cobalt-Temagami area. Since the bulk sample was taken in January 1992, it was very cold and experienced a lot of dilution of ore due to overload of holes. Because of the cold weather, the test pit had to be [...] wide. Beanland Mine has remained idle since 1992.|$|E

40|$|In a {{study of}} the use of a digoxin assay service and its {{influence}} on clinical management 285 assay requests were audited over 12 weeks.

Of samples collected within six hours after the last dose, 15 of 69 (22 %) led to a reduction in treatment compared with 10 of 116 (9 %) taken after six hours (p less than 0. 025), thereby highlighting the danger that incorrectly timed samples may lead to inappropriate clinical decisions...|$|R
