5|$|Also in 1939, Campbell {{started the}} fantasy {{magazine}} Unknown (later Unknown Worlds). Although Unknown was canceled after only four years, <b>a</b> <b>victim</b> of wartime paper shortages, the magazine's editorial direction was {{significant in the}} evolution of modern fantasy.|$|E
5|$|It is {{impossible}} to judge the truth of these diary entries, but Reich's second daughter, the psychiatrist Lore Reich Rubin, told Christopher Turner that she believed Reich had been <b>a</b> <b>victim</b> of child sexual abuse, and that this explained his lifelong interest in sex and childhood sexuality.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to provide a brief review of victims 2 ̆ 7 rights from a {{historical}} and legal perspective. Most importantly, I will also provide a template for planning <b>a</b> <b>victims</b> 2 ̆ 7 rights week event. I explore legislation pertaining to victims 2 ̆ 7 rights and victims 2 ̆ 7 rights week programs in the community, and provide an outline for the planning and execution of <b>a</b> local <b>victims</b> 2 ̆ 7 rights week event. Although, sample events held in Idaho are utilized, as examples of how <b>a</b> <b>victims</b> 2 ̆ 7 rights week event might be conducted, the plan here is to develop <b>a</b> <b>victims</b> 2 ̆ 7 rights week template that is generalizable to a medium sized metropolitan area, which includes a diverse population and a major university...|$|R

5|$|Two unassisted triple plays {{were turned}} at Forbes Field. The first {{took place on}} May 7, 1925, when Pittsburgh's Glenn Wright {{achieved}} the feat. Two seasons later, in 1927, Jimmy Cooney—who had been <b>a</b> <b>victim</b> of the first triple play—also acquired three outs by himself.|$|E
5|$|A 1999–2005 Australian police {{survey of}} detainees {{reported}} preliminary findings that self-reported users of benzodiazepines {{were less likely}} than non-user detainees to work full-time {{and more likely to}} receive government benefits, use methamphetamine or heroin, and be arrested or imprisoned. Benzodiazepines are sometimes used for criminal purposes; they serve to incapacitate <b>a</b> <b>victim</b> in cases of drug assisted rape or robbery.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} lives of Edward {{were written in}} the centuries {{following}} his death {{in which he was}} portrayed as a martyr, generally seen as <b>a</b> <b>victim</b> of the Queen Dowager Ælfthryth, mother of Æthelred. He is today recognized as a saint in the Eastern Orthodox Church, the Roman Catholic Church, and the Anglican Communion.|$|E

5|$|An {{attacker}} having gained authentication material may impersonate the material's owner {{after the}} victim has patched Heartbleed, {{as long as}} the material is accepted (for example, until the password is changed or the private key revoked). Heartbleed therefore constitutes a critical threat to confidentiality. However, an attacker impersonating <b>a</b> <b>victim</b> may also alter data. Indirectly, Heartbleed's consequences may thus go far beyond a confidentiality breach for many systems.|$|E
5|$|Another source may be Aesop's Fables as {{published}} by William Caxton—scholar John MacQueen considers this {{more likely than}} Disciplina clericalis—although the tale itself is not Aesopic but rather of the beast fable (also beast-epic) genre. The plots of such works are more complicated than their Aesopic counterpart, tend more towards ribaldry, and feature the fox making <b>a</b> <b>victim</b> of the wolf.|$|E
5|$|Competition from {{road traffic}} {{starting}} {{in the early twentieth}} century put pressure on the railway, and it was later <b>a</b> <b>victim</b> of the Beeching cuts.

5000|$|To {{put things}} in perspective, most anti-personnel blast mines (e.g. the VS-50) contain around 50 grams of explosive, which is enough to destroy {{all or part of}} <b>a</b> <b>victim's</b> foot. In marked contrast, the 300 gram charge inside a Gyata-64 mine can easily destroy <b>a</b> <b>victim's</b> entire leg (often {{requiring}} amputation high above the knee) in addition to inflicting severe injuries on the adjacent limb, which may also require some form of amputation.|$|R
5|$|Continuation Bond author Raymond Benson sees Vivienne Michel as {{the best}} {{realised}} female characterisation undertaken by Fleming, partly because {{the story is told}} in the first person narrative. Academic Jeremy Black notes that Michel is the closest Fleming gets to kitchen sink realism in the Bond canon: she has been <b>a</b> <b>victim</b> of life in the past, but is wilful and tough, too.|$|E
5|$|Critical {{commentary}} {{appeared in}} the media concerning the knighthood awarded to John Armitt in the 2012 New Year Honours for services to engineering and construction.
