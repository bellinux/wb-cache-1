500|$|When Zhou is vocalized in [...] "Yangzhou storytelling", {{he speaks}} in [...] "Square mouth public talk", which is <b>a</b> <b>manner</b> <b>of</b> <b>speaking</b> {{reserved}} for martial heroes, highly respected characters, or, sometimes, lesser characters that pretend {{to be an important}} hero. Square mouth public talk is actually a mixture of two forms of dialogue: Fangkou and Guanbai. Fangkou (square mouth) is a manner of steady, yet forceful over pronunciation of dialogue that was possibly influenced by Northern Chinese opera. Guanbai (public talk) is monologue and dialogue that is sometimes used for [...] "imposing heroes". This mixture of styles means Zhou Tong is treated as a highly regarded hero.|$|E
500|$|Throughout {{the latter}} part of Speer's imprisonment, Wolters was a {{faithful}} correspondent, writing lengthy letters to Speer at least once a month, attempting to tell Speer everything that might interest him but nothing that might hurt him. [...] When Speer invented the concept of his [...] "world wide walk", imagining his daily exercise around the prison yard to be segments in a long walk from Europe through Asia to North America, Wolters supplied Speer with details of what he would [...] "see". [...] Speer later stated, [...] "In <b>a</b> <b>manner</b> <b>of</b> <b>speaking,</b> Rudi Wolters accompanied me on these walks." [...] As midnight struck and October 1, 1966 began, Speer was released from Spandau Prison. [...] His last use of the clandestine message system was to have a telegram sent to Wolters, in which Speer jokingly asked Wolters to pick him up thirty-fivekilometres south of Guadalajara, Mexico, which he had [...] "reached" [...] after walking 31,936kilometres.|$|E
