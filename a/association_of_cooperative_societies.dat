40|$|The National Development Plan for 1983 to 1988 {{called for}} {{improvements}} in {{the standard of living}} of fisheries communities, and a more equitable distribution of the economic benefits accruing from fisheries activities. The Government has pledged its support to cooperative action, following the establishment of the Barbados National <b>Association</b> <b>of</b> <b>Cooperative</b> <b>Societies</b> (BARNACS), and the upsurge of cooperative awareness in the country, as a way of achieving these goalsAt the request of the Government, project TCP/BAR/ 6753 conducted a viability study for the establishment of fishery cooperatives, so as to determine the activities in which they should engage, and to elaborate technical and financial support and development activities. The project had necessarily {{to take into account the}} present overall fisheries situation and likely future developments. The most crucial issue facing the ice-boat fleet, and therefore the active fishing industry in Barbados, was to ensure continued access to resources in foreign waters, where the bulk of the catch is obtained; it was therefore recommended that no effort be spared to negotiate and conclude acceptable long-term fishing agreements with Trinidad and Tobago, and Grenada. It was also recommended that the Government establish a policy of limiting the issue of fishing vessel licences according to the quantity of fish available, and expedite the adoption of the proposed new legislation amending the current Fisheries ActBefore engaging in any further development activities, it was recommended that the Barbados Fishing Cooperative (BFC) thoroughly analyse its current situation, and address the major weaknesses from which it currently suffers. It was not recommended that the BFC pursue its initial goal of uniting day-boat and ice-boat owners into a single body, because of their different patterns of operation, and divergent economic objectives. Nor it was recommended that the BFC admit processors, vendors, and even fishermen who are not boat-owners, to membership, which was currently allowed by its by-laws: there was a marked conflict of interests between the specialized operators, and an attempt to unite them would, in all likelihood, make the cooperative unmanageable. It was proposed, instead, that sailor-fishermen belong to a workers' union, and that processors and vendors have their own separate organizatio...|$|E
40|$|The need {{to improve}} the {{production}} of shear butter {{as a means of}} sustainable livelihood and monetary income for rural dwellers in the nation necessitated this study. The factors associated with shea butter processing were assessed in this study. Interview schedule was employed to elicit information from the respondents. Structured interview schedule was administered to 160 randomly sampled shear butter processors in Kwara State. Data obtained were subjected to descriptive and inferential statistics. Results of the study revealed that majority of the processors were females, elderly, married with little or no formal education. They had large household size with shea butter processing being their primary occupation. Processing techniques adopted by respondents were rudimentary, laborious and time consuming. Processors identified rainfall as a very important climatic factor, knowledge of improved technologies as a very important factor, access to credit facilities as a germane economic factor, availability of water as a very important physical factor associated with Shea butter processing. Insufficient water, bad road networks and lack of credit were very severe constraint among the respondents. There is thus the need by the state government to provide more basic infrastructural facilities like water, electricity, rural feeder roads to enhance the capacity of Shea butter processors. <b>Association</b> <b>of</b> respondents with <b>cooperative</b> <b>societies</b> should be encouraged through extension education to boost their productivity in meeting up with the demands for domestic consumption, export and family bill...|$|R

These changes did not fit the legal definition of a kibbutz, and in particular, the principle of equality in consumption. Consequently, the registrar <b>of</b> <b>cooperative</b> <b>societies,</b> who has the authority to register and classify <b>cooperative</b> <b>societies,</b> should change the classification of kibbutz Beit Oren.

ENGLISH ABSTRACT: This {{study is}} on the impact <b>of</b> <b>cooperative</b> <b>societies</b> on capital {{formation}} using a case study <b>of</b> selected <b>cooperatives</b> in Kwazulu Natal province of South Africa. The study is a novel empirical investigation in that focuses on impact <b>of</b> <b>cooperative</b> <b>societies</b> financing on members and how that may translate into significant increase in household incomes. The study assess and evaluates the roles played by cooperative societies’ financing and loans services on members’ economic condition particular their business expansion, profitability and later on improvements in household incomes. Using focus group discussion and questionnaire, the study uncovers the activities <b>of</b> <b>cooperative</b> <b>societies</b> located in both urban and rural communities within KZN Province. The study provides some evidence {{on the importance of}} leaving conditions after member access to cheap and affordable loans and provides some insights into the development of rural businesses, how complex they are, and how they require more input than just the financing received through cooperative loans as a final end. It also breaks new ground in informal cooperative operations, community improvement and rural finance research by providing a peculiarity between standard of living and quality of life variables in measuring and determining the economic condition of rural livelihoods and the production of circle of New Institutional Economics theory that the role <b>of</b> <b>cooperatives</b> to the members involve financial capital, physical capital and social capital which are interrelated. This serves to properly distinguish and appropriately identify the roles <b>of</b> <b>cooperative</b> <b>societies</b> in rural finance to increase in household income, ownership of assets and acquisition of enterprise assets. However, the study reveals that access to funds and participation in the cooperative does not lead to enterprise profitability, thus less capital accumulation while rural financial needs are more accessible from cooperatives than other sources. From its findings, this study identified and discussed potential areas for the improvement <b>of</b> <b>cooperative</b> <b>societies</b> that could be of benefit to any urban and rural finance providers and the cooperative members...|$|R
