5|$|Gaze {{becomes more}} complex {{with age and}} practice. As gaze {{increases}} in complexity, individuals {{are better able to}} discriminate what others are referring to. Joint attention is also important for social learning. Gaze following reflects an expectation-based type of orienting in which an individual's attention is cued by another's head turn or eye turn. Individuals are motivated to follow another's gaze and engage in joint attention because gaze is <b>a</b> <b>cue</b> for which rewarding events occur.|$|E
5|$|Scientists also {{view the}} ability to grow very long hair {{as a result of}} sexual selection, since long and healthy hair is a sign of {{fertility}} and youth. An evolutionary biology explanation for this attraction is that hair length and quality can act as <b>a</b> <b>cue</b> to youth and health, signifying a woman's reproductive potential. As hair grows slowly, long hair may reveal 2–3 years of a person's health status, nutrition, age and reproductive fitness. Malnutrition and deficiencies in minerals and vitamins due to starvation causes loss of hair or changes in hair color (e.g. dark hair turning reddish).|$|E

Multiple regression analyses indicated that while anticipation of reward vs non-reward activated foci in the ventral striatum, reward vs non-reward outcomes activated foci in the ventromedial frontal cortex. These ®ndings suggest that reward anticipation and outcomes may differentially recruit distinct regions that lie along the trajectory of ascending dopamine projections. NeuroRepor...|$|R

An American study shows {{significant}} correlation between hair length and age, which indicates that younger women tend to have longer hair than older women. A significant correlation was also found between women's hair length and hair quality. Moreover, hair quality was correlated with the women's perceived physical health. Consistent with principles of evolutionary psychology, {{these results indicate that}} hair length and quality can act as <b>a</b> <b>cue</b> to a woman's youth and health, signifying reproductive potential. The correlation between the woman's hair length and marital status, or number of children, was however not more than to be expected from the correlation between hair length and age.|$|E
5|$|Chimpanzees {{are capable}} of {{actively}} locating objects that {{are the focus of}} another individual's attention by tracking the gaze of others. They are not limited to following eye gaze to the first interesting object in their view. They use a number of different cues to engage in shared focus, including head movement and eye gaze. Infant chimpanzees start to follow tap, point, and head turn cues of an experimenter by nine months of age. By 13 months of age, they show following responses to glance cues without a head turn. There is no evidence to support that infant chimpanzees are able to use eye gaze alone as <b>a</b> <b>cue</b> for following responses. By 20 months of age, infant chimpanzees are able to follow an experimenter's cues to a target behind the chimpanzee but infant chimpanzees do not look back to the experimenter after looking at the target. Moving targets are more salient than stationary targets for infant chimpanzees. Chimpanzee infants are sensitive to faces which are gazing at them, but chimpanzees less than three to four years old only look within their visual field when using the experimenter's head turn as their cue.|$|E
5|$|In the Masters, O'Sullivan {{reached the}} final by beating Joe Perry, Ali Carter and Stephen Maguire. In a tense final against {{defending}} champion Mark Selby, neither player {{was able to}} obtain a sizeable lead, with frames littered with both big breaks and close finishes. After leading 3–1, O'Sullivan ended the afternoon session at 4–4, and took the first frame of the evening session. Selby, however, then won the next 3 frames to lead 7–5. O'Sullivan responded by taking three frames in succession himself, to lead 8–7. The following two frames were shared, and at 9–8, after both players had wasted chances, O'Sullivan constructed a break of 55, beating Mark Selby 10–8 and thereby claiming the title for the fourth time. In doing this he became only the second player, after Stephen Hendry, to win the trophy more than three times. In his post-match interview, O'Sullivan proclaimed his victory, composed with <b>a</b> <b>cue</b> that he had obtained only the previous Saturday, as his greatest achievement in snooker. During an exhibition in Ireland in January 2009, O'Sullivan and Jimmy White made maximum breaks in consecutive frames. In {{the first round of}} the 2009 World Championship O'Sullivan compiled three centuries in his 10–5 win against Stuart Bingham. O'Sullivan compiled a 140 break in the second, a 104 in the eighth, and a 103 in the 14th. He was defeated in the second round 11–13, by Mark Allen, after having led 9–7.|$|E
50|$|Often followspot {{operators}} do {{not take}} their cues from stage managers. This is generally because the timing of actors' entrances and exits and other movements may vary from night to night, and because calling every followspot cue could become too complicated and interfere with the calling and execution of other cues. However, {{if there is a}} problem with the actor appearing on stage, the stage manager will notify the followspots of this over headset. More commonly, a stage manager may only call very specific followspot <b>cues,</b> like <b>a</b> blackout—frequently on <b>a</b> blackout <b>cue</b> there is <b>a</b> light <b>cue,</b> <b>a</b> sound <b>cue,</b> <b>a</b> followspot <b>cue</b> and sometimes even <b>a</b> set <b>cue,</b> so it is very important that everything happens all at the same time.

The results show that both social and non-social cues can guide infants’ attention to a visual shape sequence (and away from a distracting sequence).

40|$|In the {{emotional}} spatial <b>cueing</b> task, <b>a</b> peripheral cue-either emotional or non-emotional-is presented before target onset. <b>A</b> stronger <b>cue</b> validity effect with an emotional relative to <b>a</b> non-emotional <b>cue</b> (i. e., more efficient responding to validly cued targets relative to invalidly cued targets) {{is taken as}} an indication of emotional modulation of attentional processes. However, results from previous emotional spatial cueing studies are not consistent. Some studies find an effect at the validly cued location (shorter reaction times compared to <b>a</b> non-emotional <b>cue),</b> whereas other studies find an effect at the invalidly cued location (longer reaction times compared to <b>a</b> non-emotional <b>cue).</b> In the current paper, we explore which parameters affect emotional modulation of the cue validity effect in the spatial cueing task. Results from five experiments in healthy volunteers led to the conclusion that <b>a</b> threatening spatial <b>cue</b> did not affect attention processes but rather indicate that motor processes are affected. A possible mechanism might be that <b>a</b> strong aversive <b>cue</b> stimulus decreases reaction times by means of stronger action preparation.

25|$|There are {{two basic}} {{experimental}} methods used to conduct cued recall, the study-test method and the anticipation method. In the study-test method participants study a list of word pairs presented individually. Immediately after or after a time delay, participants are tested in the study phase of the experiment on the word pairs just previously studied. One word of each pair is presented in a random order and the participant is asked to recall the item with which it was originally paired. The participant can be tested for either forward recall, Ai is presented as <b>a</b> <b>cue</b> for Bi, or backward recall, Bi is presented as <b>a</b> <b>cue</b> for Ai. In the anticipation method, participants are shown Ai and are asked to anticipate the word paired with it, Bi. If the participant cannot recall the word, the answer is revealed. During an experiment using the anticipation method, the list of words is repeated until {{a certain percentage of}} Bi words are recalled.|$|E
40|$|Visual {{short-term}} memory (VSTM) performance is enhanced when the to-be-tested item is cued after encoding. This so-called retro-cue benefit is typically {{accompanied by a}} cost for the noncued items, suggesting that information is lost from VSTM upon presentation of <b>a</b> retrospective <b>cue.</b> Here we assessed whether noncued items can be restored to VSTM when made relevant again by <b>a</b> subsequent second <b>cue.</b> We presented either 1 or 2 consecutive retro-cues (80 % valid) during the retention interval of a change-detection task. Relative to no <b>cue,</b> <b>a</b> valid <b>cue</b> increased VSTM capacity by 2 items, while <b>an</b> invalid <b>cue</b> decreased capacity by 2. Importantly, when <b>a</b> second, valid <b>cue</b> followed <b>an</b> invalid <b>cue,</b> capacity regained 2 items, so that performance was back on par. In addition, when the second cue was also invalid, there was no extra loss of information from VSTM, suggesting that those items that survived <b>a</b> first invalid <b>cue,</b> automatically also survived a second. We conclude that these results are {{in support of a}} very versatile VSTM system, in which memoranda adopt different representational states depending on whether they are deemed relevant now, in the future, or not at all. We discuss a neural model that is consistent with this conclusion...|$|R

Experiment 1 showed <b>a</b> reliable <b>cueing</b> effect from both self- and friend-faces at a long stimulus onset asynchrony (SOA), however, the self-faces exclusively generated <b>a</b> spatial <b>cueing</b> effect at <b>a</b> short SOA.

The size of the self-bias effect in N 1 correlated with the strength of self-biases in P 3.

The current study investigated visuo-spatial attention performance in <b>an</b> exogenous <b>cueing</b> paradigm in <b>a</b> large sample (N = 191) of third and fourth graders with different reading and spelling profiles (controls, isolated reading deficit, isolated spelling deficit, combined deficit in reading and spelling). Once individual variability in reaction times was taken into account by means of z-transformation, <b>a</b> <b>cueing</b> deficit (i. e. no significant difference between valid and invalid trials) was found for children with combined deficits in reading and spelling. However, poor readers without spelling problems showed <b>a</b> <b>cueing</b> effect comparable to controls, but exhibited a particularly strong right-over-left advantage (position effect). Isolated poor spellers showed <b>a</b> significant <b>cueing</b> effect, but no position effect. While we replicated earlier findings of <b>a</b> reduced <b>cueing</b> effect among poor nonword readers (indicating deficits in sublexical processing), we also found <b>a</b> reduced <b>cueing</b> effect among children with particularly poor orthographic spelling (indicating deficits in lexical processing). Thus, earlier claims of a specific association with nonword reading could not be confirmed. Controlling for ADHD-symptoms reported in a parental questionnaire did not impact on the statistical analysis, indicating that cueing deficits are not caused by more general attentional limitations. Between 31 and 48 % of participants in the three reading and/or spelling deficit groups as well as 32 % of the control group showed reduced spatial cueing. These findings indicate a significant, but moderate association between certain aspects of visuo-spatial attention and subcomponents of written language processing, the causal status of which is yet unclear...|$|R
