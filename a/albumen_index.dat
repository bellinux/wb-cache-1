40|$|SOME {{factors that}} {{influence}} albumen quality changes during storage of shell eggs have long been known. Tem-perature control and, to some extent, evaporation control {{have been used as}} methods of preserving quality. Reduction of carbon dioxide loss from the albumen and the prevention of evaporation have been made possible by sealing the shell with oil. Oil processing has been success-ful in reducing albumen liquefaction, but undesirable side effects have been found. Fletcher et al. (1959) report that oil treated eggs pick up foreign flavors readily and that the process tends to lower quality. Swanson (1959) reports that these eggs do not peel well after hard cooking. The relationship between the rise in pH of the albumen and albumen liquefac-tion was reported by Sharp (1929). This rise is caused by release of carbon dioxide from the egg. He found that this could be prevented by holding eggs in an atmos-phere containing higher than normal con-centrations of carbon dioxide or by plac-ing freshly laid eggs in a carbon-dioxide-tight container in which the carbon di-oxide content of the eggs quickly reaches equilibrium with that of the surrounding atmosphere. He also observed marked turbidity of the albumen of oil sealed eggs. Wilhelm (1940) reported improved <b>albumen</b> <b>indexes</b> of eggs stored in sealed mason jars with a vacuum carbon di...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: In this study, it {{has been}} aimed to {{determine}} {{the internal and external}} quality traits of the quail eggs as well as the phenotypic correlation between these traits. Totally 202 Japanese quail eggs collected in three sequential days were used for this study. Eggs were obtained from 90 female quails, all at 20 weeks of age. The birds were housed as 1 male/ 3 female per cage of 40 x 30 x 30 cm at Quail Research unit of the Department of Zootechnia, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Firat University. The values related to egg weight, shape index, shell weight, unit surface shell weight, shell ratio and average shell thickness are found respectively as 11. 28 g, 74. 90 %, 0. 84 g, 45. 98 mg/cm, 7. 47 % and 0. 231 mm; and the <b>albumen</b> <b>index,</b> 2 albumen height, albumen weight, albumen ratio, yolk diameter, yolk height, yolk weight, yolk index, yolk ratio and the average values related to the haugh unit are found respectively as 9. 37 %, 3. 80 mm, 6. 75 g, 59. 83 %, 2. 57 cm, 0. 939 mm, 3. 69 g, 36. 70 %, 32. 71 % and 85. 73 %. According to the results obtained in this research, almost all internal quality traits of the egg were changed at the significant levels depending on the change occurred in the egg weight with respect to the external quality traits of the egg. However, the yolk and shell rates changed opposite to the albumen ratio and the <b>albumen</b> <b>index.</b> As a result, {{it has been}} considered {{that it was possible to}} use the egg weight in determining the eggshell weight, shell thickness and the shell ratio instead of using these traits that are the determinants of the eggshell quality of the quail eggs...|$|E

40|$|Aims: The {{present study}} {{investigated}} phenotypic correlations between {{external and internal}} egg quality traits in Japanese quail. Study Design: Laboratory analysis was carried out using sensitive scale and Vernier calipers. Place and Duration of Study: Teaching and Research Farm, Department of Animal Production and Health Sciences, Ekiti State University, between September 2013 and December, 2013. Methodology: The quails were housed in the cage at the ratio of 1 male: 3 females. Freshly laid eggs were collected and taken to the laboratory for external and internal analysis. Egg weight was taken with sensitive scale, while egg length and egg width were taken with Vernier calipers. Thereafter, the eggs were broken at equatorial region and the contents poured into a dish. Subsequently, egg yolk weight, length and width, albumen length and width were measured, while albumen weight was obtained by subtracting the addition of yolk weight and shell weight from egg weight. Results: Results revealed that egg weight has no significant phenotypic correlation with egg width, egg length, shell weight and shell thickness (P> 0. 05). With regard to internal egg quality traits, albumen weight was found statistically insignificantly correlated with all internal qualities including Haugh unit. In the case of albumen height, positive and highly significant phenotypic correlation was recorded with Haugh unit. The implication is that albumen height is a good determinant of Haugh unit. The higher the value, the higher the Haugh unit score, and the better the quality of an egg. However, the trait has negative and significant phenotypic correlation with albumen width, yolk weight and yolk width. In addition, egg weight has positive statistically significant phenotypic correlation with <b>albumen</b> and yolk <b>indices</b> (P= 0. 01). Conclusion: The size of an egg determines its albumen and yolk proportions. Egg weight therefore, is a good determinant of albumen weight and yolk weight in quail bird...|$|R

40|$|This study {{aimed to}} {{evaluate}} the effect of different rearing densities during brooding (0 to 2 weeks) and growth (3 to 15 weeks) on performance and egg quality of laying hens (Hy-line W- 36) during production phase (18 to 42 weeks). In the brooding phase, a total of 3250 day-old chicks were allocated in wire cages, distributed in a completely randomized design composed of 5 treatments (63. 57; 66. 38; 69. 44; 72. 80 and 76. 50 cm²/bird) with 10 replications each. At {{the beginning of the}} growth phase, floor space in each treatment was increased. Therefore, a total of 750 birds were selected from the original treatments, which represented 237. 57, 265. 52, 300. 92, 347. 22, and 410. 35 cm²/bird. At the end of the growing phase, 390 pullets were transferred to production facilities and distributed, according to their original treatment, in conventional cages with 430. 76 cm²/bird (13 birds/cage). For this phase, only 6 replications per treatment were adopted. Experimental data were subjected to analysis of variance and, in the case of significant differences, means were analyzed using polynomial regression test. Body weight, weight gain and uniformity were compared during the brooding and growth phases. First-egg weight, age at first egg, age at 50 % daily production, weights of egg, albumen, yolk and shell, egg mass, yolk diameter, yolk height, yolk <b>index,</b> <b>albumen</b> height, percentages of shell, albumen and yolk, shell thickness, Haugh unit, and egg specific gravity were analyzed during the production stage.
