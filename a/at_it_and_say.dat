40|$|Communities of practice’ has {{widespread}} ‘currency’ in {{both the}} workplace learning literature and increasingly, in contemporary workplaces. Workplace learning researchers, workplace trainers and organisational consultants are using communities of practice {{as a way of}} talking about and theorising learning at work. It is this seemingly unproblematic ‘rise and rise’ of ‘communities of practice’ that is somewhat troubling and a theme which will be explored in this paper. Why is it that communities of practice are the contemporary focus of our gaze? As a researcher interested in the complexities of power and learning at work I ask ‘what work does communities of practice do in organisations?’ My introduction to, and interest in, ‘communities of practice’ has come about through my involvement as a research team member in an Australian Research Council funded project which is exploring ‘everyday’ learning at work. In the ‘Uncovering Learning’ project, ‘communities of practice’ (Wenger, 1998) has been used as one of various conceptual frames for exploring the extent and nature of everyday learning at work. The research site is TAFE NSW, in Australia, the NSW state government provider of vocational education and training. TAFE NSW is a large, public sector organisation that is undergoing change as a result of widespread education and training reforms. Our interest in this project is on TAFE as a workplace, although the significance of TAFE being in the ‘learning’ industry cannot be overlooked. ‘Communities of practice’ has appeal in this workplace at the moment. For example, the Professional Development Network, a staff development unit within TAFE, is using communities of practice. ‘Reframing the Future’, a staff development and change management program for VET practitioners, including TAFE employees, is also using a communities of practice framework (Mitchell, 2003). ‘Reframing the Future’ provides an example of the way ‘communities of practice’ is being used as a human resource development strategy in organisations. In this sense ‘communities of practice’ {{can be viewed as a}} contemporary organisational practice in TAFE. Using a postmodern perspective on researching learning at work we might ask which discourses are the most powerful, how they come to be powerful and how they frame practices (Edwards & Usher, 2000) ? So why is it that ‘communities of practice’ has become such a powerful discourse in contemporary workplaces? Various commentators draw attention to the way the workplace is currently being discursively constructed as a legitimate site of learning (eg Garrick, 1998; Usher, 2000; Usher & Solomon, 1999). Communities of practice texts, both theoretical ones, such as Wenger’s work on communities of practice (1998), and organisational ones, such as the stories circulating at work about communities of practice, contribute to this construction. For example, Wenger’s notion of communities of practice draws on a theory of situated learning, where learning is understood as being located in social contexts, including everyday work (Lave & Wenger, 1991). These texts contribute to a normalising of learning at work and the contemporary shifts in power that are taking place within organisations and between universities and organisations. In terms of the latter, it is now understood that organisations have increasing control of the learning process and ‘what is learned’ (Usher, 2000). A postmodern approach to researching learning at work emphasises the way discourses construct certain objects as ‘knowable’ and ‘known’ and certain perspectives as ‘true’ (Edwards & Usher, 2000). Using this approach we can explore the way communities of practice texts position workers in normative ways thereby constituting particular forms of experience and subjectivities. I will use a text from the Reframing the Future program to briefly illustrate the representation of contemporary TAFE practitioners and explore the way a community of practice discourse constructs workplaces as legitimate sites of learning and the ‘worker-learner’ as a legitimate way of being at work. In this text ‘communities of practice’ are described as ‘groups of people bound together by common interests and a passion for a cause, and who continually interact’ (Mitchell, 2003, p. 5). The new worker is one who places an emphasis on relationships, for example, training providers need to be ‘more client-focused by establishing improved relationships with both enterprise clients and individual students’ (p 8). Workers are knowledge producers where: ‘The development of practice involves a balance between exploring ideas together and producing documents and tools’ (p 6). The communities in this text have great appeal. The members ‘communicate regularly and continuously in an atmosphere of trust, enabling collective enquiry about issues of importance to the members’ (p 6). The communities of practice are unproblematically aligned with a broader goal, which is the successful implementation of the new training system. For example ‘all the communities were required to focus on the implementation of the national training system. Legitimate foci for the communities included Training Package implementation, the requirements of the Australian Quality Framework (AQTF), the recognition of current competencies, industry-provider relationships and collaboration with other providers’ (p 13). In this text workers are presented as active and emotionally engaged knowledge-producers in the contemporary workplace and learning at work is presented as empowering and self-directed. And, as the management gurus remind us, it is exactly these active, entrepreneurial, knowledge-producing subjects that contemporary organisations need in our rapidly changing times (eg Drucker, 1988; Handy, 1995; Senge, 1990). The connection between the need for organisations to have active knowledge producers and the discursive production of these types of workers begins to draw attention to the relationship between learning at work and power. But as Usher & Solomon (1999) point out, the shaping of subjectivity is a tension-filled and complex process. Some of these tensions are illustrated in the following account from the head teacher of a teaching group in TAFE. In this interview ‘Jim’ was talking about the challenges and changes he and his workgroup had experienced in relation to doing their job in recent years. Not surprisingly, Jim often spoke about the new training packages and the impact they were having on the way this group of teachers were doing their work. Using Wenger’s criteria of shared repertoire, mutual engagement and joint enterprise, this group could be described as a community of practice (Leontios, Boud, Harman, & Rooney, 2003). However, the practice of this community is not focused around the successful implementation of the new training packages. Instead, the practices of this group could be described in terms of resistance. The morale around here has absolutely hit rock bottom- it could really hardly be lower and that’s of great importance to me – its very difficult to motivate people and after a while of patting them on the head and saying gee you really did a great job, that was great – it rings hollow – I can’t reward them any other way. The straw that’s broken the camel’s back around here was not constantly being attacked with the paperwork and the cuts, as the training packages –that’s what’s killed it. The one thing…you were able to motivate them in was their technical knowledge and their professionalism in which they are held in high esteem within the [profession]. So if something was new and important they would work it out themselves they would come to me and we would propose what new changes had to be made and how they would best work around them and that was never a real problem. When we had major curriculum reviews they would always turn around and release someone so everybody in this section has had release time [from teaching] to write curriculum…so there’s an incentive to turn around and put something back into it because it was an extra over the top, so they’ve all got pretty much a sense of ownership around here. They’ve all got their patches of expertise… … there is no way I can supply quality education because I don’t have a curriculum that’s been properly structured. I’m delivering training packages that are totally meaningless…Now my people look <b>at</b> <b>it</b> <b>and</b> <b>say</b> ‘this is total garbage, change it’ and I go to get it changed and they say ‘we’re not changing it’ and I come back and I say I’m sorry they can’t change it, therefore they look at me and they say they feel like they’re totally ineffective or they throw their hands up in the air and say ‘this is total crap’ and we’re stuck and we’ve got that crap and we’re trying to teach it now. Now we’re going into the second year of the new course without any new curriculum, so it’s a quality issue… This community of practice provide a contrast to the communities articulated in ‘Reframing the Future’. Instead of energetic, problem-solving implementers of the new training system we hear of a despondent, ‘burnt-out’, untrusting community. This community questions the national training framework and its promise of enhanced quality. This story suggests tensions around being re-positioned as worker-learners (Boud & Solomon, 2003). The teachers in this community had learnt how to teach this course, what worked and what didn’t work with the students, as well as how and when to update the curriculum. They had learnt how to successfully deliver this course to their students. But the learning and the expertise of this community were not taken onto account in the process of introducing the new training packages. The knowledge held by the teachers in regard to their relationships with industry and with their students was disregarded. The teachers in this workgroup see themselves as experts in an area of knowledge, not as ‘learners’ who need to develop new practices. The analysis of these stories brings to the fore the issue of ‘what counts as learning?’ In the Reframing the Future stories the practices that feature in the text are those that contribute to the successful implementation of the new training system. There is no talk of communities of practice that are resisting the implementation or presenting alternative agendas. This suggests that not all workplace practices are legitimate and that not all learning is legitimate. This privileging of some types of learning draws attention to the ‘disciplinary’ work of communities of practice. While communities of practice may open up space in the workplace for voices that might not normally be heard (Brown & Duguid, 1991), when it is used as a human resource development strategy it may have similar problems to other forms of organisational learning interventions. Garrick and Rhodes describe organisational learning as ‘ a dubiously legitimated and conceived project which focuses on control, the maintenance of orthodoxy and (although the rhetoric usually suggests otherwise) the suppression of difference' (Garrick & Rhodes, 1998, p. 177). When talking about communities of practice at work Gee et al. ask what space is left for reflection and critique if we are all immersed in ‘the core values and communities of practice of the business’(1996, p. 68) ? This suggests the importance of creating space in a community of practice framework for dissention, challenge and contestation. One of the appeals for organisations in communities of practice texts is that learning at work is represented as both natural and neutral. One of the consequences of this is that power and ‘discipline’ no longer seem so visible. It is in this way that ‘communities of practice’ can be considered a particularly seductive discourse. This paper has foregrounded the relationship between power and learning at work by locating ‘communities of practice’ in a social, cultural and political context. It begins to draw attention to the politics of learning at work and being a learner at work with the understanding that learning at work is not neutral. For example, the practices in the workplace that are being developed are framed within organisational goals. In this sense communities of practice can be viewed as a technology that aligns the goals of individual workers with the broader goals of the organisation. As a communities of practice discourse becomes increasingly privileged, what are the implications for reflexive learning practices that incorporates an element of organisational critique? As educators we need to avoid a bounded version of learning and open-up space for learning other than that which is ‘re-defined in managerialist terms’ (Garrick & Rhodes, 1998, p. 181) ...|$|E

He cannot even resolve hardily to believe in a ghost, or a water-spirit; always explains them away in an apologetic manner, not believing, all the while, even his own explanation. He never can clearly ascertain whether there is anything behind the arras but rats; never draws sword, <b>and</b> thrusts <b>at</b> <b>it</b> for life or death; but goes on looking <b>at</b> <b>it</b> timidly, <b>and</b> <b>saying,</b> [...] "it must be the wind." [...] He is educated a Presbyterian, and remains one, because it is the most sensible thing he can do if he is to live in Edinburgh; but he thinks Romanism more picturesque, and profaneness more gentlemanly: does not see that anything affects human life but love, courage, and destiny; which are, indeed, not matters of faith at all, but of sight. Any gods but those are very misty in outline to him; and when the love is laid ghastly in poor Charlotte's coffin; and the courage is no more of use,--the pen having fallen from between the fingers; and destiny is sealing the scroll,--the God-light is dim in the tears that fall on it.|$|R
500|$|Lefebvre died on 25 March 1991 {{at the age}} of 85 {{from cancer}} in Martigny, Switzerland, less than three years after being excommunicated for {{carrying}} out the episcopal consecrations. Eight days later he was buried in the crypt at the society's international seminary in Écône, Switzerland. Archbishop Edoardo Rovida, Apostolic Nuncio to Switzerland, and Bishop Henri Schwery of Sion, the local diocese, came and prayed at the body of the dead prelate. Later that year, on 18 September 1991, Cardinal Silvio Oddi, who had been Prefect of the Congregation for the Clergy from 1979 to 1986, visited Lefebvre's tomb, knelt down <b>at</b> <b>it</b> <b>and</b> prayed, afterwards <b>saying</b> aloud: [...] "Merci, Monseigneur". Thereafter Cardinal Oddi said he held Lefebvre to have been [...] "a holy man" [...] and suggested that the Society of St Pius X could be granted a personal prelature by the Holy See like that of Opus Dei. In January 1992, the then-superior general of the society, Fr. Franz Schmidberger, rejected this hypothetical offer by an unpublished private letter to the Holy See. The letter's content was described by Bishop Richard Williamson (subsequently expelled from the SSPX) as basically saying that, [...] "as long as Rome remains Conciliar, a fruitful and open collaboration between the two [...] does not seem possible." ...|$|R
6000|$|Thereon, shrugging his shoulders, {{the lawyer}} {{produced}} a paper which the interpreter translated to me. In it were written down {{the names of}} the passengers who were upon the vessel India when she sailed from a place called Bombay, and among the names those of Lord and Lady Glenthirsk and of their son, the Honourable Ralph Mackenzie, aged nine. Then followed the evidence of one or two survivors of the shipwreck, which stated that Lady Glenthirsk and her son were seen to reach the shore in safety in the boat that was launched from the sinking ship. After this came a paragraph from an English newspaper published in Capetown, dated not two years before, and headed [...] "Strange Tale of the Sea," [...] which paragraph, with some few errors, told the story of the finding of Ralph--though how the writing man knew it I know not, unless it was through the tutor with the blue spectacles of whom I have spoken--and said that he was still living on the farm of Jan Botmar in the Transkei. This was all that was in the paper. I asked to look <b>at</b> <b>it</b> <b>and</b> kept <b>it,</b> <b>saying</b> in the morning that the Kaffir girl seeing it lying about the kitchen had used it to light the fire; but to this day it is with the other things in the waggon chest under my bed.|$|R
60|$|It was half-past {{nine o'clock}} in the morning. The midsummer sun was already warm on the roofs and weathercocks of Milby. The church-bells were ringing, and many {{families}} were conscious of Sunday sensations, chiefly referable {{to the fact that}} the daughters had come down to breakfast in their best frocks, and with their hair particularly well dressed. For it was not Sunday, but Wednesday; and though the Bishop was going to hold a Confirmation, and to decide whether or not there should be a Sunday evening lecture in Milby, the sunbeams had the usual working-day look to the haymakers already long out in the fields, and to laggard weavers just 'setting up' their week's 'piece'. The notion of its being Sunday was the strongest in young ladies like Miss Phipps, who was going to accompany her younger sister to the confirmation, and to wear a 'sweetly pretty' transparent bonnet with marabout feathers on the interesting occasion, thus throwing into relief the suitable simplicity of her sister's attire, who was, of course, to appear in a new white frock; or in the pupils at Miss Townley's, who were absolved from all lessons, and were going to church to see the Bishop, and to hear the Honourable and Reverend Mr. Prendergast, the rector, read prayers--a high intellectual treat, as Miss Townley assured them. It seemed only natural that a rector, who was honourable, should read better than old Mr. Crewe, who was only a curate, and not honourable; and when little Clara Robins wondered why some clergymen were rectors and others not, Ellen Marriott assured her with great confidence that it was only the clever men who were made rectors. Ellen Marriott was going to be confirmed. She was a short, fair, plump girl, with blue eyes and sandy hair, which was this morning arranged in taller cannon curls than usual, for the reception of the Episcopal benediction, and some of the young ladies thought her the prettiest girl in the school; but others gave the preference to her rival, Maria Gardner, who was much taller, and had a lovely 'crop' of dark-brown ringlets, and who, being also about to take upon herself the vows made in her name at her baptism, had oiled and twisted her ringlets with especial care. As she seated herself at the breakfast-table before Miss Townley's entrance to dispense the weak coffee, her crop excited so strong a sensation that Ellen Marriott was at length impelled to look <b>at</b> <b>it,</b> <b>and</b> to <b>say</b> with suppressed but bitter sarcasm, 'Is that Miss Gardner's head?' 'Yes,' said Maria, amiable and stuttering, and no match for Ellen in retort; 'th--th--this is my head.' 'Then I don't admire <b>it</b> <b>at</b> all!' was the crushing rejoinder of Ellen, followed by a murmur of approval among her friends. Young ladies, I suppose, exhaust their sac of venom in this way at school. That is the reason why they have such a harmless tooth for each other in after life.|$|R
