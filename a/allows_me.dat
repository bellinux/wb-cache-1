I consider that I went through all stages, from popcorn to dance, club and pop music, so I considered that I have reached a maturity which <b>allows</b> <b>me</b> to release a song which I like, which makes me move in a club and makes me want to hear it on the radio, and I'm very fulfilled.|$|E

He was quiet and gentle, and was [...] "a modest man, with a self-deprecating sense of humour". Miller {{described}} his own attitude towards music in a 2005 interview: I worked hard to maintain a certain mental and emotional equilibrium. It's mostly due to my faith in the Creator. I don't put all my eggs in that basket of being a rich and famous jazz guy. That <b>allows</b> <b>me</b> {{a certain amount of}} freedom, because I don't have to play music for money. I play music because I love it.|$|E

[...] "Jim's {{the kind of}} director who knows exactly what he wants. As an actor, I {{can find a way}} to get there if I know specifically what I'm going for, and Jim gives me that. The fact that he won't move on until he's got exactly what he wants creates a safe environment, which <b>allows</b> <b>me</b> to experiment and try different things". [...] Cloke described her part as [...] "strong and sassy – in control. After the crash she comes unglued, probably more than any of the kids, and it's a quick, drastic change. I had to understand the psychology of a person who can turn on a dime like that".|$|E

When asked in an interview what people would {{be surprised to find}} out about her, she responded [...] "I guess people would be surprised to find out that I am a bit of a homebody. [...] I do not like clubbing or going to wild parties. [...] After a day of shooting, I love to come home and relax by the fire with a glass of wine and a good book. [...] Boring, huh?"

The group includes Winfrey, Gayle King, her niece Rosa Johnson Butler, her assistant Lydia Stuckey, and gospel singer Valerie Simpson.|$|E
500|$|In {{reward for}} his action against Révolutionnaire, Nagle {{was made a}} Knight Bachelor, and First Lieutenant Robert Dudley Oliver was {{promoted}} to commander. Pellew, in his report on the action, stated that [...] "the cripped state of the Enemy <b>allows</b> <b>me</b> the Opportunity of saying, that her Resiliance could have been of no Avail, had the Artois been alone", but historian William James was more reserved, noting in 1827 that the ships [...] "would have been a well matched pair of combatants, had the Artois been alone." [...] The prize money was extensive: part payment of £10,000 (£ as of [...] ) was made in January 1795, the reward shared between the entire squadron. Pellew, who had been knighted the previous year following the Action of 18 June 1793, {{was reported to be}} unhappy that Nagle had been honoured for his part in this action and complained to the Admiralty about the condition and speed of Arethusa, requesting a faster vessel.

500|$|According to author John Hagen, Toronto's then-mayor, William Dennison, was openly {{antagonistic}} to {{the influx}} of American hippies, draft resisters, and those who supported them who were coming to Canada in large numbers {{during the height of}} the Vietnam War. In his 2001 book, Northern Passage: American Vietnam War Resisters in Canada, Hagen wrote: [...] "The mayors of Canada's largest cities used the (War Measures Act) in a backlash against American war resisters." [...] Dennison stated: [...] "a few hippies and deserters are Toronto's only problem." [...] Mayor Jean Drapeau of Montreal asserted that military resisters were part of a [...] "revolutionary conspiracy." [...] Vancouver's mayor, Tom Campbell, commented: [...] "I don't like draft dodgers and I'll do anything within the law that <b>allows</b> <b>me</b> to get rid of them." [...] While all three men supported use of the War Measures Act to harass war resisters and hippies, Campbell was the most aggressive; he told the Toronto Star: [...] "I believe the law should be used against any revolutionary whether he's a US draft dodger or a hippie." [...] According to Hagen, the RCMP and the FBI cooperated in their effort to harass American war resisters during the late 1960s.|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} with Indie Journal, Joseph said that when writing music he prefers {{to concentrate on the}} melody first, stating, [...] "Basically, I write from a two-person standpoint. [...] First, I let the song take hold and I put down the idea as a raw emotional statement. Then I let it breathe and come back, approaching from more of an objective point of view. This <b>allows</b> <b>me</b> to rediscover the true meaning I intended in the beginning, shedding new light on how I can best represent that to the listener." [...] This same concept is explained again in a taped interview with the Government Television Network with Joseph explaining that a lot of times he may only come up with part of a melody. [...] Then he would let it rest and come back to it and see if it feels right. [...] Then he would start [...] "building around it", [...] like putting a car together - start with a frame and then start building things around it. Musically, he tries to connect a common bridge between such exhilarating feelings as performing at the Acropolis, to the emotions each and every one feels every day. [...] "In the end, a good melody will always stand the test of time", says Joseph.|$|E

2500|$|In {{his younger}} days, Xiang Yu was {{instructed}} in scholarly arts and swordsmanship {{but he did}} not manage to master what he was taught, and his uncle Xiang Liang was not very satisfied with him. Xiang Yu said, [...] "Books are only useful in helping me remember my name. Mastering swordsmanship <b>allows</b> <b>me</b> to face only one opponent, so it's not worth learning. I want to learn how to defeat thousands of enemies." [...] Hence, his uncle tried to educate him in military strategies and the art of wars instead, but Xiang Yu stopped learning after he had grasped the main ideas; Xiang Liang was disappointed with his nephew, who showed no sign of motivation or apparent talent apart from his great strength, so he gave up and let Xiang Yu decide his own future.|$|E

2500|$|During these {{final years}} of her life, Kahlo {{dedicated}} her time to political causes {{to the extent that}} her health allowed. She had rejoined the Mexican Communist Party in 1948, and campaigned for peace by, for example, collecting signatures for the Stockholm Appeal. She painted mostly still-life, portraying fruit and flowers with political symbols, such as flags or doves. She was concerned about being able to portray her political convictions, stating that [...] "until now I have managed simply an honest expression of my own self ... I must struggle with all my strength to ensure that the little positive my health <b>allows</b> <b>me</b> to do also benefits the Revolution, the only real reason to live." [...] She also altered her painting style: her brushstrokes, previously delicate and careful, were now hastier, her use of color more brash, and the overall style more intense and feverish.|$|E
