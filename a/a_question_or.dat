25|$|After viewing a question, the {{contestant}} {{can leave}} the game with the money already won rather than attempting an answer. If the contestant answers a question incorrectly, then all of their winnings are lost, except that the £1,000 and £32,000 prizes are guaranteed: if a player gets a question wrong above these levels, then the prize drops to the previous guaranteed prize. Answering the £2,000 and £64,000 questions wrong does not reduce the prize money. The prizes are generally non-cumulative; that is, answering a question correctly does not result in the amount being played for being added to the amount already won, rather the amount already won is written off and replaced by a larger sum, usually twice as large. The game ends when the contestant answers a question incorrectly, decides not to answer <b>a</b> <b>question,</b> <b>or</b> answers all questions correctly.|$|E

25|$|The same {{situation}} is in evidence in everyday life, however, whenever attention is fixated with <b>a</b> <b>question</b> <b>or</b> {{an experience of}} the amazing, the unusual, or anything that holds a person's interest. At such moments people experience the common everyday trance; they tend to gaze {{off to the right}} or left, depending upon which cerebral hemisphere is most dominant (Baleen, 1969) and get that faraway or blank look. Their eyes may actually close, their bodies tend to become immobile (a form of catalepsy), certain reflexes (e.g., swallowing, respiration, etc.) may be suppressed, and they seem momentarily oblivious to their surroundings until they have completed their inner search on the unconscious level for the new idea, response, or frames of reference that will restabilize their general reality orientation. We hypothesize that in everyday life consciousness is in a continual state of flux between the general reality orientation and the momentary microdynamics of trance...|$|E
500|$|If a {{statement}} {{has been made}} by a person after being arrested, it is only admissible if the court is satisfied that a caution along the following lines was administered: [...] "It is my duty to warn {{you that you are}} not obliged to say anything or to answer any question, but anything you say, whether in answer to <b>a</b> <b>question</b> <b>or</b> not, may be given in evidence." [...] However, if a person makes {{a statement}} before there is time to administer a caution, the statement remains admissible if the caution is then administered as soon as possible.|$|E
500|$|English {{has long}} been entrenched as a de facto {{national}} language due to its widespread use. In the 2013 census, 96.1percent of respondents spoke English. The New Zealand English dialect is mostly non-rhotic with an exception being the Southern Burr found principally in Southland and parts of Otago. It is similar to Australian English and many speakers from the Northern Hemisphere are unable to tell the accents apart. In New Zealand English the short i (as in kit) has become centralised, leading to the phrase fish and chips sounding like [...] "fush and chups" [...] to the Australian ear. The words rarely and really, reel and real, doll and dole, pull and pool, witch and which, and full and fill can sometimes be pronounced as homophones. Some New Zealanders pronounce the past participles grown, thrown and mown using two syllables, whereas groan, throne and moan are pronounced as one syllable. New Zealanders often reply to <b>a</b> <b>question</b> <b>or</b> emphasise a point by adding a rising intonation {{at the end of}} the sentence.|$|E

500|$|Whenever {{a player}} {{correctly}} answers <b>a</b> <b>question</b> <b>or</b> solves a puzzle in a minigame, they gain [...] "mastery points" [...] {{on the word}} they successfully answered. The minigames can be increased in difficulty; on higher difficulty levels, players will acquire more mastery points when successfully completing a minigame. For instance, in Multiple Choice, the player has 50 seconds to select an answer for a question on the [...] "Easy" [...] difficulty, and will receive two mastery points for each correct answer. On the [...] "Medium" [...] difficulty, the player has 40 seconds to select an answer and receives three mastery points for each correct answer. The process continues until the player scores fifteen mastery points for every word, allowing the player to proceed to the next lesson. Following the completion of all fifty lessons, the player can continue to learn new words through [...] "open lessons" [...] that contain ten new vocabulary words apiece; the dictionaries of both games each hold nearly 10,000 words. The player can freely access the reference section, which contains a dictionary and phrasebook, at any time. Both the dictionary and phrasebook hold all of the words and phrases in each game, as well as meanings and audio files for both; the player can look through different categories of words and phrases, use a search function, and bookmark chosen phrases.|$|E
2500|$|Recasting is rephrasing {{something}} {{the child has}} said, perhaps turning it into <b>a</b> <b>question</b> <b>or</b> restating the child's immature utterance {{in the form of}} a fully grammatical sentence.

2500|$|In a {{wider and}} less common {{sense of the}} term, [...] "pitch accent" [...] is {{sometimes}} also used to describe intonation, such as methods of conveying surprise, changing a statement into <b>a</b> <b>question,</b> <b>or</b> expressing information flow (topic–focus, contrasting), using variations in pitch. A great number of languages use pitch in this way, including English {{as well as all}} other major European languages. They are often called intonation languages.|$|E
2500|$|In the Hebrew Bible, the Urim and the Thummim ( [...] , Standardha-Urim veha-Tummim TiberianhāʾÛrîm wəhatTummîm; meaning uncertain, {{possibly}} [...] "Lights and Perfections") are {{elements of}} the hoshen, the breastplate worn by the High Priest attached to the ephod. They are connected with divination in general, and cleromancy in particular. Most scholars suspect that the phrase refers {{to a set of}} two objects used by the high priest to answer <b>a</b> <b>question</b> <b>or</b> reveal the will of God.|$|E
2500|$|Both {{direct and}} {{indirect}} relative particles can be used simply for emphasis, often in answer to <b>a</b> <b>question</b> <b>or</b> {{as a way of}} disagreeing with a statement. For instance, the Welsh example above, [...] "y dyn a welais" [...] means not only [...] "the man whom I saw", but also [...] "it was the man (and not anyone else) I saw"; and [...] "y dyn y rhois y llyfr iddo" [...] can likewise mean [...] "it was the man (and not anyone else) to whom I gave the book".|$|E

2500|$|... "Pura Vida" [...] is {{the most}} {{recognizable}} phrase attached to Costa Ricans, and it reflects the inhabitant's positive view of life. Literally translated, the expression means pure life and denotes a simple life, free of stress, a positive, relaxed feeling. The expression is used in various contexts. Often, people walking down the streets, or buying food at shops say hello by saying Pura Vida. It can be phrased as <b>a</b> <b>question</b> <b>or</b> as an acknowledgement of one's presence. A recommended response to [...] "How are you?" [...] would be [...] "Pura Vida." ...|$|E
2500|$|There {{are three}} basic parts to the Toastmasters meeting: the {{prepared}} speeches, table topics, and evaluations. In the prepared speaking {{portion of the}} meeting, several Toastmasters will give a prepared presentation or speech before the group. Speeches are usually {{designed to meet the}} requirements of one of the projects in the communication manuals. [...] "Table topics" [...] is an extemporaneous speaking exercise where the speaker speaks [...] "off the cuff"; that is, the speaker responds to <b>a</b> <b>question</b> <b>or</b> topic that is not known beforehand. The Table Topics Master presents the topic, calls on an individual, and then that individual has 1 to 2 minutes to respond.|$|E
2500|$|The name Maitreya {{is derived}} from the Sanskrit word maitrī [...] "loving-kindness", which is in turn derived from the noun mitra [...] "friend". The Pali form Metteyya is {{mentioned}} in the Cakkavatti-Sīhanāda Sutta (Digha Nikaya 26) of the Pāli Canon, and also in chapter 28 of the Buddhavamsa. Most of the Buddha's sermons are presented as having been presented in answer to <b>a</b> <b>question,</b> <b>or</b> in some other appropriate context, but this sutta has a beginning and ending in which the Buddha is talking to monks about something totally different. This leads scholar Richard Gombrich to conclude that either the whole sutta is apocryphal or that it has at least been tampered with.|$|E

2500|$|During that era, the Continental Congress had a rule stating: [...] "No new motion or {{proposition}} {{shall be}} admitted under color of amendment {{as a substitute}} for <b>a</b> <b>question</b> <b>or</b> proposition under debate until it is postponed or disagreed to." [...] At the Virginia convention to ratify the Constitution, delegate William Grayson was concerned that a substitute amendment could have the same effect as an origination: [...] "the Senate could strike out every word of the bill except the word whereas, or any other introductory word, and might substitute new words of their own." [...] Grayson was not convinced by Madison's argument that [...] "the first part of the clause is sufficiently expressed to exclude all doubts" [...] about where the origination must occur.|$|E
2500|$|This {{earliest}} {{question mark}} was a decoration {{of one of}} these dots, with the [...] "lightning flash" [...] perhaps meant to denote intonation, and perhaps associated with early musical notation like neumes. Another possibility is that it was originally a tilde or titlo, as in [...] "·~", one of many wavy or more or less slanted marks used in medieval texts for denoting things such as abbreviations, which would later become various diacritics or ligatures. [...] Over the next three centuries this pitch-defining element (if it ever existed) seems to have been forgotten, so that the Alcuinesque stroke-over-dot sign (with the stroke sometimes slightly curved) is often seen indifferently at the end of clauses, whether they embody <b>a</b> <b>question</b> <b>or</b> not.|$|E
2500|$|In the Goidelic languages, {{dependent}} and independent verb forms are distinct verb forms; each tense of each verb exists in both forms. Verbs are often {{preceded by a}} particle which marks negation, or <b>a</b> <b>question,</b> <b>or</b> has some other force. The dependent verb forms are used after a particle, while independent forms are used when the verb {{is not subject to}} a particle. For example, in Irish, the past tense of the verb [...] ("to see") has two forms: the independent form [...] and the dependent form [...] The independent form is used when no particle precedes the verb, as in [...] ("I saw John"). The dependent form is used when a particle such as [...] ("not") precedes the verb, as in [...] ("I did not see John").|$|E

If the contestants answer <b>a</b> <b>question</b> incorrectly <b>or</b> fail to complete a Panic Room challenge, the door {{in front of them}} becomes blocked and they must move to one side or the other.|$|R
