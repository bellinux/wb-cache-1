The uptake of <b>agent</b> <b>banking</b> in Kenya has not been well appreciated by the target beneficiaries who include among others the micro and small enterprises in the rural areas in Kenya who were expected to benefit from this technologically innovative service.

50|$|One of {{the causes}} for the Panic of 1893 {{can be traced back}} to Argentina. Investment was {{encouraged}} by the Argentine <b>agent</b> <b>bank,</b> Baring Brothers. However, the 1890 wheat crop failure and a coup in Buenos Aires ended further investments. Because European investors were concerned that these problems might spread, they started a run on gold in the U.S. Treasury. At that time, it was comparatively simple to cash in dollar investments for exportable gold. During the Gilded Age of the 1870s and 1880s, the United States had experienced economic growth and expansion, but much of this expansion depended on high international commodity prices. In 1893, wheat prices crashed.|$|E

40|$|The {{anticipated}} {{increase in}} popular {{use of the}} Internet has created more opportunity in information dissemination, Ecommerce, and multimedia communication. It has also created more challenges in organizing information and facilitating its efficient retrieval. From the network perspective, there are additional challenges and problems in meeting bandwidth requirement, as in network management. In response to this, new techniques, languages and paradigms have evolved which facilitate the creation of such applications. Certainly the most promising among the new paradigms {{is the use of}} mobile agents. In this paper, mobile agent and client-server technologies are applied in an E-commerce application and a comparative study is discussed. We report an implementation of a banking system, whose database may be distributed at different sites on the Internet. A customer can send his/her mobile agent to perform various tasks involved in banking and get back an appropriate result or can use client-server methodology to perform the same task. PMADE is used as the platform to develop these mobile agents. Security checks have been also implemented, as this is an important requirement in E-commerce.

40|$|All six {{studies show}} how complex the {{interactions}} on the micro-level (<b>agent,</b> <b>bank,</b> trader group) are and {{shed some light}} on how they determine the observed outcomes (price, network) on the macro-level. The two main findings in case of the artificial financial market are: (1) the introduction of a second asset triggers alternating herding behavior of the informed traders. This results from simple profit considerations by the individual agents rather than any form of coordination between them. (2) The FTT `bans' the informed traders already for very small tax rates and in contrast the FAT has almost no effect on them with respect to which market they submit their orders to. On account of this, the FTT is able to reduce the distortions from the fundamental value in the taxed market for very small tax rates, while the FAT is affecting the overall trading process less and therefore an introduction might bear less risk. Interesting future projects for an agent-based financial market could incorporate findings of behavioral finance, like overconfidence, anchoring and adjustment or home bias to observe how such fallacies work together in a market setup. For the banking network, the most important finding is that banks show persistent behavior over the complete sample (including the GFC) and strong preference for continued lending relations. Another interesting finding is that in terms of intermediate relations the high directed clustering coefficient (macro-level) seems not to be preferred by the banks, but emerges unintendedly out of their behavior which is steered by other preferences. However, these are only first steps and it is necessary to look for robust universal results for different banking networks {{and at the same time}} overcome the temptation of `nice' findings such as a power-law in the degree distribution which are observed in other disciplines. Moreover, a more profound knowledge of the behavior of banks is needed to finally tackle the task of modelling the financial system and provide reliable policy recommendations. In the investigation of the agricultural commodity markets it is interesting to see that the commodity index traders follow a clear `long only' strategy. They most likely seek to meet the demand of investors who want to include these assets for diversification purposes in their portfolio; a strategy that should make them relatively independent from the developments on these markets. Therefore, it makes sense that they neither systematically affect the price nor react to it. The `typical' trader groups of commercials and non-commercials on the other side also do not influence the price but react to it (in opposing directions). The results for energy commodities and precious metals show that the Money Managers (non-commercials) seem to Granger cause the most extreme price increase in the case of two out of six commodities, namely crude oil and silver. Hence, there is some evidence that excessive speculation might have influenced the prices of commodities. However, the regulators, in my view, should be primarily concerned with the less regulated off exchange trading than with futures markets. In order to add new insights to the existing literature in the future, a more detailed data set would be required...|$|E
40|$|This paper investigates credit {{allocation}} {{policy making}} {{and its effect}} on economic development using bi-level programming. There are two challenging problems in bi-level credit allocation; at the first level government/public related institutes must allocate the credit strategically concerning sustainable development to regions and industrial sectors. At the second level, there are <b>agent</b> <b>banks,</b> which should allocate the credit tactically to individual applicants based on their own profitability and risk using their credit scoring models. There is a conflict of interest between these two stakeholders but the cooperation is inevitable. In this paper, a new bi-level programming formulation of the leader-follower game in association with sustainable development theory in the first level and data mining classifier at the second level is used to mathematically model the problem. The model is applied to a national development fund (NDF) as a government related organization and one of its <b>agent</b> <b>banks.</b> A new algorithm called Bi-level Genetic fuzzy apriori Algorithm (BGFAA) is introduced to solve the bilateral model. Experimental results are presented and compared with a unilateral policy making scenario by the leader.
