25|$|In looking <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>issue</b> of {{antidepressant}} use, some academics {{have highlighted}} {{the need to}} examine the use of antidepressants and other medical treatments in cross-cultural terms, {{due to the fact}} that various cultures prescribe and observe different manifestations, symptoms, meanings and associations of depression and other medical conditions within their populations. These cross-cultural discrepancies, it has been argued, then have implications on the perceived efficacy and use of antidepressants and other strategies in the treatment of depression in these different cultures. In India antidepressants are largely seen as tools to combat marginality, promising the individual the ability to re-integrate into society through their use—a view and association not observed in the West.|$|E
25|$|The airline {{suffered}} from a general mistrust both from the German and Allied authorities. The Germans generally did not trust any shipowners, since these had their fleet organized in Nortraship and used in Allied convoys. The Norwegian authorities in exile were also distrustful of DNL, because the airline had taken initiative to operate a route, essentially helping the German forces. There was also an uncertainty {{as to whether the}} national airline of Norway should continue to be private, or if a state-owned airline should be established. To look <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>issue,</b> the Norwegian authorities-in-exile established the Norwegian Civil Aviation Board to look at all matters regarding civil aviation. It was this board which was permitted to negotiate traffic rights with other countries, make purchase rights of aircraft and participated in the foundation of the International Air Transport Association and the International Civil Aviation Organization. The Swedish intercontinental airline, Svensk Interkontinental Lufttrafik managed to purchase ten Douglas DC-4 {{at the end of the}} war; they had initially planned on selling some to DDL and DNL, but were not permitted to negotiate any agreements with DNL.|$|E

25|$|In Norway, DNL was {{permitted}} to operate a limited route in Northern Norway, until the pilots fled to Britain in 1941 to join the resistance. The airline suffered from a general mistrust both from the German and Allied authorities. The Germans regarded Norwegian shipowners as highly suspicious people, since these had their fleet organized in Nortraship and used in Allied convoys. The Norwegian authorities in exile were also distrustful of DNL, because the airline had taken initiative to operate a route, essentially helping the German forces. There was also an uncertainty {{as to whether the}} national airline of Norway should continue to be private, or if a state-owned airline should be established.

25|$|Progestogens, in {{conjunction}} with the hormone prolactin, are involved in the maturation of the lobules, acini, and areola during pregnancy: mammary structures that estrogen has little to no direct effect on. However, there is no clinical evidence that progestogens enhance breast size, shape, or appearance in either transgender women or cisgender women, and one study found no benefit to breast hemicircumference over estrogen alone in a small sample of transgender women given both an estrogen and an oral progestogen (usually 10mg/day medroxyprogesterone acetate). However, the authors of the paper stated that the sample size was too small to make any definitive conclusions, and that further studies should be carried out to confirm whether progestogens significantly affect breast size and/or shape in transgender women. As of 2014, no additional study had looked <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>issue.</b> Anecdotal evidence from transgender women suggests that those who take progesterone supplements may experience more full breast development, including stage IV on the Tanner scale (many transgender women do not develop Tanner stage V breasts). However, there have been no formal studies with sufficiently large sample sizes to confirm this.|$|E
25|$|The myth of Crane {{has been}} studied by M. Renard and G. Dumezil. The first scholar sees in it a sort of {{parallel}} with the theology underlying the rite of the Tigillum Sororium. Crane is a nymph of the sacred wood of Helernus, located <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>issue</b> of the Tiber, whose festival of 1 February corresponded with that of Juno Sospita: Crane {{might be seen as}} a minor imago of the goddess. Her habit of deceiving her male pursuers by hiding in crags in the soil reveals her association not only with vegetation but also with rocks, caverns, and underpassages. Her nature looks to be also associated with vegetation and nurture: G. Dumezil has proved that Helernus was a god of vegetation, vegetative lushness and orchards, particularly associated with vetch. As Ovid writes in his Fasti, 1 June was the festival day of Carna, besides being the kalendary festival of the month of Juno and the festival of Juno Moneta. Ovid seems to purposefully conflate and identify Carna with Cardea in the aetiologic myth related above. Consequently, the association of both Janus and the god Helernus with Carna-Crane is highlighted in this myth: it was customary on that day to eat ivetch and lard, which were supposed to strengthen the body. Cardea had also magic powers for protecting doorways (by touching thresholds and posts with wet hawthorn twigs) and newborn children by the aggression of the striges (in the myth the young Proca). M. Renard sees the association of Janus with Crane as reminiscent of widespread rites of lustration and fertility performed through ritual walking under low crags or holes in the soil or natural hollows in trees, which in turn are reflected in the lustrative rite of the Tigillum Sororium.|$|E

500|$|Thomas G. Melish was a {{prominent}} Cincinnati businessman, who had inherited the Bromwell Wire Company. [...] Melish was also a coin collector, {{who came up with}} an idea for a commemorative coin that he would control. At the time, commemoratives were not sold by the government—Congress, in authorizing legislation, designated an organization which had the exclusive right to purchase the coins at face value and vend them to the public at a premium. The result was the 1936 Cincinnati Music Center half dollar, an issue controlled by Melish and issued to commemorate a fiftieth anniversary that did not exist. Melish sold only a few coins <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>issue</b> price, which was high, keeping back most for later sale once scarcity drove the price higher. By 1936, the market for U.S. commemorative coins had become, according to Q. David Bowers, [...] "as hot as a volcano", and [...] "Congress gave [...] permission to have his own commemorative coins minted and to charge the public whatever he liked for them!" [...] Melish, who had friends in Congress, had in early 1936 also tried to get lawmakers to authorize other commemorative issues that he would control. [...] The only one of these that came to fruition was the Cleveland Centennial half dollar.|$|E

500|$|After {{securing}} {{the loyalty of}} the populace and the army, and completing the repairs to the walls, Belisarius resolved to meet Gelimer in battle, and in mid-December marched out of Carthage {{in the direction of}} the fortified Vandal camp at Tricamarum, some 28km from Carthage. As at Ad Decimum, the Roman cavalry proceeded in advance of the infantry, and the ensuing Battle of Tricamarum was a purely cavalry affair, with Belisarius' army considerably outnumbered. Both armies kept their most untrustworthy elements—the Moors and Huns—in reserve. John the Armenian played the most important role on the Roman side, and Tzazon on the Vandal. John led repeated charges at the Vandal centre, culminating in the death of Tzazon. This was followed by a general Roman attack across the front and the collapse of the Vandal army, which retreated to its camp. Gelimer, seeing that all was lost, fled with a few attendants into the wilds of Numidia, whereupon the remaining Vandals gave up all thoughts of resistance and abandoned their camp to be plundered by the Romans. Like the previous battle at Ad Decimum, it is again notable that Belisarius failed to keep his forces together, and was forced to fight with a considerable numerical disadvantage. The dispersal of his army after the battle, looting heedlessly and leaving themselves vulnerable to a potential Vandal counter-attack was also an indication of the poor discipline in the Roman army and the command difficulties Belisarius faced. As Bury comments, the expedition's fate might have been quite different [...] "if Belisarius had been opposed to a commander of some ability and experience in warfare", and points out that Procopius himself [...] "expresses amazement <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>issue</b> of the war, and does not hesitate to regard it not as a feat of superior strategy but as a paradox of fortune".|$|E
