25|$|The {{displaced}} Pandits, many of {{who continue}} to live in temporary refugee camps in Jammu and Delhi, are still unable to safely return to their homeland. The lead in this act of ethnic cleansing was initially taken by the Jammu & Kashmir Liberation Front and the Hizbul Mujahideen. According to Indian media, <b>all</b> <b>this</b> <b>happened</b> at the instigation of Pakistan's Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) by a group of Kashmiri terrorist elements who were trained, armed and motivated by the ISI. Reportedly, organisations trained and armed by the ISI continued this ethnic cleansing until practically all the Kashmiri Pandits were driven out after having been subjected to numerous indignities and brutalities such as rape of their women, torture, forcible seizure of property etc.|$|E
25|$|The {{change in}} timing rushed {{preparations}} for the operations, which were hasty and imperfect as a result. The original instructions for the second Transjordan operations contained only a general statement that considerable help might be counted on from the Beni Sakhr and that Chauvel should keep in close touch with them. GHQ had no clear idea of {{the capabilities of the}} Beni Sakhr, but GHQ fitted them into Chauvel's battle and Allenby ordered Chauvel to attack on 30 April. <b>All</b> <b>this</b> <b>happened</b> without asking the opinion of either T. E. Lawrence or Captain Hubert Young, Lawrence's liaison officer with the Beni Sakhr, who was aware that the leader of the Arabs around Madaba was both perplexed and frightened by GHQ's reaction to his envoys. Lawrence was in Jerusalem during the Shunet Nimrin and Es Salt operations and claimed no knowledge of the Beni Sakhr, or their leader.|$|E

2500|$|As the Germans reached Lahti {{along the}} Loviisa–Vesijärvi railway, the Reds started {{building}} trenches, artillery batteries and other defensive posts to {{the slopes of}} the Salpausselkä ridge. In 13 April, the Detachment Brandenstein took the Orimattila village 20 kilometres south of Lahti. The offensive against the town was launched six days later on 19 April at 5 am. The main force commanded by the lieutenant colonel von Luck took the village of Villähde, 9 kilometres east of Lahti, at 1:00 pm and cut the Saint Petersburg railway, while the second unit attacked Lahti and reached the Railway Station at 7:00 am without any resistance. After taking the Hennala Garrison, the Germans entered the town in the evening. [...] Colonel Luck and his men headed for the General Hospital at 10:00 pm and most of Lahti was held by the Germans by 11:00 pm. <b>All</b> <b>this</b> <b>happened</b> with hardly any resistance by the surprised Reds. Instead of the town itself, the Reds were only defending their positions in the Salpausselkä ridge. It is unclear, why the attack took the Reds by surprise, although they knew the Germans were approaching. One explanation is their poor reconnaissance and surveillance.|$|E

2500|$|This {{time it was}} {{a problem}} of too much water. The Itawes river overflowed {{to the point that the}} water reached the cliff where the Ermita was built and the {{surrounding}} area, flooding the area and reaching several feet in height. Surprisingly, not a single drop of water entered the church, as if there was an invisible, mysterious wall preventing the water from going in. When, eventually, the river went back to its normal course, the Ermita was so dried, clean and tidy that no one would say any rain had fallen and not flooding had occurred in the vicinity. <b>All</b> <b>this</b> <b>happened</b> to the great surprise of the caretaker or [...] "ermitaño" [...] who, afraid for his life, had climbed to the altar of Our Lady and, on his knees, prayed for his safety.

Sources close to him, such as friends, say that the man had money that was to be owed to August, and there was no specific amount of debt mentioned.

2500|$|They left, {{together}} with Fabian Wegmann, the German from [...] <b>All</b> <b>this</b> <b>happened</b> {{before the first}} climb of the day, the Col du Tourmalet. On the Tourmalet, Wegmann and de la Fuente looked to be somewhat stronger than their two companions as they both sprinted to finish first on the top. De la Fuente won the sprint and so took the most points for the polka dot jersey, but also he won the Souvenir Jacques Goddet for coming through first {{on the top of}} the highest climb in the Pyrenees of this Tour which rendered him 5000 Euros. In the peloton, the team of [...] maintained the tempo to keep the leaders within reasonable distance and thus protect their yellow jersey. Thomas Voeckler won the sprint against Michael Rasmussen for the remaining points on top of the Tourmalet and he kept going. Although the leaders were about 4 minutes ahead at that time, he thought it would be useful to go after them on his own. At first, his plan appeared to be correct, as he closed the gap during the descent and managed to climb faster than the leaders on the Col d'Aspin. Halfway up the Aspin he was only 2'30" [...] behind, on top of the Aspin only 1'30". The four leaders stayed together on the Aspin, with now Wegmann sprinting faster than de la Fuente at the top. In the peloton, Rasmussen again took the points, but nothing more happened.|$|E
