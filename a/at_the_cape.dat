5|$|In his 1698 book Cosmotheoros, Christiaan Huygens {{estimated}} {{the distance to}} Sirius at 27664 times {{the distance of the}} Earth to the Sun (about 0.437 light years, translating to a parallax of roughly 7.5 arcseconds). There were several unsuccessful attempts to measure the parallax of Sirius: by Jacques Cassini (6 seconds); by some astronomers (including Nevil Maskelyne) using Lacaille's observations made <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Cape</b> of Good Hope (4 seconds); by Piazzi (the same amount); using Lacaille's observations made at Paris, more numerous and certain than those made <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Cape</b> (no sensible parallax); by Bessel (no sensible parallax).|$|E

5|$|The Invasion of the Cape Colony was a British {{military}} expedition {{launched in}} 1795 against the Dutch Cape Colony <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Cape</b> of Good Hope, {{the southern tip}} of Southern Africa. The Dutch colony <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Cape,</b> established in the seventeenth century, was at the time the only viable South African port for ships making the journey from Europe to the European colonies in the East Indies. It therefore held vital strategic importance, although it was otherwise economically insignificant. In the winter of 1794, during the French Revolutionary Wars, French troops entered the Dutch Republic, which was reformed into the Batavian Republic. In response, Great Britain launched operations against the Dutch Empire to use its facilities against the French Navy.|$|E
5|$|After {{receiving}} his J.D. {{degree from}} Harvard Law School in 2009, Kennedy was hired <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Cape</b> and Islands Office {{as an assistant}} district attorney (DA).

He resigned several months later, {{in preparation for the}} announcement that he would seek political office.|$|E
5|$|Enceladus {{is named}} after the giant Enceladus of Greek mythology.

He chose these names because Saturn, known in Greek mythology as Cronus, was the leader of the Titans.|$|E

5|$|Telescopium was {{introduced}} in 1751–52 by Nicolas-Louis de Lacaille with the French name le Telescope, depicting an aerial telescope, after he had observed and catalogued 10,000 southern stars during a two-year stay <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Cape</b> of Good Hope. He devised 14 new constellations in uncharted regions of the Southern Celestial Hemisphere not visible from Europe. All but one honored instruments that symbolised the Age of Enlightenment. Covering 40 degrees of the night sky, the telescope stretched out northwards between Sagittarius and Scorpius. Lacaille had Latinised its name to Telescopium by 1763.|$|E

5|$|He {{was made}} {{commander-in-chief}} in the Leeward Islands Station {{and given the}} task of transporting a large troop convoy. Twice he attempted the crossing of the Atlantic, and twice he was forced back by severe gales which ravaged his fleet and wrecked {{a number of the}} merchant ships in the convoy. He made a third attempt in 1796, and succeeded in shepherding the fleet to its destination. He was then active in using the troops and his naval forces to capture the islands of Saint Lucia, Saint Vincent and Grenada, before returning to England. He was made second in command <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Cape</b> of Good Hope in 1797, succeeding to commander-in-chief the following year, and he died while in command there in November 1798.|$|E
5|$|Hobbema {{departed}} Hull on 23 May {{and called}} at Methil and Loch Ewe before sailing for New York {{as a part}} of convoy ON 100 on 2 June.

After making two trips to Philadelphia and back, she departed for Cape Cod Bay to form up with convoy BX 28 for Halifax, where she arrived on 11 July. Hobbema sailed from Halifax to Sydney, Nova Scotia, in convoy HS 28, and from there sailed on 17 July for Liverpool with convoy SC 92. After her arrival on 31 July, she spent nearly a month at Liverpool before joining convoy ON 126 for New York, arriving at that destination on 19 September.|$|E
5|$|In 1804, a French {{squadron}} under Rear-Admiral Charles Linois used Batavia on Java {{as a base}} {{to attack}} the China Fleet, although the attempt ended in failure at the Battle of Pulo Aura. Java presented a clear threat to British maritime interests in the South China Sea, but the British squadron based in the Indian Ocean was too weak in 1805 to consider operations so far from its main base at Madras while Linois remained active. By the start of 1806, Linois had sailed into the Atlantic and an expeditionary force had seized the Dutch base <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Cape</b> of Good Hope, securing the western Indian Ocean and providing reinforcements that allowed Rear-Admiral Sir Edward Pellew to begin operations against the Dutch forces in the East Indies.|$|E

5|$|Initially part of squadrons {{cruising}} off the French coast, {{she played}} {{an important part in}} the Action of 23 April 1794, capturing the French frigate Engageante, and at a later engagement, where she helped to capture the French frigate Virginie. From 1797 until the early 19th century she had especial success against privateers, capturing a large number in the West Indies and in the Atlantic. She had a narrow escape from a superior French force in 1801, but was able to batter her pursuer, the 40-gun Bravoure into submission. She was prevented from capturing her by the arrival of French reinforcements. Her last years were spent on a variety of stations, including <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Cape</b> of Good Hope and the East Indies. Laid up in 1807, she was sold for breaking up in 1811.|$|E

5|$|MOL Launches {{would have}} been {{conducted}} from Launch Complex 40 <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Cape</b> Canaveral Air Force Station, and Space Launch Complex 6 at Vandenberg Air Force Base. In 1966, a test flight was launched from LC-40, using a Titan IIIC. It consisted of the Gemini B spacecraft, built from the spacecraft used for the Gemini 2 test flight, atop OPS 0855, a boilerplate MOL space station. Gemini B was released on a suborbital trajectory, and descended to Earth to test modifications made to the heat shield, and ensure that the access hatch would not affect its performance. OPS 0855 continued on to orbit. Early MOL stations would have only been manned by a single crew, launched with the station. Later stations {{would have been}} designed to be resupplied, and support multiple crews, delivered by additional Gemini spacecraft, or derivatives.|$|E
5|$|Meermin {{was built}} {{for use as a}} slave ship in the VOC's African trade; between 1658 and 1799 the VOC {{acquired}} and transported 63,000slaves to its Cape Colony, now part of South Africa. The ship began her maiden voyage at Texel, an island off the coast of what is now the Netherlands, on 21January 1761, with a crew of 62 under the command of Captain Hendrik Worms; she arrived <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Cape</b> of Good Hope on 15June.

5|$|The Capitulation of Saldanha Bay saw the {{surrender}} to the British Royal Navy of a Dutch expeditionary force sent to recapture the Dutch Cape Colony in 1796 during the French Revolutionary Wars.

Concerned by the threat posed to the trade routes between Great Britain and British India by the Dutch Cape Colony in Southern Africa, a British expeditionary force had landed at Simon's Town in June 1795 and forced {{the surrender}} of the colony in a short campaign. The British commander, Vice-Admiral Sir George Elphinstone, then reinforced the garrison and stationed a naval squadron <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Cape</b> to protect the British conquest.|$|E
