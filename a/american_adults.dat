25|$|As one of {{the largest}} growing {{concerns}} <b>American</b> <b>adults</b> have of current Internet privacy policies, identity and credit theft remain a constant figure in the debate surrounding privacy online.

A Pew Forum report on American religion found that Muslims accounted for 0.9% of <b>American</b> <b>adults</b> in 2014, up from 0.4% in 2007, due largely to immigration. Retention rates were high, at 77%, similar to Hindus (80%) and Jews (75%); most people who leave these religions become unaffiliated, although ex-Muslims {{were more likely to}} be Christians than ex-Hindus or ex-Jews were.
