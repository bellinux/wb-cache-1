40|$|The crystal {{structures}} of two medium substances {{that appeared in}} a process of thermal decomposition of praseodymium(III) acetate dihydrate to reach oxide are determined by X-ray powder diffraction data. Samples were heat-treated and measured with X-ray data. By the analysis of those powder diffraction patterns, it is cleared that praseodymium (III) acetate dihydrate changes into Pr(CH₃COO) ₃ [A phase] → PrOCH₃COO [B phase] → Pr₂O₂CO₃ [C phase] → Pr₂O₃ [D phase]. The crystal structure was determined by visual comparison with observed powder pattern and calculated one with the crystal model. The structures of B, C and D phases are characterized by stacking of atomic (O, Pr) or molecular (acetic <b>acid,</b> <b>carbonate)</b> layers perpendicular to c. The coordination-numbers of praseodymiusn atom are 6 in B phase, 6 and 8 in C phase and 6 in D phase, respectively. 酢酸プラセオジムの熱分解過程に現れる 2 つの中間物質の結晶構造をX線粉末回析データで解析した。試料を熱処理し，X線で測定した。これらの回析強度曲線を解析して，酢酸プラセオジムはPr(CH₃COO) ₃ [A 相] → PrOCH₃COO [B 相] → Pr₂O₂CO₃ [C 相] → Pr₂O₃ [D 相]へと熱分解することがわかった。結晶構造は測定した強度曲線と結晶モデルによる計算強度曲線とを比較して決定した。解析したB, C, D相の結晶構造は酸素やプラセオジム原子及び酢酸又は炭酸分子が層状にc軸方向に積み重なった構造である。プラセオジム原子の配位数はB相が 6, C相が 6 と 8 ，D相が 6 である...|$|E

After aging for 24 h, the precipitate was filtrated and washed several times, followed by drying for 12 h in an oven at 100 °C. Then, the precipitate was calcined at 600 °C for 2 h to form AZO:Y nanoparticles.|$|E
40|$|Porous NiTi alloys with {{different}} porosities were fabricated by capsule-free {{hot isostatic pressing}} (CF-HIP) with ammonium <b>acid</b> <b>carbonate</b> (NH 4 HCO 3) as a space-holder. The microstructure and porosity of porous NiTi produced {{with different}} NH 4 HCO 3 contents and sintering temperatures were determined. Two different creep expansion models are used to explain the pore expansion mechanism during the sintering process, which involves slow and continuous reduction of the argon pressure at high temperatures. When the NH 4 HCO 3 content is 30 wt. % and the sintering temperature is 1050 °C, an ideal porous NiTi alloy with 48 vol. % porosity and circular pores (50 - 800 μm) is obtained. Compression tests indicate that the porous NiTi alloys with 21 - 48 % porosity possess not only lower Young's moduli of 6 - 11 GPa (close to that of human bones) but also higher compression strength and excellent superelasticity. Cell cultures reveal that the porous NiTi prepared here has no apparent cytotoxicity. The porous materials are thus promising biomaterials in hard tissue replacements. © 2007 Acta Materialia Inc. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E
40|$|In {{the region}} of Bohemian Cretaceous Basin can be found some springs with {{specific}} yield over 100 l/s. The doyen of Czech hydrogeology Prof. Hynie described some of those springs to be of karst origin and as the most permeable area he described the so-called transitional facies between shallow-water sandstones and deep-water marlstones. Possibilities of karstification {{have not yet been}} studied for rocks in the BCB, so the origin of well-permeable pathways in the BCB is a subject of speculations. This thesis deals with the question of which sedimentary rocks potentially allow the generation of karst permeability in the BCB. To do so, rock samples drilled from outcrops in the BCB were subjected to a fast dissolution simulation by leaching in hydrochloric <b>acid.</b> <b>Carbonate</b> content is measured by a standard and one's own method. Mineral composition, grain size and microscopic structure of rocks are studied with SEM. As is shown, the border of rock karstification is not defined just by the carbonate content, but also the grain size, rock structure and by the occurrence of fine secondary silicate content. Concerning the amount of dissolvable compounds, the border of total disintegration can be at 30 % of carbonate content for some rocks, but the most resistant rocks (mostly fine rocks with SiO 2 matrix) stay intact [...] ...|$|E

30|$|Soil {{properties}} in the wheat rhizosphere differed significantly among fertilization regimes. Soil pH {{played a key role}} in soil quality and crop production. Although soil pH was significantly higher for the MNPK than the NPK treatment, both treatments significantly decreased soil pH compared with CK. This confirmed the positive impact of inorganic fertilizer on soil acidification (Guo et al. 2010), as well as the positive effect of manure on alleviation of soil acidification, likely due to the buffering functions of organic <b>acids,</b> <b>carbonates</b> and bicarbonates (Whalen et al. 2000; Garcia-Gil et al. 2004). Furthermore, manure containing macronutrients obviously led to accumulation of soil OM (Xie et al. 2014).|$|R
40|$|While apatite {{carbonate}} 13 C {{analysis is}} a useful tool in palaeodietary research, the vulnerability of carbonates to diagenesis necessitates careful sample preparation. The most common preparation method involves dilute acetic acid treatments to remove highly soluble mineral contaminants. However, there is variation in both treatment time and acid concentration. This study addresses the impact of such variation on carbonate 13 C and 18 O, sample loss in solution, and sample Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) characteristics. Samples of fresh and archaeological bone were treated with 1. 0 M and 0. 1 M acetic <b>acid.</b> <b>Carbonate</b> 13 C and 18 O, sample loss and FTIR characteristics were measured at treatment times of 4 to 24 h. The results suggest that 4 h of treatment suffice to remove highly soluble contaminants, and that longer treatment times can lead to sample recrystallization. Some samples treated with 1. 0 M acid showed unacceptable loss or possible recrystallization, suggesting that 0. 1 M acid treatment is preferable. However, the more dilute acid caused smaller shifts in 13 C and 18 O for all samples and treatment times. Thus, while 0. 1 M acid appears to produce superior sample quality, it may not produce results directly {{comparable to those of}} 1. 0 M acid treatments. This has important implications for the comparison of apatite carbonate stable isotope values reported in the literature...|$|E
40|$|This {{study was}} carried out on milk samples {{collected}} from farms and sales points in Khartoum State. Two hundred and forty milk samples were randomly collected. One-hundred and twenty milk samples were collected during summer and 120 milk samples were collected during winter from the same sources. The milk samples were examined for microbial quality, chemical preservative, drug residues and physical characteristics. Total bacterial counts, isolation and identification of microorganisms from antibiotic contaminated milk and resistance of isolated bacteria to antibiotics were estimated. The chemical preservative residues examination included the detection of formaldehyde, hydrogen peroxide, boric <b>acid,</b> <b>carbonate,</b> alkalinity of ash and detection of antibiotics residue. The physical properties of milk studied were temperature, acidity and pH. The present study revealed high average of total bacterial counts (5. 15 × 1011 ± 5. 57 × 1011 cfu/ml) in milk samples. During summer season the total bacterial counts of milk (1. 02 × 1012 ± 3. 4 × 1011 cfu/ml) was significantly (P< 0. 001) higher than winter (1. 30 × 1010 216 × 109 cfu/ml). In this study {{it was found that}} 5 (2. 08 %) of the milk samples contained formaldehyde, 1 (0. 41 %) positive to hydrogen peroxide and 4 (1. 6 %) showed alkalinity of ash. However all the milk samples examined contained no boric acid. Moreover, 30 (12. 25 %) and 16 (6. 66 %) milk samples were contaminated with antibiotic and sulphanomide, respectively. ix The mean temperature of milk samples during summer and winter was 27 ± 3. 79 C. During summer and winter seasons the temperatures was 28 ± 2. 44 C and 25 ± 3. 86 C, respectively. The mean acidity (0. 20 ± 0. 22 %) was highly significant (P< 0. 001) compared to that recorded during winter (0. 19 ± 0. 22 %). Milk samples revealed mean pH value of 6. 6 ± 0. 44, while during summer and winter they were 6. 7 ± 23 and 6. 6 ± 0. 58, respectively. It was also found that the mean shelf life of milk samples were 5. 2 ± 1. 74 days, while during summer the shelf life was significantly (P< 0. 05) lower (4. 5 ± 1. 92 days) then during winter (5. 9 ± 1. 23 days). In the present study most of the bacteria isolated were Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus spp., Corynebacterium ovis, E. coli, Citrobacter spp., Kelbsiella spp., Proteus spp. and Pseudomonas spp. The Isolated bacteria showed wide range of multiple resistances and the highest resistance was against penicillin, clindamycin, collxacillin and ampicillin, while chloramphenicol showed the highest antimicrobial activity against the tested organisms followed by gentamicin and pipercilli...|$|E
