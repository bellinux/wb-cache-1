This event was merely a hollow victory that failed to secure Poland's future. Matejko shows that the homage was an empty gesture <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> Prussia that exploited it rather than Poland.

The best evidence presented by the prosecution was the testimony of Sharp's wife Eliza that she heard the killer's voice <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> distinctly high-pitched.
