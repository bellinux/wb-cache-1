40|$|Pulmonary {{involvement}} {{is common in}} rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and affects all {{the components of the}} lung. Interstitial lung disease (ILD) is the most predominant pulmonary manifestation and has been identified as the main cause of morbidity and mortality in RA. Clinically significant RA-ILD occurs in approximately 10 % of RA patients. Several risk factors, such as old age, male gender, and smoking, have been reported to date. Histologically, the proportion of the usual interstitial pneumonia (UIP) pattern is higher in RA-ILD than in ILD associated with other connective tissue diseases, <b>and</b> <b>RA-ILD</b> also shows nonspecific interstitial pneumonia and organizing pneumonia patterns. High-resolution computed tomography scans are highly predictive of the histological UIP pattern with a specificity of 96 %- 100 %. Acute exacerbation, which is the acute deterioration of the respiratory status characterized by newly developed bilateral infiltrates with unknown etiologies, has been reported in RA-ILD. Although acute exacerbation of RA-ILD has high mortality, similar to that of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, its incidence is lower in RA-ILD than in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. A consensus treatment has not yet been established. Current therapeutic regimens typically include corticosteroids with or without cytotoxic agents. Recent large longitudinal studies reported that the prognosis of RA-ILD was poor with a median survival of 2. 6 - 3. 0 years. Furthermore, histological and/or radiological patterns, such as UIP or non-UIP, have significant prognostic implications. RA-ILD patients with histological or radiological UIP patterns have poorer prognoses than those with non-UIP patterns. This review assessed the characteristics of RA-ILD by overviewing recent studies in the field and focused on the clinical significance of histological and/or radiological patterns in RA-ILD...|$|E

Given that familial pulmonary fibrosis (FPF) <b>and</b> <b>RA-ILD</b> frequently share the usual pattern of interstitial pneumonia and common environmental risk factors, we hypothesised that the two diseases might share additional risk factors, including FPF-linked genes. Our aim was to identify coding mutations of FPF-risk genes associated with RA-ILD. We used whole exome sequencing (WES), followed by restricted analysis of a discrete number of FPF-linked genes and performed a burden test to assess the excess number of mutations in RA-ILD patients compared to controls. Among the 101 RA-ILD patients included, 12 (11. 9 %) had 13 WES-identified heterozygous mutations in the TERT, RTEL 1, PARN or SFTPC coding regions. The burden test, based on 81 RA-ILD patients and 1010 controls of European ancestry, revealed an excess of TERT, RTEL 1, PARN or SFTPC mutations in RA-ILD patients (OR 3. 17, 95 % CI 1. 53 - 6. 12; p= 9. 45 x 10 - 4). Telomeres were shorter in RA-ILD patients with a TERT, RTEL 1 or PARN mutation than in controls (p= 2. 87 x 10 - 2) ...|$|E
40|$|Background: Increased protein citrullination and peptidylarginine deiminases (PADIs), which {{catalyze}} the citrullination process, {{are central}} in Rheumatoid arthritis pathogenesis and probably {{involved in the}} initial steps towards autoimmunity. Approximately, 10 % of RA patients develop clinically significantly ILD. A possible shared role of protein citrullination in rheumatoid arthritis associated interstitial lung disease (<b>RA-ILD),</b> <b>and</b> idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) pathogenesis remains unclear. Methods: We evaluated PADI 2 and PADI 4 mRNA expression in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) cells of 59 patients with IPF, 27 patients <b>RA-ILD</b> <b>and</b> 10 healthy controls. PADI 2 and 4 expression was analyzed by western blot and immunohistochemistry. Citrullinated protein levels were also quantified. Results: PADI 4 mRNA and protein levels were higher in <b>RA-ILD</b> <b>and</b> IPF than controls. Furthermore, PADI 4 mRNA levels showed an increase among smokers in RA-ILD. PADI 4 expression was detected in granulocytes and macrophages in all groups, with the strongest cytoplasmic expression observed in granulocytes in <b>RA-ILD</b> <b>and</b> IPF. PADI 2 mRNA and immunostaining of BAL cells, were similar in all groups among smokers. Overall, stronger staining was observed in current smokers. Citrullinated peptides were significantly increased in IPF compared to <b>RA-ILD</b> <b>and</b> controls. In <b>RA-ILD,</b> protein citrullination strongly correlated with PADI 4 expression and anti-citrullinated protein antibodies (ACPAs). Conclusions: These {{results suggest that the}} citrullination pathway is upregulated in IPF <b>and</b> in <b>RA-ILD...</b>|$|R
30|$|Data from {{idiopathic}} interstitial pneumonia (IIP) population {{show that}} HRCT chest can accurately predict {{the presence of}} histopathologic UIP pattern in a subset of patients (Hunninghake et al. 2003) and several studies in RA-ILD have suggested similar specificity (Assayag et al. 2014). So UIP pattern on HRCT is clinically relevant <b>and</b> all <b>RA-ILD</b> patients should undergo evaluation of their HRCT pattern. HRCT is widely available, reliable in hands of experienced radiologists, low cost and low risk compared to surgical lung biopsy. Patients with UIP pattern and extensive fibrosis on HRCT should be counseled on their poor prognosis and appropriate patients should be considered for lung transplantation (Kim et al. 2010).|$|R

40|$|Objective. To {{evaluate}} {{the effect of}} rituximab (RTX) in patients with RA-related interstitial lung disease (<b>RA-ILD)</b> <b>and</b> identify factors associated with outcome after treatment. Methods. An observational study of patients with RA-ILD was conducted from a cohort of RTX-treated RA patients in a single centre for > 10 years. Progression was defined {{by any of the}} following: a decrease of pre-RTX forced vital capacity (FVC) > 10 % or diffusion capacity of carbon monoxide (DLCO) > 15 % predicted, worsening of the ILD score or death from progressive ILD. Results. Of 700 RA patients treated with RTX, 56 had RA-ILD (prevalence = 8 %). After RTX, new ILD was diagnosed in 3 / 700 patients (incidence = 0. 4 %). Data for lung assessment were available for 44 / 56 patients. The median relative change pre- and post-RTX for FVC were − 2. 4 % and + 1. 2 % (P = 0. 025) and for DLCO were − 4. 4 % and − 1. 3 % (P = 0. 045). Post-RTX, 23 / 44 (52 %) were stable and 7 / 44 (16 %) had improved. Of the 14 (32 %) with ILD that progressed, 9 / 56 (16 %) were deaths due to progressive ILD. Factors associated with ILD progression were radiologic pattern of usual interstitial pneumonia, a previous history of lung progression and pre-RTX DLCO < 46 % predicted. Of those whose ILD progressed, 11 / 14 (79 %) had severe ILD before RTX [median DLCO 42 % predicted (interquartile range 41 – 49) ]. Conclusion. In this cohort of patients where RTX was given for arthritis, most patients with ILD pre-RTX remained stable/improved after treatment over a prolonged follow-up period. Patients who deteriorated/died had the most severe ILD pre-RTX, suggesting the drug was not contributory. RTX appears to be an acceptable therapeutic choice for patients with <b>RA-ILD</b> <b>and</b> further studies are warranted...|$|R
40|$|Introduction. Development of {{an animal}} model of {{rheumatoid}} arthritis-interstitial lung disease (<b>RA-ILD)</b> <b>and</b> improved knowledge of the pathogenesis of RA-ILD may facilitate earlier diagnosis {{and the development of}} more effective targeted therapies. Methods. Adult male Wistar rats were studied in an adjuvant arthritis (AA) model induced by the injection of Freund’s complete adjuvant (FCA). Rats were sacrificed on days 7, 14, 21, and 28 after FCA injection. Lung tissue was obtained for histopathological examination and evaluation of Caveolin- 1 (Cav- 1) and transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β 1) protein expression levels. Results. Pulmonary inflammation was evident in lung tissue from day 21 after FCA injection. Inflammation and mild fibrosis were observed in lung tissue on day 28 after FCA injection. Cav- 1 protein expression was significantly decreased from day 7 through day 28 and TGF-β 1 protein expression was significantly increased on day 28 after FCA injection compared to control (P< 0. 05). Conclusion. We established an AA rat model that exhibited the extra-articular complication of RA-ILD. We identified Cav- 1 and TGF-β 1 as protein biomarkers of RA-ILD in this model and propose their signaling pathway as a possible target for therapeutic intervention...|$|R
40|$|Rationale: Rheumatoid arthritis-associated {{interstitial}} {{lung disease}} (RA-ILD) is a disease associated with morbidity and mortality. There is a high prevalence of usual interstitial pneumonia (UIP) pattern in <b>RA-ILD</b> <b>and</b> similarities have been observed between patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) and the UIP form of RA-ILD. The GAP (gender, age, physiology) model {{has been shown to}} predict mortality in patients with IPF, but its ability to predict mortality in RA-ILD is not known. Methods: We identified 309 patients with RA-ILD at 4 academic centers with ongoing longitudinal cohorts of patients with ILD (Mayo Clinic, University of Ulsan, University of California, San Francisco and University of Modena & Reggio Emilia). The primary endpoint was mortality. To handle the issue of missing data, multiple imputation by iterative chained equations was used, resulting in 20 completed datasets. Linear and logistic imputation models were used for continuous and binary covariates, respectively. Using the GAP model as the baseline mortality prediction model, we determined the additive model performance for mortality risk prediction by incorporating additional variables. Model discrimination was assessed using the c-index. Results: Patients had a mean age of 65 years and were predominantly female (54...|$|R
40|$|Objective. To {{evaluate}} whether serum titers of second-generation anticyclic citrullinated peptide antibodies (anti-CCP 2) {{are associated with}} the severity and extent of interstitial lung disease in rheumatoid arthritis (RA-ILD). Methods. In across-sectional study, 39 RA-ILD patients confirmed by high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) were compared with 42 RA without lung involvement (RA only). Characteristics related to RA-ILD were assessed in all of the patients and serum anti-CCP 2 titers quantified. Results. Higher anti-CCP 2 titers were found in RA-ILD compared with RA only (medians 77. 9 versus 30. 2 [*]U/mL, P< 0. 001). In the logistic regression analysis after adjustment for age, disease duration (DD), smoke exposure, disease activity, functioning, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and methotrexate (MTX) treatment duration, the characteristics associated with RA-ILD were higher anti-CCP 2 titers (P= 0. 003) and + RF (P= 0. 002). In multivariate linear regression, the variables associated with severity of ground-glass score were anti-CCP 2 titers (P= 0. 02) and with fibrosis score DD (P= 0. 01), anti-CCP 2 titers (P< 0. 001), and MTX treatment duration (P< 0. 001). Conclusions. Anti-CCP 2 antibodies are markers of severity <b>and</b> extent of <b>RA-ILD</b> in HRCT. Further longitudinal studies are required to identify if higher anti-CCP 2 titers are associated with worst prognosis in RA-ILD...|$|R
40|$|Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) is {{the most}} common Connective Tissue Disease (CTD) and {{represents}} an increasing burden on global health resources. Interstitial lung disease (ILD) has been recognised as a complication of RA but its potential for mortality and morbidity has arguably been under appreciated for decades. New studies have underscored a significant lifetime risk of ILD development in RA. Contemporary work has identified an increased risk of mortality associated with the Usual Interstitial Pneumonia (UIP) pattern which shares similarity with the most devastating of the interstitial pulmonary diseases, namely Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF). In this paper, we discuss recent studies highlighting the associated increase in mortality in RA-UIP. We explore associations between radiological and histopathological features of <b>RA-ILD</b> <b>and</b> the prognostic implications of same. We emphasise the need for translational research in this area given the growing burden of RA-ILD. We highlight the importance of the respiratory physician as a key stakeholder in the multidisciplinary management of this disorder. RA-ILD focused research offers the opportunity to identify early asymptomatic disease and define the natural history of this extra articular manifestation. This may provide a unique opportunity to define key regulatory fibrotic events driving progressive disease. We also discuss some of the more challenging and novel aspects of therapy for RA-ILD...|$|R
40|$|Interstitial {{lung disease}} (ILD) {{is one of}} the major causes of {{morbidity}} and mortality of patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Accompanying the increased number of reports on the development or exacerbation of ILD in RA patients following therapy with biological disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs), RA-associated ILD (RA-ILD) has aroused renewed interest. Although such cases have been reported mainly in association with the use of tumor necrosis factor inhibitors, the use of other biological DMARDs has also become a matter of concern. Nevertheless, it is difficult to establish a causative relationship between the use of biological DMARDs and either the development or exacerbation of ILD. Such pulmonary complications may occur in the natural course of RA regardless of the use of biological DMARDs. Since rheumatologists currently aim to achieve remission in RA patients, the administration of biological DMARDs is increasing, even for those with RA-ILD. However, there are no reliable, evidence-based guidelines for deciding whether biological DMARDs can be safely introduced <b>and</b> continued in <b>RA-ILD</b> patients. A standardized staging system for pulmonary conditions of RA-ILD patients is needed when making therapeutic decisions at baseline and monitoring during biological DMARD therapy. Based on the available information regarding the safety of biological DMARDs and the predictive factors for a worse prognosis, this review discusses candidate parameters for risk evaluation of ILD in RA patients who are scheduled to receive biological antirheumatic therapy...|$|R
40|$|Source of support: Departmental sources Background: Interstitial {{lung disease}} (ILD) in {{rheumatoid}} arthritis (RA) {{is associated with}} a poor prognosis. The {{purpose of this study was}} to assess the characteristics of ILD that are associated with RA. Material/Methods: This was a retrospective study of 544 Chinese patients with RA (427 women <b>and</b> 117 men). <b>RA-ILD</b> was diag-nosed by high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT). Patients with RA-ILD or with RA alone were compared in terms of age, sex distribution, duration of disease, clinical and laboratory parameters, history of smoking, and medication. Results: Based on HRCT imaging, 83 (15. 26 %) patients with RA were diagnosed with ILD. ILD was more frequent in old-er patients (59. 60 ± 9. 66 vs. 50. 54 ± 13. 76 years, P< 0. 001), in those with a longer duration of disease (7. 46 ± 7. 40 vs. 5. 27 ± 6. 32 years, P= 0. 013) and in male patients (34. 9 % vs. 19. 1 %, P= 0. 001). RA-ILD was found to be asso-ciated with hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) positivity (odds ratio [OR]= 2. 56, 95 % confidence interval [95 % CI] 1. 02 – 6. 43) and smoking (OR= 3. 38, 95 % CI 1. 65 – 6. 95).
