5|$|The muscular {{layer of}} the {{esophagus}} has two types of muscle. The upper third of the esophagus contains striated muscle, the lower third contains smooth muscle, and the middle third contains a mixture of both. Muscle is arranged in two layers: {{one in which the}} muscle fibers run longitudinal to the esophagus, and the other in which the fibers encircle the esophagus. These are separated by the myenteric plexus, a tangled network of nerve fibers involved in the secretion of mucus and in peristalsis of the smooth muscle of the esophagus. The outermost {{layer of the}} esophagus is the <b>adventitia</b> in most of its length, with the abdominal part being covered in serosa. This makes it distinct from many other structures in the gastrointestinal tract that only have a serosa.|$|E
25|$|Retroperitoneal {{parts are}} covered with <b>adventitia.</b> They blend into the {{surrounding}} tissue and are fixed in position. For example, the retroperitoneal section of the duodenum usually passes through the transpyloric plane. These include the esophagus, pylorus of the stomach, distal duodenum, ascending colon, descending colon and anal canal. In addition, the oral cavity has <b>adventitia.</b>|$|E
25|$|As {{with all}} other arteries, the aorta {{is made up of}} three layers, the intima, the media, and the <b>adventitia.</b> The intima is in direct contact with the blood inside the vessel, and mainly {{consists}} of a layer of endothelial cells on a basement membrane; the media contains connective and muscle tissue, and the vessel is protected on the outside by the <b>adventitia,</b> comprising connective tissue.|$|E
25|$|Syphilis. The {{third stage}} of {{syphilis}} also manifests as aneurysm of the aorta, which {{is due to}} loss of the vasa vasorum in the tunica <b>adventitia.</b>|$|E
25|$|A true {{aneurysm}} is {{one that}} involves all three layers of the wall of an artery (intima, media and <b>adventitia).</b> True aneurysms include atherosclerotic, syphilitic, and congenital aneurysms, as well as ventricular aneurysms that follow transmural myocardial infarctions (aneurysms that involve all layers of the attenuated wall of the heart are also considered true aneurysms).|$|E
25|$|The cortex {{is mainly}} {{made up of}} thymocytes, {{supported}} by a network of finely-branched epithelial reticular cells, which is continuous with a similar network in the medulla. This network forms an <b>adventitia</b> to the blood vessels, which enter the cortex via septa near the junction with the medulla. The cortex is {{the location of the}} earliest events in thymocyte development, where T-cell receptor gene rearrangement and positive selection takes place.|$|E
25|$|Saccular aneurysms {{tend to have}} a lack of {{tunica media}} and elastic lamina around its dilated {{location}} (congenital), with wall of sac made up of thickened hyalinized intima and <b>adventitia.</b> In addition, some parts of the brain vasculature are inherently weak—particularly areas along the Circle of Willis, where small communicating vessels link the main cerebral vessels. These areas are particularly susceptible to saccular aneurysms. Approximately 25% of patients have multiple aneurysms, predominantly when there is familial pattern.|$|E
25|$|The healthy {{epicardial}} {{coronary artery}} {{consists of three}} layers, the intima, media, and <b>adventitia.</b> Atheroma {{and changes in the}} artery wall usually result in small aneurysms (enlargements) just large enough to compensate for the extra wall thickness with no change in the lumen diameter. However, eventually, typically as a result of rupture of vulnerable plaques and clots within the lumen over the plaque, stenosis (narrowing) of the vessel develops in some areas. Less frequently, the artery enlarges so much that a gross aneurysmal enlargement of the artery results. All three results are often observed, at different locations, within the same individual.|$|E
25|$|However, the {{degradation}} of the tunica media {{by means of a}} proteolytic process seems to be the basic pathophysiologic mechanism of AAA development. Some researchers report increased expression and activity of matrix metalloproteinases in individuals with AAA. This leads to elimination of elastin from the media, rendering the aortic wall more susceptible to the influence of blood pressure. Other reports have suggested the serine protease granzyme B may contribute to aortic aneurysm rupture through the cleavage of decorin, leading to disrupted collagen organization and reduced tensile strength of the <b>adventitia.</b> There is also a reduced amount of vasa vasorum in the abdominal aorta (compared to the thoracic aorta); consequently, the tunica media must rely mostly on diffusion for nutrition, which makes it more susceptible to damage.|$|E
2500|$|The wall of {{the vagina}} from the lumen {{outwards}} consists firstly of a mucosa of non-keratinized stratified squamous epithelium with an underlying lamina propria of connective tissue, secondly a layer of smooth muscle with bundles of circular fibers internal to longitudinal fibers, and thirdly an outer layer of connective tissue called the <b>adventitia.</b> Some texts list four layers by counting the two sublayers of the mucosa (epithelium and lamina propria) separately. [...] The lamina propria is rich in blood vessels and lymphatic channels. The muscular layer is composed of smooth muscle fibers, with an outer layer of longitudinal muscle, an inner layer of circular muscle, and oblique muscle fibers between. The outer layer, the <b>adventitia,</b> is a thin dense layer of connective tissue, and it blends with loose connective tissue containing blood vessels, lymphatic vessels and nerve fibers that is present between the pelvic organs.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Adventitia</b> is the {{outermost}} connective tissue covering of an organ, vessel, or other structure. [...] It is {{also called the}} tunica <b>adventitia</b> or the tunica externa.|$|E
50|$|Within the periureteral <b>adventitia</b> these arteries {{extensively}} anastomose thus permitting surgical {{mobilization of}} the ureter without compromising the vascular supply {{as long as}} the <b>adventitia</b> is not stripped. Lymphatic and venous drainage mostly parallels that of the arterial supply.|$|E
5000|$|In {{arteries and}} veins the inner wall is the tunica intima, the outer wall is the tunica <b>adventitia,</b> {{and they are}} {{separated}} by the tunica media. More generally, the tunica <b>adventitia</b> or simply the [...] "adventitia" [...] is the outermost connective tissue covering round any internal organ.|$|E

It is mainly composed of collagen and, in arteries, is supported by external elastic lamina. The collagen serves to anchor the blood vessel to nearby organs, giving it stability.|$|E

50|$|In the {{gastrointestinal}} tract, {{the muscular}} layer {{is bounded in}} most cases by serosa. However, at the oral cavity, thoracic esophagus, ascending colon, descending colon and the rectum, the muscularis externa is instead bounded by <b>adventitia.</b> (The muscularis externa of the duodenum is bounded by both tissue types.) Generally, {{if it is a}} part of the digestive tract that is free to move, it is covered by serosa, and if it is relatively rigidly fixed, it is covered by <b>adventitia.</b>|$|E

50|$|The general {{structure}} of lymphatics {{is based on}} that of blood vessels. There is an inner lining of single flattened epithelial cells (simple squamous epithelium) composed of a type of epithelium that is called endothelium, and the cells are called endothelial cells. This layer functions to mechanically transport fluid and since the basement membrane on which it rests is discontinuous; it leaks easily. The next layer is that of smooth muscles that are arranged in a circular fashion around the endothelium, which by shortening (contracting) or relaxing alter the diameter (caliber) of the lumen. The outermost layer is the <b>adventitia</b> that consists of fibrous tissue. The {{general structure}} described here is seen only in larger lymphatics; smaller lymphatics have fewer layers. The smallest vessels (lymphatic or lymph capillaries) lack both the muscular layer and the outer <b>adventitia.</b> As they proceed forward and in their course are joined by other capillaries, they grow larger and first take on an <b>adventitia,</b> and then smooth muscles.|$|E
50|$|The tunicae {{of blood}} vessels are three layers: an inner, middle, and outer layer that are called, respectively, the tunica intima, the tunica media, and the tunica externa (or tunica <b>adventitia).</b>|$|E

50|$|The vasa vasorum {{are found}} in large vein and arteries such as the aorta and its branches. These small vessels serve to provide blood supply and {{nourishment}} for tunica <b>adventitia</b> and outer parts of tunica media of large vessels.|$|E
50|$|The third {{classification}} is adventitial fibroplasia, {{in which}} collagen replaces the fibrous <b>adventitia</b> and {{extends beyond the}} artery. This form is considered rare but angiographic appearance may look similar to the focal subtype of FMD, making the distinction difficult.|$|E
