At the same times it tries to outline possible activities to reduce the risk of <b>vocational</b> <b>schools</b> in Prague business failure. Each Prague secondary <b>vocational</b> <b>school</b> or <b>vocational</b> <b>school,</b> however, is an organization totally unique, and therefore it must always be based also on the specific conditions applicable to the <b>school.</b> KEYWORDS: Secondary <b>vocational</b> <b>schools,</b> <b>vocational</b> <b>schools,</b> reducing the number of [...] ...|$|R

40|$|The authors {{conducted}} a comparative {{analysis of the}} earnings of workers in Israel who had last attended <b>vocational</b> <b>schools</b> {{and those who had}} last attended academic secondary schools before entering the labor force. Their findings suggest that Israel may provide an example of an educational system in which <b>vocational</b> <b>schooling</b> is economically effective. <b>Vocational</b> <b>schooling</b> in Israel has proven more cost-effective than general academic training. In particular, <b>vocational</b> <b>school</b> attenders who later worked in occupations related to their course of study earned more. Their wages were up to 10 percent more a month than their peers who studied at academic secondary schools and those who attended <b>vocational</b> <b>schools</b> but found employment in other occupations not related to their field of study. These results reinforce similar findings in recent research on <b>vocational</b> <b>schooling</b> in the United States. A caveat is necessary to temper the generally positive findings concerning <b>vocational</b> <b>schooling</b> in Israel. While <b>vocational</b> <b>schooling</b> is cost-effective compared with other forms of secondary schooling, it does not compare favorably with other forms of training for skilled trades, such as apprenticeships and factory-based <b>vocational</b> <b>schools.</b> Another factor is the national consensus in Israel favoring education designed to equip young people for the social and cultural role of integrating the country's heterogenous, largely immigrant population.
