5|$|On March 28, 1941, Seaborg, {{physicist}} Emilio Segrè and Kennedy {{were able}} to demonstrate not only the presence of plutonium, but that was fissile, <b>an</b> <b>important</b> <b>distinction</b> that was crucial to the decisions made in directing Manhattan Project research. Arthur Wahl then began exploring the chemistry of the newly discovered element. In 1966, Room 307 of Gilman Hall on the campus at the Berkeley, where they did this work, was declared a U.S. National Historic Landmark.|$|E

25|$|The trait EI {{model is}} general and subsumes the Goleman model {{discussed}} above. The conceptualization of EI as a personality trait {{leads to a}} construct that lies outside the taxonomy of human cognitive ability. This is <b>an</b> <b>important</b> <b>distinction</b> {{in as much as}} it bears directly on the operationalization of the construct and the theories and hypotheses that are formulated about it.|$|E
25|$|There {{are several}} types of {{caesarean}} section (CS). <b>An</b> <b>important</b> <b>distinction</b> lies {{in the type of}} incision (longitudinal or transverse) made on the uterus, apart from the incision on the skin: the vast majority of skin incisions are a transverse suprapubic approach known as a Pfannenstiel incision but {{there is no way of}} knowing from the skin scar which way the uterine incision was conducted.|$|E
25|$|Elderly care {{emphasizes}} {{the social and}} personal requirements of senior citizens who need some assistance with daily activities and health care, but who desire to age with dignity. It is <b>an</b> <b>important</b> <b>distinction,</b> in that the design of housing, services, activities, employee training and such should be truly customer-centered. It is also noteworthy that {{a large amount of}} global elderly care falls under the unpaid market sector.|$|E
5000|$|Number of {{football}} scholarships: FBS schools are allowed 85 players receiving athletic aid, while FCS schools are allowed 63 scholarships. The wording is <b>a</b> very <b>important</b> <b>distinction</b> for another reason.|$|R

50|$|There is <b>a</b> {{particularly}} <b>important</b> <b>distinction</b> to be {{made between}} legacies and inheritances. This <b>distinction</b> plays <b>an</b> <b>important</b> role in the final distribution of an estate. The estate of a deceased person is distributed by the executor by first paying the debts, then handing over the legacies and prelegacies, and finally giving the balance to the heir or heirs.|$|R
25|$|Queen Elisabeth promised Helene {{a reward}} {{in return for}} her actions in obtaining the Holy Crown of Saint Stephen. At this time, only {{the owner of the}} royal {{insignia}} was considered legitimate king of Hungary. This was <b>an</b> <b>important</b> <b>distinction</b> since the Hungarian nobles voted for the coronation of the 16-year-old king of Poland. With his help they hoped to defend themselves better against the Turks' attacks against the Hungarian kingdom.|$|E
25|$|Defining Features are {{features}} that, {{in addition}} to being found in battle descriptions and on historic maps, can be visually located on the modern landscape or under the landscape’s surface (archeological remains). This is <b>an</b> <b>important</b> <b>distinction</b> as Defining Features must be topographically defensible. Any feature whose existence can be verified through physical evidence can be mapped as a Defining Feature. Features that no longer exist above or below the surface and therefore have no physical trace are still considered battle features but are not mapped as Defining Features.|$|E
25|$|<b>An</b> <b>important</b> <b>distinction</b> here is {{that between}} the two decisions; {{lysogeny}} and lysis on infection, and continuing lysogeny or lysis from a prophage. The latter is determined solely by the activation of RecA in the SOS response of the cell, as detailed in the section on induction. The former will also be affected by this; a cell undergoing an SOS response will always be lysed, as no cI protein {{will be allowed to}} build up. However, the initial lytic/lysogenic decision on infection is also dependent on the cII and cIII proteins.|$|E

25|$|The Meditator {{finds it}} almost {{impossible}} to keep his habitual opinions and assumptions out of his head, try as he might. He resolves to pretend that these opinions are totally false and imaginary in order to counterbalance his habitual way of thinking. The Meditator wishes to avoid an excess of skepticism and instead uses a skeptical method, <b>an</b> <b>important</b> <b>distinction.</b> He supposes that not God, but some evil demon has committed itself to deceiving him so that everything he thinks he knows is false. By doubting everything, he can at least be sure not to be misled into falsehood by this demon.|$|E
25|$|Some {{opponents of}} ABC contend that since only few models—subjectively chosen and {{probably}} all wrong—can be realistically considered, ABC analyses provide only limited insight. However, there is <b>an</b> <b>important</b> <b>distinction</b> between identifying a plausible null hypothesis and assessing the relative fit of alternative hypotheses. Since useful null hypotheses, that potentially hold true, can extremely seldom be put {{forward in the}} context of complex models, predictive ability of statistical models as explanations of complex phenomena is far more important than the test of a statistical null hypothesis in this context. It is also common to average over the investigated models, weighted based on their relative plausibility, to infer model features (e.g., parameter values) and to make predictions.|$|E
25|$|<b>An</b> <b>important</b> <b>distinction</b> {{between the}} {{southern}} Canadian seal hunt and the Inuit Canadian hunt is that Canadian Inuit typically hunt ringed seals, while the southern Canadian hunt targets the pelt of the harp seal. Greenlandic Inuit hunt and eat both ringed and harp seals. Unfortunately, protests surrounding the southern seal hunt in Canada have historically damaged the financial well-being of both Canadian and Greenlandic Inuit {{more than it}} has the hunting of harp seals. Because of the strongly emotional nature of the protest, profits surrounding the Inuit hunting of ringed seal fall with any ban on any type of seal product, regardless of exemption. For example, in 1963, prices for high-quality pelts of ringed seals could reach above $20.00 each; these same pelts in 1967, {{the year of the}} first major protests, would only sell for $2.50 each, which threatened the survival of Inuit in many areas. Several protests in other years have resulted in similar decreases in price.|$|E

Sullivan’s argument {{that if the}} Supreme Court were to strike down the individual mandate in the healthcare legislation, all tax incentives would suddenly be at risk. Jensen argues that there is <b>a</b> legally <b>important</b> <b>distinction</b> between mandates and incentives; that economic equivalence {{does not necessarily mean}} legal equivalence; and that the constitutional merits of tax incentives should continue to be determined in the time-honored way – on a case-by-case basis...|$|R

The theoretical plate in conventional distillation trays has no [...] "height". It is simply a hypothetical equilibrium stage. However, the theoretical plate in packed beds, chromatography and other applications is defined as having a height.|$|R
50|$|There {{is almost}} {{universal}} agreement that this text was later expanded by numerous other authors, following {{a question and}} answer pattern established in the early books. The version extant today is very long, and has signs of inconsistent authorship in the later volumes. There is no agreed-upon point at which Nagasena's authorship {{may be said to}} end (and the work of other hands begins), nor has this been perceived as <b>an</b> inherently <b>important</b> <b>distinction</b> by monastic scholars.|$|R
25|$|Soloveitchik's four step {{scholarly}} {{approach to}} learning has influenced many of his students. The approach {{can be traced back}} to the approach of the Gaon of Vilna. The first step is concentrating on the text. This follows the Vilna Gaon's approach of carefully amending the texts of both exoteric (the Talmud) and esoteric works (for instance, the Torat Kohanim, Tosefta, Avot de-Rabbi Natan, etc.). The second step is knowing the physical reality of the objects described. Third is the conceptual analysis proffered by Rishonim. At this point he introduces <b>an</b> <b>important</b> <b>distinction</b> between Rishonim, which are primary sources, and must be mastered, even if one has to struggle to understand them; and Achronim, which are secondary sources, which can be exploited (if you find good material, use it, but if you don't understand it, don't spend too much time on it). The fourth and final step is sevarah, creating the intellectual framework underpinning the Torah.|$|E
25|$|To {{estimate}} insect age, forensic entomologists {{must determine}} {{the amount of}} time a particular insect spends in each stage of development and apply this information to temperature data at a crime scene to determine a post-mortem interval estimation. Timing of various insect stages is determined in a laboratory at standardized temperatures so that ranges may be applied to the different temperature conditions encountered in the field. Post-mortem intervals are estimated by determining the accumulated degree days (ADD) or accumulated degree hours (ADH) acquired by each insect stage on the remains; this information is then used to calculate the overall degree days or degree hours accumulated during the insect’s entire life cycle and association with the carcass, representing the minimal amount of time the body has been available for colonization by insects. This estimation does not claim to represent an accurate time of death, but rather a minimal time of colonization. This is <b>an</b> <b>important</b> <b>distinction</b> that must be considered with the use of forensic evidence in courts of law.|$|E
500|$|Covenanters {{believed}} 'God's Church' {{required the}} creation of a Presbyterian world, by force if necessary, zero tolerance for 'impure' views and a 'well-ordered monarchy.' Both Covenanters and Royalists agreed monarchy was an essential part of God's Church and society but differed in the interpretation of 'well-ordered.' This was not the case in England and was <b>an</b> <b>important</b> <b>distinction</b> between the English and Scots that resurfaced in 1689.|$|E
50|$|Its founder, El Hadj Umar Tall an Islamic {{reformer}} {{originating from}} the Fuuta Tooro {{on the banks}} of the Senegal River, died fighting against rebels shortly after his forces defeated the Maasina Emirate. After El Hadj Umar's death, the emirate was divided into three states, each ruled by one of his sons. These three states had their capitals respectively in the towns of Nioro, Segou and Bandiagara. <b>A</b> most <b>important</b> <b>distinction</b> was between noblemen (free people) and the non-free (Rimmaibe or Maccube).|$|R
50|$|<b>A</b> second <b>important</b> <b>distinction</b> {{is between}} discrete-valued and continuous-valued. Particularly in digital signal {{processing}} a digital signal is sometimes defined as a sequence of discrete values, {{that may or may}} not be derived from an underlying continuous-valued physical process. In other contexts, digital signals are defined as the continuous-time waveform signals in a digital system, representing a bit-stream. In the first case, a signal that is generated by means of a digital modulation method is considered as converted to an analog signal, while it is considered as a digital signal in the second case.|$|R
50|$|The divide {{was also}} once <b>an</b> <b>important</b> class <b>distinction,</b> with Uphill more {{affluent}} and Downhill less so. This distinction {{dates from the}} time of the Norman conquest, when the religious and military elite occupied the hilltop. The construction and expansion of suburbs in both parts of the city since the mid-19th century has diluted this distinction. Nevertheless, Uphill residential property continues to fetch a premium, and is almost invariably referred to as such by local estate agents.|$|R
500|$|The St. Petersburg Times {{called the}} book an {{in-depth}} analysis of American anxiety over restricting sexual feelings of children. The Hollywood Reporter noted that Heins made <b>an</b> <b>important</b> <b>distinction</b> in arguing that taboo topics {{should be taught}} to children by their parents, and {{it should not be}} the role of government to censor what material individuals are allowed to view (or speak). The Atlanta Journal-Constitution recommended Heins' study for summer nonfiction reading in its [...] "Family Matters" [...] section.|$|E
500|$|The maximum {{sustained}} wind normally {{occurs at}} a distance from the center known as the radius of maximum wind, within a mature tropical cyclone's eyewall, before winds decrease at farther distances away from a tropical cyclone's center. [...] Most weather agencies use the definition for sustained winds recommended by the World Meteorological Organization (WMO), which specifies measuring winds at a height of [...] for 10minutes, and then taking the average. However, the United States National Weather Service defines sustained winds within tropical cyclones by averaging winds over a period of one minute, measured at the same [...] height. [...] This is <b>an</b> <b>important</b> <b>distinction,</b> as the value of the highest one-minute sustained wind is about 14% greater than a ten-minute sustained wind over the same period.|$|E
500|$|In February 1941, Seaborg and his {{collaborators}} produced plutonium-239 through the bombardment of uranium. In their experiments bombarding uranium with deuterons, they observed the creation of neptunium, element 93. But it then underwent beta-decay, forming a new element, plutonium, with 94 protons. Plutonium is fairly stable, but undergoes alpha-decay, which explained the presence of alpha particles coming from neptunium. [...] Thus, on March 28, 1941, Seaborg, physicist Emilio Segrè and Berkeley chemist Joseph W. Kennedy were {{able to show that}} plutonium (then known only as element 94) was fissile, <b>an</b> <b>important</b> <b>distinction</b> that was crucial to the decisions made in directing Manhattan Project research.

The different separations between fast and slow time scales (so that each burst in Figure 3 includes several thousand spikes while those in Figure 8 include only a few dozen) is a consequence of the different values of ε in the different models. <b>A</b> more <b>important</b> <b>distinction</b> is the two different classes of bursting represented: sub-Hopf/fold cycle bursting in Figure 3, and circle/fold cycle bursting in Figure 8.|$|R
30|$|<b>A</b> second <b>important</b> <b>distinction</b> is that {{surveillance}} needs, potential benefits, {{and general}} utility vary by country, region, and locality. For example, many {{state and local}} health agencies in the U.S. already have access to high-resolution, near real-time data for infectious diseases. In this case, local utility may be limited to understanding behavioral responses. These data are also useful, however, for validating these systems more generally. In regions where less data is available, the utility of models may be high but comprehensive evaluation may not be possible. Finally, both Internet and website (or app) penetration vary by geographic region.|$|R
