[...] Interferometric characters {{is a term}} coined in 2002 to link interefometric signals to <b>alphanumerical</b> <b>characters</b> (see figure's legend). These experiments have also provided the first observation of diffraction patterns superimposed over propagating interference signals, thus demonstrating non-destructive (or soft) interception of propagating interferograms.|$|R

We are now applying elements of MAYA-II for biodetection through {{the construction of}} SNAPS (smart nucleic acid pattern sensors).

[...] The rationale is that software sufficiently sophisticated to read and reproduce the distorted image accurately does not exist (or is not available to the average user), so any system able to do so {{is likely to be a}} human.|$|R
40|$|Being an {{essential}} part of individual’s life and organization’s normal functioning, communication plays an integral part of development. Without communication growth of a person is hampered. But everyone is not gifted with the ability to hear and speak. They use sign language to communicate. It is difficult for {{most of the people who}} are not familiar with this sign language to communicate without an interpreter. Thus, a system that transcribes symbols in sign languages into plain text can help with real-time communication. Talking gloves is an human interface device which converts mechanism of hand sign language into <b>alphanumerical</b> <b>characters.</b> It is a product in concurrence with assistive engineering to help dumb people of society and improve communication capabilities...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} EdgeVib, {{a system}} of spatiotemporal vibration patterns for delivering alphanumeric characters on wrist-worn vibrotactile displays. We first investigated spatiotemporal pattern delivery through a watch-back tactile display by performing a series of user studies. The results reveal that employing a 2 × 2 vibrotactile array {{is more effective than}} employing a 3 × 3 one, because the lower-resolution array creates clearer tactile sensations in less time consumption. We then deployed EdgeWrite patterns on a 2 × 2 vibrotactile array to determine any difficulties of delivering <b>alphanumerical</b> <b>characters,</b> and then modified the unistroke patterns into multistroke EdgeVib ones {{on the basis of the}} findings. The results of a 24 -participant user study reveal that the recognition rates of the modified multistroke patterns were significantly higher than the original unistroke ones in both alphabet (85. 9 % vs. 70. 7 %) and digits (88. 6 % vs. 78. 5 %) delivery, and a further study indicated that the techniques can be generalized to deliver two-character compound messages with recognition rates higher than 83. 3 %. The guidelines derived from our study can be used for designing watch-back tactile displays for alphanumeric character output...|$|R
40|$|Today, a {{clear and}} {{efficient}} communication requires a large use of graphical and pictorial signs, which are used {{in place of a}} text. In fact, the use of the text in the communication leads to comprehension problems to the reader in several daily situations. An example could be the case of the road signs. The road signs represent an application of technical communication with the aim of transmitting some contents by means of a system of signs, graphical symbols, and <b>alphanumerical</b> <b>characters.</b> The problem considered in this study is linked to the textual messages, generally placed below the road signs, which are written in a specific language. Adding texts to the road signs can lead to the reduction of their comprehension, especially for foreign drivers and/or pedestrians, and could require a time for reading them, which is incompatible with the traffic requirements. In the current situation, where we are having an increase of business and leisure trips, and with a more and more multiethnic society, the urgency of this issue has become more important. All these cases often present language issues. This article, therefore, aims at proposing a general method useful to "translate" the texts written below the road signs into graphical forms. The starting point of this idea is that the graphical language can be a universal communication form, able to overcome the language and the cultural differences...|$|R
40|$|The {{generic name}} for {{collection}} of tools {{designed to protect}} data and thwart hackers is Computer Security. The major change that affected security was the introduction of distributed systems {{and the use of}} networks and communication facilities for carrying data between terminal user and computer and computer and computer. Network security measures are needed to protect data transmission. Suppose that we had a way of masking the contents of messages or other information traffic so that an attacker, even if he or she captured the message, would be unable to extract the information from the message. The common technique for doing masking is encryption. The encryption is done by using Symmetric key or public key Algorithms. The most commonly used public key algorithms are 1. Rivest Shamir Adelman(RSA) and 2 Elliptic Curve cryptography In this paper two different mapping methods of the alphanumeric characters on to the x-y co ordinate of the Elliptic curve defined over a finite field Zp is proposed. The methods are 1) Static (One-to-One) Mapping Method and 2) Dynamic (One-to-N) Mapping Method. Dynamic mapping method will increase the strength of the Elliptic Cryptosystem. The Results have been attached. The hardness of the elliptic curve discrete logarithm problem (ECDLP) is crucial for the security of elliptic curve cryptographic schemes. This report describes the state-of-the-art in mapping the <b>alphanumerical</b> <b>characters</b> on to the x-y coordinates of the elliptic curve points...|$|R
40|$|Code {{injections}} {{attacks are}} one of the most powerful and important classes of attacks on software. In such attacks, the attacker sends malicious input to a software application, where it is stored in memory. The malicious input is chosen in such a way that its representation in memory is also a valid representation of a machine code program that performs actions chosen by the attacker. The attacker then triggers a bug in the application to divert the control flow to this injected machine code. A typical action of the injected code is to launch a command interpreter shell, and hence the malicious input is often called shellcode. Attacks are usually performed against network facing applications, and such applications often perform validations or encodings on input. Hence, a typical hurdle for attackers, is that the shellcode has to pass one or more filtering methods before it is stored in the vulnerable application's memory space. Clearly, for a code injection attack to succeed, the malicious input must survive such validations and transformations. Alphanumeric input (consisting only of letters and digits) is typically very robust for this purpose: it passes most filters and is untouched by most transformations. This paper studies the power of alphanumeric shellcode on the ARM 32 bit RISC processor. It shows that the subset of ARM machine code programs that (when interpreted as data) consist only of <b>alphanumerical</b> <b>characters</b> is a Turing complete subset. This is a non-trivial result, as the number of instructions that consist only of alphanumeric characters is very limited. To craft useful exploit code (and to achieve Turing completeness), several tricks are needed, including the use of self-modifying code. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|A new {{generation}} of barcodes was devised within the 2005 ’s, sometimes said as 2 nd or matrix codes. There are shaped by patterns {{of black and white}} organized on a (usually) square grid and might inscribe thousands of <b>alphanumerical</b> and different <b>characters</b> in nearly any language.
