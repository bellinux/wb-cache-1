40|$|AbstractHot {{stamping}} is a non-isothermal {{high temperature}} forming process, in which complex ultra high strength parts are produced, {{with the goal}} of no springback. Boron <b>alloyed</b> <b>steels,</b> especially 22 MnB 5, have been the point of focus for the materials choice in hot stamping. In this paper four high strength non-boron <b>alloyed</b> <b>steels</b> as well as five boron <b>alloyed</b> <b>steels</b> were hot stamped using water and nitrogen cooling media. Microstructural analyses as well as tensile tests of hot stamped samples were performed. Boron <b>alloyed</b> <b>steels</b> obtained fully martensitic or bainitic microstructure while microstructure of non-boron <b>alloyed</b> <b>steels</b> was consisted of some ferrite phase in addition to martensite and bainite phases. The results showed that boron <b>alloyed</b> <b>steels</b> attained yield and tensile strength values of about 650 - 1370 MPa and 850 - 2000 MPa, respectively, while those related to non-boron <b>alloyed</b> <b>steels</b> were, in order, about 600 - 1100 MPa and 900 - 1400 MPa. © 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|Mechanical {{properties}} of low <b>alloyed</b> <b>steels</b> are directly determined by their microstructures. Thanks to versatility in their microstructures, the mechanical {{properties of}} low <b>alloyed</b> <b>steels</b> {{are much more}} adjustable than other materials. In the industry, {{one of the most}} effective ways to obtain the microstructure for the targeted mechanical properties is via the transformation of the iron lattice from a face centered cubic (FCC) to body centered cubic (BCC). During the lattice transformation, there is also redistribution of carbon or other alloying elements between these two iron lattices. In order to precisely tune the mechanical properties of low <b>alloyed</b> <b>steels,</b> it is required to deeply understand the mechanism of the FCC to BCC transformation. This thesis aims to shed new light on local redistribution of alloying elements at the moving interface during the FCC to BCC lattice transformation (including both the austenite to ferrite and austenite to bainite transformations in low <b>alloyed</b> <b>steels),</b> and thus improve the mechanism of these two typical phase transformations in steels. For this purpose, novel experimental approaches (the cyclic partial phase transformation approach and the interrupted cooling approach) are designed to reveal the redistribution character of alloying elements and its effect on the phase transformation kinetics. The new experimental results allow a clear discrimination between the correctness of the existing models for both the austenite to ferrite and bainite transformations. New models are also proposed to successfully predict the special features observed in the newly designed experiments.

50|$|World War One {{submarines}} {{had their}} hulls built of carbon steel, and usually had test depths {{of no more}} than 100 metres (328 feet). During World War Two, high-strength <b>alloyed</b> <b>steel</b> was introduced, allowing for depths up to 200 metres (656 feet), post-war calculations have suggested crush depths exceeding 300m for late-war German Type VII U-boats. High-strength <b>alloyed</b> <b>steel</b> is still the main material for submarines today, with 250-350 metres (820 to 1,148 feet) depth limit, which cannot be exceeded on a military submarine without sacrificing other characteristics. To exceed that limit, a few submarines were built with titanium hulls. Titanium has a better strength to weight ratio and durability than most steels, and is non-magnetic. Titanium submarines were especially favoured by the Soviets, as they had developed specialized high-strength alloys, built an industry for producing titanium with affordable costs, and have several types of titanium submarines. Titanium alloys allow a major increase in depth, but other systems need to be redesigned as well, so test depth was limited to 1000 metres (3,281 feet) for the Soviet submarine Komsomolets, the deepest-diving military submarine. An Alfa-class submarine may have successfully operated at 1300 metres (4,265 feet), though continuous operation at such depths would be an excessive stress for many submarine systems. Despite its benefits, the high costs of titanium submarine construction led to its abandonment as the Cold War ended.|$|E

5000|$|WWI {{submarines}} had hulls {{of carbon}} steel, with a 100 m maximum depth. During WWII, high-strength <b>alloyed</b> <b>steel</b> was introduced, allowing 200 m depths. High-strength alloy steel remains the primary material for submarines today, with 250 - 400 m depths, which cannot be exceeded {{on a military}} submarine without design compromises. To exceed that limit, a few submarines were built with titanium hulls. Titanium can be stronger than steel, lighter, and is not ferromagnetic, important for stealth. Titanium submarines were built by the Soviet Union, which developed specialized high-strength alloys. It has produced several types of titanium submarines. Titanium alloys allow a major increase in depth, but other systems must be redesigned to cope, so test depth was limited to 1000 m for the , the deepest-diving combat submarine. An [...] may have successfully operated at 1300 m, though continuous operation at such depths would produce excessive stress on many submarine systems. Titanium does not flex as readily as steel, and may become brittle during many dive cycles.

40|$|Being {{the single}} {{component}} transferring load and traction from {{the vehicle to}} the rail, the selection of materials and structural properties of railway wheels are critical. Carbon steel with a pearlitic microstructure is {{the most commonly used}} material due to its high strength, low cost and good wear properties. However, due to the two‐phase microstructure, pearlite is susceptible to softening at higher temperatures and degradation of mechanical properties. A new type of wheel steels with increased alloying content of silicon and manganese has shown improved resistance to rolling contact fatigue. However, a clear correlation between increased alloying content and strength and how the softening behaviour of the material affects the fatigue properties have not been studied so far. To foster further knowledge on these issues, two wheel steels were used in this work: a high Si‐Mn <b>alloyed</b> <b>steel</b> and a widely used lower <b>alloyed</b> <b>steel.</b> In virgin states the two selected steels were found to have fairly similar mechanical characteristics {{in a wide range of}} temperatures and different strain rates. Upon annealing, however, both materials begin to soften at temperatures above 500 °C. Higher temperatures approaching the ferrite‐austenite transformation temperature (about 750 °C) accelerates the microstructural degeneration. However the high Si‐Mn‐alloyed steel showed to have a better resistance against thermal softening, resulting in better mechanical properties and increased fatigue life compared to the low <b>alloyed</b> <b>steel.</b> Investigation of the microstructure revealed that the softening was caused by spheroidisation of cemenite lamellas in pearlite. Heavy pre‐deformation before annealing emphasised this degeneration of pearlite even more. Both silicon and manganese are considered to retard the softening towards higher annealing times and temperatures, by a decrease in carbon flux, which thereby limit the spheroidisation rate. The cementite spheroidisation leads to lowering of hardness, monotonic and cyclic strength and fatigue life times. As the high <b>alloyed</b> <b>steel</b> resists microstructural degeneration better at elevated temperatures it retains the mechanical properties better after high temperature exposure. This is particularly evident for the fatigue performance. As an example it can be mentioned that a certain high temperature exposure leads to hardness decrease of about 20 % for the high <b>alloyed</b> <b>steel,</b> while the low <b>alloyed</b> <b>steel</b> suffers a hardness reduction of about 25 %. For fatigue life times, however, the difference between the two materials is as much as a factor three in favour for the higher <b>alloyed</b> <b>steel...</b>|$|E

Reducing the Wüstite scale in Ar + H 2 gas mixture forms a dense and uniform iron layer {{on top of}} the remaining Wüstite scale, which separates the unreduced scale from the gas mixture. The reduction of Wüstite is controlled by the bulk diffusion of dissolved oxygen in the formed iron layer and follows parabolic growth rate law. The reduction kinetics of Wüstite formed on pure iron and on Mn <b>alloyed</b> <b>steel</b> are the same. The parabolic rate constant of Wüstite reduction obeys an Arrhenius relation with an activation energy of 104 kJ/mol if the formed iron layer is in the ferrite phase. However, at 1223 K (950 °C) the parabolic rate constant of Wüstite reduction drops due to the phase transformation of the iron layer from ferrite to austenite. The effect of oxygen partial pressure on the parabolic rate constant of Wüstite reduction is negligible when reducing in a gas mixture with a dew point below 283 K (10 °C).
