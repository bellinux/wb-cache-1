5000|$|A large {{increase}} in firebox area (from 66 sq ft on the H-10 to 100 sq ft on the A-1), characteristic of his work, necessitated adding another axle to the trailing truck, thus creating the 2-8-4 wheel arrangement. Built {{in the spring}} of 1925, the first Berkshire (a demonstrator owned by Lima) was dubbed the A-1. In addition to supporting the very large firebox and grate, the four-wheeled trailing truck carried the <b>ash</b> <b>pan.</b> For this purpose, the truck was redesigned as an articulated extension of the locomotive frame. The result was an <b>ash</b> <b>pan</b> which could hold more ash, allowing the locomotive to travel farther between cleanings. (For roads which burned coal, this was a significant innovation. But it was not without tradeoffs. The articulated frame reduced weight on the driving wheels, which did not aid tractive effort (pulling ability). The locomotives so configured also had more difficulty staying on the rails in reverse, particularly through yard trackwork like switch frogs.) ...|$|R

50|$|A multi-fuel stove is {{very similar}} to a {{wood-burning}} stove in appearance and design. Multifuel refers to the capability of the stove to burn wood and also coal, wood pellets, or peat.

40|$|This review {{summarizes}} recent {{progress in}} water-transporting mechanisms across cell membranes. Modern biophysical concepts of water transport and new measurement strategies are evaluated. A family of water-transporting proteins (<b>water</b> <b>channels,</b> aquaporins) has been identified, consisting of small hydrophobic proteins expressed widely in epithelial and nonepithelial tissues. The functional properties, genetics, and cellular distributions of these proteins are summarized. The majority of molecular-level information about water-transporting mechanisms comes from studies on CHIP 28, a 28 -kDa glycoprotein that forms tetramers in membranes; each monomer contains six putative helical domains surrounding a central aqueous pathway and functions independently as a water-selective channel. Only mutations in the vasopressin-sensitive <b>water</b> <b>channel</b> {{have been shown}} to cause human disease (non-X-linked congenital nephrogenic diabetes insipidus); the physiological significance of other <b>water</b> <b>channels</b> remains unproven. One mercurial-insensitive <b>water</b> <b>channel</b> has been identified, which has the unique feature of multiple overlapping transcriptional units. Systems for expression of <b>water</b> <b>channel</b> proteins are described, including Xenopus oocytes, mammalian and insect cells, and bacteria. Further work should be directed at elucidation of the role of <b>water</b> <b>channels</b> in normal physiology and disease, molecular analysis of regulatory mechanisms, and <b>water</b> <b>channel</b> structure determination at atomic resolution...|$|R
50|$|There {{were three}} {{separate}} grates and <b>ash</b> <b>pans,</b> {{one on each}} side outside the frames and a third between, giving an aggregate area of 42 sq ft. The trailing drivers were given a side play of 0.5 in, the coupling rods being fitted with ball and socket joints. As the cranks of the three cylinders were set at 120 degrees in relation to each other, perfect balancing of the reciprocating parts was secured. In order to minimise the drivers slipping, compressed air sanders were fitted.|$|R
50|$|The safe {{operation}} of a wood-burning stove requires regular maintenance such as emptying <b>ash</b> <b>pans</b> (containers) beneath the wood grate. Routine cleaning of the stove pipes and chimney is also needed to prevent chimney fires. Creosote and soot gradually build up in stovepipes and chimneys. This could damage the chimney and spread fire to the surrounding structure, especially the roof. When soot blocks the airflow through the stove pipes or chimney, smoke can build up in the stove pipes and in the house through the stove.|$|R

40|$|The Montauk {{peninsula}} {{is considered}} to be a recessional moraine extending from Amagansat to Montauk Point (Sirkin, 1982). The peninsula is intersected by a series of glacial melt <b>water</b> <b>channels</b> that have completely sealed off along the Atlantic coast and partially along the Gardiner’s Bay coastline. These former melt <b>water</b> <b>channels</b> are marked by areas of low relief and linear coastal dunes on both the north and south coasts of the Montauk Peninsula (Black and Welch 1997). Although these former melt <b>water</b> <b>channels</b> have identical geological origins, they differ significantly in their present morphology. Location and Site Description Figure 1, shows the location of the melt <b>water</b> <b>channels</b> on the Montauk Peninsula. The westernmost melt <b>water</b> <b>channel,</b> immediately to the east of Napeague Harbor is the site of a migrating dune system. Two additional melt <b>water</b> <b>channels</b> are present further to the east, these, however, show no evidence of a migrating dune and are characterized by linear coastal dunes fronting on both Gardiner’s bay and the Atlantic Ocean. Melt <b>water</b> <b>channels</b> are also present in the vicinity of Fort Pond and Lake Montauk. Fig. 1 The Migrating Dune System at Napeague is characterized by three bilobate, parabolic dunes, migrating in a southeasterly direction under the influence of the prevailing winds from the northwest. The specific geomorphology of this area has been discussed by Black (1993, 1997). The dune system at Fort Pond has been, for the most part obliterated by development in the immediate area, while the former melt <b>water</b> <b>channel</b> immediately to the east of Lake Montauk has an identical geologic setting as that at Napeague, yet consists only of linear dunes. Discussion In order to explain the presence of a migrating dune system at Napeague, and the absence of such systems elsewhere along the Montauk Peninsula, it is necessary to consider the land forms to the north of th...|$|R

40|$|A {{finite element}} {{analysis}} (FEA) model has been constructed to predict the thermo-fluidic and optical properties of a microstructure optical fiber (MOF) accounting for changes in external temperature, input water velocity and optical fiber geometry.

There is a critical channel radius below which the steady-state temperature of the <b>water</b> <b>channel</b> is constant, while above, the temperature decreases. However, the distance required to reach steady state within the <b>water</b> <b>channel</b> is dependent on both the input velocity and the channel radius. The MOF has been found capable of supporting multiple modes. Despite the large thermo-optic coefficient of water, the bound modes’ response to temperature was dominated by the thermo-optic coefficient of glass.
