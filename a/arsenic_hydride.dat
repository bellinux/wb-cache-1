5000|$|Sanger is {{best known}} for his work on arsenic {{poisoning}} of people exposed to arsenic-containing wallpaper, carpets and other house furnishings. Using his improved analytical methods, he showed that arsenic levels found in human tissues and excreta were directly correlated with exposure to arsenic-containing materials. The transfer of arsenic from arsenic to wallpaper to human beings was a further mystery. While removal of the wallpaper resulted in disappearance of toxic symptoms, painting over the wallpaper did not.The source of toxicity was arsine (<b>arsenic</b> <b>hydride),</b> an extremely toxic gas formed on reduction of the nonvolatile arsenates present in wallpaper. He thus confirmed the discovery by the Italian chemist Gosio that mold growing on an arsenic-containing substrate generated an arsenical gas the arsenine-forming fungus could live even on the painted surface, its cells reaching into the underlying wallpaper.“In attacking the subject he determined, with characteristic love, of truth, to place it on a secure experimental foundation by looking for arsenic in the excreta of people suffering from the disorders commonly attributed to poison from wallpapers.” ...|$|E

Using glass bottle steamed boiled with 5 % HCl at 98 ℃ for 2 h, 5 -valence arsenic in the extraction solution was reduced to 3 -valence arsenic by Thiourea-Ascorbic Acid and produced the gas of <b>arsenic</b> <b>hydride</b> after reaction with Potassium borohydrid. The gas of <b>arsenic</b> <b>hydride</b> was loaded into the fluorescence spectrophotometer. The standard solutions with different arsenic concentrations were made and standard curve was set up by atomic fluorescence spectrophotometer. Finally, the concentration of arsenic in the samples was determined. The results showed that the linear range of this method was 0 - 20 ug L- 1 and the correlation coefficient was 0. 992. The concentration of arsenic in both two groups glass bottles were lower than the limit of mational standard (0. 2 mg L- 1). It suggests that the method of atomic fluorescence is rapid and high sensitive with good accuracy and it is better than the traditional chemical methods.

40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{bachelor}} thesis was {{to determine}} the toxicologically important arsenic species in beverages (beer, wine and apple juice) with minimal sample preparation. Determination of arsenic species was performed by selective <b>hydride</b> generation of <b>arsenic</b> <b>hydrides</b> with cryogenic collection under liquid nitrogen and detection by atomic absorption spectrometry. In all the samples only inorganic arsenic was found, methyl substituted species were below the limit of detection. The method is suitable for speciation analysis of arsenic in beverages. Detection limits are low enough, the determination is not influenced by the sample matrix. The results were also in good agreement with the determination of total arsenic after mineralization by ICP-MS. Since there is no specified maximum arsenic content in beverages, measured concentrations were compared with the limit for drinking water (10 μg l− 1). All samples were under this limit, except for one sample of apple juice, which arsenic content was about twice higher.

We present an analytical procedure for determining inorganic arsenic (As) species in hot chilli pepper and tomato fruits at the red-ripe stage using microwave assisted digestion (MAD) followed by flow injection-hydride generation {{atomic absorption spectrometry}} (FI-HGAAS). The optimum conditions for the acid digestion method and <b>arsenic</b> <b>hydride</b> (AsH 3) determination were studied in detail. The plant sample (0. 5 g) was digested with 5 ml of concentrated nitric acid by MAD programmed at 900 W for 35 min.

In the case of the supplemental tablet we tested only with one tablet in each container. Replicates were setup so as to check evolution of gas overtime. The first trial produced no results (no arsine evolution detected) this was accredited to the concentration of arsenic being too high.

Arsenite co-elutes with arsenobetaine. The mobile phase used was 5 mmol l- 1 NH 4 H 2 PO 4 solution (pH 5. 8) at the flow rate of 1 ml min- 1. Arsenic {{species in the}} fractions that eluted from the columns were determined by hydride generation atomic absorption spectrometry (AAS). A thermal decomposition procedure was introduced to convert the organoarsenicals, such as arsenobetaine and arsenocholine, into As(V), which can be reduced by sodium tetrahydroborate to form <b>arsenic</b> <b>hydride,</b> and then trapped on a palladium-coated graphite tube, followed by AAS detection. Arsenobetaine which co-elutes with As(III) can be determined by substracting the amount of As(III) determined from {{the total amount of}} As(III) plus arsenobetaine after thermal decomposition. Detection limits (3 sigma signal-to-noise) were 1. 6 ng ml- 1 for As(III), As(V), MMA and p-APA and 1. 9 ng ml- 1 for DMA, AB and AC for a 0. 1 ml injection.

5|$|Three {{neptunium}} arsenide compounds {{have been}} prepared, NpAs, NpAs2, and Np3As4. The first two were first created by heating <b>arsenic</b> and neptunium <b>hydride</b> in a vacuum-sealed tube {{for about a}} week. Later, NpAs was also made by confining neptunium metal and arsenic in a vacuum tube, separating them with a quartz membrane, and heating them to just below neptunium's melting point of 639°C, which is slightly higher than the arsenic's sublimation point of 615°C. Np3As4 is prepared by a similar procedure using iodine as a transporting agent. NpAs2 crystals are brownish gold and Np3As4 is black. The neptunium antimonide compound NpSb was created in 1971 by placing equal quantities of both elements in a vacuum tube, heating them to the melting point of antimony, and then heating it further to 1000°C for sixteen days. This procedure also created trace amounts of an additional antimonide compound Np3Sb4. One neptunium-bismuth compound, NpBi, has also been reported.|$|R

The lightening of skin colour is done to produce a lighter complexion which is believed to increase attractiveness, social standing and improves one’s potential of being successful. Design and Methods. Fifteen (15) common skin lightening creams found in pharmacies and cosmetic retailers throughout Trinidad and Tobago were evaluated for Mercury by Cold Vapor Atomic Absorption Spectrophotometry (CVAAS) and <b>Arsenic</b> by <b>Hydride</b> Generation Atomic Absorption Spectrophotometry (HGAAS). The results obtained were compared to global standards and previous research. Results. Fourteen (14) of the fifteen samples analysed contained Mercury {{in the range of}} 0. 473 μg/g to 0. 766 μg/g. One sample had a Mercury content of 14, 507. 74 ± 490. 75 μg/g which was over 14, 000 times higher than the USFDA limit for mercury in cosmetics of 1 μg/g. All samples contained Arsenic in the range 1. 016 μg/g to 6. 612 μg/g, which exceeds the EU limit for cosmetics of 0 μg/g. Conclusions. All the samples analysed contained significant amounts of Mercury and Arsenic and none of them can be considered safe for prolonged human use. The samples that contained Mercury levels which were lower than the USFDA limit contained Arsenic levels which exceeded the EU standard of 0 μg/g in cosmetics.

The study aims to explore the hydride generation technique which is normally coupled with efficient thermal source to apply determination of heavy metals in water samples via spectrometric analysis. The <b>arsenic</b> <b>hydride</b> generation process and the atomization of the generated hydride in a quartz cell atomizer were studied analytically as model case studies. The hydride generation (HG) process was analyzed by adopting two hypotheses, the nascent hydrogen and formation of intermediate hydroboron species, where the results based on the second hypothesis are found to be more realistic for design purposes. Moreover, the release of the gener-ated hydride from the liquid phase and their transport to the gas phase is simulated in a helical tubular section, in which the actual tubular section length required for separation is deduced. The analytical results have been verified experi-mentally by measuring the signal intensity for the free arsenic atoms against several reaction tube lengths, in which in-creasing the tubular section length from 12 cm to 100 cm results in signal amelioration by no more than 6. 6 %. Further-more, the atomization of the hydride and the distribution of the generated free atoms are deduced in two configurations of tubular quartz atomizers.

40|$|A simple {{continuous}} flow method is proposed to eliminate copper interference in <b>arsenic</b> speciation by <b>hydride</b> generation, {{based on the}} selective retention of this interfering ion in an iminodiacetate chelating resin previous to the hydride generation process. The arsines generated were cold trapped and measured by ICP/OES. The proposed method allows about 98 % of the copper present in the samples to be removed. Minor co-retention of As(V) was observed {{as a result of}} electrostatic interaction between the arsenate anion and the nitrogen of the iminodiacetate group of the chelating resin Muromac A- 1, the charge distribution of which is modified when copper is chelated. The species As(III), MMA and DMA were not retained in the microcolumn, probably because these species are mainly in the molecular form at the working pH value (4. 5). In synthetic samples containing 50 mu g l(- 1) of each arsenic species together with 100 mg l(- 1) copper, the recoveries obtained were: As(V) 97. 6 %, As(III) 100 %, MMA 99. 8 %, and DMA 99. 9 %.

This newly {{identified}} arsenic species is a key intermediate in the metabolic pathway of arsenic biomethylation, which involves stepwise reduction of pentavalent to trivalent arsenic species followed by oxidative addition of a methyl group. Arsenic speciation was carried out using ion-pair chromatographic separation of <b>arsenic</b> compounds with <b>hydride</b> generation atomic fluorescence spectrometry detection. Speciation of the inorganic arsenite [As(III) ], inorganic arsenate [As(V) ], monomethylarsonic acid [MMA(V) ], dimethylarsinic acid [DMA(V) ], and MMA(III) in a urine sample was complete in 5 min. Urine samples collected from humans before and after a single oral administration of 300 mg sodium 2, 3 -dimercapto- 1 -propane sulfonate (DMPS) were analyzed for arsenic species. MMA(III) was found in 51 out of 123 urine samples collected from 41 people in inner Mongolia 0 – 6 hr after the administration of DMPS. MMA(III) in urine samples did not arise from the reduction of MMA(V) by DMPS. DMPS probably assisted the release of MMA(III) that was formed in the body. Along with the presence of MMA(III), there was an increase in the relative concentration of MMA(V) and a decrease in DMA(V) in the urine samples collected after the DMPS ingestion.

40|$|Methods for the {{determination}} of trace elements in interfering matrices were developed. The methods involve two strategies for the reduction of interferences: the use of new pretreatment methods for use with existing instrumentation, {{and the development of}} new instrumentation. ^ A comparison was made of inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) detection limits and interference reduction for <b>arsenic</b> by <b>hydride</b> generation, flow injection, continuous aspiration, and mixed gas methods. Practical considerations in implementing these common techniques, {{as well as in the}} general use and maintenance of an ELAN 5000 ICP-MS instrument are presented for the benefit of new users. ^ Two approaches for the elimination of interferences in {{the determination}} of arsenic in gold by ICP-MS. The main challenges in this analysis were the arsenic signal suppression by gold and the polyatomic interference due to chloride. A method was developed for the batch mode reductive precipitation removal of interfering gold matrix from the sample prior to hydride generation and detection of arsenic. This method has great potential value as the basis for other simple methods for the removal of transition metals that interfere with hydride generation. An on-line anion exchange method for the removal of interfering gold prior to hydride generation was subsequently developed to improve the speed of analysis. The batch-mode reduction method for the removal of gold resulted in a better detection limit than the anion exchange method. However, the automated anion exchange gold removal method required less bench chemistry, was faster, consumed less reagents, and created less mess than the off-line method. ^ On-line solid phase extraction methods are a valuable and increasingly popular method for the removal of matrix interferences. The automation of sample pretreatment as well as the small sample size required when the technique is combined with flow injection make it ideal for use in the analysis of hazardous materials. The severe signal suppression of uranium on lithium, beryllium, magnesium, and aluminum was overcome by the on-line flow injection-solid phase extraction removal of uranium using a column packed with Tru-Spec resin. The column was regenerated on-line using ammonium oxalate. ^ The development of an internal combustion engine as a novel source for atomic emission spectrometry was begun. This preliminary stage of development focused on the identification of important experimental parameters to be considered in future work. A one cylinder four stroke engine was modified to allow optical access through the cylinder head. Combustion radiation was monitored with a photomultiplier tube and the signal was stored using LabView software. It is hoped that this work will be the basis for the development of an inexpensive, portable, rugged instrument that will accept a variety of fuels. ...|$|R
40|$|Arsenic is a metalloid, met in both reduced (+ 3) and {{oxidised}} (+ 5) states, in {{a variety}} of inorganic and organic compounds. It is naturally and anthropogenically introduced. Globally, anthropogenic loads of arsenic exceed the natural ones. It is highly toxic, especially inorganic arsenic. Its toxicity is due to structural similarities with the essential nutrient phosphate. The phenomenon is natural and known as competitive inhibition. First order speciation between hydride (mostly inorganic) and non-hydride (mostly organic) arsenic took place during this project. An in-house, batch type system of hydride generation, electrothermal atomic absorption spectrometry was used. This study has produced baseline concentrations in aquatic environments (rivers, lakes, mines, coastal, shelf edge, oceanic), mainly from the west coast of Ireland. The measured concentrations fall within normal for seawater (15 - 20 nM) and fresh water (0 - 5 nM). Exceptionally high concentration (~ 50 nM) was observed in the effluent of the Avoca Mines, in Co. Wicklow; low concentrations are restored up and downstream of the mines. Results coupled to phosphate findings, showed biological uptake of arsenic being much slower process than physical mixing of water masses. Mixing of coastal seawater with fresh water of low arsenic resulted in near linear increase in the concentration of <b>hydride</b> <b>arsenic</b> with increasing salinity (rivers Corrib and Shannon plumes). This is reversed at high salinities for a small salinity range, where fronts are formed between mixed coastal and open ocean seawater (Thermal Shelf Edge). It is proposed that enhanced biological activity in the highly active frontal zones removes arsenic from the dissolved phase. In the open ocean the positive distribution is restored to some degree, but overall a wide range of arsenic concentrations characterises different water masses despite the small salinity range. Among water masses, Mediterranean Sea Outflow Water displays great potential of being traced by its distinctive arsenic concentration. Ph. D.

Changes that were made on the system included the replacement of anhydrous calcium chloride with anhydrous calcium sulphate and the replacement of the special sample tube with a modified one made from silica. Re-directing the flow of argon through the top of the Buchner funnel appeared to make the system compatible with aqueous extracts of soil samples. The interferences from 1000 ~g/mL of nickel(II), cobalt(II), iron(III), copper(II) have been eliminated with the aid of 1. 4 M hydrochloric acid and 1 % (weight/volume) L-cystine.

Furthermore, 103 % of arsenic signal was accomplished in the presence of 1000 ~g/mL cadmium with 5 M Hel. tVhen each of the interferents was present in solution at 1000 ppm, a recovery of 85 % was achieved by using 5 M hydrochloric acid and 3 % (weight/volume) L-cystine.

The construction of a hydride generation apparatus for use with an atomic absorption spectrophotometer for the determination of <b>arsenic</b> and other <b>hydride</b> forming elements is described. Flame emission, flame atomic absorption and inductively coupled plasma emission spectroscopy (I. C. P. -E. S.) were used for the determination of other elements. Determinations of arsenic and other elements were made on some geothermal waters of the area. It was found that these waters contribute large (relative to background levels) amounts of arsenic, boron and alkali metals to the aquatic environment. Some terrestrial vegetation surrounding hot pools at Lake Rotokawa and the Champagne Pool at Waiotapu was found to have high arsenic concentrations. Arsenic determinations made on the waters of the Waikato River and some lakes of the Taupo Volcanic Zone revealed that water from the Waikato River between Lake Aratiatia and Whakamaru as well as Lakes Rotokawa, Rotomahana and Rotoehu was above the World Health Organisation limit for arsenic in drinking water (0. 05 µg/mL) at the time of sampling. Arsenic accumulates in the sediments of the Waikato River and Lakes of the Taupo Volcanic Zone. The levels were variable, but characteristically around 100 µg/g. Trout taken from the Waikato River and some lakes in the Taupo Volcanic Zone, had flesh arsenic concentrations of the same order of magnitude as the water from which they were taken. Trout from Lakes Rotorua, Rotoiti and Rotomahana contained average flesh mercury concentrations above the World Health Organisations limit for mercury in foodstuffs (0. 5 µg/g). There were positive correlations between weight, length and flesh mercury concentration. Freshwater mussels from Lakes Rotorua and Tarawera had arsenic concentrations above the World Health Organisations limit for arsenic in foodstuffs (2 µg/g).

40|$|Formation of methyl and hydride metal(loid) {{compounds}} of {{the elements}} arsenic, selenium, antimony, tellurium and bismuth is widespread in the environment –especially under anaerobic conditions – and lead to a notable modulation of mobility and toxicity of these metal(loid) s (Bentley and Chasteen 2002; Chasteen and Bentley 2003). The capability to form volatile methyl metal(loid) s – {{and in some cases}} also volatile hydrides – was shown for numerous methanoarchaea (Meyer et al. 2008). This thesis aimed towards elucidating the cause of the exceptional versatility of methanoarchaea to form metal(loid) methyl and hydride derivatives. The comparison of inorganic metal(loid) reactants converted into volatile derivatives by cell-free crude extracts prepared from non-induced Methanosarcina mazei cultures and by growing cultures of the same strain indicated no inductively elevated expression of enzymes to enable the observed metal(loid) methylation reaction. The in vitro assays needed only amendment by two central cofactors of methanogenesis, methylcobalamin (CH 3 Cob(III)) and 2 -mercaptoethanesulfonate (HS-CoM), to volatilize the same metal(loid) s by methylation as growing cultures upon metal(loid) addition. Surprisingly, not only formation of volatile permethylated species like in the case of M. mazei in vivo but also formation of volatile <b>hydride</b> derivatives of <b>arsenic,</b> selenium and antimony was found. As both, CH 3 Cob(III) and HS-CoM are required for the observed multi metal(loid) methylation and hydride generation by cell-free crude extract but no multi-metal(loid) methylation and hydride generation by these cofactors alone were observed, the additional requirement of an enzyme using both cofactors was indicated. The CH 3 Cob(III) /HS-CoM dependent methyltransferase MtaA {{as an integral part of}} the methylotrophic methanogenesis from methanol was thereupon tested whether it is capable to substitute for the cell-free crude extract. Substitution of cell-free crude extracts by MtaA results in the formation of the same volatile metal(loid) derivatives as formed in the presence of the cell-free crude extracts. This finding supports the assumed connection between metal(loid) methylation and methanogenesis and additionally demonstrates that multi metal(loid) methylation and hydride generation can arise from a key reaction of methanogenesis, the CH 3 Cob(III) dependent HS-CoM methylation. The discovered multi-metal(loid) methylation and hydride generation mechanism from M. mazei might thus represent a common principal for metal(loid) methylation and in some cases also for hydride generation in all methanoarchaea. The closer analyses of <b>arsenic</b> methylation and <b>hydride</b> generation by MtaA in the presence of CH 3 Cob(III) and HS-CoM revealed a decisive role of the CH 3 Cob(III) demethylation product Cob(I). Moreover, the data from the performed experiments points towards a non-oxidative methylation mechanism. The role of Cob(I) is probably to supply electrons to enable the methylation and hydride generation reactions. Analyses of the transcriptional response of M. mazei towards bismuth and arsenic were performed to investigate whether the discovered in vitro multi-metal(loid) methylation pathway is also feasible for the observed in vivo multi metal(loid) methylation. The analyses revealed no expression of genes that hint to an alternative pathway leading to multi-metal(loid) methylation. Even the arsR/arsM operon of M. mazei which was previously described as being capable to form volatile methyl arsenic derivatives from arsenite (Qin et al. 2006; Yuan et al. 2008) is not inductively more expressed at arsenite and arsenate concentrations at which notable methylation by M. mazei was demonstrated previously (Meyer et al. 2008). Instead, genes encoding enzymes participating in cob(I) alamin remethylation and HS-CoM recycling/de-novo syntheses were noticeably up-regulated in the presence of bismuth, thus supporting the assumption that multi-metal(loid) methylation also in vivo is directly coupled to methanogenesis. The transcriptional analyses also indicate some general stress responses towards exposure to elevated bismuth and arsenic concentrations and points towards imbalance of the iron metabolism in M. mazei. Open to question is whether Cob(I) is the only electron donor in vivo that enables the multi-metal(loid) methylation and hydride generation or whether other reduced cofactor are capable to trigger the observed in vivo multi metal(loid) methylation as well...|$|R

The Literature Review in Chapter 2 describes how similarities in the atomic orbital configurations of some transition elements and oxy-anions can explain the synergisms and antagonisms displayed by these chemical entities in biological systems. In particular, the concept of orbital equivalence is used to explain some of the better known cases of mineral antagonisms affecting the health and nutrition of livestock. The antagonism between sulphate and molybdate ions is discussed relative to their ionic structures and to their respective involvements in copper metabolism. The interactions of copper, zinc and iron are examined, particularly in relation to pig nutrition. Interactions between copper, zinc and cadmium are related to their orbital structures and to their ability to form metallothioneins. The ability of high levels of copper and zinc to induce selenium deficiency in chicks is discussed and associated with the similar orbital configurations of zinc, copper and selenate ions. Caution is proposed in the formulation and mineral supplementation of multi-constituent diets used in intensive animal production. Procedures used in the development and calibration of analytical techniques for the determination of eleven elements in pig faeces and pig diets are described in Chapter 3. Copper, zinc, iron, cadmium, lead; sodium, potassium, magnesium, calcium and phosphorus were measured from a single sample digestion using a nitric-perchloric acid mixture. Phosphorus content in the digest was determined colorimetrically and the remaining elements by atomic absorption spectrometry. A separate digestion procedure was required for arsenic which was then measured by atomic absorption spectrometry after generation of <b>arsenic</b> as its <b>hydride.</b> Accuracy and precision of the techniques were rigorously tested using standard addition and recovery procedures- and comparison of values obtained after analysis of the U. S. National bureau of Standards Reference Material ''Orchard Leaves". Chapter 4 reports the chemical composition of pig diets, ingredients of diets and mineral-vitamin supplements collected from 24 commercial piggeries in Victoria. An evaluation of the diets relative to the suggested dietary mineral requirements for grower pigs proposed by the Agricultural Research Council (A. R. C.) indicated that mineral imbalances occurred in many of the diets. High levels of cadmium and lead found in some diets originated principally as contaminants of mineral additives and from meat meals, meat and bone meals and fish meals. The mineral content of the diets was found to be highly variable and indicated differences in choice of dietary ingredients and in the practice of mineral supplementation. Copper, zinc, and iron levels in the diets were particularly variable {{and in the case of}} zinc and iron were present at concentrations far in excess of the levels suggested by. the A. R. C. Chapter 5 describes the chemical composition and in vitro organic matter digestibility (OMD) of pig faeces samples collected from 24 piggeries in Victoria. Pig faeces are shown to be highly variable in chemical and nutrient content and, in some instances, to contain high levels of potentially toxic mineral elements such as copper, cadmium, lead and arsenic. Wide ranges in in vitro OMD values, proximate constituent concentrations and cell wall composition were also recorded. Multiple regression analysis associated low in vitro OMD with high values of cell wall content, phosphorus, copper and lignin/cell wall. Standard additions of phosphorus and copper to pig faeces samples undergoing in vitro fermentation significantly lowered the OMD values of these samples, contributing further evidence of the possible inhibitory effects of these elements to the digestive processes of the ruminant. Some health aspects of refeeding pig faeces as an ingredient in diets for ruminants are discussed, particularly in relation to the presence of toxic minerals such as copper, cadmium and lead. In Chapter 6 a procedure is described for calculating the chemical composition of pig manure using dietary composition, recommended feed intakes, published retention values for each element and estimated excreta outputs fin. an "average" pig of 45 kg liveweight. The variability in the calculated composition of manure is discussed in relation to existing and proposed guidelines limiting the rates of application of pig manure to land. Some aspects of the proposed guidelines for Victoria are discussed; particularly in relation to the suggested maximum rates of manure application to provide not more than 500 kg of nitrogen or 300 kg of potassium/hectare/ annum. Because of the range in the estimated nitrogen content of pig manures, the quantities of manure supplying 500 kg of nitrogen were calculated to range from 46 - 123 tonnes with an average of 63 tonnes. Included in these quantities were widely varying amounts of other elements which would be applied to land with 500 kg of nitrogen; some of which are known to pose environmental problems through leaching to ground water, as run-off to waterways or through ingestion by grazing animals. The potential environmental hazards of applying large amounts of minerals, including heavy metals, to land are discussed and a method is proposed which would permit a more accurate estimate of manure loading rates to provide 500 kg nitrogen/ hectare of land.
