In 1911, he moved to Inwood Country Club and remodeled the course over several years eventually leading to the course hosting the 1921 PGA Championship and the 1923 U.S. Open.

5|$|Of all the U.S. Presidents he {{associated}} with during his career, he was closest to John F. Kennedy. Sinatra often invited Kennedy to Hollywood and Las Vegas, {{and the two}} would womanize and enjoy parties together. In January 1961 Sinatra and Peter Lawford organized the Inaugural Gala in Washington, D.C., held on the evening before President Kennedy was sworn into office. In 1962, Sinatra was snubbed by Kennedy {{during his visit to}} Palm Springs when he decided to stay with the Republican Bing Crosby, due to FBI concerns about Sinatra's alleged connections to organized crime. Sinatra had invested <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> own money in upgrading the facilities at his home in anticipation of the President's visit, fitting it with a heliport, which he later reportedly smashed up with a sledgehammer upon being rejected. Despite the snub, when he learned of Kennedy's assassination he reportedly sobbed in his bedroom for three days.|$|E

Colin Kimberley commented Diamond Head got their complex sound from listening to bands like Black Sabbath and Rush and realising that a song with a single riff throughout was not interesting enough.|$|E

25|$|After {{an absence}} of over twelve months, Ashley {{returned}} to England, and soon succeeded his father as Earl of Shaftesbury. He took an active part, on the Whig side, {{in the general election}} of 1700–1701, and again, with more success, in the autumn election of 1701.

25|$|There {{were many}} suspicions that corrupt figures in {{authority}} had helped Leggio avoid justice, {{with plenty of}} suspicion falling on the General Attorney of Sicily, Pietro Scaglione, who was shot dead on 5 May 1971 with his police bodyguard Antonino Lo Russo. Pentiti Tommaso Buscetta and Salvatore Contorno later said Leggio personally shot Scaglione dead because he either did {{not want him to}} help deliver an acquittal for one of the Corleonesi boss's rivals or {{he did not want to}} leave someone who knew <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> secrets alive. Leggio would later be tried twice for killing Scaglione but was acquitted for insufficient evidence.|$|E
25|$|Although in-fighters {{struggle}} against heavy sluggers, they typically enjoy more success against out-fighters or boxers. Out-fighters prefer a slower fight, with some distance {{between themselves and}} the opponent. The in-fighter tries to close that gap and unleash furious flurries. On the inside, the out-fighter loses <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> combat effectiveness, because he cannot throw the hard punches. The in-fighter is generally successful in this case, due to his intensity in advancing on his opponent and his good agility, which makes him difficult to evade. For example, the swarming Joe Frazier, though easily dominated by the slugger George Foreman, was able to create many more problems for the boxer Muhammad Ali in their three fights. Joe Louis, after retirement, admitted that he hated being crowded, and that swarmers like untied/undefeated champ Rocky Marciano would have caused him style problems even in his prime.|$|E

25|$|Another {{influential}} Greek {{writer and}} intellectual was Adamantios Korais {{who witnessed the}} French Revolution. Korais' primary intellectual inspiration was from the Enlightenment and he borrowed ideas from Thomas Hobbes, John Locke and Jean-Jacques Rousseau. When Korais was a young adult he moved to Paris to continue his studies. He eventually graduated from the Montpellier School of Medicine and spent {{the remainder of his}} life in Paris. He would often have political and philosophical debates with Thomas Jefferson. While in Paris he was a witness to the French Revolution and saw the democracy that came out of it. He spent <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> time convincing wealthy Greeks to build schools and libraries to further the education of Greeks. He believed that a furthering in education would be necessary for the general welfare and prosperity of the people of Greece, as well as the country. Korais' ultimate goal was a democratic Greece much like the Golden Age of Pericles but he died {{before the end of the}} revolution.|$|E
25|$|Jones' {{paternal}} {{grandfather and}} great grandfather were both sea captains. Jones' father, a PhD chemist, worked on detergents such as Jif. Dylan Thomas was {{an acquaintance of}} his father. As a child Jones often stayed at his paternal grandparents' home and spent <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> time in the attic which contained some seafaring equipment, and boxes of books covering {{a wide variety of}} topics, many of which Jones read. He also went to libraries and by the age of 14 years he had read all the works of Charles Dickens. As a child in Ceredigion Jones spoke a lot of Welsh until he was 6 or 7 years old, and as a keen observer of local wildlife was particularly interested in birds. Jones was a pupil at Wirral Grammar School for Boys. At the age of 13 to 14 years old Jones was inspired to study biology by a school teacher.|$|E
25|$|An accumulator, Butt {{works hard}} for his runs, not indulging {{in too many}} big hits; his {{statistics}} show the low number of 19 international sixes to date (1 September 2010) of which he's scored 10 in Twenty20 cricket, 7 in One-Day Internationals and only six in Test cricket. He scores <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> runs between backward point and extra cover. He uses his superb wrist work to angle the bat, placing the ball into gaps using {{the pace of the}} ball to his advantage; a very good technique for ODIs where it is best to keep the scoreboard ticking all the time. He also has the ability to cut the ball very fine down to third man if there are no slips, especially against spin bowlers, as he showed to great effect in his above-mentioned innings of 108 not out. These are his specialties, but he has large range of shots. However, many commentators have expressed that his defensive technique has flaws, and that he is prone to playing at balls outside off-stump which should be left.|$|E
