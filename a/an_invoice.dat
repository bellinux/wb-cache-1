50|$|<b>A</b> {{pro forma}} <b>invoice</b> {{can also be}} used for {{shipments}} containing items that are not being bought or sold, such as gifts, samples and personal belongings, whereas <b>a</b> commercial <b>invoice</b> is used when the commodities shipped are being bought or sold.

50|$|A sales quote is {{prepared}} {{in the form}} of <b>a</b> pro forma <b>invoice</b> which is different from <b>a</b> commercial <b>invoice.</b> It is used to create a sale and is sent in advance of the commercial invoice.

These men were therefore probably favoured tradesmen used before by Parlby, as more local Exeter labour appears {{not to have been}} used.|$|E
25|$|For {{the next}} decade, Haarmann {{primarily}} lived as a petty thief, burglar and con artist. Although he did occasionally obtain legitimate employment, he invariably stole from his employers or their customers. Beginning in 1905, he served several short prison sentences for offenses such as larceny, embezzlement and assault. On one occasion when working legitimately as <b>an</b> <b>invoice</b> clerk, Haarmann became acquainted {{with a female}} employee with whom he would later claim to have robbed several tombstones and graves between 1905 and 1913 (he was never charged with these offenses). Nonetheless, Haarmann spent {{the majority of the}} years between 1905 and 1912 in jail.|$|E
25|$|The {{advantage}} of the VAT system over the sales tax system is that under sales tax, the seller has no incentive to disbelieve a purchaser who says {{it is not a}} final user. That is to say the payer of the tax has no incentive to collect the tax. Under VAT, all sellers collect tax and pay it to the government. A purchaser has an incentive to deduct input VAT, but must prove it has the right to do so, which is usually achieved by holding <b>an</b> <b>invoice</b> quoting the VAT paid on the purchase, and indicating the VAT registration number of the supplier.|$|E
50|$|<b>A</b> {{pro forma}} <b>invoice</b> {{is the same}} as <b>a</b> {{commercial}} <b>invoice</b> which, when used in international trade, represents the details of an international sale to customs authorities. <b>A</b> pro forma <b>invoice</b> is presented in the place of <b>a</b> commercial <b>invoice</b> when there is no sale between the sender and the importer (for example, {{in the case of an}} RMA for replacement goods), or if the terms of the sale between the seller and the buyer are such that <b>a</b> commercial <b>invoice</b> is not yet available at the time of the international shipment. <b>A</b> pro forma <b>invoice</b> is required to state the same facts that the commercial invoice would and the content is prescribed by the governments who are a party to the transaction.|$|R

25|$|Following a {{short period}} of work {{addressing}} envelopes at the National Cyclists' Union in Fleet Street, he found himself unemployed and forced to live on the small amount of money he had saved from his time in Bristol. MacDonald eventually found employment as <b>an</b> <b>invoice</b> clerk in the warehouse of Cooper, Box and Co. During this time he was deepening his socialist credentials, and engaged himself energetically in C. L. Fitzgerald's Socialist Union which, unlike the SDF, aimed to progress socialist ideals through the parliamentary system. MacDonald witnessed the Bloody Sunday of 13 November 1887 in Trafalgar Square, and in response, had a pamphlet published by the Pall Mall Gazette, entitled Remember Trafalgar Square: Tory Terrorism in 1887.|$|E
500|$|Chandler's {{strategy}} in the campaign was to launch an attack upon the Wetherby administration and, before the Clements-Wetherby-Combs faction could react to it, to launch a new one. He claimed Wetherby had used the state's money frivolously by installing air conditioning in the state capitol and installing a $20,000 rug in his office. (<b>An</b> <b>invoice</b> showing that carpeting for the entire {{first floor of the}} capitol had cost one-tenth that amount did not stop Chandler from repeating the claim, which he said [...] "didn't hurt anybody, and people liked to hear it".) After a Wetherby administration official approved the purchase of African mahogany paneling for the governor's office, Chandler charged that Wetherby had gone [...] "clear to Africa" [...] to find paneling for his office and promised that, if elected, he would use good, honest Kentucky wood for decoration. He also denounced the construction of a turnpike connecting Elizabethtown and Louisville, the state fairgrounds, and Freedom Hall as unnecessary.|$|E

Perhaps the most serious allegation accused Brixtofte of having ordered a secretary to purposely delay the payment of <b>an</b> <b>invoice</b> by one day so that Svend Petersen - a friend of Brixtofte - earned 325,000 DKR (57,000 USD) in compensation for the late payment. Svend Petersen has previously been found guilty in fraud in an unrelated case.|$|E
5000|$|Pro forma invoice — In foreign trade, <b>a</b> {{pro forma}} <b>invoice</b> is <b>a</b> {{document}} that states {{a commitment from}} the seller to provide specified goods to the buyer at specific prices.

It is not <b>an</b> actual <b>invoice,</b> and thus the seller does not record <b>a</b> pro forma <b>invoice</b> as <b>an</b> account receivable and the buyer does not record <b>a</b> pro forma <b>invoice</b> as <b>an</b> account payable. <b>A</b> pro forma <b>invoice</b> is not issued by the seller until the seller and buyer have agreed to the terms of the order. In a few cases, <b>a</b> pro forma <b>invoice</b> is issued to request advance payments from the buyer, either to allow production to start or for security of the goods produced.|$|R

2500|$|Woodhouse Israel Cocoa Ltd v Nigerian Produce Marketing Board [...] AC 741 {{held that}} a {{contract}} {{for the sale of}} some coffee beans was agreed to be payable in pound sterling.

The buyers accepted the delivery and invoice without objection. Subsequently the value of the pound fell quite dramatically in relation to Nigerian pounds. The buyers then sought to revert to pound sterling as stated in the contract. The buyers conduct in accepting the invoice unquestionably amounted to an implied clear and unambiguous promise to accept on those terms.|$|E

Five values were initially issued; 1/2r, 1r, 2r, 4r and 8r, to which a 3c. was added in 1865. [...] The stamps were shipped from Mexico City to the district offices where the district name usually would be added to validate the stamps. [...] Starting in July 1864, the stamps were overprinted with the year and <b>an</b> <b>invoice</b> number prior to shipment to the districts.

2500|$|On 10 March 1943, {{while still}} a {{prisoner}} of war, Corporal Clive James Nutting, one of {{the organizers of the}} Great Escape, ordered a stainless steel Rolex Oyster 3525 Chronograph (valued at a current equivalent of £1,200) by mail directly from Hans Wilsdorf in Geneva, intending to pay for it with money he saved working as a shoemaker at the camp. The watch (Rolex watch no. 185983) was delivered to Stalag Luft III on 10 July that year along with a note from Wilsdorf apologising for any delay in processing the order and explaining that an English gentleman such as Corporal Nutting [...] "should not even think" [...] about paying for the watch {{before the end of the}} war. Wilsdorf is reported to have been impressed with Nutting because, although not an officer, he had ordered the expensive Rolex 3525 Oyster chronograph while most other prisoners ordered the much cheaper Rolex Speed King model which was popular because of its small size. The watch is believed to have been ordered specifically to be used in the Great Escape when, as a chronograph, it could have been used to time patrols of prison guards or time the 76 ill-fated escapees through tunnel 'Harry' on 24 March 1944. Eventually, after the war, Nutting was sent <b>an</b> <b>invoice</b> of only £15 for the watch, because of currency export controls in England at the time. The watch and associated correspondence between Wilsdorf and Nutting were sold at auction for £66,000 in May 2007, while at an earlier auction in September 2006 the same watch fetched A$54,000. Nutting served as a consultant for both the 1950 film The Wooden Horse and the 1963 film The Great Escape. Both films were based on actual escapes which took place at Stalag Luft III. It was also reported that in November 2013 the Rolex Speed King owned by Flight Lieutenant Gerald Imeson during the Great Escape was sold for £60,000.|$|E
