Russian authorities were undecided <b>about</b> <b>letting</b> them join, and initially prohibited such initiatives; those who insisted to establish contact with Romania were arrested by Russian police forces. During the same year, after consultations with Romania, the Russian executive reverted such policies.

A reviewer from Sputnikmusic noted that the track's lyrics are [...] "a cross between sexually charged and fully empowering." [...] Commenting about the lyrical content of [...] "Dangerous Woman", Grande stated: [...] "This song is about an empowered woman who meets another person that brings out a different side of her.

Writing for Idolator, Bradley Stern criticized the lyrics but praised its catchiness, [...] "set to a nice, punchy beat, Madonna weaves her voice around a hypnotic groove that practically dares you not to sing along. [...] is all <b>about</b> <b>letting</b> loose {{and having a good}} time". He also opined that while it wouldn't work as a single [...] "it more than serves its purpose as an introduction to Hard Candy". Sal Cinquemani from Slant Magazine wrote, [...] "Pharrell makes his presence known a little too much [...] he manages to get Madonna to stretch vocally in ways she hasn't since Evita. That is, when she's not doing cheeky drag queen impersonations, with trannie-fierce moments sprinkled liberally throughout 'Candy Shop' (“My sugar is raw”) [...] The song is neither sexy nor campy, and somewhere, Dita is throwing her head back, laughing hysterically, and cracking her whip in disapproval", the last part being a reference to the alter ego Madonna incorporated for her fifth studio album, Erotica (1992).|$|E
500|$|In the 1920s, Norman Hastings {{built on}} Berry's {{hypothesis}} proposing Bury as the Ripper, and 100 {{years after the}} Ripper murders William Beadle and Dundee librarian Euan Macpherson published books and articles popularising Bury as a Ripper suspect. They highlighted that the canonical five Whitechapel murders ended in November 1888, which roughly coincided with Bury's departure from Whitechapel. There was graffiti at Bury's Dundee flat that implied that Jack the Ripper lived there, and Macpherson supposed this was written by Bury {{as a form of}} confession. William took Ellen's rings, and the Ripper is believed to have taken rings from victim Annie Chapman. Bury was persistently violent to his wife, threatened her with a knife, and cut open her abdomen after death in a manner not dissimilar to the Whitechapel murderer. In a conversation with her neighbours, Marjory Smith, who ran the shop above the Burys' Prince's Street flat in Dundee, asked them [...] "What sort of work was this you Whitechapel folk have been <b>about,</b> <b>letting</b> Jack the Ripper kill so many people?" [...] Bury did not answer her, but Ellen replied [...] "Jack the Ripper is quiet now." [...] She reportedly told another neighbour, [...] "Jack the Ripper is taking a rest." [...] Beadle and Macpherson argued that Ellen's comments might indicate that she had knowledge of the Ripper's whereabouts.|$|E

500|$|... "Half of Me" [...] is {{a chamber}} pop and R song which lasts for a {{duration}} of three minutes and twelve seconds. The line [...] "You saw {{me on the}} television" [...] is a possible reference to her interview with Oprah Winfrey after her boyfriend, Chris Brown assaulted her. Christina Lee for Idolator thought that {{this is because of}} how Rihanna's popularity and personal life combined with her [...] "paparazzi-documented interactions" [...] with Brown has generated headlines and news stories around the world. [...] "Half of Me" [...] can be interpreted as a [...] "personal essay" [...] rather than just a song. Stacy-Ann Ellis for Vibe noted that the singer appears to have improved her vocals with regard to [...] "experimentation", which she cites as being evident on [...] "Half of Me", as well as [...] "Diamonds" [...] and [...] "Stay". Ellis also noted that co-writer Emeli Sandé's [...] "candid and immediate charm" [...] is present on the song, and described it as the [...] "perfect" [...] ending to the album. Concluding her opinion of the song, Ellis wrote that [...] "Half of Me" [...] is delivered in a [...] "firm and steady voice" [...] which is filled with irony, as she feels that Rihanna is saying no one truly knows who she is and that is half the fun of working her out, but is in no way [...] "remorseful" [...] <b>about</b> <b>letting</b> people in completely: ...|$|E
500|$|Mother's Milk {{features}} {{an array of}} musical styles in its thirteen tracks. Among the songs that surfaced from the Hully Gully sessions in early 1989, [...] "Knock Me Down" [...] {{became one of the}} most radical shifts in style for the band. The introspective lyrics, which analyze the death of Hillel Slovak and the devastating effect drugs can have on life, were a new approach for Kiedis, who primarily wrote of sexual intercourse and a hedonistic lifestyle. The vocalist did not, however, want the track to be associated with [...] "anti-drug" [...] sentiments, claiming, [...] " [...] is <b>about</b> <b>letting</b> your friends know that you need help and then being willing to accept the help of others when you need it, whether it's from drugs, or from a number of other personal problems." [...] According to music journalist Jeff Apter, the song [...] "Knock Me Down" [...] was [...] "clearly the most important track the band had ever laid down; it proved that these Peppers were more than knuckleheads with socks hanging off their cocks." [...] Musically, the track integrates the Chili Peppers' typical punk influences, but asserts heavier emphasis on melody and harmonics that lead into more alternative territory. [...] "Knock Me Down" [...] was originally recorded to be a duet between Kiedis and Frusciante, but the song was remixed before being released as a single; the new mix accidentally highlighted the guitarist's voice instead of Kiedis'.|$|E
500|$|Butterfly {{garnered}} {{critical acclaim}} from music critics. Nathan Brackett, {{senior editor of}} Rolling Stone and author of The Rolling Stone Album Guide, praised the album's producers and Carey's [...] "more controlled" [...] vocals. Brackett noticed a connection between much of Carey's lyrics and her separation from Mottola. Jon Pareles, editor of The New York Times called Butterfly [...] "a new turn" [...] in Carey's career. He wrote, [...] "Carey has sold {{tens of millions of}} albums by being the girl next door with the startling vocal range... but for most of [...] "Butterfly" [...] Carey turned her voice into an airy whisper, as if she would rather charm listeners" [...] compared to over-powering them. Aside from commenting on its deviance from Carey's previous work, he noted songs in which Carey alludes to her failed marriage to Mottola, such as [...] "Butterfly" [...] and [...] "Close My Eyes" [...] which were both released on the album following the divorce with lyrics <b>about</b> <b>letting</b> love go and life struggles. Additionally he wrote, [...] "Since Carey writes her own lyrics, fans might expect a glimpse of marital discord or pride in her new-found autonomy." [...] David Browne from Entertainment Weekly gave Butterfly a B- in his review. Browne wrote: [...] "In Breakdown, [...] demonstrates she can match the staccato, lite-reggae phrasing of her guests, two members of Bone Thugs-N-Harmony." [...] He described an increased intimacy in the music but noted the arrangement made it difficult to hear the lyrics Carey was singing. [...] "Butterfly is undeniably pleasant, with little of the all-conquering bombast usually associated with Carey. But it's also the last thing anyone would have expected from her: blandly self-effacing." ...|$|E
