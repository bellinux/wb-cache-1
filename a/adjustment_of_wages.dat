5000|$|Agriculture {{remained}} in ruin, and Austria relied on food imports from the West. In 1948-1949 substantial share of Marshall Plan funds allocated to Austria {{was used to}} subsidize imports of food. American money, effectively, raised real wages of Austrian workers: grain price in Austria was at {{about one-third of the}} world price. Farmers were depressed by artificially low prices; the Americans were not happy about it too and planned to cut off food subsidies by the end of 1950. Austrian coalition government chaired by Leopold Figl was facing an impending social and economic crisis. They had to manage it alone, without allied support and without financial reserves to smooth the transition. Austrian finances were ruined by post-war hyperinflation. In 1947-1949 the government and organized labor maintained real wages through annual <b>adjustment</b> <b>of</b> <b>wages</b> to prices. The first two price-wage agreements relieved social tension, but {{by the time of the}} third price-wage agreement (1949) failures of this mechanism were obvious. The Communist Party of Austria made the alleged [...] "ripoff of workers" [...] in 1949 a staple of their campaigning and blamed the very existence of wage-price agreements on American influence.|$|E
5000|$|Nahas put {{together}} a reform package during the fall of 2011, which had as its objective to ensure periodic <b>adjustment</b> <b>of</b> <b>wages,</b> {{in accordance with the}} legislation that is already in force, to redistribute revenue from rentier to productive services (by increasing taxes on real estate transactions), and to reinvigorate the role of the unions. Nahas' proposal included creating the basis for universal health care in Lebanon. That package was rejected by the Council of Ministries, a majority of which voted in favor of a plan put forward by Prime Minister Najib Mikati. Determined to see his plan come to fruition, Nahas referred the government's decision to the Lebanese Shoura Council, an administrative court, with a view to examining the decision's legality. The Council found in October 2011 that the government's decision was illegal given that it was not based on existing legislation. In December 2011, Nahas put forth his proposal to the Council of Ministries again, but Mikati once again put forth a proposal of his own. Even though Nahas won the vote this time, the Shoura Council rejected his proposal as it did Mikati's earlier proposal, on the grounds that as a Labour minister Nahas had no legal right to add transportation expenses to the minimum wage. Lebanon's General Labour Confederation threatened to organise its largest strike in history in reaction to the government's decision.|$|E

40|$|This article {{begins with}} the {{hypothesis}} that large economic fluctuations [...] the marked changes in the unemployment rate that characterize market economies [...] are a consequence <b>of</b> problems <b>of</b> <b>adjustment</b> to disturbances, especially <b>adjustments</b> <b>of</b> <b>wages</b> and prices. The article argues that because different prices (including prices of labor and capital) are determined in different ways, shocks lead to marked changes in relative prices, and those disturbances in relative prices greatly exacerbate economic fluctuations. The author looks closely at the price-setting process, providing further insights into why prices exhibit rigidities and why different prices may adjust at different rates. He then explores the consequences of asymmetric price responses...|$|R

Using fourteen waves of the South African Labour Force Survey (LFS) which span the introduction of the minimum wage, we test for these predictions using an index of non-compliance or violation, and find that the predictions of the model are borne out in the data.|$|E

40|$|This paper explores time {{variation}} in the dynamic effects of technology shocks on U. S. output, prices, interest rates as well as real and nominal wages. The results indicate considerable time {{variation in}} U. S. wage dynamics that {{can be linked to}} the monetary policy regime. Before and after the "Great Inflation", nominal wages moved {{in the same direction as}} the (required) <b>adjustment</b> <b>of</b> real <b>wages,</b> and in the opposite direction of the price response. During the "Great Inflation", technology shocks in contrast triggered wage-price spirals, moving nominal wages and prices in the same direction at longer horizons, thus counteracting the required <b>adjustment</b> <b>of</b> real <b>wages,</b> amplifying the ultimate repercussions on prices and hence increasing inflation volatility. Using a standard DSGE model, we show that these stylized facts, in particular the estimated magnitudes, can only be explained by assuming a high degree <b>of</b> <b>wage</b> indexation in conjunction with a weak reaction of monetary policy to inflation during the "Great Inflation", and low indexation together with aggressive inflation stabilization of monetary policy before and after this period. This means that the monetary policy regime is not only captured by the parameters of the monetary policy rule, but importantly also by the degree <b>of</b> <b>wage</b> indexation and resultant second round effects in the labor market. Accordingly, the degree <b>of</b> <b>wage</b> indexation is not structural in the sense of Lucas (1976) ...|$|R

40|$|This note {{investigates the}} {{stability}} {{properties of the}} Keynesian macro-model under the assumption <b>of</b> slow <b>adjustment</b> <b>of</b> nominal <b>wages</b> and expectations <b>of</b> inflation. First, the stability conditions of the 'flexible-interest-rate regime' are related to those derived by Cagan (1956) and Tobin (1975), emphasising the potentially destabilising effect <b>of</b> <b>wage</b> flexibility. Then, taking the restriction of a zero floor to the nominal interest rate into account it is shown that the model exhibits 'corridor stability'. From this follows the conjecture that increasing the rate of steady-state inflation makes it 'more probable' that the system returns to full-employment after a shock of given size. ...|$|R
40|$|This article {{explores the}} <b>adjustment</b> <b>of</b> <b>wage</b> {{bargaining}} institutions to {{international trade in}} Germany. Embracing IPE as opposed to CPE lenses yields a novel interpretation {{of change in the}} institution <b>of</b> <b>wage</b> bargaining. Export dependence of a sector, we argue, has destabilizing effects for industry-wide bargaining by sparking an intra-sectoral cleavage between domestic- and export-oriented enterprises. Specifically, the greater the degree of export dependence of a sector, the greater the degree to which domestic-oriented enterprises within that sector will abandon collective bargaining. We also explain how work-place employee representation through works councils mitigates this effect, such that the presence of works councils helps domestically-oriented firms to hold to collective bargaining agreements {{in the face of a}} sector’s deepening exposure to export markets. These claims find empirical support in the history of labor-relations developments in the metal industry and, especially, in extensive analysis of a cross-section of establishments. Our findings attribute major responsibility to the firms driving globalization for undermining collective bargaining institutions and suggest that economic globalization is a cause of dualization. In all, the article provides fresh ammunition for a version of globalization-induced institutional conversion...|$|R
30|$|However, wage {{rigidity}} {{might arise}} when employers and unions bargain over employment and wages. In this setting, {{the outcome of}} the bargaining game is outside the labour demand curve; in the particular case of isoelastic demand, efficient bargaining contracts imply rigid real wages (McDonald and Solow 1981). In the presence of implicit contracts, the perceived nature of the shock is also relevant. If the shock is temporary, firms are less likely to cut wages than if they perceive the shock as permanent (Guiso et al. 2005). If unionisation or implicit contracts limit the <b>adjustment</b> <b>of</b> <b>wages</b> to demand fluctuations, we expect to see greater adjustment of employment or hours.|$|E
40|$|Since Eastern Germany's {{conversion}} {{to a market}} economy wages have remained considerably below the West German wage level. This article looks at the role of establishment-specific factors—such as sectoral affiliation and size of the labour force—in this process. A non-parametric decomposition that has played a prominent role in the gender wage gap literature is applied to breakdown the East-West wage gap into its constituent components. Using establishment data from German employment statistics, the article demonstrates that the catching-up process of Eastern Germany's wage level is hindered by the shift in its economic structure towards lower-paying types of companies, which has caused the lagging behind in the <b>adjustment</b> <b>of</b> <b>wages.</b> ...|$|E
30|$|The {{nominal wage}} {{adjustment}} (price adjustment) function determines that wages adjust to any (ex-ante) excess demand or {{supply in the}} labor market. Similarly, prices adjust to an excess demand or supply in the goods market. 5 This process of <b>adjustment</b> <b>of</b> <b>wages</b> and prices to disequilibria is {{sometimes referred to as}} the Bowden-process, after Bowden (1978). Important for the adjustment dynamics is also knowledge about the adjustment speed of prices relative to wages. In the orthodox Keynesian case, prices adjust faster than wages, while in the Neo-Keynesian case, wages adjust faster than prices. Clearly, both cases differ as a result in the adjustment of real wages after a shock, as we show in Sect.  5.|$|E
