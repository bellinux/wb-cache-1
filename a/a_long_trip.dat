Pat Stanton later praised the organisation and facilities provided by the league, although conceding that it was <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>trip,</b> causing some tiredness (it was played between domestic league seasons) and homesickness.|$|E

25|$|The {{intense heat}} in the holds of the ships had a {{transforming}} effect on the wine, as discovered by Madeira producers when one shipment was returned to the island after <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>trip.</b> The customer was found to prefer the taste of this style of wine, and Madeira labeled as vinho da roda (wines that have made a round trip) became very popular. Madeira producers found that aging the wine on long sea voyages was very costly, so began to develop methods on the island to produce the same aged and heated style. They began storing the wines on trestles at the winery or in special rooms known as estufas, where the heat of island sun would age the wine.|$|E
25|$|A {{number of}} {{conspiracy}} theories have been published, based on CIA and FBI surveillance of Lennon {{due to his}} left-wing activism, and on the actions of Mark Chapman in the murder or subsequent legal proceedings. Barrister and journalist Fenton Bresler raised the idea in a book published in 1990. Liverpool playwright Ian Carroll, who has staged a drama conveying the theory that Chapman was manipulated by a rogue wing of the CIA, suggests Chapman was not so crazy {{that he could not}} manage <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>trip</b> from Hawaii to New York shortly prior to the murder. Claims include that Chapman was a Manchurian candidate, including speculation on links to the CIA's Project MKULTRA. At least one author has argued that forensic evidence proves Chapman did not commit the murder, while others have criticized the theories as based on possible or suspected connections and circumstances.|$|E

25|$|The Second World War overshadowed, for a time, {{almost all}} {{intellectual}} and artistic production. In 1939 Wolfgang Paalen {{was the first}} to leave Paris for the New World as exile. After <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>trip</b> through the forests of British-Columbia, he settled in Mexico and founded his influential art-magazine Dyn. In 1940 Yves Tanguy married American Surrealist painter Kay Sage. In 1941, Breton went to the United States, where he co-founded the short-lived magazine VVV with Max Ernst, Marcel Duchamp, and the American artist David Hare. However, it was the American poet, Charles Henri Ford, and his magazine View which offered Breton a channel for promoting Surrealism in the United States. The View special issue on Duchamp was crucial for the public understanding of Surrealism in America. It stressed his connections to Surrealist methods, offered interpretations of his work by Breton, as well as Breton's view that Duchamp represented the bridge between early modern movements, such as Futurism and Cubism, to Surrealism. Wolfgang Paalen left the group in 1942 due to political/philosophical differences with Breton.|$|E

500|$|The Gregorian {{mission was}} a group of Italian monks and priests sent by Pope Gregory the Great to Britain in the late 6th and early 7th centuries to convert and Christianize the Anglo-Saxons from their native Anglo-Saxon paganism. The first group {{consisted}} of about 40 monks and priests, some of whom had been monks in Gregory's own monastery in Rome. After <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>trip,</b> during which they almost gave up and returned to Rome, they arrived in the Anglo-Saxon kingdom of Kent in 597. [...] Gregory sent a second group of missionaries in 601 as reinforcements, along with books and relics for the newly founded churches. From Kent, the missionaries spread to the East Anglian kingdom and to the north of Britain, but after King Æthelberht of Kent's death, the mission was mostly confined to Kent. Another mission was sent to the kingdom of Northumbria when Æthelberht's daughter married King Edwin of Northumbria around 625. After Edwin's death in 633, a pagan backlash against Christianization occurred, and the mission was again confined to Kent; most of the missionaries fled Northumbria because they feared the pagans who returned to power after Edwin's death.|$|E

Nine games were set up in as many cities, with eight held on the East Coast and one in San Francisco before the team returned home. In scheduling the extended trip away from Oregon, Hobson sought to show the team [...] "different styles of play and officiating" [...] and help them prepare for games later in the season. As a result of the extended travel, a University of Oregon student newspaper nickname the club the [...] "Wandering Webfoots". The first game of the trip came in December at New York City's Madison Square Garden against City College of New York (CCNY). Oregon had a poor start to the game; according to the Sporting News, the team was [...] "confused by officials' interpretation of legal and illegal screens to the moving picks set by City College of New York." [...] CCNY took an early 10-point lead, but Oregon cut its deficit in half {{by the end of the}} first half, and tied the game at 30–30.

500|$|Finally her soliciting {{paid off}} and in 1881, Rosebery {{was offered a}} {{government}} position acceptable to him, that of Under Secretary at the Home Office with special responsibility for Scotland. He had sought the position feeling that Scotland was neglected by the Liberal Government who {{were more interested in}} Ireland. However, immediately upon assuming the job he began to demand a place in the cabinet. The office he sought was that of Lord Privy Seal, a position Gladstone refused on account of Rosebery's inexperience in Government. It appeared that Rosebery was showing his true colours and he was accused of behaving like a spoilt child, with doubts cast over the honourableness of his reasons for refusing the Under Secretaryship of the India Office. Lady Rosebery, [...] "conscious of her husband's supreme ability," [...] wanted him in the cabinet and was furiously agitating her husband's discontent until Rosebery threatened to resign his Home Office position. Lady Rosebery had an angry row with Gladstone's wife, where Mrs Gladstone pointed out that if Rosebery resigned he would have nothing but horse racing to interest him, and that Lady Rosebery should be patient as her husband was young. Rosebery, accepting that a cabinet place {{was not going to be}} forthcoming, resigned from Government. Lady Rosebery, realising further appeal to the Gladstones was pointless, tried a new avenue—Lord Hartington, the immensely influential Secretary of State for War, who was already quarrelling with Gladstone over the Irish home rule problem, and whom she allegedly met by chance at Preston Railway Station. Inviting him into her carriage for the journey to London, she pleaded her husband's case for three hours to her captive listener. The Roseberys then immediately left England and their children for <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>trip</b> to America and Australia. On their return in 1885 Rosebery was appointed Lord Privy Seal, complete with the seat in the cabinet which he sought.|$|E
