The results showed that the bleaching efficiency was significantly affected by the linear, quadratic and some of the interaction terms. The optimum conditions derived via RSM were: temperature- 152. 73 °C; time- 2. 60 h; adsorbent dosage- 6. 09 g; adsorbent/oil ratio- 0. 05 g/mL; stirring speed- 39. 34 rpm; and under these conditions the predicted bleaching efficiency was 82. 67 % which has good correlation with the experimental value of 82. 25 %. The high prognosis obtained in this study has shown that 5 -level 5 factor fractional central composite design of the RSM is suitable for predicting the optimum adsorption conditions of color pigments from palm oil using <b>activated</b> Ukpor <b>clay...</b>|$|R
