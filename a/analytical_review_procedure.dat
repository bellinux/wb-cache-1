40|$|While {{there is}} a growing {{professional}} interest on the application of Benford 2 ̆ 7 s law and "digit analysis" in financial fraud detection, there has been relatively little academic research to demonstrate its efficacy as a decision support tool {{in the context of an}} <b>analytical</b> <b>review</b> <b>procedure</b> pertaining to a financial audit. We conduct a numerical study using a genetically optimized artificial neural network. Building on an earlier work by others of a similar nature, we assess the benefits of Benford 2 ̆ 7 s law as a useful classifier in segregating naturally occurring (i. e. non-concocted) numbers from those that are made up. Alongside the frequency of the first and second significant digits and their mean and standard deviation, a posited set of 2 ̆ 7 non-digit 2 ̆ 7 input variables categorized as "information theoretic", "distance-based" and "goodness-of-fit" measures, help to minimize the critical classification errors that can lead to an audit failure. We come up with the optimal network structure for every instance corresponding to a 3 × 3 Manipulation-Involvement matrix that is drawn to depict the different combinations of the level of sophistication in data manipulation by the perpetrators of a financial fraud and also the extent of collusive involvement. © 2010 Elsevier B.

40|$|Financial {{reporting}} frauds {{and earnings}} manipulation have attracted high profile attention recently. There {{have been several}} cases by businesses of {{what appears to be}} financial statement fraud, which have been undetected by the auditors. In this thesis, the main purpose is to identify some of the reasons why auditors have not detected financial statement fraud and to suggest possible solutions for improving the audit process in these areas. In order to achieve this target, some cases of the fraudulent financial statements of revenue recognition will be analysed. The main reasons why auditors did not detect financial statement fraud from the technical side were application of <b>analytical</b> <b>review</b> <b>procedures</b> as “sufficient audit evidence;” weaknesses in audit risk model and risk assessment concerning internal control; and audit failure in revenue recognition and related-party transaction disclosure. The ethical issues that relate to the detection of fraud include auditor independence and the amount of non-audit services provided by the auditor. Several solutions will be recommended to enhance the audit process in detecting the financial statement fraud in accordance with the reasons we have determined...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: Fraud in {{business}} {{is a matter of}} grave social and economic concern. The Treadway Commission recommended that the Auditing Standards Board require the use of <b>analytical</b> <b>review</b> <b>procedures</b> to improve the detection of fraudulent financial reporting. This research is an exploratory study to determine if the financial statements of fraudulent companies differ from those of non-fraudulent companies. Fraudulent firms were identified by examining the SEC’s Accounting and Auditing Enforcement Releases issued between 1982 and 1995. The fraudulent firms (n = 79) were then matched with non-fraudulent firms on the basis of firm size and industry. Using this matched-pairs design, ratio analysis for a seven-year period (i. e., the fraud year-/+ 3 years) was conducted on 21 variables. Overall, 16 ratios were found to be significant. Of these, only three ratios were significant for three time periods. Of the 16 statistically significant ratios, only five were significant during the period prior to the fraud year. Using discriminant analysis, misclassifications for fraud firms ranged from 41 % to 76 %. These results provide empirical evidence that financial ratios are not an effective means to detect the occurrence of fraud...|$|R

40|$|This study {{investigates the}} {{relationship}} between the audit objective and the choice of substantive procedures used to ensure the satisfaction of the auditor. The research that gave support to the current study is exploratory and adopted a non-probabilistic sample comprising 28 auditors of an Undergraduate and Master’s degree programs in Accounting of a Brazilian University. Thus, to preserve the maturity and skill expected of the respondents of the research we restricted a minimum of one year of auditing experience for the auditor that might have served in one of the Big Four Auditing firm. Methodology wise, we applied a qualitative ordinal approach and the research question is as follows: What are the characteristics of <b>Analytical</b> <b>Review</b> <b>Procedures</b> that guide auditors’ judgment while choosing among a mix of procedures to meet the requirements of the substantive tests? Our analysis was based on absolute frequency analysis of the use of the substantive procedures. In this respect, our results revealed that auditor’s satisfaction is anchored on the materiality of the accounts or group of accounts to be audited. Yet they give a relative importance to judgment of risk and relevance of misstatement that each account presents. In so doing, auditors give preference to substantive procedures in which one is able to gather information from third parties to confirm accounting balances while giving less priority to recalculation of routine tests developed by the audited entities...|$|R
40|$|This study {{investigates the}} {{adoption}} {{and use of}} Generalized Audit Software (GAS) by Indonesian audit firms. GAS is specialized software that enables the auditor to automate tasks including client risk assessment. The researcher believed GAS use in Indonesia is not widespread and one explanation {{for this is the}} absence of professionally qualified accountants (ADB, 2003) and the World Bank (2011) reported that audit practices in Indonesia face a quality related problem especially in mid-tier and small-sized firms. Audit firms began using IT, including GAS (Braun and Davis, 2003, Coderre, 1996, Debreceny et al., 2005, Lovata, 1990, Junaid, 2005, Alles et al., 2002), during the 1980 s to improve effectiveness and efficiency (Fischer, 1996). However, previous studies (Janvrin et al., 2008 b, Debreceny et al., 2005) indicate that external auditors used applications infrequently and instead, were likely to depend on unsophisticated <b>analytical</b> <b>review</b> <b>procedures</b> (Fischer, 1996). Traditional <b>analytical</b> <b>review</b> <b>procedures,</b> such as ratio analysis, have limited ability to detect fraud (Hogan et al., 2008) and without rigorous processes, many professionals believe that stakeholders are not adequately informed and therefore the quality of auditing is questionable. Most studies into audit technology or audit software have focused on the largest firms in developed economies (Bedard et al., 2003, Curtis and Payne, 2008, Vendrzyk and Bagranoff, 2003). Studies in developed economies indicate that audit software has been adopted extensively by Big four firms (Janvrin et al., 2008 a). The results of this study are based on semi-structured in-depth interviews with 27 external auditors from firms of all sizes, a senior member of a professional body, and 6 staff from 2 Government agencies. The interviewees were selected using the snowballing method. The interviews were in-depth, semi-structured and included open-ended questions to elicit views and opinions from participants related to adoption and use of GAS. In addition, archival records and secondary sources were also reviewed to interpret the findings. This study contributes to the literature through its Indonesian focus, deeper insights through use of interview rather than survey data, knowledge of large and small audit firms, and the application of a new theoretical framework to the audit literature, the Technology, Organisation and Environment (TOE) framework. Major findings imply that the use of commercially available software remains limited across audit procedures. The TOE framework indicates that the influence of technological, organisational and environmental factors on GAS adoption is spread equally however {{the findings of this study}} identify environmental influences as the most important in the Indonesian context. Client related factors such as size, industry sector, needs and expectations and regulator&rsquo;s and the professional accountancy body&rsquo;s supports mainly dictated GAS adoption. There was mixed perception between participants regarding the competitiveness of a firm, assured audit quality and working uniformity as benefits of GAS use. However, all participants agreed that improved efficiency and increased audit productivity can be achieved from GAS use...|$|R
40|$|The auditors' {{preliminary}} <b>analytical</b> <b>review</b> <b>procedures</b> (PARPs) {{have recently}} received increased {{attention in the}} accounting literature, because of the growing realization that PARPs may significantly enhance audit effectiveness and efficiency. Although both judgmental and statistical PARPs (JARPs and SARPs respectively) are recognized in the professional literature, earlier research has concentrated exclusively on statistical ARPs (SARPs). This research bias is inappropriate, given that SARPs merely supplement, but do not replace, auditor-judgments in PARPs. Enhancement of audit effectiveness and efficiency requires, therefore, evidence bearing on several aspects of auditors' PARPs judgments. This dissertation uses a model based on Signal Detection Theory to provide evidence relating to the following aspects of auditors' PARPs judgments: (a) judgmental accuracy, (b) decision errors, (c) implicit loss functions, and (d) information required to facilitate PARPs judgments. The major findings of the study were: (1) auditors can make reasonably accurate AR judgments {{on the basis of}} limited information available at the onset of an audit; (2) their responses were affected by judgmental biases, with a propensity to flag for intensive audit account book values which are fairly presented; (3) the auditors' judgments were miscalibrated, being mostly overconfident; and (4) simple ARPs such as ratio analysis, scanning, and comparisons amongst data, are those preferred by auditors for their PARPs judgments. This study's findings suggest the need to identify the causes, and subsequently mitigate the effects, of judgment biases before the potential of auditors' AR judgments at enhancing audit effectiveness and efficiency can be fully realized...|$|R
40|$|The {{first part}} of the study {{examined}} the effect of industry risk changes on perceived audit risk at the financial statement level and whether these changes depended on individual differences such as experience and tolerance for ambiguity. ^ Forty-eight auditors from two offices of one of the “Big 5 ” CPA firms participated in this study. The ANOVA results supported the effect of industry risk in the assessment of audit risk at the financial statement level. Higher industry risk was associated with higher perceived audit risk. Tolerance for ambiguity was also significant in explaining the changes in the assessment of audit risk. Auditors with a high tolerance for ambiguity perceived lower audit risk than auditors with a low tolerance for ambiguity. Although ANOVA results did not find experience to be significant, a t-test for experience showed it to be marginally significant and inversely related to audit risk. ^ The second part of this study examined whether differences in perceived audit risk at the financial statement level altered the extent, nature or timing of the planned auditing procedures. The results of the MANOVA suggested an overall audit risk effect at the financial statement level. Perceived audit risk was significant in explaining the variation in the number of hours planned for the total cycle and the number of hours p 1 anned for the tests of balances and details. Perceived audit risk was not significant in determining the <b>analytical</b> <b>review</b> <b>procedures</b> planned, but assessed inherent risk at the cycle level was significant. The higher the inherent risk the more analytical procedures were planned. Perceived audit risk was not significant in explaining the timing of the procedures, but individual differences were significant. The results showed that experienced auditors and those with a high tolerance for ambiguity were less likely to postpone the performance of the interim procedures or the time at which the majority of audit work would be done. ...|$|R

40|$|There is {{considerable}} {{evidence in the}} audit literature that even though auditors usually identify the relevant information needed to propose and select the correct cause of an unexpected fluctuation, they frequently do not propose the correct cause, and {{even when they do}} propose the correct cause, they often fail to select it.

However, contrary to my predictions, auditors who rely on both decision aids do not outperform auditors who rely on only one decision aid.
