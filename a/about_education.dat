It was founded in Cooper by Kentucky native William L. Mayo, who served as its president from its foundation until his death in 1917, and moved to Commerce after its original campus burned down in 1894. A popular school for active teachers seeking state certification or recertification, it was largely shaped by Mayo's own personal beliefs <b>about</b> <b>education,</b> which focused on participation and hands-on learning instead of memorization or rote learning.|$|E

25|$|Randolph was {{admired by}} the {{community}} and his supporters for his fiery character and {{was known as a}} man that was passionate <b>about</b> <b>education</b> and equality for all. He applied rousing electioneering methods, which he also enjoyed as a hobby. Randolph appealed directly to yeomen, using entertaining and enlightening oratory, sociability, and community of interest, particularly in agriculture. This resulted in an enduring voter attachment to him regardless of his personal deficiencies. His defense of limited government appeals to modern and contemporary conservatives, most notably Russell Kirk (1918–1994).|$|E

This discussion led to greater involvement of the government, through its ministries, in the curriculum and administration of state education, leading to the eventual introduction of the National Curriculum some ten years later.

Initially approached to report on the zoo, the council was suitably impressed with his submission of six pages of closely typed analysis on where the zoo should be headed.

25|$|These {{statistics}} {{shed some}} interesting facts <b>about</b> <b>education</b> in Pakistan; the gender disparity in education {{is much lower}} in urban places vis-à-vis rural areas. One of the possible explanations of this pattern is relatively stronger dominance of tribal, feudal and patriarchal traditions in rural areas. Moreover, {{there are very few}} employment opportunities for women in rural areas, and thus, there is very little financial incentive for families to send their girls to schools. However, {{it is interesting to note}} that, despite the meagre representation of females in the education sector, the level of achievement of female students is consistently far higher than that of their counterpart male students. Girls generally outclass boys in examination, and they are also higher achievers in universities. Unfortunately, the majority of the girls never get an opportunity to develop their educational capabilities.|$|E

25|$|Nothing {{is known}} <b>about</b> <b>education</b> of José. At {{unspecified}} time he married Carmen Torres Ternero, a local girl he was distantly related to as her great-grandmother {{descended from the}} Díez de la Cortina family; her grandfather, José de Torres Díez de la Cortina, was alcalde of Marchena and a cattle-breeder. The couple had no children. The best known relative of José Díez de la Cortina is his younger brother , who in the early 1880s migrated to the United States; in New York City {{he set up a}} language school which soon developed into a successful business; himself he became a pioneer of modern teaching of foreign languages, with a number of works published and Cortina Institute of Languages well operational until today. The Torres Díez de la Cortina relatives made their name developing the bull-breeding business and gained acknowledgement in the late 19th century. José’s distant relative was , a conservative politician who held various ministerial jobs during final years of the Restoration. The Carlist title of Conde de la Cortina de la Mancha, conferred upon José’s father in the 1870s, was recognized by the Madrid court in 2003 and currently rests with Mariano Ternero Caro.|$|E
25|$|Cory gained St Ives {{from the}} Liberal Unionists at the Liberal {{landslide}} victory of 1906. He held the seat as a Liberal {{in the elections}} of January and December 1910. This was {{in the face of}} a strong Tory resurgence in English agricultural seats in January 1910, the effect of which was not as marked in Cornwall. The Cornish results may be attributable to the significant nonconformist electorate there and their concerns <b>about</b> <b>education</b> against the background of the Tory preference for education to be promoted through Church of England schools. The issue of education was likely to have been a factor in Cory’s initial victory in 1906 too. There was a high nonconformist turnout in 1906 in the wake of the controversy over the 1902 Education Act which replaced School Boards elected by ratepayers in their district, which had been popular with radicals, with Local Education Authorities under the control of County or Borough Councils. Nonconformist electors objected that rate aid was being used to support the teaching of religious views to which they were opposed, 'Rome on the Rates'; Anglican and Roman Catholic Church schools, supported by public funds, were not under public control and teachers in these sectarian schools were subject to religious tests. More nonconformist MPs were elected to Parliament in 1906 than Conservatives MPs.|$|E

500|$|The early {{curriculum}} {{taught by}} ETNC reflected Mayo's own personal beliefs <b>about</b> <b>education,</b> focusing on participation and hands-on learning instead of memorization or rote learning. Speaking {{in terms of}} a hypothetical student, Mayo described his philosophy as [...] "instead of lecturing for him, put him to lecturing you." [...] In the words of high school English instructor David Gold, Mayo [...] "ruled his school with unquestioned authority, boxing unruly students about the ears, sending others home for infractions, and insisting upon exacting standards for English instruction". Gold describes Mayo's pedagogy as [...] "complex" [...] and argues that [...] "Mayo complicates and challenges our attempts to create discrete classifications of rhetorical epistemologies and to connect pedagogical practices to political ideologies".|$|E

500|$|Florida's {{school system}} was in disarray {{at the end}} of the Civil War; in 1866 a Northerner named A. E. Kinne noted there were fewer schools for white {{children}} than freedmen's schools for black children. In 1860, there were no official schools for black children and slaves were prohibited from any education. At the same time, there were 97 public schools for white children and 40 private academies for them, some of which appeared to get public funding. [...] In May 1865, the total Florida population was 154,000, and an estimated 47% of it was black, almost all of whom were former slaves. [...] A difference in attitudes <b>about</b> <b>education</b> between the races was apparent as freed blacks saw education as the key to increasing their opportunities, or at least escaping conditions they had endured during servitude.|$|E
500|$|Evans {{published}} {{instructions for}} local Klan leaders that detailed {{how to run}} meetings, recruit new members, and speak to local gatherings. He advised leaders to avoid [...] "raving hysterically" [...] in favor of [...] " [...] scientific ... presentation of facts". In addition, he urged them to forbid members from bringing their Klan regalia home from meetings and to perform background checks on applicants. He instructed Klan members to shun vigilantism but to assist police and attempted, with some success, to recruit police officers into the Klan. Emphasizing the difference between his organization and the more violent 19th-century Ku Klux Klan, Evans formed Klan-themed groups for children. As the Klan attempted to portray itself as a movement led by cultured, well-educated people, its leaders spoke <b>about</b> <b>education</b> in the U.S. Evans believed that public schools could create a homogeneous society and saw education advocacy as an effective form of public relations.|$|E
