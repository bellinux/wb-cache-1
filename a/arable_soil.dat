There are prominently two distinct areas {{in the region that}} are divided around the area of Wilsey Road, in the east end of the city. In the west side, the bedrock underneath the earth is topographically dominant, whereas the other is controlled by Pleistocene and recent deposits leading to the rivers (resulting in the area being shallow and wide). Fredericton and its surroundings are rich in water resources, which, coupled with highly <b>arable</b> <b>soil,</b> make the Fredericton region ideal for agriculture.

40|$|The <b>arable</b> <b>soils</b> {{from two}} multiperiod {{settlements}} were analyzed to identify changes in agricultural methods over time. The settlement middens were also analyzed {{to determine whether}} potential fertilizers were discarded unused. Results suggest that in the Neolithic period (~ 4000 – 2000 B. C. in the UK) the <b>arable</b> <b>soils</b> at Tofts Ness, Orkney, and Old Scatness, Shetland, were created by flattening and cultivating the settlements’ midden heaps in situ. The arable area at Tofts Ness was expanded in the Bronze Age (~ 2000 – 700 B. C. in the UK), and the new land was improved {{by the addition of}} ash, nightsoil, and domestic waste. Cultivation continued briefly after the fields were buried in windblown sand in the Late Bronze Age or Early Iron Age, but by the Early Iron Age cultivation ceased and organic-rich material was allowed to accumulate within the settlement. By contrast, at Old Scatness, arable production was increased in the Iron Age (~ 700 B. C. –A. D. 550 in Scotland) by the intensive use of animal manures. The results indicate that during the lifespan of the two settlements the <b>arable</b> <b>soils</b> were fertilized to increase production, which was intensified over time...|$|R

Indeed, the whole world even in its most crowded districts was filthy with flies and swarming with needless insect life to an extent which is now almost incredible. A population map of the world in 1950 would have followed seashore and river course so closely in its darker shading as to give an impression that homo sapiens was an amphibious animal. His roads and railways lay also along the lower contours, only here and there to pierce some mountain barrier or reach some holiday resort did they clamber above 3000 feet.

Here, we used acetylene, an inhibitor of AOB and AOA ammonia monooxygenase (AMO), and 1 -octyne, a selective inhibitor that specifically inhibits AOB AMO, to investigate how AOB versus AOA contribute to N 2 O emissions in two distinct <b>arable</b> <b>soils.</b> Soil amended with ammonium (NH 4 (+)) increased N 2 O emissions to a greater extent than nitrate (NO 3 (-)), and acetylene had a greater impact on N 2 O emissions in NH 4 (+) -treated soils than that in NO 3 (-) -amended soils, which indicated that nitrification was the dominant N 2 O emitting process in these two <b>arable</b> <b>soils.</b> In the alluvial and red soil, the percentage of evolved N 2 O after application of NH 4 (+) by AOB were 70. 5 similar to 78. 1 % and 18. 7 similar to 19. 7 % by AOA, respectively. Quantitative PCR revealed that NH 4 (+) addition stimulated AOB growth, and the growth could be significantly inhibited by acetylene or 1 -octyne in the two soils. The stimulation of N 2 O emissions by NH 4 (+) and the relative suppression by inhibitors paralleled fluctuations in the AOB growth. In addition, cumulative N 2 O emissions were not correlated with AOA abundance in the two soils.

40|$|In this paper, zinc {{flows in}} <b>arable</b> <b>soils</b> of the Czech Republic and zinc {{fractions}} in <b>arable</b> <b>soils</b> are studied. Furthermore, a zinc uptake by agricultural plants is focused. Based on {{a database of}} the programme The basal soil monitoring system (BSMS) a static zinc balance for <b>arable</b> <b>soils</b> {{on the national level}} was assessed. This programme is carried out by The Central Institute for Supervising and Testing in Agriculture (CISTA) in Brno. As a representative for the zinc balance calculation, 121 monitoring plots were chosen. The Czech Republic net zinc fluxes ranged from – 1250 g. ha–  1. y–  1 to + 5595 g. ha–  1. y–  1, median + 453 g. ha–  1. y–  1. The maximum zinc fluxes are typical of plots with manure applications. An atmospheric deposition is the most important input of zinc into <b>arable</b> <b>soils.</b> It makes 96, 6 % of the whole inputs. Leaching and run-off are neglected in this zinc balance by reason of missing credible data. The project Examination of zinc availability in dependence on its form in soil was established to provide more information about behavior of zinc in soil. The first step was starting a greenhouse pot experiment, which was focused on comparison of several extraction agents (AR, 2 M HNO 3, 0. 43 M HNO 3, Mehlich III, DTPA, CAT, 1 M NH 4 NO 3, 0. 01 M CaCl 2). Four soils with increasing zinc content were picked out for this experiment (Domanínek, Chrlice, Kutná Hora, Hlízov). Total zinc contents in these selected soils ranged from 156. 8 to 583. 7 ppm in dry matter (Aqua regia extraction). Contents in plants were in wide range from 20. 7 to 273 ppm in dry matter according to the plant variety and used soil.

40|$|In the Republic of Moldova, non-sustainable {{arable farming}} led to severe {{degradation}} and erosion of fertile steppe soils (Chernozems). As a result, the Chernozems lost about 40 % of their initial amounts of soil organic carbon (SOC). The {{aim of this}} study was to remediate degraded <b>arable</b> <b>soils</b> and promote carbon sequestration by implementation of cover cropping and green manuring in Moldova. Thereby, the suitability of the legume hairy vetch (Vicia sativa) as cover crop under the dry continental climate of Moldova was examined. At two experimental sites, the effect of cover cropping on chemical and physical soil properties as well as on yields of subsequent main crops was determined. The results showed a significant increase of SOC after incorporation of hairy vetch mainly due to increases of aggregate-occluded and mineral-associated OC. This was related to a high above- and belowground biomass production of hairy vetch associated with a high input of carbon and nitrogen into <b>arable</b> <b>soils.</b> A calculation of SOC stocks based on equivalent soil masses revealed a sequestration of around 3 t C ha − 1 yr − 1 as a result of hairy vetch cover cropping. The buildup of SOC was associated with an improvement of the soil structure as indicated by a distinct decrease of bulk density and a relative increase of macroaggregates at the expense of microaggregates and clods. As a result, yields of subsequent main crops increased by around 20 %. Our results indicated that hairy vetch is a promising cover crop to remediate degraded steppe soils, control soil erosion and sequester substantial amounts of atmospheric C in <b>arable</b> <b>soils</b> of Moldova...|$|R

The objectives of this study were (1) to evaluate the impact of P fertilizer inputs on the quantities and chemical forms of P, and (2) to investigate relationships between P forms SOM and land use.

However, their actual impact on ozone formation is strongly related to their spatial and temporal emission patterns, which warrant high-resolution estimates. Here, we combined an agro-ecosystem model and geo-referenced databases to map these sources over the 12 000 km 2 administrative region surrounding Paris, France, with a kilometric level resolution. The six most frequent arable crop species were simulated, with emission rates ranging from 1. 4 kg N–NO ha- 1 yr- 1 to 11. 1 kg N–NO ha- 1 yr- 1. The overall emission factor for fertilizer-derived NO emissions was 1. 7 %, while background emissions contributed half of the total NO efflux. Emissions were strongly seasonal, being highest in spring due to fertilizer inputs. They were mostly sensitive to soil type, crops' growing season and fertilizer N rates. The use of an agro-ecosystem model at regional scale makes it possible to map the emissions of nitric oxide from <b>arable</b> <b>soils</b> at a resolution compatible with tropospheric ozone models...|$|R
