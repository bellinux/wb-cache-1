After her operation, Calment required a wheelchair and abandoned her daily routine.|$|E
5|$|During closing arguments, {{defense counsel}} John Pope {{attempted}} to discredit Darby; the latter reacted by assaulting one of Pope's co-counselors with <b>a</b> <b>cane.</b> The trial lasted thirteen days, {{and despite the}} absence of any physical evidence, including a murder weapon, the jury returned a guilty verdict after only an hour of deliberation on May 19. Beauchamp was sentenced to be executed by hanging on June 16, 1826.|$|E

Although initially finding their conversations useless, he cures Olivia's inability to walk without <b>a</b> <b>cane</b> {{by the end of}} the episode.|$|E
5|$|A {{central part}} of the show's premise was that the main {{character}} would be handicapped. The initial idea was for House to use a wheelchair, but Fox turned down this interpretation (for which the crew was later grateful). The wheelchair idea turned into a scar on House's face, which later turned into a bad leg necessitating use of <b>a</b> <b>cane.</b> The original script called for House to be 34 years old; however, Shore later explained {{that he did not want}} the character to be that young.|$|E
5|$|De Hauteclocque {{broke his}} leg {{in two places}} in a fall from his horse in 1936. He told his company {{that it was his}} own fault for riding on the {{shoulder}} of the road. Thereafter he frequently walked with <b>a</b> <b>cane.</b> After another mishap involving losing his way during a tactical exercise and getting stuck in a field cordoned off with barbed wire, he told them that when you have done something really stupid, it is best to admit it.|$|E

5|$|During {{the second}} chorus, Brown enters another room {{surrounded}} by people in animal heads, and performs the third dance sequence in the video with his backup dancers. Towards {{the end of the}} chorus, Brown and his dancers appear back inside the main room and continue dancing. At one point, the video is slowed down as Brown and his dancers do flips. In other scenes, he is seen dancing alone with <b>a</b> <b>cane</b> in a rain-filled room, wearing white dress pants, a black tank top and a fedora. Brown then splits into three people, comes back together, takes off his shirt and throws it at the camera, causing its lens to crack.|$|E
5|$|In September 1945, Minton {{suffered}} a heart attack while in Washington; he was hospitalized for three months at Walter Reed Hospital. After returning to work, he was forced to rest regularly due to gradually worsening anemia, and he sought to lessen his workload. To further complicate his health, on August 5, 1949, Minton tripped over a stone in his yard and broke his leg. The injury forced him to walk with <b>a</b> <b>cane</b> for the remainder of his life.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 1850s, the antislavery Republican Party became the {{dominant}} political organization in Massachusetts, led by Senators Charles Sumner and Henry Wilson who espoused Garrison's views in Congress and further increased sectionalism. In 1856, Sumner delivered {{a speech on}} the Senate floor so scathing and insulting to pro-slavery politicians that Representative Preston Brooks of South Carolina severely beat him with <b>a</b> <b>cane.</b> By 1860, the Republicans controlled the Governor's office, the state legislature and the mayoralty of Boston.|$|E

40|$|<b>A</b> white <b>cane</b> {{is one of}} {{the most}} common {{mobility}} aids for the visually impaired. However, it does not help users with visual impairments find obstacles at head- or knee-level, or at distances greater than 1 m. To overcome these difficulties, smart canes with vibration alerts and an extended obstacle detection range have been introduced. However, several usability problems mean that users with visual impairments rarely adopt <b>a</b> smart <b>cane.</b> The goal of this study was to understand the potential for using <b>a</b> smart <b>cane,</b> along with the existing usability problems and then to develop design guidelines for improved smart canes. Both quantitative and qualitative methods were used to address these goals. A quantitative evaluation was performed of users with visual impairments using <b>a</b> prototype smart <b>cane.</b> Then, in-depth interviews of cane users were conducted. The results showed that <b>a</b> smart <b>cane</b> was more effective in avoiding obstacles than <b>a</b> white <b>cane,</b> but there were several potential usability problems. On the basis of the results, design guidelines for <b>a</b> smart <b>cane</b> prototype were devised...|$|R

Even so, during this period, {{he managed to get}} the Confederate War Department to discharge all draftees from the Alabama-Coushatta tribe, which had distanced itself completely from the conflict.|$|E
5|$|Norton {{spent his}} days {{inspecting}} San Francisco's streets in an elaborate blue uniform with gold-plated epaulettes, {{given to him by}} officers of the United States Army post at the Presidio of San Francisco. He also wore a beaver hat decorated with a peacock feather and a rosette. He frequently enhanced this regal posture with <b>a</b> <b>cane</b> or umbrella. During his inspections, Norton would examine the condition of the sidewalks and cable cars, the state of repair of public property, and the appearance of police officers. Norton would also frequently give lengthy philosophical expositions on a variety of topics to anyone within earshot.|$|E
5|$|Towards {{the end of}} his life, Peel {{started to}} lean heavily on <b>a</b> <b>cane</b> with a golden head. He lived out his final days in Ardwick Green, near his daughter. Peel died on 12 September 1795, and was buried in St John's Church, Manchester. His wife survived him by six months; one of her final wishes was to outlive her husband. He left his estate split equally between his eight children, valued at £13,000 each (worth about £1.1 million in 2013).|$|E

50|$|Early {{industries}} were tinned {{fish and}} sugar <b>cane.</b> <b>A</b> sugar <b>cane</b> mill was built, {{but it was}} destroyed by a bushfire in 1875. A post office was opened in 1963 and closed in 1979.|$|R
5|$|Although {{partially}} blind from glaucoma {{by the age}} of 109 {{and completely}} blind from cataracts by 111, he nevertheless retained his memory and good health until his final days; his medical history showed no signs of high blood pressure, heart or kidney trouble or diabetes. He was able to walk without <b>a</b> <b>cane</b> or walker, preferring not to use one, and was able to feed himself, including Cheerios for breakfast, his favorite vanilla ice cream with his other meals and a daily can of Ensure for energy. While he enjoyed recounting tales from his military experience, he never complained about the segregated nature of his unit, preferring instead to focus on his own exploits on the job.|$|E
5|$|John Kramer's widow Jill Tuck meets Matt Gibson, an {{internal}} affairs detective from the precinct where Detective Mark Hoffman works. She incriminates Hoffman {{in exchange for}} protection and immunity from prosecution. Gibson, who has distrusted Hoffman ever since he saved his life by gunning down a homeless man, agrees to her terms. Meanwhile, Hoffman abducts a skinhead gang – Dan, Evan, Jake and Kara – and places them in a junkyard trap that kills them all, leaving the reverse bear trap at the scene to incriminate Jill, who is later put into protective custody. After a meeting of Jigsaw survivors, including Lawrence Gordon, who cauterized his leg on a steam pipe after escaping the bathroom and now uses <b>a</b> <b>cane</b> and prosthetic foot, Hoffman abducts Bobby Dagen, a self-help guru who achieved fame and fortune by falsifying his own survival story. He sends Gibson some videos with cryptic clues to the game's location, offering to end the games if Jill is given to him.|$|E
5|$|Kennedy {{returned}} to the Senate in January 1965, walking with <b>a</b> <b>cane.</b> He employed a stronger and more effective legislative staff. He took on President Lyndon B. Johnson and almost succeeded in amending the Voting Rights Act of 1965 to explicitly ban the poll tax {{at the state and}} local level (rather than just directing the Attorney General to challenge its constitutionality there), thereby gaining a reputation for legislative skill. He was a leader in pushing through the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965, which ended a quota system based upon national origin and which, despite Kennedy's predictions, would have a profound effect on the demographic makeup of the United States. He played a role in creation of the National Teachers Corps.|$|E
50|$|Modern canes {{may differ}} from the {{traditional}} fixed structure. For instance, <b>a</b> quad <b>cane</b> has <b>a</b> base attached to the shaft that provides increased stability by having four ferrules, and <b>an</b> adjustable <b>cane</b> may have two shaft segments telescoping one inside the other to allow adjustment for multiple sizes.|$|R

She made her in-ring debut for the brand on the August 22, 2006 episode of ECW on Sci-Fi in a losing effort, as part of a six-person mixed tag team match which saw herself, Knox, and Test lose to Dreamer, Sandman and Torrie Wilson, in what was the last match of the feud.|$|E
5|$|Laffoon's early {{education}} was {{obtained in the}} public schools of Madisonville. While there, one of his teachers was his sister, Susan Isabella Laffoon, who was only 16 years old. At age 15, while plowing a field, Laffoon was kicked in the hip by a mule, requiring a six-week stay in a Nashville hospital. In the winter of the same year, he slipped on some ice and re-injured the hip. As a result of these injuries, his right leg was one-and-a-half inches shorter than his left leg, requiring him to wear special shoes and walk with <b>a</b> <b>cane</b> and a limp {{for the rest of his}} life. After his injury, Laffoon's parents decided that he could not make his living as a farmer and sent him to the private school of W. C. O'Bryan. By age 17, he was teaching in the common schools of Charleston in Hopkins County.|$|E
5|$|Quintilian {{provides}} the most extensive theory of primary education in Latin literature. According to Quintilian, each child has in-born ingenium, a talent for learning or linguistic intelligence that {{is ready to be}} cultivated and sharpened, as evidenced by the young child's ability to memorize and imitate. The child incapable of learning was rare. To Quintilian, ingenium represented a potential best realized in the social setting of school, and he argued against homeschooling. He also recognized the importance of play in child development, and disapproved of corporal punishment because it discouraged love of learning—in contrast to the practice in most Roman primary schools of routinely striking children with <b>a</b> <b>cane</b> (ferula) or birch rod for being slow or disruptive.|$|E
