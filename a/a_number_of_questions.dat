25|$|The {{judgment}} proposes {{several questions}} {{to be put to}} the Enlarged Board of Appeal in an effort to resolve perceived conflicts between the different decisions of the Boards of Appeal. In response to this, Alain Pompidou, then president of the European Patent Office (EPO), wrote to Lord Justice Jacob to say that while clarification of certain issues relating to excluded subject matter would be welcomed, there were currently insufficient differences between relevant Board of Appeal decisions that would justify a referral. Instead, a referral would be appropriate if the approach taken by one Board of Appeal would lead to the grant of a patent whereas the approach taken by another Board would not. On 22 October 2008, Pompidou's successor Alison Brimelow did refer <b>a</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>questions</b> to the Enlarged Board.

However, Michelle Erica Green in her March 2011 review for TrekNation described the episode as so bad that she thought fans only watched it to play drinking games.

500|$|Michelle Erica Green, {{while writing}} for the website TrekNation, thought that the episode had strong {{character}} development despite the other flaws present. She felt that it opened up <b>a</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>questions</b> about the abilities of the Andorians due to their similarity to the Aenar, and enjoyed the issues present in the Tucker/T'Pol relationship. Although she {{said that it was}} the [...] "weakest" [...] of the story arc, it was also the most [...] "gripping". Jamahl Epsicokhan, at his website Jammer's Reviews, gave the episode two out of four, adding that [...] "The Aenar" [...] was [...] "aimless" [...] since the majority of the storyline ended in the previous episode. He found fault with the plot, as the Romulan threat was unspecific, and because of several plot holes which the episode failed to explain.|$|E

[...] Wolters took a liking to Schmidt, and showed him both the original Chronik and the correspondence in which Wolters had informed Speer of the censoring of the record. [...] When confronted by Schmidt with this information, Speer both denied knowledge of the censorship and stated that the correspondence was not genuine. [...] While Speer pledged not to take legal action against Schmidt for using the disputed papers (after obtaining his doctorate, Schmidt published his thesis as a book, Albert Speer: The End of a Myth), he made no such promise regarding Wolters. [...] Speer published a formal revocation of a power of attorney he had given Wolters while in Spandau and disputed on legal grounds [...] Wolters' right to the Chronik and other papers. [...] The dispute was only ended by Speer's sudden death in London in September 1981.|$|E
500|$|The three coinage bills—Maine Centennial, Alabama Centennial, and Pilgrim Tercentenary—were {{considered}} {{in that order}} by the House of Representatives on April 21, 1920. As the Maine and Alabama pieces were considered, Ohio's Warren Gard asked <b>a</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>questions</b> about various matters, including regarding the wisdom of having so many half dollar designs issued, {{though he did not}} object to the passage of either bill. After the Pilgrim bill came to the floor, Gard asked Walsh why the bill provided for 500,000 half dollars, so much more than for the state coins; Walsh responded that it was because the coin was for a 300th anniversary rather than just a 100th. [...] Gard followed up this point, asking {{if it had been a}} 400th anniversary, whether even more coins would be justified, and Walsh agreed. Both Walsh and Vestal were asked by Gard how many half dollars were in circulation, but neither legislator knew. Washington Representative John Franklin Miller asked whether the coin was to commemorate the original landing of the Pilgrims at Provincetown or their subsequent landing at Plymouth, but Walsh did not answer the question definitively. Congressman James W. Dunbar of Indiana noted that the price of silver had risen so high that the Mint might be out of pocket in striking the coins, and asked if the federal government would cover any losses; Vestal responded that Massachusetts would. Vestal then moved the committee amendment to reduce the authorized mintage from 500,000 to 300,000, attracting the attention of Gard, who asked the reason for the change and was told the original bill had a typographical error. Walsh had told the committee that he had selected the figure of 500,000 since the Pilgrim anniversary was more important than the Maine state centennial. Gard enquired if the amendment had been approved by the committee, and when he was told it had, asked if the Pilgrim half dollars would buy more than ordinary half dollars to which Walsh replied, [...] "why, I think very likely, especially on Cape Cod." [...] Gard indicated his hope that he could spend a few days there that summer, and Vestal stated that Gard would be welcome to obtain and spend half dollars in any of the three states celebrating anniversaries. The bill passed the House without recorded opposition.|$|E
