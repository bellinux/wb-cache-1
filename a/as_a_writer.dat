5|$|After his brother's death, Poe began more earnest {{attempts}} {{to start his}} career <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>writer.</b> He chose a difficult time in American publishing to do so. He was the first well-known American to try to live by writing alone and was hampered {{by the lack of}} an international copyright law. Publishers often produced unauthorized copies of British works rather than paying for new work by Americans. The industry was also particularly hurt by the Panic of 1837. There was a booming growth in American periodicals around this time period, fueled in part by new technology, but many did not last beyond a few issues and publishers often refused to pay their writers, or paid them much later than they promised. Throughout his {{attempts to}} live <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>writer,</b> Poe repeatedly had to resort to humiliating pleas for money and other assistance.|$|E

5|$|In December 1800 George Austen {{unexpectedly}} {{announced his}} decision to retire from the ministry, leave Steventon, and move the family to 4, Sydney Place in Bath. While retirement and travel were good for the elder Austens, Jane Austen was shocked to be told she was moving from the only home she had ever known. An indication of her state of mind is her lack of productivity <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>writer</b> during the time she lived at Bath. She {{was able to make}} some revisions to Susan, and she began and then abandoned a new novel, The Watsons, but there was nothing like the productivity of the years 1795–1799. Tomalin suggests this reflects a deep depression disabling her <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>writer,</b> but Honan disagrees, arguing Austen wrote or revised her manuscripts throughout her creative life, except for a few months after her father died.|$|E
