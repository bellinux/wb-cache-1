5|$|In total the {{sculpture}} cost £1.42 million to design <b>and</b> <b>construct</b> — twice the original estimate, as the initial costing had neglected to include installation costs. Funding was sourced from a European Regional Development Fund contribution of £700,000, the North West Development Agency, contributing £500,000, and Manchester City Council providing £120,000.|$|E
5|$|That {{year the}} {{congregation}} raised $14,000 (today $) and hired the architectural firm Lescher, Kibbey and Mahoney to design <b>and</b> <b>construct</b> a synagogue building near Central Avenue and Culver Street, in Downtown Phoenix. The building, a simple, stuccoed, gable-end-to-the-street Mission Revival Style structure, {{was constructed in}} 1921–1922, and an annex added in 1930.|$|E

5|$|WMATA expects {{an average}} of one million riders daily by 2030. The need to {{increase}} capacity has renewed plans to add 220 cars to the system and reroute trains to alleviate congestion at the busiest stations.

5|$|As a result, in {{an attempt}} to avoid a naval {{conflict}} with the superior British Royal Navy, Portugal adjusted the borders of her colony and the modern borders of Mozambique were established in May 1881. Control of Mozambique was left to various organisations such as the Mozambique Company, the Zambezi Company and the Niassa Company which were financed and provided with cheap labour by the British Empire to work mines <b>and</b> <b>construct</b> railways. These companies penetrated inland from the coastline, setting up plantations and taxing the local populace who had until then resisted encroachment by the colonists.|$|E
5|$|Casey {{and some}} members of his staff came ashore on A-Day; the advance echelon of his ASCOM {{headquarters}} arrived two days later. Work began immediately on the airfield at Tacloban, and commenced on airfields in central Leyte soon after they were captured. Heavy seasonal rains thwarted attempts to develop the airbases in central Leyte and {{it was decided to}} abandon their development <b>and</b> <b>construct</b> a new airbase on the coast at a site occupied by Sixth Army headquarters. The need to get aircraft based on Leyte to stop the Japanese from reinforcing the island was so pressing that Lieutenant General Walter Krueger agreed to move his headquarters.|$|E

5|$|Despite rising {{traffic to}} Las Vegas, WAE reduced {{service to the}} city amid the Great Depression. Once its {{financial}} situation improved, the airline bought the airfield and established a monopoly on flights. When the city attempted to purchase the field and build a more modern terminal, WAE refused. With the advent of World War II, however, WAE was pressured to sell the airfield. Nevadan Senator Pat McCarran helped obtain federal funding {{for the city to}} buy the field <b>and</b> <b>construct</b> a new terminal. He also helped establish a gunnery school by the United States Army Air Corps at the field. For the senator's contributions, the airport was named McCarran Field in 1941.|$|E
5|$|Discussions {{concerning}} {{the scope and}} nature of base development in the Admiralty Islands were held in early February between representatives of SWPA and Admiral William Halsey, Jr.'s neighbouring South Pacific Area (SOPAC). The original intention was forces from SWPA would capture the islands <b>and</b> <b>construct</b> the airbase, while SOPAC {{would be responsible for}} the development of the naval base. The SOPAC representatives indicated they would not be able to supply troops or materials in the early stages, so it was resolved SWPA would also undertake the initial stages of naval base development.|$|E
5|$|Following the storm, the United Nations {{deployed}} {{field assessment}} teams {{to survey the}} damage caused by Katrina. The International Organization for Migration helped relocate affected families <b>and</b> <b>construct</b> at least 300 new residences for victims of Katrina and Hurricane Mitch the year prior. The Pan American Health Organization also deployed assessment teams to survey the area for the possibility of post-storm diseases. Due to the lack of any significant damage, the name Katrina was not retired and was re-used in the 2005 season; however, due to the catastrophic damage caused by the storm, it was retired in 2006 and was replaced with the name Katia.|$|E

5|$|In 1613 James I {{returned}} the castle to Thomas Howard, the Earl of Suffolk, but the castle was now derelict and {{he chose to}} live at Audley End House instead. Thomas's son, Theophilus Howard, fell heavily into debt and sold the castle, the estate and the former Great Park to Sir Robert Hitcham in 1635 for £14,000; as with several other established parks, such as Eye, Kelsale and Hundon, the Great Park was broken up turned into separate estates. Hitcham died the following year, leaving the castle and the manor to Pembroke College in Cambridge, {{with the proviso that}} the college destroy the internal castle buildings <b>and</b> <b>construct</b> a poorhouse on the site instead, operating {{under the terms of the}} recently passed Poor Law.|$|E
5|$|In November 1999, Arsenal {{decided to}} leave Highbury <b>and</b> <b>construct</b> a new 60,000-seat stadium in nearby Ashburton Grove. It was {{confirmed}} in October 2004 that the new stadium would be called the Emirates Stadium {{as part of a}} sponsorship deal with Emirates Airlines. The stadium opened in July 2006; Arsenal's offices were moved to a new building, Highbury House, which was named in commemoration of the former stadium.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1990s, a {{regional}} transit authority (RTA) {{was formed to}} plan <b>and</b> <b>construct</b> a light rail system for the Seattle area. After an unsuccessful attempt in 1995, regional voters passed a $3.9 billion plan to build light rail under the RTA in 1996. The downtown transit tunnel had already been planned for eventual light rail use and was built with tracks that would {{be incorporated into the}} initial system. The RTA, later renamed Sound Transit, approved the tunnel as part of the route of its initial light rail line in 1999. Ownership of the tunnel, including its stations, was transferred to Sound Transit in 2000 but returned two years later to King County Metro under a joint-operations agreement.|$|E

5|$|Lawrence {{hoped that}} the Manhattan Project would develop {{improved}} calutrons <b>and</b> <b>construct</b> Alpha III racetracks, but they were judged to be uneconomical. The Alpha tracks were closed down in September 1945. Although performing better than ever, they could not compete with K-25 and the new K-27, which commenced operation in January 1946. In December, the Y-12 plant was closed, thereby cutting the Tennessee Eastman payroll from 8,600 to 1,500 and saving $2million a month. Staff numbers at the Radiation laboratory fell from 1,086 in May 1945 to 424 {{by the end of}} the year.|$|E
5|$|On 25 October 2007, {{the council}} {{approved}} the final business case. Approval was given on 22 December 2007 for TIE to sign contracts with CAF to supply vehicles and BBS (a consortium of Bilfinger Berger and Siemens) to design <b>and</b> <b>construct</b> the network. Contract negotiations finished in April 2008, and construction started in June 2008. By this stage {{the cost of}} the project was estimated at £521 million. Funding problems and political disputes led to the scaling back of the original plans. In April 2009, the council cancelled phase 1b, citing revenue shortfall created by the economic slowdown to save an estimated £75 million. The Granton extension was also cancelled.|$|E
5|$|Orangutans {{are among}} the most {{intelligent}} primates; they use a variety of sophisticated tools <b>and</b> <b>construct</b> elaborate sleeping nests each night from branches and foliage. The apes have been extensively studied for their learning abilities. There may even be distinctive cultures within populations. Field studies of the apes were pioneered by primatologist Birutė Galdikas. All three orangutan species are considered to be critically endangered. Human activities have caused severe declines in populations and ranges. Threats to wild orangutan populations include poaching, habitat destruction, and the illegal pet trade. Several conservation and rehabilitation organisations are dedicated to the survival of orangutans in the wild.|$|E

Collecting pieces of his theory from each of his interviews and destinations appears as a recurring metaphor. He includes anecdotes and social commentary.|$|E
