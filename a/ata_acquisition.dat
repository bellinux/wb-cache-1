40|$|Abstract. Tower platforms, with {{instrumentation}} at six levels {{above the}} surface to a height of 30 m, were used to record various atmospheric parameters in the surface layer. Sensors for measuring both mean and fluctuating quantities were used, {{with the majority of}} them indigenously built. Soil temperature s nsors up to a depth of 30 cm from the surface were among the variables connected to the mean data logger. A PC-based <b>ata</b> <b>acquisition</b> system built at the Centre for Atmospheric Sciences, IISc, was used to acquire the data from fast response sensors. This paper eports the various components ofa typical MONTBLEX tower observatory and describes the actual experiments carried out in the surface layer at four sites over the monsoon trough region {{as a part of the}} MONTBLEX programme. It also describes and discusses several checks made on randomly selected tower data sets acquired uring the experiment. Checks made include visual inspection of time traces from various sensors, comparative plots of sensors measuring the same variable, wind and temperature profile plots, calculation of roughness lengths, statistical nd stability parameters, diurnal variation of stability parameters, and plots of probability density and energy spectrum for the different sensors. Results from these checks are found to be very encouraging and reveal the potential for further detailed analysis to understand more about surface layer characteristics...|$|E
40|$|A simple microcomputer-basedd <b>ata</b> <b>acquisition</b> systemi s set up {{to obtain}} the I-V {{characteristic}} of the Langmuir probe. The system is ideal for extensive probe data collection {{in the study of}} steadystate plasmas. The Langmuir probe is a simple but effective tool for the diagnostic of fairly large volume, relatively cold and low density plasmas. F rom the I-V. characteristico f the probe, plasmap arameters such ag the electron temperature, electron density, space potential and electron energy distribution can be deduced. For a time-varying plasma, the pulsed Langmuir probera must be used. In the case of a steady-state plasma, it is usually sufficient to use the point-by-point technique, although the pulsed method can also be employed. However, the process of obtaining the Langmuir probe characteristic by the point-by-point method and its analysis is tedious and time-consuming if it is done manually. This is particularly true in casesw here the Langmuir probe is employeda s a basicd iagnostic and extensived ata are required to be collectedc oncurrently with other diagnosticso f the plasma. In this note, a simple microcomputer-basedd <b>ata</b> <b>acquisition</b> systemf or the Langmuir probe is described. The system employs an Apple-II microcomputer to control the variation of the probe's bias potential as well as to monitor the probe curent automatically. The data acquisition system consists of a 64 k RAM Apple-II micrommputer which is supported by a high-resolution CRT display unit; two mini floppy diskdrives and a dot matrix printer with highresolution graphic capability (Fig. l). Data acquisition is done via a multi-channel A/D + D/A interface card (Mountain Computer Inc.) which can be plugged directly into the expansion slot of the Apple-II. This interface card provides 16 cannelse ach of analog-todigital and digital-to-analogc onverters. T he rangeo f its analogi nput/output level is - 5 V to + 5 V, with a digital equivalenceo f 0 to 255. The experimentasl et-upo f the miqocomputer-basedo uble Langmuirp robe measuremenotf a plasma is as shown in Fig. 2. A I kO resistor is connected in place of the usual microammeter for measuringth e probe curent, Ip. The potentiald rop acrosst he I kS 2 r esisteri s expectedt o be of the order of mV only and hence it must be amplified before it is fed into an A/D channel of the computer. This is done by using a HP 2470 A data amplifier. The probe potential Vp is supplied by using the HP 457 A power amplifier acting as a variable power supply. The output of the power amplifier can be varied within the range of - 3 OV to + 30 V by applying a voltage of - 3 V to + 3 V to its input. Thus when used in conjunction with a digitaltoanalog converter, the HP 467 A power amplifier functions as a low voltage digitally controlled power supply.

40|$|The {{need for}} {{air-to-ground}} missiles with Autonomous Target <b>Acquisition</b> (<b>ATA)</b> seekers is {{in large part}} driven {{by the failure of}} pilot-guided bombs in cloudy conditions (such as demonstrated in Kosovo). Passive-millimeter wave (PMMW) sensors have the ability to see through clouds; in fact, they tend to show metallic objects (such as mobile ground targets) in high contrast regardless of weather conditions. However, their resolution is very low when compared with other popular ATA sensors such as laser-radar (LADAR). We present an ATA algorithm suite that combines the superior target detection potential of PMMW with the high-quality segmentation and recogni-tion abilities of LADAR. Preliminary detection and seg-mentation results are presented for a set of image-pairs of military vehicles that were collected for this project using an 89 GHz, 18 ” aperture PMMW sensor and a 1. 06 µ very-high-resolution LADAR. 1...|$|R
40|$|NLP {{methods for}} {{automatic}} information access to rich technological knowledge sources like patents are of great value. One important resource for accessing this knowledge is the tech-nical terminology of the patent domain. In this paper, we {{address the problem}} of automatic terminology <b>acquisition</b> (<b>ATA),</b> i. e., the problem of automatically identifying all technical terms in a document. We analyze technical terminology in patents and define the concept of technical term based on the analysis. We present a novel method for labeling large amounts of high-quality training data for ATA in an unsupervised fashion. We train two ATA methods on this training data, a term candidate classifier and a conditional random field (CRF), and investigate the utility of different types of features. Finally, we show that our method of automatically generating train-ing data is effective and the two ATA methods successfully generalize, considerably increasing recall while preserving high precision relative to a state-of-the-art baseline. ...|$|R
40|$|The Department of Defense has {{attempted}} to use recent advances in modeling and simulation to improve the acquisition process for weapons systems. This Simulation Based Acquisition brought advances in the process, but considerable disagreement remains over the universal applicability of this approach. This paper focuses on the challenges of applying modeling and simulation to the Test and Evaluation of a weapon system with significant Pilot-Vehicle interface concerns. The Standoff Land Attack Missile Expanded Response (SLAM ER) is an aircraftlaunched missile with GPS/INS guidance for navigation to the target area and Man In The Loop (MITL) control in the terminal phase. The MITL control is conducted through a two way video and control data link which transmits infrared video from the missile seeker to the control aircraft and guidance update commands from the pilot back to the missile. After initial fielding of the weapon system, two preplanned product improvement programs were begun to add both an Automatic Target <b>Acquisition</b> (<b>ATA)</b> functionality to aid in pilot target identification {{as well as a}} capability to engage moving targets at sea (ASuW). Both Software in the Loop and Hardware in the Loop simulation...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a novel analytical method measuring {{the impact of}} reference model accuracy on tactical, model-based automatic target <b>acquisition</b> (<b>ATA)</b> algorithm performance. Military tacticians are currently governed by various standards regarding quality requirements for georeferenced imagery and geospatial data sources. In some new generation systems, this imagery provides the basis for generating 3 D reference models for input into model-based ATA systems. This paper analyses the criticality of this absolute coordinate accuracy requirement by assessing ATA algorithm performance using 3 D reference models created {{from a variety of}} commercially available data sources, including aerial and terrestrial photography, and airborne laser scanner data. ATA algorithm performance is analysed using a software tool that uses a variety of open source techniques and image processing functions typically found in tactical, air-to-ground, model-based ATA systems. Each of the 3 D reference models, extracted {{in a number of different}} areas of interest, was matched against a corresponding sequence of infrared video data. This provided a series of results, which were analysed as a function of both reference model accuracy and object selection and representation. Initial results indicate that the absolute accuracy of the reference models created for this research has a minor impact on ATA algorithm performance when compared with the impact of the content of the reference models, taking into account the complexity of the area of interest. This suggests that a wider array of data sources may be suitable for 3 D reference model construction, than is currently accepted...|$|R
