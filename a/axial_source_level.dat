An eventual goal of 40 -mA H- current at 80 keV beam energy with 0. 13 πmm-mrad (1 rms normalized) emittance at 12 % duty factor (120 Hz, 1 ms) is desired. To attain this goal, two types of surface converter sources are being investigated in which H- ions are extracted either radially or axially through a line-cusp magnetic field. The radial source produces 18 mA H- in a 28 -day run cycle for LANSCE production while the <b>axial</b> <b>source</b> has been developed to the desired 40 mA current. However, an emittance growth of factor 2 - 3 accompanied the increased <b>axial</b> <b>source</b> current.

40|$|In {{this paper}} a new method for {{efficient}} computation of the capacitance and conductance {{per unit length}} of the multilayer multiconductor IC interconnects is suggested. The conductors are thick or infinitesimally thin, and can be placed anywhere in the structure. The present spectral formalism involves constituents that contain only exponential functions with nonpositive arguments. The vertical spectral input admittance at the interface levels up to the <b>source</b> <b>level</b> are calculated recursively, starting at the uppermost and lowermost interfaces of the layered medium. These admittances at the <b>source</b> <b>level</b> are then {{used to calculate the}} electrical potential at the <b>source</b> <b>level.</b> With the known voltage and the admittances at the <b>source</b> <b>level,</b> the spectral amplitudes at the <b>source</b> <b>level</b> are known. Computation of the amplitudes at other interfaces is, progressively, carried out by expressing the amplitudes at any interface above the <b>source</b> <b>level</b> in terms of the amplitude on the interface just below it and expressing the amplitudes at any interface below the <b>source</b> <b>level</b> in terms of the amplitude on the interface just above it. This results in an numerical stable and efficient scheme for computing electric potential anywhere in the structure. In addition, the semi-analytical evaluation of the entries of the Galerkin matrix leads to a very efficient and accurate computer code. Calculated results are given for some cases of the integrated circuit interconnects to show the advantages and simplicity of new approach as compared to the methods available in the literature...|$|R

40|$|Multibeam {{bathymetry}} systems use {{the travel}} time of acoustic pulses as observable {{to determine the}} depth of the seafloor. In order to provide appropriate echo quality necessary for depth determination and seafloor shape recording, a high acoustic <b>source</b> <b>level</b> is needed. The main factors affecting the sound level of the emitted sonar pulse during the travel through the water column are geometrical spreading, absorption and the backscattering strength of the seabed. The reception threshold of the acoustic receiver determines the sound level needed to detect the acoustic pulse. Common deep sea multibeam systems use the determined depth as an indication to control the <b>source</b> <b>level</b> necessary for the successive ping. Lowering the transmission <b>level</b> of hydroacoustic <b>sources</b> is a general demand to reduce the impact of sonar signals on the marine life. In order to protect marine mammals we studied the capability of RV Polarstern's Hydrosweep multibeam system. However, reducing the <b>source</b> <b>level</b> finally limits the ability of accurate depth determination. The recent upgrade of Hydrosweep provides the possibility to adjust the <b>source</b> <b>level</b> based on the echo quality.

40|$|The <b>source</b> <b>level</b> of {{an animal}} sound is {{important}} in communication, since it affects the distance over which the sound is audible. Several measurements of <b>source</b> <b>levels</b> of whale sounds have been reported, but the accuracy of many is limited because {{the distance to the}} source and the acoustic transmission loss were estimated rather than measured. This paper presents measurements of <b>source</b> <b>levels</b> of social sounds (surface-generated and vocal sounds) of humpback whales from a sample of 998 sounds recorded from 49 migrating humpback whale groups. Sources were localized using a wide baseline five hydrophone array and transmission loss was measured for the site.

Vocalization amplitude and frequency influences communication range and may be shaped by many ecological and physiological factors including energetic costs.

40|$|Cumulative {{acoustic}} {{exposure is}} used as an indicator for the risk of negative impact to animals {{as a consequence of}} exposure to underwater sound. The free-field energy of a single source, defined as the total acoustic energy that would exist in the source’s free field, is shown to be closely related to the total cumulative exposure added over a population of animals. On this basis, the free-field energy of an underwater sound source, referred to as its “energy cost”, is proposed as an indicator of its environmental risk. For otherwise the same conditions, the environmental cost so defined of a multi-beam echo sounder (frequency 100 kHz) is about 40 000 times less than that of a search sonar (1 kHz) of the same <b>source</b> <b>level.</b> In turn, the cost of the same sonar is about 300 times less than that of a pile driver of the same energy <b>source</b> <b>level,</b> implying that <b>source</b> <b>level</b> (or energy <b>source</b> <b>level)</b> alone is a poor indicator of environmental risk. The main {{reason for this is that}} <b>source</b> <b>level</b> takes no account either of the amount of space occupied by the sound once in the water, or of the time required for the sound to dissipate.

40|$|Toothed whales use {{echolocation}} {{to locate}} and track prey. Most knowledge of toothed whale echolocation stems from studies on trained animals, and {{little is known about}} how toothed whales regulate and use their biosonar systems in the wild. Recent research suggests that an automatic gain control mechanism in delphinid biosonars adjusts the biosonar output to the one-way transmission loss to the target, possibly a consequence of pneumatic restrictions in how fast the sound generator can be actuated and still maintain high outputs. This study examines the relationships between target range (R), click intervals, and <b>source</b> <b>levels</b> of wild bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops sp.) by recording regular (non-buzz) echolocation clicks with a linear hydrophone array. Dolphins clicked faster with decreasing distance to the array, reflecting a decreasing delay between the outgoing echolocation click and the returning array echo. However, for interclick intervals longer than 30 – 40 ms, <b>source</b> <b>levels</b> were not limited by the repetition rate. Thus, pneumatic constraints in the sound-production apparatus cannot account for <b>source</b> <b>level</b> adjustments to range as a possible automatic gain control mechanism for target ranges longer than a few body lengths of the dolphin. <b>Source</b> <b>level</b> estimates drop with reducing range between the echolocating dolphins and the target as a function of 17 log(R).

Using time difference of arrival and least-squares hyperbolic methods, the range and location of calling whales were determined. By using received level of calls and propagation modeling, call <b>source</b> <b>levels</b> of both subspecies were estimated.
