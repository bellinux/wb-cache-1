50|$|Rutherford {{discovered}} nitrogen by {{the isolation}} of the particle in 1772. When Joseph Black was studying the properties of carbon dioxide, he found that a candle would not burn in it. Black turned this problem over to his student at the time, Rutherford. Rutherford kept a mouse in a space with a confined quantity of air until it died. Then, he burned a candle in the remaining air until it went out. Afterwards, he burned phosphorus in that, until it would not burn. Then the air was passed through a carbon dioxide <b>absorbing</b> <b>solution.</b> The remaining component of the air did not support combustion, and a mouse could not live in it.|$|E

Samples masses up to 500 mg were combusted in closed vessels using 20 bar of oxygen. Combustion was complete in less than 30 s and analytes were absorbed in diluted (NH 4) 2 CO 3 solution. Accuracy was evaluated using certified reference materials with similar matrix composition and comparison with results obtained using ICP-MS. The agreement was better than 98 % using 50 mmol L- 1 (NH 4) 2 CO 3 as <b>absorbing</b> <b>solution</b> and 5 min of reflux. Temperature during combustion was higher than 1400 ºC and the residual carbon content in digest obtained after MIC was lower than 1 %.

40|$|Surfactants in the {{atmosphere}} may act as cloud condensation nuclei, with a potentially {{negative impact on the}} global climate. Therefore, accurate determination of surfactants is crucial in order to investigate the possible effects of surfactants on {{the atmosphere}}. The aim {{of this study was to}} identify the optimum sampling method for measuring the maximum quantity of surfactants present in ambient air. Air samples were collected using a range of air sampling pumps that were made to vary in terms of flow rate, storage period, type of <b>absorbing</b> <b>solution</b> and the characteristics of the impinger tube. Samples obtained were analysed by colourimetry for anionic and cationic surfactants as methylene blue-active substances (MBAS) and disulphine blue-active substances (DBAS), respectively. Absorbance was measured at 650 nm for MBAS and 628 nm for DBAS using UV-visible spectrophotometer. We found that the optimum sampling method consisted of an absorbent solution (deionised water, buffer solution and methylene blue/disulphine blue solution) with the flow rate of 1. 0 L/min. The concentration of surfactants in all sampling methods remained constant regardless of the storage period (1 day and 4 days), indicating that surfactants in the <b>absorbing</b> <b>solution</b> are quite stable. Covering the impinger tube was shown to influence the amount of both anionic and cationic surfactants detected...|$|E

The method {{is based on the}} reaction of hydrogen sulphide with iodine to form iodide and after the extraction of unreacted iodine, the iodide was oxidised to iodate by bromine. After the removal of excess bromine, the generated iodate is utilised to oxidise hydroxylamine to nitrite which produces an azo dye in the presence of p-nitroaniline and N-(1 -naphthyl) ethylenediamine dihydrochloride [NEDA] in acidic medium with maximum absorption at 545 nm. The colour system obeys Beer's law over the concentration range 0 - 3 ?m of H 2 S (n= 10).

Before syngas is bubbled into the <b>absorbing</b> <b>solutions,</b> a quartz thimble filter is used to filter ash from the gas stream at 450 °C followed by heavy tar removal at about 100 °C. When gasifying corn, good precision was observed for multiple samples collected on any given day of testing. Tests on producer gas obtained from gasification of switchgrass revealed important conditions for successfully sampling NH 3. During gasification of switchgrass, high solids loading in the syngas caused the primary cyclone at the gasifier exit to plug, resulting in abnormally high ash loading in the thimble filter in the sampling system. While gasifying the switchgrass, the NH 3 levels showed a continuous decline throughout the day.

40|$|Dynamic light {{scattering}} (DLS) {{is a powerful}} tool for the characterization of polymers, biomolecules and other macromolecules. It is a rapid, non-invasive technique which can be applied to in situ analyses. However, the difficulty and the complexity of acquisition and interpretation of {{light scattering}} data from polymeric and colloidal <b>solutions</b> that <b>absorb</b> light typically restrict the application of DLS to transparent colorless solutions. This restriction excludes many important classes of analytes e. g. light absorbing proteins, conducting polymers and nanotubes. The autocorrelation functions obtained from the DLS of light <b>absorbing</b> <b>solutions</b> show oscillation which is not observed in homodyne DLS of non-light absorbing samples. The oscillation was attributed to the absorbed light which is dissipated as heat causing a cascade of heating effects including thermal gradient, thermal blooming, density and viscosity decrease, refractive index change and convection. ^ The phenomenon was studied using model solutions consisting of non-light absorbing scatterers where the optical density was independently changed by the incorporation of a light absorbing dye. The oscillatory autocorrelation functions previously observed in light absorbing mixtures e. g. polyaniline, cytochrome c/cytochrome c peroxidase, and gold clusters are reproduced in the light <b>absorbing</b> model <b>solutions</b> containing bimodal-sized scatterers. ^ No oscillation was observed from light <b>absorbing</b> <b>solutions</b> of monodispersed scatterers.

The time evolution of the diffracted intensity was monitored from picosecond to millisecond time scales. The diffracted signal originates essentially from two density phase gratings: one in the absorbing phase induced by thermal expansion {{and one in the}} transparent solvent due to electrostriction. A few nanoseconds after excitation, the latter grating is replaced by a thermal grating due to thermal diffusion from the absorbing phase. The speed of sound and the acoustic attenuation measured near the interface are found to be essentially the same as in the bulk solutions. However, after addition of a surfactant in the polar phase, the speed of sound near the interface differs substantially from that in the bulk with the same surfactant concentration.

40|$|Two basic {{techniques}} {{are used to}} liberate sulfite from the sample matrix. The first is based on distillation of sulfur dioxide from an acidified aqueous suspension of the product in an <b>absorbing</b> <b>solution.</b> The second {{is based on the}} extraction of sulfite from the sample with water or alkali. The most commonly used of the distillation techniques is the Monier-Williams method, where the sulfur dioxide evolved by acidification is displaced by a stream of inert gas into hydrogen peroxide to convert it to sulfuric acid which is quantitated by titration with base. However, the need for a more rapid and sensitive assay for sulfite has led to considerable effort in searching for suitable alternatives. Methods involving jodometric titration after steam distillation, colorimetry with p-rosaniline, polarography or ion chromatography are described. After direct extraction of sulfite, ion chromatography, flow injection analysis, enzymatic determination and gas-liquid chromatograph have recently been proposed.

The main working conditions have been determined by mean of partial exergetic analysis. A sensitivity analysis {{with respect to the}} CO 2 <b>absorbing</b> <b>solution</b> composition has also been carried out. The reachable efficiency ranges between 35 % and 36 %, depending on gas turbine technology level. In comparison with efficiency values previously found for an IGCC fed with coal with upstream CO 2 chemical absorption (38 – 39 %), the configuration studied seems to be attractive because of the possibility of operating with a simplified scheme (without H 2 S removal process) and at atmospheric pressure and for the possibility of using biomass in a more efficient way with respect to conventional combustion systems. Due to the lower efficiency, the specific CO 2 emission results higher (170 kg/MW h) with respect to the cycle fed with coal and CO 2 removal (130 kg/MW h). Moreover, the CO 2 balance has been determined with respect to the entire life cycle of the plant, including the construction, operation, dismantling and the biomass growing phases. # 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|We {{describe}} {{the positive effect of}} surface plasmon-coupled fluorescence emission (SPCE) on {{the detection of}} a signal from a surface immunoassay in highly absorbing or/and scattering samples. A model immunoassay using fluorescently labeled anti-rabbit antibodies that bind to rabbit immunoglobulin on a silver surface was performed, and the signal was detected in the presence of various highly absorbing and/or scattering solutions or suspensions, such as hemoglobin solution, plastic beads, and red blood cells. The results showed that a highly <b>absorbing</b> <b>solution</b> consisting of small molecules (dye, hemoglobin) attenuates the SPCE signal approximately 2 – 3 -fold. In contrast, suspensions with the same absorption containing large particles (large beads, red blood cell suspension) attenuate the SPCE signal only slightly, approximately 5 – 10 %. Also, a suspension of large undyed, highly scattering beads does not reduce the SPCE signal. The effects on the immunoassay signal of the sample background absorption and scattering, the size of the background particles, and the geometry of the experimental set-up are discussed.

This paper provides such a dataset based on absorption of gypsum solution by horizontal columns of relatively dry soil with an initially high exchangeable potassium ratio. Initial and boundary conditions are well defined. Water and cation concentration profiles measured after 200 and 400 min lay on single curves when graphed {{in terms of}} distance divided by the square root of time. Cation exchange occurred close to the intake surface and calcium derived from the gypsum was confined to a narrow band well behind the notional piston front that separates the <b>absorbed</b> <b>solution</b> from that originally present.

40|$|Micro or {{miniature}} {{devices have}} been developed for flow analysis to obtain excellent performance. Some kinds of devices that we have developed are discussed in this paper. One of the advantages of miniaturization is a small reagent consumption and a field affordable size for “environmentally-friendly environmental analysis”. The miniature device is better for not only the operational usefulness, but also for the performance of the instrument. For example, a perfect collection efficiency is obtained in an electrochemical detection system microfabricated in a thin-layered wall-jet cell, and incubation is not needed in an enzyme-immobilized capillary cell. A small heat capacity is necessary for thermal detection, and a high-performance thermal sensor for flow enthalpimetry has been developed using a small stainless steel capillary. A gas diffusion scrubber has also been miniaturized so as to be placed into a flow system. The small diffusion scrubber has a large surface-to-volume ratio so that the sample gas is highly accumulated into the <b>absorbing</b> <b>solution.</b> The solution volume of the diffusion scrubber is same as that of the sample loop of FIA-sample-injector, and the scrubber is suited for being combined with the conventional flow injection system.

Mobile monitoring was performed along traffic roads, and elevated HCHO levels in a street canyon were evident upon mapping of the obtained data. The system was also applied to stationary monitoring in a forest in which HCHO formed naturally via reaction of biogenic compounds with oxidants.
