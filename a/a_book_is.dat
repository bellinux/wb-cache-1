25|$|Typically, {{the first}} step in saving and {{preserving}} <b>a</b> <b>book</b> <b>is</b> its deconstruction. The text pages need to be separated from the covers and, only if necessary, the stitching removed. This is done as delicately as possible. All page restoration is done at this point, be it the removal of foxing, ink stains, page tears, etc. Various techniques are employed to repair the various types of page damage that might have occurred during the life of the book.|$|E

25|$|Ophélie, reading <b>a</b> <b>book,</b> <b>is</b> {{concerned}} at Hamlet's new indifference. Hamlet {{appears in the}} distance, but leaves without speaking. The Queen enters. Ophélie says {{she would like to}} leave the court, but the Queen insists she should stay. Ophélie leaves the garden and King Claudius enters. Gertrude suspects that Hamlet now knows about the murder of his father, but Claudius says he does not. Hamlet enters and feigns madness. He rejects all overtures of friendship from Claudius, then announces he has engaged a troupe of actors to perform a play that evening. Claudius and Gertrude leave, and the players enter. Hamlet asks them to mime the play The Murder of Gonzago and then sings a drinking song, playing the fool, so as not to arouse suspicion.|$|E

During the choral section of the song, the images are of lights moving against a black background, followed by images of two overlapping blue circles, {{in the style of the}} Kikuuiki album cover artwork. After the third musical change, the video depicts objects on a pale background again. <b>A</b> <b>book</b> <b>is</b> shown being turned upside down, and the direction of the video changes from moving downwards to upwards.

25|$|For him {{science was}} {{the means of}} exposing the immortal nucleus of the human soul. In the days of his full {{strength}} it furnished him recreation and, by the prospects which it opened up to him, gave consolation. Toward {{the end of his}} life it brought him confidence. Gauss' God was not a cold and distant figment of metaphysics, nor a distorted caricature of embittered theology. To man is not vouchsafed that fullness of knowledge which would warrant his arrogantly holding that his blurred vision is the full light and that there can be none other which might report truth as does his. For Gauss, not he who mumbles his creed, but he who lives it, is accepted. He believed that a life worthily spent here on earth is the best, the only, preparation for heaven. Religion is not a question of literature, but of life. God's revelation is continuous, not contained in tablets of stone or sacred parchment. <b>A</b> <b>book</b> <b>is</b> inspired when it inspires. The unshakeable idea of personal continuance after death, the firm belief in a last regulator of things, in an eternal, just, omniscient, omnipotent God, formed the basis of his religious life, which harmonized completely with his scientific research.|$|E
25|$|The {{following}} day, Poirot is {{contacted by}} Maude Williams, who had approached {{him a few}} days earlier, telling him that she had known Bentley when they worked together briefly for the same estate agents. She told Poirot that she liked Bentley and did not believe he was guilty or even capable of murdering Mrs McGinty. She now offers to help Poirot who takes up her offer by getting her to pose as a maid {{in the house of}} Mrs Wetherby, a resident in the village for whom Mrs McGinty worked as housekeeper, and whose daughter, Deirdre, Poirot suspects may have some connection with the circumstances surrounding Mrs McGinty's murder. During the maid's night off, Mrs Upward's son Robin, a somewhat flamboyant theatre director, and Ariadne Oliver, a famed mystery novelist who has been working on a theatre adaptation with Robin, leave for an evening at the theatre, leaving Mrs Upward alone at the house. When they return, they find Mrs Upward strangled to death. She has evidently had coffee with her murderer, and the lipstick on a coffee cup and perfume in the air points to a woman having committed the crime. Mrs Upward had invited three people to her house that night: Eve Carpenter, Deirdre Henderson and Shelagh Rendell. Any of the three women could be someone from the photographs. Additionally, the postmistress's assistant, Edna, saw someone with blonde hair enter the house, which points to either Carpenter or Rendell, as Henderson is not blonde. Confusing matters even further is the fact that <b>a</b> <b>book</b> <b>is</b> discovered in the Upward house with Evelyn Hope's signature written on the flyleaf, suggesting Mrs Upward was actually Eva Kane. Poirot connects the final piece of the puzzle when he finds the photo Mrs McGinty saw at Maureen Summerhayes' house. It is of Eva Kane and has the inscription “my mother” on the back. Poirot gathers the suspects together and reveals the murderer – Robin Upward.|$|E

500|$|His {{treatment}} of Mars {{in this book}} was brief, and in 1907, Wallace returned to the subject with <b>a</b> <b>book</b> <b>Is</b> Mars Habitable? to criticise the claims made by Percival Lowell that there were Martian canals built by intelligent beings. Wallace did months of research, consulted various experts, and produced his own scientific analysis of the Martian climate and atmospheric conditions. Among other things, Wallace pointed out that spectroscopic analysis had shown no signs of water vapour in the Martian atmosphere, that Lowell's analysis of Mars's climate was seriously flawed and badly overestimated the surface temperature, and that low atmospheric pressure would make liquid water, let alone a planet-girding irrigation system, impossible. Richard Milner comments: [...] "It was the brilliant and eccentric evolutionist Alfred Russel Wallace... who effectively debunked Lowell's illusionary network of Martian canals." [...] Wallace originally {{became interested in the}} topic because his anthropocentric philosophy inclined him to believe that man would likely be unique in the universe.|$|E

500|$|Every two-page book {{embedding}} is {{a special}} case of a planar embedding, because the union of two pages of <b>a</b> <b>book</b> <b>is</b> a space topologically equivalent to the whole plane. Therefore, every graph with book thickness two is automatically a planar graph. More precisely, the book thickness of a graph [...] is at most two {{if and only if}} [...] is a subgraph of a planar graph that has a Hamiltonian cycle. If a graph is given a two-page embedding, it can be augmented to a planar Hamiltonian graph by adding (into any page) extra edges between any two consecutive vertices along the spine that are not already adjacent, and between the first and last spine vertices. The Goldner–Harary graph provides an example of a planar graph that does not have book thickness two: it is a maximal planar graph, so {{it is not possible to}} add any edges to it while preserving planarity, and it does not have a Hamiltonian cycle. Because of this characterization by Hamiltonian cycles, graphs that have two-page book embeddings are also known as subhamiltonian graphs.|$|E
