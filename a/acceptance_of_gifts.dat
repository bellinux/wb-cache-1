5|$|Osbert fitzHervey (died 1206) was an Anglo-Norman royal judge. Brother of Hubert Walter and Theobald Walter, Osbert served three {{kings of}} England {{and may have}} contributed to the legal {{treatise}} attributed to his uncle, Ranulf de Glanvill. Ralph of Coggeshall, a medieval writer, praised Osbert's knowledge of law, but condemned his <b>acceptance</b> <b>of</b> <b>gifts</b> from plaintiffs and defendants in legal cases. Osbert was one of a group of men who are considered the first signs of a professional judiciary in England.|$|E
25|$|It {{has been}} claimed that Boys had one meeting with Napoleon {{though there is}} no {{documentary}} evidence of it having taken place. When Cipriani, Napoleon's major-domo died, Boys and his junior chaplain buried the man, a Catholic, according to the rites of the Protestant Church. Napoleon was astonished when he heard of it, and said a priest would not have done so much for a Protestant. As a token of appreciation of their conduct Napoleon desired to give the two chaplains a present. A snuffbox was purchased in Jamestown and offered to Boys, but was refused owing to the severe penalties attached to any <b>acceptance</b> <b>of</b> <b>gifts</b> from the exile.|$|E

40|$|Patients {{and their}} parents often want to express their {{gratitude}} by giving a gift. The most common method of doing so is flowers, chocolates, bottles of wine, biscuits, cards, or monetary donations.

50|$|There are {{multiple}} boundaries {{that could be}} crossed between a client and a counselor, including physical, psychological, emotional, and social boundaries. Some of these boundary lines may be blurry. For example, there are differing opinions on whether touch is ever appropriate between a counselor and their client.

Dual relationships, where a counselor holds two or more different roles within a client’s life at the same time, are also typically avoided, {{as well as the}} <b>acceptance</b> <b>of</b> <b>gifts</b> of significant monetary value.|$|E

Partum and Rajkowska, by questioning spatial environments and offering them as a gift, invite participation and reconciliation. Their acts of giving foster reciprocity that in turn generate hospitable and generous responses. Their interventions open up spaces for communal belonging...|$|R

50|$|The Daily {{has won the}} Associated Collegiate Press' Pacemaker Award — {{considered}} {{by some to be}} the Pulitzer Prize of college journalism — five times, in 1989, 1994, 1995, 2004 and 2011. In 1993-94, The Daily was lauded for its investigative journalism that uncovered administrators' <b>acceptance</b> <b>of</b> <b>gifts</b> from university vendors and the university's subsequent attempts to conceal the improprieties from the public. The stories and the attention they garnered off campus helped precipitate the resignation of university President Richard Van Horn. In 1995, the newspaper aggressively and poignantly covered the bombing of the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building in nearby Oklahoma City. The Daily's website — rushed from concept to reality that year — became a national resource for news about the bombing, years before most news organizations were even online.|$|E
50|$|Agaja rebuilt Abomey {{and when}} he conquered Whydah the next year he {{provided}} many gifts to the King of Oyo. Despite these gifts, tributary terms acceptable to Oyo were not agreed to and so the Oyo Empire returned on March 22, 1728. As part of a strategy, Agaja buried his treasure, burned food resources, and made all the residents of Abomey abandon the city. The Oyo army {{found it difficult to}} remain in that situation and so they returned to Oyo in April. This strategy was repeated in 1729 and 1730, with Oyo sending increasingly larger armies and Agaja and his troops retreating into the marshes. The 1730 invasion was particularly devastating as the Oyo feigned <b>acceptance</b> <b>of</b> <b>gifts</b> from Agaja but then ambushed Dahomey's forces when they returned to Abomey. With the regular destruction of Abomey, Agaja moved the capital to Allada and ruled from there (his son Tegbessou would later move the capital back to Abomey while appointing a puppet king in Allada).|$|E
5000|$|Whereas the Puritans {{had held}} that {{assurance}} is rare, late and {{the fruit of}} struggle {{in the experience of}} believers, the Evangelicals believed it to be general, normally given at conversion and the result <b>of</b> simple <b>acceptance</b> <b>of</b> the <b>gift</b> <b>of</b> God. The consequence of the altered form of the doctrine was a metamorphosis in the nature of popular Protestantism. There was a change in patterns of piety, affecting devotional and practical life in all its departments. The shift, in fact, was responsible for creating in Evangelicalism a new movement and not merely a variation on themes heard since the Reformation.|$|R
