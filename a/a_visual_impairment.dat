25|$|The {{interpretation}} of facial expressions and mouthing {{can be difficult}} to understand when an individual has <b>a</b> <b>visual</b> <b>impairment.</b> Such problems hinder the ability of people to understand stimuli and translate information pertaining to perception with their brain for analysis. Non-verbal communication is important in effective communication and elders with vision loss are more likely to misinterpret or read the other person's actions in a wrong way. Visual impairments also cause a loss in positive perceptions of the environment around them. This can lead to isolation and possible depression in elderly people. Macular degeneration is a common cause of vision loss in elderly people. It diminishes the macula of the eye, which is responsible for clear vision. It causes progressive loss of central vision and possible loss of colour vision. This degeneration is caused by systemic changes in the circulation of waste products and growth of abnormal vessels around the retina causing the photoreceptors not to receive proper images. Though ageing almost always causes this, other possible effects and risk factors include smoking, obesity, family history and excessive sunlight exposure.|$|E

40|$|Orientation of <b>a</b> {{person with}} <b>visual</b> <b>impairment</b> is <b>a</b> process of using all senses to {{establish}} ones spatial position (Hill, 1986).

40|$|Leber’s {{hereditary}} optic neuroretinopathy (LHON) {{is manifested}} as a bilateral acute or subacute loss of central vision due to optic atrophy. It {{is linked to}} point mutations of mitochondrial DNA, which is inherited maternally. The most common mitochondrial DNA point mutations associated with LHON are G 3460 A, G 11778 A and T 14484 C. These mutations are linked with the defects of subunits of the complex I (NADH-dehydrogenase-ubiquinone reductase) in mitochondria.

[...] The first is for club level competitions, the second for state and national competitions, and the third for international competitions. While a skier is first classified by their national Paralympic committee, their international classification may take place during their first World Cup event.

Many <b>visual</b> <b>impairments,</b> like cataract and reduced acuity of vision, are more frequent among the elderly.

40|$|AbstractSpatial mental mapping in <b>an</b> {{individual}} with <b>visual</b> <b>impairment</b> {{can be viewed}} from several perspectives, {{as in the case}} of a person regarded as a bio-psycho-socio-spiritual being. We speak of mental/cognitive mapping in terms of training spatial orientation and mobility on the one hand and psychology of persons with <b>visual</b> <b>impairment,</b> i. e. the process of development of a mental map, on the other hand. An important role is undoubtedly played by lower and higher compensatory functions. Hearing, touch, and partly also smell and taste are, together with mental processes, involved in perception of information, its processing and evaluation. Information perceived through sensorial channels is processed by means of mental processes. In the context of conscious processes, perception and imagination are integral parts of research on consciousness.
