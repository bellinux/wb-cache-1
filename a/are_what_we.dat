25|$|Contemporary with Hume, but {{critical}} of Hume's scepticism, a so-called Scottish school of Common Sense formed, whose basic principle was enunciated by its founder and greatest figure, Thomas Reid:If {{there are certain}} principles, as I think there are, which the constitution of our nature leads us to believe, and which we are under a necessity {{to take for granted}} in the common concerns of life, without being able to give a reason for them — these <b>are</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> call the principles of common sense; and what is manifestly contrary to them, is what we call absurd.|$|E
25|$|The {{organization}} {{evolved from}} a community mural workshop in which the participants designed and painted the portable mural “Masks of God, Soul of Man” for the Bernal Heights Library. The group signed the piece as Precita Eyes Muralists because the project was a collaborative effort. The name of the organization {{comes from the fact}} that most of the muralists were from Precita Valley. Precita is a diminutive form of the Spanish word ‘presa,’ which means dam; the word ‘Precita’ means little dam. The ‘Eyes’ in the name <b>are</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> perceive the visual world with, our own eyes.|$|E

500|$|Read by all ages, The Perks of Being a Wallflower is {{targeted}} at a teenage audience. The book addresses {{a range of}} themes dispassionately. These themes include drugs, friendship, body image, first love, suicide, eating disorders and sexuality. Chbosky appreciates the importance of entertainment in adolescence: [...] "Books, songs, and movies are more than entertainment when we're young. They help all of us discover who we <b>are,</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> believe, and what we hope our life can be." [...] As such, the book contains several cultural references across all mediums: musically the book references The Smiths and Fleetwood Mac, literarily the book references This Side of Paradise, On the Road, To Kill a Mockingbird and theatrically the book references The Rocky Horror Picture Show.|$|E
500|$|Altdorfer was {{not only}} a pioneer of landscape, but also a {{practitioner}} of early incarnations of the Romanticism and expressionism which impacted the arts so greatly in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. Kenneth Clark writes of Altdorfer and contemporaries Grünewald and Bosch, [...] "They <b>are</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> now call 'expressionist' artists, a term which is not as worthless as it sounds, because, in fact, the symbols of expressionism are remarkably consistent, and we find in the work of these early 16th-century landscape painters not only the same spirit but the same shapes and iconographical motives which recur in the work of such recent expressionists as van Gogh, Max Ernst, Graham Sutherland and Walt Disney." [...] According to art critic Pia F. Cuneo, [...] "Altdorfer's construction of landscape on a cosmic scale" [...] in the Battle of Alexander at Issus, and his [...] "spiritual and aesthetic affinities with Romanticism and Modern art (in particular, German Expressionism)", [...] "have been especially singled out for praise".|$|E
500|$|Mother Night, {{published}} in 1961, received little {{attention at the}} time of its publication. Howard W. Campbell Jr., Vonnegut's protagonist, is an American who goes to Nazi Germany during the war as a double agent for the U.S. Office of Strategic Services, and rises to the regime's highest ranks as a radio propagandist. After the war, the spy agency refuses to clear his name and he is eventually imprisoned by the Israelis in the same cell block as Adolf Eichmann, and later commits suicide. Vonnegut wrote in a foreword to a later edition, [...] "we <b>are</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> pretend to be, so we must be careful about what we pretend to be". Literary critic Lawrence Berkove considered the novel, like Mark Twain's Adventures of Huckleberry Finn, to illustrate the tendency for [...] "impersonators to get carried away by their impersonations, to become what they impersonate and therefore to live in a world of illusion".|$|E

500|$|My Dinosaur Life was {{released}} to acclaim from music critics upon its debut on January 19, 2010, and it represented the band's all-time best chart performance, peaking at number 15 on the Billboard 200. The group supported Weezer on several dates during this time, {{and they began}} a headlining tour in late January in the US. In {{the first three months}} following the album's release, the band continued to tour heavily: they travelled to Australia for the national Soundwave festival, as well as to Japan and the UK. The band began to receive radio airplay {{for the first time in}} their career, and released a music video for the single [...] "Her Words Destroyed My Planet". They embarked on a large tour with Say Anything between October and November 2010, and premiered a self-shot video for [...] "A Lifeless Ordinary" [...] during that time. Columbia dropped the band later that year, with the commercial performance of My Dinosaur Life leading to the split. [...] "I guess we didn't do as well as they hoped or expected us to," [...] said Pierre that year.

2500|$|Bikel's close {{friendship}} with Seeger was sometimes tested {{as a result}} of the festival's choice of performers. On one occasion, Seeger became infuriated and wished he had an ax to cut the electrical cables because of the poor audio during Bob Dylan's legendary performance accompanied by the Paul Butterfield Blues Band. Seeger expected Bikel to support him: [...] "Theo, for Chrissake—tell them. Set them straight!" [...] Bikel stepped forward and told Seeger, [...] "Peter, this band, these rebels—they are us. They <b>are</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> were twenty years ago. Remember?" [...] Seeger stared at him [...] "like a trauma victim", as Bikel succeeded in calming Seeger down enough to let the group finish their songs. In 1965, Bikel, as well as Seeger, was shocked when Bob Dylan turned electric at the Festival, an event some call [...] "Dylan's declaration of musical independence." ...|$|E
