5|$|In 1953, a {{new process}} based on GTAW was developed, called plasma arc welding. It affords greater control and {{improves}} weld quality by using <b>a</b> <b>nozzle</b> {{to focus the}} electric arc, but is largely limited to automated systems, whereas GTAW remains primarily a manual, hand-held method. Development within the GTAW process has continued as well, and today a number of variations exist. Among the most popular are the pulsed-current, manual programmed, hot-wire, dabber, and increased penetration GTAW methods.|$|E
5|$|Further {{improvements}} {{were introduced}} throughout the Merlin range: 1943 saw {{the introduction of}} a Bendix-Stromberg pressure carburettor that injected fuel at 5 pounds per square inch (34kPa; 0.34 bar) through <b>a</b> <b>nozzle</b> directly into the supercharger, and was fitted to Merlin 66, 70, 76, 77 and 85 variants. The final development, which was fitted to the 100-series Merlins, was an S.U. injection carburettor that injected fuel into the supercharger using a fuel pump driven as a function of crankshaft speed and engine pressures.|$|E
5|$|The {{aviation}} industry {{had been studying}} this problem for some time. From the mid-1940s, there was much interest in using nuclear-powered aircraft in the bomber role. In a conventional jet engine, thrust is provided by heating air using jet fuel and accelerating it out <b>a</b> <b>nozzle.</b> In a nuclear engine, heat is supplied by a reactor, whose consumables last for months instead of hours. Most designs also carried {{a small amount of}} jet fuel for use during high-power portions of flight—take-off and high-speed dashes.|$|E

25|$|Later {{research}} into airflows near {{or above the}} speed of sound used a related approach. Metal pressure chambers were used to store high-pressure air which was then accelerated through <b>a</b> <b>nozzle</b> designed to provide supersonic flow. The observation or instrumentation chamber ("test section") was then placed at the proper location in the throat or nozzle for the desired airspeed.|$|E
25|$|A {{significant}} {{feature of}} the Cauchy equation and consequently all other continuum equations (including Euler and Navier–Stokes) {{is the presence of}} convective acceleration: the effect of acceleration of a flow with respect to space. While individual fluid particles indeed experience time-dependent acceleration, the convective acceleration of the flow field is a spatial effect, one example being fluid speeding up in <b>a</b> <b>nozzle.</b>|$|E
40|$|<b>A</b> plug <b>nozzle</b> {{has been}} studied as <b>a</b> {{promising}} <b>nozzle</b> from <b>a</b> viewpoint of improving thrust efficiency for rocket or space plane. In the field of mechanical engineering, supersonic jets from a Laval or <b>a</b> conical <b>nozzle</b> are frequentlry used as a cleaning tool, cooling tool, mixing tool, etc. The plug nozzle also has possibility applicable {{to the field of}} mechanical engineering as well, however, the jet structure of the plug nozzle is now well known. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to clarify the structure of jets from <b>a</b> plug <b>nozzle</b> by solving Euler equations numerically. The jet flowfield is computed for an axisymmetric plug with a design Mach number 2. 0, and the velocity distributions on jet center line are obtained for the over, correct and underexpanded supersonic jets. The structures of the jets issuing from <b>a</b> plug <b>nozzle</b> are highly complicated and are found to be quite different from the jets from <b>a</b> Laval <b>nozzle...</b>|$|R
50|$|For a ramjet {{operating}} at a subsonic flight Mach number, exhaust flow is accelerated through <b>a</b> converging <b>nozzle.</b> For <b>a</b> supersonic flight Mach number, acceleration is typically achieved via <b>a</b> convergent-divergent <b>nozzle.</b>|$|R

25|$|Also, {{the mining}} {{establishment}} of Delamar Ghost Town, Nevada was ruined by a dry-mining process {{that produced a}} silicosis-causing dust. After hundreds of deaths from silicosis, the town was nicknamed The Widowmaker. The problem {{in those days was}} somewhat resolved with an addition of <b>a</b> <b>nozzle</b> to the drill which sprayed a mist of water, turning dust raised by drilling into mud, but this inhibited mining work.|$|E
25|$|A {{leaf blower}} is a {{gardening}} tool that propels {{air out of}} <b>a</b> <b>nozzle</b> to move yard debris such as leaves. Leaf blowers are usually powered by two-stroke engine or an electric motor, but four-stroke engines were recently introduced to partially address air pollution concerns. Leaf blowers are typically self-contained handheld units, or backpack mounted units with a handheld wand. The leaf blower was invented by Dom Quinto in 1950.|$|E
25|$|An {{oil burner}} is a heating device which burns fuel oil. The oil is {{directed}} under pressure through <b>a</b> <b>nozzle</b> {{to produce a}} fine spray, which is usually ignited by an electric spark with the air being forced through by an electric fan. In 1880, Amanda Jones invented the oil burner in the oil fields of northern Pennsylvania where Jones completed her trial and error efforts of heating furnaces.|$|E
40|$|The {{proximity}} of the ground to <b>an</b> annular <b>nozzle</b> can result in thrust augmentation of up to 50 percent. The magnitude of thrust augmentation was a function of ground-to-nozzle distance, nozzle configuration, and nozzle pressure ratio. With <b>a</b> conventional circular <b>nozzle</b> <b>a</b> thrust reduction of 15 to 40 percent due to ground effect was obtained. The degree of thrust reduction was primarily <b>a</b> function of <b>nozzle</b> pressure ratio and ground-to-nozzle distance...|$|R

25|$|Rockets {{consist of}} a {{propellant}}, {{a place to put}} propellant (such as a propellant tank), and <b>a</b> <b>nozzle.</b> They may also have one or more rocket engines, directional stabilization device(s) (such as fins, vernier engines or engine gimbals for thrust vectoring, gyroscopes) and a structure (typically monocoque) to hold these components together. Rockets intended for high speed atmospheric use also have an aerodynamic fairing such as a nose cone, which usually holds the payload.|$|E
25|$|In 1961, a new bus design, the Hamburg, was {{unveiled}} at the Geneva Motor Show. At {{a time when}} most coaches were rounded, bulbous or streamlined, the new design had clear-cut lines with edges and large windows. Developed by the founder's eldest son, Albrecht Auwärter, and another student, Swiss national Bob Lee, as part of their dissertation at Hamburg University. The design also allowed every passenger to regulate their fresh air supply through <b>a</b> <b>nozzle</b> from two air ducts, commonly seen today.|$|E
25|$|Ambient air, of course, was the {{original}} machining coolant. Compressed air, supplied through pipes and hoses from an air compressor and discharged from <b>a</b> <b>nozzle</b> aimed at the tool, is sometimes a useful coolant. The force of the decompressing air stream blows chips away, and the decompression itself has a slight degree of cooling action. The net {{result is that the}} heat of the machining cut is carried away a bit better than by ambient air alone. Sometimes liquids are added to the air stream to form a mist (mist coolant systems, described above).|$|E

40|$|Applied {{research}} and testing {{has been conducted}} at the Cal Poly San Luis Obispo High-pressure Blow-Down facility to study the affects of throttling in <b>a</b> thrust-vectored aerospike <b>nozzle.</b> This study supports the ongoing research at Cal Poly to effectively thrust vector a hybrid rocket motor. Such thrust vectoring is achieved by small secondary ports in the nozzle body that are perpendicular to the main nozzle. The testing conducted included characterizing and comparing the performance of <b>a</b> straight aerospike <b>nozzle</b> to that of <b>a</b> thrust-vectored aerospike <b>nozzle.</b> Throttling effects on the aerospike <b>nozzle</b> in <b>an</b> unvectored and in a vectored configuration were also investigated. The interaction between throttling and thrust vectoring of <b>an</b> aerospike <b>nozzle</b> {{is the focus of}} this thesis research. This research shows that large-throat/high-thrust operation of <b>an</b> aerospike <b>nozzle</b> provides little thrust vector generation. Conversely, small-throat/low-thrust operation provides ample thrust vector generation. These results have implications in the effectiveness of thrust vectoring <b>an</b> aerospike <b>nozzle</b> with secondary ports. Rockets having <b>an</b> aerospike <b>nozzle</b> with throttling capabilities will be subject to the minimum and maximum turn angles for a given throttle position. As such, certain vehicle maneuvers might not be obtainable at certain throttle operations. Conversely, at lower throttling conditions, higher turn angles will be achievable...|$|R

25|$|One of {{the largest}} {{mechanical}} uses of dry ice is blast cleaning. Dry ice pellets are shot from <b>a</b> <b>nozzle</b> with compressed air, combining {{the power of the}} speed of the pellets with the action of the sublimation. This can remove residues from industrial equipment. Examples of materials removed include ink, glue, oil, paint, mold and rubber. Dry ice blasting can replace sandblasting, steam blasting, water blasting or solvent blasting. The primary environmental residue of dry ice blasting is the sublimed CO2, thus making it a useful technique where residues from other blasting techniques are undesirable. Recently, blast cleaning has been introduced as a method of removing smoke damage from structures after fires.|$|E
25|$|The full remedy {{was to use}} the Bendix-Stromberg {{pressure}} carburettor, {{which allowed}} more precise metering {{of the amount of}} fuel used by the engine and prevented fuel starvation. This new carburettor was used from the Merlin 66 series and on all Griffon engines. In these engines the carburettor injected fuel at 5 psi through <b>a</b> <b>nozzle</b> direct into the supercharger and the compressed air-fuel mixture was then directed to the cylinders. The final development was the SU injection carburettor, that injected fuel into the supercharger using a fuel pump driven as a function of crankshaft speed and engine pressures; although this was fitted to the 100 series Merlins, which were not used in production Spitfires, it was used in the Griffon 60 and 80 series.|$|E
25|$|Ramjet engines {{differ in}} many ways from {{traditional}} gas turbine engines, {{but most of the}} same principles hold. One major difference is the lack of rotating machinery (a turbine) after the combustor. The combustor exhaust is directly fed to <b>a</b> <b>nozzle.</b> This allows ramjet combustors to burn at a higher temperature. Another difference is that many ramjet combustors do not use liners like gas turbine combustors do. Furthermore, some ramjet combustors are dump combustors rather than a more conventional type. Dump combustors inject fuel and rely on recirculation generated by a large change in area in the combustor (rather than swirlers in many gas turbine combustors). That said, many ramjet combustors are also similar to traditional gas turbine combustors, such as the combustor in the ramjet used by the RIM-8 Talos missile, which used a can-type combustor.|$|E

40|$|High-speed motion {{pictures}} were taken of fuel sprays with the NACA spray-photographic apparatus {{to study the}} distribution of the liquid fuel from the instant of injection cut-off until about 0. 05 second later. The fuel was injected into a glass-walled chamber in which the air density was varied from 1 to 13 times atmospheric air density (0. 0765 to 0. 99 pound per cubic foot) and in which the air was at room temperature. The air in the chamber was set in motion by means of a fan, and was directed counter to the spray at velocities up to 27 feet per second. The injection pressure was varied from 2, 000 to 6, 000 pounds per square inch.

25|$|The local {{speed of}} sound, {{and thereby the}} Mach number, depends on the {{condition}} of the surrounding medium, in particular the temperature. The Mach number is primarily used to determine the approximation with which a flow can be treated as an incompressible flow. The medium can be a gas or a liquid. The boundary can be traveling in the medium, or it can be stationary while the medium flows along it, or they can both be moving, with different velocities: what matters is their relative velocity with respect to each other. The boundary can be the boundary of an object immersed in the medium, or of a channel such as <b>a</b> <b>nozzle,</b> diffusers or wind tunnels channeling the medium. As the Mach number is defined as the ratio of two speeds, it is a dimensionless number. If <nbsp&0.2–0.3 and the flow is quasi-steady and isothermal, compressibility effects will be small and simplified incompressible flow equations can be used.|$|E
25|$|A {{brand new}} Godzilla suit was {{designed}} for this film and some slight alterations were done to its overall appearance. These alterations included the removal of its tiny ears, three toes on each foot rather than four, enlarged central dorsal fins and a bulkier body. These new features gave Godzilla a more reptilian/dinosaurian appearance. Outside of the suit, a meter high model and a small puppet were also built. Another puppet (from the waist up) was also designed that had <b>a</b> <b>nozzle</b> in the mouth to spray out liquid mist simulating Godzilla's atomic breath. However the shots in the film where this prop was employed (far away shots of Godzilla breathing its atomic breath during its attack on the Arctic Military base) were ultimately cut from the film. These cut scenes {{can be seen in}} the Japanese theatrical trailer. Finally, a separate prop of Godzilla's tail was also built for close up practical shots when its tail would be used (such as the scene where Godzilla trips Kong with its tail). The tail prop would be swung offscreen by a stage hand.|$|E
25|$|Microdispensing {{was used}} to create micropatterns on {{polystyrene}} culture dishes by dispensing droplets of adhesive laminin and non-adhesive bovine serum albumin (BSA) solutions. The microdispenser is a piezoelectric element attached to a push-bar {{on top of a}} channel etched in silicon, which has one inlet at each end and <b>a</b> <b>nozzle</b> in the middle. The piezoelectric element expands when voltage is applied, causing liquid to be dispensed through the nozzle. The microdispenser is moved using a computer-controlled x-y table. The micropattern resolution depends on many factors: dispensed liquid viscosity, drop pitch (the distance between the centre of two adjacent droplets in a line or array), and the substrate. With increasing viscosity the lines become thinner, but if the liquid viscosity is too high the liquid cannot be expelled. Heating the solution creates more uniform protein lines. Although some droplet overlap is necessary to create continuous lines, uneven evaporation may cause uneven protein concentration along the lines; this can be prevented through smoother evaporation by modifying the dispensed solution properties.|$|E
