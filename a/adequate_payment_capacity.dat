40|$|The {{market prices}} of {{developing}} countries'debts are imperfect {{indicators of the}} countries'payment capacity for three reasons: the concave shape of the debt's payoff structure, the presence of third-party guarantees, and {{the differences in the}} terms of various debt claims. Claessens and Pennacchi derive an improved indicator of payment capacityby developing a pricing model - using option valuation techniques - that takes these three factors into account. Applying the model to bonds issued recently by Mexico and Venezuela, they find that the estimated indicator of <b>payment</b> <b>capacity</b> often behaves differently from the raw bond prices themselves, confirming the importance of cleaning the raw prices for these three factors. In order of importance, the benefits of cleaning raw prices come first from correcting for the effects of different terms (such as fixed versus floating interest rates), followed by the value of third-party enhancements and then by the concavity of the payoff structure. They find some evidence that the new indicator of repayment capacity conforms better than the raw prices themselves to generally held beliefs about which variables drive a country's repayment capacity. In particular, they find that variables that are often assumed to be related to <b>payment</b> <b>capacity</b> - such as oil prices and the countries'stock market prices - are more closely (and with the right sign) associated with the new estimated measure of <b>payment</b> <b>capacity</b> than are the secondary market prices of the bonds.

As a quasi market solution of the fiscal sustainability problem, these bonds should be acquired by the international financial institutions. This proposal is totally different from the well known Baker, Brady and other plans, since would permit decrease the probability of a debt crisis in the borrower countries as a consequence of their <b>payment</b> <b>capacity</b> affected by instability of their GDPs. If the indexed bonds acquired by the international financial institutions become part important of their total debt, and the duration of these issued bonds increases, the debt and current account sustainability of the borrower countries will be guaranteed for a long time. ...|$|R

The current study is part of a cross-cultural comparison and focuses on the perception and impact of perceived organizational justice within the Korean school system. What justice judgments are made, and are they able to significantly contribute to the prediction of job satisfaction besides the impact of established variables (like scope of action and <b>adequate</b> <b>payment)</b> ? The sample embraced 395 Korean female teachers. A newly constructed instrument for organizational justice (Müller, Kärcher & Kals) was translated into Korean. The other variables were also measured in the same way as in the German sample (Jiranek, 2009), the influence of socially desirable answering behaviour was equally controlled. Factor analyses were conducted. The internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha) as well as several split-half reliabilities were assessed as indices of the scales' reliability. Item statistics and scale statistics account for a reliable measurement of all psychological constructs. It could be shown that differentiated judgments on organizational justice are made by the teachers. Moreover, job satisfaction is based in the same way on justice perceptions (distributive justice, prodecural justice), trust in supervisor, as well as scope of action. <b>Adequate</b> <b>payment</b> and interactional justice, however, proved to be non-significant. This shows that there is significant overlap between the Korean and German data. Both data reflect that satisfaction with the job is based on value-oriented decisions of the supervisor and the management.

40|$|Testimony {{issued by}} the General Accounting Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "Congress implemented a physician fee schedule and a fee update formula to moderate spending growth relative to specified Medicare spending targets. These spending targets increase annually to reflect higher costs for physician services, {{the growth in the}} overall economy, and changes in the number of Medicare beneficiaries. Physician fees are adjusted for changes in the costs of providing services and on actual cumulative spending compared to the cumulative targets. Physician fees are updated to reflect higher costs to provide services. These updates are adjusted up or down on actual spending either falling below or exceeding the targets. In November 2001, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid announced that updating Medicare's fees will decline 5. 4 percent from what was paid in 2001, despite an estimated 2. 6 percent increase in the cost of physician inputs. This reduction accounts for historical cumulative spending that exceeded the target by $ 8. 9 billion, or 13 percent of estimated 2002 spending. Several factors contributed to the disparity between actual and targeted spending, including the correction of substantial errors in past spending estimates and the revision of targets for prior years. The current update mechanism could be modified to moderate fluctuations in physician fees and to ensure <b>adequate</b> <b>payments,</b> while retaining the fiscal discipline created by having a spending target. Such modifications would need to balance concerns about preserving fiscal discipline on physician spending with the need to maintain <b>adequate</b> <b>payment</b> rates to ensure that beneficiaries have access to physician services. Because the paramount consideration in setting payment rates is ensuring appropriate beneficiary access to services, timely and detailed data on Medicare beneficiary service use are essential to achieving this balance. ...|$|R

40|$|Adapting public {{policies}} on public utilities to collective {{expectations of the}} population has always been a challenge for both central and local public authorities in Romania. The present article aims to highlight issues of applicability limits of the theory of public choice. The general objective of this research is to prove that the practicability of public choice requires conditionality of financial affordability. In this regard we use a theoretical analysis on the possibility and conditions of use of the theory of public choice in practice and an empirical analysis based on statistical data which illustrates an up to date comparison of the <b>payment</b> <b>capacity</b> of the sanitation services, adapted to European standards, {{of the population of the}} four counties of the Western Region of Romania, Timis, Arad, Caras-Severin and Hunedoara. We considered relevant to our study official statistics on the age structure of the population, employment, unemployment, social assisted individuals, students and pensioners and the average income of all these categories. The analysis results indicate that there are major discrepancies of the <b>payment</b> <b>capacity</b> and financial endurance between the population of the four counties and that the substantiation of charging public services using the principles of public choice would be unsustainable financially for a large part of the population. After clarifying these issues, the main conclusion of the study is that public choice theory application using the majority’s autonomy is possible only through an association of financial affordability barriers. The relevance of the study is to address and propose solutions to the difficult context crossed by Romanian public authorities to find integrated solutions, so as to develop community services at European level, but at the same time to remain in the sphere of needs and payment possibilities of citizens...|$|R

In general, our empirical evidence suggests that external debt does not influence public investment over the period under study. At longer horizon, it is confirmed that the nature of poor domestic savings and investment causes higher debt service payments and crowd out available resources for investment in economic and social sectors.

40|$|Many {{countries}} have experienced restructuring in their electric utilities. This restructuring has presented the power industries with new challenges, {{the most important}} of which is long-term investment planning under uncertain conditions. This paper presents an improved mechanism for <b>capacity</b> <b>payment.</b> The mechanism has been investigated based on system dynamic modeling. In our proposed mechanism, generators will recover a part of their investment through <b>capacity</b> <b>payment.</b> While the payment for any plant remains constant during the operation period, it depends on the investment needed to build it.
