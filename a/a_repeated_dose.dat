Conversely, a Duke University animal study funded by the Sugar Association found evidence that doses of Splenda between 100 and 1000 mg/kg BW/day, containing sucralose at 1.1 to 11 mg/kg BW/day, fed to rats reduced fecal microflora, increased the pH level in the intestines, contributed to increases in body weight, and increased levels of P-glycoprotein (P-gp). These effects have not been reported in humans. In response, McNeil Nutritionals, along with an expert panel that included scientists from Duke University, Rutgers University, New York Medical College, Harvard School of Public Health, and Columbia University reported in Regulatory Toxicology and Pharmacology that the Duke study was [...] "not scientifically rigorous and is deficient in several critical areas that preclude reliable interpretation of the study results".

40|$|BACKGROUND: Infants born preterm are at {{high risk}} of {{neonatal}} lung disease and its sequelae. A single course of prenatal corticosteroids has not been shown to be of benefit in babies who are born more than seven days after treatment. It is not known whether there is benefit in <b>repeating</b> the <b>dose</b> of prenatal corticosteroids to women who remain at risk of preterm birth more than seven days after an initial course. OBJECTIVES: To assess the effectiveness and safety of <b>a</b> <b>repeat</b> <b>dose(s)</b> of prenatal corticosteroids, given to women who remain at risk of preterm birth seven or more days after an initial course of prenatal corticosteroids. SEARCH STRATEGY: We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group trials register (January 2003), the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register (The Cochrane Library, Issue 1, 2003), MEDLINE (1965 to January 2003), EMBASE (1988 to January 2003), Current Contents (1997 to January 2003). SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised controlled trials of women who have already received a single course of corticosteroid seven or more days previously, and who are still considered to be at risk of preterm birth; outcomes compared for women randomised to receive <b>a</b> <b>repeat</b> <b>dose(s)</b> of prenatal corticosteroids, with women given no further prenatal corticosteroids. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We assessed trial quality and extracted the data independently. MAIN RESULTS: Five hundred and fifty one women were recruited into the three included trials between 24 and 30 weeks' gestation. Fewer infants in the <b>repeat</b> <b>dose(s)</b> of corticosteroids group had severe lung disease compared with infants in the placebo group (relative risk (RR) 0. 64, 95 % confidence interval (CI) 0. 44 to 0. 93, 1 trial, 500 infants). No statistically significant differences were seen for any of the other primary outcomes that included other measures of respiratory morbidity, small-for-gestational-age at birth, perinatal death, periventricular haemorrhage, periventricular leucomalacia and maternal infectious morbidity. Fewer infants in the <b>repeat</b> <b>dose(s)</b> of corticosteroids group received surfactant compared with infants in the placebo group (RR 0. 64, 95 % CI 0. 44 to 0. 93, 2 trials, 537 infants). REVIEWER'S CONCLUSIONS: <b>Repeat</b> <b>dose(s)</b> of prenatal corticosteroids may reduce the severity of neonatal lung disease.

Different sets of sera were tested using the Ceditest® FMDV-NS ELISA for the detection of antibodies against non-structural proteins (NSPs) of FMD virus. During a vaccine safety study, serum samples were collected from 10 calves, 10 lambs and 10 piglets following administration of a double <b>dose</b> and <b>a</b> <b>repeat</b> <b>dose</b> of high payload trivalent Cedivac-FMD vaccine. All serum samples collected both 2 weeks following the administration of a double dose as well as those collected 2 weeks after the single dose booster (given 2 weeks after the double dose) were negative in the Ceditest® FMDV-NS ELISA. In a series of vaccine potency experiments, serum samples were collected from 70 vaccinated cattle prior to and following exposure to infectious, homologous FMD virus.

40|$|Activation of Nrf 2 /ARE {{signaling}} pathway occurs ubiquitously in most cell types upon induction of oxidative stress. Rotenone, an inhibitor of mitochondrial complex I, {{can be used}} to trigger oxidative stress, stimulate the activation of Nrf 2 pathway in neuronal and astrocytic cells and assess neurotoxicity. We have previously demonstrated that an acute treatment with rotenone can induce Nrf 2 activation, which leads to astrocyte activation and dopaminergic (DA) neuronal cell death in a mixed neuronal/astrocytic cell model derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs). In this study, we characterized the effects of <b>a</b> <b>repeated</b> <b>dose</b> treatment with rotenone (14 days) on hiPSC-derived neural stem cells (NSCs) undergoing differentiation, assessing the expression and the activation of the Nrf 2 pathway.

Altogether these data indicate that hiPSC-NSC models are relevant test systems for the evaluation of Nrf 2 pathway activation upon induced oxidative stress, allowing further understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying exposure to (developmental) neurotoxicants.

In all cases the breathing of the children settled rapidly, the examination and sedation proceeded in due course. We observed coughing in one case (0.37 %) in the second group. One small child was given antidote (flumazenil) after sedation since he was still not awake 2  hours after. This case {{was one of those}} where we did not give ketamine only midazolam. Nausea and vomiting occurred in 2 cases (0.74 %) after the examination. Waking was smooth, agitation occurred in 3 cases (1.11 %). Table  2 contains vital parameters and complications too. Children drank after 45 – 60  minutes and left the department within a few hours. Complications within 24  hours following discharge were unknown.|$|E
40|$|Antibiotic {{resistance}} to microorganisms {{is one of}} the major problems faced in the field of wound care in burns patients. Silver nanoparticles have come up as potent antimicrobial agent and are being evaluated in diverse medical applications ranging from silver based dressings to silver coated medical devices. We aimed in present study to test the release of nanosilver from nanosilver wound dressing and compare the dermal and systemic toxicity of nanosilver dressings in <b>a</b> <b>repeated</b> <b>dose</b> (21 days) model. Under general anesthesia, a limited standard 2 nd degree burns were provided on the back of each rat in all treatment, negative control (simple dressing) and 5 % silver nitrate groups, each contained 5 male wistar rats. According to the analysis made by atomic absorption spectrometry, the wound dressings released 0. 599 ± 0. 083 ppm of nanosilver during first 24 hrs of study. Daily observations were recoded and wounds were covered with new dressings each 24 hrs. Burn healing was observed in nanosilver wound dressing group in shorter time periods than the control groups. In toxicity assessment, this dressing didn't cause any hematological and histopathological abnormalities in treatment group but biochemical studies showed significant rise of plasma transaminase (ALT) at the endpoint (21 days) of the study (P= 0. 027). Portal mononuclear lymphoid and polymorphonuclear leukocyte infiltrations in three to four adjacent foci were recognized around the central hepatic vein in treatment group. Mild hepatotoxic effects of nanosilver wound dressing in wistar rat emphasize the necessity of more studies on toxicity potentials of low dose nanosilver by dermal applications...|$|E
40|$|Systemic {{repeated}} dose {{safety assessment}} and systemic efficacy evaluation of substances are currently {{carried out on}} laboratory animals and in humans {{due to the lack}} of predictive alternatives. Relevant international regulations, such as OECD and ICH guidelines, demand long-term testing and oral, dermal, inhalation, and systemic exposure routes for such evaluations. So-called “human-on-a-chip” concepts are aiming to replace respective animals and humans in substance evaluation with miniaturized functional human organisms. The major technical hurdle toward success in this field is the life-like combination of human barrier organ models, such as intestine, lung or skin, with parenchymal organ equivalents, such as liver, at the smallest biologically acceptable scale. Here, we report on a reproducible homeostatic long-term co-culture of human liver equivalents with either a reconstructed human intestinal barrier model or a human skin biopsy applying a microphysiological system. We used a multi-organ chip (MOC) platform, which provides pulsatile fluid flow within physiological ranges at low media-to-tissue ratios. The MOC supports submerse cultivation of an intact intestinal barrier model and an air–liquid interface for the skin model during their co-culture with the liver equivalents respectively at 1 / 100. 000 the scale of their human counterparts in vivo. To increase the degree of organismal emulation, microfluidic channels of the liver–skin co-culture could be successfully covered with human endothelial cells, thus mimicking human vasculature, for the first time. Finally, exposure routes emulating oral and systemic administration in humans have been qualified by applying <b>a</b> <b>repeated</b> <b>dose</b> administration of a model substance – troglitazone – to the chip-based co-cultures...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Recurrent benign 6 th nerve palsy in the {{paediatric}} {{age group}} is uncommon, {{but has been}} described following viral and bacterial infections. It has also been temporally associated with immunization, but has not been previously described following two different live attenuated vaccines. Case presentation A case is presented of a 12 month old Caucasian boy with recurrent benign 6 th nerve palsy following measles-mumps-rubella and varicella vaccines, given on separate occasions with complete recovery following each episode. No alternate underlying etiology was identified despite extensive investigations and review. Conclusions The majority of benign 6 th nerve palsies {{do not have a}} sinister cause and have an excellent prognosis, with recovery expected in most cases. The exact pathophysiology is unknown, although hypotheses including autoimmune mechanisms and direct viral invasion could explain the pathophysiology behind immunization related nerve palsies. It is important to rule out other aetiologies with thorough history, physical examination and investigations. There is limited information in the literature regarding the safety of <b>a</b> <b>repeat</b> <b>dose</b> of <b>a</b> live vaccine in this setting. Future immunizations should be considered on a case-by-case basis. </p...|$|R
40|$|Cisplatin is {{a potent}} chemotherapeutic; the dose-limiting side effect of this drug is nephrotoxicity, causing acute kidney injury in 30 % of patients. This can lead to end stage renal diseases, {{particularly}} chronic kidney disease (CKD), which is marked {{by the development of}} fibrosis. Currently, there are no therapeutic interventions, which may be due to limitations in the mouse model used to study cisplatin-induced kidney injury. We have previously developed <b>a</b> <b>repeated</b> <b>dosing</b> regimen of cisplatin (mice treated with 7 mg/kg once a week for 4 weeks, mice euthanized at Day 24) in which FVB/n background mice survive and develop renal fibrosis indicative of CKD. Commonly, C 57 BL/ 6 J background mice are utilized to study the nephrotoxic effects of cisplatin on the kidney; however, C 57 BL/ 6 J mice {{have been shown to be}} resistant to renal fibrosis in some models of experimental fibrosis. We wanted to determine if this resistance would also be evident with our <b>repeated</b> <b>dosing</b> regimen of cisplatin. Preliminary data have indicated that while FVB/n mice develop fibrosis when treated with 7 mg/kg of cisplatin, C 57 BL/ 6 J mice do not. We hypothesized that C 57 BL/ 6 J mice would require a higher dose of cisplatin in order to develop interstitial fibrosis that occurs with our <b>repeated</b> <b>dosing</b> of cisplatin. Several techniques were utilized including QRTPCR, IHC, and Western blot analysis to determine the presence of fibrosis in these mice and to compare fibrotic and inflammatory markers to FVB/n mice treated with cisplatin. C 57 BL/ 6 J mice only developed fibrosis when treated with 9 mg/kg cisplatin, which coincided with a robust inflammatory response. In contrast, FVB/n mice developed fibrosis and had a robust inflammatory response with only 7 mg/kg cisplatin. These data suggest that C 57 BL/ 6 J mice are susceptible to the development of renal fibrosis with our <b>repeated</b> <b>dosing</b> model of cisplatin but only when treated with a higher dose...|$|R
40|$|AIM: To {{find the}} most {{reproducible}} quantitative parameter of a standard 13 C-methacetin breath test (13 C-MBT). METHODS: Twenty healthy volunteers (10 female, 10 male) underwent the 13 C-MBT after intake of 75 mg 13 C-methacetin p. o. on three occasions. Short- and medium-term reproducibility was assessed with paired examinations taken at an interval of 2 and 18 d (medians), respectively. RESULTS: The reproducibility of the 1 -h cumulative 13 C recovery (AUC 0 - 60), characterized by a coefficient of variation of 10 %, appeared to be considerably better than the reproducibility of the maximum momentary 13 C recovery or the time of reaching it. Remarkably, {{as opposed to the}} short gap between consecutive examinations, the capacity of the liver to handle 13 C-methacetin increased slightly but statistically significantly when <b>a</b> <b>repeat</b> <b>dose</b> was administered after two to three weeks. Regarding the AUC 0 - 60, the magnitude of this fixed bias amounted to 7. 5 %. Neither the time gap between the repeat examinations nor the gender of the subjects affected the 13 C-MBT reproducibility. CONCLUSION: 13 C-MBT is most reproducibly quantified by the cumulative 13 C recovery, but the exactitude thereof may be modestly affected by persistent stimulation of CYP 1 <b>A</b> 2 on <b>repeat</b> examinations...|$|R
