5|$|Renovations began almost {{immediately}} and involved {{the removal of}} all of the wooden track and modifications to some of the support structure. On March 3, 2010, Six Flags Over Texas and Rocky Mountain Construction (RMC) unveiled the steel I-Box track which would be used on the refurbished ride. The track was developed over the course of three years by RMC owner Fred Grubb, and Ride Centerline, LLC engineers Alan Schilke and Dody Bachtar. The steel track was designed to be a replacement for any existing wooden track structure, with the rail shape, <b>approximate</b> <b>weight,</b> and dimensions remaining the same. Schilke designed the modifications to the layout, giving specifications to Grubb for manufacturing at RMC's Idaho plant. There, two-dimensional plates of steel were machine-welded to form the three-dimensional track parts. The redevelopment saw much of the track get reprofiled; the lift hill was increased by , the first drop was steepened to 79 degrees, and several overbanked turns (ranging from 90° to 115°) were added. The renovated ride, dubbed the New Texas Giant, reopened on April 4, 2011.|$|E
500|$|Most horses {{only need}} quality forage, water, and a salt or mineral block. Grain or other {{concentrates}} {{are often not}} necessary. [...] But, when grain or other concentrates are fed, quantities must be carefully monitored. To do so, horse feed is measured by weight, not volume. [...] For example, [...] of oats has a different volume than [...] of corn. When continuous access to feed is not possible, it is more consistent with natural feeding behavior to provide three small feedings per day instead {{of one or two}} large ones. [...] However, even two daily feedings is preferable to only one. To gauge the amount to feed, a weight tape can be used to provide a reasonably accurate estimate of a horse's weight. [...] The tape measures the circumference of the horse's barrel, just behind the withers and elbows, and the tape is calibrated to convert circumference into <b>approximate</b> <b>weight.</b>|$|E

40|$|In a {{situation}} where imprecise attribute weights such as a rank order are captured, various <b>approximate</b> <b>weighting</b> methods have been proposed to aid multiattribute decision analysis. Among others, {{it is well known}} that the rank order centroid (ROC) weights result in the highest performance in terms of the identification of the best alternative under the ranked attribute weights. In this paper, we aim to reinterpret the meaning of the ROC weights and to develop a compatible weighting method that is based on other well-established academic disciplines. The ordered weighted averaging (OWA) method is a nonlinear aggregation method in that the weights are associated with the objects reordered according to their magnitudes in the aggregation process. Some interesting semantics can be attached to the <b>approximate</b> <b>weights</b> in view of the measure developed in the OWA method. Furthermore, the weights generated by the maximum entropy method show equally compatible performance with the ROC weights under some condition, which is demonstrated by theoretical and simulation analysis.

40|$|Analyses of bunyavirus-infected cell {{extracts}} identified {{at least}} two virus-induced nonstructural polypeptides. With snowshoe hare (SSH), La Crosse (LAC), and six SSH-LAC reassortant viruses, it was shown {{that one of these}} nonstructural polypeptides (NSs, <b>approximate</b> molecular <b>weight,</b> 7. 4 X 10 (3)) is coded by the SSH small (S) -size viral RNA species. This nonstructural polypeptide was not detected (at least in the same relative abundancies) in LAC virus-infected cells or in cells infected with reassortants having LAC S RNA. For SSH virus, tryptic peptide analyses of either [3 H]leucine- or [3 H]arginine-labeled NSs indicated that it contains unique sequences not present in the SSH nucleocapsid (N) polypeptide (also coded by the S RNA; J. R. Gentsch and D. H. L. Bishop, J. Virol. 28 : 417 - 419, 1978). Analyses of SSH virus-infected cell extracts and extracts of cells infected with SSH-LAC reassortants having SSH medium (M) -size RNA species indicated that a nonstructural polypeptide (NSM; <b>approximate</b> molecular <b>weight,</b> 12 X 10 (3)) is coded by the SSH M RNA species. In extracts of LAC virus-infected cells (or cells infected with SSH-LAC reassortants having LAC M RNA), a polypeptide with an electrophoretic mobility slightly faster than that of the SSH NSM polypeptide was observed (<b>approximate</b> molecular <b>weight,</b> 11 X 10 (3)); it has been designated LAC NSM.
