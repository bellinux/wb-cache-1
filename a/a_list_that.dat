25|$|The only {{significant}} advantage that bubble sort has over most other implementations, even quicksort, but not insertion sort, {{is that the}} ability to detect that the list is sorted efficiently is built into the algorithm. When the list is already sorted (best-case), the complexity of bubble sort is only O(n). By contrast, most other algorithms, even those with better average-case complexity, perform their entire sorting process on the set and thus are more complex. However, not only does insertion sort have this mechanism too, but it also performs better on <b>a</b> <b>list</b> <b>that</b> is substantially sorted (having a small number of inversions).|$|E

25|$|The Nikkatsu Company, having ceased film {{production}} during World War II, restarted in 1954 and lured assistant directors from other companies. Masuda joined the studio {{as an assistant}} director and writer. He continued to write scripts for and with his mentor Inoue, who had also made the switch. He served as 1st AD to Kon Ichikawa on the sets of The Heart (1955) and The Burmese Harp (1956). Masuda was promoted to director in 1957 and debuted with A Journey of Body and Soul the following year. It was a B movie, a low-budget film meant {{to fill out a}} double feature, but he quickly ascended to the <b>A</b> <b>list</b> <b>that</b> same year.|$|E
25|$|Additional {{lifeboats}} {{could be}} stored {{within reach of}} the davits on the deck house roof, and in an emergency the gantry davits could reach lifeboats {{on the other side}} of the ship, providing that none of the funnels was obstructing the way. The aim of this design was to enable all the lifeboats to be launched, even if the ship developed <b>a</b> <b>list</b> <b>that</b> would normally prevent lifeboats being launched on the side opposite to the list. However, several of these davits were placed abreast of funnels, defeating that purpose. The ship carried 48 lifeboats, capable of carrying at least 75 people each. Thus, 3,600 people could be carried by the lifeboats, more than the maximum number of people the ship could carry.|$|E
25|$|The {{club was}} not keen on repeating the {{disaster}} of 1991–92, {{and in the}} next season Bayern spent the equivalent of €12 million on the new players—Thomas Helmer (€4M), Brazil's captain Jorginho (€2.8M) and Lothar Matthäus (€2M) topped the bill of <b>a</b> <b>list</b> <b>that</b> also included Mehmet Scholl. Calming the nerves of the thrifty President Dr. Fritz Scherer, an economics professor at the University of Munich, was the sale of Stefan Effenberg and Brian Laudrup for €8.5 million to Fiorentina. The rebuilt side came close to winning the title, but just missed out. Ribbeck's tactics, which were felt to be overly negative, were blamed for this, and when the following season looked to be going no differently, Beckenbauer dismissed Ribbeck and took control of the team himself. An immediate upturn in form saw Bayern take that year's title.|$|E

25|$|At the time, {{players with}} {{one year of}} service {{in the minor leagues}} were subject to a draft if they were not called up to the major leagues. The White Sox left McLain in the minor leagues, and he was {{selected}} off waivers by the Detroit Tigers on April 8, 1963. He progressed swiftly through the Tigers' minor league system, and made his major-league debut with them on September 21, 1963 at the age of 19. His major-league debut, against the Chicago White Sox, was almost as impressive as his minor-league debut, holding the White Sox to one earned run on seven hits. He also picked off two baserunners and hit a home run, which was the only home run of his major-league career. McLain is one of only six teenaged pitchers to hit a major-league home run since 1920, <b>a</b> <b>list</b> <b>that</b> includes Hall-of-Famers Don Drysdale and Jim Palmer.|$|E
