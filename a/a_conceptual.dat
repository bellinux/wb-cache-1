40|$|For {{defining}} {{a set of}} unambiguous and language-independent metrics and other relevant concepts, the need for definition of <b>a</b> formal <b>conceptual</b> framework of the context/environment, particularly for safety-critical environments, has earlier been recognized and emphasized. In this paper, <b>a</b> formal <b>conceptual</b> framework is proposed for defining metrics and other relevant concepts for a component-based system, in which, instead of component, assembly—a slightly modified and more general concept—is taken as a basic building block for design and development of software. The paper discusses <b>a</b> formal <b>conceptual</b> framework for the structure of context for a component-based system. In another paper, <b>a</b> formal <b>conceptual</b> framework for the dynamics / behaviour {{within the context of}} a component-based system is discussed...|$|R

The major difference {{compared to the}} TiME probe would be that TALISE is envisioned with its own propulsion system and would therefore {{not be limited to}} simply drifting on the lake when it splashes down.|$|E
5|$|Spiritual Machines is {{the fourth}} studio album by the Canadian {{alternative}} rock band Our Lady Peace, released by Columbia Records in December 2000. Although not initially intended, the project evolved into <b>a</b> <b>conceptual</b> interpretation of futurist and inventor Raymond Kurzweil's 1999 book The Age of Spiritual Machines. Short tracks of spoken dialog from Kurzweil himself are interspersed among the actual songs on the album. The Kurzweil K250 keyboard, one of his inventions, was utilized throughout the recording of the album.|$|E
5|$|The {{reign of}} Western Chalukyas was an {{important}} period {{in the development of}} Deccan architecture. Their architecture served as <b>a</b> <b>conceptual</b> link between the Badami Chalukya architecture of the 8th century and the Hoysala architecture popularised in the 13th century. The centre of their cultural and temple-building activity lay in the Tungabhadra region of modern Karnataka state, encompassing the present-day Dharwad district; it included areas of present-day Haveri and Gadag districts. Here, large medieval workshops built numerous monuments. These monuments, regional variants of pre-existing dravida temples, defined the Karnata dravida tradition.|$|E
40|$|<b>As</b> <b>conceptual</b> {{models are}} both {{the result of}} and subject to {{communication}} between domain experts and information analysts, it is of the highest importance to explicitly relate conceptual models to the language {{in which they are}} communicated. To achieve this, we identify a set of semantic primitives in <b>a</b> suitable <b>conceptual</b> modelling framework and present the prototype of a knowledge extraction tool which helps analysts to find useful primitives in free natural language texts. In addition we suggest possible extensions of the presented approach to other phases of conceptual modelling...|$|R

5|$|After {{their work}} with Black Uhuru and that group's line-up change, Sly and Robbie pursued more {{international}} music endeavors. They branched out into cross-genre experiments with <b>a</b> <b>conceptual,</b> ensemble-oriented approach, while developing a mentorship with record producer Bill Laswell, whom they met through Blackwell and by working on Mick Jagger's 1985 album She's the Boss. In 1985, they collaborated with Laswell on their album Language Barrier, which had guest contributions from Herbie Hancock, Bob Dylan, Afrika Bambaataa, and Manu DiBango. Its recording developed from a track the duo had revisited from their work on the soundtrack to the 1983 film Never Say Never Again. The track had been done with electronic drums at Compass Point Studios, but scrapped as a rhythm track for later use.|$|E
5|$|Risk parity is <b>a</b> <b>conceptual</b> {{approach}} to investing which attempts {{to provide a}} lower risk and lower fee alternative to the traditional portfolio allocation of 60% stocks and 40% bonds which carries 90% of its risk in the stock portion of the portfolio (see illustration). The risk parity approach attempts to equalize risk by allocating funds to {{a wider range of}} categories such as stocks, government bonds, credit-related securities and inflation hedges (including real assets, commodities, real estate and inflation-protected bonds), while maximizing gains through financial leveraging. According to Bob Prince, CIO at Bridgewater Associates, the defining parameters of a traditional risk parity portfolio are uncorrelated assets, low equity risk, and passive management.|$|E
