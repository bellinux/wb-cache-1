5|$|The central {{business}} district is focused around the commercial and recreational grid bounded by Best and Tarcutta Streets and the Murrumbidgee River and the Sturt Highway. The main shopping street of Wagga is Baylis Street which becomes Fitzmaurice Street at the northern end. The city is in an <b>alluvial</b> <b>valley</b> {{and much of the}} city has a problem with urban salinity.|$|E
5|$|Wagga Wagga is {{upstream}} from the Riverina plain in the mid-catchment {{range of the}} Murrumbidgee River in an <b>alluvial</b> <b>valley</b> confined by low bedrock hills. Much of Wagga Wagga is on heavy clay soils in a large drainage basin with a small catchment discharge point. Groundwater therefore cannot leave easily, leading to Wagga Wagga having a problem with waterlogged soil and soil salination. Urban salination in Wagga Wagga is now {{the subject of a}} large multi-pronged approach to prevent further salination and reclaim salt-affected areas.|$|E
25|$|Much of {{the flat}} plains {{are part of the}} flood-prone <b>alluvial</b> <b>valley</b> of the Río Grande de Loíza and its main tributaries, the Río Canóvanas and Río Canovanillas. Floods are typical during the storm season, between June and November. Other {{important}} tributaries are the Río Herrera and Río Cubuy, as well as numerous creeks.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The {{problem of}} dynamic {{response}} of multiple circular cavities near multiple semi-cylindrical <b>alluvial</b> <b>valleys</b> under incident plane SH-waves is {{investigated by the}} methods of complex function and multi-polar coordinates in this paper. Firstly, the solution domain {{is divided into two}} parts, Domain I is multiple semi-cylindrical <b>alluvial</b> <b>valleys,</b> and Domain II is an elastic half space with several subsurface circular cavities near multiple semi-cylindrical <b>alluvial</b> <b>valleys.</b> A series of infinite algebraic equations is then obtained based on the displacement and stress continuity condition on “common boundary ” of two parts after constructing the associated displacement and stresses expressions of each part. Finally some numerical expamples are prensented and dynamic response of subsurface circular cavities near semi-cylindrical <b>alluvial</b> <b>valleys</b> with respect to different parameters is discussed...|$|R

25|$|Indian Valley is {{the third}} {{important}} <b>alluvial</b> <b>valley</b> of the upper basin. It is located along lower Indian Creek, near its confluence with Lights Creek. By {{the end of the}} 19th century Indian Valley was considered the most important valley of Plumas County and its swampy land was developed into a prosperous agricultural landscape. Communities in Indian Valley include Greenville and Taylorsville.|$|E
500|$|The west dam {{rises to}} [...] above the valley floor. It spans [...] over a nearly flat <b>alluvial</b> <b>valley</b> floor between bedrock {{abutment}} ridges. About 65% of the dam's foundation area {{is founded on}} quartzite and phyllite bedrock. The remainder is founded on dense alluvium that fills three buried channels, which are up to [...] deep. The foundation excavations were extended [...] below the original ground surface to remove liquefaction soils {{that would have made}} the dam unstable in an earthquake. To minimize foundation seepage through the alluvium, [...] thick cut-off walls of plastic concrete were constructed across the three alluvial channels and excavated at least [...] into bedrock. To reduce seepage through the rock foundation, the entire core width was consolidation grouted and a double-line grout curtain was installed to a depth of approximately [...] Grouting of the west dam took about two years to complete and required [...] of grout holes.|$|E
2500|$|In {{order for}} an <b>alluvial</b> <b>valley</b> to exist {{there must be}} a highly {{elevated}} zone, usually uplifted by active tectonic movement, and a lower zone, which acts as a conduit for water and sediment to the ocean.|$|E

2500|$|The Tagus ( [...] ; , , [...] ) is {{the longest}} river in the Iberian Peninsula. It is [...] long, [...] in Spain, [...] along the border between Portugal and Spain and [...] in Portugal, where it empties into the Atlantic Ocean near Lisbon. It drains an area of [...] (the second largest in the Iberian {{peninsula}} after the Douro). The Tagus is highly utilized {{for most of its}} course. Several dams and diversions supply drinking water to most of central Spain, including Madrid, and Portugal, while dozens of hydroelectric stations create power. Between dams it follows a very constricted course, but after Almourol it enters a vast <b>alluvial</b> <b>valley</b> prone to flooding. At its mouth is a large estuary on which the port city of Lisbon is situated.|$|E
2500|$|Even {{before its}} authorization, the Birds Point-New Madrid Floodway {{was the subject}} of controversy. In June 1927, President Calvin Coolidge {{instructed}} the Mississippi River Commission and the Corps of Engineers to develop a plan to protect the Mississippi <b>alluvial</b> <b>valley</b> from future floods. The Commission recommended four floodways below the mouth of the Arkansas River and, above, stronger and higher levees set back from the channel. Chief of Engineers Maj. Gen. Edgar Jadwin rejected the costly plan and submitted one of his own. Jadwin's plan included the Birds Point-New Madrid floodway with a setback levee between [...] and [...] miles from the existing mainline levee. Eleven miles of the mainline levee were to be lowered by [...] to create a fuse plug levee. At a flood stage of [...] on the Cairo gage, the levee would overtop and creavasse to divert water to the floodway.|$|E
60|$|The {{real work}} of the {{campaign}} and siege of Vicksburg now began. The problem was to secure a footing upon dry ground {{on the east side}} of the river from which the troops could operate against Vicksburg. The Mississippi River, from Cairo south, runs through a rich <b>alluvial</b> <b>valley</b> of many miles in width, bound on the east by land running from eighty up to two or more hundred feet above the river. On the west side the highest land, except in a few places, is but little above the highest water. Through this valley the river meanders in the most tortuous way, varying in direction to all points of the compass. At places it runs to the very foot of the bluffs. After leaving Memphis, there are no such highlands coming to the water's edge on the east shore until Vicksburg is reached.|$|E

50|$|Three-quarters of the {{population}} of Gunnison's prairie dogs are located in Arizona and New Mexico. They can be found in high desert, grasslands, meadows, hillsides, broad <b>alluvial</b> <b>valleys</b> and floodplains. They are often found in shrubs, such as rabbitbrush, sagebrush, and saltbrush. This species of prairie dogs resides in habitats ranging from 6,000-10,000 feet in altitude, although they have been recorded at altitudes as high as 12,000 feet.|$|R
6000|$|On the 7th of May {{the wagons}} were all loaded and General Taylor started on his return, with his army {{reinforced}} at Point Isabel, but still {{less than three}} thousand strong, to relieve the garrison on the Rio Grande. The road from Point Isabel to Matamoras is over an open, rolling, treeless prairie, until the timber that borders {{the bank of the}} Rio Grande is reached. This river, like the Mississippi, flows through a rich <b>alluvial</b> <b>valley</b> in the most meandering manner, running towards all points of the compass at times within a few miles. Formerly the river ran by Resaca de la Palma, some four or five miles east of the present channel. The old bed of the river at Resaca had become filled at places, leaving a succession of little lakes. The timber that had formerly grown upon both banks, and for a considerable distance out, was still standing. This timber was struck six or eight miles out from the besieged garrison, at a point known as Palo Alto--"Tall trees" [...] or [...] "woods." ...|$|E
60|$|For {{the first}} five miles we passed through the most curious granite formation, a {{succession}} of small hills entirely composed of rounded boulders of granite, weighing from five to 1000 tons, and looking exactly like piles of gigantic snow-balls hurled together by some mighty hand. The granite formation prevails in all {{this part of the}} country, and individual boulders sometimes take very curious shapes; for instance, in the bush-veldt we passed a great column towering high above the trees, composed of six boulders getting smaller and smaller from the base up, and each accurately balanced on the one beneath it. Then we crossed the range of hills which overlooks the fort, and passing Secocoeni's old kraal where he used to live before he retreated to his fastnesses, we arrived at a great <b>alluvial</b> <b>valley</b> nine miles broad, {{on the other side of}} which rises the Loolu. It was on this plain that the only real fight between the volunteers and Secocoeni's men took place, when the former managed to get between the Basutus and the hills, and shot them down like game, killing over 200 men. Leaving the battle-field, where the skeletons still lie, a little to our right, we crossed the plain and came to the foot of the Loolu, all along the base of which stand neat villages inhabited by Secocoeni's people. Some of these villages have been burnt by the volunteers, and the remainder are entirely deserted, their inhabitants having built fresh huts among the rocks in almost inaccessible places. The appearance of these white huts peeping out all over the black rocks was very curious, and reminded one of the Swiss chalets.|$|E
60|$|Instead {{of leaving}} the spot by the gate, he flung himself over the fence, and pursued a {{direction}} towards the river under the trees. And it was now, in his lonely progress, that he showed {{for the first time}} outwardly that he was not altogether unworthy of her. He wore long water-boots reaching above his knees, and, instead of making a circuit to find a bridge by which he might cross the Froom--the river aforesaid--he made straight for the point whence proceeded the low roar that was at this hour the only evidence of the stream's existence. He speedily stood on the verge of the waterfall which caused the noise, and stepping into the water {{at the top of the}} fall, waded through with the sure tread of one who knew every inch of his footing, even though the canopy of trees rendered the darkness almost absolute, and a false step would have precipitated him into the pool beneath. Soon reaching the boundary of the grounds, he continued in the same direct line to traverse the <b>alluvial</b> <b>valley,</b> full of brooks and tributaries to the main stream--in former times quite impassable, and impassable in winter now. Sometimes he would cross a deep gully on a plank not wider than the hand; at another time he ploughed his way through beds of spear-grass, where at a few feet to the right or left he might have been sucked down into a morass. At last he reached firm land on the other side of this watery tract, and came to his house on the rise behind--Elsenford--an ordinary farmstead, from the back of which rose indistinct breathings, belchings, and snortings, the rattle of halters, and other familiar features of an agriculturist's home.|$|E
40|$|Amplification {{of ground}} motion in three {{dimensions}} due to cylindrical <b>alluvial</b> <b>valleys</b> of arbitrary cross section is investigated in this paper. The incident wave is either a plane SH or Rayleigh wave, propagating at an arbitrary angle to the axis of the valley. A hybrid numerical method combining boundary integral representation and finite element dis-cretization has been employed. Numerical results show significant am-plification depending on the angles of incidence and geometries of the valleys...|$|R
50|$|Hastings and Macleay was {{an electoral}} {{district}} of the Legislative Assembly in the Australian state of New South Wales from 1894 to 1920. It was created with {{the division of}} the two-member electorate of Hastings and Manning. In 1920 proportional representation was introduced and Hastings and Macleay was absorbed into the new four-member district of Oxley. The electorate was named after the Hastings and Macleay Rivers, the <b>alluvial</b> <b>valleys</b> of which contained most of its population.|$|R
50|$|Topographically, it lies on {{pleistocene}} surface, between swamped <b>alluvial</b> <b>valleys</b> of {{the brook}} Vrtlin {{from the east}} and the brook Koruska from the west. Relief, geological-petrografical structure, convenient climate and abundance of water, all these were elements of economical and demographic development of the city. Modern demographic-economical transformation has changed relations in space and structure of population, and it's seeable through processes of deagrarization, industrialization and deruralization. This effected with abandonning agricultural production, abandonning villages and moving to Križevci.|$|R
