25|$|The group {{moved over}} to the north end (La Salle side) after talks between Cojuangco and Letran Rector Fr. Regino Cortes. Only then did the Letran bleachers fill up. With the game on the way, Letran was toting a 22–18 lead when they called a {{time-out}} halfway through the first half; then, the south end reserve section (Letran side) erupted with at least five burly men (part of the guests of La Salle's team manager) ganging up on a hapless Letran high school sophomore student for <b>a</b> <b>full</b> <b>minute</b> before police could intervene. But for the mauled student, none was picked up (by the police). Almost simultaneously, the La Salle bench suddenly stood up, the players hunched and protecting their heads with towels and jackets against various missiles pelted on them.|$|E
25|$|The {{win over}} the title-contending Cobb gave Norton another shot at a {{potential}} title-fight, and on May 11, 1981. at Madison Square Garden {{he stepped into the}} ring with top contender Gerry Cooney, who, like Cobb, was undefeated entering the fight. Very early in the fight it became clear that Norton was no longer the caliber of fighter he once was, as Cooney's first punch caused Norton's legs to buckle. Norton continued to take shots from Cooney in his corner for nearly <b>a</b> <b>full</b> <b>minute</b> before Perez, who refereed his last fight, stepped in to stop the bout 54 seconds in, as Norton was slumped in his corner. Norton decided to retire following the match and turned his attention to charitable pursuits. Norton's enduring legacy as a fighter is that he is considered second to Joe Frazier as Ali's main nemesis and toughest opponent. Norton fought Ali to three decisions and was never hurt or knocked down. All three bouts were close and subject to controversy. Unfortunately, Norton was less successful against three of the greatest punchers of all time, losing by KO to Foreman and Shavers and by TKO to Cooney. Norton was considered past his prime in boxing from 1979 to 1981.|$|E
500|$|While {{most of the}} group's {{previous}} songs have a dance-oriented sound, [...] "Hold Me Now" [...] has {{a mainstream}} piano-based melody but keeps the prominent bass line and Currie's Latin percussion of earlier releases.

[...] The Nebraska delegation waved red handkerchiefs as Bryan progressed to the podium; he wore an alpaca sack suit more typical of Lincoln and the West than of Chicago.

500|$|Clay Jarvis from Stylus Magazine {{wrote that}} the song possessed [...] "a red-herring, scorched-earth intro, eerie thunderstorm-and-tom-tom-triplet {{interlude}} {{and one of the}} most recognizable riffs in metal history. It is a dynamic, explosive and fitting end to a remarkable, violent experience." [...] D. X. Ferris wrote, author of the 33⅓ book Reign In Blood (...) , that the song [...] "lunges to life with its core riff, the ten most recognizable notes in metal, a diminished-scale run down the fretboard that's the most badass guitar riff since Black Sabbath's 'Sweet Leaf'." [...] Guitarist Kerry King said that [...] "The intro is big with the two harmony and then the first beat that Dave [...] does, that double-kick thing, and it's like this backwards gallop that gets the crowd going wherever you are." [...] The piece ends with <b>a</b> <b>full</b> <b>minute</b> of [...] "rain sound effects," [...] closing Reign in Blood.|$|E
500|$|Cancellara was noticeably still {{recovering}} from his Milan–San Remo effort at Dwars door Vlaanderen, where he tried to attack for victory in the finale, but faded quickly and finished only 36th. The squad's best-placed rider was Posthuma in 31st. Cancellara's recovery was perhaps complete at the E3 Prijs Vlaanderen – Harelbeke. After a series of mechanical incidents, resulting in several wheel changes and then a whole bike change, Cancellara sped past the trailing peloton on the Oude Kwaremont climb and effortlessly bridged {{to the front of}} the race. Once there, he left even the front group on the road well behind him, winning the race by <b>a</b> <b>full</b> <b>minute</b> over second placed Vladimir Gusev. Cancellara said he was more impressed with this victory than when he won the same race in 2010, and analysis of his win suggested he stood as the odds-on favorite for the Tour of Flanders. Jonathan Vaughters, whose [...] team had effectively controlled the front of the race but were powerless to stop Cancellara, stated that should an on-form Cancellara ever get even five seconds' advantage at the front of a race near the end, he would likely not be seen again. Vaughters joked that rival teams would need a sniper to stop the Swiss classics specialist.|$|E

500|$|The {{next several}} stages favored sprinters and a solo {{breakaway}} winner. The overall standings {{did not change}} until stage 9, when a breakaway group involving Thomas Voeckler gained sufficient time that the veteran Frenchman became the new race leader. The Schleck brothers were {{two and a half}} minutes down in the classification at this point, but within a few seconds of the nearest true overall favorite Evans. Fuglsang as well remained in the top ten, 30 seconds the lesser of Andy Schleck and just over three minutes off the race lead. Fränk Schleck took time out of the bulk of the field in stage 12. With [...] remaining in the stage-concluding climb to Luz Ardiden, the elder Schleck brother broke free of the group of the race's top riders in pursuit of two down the road. He did not quite reach them, finishing ten seconds back on the day, but the ride moved him up to second place overall, 28 seconds ahead of his brother and 17 the better of Evans. The brothers both missed an important move in stage 16, ending on the descent from the second-category Col de Manse. Contador, Sánchez, and Evans rode the most aggressive descent, a tactic which gained them a solid measure of time. Evans took 21 seconds out of Fränk Schleck to re-assume second place overall; the younger Schleck brother lost <b>a</b> <b>full</b> <b>minute</b> and six seconds to the veteran Australian.|$|E

2500|$|During their {{climb back}} to Blanket Hill, several guardsmen stopped and half-turned {{to keep their}} eyes on the {{students}} in the Prentice Hall parking lot. At 12:24p.m., according to eyewitnesses, a sergeant named Myron Pryor turned and began firing at the crowd of students with his [...]45 pistol. A number of guardsmen nearest the students also turned and fired their rifles at the students. In all, at least 29 of the 77 guardsmen claimed to have fired their weapons, using an estimate of 67 rounds of ammunition. The shooting was determined to have lasted only 13 seconds, although John Kifner reported in The New York Times that [...] "it appeared to go on, as a solid volley, for perhaps <b>a</b> <b>full</b> <b>minute</b> or a little longer."
