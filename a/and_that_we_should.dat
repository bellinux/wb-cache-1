5|$|The most {{frequently}} used argument in favour of dualism appeals to the common-sense intuition that conscious experience is distinct from inanimate matter. If asked what the mind is, the average person would usually respond by identifying it with their self, their personality, their soul, or some other such entity. They would almost certainly deny that the mind simply is the brain, or vice versa, finding {{the idea that there}} is just one ontological entity at play to be too mechanistic, or simply unintelligible. Many modern philosophers of mind think that these intuitions are misleading <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> use our critical faculties, along with empirical evidence from the sciences, to examine these assumptions to determine whether there is any real basis to them.|$|E
500|$|Benfica started December with a Derby de Lisboa {{game against}} Sporting. They won 3–0, with a first half goal by Van Hooijdonk and two {{goals in a}} five-minute span from João Tomás. Following the win, Mourinho {{requested}} a contract extension as a demonstration {{of faith in the}} work he had put in along with his assistant: [...] "Me [...] and Mozer thought {{that the only way to}} end speculation and the constant threat of being sacked in the event of a bad result...was renewing our contracts for another season." [...] Their proposal was not met. They parted ways with the club through an announcement in a press conference: [...] "He [...] thought it was better not to accept our request. We understood that decision showed a lack of trust in our work, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> offer our resignation..." [...] Benfica immediately appointed Toni – a long-time favourite of the President – as the new manager. On 10 December, Benfica played Alverca away from home. They opened the score sheet with a goal from João Tomás close to half-time, but Mantorras equalized. Later, Milinkovic put the Ribatejo side in the lead, resulting in the fourth loss in seven matches in away games for Benfica. In the last match of the year 2000, Benfica met a struggling Gil Vicente, who were at the bottom of the Primeira Liga standings. Unable to unlock the 0–0 draw, the club suffered their eighth winless league game of the season.|$|E
2500|$|Good {{had shown}} that, for some {{configurations}} of background knowledge, Nicod's criterion is false (provided {{that we are}} willing to equate [...] "inductively support" [...] with [...] "increase the probability of" [...] – see below). The possibility remained that, with respect to our actual configuration of knowledge, which is very different from Good's example, Nicod's criterion might still be true and so we could still reach the paradoxical conclusion. Hempel, on the other hand, insists that it is our background knowledge itself which is the red herring, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> consider induction with respect to a condition of perfect ignorance.|$|E

2500|$|In September 2004, the US {{government}} 9/11 Commission {{investigating the}} September 11 attacks officially {{concluded that the}} attacks were conceived and implemented by al-Qaeda operatives. In October 2004, bin Laden appeared to claim responsibility for the attacks in a videotape released through Al Jazeera, saying he was inspired by Israeli attacks on high-rises in the 1982 invasion of Lebanon: [...] "As I looked at those demolished towers in Lebanon, it entered my mind that we should punish the oppressor in kind <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> destroy towers in America in order that they taste some of what we tasted and so that they be deterred from killing our women and children." ...|$|E
2500|$|On 6 September 1941, Germany's Chief of Staff Alfred Jodl visited Helsinki. His {{main goal}} was to persuade Mannerheim to {{continue}} the offensive. In 1941, President Ryti declared to the Finnish Parliament that {{the aim of the}} war was to restore the territories lost during the Winter War and gain more territories in the east to create a [...] "Greater Finland". After the war, Ryti stated: [...] "On August 24, 1941 I visited the headquarters of Marshal Mannerheim. The Germans aimed us at crossing the old border and continuing the offensive to Leningrad. I said that the capture of Leningrad was not our goal <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> not take part in it. Mannerheim and Minister of Defense Walden agreed with me and refused the offers of the Germans. The result was a paradoxical situation: the Germans could not approach Leningrad from the north..." [...] There was little or no systematic shelling or bombing from the Finnish positions. Mannerheim had spent most of his career in the Imperial Russian Army stationed at old St. Petersburg.|$|E
2500|$|Commenting on {{this first}} edition of The United Irishman, Lord Stanley in the House of Lords, on 24 February 1848, {{maintained}} that the paper pursued [...] "the purpose of exciting sedition and rebellion among her Majesty's subjects in Ireland... it is language used in no common way, {{and for this reason}} I have called the attention of her Majesty's Government to it. This is not a mere casual article in a newspaper—it is the declaration of the aim and object for which it is established, and of the design with which its promoters have set out; that object being {{to do everything possible to}} drive the people of Ireland to sedition, to urge them into open rebellion, and to promote civil war for the purpose of exterminating every Englishman in Ireland. I hope, my Lords, her Majesty's Government will not say that this is a matter quite in theory—that it is below contempt, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> allow it to pass by in silence. If such a publication had appeared in England, I should have been very much inclined to think the good sense and sound judgment of the people would have rejected the article at once as a seditious invective, whose very violence, like an overdose of poison, prevented its effect.|$|E
