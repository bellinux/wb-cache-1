5|$|During the {{construction}} of the second road bridge, {{the construction}} of a railway through Perth's southern suburbs to Rockingham and Mandurah became <b>a</b> <b>political</b> <b>issue.</b> The incumbent Liberal State Government proposed building a railway from Kenwick to connect to the Kwinana Freeway, running in the centre of the freeway for only part of its journey. The Labor opposition instead wanted to build the railway across the Narrows Bridge and down most of the length of the freeway.|$|E
5|$|The D'Oliveira {{affair was}} a {{prolonged}} political and sporting controversy {{relating to the}} scheduled 1968–69 tour of South Africa by the England cricket team, who were officially representing the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC). The point of contention was {{whether or not the}} England selectors would include Basil D'Oliveira, a mixed-race South African player who had represented England in Test cricket since 1966, having moved there six years earlier. With South Africa under apartheid, the potential inclusion by England of a non-white South African in their tour party became <b>a</b> <b>political</b> <b>issue.</b>|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{unsuccessful}} ventures against Philip and Alexander, the Athenians still respected Demosthenes. In 336BC, the orator Ctesiphon {{proposed that}} Athens honour Demosthenes {{for his services}} to the city by presenting him, according to custom, with a golden crown. This proposal became <b>a</b> <b>political</b> <b>issue</b> and, in 330BC, Aeschines prosecuted Ctesiphon on charges of legal irregularities. In his most brilliant speech, On the Crown, Demosthenes effectively defended Ctesiphon and vehemently attacked those who would have preferred peace with Macedon. He was unrepentant about his past actions and policies and insisted that, when in power, the constant aim of his policies was the honour and the ascendancy of his country; and on every occasion and in all business he preserved his loyalty to Athens. He finally defeated Aeschines, although his enemy's objections to the crowning were arguably valid from a legal point of view.|$|E

5|$|After {{returning}} to Australia, Graham was subsequently appointed Chief of Staff, Northern Command in December 1967. By 1969 {{a large percentage}} of Australian casualties in Vietnam were being caused by mines, including significant quantities of M16 anti-personnel devices removed by the Viet Cong from the barrier minefield at Dat Do. Total Australian casualties from such mines were later estimated as 55 killed and 250 wounded, a figure which constituted approximately 11 percent of those killed during the war. These losses increasingly became <b>a</b> <b>political</b> <b>issue</b> as support for the war in Australia waned, and the efficacy of the decision was later criticised, both within the military and in the media. As the controversy surrounding the minefield grew, in February 1969 Graham was promoted to major general and appointed Deputy Chief of the General Staff (DCGS) and Fifth Military Member of the Military Board, positions he held until 1972. Meanwhile, after visiting Phuoc Tuy Province respected journalist Denis Warner concluded that although the original concept in laying the minefield had been sound, it was ultimately one of the greatest Australian mistakes of the war. By August 1969 work had begun to remove the minefield.|$|E
5|$|At {{the same}} time, the {{regulation}} of interstate commerce, especially as concerned the railroads, was <b>a</b> <b>political</b> <b>issue.</b> The call for regulation of the railroads divided the nation's business interests, with railroads working against legislation and manufacturers, who were aggrieved by high railroad rates, joining the reformers. Standard Oil joined the latter group in calling for Congressional action. In 1886, Payne voted for {{a bill that would}} reform railroad rates slightly, but was considered ineffective by reformers. After amendments by the House, however, the bill returned to the Senate with more substantive prohibitions on the practices consumers and manufacturers found most egregious. Payne voted against the strengthened Interstate Commerce Act, which passed and was signed into law by President Grover Cleveland. In explaining his vote, Payne said that the law was impractical and unfairly advantaged other methods of shipping (such as boat transportation on the Great Lakes) over the railroads.|$|E
5|$|The Nixon {{presidency}} {{witnessed the}} first large-scale integration {{of public schools}} in the South. Nixon sought a middle way between the segregationist Wallace and liberal Democrats, whose support of integration was alienating some Southern whites. Hopeful of doing well in the South in 1972, he sought to dispose of desegregation as <b>a</b> <b>political</b> <b>issue</b> before then. Soon after his inauguration, he appointed Vice President Agnew to lead a task force, which worked with local leaders—both white and black—to determine how to integrate local schools. Agnew had little interest in the work, and most of it was done by Labor Secretary George Shultz. Federal aid was available, and a meeting with President Nixon was a possible reward for compliant committees. By September 1970, less than ten percent of black children were attending segregated schools. By 1971, however, tensions over desegregation surfaced in Northern cities, with angry protests over the busing of children to schools outside their neighborhood to achieve racial balance. Nixon opposed busing personally but enforced court orders requiring its use.|$|E

5|$|Norway Airlines {{applied in}} 1990 for {{permission}} to operate a charter route from Oslo to Penang, Malaysia, using a Boeing 757. The application was dismissed by the Ministry of Transport and Communications to protect SAS' route from Copenhagen to Singapore. The Penang route was necessary for Norway Airlines to procure a third aircraft, which {{according to the company}} was necessary to generate a profit, and would have created 100 new jobs. In the mean time, Tjæreborg Reiser sent their charter passengers with scheduled flights to London and onwards with British carriers to Malaysia. The dismissal was appealed to Minister of Transport and Communications, Lars Gunnar Lie of the Christian Democratic Party. The issue became <b>a</b> <b>political</b> <b>issue</b> within Syse's Cabinet, as the Conservative Party and the Progress Party were both in favor of increased deregulation of the airline industry. The issue was complicated by the common aviation policy of the three Scandinavian counties, which had largely been established to protect SAS' interest on international services. The cabinet therefore opened for discussion a further deregulation with the governments of Sweden and Denmark. The Conservative Party stated that this was in part a response to Danish and Swedish authorities allowing charter services to Phuket, Thailand, which could be seen as competing to SAS' route to Bangkok. Syse's Cabiet resigned on 3 November over issues regarding Norway and the European Union, before a reply to the application could be made.|$|E
