50|$|Experts had {{attributed}} part of {{the failure}} of SkyExpress and Avianova to unfavourable legislative conditions, and {{during the course of the}} meeting Savelyev noted the legislative changes which would need to implemented to create favourable conditions for the establishment of a true low-cost airline in Russia. Amongst them, Article 108 of the Russian Air Code would need to be amended in order to allow airlines to sell passengers non-refundable tickets and Article 56 of the Russian Air Code would need to be amended to allow the hiring of foreign pilots. Federal aviation rules would need amending to allow for airlines to charge passengers for baggage, who were then allowed to check in 10 kilograms for no charge, and rules would need to be amended to allow airlines not to serve meals on board, something which was then prohibited. Additionally, it was Savelyev's contention that low-cost airlines should operate from their own airport, in order to keep <b>airport</b> <b>taxes</b> to a minimum, and for import duties on aircraft with more than 170 seats to be scrapped.|$|R
