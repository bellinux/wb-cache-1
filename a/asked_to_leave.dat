5|$|After Combat Rock, the Clash {{began to}} disintegrate. Headon was <b>asked</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> the band {{just before the}} album's release because heroin {{addiction}} was damaging his health and drumming. Chimes was brought back to drum {{for the next few}} months. The loss of Headon, well-liked by the others, exposed growing friction within the band. Jones and Strummer began to feud. The band opened for the Who on a leg of their final tour in the US, including a show at New York's Shea Stadium.|$|E

5|$|By {{the end of}} 1944 it {{was also}} {{apparent}} that Germany had abandoned the development of its own bomb and Rotblat <b>asked</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> the project. Chadwick was then shown a security dossier in which Rotblat was {{accused of being a}} Soviet spy and that, having learned to fly at Los Alamos, he was suspected of wanting to join the Royal Air Force so that he could fly to Poland and defect to the Soviet Union. In addition, he was accused of visiting someone in Santa Fe and leaving them a blank cheque to finance the formation of a communist cell.|$|E
5|$|Despite finding like-minded {{students}} in Vienna, the city's climate took {{a toll on}} Andrić's health. He contracted tuberculosis and became seriously ill, then <b>asked</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> Vienna on medical grounds and continue his studies elsewhere, though Hawkesworth believes he may actually have been {{taking part in a}} protest of South Slav students that were boycotting German-speaking universities and transferring to Slavic ones. For a time, Andrić had considered transferring to a school in Russia but ultimately decided to complete his fourth semester at Jagiellonian University in Kraków. He transferred in early 1914, and continued to publish translations, poems and reviews.|$|E

5|$|During the Revolutionary War, Lyon {{initially}} {{served under}} Horatio Gates in upstate New York and Vermont. In {{a version of}} the event later circulated by his political opponents, he was cashiered for cowardice and ordered to carry a wooden sword to represent his shame. In Lyon's version, he and his men were assigned to guard wheat growing in the fields near Jericho, Vermont; unhappy at not being put to good use, he <b>asked</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> Gates' command and join the regiment commanded by Seth Warner. Lyon's conduct was vindicated by both Arthur St. Clair and James Wilkinson.|$|E
5|$|Gilbert and Sullivan {{disagreed}} {{several times}} over {{the choice of a}} subject. After both Princess Ida and Ruddigore, which were less successful than the seven other operas from H.M.S. Pinafore to The Gondoliers, Sullivan <b>asked</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> the partnership, saying that he found Gilbert's plots repetitive and that the operas were not artistically satisfying to him. While the two artists worked out their differences, Carte kept the Savoy open with revivals of their earlier works. On each occasion, after a few months' pause, Gilbert responded with a libretto that met Sullivan's objections, and the partnership was able to continue successfully.|$|E
5|$|He was <b>asked</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> {{the college}} in 1908 after {{offering}} a stranded chorus girl tea and his {{bed for the}} night when she {{was caught in a}} snowstorm.

Glad to be free of the place, he left for Europe soon after, sailing from New York in March 1908.|$|E

The three-piece band consisted of Reznor on guitars and lead vocals, Ron Musarra on drums, and Chris Vrenna on keyboards. The band was poorly received, however, and they were <b>asked</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> the tour after 10 dates. After the Skinny Puppy tour the band was rearranged and expanded to include a fourth member; Musarra departed and Vrenna moved to drums, Gary Talpas, Nick Rushe, and later David Hymes contributed on keyboards, while Richard Patrick was added as guitarist.|$|E

5|$|Chicago's win {{clinched}} the team's 15th postseason berth in franchise history, their first in 9 years since losing in the 1989 National League Championship Series. The Cubs' {{presence in the}} postseason, playing for {{a spot in the}} World Series, led several sportswriters to reference the Curse of the Billy Goat and the difficulties the Cubs' had faced since 1945. The Billy Goat story suggests that Billy Sianis cursed the Cubs after he and his goat were <b>asked</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> game four of the 1945 World Series. The playoff berth matched the Cubs with the Atlanta Braves in the NLDS, where the Cubs were swept 3 games to 0. The Cubs would have to wait another 18 years to win the National League pennant and World Series in 2016, their first NL pennant since 1945, and their first title since 1908.|$|E

During that time, NBN and ABC Newcastle were <b>asked</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> the VHF band to accommodate FM radio. NBN would have been on UHF channel 51, and ABC on UHF channel 48, however this did not eventuate. A proposal to launch a radiated subscription television service with community broadcasting during the daytime hours had also failed that year.|$|E
5|$|The Desert Inn's {{most famous}} guest, {{businessman}} Howard Hughes, arrived on Thanksgiving Day 1966, renting the hotel's entire top two floors. After staying past his initial ten-day reservation, he was <b>asked</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> in December {{so that the}} resort could accommodate the high rollers who were expected for New Year's Eve. Instead of leaving, Hughes started negotiations to buy the Desert Inn. On March 27, 1967, Hughes purchased the resort from Dalitz for $6.2 {{million in cash and}} $7 million in loans. This was the first of many Las Vegas resort purchases by Hughes, including the Sands Hotel and Casino ($14.6 million) and the Frontier Hotel and Casino ($23 million). However, Hughes refused to include the PGA Tour Tournament of Champions in the deal, so Dalitz moved the tournament to his Stardust Resort and Casino in 1967 and 1968.|$|E
