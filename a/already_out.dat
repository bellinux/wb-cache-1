5|$|King Joffrey confronts {{his mother}} with Stannis' letter. Immediately after, the City Watch murders all of King Robert's illegitimate {{children}} that they can find, {{though it is not}} clear who gave the order. Gendry, one of King Robert's bastards, is <b>already</b> <b>out</b> of the city, but his former master smith reveals that he is in a caravan travelling to the Wall. Unknown to the Lannisters, Arya Stark is also travelling in that caravan.|$|E
5|$|They were {{determined}} to thwart any similar tendencies in his son, and when the Great Fire threatened the City, they refused the offers that Charles made of soldiers and other resources. Even in such an emergency, {{the idea of having}} the unpopular Royal troops ordered into the City was political dynamite. By the time that Charles took over command from the ineffectual Lord Mayor, the fire was <b>already</b> <b>out</b> of control.|$|E
5|$|Skopje {{has some}} remains of Prehistorical {{architecture}} {{which can be}} seen on the Tumba Madžari Neolithic site. On {{the other side of the}} city lie the remains of the ancient Scupi, with ruins of a theatre, thermae and a basilica. The Skopje Aqueduct, located between Scupi and the city centre, is rather mysterious because its date of construction is unknown. It seems to have been built by the Byzantines or the Turks, but it was <b>already</b> <b>out</b> of use in the 16th century. It consists of 50 arches, worked in cloisonné masonry.|$|E

5|$|At {{their first}} series of {{meetings}} on 14 September, the Night Defence Committee began collecting a series of suggestions for improvements, which were discussed in depth on 1 October. These were passed on to Dowding for implementation, but he found that many of their suggestions were <b>already</b> <b>out</b> of date. For instance, they suggested building new radars {{that could be used}} over land, allowing the fight to continue throughout the raid. A contract for this type of radar had already been sent out in June or July. They suggested that the filter room at RAF Bentley Priory be devolved down to the Group headquarters to improve the flow of information, but Dowding had already gone a step further and devolved night interception to the Sector level at the airfields. Dowding accepted only four of the suggestions.|$|E
5|$|In France, the {{government}} press misrepresented the battle. Le Moniteur Universel published a report purportedly written by Captain Raymond Cocault of the corvette Diligente. The report began by inaccurately {{claiming that the}} British squadron consisted of nine ships of the line. The report concluded with the information that two British ships had been destroyed on the San Domingo coast alongside three French and that two others had been dismasted and were badly damaged. The official French report, written by Leissègues but not published in France, contradicted this version of events. Leissègues stated that Cocault, with the other smaller warships, had made all sail to the westwards {{at the start of}} the engagement and that by the time the flagship drove ashore, Diligente was <b>already</b> <b>out</b> of sight. Leissègues remained on Santo Domingo for some time, but had returned to Europe by the time the colony fell to a joint English and Spanish force in July 1809. He later received a regional command in the Ionian Sea and took part in the Adriatic campaign.|$|E

25|$|Thus, {{when the}} Act became law on 23 December 1920 it was <b>already</b> <b>out</b> {{of touch with}} realities in Ireland. The long-standing demand for home rule had been {{replaced}} among Nationalists by a demand for complete independence. The Republic's army was waging the Irish War of Independence against British rule, which had reached a nadir in late 1920.|$|E
25|$|The Schooner was <b>already</b> <b>out</b> on {{the field}} before the Oklahoma {{sideline}} and the RUF/NEKS realized the kick had been disallowed. Worse, while moving across the wet, sloppy natural turf, the Schooner's wagon wheels {{ended up in a}} sticky, muddy patch of field and got stuck – {{right in front of the}} Washington bench. The Sooners were quickly penalized an additional 15 yards for unsportsmanlike conduct.|$|E

25|$|Ceramic {{and film}} {{capacitors}} are <b>already</b> <b>out</b> of their smaller capacitance values suitable for higher frequencies {{up to several}} 100nbsp&MHz. They also have significantly lower parasitic inductance, making them suitable for higher frequency applications, due to their construction with end-surface contacting of the electrodes. To increase the range of frequencies, often an electrolytic capacitor {{is connected in parallel}} with a ceramic or film capacitor.|$|E
25|$|The {{devaluation}} of the currency had an immediate effect. Japanese textiles began to displace British textiles in export markets. The deficit spending proved to be most profound {{and went into the}} purchase of munitions for the armed forces. By 1933, Japan was <b>already</b> <b>out</b> of the depression. By 1934, Takahashi realized that the economy was in danger of overheating, and to avoid inflation, moved to reduce the deficit spending that went towards armaments and munitions.|$|E
25|$|The {{successful}} and severely damaging American Linebacker efforts however were not sustained. By {{the time of}} the aerial offensives (a few weeks each), most US forces (over 500,000 troops) were <b>already</b> <b>out</b> of the Vietnam theater. Over 150,000 Northern soldiers however remained in the South after the 1972 Offensive, expanding the conquered zone, building up logistics capacity (including the construction and extension of pipelines) and biding their time, until the final Ho Chi Minh Campaign in 1975.|$|E

25|$|The Spirit of the Staircase, Curreri's 2004 release saw {{the return}} of Jeff Romano, who {{produced}} and performed on 2002's From Long Gones to Hawkmoth. The title of the record comes from a French expression l'esprit d'escalier, the things you think to say after you are <b>already</b> <b>out</b> the door. His first live album, Are You Going to Paul Curreri was recorded at Charlottesville's (now-defunct) Gravity Lounge, and released in 2006. Musical backing was provided by Charlottesvillians Randall Pharr (bass) and Spencer Lathrop (drums).|$|E

The head dancers lead the other dancers {{in the grand}} entry or parade of dancers that opens a pow wow. In many cases, the head dancers are also {{responsible}} for leading the dancers during songs, and often dancers will not enter the arena unless the head dancers are <b>already</b> <b>out</b> dancing.|$|E

Ted continued to receive publication of individual poems within anthologies, and published several more books on small presses. He also began to edit The New Salt Creek Reader, which had six anthologies by 1974.|$|E

25|$|En route home, {{with the}} {{decryption}} of the Japanese plan to invade Midway, Lent was reassigned {{to the second}} of three submarine patrol lines defending the island. His was one of eighteen boats around the island, which (except for Nautilus) accomplished nothing of consequence during the battle. Operating south of Nautilus, Lent picked up an 06.15 contact report of a force <b>already</b> <b>out</b> of reach. At 08.37, he surfaced and headed for Midway in hope of intercepting Japanese in retreat, but was forced to dive by American aircraft (still likely to attack, as Grayling learned), and quickly surfaced again to continue.|$|E
25|$|The Ilmatars {{original}} {{interior layout}} was {{a compromise between}} the traditional two-class passenger liner and the new ro-ro car/passenger ferry. In order to transport cars she was fitted with a gate on the port side, from where cars were driven inside the ship and then lifted mechanically to the actual car deck. This arrangement was <b>already</b> <b>out</b> of date when the ship was delivered, as Finland SS Co.'s subsidiary Siljavarustamo had taken the delivery of the first ro-ro ferry with bow and rear gates on the North Baltic already in 1961. An extra cardeck was added on the ship coinciding with the 1973 lengthening, but that too was served by the side gate and a lift.|$|E
25|$|Coburn {{endorsed}} conservative {{activist and}} former diplomat Alan Keyes in the 2000 Republican presidential primaries. Coburn retired from Congress in 2001, fulfilling his pledge to serve {{no more than}} three terms in the House. His congressional district returned to the Democratic fold, as attorney Brad Carson defeated a Republican endorsed by Coburn. After leaving the House and returning to private medical practice, Coburn wrote Breach of Trust, with ghostwriter John Hart, about his experiences in Congress. The book detailed Coburn's perspective on the internal Republican Party debates over the Contract With America and displayed his disdain for career politicians. Some of the figures he criticized (such as Gingrich) were <b>already</b> <b>out</b> of office {{at the time of the}} book's publishing, but others (such as former House Speaker Dennis Hastert) remained influential in Congress, which resulted in speculation that some congressional Republicans wanted no part of Coburn's return to politics.|$|E
