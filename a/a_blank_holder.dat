5000|$|Deep {{drawing is}} a {{sheet metal forming}} process in which a sheet metal blank is {{radially}} drawn into a forming die by the mechanical action of a punch. It is thus a shape transformation process with material retention. The process is considered [...] "deep" [...] drawing when {{the depth of the}} drawn part exceeds its diameter. This is achieved by redrawing the part through a series of dies. The flange region (sheet metal in the die shoulder area) experiences a radial drawing stress and a tangential compressive stress due to the material retention property. These compressive stresses (hoop stresses) result in flange wrinkles (wrinkles of the first order). Wrinkles can be prevented by using <b>a</b> <b>blank</b> <b>holder,</b> the function of which is to facilitate controlled material flow into the die radius.|$|E

In this type of forming, the die rig employs a rubber pad as one tool half and a solid tool half, similar to the die in a conventional die set, to form a component into its final shape. Dies are made of cast light alloys and the rubber pad is 1.5-2 times thicker than the component to be formed. For Marforming, single-action presses are equipped with die cushions and blank holders. The blank is held against the rubber pad by <b>a</b> <b>blank</b> <b>holder,</b> through which a punch is acting as in conventional deep drawing.

40|$|Deep {{drawing is}} one of the most used sheet metal forming {{processes}} in the production of automotive components, LPG bottles and household goods, among others.

In this study, <b>a</b> {{variable}} <b>blank</b> <b>holder</b> force (VBHF) approach to deep drawing is employed, and a simple closed-loop type algorithm is developed for the VBHF trajectory. The proposed algorithm {{is divided into two}} phases. The objective of the first phase is to check wrinkling and tearing. In this phase, a low BHF is used as the initial BHF, which is then increased to prevent wrinkling while controlling tearing. This phase of the algorithm is terminated when tearing occurs. In numerical simulation, the distance between the die and the <b>blank</b> <b>holder</b> is used to measure wrinkling, and the minimum thickness of the blank is used to determine the tearing. In {{the second phase of the}} algorithm, the deviations in thickness of the part are iteratively examined, without neglecting the occurrence of wrinkling. One of the advantages of using VBHF instead of constant BHF is that it reduces the forming energy. The validity of the proposed algorithm is examined comparing numerical simulation and experimental results.

40|$|Abstract. During forming of non-rotationally {{symmetric}} {{sheet metal}} parts at high pressures non-uniform deformation conditions arise in the flange area. These deformations vary in height and consequently lead to heterogeneous sheet thickness distributions. When using semi-rigid tools, high clamping forces are {{necessary in order to}} compensate for the developing sheet thickness variations in the flange area and to avoid leakages of the system or wrinkling. Moreover, the heterogeneous distribution of the clamping force is strengthened by press inaccuracies. This results in a higher surface pressure distribution {{on one side of the}} flange and finally in a non-uniform material flow out of the flange area. The development of <b>a</b> segmented active-elastic <b>blank</b> <b>holder</b> enables <b>an</b> active material flow control of the flange movement during sheet metal forming at high pressures. The local elasticity of the active-elastic <b>blank</b> <b>holder</b> is based on an optimized layout of the local tool rigidity.

The complex deep drawing of thin metallic sheets is widely used during industrial material forming applications.

An experimental system was prepared which consisted of a hydraulic press capable of applying different loads on the sheet metal blank and <b>a</b> <b>blank</b> <b>holder</b> and the process was controlled by a computer. All simulations were performed by using the ABAQUS/EXPLICIT V 6. 9 software, and the effect of different aluminium alloys, punch and die radius, blank holder force, blank holder gap, and friction coefficient on the wrinkling phenomenon has been investigated. Moreover, the minimal blank holder force was obtained by plotting minor strain with respect to the major strain of produced cups, and obtaining the maximum height of wrinkle in a cup. The wrinkling phenomenon was further investigated on different alloys such as A 6111 -T 4, AA 5754 -O and Al- 1050. The results imply that increasing the blank holder force and friction coefficient on the one hand and reducing the blank holder gap, punch radius, and die radius on the other hand, may lead to a reduction in wrinkling during the deep drawing process. Nevertheless, under the same circumstances of the deep drawing process, the wrinkling of the A 6111 -T 4 alloy is more significant compared to the Al- 1050 and AA 5754 -O alloys, while the Al- 1050 alloy needs less blank holder force to avoid wrinkling.

40|$|The {{development}} and optimisation of automated fabric preforming processes {{is critical for}} the adoption of composite materials for low cost, high volume applications. This thesis presents {{the development of a}} numerical material model to simulate the forming of 2 D fabric plies into complex 3 D shapes. The material model has been used to evaluate the feasibility of using matched-tool forming and double diaphragm forming, to manufacture low cost fabric preforms suitable for liquid moulding processes. The research has focused on two main aspects: (I) fabric characterisation and modelling and (II) process simulation and optimisation. The forming behaviour of woven fabrics and non-crimp fabrics (NCF) has been investigated to understand the deformation mechanisms and the cause of defects, in order to seek feasible solutions for defect reduction. A non-orthogonal constitutive relation has been developed to capture the nonlinear material behaviour, which was implemented in an explicit finite element model and used to refine the forming process. Results from the material model indicate that pillar stitched NCFs are not as compliant as woven fabrics of the same areal mass. The likelihood of defects is therefore higher for the NCF and the shear behaviour is axisymmetric due to the influence of the stitch yarn. The NCF material exhibits two types of wrinkling during matched tool forming; out-of-plane wrinkling at the ply level (macro-scale wrinkling) induced by excessive shear, and in-plane wrinkling at the bundle level (meso-scale wrinkling) caused by fibre compression. Stitch rupture can also occur at high shear angles, which can lead to further localised wrinkling. Fabric bridging is the dominant defect in large curvature regions when using double diaphragm forming (DDF), and wrinkling was found to be generally lower than in matched-tool forming. The model has been used to successfully identify the cause of all of these defects in NCF preforms manufactured by DDF, and has been used to optimise preform geometry and process parameters to mitigate these problems. Darts were added to preforms to alleviate fabric bridging and improve surface conformity, using the tensile stress in the yarns to identify suitable positions and orientations, minimising the effect on the mechanical performance of the component. An optimisation methodology has been developed for placing local inter-ply stitches on multi-ply preforms, by coupling the FE analysis with a genetic algorithm. The stitches enable multiple plies to be joined together to aid robotic handling and the optimisation routine ensures that the placement of the stitches does not adversely affect the formability of the preform. Results indicate that whilst the inter-ply stitches affect the shear distribution at a global level, the formability of a multi-ply preform can be improved compared to the unstitched counterpart by optimising the pattern of through-thickness stitches. A two-step optimisation method was also developed to optimise the boundary conditions for a matched tool forming scenario. Spring-loaded clamps were used to provide in-plane tension in the fabric plies during forming, rather than using <b>a</b> <b>blank</b> <b>holder</b> to induce tension through friction, providing an opportunity to reduce preform size and therefore waste. The optimisation algorithm was used to determine the location and size of the clamps around the blank perimeter and the stiffness of the attached springs.

It indicates that the segmented <b>blank</b> <b>holder</b> has the ability of the local control to sheet metal forming, and can effectively adjust material flow and the strain distribution...|$|R

Then, they {{obtained}} the modified {{model of the}} technique that both of the primary and the secondary <b>blank</b> <b>holder</b> force can be calculated utilizing a mathematical algorithm. Accordingly, the primary <b>blank</b> <b>holder</b> force is computed as the force value that causes to lock the plate between the matrix and blank, and the secondary blank force is also estimated to be the maximum <b>blank</b> <b>holder</b> force.|$|R

The force applied by the hydraulic ram makes more tensile strain in the body and reduces the amount of springback. They showed that the increase of the applied back force in the sample causes the springback angle to reduce. Kuwabara et al. (2009) investigated {{the effect of the}} rolled direction on the springback. They evaluated the springback angle of the various steels with the different yield stress and found that the effect of springback in the tangential direction of rolling always is less than the perpendicular direction. Zhang et al. (2010) invented the multi-step compensation method to modify the springback direction. In this method, the die surface shape is compared with the actual piece {{based on the results of}} the simulation. After the first applied modification of the die, the die surface is simulated again and the results are compared with the actual piece. This is repeated until the deviation between simulation results and the actual piece is minimized. Uemori et al. (1998) studied the modeling type of the plastic hardening in the accuracy of the simulation. For this purpose, they {{examined the}} linear kinematic hardening and the combination of linear and nonlinear kinematic hardening model and it is concluded that the results of simulation in combined model is very similar to reality. The effect of simultaneous tension and pressure applied to the sheet during the forming process is investigated by Schilp et al. (2012). They studied springback factor using tensile pushing-bending, and stretch-bending for two bend angles 45 ° and 90 °. They reported that the stretch-bending case is the best state to reduce the amount of springback. Sing and Agnihotri (2015) studied the parameters affecting the formation of deep stretch. They found that the <b>blank</b> <b>holder</b> force is the most important parameter that must be selected carefully in the deep tensile forming. They revealed that the <b>blank</b> <b>holder</b> force is the only parameter that alone directly affects the outputs such as material flow, variations of the thickness, and tear and shrinkage behavior. Liu et al. (2002) tried to minimize the amount of springback using the changing of the <b>blank</b> <b>holder</b> force. After <b>a</b> certain time, they exerted <b>a</b> large <b>blank</b> <b>holder</b> force on the walls to create a large plastic strain and thereby slowed down the flow of material into the die cavity. In this way, instead of reaching the <b>blank</b> <b>holder</b> force from zero to its maximum value in a short period of time of forming, and remaining constant during the forming period, it starts from an initial value and after a determined period of time, t 1, progressively reaches to the second value and remains constant in the same amount of force up to the end of time of forming, t [...]...|$|R

In deep drawing, wrinkling and tearing of blank sheet are major defects. The optimum segmented <b>blank</b> <b>holder</b> shape and its VBHGs are determined to avoid these defects. The Forming Limit Diagram (FLD) is employed to evaluate quantitatively the wrinkling and the tearing. In the numerical examples, a square cup deep drawing is handled. The objective is to minimize the thickness deviation after sheet forming. The wrinkling and the tearing are separately evaluated as the constraints. The dimensions of the segmented <b>blank</b> <b>holder</b> shape and the BHGs are taken as the design variables. The optimization result shows that simultaneous optimization of both the segmented <b>blank</b> <b>holder</b> shape and the VBHGs {{is one of the}} effective approaches for improving product quality...|$|R
