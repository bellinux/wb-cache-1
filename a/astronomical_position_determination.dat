40|$|This {{research}} analyzes {{and demonstrates}} the local <b>position</b> <b>determination</b> problem on Earth using a novel instrument, the Compass Star Tracker. Special focus {{is given to}} the theoretical development of the mathematics of local <b>position</b> <b>determination,</b> the design and fabrication of a proof-of-concept instrument, an error source analysis, and the experimental tests used to validate the <b>position</b> <b>determination</b> concepts. Star sensors are typically used as attitude determination instruments on spacecraft orbiting Earth. In this capacity, the star sensor determines the orientation of the spacecraft using digital images of the stars. This research utilizes the basic functionality of the star sensor in a new way; the orientation information from the star image is used to determine a user's latitude and longitude coordinates on Earth. This concept is valuable because it allows users to determine their position autonomously. The fundamental concepts that enable local <b>position</b> <b>determination</b> were originally published in Drs. Samaan, Mortari, and Junkins (AAS 04 - 007). This research improves upon that work by eliminating the zenith-orientation constraint and providing several crucial theoretical corrections. In addition to the <b>position</b> <b>determination</b> mathematics, this research provides analysis of the theoretical and practical error sources associated with the <b>position</b> <b>determination</b> problem. This research also details the design, fabrication, and experimental test program of a proof-of-concept Compass Star Tracker. Together, the theoretical development, error analysis, instrument design, and test program serve as validation of the the <b>position</b> <b>determination</b> concept. This work is intended as the first of many steps toward eventual deployment of autonomous <b>position</b> <b>determination</b> sensors on the Moon and Mars...|$|R

40|$|The common {{methods for}} <b>position</b> <b>determination</b> of radio signal {{emitters}} (communications, radar) {{are based on}} meas-uring a specified parameter of the signal such as Angle-of-Arrival (AOA) or Time-of-Arrival (TOA). The measured parameters are then used to estimate the transmitter’s loca-tion. Since the measurements are done at each station inde-pendently, ignoring the constraint that the AOA/TOA esti-mates at different stations correspond to the same location, it is a sub-optimal <b>position</b> <b>determination</b> method. We propose a technique that uses exactly the same data as the common AOA methods but the <b>position</b> <b>determination</b> is direct and can handle more co-channel signals than the common methods. Although there are many stray parame-ters, only two-dimensional search is required for a planar geometry. The technique provides a natural solution to the measurements-sources association problem that is encoun-tered in AOA based systems and outperforms the AOA methods for unknown as well as known signal waveforms. 1...|$|R
