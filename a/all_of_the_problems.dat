5|$|Macrinus' predecessor, Caracalla, {{was murdered}} by a disaffected soldier during a {{campaign}} against Parthia on 8 April 217. Macrinus himself {{may have had a}} hand in the murder of Caracalla. Within days of Caracalla's death, Macrinus was proclaimed emperor {{with the support of the}} army. At the time of his accession he inherited <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>problems</b> that Caracalla had left for Rome—war against Parthia, threats from Armenia and Dacia, and extensive fiscal expenditures. Macrinus successfully concluded a peace with Parthia, but it came at considerable cost to Rome. Finally, his policies to reduce monetary expenditures only stoked discontent within the military.|$|E
5|$|During the 2007 season, the Zero-G Rolls {{were removed}} from the ride and {{replaced}} with banked hills. Robin's hill was installed in March and Batman's in April. Batman's train was painted red so that Robin could use it, because Robin's train was damaged during a previous incident. The Robin side re-opened on April 7 and ran until June 28 when it was closed {{for the rest of the}} year. The Batman side did not operate at all, but three of the five cars from the original Robin train were placed on Batman's maintenance track. Because of <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>problems</b> the coaster had and the numerous failed attempts to fix the coaster, Six Flags decided to cut their financial and technical losses and dismantle the ride.|$|E
5|$|Mulder and Scully {{decide to}} split up and {{interrogate}} the doppelgangers. Betty tells Mulder that Lulu is causing <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>problems</b> and forcing her to leave, while Lulu tells Scully the same thing. Later, the two look-alikes pass each other and a sewer grate blows open, sucking Mulder into the storm drain and sealing him in. Scully finds that the girls share the same father, {{a man by the}} name of Bob Damphouse, who is in prison. Damphouse is revealed to be mentally insane, and is always in a fit of rage. Eventually, Mulder finds his way out of the storm drain. At the prison, Scully meets a man that looks exactly like Bert Zupanic. Lulu and Betty meet at a stadium and everyone in the audience breaks into a fight. The other Bert Zupanic shows up and everyone stops fighting. The two Zupanics see each other and a fight breaks out again. The episode ends with Mulder and Scully shown bruised and beaten.|$|E

25|$|The Northrop X-21 was a {{modified}} WB-66D with an experimental wing, designed to conduct laminar flow control studies. Laminar-flow control {{was thought to}} potentially reduce drag {{by as much as}} 25%. Control would be by removal of a small amount of the boundary-layer air by suction through porous materials, multiple narrow surface slots, or small perforations. Northrop began flight research in April 1963 at Edwards Air Force Base, but with <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>problems</b> encountered, and money going into the war, the X-21 would be the last experiment involving this concept.|$|E
25|$|The word {{error in}} {{medicine}} {{is used as}} a label for nearly <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>problems</b> harming patients. Medical errors are often described as human errors in healthcare. Whether the label is a medical error or human error, one definition used in medicine says that it occurs when a healthcare provider chooses an inappropriate method of care or improperly executes an appropriate method of care. It has been said that the definition should be the subject of more debate. For instance, studies of hand hygiene compliance of physicians in an ICU show that compliance varied from 19% to 85%. The deaths that result from infections caught as a result of treatment providers improperly executing an appropriate method of care by not complying with known safety standards for hand hygiene are difficult to regard as innocent accidents or mistakes. At the least, they are negligence, if not dereliction, but in medicine they are lumped together under the word error with innocent accidents and treated as such.|$|E
500|$|Gene Kranz {{called a}} meeting of his staff in Mission Control {{three days after the}} accident, {{delivering}} a speech which has subsequently become one of NASA's principles. Speaking of the errors and overall attitude surrounding the Apollo program before the accident, he stated: [...] "We were too 'gung-ho' about the schedule and we blocked out <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>problems</b> we saw each day in our work. Every element of the program was in trouble and so were we." [...] He reminded the team of the perils and mercilessness of their endeavor, and stated the new requirement that every member of every team in mission control be [...] "tough and competent", requiring nothing less than perfection throughout NASA's programs. In 2003, following the Space Shuttle Columbia disaster, NASA administrator Sean O'Keefe quoted Kranz's speech, applying it to the Columbia crew.|$|E

Mohammad's family rejoice when Saddam Hussein is sentenced, and feel that his later execution was justified, as to do otherwise would have made the Iraqi people look weak. Conversely, Anmar's family is upset at his execution, as they feel that the people who came into power were no better than Hussein was. Hyder's mother says that many Iraqi people were hopeful about the arrival of American forces, and that it is wrong to blame America for <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>problems</b> in Iraq. She notes that the bloodshed has yet to stop as the Sunni continues to kill the Shiite, and vice versa.

2500|$|McNabb led {{his team}} against the New England Patriots in Super Bowl XXXIX. McNabb {{struggled}} at times, throwing three crucial interceptions. Two {{of these were}} thrown in New England territory, {{and one of those}} two was inside the twenty-yard line. The final interception was during a last-gasp Hail Mary {{at the end of the}} game. He was also sacked four times. Controversy surrounded the end of the game, as center Hank Fraley claimed that McNabb was seriously ill. Wide receiver Freddie Mitchell claimed that he had to call a few plays due to McNabb's illness. However, in an interview with NBC, McNabb said he was not sick and did not throw up. He just said he was tired. Some reports claim that McNabb had the wind knocked out of him by an earlier hit while others assert that he was unduly fatigued (interestingly, McNabb also suffered from a bout of nausea at the conclusion of a 2002 regular-season game played at Alltel Stadium, where Super Bowl XXXIX was contested). An article written by a staff member of The Philadelphia Inquirer refuted allegations of McNabb throwing up during the Super Bowl and even labeled the alleged incident [...] "a myth". Both head coach Andy Reid and McNabb have denied any physical problems that led to the puzzlingly slow pace of play. Despite <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>problems,</b> McNabb finished the game with 30 completions for 357 yards, the third highest total for both categories in Super Bowl history, and three touchdowns, the only points in the game for Philadelphia.
