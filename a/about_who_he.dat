[...] Furthermore, the site noted that [...] "the sound that takes you by surprise may be your own crying." [...] Novelist Lev Grossman, {{in an interview with}} NPR, praised the backstory of the Ice King and the exploration of his condition, noting that his origin is [...] "psychologically plausible." [...] Grossman praised {{the way the}} series was able to tackle the issues of mental illness, saying: [...] "It's very affecting. My dad has been going through having Alzheimer's, and he's forgotten so much <b>about</b> <b>who</b> <b>he</b> used to be. And I look at him and think this cartoon is about my father dying." ...|$|E

500|$|Chloe and Clark patch their {{relationship}} in the season three episode [...] "Whisper", after Clark discovers {{that she has been}} helping Lionel. When Chloe stops her investigation, Lionel has her fired from the Daily Planet, and also fires her father from his job at LuthorCorp. In season three's [...] "Forsaken", Chloe decides to assist Lex Luthor (Michael Rosenbaum), Lionel's son, with getting Lionel arrested for the murder of Lex' grandparents; Chloe's hope is to get out from under Lionel's control. In the season three finale, the F.B.I. place Chloe and her father in a safe-house until Lionel's trial; unfortunately, the safe-house explodes once Chloe and her father enter and they are presumed dead. Chloe's cousin, Lois Lane (Erica Durance), comes to Smallville to investigate Chloe's death in the fourth season premiere. In season four's [...] "Gone", Clark and Lois team-up and discover that Lex's security team found the explosives in the safe-house, pulled Chloe and her father to safety before they detonated, and that he has been hiding her ever since. After Chloe's testimony in the same episode, Lionel is convicted of murder and sentenced to life imprisonment.

500|$|Indecision {{over his}} {{sexuality}} in the episode [...] "Blame It on the Alcohol" [...] drew some negative reviews of Blaine. Reiter noted that, [...] "So much of Blaine's charm {{has been his}} certainty <b>about</b> <b>who</b> <b>he</b> is." [...] Though she found his subplot with Rachel [...] "fun", she commented: [...] "Blaine's overwrought speech in the coffee shop after Rachel asks him out just felt off-key. Saying 'bye' to the Blaine sexual-confusion storyline wouldn't make us angry at all." [...] Todd VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club also criticised the storyline, which, he wrote, [...] "seemed like it might be an interesting, complicated look at teenage sexuality {{and how it can}} seem formed but might be more fluid than most teens would give it credit for, then lost its nerve and took the easy way out." [...] AfterElton.com Chris O'Guinn felt that the only aspect of the storyline handled acceptably was Blaine questioning whether he was bisexual, rather than outright straight. He criticized the shallow examination of his feelings, and wrote: [...] "Bisexuality is such a contentious issue that it should not be fumbled this way. For a character to say 'maybe I'm bi' in one scene and then the next say, 'nope, definitely gay' is almost cruel in how dismissive it is toward bisexuals by trivializing the intense confusion that many bisexual people feel in coming to terms with their orientation." [...] In a more positive review, Canning opined that Blaine and Kurt's conversation about sexuality was [...] "great". He was [...] "glad it wasn't an easy talk for either of them" [...] and said that it [...] "felt very real for kids in this situation." ...|$|E
500|$|In [...] "The Born-Again Identity", it's {{revealed}} that Castiel survived. After the Leviathans left him, {{he made his}} way out of the river, naked, and ran into his future wife Daphne. However, the experience renders Castiel amnesic, but with his angelic powers intact. Going by the name [...] "Emanuel", Castiel used his powers to heal people, though he didn't know where that ability and his power to see demon's true faces came from. After Sam is committed to a mental hospital as a result of the hallucinations of Lucifer he is suffering due to Castiel breaking his [...] "mental wall", Dean searches for [...] "Emanuel" [...] and kills a demon that is holding his wife hostage. Castiel agrees to help Dean who doesn't tell him who he really is, but mentions what [...] "Cas" [...] had done to Sam. The two are joined by Meg, but upon reaching the hospital, find demons surrounding the entrance. As Castiel is the only one who can take them all down, Dean is forced to tell him the truth <b>about</b> <b>who</b> <b>he</b> really is and insists he has the power to kill the demons. Castiel manages to summon his power to kill demons and kills all of them, but doing so restores his memories. Castiel shows remorse for his previous actions and initially wants to leave, but Dean is able to convince him to help by giving him back his trench coat. Castiel finds Sam in time to save him from a demon torturing him to death with electro-shock therapy and tries to restore his mental wall, but can't as it's completely gone. Feeling sorry for what he had done, Castiel transfers the problem to himself and is haunted by visions of Lucifer like Sam was. Castiel is committed to the mental hospital, but is safe from the demons as only Meg knows he's alive and she takes a job at the hospital, presumably to look after him. In [...] "Party On, Garth", Dean calls Meg and she reveals that Castiel's in the same condition, which Sam feels guilty about.|$|E

2500|$|For the score, Giacchino felt no {{pressure}} to align his music with the style or tone of previous MCU films, and [...] "in fact they {{encouraged me to}} go in my direction, so there were never any handcuffs put on me." [...] In regards to the title character, Giacchino felt the key [...] "was getting inside of him—not worrying {{so much about the}} magic stuff, more just thinking <b>about</b> <b>who</b> <b>he</b> was as a person, what he lost and then how that loss affected him. For me it's a very sad story, {{and a lot of the}} music has this very melancholy feel to it." [...] To particularly differentiate the score, and help create a [...] "mystical mood", Giacchino used a harpsichord and an electric sitar.|$|E

2500|$|Veritaserum {{is a very}} {{powerful}} truth potion. The name [...] "Veritaserum" [...] derives from the Latin word Veritas, meaning truth. Three drops of this potion are all that is needed to force anyone to respond to any question with the truth. It is first used on Barty Crouch Jr. in Goblet of Fire, in Order of the Phoenix, Umbridge demands the potion to use it while interrogating Harry <b>about</b> <b>who</b> <b>he</b> contacted, but is thwarted by Snape who claims he has none left having given her an entire bottle earlier in the book (although that bottle was a placebo). In Half-Blood Prince, Harry considers using the potion to get Slughorn to reveal his memories about Voldemort, but thinks better of it; and in Deathly Hallows Rita Skeeter uses the potion to extract the story of Dumbledore's childhood from Bathilda Bagshot. Rowling has revealed on her fansite that Veritaserum can be fooled using Occlumency and is hence not usually accepted in general practice in wizard courts.|$|E
2500|$|SFX {{magazine}} named Angel as {{the third}} greatest vampire in television and film, with rival Spike in first place. They stated that, while he could have worked simply as a brooding love-interest (Buffy) or redemption-seeking hero (Angel), the character also has a [...] "wonderfully appealing, self-effacing humour, helped no end by Boreanaz's ability {{to look like a}} slapped puppy". While Angel could be [...] "big and hard and manly", he could also be [...] "sulky, pathetic, in need of a hug". They also cite his poor singing and dancing as examples of his [...] "amusing awkwardness", which [...] "spoke volumes <b>about</b> <b>who</b> <b>he</b> was". For his role in Buffy the Vampire Slayer Season Two, Whatculture placed Angelus at Number One on their list of Buffy Big Bads, alongside Spike and Drusilla, stating that having Buffy's lover become her enemy 'emphasiz the tragedy at the show’s centre that Buffy’s Slayer responsibilities mean she has to make difficult choices.' ...|$|E

Once they get there, the chapel is too trashy, and so they do not get married. Instead, they drive to L.A. and Lucas proposes to her in the same hotel room he did years before. The two are still in L.A. during Brooke's attack. After Brooke calls Peyton and sounds weird, Lucas and Peyton decide to head back to Tree Hill and have the wedding there instead.

She and Lucas have also set a date for their wedding, which causes conflict between Lucas and Lindsey with regards to the book tour for his second book.
