5|$|Argon-helium {{mixtures}} {{are also}} frequently utilized in GTAW, since they can increase {{control of the}} heat input while maintaining the benefits of using argon. Normally, the mixtures are made with primarily helium (often about 75% or higher) and a balance of argon. These mixtures increase the speed {{and quality of the}} AC welding of aluminum, and also make it easier to strike an arc. Another shielding gas mixture, argon-hydrogen, is used in the mechanized welding of light gauge stainless steel, but because hydrogen can cause porosity, its uses are limited. Similarly, nitrogen can sometimes be added to argon to help stabilize the austenite in <b>austenitic</b> <b>stainless</b> <b>steels</b> and increase penetration when welding copper. Due to porosity problems in ferritic steels and limited benefits, however, it is not a popular shielding gas additive.|$|E
500|$|For GTAW {{of carbon}} and {{stainless}} steels, {{the selection of}} a filler material is important to prevent excessive porosity. Oxides on the filler material and workpieces must be removed before welding to prevent contamination, and immediately prior to welding, alcohol or acetone should be used to clean the surface. Preheating is generally not necessary for mild steels less than one inch thick, but low alloy steels may require preheating to slow the cooling process and prevent the formation of martensite in the heat-affected zone. [...] Tool steels should also be preheated to prevent cracking in the heat-affected zone. <b>Austenitic</b> <b>stainless</b> <b>steels</b> do not require preheating, but martensitic and ferritic chromium stainless steels do. A DCEN power source is normally used, and thoriated electrodes, tapered to a sharp point, are recommended. Pure argon is used for thin workpieces, but helium can be introduced as thickness increases.|$|E
2500|$|Some <b>austenitic</b> <b>stainless</b> <b>steels</b> and nickel-based alloys {{are prone}} to {{intergranular}} corrosion. When subjected to temperatures around [...] for too long a time, chromium reacts with carbon in the material, forming chromium carbide and depleting the crystal edges of chromium, impairing their corrosion resistance in a process called sensitization. Such sensitized steel undergoes corrosion in the areas near the welds where the temperature-time was favorable for forming the carbide. This kind of corrosion is often termed weld decay.|$|E

40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} paper {{is focused on the}} surface roughness variation in high speed fine turning of the <b>austenitic</b> <b>stainless</b> <b>steel.</b> Design/methodology/approach: A series of experimental tests have been done to evaluate the possibility of high speed fine turning of the <b>austenitic</b> <b>stainless</b> <b>steel</b> from the surface roughness variation and machining stability. Findings: It was found that, the smaller the feed rate, the smaller the surface roughness value. But when the feed rate smaller than the critical feed rate, the chatter will occurs and the surface roughness of the work piece would be deteriorated. The higher the cutting speed is, the higher the cutting temperature of cutting tool is. The cutting tool will be soften and the surface roughness of the workpiece will be deteriorated. Research limitations/implications: The tool chattering would caused poor surface roughness in high speed fine turning for feed rate smaller than 0. 02 mm/rev. The chatter suppression method must be considered when high speed fine turning of <b>austenitic</b> <b>stainless</b> <b>steel.</b> Originality/value: Most of the <b>stainless</b> <b>steel</b> machining proceeds at low cutting speed because the <b>austenitic</b> <b>stainless</b> <b>steel</b> is a hard machining material.

50|$|Several {{methods have}} been used to control or {{minimize}} the intergranular corrosion of susceptible alloys, particularly of the <b>austenitic</b> <b>stainless</b> <b>steels.</b> For example, a high-temperature solution heat treatment, commonly termed solution-annealing, quench-annealing or solution-quenching, has been used.

40|$|Abstract. Coating is an {{effective}} method to solve the contradiction between the wear resistance and the toughness for tool materials and the coated tool can yield satisfied cutting performances. Now the coated high-speed steel (HSS) drill is widely used in drilling of <b>stainless</b> <b>steel.</b> This paper studied the tool life of the TiN, the TiAlN and the TiCN coated special drills in drilling <b>austenitic</b> <b>stainless</b> <b>steel</b> 1 Cr 18 Ni 9 Ti through contrastive experiments. The tool life of the TiN coated drill was only 81. 5 % of TiCN, and 66 % of TiAlN because of its low oxidization resistance and hardness. The wearing features of TiAlN and TiCN coating were also studied by experiments and the different wear mechanisms were revealed. Finally the comparison of cutting performance was given between TiAlN and TiCN coated drills and recommendation of coating selection for drilling <b>austenitic</b> <b>stainless</b> <b>steel</b> was also presented. TiCN coating is suitable for HSS cutting tool base, which is often used for drilling <b>austenitic</b> <b>stainless</b> <b>steel</b> at low speed.
