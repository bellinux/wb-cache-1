25|$|In 1970, the Montreal Urban Community (MUC) was created. This {{group was}} made of {{municipalities}} that occupy the Island of Montreal {{and the city of}} Montreal was the biggest participant.

The MUC Transportation Commission was thus created {{at the same time to}} serve <b>as</b> <b>prime</b> <b>contractor</b> for the Metro extensions.

25|$|The THAAD {{missile defense}} concept was {{proposed}} in 1987, with a formal {{request for proposals}} submitted to industry in 1991. In September 1992, the US Army selected Martin Marietta (now Lockheed Martin) <b>as</b> <b>prime</b> <b>contractor</b> for THAAD development. Prior to development of a physical prototype, the Aero-Optical Effect (AOE) software code was developed to validate the intended operational profile of Lockheed's proposed design. The first THAAD flight test occurred in April 1995, with all flight tests in the Demonstration-Validation (DEM-VAL) program phase occurring at White Sands Missile Range. The first six intercept attempts missed the target (Flights4–9). The first successful intercepts were conducted on 10 June 1999, and 2 August 1999, against Hera missiles.|$|E
500|$|During Mondale's 1967 {{questioning}} {{about what}} was to become known as the [...] "Phillips Report", Seamans was afraid Mondale might actually have seen a hard copy of Phillips' presentation, and responded that contractors have occasionally been subjected to on-site progress reviews; perhaps this was what Mondale's information referred to. Mondale continued to refer to [...] "the Report" [...] despite Phillips' refusal to characterize it as such, and angered by what he perceived as Webb's deception and concealment of important program problems from Congress, he questioned NASA's selection of North American <b>as</b> <b>prime</b> <b>contractor.</b> Seamans later wrote that Webb roundly chastised him in the cab ride leaving the hearing, for volunteering information which led to the disclosure of Phillips' memo.|$|E

The carriers, expected to remain in service for fifty years, were designed for but not with catapults and arrestor wires. The carriers were thus planned to be [...] "future proof", allowing them to operate a generation of CATOBAR aircraft beyond the F-35.

In this type of sale, however, there are two important aspects in regards to the offset business.|$|R
