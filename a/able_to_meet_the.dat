5|$|Just {{before the}} Japanese {{surrender}} {{that ended the}} war, News-Miner editor David Tewkesbury died. He was replaced by Art Bremer, a reporter. The post-war boom caused a sudden shortage of newsprint, as paper mills were not <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>meet</b> <b>the</b> demand {{of a growing number}} of newspapers nationwide. This shortage caused the News-Miner to run short until Lathrop used his industrial connections to divert a shipment from a newspaper that was going out of business.|$|E
5|$|A German {{victory on}} the Battle of Britain Day was unlikely. It {{could only have}} been {{possible}} if Park had made crass errors and had been caught on the ground. Stephen Bungay postulates that had the loss rates been reversed, Dowding could have replaced those with reinforcements from his C units and carried on. Moreover, during both major engagements Fighter Command had used less than ½ of its strength. It would have been <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>meet</b> <b>the</b> Luftwaffe again on the morrow.|$|E
5|$|Upon U-2s completion, the Austro-Hungarian Navy {{conducted}} {{trials of}} the submarine throughout most of 1910. U-2s gasoline engines were never <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>meet</b> <b>the</b> speed {{called for in the}} contract during the Navy evaluations, and were considered not suitable for wartime use. As a result, the Navy only paid for U-2s hull and armament, and arranged a lease of the gasoline engines while replacement diesel engines were ordered from the Austrian firm Maschinenfabrik Leobersdorf. Despite the engine problems, U-2 and her sister ship had the best performance in diving and steering amongst the U-boats under evaluation by the Navy.|$|E

50|$|How did {{the ancients}} dig the Tunnel of Samos from two {{opposite}} sides of a mountain in 500 BCE? And how were they <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>meet</b> under <b>the</b> mountain? Maybe they used geometry and trigonometry.|$|R
5|$|In New Guinea, {{logistics}} {{and construction}} activities were coordinated by task force engineer staffs. These were often hastily assembled {{and had not}} always been <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>meet</b> <b>the</b> demands imposed by base development in such a challenging theater of operations. The scale of operations in the Philippines was much greater, so for this purpose the Army Service Command (ASCOM) was formed in Brisbane on 23 July 1944. Casey was appointed to command ASCOM. In his absence, Sverdrup became MacArthur's chief engineer. Although part of USASOS, ASCOM operated {{under the control of}} Sixth Army, moving as far forward as combat operations allowed, developed new bases, and operated them until USASOS was ready to take over, at which point the units under ASCOM simply reverted to USASOS, allowing a seamless transfer of command. For the Battle of Leyte Casey's ASCOM had 43,000 men, of whom 21,000 were engineers.|$|E
5|$|Securely {{attached}} {{children are}} {{best able to}} explore when they have the knowledge of a secure base (their caregiver) to return to in times of need. When assistance is given, this bolsters the sense of security and also, assuming the parent's assistance is helpful, educates the child in {{how to cope with}} the same problem in the future. Therefore, secure attachment {{can be seen as the}} most adaptive attachment style. According to some psychological researchers, a child becomes securely attached when the parent is available and <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>meet</b> <b>the</b> needs of the child in a responsive and appropriate manner. At infancy and early childhood, if parents are caring and attentive towards their children, those children will be more prone to secure attachment.|$|E
5|$|Upon U-1s completion, the Austro-Hungarian Navy {{conducted}} {{trials of}} the submarine throughout most of 1910. On 5 April both of U-1s electric motors were damaged in a flooding incident during her trials. U-1s gasoline engines were never <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>meet</b> <b>the</b> speed {{called for in the}} contract during the Navy evaluations, and were considered not suitable for wartime use. As a result, the Navy only paid for U-1s hull and armament, and arranged a lease of the gasoline engines while replacement diesel engines were ordered from the Austrian firm Maschinenfabrik Leobersdorf. Despite the engine problems, U-1 and her sister ship had the best performance in diving and steering amongst the U-boats under evaluation by the Navy.|$|E
50|$|Following the walkouts, {{students}} were <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>meet</b> with <b>the</b> board of education. At this meeting, student leaders presented {{a list of}} demands that addressed what they felt were the most pressing issues within their schools that effected their education.|$|R

50|$|Ethernet is {{a fairly}} simple {{protocol}} which has scaled {{to hundreds of thousands}} of times faster speeds and consistently been <b>able</b> <b>to</b> adapt <b>to</b> <b>meet</b> <b>the</b> needs and demands of new markets. For example, time domain capabilities are being added to IEEE 802.3 Ethernet to support IEEE 802.1 Audio Video Bridging (AVB), and these capabilities will be applicable to time sensitive carrier applications likewise IEEE 1588.|$|R
5|$|The West Coast offices {{had wanted}} {{a test case}} to take to court, but had a {{difficult}} time finding a Japanese American who was both willing to violate the internment orders and <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>meet</b> <b>the</b> ACLU's desired criteria of a sympathetic, Americanized plaintiff. Of the 120,000 Japanese Americans affected by the order, only 12 disobeyed, and Korematsu, Hirabayashi, and two others were the only resisters whose cases eventually made it to the Supreme Court. Hirabayashi v. United States came before the Court in May 1943, and the justices upheld the government's right to exclude Japanese Americans from the West Coast; although it had earlier forced its local office in L.A. to stop aiding Hirabayashi, the ACLU donated $1,000 to the case (over a third of the legal team's total budget) and submitted an amicus brief. Besig, dissatisfied with Osmond Fraenkel's tamer defense, filed an additional amicus brief that directly addressed Hirabayashi's constitutional rights. In the meantime, A.L. Wirin served as one of the attorneys in Yasui v. United States (decided the same day as the Hirabayashi case, and with the same results), but he kept his arguments within the perimeters established by the national office. The only case to receive a favorable ruling, ex parte Endo, was also aided by two amicus briefs from the ACLU, one from the more conservative Fraenkel and another from the more putative Wayne Collins.|$|E
5|$|The decade {{following}} {{ratification of}} the PTBT (1963–72) featured more US nuclear tests than the decade prior (1953–62). In the following decade, the US conducted 385 nuclear tests and 23 peaceful nuclear explosions (PNEs), versus 268 tests and three PNEs in the preceding decade. In contrast, the number of Soviet detonations fell from 218 in the preceding decade to 157 in the following decade, as the Soviet Union was never <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>meet</b> <b>the</b> pace of US underground explosions. China and France, both non-signatories, conducted 53 tests between 1963 and 1973. In all, 436 tests were conducted between {{the signing of the}} PTBT and 1 July 1973, compared to 499 tests between 16 July 1945 and the signing of the PTBT. In the 1960s and 1970s, China conducted 22 atmospheric tests and France conducted 50. The last atmospheric test was conducted by China in 1980, after French atmospheric testing stopped in 1974. Public opposition to nuclear testing continued following the treaty's enactment. Greenpeace was founded in 1971 in opposition to a planned underground test on the Alaskan island of Amchitka. In 1982, a Greenpeace ship docked at Leningrad without permission demanding that the Soviet Union stop testing.|$|E
25|$|In {{the case}} of a fossil fueled {{cogeneration}} plant, the heat output is typically sized to meet half of the peak heat load but over the year will provide 90% of the heat supplied. The boiler capacity will be <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>meet</b> <b>the</b> entire heat demand unaided and can cover for breakdowns in the cogeneration plant. It is not economic to size the cogeneration plant alone to be <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>meet</b> <b>the</b> full heat load. In the New York City steam system, that is around 2.5 GW. Germany has the largest amount of CHP in Europe.|$|E

Jeleński, Józef Czapski, Witold Gombrowicz, Gustaw Herling-Grudziński, Jerzy Stempowski and Czesław Miłosz; he {{embarked}} on promoting and interpreting their writings.|$|E
25|$|An initial {{request for}} {{proposal}} (RFP) to build the NBN was issued but not proceeded with. Those organisations lodging compliant proposals were not <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>meet</b> <b>the</b> requirements nor able to raise the necessary capital. A non-compliant proposal was received from Telstra and they were excluded from consideration.|$|E

25|$|The {{evolution}} of her reputation {{is a case}} study in the maxim that each age creates its own history. If Eleanor of Castile can no longer be seen as a paradigm of queenly virtues, her career can now be examined as the achievement of an intelligent and determined woman who was <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>meet</b> <b>the</b> challenges of an exceptionally demanding life.|$|E
25|$|Access, however, is {{not always}} {{automatically}} granted to general upper secondary programmes. If a school finds that the pupil and their parents are not taking the education and guidance provided seriously, and/or {{that there is a}} risk that the pupil will not be <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>meet</b> <b>the</b> requirements of the general upper secondary programmes, the pupil may be recommended to sit for an admission test to one of the general upper secondary programmes.|$|E
25|$|Scholars and {{agencies}} have suggested various strategies to help street children, {{many of which}} focus {{on the use of}} NGOs. A.B. Bose of UNICEF and Sarah Thomas de Benitez of the Consortium for Street Children suggest that the main responsibility of assistance should be given to NGOs, which should be backed financially by the government. Because NGOs have the ability to be more flexible than the government, they are better <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>meet</b> <b>the</b> needs of street children in varied circumstances.|$|E
50|$|For the Eco to be implemented, ten {{convergence}} criteria, set {{out by the}} West African Monetary Institute (WAMI), must be met.

50|$|There was {{a change}} to the blind auditions format for 2017; if all the coaches reject an auditionee they keep their back to the singer and will not say what they thought about their performance, as well as not being <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>meet</b> them. <b>The</b> blind auditions began filming on 19 October 2016 at MediaCity UK in Salford.|$|R
25|$|Oman {{announced}} in December 2006 {{it would not}} be <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>meet</b> <b>the</b> 2010 target date for a common currency. Following the announcement that the central bank for the monetary union would be located in Riyadh and not in the UAE, the UAE announced their withdrawal from the monetary union project in May 2009. The name Khaleeji has been proposed as a name for this currency. If realised, the GCC monetary union would be the second largest supranational monetary union in the world, measured by GDP of the common-currency area.|$|E
25|$|When I {{returned}} to IP in 1962 {{as president and}} editor-in-chief the house faced bankruptcy. Its publishing program had practically ceased, its debt to the publishers' services was so great without any prospect of payment in sight that the printers refused to undertake new work and the binders refused to release our books in stock. Fortunately, Trachty had some reserve funds that I drew upon immediately. I also arranged small loans {{from a number of}} our devoted readers. I also sent out an unprecedented appeal for donations to keep the publishing house going. We were thus <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>meet</b> <b>the</b> payroll and office expenses, and also to pay off enough of our debt to resume publishing.|$|E
25|$|In July 2007, the Vancouver Ravens were conditionally {{approved}} for a 2008 return; the conditions included selling at least 2,500 season tickets {{and finding a}} suitable arena lease by July 19, 2007. On July 16, 2007, the Vancouver Ravens announced an agreement with Orca Bay Sports and Entertainment to make GM Place (now Rogers Arena) the home venue of the Ravens, if they were <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>meet</b> <b>the</b> season ticket sales requirement. However, {{just a few days}} later, tnnounced that the Ravens would not play in the 2008 season. Although a local tabloid made mention of a potential return in 2011 for the team, Commissioner Daniel announced {{that there would be no}} expansion in 2011.|$|E
