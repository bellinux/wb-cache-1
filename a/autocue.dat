500|$|In {{addition}} to his vocal ability, Dickinson {{is known for his}} energetic stage performances, which he delivers consistently despite his age. He considers including the audience [...] "the essence of the Maiden experience" [...] and that his role is to [...] "shrink the venue ... to turn that football stadium into the world's smallest club." [...] To achieve this, Dickinson insists on gaining eye contact with audience members and urges them to join in with the phrase [...] "scream for me" [...] (followed by the concert's location). He is critical of performers who do not connect with their fans, particularly those who [...] " [...] behind the amps" [...] and use an <b>autocue,</b> remarking that [...] "people pay good money and [...] can't even remember the sodding words." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Some Kind of Bliss" [...] {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from most music critics, but received positive reviews in retrospect. Writing for NME in November 1997, Ben Willmott called it [...] "supremely irritating" [...] and stated [...] "Kylie belts out the lyrics like she's reading from an <b>autocue.</b> Any soul {{is lost in}} a slurry of bought-in brass and a ropey guitar solo that's be more at home on a Shakin' Stevens record." [...] John Magnan from The Age said while the song was a stand out to the album, it [...] "is {{actually one of the}} album's clunkier tracks". Jaime Gill from Yahoo! Music reviewed her Ultimate Kylie compilation album, and criticised the musical composition by calling it a [...] "awkward faux-rock". Matt James from PopMatters reviewed her compilation The Best of Kylie Minogue and was disappointed with [...] "Some Kind of Bliss"' absence, labelling it a [...] "lost classic". Larry Flick from Billboard was positive, saying [...] "Ms. Minogue has been reborn as an alterna-pop vixen to be reckoned with." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1989, she co-presented the Brit Awards with Mick Fleetwood, {{which became}} notorious for {{turning into a}} shambles; Fox has {{asserted}} in interviews since that the <b>autocue</b> did not work properly that night. She {{spent a year in}} New York City presenting pop promotional videos for MTV, and she made other attempts at TV presenting, including an interview with Rolf Harris, which was ill-fated even before it started, as Fox referred to her interviewee as [...] "Ralph" [...] on several occasions, annoying Harris.|$|E
2500|$|Donald like Plato (and Aristotle, {{especially}} in On Memory and Recollection), emphasizes the peculiarity in humans of voluntary initiation of a search through one's mental world. The ancient Greek anamnēsis, normally translated as [...] "recollection" [...] {{was opposed to}} mneme or memory. Memory, shared with some animals, requires a consciousness not only {{of what happened in}} the past, but also that something happened in the past, which is in other words a kind of eikasia [...] "...but nothing except man is able to recollect." [...] Recollection is a deliberate effort to search for and recapture something once known. Klein writes that, [...] "To become aware of our having forgotten something means to begin recollecting." [...] Donald calls the same thing <b>autocueing,</b> which he explains as follows: [...] "Mimetic acts are reproducible on the basis of internal, self-generated cues. This permits voluntary recall of mimetic representations, without the aid of external cues – probably the earliest form of representational thinking." ...|$|R
40|$|This article {{explores the}} {{portability}} of a coreference resolver across {{a variety of}} eight text genres. Besides newspaper text, we also include administrative texts, <b>autocues,</b> texts used for external communication, instructive texts, wikipedia texts, medical texts and unedited new media texts. Three sets of experiments were conducted. First, we investigated each text genre individually, and studied the effect of larger training set sizes and including genre-specific training material. Then, we explored the predictive power of each genre for the other genres conducting cross-domain experiments. In a final step, we investigated whether excluding genres with less predictive power increases overall performance. For all experiments we use an existing Dutch mention-pair resolver and report on our experimental results using four metrics: MUC, B-cubed, CEAF and BLANC. We show that resolving out-of-domain genres works best when enough training data is included. This effect is further intensified by including a small amount of genre-specific text. As far as the cross-domain performance is concerned we see that especially genres of a very specific nature tend to have less generalization power. ...|$|R
5000|$|In week 3, Murs apologised after {{claiming}} that Michael had been eliminated {{when in fact}} the judges' vote had gone to deadlock {{and the result was}} yet to be announced; in any case, Michael was revealed afterwards to have received the fewest votes and was sent home. Murs said: [...] "I apologise to everyone tonight I made a massive f--k up at the end. It was so tense!! I'm still learning & hope that never happens again!" [...] Isabel Mohan from The Daily Telegraph said, [...] "We were always dreading Flack and Murs taking over from Dermot O'Leary—we knew they wouldn't be able to hack it live on primetime telly. Dermot could build up tension. Dermot could read <b>autocues.</b> Dermot could speak properly with no lazy talk of 'the bottom free'. And, most of all, Dermot didn't tell people they'd been voted off before he was supposed to! ... What an absolute shambles." [...] O'Leary supported Murs on Twitter, saying it [...] "Happens to us all" [...] and [...] "live TV is a tricky old beast at times." ...|$|R
2500|$|All {{broadcast}} media {{is owned by}} the government except for MM which is the only private TV in Burma. The Video Act of 1985 outlined what media could tape. There are seven TV stations in Myanmar, of which, MTV1 and MTV2 are the main channels. And another channel by government is MRTV. MRTV-3 is an English-language channel aimed at an international audience. During the 2007 protests, the stations were used to broadcast messages critical of foreign media. (...) Due to lack of equipment, newsreaders often have to read directly off their notes instead of an <b>autocue.</b>|$|E
2500|$|On 20 February 2008, Sharon Osbourne co-hosted the 28th {{edition of}} the BRIT Awards at Earls Court in London, {{along with her husband}} and {{daughter}} Kelly. During the awards Osbourne caused controversy and sparked complaints by calling Vic Reeves, who was presenting one of the awards, a [...] "piss head" [...] and a [...] "bastard" [...] after he appeared to be drunk, although he claimed that he was having trouble reading the <b>autocue.</b> On 22 August 2008, Osbourne took part in the 2008 MediaGuardian Edinburgh International Television Festival in Scotland. In 2009 she co-hosted WWE Raw with her husband Ozzy.|$|E
2500|$|Between 1996 and 1998, Monkhouse {{presented}} the National Lottery show on Saturday evenings on BBC One {{for which he}} created the catchphrase: [...] "I know I'm a sinner, but make me a winner!" [...] The opening to each show would see him deliver several minutes of topical jokes and on one occasion, where his <b>autocue</b> failed, he improvised a new and topical routine. This talent was used in Bob Monkhouse on the Spot, a return to pure television comedy, in which audience members suggested topics and Monkhouse {{came up with a}} routine. Monkhouse returned to quizzes when he took over hosting duties on Wipeout from Paul Daniels, when its studio recordings moved from London to Manchester and the show moved from primetime to daytime. Monkhouse hosted Wipeout between 1998 and 2003.|$|E
2500|$|The museum {{occupies}} a site originally proposed for a theatre in central Bradford, for which work {{begun in the}} 1960s remained unfinished. [...] Resulting from discussions between Dame Margaret Weston of the Science Museum, London and Bradford city councillors, the National Museum of Photography, Film and Television, {{as it was then}} called, opened on 16 June 1983. [...] The museum launched Britain’s largest cinema screen, IMAX, five storeys high with six-channel sound, on the same day. [...] During this period the museum specialised in the art and science of images and image-making since Colin Ford, its first director, believed that understanding how images are made led to appreciation of the ideas expressed and the intentions and skills of image-makers. [...] To mark the 50th anniversary of the first public television service, two interactive television galleries were developed in 1986. These allowed visitors to operate cameras on a studio set with programmed sound and lighting, use vision mixers, read a news item from an <b>autocue</b> and discover how chroma keying works.|$|E

5000|$|After Vic Reeves {{appeared}} to forget which award he was presenting, Sharon Osbourne attempted to wrestle the microphone from him, insisted {{he was drunk}} and called him a [...] "pissed bastard". She proceeded to make the full announcement herself. The next day {{it was reported that}} Reeves was not intoxicated and was hurt by Osbourne's behaviour. The incident has since been ascribed to an <b>autocue</b> malfunction, but Reeves said in his defence {{that he was trying to}} read the <b>autocue</b> screen, but he couldn't read it because Osbourne was pushing him out of the way.|$|E

5000|$|On 20 February 2008, Reeves {{appeared}} onstage at the BRIT Awards {{to present}} the [...] "Mastercard British Album" [...] award to the Arctic Monkeys. He was visibly disorientated and co-host Sharon Osbourne called him a [...] "pissed bastard" [...] and repeatedly told him to [...] "piss off". There have been claims by the Sun newspaper that Reeves' addled state was due to his <b>autocue</b> failing. In ITV's Teletext music magazine Planet Sound interview, which took place half {{an hour after the}} show, Reeves stated {{that he was trying to}} read the <b>autocue,</b> and was pushed away by Osbourne while trying to do his job.

5000|$|The {{technique}} used by Robbie Cooper for Immersion {{is inspired by}} a method developed by documentary filmmaker Errol Morris. Known as the Interrotron method, Morris used the process to interview people directly through the camera lens. A modified <b>autocue,</b> the Interrotron uses a one-way mirror to reflect an image towards the viewer whilst they gaze into the camera. Morris connected a live video feed of himself into the Interrotron so he could ask questions and the interviewee could retain direct eye contact with him, whilst expressing themselves straight to the camera and the audience. Cooper adapted this approach, plugging video games consoles and computers into the <b>autocue,</b> as well as creating a studio environment which he has described as an [...] "anti-shoot", in which the attention of subjects is diverted away from {{the purpose of the}} activity. In 2011 Cooper worked as a consultant on the Godfrey Reggio/Philip Glass movie [...] "Visitors", which used the technique extensively.|$|E

It was McDonald's first appearance in any capacity on the show since 1992.|$|E
