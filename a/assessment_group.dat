Main outcome measure: Incremental cost effectiveness ratios. Results: Data from 27 of the 62 appraisals could be compared.

Restriction of this dataset to include only one pairwise comparison per appraisal (27 pairs) produced a similar result (21 were lower, two were the same, four were higher, P < 0. 001). Conclusions: The estimated incremental cost effectiveness ratios submitted by manufacturers were on average significantly lower than those submitted by the <b>assessment</b> <b>groups.</b> These results show that an important role of NICE's appraisal committee, and of decision makers in general, is to determine which economic evaluations, or parts of evaluations, should be given more credence...|$|R
500|$|Although the Standard Model of {{particle}} physics predicts that LHC energies {{are far too}} low to create black holes, some extensions of the Standard Model posit the existence of extra spatial dimensions, in which {{it would be possible}} to create micro black holes at the LHC at a rate of the order of one per second. According to the standard calculations these are harmless because they would quickly decay by Hawking radiation. Hawking radiation is a thermal radiation predicted to be emitted by black holes due to quantum effects. Because Hawking radiation allows black holes to lose mass, black holes that lose more matter than they gain through other means are expected to dissipate, shrink, and ultimately vanish. Smaller micro black holes (MBHs), which could be produced at the LHC, are currently predicted by theory to be larger net emitters of radiation than larger black holes, and to shrink and dissipate instantly. The LHC Safety <b>Assessment</b> <b>Group</b> (LSAG) indicates that [...] "there is broad consensus among physicists on the reality of Hawking radiation, but so far no experiment has had the sensitivity required to find direct evidence for it." ...|$|E

On , in light of new experimental data and theoretical understanding, the LSAG issued a report updating the 2003 safety review, in which they reaffirmed and extended its conclusions that [...] "LHC collisions present no danger and that there are no reasons for concern". The LSAG report was then reviewed by CERN’s Scientific Policy Committee (SPC), {{a group of}} external scientists that advises CERN’s governing body, its Council. The report was reviewed and endorsed by a panel of five independent scientists, Peter Braun-Munzinger, Matteo Cavalli-Sforza, Gerard 't Hooft, Bryan Webber and Fabio Zwirner, and their conclusions were unanimously approved by the full 20 members of the SPC.

2500|$|Despite {{the fact}} that Dundalk FC had won what they {{perceived}} to be, or believed should have been, the annual promotion/relegation play-off, and {{what would have been}} a promotion/relegation game in any other normal season, in November 2006, they were one of the teams omitted from the 2007 Premier Division and were, instead, chosen to play in the First Division. Dundalk argued that it had a right to compete in the Premier Division following their play-off victory over Waterford United. [...] "What was the point of the league taking our players and fans {{all the way down to}} Waterford if it counted for nothing?" [...] questioned one official, while reports in the local and national press described the decision to exclude Dundalk from the Premier Division as [...] "scandalous" [...] and [...] "an injustice". However, as far as the FAI and the Independent <b>Assessment</b> <b>Group</b> (IAG) were concerned Dundalk's protests had no real weight, their contention was that the 2006 play-offs had never been billed as a promotion/relegation fixture, but rather as a means to determine which teams were to be positioned in 12th and 13th place within the overall standings for the 2006 season. As such, the play-offs actually contributed points to Dundalk's final assessment tally, though sadly for Dundalk and its fans, just not enough. A double blow for Dundalk came when the IAG's report placed Galway United, who finished the season in 3rd place behind Dundalk, in 12th position; thus Galway were selected for the new Premier Division ahead of Dundalk. This infuriated many Dundalk supporters and proved to be the final straw for one particularly disgruntled fan. On 13 December 2006, Mark Kavanagh, known locally as [...] "Maxi", dismayed by the Independent Assessment Group's decision, entered the former headquarters of the FAI at Merrion Square, doused the reception area with petrol and threatened to set it alight. After a tense hour-long stand-off, the situation ended peacefully when the Dundalk manager, John Gill, spoke with Kavanagh and persuaded him to end his protest. In late December 2006, Dundalk's CEO, Gerry Matthews, met with the FAI and members of IAG committee. He acknowledged that they had a [...] "very hard job to do and did it with the utmost integrity and respect for Dundalk". Matthews expressed his satisfaction with the process and said that he and the club were [...] "happy to move on".|$|E

Methods: Following attendance at an education and orientation group, 211 participants were randomized to either a <b>group</b> <b>assessment</b> format (focused on supported self-assessment) or individual assessment. Follow-up occurred 3 months post-assessment and prior to subsequent pain service intervention.

Results: Seventy-two participants undertook <b>group</b> <b>assessment</b> and 90 were assessed individually. Follow-up data were collected on 57 group and 72 individual assessment participants.
