5|$|The {{study of}} {{homotopy}} groups of spheres builds {{on a great}} deal of background material, here briefly reviewed. <b>Algebraic</b> <b>topology</b> provides the larger context, itself built on topology and abstract algebra, with homotopy groups as a basic example.|$|E
5|$|In the {{mathematical}} field of <b>algebraic</b> <b>topology,</b> the homotopy groups of spheres describe how spheres of various dimensions can wrap around each other. They {{are examples of}} topological invariants, which reflect, in algebraic terms, the structure of spheres viewed as topological spaces, forgetting about their precise geometry. Unlike homology groups, which are also topological invariants, the homotopy groups are surprisingly complex and difficult to compute.|$|E
5|$|In mathematics, {{particularly}} <b>algebraic</b> <b>topology</b> and homology theory, the Mayer–Vietoris {{sequence is}} an algebraic tool to help compute algebraic invariants of topological spaces, known as their homology and cohomology groups. The result {{is due to}} two Austrian mathematicians, Walther Mayer and Leopold Vietoris. The method consists of splitting a space into subspaces, for which the homology or cohomology groups may be easier to compute. The sequence relates the (co)homology groups of the space to the (co)homology groups of the subspaces. It is a natural long exact sequence, whose entries are the (co)homology groups of the whole space, the direct sum of the (co)homology groups of the subspaces, and the (co)homology groups of {{the intersection of the}} subspaces.|$|E

5|$|Mayer was {{introduced}} to topology by his colleague Vietoris when attending his lectures in 1926 and 1927 at a local university in Vienna. He was told about the conjectured result {{and a way to}} its solution, and solved the question for the Betti numbers in 1929. He applied his results to the torus considered as the union of two cylinders. Vietoris later proved the full result for the homology groups in 1930 but did not express it as an exact sequence. The concept of an exact sequence only appeared in print in the 1952 book Foundations of <b>Algebraic</b> <b>Topology</b> by Samuel Eilenberg and Norman Steenrod where the results of Mayer and Vietoris were expressed in the modern form.|$|E
5|$|Groups {{are also}} applied {{in many other}} {{mathematical}} areas. Mathematical objects are often examined by associating groups to them and studying {{the properties of the}} corresponding groups. For example, Henri Poincaré founded what is now called <b>algebraic</b> <b>topology</b> by introducing the fundamental group. By means of this connection, topological properties such as proximity and continuity translate into properties of groups. For example, elements of the fundamental group are represented by loops. The second image at the right shows some loops in a plane minus a point. The blue loop is considered null-homotopic (and thus irrelevant), because it can be continuously shrunk to a point. The presence of the hole prevents the orange loop from being shrunk to a point. The fundamental group of the plane with a point deleted turns out to be infinite cyclic, generated by the orange loop (or any other loop winding once around the hole). This way, the fundamental group detects the hole.|$|E
25|$|Although <b>algebraic</b> <b>topology</b> {{primarily}} uses algebra {{to study}} topological problems, using topology to solve algebraic problems is sometimes also possible. <b>Algebraic</b> <b>topology,</b> for example, {{allows for a}} convenient proof that any subgroup of a free group is again a free group.|$|E
