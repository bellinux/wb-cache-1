2500|$|On 14 June 1960, Air Force Secretary Dudley C. Sharp {{announced}} in Washington, D.C., that testing {{and development of}} the Douglas GAM-87 Skybolt <b>air-to-surface</b> <b>ballistic</b> <b>missile</b> had been assigned to Eglin AFB. [...] "While preliminary activity will start immediately at Eglin on the Sky Bolt [...] project, the program is not expected to reach full scale {{for at least a year}} or two." [...] Ultimately, however, a series of test failures and the development of submarine-launched ballistic missiles (SLBMs) eventually leads to its cancellation in December 1962.|$|E
25|$|Arms control {{formed an}} {{integral}} part of Brown's national security policy. He staunchly supported the June 1979 SALT II treaty between the United States and the Soviet Union and was the administration's leading spokesman in urging the Senate to approve it. SALT II limited both sides to 2,250 strategic nuclear delivery vehicles (bombers, ICBMs, SLBMs, and <b>air-to-surface</b> <b>ballistic</b> <b>missiles),</b> including a sublimit of 1,200 launchers of MIRVed <b>ballistic</b> <b>missiles,</b> of which only 820 could be launchers of MIRVed ICBMs. It also placed restrictions on the number of warheads on each missile and on deployment of new land-based <b>ballistic</b> <b>missile</b> systems, except for one new type of light ICBM for each side. There was also a provision for verification by each side using its own national technical means.|$|R
50|$|This {{provision}} was to place {{limits on the}} systems that were {{not yet ready to}} be discussed. The provisions for this would remain in force until December 31, 1981. Overall, the United States and the Soviet Union came to an agreement on banning the deployment of mobile ICBM launchers and flight-testing of those ICBMs from launchers. Development of these systems was permitted though, as long as there was no deployment action. Additionally, the Protocol banned the deployment of long range cruise missiles on ground and sea based launchers. Finally, the Protocol banned the flight-testing and deployment of <b>air-to-surface</b> <b>ballistic</b> <b>missiles</b> (ASBMs).|$|R
50|$|In modern language, {{a missile}} is a {{self-propelled}} precision-guided munition system, {{as opposed to}} an unguided self-propelled munition, referred to as a rocket (although these too can also be guided). Missiles have four system components: targeting or missile guidance, flight system, engine, and warhead. Missiles come in types adapted for different purposes: surface-to-surface and <b>air-to-surface</b> <b>missiles</b> (<b>ballistic,</b> cruise, anti-ship, anti-tank, etc.), surface-to-air missiles (and anti-ballistic), air-to-air missiles, and anti-satellite weapons. All known existing missiles are designed to be propelled during powered flight by chemical reactions inside a rocket engine, jet engine, or other type of engine. Non-self-propelled airborne explosive devices are generally referred to as shells and usually have a shorter range than missiles.|$|R
50|$|ICBMs are {{differentiated}} {{by having}} greater range and speed than other ballistic missiles: intermediate-range <b>ballistic</b> <b>missiles</b> (IRBMs), medium-range <b>ballistic</b> <b>missiles</b> (MRBMs), short-range <b>ballistic</b> <b>missiles</b> (SRBMs) and tactical <b>ballistic</b> <b>missiles</b> (TBMs). Short and medium-range <b>ballistic</b> <b>missiles</b> are known collectively as theatre <b>ballistic</b> <b>missiles.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{strategic}} missile {{forces have}} in their inventory 20 or more intercontinental <b>ballistic</b> <b>missiles</b> (ICBMs), between 130 and 150 intermediate-range <b>ballistic</b> <b>missiles,</b> one Xia class submarine carrying 12 submarine-launched <b>ballistic</b> <b>missiles,</b> and about 335 or more short-range <b>ballistic</b> <b>missiles.</b>|$|R
50|$|The <b>Ballistic</b> <b>Missile</b> Defence Program is an {{initiative}} {{to develop and}} deploy a multi-layered <b>ballistic</b> <b>missile</b> defence system to protect India from <b>ballistic</b> <b>missile</b> attacks.|$|R
50|$|An intermediate-range <b>ballistic</b> <b>missile</b> (IRBM) is a <b>ballistic</b> <b>missile</b> with a {{range of}} 3,000-5,500 km (1,864-3,418 miles), between a medium-range <b>ballistic</b> <b>missile</b> (MRBM) and an {{intercontinental}} <b>ballistic</b> <b>missile</b> (ICBM). Classifying <b>ballistic</b> <b>missiles</b> by range is done mostly for convenience, in principle there is very little difference between a low-performance ICBM and a high-performance IRBM, because decreasing payload mass can increase range over ICBM threshold. The range definition used here is used within the U.S. Missile Defense Agency. Some other sources include an additional category, the long-range <b>ballistic</b> <b>missile</b> (LRBM), to describe missiles {{with a range}} between IRBMs and true ICBMs. The more modern term theater <b>ballistic</b> <b>missile</b> encompasses MRBMs and SRBMs, including any <b>ballistic</b> <b>missile</b> with a range under 3500 km.|$|R

5000|$|A theatre <b>ballistic</b> <b>missile</b> (TBM) is any <b>ballistic</b> <b>missile</b> with a {{range between}} 300 km and 3500 km, used against targets [...] "in-theatre". Its range is thus between that of {{tactical}} and intermediate-range <b>ballistic</b> <b>missiles.</b> The term {{is a relatively new}} one, encompassing the former categories of short-range <b>ballistic</b> <b>missile</b> and medium-range <b>ballistic</b> <b>missile.</b> Two examples of this type of in-theatre missile are the Soviet RT-15 and American PGM-17 Thor missile, both from the 1960s.|$|R
50|$|<b>Ballistic</b> <b>missiles</b> {{are largely}} used for land attack missions. Although {{normally}} associated with nuclear weapons, some conventionally armed <b>ballistic</b> <b>missiles</b> are in service, such as MGM-140 ATACMS. The V2 had demonstrated that a <b>ballistic</b> <b>missile</b> could deliver a warhead to a target city with {{no possibility of}} interception, {{and the introduction of}} nuclear weapons meant it could efficiently do damage when it arrived. The accuracy of these systems was fairly poor, but post-war development by most military forces improved the basic Inertial navigation system concept {{to the point where it}} could be used as the guidance system on Intercontinental <b>ballistic</b> <b>missiles</b> flying thousands of kilometers. Today, the <b>ballistic</b> <b>missile</b> represents the only strategic deterrent in most military forces; however, some <b>ballistic</b> <b>missiles</b> are being adapted for conventional roles, such as the Russian Iskander or the Chinese DF-21D anti-ship <b>ballistic</b> <b>missile.</b> <b>Ballistic</b> <b>missiles</b> are primarily surface-launched from mobile launchers, silos, ships or submarines, with air launch being theoretically possible with a weapon such as the cancelled Skybolt missile.|$|R

40|$|T h e Atlantic Alliance {{may be at}} the {{threshold}} of a new debate on the implications of <b>ballistic</b> <b>missile</b> defense (BMD) for European security. Secretary of Defense Caspar Weinberger and several U. S. Senators and Congressmen support a thorough review of U. S. BMD options, including possible revision of the 1972 Anti- <b>Ballistic</b> <b>Missile</b> (ABM) Treaty and its 1974 Protocol. Although active defense of intercontinental <b>ballistic</b> <b>missiles</b> (ICBMs) seems the most likely application for BMD, other strategic defense options are reportedly under consideration. European-based BMD against theater <b>ballistic</b> <b>missiles</b> such as the SS- 20, SS- 21, SS- 22, and SS- 23 is being examined as well. Such defenses are known as anti-tactical <b>ballistic</b> <b>missiles</b> (ATBM) or anti-tactical missiles (ATM).

50|$|A submarine-{{launched}} <b>ballistic</b> <b>missile</b> (SLBM) is a <b>ballistic</b> <b>missile</b> {{capable of}} being launched from submarines. Modern variants usually deliver multiple independently targetable reentry vehicles (MIRVs) each of which carries a nuclear warhead and allows a single launched missile to strike several targets. Submarine-launched <b>ballistic</b> <b>missiles</b> operate {{in a different way}} from submarine-launched cruise missiles.|$|R
50|$|A <b>{{ballistic}}</b> <b>missile</b> is {{a missile}} that follows a ballistic trajectory {{with the objective}} of delivering one or more warheads to a predetermined target. A <b>ballistic</b> <b>missile</b> is only guided during relatively brief periods of flight (there are unguided <b>ballistic</b> <b>missiles</b> as well, such as 9K52 Luna-M, although these may well be considered rockets), and most of its trajectory is unpowered and governed by gravity and air resistance if in the atmosphere. This contrasts to a cruise missile, which is aerodynamically guided in powered flight. Long range intercontinental <b>ballistic</b> <b>missiles</b> (ICBM) are launched on a sub-orbital flight trajectory and spend most of their flight out of the atmosphere. Shorter range <b>ballistic</b> <b>missiles</b> stay within the Earth's atmosphere.|$|R
50|$|Terrier-Oriole {{is used to}} test <b>ballistic</b> <b>missile</b> defense systems, {{under the}} name Aegis Readiness Assessment Vehicle-B (ARAV-B). It is much cheaper than other <b>ballistic</b> <b>missile</b> targets.|$|R
50|$|A {{tactical}} <b>ballistic</b> <b>missile</b> (TBM) (or battlefield range <b>ballistic</b> <b>missile</b> (BRBM)) is a <b>ballistic</b> <b>missile</b> {{designed for}} short-range battlefield use. Typically, range {{is less than}} 300 km. Tactical <b>ballistic</b> <b>missiles</b> are usually mobile to ensure survivability and quick deployment, as well as carrying a variety of warheads to target enemy facilities, assembly areas, artillery, and other targets behind the front lines. Warheads can include conventional high explosive, chemical, biological, or nuclear warheads. Typically tactical nuclear weapons are limited in their total yield compared to strategic rockets.|$|R
