The Montgomery Ward store had previously been located in the Belvidere Mall a few miles down Route 120.

[...] Sears sold the brand, which consisted mostly of stores set apart from its name brand stores, in 2003 to TBC Corporation.

50|$|With Monroeville Mall fully operational, {{the areas}} {{surrounding}} the mall {{began to develop}} as well. Outparcels such as a movie theater, a Marriott hotel, a freestanding Montgomery Ward store, {{and a number of}} retailers, <b>auto</b> <b>service</b> <b>centers</b> and restaurants were subsequently built during the 1970s. The mall annex would also be developed directly behind the mall and feature an A&P supermarket, among other businesses. The A&P closed in 1992, and was replaced by a Burlington Coat Factory in 1993, Dick's Sporting Goods in 1995, Office Max in 1998, and Lenscrafters eye shop in the fall of 1999. The Greater Pittsburgh Merchandise Mart, the predecessor to the much larger Pittsburgh ExpoMart of Monroeville, was developed as a facility for the display of goods by representatives of various manufacturers. It would be replaced by the larger facility in 1981 and redeveloped for the now defunct Borders bookstore which opened in January 1993. In February 1984, much to the dismay of local residents, the Ice Palace was replaced by a food court. In later years, most of the mall's decorative ponds and bridges would be replaced by numerous carts and kiosks. In the early 1990s, the distinctive clock tower was dismantled in lieu of a stage, which has since been removed, while the fountain at the opposite end was removed in the early 2000s for a children's play area, themed to Mister Rogers’ Neighborhood. In 2009, the ExpoMart was converted into office space and a smaller convention center opened along Mall Boulevard in a renovated former Wickes Furniture store.|$|R
500|$|Art's Auto is {{historically}} and architecturally significant {{as a type}} of novelty gas station that was constructed during the phase in which America became highly mobile and yet had not designed specific forms and marketing for automobile service stations. The building's design was intended to capture the attention of motorists and capitalize on the positive imagery of the design. Pawtucket's Art's <b>Auto</b> and Gilbane's <b>Service</b> <b>Center</b> buildings are both rare surviving examples of a dedicated service station displaying whimsical designs in what has been described as the second generation service stations. The design of both buildings represents the antithesis of standardization, opposed to the modern concept of promoting an [...] "image of familiarity and reliability through uniformity". The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1978.|$|R
