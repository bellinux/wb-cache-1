40|$|Aneuploidy-or an {{unbalanced}} karyotype {{in which}} whole chromosomes are gained or lost-causes reduced fitness {{at both the}} cellular and organismal levels but is also a hallmark of human cancers. Aneuploidy causes a variety of cellular stresses, including genomic instability, proteotoxic and oxidative stresses, and impaired protein trafficking. The deubiquitinase Ubp 3, which was identified by a genome-wide screen for gene deletions that impair the fitness of aneuploid yeast, is a key regulator of <b>aneuploid</b> <b>cell</b> homeostasis. We show that deletion of UBP 3 exacerbates both karyotype-specific phenotypes and global stresses of <b>aneuploid</b> <b>cells,</b> including oxidative and proteotoxic stress. Indeed, Ubp 3 is essential for proper proteasome function in euploid cells, and deletion of this deubiquitinase leads to further proteasome-mediated proteotoxicity in aneuploid yeast. Notably, the importance of UBP 3 in <b>aneuploid</b> <b>cells</b> is conserved. Depletion of the human homolog of UBP 3, USP 10, is detrimental to the fitness of human cells upon chromosome missegregation, and this fitness defect is accompanied by autophagy inhibition.

40|$|Aneuploidy is {{a change}} in number or {{structure}} of one or more chromosomes that are not a multiple of the whole chromosome set. One of the best known pathological aneuploidies is trisomy 21 (Down syndrome), with chromosome 21 present in three instead of two copies. Patients with Down syndrome display severe mental retardation and growth defects. In fact, most abnormal aneuploid karyotypes lead to spontaneous abortions during embryogenesis, indicating that aneuploidy is not well tolerated in humans. Aneuploidy was also shown to be a common hallmark of cancer tissues; however, the debate is ongoing whether aneuploidy is rather a by-product or a trigger of tumorigenesis. Even though aneuploid karyotypes were already identified more than 100 years ago little is understood about cellular physiology of aneuploidy cells, especially in humans. To uncover the consequences of numerical aneuploidy in human <b>cells,</b> I generated <b>aneuploid</b> <b>cell</b> lines derived from the human cell lines HCT 116 and RPE- 1 hTERT. First, we showed that <b>aneuploid</b> <b>cells</b> proliferate slower compared to their disomic counterparts. A detailed cell cycle analysis revealed that this delay was due to a prolonged G 1 and S phase, whereas G 2 and M phase remained unperturbed. Furthermore, we conducted an in depth genome wide comparison of DNA, mRNA and protein levels in <b>aneuploid</b> <b>cells.</b> Using CGH, mRNA array and SILAC technology, we quantified the changes in DNA, mRNA and protein abundance. We revealed that extra chromosomes are actively transcribed and translated. However, the abundance of some proteins, particularly subunits of protein complexes and protein kinases, are adjusted towards disomic levels. Additionally, we asked how the cellular physiology is affected by the addition of a specific chromosome. Two scenarios are possible: either the cellular response depends on the additional chromosomes or all <b>aneuploid</b> <b>cells</b> show the same changes of cellular physiology. Indeed, we found that all <b>aneuploid</b> <b>cell</b> lines show similar physiological responses, irrespective of the type of additional chromosome. All <b>aneuploid</b> <b>cell</b> lines down-regulate DNA and RNA metabolism and up-regulate among others energy metabolism, lysosome function and membrane biosynthesis pathways. Lysosomes which are involved in autophagy are besides the ubiquitin-proteasome system important for cellular protein turn over.

In this study we investigated the prognostic significance {{of the amount of}} <b>aneuploid</b> <b>cells</b> (5 c- and 9 c-exceeding rate) in a tumor population. Imprint smears of 370 breast cancer samples (314 patients) were stained by Feulgen and were measured by CAS 200 DNA-image analysis system.

40|$|An {{unbalanced}} {{chromosome number}} (aneuploidy) {{is present in}} most malignant tumours and {{has been attributed to}} mitotic mis-segregation of chromosomes. However, recent studies have shown a relatively high rate of chromosomal mis-segregation also in non-neoplastic human cells, while the frequency of <b>aneuploid</b> <b>cells</b> remains low throughout life in most normal tissues. This implies that newly formed <b>aneuploid</b> <b>cells</b> are subject to negative selection in healthy tissues and that attenuation of this selection could contribute to aneuploidy in cancer. To test this, we modelled cellular growth as discrete time branching processes, during which chromosome gains and losses were generated and their host cells subjected to selection pressures of various magnitudes. We then assessed experimentally the frequency of chromosomal mis-segregation as well as the prevalence of <b>aneuploid</b> <b>cells</b> in human non-neoplastic cells and in cancer cells. Integrating these data into our models allowed estimation of the fitness reduction resulting from a single chromosome copy number change to an average of < 30 % in normal cells.

30|$|In {{standard}} Darwinian terms, aneuploidy {{has been}} typified as altered selection-dependent phenotypic expression directed towards differential fitness in an adaptive landscape [67]. However, its adaptive potential relates to context. In specialized circumstances, it can serve the organism to its betterment, such as by conferring forms {{of resistance to}} stress based on altered genetic expression in a tissue-specific manner [36]. Consequently, aneuploidy can be alternatively viewed as a mechanistic toolkit for cells to solve problems in ambiguous circumstances. In some situations, the resulting phenotypic expression provides a survival advantage. In others, the <b>aneuploid</b> <b>cell</b> pattern expresses differently and becomes the basis for neoplasia through enhancement of mis-segregation and a further proliferation of differing karyotes. However, in either set of circumstances, upon inception, that initial <b>aneuploid</b> <b>cell</b> is a differing self-referential entity with its own distinct and indeterminate potentials.

To investigate this aspect further, p 14 (ARF) was ectopically expressed in HCT 116 cells after depletion of the Spindle Assembly Checkpoint MAD 2 protein that was used as a trigger for aneuploidy. p 14 (ARF) Re-expression reduced the number of <b>aneuploid</b> <b>cells</b> in MAD 2 post-transcriptionally silenced cells. Also aberrant mitoses, frequently displayed in MAD 2 -depleted cells, were decreased when p 14 (ARF) was expressed at the same time. In addition, p 14 (ARF) ectopic expression in MAD 2 -depleted cells induced apoptosis associated with increased p 53 protein levels. Conversely, p 14 (ARF) ectopic expression did not induce apoptosis in HCT 116 p 53 KO cells.

Pleural and ascitic fluid samples (n= 57) from 41 breast cancer patients were concomitantly evaluated by routine cytology and FISH, using centromere-specific probes representing chromosomes 7, 11, 12, 17 and 18.

Although much has been discovered about the phenotypic consequences of aneuploidy over the past decade, an unbiased investigation into <b>aneuploid</b> <b>cell</b> biology was previously lacking. We performed high-throughput screens for genes whose deletion has a synthetic fitness cost in <b>aneuploid</b> Saccharomyces cerevisiae <b>cells</b> containing single extra chromosomes. This analysis identified genes that when deleted decrease the fitness of specific disomic strains as well as those that impair the proliferation of a broad range of aneuploidies. We find that single gene duplications can cause severe phenotypic impact in aneuploid yeast and that <b>aneuploid</b> <b>cells,</b> regardless of karyotype, exhibit protein secretion and cell wall integrity defects, highlighting the complexity of <b>aneuploid</b> <b>cell</b> biology. Additionally, we identify a deubiquitinase, Ubp 3, whose deletion broadly impairs <b>aneuploid</b> yeast <b>cell</b> fitness via both karyotype-dependent and karyotype-independent mechanisms. Deletion of UBP 3 severely exacerbates proteotoxicity in aneuploid yeast and impairs proteasome function. Indeed, our data suggest that Ubp 3 has a role in maintaining full proteasome activity in euploid cells. Finally, this synthetic effect is conserved; depletion of the human homolog of UBP 3, USPO, impairs <b>aneuploid</b> human <b>cell</b> fitness via severe inhibition of autophagy. Thus, we used a genome-wide screen in yeast to identify novel cellular consequences of aneuploidy across organisms.

In the present study, normal and cancer derived human cell lines were treated with chrysotile and the cellular and molecular mechanisms related to generation of <b>aneuploid</b> <b>cells</b> was elucidated. The first alteration observed was cytokinesis regression, the main cause of multinucleated cells formation and centrosome amplification. The multinucleated cells formed after cytokinesis regression were able to progress through cell cycle and generated <b>aneuploid</b> <b>cells</b> after abnormal mitosis. To understand the process of cytokinesis regression, localization of cytokinetic proteins was investigated. It was observed mislocalization of Anillin, Aurora B, Septin 9 and Alix in the intercellular bridge, and no determination of secondary constriction and abscission sites. Fiber treatment also led to overexpression of genes related to cancer, cytokinesis and cell cycle. The results show that chrysotile fibers induce cellular and molecular alterations in normal and tumor cells that have been related to cancer initiation and progression, and that tetraploidization and <b>aneuploid</b> <b>cell</b> formation are striking events after fiber internalization, which could generate a favorable context to cancer development...|$|R
40|$|Despite its ubiquity in cancer, {{link with}} other pathologies, and role in {{promoting}} adaptive evolution, the effects of aneuploidy or imbalanced chromosomal content on cellular physiology have remained incompletely characterized. Significantly, {{it appears that the}} detrimental as well as beneficial effects of aneuploidy are due to the altered gene expression elicited by the aneuploid state. In this review we examine the correlation between chromosome copy number changes and gene expression in <b>aneuploid</b> <b>cells.</b> We discuss the primary effects of aneuploidy on gene expression and describe the cellular response to altered mRNA and protein levels. Moreover, we consider compensatory mechanisms that may ameliorate imbalanced gene expression and restore protein homeostasis in <b>aneuploid</b> <b>cells.</b> Finally, we propose a novel hypothesis to explain the hitherto enigmatic abundance compensation of proteins encoded on supernumerary chromosomes.
