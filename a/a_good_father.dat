5|$|Ste told Amy's father Mike to {{look after}} Lucas and Leah in the {{aftermath}} of the baby plot because he didn't think he was <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>father.</b> Richardson reported that he enjoyed working with Jude and Jessica Croft-Lane, the young actors who played Lucas and Leah. He reported that Jude was camera shy and liked to play with camera equipment during filming and that he told Croft-Lane that his name was actually Ste. Richardson concluded the storyline was different and he felt it gave him a chance to showcase his acting abilities.|$|E
5|$|Medical {{examiner}} Blythe (Wendy Hughes) {{leaves her}} visiting son Danny (Stivi Paskoski) {{with her boyfriend}} Bolander (Ned Beatty) for the day, with the hopes they will {{get to know each}} other better. Danny rides along with Bolander and Munch (Richard Belzer) on their murder investigations, but acts very wild and constantly asks inappropriate questions. At dinner later, Danny asks Bolander about his sex life with Danny's mother, making Bolander extremely uncomfortable. Bolander later tells Blythe he believes her son is crazy. Meanwhile, Crosetti (Jon Polito) spends a lot of time with his friend Officer Chris Thormann (Lee Tergesen), who is recovering from a recent shooting that has left him blind. At one point, Thormann defecates on himself and is humiliated, but Crosetti helps him clean up. Thormann's wife, Eva (Edie Falco), tells Crosetti she is pregnant, but that her husband reacted angrily to the news. Thormann tells Crosetti he should have died at the hospital and can never be <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>father,</b> but Crosetti encourages him.|$|E
5|$|In the manga Boruto: Naruto Next Generations, Beveridge liked Sasuke's personality, {{particularly}} {{as it was}} presented during his dialogue with Naruto. Reviewing the anime adaptation, Sam Stewart from IGN was particularly impressed by the scenes between Sasuke and Sarada, most notably because of changes in Sasuke's characterization. He highlights that despite acting coldly towards his daughter, he ends up using his body as a shield {{to protect her from}} his enemy. Ken Iikura from Anime Now agreed, pointing out that Sasuke has become a loving husband and father in Boruto, despite retaining some of the dark aspects of his personality. Ikikura noted that Sasuke and Sarada's meeting in Boruto significantly developed both characters. McNulty disliked the romance between Sasuke and Sakura in the original series, because she felt it was initially an one-sided crush on Sakura's part, but she believed the spin-off manga Naruto Gaiden expanded on the bond between the two and their relationship with their daughter, Sarada. Stewart praised Sasuke's portrayal as a flawed parent rather than an effortlessly good one, noting that his farewell to Sarada demonstrated his difficulty with being <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>father.</b> Another writer from Anime Now, Sarah Nelkin, noted that these episodes helped to develop Sasuke as both a father and a husband, especially when he explains to Sarada that she creates a bond between him and Sakura that persists despite his being frequently absent {{as a result of his}} mission.|$|E

25|$|The {{narrative}} {{evokes the}} first humans created by Roog {{with a female}} being the first, and the trials they had faced. It also evokes the name of Roog, regarded as the Omnipotence, whom through his paternal nature, acted as <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>father</b> and moved the woman to a more comfortable place when she complained about her discomfort. It shows that he is always available to his children. The appearance of the man initially surprised the woman, whom she named Ngoor (virile), yet, they later became companions and procreated.|$|E
25|$|The Kanins wrote My Pal Gus (1952) {{in which}} Richard Widmark becomes <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>father</b> and {{falls in love}} with Joanne Dru, the Elizabeth Taylor film Rhapsody (1954) and The Opposite Sex (1956), a musical remake of The Women. But it was the Oscar-nominated script for Teacher's Pet (1958) for which they are best remembered, a film about a self-made {{newspaper}} editor Clark Gable who has a love-hate relationship with journalism teacher Doris Day. The film almost did not get made since the Kanins were not under any studio contract, and having shopped the script around without attracting any interest, it was only after a rewrite inspired by Garson Kanin's Born Yesterday that producer Bill Perlberg and director George Seaton purchased it.|$|E

25|$|At MacLeod's urging, Zelle {{returned}} to him, but his behavior did not change. She escaped her circumstances {{by studying the}} local culture. In 1899, their children fell violently ill from complications relating {{to the treatment of}} syphilis contracted from their parents, though the family claimed they were poisoned by an irate servant. Jeanne survived, but Norman died. Some sources maintain that one of MacLeod's enemies may have poisoned a supper to kill both of their children. After moving back to the Netherlands, the couple officially separated on 30 August 1902. The divorce became final in 1906. Zelle was awarded custody of Jeanne. MacLeod was legally required to pay support, which he never did, making life very difficult for Zelle and her daughter. During a visit of Jeanne with her father, MacLeod decided not to return Jeanne to her mother. Zelle did not have resources to fight the situation and accepted it, believing that while McLeod had been an abusive husband, he had always been <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>father.</b> Jeanne later {{died at the age of}} 21, also possibly from complications relating to syphilis.|$|E
500|$|After {{contracting}} {{an illness}} from a hip surgery two years prior, Taylor died on November 25, 2006 of a strangulated hernia at an assisted living residence in Tucson, Arizona. His son {{stated that he}} wanted [...] "to be remembered mostly as <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>father,</b> husband, grandfather and great-grandfather. He was very loyal and dutiful, and to him that {{was more important than}} what he did in the war." [...] He was cremated and later buried at the Arlington National Cemetery in June 2007 with full military honors. Alaska Senator Ted Stevens gave a eulogy at the United States Senate prior to the service at Arlington.|$|E
500|$|In Gilligan Unbound, author Paul Arthur Cantor {{states that}} he {{believes}} Homer's devotion to his family has added to {{the popularity of the}} character. He writes, [...] "Homer is the distillation of pure fatherhood. [...] This is why, for all his stupidity, bigotry and self-centered quality, we cannot hate Homer. He continually fails at being <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>father,</b> but he never gives up trying, and in some basic and important sense that makes him a good father." [...] The Sunday Times remarked [...] "Homer is good because, above all, he is capable of great love. When the chips are down, he always does the right thing by his children—he is never unfaithful in spite of several opportunities." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And father, too," [...] {{said the}} wife. [...] "He has been <b>a</b> very <b>good</b> <b>father</b> to you all; and I never can {{understand}} why one who works so hard should earn so little; but I believe it is the fault of those machines. The police ought to put them down, and then every body would be comfortable." ...|$|R

500|$|... "Saturdays of Thunder" [...] is {{the ninth}} episode of The Simpsons third season. It {{originally}} aired on the Fox {{network in the}} United States on November 14, 1991. In the episode, Homer takes a fatherhood quiz and realizes that he knows nothing about Bart. He strives {{to be a better}} father and learns that Bart is participating in a Soap Box Derby. Homer and Bart make a racer together; however, it is not very good. Bart decides to drive Martin's far superior racer instead, after Martin is involved in an accident where he receives a broken arm. Homer is at first devastated, but decides that he must be <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>father</b> and support Bart.|$|E
500|$|Director Mark Romanek {{has said}} that, {{as in the}} novel, {{everyone}} has to uncover their relationship to our own mortality; we have two options: either go against it, or {{try to figure out}} a way around it like the character Tommy does. Romanek hoped the audience of Never Let Me Go would be reminded of what is important: love, behaviour, and friendships. He recalled an email a person had written to him: [...] "I saw your film and it made me cry and I haven't reacted to a film emotionally like that in years. And I called my father, cause I realized I hadn’t spoken to him in 3 weeks and I told him how much I love him and how much I appreciated what <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>father</b> he's been." ...|$|E
500|$|During April 2009, Amy {{gave birth}} to Lucas, and {{subsequently}} left due to post-natal depression. Ste was left looking after both Lucas, and Amy's daughter Leah. A couple, Abi Raven (Elaine Glover) and Daniel Raven (Chris Hargreaves) befriended Ste and tried {{to convince him that}} he was <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>father,</b> and that he did not need Amy in their lives. However, Abi and Daniel planned to kidnap Lucas, at first in order to keep him and then later on to give him to another family. Richardson expressed to Digital Spy his pleasure with this storyline, saying, [...] "It's getting quite dark." [...] He was also shocked with its entertaining and unexpected ending." [...] When the storyline came to its climax, Abi and Daniel tried to take Lucas, but they were stopped.|$|E
6000|$|... "Nobody has," [...] said Robert, {{shaking his}} head, [...] "but I {{am going to}} make a fight against it. I am going to begin now.

Daniel's Jesus appears only to him and openly questions modern interpretations of church teachings, reminding Daniel of his own strengths and weaknesses.|$|R
500|$|Burton and August {{also worked}} {{together}} in creating Wilbur Wonka, Willy's domineering dentist father. Burton thought the paternal character would help explain Willy Wonka himself and that otherwise {{he would be}} [...] "just a weird guy". The element of an estranged father-son relationship had previously appeared in Big Fish, similarly directed by Burton and written by August. Warner Bros. and the director held differences over the characterizations of Charlie Bucket and Willy Wonka. The studio wanted to entirely delete Mr. Bucket and make Willy Wonka the idyllic father figure Charlie had longed for his entire life. Burton believed that Wonka would not be <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>father,</b> finding the character similar to a recluse. Burton said, [...] "In some ways, he's more screwed up than the kids." [...] Warner Bros. also wanted Charlie to be a , but Burton resisted the characterization. He wanted Charlie to be an average child who {{would be in the}} background and not get in trouble.|$|E
500|$|Superhuman {{psychologist}} Leonard Samson says of Osborn: [...] "In clinical terms, {{the words}} psychotic and psychopathic {{are far from}} synonymous... but in Norman Osborn's case, both apply. I'd characterise him as a bipolar psychotic with concurrent aspects of psychopathic megalomania and malignant narcissism. In layman's terms, a lethal cocktail of intersecting personality disorders that makes {{him one of the}} most dangerous human beings on the planet." [...] There are many examples of Osborn's pronounced superiority complex, to the point that he will rarely, if ever, admit that he has made mistakes. He often transfers blame for his shortcomings to others or claims that he was better than he was; even before his accident, he spent more time providing Harry with gifts or outings rather than actually being there for his son or trying to listen to his problems, and nevertheless claims that he was still <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>father,</b> likely due to the abusive nature of his own father.|$|E
500|$|Ann Luster, the film's producer, {{helped with}} the script from the {{earliest}} stages, and claimed she and Coyle had a deep {{understanding of how to}} handle the characters from the start. The film was set in Minneapolis, Minnesota, where Coyle lived and worked as a writer and actor at the time. The fictional church in the story, St. Mary Magdalen's Downtown Catholic Church, is based in part on the St. Mary Magdalene church in Omaha, Nebraska, where Coyle was raised. However, the real-life church was also very different from the fictional church in that it lacked a shelter and drew very large congregations for weekend mass, compared to the half-empty pews in the fictional church. The fictional church is also based in part on Our Lady of Guadalupe, another Catholic church in south Omaha. The Into Temptation script won the McKnight Screenwriting Fellowship from IFP Minnesota Center for Media Arts, and investors were sought through public readings. After reading the script, Patrick Coyle's wife said, [...] "If you get <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>Father</b> John, you'll have a good movie." ...|$|E

60|$|<b>As</b> to our <b>good</b> <b>father,</b> he {{was ever}} ready to greet us with many small jests and tags of Oriental poems {{appropriate}} to the occasion, for we had no secrets from him, and he already looked upon us all as his children.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh! no, miss," [...] Jane {{answered}} promptly. [...] "He wasn't never {{what you}} might call exactly cruel. He was <b>a</b> very <b>good</b> <b>father,</b> and looked after you well; but he was sort of stern and moody-like--would have his own way, and didn't pay no attention to fads and fancies, he called 'em. When you were little, many's the time he sent you up here for punishment--disobedience and such like." ...|$|R
500|$|The film's title, Road to Perdition, is both Michael Sullivan and his son's {{destination}} {{town and}} {{a euphemism for}} Hell, a road that Sullivan desires to prevent his son from traveling. Sullivan, who chooses his violent path early on in life, considers himself irredeemable and seeks to save his son from a similar fate. Said Mendes, [...] " [...] is in a battle {{for the soul of}} his son. Can a man who has led a bad life achieve redemption through his child?" [...] Hanks described Sullivan as a man who achieved a comfortable status through violent means, whose likely repercussions he ignored. Sullivan is <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>father</b> and husband, but also has a job that requires him to be a violent killer. The film explores this paradoxical dichotomy. When Sullivan is faced with the consequences, Hanks says, [...] "At the moment we're dropped into the story, it is literally the last day of that false perspective." [...] To keep Sullivan from justifying his violent actions in the film, Mendes omitted scenes in the final cut that had Sullivan explaining his background to his son.|$|E
500|$|Nate Meyers of Digitally Obsessed {{was more}} {{positive}} about the episode, commenting that the episode's emphasis is on Homer's parenting, like many other season three episodes, and [...] "contrary to popular opinion, Homer is actually <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>father</b> who tries to do good by his children." [...] He thought the racing sequences featured [...] "good animation and direction", but considered {{the highlight of the}} episode to be the clip from the film McBain that Homer watches in the video store. Meyers gave the episode a 4/5 rating. DVD Movie Guide's Colin Jacobson, who listed the episode as one of his favorites from season three, said that [...] "on the surface, 'Saturdays of Thunder' essentially just rehashes" [...] the theme of the previous episode, [...] "Lisa's Pony", in which Homer tries to be a better father for Lisa. Jacobson commented that [...] "Saturdays of Thunder", however, [...] "simply seems funnier than 'Lisa's Pony'. The soapbox derby elements provide lots of great gags. [...] offers a great episode." [...] Like Meyers, the authors of the book I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide thought the highlight of the episode was the McBain video.|$|E
500|$|Rae {{ultimately}} learnt of the affair; Richardson characterised {{her response}} as being [...] "shocked and angry", and Barlow told Inside Soap magazine that the revelation left her character [...] "more torn than ever." [...] The discovery prompted Rae to consider having an abortion, but Brendan convinced her not to, and {{revealed that he}} once lost his own child. Barlow called the scenes [...] "really heartfelt stuff", and explained that Ste saw no problem with Rae having the baby, as he already had a son and considered himself <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>father,</b> whereas it was [...] "a bigger deal" [...] for Rae, who was childless. Discussing Rae and Ste's relationship, Barlow said that Rae truly loved Ste, {{and that they had}} a special connection formed through the hardships they had faced together. Despite this, Rae rebuffed Ste's attempt to rekindle their relationship. Barlow said that her character could not return to Ste because she knew that he was gay, that Rae was [...] "determined to keep the baby" [...] and wanted to prove that she could be a good single mother. However, during an argument with Brendan, Rae suffered a miscarriage. Barlow found the filming of these scenes difficult.|$|E
60|$|He was not <b>a</b> very <b>good</b> <b>father</b> about money, {{because when}} Pony went {{to ask him}} for a five-cent piece {{he always wanted to}} know what it was for, and even when it was for <b>a</b> <b>good</b> thing <b>a</b> fellow did not always like to tell. If his father did not think it was <b>a</b> <b>good</b> thing he would not let Pony have it, and then Pony would be ashamed {{to go back to the}} boys, for they would say his father was stingy, though perhaps none of them had tried to get money from their own fathers.|$|R
