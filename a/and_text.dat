5|$|Veloso {{designed}} the album's cover himself, {{as he had}} done before for three other albums. He went through a long design process in which the cover's colors, fonts, <b>and</b> <b>text</b> positioning were changed frequently. Veloso chose the color purple for the cover's background because it is mentioned multiple times in the album itself.|$|E
5|$|A 300-page iPhone {{bill from}} AT Mobility mailed {{in a box}} {{was the subject of}} a viral video made by YouTube {{personality}} Justine Ezarik, best known as iJustine, which became an Internet meme in August 2007. Ezarik's video focused on the unnecessary waste of paper, as the detailed bill itemized all data transfers made during the billing period, including every email <b>and</b> <b>text</b> message. Stories of unexpected billing issues began to circulate in blogs and the technical press after the Apple iPhone's heavily advertised and anticipated release, but this video clip brought the voluminous bills to the attention of the mass media.|$|E
5|$|At {{approximately}} 8:00pm on 19 December 2010, Reardon {{returned home}} from a weekend visit to Sheffield to find Yeates absent from their flat on Canynge Road, Clifton. Reardon {{had been trying to}} contact her by phone <b>and</b> <b>text,</b> but without success. While awaiting Yeates' return, Reardon called her again, but her mobile phone rang from a pocket of her coat, which was still in the flat. He found that her purse and keys were also at the flat, and that their cat appeared to have been neglected. Shortly after half past midnight, Reardon contacted the police and Yeates' parents to report her missing.|$|E
50|$|The main {{differences}} between the Israeli standard and the W3C standard concern the requirements to provide captions <b>and</b> <b>texts</b> for audio <b>and</b> video media. The Israeli standards are somewhat more lenient, reflecting the current technical difficulties in providing such captions <b>and</b> <b>texts</b> in Hebrew.|$|R

5|$|Huh had {{difficulty}} {{in designing the}} Pig Girl's mask and attempted several different designs which were rejected before arriving at the chosen mask, but cannot imagine Mu-Yeon wearing any other mask now. Yen Press licensed Pig Bride for an English-language release in North America and began serializing it in the manga anthology Yen Plus. The final issue of Yen Plus in July 2010 contained the conclusion to Pig Bride. The English localization process included Korean onomatopoeia and sound effects with the anglicized word followed by the English translations. Signage <b>and</b> <b>text</b> is commonly written with English translations {{in or near the}} panel it appears instead of replacing the original text.|$|E
5|$|In March 2017, {{ahead of}} {{the first anniversary of}} the North American launch of Unchained χ, Square Enix {{announced}} that the mobile game would be rebranded as Kingdom Hearts Union χ in April 2017. The relaunch of the title will see the inclusion of the new Union Cross multiplayer mode, allowing parties of up to six players to take on the Heartless together through the game's matchmaking feature as they communicate with each other through emotes <b>and</b> <b>text</b> options, and a theater mode to rewatch unlocked cutscenes and animations.|$|E
5|$|Nobel laureates {{receive a}} diploma {{directly}} {{from the hands of}} the King of Sweden, {{or in the case of}} the peace prize, the Chairman of the Norwegian Nobel Committee. Each diploma is uniquely designed by the prize-awarding institutions for the laureates that receive them. The diploma contains a picture <b>and</b> <b>text</b> in Swedish which states the name of the laureate and normally a citation of why they received the prize. None of the Nobel Peace Prize laureates has ever had a citation on their diplomas.|$|E

5|$|Potter's own three-door oven, her hearthrug, her indoor plants, her {{coronation}} teapot, and {{her water}} pump are minutely detailed with more color {{than in other}} productions. The large format of the original edition, the captions accompanying the full page color illustrations, and the occasional lack of coordination between picture <b>and</b> <b>text</b> all display Potter's delight in the pictures, sometimes {{at the expense of}} the text.|$|E
5|$|Smetana's {{visit to}} Liszt at Weimar {{in the summer}} of 1857, where he heard the latter's Faust Symphony and Die Ideale, caused a {{material}} reorientation of Smetana's orchestral music. These works gave Smetana answers to many compositional problems relating to the structure of orchestral music, and suggested a means for expressing literary subjects by a synthesis between music <b>and</b> <b>text,</b> rather than by simple musical illustration. These insights enabled Smetana to write the three Gothenburg symphonic poems, (RichardIII, Wallenstein's Camp and Hakon Jarl), works that transformed Smetana from a composer primarily of salon pieces to a modern neo-Romantic, capable of handling large-scale forces and demonstrating the latest musical concepts.|$|E
5|$|The Calculus Affair {{marked a}} return to the single volume format which was to persist for the rest of The Adventures of Tintin. The volume started its {{publication}} in Tintin magazine on December 1954. Before working on the book, Hergé would make sketches in pencil; subsequently he would work over the drawings <b>and</b> <b>text</b> in ink. With the development of his own Studios Hergé, he selected the best sketch from a number of versions and traced it onto the page he was creating.|$|E

5|$|The Portopia Serial Murder Incident {{follows a}} first-person {{perspective}} and narrative. The various events are described with still pictures <b>and</b> <b>text</b> messages. The player {{interacts with the}} game using a verb-noun parser which requires typing precise commands with the keyboard. Finding the exact words to type is {{considered part of the}} riddles that must be solved. While sound effects are present, the game lacks music and a save function. It features a conversation system with branching dialogue choices, where the story develops through entering commands and receiving answers to them from the player's sidekick or non-player characters.|$|E
5|$|The {{album was}} {{originally}} released as a two-LP set with a gatefold {{jacket and a}} booklet containing lyrics, a text version of the story, and photographs taken by Ethan Russell illustrating it. MCA Records re-released the album as a two-CD set in 1985 with the lyrics <b>and</b> <b>text</b> story line on a thin fold-up sheet {{but none of the}} photographs. The album was reissued as a remastered CD in 1996, featuring a reproduction of the original album artwork. The original mix had been criticised in particular for Daltrey's vocals being buried, so the 1996 CD was completely remixed by Jon Astley and Andy Macpherson.|$|E
5|$|The {{manuscript}} today comprises 340 folios and, since 1953, {{has been}} bound in four volumes. The leaves are on high-quality calf vellum, and the unprecedentedly elaborate ornamentation that covers them includes ten full-page illustrations <b>and</b> <b>text</b> pages that are vibrant with decorated initials and interlinear miniatures and mark the furthest {{extension of the}} anti-classical and energetic qualities of Insular art. The Insular majuscule script of the text itself {{appears to be the}} work of at least three different scribes. The lettering is in iron gall ink, and the colours used were derived {{from a wide range of}} substances, many of which were imports from distant lands.|$|E

5|$|The song {{falls into}} the idiom of {{previous}} minstrel music, relying on rhythm <b>and</b> <b>text</b> declamation as its primary motivation. Its melody is simple and the harmony little developed. Nevertheless, contemporary critics found the song more pleasant than previous minstrel fare. Musicologist Dale Cockrell argues that the song represents a transition between early minstrel music and the more European-style songs of minstrelsy's later years.|$|E
5|$|There {{are five}} main plot lines that the player {{will have the}} chance to experience, three which are {{initially}} available and two more which can later become available.
