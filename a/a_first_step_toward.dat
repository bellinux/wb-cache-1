5|$|Thanks {{to popular}} support within Poland, {{as well as}} to {{international}} support and media coverage, the Gdańsk workers held out until the government gave in to their demands. On August 21 a Governmental Commission (Komisja Rządowa) including Mieczysław Jagielski arrived in Gdańsk, and another one with Kazimierz Barcikowski was dispatched to Szczecin. On August 30 and 31, and on September 3, representatives of the workers and the government signed an agreement ratifying many of the workers' demands, including the right to strike. This agreement {{came to be known as}} the August or Gdańsk agreement (Porozumienia sierpniowe). Other agreements were signed in Szczecin (the Szczecin Agreement of August 30), and Jastrzębie-Zdrój on September 3. It was called the Jastrzębie Agreement (Porozumienia jastrzebskie) and as such is regarded as part of the Gdańsk agreement. Though concerned with labor-union matters, the agreement enabled citizens to introduce democratic changes within the communist political structure and was regarded as <b>a</b> <b>first</b> <b>step</b> <b>toward</b> dismantling the Party's monopoly of power. The workers' main concerns were the establishment of a labor union independent of communist-party control, and recognition of a legal right to strike. Workers' needs would now receive clear representation. Another consequence of the Gdańsk Agreement was the replacement, in September 1980, of Edward Gierek by Stanisław Kania as Party First Secretary.|$|E

25|$|The radical liberal {{movement}} {{began in}} the 1790s in England and concentrated on parliamentary and electoral reform, emphasizing natural rights and popular sovereignty.

25|$|Another {{controversial}} method, {{developed by}} Joseph Greenberg, is mass comparison. The method, which disavows any ability to date developments, aims simply to show which languages {{are more and}} less close to each other. Greenberg suggested that the method is useful for preliminary grouping of languages known to be related as <b>a</b> <b>first</b> <b>step</b> <b>toward</b> more in-depth comparative analysis. However, since mass comparison eschews the establishment of regular changes, it is flatly rejected {{by the majority of}} historical linguists.|$|E
25|$|In Europe, the {{partnerships}} {{contributed to}} the Commercial Revolution which started in the 13th century. In the 15th, century the cities member of the Hanseatic League, would mutually strengthen each other; a ship from Hamburg to Danzig, would not only carry its own cargo but was also commissioned to transport freight for {{other members of the}} league. This practice not only saved time and money; but also constituted <b>a</b> <b>first</b> <b>step</b> <b>toward</b> partnership. This capacity to join forces in reciprocal services became a distinctive feature, and a long lasting success factor, of the Hanseatic team spirit.|$|E

25|$|Iowa {{state law}} {{mandates}} that its caucus {{must be held}} at least eight days before any other meeting, caucus, or primary for the presidential nominating process. Therefore, the Iowa Caucuses have always been traditionally the leading state in the nominating process. Not only did controversy brew between the candidates, but the caucuses themselves drew {{a large amount of}} media attention. The decisions of the Iowans often affect the rest of the campaign season. Barack Obama's victory in Iowa helped establish him as one of the Democratic frontrunners of 2008 and was <b>a</b> <b>first</b> <b>step</b> <b>toward</b> his eventual nomination.|$|E
25|$|The {{development}} into {{maturity of}} classical liberalism took place {{before and after}} the French Revolution in Britain. Adam Smith's The Wealth of Nations, published in 1776, was to provide most of the ideas of economics, at least until the publication of J. S. Mill's Principles in 1848. Smith addressed the motivation for economic activity, the causes of prices and the distribution of wealth, and the policies the state should follow in order to maximise wealth. And the radical liberal movement began in the 1790s in England and concentrated on parliamentary and electoral reform, emphasizing natural rights and popular sovereignty. Radicals like Richard Price and Joseph Priestley saw parliamentary reform as <b>a</b> <b>first</b> <b>step</b> <b>toward</b> dealing with their many grievances, including the treatment of Protestant Dissenters, the slave trade, high prices and high taxes.|$|E

40|$|Admitting capable {{students}} is <b>an</b> important <b>first</b> <b>step</b> <b>toward</b> promoting access – but it represents just <b>a</b> <b>first</b> <b>step.</b> How comparable is the path from admission to degree attainment for similarly qualified students {{who come from}} different socioeconomic strata? Multivariate analysis of data from one university’s entering cohort of over 5, 000 full-time baccalaureate students shows that ability to pay and academic ability, among other factors, are substantively and significantly related to graduation rates and time to degree. Six-year graduation rates for high-income students are about 10 to 25 percentage points above those of low-income students of similar academic ability. Affordability, Participation, and Degree Completion Admitting capable {{students is}} <b>an</b> important <b>first</b> <b>step</b> <b>toward</b> promoting access.

500|$|The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) {{completed}} a disaster survey of houses on August19, <b>a</b> <b>first</b> <b>step</b> <b>toward</b> a federal disaster declaration.

[...] On August25, Governor Abercrombie formally requested for federal assistance, after the state depleted its disaster fund, but that was rejected by FEMA due to insufficient damage. However, Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack declared an agriculture disaster, prompting the Small Business Administration to allow federal disaster loans to small businesses. The FEMA decision was reversed on September12, when the federal government approved aid for rebuilding public buildings, as well as future disaster mitigation.|$|E
500|$|Glory was recommissioned on 1 August 1916 {{to serve}} as the {{flagship}} for Rear-Admiral Thomas Kemp, British North Russia Squadron, along with the protected cruiser [...] and six minesweepers. She had some of her guns removed to increase accommodation space for more Royal Marines. In this duty, she was based at Archangel to protect supplies that arrived there for the Russian Army. The squadron's mission evolved after the Bolshevik Revolution in 1917 into preventing the supplies that had been delivered from falling {{into the hands of the}} Red Army. Nevertheless, Kemp maintained good relations with the local communist leadership; on 6 March 1918, Kemp reached an agreement with the authorities in Murmansk to send ashore a party of 130 marines from Glory to help defend the city from a feared invasion by neighboring Finland. She sent further men to reinforce the marines, along with Lewis guns and a 12-pounder gun, the latter from the armoured cruiser [...] Finnish forces attempted to seize nearby Pechenga as <b>a</b> <b>first</b> <b>step</b> <b>toward</b> advancing on Murmansk, but the attack broke down after Cochrane contributed marines and gunfire support to its defence.

40|$|Volunteer {{distributed}} computations utilize spare processor {{cycles of}} personal computers that {{are connected to}} the Internet. The resulting platforms provide computational power previously available only through the use of expensive clusters or supercomputers. However, distributed computations running in untrustworthy environments raise a number of security concerns, including computation integrity and data privacy. This paper introduces a strategy for enhancing data privacy in some distributed volunteer computations, providing <b>an</b> important <b>first</b> <b>step</b> <b>toward</b> <b>a</b> general data privacy solution for these computations. The strategy is used to provide enhanced data privacy for the Smith-Waterman local nucleotide sequence comparison algorithm. Our modified Smith-Waterman algorithm provides reasonable performance, identifying most, and in many cases all, sequence pairs that exhibit statistically significant similarity according to the unmodified algorithm, with reasonable levels of false positives. Moreover the modified algorithm achieves a net decrease in execution time, with no increase in memory requirements. Most importantly, our scheme represents <b>an</b> important <b>first</b> <b>step</b> <b>toward</b> providing data privacy for a practical and important real-world algorithm...|$|R
