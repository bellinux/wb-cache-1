25|$|As human {{machines}} {{being made}} up of cells controlled by our brain to influence aspects of our behaviour, {{there must be some}} influence of biology on our consumer behaviour and how we purchase as well. The nature versus nurture debate {{is at the core of}} how much biology influences these buying decisions, because it argues the extent to which biological factors influence what we do, and how much is reflected through environmental factors. Neuromarketing is of interest to marketers in measuring the reaction of stimulus to marketing. Even though we know there is a reaction, the question of why we consume the way we do still lingers, but it is <b>a</b> <b>step</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> direction. Biology helps to understand consumer behaviour as it influences consumption and aids in the measurement of it.|$|E

Gamers Hell reviewer John K. called it [...] "certainly <b>a</b> <b>step</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> direction to a good 3D Pokémon game", although {{he felt that the}} limited number of Pokémon and lack of a true overworld detracted from the experience.

500|$|Critics also {{speculated that}} the lyrics of the song were about Brown's former {{relationship}} with pop singer Rihanna.

Anthony Benigno of The Faster Times observed that the song could be a reference to [...] "the Rihanna incident", writing [...] "is it about RiRi? Maybe, maybe not. He ain't telling, in any case". Jayson Rodriguez of MTV News wrote that [...] "Deuces" [...] was indeed a [...] "standout" [...] track from the Fan of a Fan mixtape, and that it [...] "appears to be a dig at Rihanna". The song was nominated for Best Rap/Sung Collaboration at the 53rd Grammy Awards, and Best Collaboration at the 2011 BET Awards.|$|E
500|$|Griffith {{described}} Lara Croft as {{a flawed}} female influence. He stated that though {{the character is}} <b>a</b> <b>step</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> direction, too many women view her as a [...] "crudely realised male fantasy figure". Women in the video game industry describe the character as both a positive and negative influence. Ismini Roby of WomenGamers.com commented that Croft was not a sexist influence in 1996, attributed {{to the lack of}} prominent female characters in video games at the time. She stated that the over-sexualized appearance was overlooked because the character was a [...] "breath of fresh air". However, Roby felt that though Lara Croft's proportions have become more realistic, the character's personality was diluted by the developer's actions to appeal to a male audience. LesbianGamers.com's Tracy Whitelaw called the character a dichotomy, stating that though Croft is viewed as [...] "idealized" [...] with an [...] "unattainable body", the character was a great stride for the propagation of female characters as video game protagonists.|$|E

500|$|Myles McNutt from The A.V. Club wrote a mixed {{review and}} gave it a C+. He noted that the episode's closing scene, wherein Jim, Dwight, and Harry talk about Robert California ruining the company, was an example of a retcon that [...] "the shift to a world with actual {{consequences}} is certainly <b>a</b> <b>step</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> direction for the series, and one that slightly elevates 'Turf War' if not the season as a whole." [...] However, McNutt was largely critical of the writing, noting that the closure of the Binghamton branch was a [...] "cheap segue" [...] that [...] "render the show's characters as subservient to the narrative whims of the writers." [...] He argued—specifically citing the unconcernedness that the Scranton employees showed after hearing that a neighboring branch was shut down—that many of the characters' motives were not effective because they simply acted as ciphers, through which the larger plots could unfold.|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} generally {{mixed reviews}} from television sources and critics. Alex Rocha of TV Guide {{called it a}} [...] "pretty dull episode, but with some bright humorous spots [...] The episode {{looked like it had}} potential, but definitely did not perform to its best." [...] Ahsan Haque of IGN called it [...] "far from perfect" [...] but [...] "definitely a lot better than the terrible O.J. Simpson episode from last week." [...] He called the Handi-Quacks scenes [...] "fantastic" [...] and called the episode overall [...] "definitely <b>a</b> <b>step</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> direction." [...] Robin Pierson of The TV Critic said: [...] "More purpose in the plot and more jokes related to the story than usual" [...] and gave the episode 40 out of 100. Steve Heisler of The A.V. Club wrote that [...] "tonight's Family Guy was the best it's been in a looooong time". He stated that in both plotlines [...] "the game is established early [...] and the show escalates nicely", and graded the episode a B.|$|E
500|$|Meanwhile, Kościuszko {{became more}} closely {{involved}} with the political reformers, befriending Hugo Kołłątaj, Julian Ursyn Niemcewicz and others. [...] Kościuszko argued that the peasants and Jews should receive full citizenship status, as this would motivate them to help defend Poland {{in the event of}} war. [...] The political reformers centered in the Patriotic Party scored a major victory with the adoption of the Constitution of May 3, 1791. Kościuszko saw the Constitution as <b>a</b> <b>step</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> direction, but was disappointed that it retained the monarchy and did little to improve the situation of the most underprivileged, the peasants and the Jews. [...] The Commonwealth's neighbors saw the Constitution's reforms as a threat to their influence over Polish internal affairs. A year after the Constitution's adoption, on May 14, 1792, reactionary magnates formed the Targowica Confederation, which asked Russia's Tsaritsa Catherine II for help in overthrowing the Constitution. Four days later, on May 18, 1792, a 100,000-man Russian army crossed the Polish border, headed for Warsaw, beginning the Polish–Russian War of 1792.|$|E

500|$|The Naval Institute's Proceedings {{magazine}} devoted {{space in}} two of its 1902 issues to possible improvements in battleship design. The first article was authored by Lieutenant Matt H. Signor, who argued for a ship with [...] and /40 caliber guns in four triple turrets. The secondary battery would be composed of /60 guns. This paper provoked enough thought that Proceedings published comments on the story from Captain William M. Folger, Professor P.R. Alger and naval constructor David W. Taylor—an up-and-coming officer and future head of the Bureau of Construction and Repair (C). These comments expressed doubt that the proposed vessel could be modified into a feasible design, but they praised his thoughts as <b>a</b> <b>step</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> direction. Alger believed that Signor {{was on the right}} track in suggesting larger armament, though he thought that triple turrets would be unworkable and eight 12-inch guns in four twin turrets would be a much more realistic arrangement. Naval historian Norman Friedman believes that {{this was one of the}} [...] "earliest serious proposals for a homogeneous big-gun battery." ...|$|E
500|$|The Maniac Mansion team {{wanted to}} retain the {{structure}} of a text-based adventure game, but without the standard command-line interface. Gilbert and Winnick were frustrated by the genre's text parsers and frequent game over screens. While in college, Gilbert had enjoyed Colossal Cave Adventure and the games of Infocom, but he disliked their lack of visuals. He found the inclusion of graphics in Sierra On-Line games, such as King's Quest, to be <b>a</b> <b>step</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> direction. However, these games still require the player to type, and to guess which commands must be input. In response, Gilbert programmed a point-and-click graphical user interface that displays every possible command. Fox had made a similar attempt to streamline Lucasfilm's earlier [...] and he conceived the entirety of Maniac Mansions interface, according to Gilbert. Forty input commands were planned at first, but the number was gradually reduced to 12. Gilbert finished the Maniac Mansion engine—which he later named [...] "Script Creation Utility for Maniac Mansion" [...] (SCUMM)—after roughly one year of work. Although the game was designed for the Commodore 64, the SCUMM engine allowed it to be ported easily to other platforms.|$|E

500|$|CNN's Lisa Respers France {{said the}} episode {{failed to meet}} her expectations. She was {{concerned}} that Mercedes' plot may lead towards the character becoming unlikeable, and criticized Holly's sudden departure. Though she enjoyed Sunshine's return, seeing Kurt and Blaine at McKinley and Mercedes' solo, she noted [...] "all of those moments were fleeting and only contributed to the uneven feel of the show." [...] Amy Reiter of the Los Angeles Times called it a [...] "quirky mixed bag, packed with amusing bits and pieces but very little emotional (or musical) oomph.". Myles McNutt of The A.V. Club graded the episode [...] "C". He suggested that its purpose was to address two criticisms of the show: the under-use of its supporting cast members, and the [...] "maniacal behavior" [...] of Sue. McNutt wrote, [...] "not only was the execution on these endeavors spotty at best and outright obnoxious at worst, but the growing futility of continuity in this series renders any and all developments wholly temporary. This episode was not <b>a</b> <b>step</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> direction {{so much as it}} was an escalator to nowhere: A week from now, the chances of any of this resonating in the show itself is slim to none." [...] He felt that Mercedes has become a prop, rather than a character, and criticized the episode for attributing her blame for the marginalization the writers have subjected her to.|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} {{positive to}} fair reviews. Alan Sepinwall, television journalist for The Star-Ledger, said [...] "Boys' Club" [...] was funnier that previous episode and included scenes with good physical comedy involving Leslie, particularly when she spilled the beer bottles; he also praised Andy's [...] "naked crutch chase". Matt Fowler of IGN said the episode {{gave a little}} more insight into Leslie's [...] "aspirations about {{wanting to be a}} woman who succeeds in government, which is <b>a</b> <b>step</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> direction", but Fowler said her constant mistakes and wrong decisions bog down the story. Fowler said {{the best part of the}} episode was Andy's subplot, particularly the scene in which he hops down the street naked on his crutches. Keith Phipps of The A.V. Club gave the episode a B- grade, and said the Amy Poehler character needs to be more fully formed in future episodes. Phipps said most of the show's laughs came from supporting characters Andy, Tom and Ron; he also particularly praised Ron's shutdown of Leslie's hearing and his monologues of the ideal government: [...] "One guy, who sits in a small room at a desk. And the only thing he’s allowed to decide is who to nuke." [...] Jeremy Medina of Entertainment Weekly liked that the episode included a moral crisis of sorts for Leslie, who he described as [...] "a realized character instead of a caricature".|$|E
500|$|... "Tallahassee" [...] {{received}} largely positive {{reviews from}} critics, with many {{noting that the}} Florida story-line gave the series a focus. TV Equals noted that the episode was [...] "one of the best episodes of The Office this the season and [...] {{one of the better}} episodes from the last couple of seasons." [...] Brian Marder from Hollywood.com wrote a largely positive review, noting that [...] "Overall, tonight represented a significant step back in the right direction – and hope that maybe the series still has hope... More promisingly, the humor was top-notch, funnily similar to the effortless comedy of early seasons and refreshingly dissimilar to the forced, uncharacteristic stuff that has pervaded season 8." [...] Bret Davinger from the California Literary Review noted that [...] "A couple of weeks ago, I complained about The Office spending too much time away from the office. How was I to know that taking a trip to Tallahassee would produce probably the best episode of the season and maybe one of the best episodes of the past couple of seasons?" [...] Davinger went on to note that the change in scenery from the office set to Tallahassee was working for the series. In addition, he noted that episode did not feature any hints of Erin's desire to stay in Florida or Cathy's attempt to seduce Jim, a move he hoped would be permanent. [...] Jeffrey Hyatt from Screencrave awarded the episode an 8 out of 10 and wrote that [...] "between 'Special Project' and 'Tallahassee' it’s fair to say that The Office is on a nice little run. Everything good and funny about last week's episode spilled over to 'Tallahassee'." [...] TV Fanatic reviewer Dan Forcella awarded the episode four out of five stars. Despite praising the episode for coming [...] "together {{as one of the best}} Office episodes of the season," [...] he criticized Dwight's main plot, calling it [...] "not funny." [...] The Filtered Lens reviewer Matt Dougherty called the episode [...] "solid" [...] and noted [...] "While 'Tallahassee' was not quite as good as last week, it still is <b>a</b> <b>step</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> direction for this struggling show." [...] He ultimately awarded the episode a 7 out of 10. Many reviews praised the episode's cold opening, with many critics calling it one of the funniest openings of the eighth season. What Culture! reviewer Jeffrey Kratzer, despite awarding the episode three out of five stars, wrote, Tallahassee' was so enjoyable (for the most part) that [...] next few episodes look to be the excitement and focused momentum we've been waiting for all season." ...|$|E
