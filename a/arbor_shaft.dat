50|$|Wobble blade or wobble dado or {{adjustable}} dado {{consists of}} a circular blade mounted on an adjustable multi-piece hub, that varies {{the angle of the}} blade to the <b>arbor</b> <b>shaft.</b> The width of the dado cut increases as the angle gets farther from the radial normal (90Â°) to the arbor. While it is possible to adjust the thickness of the cut while the saw is mounted on the arbor, accurate adjustment is usually difficult because tightening the arbor nut often changes the adjustment. Also, because of their inherent geometry wobble blades can only produce a flat-bottomed dado at one width setting, which may be a disadvantage in certain joinery operations. Another disadvantage of a wobble dado over stacked dado is undesirable vibrations. The magnitude of these vibrations varies with the blade's angular offset. In other words, the wider the dado, the stronger the vibrations.|$|E
