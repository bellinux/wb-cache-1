Some tappets had a threaded adjuster, but simpler engines could be adjusted by grinding down the ends of the valve stem directly. As the adjustment gap need only be expanded over the engine's working life (re-grinding valves into their valve seats during de-coking makes them sit lower, thus closing up the tappet gap), adjustment by removing metal was acceptable. Care was obviously needed, to not remove too much. Eventually the valves would be replaced entirely, a relatively common operation for engines of this era.|$|R
5000|$|A Toploader {{transmission}} is a manually shifted {{three and four}} speed gearbox introduced in 1963 by the Ford Motor Company to replace the BorgWarner T-10. It was used in most Fords and Mercurys from 1964 until 1973 {{as well as some}} foreign models. Officially designated the 3.03 three speed or Ford design four speed. The 3.03 is the centerline distance between counter shaft and mainshaft. The Toploader got its name {{from the fact that the}} <b>access</b> <b>plate</b> to the inner workings was located on the top of the main case as opposed to the side, a convention used on most gearboxes such as the Ford Dagenham or GM's Saginaw or Muncie. This feature increased the rigidity of the case significantly. Distinguishing the three speed from the four is as simple as counting the fasteners on the top plate. The four speed has ten; the three, nine. Both the three and four speed top loader gearboxes were designed to function in constant mesh, due to synchronizer sleeves being used instead of sliding gears, and be fully synchronized, with the exception of reverse. Forward gears are helical-type while reverse gear including the exterior of the first and second synchronizers sleeve are spur-type gears. This {{transmission is}} also known as the Tremec T-170, HEH, or RUG depending on the year(s) of production. [...] At some point in the early 70's production was moved to Mexico and the name was changed to Tremec.|$|E

40|$|Background Biomechanical {{research}} {{directed at}} devel-oping customized implant solutions for rib fracture fixation {{is essential to}} reduce the complexity and to increase the reliability of rib osteosynthesis. Without a simple and reliable implant solution, surgical stabilization of rib frac-tures will remain underutilized despite proven benefits for select indications. This article summarizes the research, development, and testing of a specialized and compre-hensive implant solution for rib fracture fixation. Methods An implant system for rib fracture fixation was developed in three phases: first, research on rib biome-chanics was conducted to better define the form and function of ribs. Second, research results were imple-mented to derive an implant system comprising anatomical plates and intramedullary rib splints. Third, the function-ality of anatomic plates and rib splints was evaluated {{in a series of}} biomechanical tests. Results Geometric analysis of the rib surface yielded a set of anatomical rib plates that traced the rib surface over a distance of 13 – 15 cm without the need for plate contour-ing. Structurally, the flexible design of anatomic plates did not increase the native stiffness of ribs while restoring 77 % of the native rib strength. Intramedullary rib splints with a rectangular cross-section provided 48 % stronger fracture fixation than traditional intramedullary fixation with Kirs-chner wires. Conclusion The anatomic plate set can simplify rib fracture fixation by minimizing the need for plate con-touring. Intramedullary fixation with rib splints provides a less-invasive fixation alternative for posterior rib fracture, where <b>access</b> for <b>plating</b> is limited. The combination of anatomic plates and intramedullary splints provides a comprehensive system to manage the wide range of frac-tures encountered in flail chest injuries...|$|R
40|$|This study {{addresses}} and evaluates {{the use of}} high fidelity Large Eddy Simulation (LES) for the prediction of Conjugate Heat Transfer (CHT) of an impinging jet at a Reynolds num-ber of 23 000, a Mach number of 0. 1 and for a nozzle to plate distance of H/D = 2. For such simulations mesh point local-ization {{as well as the}} turbulent model and the numerical scheme are known to be of primary importance. In this context, a com-pressible unstructured third order in time and space LES solver is assessed through the use of WALE sub-grid scale model in a wall-resolved methodology. All simulations discussed in this document well recover main unsteady flow features (the jet core development, the impinging region, the deviation of the flow and the wall jet region) as well as the mean statistics of velocity. Con-vergence of the wall mesh resolution is investigated by use of 3 meshes and predictions are assessed in terms of wall friction and heat flux. The meshes are based either on full tetrahedral cells or on a hybrid strategy with prism layers at the wall and tetrahedral elsewhere. The hybrid strategy allows reaching good discretiza-tion of the boundary layers with a reasonable number of cells. Unsteady flow features retrieved in the jet core, shear layer, im-pinging region and wall jet region are analyzed and linked to the unsteady and mean heat flux measured at the wall. To finish, a LES based CHT computation relying on the finer grid is used to <b>access</b> the <b>plate</b> temperature distribution.

Replicated Hester-Dendy multiple samplers (MPS's) were used to manipulate prey refuges by adjusting the spacing between plates while keeping surface area and complexity (heterogeneity) constant. Where plates were closely spaced, predators could not gain access {{to the surface of the}} MPS's to capture prey; wide spacing permitted access by all predators, while small predators only could gain <b>access</b> to <b>plate</b> surfaces where the spacing was intermediate. Densities of macroinvertebrate colonizers on MPS's were monitored after 7, 14, 21 and 29 days in the stream. Density (all species combined) and morphoscpecies richness of macroinvertebrates colonizing MPS's over a 29 -day period decreased in the order close > intermediate = large spacing providing evidence of a beneficial effect of refuges on prey assemblages. There was also a trend towards greater abundance of colonizers on MPS's with increasing time. Densities of the majority of taxa were highest on MPS's with close spacing, but not all taxa exhibited increased abundance with time. The thiarid snail, Brotia hainanensis, which was not eaten by Ctenogobious duospilus, was the only macroinvertebrate taxon to exhibit significantly lower densities on MPS's with close spacing. Abundance was greater on MPS's with intermediate and wide spacing. By contrast, densities of those macroinvertebrate taxa which were vulnerable to fish predation were enhanced by the refuges on closely-spaced MPS's. In order to confirm the importance of refuges in reducing predator impacts, replicated MPS's with close and wide spacing were enclosed individually inside coarse-meshed (3. 5 mm) net bags and placed in the stream. The bags prevented predator access but not allowed macroinvertebrate colonization. Faunal densities were monitored after 14 and 28 days colonization. Macroinvertebrate densities (all species combined as well as individual taxa) and morphospecies richness on MPS's enclosed in nets were rather similar after 14 and 28 days regardless of spacing treatment. Where inter-treatment differences were noted, there was no consistent trend: i. e., some taxa were more numerous in the closely-spaced treatment, whereas the abundance of others (and densities of all species combined) was greater in the wide-spacing treatment. In essence, the beneficial effects of refuges on prey density and morphospecies richness disappeared when predators were excluded. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|The {{first part}} {{described}} a versatile TVC test rig {{capable of a}} continuously variable length-to-depth ratio (L/D) of the cavity and optical <b>access</b> through quartz <b>plates</b> provided on three sides for visualization. Flame stabilization in the single cavity TVC was successfully achieved with methane as fuel {{and the range of}} flow conditions for stable operation were identified. From these, a few cases were selected for detailed experimentation, the results of which were presented in part- 1. The results indicated that reducing L/D ratio and increasing cavity-air velocity favour stable combustion. In the present paper, numerical simulations are performed to ascertain reasons for some of the trends. The predicted temperatures at the exit showed reasonably good agreement with measured values. The experiments are also performed for different flow conditions to ascertain stability limits of the combustor. Insight from these set of experiments along with simulations has highlighted the importance of air and fuel injection strategies in the cavity. It was observed in the experiments that for certain cases involving moderate cavity-air velocity, the flame tend to blowout whereas at higher and lower cavity-air velocities, the flame was observed to be stable. This observation could be explained based on understanding obtained from simulations. From a mixing and combustion efficiency standpoint, it is desirable to have a cavity vortex that is anti-clockwise. However, natural tendency for flow over a cavity is to form a vortex that is clockwise. The tendency to blowout at higher inlet flow velocities is thought to be because of these two opposing effects. This basic understating of cavity flow dynamics can be used for further design improvements in future to improve flame stability at higher inlet flow velocities...|$|R
40|$|Despite {{the fact}} that fructans are the main {{constituent}} of water-soluble carbohydrates in forage grasses and cereal crops of temperate climates, little knowledge {{is available on the}} regulation of the enzymes involved in fructan metabolism. The analysis of enzyme activities involved in this process has been hampered by the low affinity of the fructan enzymes for sucrose and fructans used as fructosyl donor. Further, the analysis of fructan composition and enzyme activities is restricted to specialized labs with access to suited HPLC equipment and appropriate fructan standards. The degradation of fructan polymers with high degree of polymerization (DP) by fructan exohydrolases (FEHs) to fructosyloligomers is important to liberate energy in the form of fructan, but also under conditions where the generation of low DP polymers is required. Based on published protocols employing enzyme coupled endpoint reactions in single cuvettes, we developed a simple and fast kinetic 1 -FEH assay. This assay can be performed in multi-well plate format using plate readers to determine the activity of 1 -FEH against 1 -kestotriose, resulting in a significant time reduction. Kinetic assays allow an optimal and more precise determination of enzyme activities compared to endpoint assays, and enable to check the quality of any reaction with respect to linearity of the assay. The enzyme coupled kinetic 1 -FEH assay was validated in a case study showing the expected increase in 1 -FEH activity during cold treatment. This assay is cost effective and could be performed by any lab with <b>access</b> to a <b>plate</b> reader suited for kinetic measurements and readings at 340 nm, and is highly suited to assess temporal changes and relative differences in 1 -FEH activities.

The stub of the Wheeling and Lake Erie connection remained under the Eagle Avenue Viaduct until track removal began in the Penn Central era, {{but it was never}} used. The Erie-Lackawanna commuter train to Youngstown, Ohio was the last train to use the C.U.T., arriving and departing weekdays from Track 14. The last eastbound run was on January 14, 1977, and track removal was begun immediately after the final departure ...|$|R
40|$|As {{instructors}} who teach laboratory courses in biological psychology/behavioral neuroscience, we {{have often been}} {{at a loss to}} find appropriate experiments where students are able to play both the role of experimenter and subject. The difficulty arises because there are few biological parameters representing CNS activity that can ethically be examined in human participants. As a result, the go-to experiments that allow students to act as both experimenter and subject tend to be electrophysiological in nature (e. g., EEG, GSR, etc.). It was our desire to create a laboratory module that would allow students to collect and analyze a biochemical measure of human neural activity. We report here the development of an experiment module that utilizes an easily obtainable enzyme immunoassay (EIA) kit (nearly identical to the ELISA) to measure human salivary cortisol. Cortisol is a hormone of the adrenal cortex that {{can be used as a}} peripheral indicator of hypothalamic neural activity. Plasma (and salivary) cortisol levels rise due to circadian influences as well as perturbations in the organism’s environment (i. e., stressors) that make it possible to detect rather robust experimental effects. Also, there has been much debate on the role of cortisol and hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis dysregulation in the pathophysiology of depression making for a clinically relevant extension to the lecture portion dealing with the “stress axis” (hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal or HPA axis). Collection of salivary cortisol is simple, painless, and non-invasive and can be performed at any time the subject desires. Sample storage is convenient as the samples can be kept in a home freezer. Repeated freeze-thaws do not adversely affect the determination of cortisol levels, so the students can just bring them in on the day of the assay without need of in-transport refrigeration or instructor/student coordination. The assay can be performed successfully by anyone with <b>access</b> to a <b>plate</b> reader and a few commonly-used laboratory items. A single plate assay can be completed in two hours (two to three hours by an inexperienced group of students under supervision). With the available cortisol kit, our students have examined both circadian effects and stressor/relaxation effects on salivary cortisol levels in a laboratory class setting. The module has been employed twice and we intend to include it in each semester that the course is taught. One further impact of the module is that studen...|$|R
40|$|A {{force that}} is applied {{dynamically}} {{in a short period}} of time is called an impact force (shock wave). Due to the concentrated application of force on a small area in a fraction of a second, unique applications have emerged that other types of loadings are not capable of performing. Explosions, an impact of a hammer, impact of waves on a shore wall, or the collision of two automobiles are examples where impact waves occur. In this research the effects of impact on solid materials and the motion of stress waves due to the impact are studied and some of their industrial applications are described.   The primary objective of this work is further development of some elastic and plastic impact wave methods, aiming to reduce the energy consumption of explosive welding (EXW) as well as the cost of NDT technologies. Many numerical simulations and a vast amount of experimental work were employed to reach this goal.   The impact wave creates elastic deformations that move the particles of the body. In this research we focused on dimensional measurement by calculating the time of wave travel between the source of energy and a discontinuity in the part studied. The impact echo (IE) method can be used for determining the location and extent of all kinds of flaws, such as cracks, de-lamination, holes and de-bonding in concrete structures, columns and hollow cylinders with different cross-sections and materials. In the present study, simulation of the impact-echo method was carried out numerically using direct and indirect methods. In the direct method a steel ball directly impacts on the upper surface of a concrete plate-like structure, whereas in the indirect method the impact impulse transmits to the concrete plate via a steel bar, in order to adapt the method for situations where there is no <b>access</b> to the <b>plate</b> being measured. In each method a two-dimensional finite element analysis (in axisymmetric geometry) was performed for the thickness measurement of concrete plates using the LS-DYNA program. Numerical results are presented for different values of plate thickness and different projectile speeds for both the direct and the indirect method and the indirect results are validated by comparison with the results obtained by the direct method. The method was validated against experimental measurements.   A high energy impact wave produces plastic deformations in metals. In this research explosive welding was studied as an application of high energy impact waves. A new method for joining different, non-compatible metals (Al and Cu-based materials) was introduced. This method may be extended for use in offshore applications. Many 3 -D numerical simulations were performed using the ABAQUS explicit commercial software. The model was validated against experimental measurements.   The outcome of this research work could be summarized as follows: a)   Introducing an indirect IE method in NDT technology for thickness measurement in particularly inaccessible structures. b)   Introducing a new, grooved method in EXW technology to join surfaces made of different materials, in particular Al-Cu joints. The results could be employed to reduce the energy consumption and cost associated with EXW and IE technologies. The methodology can be used in many other applications in all kinds of process industries...|$|R
40|$|Trapped Vortex Combustor (TVC) is a {{relatively}} new concept for potential use in gas turbine engines addressing ever increasing demands of high efficiency, low emissions, low pressure drop, and improved pattern factor. This concept holds promise for future because of its inherent advantages over conventional swirl-stabilized combustors. The main difference between TVC and a conventional gas turbine combustor is in the way combustion is stabilized. In conventional combustors, flame is stabilized because of formation of toroidal flow pattern in the primary zone due to interaction between incoming swirling air and fuel flow. On the other hand, in TVC, there is a physical cavity in the wall of combustor with continuous injection of air and fuel leading to stable and sustained combustion. Past work related to TVC has focussed on use of two cavities in the combustor liner. In the present study, a single cavity combustor concept is evaluated through simulation and experiments for applications requiring compact combustors such as Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) and cruise missiles. In the present work, numerical simulations were initially performed on a planar, rectangular single-cavity geometry to assess sensitivity of various parameters and to design a single-cavity TVC test rig. A water-cooled, modular, atmospheric pressure TVC test rig is designed and fabricated for reacting and non-reacting flow experiments. The unique features of this rig consist of a continuously variable length-to-depth ratio (L/D) of the cavity and optical <b>access</b> through quartz <b>plates</b> provided on three sides for visualization. Flame stabilization in the single cavity TVC was successfully achieved with methane as fuel, and the range of flow conditions for stable operation were identified. From these, a few cases were selected for detailed experimentation. Reacting flow experiments for the selected cases indicated that reducing L/D ratio and increasing cavity-air velocity favour stable combustion. The pressure drop across the single-cavity TVC is observed to be lower as compared to conventional combustors. Temperatures are measured at the exit using thermocouples and corrected for radiative losses. Species concentrations are measured at the exit using an exhaust gas analyzer. The combustion efficiency is observed to be around 98 - 99 % and the pattern factor is observed to be in the range of 0. 08 to 0. 13. High-speed imaging made possible by the optical access indicates that the overall combustion is fairly steady, and there is no major vortex shedding downstream. This enabled steady-state simulations to be performed for the selected cases. Insight from simulations has highlighted the importance of air and fuel injection strategies in the cavity. From a mixing and combustion efficiency standpoint, it is desirable to have a cavity vortex that is anti-clockwise. However, the natural tendency for flow over a cavity is to form a vortex that is clockwise. The tendency to blow-out at higher inlet flow velocities is thought to be because of these two opposing effects. This interaction helps improve mixing, however leads to poor flame stability unless cavity-air velocity is strong enough to support a strong anti-clockwise vortex in the cavity. This basic understating of cavity flow dynamics can be used for further design improvements in future to improve flame stability at higher inlet flow velocities and eventually lead {{to the development of a}} practical combustor...|$|R
