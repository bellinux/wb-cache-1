5|$|Frederick rewarded {{him with}} Order of the Black Eagle {{on the field}} after the Battle of Rossbach; he had already {{received}} the Pour le Mérite for his action at the Battle of Kolin. Although estranged from Frederick for several years, the two were reconciled during Seydlitz's final illness. Seydlitz died in 1773, and Frederick's heirs included {{his name on the}} Equestrian statue of Frederick the Great in Berlin, in <b>a</b> <b>place</b> <b>of</b> <b>honor.</b>|$|E
5|$|Certain {{elements}} of the character are drawn from the real Colbert's personal life. Both the real Colbert and the character were raised in Charleston, South Carolina; both are the youngest of 11 children; both played Dungeons & Dragons as teenagers; and both are practicing Roman Catholics. Colbert's own interest in and knowledge of religion, science fiction, and J. R. R. Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings story will often show through in the Report. His character has a chocolate portrait of Viggo Mortensen (who portrayed Aragorn in Peter Jackson's The Lord of the Rings films) in <b>a</b> <b>place</b> <b>of</b> <b>honor</b> on his shelf; Mortensen briefly reprised the role of Aragorn in the Reports September 13, 2007 episode. He also owns a Sting sword presented to him by Peter Jackson.|$|E
60|$|The binding was unexceptionable; and Lillie {{assigned}} it <b>a</b> proper <b>place</b> <b>of</b> <b>honor</b> {{among her}} wedding-gear. Alas! {{she had not}} looked into it, nor seen what dangers to her power were lodged between its leaves.|$|R
50|$|The Norman {{languages}} of the Channel Islands enjoy a certain status under {{the governments of}} their Bailiwicks and within the regional and lesser-used language framework of the British-Irish Council. The Anglo-Norman language, a variant of Norman once the official language of England, today holds mostly <b>a</b> <b>place</b> <b>of</b> ceremonial <b>honor</b> in the United Kingdom (now referred to as Law French).|$|R
50|$|Catechists {{have always}} been of {{particular}} importance in large geographical parishes, such as in Africa, where priests have historically only been able to visit different parts of their parish periodically. In the priest's absence, the parish catechist takes {{on the role of}} being the main teacher of the faith in that parish. As such they are afforded <b>a</b> particular <b>place</b> <b>of</b> <b>honor</b> within their parish community.|$|R
5|$|In early July 1937, the BSA {{held its}} first {{national}} Scout jamboree in Washington, D. C., attended by 25,000Scouts and Scouters. In addition to overseeing the innovative event itself, Goodman's public relations service did yeoman work to ensure extensive news media coverage. A jamboree press tent accommodated 626 news media reporters, photographers, and broadcasters. Sixty-four news releases were issued and the public relations service assisted {{in the making of}} 11newsreels and 53magazine articles. The three major U.S. radio networks of the time, NBC, CBS and Mutual, all set up complete broadcasting studios near the jamboree headquarters to produce almost 19hours of live, on-site jamboree coverage broadcast coast-to-coast. Celebrities also visited the jamboree, including well-known broadcaster Lowell Thomas and U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt. While at the jamboree, Scouts also attended a three-game baseball series between the Washington Senators and the Boston Red Sox at Griffith Stadium, with Goodman arranging for Eagle Scouts to have <b>a</b> <b>place</b> <b>of</b> <b>honor</b> with President Roosevelt in the stands (pictured).|$|E
25|$|In {{front of}} the iconostasis is the bishop's chair, <b>a</b> <b>place</b> <b>of</b> <b>honor</b> where a visiting bishop or {{metropolitan}} will often sit when visiting the church.

60|$|He still {{carried the}} spear that Jane had made, {{which he had}} prized so highly because it was her handiwork that he had caused a search {{to be made for}} it through the temple in A-lur after his release, and it had been found and brought to him. He had told her laughingly that it should have the <b>place</b> <b>of</b> <b>honor</b> above their hearth as the ancient flintlock of her Puritan {{grandsire}} had held <b>a</b> similar <b>place</b> <b>of</b> <b>honor</b> above the fireplace of Professor Porter, her father.|$|R

Members of Djenné's masons guild direct the work, while elderly members of the community, who have already participated in the festival many times, sit in <b>a</b> <b>place</b> <b>of</b> <b>honor</b> in the market square watching the proceedings.|$|E
500|$|... "Phyllis' Wedding" [...] {{was written}} by staff writer Caroline Williams and {{directed}} by Ken Whittingham, his fifth such credit for the series. Recurring guest stars Creed Bratton, Rashida Jones, and Bobby Ray Shafer appeared in the episode. The episode {{is the first of}} the series to revolve around a wedding. In an interview with Entertainment Weekly, Baumgartner described the episode, [...] "Michael plays a very important role in that wedding. He is to walk Phyllis' dad down the aisle by pushing him in a wheelchair, which in his mind is him walking Phyllis down the aisle, a very important position of authority. Of course, Phyllis has asked him to do this only so she can get six weeks of vacation time. But for him it's <b>a</b> <b>place</b> <b>of</b> <b>honor,</b> and from there, things don't go quite the way that he hopes." ...|$|E
500|$|The Corps of Cadets marks any Aggie scores during {{football}} games by firing The Spirit of '02, a 3-inch M1902 field gun [...] [...] Issued to Field Artillery Units of the Reserve Officers' Training Corps between the World Wars, {{the gun was}} believed to be one of several that were hidden by Corps members to prevent them from being scrapped during WWII. [...] The Spirit of '02 was found buried in a ditch by students cutting wood for the annual Aggie Bonfire in the fall of 1974. [...] Only the rusted steel rims from the wooden wheels were showing above ground. Students mounted antique wagon wheels on the axles and brought the gun back to <b>a</b> <b>place</b> <b>of</b> <b>honor</b> in the Quad. [...] Cadets later restored the gun, which has been fired to celebrate touchdowns since 1984.|$|E
5000|$|The second exemplar (painted ca. 1851) of {{the three}} {{versions}} of Carl Spitzweg's most famous work “”, occupies <b>a</b> special <b>place</b> <b>of</b> <b>honor</b> in this climate-controlled room, only having any light shone on it {{when there is a}} Rare Books Room program taking place in order to further preserve it. The donor, Rene Von Schleinitz, gave his collection of German Romantic paintings to the Milwaukee Art Museum, but reserved this one especially for the Milwaukee Public Library.|$|R
25|$|Because of its {{historical}} location {{at the capital}} of the former Eastern Roman (Byzantine) Empire and its role as the Mother Church of most modern Orthodox churches, the Ecumenical Patriarchate holds <b>a</b> special <b>place</b> <b>of</b> <b>honor</b> within Orthodoxy and serves as the seat for the Ecumenical Patriarch, who enjoys the status of Primus inter pares (first among equals) among the world's Eastern Orthodox prelates and is widely regarded as the representative and spiritual leader of the world's 300 million Orthodox Christians.|$|R
50|$|Originally the {{recipients}} of The Order of the Engabu received a breast star that is 90 millimeters in diameter. This star is worn at Empango ceremonies or other appropriate formal occasions, {{and members of the}} order sit in <b>a</b> special <b>place</b> <b>of</b> <b>honor</b> during the Empango events. Originally recipients of the Order of the Engabu were required to attend the Empango ceremony within a few years of receiving the order, but as of May 7, 2014 this practice has been waived.|$|R
500|$|Variety {{film critic}} Justin Chang {{wrote that the}} film's {{narrative}} structure was unable to handle the philosophical dimension of the plot, and that Prometheus was lazily deferring key plot points under the presumption that a sequel would be made. The Guardian's Peter Bradshaw wrote that Prometheus was [...] "more grandiose, more elaborate—but less interesting" [...] than Alien, and lacked the latter's [...] "central killer punch". Ian Nathan of Empire magazine was unimpressed by Rapace—whom he described as an unconvincing lead—and said that with [...] "a lack of suspense, threadbare characters, and a very poor script, the stunning visuals, gloopy madness, and sterling Fassbenderiness can't prevent Prometheus feeling like Aliens poor relation." [...] The Village Voices Nick Pinkerton wrote that the film is [...] "prone to shallow ponderousness", and that Scott [...] "can still mimic the appearance of an epic, noble, important movie—but the appearance is all." [...] He criticized Rapace and Marshall-Green for failing to instill interest in their characters' relationship, but added: [...] "there are a few set pieces here that will find <b>a</b> <b>place</b> <b>of</b> <b>honor</b> among aficionados of body horror and all things clammy and viscous".|$|E
500|$|As {{commanding}} officer, McCain {{relied upon}} a relatively unorthodox leadership style {{based upon the}} force of his personality. [...] He removed personnel he thought ineffective, and sought to improve morale and productivity by establishing an informal rapport with enlisted men. Dealing with limited post-Vietnam defense budgets and parts shortages, he was forceful in demanding that respect be given the female officers just beginning to arrive into the unit. [...] McCain's leadership abilities were credited with improving the unit's aircraft readiness; for the first time, all fifty of its aircraft were able to fly. Although some operational metrics declined during the period, the pilot safety improved to the point of having zero accidents. The squadron was awarded its first-ever Meritorious Unit Commendation, while McCain received a Meritorious Service Medal. McCain later stated that being commanding officer of VA-174 was the most rewarding assignment of his naval career. When his stint ended in July 1977, the change of command ceremony was attended by his father {{and the rest of his}} family, as well as some of his fellow POWs; speaker Admiral Isaac C. Kidd, Jr. said that John had joined Jack and Slew McCain in <b>a</b> <b>place</b> <b>of</b> <b>honor</b> in Navy tradition, a tribute that deeply moved McCain.|$|E
500|$|In the volume, Stanton did {{not mention}} the Liberty Party's plank on woman {{suffrage}} pre-dating the Seneca Falls Convention by a month, and she did not describe the Worcester National Women's Rights Convention, organized by Stone and Davis in 1850, as the beginning of the women's rights movement. Rather, Stanton named the 1840 Anti-Slavery Convention in London as the birth of the [...] "movement for woman's suffrage, in both England and America". She positioned the Seneca Falls meeting as her own political debut, and characterized it as the beginning of the women's rights movement, calling it [...] "the greatest movement for human liberty recorded on the pages of history—a demand for freedom to one-half the entire race." [...] Stanton worked to enshrine the Declaration of Sentiments as a foundational treatise in a number of ways, {{not the least of which}} was by imbuing the small, three-legged tea table upon which the first draft of it was composed an importance similar to that of Thomas Jefferson's desk upon which he wrote the Declaration of Independence. The M'Clintocks gave Stanton the table, then Stanton gave it to Susan B. Anthony on the occasion of her 80th birthday, though Anthony had no part in the Seneca Falls meeting. In keeping with Stanton's promotion of the table as an iconic relic, women's rights activists put it in <b>a</b> <b>place</b> <b>of</b> <b>honor</b> at the head of the casket at the funeral of Susan B. Anthony on March 14, 1906. Subsequently, it was displayed prominently on the stage at each of the most important suffrage meetings until 1920, even though the grievance and resolution about woman suffrage was not written on it. The table is kept at the Smithsonian Institution's National Museum of American History in Washington, D.C.|$|E
5000|$|In 1965, The Cooperative Education and Internship Association (CEIA) created [...] "The Dean Herman Schneider Award" [...] in <b>honor</b> <b>of</b> the {{contributions}} made by Dean Schneider in cooperative education. The award is given annually to an outstanding educator from faculty or administration. In 2006 The University of Cincinnati established the Cooperative Education Hall <b>of</b> <b>Honor</b> [...] "to give <b>a</b> permanent <b>place</b> <b>of</b> <b>honor</b> {{to individuals and}} organizations that have made a significant qualitative difference in the advancement of Cooperative Education {{for the benefit of}} students".|$|R
5000|$|Awards can {{be given}} by any person or institution, {{although}} the prestige of an award usually depends {{on the status of}} the awarder. Usually, awards are given by an organization of some sort, or by the office of an official within an organization or government. For instance, a special presidential citation (as given by the President of the United States) is a public announcement giving <b>an</b> official <b>place</b> <b>of</b> <b>honor</b> (e.g., President Ronald Reagan gave a special presidential citation in 1984 to the Disney Channel for its excellent children's television programming.) ...|$|R
25|$|The Temple of Mars Ultor, {{dedicated}} in 2 BC in {{the center}} of the Forum of Augustus, gave the god <b>a</b> new <b>place</b> <b>of</b> <b>honor.</b> Some rituals previously conducted within the cult of Capitoline Jupiter were transferred to the new temple, which became the point of departure for magistrates as they left for military campaigns abroad. Augustus required the Senate to meet at the temple when deliberating questions of war and peace. The temple also became the site at which sacrifice was made to conclude the rite of passage of young men assuming the toga virilis ("man's toga") around age 14.|$|R

25|$|For {{its first}} three years, the Russian Free Press went on {{printing}} without selling a single copy and scarcely {{being able to}} get a single copy introduced into Russia; so when at last a bookseller bought ten shillings worth of Baptized Property, the half-sovereign was set aside by the surprised editors in <b>a</b> special <b>place</b> <b>of</b> <b>honor.</b> The death <b>of</b> the emperor Nicholas in 1855 led to a complete change. Herzen's writings, and the magazines he edited, were smuggled wholesale into Russia, and their words resounded throughout the country, as well as all over Europe. Their influence grew.|$|R

5000|$|In 1977, an {{historical}} marker honoring Bryan was erected {{in front of}} the Warren County courthouse in McMinnville. It reads, [...] "A native of Warren County, Bryan was a pioneer in the study of American folk music.

2500|$|In 1969, Luciani was {{cautious}} of {{de facto}} relationships as a lesser evil to divorce. He said that unions like those shouldn't {{be the same}} as marriage but he added that [...] "there are, in undeniably pathological family situations, painful cases. To remedy that, some propose a divorce, which, conversely, would aggravate this. But some remedy outside of divorce, you can't really find?

2500|$|Though {{the overall}} {{impression}} is successful, the painting has been faulted for lapses in execution. The drawing of Bessie's right forearm is meager, Clara's left hand is weak, and the brushwork throughout is labored. Commissioned portraits {{were expected to}} be more highly finished, and although The Sisters was given <b>a</b> <b>place</b> <b>of</b> <b>honor</b> at the Society of American Artists exhibition of 1884, it received harsh criticism for the perceived [...] "flimsiness" [...] of its details. Technical faults notwithstanding, the nobility of its composition has been compared to the portraits of Thomas Eakins.|$|E

5000|$|Adolf Hitler, as the Führer of Germany, was {{considered}} SS member #1; Emil Maurice (considered {{one of the}} founders of the SS) was member #2. Based on the seniority system of SS membership numbers, this made Hitler senior in the SS to all other members. The SS membership number system was also a means to denote the [...] "Old Guard" [...] of the SS, and to hold a number below 50,000 {{was considered}} <b>a</b> special <b>place</b> <b>of</b> <b>honor</b> since it denoted SS membership before the Nazi seizure in 1933. Numbers below 500 were considered the original cadre of the SS, while any number below fifty denoted an original founder and, in most cases, a personal associate of Hitler.|$|R
