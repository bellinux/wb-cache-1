40|$|A gastroprotective effect {{occurs when}} � 2 receptors are innervated. The dextro isomer of medetomidine, dexmedetomidine, {{is a highly}} {{selective}} � 2 -adrenoreceptor agonist. The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate whether dexmedetomidine has an <b>antiulcerative</b> effect and to show whether the antiulcer mechanism of dexmedetomidine is linked with oxidant/antioxidant parameters. The <b>antiulcerative</b> effect of dexmedetomidine was studied in an indomethacin-induced ulcer model, and some oxidant/antioxidant parameters were measured in these gastric tissues. Whereas the average ulcerous areas for the groups that received 10, 25, 50, and 100 µg/kg dexmedetomidine doses were 29 ± 4. 2, 8 ± 2. 1, 0 ± 0 and 0 ± 0 mm 2, respectively, the ulcerous area was 52. 1 ± 4. 5 mm 2 in the indomethacin control group and 0. 5 ± 0. 2 mm 2 in the famotidine group. In conclusion, the � 2 -adrenoreceptor agonist dexmedetomidine showed a significant <b>antiulcerative</b> effect in rat gastric tissue at all doses. This <b>antiulcerative</b> effect is stronger with increasing dosage; at the 50 and 100 µg/kg doses, no ulcerous areas were observed. In light of these results, we conclude that there is a correlation between antiulcer mechanisms and � 2 -receptor activation. In rats given dexmedetomidine, all of the investigated antioxidant parameters increased, except for catalase (CAT). Conversely, aside from myeloperoxidase (MPO), all oxidant parameters decreased. Therefore, oxidant/antioxidant parameters play a role in the antiulcer mechanism of dexmedetomidine. Key words...|$|E

40|$|Parkia platycephala Benth. (Leguminosae - Mimosoideae), {{popularly known}} as "visgueira", fava bean tree or "fava-de-bolota", is widely found in the Northern and Northeastern regions of Brazil.

Therefore, this study aimed at investigating the gastroprotective effect of the ethanolic extract of Parkia platycephala Benth. leaves (Pp-EtOH), as well as evaluating its possible mechanisms of action in experimental ulcer induction models. Lesions were induced by absolute ethanol, ethanol-HCl, ischemia-reperfusion and indomethacin in rodents. Pp-EtOH showed a protective effect in the lesion models (66, 48 and 52 %, respectively), but it was not able to protect gastric mucosa against indomethacin-induced lesions.

40|$|Finger millet or ragi {{is one of}} {{the ancient}} millets in India (2300 BC), and this review focuses on its antiquity, consumption, {{nutrient}} composition, processing, and health benefits. Of all the cereals and millets, finger millet has the highest amount of calcium (344 mg%) and potassium (408 mg%). It has higher dietary fiber, minerals, and sulfur containing amino acids compared to white rice, the current major staple in India. Despite finger millet's rich nutrient profile, recent studies indicate lower consumption of millets in general by urban Indians. Finger millet is processed by milling, malting, fermentation, popping, and decortication. Noodles, vermicilli, pasta, Indian sweet (halwa) mixes, papads, soups, and bakery products from finger millet are also emerging. In vitro and in vivo (animal) studies indicated the blood glucose lowering, cholesterol lowering, <b>antiulcerative,</b> wound healing properties, etc., of finger millet. However, appropriate intervention or randomized clinical trials are lacking on these health effects.

Carbamazepine (10 - 50 mg/kg i. p.) or immobilization stress alone did not induce significant analgesia for rats, but when carbamazepine {{was given in}} a combination with stress, it could produce a long-lasting analgesia which ecerted dual peal somponents (after 30 minutes and after 4 hours of prescripition). Carbamazepine produced initialy slight hypothrmia which was potentiated by immobilization stress. The effects of carbamazepine on analgesia induced by N^ 6 -cyclohecyl adenosine (CHA : 0. 2 mg/kg i. p.), an adenosine A_ 1 -receptor afonist, were an inhibition in nonstressed rats and stimulation in stressed rats. Initial cabazepine (25 mg/kg i. p.) -induced analgesia in stressed rats was antagonized bu caffeine (5 mg/kg i. p.), an adenosine antafonisr, and subsequent continuous analgesia was anatagonized by carbamazepine and morphine.

Despite the clinical significance of this ion, the mechanisms linking zinc to these cellular processes are poorly understood. We have previously identified an extracellular Zn 2 + sensing G-protein coupled receptor (ZnR) that activates Ca 2 + signaling in colonocytes, but its molecular identity {{as well as its}} effects on colonocytes ’ survival remained elusive. Here, we show that Zn 2 +, by activation of the ZnR, protects HT 29 colonocytes from butyrate induced cell death. Silencing of the G-protein coupled receptor GPR 39 expression abolished ZnR-dependent Ca 2 + release and Zn 2 +-dependent survival of butyrate-treated colonocytes. Importantly, GPR 39 also mediated ZnR-dependent upregulation of Na + /H + exchange activity as this activity was found in native colon tissue but not in tissue obtained from GPR 39 knock-out mice. Although ZnR-dependent upregulation of Na + /H + exchange reduced the cellular acid load induced by butyrate, it did not rescue HT 29 cells from butyrate induced cell death. ZnR/GPR 39 activation however, increased the expression of the antiapoptotic protein clusterin in butyrate-treated cells. Furthermore, silencing of clusterin abolished the Zn 2 +-dependent survival of HT 29 cells. Altogether, our results demonstrate that extracellular Zn 2 +, acting through ZnR, regulates intracellular pH and clusterin expression thereby enhancing survival of HT 29 colonocytes.

These issues are attracting attention in the search of new ingredients used in the prevention and improvement of these diseases. Particularly, several compounds, when added to foods, are able to positively stimulate certain biological systems leading to health improvement. Thereby, extracts obtained from the combined autolysis and hydrolysis of yeast cells possess compounds such peptides and amino acids, which eventually may control the production of inflammatory cytokines, thus leading to an anti-inflammatory activity and antitumoral properties. Thus, the main objective of the present work is to study the <b>antiulcerative</b> and antitumoral potential of yeast peptide extract for further incorporation in functional foods to prevent or improve symptoms in these chronic diseases. Peptide concentrates obtained by hydrolysis of spent brewer yeast proteins with extracts of Cynara cardunculus were studied using animal models to prove possible protection of the stomach mucosa against ulcerative lesions caused by oral administration of absolute ethanol.

40|$|AbstractUlcerative colitis is an {{inflammatory}} chronic disease {{that affects the}} mucosa and submucosa of the colon and rectum. Several types of drugs are available such as aminosalicylates. Peptic ulcer disease (PUD) is a common disorder that affects millions of individuals worldwide {{and it can be}} {{considered one of the most}} important common diseases in the world. Treatment of peptic ulcers depends on using a number of synthetic drugs that reduce the rate of stomach acid secretion (Antiacids), protect the mucous tissues that line the stomach and upper portion of the small intestine (Demulcents) or to eliminate Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori). In most cases, incidence of relapses and adverse reactions is seen in the following synthetic antiulcer therapy. Accordingly, the main concern of the current article is to introduce a safe drug (or more) of natural origin, to be used for the management of gastric ulcers without side effects. A widespread search has been launched to identify new anti-ulcer therapies from natural sources.

30|$|Global {{safety of}} nature {{is one of}} the major {{criteria}} in modern science and technology, and the concept of 'green chemistry' has been universally adopted to protect human health and environment. Since the last decade of the twentieth century, protection of environment has been considered as one of the major issues by the chemical scientists and R and D experts [1]. The most significant way to fulfill this eco-requirement is to avoid or reduce the use of hazardous solvents and toxic chemicals and to develop new reactions which can minimize unnecessary formation of the by-products (wastes). Development of such methodologies can provide substantial contribution to green chemistry [2],[3]. Accordingly, development of greener methods has become a significant and prevalent research topic at present age. In synthetic chemistry, the effort has been made on the development of alternative synthetic routes to undertake the desired chemical conversions with nominal exposure of toxic wastes to the environment. Synthesis of desired molecules by sonication is regarded as a substantial green approach [4],[5] to protect the environment by minimizing chemical hazards. Recent research on synthetic organic chemistry indicates that ultrasound can be used as an important device to achieve a number of chemical reactions in high yield and within a shorter reaction time [6]. On other hand, imidazole pharmacophore is present in several pharmacologically active organic molecules including natural products. For example, imidazole scaffold is present in the benzodiazepine antagonist flumazenil, amino acid histidine, the <b>antiulcerative</b> agent cimetidine, the hypnotic agent etomidate, the proton pump inhibitor omeprazole, and so on [7]. Subsequently, there is a continuous need to develop concise and rapid method for the preparation of biologically important and medicinally active imidazole derivatives.|$|E

Anti-ulcerative effects of all drugs (famotidine, omeprazole, histamine and yohimbine) were investigated on indomethacin-induced gastric ulcer model in rats. At first, mentioned drugs were given to 24 h-fasted rats. Then, 25 mg kg - 1 indomethacine was given to induce gastric ulcer. Six hours after the administration of indomethacin, the animals were euthanized with high-dose anesthetic. The stomachs of the animals were removed and the ulcerative focuses located {{on the surface of}} the stomach were macroscopically evaluated. Thereafter, all the stomachs were sent to the laboratory of biochemistry for the measurement of the levels of total glutathione, malondialdehyde and the activity of superoxide dismutase, myeloperoxidase. Mean area of ulcer was 31. 6, 1. 08 and 0. 83 mm 2 in the rats of the control, famotidine and omeprazole groups treated with indomethacin, respectively.

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. 3 -acyltetramic acids, such as reutericyclin, belong {{to a group of}} natural products which contain a 5 -membered pyrrolidine- 2, 4 -dione heterocycle with an acyl group at the 3 -position. Molecules containing this motif have been shown to contain a wealth of desirable bio-activity such as antibiotic, antitumor, antiviral, <b>antiulcerative,</b> fungicidal and cytotoxic properties. The motivation for synthetic efforts towards reutericyclin and analogues is that it has been shown to have potential as an antibiotic treatment against superbug C. difficile. Our synthetic approach used a pyrroloisoxazole bicyclic system as a masked form of the acyltetramic acid core structure, which enables us to make selective modifications towards these bio-active products and produce more analogues suitable for biological testing. We report the synthesis of several novel compounds closely related to a masked reutericyclin as well as elaborations at the C- 3 methyl group through aldol chemistry. The route began with a naturally occurring amino acid that underwent N-protection, carboxyl reduction and conversion to an oxime. This oxime is precursor to a nitrile oxide used in a 1, 3 -dipolar cycloaddition to achieve a substituted isoxazole that was deprotected and, through an intramolecular peptide coupling reaction, provided the pyrroloisoxazole core as the masked acyltetramic acid. Acylation reactions were completed upon this pyrroloisoxazole using butyllithium as a base and a range of acyl chlorides. Other developments made in this synthesis were the isolation of the chlorinated oxime and its use in a solvent study and significant improvements in the peptide coupling reaction.

40|$|BACKGROUND: The size of {{the pupil}} {{diameter}} and its continuous fluctuations {{under the influence of}} factors of various origin has an important impact on the quality of vision, as well as in performing a variety of ophthalmological procedures. This seems to be of even greater importance in the case of refractive surgery, through the influence that the specific parameter has in the higher order aberrations of the eye. Additionally, the use of <b>antiulcerative</b> agents, of the H 2 -antagonist type, is quite often in patients demonstrating ophthalmic pathology. PURPOSE: With the present study, an attempt was made, to investigate, through a procedure as reliable as possible, the possible influence of ranitidine hydrochloride in the diameter of the pupil of the eye, under controlled environment of photopic and scotopic adaptation, as well as the possible clinical benefit, in relation to complication avoidance, or undesired side effects, after the administration of the specific pharmacological substance. METHODS: The specific prospective clinical study was conducted in a total of 565 patients and visitors of a large, urban primary care unit. In 362 of these persons, ranitidine hydrochloride was per os administered, by another 58, diclofenac sodium was simultaneously, per os again, used, while a separate group of 38 selected patients received the antisecretive agent esomeprazole, instead of ranitidine hydrochloride. The remaining 45 candidates formed the control group, while 62 diabetic patients were regarded as a special group that also underwent examination, through exactly the same investigative protocol. In the persons that participated in the study, the diameter of the pupil of both eyes was measured, in an averaging manner, by the use of the Colvard infrared electronic corometer, in two separate phases, under and without the influence of the untiulcerative drug, each time under photopic and scotopic adaptation status. All the measurements took place in the same location, at approximately the same time of day and were carried out by the same examiner. The conditions of ambient lighting were each time strictly controlled, while the exact values of Illuminance, extremely close to the examined eye, were continuously confirmed through the use of an electronic digital photometering device. On the other hand, during protocol application, attempt was made so that all the remaining personal and environmental parameters, that could possibly influence the measurements, were properly controlled, equalized and/or simulated. Pupil diameter values in the various prearranged phases, were each time, in -the-field, recorded, while a variety of other measurement parameters, as well as candidate characteristics, were also recorded and evaluated. The gathering data underwent further elaboration through the use of specific software in a portable personal computer. RESULTS: The various groups of patients that were selected, were comparable with regard to their demographic, clinical and other features, during the measurement procedure. The administration of ranitidine hydrochloride made it possible to obtain a, statistically significant, larger pupillary diameter, in patients examined under its influence, in comparison with the same group, examined, free from the specific drug activity, especially under scotopic conditions (we recorded 4, 32 ± 0, 52 mm, under the influence, photopic against 3, 46 ± 0, 78 mm, without the influence, photopic where p= 0, 0251 and 6, 87 ± 0, 39 mm, under the influence, scotopic against 5, 51 ± 0, 43 mm, without the influence, scotopic where p= 0, 0247, respectively). A similar deviation was also registered in a due comparison with the findings in the relative control group, in which the average pupil diameter values of the first measurement were, in a statistically significant degree, smaller (more specifically, we recorded 3, 28 ± 0, 25 mm, 1 st measurement, photopic, control against 4, 32 ± 0, 52 mm, under the influence, photopic where p= 0, 0301 and 5, 27 ± 0, 54 mm, 1 st measurement, scotopic, control against 6, 87 ± 0, 39 mm, under the influence, scotopic where p= 0, 0196), than the corresponding such, under drug influence in the main group, with the relative difference being augmented under scotopic conditions, while, on the contrary, they just failed to reach statistical significance, when the two measurements within the control group itself, were evaluated (analytically, we recorded 3, 28 ± 0, 25 mm, 1 stmeasurement, photopic, control against 3, 23 ± 0, 29 mm, 2 nd measurement, photopic, control with p= 0, 439 and 5, 27 ± 0, 54 mm, 1 st measurement, scotopic, control against 5, 74 ± 0, 22 mm, 2 nd measurement, scotopic, control with p= 0, 0528), under both of the undertaken Illumination levels. A similarly comparable condition, with differences between the average values of pupillary diameter failing to reach statistical significance (p> 0, 05 for a CI of 95 %), also prevailed amongst the measurements, when patients were treated with esomeprazole instead of ranitidine (the corresponding average values were 3, 27 ± 0, 31 mm, under PPI influence, photopic against 3, 34 ± 0, 28 mm, without PPI influence, photopic with p= 0, 632 and 5, 23 ± 0, 59 mm, under PPI influence, scotopic against 5, 52 ± 0, 24 mm, without PPI influence, scotopic with p = 0, 198).
