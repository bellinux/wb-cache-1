5|$|Beshear {{continued}} his legal practice at Stites and Harbison following his defeat by McConnell. In 2001, {{the firm was}} hired to represent creditors in <b>a</b> <b>bankruptcy</b> case against Wallace Wilkinson, Beshear's opponent in the 1987 gubernatorial primary. The firm also represented four creditors of Wallace's Bookstore, the company through which Wilkinson had made his fortune. Wilkinson unsuccessfully sought to have the firm removed from the case, citing a potential conflict of interest stemming from his old political rivalry with Beshear. The case was eventually settled in 2002, four months after Wilkinson's death.|$|E
5|$|On 23 October 2001, the Competition Authority granted {{permission}} for SAS to purchase Braathens. The rationale {{was that there}} were no other realistic purchasers for the airline, and that <b>a</b> <b>bankruptcy</b> was imminent without the take-over. As a condition, the authority decided to regulate a ban on frequent flyer programs, and stated that it would ban cross-subsidization aimed at underbidding or operating at a loss to force new entrants out of the market.|$|E

25|$|<b>A</b> Federal <b>Bankruptcy</b> Court {{judge in}} <b>a</b> Chapter 7 <b>{{bankrupt}}cy</b> must approve {{the sale of}} the bankrupt company's assets, thus adding time and expense on to the entire liquidation process. The assets sold in an assignment for the benefit of creditor process do not usually require a judge's intervention. It is this removal of the court from the liquidation process which increases the speed of the assets sold in an assignment process. This is one substantial difference from <b>a</b> regular <b>bankruptcy.</b>|$|R
5|$|Cloverleaf {{announced}} Rosecroft {{would close}} on July 1, 2010. Live racing ended in 2009, {{and the track}} only had simulcasts as revenue from off-track betting. After several of the surrounding states legalized casinos, Rosecroft was unable to continue as a successful business. Cloverleaf Enterprises filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in June 2009. Mark Vogel loaned the track $350,000 and offered to buy the track, but <b>a</b> <b>bankruptcy</b> court judge refused to approve the plan. Rosecroft officials had hoped that the Maryland General Assembly would approve legislation allowing casino-style gambling at Rosecroft, {{but that did not}} occur.

5|$|On 4 November 2010, Stabæk Holding {{stated that}} they were near <b>a</b> <b>bankruptcy,</b> and that they {{intended}} to throw out Stabæk as a tenant, remove the turf and instead use the venue exclusively for events. Chair Diderik Schnitler in Stabæk Holding stated that the business model was not sustainable. The football schedule was not made until early in the year, while in the event business, bookings were common {{one to two years}} in advance. It was therefore difficult to secure lucrative events, as large parts of the year had to be held in reserve in case the venue was needed for yet-to-be scheduled matches. The holding company {{stated that they}} might have to file for bankruptcy. Stabæk Fotball stated that they had a 40-year contract to use the venue.|$|E
5|$|Hsu {{was able}} to gain the trust of investors by his dress, by his warm and personable manner, by his {{educational}} credentials, by being quoted in trade magazines, and by {{the long list of}} business under his name, but had a record of changing addresses and leaving disappointed investors behind. Starting in 1989, Hsu raised $1 million from investors to launch a latex glove business. Some of these partners invested their life savings or mortgaged their homes, and some sued Hsu when it appeared their money was lost. In 1990, Hsu, then living in Foster City, California, declared <b>a</b> <b>bankruptcy,</b> stating that he was practically destitute, with no job, no income, and few possessions other than an SUV and a ring. That same year, he was also divorced as well as allegedly kidnapped by San Francisco Triad society gang leader Raymond Kwok Chow. In 1991, California authorities brought fraud charges against him, describing his operation as a Ponzi scheme. Specifically, authorities claimed Hsu had not engaged in any legitimate business activity, but instead was using funds from later investors to pay returns to earlier ones. In February 1992 Hsu plead no contest to one count of grand theft and agreed to serve up to three years in prison and pay a $10,000 fine. Hsu subsequently failed to appear at the sentencing hearing and a warrant was issued for his arrest.|$|E

40|$|SHOULD THERE BE <b>a</b> {{sovereign}} <b>bankruptcy</b> {{procedure for}} countries in financial distress? This paper explores {{the use of}} U. S. <b>bankruptcy</b> law as <b>a</b> model for <b>a</b> sovereign <b>bankruptcy</b> procedure and asks whether adoption of such a procedure {{would lead to a}} more orderly process of sovereign debt restructuring. It assumes that a quick and orderly debt restructuring process is more efficient than a prolonged and disorderly one, because a lengthy process of debt restructuring takes a high toll on debtor countries’ economies as well as harming creditors in general. I concentrate on three goals for <b>a</b> sovereign <b>bankruptcy</b> procedure: preventing individual credi-tors or groups of creditors from suing the debtor for repayment, prevent-ing groups of creditors from strategically delaying negotiations or acting as holdouts, and increasing the likelihood that private creditors will pro-vide new loans to sovereign debtors in financial distress, thus reducing the pressure on the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to fund bailouts. I conclude that nonbankruptcy alternatives are less likely to accomplish these goals than <b>a</b> sovereign <b>bankruptcy</b> procedure. U. S.

40|$|Does <b>an</b> entrepreneur-friendly <b>bankruptcy</b> law {{encourage}} more entrepreneurship development at a societal level? How does bankruptcy law affect entrepreneurship development around the world? Drawing {{on a real}} options perspective, we argue that if bankrupt entrepreneurs are excessively punished for failure, they may pass potentially high-return but inherently high-risk opportunities. Amassing a longitudinal, cross-country data base from 35 countries spanning ten years, we find that <b>a</b> lenient, entrepreneur-friendly <b>bankruptcy</b> law encourages entrepreneurs to take risks and thus let entrepreneurship prosper. Components of <b>an</b> entrepreneur-friendly <b>bankruptcy</b> law are: (1) the availability of <b>a</b> reorganization <b>bankruptcy</b> option, (2) the time spent on bankruptcy procedure, (3) the cost of bankruptcy procedure, (4) {{the opportunity to have}} a fresh start in liquidation bankruptcy, (5) the opportunity to have an automatic stay of assets, (6) the opportunity for managers to remain on the job after filing for bankruptcy, and (7) the protection of creditors at the time of bankruptcy. ...|$|R
