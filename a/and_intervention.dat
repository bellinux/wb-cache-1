He lavished {{attention}} on visitors {{from out of}} town, letting them stay at his palace and use his horses, and treating them to feasts. In addition to flattering them, this allowed him to monitor their activities and dealings with the colonial authorities. His clerk appointees in Jaunde informed him of the doings of both the Germans and his subjects. Atangana gained {{a substantial amount of}} wealth. He owned workshops and sold produce from five plantations to provision impressed railway construction workers.|$|E

5|$|Scandinavian Scotland {{refers to}} the period from the 8th to the 15th centuries during which Vikings and Norse settlers, mainly Norwegians {{and to a lesser}} extent other Scandinavians, and their descendents colonised parts of what is now the {{periphery}} of modern Scotland. Viking influence in the area commenced in the late 8th century, and hostility between the Scandinavian Earls of Orkney and the emerging thalassocracy of the Kingdom of the Isles, the rulers of Ireland, Dál Riata and Alba, <b>and</b> <b>intervention</b> by the crown of Norway were recurring themes.|$|E

A review of literature on past and current practices identifies how Human Resource Development activities <b>and</b> <b>interventions</b> have traditionally been evaluated objectively and what methods of objective evaluation are currently used by researchers and practitioners alike. Six methods of evaluation are presented and discussed. The implications of the literature review along with suggestions for future research and study are also presented...|$|R

5|$|The new {{treaties}} gave minorities {{the right}} to appeal directly to the League or UN General Assembly. In {{the case of the}} Mandates and the UN Partition Plan for Palestine compromissory clauses provide for the International Court's jurisdiction. The victorious powers attempted to ensure the stable development of the region between defeated Germany and Soviet Russia, a region characterized by the existence of many ethnic groups and the emergence of new nations. The idea behind the Minority Treaties was that by subjecting those countries to the scrutiny of others and to the threat of sanction <b>and</b> <b>intervention</b> from the newly created international body, the League of Nations, the rights of minorities would be safeguarded.|$|E
5|$|The {{regiment}} was reassigned from Hazen's Brigade to the Middle Department on December 6, 1781. On this date, {{a portion}} of the regiment went to Lancaster, Pennsylvania, where they guarded prisoners taken at Yorktown. They were on this detail for 10 months with prisoners under guard at Lancaster, York and Reading. The most notable prisoner under Hazen's watch during this time was 20-year-old Captain Charles Asgill. On May 3, 1782, upon orders by Washington, he was selected to hang in retaliation for the brutal summary execution of American Captain Joshua Huddy by the British. In November 1782 his life was spared after heartrending correspondence by his family <b>and</b> <b>intervention</b> by the Queen of France.|$|E
5|$|Viking {{influence}} in the area commenced in the late 8th century, and whilst {{there is no doubt}} that the Uí Ímair dynasty played a prominent role in this early period, the records for the dates and details of the rulers are speculative until the mid-10th century. Hostility between the Kings of the Isles and the rulers of Ireland, <b>and</b> <b>intervention</b> by the crown of Norway (either directly or through their vassal the Earl of Orkney) were recurring themes.|$|E

5|$|At {{the turn}} of the century, La Luz del Mundo Church began {{promoting}} women to public relations positions that were previously held by men only. As of December 2014, two women (and three men) serve as legal representatives of the church in Northern Mexico. Public relations positions that have been held by women include spokesperson, director of social communication, and assistant director of international affairs. Within church operated civil organizations women also occupy executive positions such as director of La Luz del Mundo Family Services, a violence prevention <b>and</b> <b>intervention</b> center in South Side, Milwaukee; Director of Social Work and Psychology within the Ministry of Social Welfare; director of the Samuel Joaquín Flores Foundation; president of Recab de México A.C.; and director of the Association of Students and Professionals in the USA.|$|E
5|$|The UN {{has also}} drawn {{criticism}} for perceived failures. In many cases, member states have shown reluctance to achieve or enforce Security Council resolutions. Disagreements in the Security Council about military action <b>and</b> <b>intervention</b> {{are seen as}} having failed to prevent the Bangladesh genocide in 1971, the Cambodian genocide in the 1970s, and the Rwandan genocide in 1994. Similarly, UN inaction is blamed for failing to either prevent the Srebrenica massacre in 1995 or complete the peacekeeping operations in 1992–93 during the Somali Civil War. UN peacekeepers have also been accused of child rape, soliciting prostitutes, and sexual abuse during various peacekeeping missions in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Haiti, Liberia, Sudan and what is now South Sudan, Burundi, and Ivory Coast. Scientists cited UN peacekeepers from Nepal as the likely source of the 2010–13 Haiti cholera outbreak, which killed more than 8,000 Haitians following the 2010 Haiti earthquake.|$|E
5|$|The planned coup {{was criticized}} by historians as {{unrealistic}} {{for the following}} reasons. Piłsudski's plan was based on false assumptions and faulty intelligence, which incorrectly indicated that the Sleževičius government was deeply unpopular, and that the general Lithuanian population was relatively friendly to Poland. No notable ethnic Lithuanian politicians declared support for the plan; the plan relied on support from General Žukauskas, but his support was never confirmed; Narutowicz, who was to head the civilian government, was a Pole; the PMO was weak and incapable of taking control if the coup met any significant resistance; <b>and</b> <b>intervention</b> of the Polish army would have led to bloodshed and undermined {{the idea of a}} voluntary union or alliance with Poland. The only group that supported the coup was the Polish minority in Lithuania, increasingly alienated by Lithuanian government policies. However, according to the Lithuanian census of 1923, the minority constituted 3.2% of the population outside the Vilnius Region. On the ground, the uprising was doomed by poor communication and the overeagerness of some of the PMO activists.|$|E

5|$|Unlike the British communists, Davies did {{not change}} his {{position}} when the Soviet Union entered the war in June 1941. He continued to oppose all co-operation with the Conservatives, believing that only through socialism could a just and lasting peace be achieved. Victory in 1945, and the subsequent election of a Labour government, did little to affect Davies's individualism. In the Labour years 1945–51 he opposed government policies on conscription, NATO, the development of nuclear weapons, <b>and</b> <b>intervention</b> in the Korean War. According to his biographer Robert Griffiths, it was hatred of capitalist militarism, rather than a wish to support the Soviet Union, that underlay Davies's stances. His popularity in South Wales was unaffected: he was returned to parliament in each postwar election with large majorities. In 1945–46 he served as Merthyr Tydfil's mayor, remaining on the local council until 1949.|$|E
5|$|With {{the way to}} Miltia opened, the Federation, U-TIC, and the Immigrant Fleet fight {{each other}} {{for control of the}} Zohar hidden on the planet. Shion and Allen attempt to reach Miltia, but are almost {{destroyed}} by U-TIC forces and only saved due to KOS-MOS's spontaneous activation <b>and</b> <b>intervention.</b> With help from Gaignun and the Second Miltia government, the group then launch an assault with the Elsa, destroying the Immigrant Fleet mothership before being rescued by Gaignun as the space-time distortion around Miltia vanishes. Joined by Jin and Canaan, they unlock the data within Canaan, revealing that the Immigrant Fleet has funded U-TIC since its inception, and that MOMO's father Mizrahi sacrificed himself to seal Miltia away after Albedo released the energy U-DO. After a skirmish with Margulis, the group find the Zohar and two deformed comatose Realians used to control its energy: these are Cecily and Cathe. Shion reluctantly allows KOS-MOS to kill Cecily and Cathe. The Zohar is claimed by Sergius in behalf of Ormus and the Immigrant Fleet. He installs the Zohar into the Proto Omega, a giant machine built within the structure of Miltia, with the intent of destroying the Gnosis and Federation so Ormus will be free to rediscover Lost Jerusalem.|$|E
5|$|Worsening {{economic}} conditions had put further pressure on industrial relations, with unemployment rising and employers seeking to cut costs. Strikes of sugar mill workers in 1927, waterside workers in 1928, and then transport and timber industry workers in 1929 continued to disrupt economic operations. The worst came with ongoing disputes between miners and mine owners on the coalfields of New South Wales had culminated in riots and lockouts in 1929, <b>and</b> <b>intervention</b> by the Bruce government {{failed to produce}} a settlement. Notably, in March 1929 Newcastle-based mine owner John Brown locked out workers from his mines at Pelaw Main and Richmond Main to try to force acceptance of lower wages. Attorney-General John Latham pursued legal action against Brown for illegally using coercive industrial tactics, but Bruce intervened to stop the prosecution, believing the case to be doubtful and that dropping it would give the government a chance to negotiate {{an end to the}} dispute. The mine-owners refused to accede to government-brokered negotiations anyway, and the government was seen to have been siding with rich businesses and applying double standards, undermining Bruce's own credibility as an impartial leader and law-and-order prime minister.|$|E
