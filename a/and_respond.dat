5|$|A chavrusa {{helps the}} student stay awake, keep his mind {{focused on the}} learning, sharpen his {{reasoning}} powers, develop his thoughts into words, and organize his thoughts into logical arguments. This type of learning also imparts precision and clarity into ideas that would otherwise remain vague. Having to listen to, analyze <b>and</b> <b>respond</b> to another's opinion inculcates respect for others. It is considered poor manners to interrupt one's chavrusa. The chavrusa relationship also strengthens the student's personal commitment to his studies, as he is loathe to disappoint or cancel on his chavrusa.|$|E
40|$|In dialogue, {{it is not}} {{uncommon}} for people to laugh together. This joint laughter often results in overlapping laughter, consisting of an initiating laugh (the first one), <b>and</b> a <b>responding</b> laugh (the second one). In previous studies, we found that overlapping laughs are acoustically different from non-overlapping ones. So far, we have considered overlapping laughs as one category. Consequently, it is unknown whether there are also acoustic differences between initiating laughs <b>and</b> <b>responding</b> laughs. In this paper, we make a distinction between initiating, <b>responding,</b> <b>and</b> non-overlapping laughs and compare their acoustic characteristics. In particular, we will investigate the prosodic relations between initiating <b>and</b> <b>responding</b> laughs. Do these relations point to a form of accommodation and mimicry? To what extent are initiating <b>and</b> <b>responding</b> laughs paired to each other? The analyses were performed on two speech corpora containing spontaneous conversations between two speakers. Results show indications that initiating <b>and</b> <b>responding</b> laughs share several similar acoustic features that point towards accommodation and mimicry mechanisms...|$|R

As of 1987, most performers of traditional music were either over 50 {{years old or}} under 35, which indicates an ongoing revival of previously declining traditions.

Their batteries also provided the ability to operate for approximately 15 days longer than the Phase I models (45 days).|$|E

5|$|To {{maintain}} dynamic equilibrium {{and effectively}} carry out certain functions, a system must detect <b>and</b> <b>respond</b> to perturbations.

One example is the release of glucagon when sugar levels are too low.|$|E
5|$|Unusual social {{development}} becomes apparent early in childhood. Autistic infants show {{less attention to}} social stimuli, smile and look at others less often, <b>and</b> <b>respond</b> less to their own name. Autistic toddlers differ more strikingly from social norms; for example, they have less eye contact and turn-taking, {{and do not have}} the ability to use simple movements to express themselves, such as pointing at things. Three- to five-year-old children with autism are less likely to exhibit social understanding, approach others spontaneously, imitate <b>and</b> <b>respond</b> to emotions, communicate nonverbally, and take turns with others. However, they do form attachments to their primary caregivers. Most children with autism display moderately less attachment security than neurotypical children, although this difference disappears in children with higher mental development or less severe ASD. Older children and adults with ASD perform worse on tests of face and emotion recognition although this may be partly due to a lower ability to define a person's own emotions.|$|E

The Malaysian military became aware of the unidentified aircraft only after reviewing radar recordings several hours after the flight's disappearance. The failure to recognise and react to the unidentified aircraft was a security breach, and was also a missed opportunity to intercept Flight 370 and prevent the time-consuming and expensive search operation.|$|E
5|$|Although starfish do {{not have}} many {{well-defined}} sense organs, they are sensitive to touch, light, temperature, orientation {{and the status of}} the water around them. The tube feet, spines and pedicellariae are sensitive to touch. The tube feet, especially those at the tips of the rays, are also sensitive to chemicals, enabling the starfish to detect odour sources such as food. There are eyespots at the ends of the arms, each one made of 80–200 simple ocelli. These are composed of pigmented epithelial cells that respond to light and are covered by a thick, transparent cuticle that both protects the ocelli and acts to focus light. Many starfish also possess individual photoreceptor cells in other parts of their bodies <b>and</b> <b>respond</b> to light even when their eyespots are covered. Whether they advance or retreat depends on the species.|$|E
5|$|Although {{there are}} many diverse pathogens, {{many of which are}} {{constantly}} mutating, it is a surprise that a majority of individuals remain free of infections. Thus, maintenance of health requires the body to recognize all pathogens (antigens they present or produce) likely to exist. This is achieved by maintaining a pool of immensely large (about 109) clones of B cells, each of which reacts against a specific epitope by recognizing and producing antibodies against it. However, at any given time very few clones actually remain receptive to their specific epitope. Thus, approximately 107 different epitopes can be recognized by all the B cell clones combined. Moreover, in a lifetime, an individual usually requires the generation of antibodies against very few antigens in comparison with the number that the body can recognize <b>and</b> <b>respond</b> against.|$|E

5|$|Caregivers use {{language}} {{to help children}} become competent members of society and culture. From birth, infants receive pragmatic information. They learn structure of conversations from early interactions with caregivers. Actions and speech are organized in games, such as peekaboo to provide children with information about words and phrases. Caregivers find many ways to help infants interact <b>and</b> <b>respond.</b> As children advance and participate more actively in interactions, caregivers adapt their interactions accordingly. Caregivers also prompt children to produce correct pragmatic behaviours. They provide input about what children are expected to say, how to speak, when they should speak, {{and how they can}} stay on topic. Caregivers may model the appropriate behaviour, using verbal reinforcement, posing a hypothetical situation, addressing children's comments, or evaluating another person.|$|E
5|$|Caroline's main rival for Mac's {{affections}} is Sue White (Michelle Gomez), the Scottish staff {{liaison officer}} employed to listen <b>and</b> <b>respond</b> {{to the problems}} of East Hampton's staff. However, Sue is perhaps the least suited person for the job; she is mean-spirited, insensitive, unsympathetic, controlling and vain. Her office is a place where the impossible tends to happen, and anyone who enters is normally treated with a mixture of verbal abuse and psychological torture, so she can get back to doing nothing, or thinking about how to upset the next visitor. The only person she treats with any affection is Mac, whom she loves to the point of madness, but Mac, like almost everyone else, tries his best to avoid her. Anyone who attempts to get involved with Mac is treated with contempt and hatred by Sue, in particular Caroline, whom Sue attempts several times to murder.|$|E
5|$|Domestic cats select food {{based on}} its temperature, smell and texture; they dislike chilled foods <b>and</b> <b>respond</b> most {{strongly}} to moist foods rich in amino acids, which are similar to meat. Cats may reject novel flavors (a response termed neophobia) and learn quickly to avoid foods that have tasted unpleasant in the past. They may also avoid sugary foods and milk. Most adult cats are lactose intolerant; the sugars in milk are not easily digested and may cause soft stools or diarrhea. They can also develop odd eating habits. Some cats like to eat or chew on other things, most commonly wool, but also plastic, cables, paper, string, aluminum foil, or even coal. This condition, pica, can threaten their health, depending on the amount and toxicity of the items eaten.|$|E
