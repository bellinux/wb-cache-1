5|$|The Asgardian Loki {{encounters}} the Other, {{the leader}} of an extraterrestrial race known as the Chitauri. In exchange for retrieving the Tesseract, a powerful energy source of unknown potential, the Other promises Loki an army with which he can subjugate Earth. Nick Fury, director of the espionage agency S.H.I.E.L.D., and his lieutenant Agent Maria Hill arrive at a remote research facility during an evacuation, where physicist Dr. Erik Selvig is leading a research team experimenting on the Tesseract. Agent Phil Coulson explains that the object has begun radiating an unusual form of energy. The Tesseract suddenly activates and opens a wormhole, allowing Loki to reach Earth. Loki takes the Tesseract and uses his scepter to enslave Selvig <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>other</b> agents, including Clint Barton, to aid him in his getaway.|$|E
5|$|Finally, at the 30 Rock studios, after overhearing Pete Hornberger (Scott Adsit) impersonating Elmo from Sesame Street while Pete was {{encouraging}} {{his son to}} do better with his potty training, Tracy Jordan (Tracy Morgan) compares Pete's relationship with his wife to that of Samson and Delilah. While working late at night in his office, Tracy enters with Grizz (Grizz Chapman) and Dot Com (Kevin Brown) <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>other</b> people, which turns into a party. Pete is still working, while Tracy's entourage enjoy themselves. Tracy encourages Pete to loosen up, and asks one of the women, Vicki (April Lee Hernández), to look after him. Pete finally loosens up and begins {{to give in to}} Vicki's temptations, but NBC page Kenneth Parcell (Jack McBrayer) sets him straight, telling him to recall the day that he got married.|$|E

500|$|Jourdan {{considered}} his position {{superior to the}} Austrian's, protected as he was by the marshy plain between his positions and the Austrian front, {{and he thought he}} had another three days to consolidate his positions. His forces occupied Hoßkirch, <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>other</b> points he considered strategic: the causeway (post road) that passed Saulgau (today Bad Saulgau), the village of Altshausen [...] east, and the hamlet of Friedberg, [...] to the north-north-east of Ostrach. These positions created a perimeter around Ostrach. He was unaware that the Archduke had arrived by forced marches from Augsburg to the vicinity of Ostrach; Jourdan thought the main force of Charles' army was still at least three days' march away. [...] By the middle of Holy Week in 1799, {{more than a third of}} Charles' army, 48,000mixed troops, was positioned in a formation parallel to Jourdan's, and his 72,000remaining troops were arrayed with the left wing at Kempten, the center near Memmingen, and the right flank extended to Ulm.|$|E
500|$|While {{reviewing}} the seventeenth season of The Simpsons, Jesse Hassenger of PopMatters {{noted that he}} thought the show had declined in quality compared to its earlier years, and added that the stronger episodes in the later seasons are that ones that [...] "satirize topical issues", giving [...] "The Monkey Suit" [...] as an example. Similarly, Fort Worth Star-Telegram staff writer Robert Philpot commented that [...] "Even in its weak seasons, this show has always been good {{for at least one}} belly laugh per episode. Not this year [...] Aside from an installment that took on the evolution -vs.-creationism edge <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>other</b> bits, the satirical edge has really dulled, making the announcement that it will have at least two more seasons a cause for concern rather than celebration." [...] In the July 26, 2007 issue of Nature, the scientific journal's editorial staff listed among [...] "The Top Ten science moments in The Simpsons" [...] the scene from the episode in which [...] "Flanders is flabbergasted that the science museum's exhibit on the origins of man both highlights evolution and makes light of creationism — and, to top it all, has a unisex bathroom." ...|$|E
500|$|Madonna {{had already}} started work on the album with Williams, and during one of her breaks from recording, her manager Guy Oseary spoke to Timberlake, {{suggesting}} that it [...] "would be cool" [...] if he recorded some songs with her. Timberlake commented [...] "'That would be awesome,' but I thought, 'That'll never happen', [...] But it's a testament to Pharrell. He had already laid the groundwork {{where she was going}} with it. She played 'Candy Shop' for me, <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>other</b> songs, and I thought, 'What a cool direction.' I thought she could essentially do the whole record with Pharrell if she wanted to, and I asked Tim, 'How do we fit in?' And it basically came down to how we did my record, co-producing, and just throwing Madonna in the mix." [...] The first track recorded by Madonna and Timberlake was [...] "Devil Wouldn't Recognize You". Timberlake felt that the song, which Madonna had been working on for years before the Hard Candy project, was comparable to [...] "Frozen" [...] (1998). He wanted to turn the line [...] "'The devil wouldn't recognize you, but I do" [...] into a catchy hook and make it sound like a concept.|$|E

500|$|McCain was {{promoted}} to commander effective July 1973 and attended the National War College in Fort McNair in Washington, D.C. during the 1973–1974 academic year. There he intensively studied the history of Vietnam and the French and American wars there, and wrote [...] "The Code of Conduct and the Vietnam Prisoners of War", a long paper on the Vietnam POW experience {{as a test of}} the U.S. Code of Conduct. By the time he graduated, he concluded that mistakes by American political and military leaders had doomed the war effort. He accepted the right of the anti-war movement in the U.S. to have exercised their freedom to protest, and he adopted a live-and-let-live attitude towards those who had evaded the draft. Nor did the vast changes in American social mores that had taken place during his absence bother him, as it did many other former POWs. McCain returned to Saigon in November 1974; he <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>other</b> former POWs received the National Order of Vietnam, that country's highest honor. He also spoke at the South Vietnamese war college, five months before Saigon fell. McCain resolved not to become a [...] "professional POW" [...] but to move forward and rebuild his life. Few thought McCain could fly again, but he was determined to try, and during this time he engaged in nine months of grueling, painful physical therapy, especially to get his knees to bend again.|$|E

2500|$|Breton-speaking {{people may}} {{pronounce}} the word Breizh {{in two different}} ways, according to their region of origin. Breton {{can be divided into}} two main dialects: the KLT (Kerne-Leon-Tregor) and the dialect of Vannes. KLT speakers pronounce it [...] and would write it Breiz, while the Vannetais speakers pronounce it [...] and would write it Breih. The official spelling is a compromise between both variants, with a z and an h together. In 1941, efforts to unify the dialects {{led to the creation of}} the so-called Breton zh, a standard which has never been widely accepted. On its side, Gallo language has never had a widely accepted writing system and several ones coexist. For instance, the name of the region in that language can be written Bertaèyn in ELG script, or Bertègn in MOGA, <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>other</b> scripts also exist.|$|E
2500|$|At {{the end of}} March 1924, aged 17, Gavin {{spoke to}} a U.S. Army {{recruiting}} officer. Since he was under 18, he needed parental consent to enlist. Knowing that his adoptive parents would not consent, Gavin told the recruiter he was an orphan. The recruiting officer took him <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>other</b> underage boys, who were orphans, to a lawyer who declared himself their guardian and signed the parental consent paperwork. On April 1, 1924, Gavin was sworn into the U.S. Army, and was stationed in Panama. His basic training {{was performed on the}} job in his unit, the U.S. Coast Artillery at Fort Sherman. He served as a crewmember of a 155mm gun, under the command of Sergeant McCarthy, who described him as fine. Another person he looked up to was his first sergeant, an American Indian named [...] "Chief" [...] Williams.|$|E
2500|$|Philip Lombard, {{a soldier}} of fortune. Literally {{down to his}} last square meal, {{he comes to the}} island with a loaded revolver, as {{suggested}} by his invitation letter. Lombard is accused of causing the deaths of a number of East African tribesmen, after stealing their food and abandoning them to their deaths. He, along with Marston, are the only guests to openly and immediately confirm that the accusations against them are true; neither feels any remorse. ("Story's quite true! I left 'em! Matter of self-preservation. We were lost in the bush. I <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>other</b> fellows took what food there was and cleared out ... Not quite the act of a pukka sahib, I'm afraid. But self-preservation's a man's first duty. And natives don't mind dying, you know. They don't feel about it as Europeans do.") Lombard fulfilled the ninth referenced verse of the rhyme, shot to death on the beach by Vera, ("One got frizzled up ...") who believed him to be the murderer. Of all the [...] "guests" [...] he is the only one to theorize that [...] "U.N. Owen" [...] might be Wargrave, but the others reject this and it does him no good. He, along with Vera, is the only guest not killed by Justice Wargrave. Technically he is the 8th person to die out of the ten guests.|$|E

Goku appears in Robot Chicken in a sketch entitled A Very Dragon Ball Z Christmas, where Goku and Gohan fight an evil Mrs. Claus with Santa's reindeer, in an attempt to save Christmas. The Saturday Night Live sketch TV Funhouse titled Kobayashi depicts real-life hot-dog-eating champion Takeru Kobayashi as able to transform into a Super Saiyan as he prepares to eat hot dogs; Goku appears briefly near the end. Goku is referenced in the songs [...] "Goku" [...] and [...] "Anime" [...] by Soulja Boy Tell 'Em, where he brags that he looks and feels like Goku.

It was one Sunday afternoon, and {{it must have been}} about May, for the trees and shrubs of Ridout College were gay with blossom, and fresh with the new sharp greens of spring. I had walked talking with Isabel <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>other</b> girls through the wide gardens of the place, seen and criticised the new brick pond, nodded to the daughter of this friend and that in the hammocks under the trees, and picked a way among the scattered tea-parties on the lawn to our own circle on the grass under a Siberian crab near the great bay window. There I sat and ate great quantities of cake, and discussed the tactics of the Suffragettes. I had made some comments upon the spirit of the movement in an address to the men in Pembroke, and it had got abroad, and a group of girls and women dons were now having it out with me.|$|E
