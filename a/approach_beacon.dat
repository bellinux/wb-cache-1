Recent analysis on beaconing indicates that the standards for beaconing restrict the desired performance of vehicular applications. This situation {{can be attributed to}} the quality of the available transmission medium, persistent change in the traffic situation and the inability of standards to cope with application requirements. To this end, this paper is motivated by the classifications and capability evaluations of existing adaptive <b>beaconing</b> <b>approaches.</b> To begin with, we explore the anatomy and the performance requirements of beaconing. Then, the beaconing design is analyzed to introduce a design-based beaconing taxonomy. A survey of the state-of-the-art is conducted with an emphasis on the salient features of the <b>beaconing</b> <b>approaches.</b> We also evaluate the capabilities of <b>beaconing</b> <b>approaches</b> using several key parameters.

40|$|International audienceTo {{study the}} {{relationship}} between brain representations and behaviour, we recorded hippocampal neuronal activity in rats repeatedly alternating between two different tasks on a circular platform with four reward boxes along the edge. In the <b>beacon</b> <b>approach</b> task, rewards were provided only at the pair of diametrically opposite boxes that was illuminated. In the place navigation task, rewards were available only at the boxes positioned near the north-east and south-west corners of the room. Performance levels were high and rats rapidly reoriented to changes in lamp cues in the <b>beacon</b> <b>approach</b> task. Neuropsychological studies show that rats with hippocampal lesions readily employ <b>beacon</b> <b>approach</b> strategies, while place navigation is severely impaired. Previous studies suggested that the neurons might change their behavioural correlates as the rat performed the respective tasks. However, of 34 hippocampal ‘place cells’ recorded, all showed position selectivity fixed with respect to room cues, even in the <b>beacon</b> <b>approach</b> task where coding {{the position of the}} rat in the room was of no use for locating rewards. Whether or not hippocampal signals are actually employed for ongoing behaviour would then be decided by structures downstream from the hippocampus. If this is the case, then the ‘counterproductive’ room referred place-related discharges in the <b>beacon</b> <b>approach</b> task would be a background representation. This would provide support for proposals of multiple memory systems underlying different types of information processing and contrasts with the popular notion that local neuronal activity levels are selectively increased to the degree that the brain region is required for the ongoing function...|$|R

In October 1941, after six months of intensive night flight training, Burbridge was declared ready for front-line operations. Burbridge was posted to No. 85 Squadron RAF at RAF Hunsdon in October 1941. It was a satellite airfield for RAF North Weald in Essex. The squadron's commander was Peter Townsend, an experienced combat leader. 85 Squadron was already a battle-hardened formation and had been in action during World War I and the Battle of Britain in 1940.|$|E
30|$|Geo-routing {{protocols}} usually {{operate in}} one of two modes: greedy forwarding [1] or face routing [7]. Under the former, a node chooses as forwarder, the neighbour with the shortest distance to the sink as long as such neighbour can be identified. However, in the case that a local minimum is reached, that is to say, if no neighbour is closer to the sink than the current node, the routing protocol should change its operating mode. This situation arises {{in the presence of a}} hole in the network, i.e. a large area not covered by nodes. In this case, a face routing mechanism must be initiated whose main task is to forward the packet along the boundary of the hole. However, it requires the network subgraph be planar, since intersecting links may cause a routing loop. In the presence of intersecting links, some planarization process must be done prior to forwarding the data. Such process consists on disabling some links in order to avoid routing loops. The planarization process can be performed following one of two <b>approaches,</b> <b>beacon</b> and beaconless planarization. The former requires that the current node gets to know the overall neighbourhood topology by exchanging beacon packets with its neighbours. Since this may be an intensive signalling procedure in terms of energy consumption and communication overhead, the latter approach avoids exchanging full knowledge and tries to construct a local planar subgraph by exchanging a limited number of control messages during the routing process.|$|R

The general positioning methods for robotic navigation include vision-based <b>approaches,</b> WIFI <b>beacons,</b> infrared beacons, ultrasonic beacons, etc. However, the common problem with these methods is their inaccuracy.

While two infrared beams from an external beacon source are equally projected to both sides of the PSD, the robot‟s position can be calculated precisely. The high performance and accurate results can be achieved by optimizing the rotation aligning time, dividing the working area, and compensating errors with information fusion. In comparison with other generic approaches, this proposed innovative approach requires less computing resources and is easier to implement due to its much lower complexity for the computing algorithms...|$|R

While TV bands are well matched to the adoption of geolocation databases, a database-assisted spectrum sensing mechanism may represent the most efficient solution to exploit the spectrum holes in radar bands.

40|$|The {{ability of}} robots to {{estimate}} their location {{is crucial for}} a wide variety of autonomous operations. In settings where GPS is unavailable, measurements of transmissions from fixed beacons provide an effective means of estimating a robot's location as it navigates. The accuracy of such a beacon-based localization system depends both on how beacons are distributed in the environment, and how the robot's location is inferred based on noisy and potentially ambiguous measurements. We propose an approach for making these design decisions automatically and without expert supervision, by explicitly searching for the placement and inference strategies that, together, are optimal for a given environment. Since this search is computationally expensive, our <b>approach</b> encodes <b>beacon</b> placement as a differential neural layer that interfaces with a neural network for inference.

This triangulates the position of the beacon. A faster change in the doppler indicates that the beacon is closer to the satellite's orbit.
