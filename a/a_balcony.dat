5|$|Nevertheless, in October 2014, Lois Leveen speculated in The Atlantic {{that the}} {{original}} Shakespeare play did not contain <b>a</b> <b>balcony.</b> The word, balcone, {{did not exist in}} the English language until two years after Shakespeare's death. The balcony was certainly used in Thomas Otway's 1679 play, The History and Fall of Caius Marius, which had borrowed much of its story from Romeo and Juliet and placed the two lovers in <b>a</b> <b>balcony</b> reciting a speech similar to that between Romeo and Juliet. Leveen suggested that during the 18th century, David Garrick chose to use <b>a</b> <b>balcony</b> in his adaptation and revival of Romeo and Juliet and modern adaptations have continued this tradition.|$|E
5|$|During the 60 {{years of}} {{occupancy}} by the Israeli army, the base was served by an army synagogue {{in one of}} the halls of the main building, including a Torah ark, bookcase, and <b>a</b> <b>balcony</b> door set with 12 stained-glass windows depicting the Twelve Tribes of Israel.|$|E
5|$|The double finial minaret {{was built}} in 1509 by Qansah al-Ghuri. Sitting on a square base, the first shaft is octagonal, and four sides have a {{decorative}} keel arch, separated from the adjacent sides with two columns. The second shaft, is a 12 - sided polygon separated from the first by a fretted balconies supported by muqarnas is decorated with blue faience. <b>A</b> <b>balcony</b> separates the third level from the second shaft. The third level {{is made up of}} two rectangular shafts with horseshoe arches on each side of both shafts. Atop each of these two shafts rests a finial atop two identical onion shaped bulbs, with <b>a</b> <b>balcony</b> separating the finials from the shafts.|$|E
50|$|A {{unit with}} <b>a</b> regular <b>balcony</b> will have doors that open up onto a small patio with railings, a small Patio garden or Skyrise greenery. <b>A</b> French <b>balcony</b> is {{actually}} <b>a</b> false <b>balcony,</b> with doors that {{open to a}} railing {{with a view of}} the courtyard or the surrounding scenery below.|$|R
25|$|A new {{multi-storey}} brick theatre {{was erected}} around 1810 {{on what was}} at the time the north side of H Street (now Broad). There was an orchestra section, <b>a</b> first <b>balcony,</b> and <b>an</b> upper <b>balcony,</b> with narrow doorways.|$|R

5|$|According to O'Brien, only he, Woodfull, the masseur (who was deaf), Alan Kippax, {{and former}} Australian Test players Jack Ryder and Ernie Jones were present when the {{incident}} took place, {{but most of}} the Australian team were watching the match from <b>a</b> <b>balcony</b> adjoining the dressing room from where they {{would have been able to}} hear the confrontation. O'Brien claimed that he went outside and told the group what had happened; around twenty people were present.|$|E
5|$|All the {{buildings}} are interconnected through steps and stairways made in rocks. There are a few rickety wooden bridges along the paths and stairways also to cross over. The temple {{at the highest level}} has a frieze of Buddha. Each building has <b>a</b> <b>balcony,</b> which provides lovely views of the scenic Paro valley down below. The Monasteries have ancient history of occupation by monks, as hermitages.|$|E
5|$|Arriving in Berlin on June 12, 1987, President and Mrs. Reagan {{were taken}} to the Reichstag, where they viewed the wall from <b>a</b> <b>balcony.</b> Reagan then made his speech at the Brandenburg Gate at 2:00pm, in front of two panes of {{bulletproof}} glass.

Arriving at another boxing match and watching it from <b>a</b> <b>balcony,</b> 50 Cent recognizes a member of the crowd as one of the men he saw outside the warehouse: he then leaves the warehouse, with the video concluding with the fight ending and 50 Cent facing the camera on the street outside the warehouse.|$|E
5|$|The ground has {{undergone}} several major changes since its original construction in 1905. The original Main Stand, boasting a press loft and <b>a</b> <b>balcony</b> above the roof, burnt down in 1921, {{and was replaced}} by the current stand before the 1922–23 campaign. The new Main Stand was split into two: the upper tier contained wooden seats, so there was a ban on smoking in the stand; the lower tier, which became known as the Enclosure, was terracing.|$|E
5|$|The long, rectilinear, two-storey building, had {{a double}} {{cantilevered}} frame supported {{on a single}} row of concrete columns. These columns tilted outwards from a vertical position. Floor to ceiling glazing on the second storey opened out onto <b>a</b> <b>balcony</b> running {{the length of the}} building. It included technical innovations from America including acoustic ceiling tiles, underfloor electricity ducts and fluorescent lighting.|$|E

40|$|Balconies, {{as one of}} {{the main}} {{architectural}} features in subtropical climates, are assumed to enhance the ventilation performance of buildings by redirecting the wind. Although there are some studies on the effect of balconies on natural ventilation inside buildings, the majority have been conducted on single zone buildings with simple geometries. The {{purpose of this study is}} to explore the effect of balconies on the internal air flow pattern and ventilation performance of multi-storey residential buildings with internal partitions. To this end, a sample residential unit was selected for investigation and three different conditions tested, base case (no <b>balcony),</b> <b>an</b> open <b>balcony</b> and <b>a</b> semi-enclosed <b>balcony.</b> Computational Fluid Dynamics is used as an analysis method due to its accuracy and ability to provide detailed results. The cases are analysed in terms of average velocity, flow uniformity and number of Air Changes per Hour (ACH). The results suggest the introduction of <b>a</b> semi-enclosed <b>balcony</b> into high-rise dwellings improves the average velocity and flow uniformity. Integrating <b>an</b> open <b>balcony</b> results in reduction of the aforementioned parameters at 0 ° wind incidence...|$|R
5|$|Around 1848—the exact date of his {{marriage}} is not recorded—Rainilaiarivony, then around 20 or 21 years old and having adopted the name Radilifera, concluded a marriage with his paternal cousin Rasoanalina. She bore him sixteen children {{over the course of}} their marriage. In addition, a one-year-old son that Rasoanalina had conceived with another man prior to the union, Ratsimatahodriaka (Radriaka), was adopted by Rainilaiarivony as his own. As a young man, Ratsimatahodriaka was groomed by Rainilaiarivony to become his successor, but the youth fell from <b>a</b> <b>balcony</b> while intoxicated and died in his early twenties.|$|E
5|$|Cortina {{is home to}} some of {{the most}} prestigious names in fashion, {{including}} Bulgari, Benetton, Gucci and Geox, and various artisan shops, antiquarians, and craft stores. It is also home to many stores specializing in mountaineering equipment. The symbol of Cortina shopping remains La Cooperativa di Cortina, founded on June 28, 1893 as Consumverein Ampezzo. In this shopping centre many trades can be found, from confectioners to newspaper vendors, toys, gift shops, skiing stores and blacksmiths. The building is divided into three levels (more a raised plan and <b>a</b> <b>balcony).</b> The cooperative in Cortina was one of the first cooperatives founded in the Italian Peninsula, and currently provides employment to approximately 200 people.|$|E
5|$|David {{follows the}} janitor to the victims' house, frees the {{children}} and finds their mother raped and killed, but the janitor ambushes him and pushes him off <b>a</b> <b>balcony</b> into a swimming pool. David nearly drowns (since he cannot swim), but the children rescue him. He then attacks the janitor from behind and strangles him to death while once more remaining uninjured. That night, he and Audrey reconcile. The following morning, he secretly shows a newspaper article on the anonymous heroic act, featuring a sketch of David in his hooded rain poncho, to his son, who recognizes the hero as his father.|$|E

5|$|Merlin {{reports to}} Camelot's {{physician}} Gaius (Richard Wilson) and saves the old man's {{life when he}} falls from <b>a</b> <b>balcony</b> by magically moving a mattress to cushion his fall. Though initially denying his abilities, Merlin later admits {{that he has had}} magical powers since birth, which Gaius warns him to keep secret. Reading a letter from Merlin's mother, Gaius realises that the boy was sent to Camelot for protection. Meanwhile, in the forest outside Camelot, Mary kills Lady Helen (Myles), a singer who is to perform at Uther's court, with a poppet. Mary assumes Helen's appearance using an enchantment, though her true hideous appearance can still be seen in her reflection (like in mirrors or water).|$|E
5|$|Michael kidnaps Laurie {{and takes}} {{her back to}} their old home. He tries to show Laurie that she is his sister, {{presenting}} a picture of them with their mother. Unable to understand, Laurie stabs Michael with his own knife before escaping the house; Michael chases her, but Loomis arrives and shoots him. Recovering, Michael recaptures Laurie before she can leave and heads back to the house. Loomis again intervenes, but Michael subdues him. Laurie takes Loomis' gun and runs upstairs, but Michael corners her on <b>a</b> <b>balcony</b> and charges her head-on, knocking both of them over the railing.

5|$|Network Rail has {{constructed}} <b>a</b> <b>balcony</b> along {{almost the}} whole {{width of the}} concourse at the first-floor level. The project's aims were to provide 18 new retail spaces and a champagne bar, reduce congestion on the concourse, and improve access to Waterloo East station by providing additional escalators leading to the high-level walkway between Waterloo and Waterloo East. Retail and catering outlets {{have been removed from}} the concourse to make more circulation space. First-floor offices have been converted into replacement and additional retail and catering spaces. Work was completed in July 2012, at a cost of £25million.|$|E

Nhu's men vandalized the main altar and confiscated the intact charred heart of Thích Quảng Đức, which had failed to burn during his re-cremation. However, some of the Buddhists were able to flee the pagoda with a receptacle containing his ashes. Two monks jumped {{the back wall of}} Xá Lợi to enter the grounds of the adjoining United States Agency for International Development (USAID) mission, where they were given asylum, despite the presence of troops behind the pagoda walls who opened fire with automatic weapons on any monks who tried to flee by jumping the fence.|$|E
