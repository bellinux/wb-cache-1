25|$|Standing {{in a large}} atrium, Roberts {{first opened}} fire at the mall's food court that was across from him at his left.

500|$|During the Christmas {{season of}} 1938, an alien {{spacecraft}} approaches Earth ready {{to destroy it}} when it suddenly explodes courtesy of the Doctor who escapes the ship and then falls to Earth by rapidly donning an impact space suit, though in his haste, the helmet is put on backwards. On crashing to Earth, he is found by Madge Arwell (Claire Skinner), wife of Reg (Alexander Amstrong) <b>and</b> <b>mother</b> <b>of</b> <b>two</b> children, Lily (Holly Earl) and Cyril (Maurice Cole). She helps the Doctor to his TARDIS, and the Doctor promises to repay her for her kindness. Three years later, during World War II, Reg is reported missing in action when the Lancaster bomber he was piloting disappeared over the English Channel. Madge is told this via telegram just before Christmas, but decides not to tell her children yet, hoping to keep their spirits up through the holiday. Madge and the children evacuate London to a relative's house in Dorset, where they are greeted by the Doctor, calling himself [...] "the Caretaker"; Madge does not recognise him from their previous encounter, as his face had been hidden by the backwards helmet.|$|E

500|$|Cherry {{offered the}} role of Bree Van de Kamp, a [...] "perfect homemaker" [...] {{reminiscent}} of The Stepford Wives, to Dana Delany three times. Delany rejected the role, as it was too similar to her character on Pasadena, but would later join the series in its fourth season as Katherine Mayfair. Marcia Cross was later cast as Bree. Roma Downey, Jeri Ryan, and Stacey Travis were also considered for the role, while Nicollette Sheridan auditioned for the part and was cast as neighborhood tramp Edie Britt instead. On her audition, Sheridan recalled, [...] "At {{the end of the}} reading, the director looked at me and said, 'No, no, I see you as Edie.' I said, 'Oh, I see, I come in a housewife <b>and</b> <b>mother</b> <b>of</b> <b>two</b> and leave the slut.'" [...] The Edie character was originally intended to be a small role, but it was expanded once Sheridan was cast. Felicity Huffman was cast as Lynette Scavo, a frustrated stay-at-home mother of four, after talking about her own experiences as a mother during her audition. Cherry called Huffman's casting [...] "very lucky," [...] commenting that [...] "within fifteen minutes she had the part." [...] Alex Kingston read for {{the role of}} Lynette, and has since alleged that she was denied the role for being too heavy. The role of series narrator Mary Alice Young was given to Sheryl Lee. Cross originally auditioned for the role before being cast as Bree instead. Jeanne Tripplehorn and Heather Locklear also auditioned for leading roles.|$|E
