5|$|David Winkler and Frederick Sheldon {{believe that}} {{evolutionary}} {{development in the}} mud-building swallows, and individual species follow this order of construction. A retort builder like red-rumped swallow starts with an open cup, closes it, and then builds the entrance tunnel.

Since mating occurs inside the nest, the difficulty of access means other males <b>are</b> <b>excluded.</b> This reduction in competition permits the dense breeding colonies typical of the Delichon martins.|$|E
