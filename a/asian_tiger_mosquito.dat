25|$|The <b>Asian</b> <b>tiger</b> <b>mosquito</b> was {{responsible}} for the Chikungunya epidemic on the French Island La Réunion in 2005–2006. By September 2006, an estimated 266,000 people were infected with the virus, and 248 fatalities occurred on the island. The <b>Asian</b> <b>tiger</b> <b>mosquito</b> was also the transmitter of the virus in the first and only outbreak of Chikungunya fever on the European continent. This outbreak occurred in the Italian province of Ravenna in the summer of 2007, and infected over 200 people. Evidently, mutated strains of the Chikungunya virus are being directly transmitted through Ae. albopictus particularly well and {{in such a way that}} another dispersal of the disease in regions with the <b>Asian</b> <b>tiger</b> <b>mosquito</b> is feared.|$|E
25|$|In Europe, the <b>Asian</b> <b>tiger</b> <b>mosquito</b> {{apparently}} covers {{an extensive}} new niche. This means that no native, long-established species {{conflict with the}} dispersal of Ae. albopictus.|$|E
25|$|Primarily, other {{mosquito}} larvae, flatworms, swimming beetles, fungi, ciliates, paramecia, protozoans which act as parasites, predatory copepods, and spiders {{are natural}} {{enemies of the}} larval stage of <b>Asian</b> <b>tiger</b> <b>mosquitoes.</b>|$|R
25|$|Though {{they do not}} {{commonly}} {{occur in}} the natural habitats of <b>Asian</b> <b>tiger</b> <b>mosquitoes,</b> predatory copepods from the Cyclopidae family seem to willingly feed on them given the opportunity. Relatives of different genera could therefore present a possibility in the control of <b>tiger</b> <b>mosquitoes.</b>|$|R
40|$|La Crosse {{encephalitis}} is a {{viral disease}} {{that has emerged}} in new locations across the Appalachian region of the United States. Conventional wisdom suggests that ongoing emergence of La Crosse virus (LACV) could stem from the invasive <b>Asian</b> <b>tiger</b> (Aedes albopictus) <b>mosquito.</b> Efforts to prove this, however, are complicated by the numerous transmission routes and species interactions involved in LACV dynamics. To analyze LACV transmission by <b>Asian</b> <b>tiger</b> <b>mosquitoes,</b> we constructed epidemiologic models. These models accurately predict empirical infection rates. They do not, however, support the hypothesis that <b>Asian</b> <b>tiger</b> <b>mosquitoes</b> are responsible for the recent emergence of LACV at new foci. Consequently, we conclude that other factors, including different invasive mosquitoes, changes in climate variables, or changes in wildlife densities, should be considered as alternative explanations for recent increases in La Crosse encephalitis. 27767009 PMC 508802...|$|R
25|$|Fungi {{from the}} genus Coelomomyces (order Blastocladiales) develop inside the visceral cavity of {{mosquito}} larvae. The species Coelomomyces stegomyiae was first {{found on the}} <b>Asian</b> <b>tiger</b> <b>mosquito.</b>|$|E
25|$|Ae. albopictus can outcompete {{and even}} {{eradicate}} other species with similar breeding habitats {{from the very}} start of its dispersal to other regions and biotopes. In Kolkata, for example, it was observed in the 1960s that egg depositing containers were being settled by the <b>Asian</b> <b>tiger</b> <b>mosquito</b> in city districts where the malaria mosquito (genus Anopheles) and yellow fever mosquito (Aedes aegypti) had both been eliminated by the application of DDT. This may be because primarily the inner walls of the houses were treated with DDT to kill the mosquitoes resting there and fight the malaria mosquito. The yellow fever mosquito also lingers particularly in the inside of buildings and would have been also affected. The <b>Asian</b> <b>tiger</b> <b>mosquito</b> rests in the vicinity of human dwellings would therefore have an advantage over the other two species. In other cases, where the yellow fever mosquito was repressed by the <b>Asian</b> <b>tiger</b> <b>mosquito,</b> for instance in Florida, this explanation does not fit. Other hypotheses include competition in the larval breeding waters, differences in metabolism and reproductive biology, or a major susceptibility to sporozoans (Apicomplexa).|$|E
25|$|The <b>Asian</b> <b>tiger</b> <b>mosquito</b> {{originally}} {{came from}} Southeast Asia. In 1966, parts of Asia {{and the island}} worlds of India and the Pacific Ocean were denoted as the area of circulation for the <b>Asian</b> <b>tiger</b> <b>mosquito.</b> Ae. albopictus as a native to tropical and subtropical regions with warm and humid climate, is active all year long; however, it has been adapting successfully to cooler, temperate regions, where they hibernate over winter. Eggs from strains in the temperate zones are more tolerant to the cold than ones from warmer regions. The species can even tolerate snow and temperatures under freezing. Adult tiger mosquitoes can survive throughout winter in suitable microhabitats.|$|E
25|$|Predators {{of adult}} Ae. albopictus in Malaysia include various spider species. Up to 90% of the {{gathered}} spiders from rubber plantations and a cemetery fed upon <b>Asian</b> <b>tiger</b> <b>mosquitoes.</b> Whether the spiders {{would have an}} effect on the mosquito population is still unclear. <b>Tiger</b> <b>mosquitoes</b> were abundantly present despite the existence of the spiders.|$|R
25|$|The {{control of}} <b>Asian</b> <b>tiger</b> <b>mosquitoes</b> begins with {{destroying}} {{the places where}} they lay their eggs, which are never far from where people are being bitten, since they are weak fliers, with only about a 180-m (650-ft) lifetime flying radius. Puddles that last more than three days, sagging or plugged roof gutters, old tires holding water, litter, and any other possible containers or pools of standing water should be drained or removed. Bird baths, inlets to sewers and drainage systems holding stagnant water, flower pots, standing flower vases, knotholes, and other crevices that can collect water should be filled with sand or fine gravel to prevent mosquitoes from laying their eggs in them.|$|R
25|$|Sporozoans of {{the genus}} Ascogregarina (Lecudinidae) infect the larval stage of {{mosquitoes}}. The species Ascogregarina taiwanensis was found in <b>Asian</b> <b>tiger</b> <b>mosquitoes.</b> When the adult mosquitoes emerge from their pupal case, they leave the infectious intermediary stage of parasites {{in the water and}} close off the infection cycle. Infected adults are generally smaller than non-infected adults and have an insignificantly higher mortality rate; therefore, food supply and larval density apparently play a role. In competitive situations, an infection with sporozoans can also reduce the biological fitness of other uninfected mosquitoes. However, the use of the parasites as an effective biological remedy to control mosquito populations is implausible because the host must reach the adult stage for the transmission of the parasites.|$|R
25|$|The other {{characteristics}} do not differentiate between sexes. A single silvery-white line of tight scales begins {{between the eyes}} and continues down the dorsal side of the thorax. This characteristic marking is the easiest and surest way to identify the <b>Asian</b> <b>tiger</b> <b>mosquito.</b>|$|E
25|$|Most {{mosquito}} {{species are}} crepuscular (dawn or dusk) feeders. During {{the heat of}} the day, most mosquitoes rest in a cool place and wait for the evenings, although they may still bite if disturbed. Some species, such as the <b>Asian</b> <b>tiger</b> <b>mosquito,</b> are known to fly and feed during daytime.|$|E
25|$|The <b>Asian</b> <b>tiger</b> <b>mosquito</b> is similar, {{in terms}} of its close {{socialization}} with humans, to the common house mosquito (Culex pipiens). Among other differences in their biology, Culex pipiens prefers larger breeding waters and is more tolerant to cold. In this respect, no significant competition or suppression between the two species likely occurs.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Since {{the early}} 2000 s, the {{accidental}} {{introduction of the}} <b>tiger</b> <b>mosquito</b> has exposed Europe to new diseases previously observed in Southern countries, leading to the onset of new nuisances and health risks. In France, the area first affected was the French Riviera. Based {{on the results of}} a qualitative and quantitative survey, this article analyses the reactions and concerns amongst the local population regarding the spread of <b>Asian</b> <b>tiger</b> <b>mosquitoes</b> and the related health risks. While residents are well aware of the mosquitoes’ presence and perceive a related increase in nuisances at different levels, they tend to play down the related health risks, notably due to the high degree of trust placed in the French healthcare system. It is the wealthiest inhabitants that are most affected by the problem, which primarily affects villa districts. Finally, cultural resistance has hindered the success of awareness-raising campaigns due to the stigma associated with mosquitoes...|$|R
25|$|To date, few {{effective}} traps {{for adult}} <b>Asian</b> <b>tiger</b> <b>mosquitoes</b> are available. Those traps that catch {{other species of}} mosquitoes do not catch <b>tiger</b> <b>mosquitoes</b> efficiently. A form of an ovitrap called a lethal ovitrap mimics the breeding site for Ae. albopictus just like the monitoring tool, but it has {{the added benefit of}} contained chemicals that are toxic to the mosquitoes when they enter, but do not harm humans. These traps have had success in some countries to control Aedes mosquito populations. A new trap type has now been shown to catch significant numbers of Ae. albopictus. This device, {{with the help of a}} ventilator, produces an upward air current of ammonia, fatty acids, and lactic acids that takes a similar form and smell of a human body. With the addition of carbon dioxide, the efficacy of the trap is increased. This means a suitable tool is available for trapping adult <b>tiger</b> <b>mosquitoes,</b> and for example, examining the existence of viruses in the trapped mosquitoes. Previously, the mosquitoes had to be collected from volunteers to be studied, which is ethically questionable, especially during epidemics. Recent research also indicates this trap type may also have a use as a control tool; in a study in Cesena, Italy, the number of biting <b>tiger</b> <b>mosquitoes</b> was reduced in places where traps were installed.|$|R
25|$|In Europe, <b>Asian</b> <b>tiger</b> <b>mosquitos</b> first {{emerged in}} Albania in 1979, {{introduced}} through {{a shipment of}} goods from China. In 1990–1991, they were most likely brought to Italy in used tires from Georgia (USA), and since then have spread throughout the entire mainland of Italy, as well as parts of Sicily and Sardinia. Since 1999, they have established themselves on the mainland of France, primarily southern France. In 2002, they were also discovered in a vacation town {{on the island of}} Corsica, but did not completely establish themselves there until 2005. In Belgium, they were detected in 2000 and 2013, in 2001 in Montenegro, 2003 in Canton Ticino in southern Switzerland, and Greece, 2004 in Spain and Croatia, 2005 in the Netherlands and Slovenia, and 2006 in Bosnia and Herzegovina. In the fall of 2007, the first <b>tiger</b> <b>mosquito</b> eggs were discovered in Rastatt (Baden-Wuerttemberg, Germany). Shortly before, they were found in the northern Alps of Switzerland in Canton Aargau. since 2010, it has also been sighted increasingly in Malta during summer. In September 2016, Public Health England found eggs, though no mosquitos, in a lorry park at Folkestone service station on the M20, near Westenhanger, which is 6 miles West of the Eurotunnel.|$|R
25|$|Aedes albopictus (Stegomyia albopicta), {{from the}} {{mosquito}} (Culicidae) family, {{also known as}} (<b>Asian)</b> <b>tiger</b> <b>mosquito</b> or forest mosquito, is a mosquito native to the tropical and subtropical areas of Southeast Asia; however, {{in the past few}} decades, this species has spread to many countries through the transport of goods and international travel. It is characterized by its black-and-white-striped legs, and small black-and-white-striped body.|$|E
25|$|The typical Ae. albopictus {{individual}} has a length around 2 to 10mm. As {{with other members}} of the mosquito family, the female is equipped with an elongated proboscis that she uses to collect blood to feed her eggs. The <b>Asian</b> <b>tiger</b> <b>mosquito</b> has a rapid bite that allows it to escape most attempts by people to swat it. By contrast, the male member of the species primarily feeds on nectar.|$|E
25|$|In Asia, the <b>Asian</b> <b>tiger</b> <b>mosquito</b> can {{be mistaken}} for {{other members of the}} {{subgenus}} Stegomyia, particularly the yellow fever mosquito Aedes aegypti (the most prevalent species in the tropics and subtropics), because both species display a similar black and white pattern. It can be hard to distinguish Ae. albopictus from the closely related Aedes scutellaris (India, Indonesia, Papua New Guinea, and the Philippines), Aedes pseudoalbopictus (India, Indonesia, Malaysia, Myanmar, Nepal, Taiwan, Thailand, and Vietnam) and Aedes seatoi (Thailand).|$|E
40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{research}} was to determine larvicidal activity of the ethanol extract of Inula racemosa Hook. f. (Compositae) roots against the larvae of the Culicidae mosquito Aedes albopictus and to isolate any larvicidal constituents from the extract. Based on bioactivity-guided fractionation, 11, 13 -dihydroisoalantolactone (1), macrophyllilactone E (2), 5 α-epoxyalantolactone (3), and epoxyisoalantolactone (4) were isolated and identified as the active constituents. Compounds 1 and 2 exhibited strong larvicidal activity against the early fourth-instar larvae of A. albopictus with LC 50 values of 21. 86 [*]μg/mL and 18. 65 [*]μg/mL, respectively, while the ethanol extract had a LC 50 value of 25. 23 [*]μg/mL. Compounds 3 and 4 also possessed larvicidal activity against the <b>Asian</b> <b>tiger</b> <b>mosquitoes</b> with LC 50 values of 29. 37 [*]μg/mL and 35. 13 [*]μg/mL, respectively. The results indicated that the ethanol extract of I. racemosa and the four isolated constituents have potential for use in the control of A. albopictus larvae and could be useful in the search of newer, safer, and more effective natural compounds as larvicides...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) is a mosquito-borne, arthrogenic Alphavirus {{that causes}} large {{epidemics}} in Africa, South-East Asia and India. Recently, CHIKV has been transmitted to humans in Southern Europe by invading and now established <b>Asian</b> <b>tiger</b> <b>mosquitoes.</b> To study {{the processing of}} envelope proteins E 1 and E 2 {{and to develop a}} CHIKV subunit vaccine, C-terminally his-tagged E 1 and E 2 envelope glycoproteins were produced at high levels in insect cells with baculovirus vectors using their native signal peptides located in CHIKV 6 K and E 3, respectively. Results Expression in the presence of either tunicamycin or furin inhibitor showed that a substantial portion of recombinant intracellular E 1 and precursor E 3 E 2 was glycosylated, but that a smaller fraction of E 3 E 2 was processed by furin into mature E 3 and E 2. Deletion of the C-terminal transmembrane domains of E 1 and E 2 enabled secretion of furin-cleaved, fully processed E 1 and E 2 subunits, which could then be efficiently purified from cell culture fluid via metal affinity chromatography. Confocal laser scanning microscopy on living baculovirus-infected Sf 21 cells revealed that full-length E 1 and E 2 translocated to the plasma membrane, suggesting similar posttranslational processing of E 1 and E 2, as in a natural CHIKV infection. Baculovirus-directed expression of E 1 displayed fusogenic activity as concluded from syncytia formation. CHIKV-E 2 was able to induce neutralizing antibodies in rabbits. Conclusions Chikungunya virus glycoproteins could be functionally expressed at high levels in insect cells and are properly glycosylated and cleaved by furin. The ability of purified, secreted CHIKV-E 2 to induce neutralizing antibodies in rabbits underscores the potential use of E 2 in a subunit vaccine to prevent CHIKV infections. </p...|$|R

25|$|The <b>Asian</b> <b>tiger</b> <b>mosquito</b> {{is about}} 2 to 10mm length with a {{striking}} {{white and black}} pattern. The variation of the body size in adult mosquitoes depends on {{the density of the}} larval population and food supply within the breeding water. Since these circumstances are seldom optimal, the average body size of adult mosquitoes is considerably smaller than 10mm. For example, the average length of the abdomen was calculated to be 2.63mm, the wings 2.7mm, and the proboscis 1.88mm.|$|E
25|$|In Europe, the {{mosquito}} Culiseta annulata, {{which is very}} common, but does not occur in high densities, can be mistaken for an <b>Asian</b> <b>tiger</b> <b>mosquito</b> because of its black-and-white-ringed legs. However, this species is missing the distinctive white line that runs {{from the middle of}} its head and down the thorax. It is also considerably larger than Ae. albopictus, is not black and white, but rather beige and grey striped, and has wings with noticeable veins and four dark, indistinct spots.|$|E
25|$|Ae. albopictus also bites {{other mammals}} besides humans, {{as well as}} birds. The females are always on {{the search for a}} host and are {{persistent}} but cautious {{when it comes to their}} blood meal and host location. Their blood meal is often broken off before enough blood has been ingested for the development of their eggs, so Asian tiger mosquitoes bite multiple hosts during their development cycle of the egg, making them particularly efficient at transmitting diseases. The mannerism of biting diverse host species enables the <b>Asian</b> <b>tiger</b> <b>mosquito</b> to be a potential bridge vector for certain pathogens that can jump species boundaries, for example the West Nile virus.|$|E
50|$|The park {{contains}} {{thousands of}} {{species in the}} life domains Archaea, Bacteria, and Eukarya. There may be over 200 fungus species in the park, including artist's fungus, black locust shelf fungus, hedge-hog fungus, hen-of-the-woods, pear-shaped puffball, and turkey-tail fungus. Its trees include ashleaf maples, American beeches, American elms, black haws, cottonwoods, eastern redbuds, eastern sycamores, princesstrees, spicebushes, trees-of-heaven, tuliptrees, and white oaks. Its spring ephemerals include spring-beauties and cutleaf toothworts. Other wildflowers in the park are asters, elephant's-foot, wingstem, and yellow jewelweed. Two native plant species that are evidently now extinct in the park are round-lobed hepatica and trailing arbutus. Both ground and climbing forms of poison-ivy are common in Glover Archbold Park. In about 2000, highly pestiferous <b>Asian</b> <b>tiger</b> <b>mosquitoes</b> {{first appeared in the}} park. In 2004, adult 17-year cicadas were common there. A rare harvester butterfly was seen in the park. Some of its other insects are black swallowtails, Chinese mantids, eastern carpenter bees, eastern-tailed blues, eastern tiger swallowtails, Andrena erigeniae bees, false honey ants, impatient bumblebees, imperial moths, monarchs, Peck's skippers, Pennsylvania soldier beetles, sachem skippers, silver-spotted skippers, spicebush swallowtails, spring azures, summer azures, western honey bees, and zebra swallowtails. The park has a significant invasion of nonnative plants, including Asiatic bittersweet, bamboo, common periwinkle, English ivy, garlic-mustard, gill-over-the-ground, Japanese honeysuckle, lesser celandine, wild-garlic, and wintercreeper. Once a 2-foot tall, nonnative, tropical papaya seedling grew in the stream bed. Because people have altered the park's landscape so much, native fish are no longer in the stream. Eastern box turtles, frogs, and toads are rare or extinct in the park, not to mention American black bears, American elk, bison, and timber wolves which once lived in the Washington, D.C. area. Its birds include American robins, barred owls, blue jays, Carolina wrens, catbirds, common crows, fish crows, northern cardinals, northern mockingbirds, and wood thrushes. Mammals in the park include common raccoons, coyotes, domestic cats, domestic dogs, gray foxes, humans, short-tailed shrews, Virginia opossums, white-footed mice, and white-tailed deer.|$|R
40|$|Background. In adult female mosquitoes, the renal (Malpighian) tubules play an {{important}} role in the post-prandial diuresis, which removes excess ions and water from the hemolymph of mosquitoes following a blood meal. After the post-prandial diuresis, the roles that Malpighian tubules play in the processing of blood meals are not well described. Methods. We used a combination of next-generation sequencing (paired-end RNA sequencing) and physiological/biochemical assays in adult female <b>Asian</b> <b>tiger</b> <b>mosquitoes</b> (Aedes albopictus) to generate molecular and functional insights into the Malpighian tubules and how they may contribute to blood meal processing (3 – 24 h after blood ingestion). Results/Discussion. Using RNA sequencing, we sequenced and assembled the first de novo transcriptome of Malpighian tubules from non-blood-fed (NBF) and blood-fed (BF) mosquitoes. We identified a total of 8, 232 non-redundant transcripts. The Malpighian tubules of NBF mosquitoes were characterized by the expression of transcripts associated with active transepithelial fluid secretion/diuresis (e. g., ion transporters, water channels, V-type H+-ATPase subunits), xenobiotic detoxification (e. g., cytochrome P 450 monoxygenases, glutathione S-transferases, ATP-binding cassette transporters), and purine metabolism (e. g., xanthine dehydrogenase). We also detected the expression of transcripts encoding sodium calcium exchangers, G protein coupled-receptors, and septate junctional proteins not previously described in mosquito Malpighian tubules. Within 24 h after a blood meal, transcripts associated with active transepithelial fluid secretion/diuresis exhibited a general downregulation, whereas those associated with xenobiotic detoxification and purine catabolism exhibited a general upregulation, suggesting a reinvestment of the Malpighian tubules’ molecular resources from diuresis to detoxification. Physiological and biochemical assays were conducted in mosquitoes and isolated Malpighian tubules, respectively, to confirm that the transcriptomic changes were associated with functional consequences. In particular, in vivo diuresis assays demonstrated that adult female mosquitoes have a reduced diuretic capacity within 24 h after a blood meal. Moreover, biochemical assays in isolated Malpighian tubules showed an increase in glutathione S-transferase activity and the accumulation of uric acid (an end product of purine catabolism) within 24 h after a blood meal. Our data provide new insights into the molecular physiology of Malpighian tubules in culicine mosquitoes and reveal potentially important molecular targets for the development of chemical and/or gene-silencing insecticides that would disrupt renal function in mosquitoes...|$|R

25|$|The <b>Asian</b> <b>tiger</b> <b>mosquito</b> {{particularly}} bites in forests {{during the}} day, so {{has been known}} as the forest day mosquito. Depending upon region and biotype, activity peaks differ, {{but for the most}} part, they rest during the morning and night hours. They search for their hosts inside and outside of human dwellings, but are particularly active outside. The size of the blood meal depends upon the size of the mosquito, but it is usually around 2 μl. Their bites are not necessarily painful, but they are more noticeable than those from other kinds of mosquitoes. Tiger mosquitoes generally tend to bite a human host more than once if they are able to.|$|E
500|$|The Millennium Ecosystem Assessment (MEA) report 2005 defines {{ecosystem}} services as benefits people obtain from ecosystems, and distinguishes four categories, namely provisioning, regulating, supporting, and cultural. A fundamental tenet {{is that a}} few species of arthropod are well understood for their influence on humans (such as honeybees, ants, mosquitoes, and spiders).

The Xerces Society calculates {{the economic impact of}} four ecological services rendered by insects: pollination, recreation (i.e. [...] "the importance of bugs to hunting, fishing, and wildlife observation, including bird-watching"), dung burial, and pest control. The value has been estimated at $153 billion worldwide. As the ant expert E. O.

If insects were to vanish, the environment would collapse into chaos." [...] A Nova (TV Series) segment on the American Public Broadcasting Service framed the relationship with insects in an urban context: [...] "We humans like to think that we run the world. But even in the heart of our great cities, a rival superpower thrives... These tiny creatures live all around us in vast numbers, though we hardly even notice them. But in many ways, it is they who really run the show.
