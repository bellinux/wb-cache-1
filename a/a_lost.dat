5|$|Another {{strikingly similar}} portrait, {{depicting}} a woman also credited as Jane– although the costume differs slightly– was {{once owned by}} Richard Monckton Milnes, 1st Baron Houghton, but is now in an undisclosed private collection.

5|$|Considered <b>a</b> <b>lost</b> film {{after its}} initial release, {{because it was}} neither reissued theatrically by Madison Pictures, inheritor of the PRC library of films, nor sent to {{television}} by Universal, it was eventually relocated for television by TNT and subsequently released to home video in 1982. The Brute Man received generally negative reviews, drawing particular criticism for Hatton's poor performance.

The album peaked at number 164 on the Billboard 200 chart in the US, but charted significantly higher in other countries. Cooder did not tour in promotion of the album, citing <b>a</b> <b>lost</b> interest in both playing large concert venues and the commercial aspect of releasing records.|$|E
