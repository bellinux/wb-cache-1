5|$|In 1994, {{director}} Salim Khan <b>approached</b> <b>her</b> to {{play the}} lead female role in his directorial, Aa Gale Lag Jaa. Her father disapproved of a full-time career in film {{at such a young}} age, so she rejected the offer. At the age of eighteen, Mukerji experimented with acting by portraying a supporting role in her father's Bengali language film Biyer Phool (1996). The film starred Prosenjit and Indrani Haldar in lead roles and narrates the story of two sisters; Mukerji played the younger sibling of Haldar's character. Soon after, Khan <b>approached</b> <b>her</b> with another film offer {{to play the}} protagonist of the social drama Raja Ki Aayegi Baraat, Mukerji accepted the role due to her mother's insistence that she continue to pursue acting on an experimental basis. Before she began work on the film, Mukerji trained at Roshan Taneja's acting institute.|$|E

She was friends with Jagannadh, and he <b>approached</b> <b>her</b> for this song during the film's shoot at Mumbai, saying that the song suited her and her personality as a dancer. She also tried to {{understand the meaning of}} the lyrics while dancing. Bhardwaj was afraid of dancing, suspecting a possible sprain, and found the costumes uneasy, but had to continue upon the choreographer's insistence. Canadian-born Indian actress Ayesha Shiva was signed to play Kajal's friend in the film.|$|E

5|$|The cruisers {{experienced}} differing {{levels of}} success. Newfoundland initially attacked coastal gun batteries, but these did not fire on her or her escorting destroyer. She also successfully bombarded the airfield on Eten Island. The attacks by Achilles and Uganda on a seaplane base on Dublon Island {{did not cause}} any damage and were marred by communications problems between the ships and their spotting Seafires. As Achilles sailed away from Truk, the cruiser's anti-aircraft gunners fired on two aircraft which <b>approached</b> <b>her</b> {{from the direction of}} the atoll until they were identified as British Avengers.|$|E

Having stopped and lowered all her boats, Hogue was struck by two torpedoes around 06:55. The sudden weight loss of the two torpedoes caused U-9 to broach the surface and Hogues gunners opened fire without effect before the submarine could submerge again. The cruiser capsized about ten minutes after being torpedoed and sank at 07:15.|$|E

5|$|In 1943, Elizabeth {{undertook}} {{her first}} solo public appearance {{on a visit}} to the Grenadier Guards, of which she had been appointed colonel the previous year. As she <b>approached</b> <b>her</b> 18th birthday, parliament changed the law so that she could act as one of five Counsellors of State in the event of her father's incapacity or absence abroad, such as his visit to Italy in July 1944. In February 1945, she was appointed as an honorary second subaltern in the Auxiliary Territorial Service with the service number of 230873. She trained as a driver and mechanic and was awarded the rank of honorary junior commander five months later.|$|E
5|$|In January and February 1554, Wyatt's {{rebellion}} broke out; it {{was soon}} suppressed. Elizabeth was brought to court, and interrogated regarding her role, and on 18 March, she was imprisoned in the Tower of London. Elizabeth fervently protested her innocence. Though {{it is unlikely that}} she had plotted with the rebels, some of them were known to have <b>approached</b> <b>her.</b> Mary's closest confidant, Charles V's ambassador Simon Renard, argued that her throne would never be safe while Elizabeth lived; and the Chancellor, Stephen Gardiner, worked to have Elizabeth put on trial. Elizabeth's supporters in the government, including Lord Paget, convinced Mary to spare her sister in the absence of hard evidence against her. Instead, on 22 May, Elizabeth was moved from the Tower to Woodstock, where she was to spend almost a year under house arrest in the charge of Sir Henry Bedingfield. Crowds cheered her all along the way.|$|E
5|$|In the mid-1840s, Mary Shelley {{found herself}} {{the target of}} three {{separate}} blackmailers. In 1845, an Italian political exile called Gatteschi, whom she had met in Paris, threatened to publish letters she had sent him. A friend of her son's bribed a police chief into seizing Gatteschi's papers, including the letters, which were then destroyed. Shortly afterwards, Mary Shelley bought some letters written by herself and Percy Bysshe Shelley from a man calling himself G. Byron and posing as the illegitimate son of the late Lord Byron. Also in 1845, Percy Bysshe Shelley's cousin Thomas Medwin <b>approached</b> <b>her</b> claiming to have written a damaging biography of Percy Shelley. He said he would suppress it in return for £250, but Mary Shelley refused.|$|E

5|$|Jamila and the President was {{directed}} by Ratna Sarumpaet, a women's rights activist. The film, Sarumpaet's directorial debut, {{was based on a}} theatrical drama she had previously made entitled Pelacur dan Sang Presiden (The Prostitute and the President), which was put on in 2006 in five cities by Satu Merah Panggung Theatre Troup. She was inspired write the story in 2005 after UNICEF <b>approached</b> <b>her</b> to do a survey of child trafficking in Southeast Asia and promote awareness of the problem. While writing the original script, Sarumpaet interviewed prostitutes in Surabaya, Surakarta, Garut, and Borneo over a period of six months. This research carried over into the film.|$|E
5|$|Moffat {{initially}} doubted Gina Bellman's suitability for {{the role}} of Claire Jackman because he associated her too much with Jane Christie, the character she had played in his sitcom Coupling. Moffat did not imagine the character to be as beautiful as Bellman, but her audition was so good that he revised his vision of the character. Bellman originally auditioned {{for the role}} of Katherine, but the producers wanted someone younger to play that role. However, Bellman said that she talked herself out of the role by arguing that there should be an age gap between Katherine and Claire to avoid Katherine becoming a threat to the wife. Bellman <b>approached</b> <b>her</b> role as if Claire had become caught up in Tom's mid-life crisis, an angle that impressed the producers.|$|E
5|$|P. S. Raman, {{who went}} to Chennai in 1963 to join a medical college, was asked to see Sridhar, who was auditioning {{newcomers}} for the film. Raman was renamed Ravichandran and introduced in this film, as the character Ashok. Sivakumar had auditioned for the role before it went to Ravichandran. During a flight, Sridhar met an air-hostess named Vasundhara Devi and <b>approached</b> <b>her</b> to play one of the female leads. Because she shared her name with Vasundhara Devi, the mother of actress Vyjayanthimala, Sridhar renamed her Kanchana to avoid confusion. Telugu actor Krishna has stated that he was offered {{a role in the}} film by Sridhar, but he could not accept it due to his lack of knowledge in Tamil.|$|E

5|$|Ranbir Kapoor and Priyanka Chopra {{were the}} {{original}} {{choice for the}} film and their casting was confirmed by Anand in August 2009. After Chopra had starred earlier in Nadiadwala's Mujhse Shaadi Karogi in 2004, both had wanted to work together again, but nothing had materialised. Much later, Nadiadwala reached out to her to discuss a film he was developing with Anand and Kapoor. Chopra met Anand to discuss the script, but the project did not work out. Later when Nadiadwala <b>approached</b> <b>her</b> again with the script of Anjaana Anjaani, Chopra accepted the role. Manish Malhotra designed Chopra's clothes; Mamta Aanand designed Kapoor's. Salim Sulaiman composed the background score, while Rameshwar S. Bhagat edited the film.|$|E
5|$|Speculation also {{surrounded}} whether former series star Kristin Kreuk would reprise {{her role}} as Lana Lang. Prior to the episode's broadcast, Kreuk ignited a minor controversy by noting {{that she would not}} be watching the episode when it aired, giving some fans the impression that she was avoiding the show. Kruek released a statement on her Facebook page, clarifying that, even when she was a star on Smallville, she did not watch the episodes when they aired. Kreuk stated that Peterson and Souders never <b>approached</b> <b>her</b> about being in the finale, and that she was glad that they had not, because she was fond of how Lana's story arc ended in season eight.|$|E
5|$|After Bara's {{contract}} with Fox ended, Woods <b>approached</b> <b>her</b> about appearing in a play. She had performed on stage {{early in her}} career, working with touring companies and in summer stock, but had not performed on Broadway. Bara told a reporter that she was offered a few scripts to consider, and chose The Blue Flame (at that time titled The Lost Soul) because it allowed her to play {{two versions of the}} character, one good and the other bad. She also hoped moving to the stage would bring her new career opportunities. Woods gave Bara a lucrative contract. Each week she received a salary of $1500. This was considerably less than the $4000 per week she had earned in her last year with Fox, but Bara was also promised half the production's net profits. For example, the play's two-week run in Boston netted Bara $10,700. Woods also provided a finely appointed private railroad car to take her from city to city when the show toured.|$|E

5|$|Brady and Hindley {{visited a}} {{fairground}} on 26 December 1964, {{in search of}} another victim, and noticed 10-year-old Lesley Ann Downey standing beside one of the rides. When {{it became apparent that}} she was on her own, they <b>approached</b> <b>her</b> and deliberately dropped some of the shopping they were carrying close to her, before asking for the girl's help to carry some of the packages to their car, and then to their home. Once inside the house Downey was undressed, gagged and forced to pose for photographs before being raped and killed, perhaps strangled with a piece of string. Hindley maintained that she went to fill a bath for the child and found the girl dead (presumably killed by Brady) when she returned. In Chris Cowley's book Face to Face with Evil: Conversations with Ian Brady, Brady states that it was Hindley who killed Downey. The following morning Brady and Hindley drove with Downey's body to Saddleworth Moor, where she was buried, naked with her clothes at her feet, in a shallow grave.|$|E
5|$|In 1870, republican {{sentiment}} in Britain, {{fed by the}} Queen's seclusion, was boosted after {{the establishment of the}} Third French Republic. A republican rally in Trafalgar Square demanded Victoria's removal, and Radical MPs spoke against her. In August and September 1871, she was seriously ill with an abscess in her arm, which Joseph Lister successfully lanced and treated with his new antiseptic carbolic acid spray. In late November 1871, {{at the height of the}} republican movement, the Prince of Wales contracted typhoid fever, the disease that was believed to have killed his father, and Victoria was fearful her son would die. As the tenth anniversary of her husband's death <b>approached,</b> <b>her</b> son's condition grew no better, and Victoria's distress continued. To general rejoicing, he pulled through. Mother and son attended a public parade through London and a grand service of thanksgiving in St Paul's Cathedral on 27 February 1872, and republican feeling subsided.|$|E
5|$|U-9, {{commanded}} by Kapitänleutnant Otto Weddigen, {{had been ordered}} to attack British transports at Ostend, but {{had been forced to}} dive and take shelter from the storm. On surfacing, she spotted the British ships and moved to attack. She fired one torpedo at 06:20 at Aboukir that struck her on the starboard side; the ship's captain thought he had struck a mine and ordered the other two ships to close to transfer his wounded men. Aboukir quickly began listing and capsized around 06:55. As Hogue <b>approached</b> <b>her</b> sinking sister, Captain Wilmot Nicholson realized that it had been a submarine attack and signalled Cressy to look for a periscope although his ship continued to close on Aboukir as her crew threw overboard anything that would float to aid the survivors in the water. Having stopped and lowered all her boats, Hogue was struck by two torpedoes around 06:55. The sudden weight loss of the two torpedoes caused U-9 to broach the surface and Hogues gunners opened fire without effect before the submarine could submerge again. The cruiser capsized about ten minutes after being torpedoed as all of her watertight doors had been open and sank at 07:15.|$|E
