40|$|A brief {{analysis}} of the bsics of <b>artificial</b> <b>reefs</b> {{as well as the}} methods and techniques in use are provided. The need for clear objectives and the design of <b>artificial</b> <b>reefs</b> for long-term goals is emphasized. Several principles are established. First, <b>artificial</b> <b>reefs</b> must target the enhancement of biological and fishery production of the Cuban shelf. This principle introduces major changes in current concepts, which are bsed exclusively on the increase of catch per unit effort. Second, an adequate balance between fishing effort, refuge capacity, food availability and fish recruitment must be established. Therefore, the use of <b>artificial</b> <b>reefs</b> siwth many cavities as habitats for algae, invertebreates and fishes, in place of <b>artificial</b> <b>reefs</b> exclusively employed as fish aggregators, is discussed. A methodology for a national development program, including the materials, structures, reef configurations, quantities, and distributions is proposed. As a result of examinations of habitats on the four sections of the Cubman shelf, an area of 12, 500 sq. km. is defined as adequate for <b>artificial</b> <b>reefs</b> and isolated refuges. Eight-hundred and fifty reefs, each one formed by 200 refuges, are proposed. The use of <b>artificial</b> <b>reefs</b> for recreational fisheries is recommended for Cuba.

5000|$|Many {{ships and}} other unnaturally {{composed}} {{structures such as}} old tires are often used for constructing <b>artificial</b> <b>reefs.</b> The materials used in most <b>artificial</b> <b>reefs</b> {{are also likely to}} cause pollution by the releasing of excessive amounts of chemicals and nutrients that are not naturally found in reef environments. Retired naval vessels can release Polychlorinated Byphenyls (PCBs), asbestos, iron, lead paint and anti-fouling paint which leaches into the ocean and becomes part of the food-chain. Dumping tires into the ocean is a practice used to create many <b>artificial</b> <b>reefs</b> and a great example of the possibility that there are unseen dangers in creating <b>artificial</b> <b>reefs</b> [...] With millions of tires produced every year creating <b>artificial</b> <b>reefs</b> with them seemed like a great idea and was practiced around the world.

5|$|Following the Japanese ship-naming conventions, Kawachi and Settsu {{were named}} after ancient Japanese provinces, both now {{a part of}} Osaka prefecture. The only {{significant}} action performed by either ship during World War I was when they bombarded German fortifications in October–November 1914 during {{the final stage of}} the Battle of Tsingtao. They were both assigned to the First Squadron until they were refitted in 1917 and 1916 respectively. Upon their completion of their refits, both ships were assigned to the Second Squadron. On 12 July 1918, Kawachi was sunk in an accidental magazine explosion in Tokuyama Bay that killed over 600 crewmen.

5|$|Off {{the coast}} of Fort Lauderdale is the Osborne Reef, an <b>artificial</b> <b>reef</b> made of {{discarded}} tires that {{has proven to be}} an ecological disaster. The dumping began in the 1960s, with the intent to provide habitat for fish while disposing of trash from the land. However, in the rugged and corrosive environment of the ocean, nylon straps used to secure the tires wore out, cables rusted, and tires broke free. The tires posed a particular threat after breaking free from their restraints. The tires then migrated shoreward and ran into a living reef tract, washed up on its slope and killed many things in their path. In recent years, thousands of tires have also washed up on nearby beaches, especially during hurricanes. Local authorities are now working to remove the 700,000 tires, in cooperation with the U.S. Army, Navy and Coast Guard.|$|E
5|$|The Imperial Japanese Navy {{convened a}} {{commission}} to investigate the explosion {{the day after the}} incident with Vice Admiral Murakami Kakuichi as chairman. The commission first suspected arson, but no plausible suspect could be found and it reported that the cordite in her magazine might have spontaneously ignited due to decomposition. Kawachis magazines had been inspected in January–February 1918, however, and no problems were discovered, which made that possibility less likely. The commission made recommendations on tighter control of production and handling of cordite that were successfully adopted by the navy. The Japanese Navy considered salvaging Kawachi, but ultimately decided that it would be too expensive and would delay the construction of one battlecruiser by over a year.

40|$|Marine-based {{recreation}} and tourism activities have experienced substantial {{growth over the}} past few decades and concerns about the ecological sustainability of many of these activities have been recognised by researchers, policy-makers and the {{recreation and}} tourism industries. One strategy to deal with diver-induced impacts is the creation of new or <b>artificial</b> <b>reefs</b> which, when established, can become substitute dive sites for more naturally occurring reefs. However, there have been very few studies into the acceptability of these substitute reef environments to divers and the social aspects of diving on <b>artificial</b> <b>reefs.</b> This paper explores the perceptions of diving on <b>artificial</b> <b>reefs</b> through a questionnaire survey of a sample of 337 Australian scuba divers. The awareness of <b>artificial</b> <b>reefs</b> as dive sites among respondents was very high, as were the levels of satisfaction with diving on such sites. Many divers recognised the value of these reefs in reducing diver impacts on natural reefs, and the study shows that <b>artificial</b> <b>reefs</b> do hold considerable attraction to divers. It is concluded that <b>artificial</b> <b>reefs</b> have significant potential for broadening the scuba diving resource base and the range of experiences available, and for simultaneously reducing visitor impacts and pressures on natural reefs...|$|R
40|$|Abstract The use of {{geographic}} information systems (GIS) to support ecosystem management involves the input and participation of groups who {{make use of}} fisheries species. Recent provisions for essential fish habitat (EFH) in the Magnuson-Stevens Conservation and Management Act emphasize the conservation of fisheries habitats. <b>Artificial</b> <b>reefs</b> can now qualify as EFH. <b>Artificial</b> <b>reefs</b> should be managed to conserve and enhance fisheries production. Recent research indicates that <b>artificial</b> <b>reefs</b> primarily provide shelter from predation and that the associated fishes forage over surrounding areas. Hence, the placement of <b>artificial</b> <b>reefs</b> in suitable habitats, determined {{with the aid of}} GIS, is needed to properly manage reef fishes. Research involving the use of <b>artificial</b> <b>reefs</b> tied to zoning strategies is a positive approach to assessing the best means to protect estuarine and marine habitats, to enhance spawning stocks, and to manage reef fisheries. The placement of <b>artificial</b> <b>reefs</b> in Ano-take@ marine reserves and in surrounding fishing zones is being proposed to protect spawning stocks of reef fishes, while providing separate areas for diving and for fishing. The development of regional zoning strategies and community-based participation will be necessary to implement this type of marine ecosystem management...|$|R
40|$|<b>Artificial</b> <b>reefs</b> {{have been}} used in the United States in order to turn barren, {{unproductive}} substrate into highly productive environments. For many years the only purpose of <b>artificial</b> <b>reefs</b> has been to aggregate important gamefish. Increasing fishing pressure and decreasing coastal and estuarine environmental quality have contributed to a depletion in fish stocks. Coastal and estuarine areas serve as important nursery grounds for many species of fish. Deployment of <b>artificial</b> <b>reefs</b> has been suggested as a means for mitigation of damage to these areas. However, if we are to mitigate the damage and loss of these extremely important coastal and estuarine areas, simply aggregating adult fish stocks will not provide a solution. Rather, it will contribute to the demise of fisheries by making adult fish easier to exploit. The answer may be to create <b>artificial</b> <b>reefs</b> which will serve as nursery grounds and actually help to increase the numbers of fish available. The {{purpose of this study is}} to review the history and biology of <b>artificial</b> <b>reefs.</b> It will be demonstrated that it is possible to build <b>artificial</b> <b>reefs</b> which can not only increase recruitment (provide new individuals to the population), but increase production (absolute biomass) as well...|$|R
