5|$|Samarium is a {{rare earth}} metal having a {{hardness}} and density {{similar to those of}} zinc. With the boiling point of 1794°C, samarium is the third most volatile lanthanide after ytterbium and europium; this property facilitates separation of samarium from the mineral ore. At <b>ambient</b> <b>conditions,</b> samarium normally assumes a rhombohedral structure (α form). Upon heating to 731°C, its crystal symmetry changes into hexagonally close-packed (hcp), however the transition temperature depends on the metal purity. Further heating to 922°C transforms the metal into a body-centered cubic (bcc) phase. Heating to 300°C combined with compression to 40kbar results in a double-hexagonally close-packed structure (dhcp). Applying higher pressure of the order of hundreds or thousands of kilobars induces a series of phase transformations, in particular with a tetragonal phase appearing at about 900kbar. In one study, the dhcp phase could be produced without compression, using a nonequilibrium annealing regime with a rapid temperature change between about 400 and 700°C, confirming the transient character of this samarium phase. Also, thin films of samarium obtained by vapor deposition may contain the hcp or dhcp phases at <b>ambient</b> <b>conditions.</b>|$|E

5|$|As {{reflected}} in the table above, samarium halides change their crystal structures when one type of halide atoms is substituted for another, which is an uncommon behavior for most elements (e.g. actinides). Many halides have two major crystal phases for one composition, one being significantly more stable and another being metastable. The latter is formed upon compression or heating, followed by quenching to <b>ambient</b> <b>conditions.</b> For example, compressing the usual monoclinic samarium diiodide and releasing the pressure results in a PbCl2-type orthorhombic structure (density 5.90 g/cm3), and similar treatment results in a new phase of samarium triiodide (density 5.97 g/cm3).|$|E
5|$|At <b>ambient</b> <b>conditions</b> bismuth {{shares the}} same layered {{structure}} as the metallic forms of arsenic and antimony, crystallizing in the rhombohedral lattice (Pearson symbol hR6, space group Rm No. 166), {{which is often}} classed into trigonal or hexagonal crystal systems. When compressed at room temperature, this Bi-I structure changes first to the monoclinic Bi-II at 2.55 GPa, then to the tetragonal Bi-III at 2.7 GPa, and finally to the body-centered cubic Bi-IV at 7.7 GPa. The corresponding transitions can be monitored via changes in electrical conductivity; they are rather reproducible and abrupt, and are therefore used for calibration of high-pressure equipment.|$|E

Graphite has a layered structure. Each layer comprises carbon atoms bonded to three other carbon atoms in a honeycomb lattice arrangement.

5|$|Curium is a hard, dense, silvery metal with a {{relatively}} high melting point and boiling point for an actinide. Whereas it is paramagnetic at <b>ambient</b> <b>conditions,</b> it becomes antiferromagnetic upon cooling, and other magnetic transitions are also observed for many curium compounds. In compounds, curium usually exhibits valence +3 and sometimes +4, and the +3 valence is predominant in solutions. Curium readily oxidizes, and its oxides are a dominant form of this element. It forms strongly fluorescent complexes with various organic compounds, {{but there is no}} evidence of its incorporation into bacteria and archaea. When introduced into the human body, curium accumulates in the bones, lungs and liver, where it promotes cancer.|$|E
5|$|Optical properties, {{including}} the PL efficiency, {{can be modified}} by encapsulating organic dyes (carotene, lycopene, etc.) inside the tubes. Efficient energy transfer occurs between the encapsulated dye and nanotube — light is efficiently absorbed by the dye and without significant loss is transferred to the SWCNT. Thus potentially, optical properties of a carbon nanotube can be controlled by encapsulating certain molecule inside it. Besides, encapsulation allows isolation and characterization of organic molecules which are unstable under <b>ambient</b> <b>conditions.</b> For example, Raman spectra are extremely difficult to measure from dyes because of their strong PL (efficiency close to 100%). However, encapsulation of dye molecules inside SWCNTs completely quenches dye PL, thus allowing measurement and analysis of their Raman spectra.|$|E
5|$|At <b>ambient</b> <b>conditions,</b> {{berkelium}} assumes {{its most}} stable α form {{which has a}} hexagonal symmetry, space group P63/mmc, lattice parameters of 341pm and 1107pm. The crystal has a double-hexagonal close packing structure with the layer sequence ABAC and so is isotypic (having a similar structure) with α-lanthanum and α-forms of actinides beyond curium. This crystal structure changes with pressure and temperature. When compressed at room temperature to 7GPa, α-berkelium transforms to the beta modification, which has a face-centered cubic (fcc) symmetry and space group Fmm. This transition occurs without change in volume, but the enthalpy increases by 3.66 kJ/mol. Upon further compression to 25GPa, berkelium transforms to an orthorhombic γ-berkelium structure {{similar to that of}} α-uranium. This transition is accompanied by a 12% volume decrease and delocalization of the electrons at the 5f electron shell. No further phase transitions are observed up to 57 GPa.|$|E

A PCE of 4. 37 % was finally obtained after 5 days storage, which outperformed the ones with evaporated-MoO 3 using poly(3 -hexylthiophene) (P 3 HT) as donor material and [6, 6]-phenyl-C 61 -butyric acid methyl ester (PC 61 BM) as acceptor. The improved device efficiency {{can be attributed to}} the high conductivity and increasing work function of L-Bi 2 Se 3. The work function of L-Bi 2 Se 3 increased with the storage time in <b>ambient</b> <b>condition</b> due to the oxygen atom doping. Ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy and high resolution X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy were conducted to verify the increased work function, which originated from the p-type doping process.

5|$|Beryllium is a steel {{gray and}} hard metal that is brittle at room {{temperature}} and has a close-packed hexagonal crystal structure. It has exceptional stiffness (Young's modulus 287 GPa) and a reasonably high melting point. The modulus of elasticity of beryllium is approximately 50% {{greater than that of}} steel. The combination of this modulus and a relatively low density results in an unusually fast sound conduction speed in beryllium – about 12.9km/s at <b>ambient</b> <b>conditions.</b> Other significant properties are high specific heat (1925 J·kg−1·K−1) and thermal conductivity (216 W·m−1·K−1), which make beryllium the metal with the best heat dissipation characteristics per unit weight. In combination with the relatively low coefficient of linear thermal expansion (11.4×10−6 K−1), these characteristics result in a unique stability under conditions of thermal loading.|$|E
5|$|Tungsten {{exists in}} two major {{crystalline}} forms: α and β. The former has a {{body-centered cubic structure}} and is the more stable form. The structure of the β phase is called A15 cubic; it is metastable, but can coexist with the α phase at <b>ambient</b> <b>conditions</b> owing to non-equilibrium synthesis or stabilization by impurities. Contrary to the α phase which crystallizes in isometric grains, the β form exhibits a columnar habit. The α phase has {{one third of the}} electrical resistivity and a much lower superconducting transition temperature TC relative to the β phase: ca. 0.015 K vs. 1–4 K; mixing the two phases allows obtaining intermediate TC values. The TC value can also be raised by alloying tungsten with another metal (e.g. 7.9 K for W-Tc). Such tungsten alloys are sometimes used in low-temperature superconducting circuits.|$|E
5|$|A synthetic, {{radioactive}} element, curium is a hard, dense metal with a silvery-white {{appearance and}} {{physical and chemical}} properties resembling those of gadolinium. Its melting point of 1340°C is significantly higher than that of the previous transuranic elements neptunium (637°C), plutonium (639°C) and americium (1173°C). In comparison, gadolinium melts at 1312°C. The boiling point of curium is 3110°C. With a density of 13.52 g/cm3, curium is significantly lighter than neptunium (20.45 g/cm3) and plutonium (19.8 g/cm3), but is heavier than most other metals. Between two crystalline forms of curium, the α-Cm is more stable at <b>ambient</b> <b>conditions.</b> It has a hexagonal symmetry, space group P63/mmc, lattice parameters a = 365 pm and c = 1182 pm, and four formula units per unit cell. The crystal consists of a double-hexagonal close packing with the layer sequence ABAC and so is isotypic with α-lanthanum. At pressures above 23 GPa, at room temperature, α-Cm transforms into β-Cm, which has a face-centered cubic symmetry, space group Fmm and the lattice constant a = 493 pm. Upon further compression to 43 GPa, curium transforms to an orthorhombic γ-Cm structure similar to that of α-uranium, with no further transitions observed up to 52 GPa. These three curium phases are also referred to as Cm I, II and III.|$|E

5|$|Boron {{is similar}} to carbon in its {{capability}} to form stable covalently bonded molecular networks. Even nominally disordered (amorphous) boron contains regular boron icosahedra which are, however, bonded randomly to each other without long-range order. Crystalline boron is a very hard, black material with a melting point of above 2000°C. It forms four major polymorphs: α-rhombohedral and β-rhombohedral (α-R and β-R), γ and β-tetragonal (β-T); α-tetragonal phase also exists (α-T), but {{is very difficult to}} produce without significant contamination. Most of the phases are based on B12 icosahedra, but the γ-phase can be described as a rocksalt-type arrangement of the icosahedra and B2 atomic pairs. It can be produced by compressing other boron phases to 12–20GPa and heating to 1500–1800°C; it remains stable after releasing the temperature and pressure. The T phase is produced at similar pressures, but higher temperatures of 1800–2200°C. As to the α and β phases, they might both coexist at <b>ambient</b> <b>conditions</b> with the β phase being more stable. Compressing boron above 160GPa produces a boron phase with an as yet unknown structure, and this phase is a superconductor at temperatures 6–12 K. Borospherene (fullerene-like B40) molecules) and borophene (proposed graphene-like structure) have been described in 2014.|$|E
5|$|Hydrogen, {{like some}} of the alkali metals, reacts explosively with fluorine. Carbon, as lamp black, reacts at room {{temperature}} to yield fluoromethane. Graphite combines with fluorine above 400°C (750°F) to produce non-stoichiometric carbon monofluoride; higher temperatures generate gaseous fluorocarbons, sometimes with explosions. Carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide react at or just above room temperature, whereas paraffins and other organic chemicals generate strong reactions: even fully substituted haloalkanes such as carbon tetrachloride, normally incombustible, may explode. Although nitrogen trifluoride is stable, nitrogen requires an electric discharge at elevated temperatures for reaction with fluorine to occur, due to the very strong triple bond in elemental nitrogen; ammonia may react explosively. Oxygen does not combine with fluorine under <b>ambient</b> <b>conditions,</b> but can be made to react using electric discharge at low temperatures and pressures; the products tend to disintegrate into their constituent elements when heated. Heavier halogens react readily with fluorine as does the noble gas radon; of the other noble gases, only xenon and krypton react, and only under special conditions.|$|E
5|$|At <b>ambient</b> <b>conditions,</b> {{americium}} {{is present}} in its most stable α form which has a hexagonal crystal symmetry, and a space group P63/mmc with lattice parameters a= 346.8pm and c= 1124pm, and four atoms per unit cell. The crystal consists of a double-hexagonal close packing with the layer sequence ABAC and so is isotypic with α-lanthanum and several actinides such as α-curium. The crystal structure of americium changes with pressure and temperature. When compressed at room temperature to 5 GPa, α-Am transforms to the β modification, which has a face-centered cubic (fcc) symmetry, space group Fmm and lattice constant a= 489pm. This fcc structure {{is equivalent to the}} closest packing with the sequence ABC. Upon further compression to 23 GPa, americium transforms to an orthorhombic γ-Am structure similar to that of α-uranium. There are no further transitions observed up to 52 GPa, except for an appearance of a monoclinic phase at pressures between 10 and 15 GPa. There is no consistency on the status of this phase in the literature, which also sometimes lists the α, β and γ phases as I, II and III. The β-γ transition is accompanied by a 6% decrease in the crystal volume; although theory also predicts a significant volume change for the α-β transition, it is not observed experimentally. The pressure of the α-β transition decreases with increasing temperature, and when α-americium is heated at ambient pressure, at 770°C it changes into an fcc phase which is different from β-Am, and at 1075°C it converts to a body-centered cubic structure. The pressure-temperature phase diagram of americium is thus rather similar to those of lanthanum, praseodymium and neodymium.|$|E
