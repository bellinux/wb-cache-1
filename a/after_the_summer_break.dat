5|$|Bawdsey, {{right on}} the eastern coast in a {{relatively}} secluded location, could not effectively be protected from air attack or even bombardment from boats offshore. The need to move the team to a more protected location on the opening of hostilities had been identified long before the war. During a visit to his alma mater at Dundee University, Watt approached the rector to ask about potentially basing the team there, on short notice. When the Germans invaded Poland and war was declared on 3 September 1939, the research teams packed up and arrived in Dundee to find the rector only dimly recalling the conversation and having nothing prepared for their arrival. Students and professors had since returned <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>summer</b> <b>break,</b> and only two small rooms were available for the entire group.|$|E
5|$|The exact date of his {{reception}} is a mystery. According to Maiorescu's own recollections, written some {{decades after}} the event, Creangă was in attendance at a Junimea meeting of 1871, during which Gheorghe Costaforu proposed to transform the club into a political party. The information was considered dubious by Z. Ornea, who argued that the episode may have been entirely invented by the Junimist leader, and noted that it contradicted both Negruzzi's accounts and minutes kept by A. D. Xenopol. According to Ornea's assessment, {{with the exception of}} literary critic Vladimir Streinu, all of Creangă's biographers have come to dismiss Maiorescu's statement. Several sources mention that the future writer was introduced to the society by Eminescu, who was an active member around 1875. This and other details lead Ornea to conclude that membership was granted to Creangă only <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>summer</b> <b>break</b> of 1875.|$|E
25|$|For {{most of the}} 2006 season Brann were top of {{the league}} and by many {{considered}} to be favourites to win the title.

Marr appeared as a guest on the show on 14 April to speak about Margaret Thatcher's legacy, and spoke about the incident and his recovery. Paralysis of {{the left side of his}} body was evident, but his speech was unaffected, and he expressed determination to return to the presenter's role. Marr conducted pre-recorded interviews with David Miliband and David Cameron for the editions of 14 and 21 July respectively, and returned to the main presenter's role <b>after</b> <b>the</b> series' <b>summer</b> <b>break</b> in September.|$|R
50|$|In {{a desperate}} bid {{to help keep}} up {{civilian}} morale as the tide of war turned against the country, league play was immediately resumed within weeks of the championship match rather than <b>after</b> <b>the</b> customary three-month <b>summer</b> <b>break.</b> Hamburg completed only three games before play by all military clubs was suspended in September 1944 as Allied armies began to advance on Germany.|$|R
25|$|The {{school year}} starts <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>summer</b> <b>break</b> (different {{from state to}} state, usually end/mid of August) and {{is divided into two}} terms. There are {{typically}} 12 weeks of holidays in addition to public holidays. Exact dates differ between states, but there are generally six weeks of summer and two weeks of Christmas holiday. The other holiday periods occur in spring (during the period around Easter Sunday) and autumn (during the former harvest, where farmers used to need their children for field work). Schools can also schedule two or three special days off per term.|$|E
25|$|<b>After</b> <b>the</b> <b>summer</b> <b>break,</b> Willy van de Kerkhof, {{present at}} both the 1978 and 1988 triumphs, was honored with a {{farewell}} match. The 1988–89 season again resulted in the double: Hiddink’s squad won the title (albeit with less dominance than the year before) and PSV beat Groningen in the cup final. In comparison, the international competitions were disappointing. The Intercontinental Cup against Nacional ended in a 2–2 draw, but PSV lost the penalty shoot-out with 7–6. The team was also beaten in the UEFA Super Cup by KV Mechelen (3–1 on aggregate). In the European Cup, Real Madrid got its revenge by eliminating PSV in the quarter-finals.|$|E
25|$|The {{quality of}} the singing, which was still modest in {{comparison}} with large boarding school choirs, was such {{a cause for concern}} among the choir parents that, after a weak appearance in a church service in Kleinhüningen, they demanded that the choir refrain from further public appearances for the time being. For that reason, the rehearsal time was extended from 75 to 120 minutes and divided into 60 minutes each of singing technique and choir rehearsal <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>summer</b> <b>break</b> in 1930. Meanwhile, the choir had grown to 88 boys, which necessitated changing the rehearsal space from St. John's Chapel to a larger and considerably more expensive location in Nadelberg by the Peterskirche. In December, 1930, the choir celebrated its 25th appearance. Their quality and proficiency had gradually increased, and soloists were already emerging from the choir.|$|E

5000|$|He {{eventually}} made his debut for Bristol Rovers {{in their final}} game of the 2010-11 season, when he came on as an 88th-minute substitute for Harry Pell against Colchester United at the Colchester Community Stadium. His hopes of continuing to play first team football <b>after</b> <b>the</b> 2011 <b>summer</b> <b>break</b> were dashed however when he suffered a rupture to his anterior cruciate ligament on his first day back in training, leaving him unable to play for several months while he recovered from reconstructive surgery.

50|$|During the war, {{football}} {{was used as}} a morale booster for the population and was supported by the regime. Many teams were sponsored by the Luftwaffe, the SS, or other branches of the military. As the tide turned against Germany, the Gauliga began to crumble as players were called away to military service or were killed in the conflict, stadiums were bombed and travel became difficult. The original sixteen Gauligen broke up into over thirty smaller, more local circuits. The level of play deteriorated and lopsided scores became common, the record being a 32-0 win by Germania Mudersbach over FV Engen. The 1943-44 championship was initially cancelled but eventually went ahead <b>after</b> widespread protest. <b>The</b> 1944-45 season began less than two weeks later, rather than <b>after</b> <b>the</b> usual three-month <b>summer</b> <b>break.</b> <b>The</b> last recorded match in the Third Reich was on April 23, 1945 as Bayern Munich defeated 1860 Munich 3:2. Less than three weeks later, Germany surrendered unconditionally.|$|R

2500|$|However, <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>summer</b> <b>break</b> {{things got}} decidedly worse.

Asked by Bannister {{to watch the}} rules, Evans the next day branded Bannister [...] "The Fat Controller". In November, Evans announced on air that he was medically unfit {{to be on the}} radio – Bannister re-negotiated his contract to double his holiday to twice that of other Radio 1 DJs. After more publicised public drinking and self-confessed illness, Evans' spell at the station ended in January 1997 when he quit after his demand not to host the show on Friday (to have a full day getting ready for his TV show) was not accepted.|$|E
