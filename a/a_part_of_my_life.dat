500|$|Ricki-Lee Dawn Coulter {{was born}} on 10 November 1985 in Auckland, New Zealand. Her mother Loretta Sheerin, of Māori descent, was a model. Coulter's parents {{separated}} before she was born, and she was raised by her mother. Coulter and her mother relocated to Gold Coast, Queensland when she was three months old. Coulter's father figure {{at the time was}} her grandfather Rocky. Coulter's mother gave her every chance to visit her biological father in New Zealand when she was a child. [...] "He wasn't <b>a</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>life.</b> I'd go over there and stay with him and his family, [...] it was just weird to me. Then when I got to an age where I could speak up to Mum, about six or seven, I said, 'I don't want to go; I don't like it.'" ...|$|E
2500|$|Coonan's casting as Carl was {{announced}} on 6 May 2013, {{when it was}} revealed that the character is Kirsty Branning's (Kierston Wareing) ex-boyfriend and has been in prison, where he had shared a cell with Derek Branning (Jamie Foreman). Coonan said of his casting, [...] "EastEnders has been <b>a</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>life</b> since I was 12 years old. I even remember talking about the storylines in school playgrounds in Tottenham and I am very happy and proud to now be a small part of its life." [...] Executive producer Lorraine Newman said: [...] "It's wonderful to have Daniel Coonan joining us in Walford to play Carl White. Oozing confidence and with a dangerous edge, will Kirsty be able to resist his bad boy charms for long, or can [...] Max [...] save her from the lure of the dark side?" [...] This is Coonan's second role in EastEnders, as he played David Priors in 2011. Coonan said the four-episode role helped him prepare for a bigger role in the programme, though describing his first day on set as Carl, he said, [...] "it still hits you when you walk on to the Square for the very first time. It's like walking into your TV." [...] Coonan filmed his first scene on the Bridge Street market set. Heat reported that Carl's introduction was part of a [...] "rescue plan" [...] to increase ratings for EastEnders, especially with the announced departures of popular characters Tanya Branning (Jo Joyner), Jack Branning (Scott Maslen) and Michael Moon (Steve John Shepherd), saying [...] "with ever-dwindling ratings and an unusually bare trophy cabinet, producers have been forced to plan some major shake-ups in an attempt to revive the ailing drama with new characters, returning familiar faces and exciting storylines." [...] Coonan later said of being cast, [...] "When they offered the part of Carl to me, I thought about it {{as long as it takes}} to blink your eyelids. I knew it would be a great character and fun to play. Something like this can massively raise your profile. I'm beaming into thousands of people's homes four times a week." [...] Coonan was originally contracted to appear in 28 episodes over a six-month period, but instead filmed over 60 episodes. After Danny Dyer was cast as Mick Carter in the show, he revealed that he was approached to play Carl.|$|E

It is <b>a</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> professional duty to study and to understand a gentleman who confides his interests to me. In my professional duty I shall not be wanting, sir, if I know it. I may, with the best intentions, be wanting in it without knowing it; but not if I know it, sir." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "I must {{thank you}} for the last time," [...] she said. [...] "As long as life is left, my {{gratitude}} will be <b>a</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>life.</b> Let me go. While I can still control myself, let me go!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{know they}} are," [...] she repeated. [...] "If I didn't, I would be desolate. I {{have been sitting}} now for over thirty years, and these {{friendly}} voices are <b>a</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>life.</b> They comfort me more than I can tell." ...|$|E

6000|$|In all the toil of {{the harvest}} field, the water jug filled a large place. It {{was a source of}} anxiety as well as comfort. To keep it cool, to keep it well filled was <b>a</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> job. No man passed it at the [...] "home corner" [...] of the field. It is <b>a</b> {{delightful}} <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> recollections <b>of</b> the harvest.|$|R

I know you better. Indeed I know you with all my heart. You think all your talk was thrown away upon me, that I never {{understood}} that side of you, or your ambitions or anything. I did. More than I thought at the time. Now--now it is all clear to me. What I had to understand in you was something deeper than Edward brought me. I have it now. [...] . You are <b>a</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>life,</b> and I don't want to cut all that off from me now I have comprehended it, and throw it away." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Why not?" [...] she asked, {{moving a}} step towards him. [...] "It was a foolish promise. It has done {{neither of us}} any good. It has spoilt <b>a</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>life.</b> Why should I keep silence, {{and let it go}} on to the end? Do you know what it has made of me, this promise?" ...|$|E
6000|$|And then, {{all in a}} moment, a {{flash of}} inner light seemed to illumine <b>a</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>life</b> that had all but faded into oblivion--the strange visions I had {{experienced}} during my journey to Elveston: and with a thrill of delight I thought [...] "Those visions are destined to be linked with my waking life!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "An errand boy," [...] he replied. [...] "Somebody had to come, so {{they chose}} me. Incidentally," [...] he added, smiling down at her, [...] "it is <b>a</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> education." ...|$|R

6000|$|All {{these things}} had small money value, {{and to many}} men, would have {{represented}} no interest whatsoever, but to me they were precious.

And yet they were the best I could show after thirty years of labor with the pen! ...|$|E
60|$|I {{could not}} get over this {{farewell}} glimpse of {{them for a long}} time. When Agnes wrote to tell me of her safe arrival, I was as miserable as when I saw her going away. Whenever I fell into a thoughtful state, this subject was sure to present itself, and all my uneasiness was sure to be redoubled. Hardly a night passed without my dreaming of it. It became <b>a</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>life,</b> and as inseparable from my life as my own head.|$|E

If she does, she does not know it herself yet. It will be my sweet task to teach her what love means, and no man has ever had a lovelier, purer, pupil." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The man who {{means to}} succeed," [...] he continued, [...] "to succeed {{in any one}} position, must {{sacrifice}} everything else--temperament, if necessary character--for that one thing. When I left college, the study of politics was almost chosen for me. It became <b>a</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>life.</b> As my interest developed, {{it is true that}} my outlook upon life was narrowed. I was content to forget, perhaps, that I was a man, I strove fervently and desperately to develop into the perfect political machine. From that point of view, nobody in England would have made me a better wife than Lady Anne Clonarty." ...|$|E
60|$|And now I {{come to a}} part of {{my story}} {{touching}} myself very nearly indeed, and for which I was quite unprepared when the circumstance occurred. Whatever little lingerings may have now and then revived in my mind associated with my poor old face had only revived as belonging to <b>a</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>life</b> that was gone--gone like my infancy or my childhood. I have suppressed none of my many weaknesses on that subject, but have written them as faithfully as my memory has recalled them. And I hope to do, and mean to do, the same down to the last words of these pages, which I see now not so very far before me.|$|E

60|$|As {{the train}} took its time and ours in {{mounting}} the uplands toward Granada on the soft, {{but not too}} soft, evening of November 6, 1911, the air that came to me {{through the open window}} breathed as if from an autumnal night of the middle eighteen-fifties in a little village of northeastern Ohio. I was now going to see, for the first time, the city where so great <b>a</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>life</b> was then passed, and in this magical air the two epochs were blent in reciprocal association. The question of my present identity was a thing indifferent and apart; it did not matter who or where or when I was. Youth and age were at one with each other: the boy abiding in the old man, and the old man pensively willing to dwell for the enchanted moment in any vantage of the past which would give him shelter.|$|E
6000|$|... "Moses," [...] said Mara, {{stopping}} {{and looking at}} him in the clear moonlight, [...] "God has always been to me not so much like a father as like a dear and tender mother. Perhaps it was because I was a poor orphan, and my father and mother died at my birth, that He has been so loving to me. I never remember the time when I did not feel His presence in my joys and my sorrows. I never had a thought of joy and sorrow that I could not say to Him. I never woke in the night that I did not feel that He was loving and watching me, and that I loved Him in return. Oh, how many, many things I have said to Him about you! My heart would have broken years ago, {{had it not been for}} Him; because, though you did not know it, you often seemed unkind; you hurt me very often when you did not mean to. His love is so much <b>a</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>life</b> that I cannot conceive of life without it. It is the very air I breathe." ...|$|E

I could make such a confession of what I felt--only I am afraid of offending you by speaking too soon. Women are so dreadfully difficult to understand. How is a man to know at what time it is considerate toward them to conceal his true feelings; and at what time it is equally considerate to express his true feelings? One doesn't know whether {{it is a matter of}} days or weeks or months--there ought to be a law to settle it. Dear Miss Charlotte, when a poor fellow loves you at first sight, as he has never loved any other woman, and when he is tormented by the fear that some other man may be preferred to him, can't you forgive him if he lets out the truth a little too soon?" [...] He ventured, as he put that very downright question, to take her hand. [...] "It really isn't my fault," [...] he said, simply.
