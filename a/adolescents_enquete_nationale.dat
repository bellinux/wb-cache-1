40|$|The {{demand for}} travel has {{conventionally}} been {{considered to be}} derived from the demand for spatially-separated activities. This truism has come under question in recent years, with evidence mounting that to some extent (varying with circumstance) travel is desired for its own sake. This highlights the importance of learning more about how individuals perceive the journey itself, since their positive or negative affect for the journey can influence their later travel choices (regarding frequency, mode, length, and other variables). The 2007 - 08 French National Travel Survey, FNTS (<b>Enquête</b> <b>Nationale</b> Transports et Déplacements, ENTD), offers a unique opportunity to explore this issue with a large-sample (about 20, 000 households), nationally-representative travel diary dataset. Alone among national travel surveys (to our knowledge), the FNTS asked several questions related to the individual’s perception of the trip, for a randomly-selected trip among those reported by that person. The present analysis focuses on two of those variables, mufatigue and musensation...|$|R
40|$|This study {{represents}} a first {{report of a}} regional cross-country analysis of patterns in equity and growth in tertiary education in Sub-Saharan Africa. In it, we analyse country-level surveys and regional statistics to see how expansion affected equity, how equity is explained by household characteristics and other factors, and what the intrinsic characteristics of the tertiary education system are that influence equity. Data show that in many instances, Sub-Saharan African countries fall behind other regions in terms of equity; and whereas some policies, such as diversifi-cation and more equitable pre-tertiary education can help, more efforts and more effective policies need to be introduced {{to make the system}} more equitable. The report argues that growth itself will not necessarily lead to improved equity and more equitable access to tertiary education can help the sector in achieving its higher-level objectives, including its contribution to competitiveness and prosperity. Cette étude constitue le premier rapport d’une analyse de l’équité et de la croissance de l’enseignement supérieur en Afrique sub-saharienne. Nous analysons des <b>enquêtes</b> <b>nationales</b> et des statistiques régionales pour montrer la manière dont la croissance affecte l’équité, comment l’équité peut être expliquée par les caractéristiques des ménages ainsi que par d’autres facteurs et quels facteurs propres au système d’enseignement about the authors: All three authors work at the World Bank in Washington, D.

40|$|A partir de données nationales permanentes et d'enquêtes ad hoc (enquête confidentielle sur la mortalité maternelle et <b>Enquête</b> <b>nationale</b> périnatale) International audienceOBJECTIVES: To {{test the}} {{hypothesis}} that the risk of postpartum maternal death in France remains significantly higher for women of foreign nationality after individual characteristics are taken into account and to examine whether the quality of care received by the women who died differs according to nationality. DESIGN: A national case-control study. SETTING: Metropolitan France. POPULATION: A total of 267 women who died of maternal death from 1996 to 2001 as cases and a representative sample (n = 13 186) of women who gave birth in 1998 as controls. METHODS: Crude and adjusted odd ratios were calculated with multivariate logistic regression, and the quality of care for cases was compared according to nationality with chi-square tests or Fisher's exact tests. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Odd ratio for postpartum maternal death associated with nationality and quality of care. RESULTS: After taking individual characteristics into account, the risk of postpartum maternal death was twice as high for foreign women. The odds ratio was 5. 5 (95 % CI: 3. 3 - 9. 0) for women from sub-Saharan Africa and 3. 3 (95 % CI: 1. 7 - 6. 5) for those from Asia, North and South America. There was no significant excess risk of postpartum maternal death for the other European and North Africa women. The risk of dying from hypertensive disorder or infection was four times higher for foreign women. Among women who died, care was more often considered not optimal for foreign women (78 versus 57 %). CONCLUSIONS: The excess risk of postpartum maternal death persisted for foreign women after individual characteristics were taken into account and was especially important for some nationalities and for some causes of death, primarily hypertensive disorders. These results point to an immediate need to pay special attention to early enrollment in prenatal care, screening and prenatal management of hypertension, especially in women of sub-Saharan African nationality...|$|R
40|$|This {{study was}} carried out to {{evaluate}} the trends in cause-specific mortality {{and the impact of}} child-survival programmes in Morocco. Two national surveys on causes and circumstances of child deaths were conducted in Morocco in 1988 and 1998 (ECCD- 1 and ECCD- 2 respectively). These surveys were based on a representative sample of deaths of children aged less than five years (432 and 866 respectively). Causes of death were assessed by verbal autopsy and were validated on a subsample of 94 cases. Data on causes of deaths were matched with death rates from demographic surveys (<b>Enquete</b> <b>Nationale</b> Demographique a Passages Repetes and Demographic and Health Survey) to compute cause-specific death rates. Morocco underwent a dramatic mortality decline since independence, and the decline in mortality among children aged less than five years was particularly rapid over the 1988 - 1997 period, at an average rate of - 6 % a year, and faster for children (aged 1 - 4 year(s)) than for infants. The decline in mortality varied markedly by causes of death and was most pronounced for causes due to vaccine-preventable diseases, such as neonatal tetanus, measles, whooping cough, tuberculosis, for diarrhoeal diseases and malnutrition, and for selected infectious diseases. However, mortality due to acute lower respiratory infection (ALRI) outside the neonatal period did not change significantly as was the case for some neonatal conditions (birth trauma and prematurity) and for accidents. The decline in cause-specific mortality could be attributed to the success of public-health programmes: the Expanded Programme on Immunization, the management of diarrhoeal diseases and malnutrition, and the use of antibiotics for selected infectious diseases. It is likely that improvements in living conditions, child-feeding practices, hygiene, and sanitation also contributed to the decline in mortality, although these could not explain the magnitude of the changes for target diseases. In contrast, the ALRI programme, which started after 1997, could not have any effect yet, and conditions of delivery and care of the newborn improved only marginally over the study period...|$|R
40|$|By {{reducing}} financial {{constraints and}} income variability, remittances can increase educational attainment and thereby reduce child labor supply, {{in the context}} of imperfect financial markets. This paper aims to analyze the impact of remittances on child labor and educational outcomes in Niger. More specifically, we investigate how recipient households in Niger decide to spend this extra income with regard to the decision on sending their children to school or to work. Our methodology differs from previous ones in important respects. First, we estimate whether there are significant differences according the negative shocks occurrence. Second, the endogeneity of migration decisions complicates the analysis as it requires the identification of two separate events that are often driven by similar factors. In order to delineate the effect of remittances from migration, we focus on children residing in non-migrant households. Third, we use a Propensity Score Matching method to calculate the average treatment effects of remittances on children labor force or schooling participation decisions. We use this approach to avoid the identification problem generated by a simple comparison of households that receive remittances and households that do not. This approach requires a rich database, which is provided by the Troisième <b>enquête</b> <b>nationale</b> sur le budget et la Consommation des ménages (Niger, 2007). Indeed, with a sample size close to 4 thousand households, this survey contains information on the size of remittances received, the nature of remittances, the country where the cash transfers come from and the frequency with respect to previous year. Our findings show the positive role of remittances on schooling in every scenario selected (with or without shocks experienced). The remittances' effects on children's participation in economic activities are however much more complex and depend if the household has recently experienced a negative shock. Thus, while one of the main advantages of remittances is to diversify income sources and protect families in downturns, the use of children to work as a coping strategy is still frequent in Niger. These two mechanisms (remittance and child work) appear to be complementary. Remittances, Children time allocation, Propensity Score matching...|$|R
40|$|Background/Objectives: Food portion sizes {{have been}} {{increasing}} in industrialized countries {{and this is}} thought {{to be one of the}} risk factors of overweight. France is also facing the development of adiposity, particularly in its child population, where overweight rates are rising faster than in adults. Given this background, the objectives of the present study were, for each food category, to describe dietary intake in French children aged 3 - 11 years, and to assess the relationship between childhood overweight and portion size, adjusting for dietary energy density, physical activity and sedentary behaviour. Subjects/Methods: A representative sample of 748 French children aged 3 - 11 years was taken from the 1998 - 1999 crosssectional French INCA 1 (<b>Enquete</b> Individuelle et <b>Nationale</b> sur les Consommations Alimentaires) food consumption survey. Dietary intake was assessed using a 7 -day food record. Portion sizes were estimated for 23 food categories. Weight and height, physical activity and sedentary behaviour were reported by parents or children in questionnaires. Results: In multivariate logistic regression adjusted models, overweight in children aged 3 - 6 years was positively correlated to portion sizes of croissant-like pastries and other sweetened pastries. Conversely, portion sizes of liquid dairy products were inversely associated with overweight in children aged 7 - 11 years. Conclusions: At very young ages, the increase in overweight may be driven in part by a shift in eating patterns towards larger portion size of energy-dense and nutrient-poor foods...|$|R

Evoluciones comparativas de la educación y de la actividad femenina de 1971 a 1991. El artículo se propone medir e interpretar el progreso alcanzado en las escolaridades y en las actividades femeninas en Francia y en Alemania, países en los cuales las relaciones comparativas entre la educación y el trabajo han sido especialmente efectuados para el caso de los hombres. En base a grandes encuestas nacionales, se ponen al día los adelantos más significativos en Francia. Tanto en 1971 como en 1991, las desigualdades sexuales en todas las edades y en todos los niveles de diplomas de educación son mayores en Alemania, por eso desde el momento que se convierten en madres las mujeres alemanas, estan menos presentes en el mercado de trabajo. Estas diferencias harían volver de nuevo a una historia económica y educativa más marcada hacia lo masculino en Alemania. La preeminencia de un sistema corporatista de las formaciones y de las profesiones, en ese país, conllevaría a una más grande rigidez de la división sexual que aquella de la forma escolar y del orden alcanzado en la enseñanza general en Francia. L'article se propose de mesurer et d'interpréter la {{progression}} des scolarités et de l'activité féminines en France et en Allemagne, pays pour lesquels les comparaisons des relations entre l'éducation et le travail ont surtout porté sur les hommes. Il met au jour, sur la base de grandes <b>enquêtes</b> <b>nationales,</b> des avancées de plus grande ampleur en France. En 1971, comme en 1991, les inégalités sexuées d'éducation sont plus fortes en Allemagne, et à tous les âges et à tous les niveaux de diplôme, les femmes allemandes, dès lors qu'elles sont mères, sont moins présentes sur le marché du travail. Ces différences renverraient à une histoire économique et de l'éducation plus marquée au masculin en Allemagne. La prééminence, dans ce pays, d'un système corporatiste des formations et des professions entraînerait une plus grande rigidité de la division sexuelle que celle de la forme scolaire et du rang atteint dans l'enseignement général en France.

This paper {{measures and}} interprets {{the progression of}} school achievements and participation {{of women in the}} labor force in France and Germany. Up to now, for these countries, comparisons of the relationships between education, training and work had mostly focused on men. Based on large scale national surveys, we detect stronger advances in France. In 1971 as well as in 1991, gendered inequalities in education and training are wider in Germany. At all ages and for all education levels, German women, as soon as they become mothers, are less present on the labor market. These differences {{can be traced back to}} German economic and education history, that have been more organized for men. The importance of a corporatist occupational and educational system in this country would entail a more rigid gendered division of work than in the school system and rank achieved by women in general education in France. 1971 as well as in 1991, gendered inequalities in education and training are wider in Germany.

Catherine Marry, Annick Kieffer, Hildegard Brauns, Susanne Steinmann : Bildungs- und Erwerbsbeteiligung der Frauen im deutsch-französischen Vergleich. Der Artikel befasst sich im deutsch-französischen Vergleich mit der zunehmenden Beteiligung der Frauen im Bildungs- und Erwerbssystem. Bisherige Untersuchungen zu nationalen Unterschieden im Verhältnis von Bildung und Beschäftigung haben sich vornehmlich auf die Männer beschränkt. Der Artikel zeigt auf der Basis nationaler Arbeitskräfteerhebungen, dass die französischen Frauen von günstigeren Ausbildungs- und Arbeitsmarktbedingungen profitieren als die deutschen Frauen. Zu Beginn der 70 er und noch in den 90 er Jahren erweisen sich geschlechterspezifische Ungleichheiten im Bildungserwerb in Deutschland als stärker ausgeprägt. Dies trifft - in alien Alters- und Bildungsgruppen - auch für die Erwerbsbeteiligung zu, sobald es sich um Frauen mit Kindern handelt. Dieser Befund lässt sich auf strukturelle Besonderheiten des deutschen Bildungs- und dessen Verknüpfung mit dem Beschäftigungssystem zurückführen. Das in Deutschland vorherrschende korporatistische Ausbildungs- und Berufssystem geht in höherem Masse mit geschlechterspezifischer Segregation einher als das in Frankreich dominierende Modell schulischer Ausbildung und einer Betonung auf allgemeiner Bildung.

40|$|Objective: (1) To {{assess the}} {{prevalence}} of childhood overweight (OW) and obesity in France; (2) to examine how physical activity and sedentary behaviour {{are involved in the}} association between socioeconomic status (SES) and OW, while taking into account total energy intake. Design and subjects: Representative sample of French children aged 3 - 14 years (n= 1016) taken from the 1998 - 1999 cross-sectional French INCA (<b>Enquete</b> Individuelle et <b>Nationale</b> sur les Consommations Alimentaires) food consumption survey. Measurements: Weight and height, leisure-time physical activity (LTPA), sedentary behaviour (TV viewing and video-game use), and SES were reported by parents or children by answering questionnaires; total energy intake was assessed using a 7 -day food record. Results: In total, 15. 2 % (95 % CI: 13. 0 - 17. 6) of the children are OW (including obese), according to the IOTF (International Obesity Task Force) definition. OW is inversely associated with SES in children over 6 years of age. LTPA is negatively correlated to OW among the 3 to 5 -year-old children only, whereas sedentary behaviour is positively related to OW in childhood and adolescence. From 6 years old on, SES is inversely associated with sedentary behaviour, which consequently may partly mediate the relationship between SES and OW. Conclusion: This study confirms the association between SES, sedentary behaviour and childhood OW in France. It was performed before the launching of the French Program of Nutrition and Health (PNNS) in 2001 and will be repeated in 2006. This will contribute to monitoring both childhood OW and its main determinants at the population scale...|$|R
40|$|Individual diet {{modeling}} with {{linear programming}} recently provided evidence that plant-based products, fish, and fresh dairy products consumption should be {{increased in the}} French population to reach nutrient-based recommendations. The aim of our study was to estimate the number of portions of the different milk-based food categories fitting into nutritionally adequate diets. Starting from the diet observed for each adult in the 1999 French <b>Enquete</b> Individuelle et <b>Nationale</b> sur les Consommations Alimentaires survey (n= 1, 171), an isocaloric nutritionally adequate diet was modeled that simultaneously met {{a whole set of}} nutrient constraints (based on nutrient recommendations) while deviating the least from the observed diet, food content. Variations in weight, energy, and nutrients between observed and modeled diets were calculated for each food group (n= 7), with a focus on milk-based products (n= 4 categories). The diet optimization process increased the weights of three food groups: fruit and vegetables (+ 62 %), starchy foods (+ 37 %), and dairy products (+ 19 %). Across milk-based food categories, the optimization increased yogurts (+ 60 %) and milk (+ 17 %) and decreased cheeses (- 48 %) without change to milk desserts. Cheeses represented one out of two consumed portions of milk-based products in observed diets, whereas in modeled diets cheeses, milk, and yogurts each represented about one portion per day. Milk desserts were similar before and after optimization, at approximately one portion per week. These results confirm that a large increase in intake of plant-based products is needed. They show that rebalancing the intake of milk-based products in favor of the least energy-dense ones (ie, yogurts and milk) will help individuals in this population reach nutritional adequacy...|$|R
40|$|Sedentary {{behavior}} (SED) {{has already}} {{been identified as a}} risk factor of childhood overweight (OW) but less is known about the dietary patterns related to adiposity. Our objective was to investigate if lifestyle patterns combining overall diet and physical activity were associated with childhood OW and if they were involved in the reverse association between socioeconomic status (SES) and OW. Dietary intake was assessed using a 7 -d food record in 748 French children aged 3 - 11 y from the 1998 - 1999 cross-sectional French <b>Enquete</b> Individuelle et <b>Nationale</b> sur les Consommations Alimentaires national food consumption survey. Weight and height, leisure time physical activity, SED (television viewing), and SES were reported by parents or children by answering questionnaires. Scores for lifestyle patterns were assessed with factor analysis and their relationship with OW was explored by logistic regression analysis. Two similar lifestyle patterns were identified in children aged 3 - 6 y and 7 - 11 y: "snacking and sedentary" and "varied food and physically active. " The snacking and sedentary pattern was positively associated with OW in the youngest children (P-trend = 0. 0161) and partly mediated the negative association of SES to OW. The varied food and physically active pattern was inversely correlated with OW in the eldest children only (P-trend = 0. 0401). A third pattern called "big eaters at main meals" was derived in children aged 7 - 11 y and was positively correlated with OW (P-trend = 0. 0165). From a public health perspective, the combinations of identifiable dietary and physical activity behaviors may be useful as a basis for recommendations on preventing OW...|$|R
