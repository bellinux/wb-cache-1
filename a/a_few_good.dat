5|$|In March 2016, it was {{announced}} that Sorkin would be adapting <b>A</b> <b>Few</b> <b>Good</b> Men for a live production on NBC, slated to air in 2018.|$|E
5|$|Sorkin wrote several {{drafts of}} the script for <b>A</b> <b>Few</b> <b>Good</b> Men in his Manhattan apartment, {{learning}} the craft from a book about screenplay format. He then spent several months at the Los Angeles offices of Castle Rock, working on the script with director Rob Reiner. William Goldman (who regularly worked under contract at Castle Rock) became his mentor and helped him to adapt his stageplay into a screenplay. The movie was directed by Reiner, starred Tom Cruise, Jack Nicholson, Demi Moore and Kevin Bacon, and was produced by Brown. <b>A</b> <b>Few</b> <b>Good</b> Men was released in 1992 and was a box office success.|$|E

By visiting cities' commodity exchanges, the player can inspect what is for sale, buy and sell commodities and, ideally, turn enough profit to buy everything the colony needs.|$|R
50|$|Besides {{the musical}} group Alle-für-Alle, {{there are also}} <b>a</b> <b>few</b> very <b>good</b> guitarists.|$|R
5|$|Barrowman {{returned}} {{to the role of}} Billy Crocker in Trevor Nunn's 2003 West End revival of Anything Goes, and appeared in West End non-musical dramas, such as his role as Wyndham Brandon in Rope at the Minerva Theatre, Chichester in 1993, and he starred as Lieutenant Jack Ross opposite Rob Lowe in the 2005 production of <b>A</b> <b>Few</b> <b>Good</b> Men.|$|E
5|$|In 2005, Sorkin revised {{his play}} <b>A</b> <b>Few</b> <b>Good</b> Men for a revival at the London West End theatre, the Haymarket.

5|$|In {{the early}} 1990s, Sorkin worked under {{contract}} for Castle Rock Entertainment, Inc. He wrote the scripts for <b>A</b> <b>Few</b> <b>Good</b> Men, Malice and The American President: The three films grossed about US$400million worldwide. While writing for Castle Rock he {{became friends with}} colleagues such as William Goldman and Rob Reiner and met his future wife Julia Bingham, {{who was one of}} Castle Rock's business affairs lawyers.|$|E

50|$|The LBR {{platforms}} {{were closed}} on 3 May 1926 as passenger services were withdrawn and all services were routed via the Bow platforms. <b>A</b> <b>few</b> <b>goods</b> trains used the Blackwall route but the LBR platforms were demolished in circa 1936 and the junction simplified. The signalling was improved at thisa time {{as part of}} a major re-signalling with colour light signals from Fenchurch Street to Gas Factory Junction (east of Stepney).|$|R
5|$|Sorkin got the {{inspiration}} {{to write his}} next play, a courtroom drama called <b>A</b> <b>Few</b> <b>Good</b> Men, from a phone conversation with his sister Deborah (who had graduated from Boston University Law School and {{signed up for a}} three-year stint with the U.S. Navy Judge Advocate General's Corps). Deborah told Sorkin {{that she was going to}} Guantanamo Bay to defend a group of Marines who came close to killing a fellow Marine in a hazing ordered by a superior officer. Sorkin took that information and wrote much of his story on cocktail napkins while bartending at the Palace Theatre. He and his roommates had purchased a Macintosh 512K so when he returned home he would empty his pockets of the cocktail napkins and type them into the computer, forming a basis from which he wrote many drafts for <b>A</b> <b>Few</b> <b>Good</b> Men.|$|E

Only <b>A</b> <b>Few</b> <b>Good</b> Men (6th), Unforgiven (17th), Malcolm X (30th) and Scent of a Woman (38th) were nominated for directing, acting, screenwriting, or Best Picture.

50|$|On the {{international}} stage Universidad de Chile have had <b>a</b> <b>few</b> of <b>good</b> runs in Copa Libertadores, reaching the semi-finals in 1970, 1996, 2010, and 2012.|$|R
50|$|In the UK, {{following}} the privatisation of main-line railways, {{the line between}} traditionally not-for-profit heritage railways and for-profit branch lines may appear to have blurred. The Romney, Hythe and Dymchurch Railway {{is an example of}} a commercial line run partly as a heritage operation and partly to provide local transportation. The Severn Valley Railway has even operated <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>goods</b> trains on <b>a</b> commercial basis. In addition, a number of heritage railway lines are regularly used by commercial freight operators.|$|R

5|$|Sorkin {{continued}} writing Making Movies and in 1990 it debuted Off-Broadway at the Promenade Theatre, {{produced by}} John A. McQuiggan, and again directed by Don Scardino. Meanwhile, David Brown was producing a few projects at TriStar Pictures {{and tried to}} interest them in making <b>A</b> <b>Few</b> <b>Good</b> Men into a film but his proposal was declined {{due to the lack}} of star actor involvement. Brown later got a call from Alan Horn at Castle Rock Entertainment who was anxious to make the film. Rob Reiner, a Castle Rock producing partner, opted to direct it.|$|E
5|$|In 1991, Demi Moore was {{a budding}} A-list film star {{who had been}} married to Bruce Willis since 1987. The couple had had their first child Rumer Willis in 1988, and they had hired three photographers for an {{audience}} of six friends for the delivery. In 1990, she had starred in that year's highest-grossing film, Ghost, for which she was paid $750,000, and she had earned $2.5 million for 1991 roles in The Butcher's Wife and Mortal Thoughts. Following the photo, she would earn $3 million for her 1992 role in <b>A</b> <b>Few</b> <b>Good</b> Men and $5 million apiece for roles in Indecent Proposal (1993), Disclosure (1994) and The Scarlet Letter (1995).|$|E
5|$|The Browns {{won every}} {{game in the}} 1948 season, a feat that went {{unmatched}} until the Miami Dolphins (coached by Brown disciple Don Shula) did it in 1972. Cleveland then won the AAFC championship {{for the fourth time}} in a row in 1949. By then, however, the league was struggling for survival, {{due in part to the}} Browns' dominance. Attendance at games dwindled in 1948 and 1949 as fans lost interest in lopsided victories, and at the end of the 1949 season the AAFC dissolved. Three of its teams, the San Francisco 49ers, the Baltimore Colts and the Browns, merged into the NFL. The Browns picked up <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>good</b> former AAFC players from other teams, including offensive guard Abe Gibron and defensive end Len Ford, but some observers saw Brown's team as the lone standout in an otherwise minor league.|$|E

In the 2009 timetable it will {{be worked}} hourly by Regionalbahn trains from Brunswick via Seeseon to Herzberg am Harz, and every two hours by the Regionalbahn from Bad Harzburg via Seesen to Kreiensen (with extra services at peak times). Normally Lint multiples (DB Class 648) are used that are stabled by Alstom at Salzgitter. From a fares perspective, the line from Brunswick to Seesen forms part of the Brunswick Region Fare Zone and, from Seesen to Kreiensen, the Lower Saxony Transport Network.|$|R
5|$|After {{mismanagement}} {{during the}} late 1980s, Hibs were {{on the brink of}} financial ruin in 1990. Wallace Mercer, the chairman of Hearts, proposed a merger of the two clubs, but the Hibs fans believed that the proposal was more like a hostile takeover. They formed the Hands off Hibs group to campaign for the continued existence of the club. This succeeded when a prominent local businessman, Kwik-Fit owner Sir Tom Farmer, acquired a controlling interest in Hibs. The fans were able to persuade Farmer to take control {{despite the fact that he}} had no great interest in football. Farmer was persuaded in part by the fact that a relative of his had been involved in the rescue of Hibs from financial ruin in the early 1890s. After the attempted takeover by Mercer, Hibs had <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>good</b> years in the early 1990s, winning the 1991 Scottish League Cup Final and finishing in the top five in the league in 1993, 1994 and 1995. Soon after Alex McLeish was appointed as manager in 1998, Hibs were relegated to the First Division, but immediately won promotion back to the SPL in 1999.|$|E
