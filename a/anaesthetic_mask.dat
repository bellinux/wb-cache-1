40|$|BACKGROUND: Factors such as age, sex, {{behaviour}} problems, fears, earlier traumatic hospital {{events and}} reactions to vaccination were assessed together with behaviour observed before premedication {{in order to}} evaluate their importance in predicting response to the anaesthetic process. The anaesthetic process was divided into four endpoints; compliance when given premedication, sedation, compliance during needle insertion or when an <b>anaesthetic</b> <b>mask</b> {{was put in place}} and behaviour when put to sleep. METHODS: A total of 102 children who were undergoing day-stay surgery and overnight stay surgery were video-filmed during premedication and anaesthetic induction. Before premedication the children and parents answered questionnaires about behaviour [Preschool Behaviour Check List (PBCL) ] and fears [Fears Survey Schedule for Children-Revised (FSSC-R) ]. The films were analysed to assess behaviour before and after premedication and during induction of anaesthesia. A semistructured interview was conducted with the parents during the time the children were asleep. RESULTS: There was a significantly higher odds ratio for noncompliant behaviour during premedication if the child placed itself in the parent's lap or near the parent or had previously experienced traumatic hospital events. The odds ratio for not being sedated by premedication was higher if compliance was low when premedication was given or the child had experienced a traumatic hospital event in the past. A high odds ratio for noncompliant behaviour during venous access or placement of an <b>anaesthetic</b> <b>mask</b> was seen if the child was not sedated or the child had had a negative reaction when vaccinated. The odds ratio for falling asleep in an anxious or upset state was higher if the child had shown noncompliant behaviour during premedication, had not been sedated or had shown noncompliant behaviour during venous access or facemask placement. CONCLUSIONS: The overall most important factor that predicts noncompliant behaviour and a distressed state in the child during the anaesthetic process was the experience of earlier traumatic hospital events including negative reaction to vaccination. All elements of the process are important in determining what will happen and all steps will influence how the child reacts when put to sleep...|$|E
40|$|Background: Until recently, {{midazolam}} sedation was routinely {{used in our}} {{institution for}} bone marrow aspirates and lumbar punctures in children with cancer. It has been perceived by many doctors and nurses as being well tolerated by children and their families. Aim: To compare the efficacy of inhalational general anaesthesia and midazolam sedation for these procedures. Methods: A total of 96 children with neoplastic disorders, who received either inhalational general anaesthesia with sevoflurane, nitrous oxide, and oxygen (GA) or sedation with oral or nasal midazolam (SED) {{as part of their}} routine preparation for procedures were studied. The experiences of these childen were examined during their current procedure and during their first ever procedure. Main outcome measures were the degree of physical restraint used on the child, and the levels of distress and pain experienced by the child during the current procedure and during the first procedure. The family‘s preference for future procedures was also determined. Results: During 102 procedures under GA, restraint was needed on four occasions (4 %) when the <b>anaesthetic</b> <b>mask</b> was first applied, minimal pain was reported, and children were reported as distressed about 25 % of the time. During 80 SED procedures, restraint was required in 94 %, firm restraint was required in 66 %, the child could not be restrained in 14 %, median pain score was 6 (scale 0 (no pain) to 6 (maximum pain)), and 90 % of the parents reported distress in their child. Ninety per cent of families wanted GA for future procedures. Many families reported dissatisfaction with the sedation regime and raised concerns about the restraint used on their child. Conclusions: This general anaesthetic regime minimised the need for restraint and was associated with low levels of pain and distress. The sedation regime, by contrast, was much less effective. There was a significant disparity between the perceptions of health professionals and those of families with respect to how children coped with painful procedures. <br /...|$|E
40|$|Meta Isæus-Berlin at Skissernas museum Many {{visitors}} will surely remember Ett vattenhem (A Water Home), five strikingly ambiguous furnished rooms {{set out on}} a low podium {{in the middle of the}} main walkway at the Bo 01 Housing Fair in Malmö in 2001. The Hall and the Bathroom, at opposite ends of the long and narrow, windowless pavilion, were open to the world and visible from outside. The Bathroom was probably the part of the installation that received most attention; an open room like a life-size doll’s house. The tiled but roofless room contained all the usual bathroom fittings including a mirror, hooks, toilet-paper holder, lamps. There was water here too, far too much of it in fact, though it did not come just from the taps but seemed to be pushed up from below, from the drains, and to run in all directions from the overflowing vessels: the toilet, the basin and the bathtub. It fizzed and foamed and bubbled up as though from a volcanic spring and heaved itself, indeed it poured itself over everything, just as thick and wet as when one spills a bucket of water onto the floor. Like a torrential flood it hurried across the tiled floor and down over a gently rounded step out into a channel that ended in an opening leading to the depths of the earth. The viewers’smiles of recognition assumed a lingering undertone: what was it that one was really witnessing? The Dining Room, a windowless space in the depths of the installation, was a singularly chilly and dismal room with a lean and lonely, dimly illuminated chandelier above a dreary, oval dining table veneered in some dark wood with a cold chair at each end of the table and the ceiling as oppressively low as in a caravan. The tabletop was covered with something that might have been a sunken sheet of glass but was, in fact, ice. Two dinner settings were frozen solidly into the tabletop. The dark, heavy and wet carpet gave off puffs of frozen breath, a white fuzz that swept slowly across the floor down there in the darkness. There was a tall, fateful looking cupboard in the background, broody with aggression and guilt like a Kienholz tableau. Here there is a painful contrast, depicted in the state of the furniture, between the concept of the Swedish word 'hem' (home) as a metaphor for security and the total negation of this security expressed in the substantivized adjective of this word, 'hemsk' (terrific). Like looking into a hellish relationship where everything is reflected in the state of the furniture. In the Living Room the velvet upholstery was seething. Above the soft pile of the velvet, little clouds of cold steam sailed through the atmosphere like an elfish dance at dawn. Perhaps the furniture was giving off this cold, humid mist because it was so replete; a mist that was like old tobacco smoke in a smoking carriage on a train, or some sort of foam from a fire extinguisher that covered everything like a psychoactive drug, threatening to suffocate or drown it. Perhaps it was merely an abandoned summer room in a garden cottage where the furniture was sweating cold humidity as the snow melted outside. And a rug that was as saturated as only a Wilton rug can be. * Characteristic of several of Meta Isæus-Berlin’s installations is the fact that it is sometimes only after a while that one becomes aware that they are not a part of the room’s ‘normal’ furnishings. It appears as though she has taken something that already exists; which is not the case at all. She has produced a highly conscious stage set but a stage set that seems ‘real’. As public art this has a particularly powerful effect. In Meta Isæus-Berlin’s installations the mental expression of everyday objects – something often overlooked – and the social masque that they form part of emerge clearly alongside their trivial and more practically oriented existence. These intense emotional characteristics can seem like the visual, intricate remains of diffuse memories or else they are the heralds of dark experiences: the items were present themselves, they have been shaped, permeated and animated by a social and mental cosmos (or chaos) which, in due course, has sunk into these things where they continue their lives. Whatever it is, henceforth, that they express and hand on can consist of an entire instrumentarium of items that, quite simply, is experienced as the present, physical ‘reality’. Meta Isæus-Berlin employs these objects as a rich, artistic language with deep roots accumulated in many layers down in our consciousness and our memory. The visual language of the objects is recognizable in our own bodily experiences and it immediately strikes us since the objects speak the same wordless language as that of our bodies. The objects in the installations are, like so-called ‘ordinary’ objects, simultaneously active on a number of different levels. This may be a matter of furnishing items that, in everyday life, are often enslaved by being required to be practical or serviceable aids that are subservient to the arbitrariness of the commissioner and constructor. Such objects can have become fully incorporated into their task and have become deformed accordingly and can, over time, almost completely have lost their memory, that is, other memories. What is specific to her artistic use is that these levels can be presented as simultaneous, indistinguishable. They express, illuminate and reinforce each other. In an everyday context our consciousness of the technical functions often displaces the object’s visual expression so that, on many occasions, we are not conscious of the enormous, latent, visual, expressive force that the objects, as materialized language, can have in our day-dreaming memory and consciousness. The exhibition includes a number of sketches and models for Ett vattenhem and for Återblickens transparens (2004), an installation of delicately transparent furniture made of the thinnest organza; hardly materialized at all. The furniture is suspended on thin wires and it moves in slow motion like gentle sounds, diaphanous clouds; yet with slightly threatening unpredictability. The solidity of the furniture has been dissolved. The items are transparent and weightless like certain very old people whose bodies consist mainly of memories and traces of experience. Meta Isæus-Berlin’s sketches, in their intense simplicity, are as expressive as comic strips. The furniture exhibits a forceful integrity and is animated to such an extent that it becomes almost like pictures of people, of human individuals. Some of these characteristics are also apparent in the large paintings that Meta Isæus-Berlin has produced in the last few years. In several ways they would seem to mark a turning point in her art. A characteristic difference is that while the installations work in the public sphere, the paintings inescapably refer to more private contexts. There is often an obvious narrative and dramatic aspect with human figures that interact very expressively; which may well remind one of Munch’s figures though viewed, perhaps, through the freer composition and use of colour typical of the sixties. I find myself most strongly moved by those aspects of the paintings that have most in common with the installations. Where people, temporarily or permanently, have gone from the room but have left behind them a forceful impression in the objects; these human casts for charged memories that then continue to act out human distress on their own. Consider, for example, the painting Implosion with a room whose narrow set has been taken over by so-called "white goods" to such an extent that there is no floor left. Or the hotel beds all pushed together in some petit-bourgeois logistics in front of an overwhelming arrangement of curtains in Varför gjorde de så? [Why did they do that?] Or the row of furniture covered with cloth like an <b>anaesthetic</b> <b>mask</b> in Förberedelse [Preparations] while the walls and the carpet are drowned by slow trickles of diluted paint...|$|E
25|$|At the inquest into Voss's {{death at}} least one witness, his estranged brother, {{accused him of being}} culpable, {{claiming}} that Voss's business trips to the continent to buy <b>anaesthetics</b> <b>masked</b> a lucrative sideline in drug smuggling. This rumour had followed Voss for some time before his death and was alleged to {{have been the subject of}} investigations by the Metropolitan Police. Voss, according to his brother, was travelling aboard the aircraft together with his niece, and they were aware that the authorities were on to them. Voss sought to escape from the authorities by destroying the aircraft using various flammable substances to which his work gave him easy access and then bailing out in the confused circumstances, hoping that in the aftermath no one would notice one less body than there should be. An autopsy showed that, other than some minor burns, Voss was unharmed before he exited the aircraft. The inquest jury eventually returned an open verdict – indicating that they believed his death may not have been accidental, but that they were unable, on the evidence before them, to come to a definite conclusion – rather than the verdict of accidental death the coroner attempted to direct them towards.|$|R
40|$|AbstractObjectivesTo {{evaluate}} {{the impact of}} an infection control educational programme in anaesthetic practice on the clinical performance of the personnel working in anaesthetic field and anaesthetic work place bacterial contamination. MethodsThis study was conducting on 35 personnel involved in 500 operations over two and half months. Their compliance towards handling of anaesthetic equipments, wearing of protective tools and hand hygiene was evaluated using a 13 items check list pre and post delivering of an educational infection control programme (intervention). Of 500 operations 300 were randomly selected for evaluation of bacterial contamination. Two swabs were taken from anaesthetic place before induction of general anaesthesia (T 0) and 30 min intraoperative (T 1) pre and post intervention. Another swab was taking from anaesthetists’ hands 15 min after induction of anaesthesia (T 2). ResultsThe intervention programme influenced positively the attitude of junior anaesthetists and nurses regarding {{the proper use of}} protective tools, anaesthetic equipments and hand hygiene. Senior anaesthestists’ compliance with hand hygiene, frequency use of gloves and anaesthetic filter did not change after intervention. But their attitude towards handling of laryngoscope, <b>anaesthetic</b> face <b>mask</b> and catheter for suction improved after intervention. The adherence of housekeepers to hand hygiene, frequency of gloves use and anaesthetic equipments’ disinfection improved significantly after intervention. Ninety-two (63 %) swabs were positive for bacteria at T 0 before intervention. They reduced to 9 (6. 3 %) positive swabs after intervention. The number of positive swabs at T 1 was 121 (82. 9 %) before intervention, reduced to 68 (47. 2 %) after intervention. One hundred and eight (74 %) swabs from hands of anaesthetists were positive for bacteria before intervention. They lowered significantly to 55 (38. 2 %) after intervention. Bacterial cross infection between anaesthetic machine and anaesthetists’ hands existed pre and post intervention. In conclusion, infection control programme enhanced personnel clinical compliance and reduced bacterial contamination in anaesthetic place...|$|R
40|$|Backgound and {{objective}} A postal {{survey was conducted}} in order to investigate current practice in airway management amongst Dutch anaesthetists and to investigate the role of recent training {{and the role of}} an 'Access to the Airway' airway management course. Methods A questionnaire containing 27 questions was sent to all practising anaesthetists in The Netherlands. Questionnaires were returned anonymously and were analysed using the Pearson chi (2) -test (P < 0. 05) with the SPSS(R) version 8. 0 statistical software program. Results The response rate was 42 %. Of the respondents, 78 % claim often or always to assess the expected degree of difficulty in tracheal intubation as part of routine preoperative assessment. The American Society of Anesthesiologist's Difficult Airway Algorithm was used by 19 % of respondents. A wide variety of airway management techniques is being used. In 36 % of all general <b>anaesthetics</b> a laryngeal <b>mask</b> airway is used. In 1. 1 % of all general anaesthetics tracheal intubation is performed with the flexible fibrescope. Conclusions Dutch anaesthetists, who commenced anaesthetic training after 1988, and those who attended the airway management course 'Access to the Airway' are significantly more likely to follow the American Society of Anesthesiologist's Difficult Airway Algorithm and to use adjunctive techniques for airway management...|$|R
