5|$|Although USC coach Pete Carroll {{and many}} scouts {{considered}} him too inexperienced, Sanchez announced {{his intention to}} enter the 2009 NFL Draft. He was selected by the Jets after they traded up with the Cleveland Browns, and was named the starting quarterback {{prior to the start}} of the season. Despite a subpar performance, Sanchez led the Jets to the <b>AFC</b> <b>Championship</b> <b>Game,</b> a losing effort to the Indianapolis Colts, becoming the fourth rookie quarterback in NFL history to win his first playoff game and the second to win two playoff games. In his second season, Sanchez continued to develop and led the Jets to the playoffs and the team's second consecutive <b>AFC</b> <b>Championship</b> <b>Game</b> where they narrowly lost to the Pittsburgh Steelers, 24–19. With the win over the New England Patriots the week prior, Sanchez tied four other quarterbacks for the second most post-season road victories by a quarterback in NFL history. In leading the Jets to two consecutive conference championships, Sanchez joined quarterback Ben Roethlisberger as the only two quarterbacks in NFL history to reach the conference championship in their first two seasons in the league.|$|E
5|$|Chicago and Indianapolis {{are the two}} closest cities, geographically, to {{ever play}} in a Super Bowl; at 182 miles (293km) apart (connected by a route that is mostly Interstate 65), they are {{slightly}} closer than New York and Baltimore, whose teams played each other at III (207 miles) and XXXV (188 miles). This prompted Colts coach Tony Dungy to joke to Jim Nantz, {{at the end of}} the <b>AFC</b> <b>Championship</b> <b>game,</b> that the two teams should split the difference and play the game in Fort Wayne.|$|E
5|$|Indianapolis {{started out}} the season winning their first nine games, {{but ended up}} losing four of their next seven and {{finished}} with a 12–4 record, giving them the #3 playoff seed.

5|$|The Steelers {{notified}} the Pittsburgh Stadium Authority in December 2010 of {{their intention to}} add up to 4,000 seats to the lower {{southern end of the}} stadium. The plan would increase seating up to 69,050 as soon as the 2012 NFL season. Seating was added in that section for the 2011 NHL Winter Classic, which had an attendance of 68,111. The temporary seating was left in place for the 2010–11 NFL playoffs, with the <b>AFC</b> <b>Championship</b> <b>game</b> on January 23 having a record attendance of 66,662.|$|E
5|$|Following the merger, the Jets {{fell into}} mediocrity; Namath was dogged by {{injuries}} {{through much of}} his later career. In 1981, New York qualified for {{the playoffs for the}} first time in the post-Namath era. They reached the <b>AFC</b> <b>Championship</b> <b>Game</b> in 1982; they were defeated on a rain-soaked Orange Bowl field by the Miami Dolphins. Beginning with the 1984 season, the team played in New Jersey's Giants Stadium. The team started the 1986 season with a 10–1 record, but the injury-plagued Jets lost their last five regular season games and relinquished a ten-point fourth quarter lead to lose in double overtime to the Cleveland Browns in the playoffs.|$|E
5|$|In the Wild Card Round, the sixth-seeded Jets {{beat the}} AFC South {{champion}} and third-seeded Colts 17–16 on January 8, 2011, at the Colts' home field, Lucas Oil Stadium, {{to qualify for}} the Divisional Playoffs. The following week, on January 16, they defeated the AFC East champion and first-seeded Patriots 28–21, ending New England's eight-game winning streak. The victory made the Jets the first team to win back-to-back road playoff games in consecutive seasons, and qualified them to advance to the <b>AFC</b> <b>Championship</b> <b>Game</b> for the second consecutive season, where they lost {{on the road to the}} AFC North champion Pittsburgh Steelers 24–19.|$|E
50|$|As a player, Mauck's career spanned 13 seasons from 1969-1981. He {{played in}} 166 career regular-season games, {{including}} {{a stretch of}} 156 in a row.

However, Fouts and the Chargers lost both <b>AFC</b> <b>Championship</b> <b>Games</b> {{in which they}} played.|$|R
5000|$|During Wiedmeier’s {{time with}} the Dolphins (1981-2009), the team ranked fourth in the NFL in wins with a 260-195-1 regular-season record, and {{appeared}} in 27 postseason games.

5|$|Ryan was {{disappointed}} by {{his failure to}} obtain a head coaching job, but he agreed to return to Baltimore {{under the direction of}} Harbaugh, who retained Ryan as defensive coordinator and promoted him to assistant head coach. In 2008, Ryan's final year with the team, the defense was ranked second overall in the NFL. The Ravens lost by a score of 23-14 in the <b>AFC</b> <b>Championship</b> <b>Game</b> against the Pittsburgh Steelers. Ryan's nine-year tenure with the Ravens, during which the defense never ranked lower than sixth overall in the NFL, concluded an hour later when he accepted the head coaching position with the New York Jets.|$|E
5|$|The Super Bowl is {{an annual}} American {{football}} game that determines {{the champion of}} the National Football League (NFL). The game culminates a season that begins in the previous calendar year, and is {{the conclusion of the}} NFL playoffs. The contest is held in an American city, chosen three to four years beforehand, usually at warm-weather sites or domed stadiums. Since January 1971, the winner of the American Football Conference (<b>AFC)</b> <b>Championship</b> <b>Game</b> has faced the winner of the National Football Conference (NFC) Championship Game in the culmination of the NFL playoffs.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} week, {{the team}} played the Bengals in the playoffs, {{this time at}} Paul Brown Stadium, and secured a 24–14 victory over Cincinnati. That victory meant that the Jets would travel to San Diego to play the Chargers, who had won eleven straight games, in the divisional round. Strong performances by Sanchez, running back Shonn Greene, and the Jets defense helped the Jets to a 17–14 win over the Chargers. New York played the top-seeded Colts in the <b>AFC</b> <b>Championship</b> <b>Game</b> and secured an early 17–6 lead. They had little luck {{in the second half}} as the Colts went to the Super Bowl with a 30–17 victory.|$|E
50|$|The NFL {{returned}} to Baltimore when the former Cleveland Browns moved to Baltimore {{to become the}} Baltimore Ravens in 1996.

5|$|The win set {{up another}} rematch for the Giants, {{this time in}} the Super Bowl against the Buffalo Bills. Throughout the 1990 season, the Bills' {{emergence}} as a championship caliber team {{had been one of the}} largest storylines. The Bills had a cutting edge, no-huddle offense, led by head coach Marv Levy, quarterback Jim Kelly, running back Thurman Thomas, wide receiver Andre Reed and an offensive line led by Kent Hull. They had also recorded a 13–3 record during the 1990 season, culminating with a 51–3 victory over the Los Angeles Raiders in the <b>AFC</b> <b>Championship</b> <b>game.</b> Heading into the game the Bills were installed as seven point favorites.|$|E
5|$|After a brief search, Ernie Accorsi hired Tom Coughlin, a {{one-time}} assistant of former Giants' coach Bill Parcells, {{to be the}} Giants new head coach. Coughlin had been the inaugural {{head coach of the}} Jacksonville Jaguars, and led them to the <b>AFC</b> <b>championship</b> <b>game</b> twice. He became the 16th head coach in franchise history. His stark, disciplinarian methods contrasted with the lax style employed by the departed Fassel. The Giants decided that their primary need was a franchise quarterback. Accorsi—who had coveted John Elway when he was Colts general manager in 1983—saw University of Mississippi quarterback Eli Manning as a similar talent. Manning's brother Peyton, and his father Archie, had already established successful careers as NFL quarterbacks. Though Accorsi wanted Manning, and Manning wanted to play in New York, Accorsi was unable to reach a deal to trade up to acquire him with the San Diego Chargers, who then used the first pick on Manning.|$|E
5|$|After the Colts {{left the}} AFC East in 2002, {{they first met}} on November 30, 2003, in a 38–34 Patriots win decided on a last-second goal line stand by the Patriots. The Colts broke a six-game Patriot winning streak in the rivalry in November 2005, then won twice in 2006; in the <b>AFC</b> <b>Championship</b> <b>Game</b> the Colts erased a 21–6 halftime lead; the game lead tied or changed seven times {{in the second half}} before a late {{touchdown}} led to a 38–34 Colts win. The November 4, 2007, meeting involved both teams being unbeaten to that point; the 8–0 Patriots and the 7–0 Colts. The Patriots rallied to win 24–20. The Colts won again in 2008 and then erased a large Patriots lead in 2009's 4th and 2 game. Manning's final meeting with the Patriots as a Colt came in November 2010; a late interception sealed a 31–28 Patriots win.|$|E
50|$|In 2002, The Sporting News falsely {{reported}} that Bell correctly {{predicted that the}} New England Patriots would beat the St. Louis Rams in Super Bowl XXXVI, 20 to 17 in a celebrity survey conducted just before the game. In actuality, the article was written after the NFC and <b>AFC</b> <b>championship</b> <b>games.</b> Bell correctly guessed the score, but the teams were already decided.|$|R
2500|$|Eventually, the AFC teams {{caught and}} passed the NFC during the mid- to late-1970s.
