This offers potential financial benefit through a reduction in length of stay. This study retrospectively reviewed 98 anterior approach and 69 posterior <b>approach</b> <b>THA</b> cases (N = 167) to compare perioperative outcomes and cost-effectiveness. MethodsPatients who underwent anterior <b>approach</b> <b>THA</b> were discharged sooner than those who underwent posterior <b>approach</b> <b>THA.</b> ResultsThe anterior <b>approach</b> was also less expensive per patient than {{the posterior}} approach. Overall, differences in perioperative outcomes between these <b>approaches</b> to <b>THA</b> are less robust than previously reported.

40|$|Splatting is {{a volume}} {{rendering}} technique that projects and accumulates voxels onto the screen. It {{is able to}} incorporate a variety of reconstruction kernels without extra computational overhead, as well as reduce computational and storage costs using a sparse volume representation. Previous splatting algorithms suffered from artifacts because they incorrectly separate volume reconstruction and volume integration. The IASB (Image-Aligned Sheet-Based) splatting overcomes these problems by accumulating voxels onto sheets aligned to be parallel with the image plane. In addition, it introduces a novel approach for splatting to cull occluded voxels using an opacity map, called an occlusion map, that provides a substantial speedup in serial implementations. Parallel approaches to volume rendering are able to overcome the enormous amount of computation required. We present a parallel solution to the IASB splatting <b>approach</b> <b>tha...</b>|$|R

Of course, we feel it is imperative to provide oral iso-tretinoin to our patients in the safest manner possible.

The rover must maintain lock on the target while traversing rough terrain and avoiding obstacles without the need for communication with Earth. Among the challenges of tracking targets from a rover are the large changes in the appearance and shape of the selected target as the rover approaches it, the limited frame rate at which images can be acquired and processed, and the sudden changes in camera pointing as the rover goes over rocky terrain.

However, most of the literature can be criticised for having assumptions that are quite unrealistic for faces extracted from surveillance contexts.

40|$|Abstract. Experimentation is {{fundamental}} {{to the advancement of}} science, whether one is interested in studying the neuronal basis of a sensory process in cognitive neuroscience or assessing the efficacy of a new drug in clinical trials. Adaptive methodologies in experimentation, in which the information learned from each experiment is used to inform subsequent experiments, are particularly attractive because they can have the potential to reduce the time required for data collection while simultaneously increasing the informativeness of the knowledge learned in the experiment. More concretely, the problem to be solved in adaptive sequential design optimization for model discrimination is to identify an experimental design under which one can infer the underlying model, among a set of candidate models of interest, in the fewest possible steps. This problem is challenging because of the many, sometimes arbitrary, choices that must be made when designing an experiment. Nevertheless, it is generally possible to find a design that is optimal in a defined sense.

Preliminary work has been done on planning the excavator’s motions using a script-based approach, which takes advantage of the fact that the excavator’s motions are very similar for each bucket load, but the kinematic details can change due to changes in digging, dumping, and truck locations. Currently these kinematic details, also known as the script parameters, are computed using inverse kinematics, simple machine models, heuristics, and “magic ” numbers which need to be adjusted from time to time.
