40|$|Introduction The {{interaction}} of floating bodies and water waves {{is a much}} investigated subject. Large objects on the water surface reflect and scatter waves. If the wavelength is much longer than the dimension of the object, the wavefield is little modified by the body and wave di#raction is negligible. The object is then passively driven by the waves. Under the same condition viscous e#ects can be neglected and the problem can be linearised if the wave amplitude is small compared to the wavelength. These assumptions apply to many applications such as the e#ect of water waves on small ice floes. Rumer, Crisman & Wake (4) derived <b>a</b> one-dimensional <b>slope</b> <b>sliding</b> model for ice transport in the Great Lakes.

40|$|Landslides {{triggered}} by rainfall {{are one of}} the most common causes of disaster in tropical regions, characterized by having deep weathering soil profiles, steep slopes and high-intensity storms. The increasing number of landslides during wet season evidences the close relationship between hydro-climatic conditions as a triggering factor for the occurrence of landslides. In addition, the type of vegetation covering the slope affects the soil shear strength by the roots reinforcement, plants weight and changes in soil moisture due to transpiration and interception. This paper proposes a probabilistic methodology to study the slope stability on the long-term, considering different hydro-climatic conditions and the effect of vegetation cover in the soil moisture. The ecohydrological model developed by Rodríguez-Iturbe et al. [1] was used to determine the boundary conditions of the problem. To generate the pore pressure field, the flow equation was solved using the Finite Element Method and Finite Differences Method. Finally, the Limit Equilibrium Method was used to find the Factor of Safety. The stability of <b>a</b> hypothetical <b>slope</b> under certain hydro-climatic conditions and two types of vegetation was evaluated. The analysis showed that it is more likely that <b>a</b> grass-covered <b>slope</b> <b>slides</b> than <b>a</b> tree-covered <b>slope,</b> and that the average FS of the slope during wet and dry season is very similar, but the FS dispersion is higher when the probability and intensity of rainfall events increases...|$|R

40|$|International audienceWhereas in {{previous}} analogue experiments on gravitational spreading and gliding, detachment occurred on a ductile layer, {{we have used}} a relatively new technique of injecting compressed air into sand packs so as to simulate the effects of fluid overpressures in sedimentary strata and to trigger slope instabilities. In our experiments, the governing equations yield scales for dimensions, stresses and fluid pressure. However, the more transitory phenomena of production and decrease of overpressure cannot be suitably scaled. By using layers of differing permeability, we are able to produce sharp detachments in models made of sand alone. The experiments involve gravity spreading or gravity gliding. In gravity spreading, propagation of the detachment and of extensional deformation depends on the fluid pressure. For medium values of fluid overpressure, normal faults are closely spaced, numerous and bound rotated blocks. They propagate progressively {{toward the back of the}} model. For the highest pressures, the deformation propagates very fast and faults bound non-rotated blocks, which slide on an efficient basal detachment. Fault dips are also controlled by fluid pressure and by frictional resistance at the base. To model gravitational gliding required an apparatus with a more complex system of air injection. We did a series of experiments using injection windows of various lengths and compared the results with predictions from a quasi- 3 D analytical model of sliding. In contrast with predictions for <b>an</b> infinite <b>slope,</b> <b>sliding</b> depends on (1) the fluid overpressure on the detachment, (2) the fluid overpressure in the body of the sliding sheet, and (3) the shape of the detachment surface. In particular, we show that frictional resistance at the lower edge is a primary control on the dynamics of gliding...|$|R

A certain area of the Laoshan Mountain in Nanjing, Jiangsu Province, in China was chosen for experimental study, and the <b>slope</b> <b>sliding</b> and debris flow detection system was utilized.

For the steep <b>slope,</b> <b>slope</b> <b>sliding</b> first occurs on the upper slope surface under heavy rainfall and further develops along the top platform and lower slope surface, while under weak rainfall the soil moisture content at {{the lower part of the}} slope first increases because of the high runoff velocity, meaning that failure occurring there is more serious.

40|$|Abstract Mass wasting processes, like slope failures, on {{the margins}} of dam reservoirs, lakes, bays and oceans may {{generate}} large water waves that can produce disasters due to flooding over the banks, run up along the shoreline and overtopping dam crests. Therefore, the study of slope failures, the subsequent generation of impulse waves and their consequences are of paramount importance for safety. In this paper the generation and propagation of water waves in reservoirs induced by landslides and their impact on banks were investigated by means of a laboratory study carried out at University of Coimbra wave channel, in a flume measuring 12. 0 m ? 1. 5 m ? 1. 0 m (L ?

The study considered the sliding of calcareous blocks over <b>a</b> <b>sliding</b> <b>slope</b> bank into the reservoir, the generation of impulse waves, their propagation in the reservoir and their impact on the downstream bank. A number of waves were generated by different fallings of calcareous blocks, considering different volumes, <b>sliding</b> <b>slopes,</b> initial positions and reservoir depths. All fallings were recorded by video-camera and the results were processed afterwards to obtain the time history of the falling. The water surface variations due to transient waves were measured at five gauges placed between the banks. The waves overtopping and breaking on the downstream bank were also filmed using a video camera, and the hydrodynamic forces on this bank were also measured using four pressure transducers.

An extensive range of previously undiscovered features including marginal plateaus, linear rills, ridges and gullies, canyon systems, as well as slides and slumps were identified. Gravity cores (5. 65 m and 3. 64 m long) taken in the ‘Upper Slope Slide’ (25 km 2 in area, 200 - 300 m thick), and the ‘Middle Slope Slide’ (11 km 2 in area, 100 - 150 m thick) indicate the slide scars contain drapes of Pleistocene to Recent hemipelagic mud. Shorter gravity cores (1. 33 m and 0. 43 m long) taken adjacent to both slides terminated in stiff muds of upper Pliocene to lower Pleistocene age (Upper <b>Slope</b> <b>Slide),</b> and upper Miocene to lower Pliocene age (Middle <b>Slope</b> <b>Slide).</b> This unique pattern shows that the sediment is being accumulated and protected inside the slide hollows, while being actively removed from the exposed adjacent slopes, most likely by abrasion. Biostratigraphic ages determined for the basal material demonstrate that the seafloor surfaces at both sites are effectively erosional unconformities. The basal, stiff sediments on the upper slope was deposited between 2 and 2. 5 Ma BP; this material was scoured and then buried beneath a 1 m thick sediment drape at 0. 45 Ma BP. Sediments exposed on the seafloor adjacent to the Middle <b>Slope</b> <b>Slide</b> were dated at around 6 - 8. 5 Ma BP.
