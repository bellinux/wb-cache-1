Seven percent of <b>Americans</b> <b>who</b> {{have heard of the}} books have a negative view of them, with 52 percent having a positive opinion and the remaining 41 percent unsure. This compares with 33 percent of <b>Americans</b> <b>who</b> identify themselves as Evangelical and 39 percent who take the Bible literally.|$|E

5|$|In {{the next}} decades, there was {{pressure}} from <b>Americans</b> <b>who</b> wanted {{to exploit the}} mineral and timber resources of Ojibwa country, and the US government sought to acquire control of the territory through treaties. The Treaties of 1837 and 1842 covered La Pointe and territories held by other bands over which Buffalo held considerable influence.

5|$|Long {{before the}} first incarcerees arrived in March 1942, Manzanar was home to Native <b>Americans,</b> <b>who</b> lived mostly in villages near several creeks in the area. Ranchers and miners {{formally}} established the town of Manzanar in 1910, but abandoned the town by 1929 after the City of Los Angeles purchased the water rights to virtually the entire area. As different as these groups were, their histories displayed a common thread of forced relocation.|$|E
5|$|Some historians contend {{the goals}} of Great Naktong Offensive were {{unattainable}} from the beginning. The <b>Americans,</b> <b>who</b> had been better equipped than the North Koreans, were easily able to defeat their opponents once they {{had the chance to}} form a continuous line, according to historian T. R. Fehrenbach. At the same time, the North Koreans did break through the perimeter at several points and were able to exploit their gains for a short time.|$|E

5|$|Violence in Kentucky {{increased}} with {{the outbreak of}} the American Revolutionary War (1775–1783). Native <b>Americans</b> <b>who</b> were unhappy about the loss of Kentucky in treaties saw the war as a chance to drive out the colonists.

By late spring of 1776, fewer than 200 colonists remained in Kentucky, primarily at the fortified settlements of Boonesborough, Harrodsburg, and Logan's Station.|$|E

5|$|After the victory, a {{prize crew}} was put aboard Chesapeake. The {{commander}} of the prize, Lieutenant Falkiner, had {{a good deal of}} trouble from the restive <b>Americans,</b> <b>who</b> outnumbered his own men. He had some {{of the leaders of the}} unrest transferred to Shannon in the leg-irons that had, ironically, been shipped aboard Chesapeake to deal with expected British prisoners. The rest of the American crew were rendered docile by the expedient of a carpenter cutting scuttles (holes) in the maindeck through which two 18-pounder cannon, loaded with grapeshot, were pointed at them.|$|E
5|$|Along the Humboldt, {{the group}} met Paiute Native <b>Americans,</b> <b>who</b> joined {{them for a}} couple of days but stole or shot several oxen and horses.

Two wagons in the remaining group became tangled, and John Snyder angrily beat the ox of Reed's hired teamster Milt Elliott. When Reed intervened, Snyder turned the whip on him. Reed retaliated by fatally plunging a knife under Snyder's collarbone.|$|E

Two American POWs pretended to be sick in order to remain in the Rotenburg camp and to continue working on the tunnel and ultimately escape. The two <b>Americans,</b> <b>who</b> eventually rejoined the rest of the American POWs in Oflag 64, relayed the news that the tunnel had been discovered by the German guards who had learned of its existence after planting a spy among the POWs.|$|E
