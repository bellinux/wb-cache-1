He narrowly defeated Thomas partisan Michael Jones {{by a vote of}} 23–19. This may have been due to the influence of the powerful Secretary of State Elias Kane, a Thomas ally.|$|E
5|$|In 1949, the Japanese Economic Stabilization Agency {{calculated}} that the Allied naval bombardments {{and other forms of}} attack other than bombing had caused 3,282 casualties, representing 0.5 percent of all casualties inflicted by the <b>Allies</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Japanese home islands. The casualties attributed to naval bombardments and other causes included 1,739 fatalities, 46 persons who were still classified as missing and 1,497 people who were wounded.|$|E
5|$|Like other fairywrens, {{the superb}} fairywren is {{unrelated}} to the true wren. It was previously classified {{as a member of}} the Old World flycatcher family Muscicapidae and later {{as a member of the}} warbler family Sylviidae before being placed in the newly recognised Maluridae in 1975. More recently, DNA analysis has shown the Maluridae family to be related to the Meliphagidae (honeyeaters), and the Pardalotidae (pardalotes, scrubwrens, thornbills, gerygones and <b>allies)</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> large superfamily Meliphagoidea.|$|E

5|$|Minton ran for {{re-election}} to his Senate seat in 1940. McNutt was challenging Roosevelt for the Presidential nomination, forcing Minton {{to choose between}} the administration and his <b>allies</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> state party. Minton sided with Roosevelt, which cost him McNutt's and the Indiana Democratic Party machine's support in his re-election bid.|$|E
5|$|Noted for {{publishing}} the biting satirical pieces and art chronicles of Tudor Arghezi, Seara was {{closely associated with}} the Romanian Symbolist movement. Through Arghezi, Bogdan-Pitești and other contributors, it campaigned in favor Symbolism and, after 1913, popularized modern art. Although paying tribute to political conservatism throughout its existence, Seara was also home to anti-establishment contributors, <b>allies</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> anti-Entente cause. The newspaper sympathized with the Social Democratic Party, regularly hosting opinion pieces by socialists and anarchists.|$|E
5|$|Pericles {{wanted to}} {{stabilize}} Athens' dominance over its alliance and {{to enforce its}} pre-eminence in Greece. The {{process by which the}} Delian League transformed into an Athenian empire is generally considered to have begun well before Pericles' time, as various <b>allies</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> league chose to pay tribute to Athens instead of manning ships for the league's fleet, but the transformation was speeded and brought to its conclusion by Pericles.|$|E

5|$|The {{facilities}} on Morotai {{continued to}} be heavily used by the <b>Allies</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> months after the war. The Australian force responsible for the occupation and military administration of the eastern NEI was headquartered at Morotai until April 1946, when the Dutch colonial government was reestablished.

5|$|The {{occupation}} of Istanbul and Izmir by the <b>Allies</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> aftermath of World War I prompted {{the establishment of}} the Turkish National Movement. Under the leadership of Mustafa Kemal Pasha, a military commander who had distinguished himself during the Battle of Gallipoli, the Turkish War of Independence was waged with the aim of revoking the terms of the Treaty of Sèvres.|$|E
5|$|After Germany's {{conquest of}} Romania (see Romania during World War I), the German Imperial Navy had {{sufficient}} fuel oil for submarines {{located in the}} Black Sea. UB-44 and three of her sister ships in the Pola Flotilla were ordered to Constantinople and, en route, had to navigate through the Dardanelles, which had been heavily mined by the <b>Allies</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> middle of 1916. UB-44 departed from Cattaro on 8 August for Hersingstand (located on the Gallipoli peninsula) {{to pick up a}} pilot for the trip through the Dardanelles, but never arrived.|$|E

5|$|After {{recovering}} surprisingly fast {{from the}} sack of Rome, the Romans immediately resumed their expansion within Italy. The First Samnite War from 343 BC to 341 BC was relatively short: the Romans defeated the Samnites in two battles, but {{were forced to}} withdraw before they could pursue the conflict further due to the revolt of several of their Latin <b>allies</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Latin War. Rome defeated the Latins in the Battle of Vesuvius {{and again in the}} Battle of Trifanum, after which the Latin cities were obliged to submit to Roman rule.|$|E
5|$|Although Desha was universally {{acknowledged}} {{as the leading}} candidate during {{the early months of}} the campaign, as election day approached, some began to doubt whether he could withstand the withering attacks of the Anti-Relief Party. The Frankfort Argus, a pro-Desha newspaper, remained confident, however, predicting that the Relief candidate would win by a margin of 4-to-1. On election day, Desha secured a comfortable victory, receiving 38,378 votes, nearly 60% of the votes cast, and carrying large majorities even in some strongly Anti-Relief counties. Tompkins garnered 22,499 votes, with his support concentrated mostly in Central Kentucky. Russell finished third with 3,900 votes. Desha and his <b>allies</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> General Assembly interpreted the victory as a mandate from the voters to aggressively pursue their debt relief agenda.|$|E
5|$|Although Scottish seamen {{received}} {{protection against}} arbitrary impressment onto English men-of-war under Charles II, a fixed quota of conscripts for the Royal Navy was levied from the sea-coast burghs {{during the second}} half of the seventeenth century. Royal Navy patrols were now found in Scottish waters even in peacetime, such as the small ship-of-the-line HMS Kingfisher, which bombarded Carrick Castle during the Earl of Argyll's rebellion in 1685. Scotland went to war against the Dutch and their <b>allies</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Second (1665–67) and Third Anglo-Dutch Wars (1672–74) as an independent kingdom. Scottish captains, at least 80 and perhaps 120, took letters of marque, and privateers played a major part in the naval conflict of the wars.|$|E

40|$|Because of the Soviet threat {{at the end}} of World War II, Turkey {{followed}} a British-American centered foreign policy. In order to maintain a presence <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Middle East Britain embraced Turkey as her close <b>ally</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> region. The United States followed “containment policy” against the Soviet goal to spread communism <b>in</b> <b>the</b> region. Turkey thus played a key role <b>in</b> <b>the</b> region as a British and American <b>ally</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Middle East, but one which destroyed its relations with the other regional countries, like Egypt, which was under Soviet influence. This papercovers Turkey’s relations with the Middle Eastern countries during the Cold War and examines the influence of Britain, the United States and the Soviet Union on Turkey’s Middle East policy...|$|R
5|$|Although the United States gained {{official}} {{possession of}} the region following {{the conclusion of the}} American Revolution, British influence on its Native American <b>allies</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> region remained strong, especially near Fort Detroit. This influence caused the Northwest Indian War, which began when British-influenced native tribes refused to recognize American authority and were backed in their resistance by British merchants in the area. American military victories in the region and the ratification of the Jay Treaty, which called for British withdrawal from the region's forts, caused a formal evacuation, but the British were not fully expelled from the area until the conclusion of the War of 1812.|$|E
5|$|Escalating {{the scale}} of American {{intervention}} in the ongoing conflict between Ngô Đình Diệm's South Vietnamese government and the communist National Front for the Liberation of South Vietnam (NLF) insurgents opposing it, Johnson deployed some 575,000 troops in Southeast Asia to defeat the NLF and their North Vietnamese <b>allies</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Vietnam War, but his costly policy weakened the US economy and, by 1975, it ultimately culminated in what {{most of the world}} saw as a humiliating defeat of the world's most powerful superpower at the hands of one of the world's poorest nations.|$|E
5|$|Following Syria's secession, Nasser grew {{concerned}} with Amer's inability {{to train and}} modernize the army, and with the state within a state Amer had created in the military command and intelligence apparatus. In late 1961, Nasser established the Presidential Council and decreed it the authority to approve all senior military appointments, instead of leaving this responsibility solely to Amer. Moreover, he instructed that the primary criterion for promotion should be merit and not personal loyalties. Nasser retracted the initiative after Amer's <b>allies</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> officers corps threatened to mobilize against him.|$|E

5|$|Henry {{responded to}} the French and Angevin threat by {{expanding}} his own network of supporters beyond the Norman borders. Some Norman barons deemed unreliable were arrested or dispossessed, and Henry used their forfeited estates to bribe his potential <b>allies</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> neighbouring territories, in particular Maine. Around 1110, Henry attempted to arrest the young William Clito, but William's mentors moved him {{to the safety of}} Flanders before he could be taken. At about this time, Henry probably began to style himself as the Duke of Normandy. Robert of Bellême turned against Henry once again, and when he appeared at Henry's court in 1112 in a new role as a French ambassador, he was arrested and imprisoned.|$|E
5|$|In 1887, James W. Bryan vacated {{his seat}} in the Kentucky Senate to pursue the office of {{lieutenant}} governor. Goebel decided to seek election to the vacant seat representing the Covington area. His platform of railroad regulation and championing labor causes, combined with the influence of Stevenson, his former partner, should have given Goebel an easy victory, {{but this was not}} to be. A third political party, the Union Labor party, had risen to power in the area with a platform similar to Goebel's. However, while Goebel had to stick close to his <b>allies</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Democratic party, the Union Labor party courted the votes of both Democrats and Republicans, and made the election closedecided in Goebel's favor by a mere fifty-six votes.|$|E
5|$|In the 1890s, {{technology}} {{began to}} change this balance. New Krupp steel armour meant that it was now possible to give a cruiser side armour which would protect it against the quick-firing guns of enemy battleships and cruisers alike. In 1896–97 France and Russia, who were regarded as likely <b>allies</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> event of war, started to build large, fast armoured cruisers taking advantage of this. In {{the event of a}} war between Britain and France or Russia, or both, these cruisers threatened to cause serious difficulties for the British Empire's worldwide trade.|$|E
