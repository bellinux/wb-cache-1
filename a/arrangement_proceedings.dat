5000|$|While being {{famous for}} its {{efficiency}} in other matter, {{this is not true}} for debt restructuring. Many German companies prefer to restructure their debts using the English scheme of <b>arrangement</b> <b>proceedings</b> because they believe that the German restructuring law is not very helpful. The main {{reason for this is that}} binding a dissenting minority is only possible under formal insolvency proceedings in Germany.|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{the study}} is to empirically verify the {{usefulness}} the Polish models of discrimination analysis to the assessment the financial condition of the companies listed on the Stock Exchange and forecasting of the bankruptcy threat and assessment predictional value of these models. The identification of financial risk of the company using these models unlike the others methods is objective and straightforward. On the other hand, it is not perfect. Since it is based solely on the financial data. It does not include such factors as: improvement opportunities, the economic situation, the position of the company on the market, or the quality of the management. However, with respect to the easiness of the application, low engagement of the work and most of all relatively high creditability, discrimination method is the essential basis of the deduction regarding the economic and financial condition of the companies. The research has shown that the analyzed prognostic models constructed {{on the basis of the}} discrimination analysis characterize high predictional value even two years before bankruptcy petition and/or before <b>arrangement</b> <b>proceedings.</b> It should be emphasized that the results obtained by means of the discrimination analysis should not be treated as final. Properly used models can be solely important help in the assessment the real financial situation of the companies. In the study the emphasis was put on the difficulties which can occur in the use of the models. The basic problem seems to be the issue of the period of their effective application with respect to the changing economic conditions. bankruptcy, discrimination analysis, predictional value, prediction of financial distress...|$|E
5000|$|As far as {{conduct of}} the legislatures other than law-making is concerned, the {{implication}} of section 8(1) is that legislatures and their committees and functionaries are bound by the Bill of Rights when they perform non-legislative functions, such as the determination of internal <b>arrangements,</b> <b>proceedings,</b> rules and procedures. In De Lille v Speaker of the National Assembly, the High Court stated: ...|$|R
40|$|How may {{procedures}} {{in effect for}} hiring junior professors in France affect discrimination against women candidates? On the basis of detailed surveys and interviews with members of hiring committees in three disciplines, we explain how the specificities of the academic hiring process affect direct and indirect discrimination. Judgment practices on hiring committees are shown to be permeable to types of indirect gender discrimination, while various tools (a grid for evaluating candidate applications, explicitly defined selection criteria, etc.) and <b>arrangements</b> (publicizing <b>proceedings,</b> diversifying committee make-up, collegial decision-making, etc.) allow for circumscribing or containing possible direct discrimination...|$|R
50|$|Section 57(1)(a) of the Constitution {{permits the}} Assembly to {{determine}} and control its internal <b>arrangements</b> and <b>proceedings</b> and procedures. It does not, however, follow that the Assembly may {{do so in}} a manner inconsistent with the Constitution. The exercise of power conferred on the Assembly by section 57(1)(a) remains subject to the Constitution and subject to constitutional review by the Courts. Therefore, the court found, the contention that the mere issue of a certificate obliged the Court to stay proceedings, which should thereupon be deemed to be finalised, was untenable. To the extent that section 5 of the Powers and Privileges of Parliament Act purported to place issues of Parliamentary privilege beyond judicial scrutiny and thus beyond the supremacy of the Constitution on the mere ipse dixit of the Speaker, it was undoubtedly unconstitutional.|$|R
40|$|Society {{has become}} more {{dependent}} on automated intelligent systems, at the same time, these systems have {{become more and more}} complicated. Society's expectation regarding the capabilities and intelligence of such systems has also grown. We have become a more complicated society with more complicated problems. As the expectation of intelligent systems rises, we discover many more applications for artificial intelligence. Additionally, as the difficulty level and computational requirements of such problems rise, {{there is a need to}} distribute the problem solving. Although the field of multiagent systems (MAS) and distributed artificial intelligence (DAI) is relatively young, the importance and applicability of this technology for solving today's problems continue to grow. In multiagent systems, the main goal is to provide fruitful cooperation among agents in order to enrich the support given to all user activities. This paper deals with the development of a multiagent system aimed at solving the reservation problems encountered in rural tourism. Due to their benefits over the last few years, online travel agencies have become a very useful instrument in planning vacations. A MAS concept (which is based on the Internet exploitation) can improve this activity and provide clients with a new, rapid and efficient way of making accommodation <b>arrangements.</b> Comment: <b>Proceedings</b> of the Fourth International Conference "Internet-Education-Science- 2004 ", IES- 2004, Baku-Vinnytsia-Veliko Turnovo, 2004, vol. 2, ISBN 966 - 641 - 104 - 0, pag. 583 - 58...|$|R
60|$|Meanwhile, and {{pending the}} <b>arrangement</b> of the <b>proceedings,</b> {{and a fair}} {{division}} of the speechifying, {{the public in the}} large room were eyeing, by turns, the empty platform, and the ladies in the Music Gallery. In these amusements the greater portion of them had been occupied {{for a couple of hours}} before, and as the most agreeable diversions pall upon the taste on a too protracted enjoyment of them, the sterner spirits now began to hammer the floor with their boot-heels, and to express their dissatisfaction by various hoots and cries. These vocal exertions, emanating from the people who had been there longest, naturally proceeded from those who were nearest to the platform and furthest from the policemen in attendance, who having no great mind to fight their way through the crowd, but entertaining nevertheless a praiseworthy desire to do something to quell the disturbance, immediately began to drag forth, by the coat tails and collars, all the quiet people near the door; at the same time dealing out various smart and tingling blows with their truncheons, after the manner of that ingenious actor, Mr Punch: whose brilliant example, both in the fashion of his weapons and their use, this branch of the executive occasionally follows.|$|R
40|$|The {{attendance}} at the Workshop was similar to last year's with 123 registered participants of which 22 represented 8 foreign countries. A record number of technical papers (about 60) were submitted for presentation at the Workshop. The Program Committee, therefore, decided to have several parallel sessions to accommodate most of the papers. This format proved unpopular {{and will not be}} repeated. Many of the participants felt that the Workshop lost some of its unique qualities by having parallel sessions. The Workshop has always been held near the middle of December during examination week at Stanford. This timing was reviewed in an open discussion at the Workshop. The Program Committee subsequently decided to move the Workshop to January. The Tenth Workshop will be held on January 22 - 24, 1985. The theme of the Workshop this year was ''field developments worldwide''. The Program Committee addressed this theme by encouraging participants to submit field development papers, and by inviting several international authorities to give presentations at the Workshop. Field developments in at least twelve countries were reported: China, El Salvador, France, Greece, Iceland, Italy, Japan, Kenya, Mexico, New Zealand, the Philippines, and the United States. There were 58 technical presentations at the Workshop, of which 4 were not made available for publication. Several authors submitted papers not presented at the Workshop. However, these are included in the 60 papers of these Proceedings. The introductory address was given by Ron Toms of the U. S. Department of Energy, and the banquet speaker was A 1 Cooper of Chevron Resources Company. An important contribution was made to the Workshop by the chairmen of the technical sessions. Other than Stanford Geothermal Program faculty members, they included: Don White (Field Developments), Bill D'Olier (Hydrothermal Systems), Herman Dykstra (Well Testing), Karsten Pruess (Well Testing), John Counsil (Reservoir Chemistry), Malcolm Mossman (Reservoir Chemistry), Greg Raasch (Production), Manny Nathenson (Injection), Susan Petty (Injection), Subir Sanyal (Simulation), Marty Molloy (Petrothermal), and Allen Moench (Reservoir Physics). The Workshop was organized by the Stanford Geothermal Program faculty, staff and students. We would like to thank Jean Cook, Joanne Hartford, Terri Ramey, Amy Osugi, and Marilyn King for their valued help with the Workshop <b>arrangements</b> and the <b>Proceedings.</b> We also owe thanks to the program students who arranged and operated the audio-visual equipment. The Ninth Workshop was supported by the Geothermal and Hydropower Technologies Division of the U. S. Department of Energy through contract DE-AT 03 - 80 SF 11459. We deeply appreciate this continued support. H. J. Ramey, Jr., R. N. Horne, P. Kruger, W. E. Brigham, F. G. Miller, J. S. Gudmundsson -vi...|$|R
