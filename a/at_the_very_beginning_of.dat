5|$|<b>At</b> <b>the</b> <b>very</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>of</b> the 20th century, the Carrossier Normand was {{considered}} the best carriage horses available. The arrival of automobiles, and corresponding decline in demand for carriage horses, coincided with a split in the breed. A distinction was made between the lighter, faster horses in the breed, used for sport, and larger horses, used for agricultural work. The lighter horses eventually became the French Trotter (for driving) and Anglo-Norman (for riding and cavalry), while the heavier horses became the Norman Cob. In 1912, when French horse populations were at their highest, there were 422 stallions at the Saint-Lo stud, mainly cobs and trotters. When the original Carrossier Normand became extinct in the 1920s, breeding focused on the two remaining types, with the Norman Cob continuing {{to be used for}} farming and the Anglo-Norman being used to create the Selle Francais, the national French sport horse.|$|E
5|$|In {{these early}} days we {{explored}} {{all sorts of}} power reactors, comparing {{the advantages and disadvantages}} of each type. The number of possibilities was enormous, since there are many possibilities for each component of a reactor—fuel, coolant, moderator. The fissile material may be 233U, 235U, or 239Pu; the coolant may be: water, heavy water, gas, or liquid metal; the moderator may be: water, heavy water, beryllium, graphite—or, in a fast- neutron reactor, no moderator. I have calculated that, if one counted all the combinations of fuel, coolant, and moderator, one could identify about a thousand distinct reactors. Thus, <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>very</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>of</b> nuclear power, we had to choose which possibilities to pursue, which to ignore.|$|E

5|$|The kakawin text Irawan(an)taka ("Death of Irawan"), {{also known}} as Parthawijaya ("Arjuna's Victory"), {{describes}} Irawan's death in the Bharatayuddha (Mahabharata war). At {{the beginning of the}} Bharatayuddha, Irawan advances to the battlefield along with his brothers. Together, they kill many Kurawas. Later, the demon (ditya) Kalasrenggi encounters Irawan. Kalasrenggi, whose father was killed by Ardjuna, mistakes Irawan for Ardjuna because of the similarity of their appearance and kills him. Arjuna then kills Kalasrenggi to avenge Irawan's death. The death of Irawan is placed <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>very</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>of</b> the war in the Javanese version of the Mahabharata. The puppetry version of the story places this encounter between Irawan and Kalasrenggi even before Irawan's meeting with his father, ahead of the Bharatayuddha.|$|E
5|$|The {{traditional}} Mongolian {{script was}} adapted from Uyghur script probably <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>very</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>of</b> the 13th century and from that time underwent some minor disambiguations and supplementations. Between 1930 and 1932, a short-lived {{attempt was made to}} introduce the Latin script in the Mongolian state, and after a preparatory phase, the Mongolian Cyrillic script was declared mandatory by government decree. It has been argued that the 1941 introduction of the Cyrillic script, with its smaller discrepancy between written and spoken form, contributed {{to the success of the}} large-scale government literacy campaign, which increased the literacy rate from 17.3% to 73.5% between 1941 and 1950. Earlier government campaigns to eradicate illiteracy, employing the traditional script, had only managed to raise literacy from 3.0% to 17.3% between 1921 and 1940. From 1991 to 1994, an attempt at reintroducing the traditional alphabet failed in the face of popular resistance. In informal contexts of electronic text production, the use of the Latin alphabet is common.|$|E

He made the Nicaeno-Constantinopolitan creed the sole symbol of the Church and accorded legal force to the canons of the four ecumenical councils. The bishops in attendance at the Second Council of Constantinople in 553 recognized that nothing could be done in the Church contrary to the emperor's will and command, while, on his side, the emperor, {{in the case of the}} Patriarch Anthimus, reinforced the ban of the Church with temporal proscription. Justinian protected the purity of the church by suppressing heretics. He neglected no opportunity for securing the rights of the Church and clergy, for protecting and extending monasticism. He granted the monks the right to inherit property from private citizens and the right to receive solemnia or annual gifts from the Imperial treasury or from the taxes of certain provinces and he prohibited lay confiscation of monastic estates.|$|E

25|$|In other words, {{because the}} eclipse season (34 days long on average) {{is longer than}} the synodic month (one lunation, or {{the time for the}} Moon to return to a {{particular}} phase and about 29.5 days), the Moon will be new or full at least two, and up to three, times during the season. Eclipse seasons occur slightly shy of six months apart (successively occurring every 173.31 days - half of an eclipse year), the time it takes the Sun to travel from one node to the next along the ecliptic. If the last eclipse of an eclipse season occurs <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>very</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>of</b> a calendar year, it is possible for a total of seven eclipses to occur since there is still time {{before the end of the}} calendar year for two full eclipse seasons, each having up to three eclipses.|$|E
25|$|In Alzheimer's disease, {{sulfatide}} in {{the brain}} tissue decreases tremendously, starting {{in the early stages}} of the disease. In the mild stages of Alzheimer's disease, the loss of sulfatide can be up to 50% in the white matter and up to 90% in the gray matter {{in the brain}}. Sulfatide concentration in the cerebral spinal fluid is also lower in subjects with Alzheimer's disease. The characteristic loss of neuronal function associated with Alzheimer's disease occurs via the loss of neurons and synapses, and the deficit is lipid class specific to sulfatides. When comparing sulfatide depletion to other neurodegenerative diseases, Alzheimer's disease is the only case in which sulfatide is so dramatically depleted; in dementia no marked sulfatide depletion is observed, while in Parkinson's disease, sulfatide levels are dramatically elevated, and multiple sclerosis patients only have a moderate sulfatide depletion. Additionally, the loss of sulfatide has been observed to only occur <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>very</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>of</b> the disease while at more severe stages, minimal additional sulfatide loss occurs.|$|E
25|$|An eclipse {{season is}} the only time during which the Sun (from the {{perspective}} of the Earth) is close enough to one of the Moon's nodes to allow for an eclipse to occur. During the season, whenever there is a full moon a lunar eclipse will occur and whenever there is a new moon a solar eclipse will occur. If the Sun is close enough to a node, then a total eclipse will occur. Each season lasts from 31 to 37 days, recurring about every 6 months. At least two (one solar and one lunar, in any order), and at most three eclipses (solar, lunar, then solar again, or vice versa), will occur during every eclipse season. This is because it is about 15 days (a fortnight) between full moon and new moon and vice versa. If there is an eclipse <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>very</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>of</b> the season, then there is enough time (30 days) for two more eclipses.|$|E
