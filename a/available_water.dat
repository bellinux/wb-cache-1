5|$|As {{early as}} the 1930s, the state of California had floated the idea of {{diverting}} water from the rainy north to support irrigation in the fertile, but dry San Joaquin Valley. A diversion of the Trinity River was contemplated in order to boost the <b>available</b> <b>water</b> supply for the Central Valley watershed, but planners eventually determined that the extra water was not yet needed. The U.S. Bureau of Reclamation took over the Central Valley Project from the bankrupt state of California during the Great Depression in 1933 as a federal public works project, and in 1942 it began investigations to dam the Trinity River. However, the Trinity River plan was dropped in 1945, {{after the completion of}} nearby Shasta Dam.|$|E

5|$|The blue {{wildebeest}} is a herbivore, feeding {{primarily on}} the short grasses which commonly grow on light, and alkaline soils that are found in savanna grasslands and on plains. The animal's broad mouth is adapted for eating large quantities of short grass and it feeds both {{during the day and}} night. When grass is scarce, it will also eat the foliage of shrubs and trees. Wildebeest commonly associate with plains zebras as the latter eat the upper, less nutritious grass canopy, exposing the lower, greener material which the wildebeest prefer. Whenever possible, the wildebeest likes to drink twice daily and due to its regular requirement for water, it usually inhabits moist grasslands and areas with <b>available</b> <b>water</b> sources. The blue wildebeest drinks 9 to 12 litres of water every one to two days. Despite this, it can also survive in the arid Kalahari desert, where it obtains sufficient water from melons and water-storing roots and tubers.|$|E

5|$|Yosemite National Park has {{documented}} more than 130 non-native plant species within park boundaries. These non-native plants were introduced into Yosemite following {{the migration of}} early Euro-American settlers in the late 1850s. Natural and human-caused disturbances, such as wildland fires and construction activities, have contributed to a rapid increase in the spread of non-native plants. A number of these species aggressively invade and displace the native plant communities, resulting in impacts on the park's resources. Non-native plants can bring about significant changes in park ecosystems by altering the native plant communities and the processes that support them. Some non-native species may cause {{an increase in the}} fire frequency of an area or increase the available nitrogen in the soil that may allow more non-native plants to become established. Many non-native species, such as yellow star thistle (Centaurea solstitialis), are able to produce a long tap root that allows them to out-compete the native plants for <b>available</b> <b>water.</b>|$|E
5|$|The Australian raven can {{be found}} in a wide range of natural and {{modified}} habitats. It requires <b>available</b> <b>water</b> and trees (or buildings) to roost in or perch on. Preferred habitats include eucalypt-dominated sclerophyll forest, and farmland adjacent to trees. It is also found in heath and mangroves. In areas where it occurs with the little raven, namely over much of central New South Wales, Victoria and into South Australia, the Australian raven is restricted to more forested areas while the latter species prefers more open areas. Similarly, in inland Australia it can share range with the little crow, as the two do not appear to compete. However, the ranges of similar-sized forest raven and Torresian crow only narrowly overlap with the Australian raven as all three compete with each other. In central and western regions, Australian ravens and Torresian crows vie for the scattered uncommon trees and outcrops, and only one or the other are found there. It co-occurs with the forest raven in northeastern New South Wales from Port Stephens northwards. The Australian raven has adapted very well to human habitation in some cities and is the most common corvid in Canberra, Sydney and Perth; in Melbourne and Adelaide it is replaced by the little raven, and by the Torresian crow in Brisbane. Its large range, abundance and increasing population mean it is classified as Least Concern on the IUCN Red List.|$|E
25|$|Renewable {{freshwater}} {{supply is}} a metric {{often used in}} conjunction when evaluating water scarcity. This metric is informative because it can describe the total <b>available</b> <b>water</b> resource each country contains. By knowing the total <b>available</b> <b>water</b> source, an idea can be gained about whether a country is prone to experiencing physical water scarcity. This metric has its faults {{in that it is}} an average; precipitation delivers water unevenly across the planet each year and annual renewable water resources vary from year to year. This metric also does not describe the accessibility of water to individuals, households, industries, or the government. Lastly, as this metric is a description of a whole country, it does not accurately portray whether a country is experiencing water scarcity. Canada and Brazil both have very high levels of <b>available</b> <b>water</b> supply, but still experience various water related problems.|$|E
40|$|Water stress {{brings about}} changes in growth and dry matter {{partition}} in peanut plants and the changes vary depending on peanut cultivars. The objectives {{of this study were}} to investigate the effect of 3 regimes of <b>available</b> soil <b>water</b> on leaf development and dry matter partitioning of 4 peanut cultivars. A 4 × 3 factorial experiment in randomized complete block design with four replications was used. Treatments were combinations of 4 peanut cultivars; Tainan 9, Khon Kaen 60 - 3, ICGV 98308 and ICGV 98324, and three soil water regimes; field capacity (FC; 20 % soil moisture content), 1 2 <b>available</b> soil <b>water</b> (1 2 AW; 8. 6 % soil moisture content) and 1 4 <b>available</b> soil <b>water</b> (1 4 AW; 4. 3 % soil moisture content). On day 75 after seedlingemergence, depleting <b>available</b> soil <b>water</b> from FC to 1 4 AW significantly (p< 0. 01) reduced leaf areas of peanut plants. There were also significant differences (p< 0. 01) in leaf areas among peanut cultivars. At harvest, 1 2 AW caused more reduction in leaf area but resulted in an increase in weight of fallen leaves thandid 1 4 AW. On day 75 after seedling emergence, there was a significant effect (p< 0. 01) of <b>available</b> soil <b>water</b> on root:shoot ratios. As <b>available</b> soil <b>water</b> became limited, there was a significant increase (P< 0. 01) in root:shoot ratios. At harvest, there were interactions between <b>available</b> soil <b>water</b> and peanut cultivars for root:shoot ratio, harvest index and shelling percentage. At FC, {{there were no significant differences}} in root: shoot ratio among peanut cultivars. However, at 1 2 AW and 1 4 AW, there were significant differences in root:shoot ratios and the magnitude of differences varied depending on peanut cultivars. At 12 AW and 1 4 AW, Khon Kaen 60 - 3 had root:shoot ratios of 0. 55 and 0. 48 while ICGV 98324 had the ratios of 0. 35 and 0. 32, respectively. There were no significant differences in harvest index and shelling percentage among peanut cultivars when <b>available</b> soil <b>water</b> was at FC. At 1 2 AW and 1 4 AW, there was a large decrease in harvest index of Khon Kaen 60 - 3 and the indices were 0. 03 and 0. 01, respectively. At the corresponding <b>available</b> soil <b>waters,</b> ICGV 98324 had harvest indices of 0. 33 and 0. 23, respectively. Shelling percentages at 1 2 AW and 1 4 AW for Khon Kaen 60 - 3 were 24. 9 and 6. 8, respectively, while those for ICGV 98324 were 62. 3 and 46. 6, respectively. Our results indicated that under water stress the partitioning of dry matter into pod yields is more sensitive in drought-sensitive cultivars. Under drought conditions, mobilization of reserved assimilates in leaves could be crucial for supporting pod growth and yields in drought-tolerant cultivars...|$|R

40|$|Free {{water can}} be a {{limiting}} factor to wildlife in arid regions of the world. In the western United States, management agencies have installed numerous, expensive wildlife water developments (e. g. catchments, guzzlers, wells) to: 1) increase the distribution or density of target species, 2) influence animal movements, and 3) mitigate {{for the loss of}} <b>available</b> free <b>water.</b> Despite over 50 years as an active management practice, water developments have become controversial for several species. We lack an integrated understanding of the ways free water influences animal populations. In particular, we have not meshed understanding of evolutionary adaptations that reduce the need for free water and behavioral constraints that may limit use of otherwise <b>available</b> free <b>water</b> with management practices. I propose a conceptual framework for understanding more generally how, when, and where wildlife water developments are likely to benefit wildlife species. I argue that the following five elements are fundamental to an integrated understanding: 1) consideration of the variable nature in time and space of <b>available</b> free <b>water,</b> 2) location and availability of pre-formed and/or metabolic water, 3) seasonal temperature and precipitation patterns that influence the physiological need for water, 4) behavioral constraints that limit use of otherwise <b>available</b> free <b>water,</b> and 5) proper spacing of water sources for target species.
