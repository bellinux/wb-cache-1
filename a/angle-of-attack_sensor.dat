5000|$|The Piper Cheyenne {{prototype}} first flew in 1969. Designated the PA-31T-620, it {{was essentially}} a turboprop evolution of the Piper PA-31 Navajo, powered by two Pratt & Whitney Canada PT6A-28 turboprops rated at [...] each. Certification was granted on 3 May 1972. The original Cheyenne, produced from 1974 to 1977, did not carry a Roman numeral suffix designation. Because of difficulties complying with certification standards for longitudinal stability, the Cheyenne and later Cheyenne II are equipped with a Stability Augmentation System (SAS), consisting of a stick-pusher system (actuated by an <b>angle-of-attack</b> <b>sensor)</b> designed to provide the pilot with the appropriate stick force gradient - {{and to keep the}} airplane at its trim airspeed when flying near aft center of gravity loadings, high power settings, low airspeeds and high angles of attack. Without the SAS, the aircraft demonstrated neutral static stability in its flight regime. Later in 1978, it was redesignated as the Cheyenne II (PA-31T-2-620), due to the production of the PA-31T-1-500.|$|E
40|$|Abstract—Aircraft sensors are {{important}} for proper operation and safety, and their condition is conventionally monitored based upon the hardware redundancy principle. In this work a statistical method capable of independently monitoring a single sensor, and thus enhancing reliability and overall system safety, is introduced. The method’s main advantages are simplicity, applicability {{to a wide variety}} of aircraft operating conditions, the handling of uncertainties, no need for additionally monitored signals, and no need for physics based aircraft dynamics models. The method is based on a statistical time series framework accounting for random effects and uncertainties, and exploits the fact that abrupt faults are characterized by time constants smaller than those of the aircraft. It employs monitored signal nonstationarity removal, signal whitening via novel pooled autoregressive modeling, statistical decision making, as well as electronic spike/glitch removal logic. The method effectiveness is demonstrated within the simulation environment of a small commercial aircraft via test cases and Monte Carlo experiments with abrupt faults occurring in an <b>angle-of-attack</b> <b>sensor.</b> Index Terms—Aircraft control systems, <b>angle-of-attack</b> <b>sensor,</b> fault diagnosis, sensor abrupt faults, statistical methods.

40|$|Results of an {{experimental}} study of a wind tunnel model inertial <b>angle-of-attack</b> <b>sensor</b> response to a simulated dynamic environment are presented. The inertial device cannot distinguish between the gravity vector and the centrifugal accelerations associated with wind tunnel model vibration, this situation results in a model attitude measurement bias error. Significant bias error in model attitude measurement was found for the model system tested. The model attitude bias error {{was found to be}} vibration mode and amplitude dependent. A first order correction model was developed and used for estimating attitude measurement bias error due to dynamic motion. A method for correcting the output of the model attitude inertial sensor in the presence of model dynamics during on-line wind tunnel operation is proposed...|$|E

40|$|The {{response}} of a launch vehicle {{to a number}} of detailed wind profiles has been determined. The wind profiles were measured by two techniques which are briefly described. One of these techniques uses an <b>angle-of-attack</b> <b>sensor</b> in conjunction with guidance data to measure the wind profile traversed by some particular launch vehicle. The other wind-measuring technique is a photographic triangulation method, whereby two cameras take simultaneous pictures of a vertical trail of smoke left by a launch vehicle or sounding rocket. The {{response of}} a vehicle flying these detailed profiles is compared with the response of the same vehicle flying through balloon-measured profiles. The response to the detailed wind profiles, relative t o the balloon-measured profiles, is characterized by the large excitation of the rigid pitch and elastic bending modes. This is found to cause higher loads on the launch vehicle structure. Established design criteria which utilize balloon measured wind profiles have arbitrarily accounted-for this increased load by adding a load due to some type of discrete gust...|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} we propose a two steps optimal {{synthesis}} approach of robust fault detection filters for the model based diagnosis of sensor faults for an augmented civil aircraft. In the first step a direct analytic synthesis of a linear parameter varying (LPV) fault detection filter is performed for the open-loop aircraft using an extension of the nullspace based synthesis method to LPV systems. The employed scheduling parameters are either directly measurable flight conditions (altitude and speed) or aircraft parameters estimated in real time (mass and center of gravity position). In the second step, a multi-objective optimization problem is solved for the optimal tuning of the LPV detector parameters to ensure satisfactory fault detection performance for the augmented nonlinear closed-loop aircraft. Worst-case global search has been employed to assess the robustness of the fault detection system in the presence of aerodynamics uncertainties and estimation errors in the aircraft parameters. The main appeal of the proposed approach is its applicability to any robustly stable closed-loop aircraft simulation model, for which the open-loop aircraft model is trimmable and linearizable. An application of the proposed method is presented for the detection of failures in the <b>angle-of-attack</b> <b>sensor...</b>|$|E
5000|$|The PC-12 {{incorporates}} numerous safety measures. The PT6A-67 engine has {{a reputation}} for considerable reliability, a factor that has reportedly been decisive to some prospective operators. To counteract stall and spin conditions, dual <b>angle-of-attack</b> <b>sensors</b> near the wingtips force the stick forwards in advance of a potential stall. For greater redundancy, the PC-12 NG has a complete split-bus dual electrical system as akin to modern jet aircraft, in addition to two separate batteries and a third emergency battery. The type is certified for flight into known ice conditions; as per standard fit, pneumatic de-icing systems are installed in the wings and empennage, while electrical de-icing measures are integrated into the windshield and exhaust heat is used for engine inlet de-icing.

40|$|The primary {{objective}} of the Quiet Spike flight research program was the aerodynamic and structural proof-of-concept of a telescoping, 24 ft, sonic-boom suppressing nose boom on a F- 15 B aircraft.

In the area of stability and controls the primary concern {{was to assess the}} effect of the spike on the stability, controllability and handling qualities of the aircraft. The primary goal of this test philosophy was maintaining safety of flight. Two main issues are discussed in this paper: the stability and controls approach and analysis in the presence of uncertain spike influenced aerodynamics on the F- 15 B aircraft flight dynamics; and the analysis of F- 15 B flight dynamics implications due to spike induced air flow in the vicinity of air data and <b>angle-of-attack</b> <b>sensors.</b> Also addressed are flight test implications based on the analysi...|$|R
40|$|The {{primary purpose}} of the Quiet Spike(TradeMark) flight {{research}} program was to analyze the aerodynamic, structural, and mechanical proof-of-concept of a large multi-stage telescoping nose spike installed on the National Aeronautics and Space Administration Dryden Flight Research Center (Edwards, California) F- 15 B airplane. This report describes the preflight stability and control analysis performed to assess the effect of the spike on the stability, controllability, and handling qualities of the airplane; and to develop an envelope expansion approach to maintain safety of flight. The overall flight test objective was to collect flight data to validate the spike structural dynamics and loads model up to Mach 1. 8. Other objectives included validating the mechanical feasibility of a morphing fuselage at operational conditions and determining the near-field shock wave characterization. The two main issues relevant to the stability and control objectives were the effects of the spike-influenced aerodynamics on the F- 15 B airplane flight dynamics, and the air data and <b>angle-of-attack</b> <b>sensors.</b> The analysis covered the sensitivity of the stability margins, and the handling qualities due to aerodynamic variation and the maneuvering limitations of the F- 15 B Quiet Spike configuration.

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThe CMARC panel-code is evaluated {{for the development}} of an aerodynamic model of the Naval Postgraduate School FROG Unmanned Air Vehicle (UAV). CMARC is a personal computer hosted panel-code software suite for solving inviscid, incompressible flow over complex three-dimensional bodies. A panel model of the NPS FROG UAV is developed to obtain stability derivative data at the cruise flight condition. Emphasis is placed on comparing the CMARC data to aerodynamic models obtained from classical design techniques and parameter estimation. Linearized longitudinal and lateral-directional state-equation models are used to compare the dynamic response of each data set. In addition, CMARC is used to generate static-source and <b>angle-of-attack</b> <b>sensor</b> position corrections. Position correctionsare provided in look-up table and curve-fit formats. The aerodynamic model obtained with CMARC demonstrated higher fidelity dynamic longitudinal response than the classical design model. Dynamic lateral- directional response is similar to that obtained from classical design techniques. Adjustment through comparison with flight-test data is still required to optimize the CMARC model. Future studies should concentrate on improving CMARC modeling of fuselage side force through the addition of wake separation lines. Additionally, the propeller disk should be modeled in an attempt to capture the effects of increased dynamic pressure over the horizontal and vertical tail surfaces[URL] United States Nav...|$|E
40|$|Magnitudes of lags in the {{pneumatic}} <b>angle-of-attack</b> and angle-of-sideslip <b>sensor</b> {{systems of}} the YF- 12 A airplane were determined {{for a variety of}} flight conditions by analyzing stability and control data. The three analysis techniques used are described. An apparent trend with Mach number for measurements from both of the differential-pressure sensors showed that the lag ranged from approximately 0. 15 second at subsonic speed to 0. 4 second at Mach 3. Because Mach number was closely related to altitude for the available flight data, the individual effects of Mach number and altitude on the lag could not be separated clearly. However, the results indicated the influence of factors other than simple pneumatic lag...|$|R
40|$|A Time-dependent Functional Pooling Nonlinear AutoRegressive with eXogenous {{excitation}} (TFP-NARX) {{methodology for}} aircraft virtual sensor design is introduced. The methodology {{is unique in}} establishing a single but global nonlinear dynamical model, referred to as TFP-NARX, from data obtained from several individual flights, each corresponding to different flight conditions and aircraft configurations. This model structure is demonstrated {{to be capable of}} accurately representing the aircraft nonlinear dynamics under various flight conditions and aircraft configurations in terms of aircraft weight and center-of-gravity. Based on this model structure, three individual designs are postulated: A “fixed ” design pertaining to a single aircraft weight and center-of-gravity configuration, as well as two more involved designs, a “basic ” and an “extended ” one, that account for various aircraft configurations. The three designs are subsequently employed for the development of <b>angle-of-attack</b> virtual <b>sensors</b> for the main flight regimes (landing, take-off, clean flight) of a small commercial aircraft.

40|$|Flight {{calibrations}} of a fixed hemispherical flow <b>angle-of-attack</b> and angle-of-sideslip <b>sensor</b> {{were made}} from Mach numbers of 0. 5 to 1. 8. Maneuvers were performed by an F- 104 airplane at selected altitudes to compare the measurement of flow angle of attack from the fixed hemispherical sensor with that from a standard angle-of-attack vane. The hemispherical flow-direction sensor measured differential pressure at two angle-of-attack ports and two angle-of-sideslip ports in diametrically opposed positions. Stagnation pressure was measured at a center port. The results of these tests showed that the calibration curves for the hemispherical flow-direction sensor were linear for angles of attack up to 13 deg. The overall uncertainty in determining angle of attack from these curves was plus or minus 0. 35 deg or less. A Mach number position error calibration curve was also obtained for the hemispherical flow-direction sensor. The hemispherical flow-direction sensor exhibited a much larger position error than a standard uncompensated pitot-static probe...|$|R
