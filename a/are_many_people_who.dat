5|$|Veronica and Keith (Enrico Colantoni) have a minor {{fight over}} Keith’s {{relationship}} with Harmony. Veronica is staying in Wallace (Percy Daggs III) and Piz’s (Chris Lowell) dorm room. Piz comes in unexpectedly, {{and the two}} end up hanging out. However, a girl shows up and tells them that her boyfriend, Sully, has gone missing. They look in Sully’s room, but the girlfriend is hesitant to help. In criminology class, Mr. Landry (Patrick Fabian) tells Veronica that he’s applied her for an internship at the FBI. Veronica talks to Logan (Jason Dohring) about Mercer, but he still refuses to give her an alibi. Veronica and the girlfriend, Meryl, find that Sully has contacted another girl, Scarlett, but Scarlett knows that Sully has a girlfriend. Veronica visits Mercer in prison, and he tells her that there <b>are</b> <b>many</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> would want to frame him. Sully’s roommate comes back to their room, and Veronica uncovers that Meryl and Sully had a fight the previous weekend.|$|E
25|$|Several peer based organisations {{exist for}} sex workers. The aim of these organisations {{is to support}} the health, rights and well being of sex workers and {{advocate}} on their behalf for law reform {{in order to make}} working safer. Sex work is work and there <b>are</b> <b>many</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> willingly choose it as a job/career. While sex trafficking does exist, not everyone who does sex work is doing so under duress. Social stigma is a major hurdle sex workers encounter, with many people trying to 'save' them. Peer support workers and peer educators are seen as best practice by the Sex Industry Network (SIN) when engaging with community members because peers can understand that someone could willingly choose to do sex work.|$|E
25|$|Consumer-generated {{advertising}} {{is a relatively}} new and controversial development, and it has created a new model of marketing communication from businesses to consumers. Among the various forms of advertising on blog, the most controversial are the sponsored posts. These are blog entries or posts and may be in the form of feedback, reviews, opinion, videos, etc. and usually contain a link back to the desired site using a keyword or several keywords. Blogs have led to some disintermediation and a breakdown of the traditional advertising model, where companies can skip over the advertising agencies (previously the only interface with the customer) and contact the customers directly via social media websites. On the other hand, new companies specialised in blog advertising have been established, {{to take advantage of this}} new development as well. However, there <b>are</b> <b>many</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> look negatively on this new development. Some believe that any form of commercial activity on blogs will destroy the blogosphere’s credibility.|$|E

500|$|Rumors of {{a multimillion-dollar}} bidding war over Jackson's {{recording}} contract began to circulate in spring 1991. Jet magazine reported: [...] "A recording company has offered {{in excess of}} $50 million to sign superstar Janet Jackson to a recording contract, making the 24-year-old singer/songwriter/dancer/actress the key player {{in one of the}} hottest bidding wars among today's major record companies." [...] Reports indicated that Capitol, Virgin and Atlantic were all bidding for Jackson's contract, as her ties to A would soon expire; by March, she had signed with Virgin. The New York Times declared [...] "Janet Jackson has signed what {{is believed to be the}} most lucrative contract in the history of recording. The 24-year-old singer, songwriter and actress signed an exclusive contract with Virgin Records it was announced yesterday." [...] Her new contract guaranteed a twenty-two percent royalty payment, in addition to her then-historic signing bonus. Chuck Philips of the Los Angeles Times reported that it had been the largest bidding war in recent memory and that [...] "ne reason the bidding was so heavy, various industry observers have noted, was that Jackson-at just 24-is still a relatively fresh face on the pop scene and that her dance-pop style is ideal for today's pop/video climate." [...] In addition, her potential as an international superstar proved to be the primary motivation for the label's investment. Jeff Ayeroff, co-managing director of Virgin in the US stated: [...] "Janet is a world-class artist and we expect her growth to be enormous." [...] Chairman Richard Branson spoke with Jackson privately to seal the deal. He commented: [...] "A Rembrandt rarely becomes available...

Punknews.org editor Jesse Raub addressed the situation in his blog, stating that [...] "It sucks that Mr. Hale’s decision to share the album with his friends turned out this way.

2500|$|Basque {{surnames}} usually {{denote the}} patronymic {{house of the}} bearer; e.g. Etxebarria – [...] "new house", from etxe (house) + barri (new), denotes [...] "related to a so-named farmhouse"; in the same way, Garaikoetxea – [...] "house in the heights", garai ("height") + etxe ("house"). Sometimes, surnames denote not the house itself but a characteristic of the place, e.g. Saratxaga – [...] "willow-place", from saratze ("willow") + -aga ("place of"); Loyola, from loi ("mud") + ola ("iron smithery"); Arriortua – [...] "stone orchard", from harri ("stone") + ortua ("orchard"). Before the 20th century all Basque men were considered nobles (indeed, some Basque surnames, e.g. Irujo or Medoza, were related {{to some of the}} oldest Spanish noble families), and many of them used their status to emigrate with privileges to other regions of the Spanish Empire, especially the Americas, due to which some Basque surnames became common to the Spanish-American world; e.g. Mendoza – [...] "cold mountain", from mendi ("mountain" [...] + hotza ("cold"); Salazar – [...] "Old hall", from sala ("hall") + zahar ("old"). Until 1978, Spanish was the single official language of the Spanish civil registries and Basque surnames had to be registered according to the Spanish phonetical rules (for example, the Spanish [...] "ch" [...] sound merges the Basque [...] "ts", [...] "tx", and [...] "tz", and someone whose surname in Standard Basque would be [...] "Krutxaga" [...] would have to write it as [...] "Cruchaga", letter [...] "k" [...] also not being used in Spanish). Although the democratic restoration ended this policy, allowing surnames to be officially changed into their Basque phonology, there still <b>are</b> <b>many</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> hold Spanish-written Basque surnames, even in the same family: a father born before 1978 would be surnamed [...] "Echepare" [...] and his children, [...] "Etxepare". This policy even changed the usual pronunciation of some Basque surnames. For instance, in Basque, the letter [...] "z" [...] maintained a sibilant [...] "s"-like sound, while Spanish changed it; thus, a surname such as [...] "Zabala" [...] should be properly read similar to [...] "sabala" [...] (...) , although in Spanish, because the [...] "z" [...] denotes a [...] "th" [...] sound (...) , it would be read as [...] "Tha-bala" [...] (...) [...] However, since the letter [...] "z" [...] exists in Spanish, the registries did not force the Zabalas to transliterate their surname.|$|E
