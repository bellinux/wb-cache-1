40|$|The partial hand {{device called}} the Handy Hook {{which was made}} by the Robin-Aids Company from the early 1950 s to the 1980 s and has been {{unavailable}} for many years is again available. The Hosmer-Dorrance Corporation is making the <b>attachment</b> <b>kit</b> for this device and it is part # 62594. This hook adaptor system is useable for a partial hand to hook attachment as well as a functional split hook adaptor for quadriplegics and other functional loss situations. The adaptor creates a very low profile hook attachment to a hand splint or partial hand socket to provide functional grip...|$|E

40|$|This {{pilot study}} {{measured}} {{activities of daily}} living performance in individuals/participants with hemiplegia propelling both a standard dual handrim Action 3 wheelchair and a standard Action 3 wheelchair with a Neater Uni-Wheelchair <b>kit</b> <b>attachment.</b> The <b>kit</b> consists of a steerable front. Research questions: Does the use of the NUW affect the performance quality of {{activities of daily living}} in individuals/participants with hemiplegia. Is there a difference in the motor and process skills during activities of daily living performance, and in the time taken to complete the activities. Four individuals/participants with hemiplegia were used in a cross over, repeated measures trial. Assessment of Motor and Process Skills of users undertaking making a bed and laying a table ‘Swedish style’, tasks were measured and time taken to complete each task were recorded. Bed making completion time was quicker in the Neater Uni-wheelchair (p< 0. 03). Motor skills were significantly higher than the process ability skills (p< 0. 05). Activities of daily living tasks in the Neater Uni-wheelchair were completed more efficiently with no loss in quality of motor and process skills performance. This suggests that the Neater Uni-wheelchair is a viable alternative to current one arm drive provision. ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. In {{this paper}} we {{describe}} how information processing constructs originating in AI {{have become part}} of the <b>Attachment</b> Theory tool <b>kit.</b> We survey the early influence of AI within the theoretical framework that John Bowlby formed as the foundation of Attachment Theory between the 1950 s and 1980 s. We then review recent work which has built upon Bowlby’s framework and is concerned with modelling and simulating attachment phenomena. We conclude by discussing some possible advantages that might arise from incorporating recent work on Bayesian arbitration into attachment control system models. ...|$|R

All Ballisitic Welds for steel have to conform to Appendix B of the GCVWC 12479550. Different Armors Ballistic test plates shall be prepared for each type and class of armor used. The Thickness ranges per Table 3. 1 in GCVWC 12479550 explain thicknesses from 1 / 8 " to unlimited. Ballisitic welds for steel require qualifaction of a H-Plate per section B 3. 7 and shall be qualified as such. 2 <b>Attachment</b> 70, Installed <b>Kits</b> Tabs Since the BII is identified and priced on the Installed Kits tabs should industry exclude BII from the Vehicles tabs? BII is identified as a kit, separately from the vehicle price, as Installed Kits and Packaged Kits. BII should be priced as shown on the applicable <b>kit</b> worksheets in <b>Attachment</b> 0070.
