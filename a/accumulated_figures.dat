The objective of this thesis is to introduce {{the products of the}} company, to analyse its marketing strategy and marketing environment, and finally to propose feasible changes of the contemporary strategy. To achieve this objective, I have applied several subanalyses and my own marketing research. The <b>accumulated</b> <b>figures</b> are evaluated in the final SWOT analysis.

40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{dissertation}} is a {{study of}} rural social problems by examining general principles in their application to a definite local situation. Nothing of the kind {{has been done in}} this Province, so far as can be ascertained, except for a very detailed statistical survey made by Rev. J. M. Singleton, B. A. of Blaine Lake which <b>accumulated</b> <b>figures</b> rather than facts and simply provided data for such a study as is here proposed. But while local conditions have received little attention the general provincial situation has not been neglected. Business institutions, Farmers' organizations and a very sympathetic Provincial Government have collected, classified and disseminated information on many subjects of value to the rural community - but always in the broadest and most general terms. Our province however has such a wide area and variety of soil, climate and population that conditions which prevail in one district may be directly reversed in the experience of people elsewhere. We shall therefore take the district of Ethelton and see how general agricultural problems of Saskatchewan can be dealt with there...|$|E

30|$|The {{expression}} of genes involved {{directly or indirectly}} in Zn transport increases under Zn deficiency. Moreover, the genes involved in starch synthesis and transport were up-regulated by Zn deficiency. Both Zn-deficient roots and shoots <b>accumulated</b> starch (<b>Figure</b> 1), {{in line with the}} gene expression pattern (Table 2). Starch may be used as a carbon source; therefore, it is assumed that Zn-deficient plants synthesize starch to withstand temporary abiotic stress. However, {{it is also possible that}} disruption of glycolysis by Zn deficiency causes an over-accumulation of soluble sugar, which ultimately results in starch accumulation. It is already reported that the activity of FBP aldolase in the glycolysis pathway decreased under Zn-deficiency in the leaves of oat and clover, and suggested that one of the reasons for a growth defect in plants grown under Zn-deficient conditions is the breakdown of normal carbohydrate metabolism (Quinlan-Watson [1951]). The concentration of soluble sugar and starch increase in Zn-deficient bean shoots (Marschner & Cakmak [1989]). An increase in soluble sugar would cause osmotic stress. We speculate that the starch might be synthesized to avoid osmotic stress due to increased soluble sugar in cells under Zn deficiency. Up-regulation of the genes that encode soluble sugar transporters due to Zn-deficiency suggests that sugar transporters help distribute sugar to avoid osmotic stress (Table 2).|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this project is to examine how {{cultural}} explanations and affective economies are interdependent, based on the public debate following incidents of sexual assaults on women in Cologne on New Year’s Eve 2015 / 2016. The project takes its point of departure in an episode of the Danish TV-debate programme ‘Debatten: A New Battle for Gender Equality?’, where an overall consensus ascribes {{the responsibility of the}} attacks to non-Western culture. Sara Ahmed’s terminology in ‘The Cultural Politics of Emotion’ (2014) describes how bodily encounters involve creating the very surfaces of bodies, so that signs ‘stick’ to certain bodies. The sticking of signs happens in ‘circulation’ that makes the value of signs increase the more they circulate. This theory enables us to assess how different non-Western individuals are made into figures aligned with each other in ‘Debatten’. These <b>figures</b> <b>accumulate</b> affective value because of their histories of association; histories that we find to be dependent on discursive and affective processes related to a colonial heritage. Assembling all these figures into a single figure of ‘the non-Westerner’ {{can be seen as a}} reproduction of orientalist patterns, creating borders between ‘the West’ and ‘the Orient’. Thus, the cultural explanations articulated in ‘Debatten’ are rendered possible by colonial ‘othering’, a discourse that in turn relies on the constant affective circulation of signs associated with ‘the other’; making cultural explanations and affective economies interdependent...|$|R

40|$|The phenomenological Johnson-Cook {{continuum}} {{and failure}} models constitute a simple ap- proach to the modelling of ductile fracture in metals. Even though {{the model is}} simple, it catches the material behavior at high speed/temperature with a relatively few material parameters. This is an obvious advantage, {{in addition to its}} widespread use in commercial softwares, which makes it so often used in many applications, and, in particular, machining simulations of metal cutting processes. Even though there are advantages with the model, a major drawback from our expe- rience 1 is that the JC–material model exhibits a significant mesh size dependence in orthogonal machining simulations. In order to overcome this difficulty a mesh objective element removal technology is devised based on a smeared out type of dissipation concept to represent the fracture energy. The tech- nology is investigated for the ductile failure modeling of the pearlite phase in a cast iron mi- crostructure with the objective to obtain a mesh size independent computational tool. In order to obtain mesh objective element deletion, an element removal criterion is defined on the plastic strain energy prior to fracture state is considered as fracture energy. A fracture state is achieved in a gauss-point when the accumulated effective plastic strain equals the fracture strain, com- puted with the Johnson-Cook fracture model. Then a total scaled fracture dissipation energy is computed based on the current <b>accumulated</b> dissipation.

40|$|Taking {{the works}} of William Gibson as its point of focus, this thesis {{considers}} cyberpunk’s expansion from an emphatically literary moment in the mid 1980 s into a broader multimedia cultural phenomenon. It examines the representation of racial differences, and the formulation of global economic spaces and flows which structure the reception and production of cultural practices. These developments are construed in relation to ongoing debates around Japan’s identity and otherness {{in terms of both}} deviations from and congruities with the West (notably America). To account for these developments, this thesis adopts a theoretical framework informed by both postmodernism as the “cultural dominant” of late capitalism (Jameson), and orientalism, those discursive structures which produce the reified polarities of East versus West (Said). Cyberpunk thus exhibits the characteristics of an orientalised postmodernism, as it imagines a world in which multinational corporations characterised as Japanese zaibatsu control global economies, and the excess of <b>accumulated</b> garbage is <b>figured</b> in the trope of gomi. It is also postmodernised orientalism, in its nostalgic reconstruction of scenes from the residue of imperialism, its deployment of figures of “cross-ethnic representation” (Chow) like the Eurasian, and its expressions of a purely fantasmatic experience of the Orient, as in the evocation of cyberspace. In distinction from modern or Saidean orientalism, postmodern orientalism not only allows but is characterized by reciprocal causality. This describes uneven, paradoxical, interconnected and mutually implicated cultural transactions at the threshold of East-West relations. The thesis explores this by first examining cyberpunk’s unremarked relationship with countercultural formations (rock music), practices (drugs) and manifestations of Oriental otherness in popular culture. The emphasis in the remainder of the thesis shifts towards how cyberpunk maps new technologies onto physical and imaginative “bodies” and geographies: the figuration of the cyborg, prosthetic interventions, and the evolution of cyberspace in tandem with multimedia innovations such as videogames. Cyberpunk then can best be understood as a conjunction of seemingly disparate experiences: on the one hand the postmodern dislocations and vertiginous moments of estrangement offset by instances of intense connectivity in relation to the virtual, the relocation to the “distanceless home” of cyberspace. As such it is an ever-expanding phenomenon which has been productively fused with other youth-culture media, and one with specifically Japanese features (anime, visual kei, and virtual idols) ...|$|R
