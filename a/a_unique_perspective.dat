He worked with inspirational figures such as Ramon Vinyes, whom García Márquez depicted as an Old Catalan who owns a bookstore in One Hundred Years of Solitude. At this time, García Márquez was also introduced to the works of writers such as Virginia Woolf and William Faulkner.

500|$|The work of Marlon Ross and Anne K. Mellor {{represents}} a second way {{to apply the}} insights of feminist theory to the recovery of women writers. They argue that Barbauld and other Romantic women poets carved out a distinctive feminine voice in the literary sphere. As {{a woman and a}} Dissenter, Barbauld had <b>a</b> <b>unique</b> <b>perspective</b> on society, according to Ross, and it was this specific position that [...] "obligated" [...] her to publish social commentary. Ross points out, however, women were in a double bind: [...] "They could choose to speak politics in nonpolitical modes, and thus risk greatly diminishing the clarity and pointedness of their political passion, or they could choose literary modes that were overtly political while trying to infuse them with a recognizable 'feminine' decorum, again risking a softening of their political agenda." [...] So Barbauld and other Romantic women poets often wrote [...] "occasional poems". These had traditionally commented, often satirically, on national events, {{but by the end of}} the eighteenth century were increasingly serious and personal. Women wrote sentimental poems, a style then much in vogue, on personal occasions such as the birth of a child and argued that in commenting on the small occurrences of daily life, they would establish a moral foundation for the nation. Scholars such as Ross and Mellor maintain that this adaptation of existing styles and genres is one way that women poets created a feminine Romanticism.|$|E
500|$|Last of the Summer Wine was set and {{filmed in}} and around Holmfirth, West Yorkshire, England, and centred on a trio of old men and their {{youthful}} misadventures; {{the membership of the}} trio changed several times over the years. The original trio consisted of Bill Owen as the mischievous and impulsive Compo Simmonite, Peter Sallis as easy-going everyman Norman Clegg, and Michael Bates as uptight and arrogant Cyril Blamire. When Bates dropped out due to illness in 1976 after two series, the role of the third man of the trio was filled in various years up to the 30th series by the quirky war veteran Walter [...] "Foggy" [...] Dewhurst (Brian Wilde), who had two lengthy stints in the series, the eccentric inventor Seymour Utterthwaite (Michael Aldridge), and former police officer Herbert [...] "Truly of The Yard" [...] Truelove (Frank Thornton). The men never seem to grow up, and they develop <b>a</b> <b>unique</b> <b>perspective</b> on their equally eccentric fellow townspeople through their stunts. Although in its early years the series generally revolved around the exploits of the main trio, with occasional interaction with a few recurring characters, over time the cast grew to include a variety of supporting characters and by later years the series was very much an ensemble piece. Each of these recurring characters contributed their own running jokes and subplots to the show and often becoming reluctantly involved in the schemes of the trio, or on occasion having their own, separate storylines.|$|E
