5|$|The Allied command {{structure}} in the South West Pacific Area faced the challenges of coalition warfare in several ways, {{with varying degrees of}} success. The benefits of the wartime alliances proved to be substantial, but required constant effort to maintain. For Australia and New Zealand, coalition warfare became the norm, and the experience in SWPA proved to be a formative and informative one, with many political and military lessons. Over the following decades, Australian, New Zealand and American forces would fight together again, in the Korean War, Vietnam War <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>War</b> <b>on</b> Terror.|$|E
5|$|The Philippines values its {{relations}} with the United States. It supported the United States during the Cold War <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>War</b> <b>on</b> Terror and is a major non-NATO ally. Despite this history of goodwill, controversies related to the presence of the now former U.S. military bases in Subic Bay and Clark and the current Visiting Forces Agreement have flared up from time to time. Japan, the biggest contributor of official development assistance to the country, is thought of as a friend. Although historical tensions still exist on issues such as the plight of comfort women, much of the animosity inspired by memories of World War II has faded.|$|E

5|$|In 2008, DiCaprio {{starred in}} Body of Lies, a spy film {{based on the}} novel of the same name by David Ignatius, set in context of the Middle East <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>War</b> <b>on</b> Terror, telling the story of three men battling a {{terrorist}} organization, and each other. Directed by Ridley Scott, DiCaprio dyed his hair brown and wore brown contacts for the role, which he chose to pursue because he considered it a throwback to political films of the 1970s such as The Parallax View (1974) and Three Days of the Condor (1975). The film received mixed reviews from critics, and at a budget of US$67.5 million, became a moderate box office success, grossing US$115 million worldwide.|$|E

25|$|Alvarez {{has been}} known for facilitating and {{endorsing}} impeachment efforts against Vice President, Robredo and Supreme Court Chief Justice, Sereno. Alvarez's endorsed impeachment complaint against Robredo came after the Vice President reported to the United Nations the state of the country <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>War</b> <b>on</b> Drugs that President Duterte's administration is currently conducting. Alvarez claims that Robredo's act of portraying the country in a bad light is a betrayal of public trust, and thus impeachable. Alvarez has also revealed that the congress will be discussing possible impeachment complaint against Chief Justice Sereno for meddling {{in the case of the}} Congress' detention of Ilocos-6, wherein Sereno granted the right of habeas corpus to the six individuals.|$|E
25|$|Social progressivism {{is another}} common feature of modern leftism, {{particularly}} in the United States, where social progressives {{played an important role}} in the abolition of slavery, women's suffrage, civil rights and multiculturalism. Progressives have both advocated prohibition legislation and worked towards its repeal. Current positions associated with social progressivism in the West include opposition to the death penalty <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>War</b> <b>on</b> Drugs, as well as support for legal recognition of same-sex marriage, cognitive liberty, distribution of contraceptives, public funding of embryonic stem-cell research and the right of women to choose abortion. Public education was a subject of great interest to groundbreaking social progressives, such as Lester Frank Ward and John Dewey, who believed that a democratic system of government was impossible without a universal and comprehensive system of education.|$|E
25|$|In the event, the {{industrial}} web theory {{failed to achieve}} its goals. Various targets were chosen and attacked serially, without evaluating the results {{in light of their}} interdependence. American bombing leaders maintained that precision attacks were being carried out, but in early 1944 poor weather over Europe prevented visual sighting, and bombs were dropped indiscriminately by inaccurate radar methods through cloud cover, resulting in general population destruction. By September 1944, all pretense to precision was abandoned when General Dwight D. Eisenhower ordered the area bombing of Berlin. By that time, bombing had become as much tactical as strategic, to soften Germany for invasion by ground troops. Thousand-bomber raids were not able to diminish industrial production of materiel in time to prevent invasion. When arms production in Germany finally faltered {{in the third quarter of}} 1944, only 30% of the total of eventual bomb tonnage had been dropped on the country—this after the French-German border had been reached <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>war</b> <b>on</b> the ground had seen its decisive breakthrough. Germany was conquered by invasion; it did not surrender solely because of bombing. The morale of the enemy was not significantly affected—no population that was bombed in World War II lost their will to resist, and it was the Emperor, not the people, who decided Japan must surrender.|$|E

500|$|... "Jamestown 2007" [...] marked Virginia's quadricentennial year, celebrating 400 {{years since}} the {{establishment}} of the Jamestown Colony. The celebrations highlighted contributions from Native Americans, Africans, and Europeans, each of which had a significant part in shaping Virginia's history. Warfare, including among these groups, has also had an important role. Virginia was a focal point in conflicts from the French and Indian War, the American Revolution and the Civil War, to the Cold War <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>War</b> <b>on</b> Terrorism. Stories about historic figures, such as those surrounding Pocahontas and John Smith, George Washington's childhood, or the plantation elite in the slave society of the antebellum period, have also created potent myths of state history, and have served as rationales for Virginia's ideology.|$|E
500|$|Nier is {{intended}} to be set over 1000 years after the events of Drakengards fifth ending. In this scenario, the game's protagonists Caim and Angelus travel across a dimensional boundary to fight a monstrous beast. After winning the battle and killing the monster, they are shot down by a fighter jet and killed; their introduction of magic to the world leads to magical research that results in the Black Scrawl. According to Yoko, after the dark story of Drakengard, Yoko focused on more positive themes of friendship and combined effort. Much of the game was inspired by the September 11 attacks <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>War</b> <b>on</b> Terror. Yoko took from it the idea of a terrible event where both sides believed they were doing the right thing, and wanted to show the player multiple perspectives of the same events. The term [...] "Replicant" [...] was borrowed by Yoko from the 1982 science fiction movie Blade Runner, although Yoko did not cite a particular source for Nier's name, passing it off as a codename that persisted through development.|$|E
