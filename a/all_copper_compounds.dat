40|$|International audienceIt {{remains a}} {{challenge}} to understand the unconventional mechanisms that cause high-T(C) superconductivity in cuprate superconductors, high-T(C) multiferroicity in CuO, or low-dimensional magnetism in the spin-Peierls transition compounds such as CuGeO(3). A common feature of <b>all</b> these <b>copper</b> oxide <b>compounds</b> (containing Cu(2 +) ions) {{is the presence of}} large magnetic superexchange interactions J. It is a general strategy to apply chemical and/or physical pressure in order to tune these exotic properties. Here we show theoretically, for the first time, the impact of physical pressure on J on CuO, for which we predict a strong enhancement of the low-dimensionality of the magnetic interactions and the spin-frustration at high-pressures. Such modifications are expected to strongly influence the multiferroic properties of CuO. We finally demonstrate that PBE 0 hybrid DFT calculations provide reliable J values {{for a wide range of}} copper(II) oxides compounds, i. e.

Cu(NO 3) (2), and CuSO 4 were applied in both an aqueous (aq) and solid (s) form, Cu- 2 (OH) (2) (CO 3) was added as a solid. Soil solution was extracted by centrifugation, and analysed for copper. Two extractants [0. 01 M CaCl 2 and 0. 005 M diethylenetriminpentaacetic acid (DTPA) ] were used as a proxy of the bioavailable copper fraction in the soil. For bulk soil copper content the calculated copper toxicity decreased in the order nitrate > sulphide > carbonate, the same order as decreasing solubility of the metal compounds. For Cu(NO 3) (2) and CuSO 4, the LC 50 s obtained were not significantly different when the compound was added in solution or solid form. There was a significant correlation between the soil solution copper concentration and the percentage earthworm mortality for <b>all</b> 3 <b>copper</b> <b>compounds</b> (P {{less than or equal to}} 0. 05) indicating that the soil pore water copper concentration is important for determining copper availability and toxicity to E. fetida.

In soils treated with Cu- 2 (OH 2) CO 3, avoidance behaviour was exhibited at all concentrations greater than or equal to 3500 mug Cu g(- 1).

40|$|In {{the current}} study, the {{toxicity}} mechanismof nanosized CuO (nCuO) to the freshwater ciliated protozoa Tetrahymena thermophila was studied. Changes in fatty acid profile, lipid peroxidation metabolites and {{reactive oxygen species}} (ROS) were measured. Bulk CuO and CuSO 4 served as controls for size and solubility and 3, 5 -dichorophenol (3, 5 -DCP) as a control for a chemical known to directly affect the membrane composition. Exposure to <b>all</b> <b>copper</b> <b>compounds</b> induced the generation of ROS, whereas nCuO was most potent. The latter effect was not solely explained by solubilized Cu-ions and was apparently particle-related. 24 h exposure of protozoa to 80 mg/L of nCuO (EC 50) significantly decreased the proportion of two major unsaturated fatty acids (UFA) (C 18 : 3 cis- 6, 9, 12, C 18 : 2 cis- 9, 12), while it increased the relative amount of two saturated fatty acids (SFA) (C 18 : 0, C 16 : 0). Analogous effect was not observed when protozoa were exposed to equitoxic suspensions of bulk CuO, Cu-ions or 3, 5 -DCP. As changes in the UFA:SFA upon exposure of protozoa to nCuO were not detected at 2 h exposure and no simultaneous dose- or time-dependent lipid peroxidation occurred, {{it is likely that}} one of the adaptation mechanisms of protozoa to nCuO was lowering membrane fluidity by the inhibition of de novo synthesis of fatty acid desaturases.

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} the syntheses, the crystal structures, {{and the physical}} properties of some new ternary and quaternary rare-earth coinage metal arsenides, selenides and oxides. All ternary compounds LnCu 1 +[delta]As 2 (Ln = Y, La, Ce, Nd, Sm, Gd - Lu), LnAg 1 +[delta]As 2 (Ln = La - Nd, Sm), and LnAuAs 2 (Ln = Pr, Sm, Gd, Tb) adopt structures {{closely related to the}} HfCuSi 2 type consisting of PbO-like layers of T and As atoms, square layers of As atoms and layers of Ln atoms separating the former two building units. <b>All</b> <b>copper</b> <b>compounds</b> of this series contain regular square nets of As atoms, whereas the respective nets in the silver and gold compounds are distorted. Two principally different patterns of distortion have been found: [As] zigzag chains in LnAgAs 2 (Ln = Pr, Nd, Sm) and [As] cis-trans chains in LaAg 1. 01 (1) As 2, CeAgAs 2, and PrAuAs 2. Both patterns can undergo a further reduction of symmetry to end up with a pattern of As 2 dumb-bells {{as can be seen in}} SmAuAs 2, GdAuAs 2, and TbAuAs 2. Stoichiometric samples LnCuAs 2 (Ln = Y, Pr, Nd, Sm, Gd, Tb, Dy, Er) have been used for measurements of the conductivity [rho], magnetic susceptibility [chi] and heat capacity cp. All investigated compounds exhibit metallic conductivity and, except for Y, order antiferromagnetically at temperatures below 10 K. In contrast to LnCuAs 2 compounds, the silver compound CeAgAs 2 shows semiconducting behavior throughout the temperature range from 4 to 350 K, whereas in PrAgAs 2 metallic conductivity is preserved. The crystal structure of Sm 2 CuAs 3 O contains two different PbO-like layers formed either by Sm and O or Cu and As atoms. Both PbO-type layers are separated by sheets of Sm and distorted square nets of As atoms. The As atoms are arranged in planar zigzag chains, like those found in NdAgAs 2. Sm 2 CuAs 3 O is thus the first quaternary rare-earth pnictide oxide with a distorted As net. The quaternary potassium rare-earth copper selenides KGd 2 CuSe 4, KLn 2 Cu 3 Se 5 (Ln = Ho, Er, Tm), and K 2 Ln 4 Cu 4 Se 9 (Ln = Dy, Y) extend three series of previously described sulfide and selenide compounds. All three series adopt a three-dimensional tunnel structure built up by [LnSe 6] octahedra and [CuSe 4] tetrahedra. The K atoms reside in the tunnels with a bicapped trigonal prismatic coordination of eight Se atoms for KGd 2 CuSe 4 and KLn 2 Cu 3 Se 5 (Ln = Ho, Er, Tm), while for K 2 Ln 4 Cu 4 Se 9 (Ln = Dy, Y), the K atoms are coordinated by seven Se atoms in monocappped trigonal prisms...|$|E
40|$|In {{the first}} part of this thesis the {{synthesis}} and characterization of metallopolymers and their precursor compounds is described. The pure side chain Schiff base methacrylate based polymers as well as their corresponding monomers are liquid crystalline and show smectic phases near above room temperature. Also some copper(II), nickel(II), and lanthanide(III) low molecular weight monomer model complexes exhibit liquid crystalline phases at quite low temperatures. The synthesized copper(II) polymer complexes are nearly stoichiometric compounds with a metal incorporation rate of nearly 100 %. The structure of <b>all</b> <b>copper</b> containing <b>compounds</b> was investigated with EXAFS spectroscopy. Unexpected magnetic behaviour was detected in all synthesized nickel(II) polymer complexes. All samples are ferromagnetically coupled. Furthermore, the half of all compounds shows maxima in the a. c. susceptibility as well as magnetization hysteresis loops with coercitivities up to 590 Gauss and remanent magnetisations up to 860 emuGauss/mol. The lanthanide(III) polymer complexes are non-stoichiometric compounds without any interesting magnetic properties and without liquid crystalline behaviour. In the seond part of the thesis some magnetic investigations on transition metal complexes are described. Around 10 mononuclear iron(II) containing spin crossover complexes are magnetically characterized. Some relationships between the structure and the physical properties like magnetic behaviour were worked out. Also EXAFS spectroscopy was used for monitoring the spin transition. A new magnetostructural correlation for unsymmetrically hydroxo-, alkoxo-, and phenoxo-bridged dinuclear Fe(III) complexes could be established. It was shown that only the mean iron-oxygen distance over this particular bridge is strongly correlated with the magnitude of the exchange constant J. In a last chapter the magnetic properties of some dinuclear nickel(II), cobalt(II) and heterodinuclear Ni(II) /Co(II) complexes synthesized as model complexes for the inhibited urease are described.
