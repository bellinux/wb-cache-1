5|$|In late 1944 several British {{air attacks}} damaged the U-boat bases in Bergen. During {{one of these}} attacks, a 'Tallboy' bomb went {{straight}} through the roof of pen 3, damaging it beyond repair <b>and</b> <b>putting</b> <b>it</b> out of action {{for the remainder of}} the war. The base was handed over to the Allies, along with the rest of occupied Norway, on 8 May 1945 when all German forces in Europe surrendered. As a result of the intensive bombing of the city in late 1944 and 1945, the Bergen area was one of the worst damaged regions in the south of Norway at the conclusion of the war.|$|E
5|$|Walter de Lacy {{travelled}} to Ireland in 1201 and {{the following}} year his properties, including Ludlow Castle, were once again confiscated to ensure his loyalty and placed {{under the control of}} William de Braose, his father-in-law. Walter's lands were returned to him, subject to the payment of a fine of 400marks, but in 1207 his disagreements with royal officials in Ireland led to King John seizing the castle <b>and</b> <b>putting</b> <b>it</b> under the control of William again. Walter reconciled himself with John the following year, but meanwhile William himself had fallen out with the King; violence broke out and both Walter and William took refuge in Ireland, with John taking control of Ludlow yet again. It was not until 1215 that their relationship recovered and John agreed to give Ludlow back to Walter. At some point during the early 13th century, the innermost bailey was constructed in the castle, creating an additional private space within the inner bailey.|$|E
5|$|Marle awakens in 1A.D. once more, {{this time}} {{witnessing}} her ancestor, Cedric Guardia, brutally unify {{the world with}} the Frozen Flame. A ubiquitous agent from Chronopolis—code-named 12—brings her back to the future. The party learn that the Reptite time travelers—named Cakulha, Coyopa, and Yaluk—survived the human world's restoration, and had been manipulated by King Zeal. The party fix the Mystic War by retrieving the Masamune from Kasmir <b>and</b> <b>putting</b> <b>it</b> back in antiquity. In 1005A.D., new diplomatic talks are about to begin. Porre instead launches an assault, backed by King Zeal and Dalton, placed in Porre's high command by the king. King Guardia dies in the attack. The party venture to 11,995B.C. once more with Schala, intent on striking the Frozen Flame in antiquity to lure out King Zeal. This unleashes wild energies, and the party must overcome individual mental assaults by the Flame. King Zeal retreats, and the energies cause Schala to fall into the Darkness Beyond Time, a temporal netherworld. Unsuccessful, the party seek out Gaspar tens of millions of years in the past (known as the Dreamtime), where he's gone to witness the birth of the planet's consciousness. King Zeal attacks them there; Crono falls near the rifts of the forming planet and is partly infused with its natal awareness. The party learn that King Zeal's ultimate goal is to resurrect the Kingdom of Zeal in 11,995B.C.|$|E

25|$|The US Army Field Manual advises against {{drinking}} urine for survival.

In hot weather survival situations where other sources of water are not available, soaking cloth (a shirt for example) in urine <b>and</b> <b>putting</b> <b>it</b> on the head can help cool the body.|$|E

25|$|The first {{operational}} use of {{the super}} heavy 240mm Howitzer was by the U.S. 5th Army at the Anzio Beachhead in Italy in January 1944. Along with the 8-inch (203mm) gun (which was deployed at Anzio from April 1944) – super heavy artillery was used as counter-battery fire against German guns in their class. Their fire was accurate enough not only to knock enemy artillery out of action, but also to destroy targets as small as German heavy tanks. US super heavy artillery {{also played a role}} in countering the infamous Anzio Annie railway gun <b>and</b> <b>putting</b> <b>it</b> out of action.|$|E
25|$|The 1856 'Name Book' of the OS {{states that}} part of the house of Chapelton (NS 395 441) is {{believed}} to have been a chapel dedicated to the Virgin Mary. Though parts of the building are of great age, it is not certain that this was the chapel; it may have been the residence of the chaplain, while the chapel stood near Chapel Hill. This Chapel Hill is a circular artificial hill. About 1850, Mr. J McAlister raised it to its present height by taking the earth etc. that had slid from its sides, <b>and</b> <b>putting</b> <b>it</b> on the top. While doing this, a quantity of human bones was found near the base on the S and E sides, and also some stones which from their appearance Mr. McAlister thought had been exposed to fire, suggesting that the old chapel was destroyed by fire. Mr. R Miller, a former proprietor, stated that when the present road past Chapel Hill was being made, a quantity of bones was found, giving the idea that there had been a burial ground here.|$|E
25|$|GLaDOS' {{physical}} appearance went through several iterations when Valve had Jason Brashill help drive the visual creation of GLaDOS. Early designs used for her included a floating brain, a spider-like appearance, and an upside-down version of Sandro Botticelli's painting The Birth of Venus {{with the four}} personality cores around her body. Eventually, they settled {{on the design of}} the robotic figure hanging upside down. This was done to convey both a sense of raw mechanical power and femininity. A large disk with the four personality cores hanging from it was added to her design, when she was still just a sphere standing above it. However, the team found it to be too small, giving her a body <b>and</b> <b>putting</b> <b>it</b> below the disk. Another early design was when GLaDOS was only a cube, which was used for the removed laser battle mentioned below. The large chamber that the player-character encounters {{was the result of the}} team wanting to build a space that brought a great deal of attention to her.|$|E

Some of McCain's votes include voting yes on school vouchers in DC, yes on education savings accounts, yes on allowing more flexibility in federal school rules, and voting no on $5 billion for grants to local educational agencies. He supports merit pay for teachers, along with firing them if they don't meet certain standards. He sponsored the Education A-Plus bill in 1997 and again in 1999, which would have allowed parents to open tax-free savings accounts for their children's school expenses, such as tutoring, computers and books. McCain co-sponsored the Child Nutrition Act, which would provide federal funding for at-risk children. He said when running for president in 2000 {{that he would take}} $5.4 billion away from sugar, gas and ethanol subsidies and pour that money into a test voucher program for every poor school district in America. He voted against diverting $51.9 million away from the Department of Labor <b>and</b> <b>putting</b> <b>it</b> towards after-school community learning centers, and he voted against an amendment which would fund smaller class sizes rather than providing funds for private tutors.|$|E

So instead of trying to evolve the series necessarily, it's more like taking that concept <b>and</b> <b>putting</b> <b>it</b> in different places – seeing how it works." [...] Kanno is considering bringing the title to newer consoles, but would want to be able to include multiplayer features and having a time cycle within the game that would affect passengers' attitudes and the environment of the game.|$|E

500|$|Although Steven Spielberg {{initially}} negotiated {{to direct}} the film, he declined the offer. Spielberg reportedly wanted the adaptation to be an animated film, with American actor Haley Joel Osment to provide Harry Potter's voice, or a film that incorporated elements from subsequent books as well. Spielberg contended that, in his opinion, it was like [...] "shooting ducks in a barrel. It's just a slam dunk. It's just like withdrawing a billion dollars <b>and</b> <b>putting</b> <b>it</b> into your personal bank accounts. There's no challenge." [...] Rowling maintains {{that she had no}} role in choosing directors for the films and that [...] "nyone who thinks I could (or would) have 'veto-ed' [...] him [...] needs their Quick-Quotes Quill serviced." [...] Heyman recalled that Spielberg decided to direct A.I. Artificial Intelligence instead.|$|E
500|$|Car {{scenes were}} filmed with a [...] "biscuit rig," [...] a camera car rig {{developed}} for the film Seabiscuit (2003), which allowed stunt driver Robert Nagle to steer the car, freeing Gosling to concentrate on acting. Consistent with Refn's usual visual style, wide-angle lenses were used heavily by cinematographer Newton Thomas Sigel, who avoided hand-held camera work. Preferring to keep the film more [...] "grounded" [...] and authentic, he also avoided using of computer-generated imagery (CGI). Budget restrictions were also a factor in this decision. Although many stunt drivers are credited, Gosling did some stunts himself, after completing a stunt driving car crash course. During the production, Gosling re-built the 1973 Chevrolet Malibu used in the film, taking it apart <b>and</b> <b>putting</b> <b>it</b> back together. Filming concluded on November 12, 2010.|$|E
