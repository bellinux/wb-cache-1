5|$|Following {{a wave of}} {{political}} reforms in the late 1990s, Antara began to produce its reporting independently {{of the government and}} was reorganized as a state-owned enterprise in 2007. However, media scholars <b>argue</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> lengthy relationship with the government makes it difficult for the agency to become an unbiased news organization. Antara celebrated its 75th anniversary on 13December 2012.|$|E
5|$|The early texts do {{not contain}} just-war {{ideology}} as such. Some <b>argue</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> sutta in the Gamani Samyuttam rules out all military service. In this passage, a soldier asks the Buddha {{if it is true}} that, as he has been told, soldiers slain in battle are reborn in a heavenly realm. The Buddha reluctantly replies that if he is killed in battle while his mind is seized with the intention to kill, he will undergo an unpleasant rebirth. In the early texts, a person's mental state at the time of death is generally viewed as having a great impact on the next birth.|$|E
5|$|When {{stars are}} moving at {{sufficiently}} high peculiar velocities, their astrospheres can generate bow shocks as they collide with the interstellar medium. For decades {{it was assumed}} that the Sun had a bow shock. In 2012, data from Interstellar Boundary Explorer (IBEX) and NASA's Voyager probes showed that the Sun's bow shock does not exist. Instead, these authors <b>argue</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> subsonic bow wave defines the transition from the solar wind flow to the interstellar medium. A bow shock is the third boundary of an astrosphere after the termination shock and the astropause (called the heliopause in the Solar System).|$|E

5|$|The {{predicted}} {{effects of}} the FairTax {{are a source of}} disagreement among economists and other analysts. According to Money magazine, while many economists and tax experts support the idea of a consumption tax, many of them view the FairTax proposal as having serious problems with evasion and revenue neutrality. Some economists <b>argue</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> consumption tax (the FairTax is one such tax) would {{have a positive effect on}} economic growth, incentives for international business to locate in the U.S., and increased U.S. international competitiveness (border tax adjustment in global trade). The FairTax would be tax-free on mortgage interest (up to a basic interest rate) and donations, but some lawmakers have concerns about losing tax incentives on home ownership and charitable contributions. There is also concern about the effect on the income tax industry and the difficulty of repealing the Sixteenth Amendment (to prevent Congress from re-introducing an income tax).|$|E
25|$|However, some {{defenders}} <b>argue</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> {{policy of}} rhetoric while doing things {{counter to the}} rhetoric was necessary {{in the sense of}} realpolitik and helped secure victory against the dangers of tyranny and totalitarianism.|$|E

25|$|Labiaplasty is a {{controversial}} subject. Critics <b>argue</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> woman's decision to undergo the procedure stems from an unhealthy self-image induced by their comparison of {{themselves to the}} prepubescent-like images of women they see in commercials or pornography.|$|E

25|$|Advocates, notably Keynes, of {{a global}} {{currency}} often argue that such a currency would not suffer from inflation, which, in extreme cases, has had disastrous effects for economies.

25|$|Some economists <b>argue</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> single world {{currency}} is unnecessary, because the U.S. dollar is providing {{many of the}} benefits of a world currency while avoiding some of the costs. If the world does not form an optimum currency area, then it would be economically inefficient for the world to share one currency.|$|E
25|$|Some historians <b>argue</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> more {{significant}} move towards independence {{in a practical}} rather than legal sense came in 1973, when Britain joined the European Economic Community.

25|$|Many <b>argue</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> {{drive to}} attract ethnic Kazakhs northward {{was the key}} factor in {{shifting}} the capital, which was officially put down to lack of space for expansion in the former capital, Almaty, and its location in an earthquake zone.
