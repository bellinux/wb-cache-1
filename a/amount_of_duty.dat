5000|$|The {{first phase}} in crew {{planning}} is building the crew pairings (also known as trips, rotations, among other popular descriptions). This process pairs a generic crew member with a flight {{so that at}} the end of this process all aircraft flights are covered and all trips (combination of flights starting at a crew base and returning to that crew base or co-terminal are crew legal. The next step is the allocation of those trips to the individual crewmember. For the US, Canada and Australia, seniority generally rules. The two processes (which are completely different) are referred to as bid lines and preferential bidding. In seniority order, pilots bid for either a line of time (bidline) or trips and days off (preferential bidding. these are awarded based on seniority and modified only when their selections have already been taken by a more senior crew member (bidlines) or their trip and day off selections (preferential bidding) do not make up a complete line (hours, days off, etc. parameters agreed to by the company and the union). The senior folks have more time off, better choice of time off and fly better trips than the junior crew members, generally speaking. In the US, this is considered fair. For European airlines and other airlines in the rest of the world, the allocation process is completely different. The company builds the pilot schedules directly to meet their needs, not the pilot's needs. Before assigning a single trip, the schedulers put all planned absences (vacation, training, etc.) onto the crew members' schedule. Only then are trips assigned to the individual crew members. As such, fairness means that the most senior captain and the most junior captain have the same <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>duty</b> time, block hours, night time, time away from base, layovers, expense pay, etc. in a given schedule period. Seniority is out and all work is completely homogenized. For them, anything else is unfair, undemocratic. Slowly over the last thirty years, foreign airlines using the [...] "no seniority" [...] rostering system have allowed some measure of seniority to creep into the allocation process from pilots who may now ask for a specific day off or trip once a quarter or make multiple requests within a schedule period. Although this may sound very much like preferential bidding, it is not. The disparity between junior and senior crew members is still very limited and thus achievement of your choices is limited.|$|E

This machine-readable version of John Williams' Digest of Welsh Historical Statistics {{is the result of}} a collaboration between the Statistical Directorate of the National Assembly for Wales, the History Data Service and the Centre for Data Digitisation and Analysis at Queen's University Belfast. John Williams' Digest of Welsh Historical Statistics is intended to provide a service for those working on the history of modern Wales. It arises from a belief that the quantitative element is a necessary and important part of the historical record; from an awareness that it was an aspect that was particularly inaccessible for scholars of Welsh history; and from a conviction that some encouragement in the use of quantitative material was necessary. It is modelled on the two volumes dedicated to British historical statistics: Mitchell, B. R. and Deane, P. (1962) Abstract of British historical statistics and Mitchell, B. R. and Jones, H. G. (1971) Second abstract of British historical statistics. Main Topics : The main tables are: Number of houses, inhabited, uninhabited (and building, 1811 - 1921), by county, 1801 - 1971 (a) Number of private households, by county, 1801 - 1901; (b) number of private households, dwellings, rooms and density of occupation, by county, 1911 - 1971 Number of rooms occupied by private households, by county, 1911 - 1971 Brick production: (a) return of duties paid on bricks, by region, 1829 - 1849; (b) number of bricks and <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>duty</b> paid, by county, 1836 - 1846 Number of house plans approved, by town, South Wales, 1851 - 1914 Estimated costs of building plans passed by Urban Districts, by type of building, 1909 - 1939 Total number of houses built in inter-war years, by county, 1919 - 1940 Number of houses authorised, under construction and completed, local authority and private enterprise, 1919 - 1939 and 1946 - 1974; by county 1919 - 1939; by county borough 1919 - 1939; number of houses demolished 1947 - 1974 Decisions on planning applications, by type of development, 1962 - 1972 Houses completed, by number of bedrooms, public and (from 1963) private sectors, houses and flats, 1945 - 1974 Government financial contributions, new houses and improvement grants, 1950 - 1974 Number of conversions and improvements, approved for grant, by public and private sector, 1955 - 1974 Prices and costs, 1958 - 1974 Please note: this study does not include information on named individuals and would therefore not be useful for personal family history research. <br...|$|E

The treaty not only stipulated that the <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>duties</b> on Portuguese wines was to never be more than two-thirds that of which was levied on French wines, it also allowed English woolen cloth to be admitted into Portugal free <b>of</b> <b>duty.</b> This second stipulation ended up having a devastating effect on the Portuguese textile industry, leading to huge numbers of shepherds and weavers becoming unemployed. In and around the Douro region, this segment of labor turned to the wine industry and encouraged a boom in vineyard planting.

In cooperation with the Student Affairs Office, the exact weighted average grade of the students who participated in the test verification was used as well as the information about the <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> study <b>duties</b> (exams, course credits) fulfilled on the first attempt, and also the results in the entrance test of General Academic Prerequisites, which is similar to the GRE (Graduate Record Examinations) test model that is used in tertiary education in the United States. 82 college students participated in the study. In the framework of data analysis, the goal was to find an answer to the following question: Is there a statistically significant correlation between school performance of college students and the results of the chosen psychological test? The data analysis indicates that a higher rate of conscientiousness contributes to having a better (lower) weighted average grade and a higher <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> study <b>duties</b> fulfilled on the first attempt.
