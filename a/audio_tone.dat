25|$|Using U0 126, {{researchers}} {{were able to}} selectively knock out a fear memory for a specific <b>audio</b> <b>tone</b> and leave a fear memory for another <b>audio</b> <b>tone</b> {{in a group of}} rats. This was observed by recording brain activity in the amygdala of these rats when presented with tones they had been conditioned to fear.|$|E
25|$|Morse code {{is usually}} heard at the {{receiver}} as a medium-pitched on/off <b>audio</b> <b>tone</b> (600–1000Hz), so transmissions {{are easier to}} copy than voice through the noise on congested frequencies, {{and it can be}} used in very high noise / low signal environments. The transmitted power is concentrated into a limited bandwidth so narrow receiver filters can be used to suppress interference from adjacent frequencies. The <b>audio</b> <b>tone</b> is usually created by use of a beat frequency oscillator.|$|E
25|$|A PSK31 {{operator}} typically uses a single-sideband (SSB) transceiver {{connected to}} the sound card of a computer running PSK31 software. When the operator enters a message for transmission, the software produces an <b>audio</b> <b>tone</b> that sounds, to the human ear, like a continuous whistle with a slight warble. This sound is then fed through either a microphone jack (using an intermediate resistive attenuator to reduce the sound card's output power to microphone levels) or an auxiliary connection into the transceiver, from which it is transmitted.|$|E
25|$|The modem would {{generate}} <b>audio</b> <b>tones</b> between 1200 and 2300Hz from picture signals, and picture signals from received <b>audio</b> <b>tones.</b> The <b>audio</b> would {{be attached to}} a radio receiver and transmitter.|$|R

50|$|A cue tone is {{a message}} {{consisting}} of <b>audio</b> <b>tones,</b> used to prompt an action.|$|R
25|$|Since the {{sidebands}} are on {{both sides}} of the carrier, their count is doubled, and then multiplied by the modulating frequency to find the bandwidth. For example, 3kHz deviation modulated by a 2.2kHz <b>audio</b> <b>tone</b> produces a modulation index of 1.36. Suppose that we limit ourselves to only those sidebands that have a relative amplitude of at least 0.01. Then, examining the chart shows this modulation index will produce three sidebands. These three sidebands, when doubled, gives us (6 * 2.2kHz) or a 13.2kHz required bandwidth.|$|E
25|$|A study {{conducted}} by Jeff Miller and Judy Trevena (2009) suggests that the Bereitschaftspotential (BP) signal in Libet's experiments doesn't represent a decision to move, but that it's merely {{a sign that the}} brain is paying attention. In this experiment the classical Libet experiment was modified by playing an <b>audio</b> <b>tone</b> indicating to volunteers to decide whether to tap a key or not. The researchers found that there was the same RP signal in both cases, {{regardless of whether or not}} volunteers actually elected to tap, which suggests that the RP signal doesn't indicate that a decision has been made.|$|E
500|$|WWV and WWVH {{transmit}} 44 {{seconds of}} <b>audio</b> <b>tone</b> in most minutes. [...] It begins after the 1-second minute mark and continues until {{the beginning of}} the WWVH time announcement 45 seconds after the minute.|$|E

500|$|The Ambrose Channel pilot cable, {{also called}} the Ambrose Channel leader cable, was a cable laid in Ambrose Channel at the {{entrance}} to the Port of New York and New Jersey that provided an <b>audio</b> <b>tone</b> for guiding ships in and out of port at times of low visibility. The cable was laid during 1919 and 1920; [...] it had been removed from the Channel and replaced by wireless technology by the end of the 1920s.|$|E
500|$|A binary-coded decimal {{time code}} began testing in 1960, and became {{permanent}} in 1961. This [...] "NASA time code" [...] was modulated onto a 1000Hz <b>audio</b> <b>tone</b> at 100Hz, sounding somewhat like a monotonous repeated [...] "baaga-bong". The code was also described as {{sounding like a}} [...] "buzz-saw". On July 1, 1971, the time code's broadcast was changed to the present 100Hz subcarrier, which is inaudible when using a normal radio (but can be heard using headphones or recorded using a chart recorder).|$|E
500|$|Each Adcock range station {{had four}} [...] antenna towers erected on {{the corners of}} a 425× 425ft square, with an {{optional}} extra tower in the center for voice transmission and homing. The stations emitted directional electromagnetic radiation at 190 to 535 kHz and 1,500watts, into four quadrants. The radiation of one opposing quadrant pair was modulated (at an audio frequency of 1,020Hz) with a Morse code for the letter A (·—), and the other pair with the letter N (—·). The intersections between the quadrants defined four course lines emanating from the transmitting station, along four compass directions, where the A and N signals were of equal intensity, with their combined Morse codes merging into a steady 1,020Hz <b>audio</b> <b>tone.</b> These course lines (also called [...] "legs"), where only a tone could be heard, defined the airways.|$|E
50|$|The {{distinctive}} <b>audio</b> <b>tones</b> of Eurosignal were sampled by the French electronica duo Air {{for their}} musical composition Les professionals on their album Moon Safari (1988).|$|R
50|$|An {{individual}} aircraft {{has its own}} assigned SELCAL code. To initiate a SELCAL transmission, a ground station radio operator enters an aircraft's SELCAL code into a SELCAL encoder. The encoder converts the four-letter code into four designated <b>audio</b> <b>tones.</b> The radio operator's transmitter then broadcasts the <b>audio</b> <b>tones</b> on the aircraft's company radio frequency channel in sequence: the first pair of tones are transmitted simultaneously, lasting about one second; a silence of about 0.2 seconds; followed by the second pair of tones, lasting about one second.|$|R
50|$|R2 {{register}} signalling {{is a family}} of protocols that govern the conveyance of addressing information during the addressing phase and how the call attempt turned out during the disposition phase. Although in the 1960s R2 {{register signalling}} was represented by electromechanical devices that could generate multi-frequency <b>audio</b> <b>tones</b> and by electromechanical devices that could detect those <b>audio</b> <b>tones,</b> by the latter 1970s these electromechanical registers also could be represented by digitized PCM audio in DS0 channels of an E1 other than the R2 line signalling DS0 channel in that E1.|$|R
2500|$|Morse code can be {{transmitted}} {{in a number of}} ways: originally as electrical pulses along a telegraph wire, but also as an <b>audio</b> <b>tone,</b> a radio signal with short and long tones, or as a mechanical, audible, or visual signal (e.g. a flashing light) using devices like an Aldis lamp or a heliograph, a common flashlight, or even a car horn. [...] Some mine rescues have used pulling on a rope - a short pull for a dot and a long pull for a dash.|$|E

5000|$|The {{station is}} {{especially}} famous or infamous (depending {{on the point}} of view) for its now-discontinued practices of airing subliminal messages intended to induce relaxation at night [...] and using a system of <b>audio</b> <b>tones</b> as a mosquito repellent.|$|R
5000|$|The <b>audio</b> <b>tones</b> sent {{during the}} first 45 seconds of most minutes are swapped: [...] is played during even minutes, and [...] is played during odd minutes. (Receiving both {{simultaneously}} gives the listener a sound similar to a continuously-ringing chime.) ...|$|R
50|$|Selcall (selective calling) {{is a type}} of squelch {{protocol}} used {{in radio}} communications systems, in which transmissions include a brief burst of sequential <b>audio</b> <b>tones.</b> Receivers that are set to respond to the transmitted tone sequence will open their squelch, while others will remain muted.|$|R

50|$|A {{terminal}} node controller (TNC) is a device used by amateur radio operators {{to participate in}} AX.25 packet radio networks.

5000|$|The '9600 port' (also named data-jack or data-port) is an industry-specific name {{given to}} a special {{connector}} {{on the back of}} amateur radio HF, VHF, and UHF transceivers.

50|$|Simply put, MCW uses a fixed <b>audio</b> <b>tone</b> to {{modulate}} a carrier wave. This is an older method of sending Morse code, with continuous wave being {{the more common}} method used today.|$|E

50|$|The Operating System {{sets the}} speaker bit during the Vertical Blank routine. Repeatedly writing 0 to the bit {{will produce a}} 60 Hz buzzing sound as the Vertical Blank resets the value.
