500|$|In 2010 Entertainment Weekly {{reported}} a planned spin-off television series, 2013, {{which would have}} been a sequel to the film. 2012 executive producer Mark Gordon told the magazine, [...] "ABC will have an opening in their disaster-related programming after Lost ends, so people would be interested in this topic on a weekly basis. There's hope for the world despite the magnitude of the 2012 disaster as seen in the film.

500|$|In his 1910 book, The Constitutional Law of the United States, Westel W. Willoughby {{noted that}} the court's ruling that an {{elective}} office was not property was at odds with previous decisions in which it had assumed jurisdiction in cases between two contestants for an office to determine if due process was granted. By assuming jurisdiction in these cases, Willoughby claimed, the court had given elective offices standing as property. Accordingly, Justice Joseph McKenna issued a separate concurring opinion in which he stated: [...] "I agree fully with those decisions which are referred to , and which hold that as between the State and the office holder there is no contract right either to the term of office or {{to the amount of}} salary, and that the legislature may, if not restrained by constitutional provisions, abolish the office or reduce the salary. But when the office is not disturbed, when the salary is not changed, and when, under the Constitution of the State, neither can be by the legislature, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>question</b> <b>is</b> simply whether one shall be deprived of that office and its salary, and both given to another, a different question is presented, and in such a case to hold that the incumbent has no property in the office, with its accompanying salary, does not commend itself to my judgment." ...|$|E

2500|$|By {{its very}} nature, conceptualizing a demand curve {{requires}} that the purchaser be a perfect competitor—that is, that the purchaser has no influence over the market price.

2500|$|No {{approximation}} algorithms for computing [...] {{are known}} for any x except for the three easy points. At the integer points , the corresponding decision problem of deciding if a given graph can be k-colored is NP-hard. Such problems cannot be approximated to any multiplicative factor by a bounded-error probabilistic algorithm unless NP=RP, because any multiplicative approximation would distinguish the values 0 and 1, effectively solving the decision version in bounded-error probabilistic polynomial time. In particular, under the same assumption, this rules {{out the possibility of}} a fully polynomial time randomised approximation scheme (FPRAS). For other points, more complicated arguments are needed, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>question</b> <b>is</b> the focus of active research. , it is known that there is no FPRAS for computing [...] for any x > 2, unless NP=RP holds.|$|E
2500|$|The cell {{cultures}} of some viral vaccines, and the virus of the rubella vaccine, {{are derived from}} tissues taken from therapeutic abortions performed in the 1960s, leading to moral questions. For example, the principle of double effect, originated by Thomas Aquinas, holds that actions with {{both good and bad}} consequences are morally acceptable in specific circumstances, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>question</b> <b>is</b> how this principle applies to vaccination. The Vatican Curia has expressed concern about the rubella vaccine's embryonic cell origin, saying that Catholics have [...] "a grave responsibility to use alternative vaccines and to make a conscientious objection with regard to those which have moral problems". The Vatican concluded that until an alternative becomes available, it is acceptable for Catholics to use the existing vaccine, writing, [...] "This is an unjust alternative choice, which must be eliminated as soon as possible." ...|$|E
2500|$|Despite these advances, {{there are}} certain skills to which humans will be better suited than {{machines}} {{for some time to}} come <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>question</b> <b>is</b> how to achieve the best combination of human and robot skills. The advantages of robotics include heavy-duty jobs with precision and repeatability, whereas the advantages of humans include creativity, decision-making, flexibility and adaptability. This need to combine optimal skills has resulted in collaborative robots and humans sharing a common workspace more closely and led to the development of new approaches and standards to guarantee the safety of the [...] "man-robot merger". Some European countries are including robotics in their national programmes and trying to promote a safe and flexible co-operation between robots and operators to achieve better productivity. For example, the German Federal Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (BAuA) organises annual workshops on the topic [...] "human-robot collaboration".|$|E
