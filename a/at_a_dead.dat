5|$|As the {{campaign}} entered its final week, polls showed Specter and Sestak <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>dead</b> heat, with different surveys reporting contradictory findings over which candidate maintained a slight edge. A Quinnipiac University poll found Specter leading 44-42 percent, with fourteen percent undecided, whereas a Franklin & Marshall poll found Sestak ahead 38-36 percent, {{with about a}} quarter of voters undecided. In both cases, the lead fell within the survey's margin of error. G. Terry Madonna, director of the Franklin & Marshall poll, said that Sestak improved because his television commercials were resonating with voters on three fronts: the arguments that Specter switched parties for solely political reasons, that he consistently voted for Republican policies and that he had been in office too long.|$|E
5|$|From {{this point}} {{west to the}} highway's end on Long Island Sound, CR101 follows a mostly east–west {{alignment}} through Sands Point. Along this last stretch, the route passes {{to the south of}} Sands Point County Park and north past Sands Point Golf Club as the surroundings around the route become increasingly forested and undeveloped. At Tibbits Lane, the route turns to the northwest and continues to the road's end <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>dead</b> end on the southern shore of Long Island Sound.|$|E
5|$|NY421 begins <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>dead</b> end {{south of}} the hamlet of Horseshoe in an {{isolated}} part {{of the town of}} Piercefield. Here, the highway connects to a pair of dirt roads, one of which leads north alongside Horseshoe Lake to Horseshoe. The two-lane route heads eastward from the trails, following the southern shore of Horseshoe Lake while traversing the deep woods of Adirondack Park. At the southeastern end of the lake, NY421 turns northeastward, crossing a small stream feeding into the lake before curving back toward the east. For the next , the road passes through unabated wilderness as it heads toward the western shoreline of Tupper Lake.|$|E

5|$|The {{entirety}} of SR357 exists {{within the confines}} of South Bass Island in Lake Erie. It is located within Put-in-Bay Township in Ottawa County. In 2012, between 490 and 590 vehicles travel on the road on average each day. SR 357 begins at West Shore Boulevard, and travels southwestward. The route passes by Oak Point State Park, and becomes part of Bayview Avenue. SR 357 then intersects County Route 163, which leads to the Put-in-Bay Airport, and the Put-in-Bay–Catawba Island ferry. The route later leaves Put-in-Bay, near Perry's Victory and International Peace Memorial. SR 357 turns northeast to Columbus Avenue, and later ends <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>dead</b> end near the lake, next to a driveway.|$|E
5|$|MD363 begins <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>dead</b> {{end in the}} {{community}} of Wenona {{at the southern end of}} Deal Island. The state highway heads north, sharply curving before crossing Middle Creek. The road runs through another series of sharp curves through marshland before straightening out and passing St. John's Methodist Episcopal Church and the old post office building, two examples of buildings on the island preserved as part of the Deal Island Historic District. The route passes a boat ramp accessed from Ralph Abbott Road before a high-level bridge carries it over Upper Thorofare, a strait between Laws Cove and Tangier Sound. On the north side of the bridge, MD363 intersects MD363A, the northern approach to the previous bridge to Deal Island, before passing through {{the community}} of Chance, the site of Rock Creek Methodist Episcopal Church. After passing Haines Point Road, which leads to a large public boat ramp, the state highway continues northeast across the two branches of Rock Creek and through more marshland before entering Dames Quarter. MD363 traverses Dames Quarter Creek and passes through Deal Island Wildlife Management Area.|$|E

5|$|The first {{segments}} of road {{appeared in the}} location of what would become RE11 by 1940. The southern road segment began at an at-grade intersection, near the location of RE11, and traveled northward, before traveling slightly westward and terminating <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>dead</b> end. The road was graded and drained, and had a gravel surface, with a cattle guard near the middle of it. The northern segment of road traveled near the location of RE11. This road was also graded and drained, and had three cattle guards located along its course. By 1951, a gate had {{been added to the}} southern road segment, and the northern segment had several turns straightened and lengthened. On October 28, 1953, RM 2134 was designated from Millersview along a road to the northern segment of what would become RE11. On August 24, 1955, the highway was designated along the northern segment of road, to the Colorado River. The designation was made official on October 1, 1955.|$|E
5|$|MD355 is the {{original}} route of US 240, which was planned in 1926 to run from Washington, D.C. north to Harrisburg, Pennsylvania; however, the route was designated a part of US15 north of Frederick. This route served as the primary connector linking Frederick and points west to Washington, D.C. During the 1950s, US 240 was relocated in stages to the Washington National Pike, a freeway between Bethesda and Frederick shared with I-70S (now I-270). MD 355 was designated onto the former alignment of US 240 between Bethesda and Frederick as each stage of freeway was built. MD 355 was also designated through Frederick along Market Street, which was the former alignment of US 15 through the city before it was moved to a bypass in 1959. US 240 was decommissioned in 1972, and MD 355 was extended south along the former US 240 to the Washington, D.C. border. In 2006, the interchange with US15 at the route’s northern terminus was removed, resulting in MD355 ending just short of US 15 <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>dead</b> end. By 2009, a four lane divided bypass of Urbana for MD355, funded by private developers, was completed. The former alignment of MD355 through Urbana was designated as MD355 Business (MD355 Bus.) The same year, the portion of MD355 north of I-70 {{was transferred to the}} city of Frederick and is no longer considered part of the route.|$|E

25|$|Garcia's artistic endeavors were {{represented}} by the Weir Gallery in Berkeley, California from 1989 to 1996. During this period, Roberta Weir (unrelated to Garcia's bandmate) provided Garcia with new art techniques to use, sponsored his first solo show in 1990, and prepared blank etching plates for him to draw on. These would then be processed and printed by gallery staff and brought back to Garcia for approval and signature, usually with a passing of stacks of paper backstage <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>Dead</b> show. His annual shows at the Weir Gallery garnered much attention, leading to further shows in New York and other cities. Garcia was an early adopter of digital art media; his artistic style was as varied as his musical output, and he carried small notebooks for pen and ink sketches wherever he toured. Roberta Weir continues to maintain an archive of the artwork of Jerry Garcia.|$|E
25|$|MD 980B begins <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>dead</b> end at a gate {{just north}} of Lyons Creek.
