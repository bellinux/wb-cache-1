50|$|Production {{was split}} between the Alfa Romeo plant in Arese and Carrozzeria Bertone's plants in Caselle and Grugliasco outside Turin. Alfa Romeo {{produced}} the chassis <b>and</b> engine <b>and</b> <b>mechanicals</b> <b>and</b> sent the chassis to Caselle where Bertone fitted the body. After body fitment, the car was sent to Grugliasco to be degreased, partly zinc coated, manually spray painted and have the interior fitted. Finally, the car was returned to Arese to have the engine <b>and</b> <b>mechanicals</b> installed. It {{is worth noting that}} because of this production method, there is not necessarily any correspondence between chassis number, engine number and production date.|$|R

40|$|Abstract: The {{customer}} {{is the starting}} point for green design of electromechanical product demand, also the bridge of connecting to the market <b>and</b> the <b>mechanical</b> <b>and</b> electrical product development process. Enterprises effectively obtain and understand customer needs, and accurately define the demand information of <b>mechanical</b> <b>and</b> electrical products in the design process, which is the necessary precondition for the successful design of <b>mechanical</b> <b>and</b> electrical products in the global market environment. The designer obtains accurately and effectively information of demand of <b>mechanical</b> <b>and</b> electrical products, which is an important link of product design process. It will also directly affect the subsequent steps in the process of product development. Therefore, all aspects of <b>mechanical</b> <b>and</b> electrical products manufacturing enterprises work should depend on customer demand. To meet the design idea of customer demand should be fully integrated into every link in the development of <b>mechanical</b> <b>and</b> electrical products. Enterprise can not only shorten the time of <b>mechanical</b> <b>and</b> electrical products, but also {{have a significant impact on}} the design of <b>mechanical</b> <b>and</b> electrical products quality...|$|R
