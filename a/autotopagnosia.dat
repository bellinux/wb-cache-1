25|$|<b>Autotopagnosia</b> {{typically}} occurs after left parietal lesions. Patients {{with this}} disorder make errors which result from confusion between adjacent body parts. For example, a patient may point to their knee {{when asked to}} point to their hip. Because the disorder involves the body schema, localization errors may be made both on the patient’s own body and that of others. The spatial unity of the body within the body schema has been damaged such that it has incorrectly been segmented in relation to its other modular parts.|$|E
50|$|As <b>autotopagnosia</b> {{arises from}} {{neurological}} and irreversible damage, options regarding symptom reversal or control are limited. As of April 2010, {{there are no}} known specific treatments for <b>autotopagnosia.</b>|$|E
50|$|Typically, {{the cause}} of <b>autotopagnosia</b> is a lesion found in the parietal lobe of the left {{hemisphere}} of the brain. However, it as also been noted that patients with generalized brain damage present with similar symptoms of <b>autotopagnosia.</b>|$|E
5000|$|<b>Autotopagnosia</b> {{from the}} Greek a and gnosis, meaning [...] "without knowledge", topos meaning [...] "place", and auto meaning [...] "oneself", <b>autotopagnosia</b> {{virtually}} translates to the [...] "lack {{of knowledge about}} one's own space," [...] and is clinically described as such.|$|E
50|$|Due to the {{subjective}} nature of <b>autotopagnosia,</b> {{there are many}} hypotheses presented as to the underlying causation. Since the condition by definition is an inability to recognize {{the human body and}} its parts, the disorder could stem from a language deficit specific to body parts. On the other hand, the patient could suffer from a disrupted body image or a variation of the inability to separate parts from whole. It is also believed that <b>autotopagnosia</b> has multiple underlying causes that cannot be categorized as either language-specific or body-image-specific. The rarity of <b>autotopagnosia,</b> frequently combined with the manifestation of other psychoneurological disorders, makes the prime cause extremely difficult to study. In many cases, one of these accompanying conditions—often aphasia—could be masking the patient’s <b>autotopagnosia</b> altogether.|$|E
50|$|Until the 1980s, {{there had}} been no scientifically {{accredited}} cases of <b>autotopagnosia,</b> rather agnosias that have been secondary to other neurological deficits such as dementia. In fact the term <b>autotopagnosia</b> does not appear until Pick’s studies in 1908 and 1922. More recently, Carlos Semenza (2003) has expanded on Pick’s theories.|$|E
50|$|Some {{patients}} {{demonstrating the}} symptoms of <b>autotopagnosia</b> have a decreased ability to locate parts of other multipart object. Patients are considered to suffer from “pure” <b>autotopagnosia,</b> however, if their deficiency is specific to body part localization. Patients suffering from “pure” <b>autotopagnosia</b> often have no problems carrying out tasks involved in everyday life that require body part awareness. Patients have difficulty locating body parts when directly asked, but can carry out activities such as putting on pants without difficulty. Patients can describe the function and appearance of body parts, yet they are still unable to locate them.|$|E
5000|$|As <b>autotopagnosia</b> {{is not a}} {{life-threatening}} condition it {{is not on the}} forefront of medical research. Rather, more research is conducted regarding treatments and therapies to alleviate the lesions and traumas that can cause <b>autotopagnosia.</b> Of all the agnosias, visual agnosia is the most common subject of investigation because it is easiest to assess and has the most promise for potential treatments. Most <b>autotopagnosia</b> studies are centered on a few test subjects as {{part of a group of}} unaffected or “controlled” participants, or a simple case study. Case studies surrounding a single patient are most common due to the vague nature of the disease.|$|E
50|$|Ennio De Renzi worked {{extensively}} with {{a variety}} of agnosias in 1963 and 1970. He explored, on two patients with <b>autotopagnosia</b> in particular, the difficulties of mentally recognizing the physical division of a whole object into sections. For example, he found his patients could not describe the position or parts of a bike, and were unable to focus on a part of the whole. De Renzi’s studies gave way to countless others to give insight as to the complicated and varied mechanisms behind <b>autotopagnosia.</b>|$|E
5000|$|<b>Autotopagnosia</b> {{is a form}} of agnosia, {{characterized}} by an inability to localize and orient different parts of the body. The psychoneurological disorder has also been referred to as [...] "body-image agnosia" [...] or [...] "somatotopagnosia." [...] Somatotopagnosia has been argued to be a better suited term to describe the condition. While <b>autotopagnosia</b> emphasizes the deficiencies in localizing only one's own body parts and orientation, somatotopagnosia also considers the inability to orient and recognize the body parts of others or representations of the body (e.g., manikins, diagrams).|$|E
50|$|Although it {{is still}} unclear what precise deficits in brain {{function}} cause the symptoms of <b>autotopagnosia,</b> the location of brain damage is not as ambiguous. <b>Autotopagnosia</b> is most often attributed to lesions in the parietal lobe of the left hemisphere of the brain. However, it is also believed that the disorder {{can be caused by}} general brain damage as well. Many different types of brain lesions can cause autotopagnosia; however, neoplastic lesions seem to be the most common. “Pure” <b>autotopagnosia</b> is often seen with smaller lesions, as larger lesions tend to create other unseen deficits that can confuse or mask the appearance of the symptoms of autotopagnosia—such as aphasia, as discussed above.The parietal lobe is involved in the integration of sensory information and visuospatial processing. The left parietal lobe, specifically, is important to the understanding of language and mathematics, and has a more prominent role for right handed people.|$|E
50|$|Carlo Semenza (1988) {{analyzed}} the deficits associated with patients presenting with <b>autotopagnosia</b> {{compared with the}} test results of non-afflicted patients. He found the majority of testing errors for patients with <b>autotopagnosia</b> were either spatial (contiguity) or functional (conceptual), and there were few examples of random error. Similar to other studies, Semenza used both verbal and non-verbal commands and applied tests of verification, construction and description to his patients, at a complex and body specific representational system, stored in the left parietal lobe, is responsible for mediating simple body location tasks. He theorized that the spatial and functional errors were due to the concept that one’s knowledge of one’s body is stored apart from other knowledge. This knowledge is then organized into a set of ideas, which represent a single body part, and parts of similar functionality are closely related despite actual spatial distances on the body. Semenza (2003) investigated Pick’s original work surrounding the discovery of <b>autotopagnosia.</b>|$|E
50|$|Head and Holme's studies (1911) were {{developed}} alongside those of Arnold Pick (1851-1924), {{who was the}} first to describe <b>autotopagnosia</b> (1908) as the inability to locate body parts on command on a whole body structure.Pick noted those afflicted with <b>autotopagnosia</b> as having a dissociation between the capacity to recognize and name their own body part (as commanded by an examiner) and the inability to find the same body part on command. In a series of studies, Pick focused on patients who were unable to point to their own body parts and those of the examiner. His patients could however comprehend the body part terminology as well as locate them on a painted visual; however none had a clear demonstration of body specificity. Pick concluded a disturbance of “visual” body image and body awareness. Pick’s studies introduced <b>autotopagnosia</b> and other category specific agnosias, such as visual and tactile agnosia. Josef Gerstmann (1887-1969) first developed the term somatotopagnosia, meaning the lack of knowledge about the body space. Gerstmann studied patients whose deficits were in the body schema and thus lacked the ability to recognize, identify or name the fingers on either hand, a phenomenon known as finger agnosia. This particular ailment, known as Gerstmann syndrome, is often seen in patients with a lesion on their left angular gyrus, which is known to be frequently anatomically correlated with <b>autotopagnosia.</b>|$|E
50|$|No {{medications}} or pharmaceutical remedies {{have been}} approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to treat or cure <b>autotopagnosia.</b> There have been cases in which extensive rehabilitation has been beneficial following restitution, repetitive training to correct the impaired function, and compensation of other skills {{to make up for the}} deficit. Rehabilitation is not a definitive treatment and only shows signs of slight improvement in a small percentage of <b>autotopagnosia</b> patients. The condition of the disease can be monitored with continued neurological examination and using a CT scan to note the progression of the parietal lesion.|$|E
50|$|As of April, 2010, {{the active}} areas of {{research}} surrounding <b>autotopagnosia</b> are focused on more individual case studies, and are aimed at developing possible treatment options as well as eradicating any concerns regarding the disease’s legitimacy.|$|E
50|$|As a concept, <b>autotopagnosia</b> {{has been}} criticized as nonspecific; some claim {{that this is a}} manifestation of a greater {{symptomatic}} complex of anomia, marked by an inability to name things in general—not just parts of the human body.|$|E
50|$|Contiguity errors, {{the most}} common errors made by {{patients}} with <b>autotopagnosia,</b> refer to errors made when the patient is asked to locate a certain body part {{and points to the}} surrounding body parts, but not the part they’ve been asked to locate.|$|E
50|$|Patients with <b>autotopagnosia</b> exhibit an {{inability}} to locate parts of their own body, the body of an examiner’s, or the parts of a representation of a human body. Deficiencies can be in localizing parts of a certain area of the body, or the entire body.|$|E
50|$|The {{nature of}} the alleged mental {{representations}} that underlie the act of pointing to target body parts have been a controversial issue. Originally, it was diagnosed as the effects of general mental deterioration or of aphasia {{on the task of}} pointing to body parts on verbal command. However, contemporary neuropsychological therapy seeks to establish the independence of <b>autotopagnosia</b> from other disorders. With such a general definition, a patient that presents with a dysfunction of or failure in accessing one of four mental representation systems suffers from <b>autotopagnosia.</b> Through observational testing, the type of mental misrepresentation of the body can be deduced: whether semantic, visuospatial, somatosensory, or motor misrepresentations. Neuropsychological tests can provide a proper diagnosis in regards to the specificity of patient’s agnosic condition.|$|E
5000|$|J. Schwoebel et al. (2001) studied {{an elderly}} woman {{suffering}} from <b>autotopagnosia</b> following a car accident which damaged her lateral occipital, left posterior temporal and posterior parietal lobe. They performed a similar series of tests, examining her ability to identify and locate body parts on a drawn figure and herself, upon verbal command. They expanded the study, repeating the verbal command tests in areas of unfamiliarity and {{with a series of}} objects rather than body parts. Schwoebel found that the subject was able to identify objects with more ease than body parts and that location familiarity was not relevant. Schwoebel stressed the difference between function and spatial vicinity tests however the subject failed both tests. Overall, the subject was unable to locate the correct parts of her body or that of another, thereby presented the classic signs of <b>autotopagnosia.</b>|$|E

5000|$|G. Denes et al. (2000) {{conducted}} {{a series of}} tests on two patients suffering from <b>autotopagnosia</b> in order to verify how the body schema uses body representation to determine one’s spatial arrangement. The two subjects, each suffering from a condition which affected their parietal lobe, presented with similar degrees of agnosia according to neurological testing, yet did not suffer from any language, behavior or memory limitations. G. Denes performed a series of tests to challenge the subjects, consisting of body related tasks, non-body localizing tasks and reaction to stimuli. The subjects were asked to name body parts and identify objects singled out by the examiner on themselves and in a picture. In addition, the objects and body parts were presented from different perspectives. The subjects were asked both on paper and via verbal command, to locate body parts on themselves, others, and mannequins. On paper {{there was no difference between}} the test and control patients however neither <b>autotopagnosia</b> subject was able to locate the correct body parts on command on either themselves or a mannequin, although could partially identify the objects. Most of the errors in this experiment were considered functional errors, that is, the patient touched body parts similar in function to the ones being prompted. These deficits could not be attributed to mental deterioration or visual deficiencies.|$|E
50|$|Guariglia and coll. (2002) {{described}} a case (EC) of pure <b>autotopagnosia</b> following a left subcortical vascular accident. EC {{did not suffer}} of any other neuropsychological deficit, including language disorder or general mental deterioration. An in-depth analysis of the deficit in localizing body parts and parts of objects or animals revealed a clear-cut dissociation between defective performances in body representation tests and normal performances on tests involving other types of stimuli. EC's performances were particularly defective on tests relying on visuo-spatial body representation, but her semantic and linguistic knowledge about body and bpdy parts were spared. Being the first observation of a subject not affected by any cognitive impairment other than autotopoagnosia, EC represents {{a demonstration of the}} existence of a system specifically devoted to body representation.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Autotopagnosia</b> studies {{frequently}} investigate {{several areas}} of patient examination: indication, verification, construction and drawing, structural and functional information and spatial and functional vicinity. The studies most often probe {{a patient to}} correctly verbally identify certain body parts on themselves, others, and an artificial model. Indication seeks to employ both verbal and non-verbal stimuli, and to differentiate the patient from themselves and others. Most patients fail the indication section however pass the verification exam, which confirms the patients knowledge of what a certain body part or object truly is. Most patients were able to draw the object or body part, yet are unable to construct its location on a working model. The structural and functional information verifies the patient’s competency in deterring the specific body parts function and spatial relation to other body parts. Spatial and functional vicinity tests probe a patient to physically locate the various body parts in relation to others and by function; however these tests are usually failed.|$|E
40|$|Neuropsychological {{studies suggest}} that {{patients}} with left parietal lesions may show impaired localization of parts of either their own or the examiner’s body, despite preserved ability to identify isolated body parts. This deficit, called <b>autotopagnosia,</b> may result from damage to the Body Structural Description (BSD), a representation which codes spatial relationships among body parts. We used {{functional magnetic resonance imaging}} to identify the neural mechanisms underlying the BSD. Two human body or building parts (factor: STIMULI) were shown to participants who either identified them or evaluated their distance (factor: TASK). The analysis of the interaction between STIMULI and TASK, which isolates the neural mechanism underlying BSD, revealed an activation of left posterior intraparietal sulcus (IPS) when the distance between body parts was evaluated. The results show that the left IPS processes specifically the information about spatial relationships among body parts and thereby suggest that damage to this area may underlie <b>autotopagnosia...</b>|$|E
40|$|One {{hundred and}} twenty {{patients}} with unilateral cerebral hemisphere damage (54 aphasics, 21 non-aphasic left and 45 right brain-damaged patients and 57 control subjects without cerebral lesions were given a battery of verbal and non-verbal tests of <b>autotopagnosia,</b> {{with the aim of}} studying the relationships between disorders of body schema and the side of the hemispheric lesion. A second aspect of our research consisted in understanding whether impairment in naming and pointing to body parts following verbal commands was really a specific symptom or if the same difficulty was found when patients were asked to name or to point to parts of objects other than the human body. Our results have shown that: 1) the aphasic patients are significantly more impaired than the non-aphasic patients on all the tests, non-verbal as well as verbal; 2) when results obtained on tests of naming and of pointing to parts of the human body were matched with results obtained on tests of naming and of pointing to parts of objects other than the human body, no difference could be demonstrated. These findings suggest that <b>autotopagnosia</b> is a nonspecific symptom, and that it does not find a satisfactory explanation in terms of "disorders of the body schema"...|$|E
40|$|A {{historical}} {{review of}} calculation abilities is presented. Counting, starting with finger sequencing, {{has been observed}} in different ancient and contemporary cultures, whereas number representation and arithmetic abilities are found only during the last 5000 – 6000 years. The rationale for selecting a base of ten in most numerical systems and the clinical association between acalculia and finger agnosia are analyzed. Finger agnosia (as a restricted form of <b>autotopagnosia),</b> right–left discrimination disturbances, semantic aphasia, and acalculia are proposed to comprise a single neuropsychological syndrome associated with left angular gyrus damage. A classification of calculation disturbances resulting from brain damage is presented. It is emphasized that using historical/anthropological analysis, it becomes evident that acalculia, finger agnosia, and disorders in right–left discrimination (as in general, {{in the use of}} spatial concepts) must constitute a single clinical syndrome, resulting from the disruption of some common brain activity and the impairment of common cognitive mechanisms...|$|E
40|$|Knowledge of {{the spatial}} layout of bodies is {{mediated}} by a representation called the body structural description, damage to {{which results in}} the condition of <b>autotopagnosia</b> in which patients are impaired in judgments about the location and configuration of body parts. While a large literature has investigated disruption of the body structural description, little research has examined its accuracy in healthy individuals. I show that people have systematically distorted knowledge of the configuration of hands. Participants judged the location of their knuckles (i. e., the metacarpalphalangeal joint) by pointing with a baton on their palm. Participants showed clear distal biases, judging their knuckles as farther forward in the hand than they actually are for all fingers except the thumb. This effect appeared both when participants localized the knuckles of their own hand and another person’s hand. These results suggest that intuitive beliefs about body form are systematically distorted...|$|E
40|$|The psychic tonus model (Braun and colleagues, 1999, 2002, 2003, 2006) {{states that}} the left {{hemisphere}} is a “booster” of internal experience and behavior in general, and that the right hemisphere is a “dampener”. Twenty-five patients with a “positive” extreme disturbance of body schema (somatoparaphrenia) and 37 patients with a “negative” disturbance of body schema (<b>autotopagnosia</b> or Gerstmann’s syndrome), all following a unilateral parietal lesion, {{were found in the}} literature and were analyzed to test predictions from Braun’s “psychic tonus” model. As expected, patients with a positive syndrome had a right hemisphere lesion significantly more frequently, and those with a negative syndrome had a left hemisphere lesion significantly more frequently. Thus the psychic tonus model of hemispheric specialization, previously supported with regard to psychomotor baseline, libido, talkativeness, memory, auditory and visual perceptual tonus, now incorporates the tonus of representation of the body (body schema) in the parietal lobes...|$|E
30|$|Additionally, the BS {{is heavily}} {{involved}} in some cognitive disorders [27]. Alice in Wonderland syndrome (involving distorted awareness of body size, mass, or its position in space), <b>autotopagnosia</b> (involving mislocalization of body parts and bodily sensations), and phantom sensation (awareness of an amputated limb) are examples of such disorders. Because the BS is related to such varied human functions, a quantitative method for evaluating the strength of BS modification may be useful both for rehabilitation of spatial cognition disorders and for the estimation of spatial cognitive skill during vehicle operation. Possible BS measurement methods such as {{functional magnetic resonance imaging}} (fMRI), positron emission tomography (PET), and magnetoencephalography (MEG) are, however, not adequate for evaluation, because they all require the participant’s head to be fixed to a stationary measurement unit mounted on the floor. Natural BS modification is difficult to induce using such stationary measurement devices because participants cannot move their bodies freely. Near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) is an alternative measurement method in which the measurement unit can be attached to the participant’s head while still permitting head movement. NIRS may thus have useful applications in daily life, and portable NIRS systems have recently been marketed commercially.|$|E
40|$|We {{report a}} case of pure <b>autotopagnosia</b> (AT) {{following}} a left subcortical vascular accident. The absence of any language disorder, general mental deterioration or other cognitive impairments in this patient allowed an in-depth study of AT. Several tests of body representation and object and animal representation, as well as tests assessing semantic skills were administered to verify current interpretations of AT. Results showed a clear-cut dissociation between defective performances in body representation tests and normal performances on tests involving other kinds of stimuli. The patient's performances were particularly defective on tests relying on visuo-spatial body representation. but her semantic and linguistic knowledge seemed to he spared. This dissociation between different aspects of body representation supports Sirigu et al. 's hypothesis that multiple, partially independent systems are involved in body knowledge. In agreement with this hypothesis, in the present patient AT seems {{be due to a}} deficit in a system that processes the structural properties and relative position of single body parts. The present results, reporting the first observation Of a subject not affected by any cognitive impairment other than AT, strongly support the existence of a system specifically devoted to body representation.

40|$|CHANGES in spatial {{orientation}} after brain damage in man have been described, {{but there is}} little agreement on their interpretation. They may range from loss of such a seemingly simple ability as discrimination of right from left to impairment of such complex achievements as the making and reading of maps. These disturbances seem to hold clues to the nature and neural correlates of awareness of the body and of orientation in the environment. Yet {{it is not clear whether}} diverse forms of disorientation affecting the body or extrapersonal space represent different aspects of some unitary change in function or whether more than one essential alteration has to be assumed. The existence of more than one syndrome might lead one to expect that different aspects of orientation would be selectively vulnerable to lesions in different parts of the brain. If one takes the clinical pictures at their face value, then disorders usually designated as topographical disorientation, loss of topographical memory, constructional apraxia, right-left disorientation, neglect of one half of personal or extrapersonal space, or <b>autotopagnosia</b> may be regarded as separate and independent disturbances, ascribable to different loci of lesion. At the other extreme, they may be considered expressions of a single fundamental defect in spatial organization (Lange, 1930; Stengel, 1944) or in an even more genera...|$|E
40|$|International audienceSince Pick's seminal {{studies on}} <b>autotopagnosia</b> {{dating back to}} the {{beginning}} of last century, no agreement has been reached regarding the nature of the putative representations underlying the act of pointing to body parts. One influential account proposed the existence of a meta-representation, eventually organised as a module, specifically engaged in encoding spatial relationships of bodies. This body-specific representational level has been supposed to be equally involved in processing other persons' bodies as well as one's own. Here, we report two patients with dissociated performances in pointing to human body parts, thereby providing an interesting opportunity to discuss current models of body organisation. JR exhibited a selective deficit in pointing to his own body parts and a preserved ability to point to the parts of others. In contrast, AP demonstrated a selective inability to point to another person's body parts while her capacity to point to her own was intact. To further evaluate the level of body-specificity of AP's impairment, she underwent additional pointing tasks using non-human and human representations. AP's performances were close to those of control subjects across experiments, supporting the idea that processing the spatial layout of another person's body relies on a specific representational and neural system. Based on available data in the literature and the putative areas of lesion evidenced by cerebral blood flow studies in our two subjects, we hypothesise that left superior and inferior parietal regions are parts of networks involved in the respective processing of somatosensory and visuospatial representations of bodies.

40|$|THE {{concept of}} the body image as a {{tridimensional}} inner diagram each person has of his own body has proved of great value for the understand-ing {{of a variety of}} neurological and psychiatric disorders. The concept originated from the work of Pick (1908) and Head and Holmes (1911). Since Pick described the first case of anosognosia for hemiplegia in 1898, evidence has accumulated to indicate that the parietal lobes are the crucial links in the functional physiological chain concerned with the elaboration of the body image. Lesions of the right parietal lobe produce disordered awareness of the left half of the body, sometimes with delusional con-fabulations. Lesions of the left parietal lobe produce disorders which are bilateral in distribution. The commonest condition resulting from disease of the major parietal lobe is that described by Gerstmann, in which finger agnosia is usually associated with acalculia, agraphia, loss of right-left discrimination, and constructional apraxia. Gerstmann (1942) believes that finger agnosia is a forme fruste of total <b>autotopagnosia,</b> or inability to identify or indicate any part of the body, and this, in his view, is produced by a lesion involving the "chief representation of the body schema " in the major parietal lobe. This condition is always manifested in a setting of severe intellectual defects, sometimes with clouded consciousness, which obscure the body image disorder and, according to Gerstmann, explain why it is so rarely encountered. Brain (1941) has suggested that the disorder which is obscured in this way by the associated aphasic, apractic and other agnostic symptoms, is a disordered awareness of the right body half, identical with that produced by right hemisphere lesions for the contralateral side. However, very few convincing cases of anosognosia for right hemiplegia, or other delusional beliefs concerning the right half of the body and produced by a lesion in a dominant left hemisphere, have so far been recorded (although the condition may, to a large extent, be diagnosed from the patient's behaviour). We are mainly concerned here with disorders of the body image pro...|$|E
