40|$|The higher {{education}} landscape is undergoing major transformation, {{with a significant}} impact on the work and family practices of academics and professional staff. The purpose of this exploratory study is to examine the extent to which (1) time-related, (2) strain-related and (3) demographical variables impact on the work/family balance of academic and professional staff in Victorian universities and Technical and Further Education (TAFE) institutes. Our findings reveal that university employees experience greater work/family imbalance. The results of this research demonstrate how the three constructs contribute to work/family imbalance in academia, especially within the university sector.

The data is collected {{but is not}} systematically evaluated or used for an optimized management. In future open IoT (Internet of Things) -platforms can contribute an energy optimized building management that covers all systems of a building. The concept of <b>a</b> <b>cross-sectoral</b> District Energy Management System (DEMS), that extends the Building Management System to the buildings of a district, can open up additional flexibility- and energy saving potential {{and can be used}} to create new business models. In the German-French project EBITA (Exploiting the Scientific and Business Potential when Integrating Smart Data Analytics into Internet of Things Applications) solutions are formulated, which use the potential of the Internet of Things in terms of Smart Building and Smart Grid to combine information from the excisting heterogeneous ICT-Infrastructure. These solutions can be used to realize a optimal system integration and management of renewable energies. Thereby possibilities for new digital services will be investigated. The new link between the areas of Smart Building and Smart Grid is used to create <b>an</b> <b>cross-sectoral</b> approach for <b>a</b> District Energy Management.
