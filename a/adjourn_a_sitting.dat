Defying Sivakumar's directive, the Perak legal advisor, Ahmad Kamal Mohd Shahid prevented the notification of the emergency sitting from being released because the meeting did not obtain {{the consent of the}} Monarch. Sivakumar's lawyer Augustine Anthony countered the legal advisor citing that as <b>an</b> <b>adjourned</b> <b>sitting,</b> the session is not dissolved or prorogued and therefore does not require the consent of the Sultan.|$|R

40|$|Although resting {{is one of}} the {{dominant}} behaviors of foregut fermenting primates (i. e., colobines), their resting posture has rarely received attention. We hypothesize that colobines are more constrained in their resting position than hindgut fermenting primates and that colobines assume <b>a</b> <b>sitting</b> resting position for specific reasons. To test this hypothesis, we followed two approaches. First, we observed resting positions in two captive individuals each of eight species and tested whether colobines rested in <b>a</b> <b>sitting</b> position more than other primates. Second, we collected literature data on free-ranging specimens of 31 species and again tested whether colobines rested in <b>a</b> <b>sitting</b> position more than other primates. Both approaches indicated that colobines spent more time in <b>a</b> <b>sitting</b> posture than other primates (73. 0 % vs. 23. 2 % in captivity and 83. 0 % vs. 60. 9 % in the wild, respectively). We hypothesize that the position of the digestive chamber and the necessity of frequently having to eructate digestion gases force colobines to take <b>a</b> <b>sitting</b> posture to avoid pressure on the thorax and respiratory organs...|$|R
