50|$|Milling is {{the process}} by which {{materials}} are reduced from a large size to a smaller size. Milling may involve breaking up cemented material (in which case individual particles retain their shape) or pulverization (which involves grinding the particles themselves to a smaller size). Milling is generally done by mechanical means, including attrition (which is particle-to-particle collision that results in agglomerate break up or particle shearing), compression (which applies a forces that results in fracturing), and impact (which employs a milling medium or the particles themselves to cause fracturing). Attrition milling equipment includes the wet scrubber (also called the planetary mill or wet <b>attrition</b> <b>mill),</b> which has paddles in water creating vortexes in which the material collides and break up. Compression mills include the jaw crusher, roller crusher and cone crusher. Impact mills include the ball mill, which has media that tumble and fracture the material. Shaft impactors cause particle-to particle attrition and compression.|$|E

The wet-ground pepper and cowpea were analyzed using Atomic Absorption Spectrophotometer (AAS). The iron contents of wet- ground foods (pepper and cowpea) from both attrition mills were significantly higher (p> 0. 05) than iron content of ground food using other methods of grinding. A 30 - 40 folds increases in the iron content of ground food samples were detected using attrition mills.

40|$|The {{influence}} of <b>attrition</b> <b>milling</b> on the chemical precursors of alumina and tetragonal zirconia polycrystal (12 mol% CeO 2) is studied, with {{particular attention to}} the morphology, the specific surface area, the crystallographic form and the sinterability of powders obtained by (i) calcining the pristine precursors and (ii) milling the pristine precursors and then performing the calcination. It has been demonstrated that in the latter case the specific surface area is reduced but the sinterability is increased with respect to the former one. This behaviour is due to the destruction, by the <b>attrition</b> <b>milling,</b> of the porous microstructures and of the large aggregates in the "as-prepared" materials.

40|$|This study {{evaluated}} {{the use of}} planetary and <b>attrition</b> <b>milling</b> as pretreatment processes for lignocellulosic biomass using rice straw. Planetary milling reduced the rice straw crystallinity from 0. 48 to 0. 11. Since the samples could be milled and enzymatically treated using the same media, loss of the biomass due to washing was effectively eliminated. In contrast, conventional sodium hydroxide and soaking in aqueous ammonia (SAA) processes showed a loss of 34. 2 % and 14. 8 %, respectively. Furthermore, milling produced significantly lower concentrations of soluble phenolics than the alkali treatments. Using a bioluminescent bioreporter strain that is sensitive to these phenolics, neither of the milled samples elicited a response while the sodium hydroxide and SAA samples led to a 25. 8 and 4. 7 -fold induction, respectively.

The influence of an oxidation treatment, <b>attrition</b> <b>milling,</b> sintering additive (Y 2 O 3) and addition of a deflocculant (Dolapix CE 64) on the stabilisation behaviour of the suspensions was studied. Obtained results show that the surface properties of ß-sialon particles are affected, as expected, by the oxidation treatment (isoelectric point, pHiep ˜ 2. 1) and by <b>attrition</b> <b>milling</b> of the power (pHiep ˜ 4. 6). In the presence of Y 2 O 3 the suspension of ß-sialon becomes less stable (pHiep ˜ 3. 4), the viscosity is increased and the stable pH range is reduced. This behaviour is explained in terms of surface composition of ß-sialon, the solubility of yttria in acidic solution and the possibility of precipitation of yttrium-hydroxy complexes on ß-sialon surface at higher pH while increasing the pH.
