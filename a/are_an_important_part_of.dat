5|$|The first {{complete}} {{collection of}} the Drapier's Letters appeared in the 1734 George Faulkner edition of the Works of Jonathan Swift along with an allegorical frontispiece offering praise and thanks from the Irish people. Today, the Drapier's Letters <b>are</b> <b>an</b> <b>important</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> Swift's political writings, along with Gulliver's Travels (1726), A Tale of a Tub (1704), and A Modest Proposal (1729).|$|E
5|$|Because {{norms for}} {{language}} use {{are shared by}} members of a specific group, communicative style also becomes a way of displaying and constructing group identity. Linguistic differences may become salient markers of divisions between social groups, for example, speaking a language with a particular accent may imply membership of an ethnic minority or social class, one's area of origin, or status {{as a second language}} speaker. These kinds of differences {{are not part of the}} linguistic system, but <b>are</b> <b>an</b> <b>important</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> how people use language as a social tool for constructing groups.|$|E
5|$|Buses <b>are</b> <b>an</b> <b>important</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> the Northern {{transport}} mix, with bus ridership {{above the}} England and Wales average {{in all three}} Northern regions. Many of the municipal bus companies were located in Northern England, and the region saw intense competition and bus wars following deregulation in the 1980s and 1990s. Increasing car ownership in the same era caused bus use to decline, although it remains higher than in most areas of the South.|$|E

5|$|In concert bands, {{clarinets}} <b>are</b> <b>an</b> <b>important</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> the instrumentation. The E clarinet, B clarinet, alto clarinet, bass clarinet, and contra-alto/contrabass clarinet {{are commonly}} used in concert bands. Concert bands generally have multiple B clarinets; there are commonly 3 B clarinet parts with 2–3 players per part. There is generally only one player per part on the other clarinets. There are not always E clarinet, alto clarinet, and contra-alto clarinets/contrabass clarinet parts in concert band music, but all three are quite common.|$|E
5|$|Large {{universities}} {{account for}} most of the music degrees in the United States, though there are important small music academies and conservatories. University music departments may sponsor bands ranging from marching bands that <b>are</b> <b>an</b> <b>important</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> collegiate sporting events, prominently featuring fight songs, to barbershop groups, glee clubs, jazz ensembles and symphonies, and may additionally sponsor musical outreach programs, such as by bringing foreign performers to the area for concerts. Universities may also have a musicology department, and do research on many styles of music.|$|E
5|$|Like mayflies, {{stoneflies}} and dragonflies, but to {{a somewhat}} lesser extent, caddisflies are an indicator of good water quality; they die out of streams with polluted waters. They <b>are</b> <b>an</b> <b>important</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> the food web, both larvae and adults being eaten by many fish. The newly hatched adult is particularly vulnerable as it struggles to the surface after emerging from the submerged pupa, and as it dries its wings. The fish find these new adults easy pickings, and fishing flies resembling them can be successful for anglers {{at the right time}} of year.|$|E

The National Independence Competitions <b>are</b> <b>an</b> <b>important</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> Dominican musical culture. They were founded by Chief Minister of Dominica Edward Olivier Leblanc in 1965, and promote the traditional music and dance of Dominica. The government of Dominica also promotes Dominican music through the Dominican Broadcasting Station, which broadcasts between 20% and 25% local music as a matter of policy.|$|E

That's why I like to do them myself {{a lot of the}} time, or initially I'll lay down the tracks. I'll double my voice or do a couple of tracks of my own voice. It's easy for me to match my voice. And then if I'm going to use other background singers, I'll let them go on top of mine.|$|E
5|$|Annual Carnival {{celebrations}} <b>are</b> <b>an</b> <b>important</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> {{the culture}} of all the Lesser Antillean islands. Carnival is celebrated at varying times of year, either pre-Lent, Christmastime or in July and August, and feature {{a wide variety of}} dances, songs and parades. Contests are common, especially Calypso King and Queen contests, which are held on most of the British Antillean islands, the U.S. Virgin Islands as well as French Saint Martin and elsewhere. The British Antillean Carnivals are also mostly united by the J'ouvert tradition, which involves calypso and soca band parades and are the highlight of their celebrations.|$|E

5|$|As {{an iconic}} skill, bicycle kicks <b>are</b> <b>an</b> <b>important</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> {{association}} football culture. Executing a bicycle kick {{in a competitive}} football match, particularly in scoring a goal, usually garners wide attention in the sports media. The bicycle kick has been featured in works of art, such as sculptures, films, advertisements, and literature. The manoeuvre is also used in other similar ball sports, particularly in the variants of association football like futsal and beach soccer. The controversy over the move's invention and name in Brazil, Chile, and Peru (and its status as {{an element of the}} notable Chile–Peru football rivalry) has added to the kick's acclaim in popular culture.|$|E
5|$|Located in the Białystok Uplands of the Podlaskie Plain on {{the banks}} of the Biała River, Białystok ranks second in terms of {{population}} density, eleventh in population, and thirteenth in area, of the cities of Poland. It has historically attracted migrants from elsewhere in Poland and beyond, particularly from Central and Eastern Europe. This is facilitated by the fact that the nearby border with Belarus is also the eastern border of the European Union, as well as the Schengen Area. The city and its adjacent municipalities constitute Metropolitan Białystok. The city has a , characterized by warm summers and long frosty winters. Forests <b>are</b> <b>an</b> <b>important</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> Białystok's character, and occupy around 1,756 ha (4,340 acres) (17.2% of the administrative area of the city) which places it as the fifth most forested city in Poland.|$|E
5|$|Risk {{management}} is {{obtained by the}} usual measures of engineering controls, administrative controls and procedures, and personal protective equipment, including hazard identification and risk assessment (HIRA), protective equipment, medical screening, training and standardised procedures. Professional divers are generally legally obliged to carry out and formally record these measures, and though recreational divers are not legally required to do many of them, competent recreational divers, and particularly technical divers, generally perform them informally but routinely, and they <b>are</b> <b>an</b> <b>important</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> technical diver training. For example, a medical statement or examination for fitness, pre-dive site assessment and briefing, safety drills, thermal protection, equipment redundancy, alternative air source, buddy checks, buddy or team diving procedures, dive planning, underwater hand signals, and carrying first aid and oxygen administration equipment are all routinely part of technical diving.|$|E

5|$|Sheep <b>are</b> <b>an</b> <b>important</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> {{the global}} {{agricultural}} economy. However, their once vital status {{has been largely}} replaced by other livestock species, especially the pig, chicken, and cow. China, Australia, India, and Iran have the largest modern flocks, and serve both local and exportation needs for wool and mutton. Other countries such as New Zealand have smaller flocks but retain a large international economic impact due to their export of sheep products. Sheep also {{play a major role}} in many local economies, which may be niche markets focused on organic or sustainable agriculture and local food customers. Especially in developing countries, such flocks may be a part of subsistence agriculture rather than a system of trade. Sheep themselves may be a medium of trade in barter economies.|$|E
5|$|Trees <b>are</b> <b>an</b> <b>important</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> the {{terrestrial}} ecosystem, providing essential habitats including {{many kinds of}} forest for communities of organisms. Epiphytic plants such as ferns, some mosses, liverworts, orchids and some species of parasitic plants (e.g., mistletoe) hang from branches; these along with arboreal lichens, algae, and fungi provide micro-habitats for themselves and for other organisms, including animals. Leaves, flowers and fruits are seasonally available. On the ground underneath trees there is shade, and often there is undergrowth, leaf litter, fallen branches and/or decaying wood that provide other habitat. Trees stabilise the soil, prevent rapid run-off of rain water, help prevent desertification, {{have a role in}} climate control and help in the maintenance of biodiversity and ecosystem balance.|$|E
