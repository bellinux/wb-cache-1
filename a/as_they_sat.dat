5|$|Later, Howard {{arrives at}} Mickey's Diner and uses their {{phone to call}} home. As {{he tried to get}} a hold of Liz, he unintentionally scolds Jamie on the phone over Turbo-Man. Jamie, in turn, rebukes his father about how he never keeps his promises, and hangs up. Liz overhears the {{argument}} and becomes disappointed in her husband. Howard then encounters Myron at the diner. <b>As</b> <b>they</b> <b>sat</b> down and talk, Myron tells Howard about the time when his father was unable to get him a Johnny Seven OMA toy on Christmas. They hear on the KQRS radio station that the D.J. is running a Turbo-Man competition. When they get to the studio, they find out they can only win a gift certificate. They are nearly arrested, but Myron bluffs the police into backing off by threatening them with a package (which he claims is a mail bomb, unaware that it really is one). Officer Hummell tries to open it and it blows up in his face. After his car is stripped by thieves, Howard is ultimately forced to return home empty-handed. Upon seeing Ted in his house placing the star on his tree, Howard gets angry and attempts to steal the Turbo-Man doll from Ted's house that he had bought for his son Johnny (E.J. De La Pena), but changes his mind at the last moment as he could not see himself stealing from a child. He is attacked by Ted's pet reindeer but manages to lock him up but he unintentionally sets some of his stuff on fire he tires to put it out but kicks it outside the window. This commotion leads him to be caught by Ted and a distraught Liz. Liz and Jamie leave for the local Wintertainment Parade with Ted and Johnny; Howard follows, aiming to make amends. At the parade, Ted makes a pass at Liz, but after seeing what he really is, she turns him down by hitting him with a thermos of eggnog.|$|E
25|$|After {{taking her}} to dinner on December 10, Kosova said Acremant pulled out a gun and a stun gun <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>sat</b> in her truck and {{told her he had}} killed three people; two just that week. He {{unscrewed}} the silencer on the gun and showed her the blood inside.|$|E
25|$|On 2 August 1990, Saddam {{launched}} a military invasion onto neighboring Kuwait, reportedly {{due to its}} vast oil reserves, which would have helped him pay off the debts he owed to other countries during the Iran–Iraq War (see Gulf War). Within 24 hours, the Emir of Kuwait had fled. However, subsequently, an international coalition force consisting of American, British, Saudi and other troops liberated the country in 1991 and Iraqi troops were forced out of Kuwait (see Operation Desert Storm). Subsequently, {{one month after the}} Gulf War in February 1991, United States President George H. W. Bush called on the Iraqi people to stage an uprising against Saddam Hussein. This was followed by a series of rebellions {{in many parts of the}} country, such as the south by Shi'ite groups such as SCIRI and the Islamic Da'awa Party. Meanwhile, the Kurds in the north staged their own uprising for autonomy, under the leadership of Massoud Barzani, leader of the Kurdistan Democratic Party, and Jalal Talabani, leader of the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan. The Peshmerga were trained into hardened guerrillas, who managed to infiltrate the Jash, a Saddam-orientated Kurdish militia (see Jash (term) and National Defense Battalions (Iraq)). The rebels soon managed to capture the town of Ranya, Sulaimaniya and ultimately the oil center of Kirkuk. Saddam retaliated swiftly, battering Kirkuk with artillery and targeting hospitals in particular. Geographically the towns captured by the Kurdish rebels were difficult to defend <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>sat</b> on plains below mountains. The rebels were forced to retreat in the mountains, where reportedly the Iraqi helicopters threw flour of them (which was believed to be a grim legacy of the reputed powdery chemical weapons which were used by the Iraqi administration during the Al-Anfal Campaign).|$|E

500|$|O'Hara first {{attended}} the John Street West Girls' School near Thomas Street in Dublin's Liberties Area. She began dancing {{at the age}} of 5, when a gypsy predicted that she would become rich and famous, and she would boast to friends <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>sat</b> in her back garden that she would [...] "become the most famous actress in the world". Her enthusiastic family fully supported the idea. When she recited a poem on stage in school {{at the age of}} six, O'Hara immediately felt an attraction to performing in front of an audience. From that age she trained in drama, music and dance along with her siblings at the Ena Mary Burke School of Drama and Elocution in Dublin. Their affinity to the arts left O'Hara referring to the family as the [...] "Irish Von Trapp family".|$|E
500|$|The same spring, on 12 May 1787, {{the still}} {{hesitant}} Wilberforce held {{a conversation with}} William Pitt and the future Prime Minister William Grenville <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>sat</b> under a large oak tree on Pitt's estate in Kent. Under {{what came to be}} known as the [...] "Wilberforce Oak" [...] at Holwood, Pitt challenged his friend: [...] "Wilberforce, why don't you give notice of a motion on the subject of the Slave Trade? You have already taken great pains to collect evidence, and are therefore fully entitled to the credit which doing so will ensure you. Do not lose time, or the ground will be occupied by another." [...] Wilberforce's response is not recorded, but he later declared in old age that he could [...] "distinctly remember the very knoll on which I was sitting near Pitt and Grenville" [...] where he made his decision.|$|E
500|$|Bond next {{created the}} role of Mad Margaret in Ruddigore (1887; {{originally}} spelt [...] "Ruddygore"), which she regarded as her favourite of all the Gilbert and Sullivan roles, [...] "for it gave me the chance to show what I really could do as an actress." [...] The part was her largest to date, and Gilbert, Sullivan and Carte made her audition it {{for them to be}} sure that she could handle the responsibility. [...] "It was an awful ordeal. [...] I saw the three white faces looming out of the darkness <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>sat</b> close together; criticizing me, talking me over, with cold managerial detachment. It nearly killed me. [...] Perhaps it gave an added realism and abandon to my simulated madness, for indeed I was nearly mad with fear – but at any rate I came through triumphantly, they were all three of them delighted." [...] Bond was particularly nervous on opening night. [...] "I shook and tottered so much that Mad Margaret's staff was no mere adjunct, but an absolute necessity. Without it I should have fallen as I stood in the wings waiting to go on. Then some one gave me a push; I was there, on the stage, in the glare of the footlights, hundreds of eyes fixed on me, tier upon tier of dim white faces rising from floor to ceiling in the gloom. It was enough; I forgot myself, I was Mad Margaret and no one else. I made an immense success." [...] Cellier and Bridgeman seconded this assessment: ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But tell me," [...] said Paul, <b>as</b> <b>they</b> all <b>sat</b> down {{together}} in the cave, while the Indians stood by and looked silently on, [...] "what is the truth about this Indian who was murdered, and the dog and the woman?" ...|$|R

60|$|That night, <b>as</b> <b>they</b> all <b>sat</b> round their camp-fire, eating supper with {{a degree}} of zest known only to those who labour at severe and out-of-door {{occupation}} all day, Ned Sinton astonished his companions not a little, by stating his intention to leave them for the purpose of making a tour through the country.|$|R

2500|$|In 1949, {{the first}} [...] "corneal" [...] lenses were developed. These were {{much smaller than}} the {{original}} scleral lenses, <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>sat</b> only on the cornea rather than across all of the visible ocular surface, and could be worn up to sixteen hours a day. Polymethyl methacrylate(PMMA) corneal lenses became the first contact lenses to have mass appeal through the 1960s, as lens designs became more sophisticated with improving manufacturing [...] technology.|$|E
2500|$|Around {{this time}} an issue arose {{before a game}} against St Pats in which the bus company would not take the team to the match - because the company had not been paid to do so. This {{resulted}} in what a player described as a [...] "humiliating" [...] plea from the team, <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>sat</b> stranded near the bus, on radio station Cork's 96FM for urgent donations from the general public {{to get them to}} the game on time.|$|E
60|$|The {{cloud and}} the wind passed away, leaving the night as {{beautiful}} <b>as</b> before, and <b>they</b> <b>sat</b> {{on for a while}} to watch it, listening to the music of the waterfall that splashed into the deep sea pool below, and to the soft surge of the waves <b>as</b> <b>they</b> lapped gently against the narrow beach.|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{was in the}} {{fortress}} that my grandfather found himself together with Sergeant Peter.

Then, in a changed tone; 'Talking of ideas, my Lizzie,' they were sitting side by side <b>as</b> <b>they</b> had <b>sat</b> at first, 'I wonder how it happens that when I am work, work, working here, all alone in the summer-time, I smell flowers.' ...|$|R
2500|$|The 2007 Louis Vuitton Cup started {{slowly with}} all races {{postponed}} {{for the first}} four days of competition due to light and variable winds. There were rumors that BMW Oracle was planning on rotating the crew off the boat because they were running out of stories to tell <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>sat</b> in the boat waiting for wind. To entertain fans, some teams came up with interesting stunts. For instance, United Internet Germany came {{up with a way to}} wakeboard, by having their largest sail trimmers pull on the wakeboarder using the jib trimming system. [...] +39, an Italian challenger, used the windless days off to continue making repairs to their mast, which shattered in a starboard-port situation with Internet Team Germany two weeks earlier, and completed mast repairs by the time racing had commenced.|$|E
2500|$|On 21 January 1981, 86-year-old Sir Norman Stronge, Bt, former Speaker of the UK Houses of Parliament, and {{his only}} son, James, 48 (both former MPs) were murdered by the Provisional Irish Republican Army. The house was then burnt to the ground. The {{bodies of the}} father and son were later {{recovered}} from their blazing home. The two men were targeted <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>sat</b> in the main library of their 230-year-old mansion. Members of the Provisional Irish Republican Army forced entry into the Abbey by bombing the heavy front doors. Afterward the building was fire-bombed. The fire raged until the next morning, destroying the contents of the Abbey, and the house burned to the ground. Gerry Adams stated about the elder Stronge, “The only complaint I have heard from Nationalists or anti-Unionists is that he was not shot 40 years ago.” ...|$|E
2500|$|More {{renovation}} – and a {{round of}} controversy – came after the 1938 season when Mack sought to install light towers for night play, which local residents were against. They objected in general to the light, noise and traffic that night games would bring to the neighborhood, and objected specifically to the danger of home run balls hitting them <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>sat</b> on their porches and {{to the ability of}} fans in the upper decks to peer into their bedrooms at night. The matter went to court, and Mack hired a young Philadelphia lawyer to plead his case. The presentation of young Richardson Dilworth, future mayor of the city, carried the day: the A's won the case and the light towers went up in time for the 1939 season. The first night game in the AL was at Shibe Park on May 16, 1939: the Indians beat the A's, 8–3.|$|E
60|$|He did as {{the owner}} of the yacht proposed, {{spending}} half of his money in the purchase of such dainties as Master West fancied, and then, in order to see if they had been cheated, <b>as</b> Bartholomew proposed, <b>they</b> <b>sat</b> down on a doorstep to test the goods.|$|R
50|$|In 1931, Labor MPs James Fenton (Maribyrnong), Moses Gabb (Angas), Allan Guy (Bass), Joseph Lyons (Wilmot), Charles McGrath (Ballaarat) and John Price (Boothby) {{resigned}} from the party in protest at the reappointment of Ted Theodore <b>as</b> Treasurer. <b>They</b> <b>sat</b> with the Opposition Nationalist Party and soon merged with them to become the United Australia Party. The UAP was also joined by the three Australian Party MPs, Billy Hughes (North Sydney), Walter Marks (Wentworth) and George Maxwell (Fawkner).|$|R
6000|$|To our hero, however, and to Moses, the {{outburst}} seemed {{anything but}} [...] "moderate," [...] {{and that night}} <b>as</b> <b>they</b> two <b>sat</b> together in the cave after supper, listening with awe-struck faces to the cannonading and wild musketry going on as it seemed under their very feet, the negro solemnly imparted to Nigel in a low whisper that he thought [...] "de end ob de wurld hab come at last!" ...|$|R
2500|$|Most Meccans {{ignored it}} and a few mocked him, while some others became his followers. According to Ibn Sad, in this period the Quraysh [...] "did not criticize what he said... When he passed by them <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>sat</b> in groups, they would point out to him and say [...] "There is the youth of the clan of Abd al-Muttalib who speaks (things) from heaven." [...] According to Welch, the Qur'anic verses at this time were not [...] "based on a dogmatic {{conception}} of monotheism but on a strong general moral and religious appeal". Its key themes include the moral responsibility of man towards his creator: {{the resurrection of the}} dead, God's final judgment followed by vivid descriptions of the tortures in hell and pleasures in paradise; the wonders of nature and everyday life, particularly the phenomenon of man, as signs of God to show the existence of a greater power who will take into account the greed of people and their suppression of the poor. Religious duties required of the believers at this time were few: belief in God, asking for forgiveness of sins, offering frequent prayers, assisting others particularly those in need, rejecting cheating and the love of wealth (considered to be significant in the commercial life of Mecca), being chaste and not to kill new-born & under-aged girls.|$|E

60|$|There {{was then}} a silence among the four ladies that were left there standing. At first they {{followed}} each other into the drawing-room, all wrapped up <b>as</b> <b>they</b> were and <b>sat</b> on chairs apart, saying nothing to each other. At last Aunt Letty got up.|$|R
