Two {{methods have been}} found to effectively tune the position of reflectance transition of the Al-AlN cermet solar selective <b>absorbing</b> <b>coating,</b> which is crucial to obtain a low emittance at elevated temperature. The position of reflectance transition is mainly determined by the high metal volume fraction (HMVF) cermet layer. It is effectively tuned to shift to lower wavelength by reducing the metal volume fraction or the thickness of the HMVF layer. This provides easy ways to tune the position of reflectance transition...|$|E
40|$|The {{selective}} <b>absorbing</b> <b>coating</b> {{is one of}} the key {{parts of}} an all-glass evacuated solar tube and its optical properties will have direct influence on the thermal performance of the all-glass evacuated solar tube. The major parameter to represent the optical properties of a selective <b>absorbing</b> <b>coating</b> is its optical absorptance whereas the major parameters to represent the thermal performance of an all-glass evacuated solar tube are the parameter representing the performance of the tube when there is no water in the tube and the solar radiation corresponding to the case when water in the tube is under stagnation conditions. In this paper, the influence of the selective <b>absorbing</b> <b>coating</b> on these two parameters are investigated experimentally for a series of all-glass evacuated tubes.

A series of NbMoN and NbMoON single layers are deposited by magnetron reactive sputtering method with different N 2 /O 2 gas flowing rates.

40|$|Biocomposites is a {{field that}} has gained much {{scientific}} attention due to the current substantial consumption of non-renewable resources and the environmentally harmful disposal methods required for traditional polymer composites. Research on natural fiber reinforced polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs) has gained considerable momentum over the past decade. There is little work on PHAs reinforced with unidirectional (UD) natural fibers and little work on using epoxidized natural rubber (ENR) as a toughening agent for PHA-based biocomposites. In this work, we prepared polyhydroxybutyrate-co-valerate (PHBV) biocomposites reinforced with UD 30 wt. % flax fibers and evaluated the use of ENR with 50 % epoxidation (ENR 50) as a toughening agent for PHBV biocomposites. Quasi-unidirectional flax/PHBV composites were prepared by hand layup, powder impregnation followed by compression molding. Toughening agents – polybutylene adiphate-co-terephthalate (PBAT) and ENR 50 – were cryogenically ground into powder and mechanically mixed with main matrix PHBV to maintain the powder impregnation process. The tensile, flexural and impact properties of the biocomposites were measured and morphology of the composites examined using optical microscopy (OM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The UD biocomposites showed exceptionally high mechanical properties {{as compared to the}} results obtained previously where only short fibers have been used. The improved tensile and flexural properties were attributed to the continuous nature of the fiber reinforcement and the increased proportion of fibers in the loading direction. The improved impact properties were attributed to a larger surface area for fiber-matrix debonding and for subsequent sliding and fiber pull-out mechanisms to act on, allowing more energy to be <b>absorbed.</b> <b>Coating</b> cryogenically ground ENR 50 particles with PHBV powder successfully inhibits the self-healing nature of ENR- 50, preventing particles from coalescing and overcoming problems in mechanical mixing, compounding and molding.
