Investigating, Black finds <b>a</b> <b>human</b> <b>hair</b> with a message etched into it—"hair today, gone tomorrow"—which he takes as an indication that the murderer is lashing out at a world that he feels has treated him as insignificant. Horn's mental condition seems to deteriorate, and he begins to take the case personally, leading Black to doubt his ability.|$|E
5|$|Silicon carbide fibers {{are used}} to measure gas {{temperatures}} in an optical technique called thin filament pyrometry. It involves the placement of a thin filament in a hot gas stream. Radiative emissions from the filament can be correlated with filament temperature. Filaments are SiC fibers with a diameter of 15 micrometers, about one fifth that of <b>a</b> <b>human</b> <b>hair.</b> Because the fibers are so thin, they do little to disturb the flame and their temperature remains close {{to that of the}} local gas. Temperatures of about 800–2500 K can be measured.|$|E

The nanotubes are approximately 50,000 times thinner than <b>a</b> <b>human</b> <b>hair.</b> Originally, it was fabricated {{as a way to}} handle carbon nanotubes, but it is also being studied and developed into applications by several research groups, showing promise as vehicle armor, personal armor, and next-generation electronics and displays.|$|E
25|$|Very thin {{strands of}} albumen could be soft and fine {{enough to allow}} the {{trapdoor}} to close completely; these would not be drawn in any further unless the trigger hairs were indeed stimulated again. On the other hand, <b>a</b> <b>human</b> <b>hair,</b> finer still but relatively hard and unyielding, could prevent a seal being formed; these would prevent the trap from resetting at all due to leakage of water.|$|E
25|$|Electromyography (EMG) is {{a method}} of {{detecting}} the electrical activity that occurs when muscles are activated, thus determining which muscles an animal uses for a given movement. This can be accomplished either by surface electrodes (usually in large animals) or implanted electrodes (often wires thinner than <b>a</b> <b>human</b> <b>hair).</b> Furthermore, the intensity of electrical activity can correlate {{to the level of}} muscle activity, with greater activity implying (though not definitively showing) greater force.|$|E

" With {{the latter half of}} this statement we are in complete accord. We believe that the fundamental question involved is not one of statistical methods, formulae, and their comprehension, but rather: "Is the scale count of <b>a</b> <b>human</b> crown <b>hair</b> characteristic of all the crown hairs of the individual, and does the scale count differ significantly from individual to individual? " In other words, "Is the scale count of <b>a</b> single <b>human</b> <b>hair</b> of value in individualizin...|$|R
25|$|The tracker {{needs to}} record {{particle}} paths accurately yet be lightweight {{so as to}} disturb the particle as little as possible. It does this by taking position measurements so accurate that tracks can be reliably reconstructed using just a few measurement points. Each measurement is accurate to 10µm, {{a fraction of the}} width of <b>a</b> <b>human</b> <b>hair.</b> It is also the inner most layer of the detector and so receives the highest volume of particles: the construction materials were therefore carefully chosen to resist radiation.|$|E
25|$|An {{optical fiber}} or optical fibre is a flexible, {{transparent}} fiber made by drawing glass (silica) or plastic to a diameter slightly thicker {{than that of}} <b>a</b> <b>human</b> <b>hair.</b> Optical fibers are used most often {{as a means to}} transmit light between the two ends of the fiber and find wide usage in fiber-optic communications, where they permit transmission over longer distances and at higher bandwidths (data rates) than wire cables. Fibers are used instead of metal wires because signals travel along them with less loss; in addition, fibers are immune to electromagnetic interference, a problem from which metal wires suffer excessively. Fibers are also used for illumination and imaging, and are often wrapped in bundles so that they may be used to carry light into, or images out of confined spaces, {{as in the case of}} a fiberscope. Specially designed fibers are also used for a variety of other applications, some of them being fiber optic sensors and fiber lasers.|$|E
500|$|Producer {{and writer}} Chip Johannessen {{felt that the}} scene in this episode in which <b>a</b> <b>human</b> <b>hair</b> is {{discovered}} with a message inscribed upon it was a [...] "perfect" [...] moment, in that it [...] "told you everything about this guy ... but {{you had no idea}} what he was or what he was going to do next ... you know what kind of crazy motherfucker would do that, but where he is or what he's going to do next, who knows". The episode's opening nightmare sequence, in which Jordan Black (Brittany Tiplady) is terrified by a clown crawling along the ceiling, was inspired by the childhood nightmares of Morgan and Wong, and left Tiplady suffering from bad dreams herself for several nights after filming. Producer John Peter Kousakis recalls having visited the episode's set late during production, having felt that make-up effects supervisor Toby Lindala had been doing [...] "fabulous" [...] work on the series' prosthetic body parts. Walking on set to find Lindala's recreation of a quartered corpse, Kousakis remarked [...] "we're doing something special here, but we're also doing something really outrageous". Lance Henriksen also found this scene too graphic to film all at once, taking time between shots to compose himself.|$|E

25|$|Since 2000, more {{products}} and techniques {{have been developed}} to make lip augmentation more effective and patient friendly. The relative ease of many injections is due to surgeons using tiny 30 and 31 gauge (about as thick as <b>a</b> dozen <b>human</b> <b>hairs)</b> needles that are used to inject the very sensitive lips. Nonetheless, topical anesthesias are often used for lip augmentation procedures.|$|R
40|$|In this thesis, new {{approaches}} to direct trace metals analysis of solid samples by inductively coupled plasma spectroscopy were investigated using laser ablation and thermal vaporization systems for solid sample introduction of biological, environmental, and pharmaceutical samples. Laser ablation with inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES) and inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) was applied to pharmaceutical tablets. Precision of analysis depended on laser parameters and could be improved using signal ratios. The feasibility of using laser ablation-ICP-MS for detecting natural levels of mercury along <b>a</b> single <b>human</b> <b>hair</b> strand was also demonstrated. As well, {{the use of an}} induction-heating electrothermal vaporizer (IH-ETV) coupled to an ICP-MS was successful in determining mercury concentrations in <b>a</b> single <b>human</b> <b>hair</b> strand. Methodologies for multielement analysis of powdered hair were also explored using IH-ETV-ICP-MS. While calibration by reference hair materials showed promise, calibration methods by liquid standards were not suitable for any element. Detection limits achieved for most elements were below natural levels found in <b>human</b> <b>hair.</b> IH-ETV-ICP-AES was also applied to the analysis of analyze-laden chromatographic powder. This study showed potential problems that may arise due to the methodology taken to analyze such materials. Finally, recommendations for future investigations and methodologies for laser ablation and thermal vaporization are discussed...|$|R
50|$|This {{measurement}} is not <b>a</b> precise one. <b>Human</b> <b>hair</b> {{varies in}} diameter, ranging anywhere from 30 μm to 100 μm.

2500|$|A London moment {{gyroscope}} {{relies on}} the quantum-mechanical phenomenon, whereby a spinning superconductor generates a magnetic field whose axis lines up exactly with the spin axis of the gyroscopic rotor. A magnetometer determines {{the orientation of the}} generated field, which is interpolated to determine the axis of rotation. Gyroscopes of this type can be extremely accurate and stable. For example, those used in the Gravity Probe B experiment measured changes in gyroscope spin axis orientation to better than 0.5 milliarcseconds (1.4 degrees) over a one-year period. This is equivalent to an angular separation the width of <b>a</b> <b>human</b> <b>hair</b> viewed from [...] away.|$|E

The microspheres are approximately 30µm in diameter (about one-third of <b>a</b> <b>human</b> <b>hair)</b> and are delivered directly into the artery supplying blood to the tumors. These treatments begin by guiding a catheter up through the femoral artery in the leg, navigating to the desired target site and administering treatment. The blood feeding the tumor will carry the microspheres directly to the tumor enabling a more selective approach than traditional systemic chemotherapy. There are currently two different kinds of microspheres: SIR-Spheres and TheraSphere.|$|E
