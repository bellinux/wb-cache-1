50|$|All of this {{technology}} came {{at a very high}} price. At a time when the most expensive Cadillacs, the mid-sized Seville and full-sized Cadillac Fleetwood Series Seventy-Five limousine each listed for about US$16,000, the 6.9 listed for around $40,000, more than the Big Three but less than most Rolls-Royces. When the car was officially introduced into the North American market for the 1977 model year, the price was well past $40,000 and was $52,995 by the end of production. Though the 6.9 was undeniably a luxury car, the decor was rather austere compared to the sheer opulence available in a Rolls-Royce or full-sized Cadillac.

40|$|Are {{religious}} people psychologically {{better or worse}} adjusted than their non-religious counterparts? Hundreds of studies have reported a positive relation between religiosity and psychological adjustment. Recently, however, a comparatively small number of cross-cultural studies has questioned this staple of religiosity research. The latter studies find that religious adjustment benefits are restricted to religious cultures. Gebauer, Sedikides, and Neberich (2012 b) suggested the religiosity-as-social-value hypothesis (RASV) as one explanation for those cross-cultural differences. RASV states that, in religious cultures, religiosity possesses much social value, and, as such, {{religious people}} will feel particularly good about themselves. In secular cultures, however, religiosity possesses limited social value, and, as such, religious people will feel less good about themselves, if at all. Yet, previous evidence has been inconclusive regarding RASV and regarding cross-cultural differences in religious adjustment benefits more generally. To clarify matters, we conducted three replication studies. We examined the relation between religiosity and self-esteem (the most direct and appropriate <b>adjustment</b> <b>indicator,</b> according to RASV) in a self-report study across 65 countries (N = 2, 195, 301), an informant-report study across 36 countries (N = 560, 264), and another self-report study across 1, 932 urban areas from 243 federal states in 18 countries (N = 1, 188, 536). Moreover, we scrutinized our results against seven, previously untested, alternative explanations. Our results fully and firmly replicated and extended prior evidence for cross-cultural differences in religious adjustment benefits. These cross-cultural differences were best explained by the RASV hypothesis...|$|E

In the broader occupational stress literature, researchers have suggested that social support will be most effective at reducing the negative effects of stressors on strain when the type of support matches the type of stressor being experienced (either instrumental or emotional). This study was a preliminary investigation into employee responses to less routine stressors, such as workplace fires, and the role of different sources of social support in predicting coping effectiveness. This study also was a first attempt at considering the influence of the social context (in terms of group identification) on the effectiveness of social support as a predictor of coping effectiveness. Specifically, it was predicted that social support would be more effective when it came from multiple sources within the organization, that it would be especially effective when provided from a group that workers identified more strongly with, and that simply feeling part of a group would improve adjustment. Both quantitative and qualitative data were collected from 33 employees who had recently experienced a significant fire in their workplace. Results suggested that the type of stressors experienced and the type of support were mismatched, but despite this, coping effectiveness was generally moderate to high. There was mixed support for predictions about the effects of social support–no moderating effect of group identification on coping effectiveness was observed for measures of workplace support, although it did moderate the effects of family support on this <b>adjustment</b> <b>indicator.</b> ...|$|E
40|$|The {{estimation}} of atmospheric carbon sequestration by a woody plant has two alternatives for implementation: {{by identifying the}} average annual increase in volume or by determining the appropriate method for calculating the volume stand. The aim of this work was to obtain a reliable and simple method for estimating the carbon in plants and culms of bamboo (Bambusa vulgaris var. vulgaris) existing in a territory. Single samples were taken without replacement in different areas and each culm was measured in total length, outside diameter and wall thickness every two meters from the base to the segment in the upper left to present an interior cavity identifiable, in which the remaining length to the top was measured. Graphical analyses were conducted with the data collected of trends in relations between the variables considered along the culm. By regression analysis with different models {{and the use of}} determination coefficient (R 2) as an <b>adjustment</b> <b>indicator,</b> we selected those that best allow estimating the solid volume of the culm.

40|$|The aim of {{the current}} study was to add a new {{dimension}} to the literature by analyzing the Child and Adolescent Functional Assessment Scale (CAFAS) scoring system at the individual item level. The item scores represent specific behaviors demonstrated by youth and can yield valuable information about treatment needs and outcomes for vulnerable youth. However, the conventional scoring system wastes potential information about youth. The CAFAS is used nationwide, and although extensive research has been done on the properties of the CAFAS, little research has been conducted at the item level. ^ The approach that was utilized in addressing this problem involved developing and then comparing three alternative scoring systems with the standard method of scoring the CAFAS to accomplish three goals: (a) determining if a different picture would emerge for youth if the CAFAS was scored differently, (b) analyzing which scoring system was able to demonstrate the most change across three time points, and (c) investigating what additional information would be gained by utilizing an alternative scoring system. ^ Seventy youth receiving services from a Midwestern behavioral health organization were included in this study. This study was based on a sample of 35 youth in foster care, and 35 youth living at home and receiving intensive outpatient services. Youth were in the broad age group of 7 to 17. The sample population was composed of 43 boys and 27 girls. Of the youth, 72. 9 % were European American, 21. 4 % were African American, and 5. 7 % were Hispanic. ^ The results of the study suggested that when a scoring method is utilized which captures all endorsed items of the CAFAS, the level of agreement of the measure increases with other measures of impairment. Of the three alternative scoring formats developed, one particular alternative method performed as well as the standard scoring format in detecting change across time. In conclusion, advantages of utilizing a different method of scoring the CAFAS include (a) greater utility of the measure, (b) greater sensitivity of the measure in identifying and describing impairment, and (c) greater sensitivity to associations with another measure of impairment such as the Daily <b>Adjustment</b> <b>Indicator</b> Checklist (DAIC). ...|$|E
40|$|Adoption {{has become}} the focus of much {{research}} over the past decade. This research has focused primarily on outcomes for adopted children, with efforts aimed at understanding their adjustment post adoption. Little empirical attention has been given to birth parents, especially birth fathers. Research with birth mothers has shown risk in regard to their emotional adjustment post adoption and the role birth fathers and their families play when making an adoption plan. This study examined the adjustment of birth fathers whose infants were placed for adoption. Adjustment, the dependent variable, is defined as the mental health status and life impact of making an adoption plan. Adjustment was assessed by measuring symptoms of anxiety and depression, and a measure of the life impact of making an adoption plan. Emphasis was placed on the birth fathers’ level of connectedness with the birth mother and disclosure of the pregnancy to his parents, the independent variables. Level of connectedness was defined as the nature, context, and strength of the relationship between birth parents. Given previous research demonstrating the importance of the birth parent relationship and familial influences in adoption planning, it was hypothesized {{that there would be a}} relationship between adjustment and level of connectedness and that this relationship would be moderated by family disclosure with the birth father’s parents. The sample was drawn from the Early Growth and Development Study, a longitudinal study of birth and adoptive families. Birth father data (N= 149) were used and collected approximately four to six months after the child’s birth. Ordinary least squares regression models were fitted to sample data in order to estimate the inferential statistics (F, t, r) used to test study hypotheses. Results show moderate correlations between level of connectedness and each <b>adjustment</b> <b>indicator.</b> Birth fathers’ level of connectedness to birth mothers demonstrated statistically significant interaction with birth fathers’ disclosure to his family, suggesting a combined effect associated with a decrease in anxiety. In addition to revealing that more than half of the sample reported being in a committed relationship with the birth mother, birth fathers adjusted more positively when their connection to their partners and families was strong. Practice implications include greater efforts to engage fathers in planning for their child’s future to prevent difficult emotional adjustment for birth parents and acknowledgement of the important role social relationships play in that adjustment...|$|E

However, about half of adolescent best friendships end across the course of a school year, and very little research has focused on the factors surrounding their dissolution. The current study aimed to examine different aspects of friendship dissolution in adolescence, such as the number of friendship dissolutions experienced, the reasons driving dissolution, and the way that friendships ended in a sample of middle school students (N = 354). Results suggest that dissolutions are incredibly common, reported by 86 % of the sample, that conflict/betrayal is the most common reason for friendship dissolution, and that avoidance is the most common method used to end a friendship. The current study also demonstrated that adolescents feel sadness and happiness/relief most intensely following dissolution experiences, and that various reactions to the dissolution are differentially associated with both the reasons for dissolution and ways the dissolution takes place. Finally, contextual factors, like quality of the friendship, availability of social support, and the disruptive effect that ending one friendship has on other friendships all were associated with <b>adjustment</b> <b>indicators</b> following the dissolution.

40|$|Research on the {{effectiveness}} of various home-based interventions implemented in the 1980 s and 1990 s indicates that results have been equivocal. Because of the unique and complex behavioral challenges presented by each family and the need for individualized treatments and long-term interventions for these families, group research and evaluation designs are often insufficient in assessing effectiveness of home-based interventions. Alternative evaluation strategies are needed.
