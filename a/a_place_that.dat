5|$|A {{new era of}} castle {{construction}} {{began when}} the daimyo Nobunaga built Azuchi Castle from 1576 to 1579. Earlier fortifications of the Kamakura and Muromachi periods were crude large scale structures; Azuchi, however, with rich ornamentation and a keep rising seven stories high, became the prototype for castle construction of the period. The style of Azuchi Castle marked {{a shift in the}} function of the castles from <b>a</b> <b>place</b> <b>that</b> was merely a fortress and military garrison to a political, cultural and economic center. The newer style castles functioned as home to the daimyo, his family, and his most loyal retainers. Because of the expense of building such a lavish structure, castles in the style of Azuchi, functioned also to highlight the power and prestige of the daimyo. These new castles were built of wood and plaster on a stone foundation. Generally the main keep or tenshu was positioned at the highest point, surrounded by a series of interlocking baileys with walls, small towers and pathways. Residential buildings were located in one of the outer circles. The daimyo conducted his business in the citadel.|$|E
5|$|The club had one {{of their}} worst season starts ever; they lost three {{straight}} in the league – reaching a season-worst 17th position after three rounds – and both their European appearances against FC Kuban Krasnodar. Because they only lost two more games {{in the first half}} of the season, they climbed to fourth place in the table at the halfway mark. They won three KNVB Cup games to eventually succumb to the eventual runners-up in the quarter-finals. The team ended the season on a high note with a seven-game winning streak before drawing the last game of the season. This led to a second-place finish in the 2013–14 Eredivisie, <b>a</b> <b>place</b> <b>that</b> qualified Feyenoord for the third qualifying round in the 2014–15 UEFA Champions League. Overall Feyenoord won 23 matches, drew 7 and lost 10 during the season. Graziano Pellè was the season topscorer with 26 goals, of which 23 occurred in the Eredivisie.|$|E
5|$|The {{first chapter}} of the Upanishad opens as a {{conversation}} between Brihaspati and Yajnavalkya, where Brihaspati asks Yajnavalkya {{for information about the}} place where the seat of all beings, the Brahman, lives. Yajnavalkya states that true Brahman-seat of all beings, or Kurukshetra, is Avimuktam – <b>a</b> <b>place</b> <b>that</b> Shiva never left. This Avimuktam is a part of Varanasi (Banaras). All renouncers, after having wandered places, should stay at this Avimuktam. This is the place, asserts the Upanishad, where Rudra imparts the moksha knowledge just when the last vital breaths of the dying are departing, leading one to videhamukti (salvation after death). This place is holy, a place to revere and not leave.|$|E

25|$|Many of today's Biblical scholars, such as N. T. Wright, in {{tracing the}} concept of Heaven back to its Jewish roots, see Earth and Heaven as {{overlapping}} or interlocking.
